    , Accepted 21st May 2015First published on 21st May 2015AbstractTwo new D–π–A zinc porphyrin dyes with thiophene and furan π-bridges have been synthesized and employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, the triphenylamine (TPA) moiety was used as the electron donor, and the hexylthiophene chromophores were introduced onto the donor groups, which effectively extended the π-conjugation system. Although the two dyes had similar molecular structures, there was a significant difference between their optical and photoelectric properties. The EIS analysis suggested that the dye with the thiophene π-bridge had a lower charge recombination rate compared to the dye with the furan π-bridge. Based on their light-harvesting abilities, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye JP-S was higher than that of dye JP-O. The JP-S-based DSSC showed a PCE of 5.84%, whereas the PCE of the JP-O-based DSSC was 4.68%. Moreover, using the dye TTR1 as a co-sensitizer made up for the poor absorption of porphyrin dyes in the 480–600 nm range and reduced the charge recombination. The JP-S + TTR1-based DSSCs showed a higher PCE of 6.71%, and the Jsc and Voc values of the device were both increased using this strategy.
Introduction
During the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted widespread interest as a solar energy conversion technology due to their low-cost fabrication and relatively high performance.1,2 Since they were first reported by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs has made breakthrough progress.3 DSSCs comprise mesoporous metal oxides, sensitizers, redox electrolytes and counter electrodes.4,5 Among all the components of a DSSC, the sensitizers play the key role in achieving a high PCE. To date, DSSCs based on ruthenium-complexes have shown high efficiencies of up to 11.9%.6,7 Recently, Grätzel and co-workers used Zn porphyrin dye SM315 with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte to produce a DSSC with the highest PCE of 13%.8 Thus, the development of novel and efficient sensitizers is one of the most direct and effective ways to improve DSSC performance.9,10
Efficient sensitizers commonly have typical donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) frameworks because of their efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) properties.11–14 In addition, this molecular framework is easy to modify in order to tailor the bandgap energy, thereby broadening the molecular absorption spectrum and increasing the charge carrier mobility. Many efforts have been made to introduce different donors into the dyes to improve their performance; several representative donors including carbazole, triarylamine, diphenylamine, coumarin, phenoxazine, indoline and tetrahydroquinoline.15–20 In addition to the powerful electron-donating effect, the steric effects of the donors can suppress dye aggregation and prevent the I3− in the electrolyte from coming into close proximity to the TiO2 surface.21,22 The π-bridge plays a crucial role in the D–π–A framework; it can extend the length of the π-conjugated system, make the absorption range of dyes redshift to the visible and the infrared regions, and ensure that the electrons successfully move from the donor to acceptor.23–26 Nonetheless, the research on π-bridges is limited to typical π-bridges such as cyclobenzene, biphenyl, oligothiophene, anthracene, thiazole, fluorene and benzothiadizole.27–30 Changing the π-bridge will have a great influence on the performance of the device, even if only an atom in the π-bridge is changed. For example, Wong et al. used electron-defect pyrimidine instead of cyclobenzene as the π-bridge to synthesize the dye OHexDPTP; and the dye OHexDPTP was red-shifted by 46 nm compared to the parent dye M-TP, and the PCE of the OHexDPTP based-device reached 7.64%, which was almost 1.5 times that of the M-TP-based device.31 Thus, the π-bridge should be selected carefully after considering its effect on the DSSC performance.
Heterocycles and their derivatives are often used as π-bridges in the design of sensitizers due to their excellent conjugate structures.32,33 In our previous work, we synthesized a series of new zinc porphyrin dyes adopting heterocycle as the π-bridge.34 This strategy not only extended the length of the π-conjugated system, but also suppressed dye aggregation by adjusting the arrangement of dye molecules. In this paper, two heterocycles (thiophene and furan) were used as the π-bridges in DSSCs. With the purpose of comparing the two different π-bridges, two dyes (JP-S and JP-O) differing only in π-bridge were prepared. Interestingly, we found that the two dyes had clearly different optical properties and photovoltaic performances. In addition, co-sensitizers have been widely used to make up for the poor absorption region of the main dye.10,35,36 Here, we used triphenylamine dye TTR1, which has a maximum absorption peak at 535 nm, as the co-sensitizer.37 The TTR1 made up for the poor absorption of porphyrin dyes in the 480–600 nm range and reduced the charge recombination by occupying the voids between the main dyes. This work aimed to demonstrate how the variation of the π-bridge (thiophene, furan) impacted the PCE of the devices based on the two dyes.
Experimental
Synthesis of dyes
The chemical structures of JP-S, JP-O and co-sensitizer TTR1 are shown in Scheme 1, and the synthetic route is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The dyes JP-S and TTR1 were synthesized according to ref. 34 and 37, respectively.

Fabrication of DSSCs
The DSSCs were fabricated using a double-layered photoanode made of mesoporous TiO2. The photoanode (active area of 0.16 cm2) was prepared by screen printing the TiO2 paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (15 Ω per square). For the preparation of a DSSC, FTO glass plates were cleaned two times in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. The plates were then immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The TiO2 pastes consisted of an 8 μm-thick film (particle size = 20 nm, pore size = 32 nm) and a 6 μm-thick layer of scattering particles (400 nm in diameter). The TiO2 films were prepared by a programmed procedure: (1) heating at 80 °C for 15 min; (2) heating at 135 °C for 10 min; (3) heating at 325 °C for 30 min; (4) heating at 375 °C for 5 min; (5) heating at 450 °C for 15 min; and (6) heating at 500 °C for 15 min. The films were then treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the films were immersed into 0.2 mM dye (JP-S and JP-O) solution in THF/ethanol (1:4). The photoanodes underwent dipping for 18 h at room temperature to complete the loading with sensitizer. For co-sensitization, the porphyrin-sensitized films were washed with ethanol and dried and then immersed in 0.3 mM co-sensitizer (TTR1) solution in DCM for 1.5 h at room temperature. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by spin-coating drops of H2PtCl6 solution onto FTO glass and heating at 385 °C for 20 min. The photoanodes and the Pt counter electrode were sealed with a Surlyn film (25 μm) at 110 °C. The electrolyte was introduced to the cells via pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode; the holes were sealed with Surlyn films and thin glass (0.1 mm thickness) covers by heating. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuNCS) in a mixed acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, V/V) solvent.
Device characterization
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of a testing cell by a xenon light source (Oriel). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured using a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of the irradiance. The single wavelength was selected by a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel74125). Light intensity was measured by a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS), and the short-circuit currents of the devices were measured by an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
Theoretical calculations
Density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2MB level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.
UV-Vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence, FTIR spectra and electrochemical properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. For the absorption spectra of the dyes on TiO2, a blank TiO2 film was used for baseline correction before testing. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Vector22 spectrometer. The fluorescence lifetimes of the dyes were measured on a FLS920 spectrometer. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves were recorded on a Chenhua CHI660D model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was studied using a Chenhua CHI660I model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai).
Results and discussion
Optical properties

Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of JP-S, JP-O and co-sensitizer TTR1 in DCM, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The dyes JP-S and JP-O exhibited typical zinc porphyrin absorption characteristics. The two dyes exhibited high molar extinction coefficients in the high-energy absorption region, the dye JP-S reached 2.89 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 449 nm, and the dye JP-O reached 2.79 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 443 nm. The absorption spectrum of JP-S was red-shifted compared with that of JP-O, suggesting that the dye JP-S may have a better light-harvesting ability. The emission spectra of the two dyes were also investigated (Fig. S1, ESI†); their maxima lay at 659 nm and 643 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the trend of the absorption spectra of the two dyes. In the low-energy absorption region, the absorption spectrum of JP-S was higher and broader than that of JP-O. We further investigated the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two dyes anchored on 14 μm porous TiO2 nanoparticle films (Fig. 1b). The TiO2 films consisted of an 8 μm-thick film (particle size, 20 nm, pore size 32 nm) and a 6 μm-thick layer of scattering particles (400 nm diameter).8,15 The absorption spectra of the two dyes were broadened, especially that of the dye JP-S, which showed significant enhancement compared to the spectrum of the dye JP-O in the low-energy absorption region. Moreover, the triphenylamine dye TTR1 was used as a co-sensitizer. Fig. 1a shows that the maximum absorption peak of co-sensitizer TTR1 lies at 535 nm. This result indicated that the dye TTR1 can make up for the poor absorption of dyes JP-S and JP-O in the 480–600 nm range.

Electrochemical studies
The electrochemical properties of dyes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2), and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The ground state oxidation potentials of dyes JP-S and JP-O corresponding to the HOMO level energy are 1.09 and 1.12 V vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The HOMO level of JP-S is cathodically shifted by 30 mV relative to that of JP-O, which suggests that the dye JP-S is more likely to be oxidized. The values are all more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating an effective regeneration of the oxidized state. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) were estimated from the intercepts of the normalized absorption and emission spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†). The E0–0 values of JP-S and JP-O are 2.02 and 2.06 eV, respectively. The excited oxidation potentials corresponding to the LUMO levels calculated from EHOMO to E0–0, are −0.93 and −0.94 V, respectively. They are all more negative than the Fermi level of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which indicates that the electrons from the excited dyes can inject into the conduction band of TiO2.38

Theoretical calculations
In order to gain more insight into the electronic properties of the two dyes, DFT calculations were performed at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2MB level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the HOMO orbitals of the two dyes were mainly delocalized between the donors and the porphyrin macrocycles, and the LUMO orbitals were mainly delocalized between the porphyrin macrocycles and the acceptors. Thus, the electrons can easily transfer from HOMO to LUMO and induce electron redistribution from the donor to the anchoring group. The results indicated that the electrons could be effectively injected from the LUMO to the conduction band of TiO2.39
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on JP-S and JP-O are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, the performance of the JP-S-based device was superior to that of the JP-O-based device. The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of JP-S is 0.676 V, which is slightly higher than that of JP-O (0.661 V). The difference between the Voc may be due to their different charge recombination resistances (Rrec); this will be further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of JP-S (12.63 mA cm−2) is higher than that of JP-O (10.32 mA cm−2), which is consistent with the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 3b). The IPCE value of JP-S exceeds 60% from 420 nm to 455 nm and reaches 64.8% at 440 nm at the Soret band. In contrast, the maximum value of JP-O is only 55% at 435 nm. The distribution of the Q band is the same as the Soret band, and it is clear that the IPCE curve of JP-S is higher and broader than that of JP-O. This is consistent with the trends in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two dyes. In order to clearly study the difference between the IPCEs, we investigate further using time-resolved fluorescence experiments.

Time-resolved fluorescence analysis
In order to further understand the differences in the dynamics of photoexcited electron injection between the two dyes, we conducted time-resolved fluorescence experiments of the two dyes in THF and adsorbed onto TiO2 surfaces.40–42 The fluorescence decay curves are shown in Fig. 4. In THF, the average lifetime values of JP-S and JP-O are 5.75 and 3.42 ns, respectively. It is clear that the excited-state lifetime of JP-S in THF is longer than that of JP-O, and both have enough time to complete the electron injection process. After being adsorbed onto TiO2 films, the emissions of the two dyes were both strongly quenched. However, this method cannot detect such rapid electron injection process. Considering that the lifetime may belong to the aggregated dyes or attached dyes, and that there was no significant difference between the fluorescence kinetics of the two dyes on TiO2, these experiments cannot account for the differences between the IPCE values of the two dyes.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
To further investigate the electron recombination effect for the chemical structures of JP-S and JP-O, the EIS spectra were measured under dark conditions. EIS is a powerful tool to investigate the kinetics of photoelectrochemical and electrochemical processes in DSSCs.43 For the Nyquist plot in the dark (Fig. 5a), the larger semicircle corresponds to electron recombination at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface, and the smaller semicircle corresponds to electron transport at the Pt/electrolyte. The radius of the larger semicircle represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec). Obviously, the Rrec of JP-S is slightly larger than that of JP-O, which is consistent with the Voc of the DSSCs. In addition, from the structures of the two dyes, which were optimized by B3LYP (Fig. S5, ESI†), we knew that the distance between the triphenylamine nitrogen and the anchoring group was 20.9 Å for JP-S, whereas this distance for JP-O was 19.8 Å. This result indicated that the furan ring in JP-O obliged the molecular structure to bend with respect to the anchoring group. This would induce back-electron transfer more than in dye JP-S; thus, the Voc and Jsc of JP-O were lower than those of JP-S.44 From the Bode phase plots of the DSSCs, we can obtain the peak frequency (f) in the lower-frequency region. The electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated by τ = 1/(2πf).45–47 The f values of JP-S and JP-O are 17 and 21 Hz, respectively. Thus, the electron lifetime values of JP-S and JP-O are 9.4 and 7.6 ms, respectively. A longer electron lifetime corresponds to a lower dark current. These results are consistent with the Voc values of the DSSCs.

Co-sensitization experiments
Recently, co-sensitizers have been widely used to improve the performance of DSSCs because they can make up for the poor absorption region of the main dye. Here, we employed the dye TTR1 as the co-sensitizer. The J–V curves of the co-sensitized DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 3. Before the co-sensitization, the PCE values of JP-S and JP-O were 5.84% and 4.68%, respectively. After co-sensitization with TTR1 for 1.5 h, their performances were both improved; the PCE of JP-S + TTR1 was 6.71%, and the PCE of JP-O + TTR1 was 5.42%. The improvements were mainly due to increases in Voc and Jsc. We deduced that the co-sensitizer TTR1 can occupy the voids between the main dyes, which helped suppress the aggregation of the main dye. Moreover, the occupation of the voids between the main dyes made it difficult for I3− to get near the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing the electron recombination rate and improving Voc.48 We further measured the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two dyes co-sensitized with TTR1 adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface (Fig. S6, ESI†). Compared with Fig. 1b, the spectrum became higher and broader, especially in the 480–600 nm range. This result is consistent with the IPCE values of the co-sensitized DSSCs (Fig. 6b). The IPCE values of the two dye-based devices both increased after co-sensitization with TTR, and the Jsc values of the two dyes were thus both improved.

Conclusions
We synthesized two new D–π–A porphyrin dyes with thiophene and furan π-bridges and applied them in DSSCs. Although there was only a slight difference between their molecular structures, this difference obviously affected their optical properties and photoelectric properties. The absorption spectrum of JP-S was red-shifted compared with that of JP-O. The EIS analysis suggested that the dye with the thiophene π-bridge had a lower charge recombination rate compared to the dye with the furan π-bridge. Thus, the PCE of the JP-S-based device (5.84%) was higher than that of the JP-O-based device (4.68%). Moreover, we used the triphenylamine dye TTR1 as a co-sensitizer, which can not only make up for the poor absorption of the porphyrin dyes in the 480–600 nm range, but also improve the Voc values of DSSCs by suppressing the aggregation of main dyes and reducing charge recombination. The PCE of the JP-S + TTR1 based-device was 6.71%, which was about 15% higher than that of the JP-S-based device. This study suggested that DSSC performance could be improved effectively by modulating the π-bridges of the dyes.
