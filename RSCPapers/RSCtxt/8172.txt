When the electrolyte is changed from polysulfide to a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complex, a higher Voc and η are observed because of its low redox potential. To resolve the slow diffusion nature of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complexes within dense TiO2 nanoparticle/CdS film, a TiO2 nanorod (NR) array anode is applied, which increases η by more than a factor of 3. In addition, introduction of hexanoic acid (HA) in TiO2 NR/CdS film is found to improve η (Jsc as well as Voc) by alleviating the back recombination loss between CoIII and the TiO2 surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that the charge transfer resistance on the photoanode decreases by suppressing the interfacial charge recombination after HA treatment, although adding HA in the electrolyte impedes diffusion resistance.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have received attention as an alternative to silicon-based solar cells because of ease in tuning of band gap,1 high extinction coefficient of quantum dots (QDs),2 possible application in transparent devices, and low cost. In QDSCs, QDs harvest solar light and generate electron–hole pairs, which are separated to an anode and an electrolyte. The anode typically consists of a wide band gap semiconductor such as TiO2, and the electrolyte contains redox chemicals. Therefore, QDSCs are analogous to dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which a dye absorbs light; moreover, inorganic QDs can have various advantages over organic dyes, including durability under illumination. In addition, control of the quantum confinement effect gives a wide range of options to tailor their band gap, and QDs can be grown on the anode material.
However, the low stability of QDs toward chemically corrosive iodine electrolyte (I−/I3−), which is a popular electrolyte in DSSCs, requires development of an electrochemical redox couple, suitable for QDSCs. For example, a polysulfide redox couple (S2−/S0)-based electrolyte has been mainly used for QDSCs instead of an iodine electrolyte. Recently, a new generation of electrolytes, including cobalt polypyridine complexes (such as bypyridine, terpyridine, and phenanthroline) have been suggested as good electrolytes for QDSCs as well as DSSCs because of their non-corrosiveness3 and their low redox potentials (0.43–0.85 V)4,5 compared to the redox potential of polysulfide (0.55 V).2 The lower redox potential can lead to a higher open circuit potential (Voc) of the solar cells.
However, only a few studies have investigated the cobalt polypyridine electrolyte for QDSCs. For success with the cobalt polypyridine electrolyte, two main problems, i.e., slow diffusivity of Co polypyridine complexes and fast back recombination between CoIII species to the electrons in TiO2, must be solved. It has been reported that bulky Co complexes retard diffusion toward the QD surface, which limits the overall power conversion efficiency of the solar cells, because photogenerated holes cannot transfer from QDs to CoII complexes efficiently.6 Therefore, a suitable pore size in a TiO2/QD film is required for fast charge transfer between QDs and Co polypyridine complexes. Porous or one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructures are promising for feasible diffusion of Co complexes within the TiO2/QD film, and single crystalline 1-D structures are favourable in terms of electron transport across the anode. Moreover, negatively charged TiO2 strongly interacts with positive CoIII ions, which causes strong back recombination and decreases the efficiency of the solar cells. Thus, to prevent the direct interaction and to suppress the recombination between the TiO2 surface and Co complexes, blocking the close approach of Co complexes toward the TiO2 surface would be helpful.7 M. Ohta et al. reported that a bulky alkyl chain substitute in dye can reduce the back recombination.8
Alternatively, passivation of the TiO2 surface with long alkyl chain is expected to block the direct interaction with Co complexes. To demonstrate this idea, we introduced a straight alkyl chain molecule such as hexanoic acid (HA) to CdS-sensitized TiO2 film to keep some space between TiO2 and CoIII and studied its influence on the QDSC performance. For the model system, a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (bpy = 2,4′-bipyridine)-based electrolyte was chosen, because it is a simple and widely studied Co complex. Moreover, 1-D TiO2 nanostructures were used for the anode.
In this study, polysulfide and a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complex electrolyte were compared for QDSCs, and the 1-D nanostructured TiO2 anode was chosen for the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte due to its diffusion issue. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduction of the long alkyl chain molecule, HA, in Co complex-based CdS/TiO2 QDSCs can improve the power conversion efficiency by alleviating the back recombination between CoIII and 1-D TiO2, as a passivation layer.
2. Experimental section
To enhance the performance of QDSCs, the TiO2 anodes were prepared and compared with nanoparticle (NP) and nanorod (NR) geometries. A TiO2 NP film was prepared on an FTO substrate by the doctor blade technique using a 20 nm TiO2 NP paste (TTP-20N, ENB Korea) and was annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to remove any organic binder inside the TiO2 paste. A TiO2 NR electrode was prepared by a reported hydrothermal method.9 The concentrated HCl (30 ml, Sigma-Aldrich, 37%) was mixed with distilled water (30 ml), and titanium isopropoxide (2 ml, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was added slowly. After the precursor solution was mixed thoroughly, it was moved to a Teflon liner for the hydrothermal reaction. A clean FTO substrate was dipped in the solution, and the reaction was performed with a stainless steel hydrothermal reactor at 200 °C for 2 h. TiO2 NRs grown on the FTO glass were washed and annealed at 400 °C in air for 1 h before CdS deposition. CdS QDs were deposited on TiO2 NP and NR films, respectively, by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. TiO2 film was dipped in 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 (Kanto Chemical, 98%) and 0.05 M Na2S (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution alternatively for 2 min, and this process was repeated for 14 cycles. TiO2/CdS films were washed and dried under flowing nitrogen gas.10 To introduce HA molecules onto the electrode for some samples, the CdS-sensitized TiO2 NR film was soaked in a 0.1 M HA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and ethanol (J. T. Baker, 99.9%) solution for 24 h.
To compare the performances of QDSCs upon changing the electrolyte from a polysulfide electrolyte to a Co polypyridine electrolyte, we prepared two kinds of electrolytes. The poly sulfide electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 1 M sulfur (Kanto Chemical, 99.5%) and 1 M Na2S (Sigma-Aldrich) in the solvent composed of 7:3 volume ratio of methanol (J.T. Baker, 99.9%) and distilled water.11 For the Co polypyridine electrolyte, a simple and widely used [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte was prepared. [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 was synthesized according to a previously reported method.11 Briefly, a 3.3 equimolar amount of 2,2′-bypyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was added to 1 eq. of CoCl2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) methanolic solution. Then, an excess amount of NH4PF6 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) was added, and the resulting solution was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Then, 0.2 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.02 M NOBF4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), 0.2 M 4-tertbutyl pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) and 0.2 M LiSO3CF3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995%) was prepared in acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, 99.9%). In some cases, 0.01 M HA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) was added to the electrolyte.
QDSCs were assembled with a TiO2/CdS film on the FTO substrate, a counter electrode of a Pt-coated FTO glass (Solaronix), and a spacer (60 μm, Solaronix, Meltonix 1170-60) by hot pressing. The active area of the working electrodes was controlled to be 0.5 × 0.5 cm2.
The morphologies of TiO2/CdS NP and NR films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4100), and crystal information of CdS-sensitized TiO2 films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Shimaz, XRD-6000). Transmittance spectra were obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Varian, Cary 100).
The power conversion efficiency of QDSCs was measured under 1 sun condition (100 mW cm−2), which was simulated by a solar simulator (Abet Technologies, Sun 2000 Solar Simulator) equipped with an AM 1.5 filter. Further electrochemical analysis was performed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) carried out using a potentiostat (Ivium Technologies, IviumStat). EIS was measured at 500 kHz to 0.01 Hz under an applied open circuit voltage with 1 sun illumination and a fitting software (Zview, version 2.8d) was used.
3. Results and discussion
The morphologies of TiO2/CdS films were investigated by SEM (Fig. 1). The TiO2 NR arrays were aligned on the FTO film, and their average length was 1.2 μm according to the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1A), which also show that spaces are allowed between the NR arrays. Moreover, the TiO2 NP film with sensitized CdS QD was densely packed (Fig. 1C and D).
 Fig. 1  (A and B) Cross-sectional and top-view SEM images of TiO2 NR/CdS and (C and D) TiO2 NP/CdS. 
XRD patterns of TiO2/CdS films confirmed the TiO2 crystal structures, but unfortunately, no peaks associated with CdS were observed due to the small amount of CdS. TiO2 NP films had an anatase phase, the same as the TiO2 paste that we used. Moreover, TiO2 NR arrays had a rutile phase, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. However, the present hydrothermal method gave only a rutile phase on the FTO glass due to the small lattice mismatch between FTO and rutile TiO2 (Fig. 2).9
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of TiO2 NP, TiO2 NP/CdS, TiO2 NR, and TiO2 NR/CdS showing anatase and rutile structures for NP and NR, respectively. 
Furthermore, these disparities in terms of the film density and TiO2 crystal structures are believed to have an influence on the amount of the final sensitized CdS QDs on the TiO2 surface according to the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 3) and SEM EDS data (Fig. S1†). The transmittance of TiO2 NP/CdS showed that CdS QD fully absorbed the light at wavelengths shorter than λ = 500 nm. In contrast, partial absorption of the light (large transmittance) was observed with TiO2 NR/CdS film, although the same number of SILAR cycles was applied. In Fig. S1,† the EDS results also showed the relatively lower atomic ratio of Cd/Ti on rutile TiO2 NRs than anatase NPs. This indicates that there are a smaller amount of CdS QDs on NR films, if it is considered that TiO2 NP films were denser and thicker and thus had greater amounts of materials according to the SEM images (Fig. 1). Although the amount of CdS QDs was smaller on the NR film, Fig. 3B shows a higher power conversion efficiency with TiO2 NR/CdS QDSCs having both a higher Jsc and Voc. When [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte is used, we expect that spaces in NR arrays allow easy diffusion of Co complex molecules and facile electron transport to CdS QDs. Therefore, we expect that a 1-D structure is favourable to the dense NP film for the Co-based electrolyte. In addition, we confirmed that the power conversion efficiency of TiO2 NR/CdS QDSCs was higher when the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte was used instead of polysulfide electrolyte due to the lower redox level of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ compared to S2−/S0. This difference in redox potential resulted in the higher Voc and a fill factor with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte (Table 1).

In this study, we attempted to enhance the Jsc values to achieve higher power conversion efficiency with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte-based QDSCs. Jsc can be improved by suppressing the recombination loss even with the same absorption efficiency. Therefore, to prevent the back recombination at the interface between TiO2 and cobalt electrolyte, we added HA molecules on the photoanode or the cobalt electrolyte. T. Daeneke et al. reported that chenodeoxycholic acid as an additive increases Jsc and Voc with a ferrocene electrolyte. They suggested that chenodeoxycholic acid establishes a steady-state equilibrium between surface-adsorption and electrolyte dissolution and that surface adsorbed molecules block interfacial charge recombination.12 P. Salvatori et al. also observed similar behaviour of chenodeoxyholic acid in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte from experimental and computational results.13
The I–V performances of QDSCs according to HA usage are shown in Fig. 4. Unexpectedly, Cell d containing HA additive in the electrolyte showed slight decreased in both the Voc and fill factor compared to those of Cell b. It is considered that the high viscosity of HA exacerbates slow diffusion of cobalt complex molecules and decreases the cell performance. However, when HA was applied on the photoanode surface (Cell e), enhancement in Jsc was noticeable, not only Voc. It is possible that surface adsorbed HA molecules block the charge recombination similarly to chenodeoxycholic acid. If HA adsorption/desorption establishes a steady-state equilibrium between the surface and electrolyte, adding extra HA in the electrolyte may shift the equilibrium state toward more adsorption, resulting in improved cell performances. We tested the use of a surface-adsorbed photoanode in combination with HA in the electrolyte (Cell f). However, addition of HA harms the power conversion efficiency same as Cell d, and the detailed I–V parameters of QDSCs are listed in Table 1. These results may indicate that extra HA only hinders diffusion of cobalt redox complexes, rather than affecting the adsorption equilibrium of HA molecules on a TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 4  I–V curves of various QDSCs depending on the use of HA; no HA was added (Cell b), HA was added in the electrolyte (Cell d), the TiO2/CdS electrode was soaked in HA before cell assembly (Cell e), and HA was applied both on the TiO2/CdS electrode and in the electrolyte (Cell f). 
Interestingly, in a set of control experiments with NP TiO2 QDSCs, adding HA both in the electrolyte and on the electrode showed improved performance (Fig. S2†). The different behaviour is considered to originate due to several reasons. NP and NR have different TiO2 crystal structures, which can have different chemical properties. TiO2 NP had an anatase structure, whereas NR had a rutile structure. A stronger interaction of the carboxylic acid functional group was reported for rutile TiO2 than for anatase.14,15 In the case of anatase, weak interaction between HA and the TiO2 surface can cause desorption of the molecules, which requires extra HA in the electrolyte for interaction back and forth. Moreover, extra HA is considered not to enhance rutile TiO2 NRs due to its strong interaction, but rather to increase the viscosity of the electrolyte, resulting in poorer diffusion of redox pairs. Next, the different morphologies of NPs and NRs, including porosity and thickness of the film, can result in opposite trends for HA addition in the electrolyte. The NP film was thicker and dense, which was expected to cause more back recombination because diffusion of cobalt complex ions across the film would be more interrupted compared to NR film. Then, recombination can be suppressed in NP film electrodes more effectively than in NR film electrodes with the use of HA, and even HA molecules in the electrolyte might result in improved cell performance with NP film. Therefore, a careful strategy must be chosen by considering the TiO2–molecule interaction.
The influence of HA on the cell performance was investigated further with EIS measurements. The measured data (dots) and the fitted data (line) for each cell are shown in Fig. 5, and the fitted values are listed in Table 2. The equivalent circuit shows the components of the QDSCs; sheet resistance (Rs), charge transfer on photoanode (R1), charge transfer on cathode (R2), and diffusion resistance (Rw) as shown in Fig. 5.

Comparing Cell b (without HA) and Cell e (surface absorbed HA), the charge transfer resistance on the photoanode, R1, decreased considerably from 24.81 Ω to 8.42 Ω, because HA blocks interfacial charge recombination as we expected. On the other hand, the diffusion resistance of Cell d (additive HA to the electrolyte only), Rw, increased by more than twice that of Cell b, which is consistent with our expectation based on the I–V performance results that HA aggravates slow diffusion of cobalt redox pairs probably due to the high viscosity of HA. In the case of Cell f (addition of HA both in the electrolyte and on the electrode), decreased R2 but increased Rw was observed. EIS interpretation is well matched with I–V results and our suggestion, which indicates that the introduction of HA had trade-off effects on charge recombination and diffusion of Co2+/3+.
Furthermore, the stability of our best performing QDSC was tested compared with Cell c, which is a typical QDSC using the polysulfide electrolytes (Fig. 6). The normalized current by each initial Jsc was monitored over 1000 s without external potential. Photocurrents both of Cell c and Cell e decreased slightly under the simulated sunlight illumination. In the case of QDSCs, photo-bleaching of CdS was attributed to a decrease in the photocurrents, and we observed a similar level of decrease with Cell c and Cell e, regardless of the type of electrolyte between polysulfide and the cobalt-based electrolytes. These results indicate that the condition of Cell e is as stable as polysulfide electrolyte. Note that a sharp peak of photocurrent was observed with Cell e under an interrupted illumination conditions, induced by the slow diffusivity of large cobalt polypyridine molecules.5

4. Conclusions
We demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency of TiO2/CdS QDSCs can be enhanced by the use of various electrolytes and nanostructures of the TiO2 anode and by using an additive molecule. The low redox potential of cobalt bipyridine-based electrolyte contributed to an increased Voc, and with this electrolyte, 1-D TiO2 NR/CdS QD arrays performed better than NP structures with noticeable increases in both Jsc and Voc. With higher power conversion efficiency, the cobalt bipyridine electrolyte-based QDSC was as stable as the polysulfide electrolyte-based QDSC. In addition, further enhancement of Jsc, as well as Voc, was achieved by treating the TiO2 NR/CdS surface with HA, and EIS data suggested that the interfacial charge recombination between the Co electrolyte and TiO2 was suppressed when HA was added as a blocking layer. The interaction between TiO2 and HA determined the influence of the addition of HA in the electrolyte or adsorption on the surface. Here, we demonstrate the positive contribution of HA, a molecule with a long alky chain, to the QDSC performance, for which back recombination at the junction between the electrolyte and the anode has been problematic.
