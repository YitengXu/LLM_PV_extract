    , Accepted 19th April 2014First published on 22nd April 2014AbstractWe firstly demonstrate the opposite photocatalytic activity orders of low-index facets of anatase TiO2 in the liquid phase for rhodamine B (RhB) photocatalytic degradation and in the gaseous phase for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. The photocatalytic activity order in the liquid phase for RhB photocatalytic degradation is revealed as {001} > {101} > {010}, whereas the photocatalytic activity order {010} > {101} > {001} is found in the gaseous phase for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. The atomic arrangement of the different facets, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectra and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis show that the photoactivity order in the gas phase for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 mainly depends on the CO2 molecule adsorption properties on the different exposed facets, and the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers determines the photoactivity order for the dye degradation reaction in the liquid phase. These findings also provide a new direction to design efficient photocatalysts and the tuning of their photoreactivity for environmental and energy applications.
1 Introduction
In the past five years, facet-dependent photocatalytic properties of semiconducting nanocrystals with well-define facets have been intensely researched.1–6 Among the plentiful semiconductor materials, semiconductor TiO2 has been undoubtedly proven to be one of the best photocatalysts for pollutant removal in the environment and energy conversion, because of its physical and chemical stability, easy availability, low cost, and unique electronic and optical properties.7–9 There are three fundamental low-index facets: {101}, {001}, and {010} exposed in anatase TiO2 crystals. Since single crystal anatase TiO2 with a high {001} facet exposure was reported by Yang,1 the photocatalytic activity order of low-index facets of anatase TiO2 in liquid phase applications has been intensively investigated,10–16 although an unanimous order has not been obtained. However, the photocatalytic activity order of the facets of anatase TiO2 in the gaseous phase has rarely been investigated.
It is generally accepted that the photocatalytic activity can be affected by the reaction medium, and therefore anatase TiO2 with exposed low-index facets may show different photocatalytic activity orders in different reaction media. Moreover, TiO2 can be applied in a gaseous atmosphere to convert CO2 to useful hydrocarbon fuels, which is a very promising energy strategy. Together with the conversion of inexhaustible solar energy to chemical energy, this method is also expected to ameliorate and relieve the global warming problem.7,17,18 In this communication, we report the photocatalytic performance of anatase TiO2 with different exposed low-index facets for the conversion CO2 into CH4 in a gaseous atmosphere, and a ˙OH production reaction is selected as the liquid phase counterpart. The properties of TiO2 in the above two different reaction media are evaluated and this leads to a better understanding of the performance of TiO2 with different exposed low-index facets in different situations.
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity order of the facets, clean anatase TiO2 with more than 90% exposed single facet is required, so that the influences of the surface coating and the facet synergetic effect may be minimised.10–16,19 To achieve such an exposed percentage remains a challenge for the crystal facet engineering scientists. Herein, anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†) were all synthesized using a green (without the addition of fluorine or organic capping surfactants) and simple hydrothermal route using potassium titanate as the precursor. The detailed synthesis routes and characterizations of anatase TiO2 were reported in our recent paper.20 The as-synthesized anatase TiO2 samples possessed clean surfaces and the facet exposed percentages were more than 90%. They are denoted TiO2-101 (58.7 m2 g−1), TiO2-001 (62.8 m2 g−1) and TiO2-010 (32.9 m2 g−1).

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Synthesis of anatase TiO2
The TiO2-101, TiO2-001 and TiO2-010 samples were synthesized from potassium titanate. The detailed synthesis routes and characterizations were reported in our recent paper.20
2.2 Characterization
The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer equipped with a liquid cooled MCT detector. According to the photoactivity test method for CO2 reduction, 0.1 g of the TiO2 catalyst was uniformly dispersed onto a watch-glass, and then the watch-glass was put in a reaction cell. Subsequently, the above system was thoroughly vacuum-treated to remove the air completely, and then supercritical fluid-grade CO2 gas was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm was reached. 1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor, which was not in contact with the catalyst, and this was left for 60 min in the dark to allow for CO2 and H2O vapor adsorption. After that, the background was collected using an untreated sample. Approximately 4 mg of the sample was pressed onto a cell, which was used together with an ATR accessory for the infrared spectrum measurement. The IR scanning range was 4000–800 cm−1 with 4 cm−1 resolution, using 32 scans. All the experiments were performed at room temperature (20 °C).
2.3 Photoactivity test for RhB photocatalytic degradation
The photoactivity was evaluated under UV light (λ = 365 nm) irradiation. The UV light was obtained by a 300 W high pressure mercury lamp. The lamp was bought from Changzhou Yuyu Electro-Optical Device Co., Ltd, China. A typical photocatalytic process was carried out in the following way: 100 mL of an aqueous suspension of 10 mg L−1 Rhodamine B (RhB) was placed in a quartz beaker, and then 20 mg of the photocatalyst was added. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was sonicated for 10 min and then magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 min to get the desorption–adsorption equilibrium. The suspension was kept under constant air-equilibrated conditions during irradiation. A magnetic stirrer was employed for continuous mixing. At certain time intervals, 4 mL suspensions were sampled and centrifuged using a TGL-16G centrifuge (Shanghai Anting Scientific Instrument Factory, China) at 10000 rpm for 15 min to remove the particles. The upper clear liquid of the RhB solution was analyzed immediately by recording the maximum absorption band (553 nm for RhB) in the UV-visible spectrum using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.
2.4 Photoactivity test for CO2 reduction
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was carried out in a homemade closed gas system. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, 0.1 g of the TiO2 catalyst was uniformly dispersed onto a watch-glass with an area of 28.26 cm2, and then the watch-glass was put in a reaction cell (Pyrex glass). The volume of the reaction system was 350 mL. Prior to the light irradiation, the above system was thoroughly vacuum-treated to remove the air completely, and then supercritical fluid-grade CO2 gas (Minghui technical gases, Wuhan, China) was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm was reached. 1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor as the reductant, which was then left for 60 min to establish an adsorption–desorption balance. After that, the reactor was irradiated from the top by a 300 W mercury lamp (Changzhou Yuyu Electro-Optical Device Co., Ltd, China), and the photoreaction temperature was kept at 20 °C. During the irradiation, about 0.25 mL of gas was taken from the reaction cell for subsequent qualitative analysis by SP 6800A gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, GDX-502 columns) and a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD, TDX-01 columns). The quantification of the production yield was based on a calibration curve. The outlet gases were determined to be CH4, O2 and CO2. No CO, H2 or other hydrocarbons were detected. Control experiments showed that no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products were detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that both the photocatalyst and light irradiation were necessary for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 2 indicates that the photocatalytic activity order is {001} > {101} > {010} for RhB photocatalytic degradation (PCD) in the liquid phase and this result is in agreement with our previous conclusion.21 However, the gaseous phase photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 showed the opposite photocatalytic activity order: {010} > {101} > {001} as shown in Fig. 3. In order to remove the effects of surface area, the photocatalytic activities were normalised by the surface area as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). These graphs also displayed the opposite photocatalytic activity orders. This is the first paper about the reaction media affecting the photocatalytic activity order of low-index facets of anatase TiO2. In the following discussion, the possible origin of the opposite photocatalytic activity orders are showed. The most important reason may come from the different reaction media, where the electronic structure and surface atomic arrangement of the different facets must be considered.

 Fig. 3  Gas phase photocatalytic activity of TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-010 for CO2 photocatalytic conversion to CH4. 
Firstly, the electronic structure is an important factor for the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 with different exposed facets. The different exposed facets have different valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) energy levels, which determine the redox potentials and the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers in a photocatalytic reaction. It has been experimentally determined that the VB potentials of TiO2 with exposed {001}, {010} and {010} facets are similar.13,15 According to the band width (Fig. 4a) of the exposed low-index facets, the order of the CB potential is {010} > {101} > {001} (Fig. 4b). The CB values of the {001}, {010} and {010} facets are −0.45, −0.49, and −0.52 eV, respectively. These CB values of TiO2 are more negative than E0(CO2/CH4) (−0.24 eV vs. NHE, pH = 7.0),7,17,18 so CH4 can be produced on TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3. On the other hand, the CB values are close to E0(CO2/CH4) (−0.24 eV vs. NHE), which results in the CO2 photoreduction reaction being sensitive to the CB value. So, the photoreduction power order is {010} > {101} > {001} and this property creates a photocatalytic activity order of {010} > {101} > {001} for the CO2 photoreduction reaction.

For RhB PCD, ˙OH is the most important active species. However, the VB values are much more positive than E0(–OH/˙OH) (2.38 eV vs. NHE) (Fig. 4b).7 The similar VB potentials can not affect the photocatalytic activity order of TiO2 with exposed low-index facets for the ˙OH production reaction. So, the different separation efficiencies of the photo-generated carriers for the different low-index facets should be the principal reason to explain the photocatalytic activity order of the different low-index facets in the liquid phase heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction.

Fig. 5a displays the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the TiO2 suspensions (1 g L−1). It can be seen that two main peaks appear at about 380 (3.26 eV) and 468 nm (2.65 eV), respectively. The emission at 380 nm can be attributed to the recombination of free electrons from the CB bottom to the recombination centre at the ground state. The latter is the emission signal originating from the charge transfer transition from Ti3+ to oxygen anions.19 The intensity of the peak at 380 nm indicates that the order of the separation efficiency for the photoexcited carriers is {001} > {101} > {010} in the liquid phase reaction medium. Further, a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the irradiation time over 60 min (Fig. S4, ESI†) was observed for TiO2-001, while the incremental rate decreased after 30 min of irradiation for TiO2-101 and TiO2-010. The reaction constant K can be divided into K1 (0–30 min) and K2 (30–60 min). The ratio R between K1 and K2 can be used to estimate the separation efficiency of the photoexcited carriers.22 It can be seen that R001 = 1.0, R101 = 1.4 and R010 = 3.5. This result also demonstrates that the order of the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers is {001} > {101} > {010} for the liquid phase heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction.
 Fig. 5  PL spectrum of {101}, {001} and {010} single facets anatase TiO2: (a) liquid phase medium; and (b) gaseous phase medium. 
Logically, the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers should also affect the photoactivity order for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore we also examined this possibility and the corresponding PL spectra are shown in Fig. 5b. The similar intensity at 380 nm implies that the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers for the three TiO2 samples is almost the same in the gaseous phase heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction. In other words, the separation efficiency does not make a difference in this case. Therefore, in view of the electronic structure, the photocatalytic activity order for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 mainly depends on the redox potentials rather than the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers, while the liquid phase photocatalytic activity order mainly depends on the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers rather than the redox potentials.
Secondly, the atomic arrangement in the exposed facet is also very important for the photoactivity of anatase TiO2.3,5,13 On the flat anatase {001} surface, all of the titanium atoms are five-coordinate (Ti5c). The angle of Ti–O–Ti is 146° (Fig. S5a, ESI†). On the corrugated {101} facet, only half of the titanium atoms are five-coordinate and the other half are six-coordinate (Ti6c). The angle of Ti–O–Ti is 102° (Fig. S5b, ESI†).23–26 The coordination environment of the surface atoms and the Ti–O–Ti bond angle are commonly used as criteria to predict the molecular adsorption performance on the crystal facet.
For the gaseous phase CO2 photoreaction, the interaction between the CO2 molecule and the exposed crystal facet of TiO2 is the most important step. Surface atomic structures dominate the surface active sites of the adsorbed CO2 molecules. Four carbon-containing species (CO2−, HCO3−, m-CO32− and b-CO32−) were the primary intermediates on the anatase surfaces during the CO2 photoreduction process.27–31Fig. 6 shows the ATR-IR (attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared) spectra of the CO2 molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 samples with different exposed single facets. HCO3− features at 1436–1464 cm−1 and 1235 cm−1, CO2− features at 1252 cm−1 and 1668 cm−1, and m-CO32− features at 1386 cm−1 can be found in all three facets. Additional bidentate carbonates (b-CO32−) at 1594 cm−1 and 1340 cm−1 were only found in the {101} facets.27–32 This may be due to b-CO32− easily forming when the CO2 molecule is bonded to the Ti6c surface atoms on the {101} facets.33 In addition, the {010} facets have the largest CO2−, m-CO32− and HCO3− features.3,33 The {010} facets have 100% under-coordinated Ti5c titanium atoms and H2O could easily adsorb onto these Ti5c atoms. HCO3− can then form from the interaction between H2O and CO2 when the CO2 molecules exist.34–36 On the basis of the intensity of the IR peaks, it can be concluded that the {010} facet is more active and effective than the {101} and {001} facets for the adsorption of CO2 in the presence of H2O vapor, and the {001} facet had the worst performance. Finally, it can exclusively explain why the experimental photoactivity order for the CO2 photoreduction reaction is {010} > {101} > {001}.
 Fig. 6  ATR-IR spectra of the CO2 molecules (a) and H2O molecules (b) adsorbed on TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-010 in the presence of water vapor. 
For the liquid phase photocatalytic degradation reaction, H2O molecule adsorption is the first step. Theoretically, the facets with a higher percentage of under-coordinated atoms are usually more reactive for ˙OH production3,5,13 because the density of the surface under-coordinated atoms dominate the surface's ability to adsorb dissociative water. Fig. 6b shows the ATR-IR spectra of the H2O molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 samples with different exposed single facets. It can be seen than similar IR bands at 3644 cm−1 exist for TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-010. This band is assigned to the stretching vibration of dissociative water (H-bound OH groups).27,37,38 The band at 3230 cm−1 is assigned to the physically adsorbed H2O.27,37,38 The intensity of the IR bands of TiO2-001 are obviously stronger than those of TiO2-010 and TiO2-101, which reveals that TiO2-001 can adsorb the most –OH/H2O molecules. It is thus suggested that anatase TiO2 with {001} facets displays a higher photoactivity than anatase TiO2 with {101} facets for the ˙OH production reaction, and this results in a higher liquid phase photocatalytic degradation activity.
However, the {010} facets also have 100% under-coordinated five-coordinate titanium atoms (Ti5c, Fig. S5(c), ESI†).8 Why does the TiO2 with exposed {010} facets show the lowest liquid phase photocatalytic degradation activity? This phenomenon could be explained by the surface reconstruction of different facets under UV light irradiation.39–42 On the {001} facets, when the reconstruction happens, the rows of bridging oxygen atoms should be replaced by rows of TiO3 species to form a chain. As a result, additional under-coordinated Ti4c atoms are formed beside the original Ti5c atoms. But on the {010} facets, the reconstruction should introduce a surface with {101} microfaceted grooves running in the [010] direction.40,41 Consequently, the density of the under-coordinated Ti atoms on the reconstructed {010} facets will be lower than on ideal {010} facets. Thus, the reconstructed {010} facets showed low photocatalytic activity compared to the reconstructed {001} facets.
Of course, the surface reconstruction of different facets can also affect the photoactivity for the CO2 photoreduction reaction to a certain extent. Reconstructed {010} facets adsorb fewer CO2 molecules due the appearance of {101} microfaceted grooves after UV light irradiation.40,41 The experiments showed that the photoactivity of TiO2-010 decreased after 4 h of UV light irradiation. The reaction constant K2 (4–8 h, 0.71 mol g−1 h−1) of the CO2 photocatalytic conversion is close to the reaction constant K (0.74 mol g−1 h−1) for TiO2-101 as shown in Fig. 3.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we firstly report that the gaseous phase photocatalytic activity order for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 is {010} > {101} > {001}. This is in contrast to the liquid phase photocatalytic activity order {001} > {101} > {010} for dye degradation. The reaction mechanisms were suggested in terms of the electronic structure and the surface atom structure of anatase TiO2 facets in the gas phase and liquid phase. The photocatalytic activity order for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 mainly depends on the CO2 adsorption properties of the different exposed facets; while the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electron–hole dominates the photocatalytic activity order for the dye degradation reaction in the liquid phase.
