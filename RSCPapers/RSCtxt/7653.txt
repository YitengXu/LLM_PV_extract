    , Accepted 7th December 2020First published on 24th December 2020AbstractThe rapid advances in biodiesel technologies in recent years and the generation of huge amounts of glycerol as a by-product have led to a glycerol glut in the market and a significant drop in its price. The development of suitable techniques for glycerol valorization has recently attracted considerable attention and the photocatalytic process emerged as a forefront technology that integrates solar energy with glycerol conversion at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The present review focusses on the analysis of this photocatalytic process to address the challenges and opportunities for its implementation. In this regard, the mechanisms of glycerol photoreforming and photo-oxidation as well as their gaseous (like hydrogen) and value-added liquid products are first analyzed. The developed kinetic and empirical models are then discussed to evaluate the prospects in the analysis of this process through a modeling approach. Finally, a thorough critical assessment is performed on the research related to synthesis parameters like cocatalyst percentage and calcination conditions, as well as the most critical operating parameters such as the hydrogen source, reaction time, glycerol concentration, solution pH, photocatalyst loading, photocatalyst stability, source and intensity of light, and reaction temperature.M.

1. Introduction
Glycerol is a significant by-product of the biodiesel production process. It has diverse applications such as in cosmetic, paint, food, tobacco, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, leather, and textile industries.1–3 On the other hand, crude glycerol contains impurities like methanol, soap, salts, oils, and solid organic materials.4 These impurities restrict the applications of glycerol in most of the above mentioned industries, because glycerol purification implies excessive cost.5 Numerous works reviewed the transformation of glycerol for different applications, such as in hydrogen production,6–10 fuel additives,2,11–13 and polymer industries.14–16 Since the glycerol molecule is highly functionalized in comparison to other hydrocarbons derived from crude oil, a very vast range of products could be manufactured from glycerol.17
The most common methods for glycerol valorization to gaseous (like hydrogen) or liquid value-added products are steam reforming, partial oxidation, auto-thermal reforming, pyrolysis, aqueous phase reforming, biological conversion, and photocatalytic conversion (see Fig. 1).18,19 In the catalytic steam reforming process, glycerol reacts with water at high temperatures of 600–800 K.20,21 In the partial oxidation method, glycerol reacts with oxygen in sub-stoichiometric ratios at even higher temperatures of around 1000–1100 K.22 Auto-thermal reforming is a combination of partial oxidation and steam reforming, during which a defined ratio of glycerol, water, and air is fed into the reactor simultaneously.23 Pyrolysis is thermal decomposition of glycerol in the absence of oxygen to produce bio-oils for subsequent conversion to other feedstocks as intermediates. Aqueous phase reforming is a new and non-conventional approach which operates at moderate temperatures (200–250 °C) and pressures (2–2.5 MPa).24,25 Biological26,27 and photocatalytic28–31 methods are novel approaches that operate under ambient temperature and pressure conditions; as a result, significantly lower energy consumption and operational cost are expected. The use of photocatalysts in glycerol conversion not only increases the rate of gas and liquid product generation, but can also enhance the selectivity to desirable products. From the environmental point of view, photocatalytic valorization of glycerol is an environmentally friendly process. However, from the technological point of view, there are several restrictions as a consequence of its low reaction rate and the presence of impurities in crude glycerol.32 As a result, more intensive research is compulsory to overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency towards an economically viable process. In this work, the current developments and future trends of process analysis as well as a parametric study of photocatalytic glycerol valorization to hydrogen and value-added liquid products are presented.

2. Reaction mechanism
Studying the mechanism of glycerol valorization to hydrogen and value-added liquid products is essential for kinetic modeling of the process as well as enhancing the selectivity to products. The glycerol valorization process is favorable in aqueous solutions, as water is a green solvent. In such a medium, the H2O molecule not only participates in glycerol conversion reactions, but also can independently split especially at low glycerol concentrations.
The mechanism of hydrogen production from the generated H+ during glycerol valorization is similar to that of water splitting. It is shown that the addition of glycerol to water can significantly increase the rate of reaction by changing the dominant reaction path from water splitting to glycerol conversion. When the glycerol is totally consumed, the rate of hydrogen production approaches the rate of water splitting (see Fig. 2).33 As can be seen, at low concentrations of 0.10 and 0.18 nM, the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol decreased and reached the rate of water splitting after around 800 min. The fact that the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol is higher than water splitting comes from the higher tendency of glycerol to consume the photogenerated protons which reduces the rate of electron–hole recombination.

The photocatalytic valorization of glycerol can be performed in either the presence (photo-oxidation) or absence (photoreforming) of O2. Table 1 compares water splitting, glycerol photoreforming, and glycerol photo-oxidation reactions. Accordingly, in the glycerol photo-oxidation and photoreforming processes, O2 and H2O play the role of an oxidant, respectively. As H2O is not an effective oxidant in comparison to O2, the rate of glycerol photo-oxidation is around 5 times higher than glycerol photoreforming.34 In addition, as glycerol can be valorized into hydrogen only in the absence of O2, in glycerol photo-oxidation H+ ions are oxidized to H2O. It is worth emphasizing that glycerol can be valorized to value-added liquid chemicals by both photo-oxidation and photoreforming processes, however, the rate of the former is higher.34 Panagiotopoulou et al.34 analyzed the intermediates and final products in glycerol photoreforming and photo-oxidation and showed that both photoreforming and photo-oxidation may proceed through similar reaction mechanisms. However, it may not be always correct because more oxygen reactive species are formed during the photo-oxidation.

A photocatalytic reactor works like a photoelectrochemical cell where the anode and cathode are combined in the photocatalyst particles. Therefore, in photocatalysis, the generated O2 molecules are present both in the vicinity of the photogenerated electrons and H+ ions. Consequently, the O2 molecules not only hinder the reaction of H+ ions with the photogenerated electrons, but they also react with the H+ ions and obstruct the generation of hydrogen molecules. As a result, it can be concluded that the generation of O2 may be a significant reason for the very low efficiency of overall water splitting which explains the importance of the presence of carbon sources (like glycerol) in the solution to transform O2 in water to carbon dioxide (CO2).
The photocatalytic valorization of glycerol into hydrogen and value-added liquid products can be performed through its direct reaction with the photogenerated holes (hole-mediated mechanism) or indirect reaction with the photogenerated hydroxyl groups (radical-mediated mechanism).35 The direct photocatalysis occurs on the surface of the catalyst and therefore, the substrate should first be adsorbed on the surface. The indirect photocatalysis, however, can take place either on the surface of the catalyst or in the liquid bulk. Apart from the mechanism of reaction, the deep oxidation of glycerol ultimately leads to the generation of hydrogen and CO2 (eqn (1)) or water and CO2 (eqn (2)), which represent the photoreforming and photo-oxidation of glycerol, respectively: C3H8O3 + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2(1) C3H8O3 + (7/2)O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O(2)In glycerol valorization, an important question was regarding the hydrogen source (glycerol and/or water). According to the stoichiometry of eqn (1), during the photoreforming of glycerol, hydrogen molecules are produced from both glycerol and H2O, but to a higher extent from glycerol. The production of hydrogen following this stoichiometry was confirmed by measuring the amounts of hydrogen and CO2 (H2:CO2 = 7:3) using dilute glycerol solutions.7,33,36 In another work, the analysis of hydrogen production from glycerol solution in D2O showed that almost 97% of hydrogen was produced from glycerol.37,38 However, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about hydrogen production from glycerol in H2O based on this result, as the same work showed that D2O affected the process and even the rate of hydrogen production was reduced around 4 times compared to using H2O as a solvent.
The mechanisms of glycerol photoreforming and photo-oxidation are presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen, a photocatalytic reaction is triggered by absorption of a photon of light by a photocatalyst to generate a pair of electron and hole. The photogenerated charges can initiate a series of reactions in the two above-mentioned cases. For example, in the photoreforming of glycerol, the photogenerated electrons react with either H+ or H2O to produce a H˙. A hydrogen molecule can then be generated by the reaction of two H˙.34 On the other hand, the photogenerated holes can react directly with glycerol (hole-mediated mechanism) to generate products and intermediates or with water on the surface of the catalyst to generate hydroxyl radicals. The generated hydroxyl radicals can then react with glycerol or intermediates (radical-mediated mechanism) to generate products and intermediates in the solution bulk. In addition, the generated hydroxyl radicals can react with themselves to generate a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecule which can ultimately produce products and intermediates from glycerol and intermediates.35 Accordingly, the generated intermediates by photogenerated holes, hydroxyl groups, or hydrogen peroxide can be further oxidized to generate products. The complete photoreforming of glycerol leads to the generation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide (as shown in eqn (1)).34

In the photo-oxidation of glycerol, as can be seen in Fig. 3 the oxygen molecule reacts with a photogenerated electron to form a superoxide radical. The formed superoxide radical receives a hydrogen atom from either a direct reaction with H+ or H2O to generate a hydroperoxyl radical and then hydrogen peroxide can form by the reaction of the hydroperoxyl radical with an electron and H+. Finally, hydrogen peroxide reacts with an electron or superoxide radical to generate a hydroxyl radical.39 The formed activated oxygen species, i.e., superoxide radical, hydroperoxyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide have great potential to react with glycerol or intermediates.34 On the other hand, the photogenerated hole reacts with glycerol or intermediates directly or indirectly (using hydroxyl radicals), like the case of photoreforming, to generate oxidized products or intermediates. Meanwhile, the generated activated oxygen species contribute to the further oxidation of intermediates and convert them into final products.35 The deep oxidation of glycerol produces water and carbon dioxide (see eqn (2)).34
A proposed mechanism for photocatalytic glycerol valorization to value-added chemicals is presented in Fig. 4. The glycerol transformation starts with dehydrogenation to glyceraldehyde (or dihydroxyacetone) as well as hydrogenolysis (dehydration followed by hydrogenation) to propylene glycol. Further dehydration (C–O cleavage), dehydrogenation (O–H cleavage) and decarbonylation (C–C cleavage) can yield other value-added liquid chemicals containing 1, 2 or 3 carbons and ultimately CO2 (under both photoreforming and photo-oxidation conditions) and H2 (under photoreforming conditions). According to this schema, different products such as acetol, 2-oxopropanal, acetone, ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, glycolaldehyde, ethanol, and methanol can also be produced.

The mechanism of photocatalytic glycerol valorization can be different under various photocatalysts. It was observed that using the AEROXIDE TiO2 P25 photocatalyst (hereinafter referred to as P25), the glycerol conversion rate as a function of glycerol concentration hits a sharp peak, however, for Merck anatase TiO2 the rate increases linearly (Fig. 5).40 This observation suggests that the photocatalytic reaction using P25 is the combination of two different types of mechanisms: (i) direct reaction with photogenerated holes and (ii) indirect reaction with hydroxyl radicals generated by photogenerated holes. The adsorption of glycerol on the surface of the catalyst is necessary for the hole-mediated route, unlike the radical-mediated one. Therefore, as fluorination occupies the reaction sites of the photocatalyst, only the radical-mediated route is performed under the fluorinated photocatalysts. To assess the reaction mechanism of anatase TiO2 and P25, the reaction rates for the pristine photocatalysts were compared with those corresponding to the fluorinated catalysts (inhibiting the adsorption of glycerol through the addition of fluoride on their surface). The fluorination had no effect on the mechanism of reaction in the presence of anatase TiO2, but it altered the mechanism under P25 (Fig. 5).40 It was therefore confirmed that both mechanisms (hole- and radical-mediated) govern the glycerol valorization by P25, while the radical-mediated one is predominant over anatase TiO2. Under the Bi2WO6 photocatalyst, conversion of glycerol was found to be based on the direct mechanism, because the removal of hydroxyl radicals which are responsible for the indirect mechanism did not affect the glycerol conversion and product selectivity.41 It can be attributed to the fact that the standard redox potential of H2O/OH˙ (+2.3 eV) is more positive than that of photogenerated holes of Bi2WO6 (+1.77 eV) and as a result, OH˙ cannot be generated by the photogenerated holes of this photocatalyst.42

The addition of H2O2 at the beginning of the reaction as an electron acceptor changes the mechanism of the glycerol transformation reactions by producing different reactive oxygen species. Hydroxyl radicals are generated during a photocatalytic transformation by reaction with either photogenerated electrons or holes, while superoxide radicals are formed in the presence of an electron acceptor like H2O2 or O2.43 The electron acceptors can increase the concentration of the hydroxyl radical and single oxygen, which normally tends to attack the primary carbon atom of glycerol.44 It was shown that the type of generated value-added liquid product was not affected by the type of formed reactive oxygen species, but was changed by their concentration.44 As H2O2 can be converted into two hydroxyl radicals under UV radiation, or be reduced/oxidized by the photogenerated species to produce highly reactive radicals like hydroxyl, its presence in the reaction can increase the rate of the radical-mediated mechanism. Accordingly, the addition of H2O2 can increase the rate of photocatalytic glycerol conversion especially at the beginning of the reaction, and influence the products' selectivity as well.45 For example, H2O2 addition enhanced the selectivity to glyceraldehyde, glyceric acid, and glycolic acid, but decreased the selectivity to dihydroxyacetone because of its conversion to glyceraldehyde by the hydroxyl radical. Jedsukontorn et al.45 studied the effect of H2O2 in photocatalytic glycerol transformation and concluded that the radical-mediated mechanism was dominant in comparison to the hole-mediated one for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone, glyceric acid, glycolic acid, and formic acid. In addition, the addition of H2O2 led to the increase in glycerol conversion from 19% to 73% because of the enhancement of the reaction rate by hydroxyl radicals.
3. Process modeling
The majority of the research published on glycerol valorization concerns experimental works. However, a couple of efforts have also been made on modeling of photocatalytic glycerol conversion to hydrogen that focused on the development of kinetic and empirical models. The kinetic modeling of the glycerol conversion process is based on a well-established mechanism of the reactions to determine the rate of product generation as a function of operating parameters. On the other hand, empirical modeling does not require understanding of the mechanism of reactions, the whole process being considered as a “black box”. Therefore, empirical modeling is less limited to the complexity of the process. On the other hand, a few mechanistic studies were conducted on the conversion of glycerol to value-added liquid products.46 However, no work was found on the kinetic modeling of the generation of value-added liquid products as well as the optimization of the simultaneous generation of gas and liquid phase products to minimize the complete oxidation of glycerol to CO2.
Design of experiments is a practical tool to define the experiments for the modeling of the process. It not only ensures a uniform distribution of the experimental data in the defined range of operating parameters, but also optimizes the number of required experimental data. The number of required data can be much lower when the “design of experiments” is applied in comparison to the conventional ‘one-variable-at-a-time’ approach. The designed experiments for the available works on glycerol conversion were defined based on fractional factorial (in two levels)45,47 and Box–Behnken (in three levels)48,49 designs. The reduction of the number of experiments is essential especially when the number of independent variables is more than three in order to decrease the time and cost of experiments.
3.1. Kinetic modeling
A few works developed a kinetic model to predict the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol as a function of operating parameters.49–51 It was shown that the rate of hydrogen production can be modelled as a function of glycerol concentration using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) equation:52 rH2 = k1KaC0/(1 + KaC0)(3)where rH2, C0, k1, and Ka represent, respectively, the hydrogen production rate, initial glycerol concentration, reaction rate constant, and equilibrium constant of glycerol adsorption/desorption.37 As LH is supposed to predict the rate of glycerol conversion as a function of the initial concentration, it can be concluded that in this reaction, the trend of hydrogen production is similar to that of glycerol conversion. This observation confirms that glycerol is the source of hydrogen production or at least has an important contribution to the production of hydrogen from the H2O and glycerol mixture. Although LH is a simple and practical equation to model the glycerol conversion, it is only a function of the initial glycerol concentration and cannot predict the effect of other operating parameters like pH, light intensity, catalyst load, and time on the rate of hydrogen production. Clarizia et al.50 developed a kinetic model to predict the rate of hydrogen production as a function of photocatalyst load, cocatalyst percentage, and alcohol concentration (glycerol and methanol) by solving a set of differential equations. They used the experimental data to find the kinetic parameters which helped in estimating the values of the rate of hole-capture, adsorption equilibrium constants, primary quantum yield, and rate constant for electron–hole recombination. Analysis of these parameters showed that the deposition of a cocatalyst decreased the rate of recombination reaction which indicates that an important role of the cocatalyst is trapping photogenerated electrons. In addition, the equilibrium adsorption constant of glycerol was one order of magnitude higher than that of methanol, which presents a reason for the higher rate of hydrogen production from glycerol than methanol. In another work,49 an intrinsic kinetic rate equation was developed that can easily predict the rate of hydrogen production as a power function of catalyst loading and light intensity, a hyperbolic function with respect to alcohol concentration, and an exponential function of reaction time. Comparison of this intrinsic model with the LH model showed that the intrinsic model was more powerful as the LH model is only a function of time. In addition, the kinetic model parameters were calculated using the experimental data which showed that the deactivation of the catalyst was faster for glycerol than ethanol because of intermediate formation. It was also illustrated that this model is valid for different substrates and photocatalysts, which shows that the mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions are generally similar. Another kinetic model was developed to predict the effect of hydrogen production from alcohols like glycerol as a function of pH, which is a parameter that affects the process from different aspects such as glycerol adsorption and catalyst agglomeration.51 The authors showed that the rate of hydrogen production depends on the adsorption of substrates (a hyperbolic function) and agglomeration of the catalyst (an exponential function). In addition, the analysis of kinetic model parameters showed that the highest amount of glycerol could be adsorbed on the catalyst surface at a pH of around 9.1.
3.2. Empirical modeling
The empirical models developed for glycerol conversion were mainly based on response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). An empirical model that contains the terms with the multiplication of operating parameters takes advantage of being capable of considering the interaction effect of the parameters. Using a first order regression model that was developed based on the factorial design, Jedsukontorn et al.44 showed that irradiation time has the highest effect on the rate of glycerol conversion and selectivity to value-added liquid products. Bastos et al.47 first used a simple two-level fractional factorial design to screen the factors having the most significant effect in hydrogen production and then utilized the Box–Behnken experimental design to develop an RSM model that is a function of glycerol concentration, pH, and salt concentration. However, they were not successful in optimizing the process as the calculated critical point of the function was found to produce the least amount of hydrogen. In another work,48 a comparison of RSM and ANN models showed that the latter fitted better the experimental data of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Using the genetic algorithm method, the optimum catalyst loading, cocatalyst %, pH, and glycerol % were obtained at 3.9 g L−1, 3.1%, 4.5, and 50% (for comparison purposes, glycerol concentrations are expressed as volumetric percentage in this review paper), respectively. In addition, analysis of the interaction effect of the operating parameters showed that the operating parameters can significantly affect the optimum value of the other three operating parameters.
4. Parametric study of photocatalytic glycerol valorization
This section is devoted to the effect of synthesis and operating parameters in photocatalytic glycerol conversion to hydrogen and value-added liquid chemicals. The effects of synthesis parameters, i.e., cocatalyst percentage and calcination conditions are first explained. Afterward, the discussion focuses on the effects of the most effective operating parameter such as the hydrogen source, time duration of reaction, glycerol concentration, solution pH, photocatalyst loading, photocatalyst stability, source and intensity of light, and reaction temperature. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the range and optimum values of the operating parameters investigated in different studies on glycerol valorization to hydrogen and value-added liquid chemicals.

4.1. Synthesis parameters

4.1.1. Cocatalyst percentage. 
The rate of photoreforming of glycerol can be significantly enhanced with the incorporation of a cocatalyst. However, it may not increase the rate of photo-oxidation reaction, because a main role of the cocatalyst is the generation of hydrogen molecules which are not produced in photo-oxidation. By increasing the amount of cocatalyst deposition, the hydrogen production rate can increase due to the higher availability of hydrogen production reaction sites and decrease in the rate of electron–hole recombination. On the other hand, an excessive amount of the cocatalyst (more than around 3%48) can (i) make a barrier against the incidence of photons to the semiconductor, (ii) impede the access of the substrate to the semiconductor surface, and (iii) increase the rate of electron–hole recombination.53–57 Moreover, it leads to not only the decrease in the accessible active sites, but also the prevention of appropriate dispersion of particles on the photocatalyst surface as a consequence of their agglomeration.58,59 This phenomenon negatively affects the rate of reaction, as it reduces the number of active sites.58
It was shown that just 1% Pt (for comparison purposes, the cocatalyst percentages are expressed as wt% in this review paper) can enhance the rate of hydrogen production by TiO2 around 13 times.60 As can be seen from Table 2, generally 1–3% of cocatalyst produced the optimal amount of hydrogen. Deposition of around 2% Pt,33 Co,61 Ag2O,62 Bi,63 and NiO (ref. 37) as a cocatalyst on TiO2 was found to produce the highest amount of hydrogen. For Cu, Babu et al.64 reported that the incorporation of 1% Cu on reduced graphene oxide supported TiO2 is optimal, while with the incorporation of 1.5% and 0.5% Cu, the rate of hydrogen production decreased more than three times (Fig. 6). Similarly, Lin et al.65 concluded that more than 1% Cu content in CuO1−x/TiO2 decreased the hydrogen production rate because of the (i) disappearance of the effect of interfacial charge transfer and a higher resistance of Cu(II) to Cu(0) transformation, and (ii) hindering of the effective access of the semiconductor's active sites to the photons of light. Carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated TiO2 takes advantage of an effective charge transfer between CNT and TiO2 because of the formation of Ti–O–C bonds in the boundary of TiO2 and CNT. Reddy et al.66 found 0.1% CNT as the optimum amount of cocatalyst for TiO2 and reported that CNT could not effectively be dispersed when its content is less than 0.1%. As CNT can play other roles than being the cocatalyst, such as a template and adsorbent,60 this optimum value can be the outcome of different phenomena.

The morphology of TiO2 and dispersion of the cocatalyst play an important role in the photocatalytic performance and can change the optimum amount of cocatalyst. For example, 1.5, 1, 1 and 1.5% of Cu were found as optimum values for TiO2 nanorods,59 TiO2 nanotubes,67 TiO2 nanoparticles,65 and TiO2 nanosheets,68 respectively. It is shown that the optimum amount of cocatalyst can decrease when it is highly dispersed because of its higher surface area.69 For example, 1% Cu was optimum when deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles,65 while 0.5% of finely dispersed Cu was optimum.69 In another work, deposition of 0.1% of Pd and Pt on TiO2 produced more hydrogen than 0.5%, which was attributed to the smaller size of cocatalyst nanoparticles. For the case of Au, however, almost no difference was observed with the fine dispersion of particles which shows that Au may be active enough to work effectively even in non-dispersed form.70
Previous works71,72 showed that light wavelength (i.e. UV and visible) has no effect on the optimum amount of cocatalyst. This can be attributed to the fact that light wavelength affects light absorption by the semiconductor and the cocatalyst has no role in the absorption of light. For example, addition of 0.24% Pd on the surface of ZnO/ZnS nanorods was found as optimum to produce the maximum amount of hydrogen under both UV and solar irradiation.71 Similarly, the deposition of 5% and 1% of a Cu/Ni based polymer ([[CuII(4,4′-dipy)2][Ni(CN)4]]n0.7(C2H6O2)1.6(H2O)(CP-1)) as a cocatalyst on P25 and hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 was optimum for hydrogen generation under both UV and visible light irradiation.72,73


4.1.2. Calcination conditions. 
The main aim of calcination of photocatalyst materials is to (i) produce or change a crystalline phase during semiconductor preparation,74,75 (ii) form metallic particles or reduce them after impregnation of the cocatalyst on the semiconductor surface,76 or (iii) dope the formed cocatalyst on the surface with the semiconductor bulk.77,78 The temperature and duration of calcination can change the crystal phase structure of the photocatalyst by affecting the type of formed stable crystal and proximity to the stability, respectively.35 Calcination at temperatures less than 400 °C can lead to poor crystallinity. As a result, less active sites would be accessible for photocatalytic reactions. On the contrary, calcination at temperatures higher than 600 °C can cause particle agglomeration (decrease of the number of surface active sites),54,73,79,80 phase transformation,80 and formation of inactive phases through mixing with other phases or impurities.66 The duration of calcination can have a synergistic effect with calcination temperature; therefore, at 400–600 °C a higher duration may have almost the same effect of a higher temperature.
Calcination of highly stable Ag2O-loaded TiO2 at around 400 °C was found to be optimum because of lower recombination of electrons/holes compared to 300 and 500 °C.54 For titanate nanorods, 250 °C was obtained as the optimum calcination temperature while lower and higher temperatures caused a decrease in the number of active sites and inadequate accessibility of charge carriers at the surface, respectively.79 Kumar et al.59 showed that Cu decorated titanate nanorods calcined at 500 °C produced the highest amount of hydrogen. They attributed the less hydrogen production using samples calcined at lower temperatures to the generation of the single-crystalline TiO2 (B) phase which increases the rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. However, the sample calcined at 500 °C was a combination of bicrystalline TiO2 (B) and anatase phases with approximately equal ratios. As the level of the conduction band edge of TiO2 (B) is higher, the excited electrons are transferred to the anatase phase and this phenomenon can reduce the rate of electron–hole recombination.59 As seen in Fig. 7, both non-calcined Au/TiO2 titanate nanorods and the ones calcined at 1000 °C exhibited almost no hydrogen production, and the highest amount of hydrogen was produced when the sample was calcined at 600 °C which was attributed to the generation of the smallest average Au particle size.81 The optimum calcination temperature for non-uniformly shaped TiO2 and titanate nanosheets was found to be 400 °C (ref. 36) and 350 °C,68 respectively, which indicates that the morphology of the photocatalyst could affect the optimum calcination temperature. For both TiO2 and NiOx/TiO2, 450 °C was obtained as the optimum calcination temperature for maximizing the hydrogen production rate, which suggests that the deposition of a cocatalyst could have no effect on the optimum calcination temperature.82 Moreover, Petala et al.83 showed that calcination temperature had no effect on the photocatalytic activity of CuOx/TiO2 in glycerol conversion to hydrogen. It was reported that the oxidation state of copper was +2 and +1 when calcined at 350 and 450 °C, respectively, which shows that the calcination conditions may change the path of reaction through formation of different active sites on the semiconductor.69 It is shown that the calcination temperature also affects the formation of products other than hydrogen. For example, calcined NiOx/TiO2 at 450 °C produced the lowest amount of CO, and just under the sample that was calcined at 600 °C, production of CH4 was observed.82
 Fig. 7  The effect of calcination temperature on hydrogen production by Au decorated titanate nanorods81 (reproduced with permission from Elsevier). 
The time duration of the calcination also affects the structure of the photocatalyst and the rate of hydrogen production. Reddy et al.79 showed that the time duration of calcination might be more effective than the calcination temperature. Titanate nanorods calcined at 250 °C for 2 h produced around 2.5 and 7 times more hydrogen in comparison to those calcined at the same temperature for 1 and 3 h, respectively.79 This was attributed to the insufficient transformation of nanorods at lower time and agglomeration of nanostructures at higher time. The time duration of calcination can also affect the bonding between different components of a composite photocatalyst. Reddy et al.84 indicated that 2 h is the optimum for the calcination of CNT/TiO2 because of the formation of more effective carbon and titanium oxide bonds, which enhances the charge transfer between TiO2 and CNT.

4.2. Operating parameters

4.2.1. Type of substrate. 
We consider that the effect of the substrate is of interest for this review because the comparison of the potential of glycerol conversion with other substrates is essential to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of glycerol conversion. In water splitting, H2O molecules are the sole source of the produced hydrogen. On the other hand, no photocatalyst has been yet found to generate an acceptable amount of hydrogen from pure H2O.35,55 Utilization of alcohols (dissolved in water) as a secondary source of hydrogen can increase the rate of hydrogen production by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.85 This can be attributed to the fact that the oxidation potential of alcohols is lower than that of H2O.86 Different factors such as the substrate polarity (which can impact the adsorption and electron donation properties), number of α-H, number of OH bonds, position of OH in the molecule, number of carbon atoms in the alcohol, and oxidation potential of the substrate can affect their photocatalytic transformation.86–89 The lower oxidation potential of an alcoholic substrate generally leads to better hole scavenging and therefore a higher rate of photocatalytic alcohol conversion.87
It can be seen in Table 2 that the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol is higher than other alcohols. As the most well-known trihydric alcohol, glycerol has three OH groups. Some studies claimed that the number of OH groups can be a significant factor for the rate of hydrogen production among different substrates. Fu et al.76 compared the amount of produced hydrogen from C3-polyols (glycerol, propylene glycol and isopropanol) over Pt/TiO2 and found that the ratios of hydrogen production are approximately proportional to the alcohols' number of OH groups, i.e. 3, 2, and 1, respectively. Moreover, by increasing the number of OH groups of C3-polyols, the quantity of generated CH4 and C2H6 significantly reduced,76 which reveals that this increase tends to valorize the alcohols in the form of an alkane. Glycerol also produced a higher amount of hydrogen using Au/titanate nanotubes than some diols and monols: glycerol > 1,2-ethanediol ≈ 1,2-propanediol > ethanol > 1-propanol.81 These results not only confirm the order of triols > diols, but also suggest that a lower number of carbon atoms in the chain may lead to a higher rate of hydrogen production in monols. Almost the same result was obtained by using Pt and Pd as a cocatalyst, where by applying M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Pt, Au), the hydrogen production rate increased as: glycerol > 1,2-ethanediol > 1,2-propanediol > methanol > ethanol > 2-propanol > tert-butanol.85 One reason for the enhancement of the rate of hydrogen production by increasing the number of OH groups can be ascribed to the adsorption of alcohols on the surface of the photocatalyst from their OH groups which serve as an anchor for hydrogen bonding.76 Analysis of the rate of hydrogen production using a CNT/TiO2 composite that contains much more surface OH groups than pure TiO2 revealed that glycerol produced 10 and 14 times more hydrogen in comparison to methanol and ethanol, respectively.90 This discussion clarifies the reason for the very high rate of hydrogen production from glycerol, because the main glycerol byproducts (like glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone) also have a higher number of OH groups than primary alcohols.40
Other studies suggested that the attached hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl carbon (α-H) can easily be converted to hydrogen, and this hydroxyl carbon would be converted to CO2.91 For example, in the presence of tertiary butanol (as a sacrificial agent with no α-H), the rate of hydrogen production was around one order of magnitude lower than the alcohols containing α-H.91 By plotting the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol, ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol as a function of the number of α-H or OH groups, a linear trend is obtained (Fig. 8). As this figure suggests, the experimental data of methanol and ethanol (as two alcohols with the same number of OH groups but different numbers of α-H) better fit based on the number of α-H. Methanol produced a higher amount of hydrogen than ethanol as it possesses more α-H. Fig. 8 also confirms that glycerol with five α-H produced the highest amount of hydrogen which shows the significance of glycerol valorization in comparison to other alcohols.
 Fig. 8  Increase of the hydrogen production rate versus augmentation of the number of (a) α-H and (b) OH groups91 (reproduced with permission from Elsevier). 
Bahruji et al.92 showed, in addition to the presence of α-H, that the feasibility of dissociation of the α-C–C bond is another determinative factor. For example, hydrogen production from cyclohexanol (a ring alcohol) and benzyl alcohol (an aromatic alcohol) was not significant in comparison to glycerol. Chen et al.91 and Wei et al.86 reported that the rate of hydrogen production was found to be higher from glycerol than other alcohols with a different number of carbons and the following order was obtained: glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol > isopropanol. Analysis of these alcohols also showed that their polarity and standard oxidation potential change in the same order.86,93 Therefore, this comparison also suggests glycerol as the most promising alcohol for valorization purposes.
Crude glycerol generally contains impurities such as salts and organic molecules, which could significantly affect the photoconversion of glycerol. Comparison of pure and crude glycerol as a hydrogen source revealed that pure glycerol produced 2.5, 4, and 9 times more hydrogen under Pt/TiO2, CuOx/TiO2, and Ni deposited TiO2 nanotubes, respectively.94 It should be noted that the composition of crude glycerol was not similar in these works, which resulted in varied amounts of glycerol conversion under these catalysts. It was reported that millimolar concentrations of impurities such as NaCl, Na2SO4 or NaNO3 in crude glycerol could reduce the rate of hydrogen production by nearly 20%. The presence of NaH2PO4 had a more negative effect on the reaction rate than the above-mentioned impurities (reduction by approximately 60%). These negative effects can be attributed to both competitive adsorption of the anions and glycerol molecule on the active catalyst sites and foam generation from the residual soaps, while defoamers could not be effective as they are degraded by the photocatalyst. The lower oxidation potential of pure glycerol compared to the impurities present in crude glycerol can be another reason for its higher conversion rate.95,96
The impurities in crude glycerol can have an interaction effect with the operating parameters and change the optimum operating conditions. Ribao et al.97 reported that the optimum value of catalyst loading (rGO/Pt/TiO2, where rGO is reduced graphene oxide) for crude and pure glycerol conversion to hydrogen was 0.5 and 0.25 g L−1, respectively. It means that more catalyst is required to achieve optimum hydrogen production for crude glycerol, which can be attributed to the inactivation of active catalyst sites by impurities. On the other hand, 1 and 20% solutions were found as optimum concentrations for crude and pure glycerol, respectively. Almost no hydrogen was produced using a high concentration of 20% crude glycerol solution in water, which suggests that the impurities in crude glycerol can have a detrimental effect on the photocatalytic activity.97 As hydrogen is produced simultaneously from glycerol and H2O, the presence of impurities in water can also affect the rate of reaction. It is reported that using seawater rather than pure water halved the hydrogen molecule production because of the agglomeration of catalysts with electrolytes like NaCl, adsorption-inhibiting effect with formation of electrolytes and hole scavenging with chloride.98


4.2.2. Time duration of reaction. 
Most works report an approximately linear trend for the amount of hydrogen produced during less than 10 h of reaction.36,81,99,100 However, by extending the reaction time, a plateau would be observed which shows a decrease in the rate of hydrogen production.101 Reddy et al.63 reported that although the accumulative amount of hydrogen production increased, the rate of hydrogen production could decrease in time, which can be attributed to the catalyst deactivation or decrease of glycerol concentration.102 In the case of low concentrations (less than 0.1 M) of glycerol and prolonged reaction times (higher than 100 h), two steps of the hydrogen production rate were usually observed: (i) a very sharp increase of the rate to a maximum, and (ii) a gentle rate decrease up to the rate of hydrogen production from pure water (as the process converts into a water splitting one).103 The lower rate at the beginning of reaction (before the peak) is attributed to the unsteady-state stage of the reaction. On the other hand, the rate decrease after the maximum may be ascribed to catalyst deactivation and decrease of glycerol concentration.74 In high concentrations of glycerol (higher than 1%), however, the rate of hydrogen production did not decrease towards the rate of hydrogen production from pure water (water splitting) even after 1000 min.102 During the reaction, CO2 was produced with approximately the same trend of hydrogen, indicating complete oxidation of glycerol to CO2 and hydrogen.103 The accumulated amount of produced H2 and CO2 was in good agreement with stoichiometric amounts of eqn (1).34
The conversion of glycerol may not start exactly after triggering the photocatalytic reaction. Analysis of an in situ photodeposition of a cocatalyst on a semiconductor showed that the photogenerated electrons were first consumed for the cocatalyst formation and then for hydrogen production. Petala et al.83 showed that for 0.37 mM concentration of glycerol and in the presence of CuOx/TiO2 as a photocatalyst, CO2 appeared just after the illumination started; however, hydrogen was detected after 2 h. The detection of CO2 just after the illumination shows that the photogenerated holes were consumed from the beginning of the reaction to convert glycerol. On the other hand, the delay of hydrogen generation can be attributed to the alteration of the oxidation state of copper particles from Cu(II) to Cu(I) or metallic Cu. It is because of the fact that the reduction of Cu(II) is more thermodynamically favorable than the reduction of hydronium ions to produce hydrogen. This assumption can also be justified by the observation that the augmentation of Cu load led to the increase in the hydrogen detection delay (because more electron is required to reduce Cu(II)), in such a way that by increasing the Cu load from 0.04 to 2.8%, the hydrogen detection time was also delayed from 25 to 120 min (see Fig. 9).83

4.2.3. Glycerol concentration. 
Based on the current photocatalytic technology, the rate of water splitting is low, and the presence of glycerol can significantly enhance the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production. As the glycerol content of different crude glycerol sources is substantially dissimilar, discovering the effect of glycerol concentration is interesting from a practical point of view.104 By increasing glycerol concentration from millimolar to molar amounts, its adsorbed amount on the photocatalyst surface also increases and therefore, not only the rate of its transformation enhances, but also the probability of recombination of the generated charges (as a controlling step) reduces.48 Nevertheless, hydrogen production is reduced after an optimum point of glycerol concentration (usually in the range of 5–50% based on the conditions) as a result of hindering the efficient adsorption of hydronium cations and H2O molecules on the active sites of the photocatalyst.57,77,80
An addition of only 0.073% glycerol to water enhanced the rate of hydrogen production around 3 times and its further increase up to 7.93% improved more the rate of hydrogen production.33 In another work, it was found that raising glycerol concentration up to 5.48% enhanced the rate of hydrogen evolution sharply up to 300 μmol h−1, and reached a plateau at 29.2%.52 This behavior is similar to the LH kinetic model and suggests Langmuir type glycerol adsorption, which causes the hydrogen production rate to obey eqn (3). The LH reaction mechanism is expected to be satisfied only in low or medium (less than 50%) glycerol concentrations, because at high concentrations the rate of hydrogen production could decrease.
An optimum of glycerol concentration of around 50% was reported by Slamet et al.105 for P25 (Fig. 10). Interestingly, this optimum (which is around 3.94:1 (glycerol:water) molar ratio) is near 3:1 stoichiometric molar ratio which can be inferred from eqn (2). For the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst, the maximum hydrogen production was obtained at 53.6% in another study which extended the range of glycerol concentration,106 while the production decreased meaningfully by 74.0% because of the hindering of the adsorption of hydronium cations and H2O molecules. Another work using the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst also showed an optimum for glycerol concentration at 62.3%.107 For the case of using Cu69 and Co61 as cocatalysts, 5% of glycerol was found as optimum, suggesting a different mechanism in the presence of these cocatalysts. This lower optimal glycerol concentration than the case of platinum can be justified by the fact that the rate of the hydrogen production half-reaction was lower on these cocatalysts (which were less active than platinum) and therefore, a low glycerol concentration on the surface was sufficient to consume the photogenerated protons and not control the overall reaction. However, in the presence of Cu and Co as less active cocatalysts than Pt, a lower optimum glycerol concentration was obtained because the rate of the hydrogen production half-reaction is lower.
 Fig. 10  The effect of glycerol concentration and irradiation time on the amount of hydrogen production using Pt–N–TiO2 (ref. 105) (reproduced with permission from John Wiley and Sons). 
As suggested by the LH model (eqn (3)) and confirmed by experimental data of previous works,37,52 the rate of the photocatalytic reaction is exponentially enhanced by increasing the glycerol concentration. To overcome this issue, powerful adsorbents like CNT can be combined with the photocatalyst to increase the concentration of glycerol on the surface of the photocatalyst. It is shown that this technique can enhance the rate of hydrogen production at low (around 1%) glycerol concentration around two times.60 However, this effect was not observed in high (10% and 50%) glycerol concentrations because sufficient glycerol molecules were adsorbed at these concentrations.
The optimum value of glycerol concentration may vary depending on the type of photocatalyst because the nature of the photocatalyst affects the rate of reaction and the equilibrium amount of adsorbed glycerol on the surface. A glycerol concentration of 55% was suggested as optimum glycerol content for the CdS photocatalyst.47 Despite this, around 33% glycerol was reported to be optimal for CdS quantum dots, which was attributed to their high surface to volume ratio that helps in the adsorption of more glycerol.101 For Cd0.5Zn0.5S solid solution108 and Pt/Cd0.2Zn0.8S/ZnO/Zn(OH)2 multiphase109 photocatalysts, 7 and 2.2% glycerol were reported as optimal, respectively.
In addition to the overall rate of photocatalytic reaction, increasing the glycerol concentration can enhance the initial rate of reaction.40 It was shown that glycerol concentration has an interaction effect with pH, catalyst loading, and cocatalyst loading, for production of hydrogen from glycerol, and higher concentrations increased the optimum value of these parameters.48 Glycerol concentration can also affect the stability of the photocatalyst, as was reported for the case of Pt/hex-CdS.47


4.2.4. Solution pH. 
Solution acidity or basicity is one of the most important operating parameters affecting glycerol conversion.47,48 A thorough analysis of the relative importance of operating parameters showed that pH is the second most influential parameter after catalyst loading (among pH, catalyst loading, cocatalyst%, and glycerol%) and can affect the rate of hydrogen production by around 29%.48 This determinative role is attributed to the significant influence of pH on photocatalyst agglomeration and glycerol adsorption.51 pH can change different characteristics of the photocatalyst such as functional groups and surface charge which causes the alteration of the catalyst particle size distribution. It can also change the band gap of the photocatalyst and therefore the absorption of light. The pH of solution alone cannot influence glycerol dissociation because the dissociation constant is high (pKa = 14.4). However, it can affect the adsorption of glycerol and intermediates on the photocatalyst surface, as well as the desorption of products from the surface.35,110 The agglomeration of the catalyst occurs at pH around zero point of charge (pHzpc) where no electrostatic potential exists because of the lack of surface charge.111,112 The agglomeration reduces the accessible area of the catalyst for absorption of light as well as conducting a chemical reaction. For the case of TiO2 as an example, the agglomeration of particles occurs at a zeta potential of around ±30 mV and at values close to zero no agglomeration occurs because of the low electrical potential at the slipping plane.113 The agglomeration of the catalyst not only decreases the accessibility of substrates and light to the active site of the catalyst, but also increases the tendency of catalyst particles to sediment. As glycerol adsorbs on the photocatalyst surface based on hydrogen-bonding, the solution pH affects the adsorption of glycerol on the surface by changing the number of surface OH groups. In an acidic or basic solution, the surface OH groups may dissociate according to eqn (4) and (5), respectively: (4) (5)It is suggested that when pKa1 < pH < pKa2, the catalyst surface is covered with an adequate number of OH groups to adsorb required glycerol molecules for the photocatalytic reaction.51
Solution pH is not constant during the reaction because of continuous generation and consumption of hydronium and hydroxide ions. Jiang et al.36 reported the reduction of pH of glycerol solution during photocatalytic transformation to hydrogen and its tendency to a stable value around 3.5 (Fig. 11). This behavior was attributed to the generation of intermediate carboxylic acids which reduced the pH towards the acidic range. In another work, the final pH of the solution was found to tend towards 8, 6, and 5 for the conversion of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol to hydrogen, respectively. For the case of glycerol, it was attributed to the formation of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, formic acid, and formaldehyde or probably glyceric acid, tartronic acid, hydroxypyruvic acid, mesoxalic acid, and oxalic acid as intermediates.51
 Fig. 11  Variation of solution pH during hydrogen production from glycerol using Pt/TiO2 (ref. 36) (reproduced with permission from Royal Society of Chemistry). 
A comprehensive analysis of the effect of solution pH on the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol using TiO2 showed that the maximum amount of hydrogen was produced around pH of 8. This pH is sufficiently far from the pHzpc of TiO2 (which causes catalyst agglomeration), i.e., around 6.0, and close enough to neutral pH (at which glycerol efficiently adsorbs on the catalyst surface). In addition, a local minimum around pHzpc was found which can be attributed to extensive catalyst agglomeration at this pH.51 A global minimum was also observed at highly basic pH (around 12), which may be ascribed to extensive dissociation of surface OH groups (eqn (5)).51 In the case of using platinum,33,52 cobalt,61 and nickel37 as a cocatalyst for TiO2 as well as nickel-hybrid CdS quantum dots (pHzpc of around 7.5),101 the initial pH around neutral was found to be optimal because of the highest amount of glycerol adsorption on the catalyst. On the contrary, for the Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalyst, hydrogen production in acidic or neutral solutions (pH of 2–9) was found to be negligible, while it was improved with increasing alkalinity.108 However, in a high concentration of 4 mol L−1 of NaOH (around pH of 14), the production rate was decreased, and hydrogen production was maximum at an initial pH of 14. This behavior was ascribed to the relatively high isoelectric point of this photocatalyst, which is in the pH range of 8.1–11. In the case of heteropoly blue sensitized Pt/TiO2, it was reported that hydrogen was produced at pH less than 3 and no hydrogen was detected at the initial pH of 3–4.5.114 This was explained by the effect of increasing pH on the degradation of H3PW12O40 to other heteropoly anions that have lower photocatalytic activity,115 where H3PW12O40 can be completely decomposed at pH higher than 2.5.116


4.2.5. Photocatalyst loading. 
Similar to any catalytic reaction, photocatalytic conversion of glycerol depends on the amount of available photocatalyst to absorb light and also transform glycerol. Analysis of the relative importance of operating parameters of photocatalytic hydrogen production from glycerol using TiO2 showed that the catalyst loading is the most effective parameter (in comparison to other parameters such as pH, glycerol concentration (v/v), and Pt mass percentage as a cocatalyst).48 The rate of photocatalytic glycerol conversion is expected to reach a maximum value by changing the photocatalyst loading to efficiently absorb the highest amount of light.117,118 On the other hand, photocatalyst agglomeration increases in very high photocatalyst loadings; as a result, (i) a part of the photocatalyst surface could be unavailable for absorption of photons,119,120 and (ii) the light can scatter because of solution opaqueness.57,77,121 For example, in the case of Pt/P25, it is reported that by increasing the photocatalyst loading up to 2.66 g L−1, the hydrogen production rate increased.33 However, 0.1 g L−1 of photocatalyst was found to produce maximum hydrogen from glycerol using TiO2 nanotubes and CNT/TiO2. This was attributed to their high specific surface area (200 and 100 m2 g−1, respectively) in comparison to Pt/P25 (48 m2 g−1),121 which leads to a higher capability to adsorb glycerol. On the other hand, for ZnO/ZnS heterostructured nanorods with a BET surface area of 32.61 m2 g−1, an optimum photocatalyst loading of 1 g L−1 was observed.122


4.2.6. Photocatalyst stability. 
Photocatalyst stability is one of the most significant barriers against its commercialization. The deactivation of the photocatalyst normally occurs because of the adsorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface. A kinetic study on the deactivation process showed that the adsorption of poisonous intermediates/products like CO is almost irreversible if it takes place in the initial stage of the reaction.123 The produced intermediates can decrease the rate of photocatalytic reaction because of (i) poisoning of the active sites with persistent intermediates or products,124–126 (ii) seriously affecting the adsorption of glycerol on the surface of the catalyst, and (iii) generating an opaque solution.127 The number of active surface sites generally reduces exponentially because of the deactivation, i.e., the photocatalyst deactivation can be considered as a first order reaction.49,123 However, the poisoned photocatalyst can be reactivated by its annealing; for the case of TiO2 for example, at a maximum temperature of around 450 °C (to avoid catalyst phase transformation).
One approach to systematically evaluate the recyclability and durability of a photocatalyst is comparing its photocatalytic activity in several cycles by repeating the experiment after purging the reactor with an inert gas. By purging the reactor, the gaseous intermediates adsorbed on the catalyst active surface sites (like CO) can be removed to regenerate the photocatalyst. As normally the glycerol concentration does not significantly reduce in a limited time (especially at concentrations higher than 1%), the photocatalytic activity reduction in the cycles can be considered due to photocatalyst deactivation. It is worth mentioning that an increase in the rate of hydrogen production in the later cycles may be observed, which can be attributed to the higher activity of the photocatalyst because of the change in its structure in the earlier cycles. For example, TiO2 nanosheets doped with quantum Cu(II) nanodots showed a higher activity in the second experiment of the cycle in comparison to the first one for producing hydrogen from glycerol.68 Less hydrogen production in the first cycle was attributed to the reduction of Cu(II) by the photogenerated electrons, as confirmed by the observation of a higher CO2 generation rate in the first run (which shows that the photogenerated holes were produced and consumed for CO2 production). Another approach is the photocatalyst separation by centrifugation or filtration and then its employment for another set of experiments. Although in this method fresh glycerol solution is used to avoid the differences between the experiments, complete removal of adsorbed intermediates from the photocatalyst may not be possible. In addition, the quality of the photocatalyst may be affected because of its contact with atmospheric oxygen. For instance, the recovery and reuse of Cd1−xZnxS showed around 90% reduction in the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol, which was reported to be due to metal sulfide oxidation by atmospheric oxygen during the recovery.100
A couple of works studied the parameters that affect the deactivation of the photocatalyst during glycerol transformation. The stability of the photocatalyst depends on its chemical structure and can be enhanced by its chemical modification. For example, Pt/TiO2 (Kronos) exhibited around 25% decrease in the initial rate of hydrogen production from glycerol after five cycles, while the reduction was around 55% for Pt/P25 after three cycles.107 The higher rate of deactivation of P25 can be attributed to its superior surface area (around five times) which causes higher sensitivity to poisoning of the active sites. It was shown that the activity of CNTs/TiO2 (ref. 66) and La/CNT/TiO2 (ref. 88) decreased because of deactivation of catalyst active sites by intermediates/products which affected the interaction of glycerol and the photocatalyst.66 However, employing montmorillonite to make the montmorillonite/CNT/TiO2 photocatalyst successfully increased its stability.62
Changes in the chemical or physical characteristics of the photocatalyst, for instance by alteration of its chemical structure or agglomeration of particles, reduces the number of active sites and therefore causes photocatalyst deactivation. For example, it was reported that the hydrogen production yield decreased by around 22% after recycling Ag2O/TiO2 5 times; it was attributed to the reduction of Ag+ ions which affected the structure of the photocatalyst by the aggregation of particles and reduction of the photocatalyst active surface area.57 It was also reported that the stability of Cp-1/TiO2 (CP-1: ([[CuII(4,4′-dipy)2][Ni(CN)4]]n0.7(C2H6O2)1.6(H2O) polymer)) to produce hydrogen from glycerol slightly decreased after four cycles because of the agglomeration of catalyst particles.73 It is shown that the deactivation of a photocatalyst may be affected by the operating parameters such as radiation wavelength and solution pH. For example, CuS/Cd0.3Zn0.7S is more stable in basic pH rather than neutral because the sulfide ion oxidizes to sulfate and sulfite ions after 3 hours of irradiation.128 Regarding the radiation wavelength, no decrease in the photocatalytic activity of Co/TiO2 was observed after 7 cycles under solar irradiation. However, under UV illumination, around 10% hydrogen production decrease was observed under the same conditions.61 Similarly, in the case of Cu/TiO2, the rate of hydrogen production decreased by around 25% after 6 h under UV irradiation, while under solar irradiation it was almost constant up to 80 h.129 Ag2O/TiO2 indicated no deactivation and showed a 12% hydrogen production rate decrease after 7 cycles under solar and UV irradiation, respectively. This result was attributed to the fact that only under solar irradiation can Ag2O be transformed to the Ag2O–Ag phase which has high stability and photocatalytic sensitivity.54
It was reported that the combination of a photocatalyst with carbonaceous materials may reduce its stability. Cu2O/TiO2 (ref. 130) and Cu2O/TiO2 nanorods59 were stable; no Cu2+ was detected on the surface of TiO2. However, addition of rGO to make rGO/Cu2O/TiO2 resulted in around 15% decrease in the stability after 4 cycles.64 Almost the same result was obtained for addition of graphene to make graphene/ZnO/ZnS, as it was reported that the amount of produced hydrogen decreased by around 10% after 3 cycles,131 while ZnO/ZnS heterostructured nanorods were almost stable after four cycles.122 However, rGO/CuFe2O4/TiO2 was stable in the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen without leaching and deactivation after four cycles (cycles of 120 min),132 which was attributed to the high stability of CuFe2O4.133
For the case of Ag2O/TiO2 nanotubes, the amount of deactivation was found to be the same in pure water and glycerol solution and no silver was detected in the effluent,134 suggesting that other causes may exist for catalyst deactivation.135 As can be inferred, analysis of the variation of photocatalyst activity is very complicated and may be affected by different parameters such as the type and structure of photocatalyst, alteration of the photocatalyst surface area, pH of solution, wavelength of light, and combination of the photocatalyst with carbonaceous materials. Despite this, very limited work investigated the strategies to increase the photocatalytic stability for glycerol transformation and further study is necessary to reduce the rate of photocatalyst deactivation.


4.2.7. Source and intensity of light. 
Solar radiation is a sustainable, clean, and renewable source of light. Consequently, it is considered as a promising source for photocatalysis in the future.136 Around 3–5% of the total solar energy is in UV spectra (<400 nm) and the rest is in the range of visible and infrared.35 As the number of photons is important for a photocatalytic reaction, even a lower percentage of solar radiation is in the UV range by considering the number of its photons.137
Analysis of the light source of previous works shows that most of them utilized UV lamps to perform the experiments. Despite this, a few works used natural solar radiation as the light source to analyze the process under solar energy.59,61 In solar photocatalytic valorization experiments, the radiation was provided using a solar simulator, usually using a Xe arc lamp coupled with light filters.47,83,86 It is worth mentioning that the generated spectrum of the solar simulator does not supply the exact range of solar radiation.80
The comparison of the rate of glycerol conversion under UV and visible radiation is essential to analyze the potential of a photocatalyst in working with solar energy. The rate of glycerol conversion under UV irradiation is usually higher than visible light, because the photocatalysts are generally more active under UV than visible irradiation. For example, under Cu/TiO2,129 Co/TiO2,61 Pt/rGO/TiO2,97 TiO2 nanorods,138 Cu/Ag/TiO2 nanotube,89 and ZnO/ZnS–PdS core/shell nanorods139 around 1.5, 2, 1.95, 3.4, 3, and 9 times higher hydrogen production rate was observed under UV irradiation in comparison to solar irradiation, respectively. In addition,138 Bi4NbO8Br had 5 times more photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light (λ > 300 nm) than visible light (λ > 420 nm).86
Regarding the power of the light source, most of the research utilized 100–500 W lamps. It is challenging to compare this value with 1000 W m−2 reported by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as the average solar radiation at the ground level at noon,137 because the intensity of the light received by the reactor is affected by different parameters such as lamp efficiency and reactor dimensions. The light intensity is a key parameter in the rate of glycerol conversion. It is shown that the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol increases as a power function with respect to the light intensity with a power value between 0 and 1.49 It means that by increasing the light intensity the rate of hydrogen production first increases almost linearly and then non-linearly. For example, the rate of glycerol to hydrogen conversion by Pd/P25 under visible light was found to be almost linear and enhanced by around 25% by a 30% increase in light intensity.140


4.2.8. Reaction temperature. 
Analysis of the effect of reaction temperature on the rate of glycerol conversion is useful not only to investigate the performance of the process at cold or warm climate, but also to analyze the prospects of thermo-photocatalytic reactions. As a catalytic reaction, the rate of photocatalytic reaction is dependent upon the temperature. Since the band gap of photocatalysts is too large to undergo thermal excitation around ambient temperature, usually the influence of temperature is not attributed to light-driven reaction steps. However, the solution temperature influences the rate of glycerol conversion by affecting the individual reaction steps (i.e., conversion of chemicals), the adsorption/desorption of substrates/products, and their diffusivity in the solution.141–144
Raising the temperature (especially up to 100 °C) usually increases the glycerol conversion rate. Using the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst, the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol was found to enhance around twice by increasing the reaction temperature from 40 °C to 60 °C; however, further increase up to 80 °C did not affect the rate significantly which may be attributed to having no effect on the dark reaction steps.33 Most of the case studies on the effect of temperature on the rate of photocatalytic glycerol conversions were conducted on non-TiO2-based photocatalysts. By increasing the reaction temperature from 5 to 25 °C, ZnO/ZnS and ZnS photocatalysts illustrated around two-fold increase in the hydrogen production rate, while ZnO showed an increase of about three times.122 Further increasing the reaction temperature from 40 °C to 60 °C and 80 °C can double and triple the rate of hydrogen production using ZnO/ZnS because of dark reaction steps, respectively.139 Moreover, it was found that increasing the temperature from 40 °C to 80 °C enhanced the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol using ZnO/ZnS–PdS around two times more than ZnO nanorods, which can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of ZnS–PdS to temperature.71

5. Conclusions and perspectives
A large amount of attention has been devoted to photocatalytic reactions in recent decades. Most of the research has focused on photocatalytic degradation, but photocatalytic synthesis has started to attract more attention recently. The photocatalytic valorization of glycerol to hydrogen and value-added liquid products is a promising approach from a sustainable development point of view. A stoichiometric amount of hydrogen was shown to be generated from glycerol, which indicates that the maximum possible chemical energy of glycerol can be converted into this valuable energy carrier. It must be emphasized that, to investigate the capability of a photocatalyst for glycerol valorization, its performance has to be investigated under the optimized conditions of operating parameters. Therefore, in addition to the synthesis of new photocatalysts and their enhancement, a variety of research studies have been performed on the optimization of synthesis and operating parameters. The most investigated parameters are the cocatalyst percentage, calcination conditions, type of substrate, time duration of reaction, glycerol concentration, solution pH, photocatalyst loading, photocatalyst stability, source and intensity of light, and reaction temperature. A detailed review on the effect of these parameters revealed that:
• The presence of a cocatalyst can significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen production and typically between 1 and 3% cocatalyst is optimal;
• The optimal temperature and time duration of photocatalyst calcination are around 400 °C and 2 h;
• Glycerol usually produces the highest amount of hydrogen in comparison to all possible alcohols;
• The rate of photocatalytic reaction typically increases to a plateau with the passage of time and then decreases due to the deactivation of the catalyst or reduced glycerol concentration;
• A solution with around 50% glycerol concentration generally produces the highest rate of hydrogen production;
• A neutral or slightly basic solution can produce the highest amount of hydrogen;
• Depending on the surface area of the catalyst, around 0.2–2 g L−1 of catalyst loading can be optimal;
• The rate of photocatalytic reaction enhances by increasing the temperature.
In the light of this literature review, we can conclude that the photocatalytic valorization of glycerol has promising potential to generate: (i) simultaneously hydrogen and value-added liquid products under photoreforming conditions (in the presence of O2), or (ii) only value-added liquid products under photo-oxidation conditions (in the absence of O2). Although most of the research focused on the generation of hydrogen, a few works studied the generation of value-added liquid products. As a vast range of value-added liquid products can be generated from glycerol and some of them are more valuable than hydrogen, further study is essential to enhance the selectivity to the most valuable liquid products. The mild atmospheric conditions of the photocatalytic process are the key to selectively synthesize value-added liquid products. In addition, no work has been performed on the optimization of the operating parameters to obtain an optimal integrated production of desired gaseous and liquid products. In this context, selective glycerol conversion to hydrogen and liquid chemicals, and photo-reduction of the evolved CO2 to fuels are indeed promising prospects towards value-added chemical generation technology.
To sum up, in order to develop an effective process for photocatalytic valorization of glycerol, at first, access to the technology of suitable photocatalyst synthesis with a high conversion and acceptable selectivity to desired products under solar irradiation along with optimization of synthesis parameters like calcination conditions and cocatalyst percentage is necessary. Afterward, the operating parameters should be optimized to find the best conditions of the parameters such as catalyst loading and pH. Finally, the production of value-added liquid products should be considered as a promising approach in practice. On the other hand, as purification of crude glycerol is a costly process, direct conversion of crude glycerol could shift this process into a more economically viable one. In the case of hydrogen, other than its generation, its purification, transportation, and utilization are important issues that have to be considered in order to take a step towards a sustainable society reliant on solar hydrogen.
