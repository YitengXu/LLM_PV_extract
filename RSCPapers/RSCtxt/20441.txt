    , Accepted 24th April 2022First published on 1st June 2022AbstractColloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as novel hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Optimizing the surface state of QDs can provide higher current density and better stability. In this work, the original ligand (oleylamine) on the surface of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is first replaced with trimethylammonium hydroxide and then with 3-mercaptopropionic acid through a two-step process, which exhibits better optical property and higher quality. Meanwhile, pure short chain ligand (3-mercaptopropionic acid) capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs can provide an excellent charge transfer pathway when used as a hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells. As a result, PSCs based on the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs HTMs prepared by a two-step ligand-exchange process exhibited higher current density than devices based on spiro-OMeTAD, which enhanced the photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 14.65% to 15.43%.
1. Introduction
With the development of the photovoltaic industry, silicon solar cells have been widely investigated and applied in many different areas, which have gradually enhanced the photovoltaic conversion efficiency to reduce the power generation cost.1–4 However, the photovoltaic efficiency of silicon solar cells is very close to the theoretical value, and the price of manufacturing silicon solar cells is not easy to reduce, which limits the further development of the photovoltaic industry. In recent years, with the advantages of low-cost, easy-preparation, high-efficiency, etc., perovskite solar cells have received tremendous attention from many researchers.5–10 The record photovoltaic conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells is close to that of silicon solar cells, revealing that perovskite solar cells are one of the most potential candidates to take the place of silicon solar cells. However, the poor stability of perovskite solar cells still limits their industrial application.11–14 Besides the decomposition of the perovskite structure, the expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs) also have unsatisfied long-term stability. Although many efforts have been focused on improving carrier mobility and reducing the cost of the materials, it is still significantly important to develop new HTMs to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells.
With the advantages of better chemical stability and charge mobility, the inorganic HTMs such as CuI, CuSCN, NiO, etc. have been widely investigated due to their better chemical stability and charge mobility.15–18 However, the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies of these perovskite solar cells are still lower than those of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. In addition, the toxic and hard preparation of these HTMs further restricts their wide applications in perovskite solar cells. Recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with the advantages of low-cost, easy-preparation, high chemical stability and charge mobility have been considered novel HTMs for perovskite solar cells.19–23 Meanwhile, the size-effect of quantum dots can easily modulate their band energy to achieve the optimal open circuit voltage of the solar cells. Unfortunately, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells using QDs as HTMs is still lower than spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. For comparison, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have two non-occupied states in the valence band that are believed to be an excellent hole transport material in perovskite solar cells. Recently, Tamilselvan et al. have employed Cu12Sb4S13 nanoparticles as HTMs of perovskite solar cells, which achieved a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 6.5%.24 In our previous works, the band energy of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs has been modulated by the size effect, which further improved the open circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells.25 However, the charge transfer efficiency and photovoltaic conversion efficiency stability of the solar cells were still poor, which should be ascribed to the surface ligand states of the Cu12Sb4S13 HTMs in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the surface state modulation of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs should be further investigated to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells.
Here, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs with optimized surface states are employed as an efficient hole transport material of the perovskite solar cells, which can effectively promote the charge transfer and enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells. Meanwhile, the charge transfer property of the HTMs layer in perovskite solar cells has been modulated by the length of surface ligands and p–n type of QDs, which had effectively improved the current density and achieved the long-term stability of the solar cells based on our previous works.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) and chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylammonium (CH3NH3I, ≥99.5%, 4 times purification) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Copper iodide (CuI, 99%), oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99%), N,N′-diphenylthiourea (C13H12N2S, 98%) and antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Methanol (HPLC grade), tertiary butanol, trimethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), sulfur acid (ACS grade) and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). FTO-coated conductive glass substrates (FTO, 12 Ω □−2) were purchased from Peccell Technologies Inc. All the materials were used directly without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs
Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were prepared via a hot-injection process as observed in our previous works.25 1.5 mM CuI, 0.5 mM SbCl3, and 30 mL oleylamine were added to a 50 mL three-neck flask, which was heated to 100 °C under an Ar atmosphere to prepare a Cu–Sb precursor. And, 2.25 mL 1 M N,N′-diphenylthiourea dissolved in diphenyl ether was subsequently injected into the mixture at 130 °C for 5 min. Here, the band energy of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs had been optimized by size modulation as observed in the previous work, which showed a better photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells at the temperature of 130 °C in a hot-injection process. Therefore, the reaction temperatures were controlled at 130 °C. Afterwards, the product was precipitated by methanol and re-dispersed in the hexane solution. The precipitation/dispersion cycle was repeated three times. Finally, the OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were dispersed in the hexane solution.
In order to modulate the surface ligands and p–n type of QDs, the surface ligand of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs was changed from OLA to MPA by two different processes. Traditionally, the as-prepared OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs hexane solution and the MPA methanol solution were vigorously mixed for 10 min. And, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were transferred from hexane to methanol, which indicated the surface ligands exchange from OLA to MPA. Then, the MPA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs methanol solution was purified through three precipitation/dispersion cycles using tertiary butanol and hexane, which finally dispersed in tertiary butanol. For another process, the as-prepared OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs hexane solution and TMAOH methanol solution were vigorously mixed for 10 min. Then the MPA solution was injected into the mixed solution, which was vigorously mixed for another 10 min. It can be observed that the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were gradually transferred from the hexane solution to the methanol solution. (A schematic illustration of the preparation process has been shown in Fig. 1). Afterwards, similar precipitation/dispersion cycles were introduced for QDs purification, which also dispersed in tertiary butanol.

2.3. Device fabrication
All the devices were fabricated as observed in our previous works in the nitrogen-filled glovebox with oxygen and moisture levels of <0.5 ppm. Typically, the etched FTO glass substrates were first cleaned, which were deposited on a TiO2 electronic transport layer by hydrolysis of 50 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 1 h. After washing and annealing at 450 °C for 10 min, the preparation process of TiO2 films was repeated again to form compact TiO2 films. The perovskite layers were prepared through a spin-coating process on TiO2 films at 5000 rpm for 30 s by a perovskite precursor solution dissolving PbI2 and CH3NH3I3 in DMF, which were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Meanwhile, the traces of Pb(SCN)2 were also added in the perovskite precursor solution to obtain a larger perovskite crystal. Afterwards, two different kinds of QDs were spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s with the QDs dispersion concentration of 10 mg mL−1 respectively, which were annealed at 110 °C for 3 min to form QDs hole transport layers. Finally, the Au counter electrode was prepared on the HTMs layer with a thickness of 80 nm through a thermal-evaporation process. In addition, the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution containing spiro-OMeTAD, LiTFSI, tBP and chlorobenzene was also spin-coated on the perovskite layer to form a HTM layer for comparison.
2.4. Characterization and measurements
The structures and morphologies of QDs and photo-electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PertPro, PANalytical, Netherlands), scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSEM-5610LV, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). The optical absorption property and band energy of QDs and photo-electrodes were characterized by the UV-vis absorption spectra (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan). And photoluminescence spectroscopy (FS-2400, Shimadzu, Japan) was employed to characterize the charge separation property of QDs and photo-electrodes. The Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system (Keithley Instruments, USA) was employed to measure the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of different solar cells under the AM 1.5 condition (Newport 91160, 300 W xenon lamp, USA). Meanwhile, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of different solar cells were also measured using Newport's IPCE Measurement Kit, where a monochromator was used to obtain the monochromatic light from a 300W Xe lamp (Newport). In addition, the charge transfer property of the HTM layer was measured by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and time resolve photoluminescence spectra (TRPL).
3. Results and discussion
In our previous work, 5.7 nm-sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were prepared for the HTMs for perovskite solar cells, which had achieved excellent photovoltaic conversion efficiency. Here, the 5.7 nm-sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs were also investigated by modulating the surface ligand to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. The XRD pattern of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is shown in Fig. 2(a). Three obvious diffraction peaks can be observed for the QDs sample at 2θ = 29.9°, 49.7° and 59.6°, which correspond to the reflections from the (222), (440) and (622) crystal planes of the Cu12Sb4S13 phase (JCPDS no: 78-0982). The size of this Cu12Sb4S13 QDs sample is calculated from the half width of the XRD diffraction peak through the Debye–Scherrer formulation, which obtains the QDs size of 5.6 nm. For comparison, the typical HRTEM image of the as-prepared Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is shown in Fig. 2(b), wherein the QDs size of 5–6 nm can be observed. Moreover, the obvious lattice fringe value is nearly 0.298 nm, which corresponds to the (222) crystal planes of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs. Therefore, it can be believed that pure 5.7 ± 0.2 nm-sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have been successfully prepared without any other impurity phase.

The device's configuration of these perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. 2(c), which employs Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as HTMs instead of the traditional spiro-OMeTAD to form the structure as FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Cu12Sb4S13/Au. In order to analyze the structure of these perovskite solar cells, the cross-sectional FESEM image of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs based perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. 2(d). After using the layer-by-layer process for the perovskite absorption layer, the active layer of solar cells with a thickness of about 400 nm has been prepared on the surface of FTO/TiO2. Due to the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 phase and its structure in the presence of a polar solvent, the spin-coating process has been employed for QDs HTMs preparation instead of the layer-by-layer process. A thin layer for the QDs HTMs layer can be observed in Fig. 2(d), which has a slight interface between the QDs HTMs layer and the perovskite absorption layer. It can effectively prevent the direct connection between the perovskite absorption layer and the Au electrode layer. Therefore, the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have been successfully prepared as the HTMs layer to form integral perovskite solar cells.
Different surface states will induce different optical absorption properties of QDs, which may influence the charge generation of the solar cells. Fig. 3(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs (OLA-QDs), OLA-MPA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs (OLA-MPA-QDs) and TMAOH-MPA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs (TMAOH-MPA-QDs). For comparison, the MPA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs show a better optical absorption response than that of OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs in the relatively longer wavelength region, which exhibits a longer optical absorption edge for TMAOH-MPA-QDs. The short-chain MPA ligand will change the band energy of long-chain OLA capped QDs, which has influenced the optical absorption property of QDs. In addition, the PL spectra of OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs have been obtained as shown in Fig. 3(b) to further examine the different QDs. The PL peaks of OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs are located at the wavelength of 705 nm, 710 nm and 715 nm, which match well with their optical absorption spectra. Moreover, the PL peak intensities of MPA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are obviously higher than those of OLA-capped Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, which have the highest PL peak intensity for TMAOH-MPA-QDs. With the introduction of the TMAOH ligand-exchange process, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs capped with pure MPA might be received, which will improve the quality of TMAOH-MPA-QDs. Therefore, the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs prepared through a TMAOH and MPA ligand-exchange process can be considered to introduce better optical absorption and PL properties for the solar cells.

Fig. 3(c) shows the normalized PL spectra of FTO/QDs, FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/OLA-QDs, FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/OLA-MPA-QDs and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/TMAOH-MPA-QDs photo-electrodes, which can first analyze the effect of different QDs for the HTMs of perovskite solar cells. Comparing with the pure FTO/QDs photo-electrode, the normalized PL intensities of all the FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/QDs based photo-electrodes have been obviously quenched, which indicates that the introduction of QDs HTMs can effectively improve the charge separation property of the photo-electrodes. Moreover, the PL intensities of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/OLA-MPA-QDs and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/TMAOH-MPA-QDs based photo-electrodes are lower than those of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/OLA-QDs. These are attributed to the short-chain organic ligand of MPA at the surface of QDs, which may introduce a shorter path of charge transfer in photo-electrodes as compared with the long-chain organic ligand of OLA. Furthermore, the lowest PL intensity of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/TMAOH-MPA-QDs based photo-electrodes reveals an excellent charge separation property. In the OLA to MPA ligand-exchange process, a small quantity of OLA may still exist on the surface of QDs. In contrast, with the introduction of TMAOH during the OLA to MPA ligand-exchange process, the OLA ligand will be completely replaced by MPA on the surface of QDs, which can effectively improve the surface state of QDs to obtain an excellent charge separation property of the photo-electrodes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that TMAOH and MPA ligands can improve the hole transfer property of QDs, which may provide an excellent property for the solar cells under this OLA-TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process. Therefore, the better charge transfer property of the solar cells can be considered by the OLA-TMAOH-MPA surface ligand modulation.
In order to understand the improvement in the charge transfer property of the perovskite solar cells by surface ligand modulation of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells based on the HTMs of spiro-OMeTAD, OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table 1. First, the open circuit voltage (Voc) value of solar cells depends on the band energy of materials. Due to the same size of QDs, similar band energies of QDs have been observed. The red-shift of the optical absorption edge has been observed by ligand exchange from OLA to TMAOH to MPA as shown in Fig. 3(a), which may induce a slight change in the band energy of the QDs. However, there are no obvious changes in the Voc value of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells using OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs as HTMs, which indicates that a slight change in the band energy of QDs by surface ligand-exchange has no influences on the photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells. In addition, the Voc values of all the QDs HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells are close to the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (1.08 V), which are higher than those of traditional NiOx, CuI and CuSCN HTMs based solar cells. It can be believed that the inorganic QDs HTMs can provide lower trap density in the perovskite solar cells structure, which can reduce the Voc loss of solar cells.

Second, the HTMs of spiro-OMeTAD and QDs will form different interface connections in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, which may influence the fill factor (FF) value of the solar cells. As shown in Table 1, the FF values of all the QDs HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells are lower than those of spiro-OMeTAD HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. On comparing with pure spiro-OMeTAD HTMs, the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are capped with an organic surface ligand, which may influence the connection between each quantum dot in the QDs layer. However, there are some differences in FF values of solar cells based on different surface ligands capped QDs. For comparison, the relatively lower FF value can be observed for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells based on the HTMs of OLA-MPA-QDs. Due to the direct ligand-exchange process from OLA to MPA, both OLA and MPA may exist on the surface of QDs, which will induce some weak connection between each quantum dot to influence the FF value of solar cells. In addition, the FF value of TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (0.647) is slightly higher than OLA-QDs HTMs based CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (0.644). With the introduction of the TMAOH ligand-exchange process, the long chain ligand of OLA has been entirely changed to a short chain ligand of MPA on the surface of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, which can reduce the interface connection defect in the solar cells. Therefore, the OLA-TMAOH-MPA surface ligand modulation can optimize the structure of QDs HTMs in perovskite solar cells.
Third, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) value is the most important parameter to understand the charge transfer property enhancement by this OLA-TMAOH-MPA surface ligand modulation. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table 1, the Jsc values of all the QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells are higher than those of spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells. Different from spiro-OMeTAD, the inorganic Cu12Sb4S13 QDs can be considered as an optical spacer, which can generate much more electrons and holes than spiro-OMeTAD to increase the Jsc value of the solar cells.23 On comparing with OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells, the Jsc values of the two MPA-QDs HTMs based solar cells are obviously higher than those of OLA-QDs HTMs based solar cells. The long chain surface ligand (OLA) has been exchanged to a short chain surface ligand (MPA), which provides a shorter path for the charge transfer pathway in the solar cells. Moreover, MPA-capped QDs can give rise to p-type doping as compared to OLA-capped QDs, which can provide higher carrier density to improve hole transfer properties in solar cells.26 In addition, the Jsc value of TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells is higher than that of OLA-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells. The improvement in the Jsc value should be attributed to two significant factors. On the one hand, the surface ligand of OLA-MPA-QDs has been exchanged from OLA to MPA. The residual OLA ligand might exist on the surface of OLA-MPA-QDs. It still has a negative effect on the charge transfer property of the solar cells. However, when the surface ligand of TMAOH-MPA-QDs is first exchanged from OLA to TMAOH, a complete removal of the OLA ligand can be realized from the surface of QDs. Meanwhile, the TMAOH surface ligand of QDs has been further exchanged to MPA, which can receive pure short surface ligand capped QDs from the TMAOH-MPA-QDs. Therefore, the TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs can provide an excellent path for charge transfer to achieve a higher Jsc value of QDs. On the other hand, the TMAOH surface ligand has much deeper p-type doping for QDs, which can provide much better hole transfer property by employing TMAOH-MPA-QDs as HTMs for perovskite solar cells. As a result, the TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells receive a higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency (15.43%) than that of spiro-OMeTAD HTMs based devices (14.65%).
The IPCE spectra have shown the current density response of various perovskite solar cells at different optical wavelengths as shown in Fig. 4(b), which have exhibited an excellent IPCE response at the whole ultraviolet and visible spectra ranging from 300 to 800 nm for all the different solar cells. Although the IPCE peak of spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite solar cells is higher than that of OLA-QDs and OLA-MPA-QDs based perovskite solar cells, the IPCE response values of these two kinds of QDs based solar cells are higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells at the wavelength of 300–350 nm, wherein it can be believed that QDs HTMs can effectively reduce the charge recombination at the interface connection of solar cells. Moreover, the IPCE value of TMAOH-MPA-QDs based perovskite solar cells is higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite solar cells at the whole ultraviolet and visible spectra, which can further indicate that much more charges can be collected by modulation on TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs instead of spiro-OMeTAD HTMs for perovskite solar cells.
The stability of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency is a significant issue for perovskite solar cells. Here, the thirty sealed spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells are stored under the ambient air condition for 1000 h to obtain the average photovoltaic conversion efficiency of each solar cell, which has shown the normalized photovoltaic conversion efficiency as shown in Fig. 3(c). The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs based perovskite solar cells has been obviously reduced by 64% of its initial value after 1000 h. In contrast, the TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells still maintain 93% of the initial photovoltaic conversion efficiency after 1000 h, which demonstrates that employing TMAOH-MPA-QDs instead of spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs for perovskite solar cells can effectively improve the stability of the solar cells.
In order to understand the improvement in the exact charge transfer property of various QDs HTMs based solar cells, the EIS plots and parameters of perovskite solar cells based on the spiro-OMeTAD, OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs have been used as shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table 2. The similar series resistance (Rs) value can first reveal the surface connection between HTMs and perovskite absorption layers. It can be observed that the Rs values of OLA-QDs, OLA-MPA-QDs and TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based perovskite solar cells are higher than those of spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells, which induces a lower FF value of QDs HTMs based solar cells than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells. Although the stability of perovskite solar cells has been effectively enhanced by using inorganic QDs HTMs, the relatively higher Rs value still needs to be further improved. After the modulation on the surface ligands of QDs, the Rs value of TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based solar cells has been obviously reduced, which can provide more excellent interface connection in solar cells than OLA-QDs and OLA-MPA-QDs based solar cells. In addition, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values have introduced an excellent result as shown in Fig. 5(a). The Rct values of all the QDs HTMs based solar cells are lower than those of the spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells, wherein it can be believed that QDs HTMs can effectively reduce the charge transfer recombination at the HTM/perovskite interface, resulting in higher Jsc values of QDs HTMs based solar cells as shown in Fig. 4(a). For comparison, TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based solar cells have the lowest Rct value, which demonstrates that the TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process for Cu12Sb4S13 QDs HTMs can provide more excellent charge transfer property for perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, Fig. 5(b) shows the TRPL spectra of different solar cells, which can be used to calculate the exact charge transfer rate. All the QDs HTMs based solar cells show lower PL lifetimes than those of spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells (9.6 ns), which has exhibited the lowest PL lifetime of TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs based solar cells (4.3 ns). Under the calculation, the charge transfer rate (ket) of perovskite solar cells has been obviously increased from 1.04 × 108 s−1 to 2.13 × 108 s−1 with the TMAOH-MPA-QDs instead of spiro-OMeTAD as the HTMs. Therefore, although the TMAOH-MPA-QDs HTMs have induced a relatively higher Rs value of the perovskite solar cells, the effective improvement in the charge transfer property has provided a much higher current density of the solar cells to realize the enhancement in photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

Fig. 6 depicts the surface ligand-exchange process of QDs which enhances the charge generation and transfer property of the QDSSCs. After the hot-injection process, the surface of QDs has been functionalized with OLA, which hinders the charge transfer in solar cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the OLA can be directly changed to MPA through the OLA-MPA ligand-exchange process, which can improve the path of the charge transfer process. However, it is inevitable to maintain few OLA ligands on the surface of QDs, which still influence the path of charge transfer in solar cells. With the OLA-TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process, the OLA ligand of QDs can be effectively changed to TMAOH, which will not retain any OLA ligand on the surface of QDs. Meanwhile, the TMAOH ligand of QDs can be entirely changed to the MPA ligand, which can form a pure surface condition of QDs with only a short chain ligand of MPA. Therefore, different from the OLA-MPA ligand-exchange process, the QDs prepared via the OLA-TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process can provide better charge transfer efficiency in solar cells, which leads to a higher Jsc value to realize the enhancement of photovoltaic conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the surface ligands of QDs have been successfully modulated by ligand-exchange from OLA to TMAOH to MPA. With the OLA-TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process, the optical absorption edge of QDs has slightly expanded to the long wavelength optical region, and the PL intensity of QDs has obviously increased, which provides an excellent optical absorption property and PL quantum yield of QDs. Due to the enhanced charge transfer property through an OLA-TMAOH-MPA ligand-exchange process, the Cu12Sb4S13 QD HTMs based on perovskite solar cells exhibit a higher Jsc value than that of spiro-OMeTAD HTMs for perovskite solar cells, which has shown an enhancement in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells from 14.65% to 15.43%. Meanwhile, the stability of perovskite solar cells has been improved by using the OLA-TMAOH-MPA QDs as HTMs. It can be considered that the surface treatment on QDs HTMs may provide an excellent way to develop the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells in further investigations.
