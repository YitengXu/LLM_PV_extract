    , Accepted 14th February 2023First published on 14th February 2023AbstractThe defects at the interface of the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite absorber, as the charge-carrier recombination centers, play an important role in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we use an organic salt, i.e., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate (EMIM DEP), to passivate such defects, which could simultaneously enhance the interface quality and perovskite crystallization. The DEP groups saturate the dangling bonds of surface Sn atoms, efficiently suppressing the interfacial charge recombination and tailoring the energy alignment of the SnO2/perovskite interface for better carrier extraction. Additionally, EMIM DEP not only improves the crystal growth of perovskite, but also passivates the defects of the perovskite grain boundary. Consequently, the EMIM DEP-based device presents a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.21%, which is much higher than that of the control device (21.14%). The EMIM DEP-based device retains 95% and 87% of its original PCE after storage for over 2000 h in a 30 ± 5% RH ambient air and under operation at the maximum power point for 700 h, respectively. Therefore, it is demonstrated that interface modification via such an organic salt is a feasible and efficient approach to improve the passivation and contact properties for high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest from the photovoltaic (PV) community due to their distinguished photoelectric properties including high absorption coefficients and defect tolerance, small exciton binding energy, and long carrier diffusion length, as well as easy solution-fabrication at low temperatures, etc.1–3 Through an intensive worldwide effort, such a PSC with a regular n–i–p architecture has recently hit a new recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%.4,5 Thanks to the remarkable properties of the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL),6,7 the photogenerated carriers could be effectively separated and extracted. In particular, the ETL plays a decisive role in extracting electrons from the perovskite light-absorption layer, for which titanium dioxide (TiO2), tin oxide (SnO2), 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]C61 (PCBM) C60, etc., are promising candidate materials.8–12 Specifically, SnO2 has been widely used to construct highly efficient PSCs, due to its enormous advantages, such as low processing temperature (<150 °C), high electron mobility, strong light stability, high conductivity, and suitable energy level.4,13,14 However, it is still challenging to passivate the surface defects of SnO2 films by a simple method to suppress the current leakage in the ETL and ETL/perovskite interface as well, with the purpose of unlocking the full potential of such a PSC.15 Furthermore, the SnO2 film, as a substrate for nucleation and growth of the perovskite film, is also very crucial.
Surface defects of SnO2 can be passivated efficiently by interface engineering, which could resolve the problem of unbalancing charge transport and recombination to improve device performance and stability. In recent years, there have been so many materials to modify the interface of the ETL/perovskite such as ionic salts, Lewis acid–base, organic salts, etc. Ionic salts such as KCl, and RbF could passivate defects efficiently.16,17 KCl can efficiently passivate SnO2 and the partial KCl be dissolved into the perovskite solution, which enlarged the perovskite grain size and passivated the grain boundaries, leading to the enhancement of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a corresponding PCE increase.16 Zhong's group used a multifunctional Lewis base (3Cl-BASK) to bond the uncoordinated Sn of SnO2 particles by the carbon–chlorine bonds (C–Cl), obviously reducing the oxygen vacancies to enhance the interfacial quality for a high-performance device.18 The reduction of defect density and carrier recombination at this ETL/perovskite interface is due to the synergistic effects of the functional group-rich organic anions and the halide ion. As effective interface materials, organic salts (OS) containing flexibly selectable cations (pyrrolidinium, triazolium, ammonium, etc.) and anions (halide, tetrafluoroborate, carboxylic acids, etc.), have been widely employed to promote the device performance.19–24 For example, the introduction of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4) can modify the work function of TiO2, improve the carrier mobility and decrease the defect density of perovskite, thus resulting in an improved device PCE.25 By modifying the TiO2 surface with the hexafluorophosphate group through the tetrafluoroborate ion, the energy level of the ETL can be well matched with that of the CsPbI2Br inorganic perovskite.26 Moreover, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was used to passivate the defects of the SnO2 surface and perovskite boundaries by using the N(CH3)4+ and OH− capping agents, leading to enhanced device performance.27 In addition, biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) was introduced to the SnO2 surface via the linkage provided by Lewis coordination/electrostatic coupling, and a certified PCE of 24.4% was achieved.28 Conclusively, the organic salts, as effective interface modifiers for high-performance PSCs, provide a promising strategy to effectively passivate defects, adjust energy levels, and improve perovskite crystallization. However, the stability of OS-based perovskite devices is relatively poor. For example, the BGCl-based device just retains 95% of its initial PCE after 500 h at 20 °C and 30% relative humidity (RH) under ambient conditions.28 It is thus necessary to screen suitable OS molecular materials and reveal their design rule for high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
In our previous work, we have confirmed that the phosphate radicals were easily fulfilled into the oxygen vacancies with strong bonds of Sn–O–P to work as efficient passivation materials for the SnO2/perovskite interface,8 and imidazole was also used to regulate perovskite crystallization.29 Considering these unique functions of cations and anions, we here chose 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate (EMIM DEP) to modify the SnO2 surface and passivate perovskite boundaries for minimizing the surface/interface defect density. The DEP groups efficiently saturate the surface uncoordinated Sn of SnO2 nanoparticles, and the remaining DEP and EMIM can be further dissolved into the perovskite precursor to mediate the crystallization process, enabling better perovskite crystallization and fewer defects at the perovskite boundaries due to the occupation of the vacancies of perovskite by functional groups. Also, after EMIM DEP modification, a favorable energy level alignment is formed, which is beneficial for electron extraction. As a result, the EMIM DEP-modified device achieves a high PCE of 23.21% and long-term stability (i.e., retains 95% of its original PCE after 2000 h storage in 30 ± 5% RH ambient).
2. Results and discussion
The schematics of the EMIM DEP molecular structure and possible working mechanism are illustrated in a regular perovskite device with an architecture of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The partial residual groups of EMIM DEP will be dissolved by using the perovskite solution and bond to the dangling bonds at the perovskite boundaries. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) was used to analyze the minute structural changes of the surface chemistry before (control) and after (target) the deposition of EMIM DEP, as shown in Fig. 1(b). With EMIM DEP modification, there are two new distinct peaks at 1220 and 1057 cm−1 as marked by blue dashed lines, which can be attributed to the PO and P–O–C stretching of DEP groups, respectively. In addition, it is clearly shown that the absorption peak of Sn–O red-shifts from 556 to 552 cm−1, due to the grafting interaction between the PO bond and Sn dangling bond of the SnO2 surface.8 Meaningfully, the oxygen vacancies are filled by the strong electron-absorbing groups inherent to DEP, leading to a change in the electron cloud distribution of the Sn–O–DEP bond. More importantly, a dipole moment may be formed, which could push the holes away from the ETL surface, as effective field-effect passivation. Moreover, we have verified that the presence of an EMIM DEP layer would not degrade the optical performance of SnO2 films (Fig. S1†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to investigate the interactions of EMIM DEP-modified SnO2 films.30,31 For both the control and target samples, the peaks of O 1s and Sn 3d can be seen as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively, while the additional peaks of N 1s and P 2p can be observed in the target sample as demonstrated in Fig. S2–S4,† which well agreed with the results of FTIR. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s for the control SnO2 presents two characteristic peaks at 533.10 and 531.50 eV, which can be assigned to the surface absorbed hydroxyl (–OH) and Sn–O bond in SnO2, respectively (Fig. 1(c)). With the EMIM DEP treatment, the –OH peak is obviously weakened due to the dehydration of surface–OH by the DEP group, and the corresponding peak shifts from 533.10 to 533.43 eV, which can be attributed to the covalent bond (–OH⋯N–C) between the residual –OH and EMIM groups. An additional peak located at 532.52 eV can be seen, which can be assigned to P–O in the DEP group. Additionally, there are two distinct peaks at 489.85 and 487.45 eV in the Sn 3d spectrum for the control SnO2, which correspond to Sn 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively. In the presence of the DEP group, the Sn–O–DEP and Sn–OH⋯N–C bonds lead to a peak shift towards a lower binding energy (∼0.9 eV), as shown in Fig. 1(d).

Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was also carried out to determine the work functions (WFs) or energy levels of the two related samples. The WFs are calculated as follows: WF = hν − Ecuoff(1)
The corresponding results shown in Fig. 1(e) reveal that the WF for EMIM DEP-modified SnO2 is determined to be 4.67 eV, which is lower than that of control SnO2 (4.91 eV).24,32 Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurement was also performed to visualize the surface potentials of the SnO2 film, as shown in Fig. 1(f) and (g). The EMIM DEP-SnO2 and control SnO2 samples exhibit average potentials of 630 and 380 mV, respectively, revealing that the introduction of EMIM DEP could effectively modify the WF of the SnO2 film. The Fermi level (Ef) and valence band maximum (VBM) of SnO2 can be deduced from the UPS spectra, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of SnO2 can be also derived from the VBM and optical band gap (Eg, calculated from ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy absorption spectroscopy).18 The perovskite bandgap is 1.54 eV, as shown in Fig. S5.† The deduced energy level diagrams and derivation method are illustrated in Fig. S6.† Both the VBM and CBM of EMIM DEP-modified SnO2 shift downwards, forming a desired energy level alignment to promote electron extraction.
To understand the effect of EMIM DEP-SnO2 on perovskite growth, contact angle tests were performed on the surface of SnO2 with and without EMIM DEP treatment. Compared with the SnO2 counterpart (15.45°), the contact angle of perovskite solution on EMIM DEP-SnO2 is determined to be 31.86° as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). According to the classical nucleation theory, the increase in the contact angle will reduce the homogeneous critical energy and increase the heterogeneous nucleation critical energy.33–35 Thus, introducing EMIM DEP could suppress heterogeneous nucleation and facilitate grain boundary migration to form larger perovskite grain sizes during the perovskite crystallization process.34,36 Furthermore, EMIM DEP-SnO2 presents a rough surface, providing more nucleation sites for perovskite growth (Fig. S7†). To study the influence of EMIM DEP-modified SnO2 on perovskite growth, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the perovskite crystal structures with the corresponding results demonstrated in Fig. 2(b). For the two related samples, XRD patterns show the (110) and (220) crystal planes at 14.0° and 28.2° for polycrystalline perovskite, respectively. A slightly higher (220) peak intensity together with a reduced residual lead iodide (PbI2) peak of perovskite on EMIM DEP-SnO2 indicate better crystallinity and fewer grain boundaries. Moreover, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images displayed in Fig. 2(c) and (d) suggest that the perovskite film on EMIM DEP-SnO2 has an average grain size of ca. 800 nm, larger than ca. 470 nm of the control perovskite. In a word, the presence of EMIM DEP leads to large perovskite grains and less PbI2 precipitation between perovskite crystals.37,38

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolution photoluminescence (TrPL) measurements were conducted to understand the dynamic of charge carrier transport at the SnO2/perovskite interface. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the PL peak intensity of the EMIM DEP-based sample is lower than that of the control one, indicating that the EMIM DEP-based sample shows faster PL quenching and thus higher electron extraction efficiency compared with its counterpart without EMIM DEP modification, which results in the improved VOC and FF. TrPL was used to quantify the carrier recombination process of the perovskite layer and perovskite-based interfaces as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). The curves can be fitted by using the quadratic exponential decay equation: It = A1exp(t/τ1) + A2exp(t/τ2)(2)where the fast decay lifetime, τ1, corresponds to charge carrier extraction from the perovskite to the surface, the slow decay lifetime, τ2, represents carrier recombination in the perovskite layer, and A1 and A2 are the related amplitudes. The fitted values are listed in Table S2.† Here, the TrPL measurement is based on the ITO/SnO2/perovskite structure, so τ1 represents the process of carrier extraction at the SnO2/perovskite interface. It is clear from Fig. 3(b) that the EMIM DEP-based sample has a smaller τ1 (i.e., 48 ns) than the control sample (i.e., 101 ns), suggesting that the introduction of EMIM DEP could facilitate electron extraction and collection, which brings a higher VOC. Moreover, the EMIM DEP-based sample also exhibits a longer carrier lifetime (i.e., τ2 of 1013 ns) compared to the control sample (i.e., τ2 of 643 ns), which is also a sign of higher crystallinity and better boundary passivation for the EMIM DEP-based perovskite. The conductivity of the SnO2 film was analyzed by using the current–voltage (I–V) curve under the Ag/SnO2/ITO structure as illustrated in Fig. 3(c), which reveals that EMIM DEP-SnO2 has a higher conductivity compared with SnO2 without EMIM DEP modification. The space charge-limited current (SCLC) technique with the ETL-only devices based on the structure of ITO/ETLs/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag was introduced to study the density of trap states inside the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3(d), with the increase of the bias voltage from 0 to 1 V, the current linearly increases with the ohmic correlation, and then increases nonlinearly, yielding a kink point that is defined as the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). If the defect traps are fulfilled, the trap density (Nt) can be calculated by using the following equation. Nt = 2ε0εVTFT/qL2(3)where q is the unit charge, Nt is the defect density, L is the thickness of the perovskite films, and ε0 and ε represent the vacuum dielectric constant and the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, respectively. For EMIM DEP-SnO2, the defect density of the perovskite film was significantly reduced from 3.66 × 1015 (control one) to 3.18 × 1015 cm−3, which should be attributed to the improved quality of the perovskite films and the contact with the SnO2/perovskite interface, and leads to the promotion of the VOC and FF.

To further explore the influence of EMIM DEP on the performance of PSCs, concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg mL−1 were deposited on the SnO2 substrates by spin-coating. The corresponding J–V curves of the PSCs are compared in Fig. S9,† which suggests that the best content is determined to be 1.0 mg mL−1. Therefore, the photoelectric properties of the SnO2 films and the related devices are further analyzed based on the 1.0 mg mL−1 EMIM DEP modification. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), the EMIM DEP-based device exhibits a champion PCE of 23.21% with a VOC of 1.17 V, a JSC of 24.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 81.91%, which is significantly higher than the 21.14% PCE of the control device with a VOC of 1.13 V, a JSC of 23.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 78.34%. The improved device performance mainly comes from the increased VOC and FF. The steady-state output (SPO) of the photocurrent of the devices was measured for 300 s at the MPP as shown in Fig. S10,† verifying the device reliability under continuous operation. As shown in the plots of the VOCversus the common logarithm of light intensity in Fig. 4(b), the slope can be proportional to the trap-assisted recombination of solar cells.39,40 The slope of the EMIM DEP-based device is deduced to be 1.27 kBT/q, lower than 1.34 kBT/q for the control device, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This means that defect-induced charge recombination is significantly reduced in the EMIM DEP-based device. The integrated current densities from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the SnO2 and SnO2/EMIM DEP-based devices are 22.13 and 23.10 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. S11.† There is no obvious difference in the transmittance spectra of various electronic transport layers in Fig. S1,† indicating that the EQE improvement is not from the light absorption of the EMIM DEP layer. According to the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in Fig. 4(c), the improvement of the integrated current from the EQE spectrum for the EMIM DEP-based device can be mainly attributed to the enhanced IQE response at 350–550 nm, due to the enhanced interface properties, especially, the improvement in carrier extraction and transport with the presence of EMIM DEP.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was used to further study the internal charge transfer behaviors in the two types of devices under short-circuit and one-sun illumination conditions.41 Under this condition, EIS can give information about the transport dynamics of photogenerated carriers from the perovskite layer. A single distinct semicircle (corresponding to a single RC element) followed by a straight line can be observed in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4(d)). The carrier transport behavior produces the classical spectral characteristic of a transmission line at a lower frequency, where the transport resistances (Rtr) are determined to be 341.60 and 481.60 Ω for the EMIM DEP-based and control devices, respectively (Table S3†). The EMIM DEP-based device also shows a smaller series resistance (Rs) compared to the control device, owing to the improved contact properties of the SnO2/perovskite interface together with improved perovskite crystal quality. Additionally, this arc represents the process where the accumulated carriers recombine at the defects. The recombination resistances (Rrec) of the EMIM DEP-based and control devices are 100.90 and 47.90 Ω, respectively. A smaller Rrec value for the EMIM DEP-based device means a lower charge recombination flux, indicating that EMIM DEP could effectively passivate the surface defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface as well as perovskite boundaries. Compared with the control devices, the EMIM DEP-based devices have a lower carrier transport resistance and a higher recombination resistance, leading to a higher carrier collection efficiency. The carrier transport properties of the related devices were also investigated by the transient photovoltage (TPV) and Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements. The EMIM DEP-based device exhibits a slightly longer carrier recombination lifetime than the control device, as shown in Fig. 4(e). Moreover, M–S analyzation shows a larger built-in potential (Vbi, 1.05 V) for the EMIM DEP-based device compared to 0.98 V of the control device in Fig. 4(f), providing an enhanced driving force to separate and transport the photogenerated carriers.30 To conclude, the EMIM DEP-based device presents a higher ability of charge carrier collection, which is beneficial to promote device performance.
The perovskite deposited on EMIM DEP-SnO2 shows better crystal quality and fewer surface defects, which is also beneficial to the device stability. Perovskites with pristine and EMIM DEP-modified SnO2 were placed in ambient air (70% ∼80% relative humidity and around 30 °C) for 48 h. As shown in Fig. S13,† the EMIM DEP-based perovskite has no obvious decomposition; however, there is obvious decomposition in the control perovskite. In the XRD pattern in Fig. 5(a), a new peak is located at 11.7° in the control samples, corresponding to the yellow phase (δ phase) non-perovskite.42 For the EMIM DEP-based sample, the XRD pattern of the perovskite phase has negligible change, indicating that EMIM DEP could improve the humidity stability of perovskite. As a result, the unencapsulated EMIM DEP-based devices could retains their original PCEs after storage for over 2000 h in a N2 glove box (Fig. S14†). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5(c), the unencapsulated EMIM DEP-based device retains 95% of its original PCE after storage for over 2000 h in 30 ± 5% RH ambient air, which is much better than the control device (retains 82% of the original PCE after 600 h). Furthermore, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) measurements were taken for the encapsulated cells under AM1.5 illumination in ambient air at 35 ± 5 °C. The EMIM DEP-base device retains 87% of its initial PCE after a 700 h MPPT test, while the control device retains 80% of its PCE after only 50 h, as shown in Fig. 5(d).

3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed an effective approach to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface by using an organic salt (EMIM DEP), which could significantly promote the efficiency and stability of the devices. Due to the enhanced electron extraction efficiency and surface defect passivation, the EMIM DEP-based PSCs can yield a hysteresis-free champion PCE of over 23%, and this device presents better stability for storage and operation under different conditions. These results demonstrate the great importance of interfacial properties of the ETL/perovskite on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs and also provide an easy and effective way for the realization of high-efficiency and stable devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Organic halide salts including FAI, PbI2, CsCl, and MAI (Advanced Election Technology), and organic halide BAI salt (Greatcell Solar Materials) were used to make perovskite precursors. The SnO2 colloid precursor (15 wt%) (Alfa Aesar) and Spiro-OMeTAD (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology) were used to fabricate the ETL and HTL, respectively. Chlorobenzene (CB), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were anhydrous and purchased from Aladdin. The pre-patterned ITO glass was acquired from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. The mask used for depositing metal electrodes was custom-made by Shenzhen Rigorous Technology Co., Ltd. All solutions were stirred at room temperature for 12 h and filtered with a 0.22 μm PTFE filter. All of the materials and reagents were used as received without further purification.
4.2 Device fabrication
The pre-patterned ITO glass was sequentially cleaned by ultrasonic cleaning in detergent, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min, respectively, followed by vacuum drying at 70 °C for 60 min to completely remove the residual ethanol and a treatment with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min to improve the surface wettability. A thin layer of the SnO2 film was then formed on the cleaned ITO glass via a spin-coating of SnO2 nanoparticles (3.75%, diluted by using deionized water with a volume ratio of 1:3) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, the samples were transferred into the nitrogen glove box to fabricate the EMIM DEP layer. The IPA solution with various concentrations of EMIM DEP (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg mL−1) was spin-coated to form the EMIM DEP layer. The perovskite layer was fabricated by a one-step film formation method. 163.4 mg FAI, 8.0 mg MAI, 8.4 mg CsCl, and 507.1 mg PbI2 were dissolved in a mixed solvent of an 800 μL DMF and 200 μL DMSO mixture to prepare a precursor solution. The precursor solution was stirred for at least 2 h and then filtered by using a 0.22 μm syringe filter for later use. Subsequently, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 1000 rpm for 8 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, and 300 μL antisolvent of ethyl acetate was dropped in the last 10th seconds. Then, the film was annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, the HTL Spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, which consisted of 73.5 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 25 μL tBP, 17 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile), and 8 μL FK 209 Co(III) TFSI (360 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile), and stirred overnight. Finally, 80 nm Ag was deposited on the top of a metal electrode using a metal thermal evaporation device with a mask (an effective area of 0.1 cm2).
4.3 Characterization
The FTIR test was used to characterize the chemical bonds in SnO2 with the modification of EMIM DEP (Thermo, Nicolet 6700, USA). The XPS and UPS tests were carried out by using an Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos, UK) with Al Kα radiation under ultra-high vacuum. KPFM (Vecco, Dimension 3100, USA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Vecco, Dimension 3100, USA) were used to characterize the film topographic morphology, surface potentials, letter of merit, and surface roughness. UV-vis spectroscopy (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950, USA) was used to measure the transmittance within the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. XRD (Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Germany) was used to characterize the crystal structure stability characterized with Cu Kα radiation. SEM (Hitachi, S4800, Japan) was used to check the surface information with the images taken at a 4 kV acceleration voltage. A fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba, FL3-111, France) was used to measure steady-state PL, based on a laser with 470 nm and an optical filter with 600 nm. The TrPL spectra were measured by using the fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba, FL3-111, France). The perovskite samples were encapsulated by quartz glass. The current–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out by using a Keysight B2901A source meter under simulated one-sun AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A, China) in ambient air without encapsulation. The active area of the devices in J–V measurement defined by an opaque mask is 0.10 cm2, respectively. The voltage was swept both in the forward scan (1.2 V to 0, step 0.01 V) and reverse scan (0 to 1.2 V, step 0.01 V). The SCLC measurements were carried out with the same equipment under dark conditions. A solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enlitech, QE-R3011, China) was used to measure the EQE and IQE spectra, in which the light intensity was calibrated by using a standard Si detector. The capacitor–voltage (C–V), TPV, and EIS tests were all conducted by using an electrochemical workstation (Gamry, CHI660, USA). For operational stability tests, the continuous power outputs of the encapsulated solar cells were through the Keithley 2400 source meter (Tektronix, USA) under a 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp without an additional optical filter at the maximum power point.
