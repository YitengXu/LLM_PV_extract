, Accepted 13th January 2016First published on 25th January 2016AbstractIn this work, we investigated the antibacterial activity of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles synthesised by a microwave assisted method. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultra-violet visible spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy. XRD patterns revealed preferentially oriented (101) TiO2 anatase phase, which changed to anatase–rutile mixed phase after Ba2+ doping. The vibrational spectra show significant shifts in the peaks with Ba addition, indicating the successful incorporation of Ba2+ ions into TiO2. The optical spectra revealed increase in band gap with Ba doping, thereby allowing the delay in recombination rate, favouring antibacterial activity. The surface morphology of TiO2 show spherical shaped grains with increased porosity after Ba doping. EDS analysis confirmed the phase-purity of the synthesized powders. The potential toxicity of nanosized TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 were investigated using both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as test organisms. The antibacterial activity was found to be higher for Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles compared to pure TiO2 nanoparticles, due to reduced particle size and high specific surface area leading to enhanced particle surface reactivity to light and H2O adsorption.
1. Introduction
Nanotechnology is an emerging interdisciplinary field involving nanoscience, nanomedicine, biology, and materials science. The ultimate objective of nanoscience and nanotechnology is to improve the quality of life and solve problems encountered in routine clinical practice, by developing new drugs, diagnostic agents, and novel drug delivery systems. Nanomaterials and devices form the basis for nanomedicine. Materials in the form of very small particle size, change significantly their physical and chemical properties, sometimes to the extent that completely new phenomena are established. Nanomaterials may also be used for special medical purposes such as to produce novel drug delivery systems, to enhance the performance of medical devices, or to produce diagnostic imaging materials. However, little is yet known about how the biological activity of certain material change as the size of the constituting particles decreases to nanoscale dimensions. Bactericidal metallic nanomaterials have attracted great attention in recent years due to their broad antimicrobial capabilities. Antibacterial activity is related to compounds that locally kill bacteria or slow down their growth, without being in general toxic to surrounding tissue. The antibacterial agents can be classified as either bactericidal, which kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic, slowing down bacterial growth. Antibacterial agents are vital to fight infectious diseases. However, the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibacterial drugs has become a common phenomenon, which is a major problem, with their broad use and abuse. Antibacterial agents can be broadly classified into two types, organic and inorganic.1 Inorganic antibacterial agents are often highly stable, particularly at high temperature and pressure compared to organic antibacterial materials. Photoactive metal oxides are extensively investigated for the killing or growth inhibition of bacteria when activated by UV and solar light. TiO2, ZnO, SrTiO3, CeO2, WO3, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, GaN, CdS, ZnS, CdS, ZnSe or more complex oxides, nitrides or chalcogenides can act as photoactive materials for redox processes due to their electronic structure, which is characterized by a filled valence band and an empty conduction band. Among these photoactive materials, titanium dioxide mediated systems proved to be excellent candidates as it fulfils all of these requirements and exhibits suitable conversion values. Antibacterial activity of the TiO2 nanoparticles is improved due to their high surface to volume ratio, resulting in the appearance of new mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical, magnetic, electro-optical, and magneto-optical properties of the nanoparticles that are different from their bulk properties.2 Naturally, TiO2 is presented in three different phases: anatase, rutile and brookite. Rutile and anatase crystallize in a tetragonal structure and brookite in an orthorhombic structure.3 Nanocrystalline titania (TiO2) has received significant attention in the last few decades due to the photo-induced electron transfer properties associated with the anatase metastable phase. Titania photokilling operation seems to decrease in the order virus > Gram-negative > Gram-positive > bacterial spores ≈ yeasts > fungus.4–6 However, upon insufficient illumination the antibacterial photo ability of TiO2 is inhibited. Hence, doping of TiO2 with transition metal, rare earth and noble metal ion have been investigated widely to reduce the particle size for better catalytic activity of TiO2 for antibacterial activity. However, studies on alkaline-earth metal ion doping of TiO2 and their photo properties have seldom been reported. Doping TiO2 with alkaline earth Ba modifies the optical absorption properties of the oxide, which inturn may influence the antibacterial activity. The Ba dopant may act as electron traps and inhibits the rate of recombination of e−/h+ pair by increasing the band-gap energy. This promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances the antibacterial activity. Mills and Hoffmann noted that doping a catalyst with a suitable material can enhance its photo-catalytic performance.7 Pure TiO2 and barium-doped TiO2 both in anatase and rutile forms are of considerable interests among the photoactive metal oxides. Here, as an alternative, we report a novel nanoparticulate composite Ba doped TiO2 nano powders which exhibit both anatase and rutile phases with improved antibacterial photo activity under visible light.
In order to prepare TiO2 nanostructured material with significant properties, various methods have been employed, such as sol–gel, solvothermal, hydrothermal, chemical vapour, homogeneous precipitation, RF thermal plasma and other routes such as laser ablation.8–19 In the present research, a novel microwave assisted method has been exploited for the synthesis of nanostructured TiO2, because in a liquid phase microwave irradiation, heating takes place majorly due to dipolar polarization and ionic conduction mechanisms. The reaction time is reduced by several orders of magnitude, because of molecular homogeneity, rapid heating rate, simultaneous heating and selective heating. Compared to conventional methods, microwave heating results in higher production efficiency, higher uniformity in product and better properties. Microwave heating causes the uniform distribution of temperature between the surface and the bulk material thereby leading to the fast formation of TiO2 nanoparticles. Also, the purity of the products obtained by this method is good, with fine microstructure, and better product performance. The product can be obtained in a very short period of 5 to 6 min compared to the conventional technique. Hence, in the present work, pure and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by microwave assisted method. The antibacterial activities of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles were tested under UV irradiation using the well diffusion method, and the degree of inhibition of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria treated with TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles was compared.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles
All the chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using 0.1 molar concentration titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP 97%, Aldrich) in deionised water. The reaction was performed with vigorous stirring for 1 h. The resulting solution was taken in an alumina crucible and the suspension was subjected to microwave irradiation for 6 min at a power of 400 W in a microwave oven in the temperature-controlled mode. The preparation process of pure and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The microwave system model MC8088NRH manufactured by LG Electronics Inc. India, can be operated under different mode, i.e. temperature-controlled and pressure controlled mode. The system uses non-pulsed microwave to heat the samples continuously, and the microwave power can be adjusted by automatic frequency conversion with the variation of temperature. The maximum microwave frequency was 2450 MHz and power was 1350 W, and can be controlled continuously at different power ranges, according to the selected temperature. The resultant colloidal solution was filtered, to collect the powder product. The obtained powder samples were further annealed for 2 h in a muffle furnace at 500 °C in air ambient to remove the surfactant and other organic by products of the irradiation induced chemical reaction. In a similar procedure, Ba doped TiO2 nano-powder was synthesized using barium chloride (BaCl2 99%, Merck), TTIP and water. The obtained nano powder was further used to investigate the structural, compositional, vibrational, optical and antibacterial activity. The structural characterization was done using X pert Pro X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Vibrational spectral analysis was done using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. The optical analysis of nanoparticles was investigated using ultra violet (UV)-visible spectrophotometer. The micrographs of the powders were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The size distribution of nanoparticles was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS).

2.2. Bacterial sensibility test of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2
To determine the ability of the synthesised nanoparticles as a potential antibacterial agent, the pure and Ba doped TiO2 samples and a multidrug resistance strains were tested against both Gram positive (B. subtilis) and Gram negative bacteria (V. cholera and P. aeruginosa, S. flexneri) using well diffusion method.20 Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the preparation process of discs for measuring the zone of inhibition of the nanoparticles by well diffusion method. The bacterial inoculum was uniformly spread using sterile cotton swab on a sterile Petri dish containing nutrient agar media. After inoculation, discs loaded with 2 mg of the test samples were placed on the bacteria seeded plates using sterile forceps. Petri plates containing 20 ml nutrient agar medium were seeded with 24 h bacterial culture. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacterial growth and difference in zone of inhibition of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles against the test samples were determined. The experiments were repeated for different Ba concentration to check the toxic effect of Ba. No significant difference in cell viability at each time point was displaced for dopant concentration up to 2%. Above 2%, a mild injury was seen in the cells. Hence, the Ba dopant concentration in TiO2 was optimized at 2%. The sizes of inhibitory zones (including the diameter of disk) on the agar surface around the disks were measured to know the sensitivities of the microorganism species to the pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of Ba doping on the crystallite size and phase of TiO2 nanoparticles
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles is shown in the Fig. 3. The XRD peaks are located at angles (2θ) of 25.31°, 38.63°, 48.08°, 53.916°, 55.06° and 62.82° corresponding to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) planes of the TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The observed diffraction peaks reveal the tetragonal crystal structure of TiO2. Calculated lattice parameter (a = b = 3.8 Å and c = 9.41 Å) and the diffraction peaks matches well with standard XRD pattern of TiO2 (JCPDS card number: 21-1272). No characteristic peaks associated with other crystalline forms were detected in the XRD pattern, indicating the anatase phase-pure nature of the product. Anatase TiO2 crystals are usually dominated by (101) facets, which are thermodynamically stable.21 In the XRD pattern of Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles, three additional peaks were found at 30.60°, 36.08° and 42.37°, which corresponds to (110), (101) and (200) plane, respectively. The diffraction peaks matches well with standard XRD pattern of nano Ba doped TiO2 powder as tetragonal and space group P4mm (JCPDS card no. 31-0174). It was observed that the reflection peaks of TiO2 become shaper after doping with Ba of higher ionic radii, which indicates the enhancement in crystalline nature of the sample. In addition, the strain of Ba doped TiO2 cannot be replaced with some ions of Ti having the ionic radius of 0.68 Å due to the higher ionic radii of Ba2+. This resulted in the formation of Ba doped TiO2 with both anatase and rutile phases which appear in the XRD patterns of Ba doped TiO2 samples. Xiao Q. et al.22 previously reported that the mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles exhibits greater photo activity than do pure anatase or pure rutile TiO2 nanoparticles under excitation by UV light. It was also observed that the peak position of TiO2 (101) diffraction shifts to lower angles after Ba addition, which indicates the increase of the lattice parameters, due to the successful incorporation of Ba2+ ion into TiO2 lattice. Definite line broadening of the XRD peaks is an indication that the synthesized materials are in nanometer range.23 The crystalline size of synthesized pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticle was calculated using Debye–Scherrer's formula.24 
D = 0.9λ/βcosθ
(1)where λ = 0.15405 nm is the X-ray wavelength, β is the peak width of half maximum and θ is the Bragg's diffraction angle. The average crystallite sizes were found to be 8–18 nm for pure TiO2, which decreased significantly to 4–10 nm for Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticle, dependent on the increasing broadening of peaks with doping. Abdulrahman Syedahamed Haja Hameed et al.25 has reported that Ba doping with metal oxide reduces the crystallite size of the particle. It was also observed that the intensity of (101) diffraction peak of TiO2 decreased and the width broadened, which might be due to the increase in the lattice disorder and strain induced by Ba2+ substitution. J. El Ghoul et al.26 also reported the broadening of peaks due to increase in lattice distortion. The narrow size distribution of nanoparticles obtained in the present case was possible because of microwave irradiation which accelerates the hydrolysis process, leading to the formation of small individual TiO2 nanoparticles. Microwave irradiation provides the titanium cations and hydroxide anions by hydration of TTIP. The Ti cations reacts readily with hydroxide anions to form stable Ti(OH)42− complexes, this resulted in the growth of TiO2 nanostructure. The mechanism of the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles can be described using the following reaction.27 
Ti(OR)4 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)42− + 4ROH
(2) 
Ti(OH)42− → TiO + H2O + 2OH−
(3)

Thus microwave processing results in the formation of titanium dioxide complexes. Hence, when Ba ions were doped into the TiO2 lattice, the size of anatase crystallite decreased from 18 to 4 nm, which inturn increase the surface area of TiO2 favouring antibacterial activity. The small particle size of nanoparticles may have different chemical, magnetic, optical and structural features, so they may have more differential toxicity profiles than normal-sized TiO2. Thus, the size of the particles play a crucial role in the antibacterial activity of TiO2 with Ba doping.28
3.2. Effect of Ba doping on the vibrational bands of TiO2 nanoparticles
To investigate the change in chemical bonding states in the pure and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles, FTIR spectrum was recorded. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of pure and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by microwave irradiation. The spectra shows the appearance of many absorption bands belonging to the organic groups such as OH and alkane. The high intensity absorption peaks from the vibration of hydroxyl group at 3400 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 can be assigned to the O–H stretching vibrations due to the absorbed water on the surface of the samples. The broad and strong band situated in the range 3418–3721 cm−1 can be attributed to stretching hydroxyl (O–H). The band in the range 2926–2968 cm−1 was attributed to the C–H stretching vibrations. The strong peak at 1591–1626 cm−1 can be due to a CO stretching in carboxyl or amide groups. The band at 1350–1370 cm−1 was assigned to the CO (saturated aldehyde) stretching vibration. The strong absorption band in the range of 400–950 cm−1 was assigned to the Ti–O bonding which indicates the formation of titanium oxide. The adsorption region spreading over 950–400 cm−1 is also characteristic of oscillation of M–O bonds (where M = Ba and Ti). The strong absorption stretches at 952 cm−1 and 773 cm−1 belongs to the anatase and rutile TiO2 phase. The broad intense band below 1200 cm−1 can be assigned Ti–O–Ti vibration. The shift in the peak position indicates that the Ba2+ ion was successfully doped into the TiO2 matrix. The results also confirmed that Ba ions were occupying in the TiO2 matrix as observed in XRD measurement.

3.3. Effect of Ba doping on the optical transmission and band gap of TiO2 nanoparticles
It is well-known that, the optical properties of TiO2 depend strongly on the type of material (e.g., single crystal, powder) and the synthesis conditions. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles recorded in the wavelength region 350–800 nm. The spectrum of TiO2 shows the absorption peaks at 330–400 nm corresponding to the tetrahedral and octahedral coordinate Ti species, respectively.29,30 It was observed that the position of absorption edge shifts towards lower wavelength side, indicating an increase in the band gap with Ba doping due to decrease in particle size. The blue shift in absorption edge was attributed to the Burstein–Moss effect,31,32 which leads to the motion of Fermi level towards conduction band due to an increase in electron concentrations from Ba dopant. Normally, Fermi level is located at the centre of the band gap. Since the shifting of Fermi level depends on the type of semiconductor, doping of TiO2 with n-type Ba ions increases the conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor by adding electron energy levels near the conduction band. Hence, the excited electron in these energy levels can be easily moved into the conduction band. It was also observed that the absorption edges of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 are at 415 nm and 400 nm, respectively. From these results it can be predicted that TiO2 nanoparticles may exhibit quantum confinement effect though the exciton Bohr radius of TiO2 is just ∼1 nm. The optical band gap of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles were evaluated by assuming the direct transition between conduction and valance band using the following equation.33 
α = A(hν − Eg)n/hν
(4)where A is the constant, Eg is the energy gap, ν is the frequency of the incident radiation and h is Planck's constant, n depends on the nature of the transitions, n may have values 1/2, 2, 3/2 and 3 corresponding to allowed direct, allowed indirect, forbidden direct and forbidden indirect transitions, respectively. In this case n = 1/2 for direct allowed transition. The band gap energy (Eg) was estimated by Tauc plot of hν versus (αhν)2 for pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 6 shows the Tauc plot of hν versus (αhν)2 for pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nano particles. Band gap energy of pure TiO2 was found to be 3.17 eV which increased to 3.23 eV for Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Y. Gülen et al.34 has also reported the widening of TiO2 band gap with Ba dopant. The donor Ba atoms provide additional carriers that causes the shifting of Fermi level towards conduction band and therefore, band gap becomes larger.

The optical transmission spectra of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 7. Pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit good transmittance in the visible region. A high transmittance of about 85% was obtained for pure TiO2 nanoparticles; however, it improved after Ba doping. This was attributed to the reason that Ba atoms may occupy interstitial position in the TiO2 lattice which causes light scattering. Generally, the transmittance increase sharply in the UV region due to the fundamental absorption. On the other hand, the transmittance of our nanoparticles increase with Ba doping. K. C. Preetha et al.35 and B. Sahin et al.36 also reported the increase in transmittance with increase in band gap of semiconductor. These results suggest that, doping of barium ions facilitate the light absorption capacity of TiO2, which is favourable for better antibacterial activity.

3.4. Effect of Ba doping on the morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles
The morphologies of the pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles were investigated using scanning electron microscope as shown in Fig. 8. The SEM investigations of the pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 samples reveal that the crystallites are in nanometre size. The samples show spherical shaped grains of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nano clusters. The nanoparticles are more in the dispersed phase because the nanopowders were calcined at high temperature of 500 °C for 2 h and hence, homogenous distributions of particles with closely packed spherical grains were observed. The grain size of TiO2 decreased with Ba doping in the synthesis process, which is most likely due to the aggregate of nanoparticles in to nano clusters. Actually, a small fraction of hierarchical nanostructures were obtained. The figures clearly indicated a significant change in the growth of pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 crystal. Fig. 8(a) shows the spherical shaped nanoparticles of small grain size 35 nm which belongs to pure TiO2 sample, while, after doping Ba ions, shape of the particle remain unchanged but size of the particles reduced to 15 nm with increased porosity. The porous structure and specific surface area enhance the antibacterial activity of Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles due to the increased reactive sites and ease of mass transfer.37 Dynamic light scattering analysis was performed to determine the size distribution of the nanoparticles. DLS conducted on TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles show average diameter of 43 nm and 20 nm, respectively, which is in agreement with the SEM data. This significant change in the size, crystallinity, porosity, surface chemistry and capping agent of nanoparticles is likely to play a major role in the antibacterial effect of TiO2.38–40

The elemental composition analysis of the calcined TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles were characterised by EDX (chemical microanalysis technique) to know the concentration of dopant and the defects. Fig. 9 shows the EDX spectra of pure and Ba doped TiO2 nanopowders synthesized by microwave processing. The chemical composition of Ti and O element alone present in the nanopowder confirms the absence of any other impurities in the pure TiO2 nanoparticle. Likewise, Ba doped TiO2 shows the presence of Ba, Ti and O element alone in the nanopowder. In Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles, titanium percentage decreased whereas oxygen percentage increased. But in the TiO2 nanoparticles doped with Ba having higher ionic radius, the composition of Ti and O were estimated as 27.11% and 71.22%, respectively. As compared to the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, a reverse trend in the chemical composition was observed for the barium doped TiO2 nanoparticles due to the effect of higher ionic radius Ba2+ metal ions.

3.5. Effect of Ba doping on the antibacterial activity of TiO2 nanoparticles
The generation of the reactive oxygen species from the TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles induced by UV light is shown in the Fig. 10. The radical's generation (˙OH and ˙O2−) in TiO2, and the mechanism behind the antibacterial activity of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles is described using the following equations.41 
TiO2 + hν → TiO2 (e−) + TiO2 (h+) (photo generated electrons and holes)
(5) 
TiO2 (h+) + H2O → TiO2 + ˙OH− + H+ (oxidation of water by holes)
(6) 
TiO2 (h+) + OH− → TiO2 + OH (production of hydroxyl radical)
(7) 
TiO2 (e−) + O2 → TiO2 + O2− (generation of reactive oxygen)
(8) 
O2− + H+ → HO2 (generation of hydrogen dioxide radical)
(9) 
2HO2˙ → O2 + H2O2 (production of H2O2)
(10)

The pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 sterilized by the ultraviolet irradiation produce photo generated holes (h+) which could react with H2O. The high oxidative holes then split the H2O molecule from the suspension of TiO2 with strong oxidization ability forming hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and free radical (O2−).42 The OH− and super oxide O2− active groups can interact with nucleic acid and bacterial cell wall which damage the structures of the molecule.43,44 The schematic representation of the interaction of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles with the cell wall and DNA are shown in Fig. 11. The reactive oxygen generated by TiO2 could increase lipid per oxidation and lactate dehydrogenase, causing the damage to DNA and lead to cell death.45 In the case of Ba doped TiO2, more hydroxyl radicals are produced, since Ba2+ ion activated H2O2 after penetrating the cell wall. 
Ba2+ + H2O2 → Ba3+ + ˙OH + OH−
(11) 
Ba3+ + TiO2 (e−) → Ba2+
(12) 
Ba3+ + ˙O2− → Ba2+ + O2
(13)
 Fig. 11  The mechanism of the generation of reactive oxygen species from TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles induced by UV light. 
Since the size of TiO2 particles got reduced with Ba incorporation, the surface area of TiO2 increased which would make the surface more active to UV light and H2O adsorption.
The noticeable difference in the zone of inhibition was observed for pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles introduced in the Gram positive (V. cholera, P. aeruginosa and S. flexneri) and Gram negative (B. subtilis) discs. The zone of inhibition around each disc loaded with test samples shows the antibacterial activity. Fig. 12 shows the zone of inhibition in discs loaded with pure TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles. It was observed that the Gram negative bacteria (V. cholera, P. aeruginosa and S. flexneri) treated with TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit 8 mm zone of inhibition, while it was almost nil in the case of Gram positive bacteria (B. subtilis). The cell wall of bacteria maintains its characteristic cell shape and its osmotic pressure. Since the Gram positive bacteria possess multi-layered peptidoglycan with one cytoplasmic membrane, its cell wall is thick. However, in Gram negative bacteria the cell wall is composed of only two cell membranes with thin peptidoglycan layer. Hence, the TiO2 nanoparticles easily penetrate into the cell wall in this case and can readily damage the cell. In the case of Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles, the zone of inhibition is 11–13 mm for Gram negative bacteria, while it is only 10 mm for Gram positive bacteria. The results also reveal that the Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles shows maximum zone of inhibition for Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria compared with that of pure TiO2. It is observed that the zones of inhibition is clean, inside an open circle around the disc with distinct variations in the susceptibility of bacteria towards Ba doped TiO2. D. S. Kim et al.46 reported that smaller crystallite size of nano-doped-TiO2 induced a larger band gap due to the increased redox ability. The enhancement in the antibacterial activity in Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles is due to the increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of Ba3+ ions and TiO2 in the presence of UV light.47 Since, Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit both anatase and rutile phase as revealed from the XRD studies, they show enhanced ability to produce photo generated holes (h+), resulting in stronger antibacterial effect than single anatase TiO2. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and organic hydro peroxides (OHPs) are toxic to the cells as they damage cellular constituents such as DNA, lipids, and proteins.48 It is also worth to notice that Ba nanoparticles can cause bacterial penetration through interaction with sulphur containing proteins at the bacterial membrane and the phosphorus containing compound like DNA, finally leading to cell death by attacking respiratory chain.49,50 Ba nanoparticles release Ba3+ ions which enhance their bactericidal activity by converting DNA from relaxed state into its condensed form, and thereby preventing its replication which would lead to cell death. Hence, the inhibition is maximum, even when compared to multi drug resistance which shows only 8–9 mm inhibition in Gram positive bacteria and is nil around Gram negative bacteria. The introduction of barium into TiO2 matrix led to increase in reduction number of viable bacteria. Barium ions interact with thiol groups in proteins, resulting in inactivation of respiratory enzymes and leading to the production of more reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increased band gap energy revealed from absorption study might be the reason behind our result showing enhanced cytotoxic and oxidation response of Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles in cells. Several researchers reported the ROS generation of metal oxide nanoparticles, but the novelty in the present research is that the band gap behaviour of TiO2 nanoparticles played a major role in the ROS mediated toxicity. It is also suggested that the porous Ba stimulated a large amount of oxygen atoms to be adsorbed onto TiO2 surface, generating more ROS in the suspension resulting in intense oxidative stress towards the bacteria, thereby enhancing the antibacterial response. On the other hand, particle size of TiO2 plays an important role in the antibacterial activity. TiO2 nanoparticles of smaller size can easily penetrate into bacterial membranes due to their large interfacial area, thus enhancing their antibacterial efficiency. During the generation of ROS, the unsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane will be oxidized by ˙OH group, and affect the fluidity of cell membrane. Consequently, the thickness of cell wall decrease, and the death of cells occurs as a normal and controlled part of the organism's growth.51,52 The interactions between TiO2 nanoparticles and bacteria would eventually lead to cell death with generation of reactive oxidation group under UV light excitation. Thus, the generation of oxidative stress towards bacteria under UV light irradiation of TiO2 has contributed to their antibacterial effect and nanotoxicity.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we report the antimicrobial properties of TiO2 and Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by microwave assisted method. The characterization results revealed that the structural, morphological, optical and antibacterial properties of the TiO2 nanoparticles vary significantly with Ba doping. XRD pattern of the samples reveal the shifting of diffraction peaks with reduction in crystal size after Ba doping. Elemental analysis of the samples confirmed the amount of Ba doped into TiO2, and further analysis by FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of peaks related to Ti–O–Ti bonding. The shorter wavelength absorption in the UV region and the widening of TiO2 band gap with Ba addition favours antibacterial activity. SEM analysis demonstrated the formation of porous TiO2 nanospheres with decreased particle size after Ba addition. DLS measurements confirmed the size distribution of the nanoparticles. Due to strong interaction between Ba and TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2/Ba hybrid nanoclusters showed viable cell reduction for both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The improved cytotoxic response of Ba doped TiO2 nanoparticles was related to widening of band gap energy that increased their ability to induce ROS generation. The studies also confirmed that the small particle size and large surface area of Ba doped TiO2 also contributed to enhance the bactericidal response. Overall, the synthesized Ba doped TiO2 nanospheres have been demonstrated to be effective in bactericidal applications and presents a reasonable alternative for the development of new bactericides.
