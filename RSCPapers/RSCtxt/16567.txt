    , Accepted 22nd March 2022First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractFor the realization of highly efficient and thermally stable polymer solar cells (PSCs), we develop a new series of polymer donors (PDs) containing carbazole (Cz)-based units, N-dodecyl-carbazole[3,4-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (CBT). The coplanar penta-fused-ring structures of the CBT units coupled with π-conjugated bridges (thiophene (T) or thienothiophene (TT)) exhibit highly planar PD conformations that are non-covalently locked by secondary interactions. As a result, the series of PDs (i.e., P1, P2, and P3) exhibit superior electrical and photovoltaic properties. In particular, the TT–π-bridged PDs, P2 and P3, achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 13.17 and 14.58% when paired with Y6 acceptor, respectively, which outperform the T–π-bridged PD, P1 (10.78%). This result is attributed to the compact intermolecular packing, enhanced crystallinity, and extended conjugation of the PDs featuring TT. Furthermore, an even higher PCE of 15.54% is achieved by a P3-based ternary (P3:Y6:PC71BM) blend system. This PCE represents the highest among the PCEs of previously reported PSCs featuring Cz-based PDs. In addition, the P3:Y6 blend shows excellent thermal stability by maintaining 90% of its initial PCE after 144 h at 120 °C. Therefore, this study provides important molecular design rules for developing Cz-based PDs and realizing high-performance and thermally stable PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been spotlighted as promising energy sources for soft/wearable electronics owing to their flexibility, light weight, and solution processability.1–4 Over the last few years, the advent of various non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSMAs) and polymer acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs to over 18%.5–17 Developing new polymer donors (PDs) to complement these NFSMAs or, preferably, designing both optimized PDs and NFSMAs, is necessary for the further improvement of the PCE and operational stability of PSCs. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based PDs have been extensively used in NFSMA-based PSCs because their light-absorption bands complement those of NFSMAs and the PSCs exhibit reduced voltage loss.18,19 Nevertheless, paired with NFSMAs, only few BDT-based PDs afford PSCs with superior PCEs.18,20–25 In addition, device stability under thermal, light, and mechanical stresses is considered the most crucial requirement for the commercialization of PSCs. However, PSCs composed of BDT-based PDs and NFSMAs typically suffer from poor thermal- and photo-stability, partly due to the relatively amorphous nature and low glass transition temperature (Tg) of BDT-based PDs.3,19 Therefore, it is necessary to develop new backbone units which can be coupled with BDT to realize PDs that can enhance the device performance and stability.
Carbazole (Cz)-based derivatives are promising building blocks because of their advantageous structural properties, including high thermal/chemical stabilities and facile backbone functionalization/side-chain engineering.26–33 Despite these advantages, Cz-based PDs have not been extensively explored, featuring in only a few reports on PSCs incorporating fullerene-based acceptors. For instance, Leclerc et al. developed the first Cz-based PD (PCDTBT) and reported a PCE of 3.6% with a fullerene-based acceptor.30 Later, the PCE of the PCDTBT-based PSCs was increased to 7.5% when paired with PC71BM.32 Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, Cz-based PDs have not previously been paired with any NFSMAs. We speculate that this is mainly because of insufficient electron-accepting nature of the Cz unit,28,31 which limits efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and the push–pull effect when coupled with other efficient electron-donating units in the PD backbone.
The Cz unit has the advantage of being converted into an electron-accepting unit by appropriate structural modification. One good strategy is to introduce additional fused rings, which have highly electron-deficient properties, into the benzene part of the Cz unit. For example, Chen et al. synthesized a Cz-based unit, N-dodecyl-carbazole[3,4-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (CBT), by incorporating two thiadiazole (Tz) groups into Cz.34 The two electron-deficient Tz groups afforded the electron-accepting ability into Cz. However, PDs incorporating CBT units produced PSCs with a low PCE of 1–2%, presumably due to considerable steric hindrance along the backbone caused by the bulky CBT unit.35–37
In this regard, the interposition of a simple π-conjugated spacer such as thiophene or selenophene between CBT units can serve as an effective solution.38–43 These π-conjugated spacers (or bridges) increase the molecular planarity of the PD by alleviating steric hindrance (or torsional strain) within its backbone while extending conjugation; the resulting structure is strongly stabilized by quinoidal resonance, which improves ICT and intermolecular interactions.39 For example, Hwang et al. reported that the interposition of π-conjugated bridges can enhance the planarity of PD backbones, thus improving the crystallinity and hole mobility of the PDs.40 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of interposing π-conjugated bridges between the CBT units on the molecular conformations and electrical properties of Cz-based PDs, as well as the resulting photovoltaic performance.
Herein, we develop a series of Cz-based PDs (P1, P2, and P3) comprising CBT and BDT units with different π-conjugated bridges and side-chains. Thiophene (T) and thienothiophene (TT), serving as π-conjugated bridges, are adopted to enhance the planarity of the Cz-based backbone and extend π-conjugation. These π-conjugated bridges participate in non-covalent interactions (i.e., N⋯H and S⋯H) with adjacent Tz units, enhancing the hole mobility of the Cz-based PDs by non-covalently locking their conformations.44–46 In addition, the CBT units are functionalized with alkyl side-chains of different lengths, 2-hexyldecyl (–HD) and 2-decyltetradecyl (–DT), to evaluate their effect on the crystallinity and solubility of Cz-based PDs. It is found that the P2 and P3 PDs with TT–π-bridges are more planar than P1 with T–π-bridges and exhibit enhanced absorption, crystallinity, and hole mobility. When these PDs are paired with a highly efficient NFSMA, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6),17 P3 achieves the highest PCE (14.58%) and fill factor (FF; 0.71) among the PD series, significantly outperforming a P1:Y6 PSC (PCE = 10.78%). It is also noteworthy that a P3-based ternary (P3:Y6:PC71BM) blend system achieves an even higher PCE of 15.54%, which, to date, is the best performance by a PSC featuring a Cz-based PD. Moreover, the P3:Y6 PSC exhibits excellent thermal stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE after thermal annealing at 120 °C for 144 h.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material properties
Electron-accepting, CBT units were designed and utilized as the counterpart of BDT to improve the crystallinity of relatively amorphous BDT-based PDs (Fig. 1). Although several attempts have been made to utilize the CBT units in D–A alternating PDs to enhance ICT, the performances of PSCs based on these Cz-based PDs remained very low (PCE ∼ 2%), presumably due to considerable steric hindrance along the backbone caused by the bulky CBT unit (Fig. 1a).35 Thus, we interposed π-conjugated bridges between CBT units to extend conjugation and enable the PD to adopt a more planar conformation (Fig. 1b). Especially, we utilized T and TT units as the π-conjugated spacers (bridges) for inducing conformational locks and good planarity via non-covalent interactions (N⋯H and S⋯H), which are beneficial for efficient charge transport.45 Moreover, to further modulate the properties (i.e., energy level, solubility, and crystalline properties) of Cz-based PDs, side-chain engineering was conducted at the nitrogen atom on the CBT units.47,48 To maximize the light absorption ability and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs, we employed a chlorinated BDT (BDTT-Cl) unit as the donating unit; this donating unit functionalized with Cl can induce a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level than similar units featuring other functional groups (i.e., –H, –CH3, or –F).49,50 The obtained PDs are denoted by P1 (CBT-T unit with DT side-chains), P2 (CBT-TT unit with HD side-chains), and P3 (CBT-TT unit with DT side-chains). The synthetic routes for these PDs are detailed in the Experimental section (Scheme S1 and Fig. S1–S9†). A representative NFSMA, Y6, was used as the acceptor (Fig. 2a); the light-absorption bands of Y6 and the Cz-based PDs are complementary and their energy levels align appropriately (Fig. 2b and c). The molecular weights and optical/electrochemical characteristics of the materials are provided in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) of the designed PDs were similar, ranging from 41 to 54 kg mol−1; consequently, the effect of Mn on performance can be disregarded. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and calculated by the relation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, respectively (Fig. 2b and S10†). The HOMO/LUMO levels of the Cz-based PDs and Y6 were estimated to be −5.61/−3.86 (P1), −5.59/−3.72 (P2), −5.58/−3.70 (P3), and −5.63/−4.27 eV (Y6). The HOMO/LUMO levels of the Cz-based PDs align well with those of Y6, enabling effective charge-carrier dissociation/generation.51,52 In Fig. S11,† the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the PDs featuring TT (P2 and P3) are blue-shifted relative to that of the PD featuring T (P1), which might be related to differences in the ICT ability of the PDs depending on the π-bridge type.53 The spectra of all the PDs show distinct shoulders near their absorbance maxima, which indicate good intermolecular π–π stacking of the PDs.54,55 The maximum absorption coefficients (εfilm) were increased from 6.5 × 104 (P1) to 7.3 × 104 (P2), and to 7.8 × 104 cm−1 (P3) (Fig. 2c and Table 1). This result indicates that the TT–π-bridged PDs can harvest photons more effectively, resulting in higher short-circuit current densities (Jscs) than the T–π-bridged counterpart. We estimated the polymer solubilities in various solvents including chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Fig. S12†).56 All the polymers showed good solubilities (>15 mg mL−1) in CF and CB. However, in THF, the TT–π-bridged P2 and P3 polymers with rigid backbones exhibited lower solubilities (∼10 mg mL−1) than that of the T–π-bridged P1 polymer (∼15 mg mL−1). The thermal property of the PDs was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal decomposition temperatures of the three PDs were 379 (P1), 415 (P2), and 424 °C (P3), respectively (Fig. S13†). Thus, the TT–π-bridged PDs showed higher decomposition temperatures than that of the T–π-bridged PD. Melting or crystallization peaks were not detected in the DSC curves of the PDs (Fig. S14†).

To examine the effect of conjugation length on the molecular conformations and torsional profiles of the PDs, density functional theory (DFT) analysis was conducted at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. S15†).57,58 The calculations were simplified by substituting all the alkyl side-chains with methyl groups and using the dimer forms of the PDs. All the PDs exhibited highly planar structures, as shown in the side views of models based on the results of the DFT analysis; this can be ascribed to secondary interactions between the π-conjugated bridges and CBT units that conformationally lock the PDs. However, the different π-conjugated bridges, T and TT, led to dissimilar curvatures of the backbone as shown in the top views of the models; the backbones of the TT–π-bridged PDs were linear, while that of the T–π-bridged PD was more curved. The different molecular conformations can affect interchain packing of PD.59,60
To examine the effect of the molecular conformation of Cz-based PDs on their microstructures in thin films, grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurement was conducted. The 2D GIXS patterns and their line-cut profiles along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions of the pristine Cz-based PD films are presented in Fig. 3a–c. Interestingly, the molecular orientations of the PDs were distinctly different depending on the type of π-bridges. The T–π-bridged P1 film exhibited an edge-on orientation as proved by the distinct (010)IP π–π stacking and (100)OOP lamellar stacking peaks. In contrast, the TT–π-bridged P2 and P3 films showed preferential face-on orientations as confirmed by the (010)OOP peaks and the (100)IP peaks. In PSCs, these face-on oriented PDs are known to be highly advantageous for effective charge transport along the vertical direction of the device.61 To compare the crystallinity of the films, we calculated their crystal coherence lengths (Lcs) from the (010)OOP and (100)IP peaks in their line-cut profiles using the Scherrer equation (Table S1†).62 With respect to the (010)OOP peaks, the Lc values were increased from 1.02 nm (P1) to 1.83 nm (P2), and to 1.93 nm (P3). Similarly, with respect to the (100)IP peaks, the TT–π-bridged P2 and P3 films exhibited higher Lc values of 4.51 and 5.57 nm, respectively, than P1. These results indicate that the TT–π-bridged PDs with linear and planar molecular conformations are more crystalline than the T–π-bridged PD with a curved backbone. To confirm the difference in crystallinity, we estimated the hole mobility (μSCLCh) of the PDs through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) methods (Table S2 and Fig. S16†).63 Owing to the highly planar backbones and favorable face-on orientation, the TT–π-bridged P2 and P3 exhibited enhanced μSCLChs (P2 = 1.65 × 10−4 and P3 = 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), while P1 showed a relatively low value (8.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).

2.2. Photovoltaic properties
To assess the photovoltaic performances of PX:Y6 (X = 1, 2, and 3) blends, we fabricated PSCs based on a normal-type device configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PX (X = 1, 2, and 3):Y6/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide (PNDIT-F3N-Br)/Ag.64 The fabrication processes and characterizations are provided in the Experimental section (ESI†). The PCE trends of the PSCs and the overall optimization process of the P3:Y6 PSC are summarized in Tables 2 and S3,† respectively. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and PCE distributions of each PSC system are presented in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. As a result, the PSCs incorporating P2 and P3 PDs (featuring TT) achieved high PCEs of 13.17 and 14.58%, respectively, outperforming the PSC incorporating the P1 PD (featuring T) (PCE = 10.78%). It is worth noting that these PCEs are the highest achieved by PSCs based on Cz-based PDs. All the photovoltaic properties (i.e., Voc, Jsc, and FF) increased from P1:Y6 to P2:Y6, and to P3:Y6 blends. Interestingly, despite the relatively up-shifted HOMO levels of P2 and P3 than P1, the Vocs of P2:Y6 (0.837 V) and P3:Y6 (0.833 V) PSCs exceeded that of the P1:Y6 PSC (0.812 V). The reason for this Voc tendency is described in the section below. Similarly, the Jsc value was enhanced from 22.19 (P1:Y6) to 24.08 (P2:Y6), and to 24.66 mA cm−2 (P3:Y6), and the FF value was also significantly increased from 0.60 (P1:Y6) to 0.65 (P2:Y6), and to 0.71 (P3:Y6). The calculated Jsc of each PSC, based on its external quantum efficiency (EQE), was consistent with its measured Jsc within a 4% margin of error (Fig. 4c). In particular, the TT–π-bridged P2:Y6 and P3:Y6 blends exhibited higher EQE values than P1:Y6 in the wavelength range of 340–900 nm.

2.3. Voltage loss analysis
Voltage loss (Vloss) analyses were conducted to investigate the differences in the Vocs of the PSCs. Vloss can be divided into three components by Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory:65Vloss = (EPVg/q − VSQoc) + (VSQoc − Vradoc) + (Vradoc − VPVoc) = ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3, where EPVg, VSQoc, Vradoc, VPVoc, and q are the photovoltaic bandgap, maximum voltage at the SQ limit, voltage at the radiative limit, photovoltaic Voc, and elementary charge, respectively. Unlike the first two terms, ΔV1 and ΔV2, which relate to radiative recombination, the third term, ΔV3, relates to non-radiative Vloss. Minimizing ΔV3 is essential for achieving efficient PSCs.66–71 The ΔV3 terms of the PSCs can be determined from the equation ΔV3 = Vloss − ΔV1 − ΔV2 or from their electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) spectra, which show similar values (Table S4†).72 The detailed calculation of each term is provided in the Experimental section and in Fig. S17–S19.† The overall Vloss and corresponding Vloss terms (ΔV1, ΔV2, and ΔV3) of each PSC are listed in Table 3. The differences in the ΔV1 and ΔV2 terms of the three PSCs were not significant. In contrast, meaningful differences in the ΔV3 values were observed between the T–π-bridged and TT–π-bridged PDs. For example, the ΔV3 and Vloss terms of the P2:Y6 (ΔV3 = 0.310, Vloss = 0.575) and P3:Y6 (ΔV3 = 0.308, Vloss = 0.580) PSCs were similar, whereas those of the P1:Y6 PSC were comparatively high (ΔV3 = 0.331, Vloss = 0.603). This result indicates that owing to their extended conjugation and linear molecular conformation, the TT–π-bridged PDs effectively suppress non-radiative Vloss in the blend with the Y6 acceptor. As a result, the Voc values of the P2- and P3-based PSCs surpassed that of P1:Y6, despite the relatively small energy gaps between the HOMO level of PD (P2 or P3) and LUMO level of Y6.

2.4. Charge-carrier generation and recombination
Next, to understand the charge-carrier dynamics of the Cz-based PD:Y6 blends, we obtained the exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) and light intensity (Plight)-dependent Voc and Jsc of each PSC at 298 K (Fig. 5 and S20†). The P(E, T) values of PSCs were determined as Jph,sc/Jsat in the graph of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff), where Jph,sc indicates the Jph under short-circuit conditions and Jsat is the Jph at Veff = 3 V (Fig. 5a).73 The P(E, T)s of the P2:Y6 (92.8%) and P3:Y6 (93.9%) PSCs exceeded that of the P1:Y6 PSC (87.8%), which suggests that the TT–π-bridged PDs facilitate charge-carrier generation. Furthermore, to elucidate the charge-carrier recombination behaviors of the PSCs, the dependence of their Vocs and Jscs on Plight (between 0.01 and 1 Sun) was investigated. The linear-log graphs (Vocversus Plight) of each PSC are shown in Fig. 5b, including the corresponding slope S with a unit of kBTq−1 (kB = Boltzmann constant, T = temperature, and q = elementary charge).74 The P3 and P2-based PSCs had lower S values of 1.04 and 1.08 than that of P1:Y6 (S = 1.27). This result indicates that the TT–π-bridged PDs suppress monomolecular recombination. In addition, we examined the bimolecular recombination of each PSC from the slope (α) of the log–log plot of Jscversus Plight (Jsc ∝ Plightα).75 The P1:Y6-based PSC exhibited the lowest α value of 0.77 compared to those of P2:Y6 (α = 0.82) and P3:Y6 (α = 0.85) (Fig. S20†). These results indicate that P3 is the most efficient PD of the series, optimizing both charge-carrier generation and recombination.

2.5. Charge transport and morphological properties of blend films
To investigate the hole and electron mobilities (μSCLCh and μSCLCe) of the blend films, we performed SCLC measurements and summarized the resulting values in Fig. S21† and Table 4. The charge mobilities of P2:Y6 (μSCLCh = 8.37 × 10−5 and μSCLCe = 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and P3:Y6 (μSCLCh = 1.74 × 10−4 and μSCLCe = 1.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) blends exceeded μSCLCh (1.07 × 10−5) and μSCLCe (3.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the P1:Y6 blend. Besides, the P2:Y6 and P3:Y6 blends showed more balanced electron/hole mobilities (μSCLCe/μSCLCh) of 1.37 and 1.12, respectively, than the P1:Y6 blend (μSCLCe/μSCLCh = 3.54). This result indicates that the TT–π-bridged PDs alleviate the charge recombination, contributing to higher FFs.25

The morphological properties, including surface topology and crystallinity, of each blend film were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and GIXS. All the blend films similarly showed low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values (1.4 nm for P1:Y6, 1.1 nm for P2:Y6, and 1.1 nm for P3:Y6), indicating that their surfaces are smooth without severe aggregation (Fig. S22†). In contrast, the crystalline properties of each blend film differed significantly as examined by the GIXS. We evaluated the π–π stacking distances (dπ–π) of the Cz-based PD:Y6 blend films from the (010)OOP peaks using d = 2πq−1 (Fig. S23 and Table S5†). The P3:Y6 blend had a close dπ–π of 3.61 Å, whereas the P1:Y6 blend exhibited a relatively longer distance of 3.67 Å. This result indicates that the molecules in the P3:Y6 blend pack tightly to form compact structures. Another noticeable result was observed in the scattering peak along the IP direction. While the P3:Y6 blend showed a sharp peak at q of 0.42 Å−1 with a high Lc of 35.9 nm, originating from the Y6 end-groups,20 the peak was not found in the corresponding line-cut profiles of the P1:Y6 and P2:Y6 blends. This result suggests that the P3:Y6 blend contained crystalline domains of P3 and Y6. Overall, the tight π–π stacking and high crystallinity of the P3:Y6 blend are consistent with its superior SCLC mobilities.
2.6. Thermal stability
Long-term stabilities of the solar cells (i.e., thermal- or photo-) are very important factors for determining their commercial feasibility.76–78 To investigate the thermal stability of the Cz-based PD:Y6 blend films, the PCEs of P1:Y6, P2:Y6, and P3:Y6 PSCs were monitored for different annealing times at 120 °C under vacuum. The normalized PCEavgs of the three blends and their photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Fig. 6 and Table S6,† respectively. To explore the effect of the π-conjugated bridges (T and TT) on the thermal stability of Cz-based PD:Y6 blend films, PSCs incorporating P1 and P3 PDs with the same alkyl side-chains (–DT) in their CBT units were compared. The T–π-bridged P1:Y6 PSC maintained only 48% of its initial PCE after annealing at 120 °C for 144 h. In stark contrast, the TT–π-bridged P3:Y6 PSC demonstrated much superior thermal stability, retaining more than 90% of its initial PCE under the same condition. To better explain the difference in the thermal stabilities of P1:Y6 and P3:Y6 blends, we investigated the blend morphologies for different annealing times at 120 °C (Fig. S24†). The AFM images showed that the morphologies of P3:Y6 blend film were stable against the thermal stress. In contrast, for the P1:Y6 blend film, large aggregates were formed after 24 h annealing. In general, the thermal stability of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film is significantly affected by the thermodynamic and kinetic factors of the PD:NFSMA blend.79–83 It is speculated that the more strongly formed crystalline domains in the P3:Y6 blend can effectively inhibit the diffusion of molecules, thus improving the morphological stability of the blend.80,82 For the same reason, the TT–π-bridged P3:Y6 blend showed much superior photostability (retaining more than 80% of its initial PCEavg after 96 h under 1 Sun illumination) than the T–π-bridged P1:Y6 PSC (maintaining only 60% of its initial PCEavg under same condition) (Fig. S25†).77

2.7. Ternary-blend PSC
To further increase the PCE and demonstrate the enhanced utility of the Cz-based P3 PD, we adopted a fullerene-based acceptor (PC71BM) with HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.96/−3.90 eV as the third component of the P3:Y6 blend. The incorporation of PC71BM molecules can enhance light absorption and charge transport, and reduce non-radiative Vloss.84,85 The J–V characteristics of P3:PC71BM and P3:Y6:PC71BM PSCs are presented in Fig. 7a. The P3:PC71BM blend exhibited a high PCE of 9.31% (Voc = 0.944 V, Jsc = 13.19 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.75), outperforming all the previously reported PSCs featuring Cz-based PDs (Fig. 7b and Table 5). Importantly, a significantly higher PCE of 15.54% (Voc = 0.854 V, Jsc = 25.07 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.73) was achieved by the P3:Y6:PC71BM (with a weight ratio of 1:1.1:0.2) ternary-blend PSC. Compared to the binary blend (P3:Y6), the reduced non-radiative Vloss (0.295 V) of the ternary-blend PSC as well as the enhanced light absorption by PC71BM contributed to the improved photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S26 and Table S7†). Notably, this PCE is the highest among those reported for PSCs incorporating Cz-based PDs (Fig. 7b).31

3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed a series of highly planar, efficient Cz-based PDs. By interposing π-conjugated bridges and modifying the side-chains of a Cz-based PD, we were able to optimize its molecular conformation, crystalline properties, and photovoltaic properties. In particular, the CBT units and π-conjugated bridges (i.e., T or TT) generated strong non-covalent interactions within the backbone. These non-covalent interactions conformationally locked the Cz-based PDs to form highly planar molecular structures, thereby enhancing the hole mobility. Among the series of PDs, the P3 PD, featuring the DT-functionalized CBT units and TT π-bridges, produced the highest PCE of 14.58% with Y6 acceptor, attributed to the highest crystallinity and balanced charge mobilities. In addition, the extended conjugation and enhanced molecular planarity of P3 effectively suppressed non-radiative Vloss in the PSCs. Furthermore, a high PCE of 15.54% was achieved by a ternary-blend PSC based on P3, Y6, and PC71BM components. Thus, this work demonstrates the utility of π-conjugated bridges in optimizing the structures of Cz-based PDs for the realization of thermally stable and highly efficient PSCs.
