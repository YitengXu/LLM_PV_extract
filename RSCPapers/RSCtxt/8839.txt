    , Accepted 5th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractTo realize high performance printed organic optoelectronic devices, the development of air-stable, cheap, and solution-processable electron injection layers (EILs) is urgently required to avoid the use of a low work-function metal electrode with poor air stability. We report sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, NaHCO3) as an efficient, low-cost, air-stable, and environmentally friendly EIL material in various printed organic electronic devices including organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photodiodes (OPDs) and n-channel organic thin film transistors (OFETs). UV photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that the work-function of various common electrodes used for organic devices such as ITO, Au, Al and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) decreased significantly by more than 1 eV following deposition of a thin NaHCO3 film. The performance and stability of these organic devices improved by around 15% overall with ultra-cheap, air stable EILs. In particular, high performance OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM with a power conversion efficiency of 8.40% and solution processed OLEDs based on PVK:PBD:Ir(ppy)3 with light emitting efficiencies of 68.5 cd A−1 and 20 lm A−1 were achieved by applying a NaHCO3 interlayer.
1. Introduction
Organic thin-film optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic photodiodes (OPDs) are being actively researched due to their potential in realizing lightweight, unbreakable and flexible electronic devices through cost effective solution processes.1–6 Organic optoelectronic devices mostly require both efficient and balanced electrons and hole injection (and collection) from (to) the anode and the cathode because the performance of the devices strongly depends on the formation (and dissociation) of bound electron–hole pairs, i.e., excitons.7–10 Thus, in addition to developing a high performance active layer, developing solution-processable and air stable charge injection materials with a reasonable price has been one of the major research goals for realizing high performance and stable organic optoelectronic devices.11–13 In particular, the development of an electron injection layer (EIL) is more urgently required to avoid the use of a low work-function (WF) metal electrode with poor air stability.14,15
Three classes of materials, namely inorganic salts, nanocrystalline metal oxides, and organic semiconductors, have been explored as printable EILs for organic devices.16–18 However, all such materials have serious drawbacks. EILs based on sodium salts such as CH3COONa and NaCl, alkali metal fluorides such as LiF, NaF, and CsF and alkali metal carbonates such as Cs2CO3 and Rb2CO3 exhibit significant improvement of the electron injection properties with high WF metal electrodes in organic devices.19–21 However, most salt-based materials are highly unstable in air due to their intrinsic hygroscopic nature.22,23 Metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO and ZrO2 have been recently suggested as an alternative approach due to better ambient stability, but they require a relatively high annealing temperature (200–450 °C), which is not suitable for flexible plastic substrates.24–27
Herein, we propose sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, NaHCO3) as a low-cost, highly air-stable, low temperature processable and environmentally friendly EIL for printing various organic optoelectronic and electronic devices. The biggest advantage of this EIL is its ultra-cheap price and high air stability. In particular, baking soda is one of the most common materials used for a variety of purposes in cooking, cleaning, and daily life. This material is available at a much lower price (∼1$ kg−1 for low purity raw materials and 70$ kg−1 for high purity from Sigma Aldrich) than other famous EIL materials such as LiF (300$ g−1), CsF (4000$ kg−1), and polyethylenimine (PEI) (170$ g−1). NaHCO3 thin films can be deposited easily on various electrodes for organic devices such as ITO, Au, Al and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) through solution processing or thermal evaporation in a high vacuum chamber and effectively reduces the WF of the electrode by over 1 eV for efficient electron injection to the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of common organic semiconductors. The performances of OSCs, OLEDs, OPDs, and n-channel organic thin film transistors (OFETs) are improved by around 15% overall using this new concept of EIL.
2. Experimental section
OLED fabrication
Solution-processable phosphorescent OLEDs were fabricated with the following structures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:Ir(ppy)3:PBD/EIL/Al. For the polymer light-emitting layer, PVK, PBD, and Ir(ppy)3 from Sigma Aldrich were used without further purification. ITO-coated glass substrates were subjected to ultra-sonication in different solvents, including acetone, de-ionized water, and isopropanol. After rinsing, the substrates were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. The filtered solutions of PEDOT:PSS were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s onto the ITO-coated glass substrates. The PEDOT:PSS films were baked at 150 °C for 15 min. After removing the residual water in the films by baking, the following procedures were performed under inert conditions in a glove box. A blended solution of PVK:PBD:Ir(ppy)3 ((70:30):2.4 w/w) was dissolved in chlorobenzene and stirred at 80 °C overnight. After filtering the blended solution of the active emitting materials using a 0.2 μm PTPE syringe filter, the solution was spin-coated onto the HIL/ITO substrate to form a film and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min. TPBI was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp., dissolved in methanol at 0.4 wt% and spin coated on top of the active layer. Four EILs (all from Sigma Aldrich) were used for comparison: LiF, NaHCO3, BaCl2 and CsF (1 nm) were evaporated under high vacuum (less than 10−6 Torr) then the an Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited on top of the EIL layer. Passivation layer polyimide (40 wt% on cyclohexanone) was applied as a coating to protect the device from O2 and moisture in air. The performance and EL spectra of the devices were measured using a current and voltage source meter (Keithley 4200) and a spectroradiometer (SpectraScan, PR 670).
The ITO/ZnO/EIL/PVK:Ir(ppy)3:PBD/MoO3/Ag structure fabricated through a solution process with ZnO/EIL was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrate instead of PEDOT:PSS. The EIL solution was prepared by dissolving the material in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) at a concentration of 0.04 wt%. MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (70 nm) was evaporated under high vacuum (less than 10−6 Torr).
Field-effect transistor fabrication and characterization
OFETs with a top-gate/bottom-contact (TG/BC) structure were fabricated on glass substrates. Au/Ni-electrode patterned substrates were cleaned sequentially in an ultrasonic bath with de-ionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol for 5 min for each cleaning step followed by UV treatment for 10 min. A NaHCO3 interlayer solution with different concentrations (0.2–0.8 wt%) was spin-coated on a pre-cleaned substrate and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. An n-type polymer semiconductor, P(NDIOD-T2), and small molecular PCBM were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ambipolar DPPT-TT was chemically synthesized using a previously published procedure and dissolved in anhydrous dichlorobenzene (DCB) to obtain a solution of ∼5 mg ml−1. The solution was spin-coated onto the NaHCO3 interlayer-deposited substrates and sequentially annealed at 150 °C (for P(NDIOD-T2) and PC60BM) or 250 °C (for DPPT-TT) for ∼30 min in a nitrogen (N2)-filled glove box. A polymer dielectric layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, used without further purification and dissolved in n-butylacetate (nBA) at a concentration of 80 mg ml−1. A PMMA thin film was formed on the polymer semiconductor layer by spin-coating, followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C for ∼30 min in the same N2-filled glove box to remove the residual solvents. OFET fabrication was completed by thermally depositing aluminum (Al) via metal shadow masks to form top-gate electrodes (∼50 nm thick). The electrical characteristics of the OFETs were tested using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system in an N2-filled glove box. The corresponding field-effect mobility (μFET) and threshold voltage (VTh) were calculated from the saturation regime (at a drain voltage VD = −80 V). The low-field mobility (μ0) and RC were evaluated using the Y-function method (YFM)28,29 for individual transistors.
OPD fabrication
Solution-processable phosphorescent OPDs were fabricated with the following structures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/EIL/Al. In the polymer active layer, P3HT and PCBM from Sigma Aldrich were used without further purification. ITO-coated glass substrates were subjected to ultra-sonication in different solvents, including acetone, de-ionized water, and isopropanol. After rinsing, the substrates were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. The filtered solutions of PEDOT:PSS were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s onto the ITO-coated glass substrates. The PEDOT:PSS films were baked at 150 °C for 15 min. After removing the residual water in the films by baking, the following procedures were performed under inert conditions in a glove box. A blended solution of P3HT:PCBM ((50:50) w/w) 60 wt% was dissolved in chlorobenzene and stirred at 80 °C overnight. After filtering the blended solution of the active materials using a 0.2 μm PTPE syringe filter, the solution was spin-coated onto the HIL/ITO substrate to form a film and annealed at 180 °C for 15 min. Four EILs (all from Sigma Aldrich) were used for comparison: LiF, NaHCO3, BaCl2 and CsF (1 nm) were evaporated under high vacuum (less than 10−6 Torr) and then an Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited on top of the EIL layer. Passivation layer polyimide (40 wt% on cyclohexanone) was applied as a coating to protect the device from O2 and moisture in air.
ITO/ZnO/EIL/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag also fabricated through a solution process with ZnO/EIL was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrate instead of PEDOT:PSS. The EIL solution was prepared by dissolving the material in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) at a concentration of 0.04 wt%. MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (70 nm) was evaporated under high vacuum (less than 10−6 Torr).
Materials and device fabrication of solar cells
The polymers PTB7, P3HT and PC71BM (purity >99% by HPLC) were purchased from 1-Material and utilized without further purification. A sol–gel ZnO precursor solution (0.5 M) was prepared using Zn(CH3COOH)2·2H2O (1.09 g, 5 mmol) and 2-ethanolamine (500 μL) was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml). The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 hours and then filtered using a 0.2 μm PTFE filter. The solutions of PTB7:PC71BM (1.0:1.5 wt) with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1 were dissolved in chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 v/v) and stirred at 70 °C overnight. The solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size PTFE filter and stored in an argon-filled glovebox. Inverted polymer solar cells were fabricated by spin-coating the ZnO precursor on the UV pretreated ITO (140 nm, 15 Ω sq−1) and annealing at 180 °C in air for 10 min to form a ZnO layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm. The devices were transferred into the glovebox for the purpose of spin-coating the active layer with controlled thickness. The active layer thickness of PTB7:PC71BM was around 100 ± 5 nm. The resulting devices were then dried under high vacuum (<5 × 10−6 mbar) for 3 hours. Finally, MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (100 nm) electrodes were sequentially deposited on the active layer through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation (<5 × 10−6 mbar), which defined an active area of 0.13 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
Thin film properties
The process to prepare NaHCO3 solution is displayed in Fig. 1(a). NaHCO3 has very good solubility in deionized water with simple stirring. The transparent and colorless solution remains stable in air for more than one year without any chemical changes. The aqueous NaHCO3 solution was spin-coated on various electrode surfaces and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The NaHCO3 rapidly decomposed into Na2CO3, CO2 and H2O during the annealing process. CO2 and H2O were evaporated in air, leaving only Na2CO3 in the film. 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O(1)

(b) Atomic force microscopy image of spin coating and the evaporated NaHCO3 films on the ITO substrate (2 μm × 2 μm). (c) Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of the bare ITO substrate (black) and the NaHCO3 film (green: t ∼ 1 nm, blue: 2 nm and dark green: 3 nm) or the CsF film (orange: t ∼ 1 nm, red: 3 nm) coated on the ITO/glass substrate. (d) X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for CsF (red) and NaHCO3 films with different annealing temperatures (black: pristine, green: 150 °C and blue: 250 °C annealed) and (e) C 2p XPS spectra of bare (black) and annealed NaHCO3 films at 150 °C (green) and 250 °C (blue). 
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image shows that the 1 nm thick evaporated NaHCO3 film did not completely cover the ITO substrate with a nano-sized isolated dot structure (Fig. 1(b)). Even the spin coated film had slightly larger sized nano-dots, which were dispersed over the entire film surface without aggregation. Similar nano-dot like morphologies were also observed for thin LiF or CsF interlayers in a previous study.30–32 The root-mean-square (rms) roughness significantly increased to 2.3 nm for both the spin coated and evaporated films due to an increase in the thickness up to 5 nm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). This result indicates that the NaHCO3 film was deposited with an aggregated island morphology.
To understand the surface electrical properties, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to evaluate the NaHCO3 deposited on the ITO substrate. Fig. 1(c) shows the UPS spectra for the secondary electron cutoff regions for the CsF/ITO and NaHCO3/ITO films. For the spin coated (3000 rpm, t ∼ 3 nm) film, the Fermi level shifted significantly towards a LUMO level as high as 1 eV, which is a larger shift than that of CsF. We also measured the UPS spectra of the EIL on various conductive electrodes such as PEDOT:PSS, Au, and Al. The results are summarized in Table 1. After deposition of the NaHCO3 film, the WF of the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000), Au and Al surfaces was significantly reduced to 3.65, 3.83, and 3.48 eV from 4.82, 5.04, and 4.32 eV, respectively. This result indicated that regardless of the type of conductor, a WF of around 3.5–4.0 eV can be obtained through the introduction of the NaHCO3 EIL to facilitate electron injection to common organic semiconductors. The result from ACII measurements in air showed a similar trend even though the absolute WF values were slightly different. The change in WF persisted after high thermal annealing up to 400 °C, indicating that the interlayer is available for high temperature processes. The WF of the NaHCO3-coated ITO electrodes remained stable for more than 8 weeks in a normal laboratory air atmosphere (Table S1 in the ESI†).

The chemical compositions of NaHCO3 on ITO were investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The core-level spectra of a pristine NaHCO3 film are shown at the bottom of Fig. 1(d). The O peak at around 540 eV from the NaHCO3 surface was attributed to the HCO3 1-group sharply appear compared with that observed in the CsF film that came from oxygen contamination.33,34 In the full XPS spectra for the NaHCO3 film, O 1s and Na 1s peaks at 540 and 1071.6 eV were observed for the O–Na bond in NaHCO3.33 The C–O peak shifted slightly to 286.2 eV, indicating complete decomposition from NaHCO3 to Na2CO3 after the annealing process at 150 °C (Fig. 1(e)). Minimal shifting of the O 1s and Na 1s peaks after the thermal annealing process indicated that no decomposition of Na2CO3 to Na2O took place during evaporation or thermal annealing.35
Characterization of organic electronic devices
Recently, several pioneering companies have commercialized organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs through a rolling-to-rolling based printed process.36,37 A cheap, environmental friendly, and air-stable EIL is required for this purpose.38 We applied NaHCO3 EILs to BHJ OSCs based on poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) as the electron donor and C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor. Four different device structures were investigated as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 (device No. 1–4). Without the EIL, device No. 1 (Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/ITO/glass) exhibited a lowest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.99% with a low open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.38 V and a low fill factor (FF) of 0.55. The poor result indicates that the high WF of ITO (∼4.7 eV) is not suitable for the EIL of BHJ OSCs. The small energy gap between the ITO and MoO3 of ∼0.5 eV in device No. 1 led to low VOC. After deposition of a thin NaHCO3 layer on ITO by spray coating, the PCE of device No. 2 (Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/NaHCO3 spray/ITO/glass) improved to 4.07% with better VOC (0.55 V) and FF (0.59) than that of device No. 1. This result was obtain by the reduction in the WF of ITO due to deposition of a thin film of NaHCO3 as observed in the UPS results.

Different electron injection layers were applied for devices No. 1–4. Device structures: No. 1. Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/ITO/glass; No. 2. Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/spray coated NaHCO3/ITO/glass; No. 3. Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/ZnO/ITO/glass; and No. 4. Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/spray coated NaHCO3/ZnO/ITO/glass. 
For further improvement, bare ZnO or NaHCO3 and ZnO were employed in device No. 03 (Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/ZnO/ITO/glass) and No. 04 (Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/NaHCO3 spray/ZnO/ITO/glass), respectively. By applying a ZnO layer, the device showed a highly improved PCE of 8.05%. In particular, the PCE was increased further to 8.40% after deposition of NaHCO3 on ZnO with enhancement of the short circuit current density (JSC) from 15.10 mA cm−2 to 15.51 mA cm−2. This result indicates that NaHCO3 may help to optimize the surface of the ZnO layer by reducing defects and roughness. Along with the enhancement of VOC and JSC, the FF was found to be 67.68%, higher than that of OSCs without NaHCO3. This result was due to a smaller series resistance (Rs), signifying the effective reduction of the contact resistance (Rc) by the formation of an interface dipole between the fullerene derivative and the ITO electrode. The higher EQE values of the OSCs with an EIL over 80% in the visible to near-infrared region suggest that they efficiently collect electrons from the photoactive layer owing to the successful reduction of the energy barrier at the interface between the PC71BM and ITO (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The deep HOMO level in NaHCO3 will reduce the rate of recombination for holes and electrons, thus improving the amount of charge collection at the respective electrodes. The increase in JSC for the NaHCO3 device is supported by the EQE spectra, which exhibited an enhanced light response in the absorption band at 300–800 nm.
We also applied the NaHCO3 EIL for organic photodiodes (OPDs)39 based on a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) active layer (Fig. 3).40 Two OPDs with different structures were fabricated as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PC60BM/EIL (1 nm)/Al as the conventional structure and ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/EIL (3 nm)/P3HT:PC60BM/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag as the inverted structure. OPDs with LiF, CsF, or BaCl2, which have been previously reported as well-known EIL materials, were also fabricated as reference devices. A lowest dark current density of 2.13 × 10−7 A cm−2 at −3 V was recorded with the NaHCO3 devices, compared with 2.92 × 10−6 A cm−2, 1.55 × 10−6 A cm−2 and 2.67 × 10−6 A cm−2 from the same OPDs with LiF, CsF and BaCl2, respectively (Fig. 3(a)). Under illumination with 600 nm light (10 mW cm−2), the OPDs with NaHCO3 showed high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 56.03%, comparable to devices with LiF (60.39%). OPDs with CsF and BaCl2 showed a slightly lower EQE of 44.37 and 48.4%, respectively. We also calculated the photo-detectivity of devices defined as D* = (A)1/2/NEP, where A is the detector area and NEP is the noise equivalent power. NEP, which is dominated by shot noise, is defined as NEP = (2eId)1/2/R, where e is the electronic charge, Id is the dark current and R is the detector responsibility. OPDs with NaHCO3 have a calculated responsivity of 271.1 mA W−1, a photodetector detectivity of D* = 1.27 × 1012 and a photosensitivity of SNR = 1.27 × 104, which was the highest value among the measured devices. This result indicated that the use of the NaHCO3 layer can improve the performance of the resistance components in the P3HT:PC60BM layer compared to other EILs.40,41 In the inverted OPDs shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), high device characteristics were also achieved for the OPDs with NaHCO3 EILs with a lowest dark current of 1.02 × 10−8 A cm−2 and a high responsivity of 258.6 mA W−1, a high photodetector detectivity of D* = 4.53 × 1012 and a photosensitivity SNR of 2.54 × 104. The detailed properties for all OPDs are summarized in Table 3.

An EIL layer is essential for long-lived OLEDs to obtain efficient electron injection from relatively ambient, stable, and high WF cathodes. To identify the NaHCO3 EIL properties in OLEDs, the NaHCO3 thin film was applied as the EIL in solution-processed phosphorescent OLEDs (Fig. 4). A standard emissive layer, which consisted of poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) as hosts and tris(2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) as the guest emitter, was used in all devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:PBD:Ir(ppy)3/TPBi/EIL/Al. Table 4 summarizes all OLED results. The overall performance was comparable to the performance in previous studies using the same PVK:PBD:Ir(ppy)3 active layer.42 The turn-on voltage for NaHCO3 devices was 4.9 V at 1 cd m−2, which was less than about 0.8 and 0.4 V for BaCl2 or CsF devices and almost the same for LiF devices. A highest maximum power efficiency and maximum luminous efficiency of 20.0 lm W−1 and 68.5 cd A−1 were achieved for OLEDs with NaHCO3 compared to devices with other EILs as shown in Table 4.

We also applied the NaHCO3 EIL in inverted OLEDs with the following structure: ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/NaHCO3 EIL (2 nm)/PVK:PBD:Ir(ppy)3/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag. No emission was observed from the ITO devices because the WF of ITO was too high to ensure efficient electron injection to the emissive layer. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the J–V characteristics of the inverted devices with the NaHCO3 EIL. Inverted OLEDs with NaHCO3 showed better performance such as the maximum luminance, power efficiency and EQE than the same devices with BaCl2 and CsF EILs (Table S2, ESI†). The turn-on voltage for the NaHCO3 OLEDs was 6.1 V at 1 cd m−2, which was almost the same as that for OLEDs with the well-known PEI EIL.17
Finally, we applied NaHCO3 as the EIL in n-channel organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Typically, common n-channel OFETs suffer from a large electron contact resistance due to the energy mismatch between the LUMO of the n-type OSCs and the WF of the commonly used Au electrode. Two n-channel OFETs with the widely used P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer or PC60BM small molecule and ambipolar OFETs with DPPT-TT were investigated. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the typical transfer characteristics of P(NDI2OD-T2), DPPT-TT and PC60BM OFETs with NaHCO3 of different thickness levels on Au electrodes. All OFET device properties are summarized in Table 5. P(NDI2OD-T2) OFETs exhibited significantly improved electron field-effect mobility (μFET) from 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.62 cm2 V−1 s−1 with decreased threshold voltage (VTh) following the application of thin NaHCO3 EILs (t ∼ 3 nm). PC60BM and DPPT-TT OFETs also showed the same trend. The improvement of the OFET characteristics is due to the large reduction in contact resistance for electron injection following the application of the NaHCO3 EIL (Table 5). The effect of the NaHCO3 EIL on the performance of n-channel OFETs was almost comparable to or even better than that of other commonly used EILs such as CsF and BaCl2 (Fig. S6d, ESI†).

4. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced baking soda as an ultra-cheap, highly air-stable, low temperature processable and environmentally friendly electron injection layer for various printed organic optoelectronic and electronic devices including OSCs, OPDs, OLEDs, and OFETs. The devices with NaHCO3 EILs showed highly improved electron injection properties compared with bare devices and even devices with other commonly used EILs. The ultra-cheap materials and the process cost of the baking soda EIL are advantageous for the mass production of printed roll-to-roll based organic devices that require a final product with low cost. We strongly believe that the baking soda interlayer will play a major role in the commercialization of these devices through innovative processes in the near future.
