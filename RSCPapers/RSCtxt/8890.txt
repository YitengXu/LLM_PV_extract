    , Accepted 11th March 2019First published on 12th March 2019AbstractCurrently, one of the major hurdles hindering the clinical applications of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photothermal-chemo combination therapy (PCT) is the lack of highly efficient, readily derived, and irradiation-safe photothermal agents in the biologically transparent window. Herein, we report the first design and rational construction of 0D/2D/0D sandwich heterojunctions for greatly enhanced PTT and PCT performances using 0D N-doped carbon dots and 2D MoS2 nanosheets as the assembly units. The well-matching heterojunctions enabled an additional enhancement in NIR absorbance owing to the carrier injection from carbon dots to MoS2 nanosheets, and achieved a much higher photothermal conversion efficiency (78.2%) than that of single NIR-CDs (37.6%) and MoS2 (38.3%) only. In virtue of the heterojunction-based PTT, complete tumor recession without recurrence or pulmonary metastasis was realized at an ultralow and safe laser exposure (0.2 W cm−2) below the skin tolerance irradiation threshold. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the strong X-ray attenuation and effective drug loading capacity of MoS2 nanosheets, the CT imaging-guided PCT was achieved at 0.1 W cm−2, without inducing noticeable toxic side effects. Our findings can substantiate the potential of a novel 0D/2D heterojunction for cancer theranostics.
Introduction
Photothermal treatment (PTT) and photothermal-chemo combination therapy (PCT) are generally regarded as minimally invasive modalities for effective tumor growth inhibition.1–6 A main hurdle in the clinic is the lack of highly efficient, readily derived, and biocompatible PTT or PCT agents that effectively generate heat in the biologically transparent window (700–1400 nm) at a low laser exposure. Currently, various inorganic PTT agents have been developed for PTT or PCT applications, such as noble metal nanostructures,2,7,8 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets,9–12 one-dimensional nanotubes,13,14 and zero-dimensional (0D) dots.15,16 Among them, MoS2 biomaterials have attracted attention for various biomedical applications such as effective drug carriers,9 CT contrast agents,10 and PTT/PCT agents.11,12 As 2D materials, MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) hold great potential largely because their huge surface area-to-mass ratio makes them invaluable carriers. In MoS2, S is a common biological element, and Mo has strong X-ray attenuation that can be applied in CT imaging. Recently, MoS2 nanosheets and related materials (e.g. nanodots11 and hollow spheres17) have been found to exhibit effective photothermal performance due to their high extinction coefficient in the NIR region. However, their rather low photothermal conversion efficiency necessitates a rather high power density of the laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2) beyond the maximum permissible exposure (MPE, 0.42 W cm−2 at 808 nm) for complete tumor ablation, which limits their PTT applications. To improve MoS2 PTT performances, various composite materials have been developed, including MoS2/Fe3O4 nanoflakes,18 PLGA/MoS2,19 MoS2/Au nanoparticles,20 and MoS2/Bi2S3.21 Nevertheless, the total photothermal conversion efficiency of these composites remains low (22–44%) and the applied laser power density is still high (0.6–1.5 cm−2 at 808 nm).
Carbon dots (CDs) are an alluring 0D nanomaterial that can be extensively utilized in various fields owing to their unique physiochemical properties. CDs can be readily synthesized and functionalized on a large scale, at a low cost, and in a high yield. Toxicological studies have revealed that CDs have negligible toxicity on cells and insignificant signals of toxic side effects on animals. They can be rapidly cleared from bodies via renal excretion into the bladder and liver excretion into bile,22 which greatly reduces the risk of long-term toxicity on the liver, kidney, and other normal tissues. Because of these advantages, CDs hold promise in bioimaging,23,24 biosensors,25,26 drug delivery,27 photodynamic therapy (PDT),28,29 and PTT.15,16,30–32 Recently, several groups have prepared NIR-CDs with excellent optical stability for PTT applications by decomposition and carbonation of expensive NIR-responsive organic materials such as CyOH dye,16 polythiophene,30 or polythiophene phenylpropionic acid.32 Moreover, they show relatively low photothermal conversion efficiencies (36–38%). To achieve effective PTT tumor ablation, high power densities of 1.5–2 W cm−2 were thus required, far higher than the skin tolerance irradiation threshold (0.42 W cm−2). Additionally, to realize complete tumor remission, a rather high CD dose (100 mg kg−1)15 or a shorter laser wavelength (671 nm)32 was still required besides the need for high power densities. Furthermore, most CDs were administered by intratumoral (i.t.) injection because they have no targeting ability towards tumor tissues when injected intravenously.
It could be an effective strategy to construct hybrid heterojunctions using 0D and 2D materials with matched band gaps to improve the photothermal conversion performance for PTT/PCT applications since heterojunction architectures could enhance efficient separation and immigration of photoexcited charges.33,34 Currently, the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions is focusing on light harvesting in the UV and visible regions and on their use in conventional fields such as photoelectronics35,36 and photocatalysis.37–39 Little work has been reported in the design and fabrication of sensitized heterojunctions that can also harvest NIR light for enhanced photothermal conversion for tumor ablation under NIR irradiation at ultralow laser power densities. Here we report the first design and rational construction of 0D/2D/0D sandwich heterojunctions for greatly enhanced PTT and PCT performances using NIR-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets and N-doped CDs as the assembly units.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions
We prepared the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions through three steps, as shown in Scheme 1. First, NIR-CDs with enhanced NIR absorption were synthesized from two low-cost precursors 1,3,6-trinitropyrene (TNP) and branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) through a modified hydrothermal molecular fusion route.40 The resulting NIR-CDs were water soluble and positively charged owing to hydroxyl and pyrrolic functionalization, as shown in the structural model. Second, PEG-functionalized, negatively charged MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-PEG) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using (NH4)2MoS4 as the precursor and PEG-400 as the stabilizer. Finally, positively charged 0D NIR-CDs were assembled onto the both sides of the negatively charged 2D MoS2-PEG nanosheets through the electrostatic interaction to form a 0D/2D/0D sandwich architecture after the aqueous solutions of the as-prepared MoS2-PEG (5 mL, 0.2 mg mL−1) and NIR-CDs (5 mL, 0.1–0.5 mg mL−1) at pH 8.0 were mixed and vigorously stirred for 12 h. After centrifugation, the formed heterojunctions were isolated from the solution and well dispersed in water to form a stable dispersion owing to the presence of surface PEG. By surface charge driven assembly, about 94% NIR-CDs in the mixed solution were deposited onto high-surface-area MoS2 nanosheets, and the NIR-CD loading can be tuned by varying the concentration ratio of NIR-CDs to MoS2 nanosheets. The water-soluble and stable heterojunctions containing a 200% loading of NIR-CDs were applied as a PTT agent for tumor ablation or photothermal-chemo combination therapy, and as an efficient contrast agent for CT imaging.

Prior to assembling, the synthesis of the NIR-CD units was optimized to maximize their NIR absorbance by using different molecular weights of BPEI as the precursors and varying its concentration ratio to TNP (BPEI:TNP). As a result, NIR-CD1800 with the most enhanced NIR absorbance was derived at the concentration ratio of TNP:BPEI of 8:1 using BPEI1800 as the precursor (Fig. 1b). We found that NIR-CD1800 shows a broad absorption spectrum ranging from the UV and visible to NIR regions (300–850 nm) (Fig. 1a). The UV band (<400 nm) and the visible band centered at ∼450 nm can be ascribed to the electronic transitions of n–π* and π–π*, respectively, indicative of a wide band gap in the ultrasmall quantum dots. The NIR absorption tail could involve optical transitions from the valence band to the deep defect states within the band gap. Recently, some experiments have studied the effect of N doping on the optical properties of nitrogen-doped CDs (N-CDs).41–46 It has been extensively explored that the absorption spectrum of N-CDs could be shifted to longer wavelengths following the increases in N content.41–44 To reveal this doping effect, the N doping level in the NIR-CDs was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Different from previous observations, the total N content in strongly NIR-absorbing NIR-CD600 (13.95 at% N) and NIR-CD1800 (14.46 at% N) is substantially lower than that of weakly NIR-absorbing NIR-CD10000 (19.09 at% N) (Fig. S1 and S2†), suggesting that the total N content is not directly correlated with the enhanced NIR absorbance in the NIR-CDs. Recently, a systematic theoretical study on N-doped CD models suggested that among nitrogen configurations, including amino N, pyridinic N, graphitic N, and pyrrolic N, only graphitic nitrogen shows an electron-doping effect that induces deep gap states between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and causes pronounced red-shifts of the absorption spectra.45,46 A combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments also highlighted the important role of graphitic nitrogen in generating midgap states of N-CDs and thus red-shifting their photoluminescence (PL).45 Inspired by previous studies on the graphitic N doping effect, we measured the graphitic nitrogen content in the three samples by deconvoluting their XPS nitrogen spectra into two components, including pyrrolic N at 398.8 eV and graphitic N at 400.7 eV (Fig. S1 and S2†). The graphitic N content (2.16 at%) of NIR-CD1800 with the strongest NIR absorption is notably higher than that of the other NIR-CDs (1.04 at% for NIR-CD10000 and 1.21 at% for NIR-CD600). Based on these analyses, we believe that graphitic nitrogen may induce appropriately deep defect states in the HOMO–LUMO gap that may mediate NIR transitions from the HOMO states to the defect states, as shown in Fig. 1c.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1d and e) reveal that the optimized NIR-CDs (NIR-CD1800) are well-dispersed with an average size of 5.3 ± 1.3 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image exhibits well-resolved crystalline lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm (Fig. 1f), corresponding to the d-spacing of the graphene (100) planes. The Raman peaks centered at ∼1360 and 1590 cm−1 are attributed to the disordered structure or defects (D band) and the graphitic carbon domain (G band), respectively (Fig. S3c†). The large intensity ratio ID/IG indicates that the NIR-CDs have a great number of disorders or defects. The XRD patterns of NIR-CDs exhibit a broad peak at around 21.2°, corresponding to a broader (002) layer spacing (3.91 Å) of a graphite-like structure (Fig. S3a†). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis shows that NIR-CDs are functionalized with O–H groups, which can be confirmed by the broad absorption bands at 3300–3500 cm−1 (Fig. S3b†). Additionally, the NIR-CDs exhibit the characteristic absorption bands of CC, C–N, and C–H at 1641, 1437, and 1384 cm−1, respectively.
Ultrathin MoS2-PEG nanosheets with a larger lateral size (∼100 nm) than that of the NIR-CDs were synthesized as the other units in the NIR-CD/MoS2 sandwich (Fig. 2a). The MoS2-PEG nanosheets existed as a semiconducting 2H-phase,47 which is confirmed by XRD (Fig. S5a†). The crystal lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.28 nm can be assigned to the (100) plane of hexagonal 2H-MoS2 (Fig. S6a†). Free MoS2-PEG nanosheets have a zeta potential of −25.8 mV, revealing the presence of a negative surface charge (Fig. S7a†). In the hexagonal 2H-MoS2 monolayer (Scheme 1), the two adjacent S2− anion sublayers sandwiching the metal Mo4+ sublayer constitute the upper and lower surfaces of the monolayer nanosheets, providing a large quantity of negatively charged S2− absorbing sites for ultrasmall positively charged NIR-CDs. Upon mixing low-concentration NIR-CDs with MoS2-PEG nanosheets, the NIR-CD/MoS2 composite at a low loading level of ∼50% was prepared. TEM images show that individual NIR-CDs were well dispersed on the surface of MoS2-PEG nanosheets without aggregation (Fig. 2b and c). This low-loading NIR-CD/MoS2 hybrid only offered a limited enhancement in the photothermal performance (a small temperature rise upon the NIR exposure), but would be expected to markedly improve the catalytic activity of MoS2 nanosheets for applications in the hydrogen evolution reaction and solar cells. To greatly enhance the photothermal effects of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions, we synthesized the NIR-CD/MoS2 hybrid with a high loading level as high as 200%. In this case, the MoS2 nanosheets were fully covered with a thin layer of NIR-CDs, as directly observed by TEM (Fig. 2d). After a high loading, the surface charge was reversed from negative to positive (the corresponding zeta potential was changed from −25.8 to +5.9 mV) (Fig. S7a†). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis reveals no significant changes in the hydrodynamic size before and after assembling (the size by DLS is larger than that by TEM) (Fig. S7b and c†). By virtue of the PEG-400 functionalization, the obtained MoS2-PEG nanosheets exhibit significantly enhanced physiological stability and biocompatibility, without showing any agglomeration in water, PBS, and DMEM culture medium (Fig. S8†).

We further examined the chemical states of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions via XPS analysis. As presented in Fig. 3a, the survey XPS spectrum reveals strong signals of Mo 3d, S 2p, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, indicative of the successful loading of NIR-CDs on the nanosheets. In the high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 3b), four typical peaks at 227.7, 231.0, 232.4, and 234.8 eV correspond to Mo 3d5/2 (Mo4+), Mo 3d3/2 (Mo4+), Mo 3d5/2 (Mo6+), and Mo 3d5/2 (Mo6+), respectively (the peak at 225.1 eV represents the S 2s orbital signal). For the high-resolution S 2p spectrum, two peaks at 160.6 and 161.7 eV were assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of divalent sulfide ions (S2−), respectively (Fig. 3c). For the high-resolution N 1s spectrum, two peaks at 400.1 eV and 398.6 are assigned to graphitic N and pyrrole N, respectively (Fig. 3e), and the peak at 394.1 eV is assigned to the Mo 3p3/2 signal. The C 1s band can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.4, 285.7, and 287.1 eV, representing C–C, C–N, and C–OH, respectively (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3f) reveals the strong signal of hydroxyl (530.9 eV) and the distinguishable C–O peak (532.8 eV). Significantly, the C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s spectra of the NIR-CD/MoS2-PEG heterojunctions are consistent with those of the NIR-CDs (Fig. S1†), demonstrating the existence of NIR-CDs in the heterojunctions.

Enhanced photothermal effects by the heterojunctions
We first explored the optical properties (photoluminescence and absorption) of the heterojunctions by comparison with those of free NIR-CDs and MoS2 nanosheets. The heterojunctions exhibit blue fluorescence under UV irradiation that originates from the NIR-CDs well-dispersed on the MoS2 nanosheet surface. Compared with the bright cyan fluorescence of free NIR-CDs, the fluorescence of the NIR-CDs on the surface exhibits substantial PL quenching and a blue shift of 12 nm (Fig. 4a). The NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunction solution, which contains 0.02 mg mL−1 MoS2 and 0.04 mg mL−1 NIR-CDs, shows remarkably enhanced absorbance from the visible to NIR regions, compared to the sum of the absorbance (blue dotted line) of the respective pristine solutions of MoS2 (0.02 mg mL−1) and NIR-CDs (0.04 mg mL−1) with the same equivalent as that of the heterojunction components (Fig. 4b). At 808 nm, for example, the absorbance of NIR-CD/MoS2 is 0.576, being much larger than the sum (0.375) of the absorbance of pristine NIR-CDs (0.185) and MoS2-PEG (0.19) without a mixture. In contrast, there is a very small difference between the absorbance within the UV region for the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunction solution and NIR-CDs plus MoS2-PEG solutions. These results clearly show that the enhanced absorbance of the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunction in the visible-NIR region may inflect the photophysical characteristics of the heterojunction rather than the physical mixture of NIR-CDs and MoS2.

(d) Diagrams of the energy position and the deep defect state formation of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions under NIR laser irradiation. 
To understand the observed optical characteristics of the sandwich-like heterojunctions, we established a model of the electronic structure of the heterojunctions, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. For the two NIR-CD layer, we measured the CV curve to determine the LUMO energy level. From the reduction potential (Ered) of −0.84 V vs. SCE (Fig. S10b†), the LUMO energy level relative to the vacuum level is calculated to be −3.56 eV using the equation given in the Experimental section (ESI†). It is noted that the LUMO of the NIR-CDs locates above the conduction band (CB) bottom of H-MoS2 (−4.7 eV),48 giving a large energy difference of 1.14 eV to drive the electron transfer from the CB of the NIR-CDs to the CB of MoS2, as illustrated in Fig. 4c. According to the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the NIR-CDs (Fig. S10a†), the direct band-gap energy is determined as 3.1 eV by plotting the square of the absorption energy (αhν, where α is the absorbance and hv is the photon energy) against hν (known as Tauc plots49). Therefore, the energy level at the top of the valence band is lower than that of H-MoS2 since the former (3.1 eV) has a wider band gap than the latter (1.9 eV).50 For these kinds of I-type core–shell heterojunctions, photoexcited carriers (electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band) in the NIR-CDs under UV light are effectively injected into the middle H-MoS2 core, thus quenching the fluorescence from NIR-CDs (Fig. 4c). For excitation under NIR light, the electrons in the valence band of the NIR-CDs are excited and trapped in the defect states induced by graphitic N doping, while the left holes are rapidly transferred to the H-MoS2 core (Fig. 4d). Because the photoexcited electrons are trapped in the defect states of NIR-CDs, the injected holes in the H-MoS2 core could have a longer lifetime to contribute to and maintain the p-type conduction of H-MoS2. Owing to the presence of the free carrier in the H-MoS2 core, localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) could be induced, which may contribute to the observed additional absorption at long wavelengths like LSPR in plasmonic noble metals.51,52
Given the greatly enhanced NIR absorption of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions, we further compared the photothermal conversion performance of NIR-CD/MoS2 with pristine NIR-CDs and MoS2. The temperature changes of NIR-CD/MoS2 (0.6 mg mL−1), NIR-CDs (0.6 mg mL−1), and MoS2 (0.6 mg mL−1) solutions as a function of time under 808 nm laser irradiation (0.2 W cm−2) are presented in Fig. 5a. The temperature of NIR-CD/MoS2 increased by 25.7 °C after 5 min of 808 nm laser irradiation, while the temperature of NIR-CDs and MoS2 only increased by 15.5 and 17.3 °C, respectively. These results clearly confirmed the synergistically enhanced photothermal conversion performance of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions by the two components. Additionally, the detailed photothermal behaviors of NIR-CD/MoS2 were evaluated by monitoring the temperature variations of aqueous solutions containing NIR-CD/MoS2 at different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg mL−1 of NIR-CDs) under 808 nm laser irradiation at the same laser power density (0.2 W cm−2) (Fig. 5b). Fig. S11† reveals a noticeable concentration-dependent photothermal heating effect, indicating that NIR-CD/MoS2 can efficiently convert the absorbed 808 nm laser energy into heat. In contrast, the temperature of pure water (without NIR-CD/MoS2) only increased by less than 2.5 °C from room temperature. The visually displayed temperature changes of NIR-CD/MoS2 (0.6 mg mL−1), NIR-CDs (0.6 mg mL−1), and MoS2 solutions (0.6 mg mL−1) over the 5 min irradiation period were monitored synchronously through infrared thermal images (Fig. S12†). The laser power dependent photothermal effect (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 W cm−2) was further investigated by monitoring the temperature change of the NIR-CD/MoS2 solution (0.6 mg mL−1) under continuous irradiation for 5 min (Fig. 5c). Specifically, the temperature of the NIR-CD/MoS2 solution could be increased by 31.6 °C at a laser power density of 0.3 W cm−2. We further investigated the re-usability of NIR-CD/MoS2 under NIR irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5f, the changes in temperature exhibit insignificant deterioration during the 10 heating/cooling cycles. Notably, the NIR-CD/MoS2 showed excellent photothermal stability and exhibited no significant deterioration in its UV-vis-NIR absorption after continuous laser irradiation at different power densities (Fig. S13†).

The extinction coefficient (ε) and photothermal conversion efficiency (η) are the two main parameters to determine the photothermal performance of a PTT agent. We initially evaluated the extinction coefficient to demonstrate the light absorption ability of NIR-CD/MoS2. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of NIR-CD/MoS2 acquired on 0.6 mg mL−1 shows a strong absorption at 808 nm (2.001), which was much larger than pristine NIR-CDs (0.512) and MoS2 (0.985). Then, following the Lambert–Beer law (A/L = εC), the extinction coefficients at 808 nm were calculated to be 3.335 L g−1 cm−1, indicating the outstanding NIR laser absorption capability of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions. We next assessed the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) to reveal the capability of NIR-CD/MoS2 in converting 808 nm laser energy into heat. As shown in Fig. 5d, we recorded the heating and cooling curves of an aqueous solution containing NIR-CD/MoS2 (0.6 mg mL−1, 1.0 mL). According to the results of the maximum steady-state temperature (Tmax) and the time constant (τs) for heat transfer (Fig. 5d and e), the photothermal conversion efficiency of NIR-CD/MoS2 was calculated to be 78.2%, which was remarkably higher than that of pristine NIR-CDs (37.6%) and MoS2 (38.3%), confirming the synergistically enhanced photothermal performance of the two components in the heterojunctions. Additionally, we regulated the loading level of NIR-CDs to investigate the relationship between the content of NIR-CDs and the photothermal performance of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. S14,† the maximum photothermal conversion efficiency (78.2%) can be obtained when the loading concentration of NIR-CDs is 400 μg mL−1 (loading level = 200%). Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the heterojunction type was much higher than those of other kinds of MoS2-based photothermal agents reported so far, including MoS2 hollow spheres (34.5%),17 MoS2/Fe3O4 nanoflowers (27.7%),54 MoS2-polyglycidyl (29.4%),55 and MoS2-chitosan (24.4%).12 To the best of our knowledge, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunction is the highest among the MoS2-based photothermal agents (Table 1).

In vitro PTT of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions
To illustrate their potential in PTT, the cytotoxicity of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions as well as their components without NIR laser irradiation was first evaluated using a standard MTT assay. As depicted in Fig. S15a–c,† no significant decline of cell viability was observed at all tested concentrations after 24 h or 48 h incubation, demonstrating the excellent biocompatibility of NIR-CDs, MoS2, and NIR-CD/MoS2. Subsequently, we evaluated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the HeLa cells treated with NIR-CD/MoS2 by employing dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as the fluorescent probe and hydrogen peroxide as the positive control. After incubation with NIR-CD/MoS2 for 24 h, no significant increase in the ROS level can be detected, implying that no oxidative stress of the HeLa cells was triggered by the NIR-CD/MoS2 (Fig. S16a and S17†). Furthermore, the cell membrane integrity was investigated to detect whether the NIR-CD/MoS2 can disrupt the lipid membrane. Fig. S16b† reveals that no obvious LDH leakage can be induced by NIR-CD/MoS2, demonstrating that the integrity of the cell membrane was well maintained. These results confirmed the excellent biocompatibility of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions.
We then evaluated the PTT efficacy of NIR-CD/MoS2 against HeLa cells under NIR irradiation. After 4 h of incubation with NIR-CD/MoS2 followed by mild (0.2 W cm−2) and short (only 5 min) laser irradiation at 808 nm, the relative viability of HeLa cells was determined via the MTT assay. As the concentration of NIR-CD/MoS2 was increased to 0.6 mg mL−1, the cell viabilities were obviously decreased owing to the laser irradiation. Specifically, the mortality rate of HeLa cells treated with NIR-CD/MoS2 (0.6 mg mL−1) reached 91.8% after 48 h incubation, revealing the outstanding PTT efficacy of NIR-CD/MoS2. In contrast, the identical irradiation conditions led to the lower mortality rates of HeLa cells treated with NIR-CDs (71.5%) or MoS2 (46.3%) (Fig. S15d and e†). The in vitro results indicate that the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions are more efficient than the two single components for PTT owing to their stronger absorbance in the NIR region and much higher photothermal conversion efficiency.
CT imaging of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions
Having verified the photothermal therapeutic effects in vitro, we evaluated the capability of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions with the strong X-ray attenuation capability of MoS2 as the contrast agent for CT imaging, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities for clinical diagnosis and medical research owing to its deeper penetration in tissues and higher resolution in 3D structures. In studies of in vitro CT imaging, the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions with varied concentrations were imaged, which reveals that the Hounsfield unit (HU) shows a linear increase as the concentration of Mo element increases (Fig. 6a and b). The slope of the straight line of the HU value as a function of concentration of the contrast agent was calculated to be 17.45 HU L g−1, which was slightly higher than that of the clinically used iopromide contrast agent (15.9 HU L g−1)63 at the same voltage (80 kV). For in vivo CT imaging, 4T1 tumor bearing mice were i.v. injected with NIR-CD/MoS2 (1.0 mg mL−1, 0.2 mL). Compared with the uninjected mice, an obvious CT enhancement at the tumor site can be observed at 24 h post-injection (Fig. 6c), providing decisive evidence that the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions were available for tumor-specific drug delivery by virtue of the EPR effect. Additionally, the HU value which represented a CT contrast effect increased from 181.0 before injection to 273.2 after i.v. administration of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions.

(c) CT images of mice before and 24 h after i.v. injection with NIR-CD/MoS2 (1.0 mg mL−1, 0.2 mL). The CT contrast was obviously enhanced in the tumor area (highlighted by red circles). 

In vivo PTT of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions
Encouraged by the PTT in vitro and the tumor-specific drug delivery, we then performed in vivo studies to investigate the PTT efficacy of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions. When the tumor volumes reached about 100 mm3, 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were divided into five groups (5 mice per group): saline, NIR-CD/MoS2, saline + 808 nm laser irradiation (0.2 W cm−2), pristine MoS2 + 808 nm laser irradiation (0.2 W cm−2), and NIR-CD/MoS2 + 808 nm laser irradiation (0.2 W cm−2). Saline, MoS2 (dose = 6.0 mg kg−1), and NIR-CD/MoS2 (dose = 6.0 mg kg−1) were i.v. injected into those mice. To determine the accumulation level of NIR-CD/MoS2 at the tumor site over time, we irradiated the tumor at different time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h) following an intravenous injection. An infrared thermal camera was used to monitor the temperature variations of tumors during irradiation. As presented in Fig. S18,† the elevated temperature at the tumor site at 24 h post-injection is larger than other time points. Therefore, the PTT treatment was performed at 24 h post-injection under 808 nm laser irradiation at an ultralow power density (0.2 W cm−2) for 5 min. Compared with the saline and pristine MoS2 groups, the temperature of the tumors in the NIR-CD/MoS2 group rapidly increased under 808 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S19†), indicating excellent PTT efficiency of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions in vivo. During the treatment period, the tumor volumes (Fig. 7a) and body weights (Fig. 7c) of the mice were measured every 2 and 1 d, respectively. Remarkably, the growth of 4T1 tumors was completely inhibited under the treatment of NIR-CD/MoS2 at the ultralow power density (0.2 W cm−2) (Fig. 7c and e). In sharp contrast, the growth of the tumors in the saline group, the NIR-CD/MoS2 without laser irradiation group, and the saline with laser irradiation group rapidly increased within 18 days (Fig. 7d). Notably, the MoS2 with laser irradiation group exhibited slight antitumor efficacy, indicating that single MoS2 cannot completely eradicate the tumor at the ultralow power density (0.2 W cm−2) (Fig. 7a). Moreover, no pulmonary metastatic nodule can be observed in the mice administered NIR-CD/MoS2 with NIR irradiation, while a considerable amount of metastatic nodules was observed in the mice of the other groups after the treatment period (Fig. 7b). The in vivo PTT results indicate that the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions are more efficient than the single components owing to their enhanced NIR absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency, confirming its great potential for tumor ablation at an ultralow laser power density (0.2 W cm−2). It is noted that the required power density of PTT is the lowest among the previously reported MoS2-based photothermal agents (Table 1). In remarkable contrast, for all other MoS2-based photothermal agents, higher power densities (0.6–1.5 W cm−2) are required to achieve effective PTT tumor ablation. Additionally, to realize complete tumor remission, most MoS2-based photothermal agents were administered by i.t. injection.

In vivo PCT of DOX loaded NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions
These exciting results of complete tumor elimination by PTT made us wonder if the outstanding photothermal effect of NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions could be combined with chemotherapy for PCT at a much lower power density, such as 0.1 W cm−2. In our experiments, the NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 drug delivery system was prepared by mixing DOX with NIR-CD/MoS2 at pH = 8.0, followed by stirring for 24 h at room temperature. After the removal of excess free DOX through centrifugal filtration, the UV-vis-NIR spectrum was used to determine DOX loading ratios on NIR-CD/MoS2. Fig. 8a reveals that the distinct absorption peak at about 490 nm of DOX can be observed in the UV-vis-NIR spectrum of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2, confirming the successful loading of DOX. Moreover, after DOX was loaded on NIR-CD/MoS2, significant fluorescence quenching of DOX was observed (Fig. S20†), indicating the strong interactions between MoS2 nanosheets and DOX. Furthermore, the pH-dependent drug release behavior of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8b, approximately 40% and 24% of DOX were released from NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 over 24 hours at pH = 5.0 and 6.5, respectively, while only ∼8.4% of DOX release was observed at pH = 7.4. Furthermore, the pH triggered drug release ability of DOX loaded NIR-CD/MoS2 was further examined by evaluating their interaction with cells in vitro in response to the changed pH. As presented in Fig. S21,† NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 was predominant in the cell cytoplasm, suggesting that the DOX molecules still loaded on the MoS2 nanosheets after 2 h of incubation at pH = 7.4. However, a bright fluorescence of DOX was detected in the cell nucleus when the pH decreased to 6.5, indicating that the loaded DOX molecules were released under weakly acidic conditions.

The tumor was marked with red circles. 
The excellent photothermal conversion performance and the pH-triggered DOX release profiles of the NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 indicate its potential use in PCT. We first performed in vitro experiments to evaluate the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 at ultralow laser power densities (0.1 W cm−2). After incubation for 48 h, significant cytotoxicity of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 was observed when 808 nm laser irradiation was applied (Fig. S22c†), implying the favorable synergistic therapeutic efficacy of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2. Furthermore, compared to free DOX, NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 without laser irradiation showed significantly decreased cytotoxicity in vitro (Fig. S22a and b†). We further performed animal experiments to investigate the PCT efficacy in vivo using NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 at an ultralow laser power density (0.1 W cm−2). Fig. S19† reveals that the temperatures of tumors administered with NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 rapidly increased from 35.8 to 49.0 °C during NIR laser irradiation, demonstrating that PCT was more mild and safe than PTT alone. As presented in Fig. 8c, the tumors administered with free DOX grew quickly within the treatment period, indicating that free DOX with only a single dose was certainly not sufficient to suppress tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, complete tumor remission was realized by PCT using NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 as the PCT agent at a laser power density as low as 0.1 W cm−2, confirming the outstanding therapeutic efficacy as a result of combined chemotherapy and PTT. Furthermore, the number of nodules metastasized to the lung was completely eliminated by the treatment of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 with the laser irradiation (Fig. 8d), while the treatment of free DOX showed a negligible suppression of lung metastasis. The excellent PCT performances of the NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 are ascribed to the three prominent features of the NIR-CD/MoS2 heterojunctions: (1) greatly enhanced NIR absorbance and increased photothermal conversion efficiency leading to the generation of mild hyperthermia at much lower power densities; (2) notable EPR effect owing to the PEGylation, by which NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 could accumulate into tumor tissues at the maximized drug exposure; (3) faster DOX release at tumor sites with weakly acidic pH while the NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 could maintain the minimal release of DOX in normal tissues with pH 7.4.

In vivo toxicity of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2
Although favorable PTT and the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 were confirmed above, in vivo biocompatibility should also be evaluated. We first investigated the change of the body weights of the mice under different treatments during the treatment period of PTT and combination therapy. Fig. 7c and Fig. S23† reveal that no detectable weight variation of different group treated mice can be observed, indicating that these treatments were well tolerated. Then, we performed H&E-stained histological sections to evaluate the treatment-induced toxicity in vivo. Fig. S24† shows the H&E stained slices of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney), demonstrating that no appreciable pathological toxicity can be observed in various groups. Furthermore, we investigated the normal hematology parameters and standard blood biochemical indexes including white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cells (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and alanine transaminase (ALT). Compared with the control group, no meaningful changes of all the indexes were detected in the PTT and combination therapy treatment group (Fig. S25†). Lastly, we evaluated the impact of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 on the hemolytic behavior of RBCs by a hemolysis assay. After incubation with NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 with varied concentrations for 3 h, negligible hemolysis of RBCs can be detected (Fig. S26†), indicating the excellent hemocompatibility of NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2. Therefore, the NIR-CD/DOX/MoS2 with favorable photothermal performance is of high biocompatibility for further application in PTT and PCT.

Conclusion
In summary, novel NIR-CD-sensitized MoS2 heterojunctions with greatly enhanced PTT and PCT performances have been successfully prepared via a practical and scalable synthetic approach. The formation of graphitic N in NIR-CDs may play a crucial role in shifting and enhancing the optical absorbance in the NIR region. Distinct heterojunction-mediated synergistic effects in the NIR region were observed in the 0D/2D/0D system, including an additional enhancement in NIR absorbance owing to the carrier injection from carbon dots to MoS2 nanosheets, and a much higher photothermal conversion efficiency (78.2%) than that of single NIR-CDs (37.6%) and MoS2 (38.3%) only. Complete tumor ablation by the heterojunction-based PTT was realized under a low NIR exposure (0.2 W cm−2) without noticeable toxic side effects. By virtue of the strong X-ray attenuation and effective drug loading capacity of the MoS2 nanosheet component, the CT imaging-guided PCT was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, achieving outstanding synergistic cancer theranostics at an ultralow laser power density (0.1 W cm−2). Our work provides new insight into the rational design of high-performance photothermal agents based on the novel 0D/2D heterojunction architecture for highly efficient PTT and PCT applications at a low laser exposure.
