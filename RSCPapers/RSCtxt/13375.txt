    , Accepted 25th August 2015First published on 28th August 2015AbstractOxygen generation is the key step for the photocatalytic overall water splitting and considered to be kinetically more challenging than hydrogen generation. Here, an effective water oxidation catalyst of hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres are prepared via a two-step sequential solvothermal processes and followed by thermal treatment. The existence of an effective heterointerface and built-in electric field in the surface space charge region in FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres plays a positive role in promoting the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Surface photovoltage, transient-state photovoltage, fluorescence and electrochemical characterization are used to investigate the transfer process of photoinduced charge carriers. The photogenerated charge carriers in the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres with a proper molar ratio display much higher separation efficiency and longer lifetime than those in the FeTiO3 alone. Moreover, it is suggested that the hierarchical porous hollow structure can contribute to the enhancement of light utilization, surface active sites and material transportation through the framework walls. This specific synergy significantly contributes to the remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres under simulated sunlight (AM1.5).
1. Introduction
In recent years, the steadily growing energy crisis has directed a global trend toward sustainable development.1–3 Access to alternative clean energy is expected to make a considerable contribution. Solar induced water splitting has been considered as one of the most attractive routes because of its potential for hydrogen and oxygen production without the use of fossil fuel energy.4–6 The major challenge for water splitting is oxygen evolution, which is an uphill reaction involving a four-electron transfer process, so the research on photocatalytic oxygen evolution has recently been intensified as it serves as the key step for the artificial overall water splitting.7–10 Currently, most of the effective water oxidation catalysts contain the noble metals iridium and ruthenium as active species, which limits their widespread application.11–15 Considering practical applications, apart from simple metal oxides (Fe2O3, WO3, MnOx,), complicated binary and ternary oxides, such as, Co-g-C3N4, LaTiO2N14, RTiNO2, Co3O4/SiO2, have also been investigated.16–18 However, until now, the efficiency of photocatalytic water oxidation is still moderate, which restricts extremely its practical application. Thus, tremendous efforts are still needed to improve the catalytic performance.
In recent years, titanium based perovskite oxides such as ATiO3 (A = Zn, Sr, Co, Fe and Ni) have been identified as significant catalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of toxic pollutants, and photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen production.19–23 For example, CoTiO3 could be regarded as visible light-driven photocatalyst for water oxidation.24 SrTiO3 was used as a photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.25,26 NiTiO3 and FeTiO3 exhibited high visible light photocatalytic activity in the removal of organic pollutants.27–30 But as far as we know, FeTiO3 and its composites have not been applied for photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water splitting. Inspired by previous studies on other titanium based perovskite oxides for photocatalytic water oxidation, it is expected that the synthesis and application of FeTiO3 for photocatalytic water oxidation will be explored. Because the improved interface transfer rate of charge carriers can play a prominent role in promoting the water oxidation rate, coupling of FeTiO3 with a wide bandgap semiconductor (e.g. TiO2) with a proper valence band position may be expected to construct FeTiO3-based heterostructure composites and improve the transfer of photogenerated holes from FeTiO3 to the wide bandgap semiconductor, thus contributing to the enhancement of the photocatalytic oxidation ability.31 It is known that the morphology and structure are important factors influencing the photocatalytic water oxidation properties of semiconductor photocatalysts.32 Owing to their special properties (low density, large surface area and high light-harvesting efficiency), the hollow micro-/nano-structure offers some potential for photocatalytic application.33 To this end, Wang and coworkers have carried out lots of significant works to synthesize hollow carbon nitride nanospheres to develop functional photosynthetic structures for solar energy applications.34 Motivated by the high photocatalytic performance of hollow spheres, it is expected that the synthesis of hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres will achieve enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation activity under simulated sunlight irradiation by reducing the recombination rate of the charge carriers, decreasing the energy barrier of the water oxidation kinetics, enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency and increasing surface catalytic active sites.
In the present study, we summarized our recent efforts towards the facile synthesis and photocatalytic application of hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres. Different from the previously reported methods, hierarchical titanium–glycerolate–iron complex hollow sphere precursors were first prepared via a two-step sequential solvothermal processes, then, after calcination, the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres can be prepared. Changing the ratio of the molar of Ti and Fe added to the solution, hierarchical FeTiO3 hollow spheres can also be obtained. The novel hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres showed enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation performance and excellent recycling stability. We also demonstrated well-designed synergistic effects in the photocatalysts, including the semiconductor heterojunction effect and the matched energy level position, as well as the advantages of the special hierarchical hollow structure, which could promote efficiently the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and the transfer across the interfacial domain. As expected, the optimal hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow sphere photocatalytic system exhibited ∼2-fold enhancement in photocatalytic oxygen production as compared to pure FeTiO3.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres
In a typical experiment, 0.7 mL tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and 5 mL glycerol (Gly) were dissolved in 25 mL ethanol to form a clear solution, then the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 180 °C and kept at this temperature for 24 h. After the solvothermal reaction, the reactor was naturally cooled to room temperature. The obtained solid product was transferred into another 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then, 0.8310 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 3 mL glycerol and 25 mL ethanol were added to the autoclave to mix the mixture well. The autoclave containing the mixed solution was then heated to 180 °C and maintained for 12 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. The precipitate was washed three times with absolute ethanol and dried at 70 °C in air. The resulting green powders were calcined in static air at 550 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, and FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres were obtained. Similarly, FeTiO3 hollow spheres can be prepared by adjusting the mole ratio of Ti and Fe.
2.2. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the samples were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance using a Cu Kα radiation source (40 kV, 44 mA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 electron probe microanalyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out with a JEOL 2100 TEM microscope operated at 200 kV. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis was performed on a VG ESCALABMK II with a Mg Kα achromatic X-ray source (1253.6 eV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were determined by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of as-prepared samples were conducted using a Micromeritics Tristar II. The fluorescence spectra (PL) of the samples at room temperature were characterized via fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 315 nm induced from a He–Cd laser source to excite the samples. The XAFS data at the Ti and Fe K3-edge were measured at room temperature in transmission mode at beamline BL14W1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China.
2.3. Electrochemical test
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance (EIS) experiments were obtained with a Versa STAT3 electrochemical workstation in a conventional three-electrode cell. FTO was the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was the reference electrode, and a platinum wire with a 2 cm2 surface area served as the counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared on FTO glass that was cleaned by sonication in water, acetone and ethanol for 30 min respectively and dried at 333 K. Five milligrams of catalyst were mixed with 1 mL of ethanol by sonication to give a slurry mixture. The slurry was spread onto pretreated FTO glass. After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 373 K for 2 h to improve adhesion. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH aqueous solution without additive (pH 14). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1.The reference was calibrated against and converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All the tests were carried out at room temperature (about 25 °C).
2.4. Photocatalytic water oxidation test
The photocatalytic O2 evolution from water was conducted in an online photocatalytic oxygen production system (AuLight, Beijing, CEL-SPH2N). For each reaction, 50 mg of catalyst powder was well dispersed in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing AgNO3 (0.01 M) as an electron acceptor. The reaction was carried out by irradiating the suspension with light from a 300 W Xe lamp (AuLight, CEL-HXF-300, Beijing) lamp with a working current of 15 A. The wavelength of the incident light was controlled by applying some appropriate long-pass cutoff filters. Prior to the reaction, the mixture was deaerated by evacuation to remove O2 and CO2 dissolved in water. Gas evolution was observed only under photoirradiation, being analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP7800, TCD, molecular sieve 5 Å, N2 carrier, Beijing Keruida Limited).
Apparent quantum yield (A.Q.Y.) was measured using a 420 nm, 450 nm and 520 nm band-pass filter and an irradiate-meter, and calculated according to the following equation:  
2.5. Photocatalytic degradation test
The photodegradation experiments were performed in a slurry reactor containing 100 mL of 50 mg L−1 2,4-dichlorophenol and 0.05 g of catalyst. A 300 W xenon lamp (Institute of Electric Light Source, Beijing) was used as the solar-simulated light source, and visible light was achieved by 420 nm cutoff filter. Prior to light irradiation, the suspension was kept in the dark under stirring for 30 min to ensure the establishing of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Adequate aliquots (5 mL) of the sample were withdrawn after periodic intervals of irradiation, and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min, then filtered through a Milipore filter (pore size 0.22 mm) to remove the residual catalyst particulates for analysis.
In order to detect the active species during the photocatalytic reaction, isopropanol (IPA), ammonium oxalate (AO), benzoquinone (BQ) and AgNO3 were added into the 2,4-dichlorophenol solution dispersed with the FeTiO3–TiO2 heterostructures photocatalyst to capture hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+), superoxide radicals (˙O2−), and the electrons (e−), respectively, followed by the photocatalytic activity test.
The electron spin resonance (ESR) technique (with DMPO) was used to detect the ˙O2− radical species over the catalyst on a Bruker EMX-8/2.7 spectrometer by accumulating three scans at a microwave frequency of 9.85 GHz and a power of 6.35 mW. Before testing, DMPO was added to the suspension system, and then the system was irradiated by visible light using a halogen tungsten lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm).
A total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (Analytik Jena, Multi N/C 2100S, Germany) was employed for mineralization degree analysis of the dye solutions. Prior to injection into the TOC analyzer, the samples were filtrated with a Millipore filter. All experiments were carried out at least in duplicate. The reported values were within the experimental error range of ±3%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and composition characterization
As shown in Fig. 1A, the typical characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 were detected at 2θ = 25.4° (101), 37.9° (004) and 48.1° (200) when no Fe salt was added in the reaction system. With the gradual introduction of Fe salt, the XRD diffraction peaks of FeTiO3 located at 2θ = 23.79° (012), 32.51° (104), 35.25° (110), 40.27 (113) and 53.02 (116) can be found in the different products.29 Meanwhile, superimposition XRD patterns of TiO2 and FeTiO3 can be observed in the case of FeTiO3–TiO2 samples (curve b–d), which demonstrates the integration of these two compositions with high purity and good crystallization. Moreover, with the decrease of the molar ratio of Ti and Fe, the intensity ratio of XRD diffraction peaks of TiO2 and FeTiO3–TiO2 also gradually decreased, indicating the increase of the FeTiO3 content in the composites. When the molar ratio of Ti and Fe is 1:1, pure FeTiO3 can be prepared.

The morphology and microstructure of the FeTiO3 and FeTiO3–TiO2 (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75) composite were investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2A and B shows the SEM and TEM images of the FeTiO3. As expected, these spheres are hollow structures with particle diameters of about 0.5–1 μm. Meanwhile, as revealed in Fig. 2D and E, the obtained FeTiO3–TiO2 also kept the hierarchical hollow structure, which clearly demonstrates that the hollow structure has a shell consisting of interconnected nanoflakes with a thickness of about 15 nm. The nanopores in the shell were proven to be interconnected from Fig. 2B and E. A specific surface area as large as about 45–65 m2 g−1 and a broad pore size distribution in thehollow spheres measured from the N2 adsorption–desorption curves (Fig. S1 and Table S1†) also supported the TEM observations. The corresponding HRTEM image in Fig. 2C showing lattice fringes corresponding to the interplanar distance of 0.253 nm is ascribed to the (110) plane of rhombohedral FeTiO3.29Fig. 2F depicts the spacings of adjacent lattice planes, which are consistent with the interplanar distance (0.253 nm) of the (110) plane of rhombohedral phase of FeTiO3 and the interplanar distance (0.352 nm) of the (101) plane of anatase TiO2, respectively, indicating the formation of heterojunctions, which can benefit better charge separation and transfer within the hybrid structure compared with pure FeTiO3 and TiO2.

In order to disclose the morphology evolution and growth mechanism of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres, the SEM images of the FeTiO3–TiO2 precursors obtained at different reaction stages are shown in Fig. S2.† The morphology evolution from nanoflowers to hierarchical hollow spheres can be clearly seen. Based on the above results, the possible growth pattern and formation mechanism of hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow sphere precursors is shown in Scheme 1. The formation process includes two-step sequential solvothermal reactions. In the first solvothermal reaction process, amorphous titanium oxyhydrate nanospheres were formed first through alcoholysis reactions between TBOT and ethanol, then glycerol gradually reacted with the formed titanium oxyhydrate to form titanium glycerolate (Ti-Gly) flower-like complexes by replacing the hydroxyls in titanium oxyhydrate. This is a dissolution-recrystallization growth process. With the reaction going on, the growth of thorn-like Ti-Gly complexes continued at the expense of the gradual dissolution of the solid spheres, and finally the product was entirely composed of the hierarchical flower-like nanostructure. The XRD pattern of the precursor is shown in Fig. S3a,† which is in agreement with our previous report.35 In the following solvothermal process, with the addition of iron salt, further solvothermal reaction led to the formation of Ti-Gly–Fe complexes from the outer surface to the inside, and the formed complexes diffused spontaneously toward the outer surface. The XRD patterns of the Fe-Gly–Ti complex in Fig. S3b and c† show several sharp peaks at the low angle region and several weak ones at the high angle region, which is similar to that of the reported metal glycerolate complexes.35 Continuation of this process gradually dissolved the core spheres, forming sequentially a hollow sphere structure. As a result of the Ostwald ripening process, small nanoflakes formed initially on the surface of the hollow spheres and gradually grew up into ultrathin nanoflakes which are interlaced each other with thin edges and perpendicular to the surface of the hollow spheres. Finally, the hierarchical hollow sphere precursors were formed. After calcination, these precursors changed into FeTiO3–TiO2 composites without changing the hierarchical hollow sphere structure. Changing the molar ratio of Ti and Fe to 1:1, pure hierarchical FeTiO3 hollow spheres can also be obtained.

The FeTiO3, TiO2 and FeTiO3–TiO2 samples were characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The experimental XANES and EXAFS data of Fe K edge X-ray absorption spectra of FeTiO3 and FeTiO3–TiO2 are plotted in Fig. 3C and D. The two samples bear a great similarity to each other. This shows that the load of TiO2 particles doesn't change the structure of FeTiO3. This might be ascribed to a concentration of TiO2 that was too low to affect the environment of Fe in FeTiO3. Fig. 3A displays the Ti K edge XANES of the different samples. The XANES spectrum of anatase TiO2 is similar to those found in the literature.36,37 No significant differences are detected in the pre-edge region, suggesting a similar local symmetry in all of them. The Ti K-edge XANES spectrum of FeTiO3–TiO2 is similar to that of FeTiO3, which suggests that FeTiO3 is the main component in the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite, consistent with XRD results. Fig. 3B shows the Fourier Transform EXAFS spectra of the Ti K-edge for different samples. The FT-EXAFS spectrum of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite is similar to that of pure FeTiO3. These results demonstrate that FeTiO3 in the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite has a local structure of FeTiO3. In comparison with pure FeTiO3, there is a reduction in the amplitude of FT peaks for the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite. It was also observed that there is some difference between FeTiO3–TiO2 and TiO2 with regard to the bond distance of Ti to first-shell O atoms, which implies the existence of structural differences other than the differences in the Debye–Waller factor alone. However, the bond distances of Ti to first-shell O atoms in FeTiO3–TiO2 composite are nearly the same as that in pure FeTiO3. This result indicates that the local structure of FeTiO3 particles can be stabilized to some extent in the presence of TiO2.
 Fig. 3  (A) and (C) are the X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of Ti K-edge and Fe K-edge spectra of the samples, respectively; (B) and (D) are the corresponding extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ti K-edge and Fe K-edge spectra of the samples, respectively. 
The elemental compositions, chemical status and the interaction of FeTiO3 and TiO2 were further investigated by XPS. From XPS survey spectra of the samples in Fig. 4A, the existence of the peaks of Ti 2p, Fe 2p and O 1s can be confirmed in the FeTiO3–TiO2 composites. In Fig. 4B, the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks of FeTiO3 can be identified at 711.01 eV and 724.61 eV, and slightly lower than those of FeTiO3–TiO2 located at 711.41 eV and 725.01 eV.38 The Ti 2p spectrum from TiO2 in Fig. 4C can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at binding energies of 464.30 eV and 458.50 eV, which are assigned to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 in the Ti4+ oxidation state, respectively. For the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite, the corresponding Ti 2p peaks located at 464.14 eV and 458.34 eV. The slight shift of the peaks can be attributed to the interaction between FeTiO3 and TiO2 in the composite due to the formation of the heterostructure.39,40 On the other hand, the O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 4D of the samples can deconvoluted into two peaks. The first peak can be bound to lattice oxygen (O atoms bound to Ti and Fe). The second one is associated with hydroxyl species. The predominant O 1s peaks in TiO2, FeTiO3 and FeTiO3–TiO2 are 530.6, 530.1 and 529.6 eV, respectively. For the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite, the interaction between FeTiO3 and TiO2 resulted in the binding energy (530.1 eV) of O 1s in the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite to be larger than that in the FeTiO3 and lower than that in the TiO2. The results indicated the heterostructure between FeTiO3 and TiO2 in the composite was formed upon calcination, and the electronic coupling between them was strengthened.

The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 5A. It can be seen that the absorption of the TiO2 was located in the ultraviolet region, and the absorption wavelength was about 380 nm. However, compared with pure TiO2, the absorption spectra of FeTiO3 and hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres extend from the UV to visible light region in contrast to pure TiO2. The extended photoresponse range, which came from FeTiO3 with the bandgap of about 2.5 eV, accounted for the red shift as well. Moreover, a fair enhancement of the photo-absorption intensity of the TiO2 in the range of 400–600 nm could be noticed with the increase of FeTiO3 content, which indicated that the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres have the potential ability for visible-light photocatalysis.

The PL emission spectra are used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration, transfer and separation and to understand the fate of photogenerated electrons and holes in semiconductors since PL emission results from the recombination of free carriers.41,42Fig. 5B presents a comparison of the PL spectra of the different samples. For TiO2 and FeTiO3–TiO2 composites, the PL peaks at 450 and 530 nm are attributed to band edge free excitons.43 A considerable fluorescence decrease (or quenching) is observed. The order of PL intensities is opposite to the following photocatalytic activity studies. The suppression of PL implies either a slower recombination process with longer decay lifetime or a faster migration process with a shorter decay lifetime for photoinduced electrons.44 This indicates that the FeTiO3–TiO2 composites have a relatively low recombination rate of electrons and holes under UV light irradiation. Generally, a low recombination rate of electrons and holes is often associated with high photocatalytic activity.
3.2. Photogenerated charge properties
It is widely known in photocatalysis that the photocatalytic activity of a material is closely related to the behavior of photogenerated charges.45 Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) can effectively reflect the information about the separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers, so the surface photovoltage technique was employed to characterize the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers in the system.46 As shown in Fig. 6A, for single FeTiO3 and TiO2, the obtained SPS response bands show a positive signal in the range of 320–600 nm and 300–420 nm, respectively, which were due to the band–band transition (electrons transition from valence band to conduction band).43 There was no SPS response for TiO2 under visible light irradiation. However, the FeTiO3–TiO2 composites displayed a similar SPS response range to FeTiO3 suggesting that the photovoltage response of composites in the visible region mainly resulted from FeTiO3. Under visible light irradiation, the response intensity of pure FeTiO3 was weaker than the response intensity of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composites. Because the photovoltage response intensity was related to the charge separation efficiency, it signified that a stronger SPS response intensity resulted in a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charges. We speculated that there was an interfacial electric field in the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite formed during the calcination process. A positive signal means photoinduced holes accumulate at the surface, which indicates that the photoinduced holes move to the surface.47 The response intensity of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75) was higher than that of pure FeTiO3 or TiO2 because the existence of an interfacial electric field enhances the separation of photoinduced charges.47 Because the separation efficiency of photoinduced charge was one of the most important factors which influence the photocatalytic activity, it was reasonable to deduce that the fast injection of photogenerated holes from FeTiO3 into TiO2 contributed to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composites.
 Fig. 6  (A) Steady-state surface photovoltage spectra and (B) transient-state surface photovoltage responses of the different samples in air, (a) FeTiO3–TiO2 (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75), (b) FeTiO3–TiO2 (Ti:Fe = 1:0.5), (c) FeTiO3, and (d) TiO2. 
The corresponding transient-state photovoltage (TPV) responses of the samples shown in Fig. 6B indicated that the transient-state photovoltage response of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite is obviously enhanced compared to that of pure FeTiO3 and TiO2. This is in good agreement with the steady-state photovoltage spectroscopy response. It is worth noting that the lifetime of the photogenerated charge was also prolonged by several seconds. On the basis of the obviously enhanced surface photovoltage responses and the prolonged photogenerated charge lifetime, it is confirmed that the separation of photogenerated charge carriers of the FeTiO3–TiO2 composite could be considerably improved by coupling with a proper amount of nanocrystalline TiO2.47
3.3. Photocatalytic activity for water oxidation
The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres was evaluated in an assay of the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. As we know, the morphology and components of photocatalysts have great influence on their photocatalytic properties.48 Herein, we first focus our studies on the component-dependent photocatalytic oxygen evolution properties of the prepared samples. Fig. 7A shows the oxygen evolution on FeTiO3, TiO2, and FeTiO3–TiO2 catalysts. It is clear that the oxygen evolution rates of the composites are dramatically increased because of the existence of TiO2. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution on the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres is increased to a maximum when the elemental ratio of Ti to Fe is 1:0.75. The photocatalytic activity is increased by up to 2 times, compared with that for pure FeTiO3 hollow spheres. This unambiguously indicates that the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres can act as an efficient photocatalyst for oxygen evolution from water oxidation.

Moreover, long-time-course water oxidation experiments were carried out under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5) and visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7B, when the reaction time is 6 h, the oxygen evolution values of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75) under AM 1.5 irradiation and visible light irradiation are 245 μmol and 151.8 μmol, respectively, indicating its high photocatalytic oxygen evolution ability. Meanwhile, it could be recognized that the photocatalytic activity was linear at the early period and gradually decreased after irradiation for about 2 h. It should be noted that this phenomenon is not related to bad stability but is caused by the light shielding effect of photodeposited Ag particles, as has been reported by pioneering studies.49 In reuse tests (Fig. 7C), although the rate of oxygen evolution is slightly decreased, the average oxygen evolution rate of the fourth cycle can reach 36 μmol h−1. The results indicate the high activity and good reusability of FeTiO3–TiO2 for photocatalytic oxygen evolution. Since the FeTiO3 hollow spheres and the FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres have similar morphology and UV–vis absorption, their different photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance should be attributed to their component differences. The formation of the heterojunction between FeTiO3 and TiO2 in the FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres effectively enhanced charge separation and transport, thus improving the photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance.50
We also evaluated the oxygen evolution rate of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres under different specific wavelength illuminations. As shown in Fig. 8A, the oxygen evolution rate of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres is associated with the DRS absorption spectra. The oxygen evolution rate of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres at 365 nm is 58 μmol h−1, which is much larger than that at 420 (40 μmol h−1), 450 (24 μmol h−1), and 520 nm (14 μmol h−1). This indicates that UV light is the main contributor to the high photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5), and the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction is indeed promoted by light irradiation. In the visible light region, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of FeTiO3–TiO2 is about 9.1% at 420 nm, 2.3% at 450 nm and 0.6% at 520 nm. The apparent quantum yield decreased with increasing active wavelength and the lowest value of 0.2% was detected at 600 nm. It indicates the oxygen evolution reaction of the samples is associated with the DRS absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 7C, the high oxygen yield with hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres was maintained even after the 4th run in 24 h. Their structure and morphology were indeed stable after repeated photocatalytic runs, and no significant change was observed (Fig. S4†).

(B) Schematic illustration for the enhanced photogenerated charge carriers separation and transfer in the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5). 
For the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres, under simulated sunlight irradiation, the photogenerated electrons in the valence bands (VB) of FeTiO3 and TiO2 transfer to the corresponding conduction bands, and then the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 can transfer to the conduction band of FeTiO3 due to their relatively high position. Meanwhile, the holes in the valence band of FeTiO3 transfer to that of TiO2.29,30 The transfer process of these photogenerated charges reduces electron–hole recombination and maintains the requisite electron–hole populations required for photocatalytic reactions. Then the holes in the valence band of TiO2 can participate in photocatalytic water oxidation reactions (Fig. 8B).30 For photocatalytic water oxidation, the most important factor deciding the photocatalytic efficiency is likely to be the surviving fraction of long-lived photogenerated holes under photoirradiation.51 In this photocatalytic oxidation process, more photoinduced holes accumulated on the surface of FeTiO3–TiO2, so the optimal FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres exhibited significant enhancement in photocatalytic oxygen production. This inference can be evidenced by the above photoluminescence (Fig. 5B), surface photovoltage (SPS) and transient-state photovoltage (TPV) (Fig. 6) characterizations of the optimal FeTiO3–TiO2 (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75) hollow spheres. The control experiment was also done to demonstrate the structure-induced enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres using the crushed sample as photocatalyst. It is clear that the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres exhibited superior photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity over the crushed FeTiO3–TiO2 sample (Fig. S5†). The observed enhancement of photocatalytic activity, in comparison with the crushed sample, could be attributed to the more efficient multiple reflections of simulated sunlight (AM1.5) and the increased quantity of photogenerated electrons and holes available to participate in the photocatalytic water oxidation reactions.
To help clarify this issue, some photoelectrochemical characterisation was carried out. Fig. 9A shows a comparison of the polarization curves of the above three samples. The positive current in the range of 1.4–1.8 V vs. RHE can be ascribed to oxygen evolution.10 The current onset voltage of the FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres in the dark is slightly shifted to a lower potential after coupling with TiO2. It is beneficial for promoting multiple-electron water oxidation kinetics and avoiding excessive driving potentials.52 Moreover, it can be found that the photocurrent of the FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres increased along with the introduction of the proper amount of TiO2. The optimal hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 (Ti:Fe = 1:0.75) hollow spheres exhibited the highest photocurrent density. Hence, it can be deduced that the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres showed effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. We also carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, which are an effective method for evaluating the internal resistance of the charge transportation process of electrode materials. The EIS Nyquist plots of the different samples are shown in Fig. 9B. It can be seen that the observed arc radii of the FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres are slightly decreased after coupling with an appropriate amount of TiO2, indicating that its charge transfer resistance is somewhat smaller.53 Both of the electrochemical results imply that the formation of a heterojunction between FeTiO3 and TiO2 accelerates the charge carrier separation and migration, and thus promotes the heterogeneous photocatalytic water oxidation process.

Visible light photodecomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol was also performed to further prove the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres and the role of the holes in the photocatalytic oxidation process. As shown in Fig. 10A, the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres displayed significantly improved visible light photocatalytic performance compared to pure FeTiO3 and TiO2. In this photocatalytic reaction process, hole (h+) and ˙O2− play a decisive role in the performance enhancement, and both of them are the main oxidizing species. The ESR spin-trap technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was employed to ascertain the ˙O2− species in the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres degradation system in methanol solution under visible-light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S6,† six characteristic peaks with an intensity similar to that of DMPO–˙O2− adducts were observed only under visible-light irradiation, which is consistent with other studies for ˙O2− adducts.54 These ESR results confirm that ˙O2− radicals exist in the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres system under visible-light irradiation. In contrast, no such signals were detected in the dark. Meanwhile, the reactive species trapping experiments were also conducted. As shown in Fig. 10B, the addition of AgNO3 and isopropanol (IPA) in the 2,4-dichlorophenol solution has little effect on the photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres. Conversely, the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol is obviously inhibited after the addition of ammonium oxalate (AO) and benzoquinone (BQ). Especially in the presence of ammonium oxalate (AO), the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol is the worst. It indicated that holes (h+) play a major role in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. In addition, the total organic carbon (TOC) results (Fig. S7†) proved that the hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres possessed very high mineralization ability. Together with the results of the photocatalytic oxygen evolution tests, the prepared hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres have great potential in solar energy capture and conversion.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres via a two-step sequential solvothermal processes and following calcination. The as-prepared hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres have shown enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation activity as well as excellent stability. This work confirms that the heterojunctions formed between these two kinds of semiconductors (FeTiO3 and TiO2) effectively promote the charge transfer. The photoinduced holes on the FeTiO3 rapidly localize to the TiO2, and therefore promote the oxygen evolution ability compared to the pure FeTiO3 sample. Our results simultaneously suggest that the particular hierarchical porous hollow structure plays a positive role in the enhancement of light utilization, effective increase in catalyst surface active sites and material transportation. It is believed that these research results can provide useful information for the design of an optimal semiconductor that would combine the ability to dissociate water molecules with a proper band gap that absorbs solar light while retaining high stability.
