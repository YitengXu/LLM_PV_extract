    First published on 20th August 2012AbstractEndohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs), a new class of hybrid molecules formed by encapsulation of metallic species inside fullerene cages, exhibit unique properties that differ distinctly from those of empty fullerenes because of the presence of metals and their hybridization effects via electron transfer. This critical review provides a balanced but not an exhaustive summary regarding almost all aspects of EMFs, including the history, the classification, current progress in the synthesis, extraction, isolation, and characterization of EMFs, as well as their physiochemical properties and applications in fields such as electronics, photovoltaics, biomedicine, and materials science. Emphasis is assigned to experimentally obtained results, especially the X-ray crystallographic characterizations of EMFs and their derivatives, rather than theoretical calculations, although the latter has indeed enhanced our knowledge of metal–cage interactions. Finally, perspectives related to future developments and challenges in the research of EMFs are proposed. (381 references)

1. Historical introduction
Carbon, the sixth element in the periodic table and the sixth most abundant element in the universe, plays an important role in human society. It is the only element associated clearly with the origin of life, forming millions of organic molecules that are building blocks of amino acids and proteins. Carbon (dioxide) has also become a popular term in relation to environmental and economic issues.
In addition to the two naturally occurring, well-known allotropes of elemental carbon, graphite and diamond, a third was discovered by Curl, Kroto, Smalley and co-workers in 1985.1 Based on preliminary experimental evidence, they proposed a soccer-ball-like spherical structure of C60 and named it buckminsterfullerene, which has been truncated to fullerene. The proposed closed-cage structure was later confirmed by concrete experimental evidence, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) results.2 Because of this significant discovery, Kroto, Curl and Smalley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996. However, the pure carbon nature of fullerenes and their cage-like structure make it difficult to propose an IUPAC nomenclature; the recently proposed one is too complicated to be generalized.3,4 Consequently, the term fullerene is still widely used.
The unique spherical structure of fullerenes, full of pi-electrons on the surface, produces numerous fascinating properties. As the only molecular allotrope of elemental carbon, fullerenes undergo various chemical transformations and validate accurate characterization of their molecular structures and physiochemical properties.5 During the past two decades, hundred different chemical reactions have been performed on fullerenes, generating a sub-branch of organic chemistry known as fullerene chemistry. Nowadays, many useful materials based on fullerenes have been generated, with applications in biology, medicine, electronics, and photovoltaics.6
More interestingly, the fullerene interior can host atoms, molecules, and metal clusters of many types, forming a new family of hybrid materials known as endofullerenes.7 Different synthetic methods have been invented to generate compounds encapsulating various different species. Endofullerenes encapsulating a group-5-atom (N or P) or an inert gas atom were obtained under high-temperature–high-pressure conditions,8,9 while a molecular surgery strategy proved to be effective for the insertion of different molecules such as H2, NH3, and H2O inside the fullerene cavity.10–12 In these cases, no obvious communication between the internal elements and the fullerene cage was observed, thereby providing a unique platform for investigating the behavior of isolated molecules (especially H2O).13,14 However, to put metal atoms inside such a cage, harsher conditions are necessary. A modified plasma method was designed to produce such compounds with an alkali metal inside C60.15 The direct-current arc discharge method originally invented for the macroscopic synthesis of empty fullerenes is particularly effective to produce endofullerenes with metals other than alkali metals, namely, group 2, 3, 4 elements,16 but in the early days, laser ablation was used instead but was soon abandoned because of its high cost and low output.17 Such species with entrapped metals are particularly attractive because the metal atoms interact strongly with the fullerene cage, thereby making the resulting molecules quite unique. This new family of metal–carbon materials is commonly called endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs).7
This review specifically examines EMFs for the following reasons: (i) the electron transfer from the internal metallic species to the cage carbon atoms makes such hybrid molecules an ideal platform for investigating the behavior of isolated metal ions or clusters; (ii) the production yield of EMFs is generally higher than that of other endofullerenes, making EMFs more promising for use in future applications; and (iii) the presence of metals brings huge potential applications of EMFs which are absent from empty fullerenes and endofullerenes with non-metals.
Actually, the existence of EMFs was predicted soon after the discovery of the famous C60, as demonstrated experimentally in a pioneering work by the late Smalley and co-workers in 1985.18 Until 1991, however, macroscopic synthesis of EMFs was achieved and the first solvent extraction of La-EMFs was described by the Smalley group.19 Thereafter, great effort has been devoted to encaging metals of different kinds inside fullerenes using the most effective arc discharge method. However, the results revealed that only rare-earth metals and nearby elements (groups 2, 3, 4) can form EMFs macroscopically.20 It is still not so clear why other elements do not form EMFs in reasonable yields.
As Fig. 1 shows, the elements that can form endofullerenes are highlighted in color. Non-metallic elements such as N, P and inert gases can be put into C60 in their atomic form.9,21 Molecules such as H2O, NH3, and CO have also been trapped in open-caged fullerenes.22 For EMFs, it is worth noting that rare-earth elements, especially Sc, invariably give rise to the corresponding EMF species in higher yield than other metals, such as alkali-earth metals and group 4 metals (Ti, Zr, etc.). Accordingly, EMFs containing rare-earth metals have received more attention. Moreover, because rare-earth elements are the mainstay of many optical, magnetic, and electronic applications, such materials are particularly promising in future applications.20

2. Classification
Electron transfer from the encapsulated metallic species to the fullerene cage takes place in EMFs, rendering the cage structures and physico-chemical properties of these hybrid materials completely different from those of empty fullerenes. Because of this novel electron-transfer feature, it is now acknowledged that EMFs are classifiable into three types according to the form of the encapsulated species: mono-EMFs, di-EMFs, and cluster-EMFs. Some are further divided into several sub-branches depending on the composition of the internal metals (vide infra).
2.1 Mono-EMFs
All the metal elements highlighted in Table 1 reportedly give mono-EMFs. However, other metals, especially those transition metals and noble metals that show marked catalytic properties in numerous chemical transformations, cannot be capsulated inside fullerenes. It is considered that their outstanding catalytic ability disables the formation of fullerene cages.

For common mono-EMFs, either two or three electrons are transferred from the internal metal to the cage. Therefore, mono-EMFs include trivalent mono-EMFs and divalent mono-EMFs. Except for alkali-earth metals and Sm, Eu, Tm, and Yb, all other rare-earth metals transfer three electrons to the fullerene cage when forming mono-EMFs. Accordingly, they are called trivalent EMFs.23–25 Divalent mono-EMFs encapsulate Sm, Eu, Tm, Yb, and alkali-earth metals, which donate only two of their valence electrons to the fullerene cage.26–28 A marked phenomenon is that divalent EMFs are invariably much less abundant than trivalent ones, as described in numerous reports.29
In addition to the numerous types of metal elements that can form mono-EMFs macroscopically, the cage size and structure of isolated species are also diverse. Although M@C28 (M = Ti, Zr, U) has recently been identified robust in gas phase,30 the smallest mono-EMF that has received single-crystal XRD characterization is C72, namely, La@C2(10612)-C72,31 which has a cage structure with a pair of fused-pentagons violating the so-called isolated pentagon rule (IPR).32 The largest ones are M@C3v(134)-C94 (M = Ca, Tm, Sm).33 Among all mono-EMFs obtained to date, the M@C2v(9)-C82 (M = Sc, Y, La, Ce, etc.) species are generally more abundant than others and accordingly have been investigated more intensively.34 Recently, a novel mono-EMF Li+@C60 was obtained by an improved ion implantation method and its molecular structure was firmly established with single crystal XRD crystallographic studies (vide infra).35
2.2 Di-EMFs
EMFs with two metal atoms, di-EMFs, are generally less abundant than the corresponding mono-EMFs encapsulating the same type of metals. Moreover, the cages suitable for encapsulating two pure metals are completely different from those containing only one metal because the number of electrons transferred from metal to cage differs. The most abundantly obtained di-EMFs are M2@Ih(7)-C80 (M = La, Ce).36–38 Recently some larger ones such as Sm2@D3d(822)-C104 and La2@D5(450)-C100 were also isolated and structurally identified with crystallographic XRD measurements39–41 together with some small species such as La2@D2(10611)-C72, which has two pairs of fused pentagons violating the IPR.42–44
It has been an interesting finding that the two metals tend to rotate inside medium sized fullerenes such as C80 and C82. For example, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results37 of La2@Ih(7)-C80 and X-ray results45,46 of the two isomers of Er2@C82 both confirm the motional behavior of the two metals inside these medium-sized and ‘round’ cages. In contrast, XRD results of Sm2@D3d(822)-C104 and La2@D5(450)-C100 show that the two metals are fixed at each end of the tubular cage, pursuing long metal–metal distances.39,40 The motion of the two metals in a small cage is also confined, as in the cases of La2@D2(10611)-C72 and La2@D3h(3)-C78.47,48
EMFs with more than two pure metals have not been identified unambiguously. For example, a previously proposed tri-EMF, Sc3@C3v(7)-C82, has recently been unambiguously identified as a carbide cluster EMF, Sc3C2@Ih(7)-C80.49 This situation might be explained by considering strong repulsions among three or more tri-cations inside a small or medium fullerene cage (such as C60–C90). These metal cations always demand one or more non-metallic atoms to neutralize, partially, the positive charges by cluster formation. For instance, a recent report on the theoretical considerations of Y3@Ih(7)-C80 has been to put a pseudoatom into the cage to make it mimic the well-known Y3N@Ih(7)-C80 but unfortunately not any direct experimental evidence for the proposed structure is available, even only for the cage structure.50
2.3 Cluster-EMFs
To date, metallic clusters such as metal carbide, nitride, oxide, sulfide, and even cyanide have all been observed in EMFs. For metal elements such as Sc and Y, the isolated examples of cluster EMFs are far more numerous than those of the mono-EMFs and di-EMFs, which is expected to result from the strong coordination ability and small ionic radii of these metals.51 However, large metal elements such as La3+ and Ce3+ are hard to form cluster-EMFs efficiently.

Metal nitride cluster EMFs. 
Nitride cluster EMFs were first reported in 1999 by Dorn and co-workers as a result of accidental leakage of air (or nitrogen) into the arc discharge chamber.52 Because the internal metallic species invariably have the formula of M3N, such compounds are also designated as the trimetallic nitride template (TNT) family. Several features underscore the importance of TNT–EMFs. First, one of its members, Sc3N@Ih(7)-C80, represents as the third most abundant compound in the fullerene family.53,54 Second, such species are generally more stable than the EMFs of other types.55,56 Furthermore, the cage size and structure are highly dependent on the metal cation radius (i.e. the size of the encapsulated metal cluster). For these species involving smaller rare-earth atoms such as Sc, Y and lanthanides from Gd to Lu, M3N@C80 is always the most abundant,57,58 whereas larger M3N clusters prefer larger cages: Nd, Pr and Ce template a C88 cage,59 and the largest, La3N, prefers a C96 cage.60 However, the production yield of the corresponding EMFs decreases remarkably with increasing cage size. Interestingly and somehow surprisingly, nitride cluster EMFs containing divalent metals, such as alkali-earth metals or either of Sm, Eu, and Yb, have not been observed.
Recently, nitride cluster EMFs containing a non-group-3 metal, namely titanium, were also produced in a relatively low production yield.61 Experimental results and calculations of the isolated Sc2TiN@C80 indicate that the metals all adopt the +3 valence state, resulting in an unpaired electron localized on Ti3+.62 Analogues such as Y2TiN@C80 were also reported recently.63
Metal cyanide cluster EMFs were also obtainable similarly.64,65 For example, a recent work reported the isolation and complete characterization of Sc3NC@Ih(7)-C80 including the XRD crystallographic study of its structure molecular.64 It was revealed that the encapsulated cluster is planar with the N atom in the center, while the three Sc atoms and the C atom surround it coplanarly. However, their calculation results indicated that the C atom should be in the center, instead of N, raising the necessity for future improvements of theoretical methods.


Metal carbide cluster EMFs. 
Another type of interesting cluster EMFs is carbide cluster EMFs, which are formed without the addition of any heterogeneous additive except the graphite rod and the metal source. Sc2C2@D2d(23)-C84 is the first example of carbide cluster EMFs,66 which was assumed as Sc2@C86 when isolated.67 Its carbide structure was confirmed by NMR and synchrotron radiation powder diffraction coupled with Rietveld treatment of the diffraction data and maximum entropy method analysis (SRPD/Rietveld/MEM) methods.66 Subsequently, numerous carbide cluster EMFs have been isolated and structurally identified. Among them, the species with the smallest cage is Sc2C2@C2v(6073)-C68, which was proposed to bear two pairs of fused pentagons.68 However, a recent theoretical consideration of this compound argued that it should be a di-EMF Sc2@C2v(7854)-C70 with three pairs of pentagons.69 The largest cage with a carbide cluster inside is reported for Gd2C2@D3(85)-C92 whose structure was firmly established with single-crystal XRD measurement.70 More carbide cluster EMFs have cage sizes between C80 and C84.
Surprisingly, several EMFs, that were originally proposed as di-EMFs or tri-EMFs in previous studies, have recently been identified as carbide EMFs. Such examples include Sc3C2@Ih(7)-C80 [not Sc3@C3v(7)-C82],49 Sc2C2@C2v(5)-C80 [not Sc2@C82],71,72 Sc2C2@Cs(6)-C82 [not Sc2@Cs(10)-C84],73 Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C82 [not Sc2@C2v(17)-C84],74 and Sc2C2@C3v(8)-C82 [not Sc2@D2d(23)-C84].75 Consequently, it is expected that future investigations will discover more carbide cluster species. In addition to elements such as Sc and Y with small ionic radii, large metal ions such as Er3+, Lu3+, and Gd3+ also reportedly form carbide cluster fullerenes, but these large clusters generally demand a larger fullerene cage to accommodate them.70,76 It is interesting to find that all these species contain at least two metal cations and exactly two carbon atoms to form the carbide cluster, so that it is expected that monometallic cluster EMFs will be discovered in the near future.


Metal oxide cluster EMFs. 
Initially in EMF research, oxygen was avoided as much as possible during the synthetic process because it reportedly decreased the yield of the corresponding EMFs.77 However, Stevenson and co-workers found that introducing a small amount of elemental oxygen (e.g. air) into the reactor led to the formation of several novel EMF species encapsulating metal oxide clusters of various types.
The first reported oxide cluster EMF was Sc4(μ3-)O2@Ih(7)-C80.78 Later, Sc2(μ2-)O@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc4(μ3-)O3@Ih(7)-C80 were obtained similarly.79,80 All these metal oxide cluster EMFs were characterized structurally with single-crystal XRD. It is noteworthy that some of these oxide clusters prefer the Ih(7)-C80 cage, indicating that the number of transferred electrons is also six, as in the case of nitride cluster EMFs.


Metal sulfide cluster EMFs. 
Similarly, sulfide cluster EMFs have also been synthesized by the introduction of sulfur into the discharge reactor. Using a solid sulfur source, Dunsch and coworkers synthesized novel EMFs containing a sulfide cluster (M2S) of various metals such as Sc, Y, Dy, and Lu. The molecular structures of the isolated Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 were characterized using several spectroscopic measurements in combination with theoretical calculations.81 Soon thereafter, Echegoyen et al. reported that a small amount of SO2 gas inside the reactor was also helpful to the formation of sulfide cluster EMFs.82 The isolated species were Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 and Sc2S@Cs(6)-C82, which were subsequently identified using XRD.83
In sulfide cluster EMFs, it is believed that four electrons are transferred from the cluster to the cage. Accordingly, both the cluster composition and the cage structure of sulfide cluster EMFs differ markedly from those of oxide EMFs which are characteristic of six-electron transfer, although sulfur and oxygen are both group 6 elements. However, the cage structures and cluster orientation of isolated sulfide cluster EMFs closely resemble those of some abundantly produced carbide cluster EMFs, predicting their similar physicochemical properties.
Typical EMFs that encapsulate different metallic species inside the fullerene cages of various sizes are illustrated in Fig. 2, which underscores the diversity of both the internal cores and the outer cage structures of EMFs.

2.4 Hetero EMFs (aza-EMFs)
It was suggested in theory that one or more carbon atoms in fullerene frameworks can be replaced with either boron or nitrogen atoms, but only nitrogen-substituted hetero-fullerenes were experimentally identified: aza-fullerenes.84,85 The most commonly encountered species of aza-fullerenes is C59N, which exists as a dimer because of its paramagnetic nature. Aza-EMFs were first reported by Akasaka et al. in 1997 when they used fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry to characterize EMF-derivatives such as La@C82NCH2Ph and La2@C80NCH2Ph.86 Molecular ion peaks due to aza-EMFs such as [La@C81N]+ and [La2@C79N]+ were readily observed as fragmentations from the derivatives. Calculations showed that the corresponding neutral molecules of these aza-EMFs, La@C81N, and La2@C79N can exist as monomers because the unpaired electron from the nitrogen has immigrated to the encapsulated metal(s).
In 2008, Dorn and co-workers reported the synthesis and X-ray structures of M2@C79N (M = Y, Tb).87 Unfortunately, because of the severe cage disorder in the crystal, it was not possible to assign the nitrogen position in the cage framework based on X-ray data. Calculations reveal that the isomer formed by substitution of a [665]-junction carbon with nitrogen is 13.3 kcal mol−1 more stable than the [666]-substituted isomer. More interestingly, ESR and calculations confirmed that the spin immigrated from the nitrogen atom is localized on the two equivalent yttrium center, exhibiting metal–metal bonding with a rather long Y–Y distance. Gd2@C79N was also obtained similarly and ESR results confirmed that the spin is localized on the center of the two Gd3+ ions. Interestingly, it shows an inert chemical property towards carbanions.88
Recently, an example of aza-EMFs encapsulating a nitride cluster, La3N@C79N, was also reported.89 This species is somehow surprising because the result of a previous study suggested that the large La3N tends to template a C96 cage instead of the small C80 cage.60 Exhaustive calculations reveal that N-substitution of a [665]-junction is more favorable. In all [665]-isomers, the spin also resides in the internal cluster. A distinct difference from the Y2@C79N system where the spin-containing orbital is below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is that the spin-containing orbital in all possible La3N@C79N isomers is just the HOMO.
3. Preparation of EMFs
Although great efforts have been devoted to the synthesis and isolation of EMFs, their availabilities are much less than C60 and C70. The procedures to obtain pure samples of EMFs generally involve three steps: synthesis, extraction, and isolation (Fig. 3). Briefly, raw soot containing fullerenes and EMFs of different kinds is produced using some production methods. Then the soot is collected and the soluble fractions are extracted with organic solvents or alternative treatments. Finally, the soluble species are separated using HPLC or some other technique to get pure samples which are subjected to the subsequent structural characterization or chemical functionalization. However, each step is more complicated than that for obtaining pure C60 or C70. For each step, we are giving more details in the following context, particularly addressing the achievements reported in the last five years.
 Fig. 3  Procedures necessary for obtaining pure samples of EMFs for subsequent treatments. 
3.1 Laser ablation
The first synthesis of EMFs was achieved by Smalley and co-workers using a laser ablation equipment. A composite graphite disc doped with lanthanum oxide was irradiated with laser in a quartz tube under an inert atmosphere. It was necessary to heat the tube to a temperature higher than 800 °C that ensured the formation of fullerenes and EMFs.17–19 However, this production method has been largely abandoned by researchers because of its high cost and low output efficiency. Sometimes it is still adopted to investigate the formation mechanisms of fullerenes species.90
3.2 Ion implantation
In 1996, Campbell and collaborators reported the synthesis of alkali-metal-containing EMFs by bombarding the deposited C60-film with ionized alkali-metals such as Li+, Na+, and K+ under vacuum.13 However, the production yield of this method is extremely low and the produced A+@C60 (A = Li+, Na+, K+etc.) tended to polymerize within the C60 matrix so that the product was difficult to be extracted with common organic solvents.91
Recently, an improved ion implantation method was reported jointly by several Japanese groups.35 They used Li+ plasma to attack the C60-films deposited on a metal plate. Upon chemical oxidation of the produced soot, a substantial amount of pure Li+@C60 was obtained and its molecular structure was established precisely by XRD crystallography. It is interesting to find that the Li+ ion is not located at the center of the cage but approaches closely to a hexagonal carbon ring. It is noteworthy that this method can only be used to produce the EMFs containing alkali-metal because it is still difficult to ionize other metals. Nevertheless, the related results are instructive to future works for selective and high-yield synthesis of EMFs. For example, if the metal plasma of various kinds can be generated efficiently, it would be helpful to increase the production yield and most probably such EMF species containing transition metals can be obtained.
3.3 Arc discharge
A direct-current (DC) arc discharge method has shown great success in obtaining empty fullerenes in large amounts, but it has been almost replaced by other more convenient methods such as combustion for the large-scale synthesis of empty fullerenes. However, this method remains as the most powerful and most convenient method for EMF production because it provides harsh enough experimental conditions for the ionization of the metal elements into the gas phase to form EMFs.

Fig. 4a and b portray a typical DC-arc discharge setup for the production of EMFs used in our lab and its schematic illustration, respectively. Briefly, a graphite anode doped with the desired metal is burned along with a graphite block or rod as the countered cathode in a chamber under a helium atmosphere. Many experimental parameters, such as the doping ratio, the helium pressure, and the working power, are found to be critical for the formation of different EMFs. Additionally, it has been an interesting phenomenon that most of the transition metals could not form EMFs during the discharge process but the use of some of them, e.g. Cu, Ni, and Fe, can enhance the yield of certain EMF species substantially.54,92

Doping the graphite rod with other additives or adding extra gaseous components into the chamber enables the generation of novel EMFs containing different clusters. By adding N2 or NH3 into the chamber, or by adding some nitrogen-containing compounds into the graphite rod, metal nitride cluster EMFs are readily producible.52,93,94 It is noteworthy that one of the hundreds of nitride cluster EMFs, i.e. Sc3N@C80, is particularly abundant among all EMFs produced to date, promising its brilliant future for applications in many fields. Recently, EMFs containing a metal oxide cluster of various types (Sc2O/Sc4O2/Sc4O3),78–80 a metal sulfide cluster (Sc2S)81,82 and even a metal cyanide cluster (Sc3NC) have all been synthesized by putting the corresponding heterogeneous additives into the reactor, while the formation of a metal carbide cluster (M2C2/M3C2/M4C2)49,66,95 was also achieved, but it is not necessary to introduce any hetero element into the chamber. It is particularly interesting that only scandium can give rise to all cluster EMFs described above, most probably because of its strong coordination ability, which favors the formation of various clusters, and the small ionic radius of Sc3+, which ensures that the formed clusters are small enough to be encapsulated inside normal fullerenes.
3.4 Extraction
Although DC arc discharge is the most effective method for EMF production, the yield is still low. In general, fullerene-related species (including EMFs) account for less than 10 wt% of the raw soot, whereas up to 90% is undesired amorphous carbons and other hydrocarbon materials.96 Moreover, the symbiotic empty fullerenes such as C60 and C70 invariably dominate the soot, so that the total weight percentage of EMFs is generally lower than 1%. To obtain pure isomers of EMFs (as well as empty fullerenes), these compounds must be extracted into solution and be separated with chromatography subsequently.

Solvent extraction. 
Because of the pi-electron-rich nature of fullerenes and EMFs, aromatic and non-polar solvents are particularly suitable for extraction of these compounds. Generally speaking, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) shows the highest affinity toward fullerene species, but it has not been commonly used until recently because of its high boiling point and toxicity. Alternatively, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), chlorobenzene, toluene (xylene, benzene), and CS2 are commonly used to extract fullerenes and EMFs. No matter which solvent is used, the contents of the soluble fraction are almost identical.97–102 Taking the CS2-extract of yttrium-containing soot as an example, mass spectrometric results show that empty fullerenes are the most abundant soluble species, which are dominated by C60, C70, and C84. For EMFs, two series of peaks corresponding to mono-EMFs (YC2n, n = 38–50) and di-EMFs or carbide cluster EMFs (Y2C2n) with the peak of Y@C82 being apparently the highest. Even with mass spectrometry, tri-EMFs are hardly detectable.103
Furthermore, N-containing solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and pyridine were found to be particularly affinitive to mono-EMFs, most probably by forming some unclear complexes.102,104–107 However, after evaporation of these solvents, the complexes decomposed and some of the EMF species, such as M@C60, remained insoluble in other non-polar solvents, which impedes further purification and characterization.


Electrochemical methods for the extraction of insoluble EMFs. 
Solvent extraction can only extract a limited percentage of the EMFs in soot, while most insoluble species remain in the extracted soot. It was believed that the solubility (sometimes also stability) of fullerenes and EMFs is highly dependent on their electronic properties. In principle, the bandgap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can serve as an indicator of the solubility for a given species. For example, the calculated bandgap of the insoluble C74 is only 0.05 eV, which makes it aggregated in the solid state while the readily soluble C60 has a much larger bandgap of 1.72 eV. As a direct result, methods attempting to alter the electronic properties of these insoluble species were invented to make them soluble and more extractable.
The first attempt was reported by Diener and Alford, who obtained a mixture of insoluble, small-bandgap fullerenes such as C74, Gd@C60, and Gd@C74 by electrochemical reduction of the sublimate of Gd-containing soot.108 Later, Bolskar and Alford reported a similar chemical oxidation approach for the selective enrichment of certain insoluble EMFs based on the sublimation of soot.109 These results were particularly exciting because they opened a door to industrial extraction of EMFs, most of which are not obtainable using the conventional solvent-extraction method. However, the main drawbacks of these methods are that (i) the soot must be sublimated before treatment to avoid the influence of the metal catalysts or other impurities; (ii) only enriched fractions of some insoluble EMFs are obtainable; and (iii) the ionic character of these compounds impedes further separation and structural characterization. Moreover, it is pity that no subsequent reproductions from other groups have been reported until now, which is most probably due to the critical conditions necessary for soot sublimation.


Chemical derivatization and extraction of insoluble EMFs. 
A derivatization strategy for the extraction of insoluble EMFs was reported recently by our groups in addition to oxidation/reduction methods. Upon TCB-extraction of La-containing soot, some insoluble species such as La@C2n (2n = 72–82) were functionalized by the trace dichlorophenyl radicals generated during refluxing.31,110–113 These dichlorophenyl derivatives were readily soluble not only in TCB but also in toluene which is the common HPLC eluent for isomeric separation of EMFs. Finally, pure samples of these EMF-derivatives were obtained. Their molecular structures were firmly established with single-crystal XRD crystallography. This might be a great achievement toward insoluble EMFs because previous studies succeeded only in obtaining the mixtures of some insoluble species in ionic forms and no structural information has been reported. More importantly, these results provided a new concept for altering the electronic properties and for enhancing the solubility of some insoluble species. Additionally, it should be pointed out that because the dichlorophenyl radicals only react with insoluble mono-EMFs with pronounced radical characters and cannot add to di-EMFs or cluster EMFs, different reagents and more efficient chemical transformations must be invented to access those insoluble species with multiple metals or metal clusters. Based on the fact that no corresponding derivatives of the soluble La-EMFs (e.g. La@C2v(9)-C82) have been detected, the reaction derivatization process might involve a hetero-phase catalytic process.

3.5 Isolation and purification
Even for soluble EMFs, many isomers coexist in the solvents. Chromatography is certainly the most efficient way to get pure isomers of some EMFs. However, because of the similarity of the cage structures and the numerous isomers in the solution, only high-performance-liquid chromatography (HPLC) shows a general power for the isolation of pure EMF isomers.

HPLC separation. 
Specially designed HPLC columns are necessary for the complete separation of typical isomers of EMFs and higher fullerenes. Six complementary HPLC columns are available commercially: PYE, PBB, NEP, Buckyprep, Buckyprep M, and Buckyclutcher (the last is seemingly not available anymore). They are useful for different purposes according to the size, structure, and properties of the fullerene species. For example, Buckyprep M is particularly suited to the separation of EMFs from empty fullerenes with similar cage sizes. PBB allows the use of CS2 or TCB as an eluent, either of which is superior to the generally used toluene for high ability of solvating EMFs. Several studies showed that the use of chlorobenzene as an eluent enables the isolation of some large fullerene cages with or without metals, such as Sm@C94, C94, and C96.114–116

Fig. 5 portrays a typical HPLC profile of the CS2-extract of Y-containing soot on a PYE column. For empty fullerene species, they pass through the column in accordance with their cage sizes: the smaller the cage, the shorter its retention time. EMFs generally have a longer retention time than the corresponding empty fullerenes having the same cage size because of the richer electronic property of the endohedrals. When a heavier cluster, such as Y2C2, which transfers more electrons to the cage is encapsulated, the resulting EMFs (e.g. Y2C2@C82) interact more strongly with the column stationary phase and accordingly have a longer retention time. Furthermore, the cage symmetry is also reflected by the retention time. Generally speaking, the higher the cage symmetry (meaning that the cage is rounder), the shorter the retention time on a PYE or a Buckyprep column is.

Obtaining pure EMFs without HPLC. 
The HPLC technique is expensive and the separation process is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to finding alternative solutions for the selective isolation of some particular EMFs. Recently, several successful results have been reported.
A chemical reduction method proposed in 2005 showed that a mixture of Gd@C82 and Gd2@C80 anions can be obtained directly by treating the raw soot with readily available reductants such as Al–Ni powder in THF–toluene. Furthermore, pure Gd2@C80 was obtainable merely by changing the ratio of the two solvents because the two EMF anions show different solubility in them.117
Based on the exceptionally high stability (low reactivity) and high yield of Sc3N@Ih(7)-C80, several practical strategies were proposed to isolate this special endohedral selectively. Dorn and coworkers invented a facile approach using a Merrifield resin functionalized with cyclopentadiene (CPD).118 The concept is depicted in Fig. 6a together with the corresponding results with Sc-EMFs as an example in Fig. 6b. When the toluene-extract passes through the column, empty fullerenes and conventional mono-/di-EMFs react with the resin, whereas Sc3N@C80 does not react and passes through the column. The species adhered to the resin could be recovered simply by heating in the presence of maleic anhydride (Fig. 6c). Afterwards, Stevenson et al. made an improvement of the Merrifield resin method. They replaced the expensive CPD-resin with silica gel containing amino functional groups and adopted a nonchromatographic process called the ‘Stir and Filter Approach’ (SAFA).119 The two methods are equally efficient for the selective isolation of A3N@C80 (A = Sc, Lu etc.). Now these compounds are commercially available. These achievements are important breakthroughs in EMF-separation because such methods are superior to the HPLC technique and are suitable for large-scale industrial production. An even simpler method utilizing Lewis acids (e.g. AlCl3 and FeCl3) as the reactant to precipitate the more reactive conventional EMFs and empty fullerenes was also reported recently, and comparable results were obtained.120 Actually, strong oxidants such as AlCl3 have also been used to separate Gd-EMFs from empty fullerenes in an earlier study.121

(right panel) HPLC (5PYE column) traces of (a) the toluene extract of “scandium soot”, (b) the eluent after passing though a column packed with CPD-resin; and (c) the recovered eluent from the column upon heating at 85 °C in the presence of maleic anhydride.

However, it should be pointed out that the isolation and purification processes of EMFs, especially these conventional species with low stabilities, are still too inefficient to yield a sufficient amount of pure samples for additional uses. A recent attempt using a Lewis acid (TiCl4) for the efficient separation of Gd-EMFs from empty fullerenes appears exciting and practical but unfortunately no absolute yield of the obtained products was mentioned.122

4. Structures of EMFs
4.1 Characterization methods: a collective comparison
The molecular structures of EMFs are more complicated than those of empty fullerenes because of the existence of the internal metallic species and their uncertain locations. As a direct result, structural elucidation of EMFs has persisted as an important but intractable issue in fullerene research.123 A great deal of effort has been devoted to finding solutions to their molecular structures.

Theoretical calculation. 
In the early stages of EMF research, calculations possessed distinct advantages in establishing their molecular structures over other experimental solutions because of the lack of sufficient samples and the difficulties in experimental characterizations.23,124–126 It gradually turned out that calculations are particularly suitable for predicting the relative stabilities of certain EMF species by simply considering the charge transfer from the encapsulated metals to the cage.7,127,128 Although earlier works have mainly focused on the conventional EMFs, recent concerns about nitride cluster EMFs have provided valuable information related to metal–cage interaction and molecular structures.50,129–138 A recent ‘maximum pentagon separation rule’ proposed by Poblet and coworkers is particularly outstanding.139 It stated that the pentagonal carbon rings on the fullerene cage tend to accumulate negative charges transferred from the internal metallic species. Consequently, they are separated to the greatest degree possible over the cage. Certainly this arrangement of pentagons also engenders the maximum separation of the positively charged internal metal cations and should be the most stable state of highly charged EMFs, such as nitride cluster EMFs. However, for mono-EMFs, this rule seems to be impractical, most probably because of the limited number of transferred electrons (2 or 3).140
Nevertheless, although calculations provide important information, experimental characterizations are particularly desirable.


Synchrotron radiation powder diffraction (SRPD)/Rietveld/MEM. 
This method is the earliest one used to confirm the endohedral nature of EMFs.141 For a typical measurement, a specimen of powder samples of EMFs is measured using synchrotron radiation and the results were treated with the Rietveld method to obtain suitable data for additional analysis. Finally, the maximum-entropy-method (MEM) was used to establish the final structural model.142,143 In 1995, Takata et al. reported the MEM maps of Y@C82 and empty C82 and confirmed that the metal atom is indeed encapsulated inside the fullerene cage.141 Thereafter, structures of numerous EMFs were determined similarly, such as those of Sc@C82, La@C82, and Y2C2@C82.144–146 However, it was recently found that this experiential strategy is not always reliable because several erroneous structures have been assigned using this method.147–149 Actually, because of the arbitrary data treatment processes, this method is rather a theoretical method than an experimental one. In addition, the high cost of the equipment and the complicated data analyzing process impede its generalization especially when single crystals of EMFs or their derivatives are readily obtainable.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
The all-carbon composition of fullerene cages makes 13C NMR spectroscopy an idealized solution to their structures. Actually, the cage structures of nearly all empty fullerenes were first established using this technique when they were isolated.150,151 In some cases, it was also able to distinguish the existence of several isomeric allotropes based on the spiral algorithm proposed by Fowler and Manolopolous.152
NMR spectroscopy was also used to characterize EMF cage structures. For divalent EMFs, di-EMFs and cluster EMFs, which are all diamagnetic species, direct NMR measurements are valid for establishing their structures.37,153–156 In some circumstances, calculations are relied upon to make the final assignment of a given cage because of the many possible isomers that provide the same NMR patterns. For example, in a recent work elucidating the cage structures of a series of Yb-EMFs with cage sizes ranging from C80 to C84, theoretical results had to be relied upon to make the final assignment of the cage structures of some compounds.154 Technically, before NMR measurement, the fullerene samples must be washed with hexane to avoid the possible influence of hydrocarbon impurities containing aromatic systems such as toluene, and both proton-coupled mode and proton-decoupled mode have to be applied to exclude signals from hydrocarbon impurities.
However, direct NMR measurement is not possible for paramagnetic species such as M@C82 (M = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Gd, etc.). Accordingly, they must be reduced or oxidized first to make them diamagnetic. Results showed that M@C82 was easily reduced/oxidized into ionic forms that were suitable for NMR determination. Related works have been nicely demonstrated by Akasaka and coworkers.157–160 The cage structures of many trivalent EMFs have been established, especially those of M@C82, showing that both C2v(9)-C82 and Cs(6)-C82 cages are rather favorable with the former much more stable. Furthermore, using the two-dimensional Incredible Natural Abundance Double Quantum Transfer Experiment (INADEQUATE), bond connectivities among nonequivalent cage carbons were also modeled in cases that the NMR spectrum is sufficiently clear.161,162 For example, the connections among the 24 different kinds of cage carbons of the Ce@C2v(9)-C82 anion were readily observed in its 2D INADEQUATE map which enables the accurate assignment of the NMR signal of each cage carbon. Moreover, results showed that the chemical shifts of the cage carbons are particularly sensitive to the unpaired f-electron of the internal Ce3+, indicating strong metal–cage interactions.162

13C NMR results also provide valuable information related to the non-IPR structures. A thorough examination of published 13C NMR results of pristine EMFs indicates that the [5,5]-carbons of non-IPR EMFs give rise to 13C NMR signals at a down-field region because of the highly strained structures and the possible deshielding effect of the internal metals. For example, signals of the pentalene carbons in non-IPR EMFs such as La2@D2(10611)-C72, Y3N@Cs(39663)-C82, and Y3N@Cs(51365)-C84 appear, respectively, at 158.1 ppm, 165.59 ppm, and 160.24 ppm.42,43,156 Consequently, the deshielded shifts might be a characteristic signature of non-IPR EMFs that do not contain paramagnetic metals.
Recently, the signals from the internal C2-unit of carbide cluster EMFs were detected with NMR spectrometry using 13C-enriched samples (Table 1). For the Sc2C2 cluster, which is frequently encountered in carbide cluster EMFs, peaks of the C2-unit are observed between 220 ppm and 260 ppm, but the corresponding signal of the C2-motif in the Sc3C2@Ih(7)-C80 anion was shifted down-field to 328 ppm.71–75 Observation of only one single peak of the C2-unit in all these EMFs indicates that the two carbons are equivalent within the NMR time scale. Dorn et al. recently reported the NMR investigations of Y2C2@C2n (n = 41, 42, 46) and also observed the signals of the internal Y2C2 unit at the range from 225 ppm to 260 ppm.163 Their calculations indicated that the carbide cluster tends to pursue a linear structure in large cages like C100, but in small cages such as C82, the cluster has to be compressed by the cage to resemble a butterfly. The origin of these anomalous 13C NMR signals is not fully clear now, but the contribution from the d orbitals of the metals, the unique arrangement between the metal orbitals and those of the C2-unit, and the charge-transfer within the clusters are all important reasons. More study is necessary to clarify these mysteries.
Metal nuclei NMR spectroscopy is also helpful to obtain information about the motional behavior of the internal metals. The variable-temperature 139La NMR results of La2@C80 indicated that the two La cations are rotating inside the highly symmetric cage.37 Recent works on several carbide cluster EMFs such as Sc2C2@C2v(3)-C80, Sc2C2@Cs(6)-C82, and Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C82 are more interesting.71,73,74 At lower temperatures, their 45Sc NMR spectra display two peaks of the metal nuclei, indicating two non-equivalent Sc3+ cations in a fixed cluster. With increasing temperatures, the two peaks coalesce into one sharper peak, confirming a rotating cluster inside. This feature, which might be regarded characteristic of carbide cluster EMFs, is useful in future applications in molecular thermometers and quantum information processing systems. Furthermore, the 45Sc NMR spectra of Sc3CN@Ih(7)-C80 displayed two signals with a 1:2 ratio, confirming the triangular structure of the internal cluster which was further proved by XRD results.64
Although an NMR technique has shown great success in establishing the molecular structures of EMFs, it provides limited information about the location of the metals relative to the cage frame. Accordingly, single-crystal XRD crystallography is highly desired throughout the research of EMFs. Recently, great success has been achieved in this field.


Single crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography. 
This is certainly the most reliable solution to molecular structures of all kinds of compounds, whether they are organic, inorganic, or biological. First, high-quality single crystals must be obtained for the X-ray measurements. However, the crystals obtained directly from pristine fullerenes and EMFs are unsuitable for the structural analyses because the highly symmetric and spherical molecules tend to rotate randomly within the crystal lattice even at low temperatures.164,165 Consequently, it is not possible to obtain accurate coordinates of the atoms in the molecular structures.
Two representative and practical strategies were proposed to solve this problem. First, the EMF molecules can form neat cocrystals with metal porphyrins: MII(OEP) (M = Ni, Co etc., OEP = 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin dianion). In the cocrystal, the all-cis conformation of the eight alkyl groups of an MII(OEP) molecule wraps the spherical fullerene molecule in a nearly specific way. Therefore, the free rotation of the fullerene molecules is largely hindered and consequently the resulting complexes are particularly suitable for XRD measurements. Numerous successful examples have been reported by different research groups using this method.

Table 2 presents the reported examples of ‘pristine’ EMFs with their X-ray structures ascertained using the cocrystallization method as of May 2012. More than 60 different EMFs have been reported. Nearly half of them are nitride cluster EMFs, including several species with non-IPR cage structures. Actually, using this cocrystallization method, Balch et al. have also obtained the structure of Kr@C60 (not included in Table 2), revealing that the inert gas molecule is in the center of the cage, featuring unobservable interaction with the cage carbon atoms.166 In contrast, the single metal in mono-EMFs always departs from the center of the cage, either approaching closely to a hexagonal carbon ring for rare-earth metals or over a carbon bond for alkali-metals, for example, M@C3v(134)-C94 (M = Tm, Ca).33 In large cages, the single metal is also possible to move even at low temperatures (e.g. Sm@C90 isomers).167 It is noteworthy that the crystal of Li+@C60 was obtained by cocrystallization with its counter anion, [SbCl6]−, instead of metal porphyrin.35 Furthermore, it was found in a recent study that the solvated Sc3N@C80 are nicely ordered in the crystal lattice, providing new insight into the structures of ‘pristine’ EMFs.168

Although single-crystal XRD crystallography is an extremely powerful solution to EMF structures, it is not possible to report all accurate structural information of the molecules. For example, it is not valid to distinguish the N-atom from carbons in hetero-EMFs such as Tb2@C79N.87 Consequently, calculations have to be relied upon to help with the final assignment. Furthermore, this method showed disability in pairing the many disordered internal clusters with the corresponding cage orientations in most cases. Sometimes calculations and additional spectroscopic characterizations are necessary.169
Alternatively, the free rotation of the spherical fullerene and EMF molecules in the crystal lattice can be hindered by covalent attachment of various functional groups. To date, the number of examples of EMF derivatives that have been characterized structurally using single-crystal XRD crystallography is comparable to that of the cocrystals. These derivatives are summarized in Table 3. It is noteworthy that the adamantylidene (Ad) adducts of EMFs are particularly suitable for the growth of single crystals.192 Totally 17 isomers of EMFs–Ad derivatives have been reported and structurally determined with XRD. Based on the experimental results reported to date, an experiential concept seems to be instructive for the preparation of EMF-derivatives suitable for single-crystal growth. First, the moiety of the addend should be rigid so that it can hinder the rotation of the molecule to the greatest degree possible. Then the addend should be highly symmetric so that the possible disordered orientations of the fullerene cage are reduced to a certain extent in the crystal lattice. Finally, the reactions resulting in open-caged structures are more advantageous because the metal motions can be largely hindered by trapping a metal atom inside the cavity of broken bonds.

Others. 
In addition to the methods which can be viewed as direct solutions to the molecular structure of EMFs, associative and accessorial means such as infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical spectroscopy, and even high-resolution tunneling electronic microscopy (HRTEM) have all been used to characterize EMFs. However, it is noteworthy that all these indirect means must ultimately rely on the concrete results obtained by direct methods to establish the molecular structures of EMFs firmly.

4.2 Cage structures

Isolated pentagon rule (IPR). 
To understand the molecular structures of fullerenes and to explain the experimental fact that C60 and C70 are invariably the most abundant, the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) was proposed by Kroto.32 IPR states that all pentagons on the fullerene cage must be separated by hexagons because fused pentagons bear high bond strains and are therefore highly reactive. This law is particularly valid in regulating the structures of empty fullerenes: although several examples of non-IPR fullerenes have been obtained recently, the fused-pentagon carbons in these species are all substituted so as to release the high bond strain.222–227


IPR EMFs. 
The IPR continues to be valid for regulating EMF structures in most cases. As presented in Tables 2 and 3, among all isomers of EMFs that have been determined structurally using single-crystal XRD, most of them (ca. 90%) have IPR cage structures although the cage size, symmetry, and the content of the internal metallic species vary in a wide range. It is noteworthy that the cage structures of EMFs are normally different from the most stable isomers of the corresponding empty fullerenes because of the electron transfer from the metal core to the cage.6


Non-IPR EMFs. 
Encapsulation of metals inside fullerenes also generates some novel species with cage structures violating the IPR: non-IPR EMFs.
Actually, the first examples of fullerene cages violating the IPR were reported for two EMFs. In 2000, Shinohara et al. reported the isolation and structural characterization of Sc2@C2v(4348)-C66 with NMR and SRPD/Rietveld/XRD methods.228 The proposed structure contains two pairs of fused pentagons that are not maximally separated on the cage. Accordingly, the two metals are not separated to the greatest degree either due to their preferential interactions with the two pentagon pairs. Until now, this compound represents the sole example of fullerenes or EMFs with a C66 cage but unfortunately no single crystal XRD results of this compound have been reported since then.128,229 At the same time, Dorn, Balch, and collaborators reported the preparation and single-crystal X-ray structure of Sc3N@D3(6140)-C68.230 Three fused pentagons are found within the cage framework, which are spread over the cage surface at each of the three poles of the D3-symmetric molecule. Under each pair of fused pentagons localizes a Sc metal atom interacting strongly with the fused-pentagon carbons (Fig. 7a).175
 Fig. 7  Typical non-IPR EMFs with the fused-pentagon pairs highlighted: (a) Sc3N@D3(6140)-C68, (b) La@C2(10612)-C72–C6H3Cl2, (c) La2@D2(10611)-C72, (d) Gd3N@C2(22010)-C78, (e) Gd3N@Cs(39663)-C82, and (f) Tb3N@Cs(51365)-C84. 
Subsequently, several examples of non-IPR EMFs were also reported, such as M3N@Cs(39663)-C82 (M = Gd, Tb, Tm),187 Tb3N@Cs(51365)-C84,188 La@C2(10612)-C72,31 and La2@D2(10611)-C72,42 Sc2S@D2(10528)-C72,191 Gd3N@C2(22010)-C78,178 all of which received single-crystal XRD confirmations. Additional examples include Sc2C2@C2v(6073)-C68,68 Sc3N@C2v(7854)-C70,231 DySc2N@Cs(17490)-C76,232 and Dy3N@C2(22010)-C78233,234 which were characterized with theoretical calculations in combination with some spectroscopic characterizations. Some typical non-IPR EMFs reported are presented in Fig. 7 with the fused-pentagon pairs highlighted.
The large number of non-IPR EMFs has certainly stimulated broad concern related to their unusual structures and the origin of these novel species. It is interesting to find that in all these species, only fused-pentagon pairs, but not triply fused-pentagons,226 are present. Thus, it seems to be conclusive that one metal cation is not valid to stabilize a triply fused-pentagon structure.235 Furthermore, a fused-pentagon pair invariably requires an internal metal cation to stabilize it. It is noteworthy that Sc2C2@C2v(6073)-C68 was recently argued to be Sc2@C2v(7854)-C70 which has three pairs of fused-pentagons.69 The fused-pentagons are always separated to the greatest degree possible within the cage framework. The recent ‘maximum pentagon separation rule’ appears also practical for predicting the stability of non-IPR species.139 Because the internal metal always interacts strongly with the fused-pentagons, the maximal separation of fused-pentagon pairs also engenders the furthest separation of the metal cations.

4.3 Metal–cage interplay
An interesting feature of EMFs is that electron transfer from the internal metallic species to the outer fullerene cage takes place, as already described.236–241 In this regard, the metal–cage interaction in EMFs is dominated by electrostatic attraction. However, it is difficult to say that there is any kind of bonding between the metallic core and the cage framework because, in most cases, the metals are moving inside the cage, especially at room temperature.146,242 Nevertheless, some empirical conclusions can be drawn based on the structural results of EMFs obtained to date. For mono-EMFs, the single-metal cation, either trivalent or divalent, tends to locate off-center, interacting strongly with a hexagonal carbon ring of the cage in some cases.171 In contrast, the two metals in common di-EMFs and the metallic cluster in cluster fullerenes (mainly nitride cluster EMFs) tend to move even at such a low temperature as 90 K.167
Furthermore, the cage symmetry, size and shape are critical to the location and motion of the encapsulated metallic species. For example, the cluster (e.g. La2, Sc3N, and Sc3C2)37 inside the highly symmetric Ih-C80 cage invariably rotates while the metal atoms (e.g. La2) inside ellipsoidal cages such as C72 and C78 tend to reside at each pole of the cages. It would be reasonable to say that the metal–cage interplay is a combinational result of both electronic and geometric (spatial) effects.
4.4 Formation mechanism of EMFs: the role of metals
Preliminary results have shown that the boiling point of the metal source, the ionic potential of the metal and the ease of metal to form carbide structures are all critical factors for the formation of EMFs, but none is conclusive.29,243,244 Even now it is not certain whether the formation process of EMFs is similar to that of empty fullerenes or whether it is unique because of the presence of the metallic species. Compared with the achievements obtained in the structural characterization and chemical functionalization of EMFs, the investigations of the formation mechanism of EMFs are rather limited. This situation is expected to be a result of the lack of proper experimental tools. Accordingly, only theoretical considerations and few experimental results have been published relating to the EMF formation process. For example, a C2-encapsulation process was proposed for the formation of carbide EMFs when the molecular structures of Y2@C3v(8)-C82 and Y2C2@C3v(8)-C82 were discussed;245 Lu et al. believed that the formation process of mono-EMFs is probably dictated by the single metal cation according to the structural similarities between Yb@C2(5)-C82 and Yb@C2(13)-C84.154
The so-called ‘closed network formation’ process of fullerenes proposed recently by Kroto and coworkers shed new lights on the assembly mechanism of carbon clusters.246 After exposure to carbon vapor, fullerenes such as C60, C70 and even EMFs like La2@C80 and Gd@C82 tend to capture one or two carbon atoms to grow up into larger cages via the closed network formation process. However, it is still unclear how the stable fullerene isomers form from the carbon dust during arc discharge or laser ablation processes. Accordingly, more efforts have to be undertaken to explicitly clarify the mechanism in the future. Successful results are expected to be helpful to invent more efficient production methods and to realize the final application of these fascinating materials.
5. Exohedral modifications of EMFs
Following the mature chemistry of fullerenes, efforts were recently devoted to the attachment of different organic functional moieties onto the outer surface of EMFs to produce novel hybrid molecules.247 To date, various approaches have been investigated for the successful exohedral modifications of EMFs. Actually, many initial efforts just simply followed the reactions performed on empty fullerenes.248 However, under similar reaction conditions, EMFs, to some degree, exhibited different reactivities and afforded unexpected product distributions.249–251 Therefore, in recent studies, much interest has been particularly aimed at the unique chemical characteristics of EMFs, which are obviously correlated with the endohedral metallic species.
Because the chemical modifications of EMFs have been discussed in terms of reactions in a recent review,252 this section selectively summarizes a few topics related to the interplay between the chemical modifications on the cage and the behavior of the endohedral metallic species.253
5.1 Chemical modifications of mono-EMFs: influence of the single metal
Among various mono-EMFs, M@C82 is normally the most abundant one. To date, most studies related to the modifications of mono-EMF were performed on M@C2v-C82 species, which encapsulate a trivalent metal (Y, La, Ce, Nd, etc.).254–257 Because of the three-electron transfer from the encapsulated metal to the fullerene cage, there is an unpaired electron delocalized on the M@C82 cage.258–261 Therefore, unlike the empty fullerenes, which have a closed-shell electronic structure, trivalent mono-EMFs have an open-shell structure with an unpaired electron on the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). Recent studies specifically examined the characteristic reactivities of these mono-EMFs and also the effect of endohedral metallic species.34
According to the features of addition patterns, the reactions of mono-EMFs include cycloaddition reactions and singly-bonded addition reactions. Summarizing, precursors, such as carbenes,192 1,3-dipolar reagents,262–264 zwitterion,201 disilirane compounds,265 dienes,266 and benzyne,267 have all been employed to functionalize EMFs. However, due to the lower cage symmetry of typical mono-EMFs, the regioselectivity is expected to be a big problem. For instance, the frequently encountered M@C2v-C82 (M = Sc, Y, La, Ce etc.) cage possesses 19 non-equivalent [6,6]-bonds and 16 non-equivalent [5,6]-bonds. From a geometrical perspective, cycloaddition to M@C2v-C82 might afford numerous isomeric mono-adducts. However, most cycloadditions to La@C82 show specifically high regioselectivity and yield only a few isomeric monoadducts. For instance, the carbene addition reaction of La@C82 yielded only two isomeric monoadducts (La@C82–(Ad) I and II; Ad = adamantylidene),192 and only one mono-adduct isomer was detected in the reaction of La@C2v-C82 with 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene.198 Using X-ray crystallographic methods, addition sites are ascertained unambiguously. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the carbene addition to La@C2v-C82 occurs on the “top” of the C2v-C82 cage, whereas the diene addition takes place near the “bottom” of the cage. To understand such unique regioselectivities, a series of theoretical analyses were performed that revealed that the Mülliken charge densities are more negative on the “top” of the C2v-C82 cage, where the enclosed metal is nearby. In addition, the cage carbons in this region bear higher local strains than those in other parts. A combination of these two factors accounts for the highest reactivity of the cage carbons at this region toward electrophiles such as carbene. Positive Mülliken charge densities exist near the “bottom” of the cage, where the enclosed metal is far away and thus the nucleophilic diene addition occurs selectively.252,268

Aside from various cycloaddition reactions, the singly bonded addition reactions are also common for trivalent mono-EMFs. A representative example is the Bingel reaction of La@C2v-C82, in which the endohedral reacted with bromomalonate in the presence of DBU. Unexpectedly, the reaction afforded a series of singly bonded adducts: La@C82CBr(CO2C2H5)2.195 Four isomers are detected and characterized.269 The X-ray structure of the most abundant isomer of La@C82CBr(CO2C2H5)2 (Fig. 8c) shows that the addition site is close to the “bottom” of the C2v-C82 cage, where the positive Mülliken charge is localized. Consequently, it was assumed that this atypical Bingel reaction proceeds through an initial nucleophilic addition of the in situ generated carbanion to the electron-deficient region of the C2v-C82 cage followed by an O2-induced oxidation instead of the departure of the halogen atom and the cyclopropanation process. The latter process actually takes place in the typical Bingel reaction of C60.270,271 In addition, by slightly increasing the temperature, La@C2v-C82 can similarly react with malonate in the presence of DBU and afford a 1,4-bisadduct La@C82[CH(CO2C2H5)2]2 with high regioselectivity (Fig. 8d).196 The addition sites also involve these carbons with positive charges, corroborating the proposed mechanism. It appears that the radical additions to M@C82 tend to yield products with closed-shell structures. An interesting radical addition reaction of M@C82 was reported by Takano et al.197,272 Under a heating condition, La@C2v-C82 readily reacted with thermally generated benzyl radicals rather than the 1,3-dipole in the presence of 3-triphenylmethyl-5-oxazolidinone, yielding the singly bonded adduct La@C82(CH2C6H5). This result underscores the high reactivity of La@C82 toward radicals. Upon photo-irradiated conditions, similar benzyl radical addition to La@C82 can also take place. In addition, using a series of substituted benzenes, such as p-xylene, o-xylene, p-tert-butyltoluene, and α,α,2,4-tetrachlorotoluene (TCT), as alternatives to toluene, the reactions with La@C82 afforded analogue adducts. One typical adduct is La@C82(CHClC6H3Cl2), which was obtained from the reaction with TCT and further characterized using X-ray analysis. The addition site is revealed unambiguously as near the “waist” of the C2v-C82 cage (Fig. 8e), where some cage carbons have relatively high spin density values.
Radical addition to mono-EMFs could also yield multiple adducts with the formation of an odd number of single bonds. An early report is the reaction of Y@C82 with a CF3 radical that is generated in situ by the thermolysis of CF3I or Ag(CF3CO2).273 This reaction afforded a series of adducts of Y@C82(CF3)2n+1 (n = 0, 1, 2) with odd number of addends. In the case of C60 the resulting adducts were identified as C60(CF3)2n (n = 1, 2, 3) containing an even number of addends.274,275 One more example is La@C82NO2(C6H4)2 which was obtained unexpectedly during the reaction between this endohedral and benzyne.200 Its X-ray results show that the NO2 has a positional directing effect on the subsequent addition of the two benzene moieties. Moreover, not only the pristine M@C2v-C82 but also their derivatives are prone to radical coupling reactions. For example, the dimerization of adducts La@C82[CH(CO2C2H5)2]2 and La@C82C5(CH3)5 was observed during crystallization, in which the adjacent monomers are coupled mutually with 100% or 60% probability, respectively.195,198 All the above results indicate that such paramagnetic EMFs with open-shell configurations tend to pursue a closed-shell structure whenever possible.
In addition to the soluble La@C2v-C82, some insoluble trivalent mono-EMFs with different cage sizes are also prone to the radical additions, even at solid states. Very typical is a series of insoluble mono-EMFs such as La@C2(10612)-C72, La@D3h-C74, La@C2v(3)-C80 and La@C3v(7)-C82, which undergo dichlorophenyl radical addition during the TCB extraction process yielding singly bonded adducts La@C2n(C6H3Cl2) (n = 36, 37, 40, 41).31,110–113 Compared to pristine compounds, these adducts are more soluble and more stable. Combined studies using theoretical calculations and X-ray analysis suggested that the dichlorophenyl group tends to attack the cage carbon having the highest spin density. The unevenly distributed spin densities on these cages are caused by the off-center position of the encapsulated La atom and the mutual interplay between the metal and the cage, confirming the strong influence of the encapsulated trivalent metal on the character of cage carbons via metal–cage electron-transfer.
Summarizing, the influence of the encapsulated single metal ion on the chemistry of trivalent mono-EMFs is of great importance because the addition reactions of these EMFs are evidently related to the charge or spin distribution on the cage, which in turn depends on the metal position and the metal–cage electron-transfer interaction.
5.2 Chemical modifications of di-EMFs: motional control of internal metals
Regarding the metal position, the situations in some di-EMFs are generally different from those of the mono-EMFs described above, in which the single metal ion almost stands still inside the cage in most cases. However, the encapsulated dimetallic clusters show various dynamic behaviors depending on the cage size and shape. In small and ellipsoidal cages such as D2(10611)-C72 and D3h(5)-C78, the M2 cluster (M = La or Ce) has been confirmed to be nearly fixed and localized along the longest axis of the cage.48,276 In the round and large cages such as Ih-C80, D5h-C80 and C3v(8)-C82, Cs(6)-C82, however, the M2 cluster (e.g. La2 or Er2) otherwise undergoes random movement.45,46 Recent chemical studies have revealed that these freely rotating clusters can be manipulated through the functionalizations of the fullerene cage, which bring these molecules new electric and magnetic properties.
Typical results are elucidated in the reaction of M2@Ih-C80 (M = La, Ce) with disilirane, which yielded 1,4-bis-silylated adducts.203,277 NMR and XRD analyses of Ce2@Ih-C80(Mes2Si)2CH2 suggested that the Ce2 cluster is almost still with each Ce atom facing a hexagonal ring at the equator of the cage featuring a long Ce–Ce distance of 3.829 Å (Fig. 9a). For the bis-silylated adducts La2@Ih-C80(Ar2Si)2CH2 (Ar = Mes or Dep, Dep = 2,6-diethylphenyl), XRD results suggested a similar cluster motion with a La–La distance of 3.792 Å. 139La NMR studies at varied temperatures (183–308 K) further revealed that the two La atoms start to hop two-dimensionally along the equator of the bis-silylated cage with increasing temperatures.
 Fig. 9  X-ray structures of typical derivatives of M2@C2n (M = Ce, la): (a) Ce2@Ih-C80(Mes2Si)2CH2, (b) [6,6]-La2@Ih-C80(CH2)NCTrt, (c) La2@Ih-C80(Ad), (d) La2@D2(10611)-C72 and (e) La2@D3h(5)-C78. 
Another practical reaction of M2@Ih-C80 (M = La, Ce) is the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, giving rise to both [6,6]- and [5,6]-pyrrolidine-adducts.204,278 XRD studies of the corresponding [6,6]-adducts (i.e. [6,6]-M2@Ih-C80(CH2)NCTrt; M = La, Ce) unambiguously elucidated that the two metal ions are almost fixed at slantwise positions relative to the addition site (Fig. 9b). The metal–metal distances (La–La = 3.823 Å and Ce–Ce = 3.900 Å) in these adducts are generally longer than those in the corresponding 1,4-bis-silylated adducts. Carbene additions to M2@Ih-C80, starting from either diarizine or diazo-compounds yielded only [6,6]-fulleroid adducts.202,279 In these derivatives, the M2 cluster is fixed and is collinearly aligned with the spiro carbon of the addend, as revealed by XRD analyses (Fig. 9c). Compared to the bis-silylated adducts and pyrrolidine-adducts of M2@Ih-C80 described above, these fulleroid carbene adducts have even wider metal–metal distances. For instance, the La–La distance in the mono-adduct La2@Ih-C80(Ad) is 4.031 Å whereas it is elongated to 4.159 Å in the bis-adduct La2@Ih-C80(CC6H4Cl)(Ad).279 These could be attributed to the [6,6]-bond cleavage on the cage-frame that expands the inner space, allowing further departure between the two metals to relieve their strong electrostatic repulsion. To this end, it can be concluded that exohedral functionalizations of M2@Ih-C80 change not only the cluster movement but also the metal–metal distance.
However, since the dimetallic cluster in small di-EMFs M2@C2n (M = La, Ce; n = 36, 39) is quite steady, the cage modifications have only negligible influences on the cluster movement. For La2@D2(10611)-C72, the carbene additions occur exclusively on the two poles of the D2(10611)-C72 cage.43,44 The La–La distance in the mono-carbene adduct La2@C72(Ad)) ranges from 4.171 Å to 4.178 Å, whereas the La–La distance in the bis-carbene adduct La2@C72(Ad)2) is elongated to 4.300 Å (Fig. 9d). These results corroborate again that the C–C bond cleavages at the sites close to the metal atoms allow wider metal–metal separation to relieve their electrostatic repulsion. However, for M2@D3h(5)-C78 (M = Ce, La), not only the carbene addition but also the 1,4-bis-silylation takes place on the cage region far from the internal metals.48,280 XRD analyses of both the carbene adducts and the bis-silylated adducts revealed that the metal–metal distances are almost identical to those of pristine M2@D3h(5)-C78, although the carbene addition to La2@D3h(5)-C78 also results in C–C bond cleavage on the cage (Fig. 9e).
5.3 Chemical modifications of cluster-EMFs: the cluster-size effect
Nitride cluster EMFs are the earliest discovered cluster-EMFs with Sc3N@Ih-C80 being very promising for its high production yield and high stability.230 Aside from Sc3N@Ih-C80, many other nitride cluster EMFs with different metals and cages have been synthesized and well studied during recent years.281 Apparently, as compared to mono-EMFs and di-EMFs, the inner cage space of cluster EMFs is more crowded because of the larger size of endohedral species. XRD analyses revealed that large M3N clusters such as Gd3N, Tb3N and Tm3N slightly “punch out” the Ih-C80 cage.57,181,186 Therefore, comparative studies were performed on a series of nitride cluster EMFs, M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Y, Lu, Gd), to investigate the influence of the cluster size on the chemical properties of the whole molecules.
The chemical reactivities seen for various M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Y, Gd) towards 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions are quite different. For Sc3N@C80, which contains the smallest nitride cluster generated so far, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition occurs preferentially on the [5,6]-bond.282 Theoretical calculations also suggest that the [5,6]-pyrrolidine adduct of Sc3N@C80 is more energetically stable than the [6,6]-isomer. However, the same reaction performed for Y3N@Ih-C80 predominantly yielded the [6,6]-adduct, which was found to isomerize to the corresponding [5,6]-adduct under heating.283,284 The reason is simple: the bigger Y3N cluster distorts the cage and increases the reactivity of [6,6]-carbons.130 Accordingly, the relative stability of the [5,6]-pyrrolidine and [6,6]-pyrrolidine adduct of M3N@C80 is tunable upon changing the M3N cluster size. In the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of Gd3N@C80, only the [6,6]-adduct is formed and its isomerization to the [5,6]-isomer has never been observed, even under heating conditions.285 Consequently, it appears that the nitride cluster size plays a key role in determining not only the reactivity of the cage carbon but also the relative stabilities of the corresponding pyrrolidine adducts.
Similar cluster-size effects have also been observed in the Bingel reactions of M3N@Ih-C80. Compared with C60, most TNT EMFs are more inert toward the nucleophilic carbanion in a typical Bingel–Hirsch reaction. No product was detected in the reaction of M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Lu) with bromomalonate and DBU in toluene or o-DCB solution. Echegoyen et al. recently reported that using the mixture of o-DCB–DMF as solvent can improve the reaction performance to get the corresponding Bingel adducts of M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Lu).286 In contrast, M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Y, Er, Gd), which contain a larger cluster, are more reactive, similar to that of C60, in the Bingel–Hirsch reaction.283,284,287,288 Irrespective of the solvent polarity, the corresponding Bingel-adduct can be prepared facilely. It appears that the larger cluster actually improves the reactivity of the fullerene cage, probably by increasing the C–C bond strain on the cage, as reflected by the “punch out” effect described above.
It is noteworthy that results of the chemical functionalization of other cluster EMFs are rather limited. To date, there has been still no report on the chemical properties of such EMFs containing a cluster of oxide, sulphide or cyanide. Studies on the chemistry of carbide cluster EMFs have just emerged recently.49,71–73,221,289,290
5.4 Supramolecular complexes of EMFs: enhanced non-covalent interactions
Besides covalent chemistry, supramolecular chemistry provides an alternative way towards efficient functionalizations of EMFs. Recent studies specifically examine two types of EMF-based supramolecular complexes, in which either π–π stacking or charge-transfer interaction is used as an assembling approach. Since EMFs contain many different metal ions that bear interesting physical–chemical properties, the resulting complexes of EMFs are believed to be more useful than those C60-based complexes.
As porphyrins and their derivatives have a large planar π-surface, the porphyrin cavities have been widely used to trap empty fullerenes C60 and C70via π–π interactions, affording host–guest complexes. In recent studies, EMFs such as La@C2v-C82 and Sc3N@Ih-C80 were used as novel guest molecules to build complexes with various porphyrin dimers or trimers.168,291–294 The porphyrins employed in these studies are presented in Fig. 10. The calculated binding constants of these EMF:porphyrin complexes are summarized in Table 4 and compared with those of analogous fullerene:porphyrin complexes. The higher binding constants of EMF-based complexes, which are normally 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those of fullerene-based complexes, are notable, indicating the enhanced non-covalent interactions between EMFs and porphyrins. This might be attributed to the larger aromatic surface area and the increased electronic polarization of EMFs relative to those of empty fullerenes.

Among these EMF:porphyrin complexes, one interesting example is La@C82:7, which can be further converted to a caged analogue La@C82:caged-[PCu]2 by intramolecular ring-closing olefin metathesis (Fig. 11).294 Because of the more constrained cavity of caged-[PCu]2, its complex with La@C82 is much more stable than the other, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. More importantly, these two inclusion complexes displayed quite different spin coupling profiles, that is, a ferromagnetic coupling between La@C82 and 7 whereas a ferrimagnetic coupling between La@C82 and caged-[PCu]2. Regarding this unprecedented transformation, DFT calculations provided rational explanations that the coupling mode of cluster spins could be changed by altering the cluster geometry. Specifically, the unpaired spin of La@C82 can couple with the adjacent unpaired spins either ferromagnetically or ferrimagnetically, relying on the interspin distances and their relative geometries.

Moreover, EMFs can be trapped inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), forming the so-called “peapod” structures.295 Similar to fullerene peapods, the large π–π interactions between EMFs and SWNTs are considered as the major driving force for EMF peapod formation. In fact, not only pristine EMFs such as M@C82 (M = Sc,296 La,297 Ce,298,299 Gd,295,300 Sm241,301), La2@C80,302 and Sc3C2@C80296 but also the functionalized EMF (i.e. pyrrolidine-adduct of Sc3N@C80)303 have been filled inside SWNTs. Interestingly, these EMFs exhibited different dynamic behaviors inside SWNTs, which have never been reported for C60 or C70 peapods. For instance, a series of TEM investigations described continuous spinning of Sm@C82 in SWNTs,301 a tumbling motion of La2@C80 in SWNTs,302 and a mixed dynamic behavior of Gd@C82 in SWNTs where some cages are stationary and some are spinning.295,300 The different electrostatic interactions between the highly charged EMF cages and the inner wall of SWNTs might account for these behaviors. Moreover, a dynamic conformational change of SWNT was reported for the Sc3C2@C80 peapod. As presented in Fig. 12, the TEM images show that Sc3C2@C80 molecules adopt a zigzag packing pattern, probably for reducing the intermolecular Coulomb repulsive forces.296 Surprisingly, the slow expansion and contraction of the diameter of the SWNT in Sc3C2@C80 peapods could be observed with the rotation of the zigzag fullerene chain. This entirely new phenomenon was attributed to the higher HOMO level and smaller ionization potential of Sc3C2@C80 relative to other fullerenes, which result in easier ionization of Sc3C2@C80 under electron beam irradiation and therefore more significant interaction between SWNT and highly charged fullerene species. The authors believed that this result might present exciting possibilities for nanoactuation.

(right panel) Schematic representation of the rotation of a zigzag chain of Sc3C2@C80 inside a SWNT causing structural deformation that engenders an elliptical cross section.

Filling SWNTs with EMFs such as Gd@C82 can also modulate the band gap of SWNTs. In 2002, Lee et al. first reported that the bandgap of SWNTs was narrowed from ca. 0.5 eV down to ca. 0.1 eV at sites where Gd@C82 molecules locate.304 Thus, the Gd@C82 peapods is like an array of quantum dots with a small bandgap. It was believed that the charge-transfer between Gd@C82 and SWNT is one of the important causes which could account for such change in the bandgap. Warner et al. further revealed the occurrence of the charge-transfer event between the spin-active M@C82 (M = La, Sc) and SWNT for C60:M@C82/SWNT peapod, which was expressed by the loss of a measurable hyperfine structure of La3+ or Sc3+ related ESR signal.305 These results might be specifically important for the further advancement of solid-state architectures of the aligned quantum dots and spin-dependent transport studies.
Besides, the charge-transfer event also occurs exothermally between the spin-active EMF such as La@C2v-C82 and crown-like molecules, giving rise to the formations of ion-pair complexes. Consequently, the resulting electrostatic attraction between the two ionic moieties provides an additional stabilizing force for these complexes. In 2006, Tsuchiya et al. reported the formation of charge-transfer complexes of La@C2v-C82 with a series of azacrown ethers and unsaturated thiacrown ethers.306,307 The structures of these crown ethers are presented in Fig. 13a. Spectroscopic studies clearly revealed that La@C2v-C82 invariably behaved as an electron-acceptor whereas the crown ethers as electron-donors. The binding affinities of La@C82 with these ethers are much stronger than those seen for C60. It might be rational because the more facile one-electron reduction of La@C2v-C82 can better facilitate the electron transfer from the crown ether to La@C2v-C82. In addition, the highest binding constant has been achieved when the cavity size of unsaturated thiacrown ether (n = 2) matches the cage size of La@C2v-C82, indicating the presence of additional host–guest interactions in such complexes. These complexation schemes are valuable and have been applied to the selective separation of EMFs from the soot extract.308

(b) Schematic representation of the charge transfer complex formation between La@C2v-C82 and TMPD. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 309. Copyright 2006 American Chemical Society.) 
In more recent studies, not only La@C2v-C82 but also La2@Ih-C80 has been revealed as electron-acceptors in the charge-transfer complexes with some organic donor molecules such as N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylendiamin (TMPD), 5,10-dihydro-5,10-dimethyl-phenazine (DHDMP), and decamethylferrocene (FeCp*2).309,310 A notable point is the reversible formation of these complexes. Specifically, the equilibrium between EMF/D (D = donor) and EMF˙−/D˙+ is readily controllable in solution by changing the temperature and solvent. The much lower reduction potentials of La@C82 and La2@C80 relative to that of C60 were regarded as the major driving force for these unprecedented ground-state charge-transfer processes. Considering the unpaired spin on the cage of La@C82, the author described the complexation between La@C82 and organic donor as an intermolecular spin-site exchange process, as presented in Fig. 13b. The fact that even diamagnetic La2@C80 is susceptible to ground-state charge-transfer is interesting and highlights its exceptionally lower LUMO orbital level relative to C60 and even La@C82.
Another representative ground-state charge-transfer occurs in the supramolecular complex of Li+@C60 and TTF-C4P (tetrathiafulvalene calix[4]pyrrole) in the presence of Cl−.311 Actually, the addition of Cl− induces a conformation change of TTF-C4P from the so-called 1,3-alternate to the cone conformation. The latter conformer can facilely form a host–guest complex with Li+@C60. Such a binding mode was proposed to protect and/or stabilize the radical anion of Li+@C60 and facilitate the charge-transfer process, although the one-electron oxidation potential of TTF-C4P (Eox = 0.55 vs. SCE) is little higher than the one-electron reduction potential of Li+@C60 (Ered = 0.12 vs. SCE).
6. Properties and potential applications of EMFs
EMFs are novel hybrid molecules, which combine fullerene and metallic components at the atomic level. EMFs therefore have the combined properties of their individual components, the fullerene and metallic species, with additional properties arising from metal–cage interactions. This section is devoted to the properties not only of pristine EMFs but also of their derivatives, covering their electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, magnetic properties, and electronic transport properties including the field effect transistor (FET) properties and conductivities.
6.1 Electrochemical properties
Corresponding to their structural diversity, EMFs are found to display complicated electrochemical behaviors. Herein, we summarize the electrochemical properties of EMFs in terms of their structural features, and especially the endohedral compositions. The discussion will also point to their intrinsic electronic features, HOMO–LUMO energy levels and distributions, which are important for estimating and understanding their chemical and physical properties.

Mono-metallofullerenes. 
M@C2v-C82 (M = Y, La, Ce, etc.) that contains a trivalent metal inside the C2v-C82 cage has much higher production yield than other mono-EMFs. The redox potentials of a series of representative species of M@C2v-C82 are presented in Table 5. At first glance, their small electrochemical gaps (ΔE < 0.5 V), which correspond to their facile one-electron oxidation and reduction, are impressive. The one-electron oxidations of M@C82 are even comparable or easier than that of ferrocene. All these characteristics suggest that M@C82 is a redox-active species.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that both the cage structure and the variety of endohedral metal impose detectable influence, to different extent, on the redox behaviors of M@C82. Specifically, on the one hand, the one-electron redox process of M@C82 is strongly dependent on the cage structure. For instance, switching the cage from C2v-C82 to Cs(6)-C82 causes a cathodic potential shift of 140 mV for the first oxidation of La@C82. On the other hand, the first redox potentials of M@C2v-C82 show weaker dependence on the endohedral metal. As Table 7 shows, altering the metallic content of M@C2v-C82 from Y to La, their one-electron redox potentials differ by only 30–50 mV, presenting a less-remarkable influence from the endohedral metal.
Many reports also described the electrochemical properties of those derivatives of trivalent mono-EMFs, which specifically examined the changes of the EMF-based electrochemical properties upon derivations.312 For instance, the cycloadducts or bis-adduct of La@C2v-C82, which remains open-shell structural feature, are similarly characteristic of small electrochemical gaps. Compared with the parent La@C2v-C82, the one-electron oxidation and reduction of these cycloadducts occur at either higher or lower potentials, relying on the electronic nature of the appended groups. However, the singly bonded adducts of La@C2v-C82 such as La@C82–CBr(COOC2H5)2195,269 and La@C82–CH2C6H5197 display markedly different electrochemical behaviors because of their closed-shell structures. Specifically, their one-electron reduction and oxidation are more difficult than that of pristine La@C2v-C82 as well as the cycloadducts, giving rise to much wider electrochemical potential gaps (ΔE > 1.0 V). In addition, the first reduction of these singly bonded adducts might be either reversible or irreversible depending on the characteristics of the appended groups.
With a divalent metal inside, the electronic configuration of M@C2n can be expressed as M2+@C2n2−, and the whole molecule has a closed-shell structure. However, because of the low yield and the lack of availability of such species, their electrochemical properties have been insufficiently accessed.312 One of the reliable studies is related to Yb@C2n series,154 which are typical divalent mono-EMFs. The redox potentials of these Yb-EMFs are presented in Table 6. Their potential gaps are normally larger than 1.0 V, indicating their more inert redox reactivities relative to those of trivalent mono-EMFs. Both the first oxidation and the first reduction processes of Yb@C2n are more difficult than those of trivalent mono-EMFs but similar to those of singly bonded adducts of La@C2v-C82.

Monovalent EMFs have even lower production abundance. To date, the best studied species has been Li@C60,35,316,317 which is prepared by bombing a C60 film with Li+ plasma.13 Because its cation (i.e. Li+@C60) is much more stable than Li@C60, electrochemical studies were performed on Li+@C60. Compared with C60, the multiple and fully reversible reductions of Li+@C60 are much easier, whereas its oxidation process is difficult and invisible within the potential window of 0–1.0 V, suggesting that Li+@C60 is a better electron-acceptor than C60.
To this end, we conclude that the electrochemical behaviors of mono-EMFs largely depend on their electronic structural features, which might be either open-shell or closed-shell. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of these mono-EMFs are tunable, to some extent, by altering the cage structures, metal varieties and the nature of functional groups.


Di-EMFs and cluster-EMFs. 
Among di-EMFs, M2@C2n species (M refers to La, Ce in this section unless otherwise stated) are the earliest discovered EMFs and accordingly have also been widely investigated. It is believed that M2 generally transfers six valence electrons to the cage. Therefore, the electronic configuration of M2@C2n is described as (M2)6+@(C2n)6− without unpaired electron existing on the cage. For clear comparison, redox potentials of a series of M2@C2n are listed in Table 7. Compared to M@C2n, M2@C2n generally have higher first oxidation potentials and larger potential gaps (i.e. ΔE(oxE1 − redE1) > 0.5 V) (Table 5). Switching the metallic content from La2 to Ce2 engenders a negative shift (80 mV) of the first reduction potential, while their first oxidation potentials are almost unchanged. These results agree well with the computational studies, which suggested a cluster-dependent LUMO and a cage-dependent HOMO of M2@Ih-C80. Moreover, all the redox processes of M2@C2n are fully reversible, indicating the high stabilities of their redox states.

It is also believed that the cluster of M3N transfers six electrons to the cage. Their electronic configuration is accordingly described as (M3N)6+@(C2n)6−, similar to that of M2@C2n. However, the electrochemical behaviors of these nitride cluster EMFs are quite distinctive from other EMFs. On the one hand, the first reduction potentials of M3N@C2n are much more negative than those of mono-/di-EMFs as well as C60 (Table 7), suggesting the higher LUMO levels of M3N@C2n. On the other hand, their first oxidation potentials are generally lower than that of C60, which, in combination with the higher LUMO levels, results in slightly smaller potential gaps and/or smaller band gaps.

I
h-C80 is the most typical cage for encapsulating not only dimetallic clusters but also a trimetallic nitride cluster (M3N). Summarizing the redox potentials of M3N@C80 series, it is clear that their first reduction potentials are strongly dependent on the metallic content, while their first oxidation potentials are more sensitive to the cage structure. For instance, with an increase in cluster size from Sc3N to Y3N/Lu3N, the first reduction potential of M3N@Ih-C80 is shifted negatively by 150–160 mV, while the first oxidation potential is shifted positively by only 50 mV. However, switching the Ih-C80 cage to the D5h-C80 cage results in a much more facile oxidation process of Sc3N@C80: the first oxidation potential of the D5h-isomer is 250 mV lower than that of the Ih-isomer.53 These results are fully consistent with related theoretical calculations,55,318 which suggested the major LUMO distribution of Sc3N@Ih-C80 on Sc3N clusters and the major HOMO distributions of both Ih and D5h isomers on their cages.
Redox behaviors of M3N@Ih-C80 also show some common features. Particularly, M3N@Ih-C80 series generally show three irreversible reduction steps and two quasi-reversible oxidation steps in o-DCB.53 Further studies revealed that, along these irreversible reductions, aside from electrochemically generated anions, no chemical product could be detected. For instance, one-electron reductive electrolysis of Sc3N@Ih-C80 yields merely its anion. The latter can be recovered nearly quantitatively into the neutral species via a subsequent re-oxidation process. However, such irreversibility can be improved by increasing the scan rate or using toluene–acetonitrile as a solvent.319 One reasonable explanation is that the M3N cluster rotation becomes more hindered during reduction processes.320 However, no further information is available on how the change of cluster rotation affects the reversibility of reductions in the CV time scale. Additional studies are necessary.
However, TiSc2N@Ih-C80, which contains a non-group-3 metal Ti, was found to be an exception.61 Compared to most M3N@Ih-C80 species, it has much more facile one-electron oxidation and reduction as well as a smaller electrochemical gap. Also, unlike most M3N@Ih-C80 species, the redox processes of TiSc2N@Ih-C80 are fully reversible. Considering the similar electronic configuration of (TiSc2N)6+@(Ih-C80)6−, the authors believed that the influence of Ti might account for these distinctive redox behaviors. Cyanide cluster EMF Sc3NC@Ih-C80 has a similar electronic configuration of (Sc3NC)6+@(Ih-C80)6− but an additional endohedral carbon atom. Unlike Sc3N@Ih-C80, Sc3NC@Ih-C80 exhibits fully reversible reduction and oxidation processes.64 Additionally, its first reduction occurs at a lower potential relative to that of Sc3N@Ih-C80. These results suggest that the electrochemical behaviors of cluster-EMFs also respond sensitively to the endohedral compositions.
Several new metallic carbide fullerenes MxC2@C2n (M = Sc, Y; x = 2, 3, 4) have been recognized recently. In these molecules, the C2 unit is believed to have a formal charge ranging from −6 to −2, and accordingly the metallic carbide MxC2 has a formal charge of +7, +6, or +4. Specifically, among various carbide cluster EMFs, Sc3C2@Ih-C80 is special, in which Sc3C2 transfers approximately seven electrons to the cage, resulting in an open-shell structure.49 Thereby, it is not surprising that the redox features of Sc3C2@Ih-C80, such as the low first redox potentials and small potential gap (i.e. ΔE(oxE1 − redE1) < 0.5 V), are close to those of trivalent mono-EMFs. In contrast, other identified metallic carbide fullerenes MxC2@C2n (M = Sc, Y; x = 2 or 4) have closed-shell structures, consistent with their ESR-silent properties.71,75,245,290,321 Compared to that of Sc3C2@Ih-C80, ScxC2@C2n (x = 2 or 4) species exhibit more difficult one-electron reductions and much wider electrochemical gaps (ΔE > 1.0 V).
Summarizing, the electrochemical properties of cluster-EMFs including di-EMFs can be manipulated by altering the cluster composition. In addition, the magnitude of their HOMO–LUMO gaps varies with both the cage size and the composition of endohedral clusters.
Moreover, the electrochemical properties of the chemically modified di-EMFs and cluster-EMFs have been widely investigated. The redox potentials of some representative examples are listed in Table 7. Definitely, the chemical modifications on the cage can greatly change the EMF-based redox behaviors. For instance, the first oxidation potentials of bis-silylated M2@Ih-C80 (M = La, Ce) and Sc3N@Ih-C80 (i.e. Ce2@Ih-C80–(Mes2Si)2CH2277 and Sc3N@Ih-C80–(Mes2Si)2CH2210) are 510–640 mV lower than those of the pristine EMFs, while their reduction potentials are 190–340 mV higher than those of pristine ones. Such big change can be assigned to the strong electron-donating characteristics of the attached disilirane group. In contrast, when attaching strong electron-withdrawing groups onto the cage of EMF, such as the compounds of Sc3N@Ih-C80–(CF3)2327 and La2@Ih-C80–[C(CN)2]2O,206 the EMF moieties undergo more facile one-electron reductions.

6.2 Photophysical properties and photovoltaic devices
Recently, the macroscopic preparation of EMFs and the development of their chemistry allow investigations of their photophysical properties. Such efforts might facilitate the understanding on their electron-accepting or even electron-donating properties under photo-excitation conditions. In fact, EMFs have been used as electron acceptors for the construction of photovoltaic devices, displaying advantages, to some extent, over the C60-based acceptor materials.328,329
To improve the low solubility of pristine EMFs in common organic solvents, the PCBM-type derivatives of Sc3N@C80, Ce2@C80 and La2@C80 were synthesized.207,218,330 Because Sc3N@Ih-C80–PCBM has an absorption onset at 830 nm, a singlet excited state energy of 1.5 eV was derived. Regarding M2@Ih-C80–PCBM (M = La, Ce), their absorption onsets were observed between 1050 and 1200 nm, suggesting their singlet excited state energies of 1.20–1.03 eV. Upon photoexcitation, these PCBM derivatives showed visible changes in the differential absorption spectra especially in the near-infrared field (i.e. 900–1200 nm) on the pico-second scale, corresponding to the conversions from their ground states to singlet excited states. Unlike the slow decay of C60 singlet excited states, the singlet excited states of these EMF derivatives decay much faster (e.g. the lifetime of 84 ps for 1*(Sc3N@Ih-C80) and 30–40 ps for 1*(M2@Ih-C80)), yielding the triplet excited states as major products with the characteristic maxima between 550 and 590 nm. An “endohedral heavy-atom effect”331 is likely to account for these ultrafast singlet excited state decays.
Furthermore, EMFs have been combined with some typical electro-active chromophores such as ferrocene,332,333 triphenylamine (TPA),334 π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (ex-TTF),335 and porphyrin.199,207,293,330,336,337 The photophysical properties of the resulting dyads were investigated, with emphasis on estimating the electron-accepting or electron-donating abilities of EMFs under photo-excitation conditions. One of the early important works was the synthesis and characterization of a ferrocene (Fc) adduct of Sc3N@Ih-C80 (dyad 1 in Fig. 14).332 Unlike the C60 analogue, which is a 6,6-adduct, the ferrocene moiety is attached to Sc3N@Ih-C80 through a pyrrolidine-ring added on the 5,6-bond of Sc3N@Ih-C80. Upon photoexcitation, the featured differential absorptions corresponding to the radical ion pair (Sc3N@Ih-C80)˙−–Fc˙+ were observed. The longer lifetime of this radical ion pair state is remarkable in comparison with that of the C60–Fc analogue, indicating a stabilizing effect of the Sc3N@Ih-C80 moiety.
 Fig. 14  Structures of some typical EMF-dyads. 
Furthermore, the electron-accepting properties of Sc3N@Ih-C80 were investigated using TPA and zinc porphyrin (ZnP) as electron donors. The structures of Sc3N@Ih-C80–TPA dyads (2 and 3) and Sc3N@Ih-C80–ZnP dyads (4 and 5) are collectively presented in Fig. 14. They are all 5,6-pyrrolidine-adducts. More specifically, the TPA moiety is either N-substituted or attached at the 2-position of the pyrrolidine ring. The former substitution pattern allows the two electron-active moieties to align linearly with widest separation. Upon comparing the charge recombination processes of dyad 2 and its C60 analogues, a “stabilizing” trend is confirmed unambiguously for the Sc3N@Ih-C80 moiety.334 In benzonitrile (BzCN), the charge-separated state decays at a rate constant of 6.5 × 109 s−1 for C60˙−–TPA˙+, whereas 4.5 × 108 s−1 for Sc3N@Ih-C80˙−–TPA˙+. In dyads 4 and 5, Sc3N@Ih-C80 and ZnP are constructed via an ultra-long and rigid molecular bridge. Their charge-separated states are highly stabilized in BzCN with the lifetimes of 3.2 ms and 2.6 ms, respectively.336 These dyads might be useful for efficient solar energy conversion.
Recent studies demonstrated that di-EMF M2@Ih-C80 (M = La, Ce) might be another alternative electron acceptor. In 2011, Takano et al. reported the preparation of M2@C80–ex-TTF, a 5,6-pyrrolidine adduct (dyad 6 in Fig. 14).335 Upon photo-excitation, identified was a fast charge separation (6.0 × 1010 s−1) followed by the formation of a radical ion pair (La2@Ih-C80)−˙–exTTF+˙ with a lifetime as long as 3.7 ns in toluene. However, as compared to Fc or ex-TTF, ZnP is a weaker electron donor. When M2@C80 is combined with ZnP having a [6,6]-fulleroid structure, such dyads (7 and 8) undergo switchable charge-transfer events. Specifically, as revealed by spectroscopic analyses, there is an unprecedented change in photo-induced charge transfer chemistry in toluene and THF vs. BzCN and DMF, that is, the formations of radical ion pairs (M2)˙−@Ih-C80–(ZnP)˙+ in less polar solvents and M2@(Ih-C80)˙+–(ZnP)˙− in polar solvents. The proposed reasons include the following two factors: (i) the stabilizing effect of polar solvents such as BzCN and DMF lets (M2@Ih-C80)–1*(ZnP) and M2@(Ih-C80)˙+–(ZnP)˙− having comparable energy levels; (ii) the strong electronic coupling between the C80 cage and ZnP, which is associated with the face-to-face arrangement of two moieties and their close proximity, facilitates the fast charge separation between them instead of that between M2 and ZnP. In contrast, Sc3N@Ih-C80–ZnP (dyad 9) afforded only the Sc3N@Ih-C80˙−–ZnP˙+ radical ion pair irrespective of the solvent polarity. The Sc3N@Ih-C80˙+–ZnP˙− radical ion pair, however, is unlikely to be formed because of the thermodynamically uphill processes. Kinetically, the time-absorption profiles corroborate that the Sc3N@Ih-C80˙−–ZnP˙+ radical ion pair state decays at 2.3 × 1010 s−1 in toluene and 2.0 × 1010 s−1 in BzCN.
The photo-induced charge-transfer from porphyrin to the EMF moiety also occurs in the supramolecular systems of [ZnP]2⊃M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Lu, [ZnP]2 = dimeric porphyrin 4 in Fig. 10)293 and Li+@C60:MTPPS4− (anionic sulfonated porphyrins, M = H2 and Zn).337 Either the strong binding between [ZnP]2 and M3N@C80 or the low reductive potential of Li+@C60 was considered to promote such charge-transfer processes.
More practical work involves using EMFs as electron-acceptor materials of photovoltaics. In 2009, Ross et al. first reported the synthesis of Lu3N@C80–PCBH (see Fig. 14), and its integration in the active layer as an acceptor with the commonly used donor polymer poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT).328 The performance of this polymer/fullerene photovoltaic device was investigated by optimizing the blend ratio of two active components and the thermal annealing process.329 Consequently, the optimized P3HT/Lu3N@C80–PCBH devices with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V and a PCE of 4.2% were achieved under AM1.5G solar simulation conditions. These values are all higher than those of P3HT/C60–PCBM reference devices, underscoring the advantage of using Lu3N@C80–PCBH as electron acceptor materials. This result is consistent with the recent proposal that minimizing the LUMO energy offset of the donor–acceptor system can enhance the solar cell performance through larger Voc. Therefore, such improvement can be attributed to the higher LUMO level of Lu3N@C80 derivatives, which is closer to the LUMO level of the polymer donor (P3HT) than that of C60.
6.3 Magnetic and electronic transport properties
EMFs and their derivatives have been found to display novel magnetic and electronic transport properties, which have seldom been reported for their individual components (i.e. fullerene and metal ions).
Some of the recent studies were performed to measure their electron spin coherence times (T2). The aim is to estimate their potential for electron spin-based technologies such as spin labeling, spintronics, and quantum information processing. However, early studies showed that the great spin density of the fullerene cage resulted in much shorter electron-spin coherence times (T2). A T2 value of 600 ns for Sc@C82 in TCB at 2.5 K.261 and the coherence times (T1, T2) <1.5 μs for La@C82 in CS2 between 183 and 283 K were reported in early works.338 However, recently Brown et al. reported a maximum T2 for M@C82 (M = Y, Sc, La) in deuterated o-terphenyl, which is greater than 200 μs339 and comparable to that of N@C60 (T2 = 80–250 μs).340,341 This result suggests that it is possible for EMFs to hold a single electron spin with long coherence times. Consequently, such spin-active species might be good alternatives of N@C60 in future spin-state quantum engineering, if taking into account of their higher production yield and relatively facile isolation process.
Transport property is another interesting topic, considering the unique electronic structures of EMFs. An early work examined La2@C80 fabricated thin film, which was used to construct field-effect transistors (FETs) showing n-type characteristic.342 However, the carrier mobility of this film was found to be much lower than that of the C60- or the C70-based film,343,344 probably because of the conduction mechanism through encapsulated metal ions. Particularly because the LUMO of La2@C80 is dominated by the orbital of the encapsulated La3+, the intermolecular overlap of LUMOs is quite small, which is unfavorable for the diffusion of electron carriers and results in the extremely low mobility of the La2@C80-based thin film.
In another study, the conductance of C60 and Ce2@Ih-C80 in single-molecule contacts created by STM was studied comparatively.345 Contacts including Ce2@C80 showed about one-fifth of the conductance of that including C60. Based on DFT calculations, the lower conductance of Ce2@C80 was explained by the absence of electron orbitals (LUMO) delocalized over the cage in the energy window of the conductance measurement. As a reference, C60 has a LUMO delocalized on the cage, resulting in a higher conductance. This result correlates well with the previous results, suggesting the poor transport property of M2@C80 (M = La, Ce) in either a bulk state or single-molecular level.
In contrast, La@C82 has a distinctive electronic structure, which is featured by the delocalized HOMO–LUMO on the cage and smaller band gap relative to that of C60 and M2@C80 (M = La, Ce). Accordingly, the transport property of La@C2v-C82 is different from those of C60 and M2@C80. In 2007, Tsuchiya et al. reported the unusual transport properties of La@C82(Ad)-based crystalline nanorods,346 which were prepared using a liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation method. The La@C82(Ad) nanorod-FETs showed p-type behavior as presented in Fig. 15a, while the analogues FETs fabricated from C60(Ad) nanorods and the thin films of La@C82(Ad) or C60(Ad) exhibited n-type behaviors in general. Consequently, the p-type characteristic of La@C82(Ad) nanorods is unique within fullerene-based FETs. The origin of such behaviors may relate to the nanointerfacial contact between the electrodes and La@C82(Ad) nanorods or the special electronic states in the rod-shaped La@C82(Ad). Thus, La@C82(Ad)-nanorod channels might be an important candidate for high-performance fullerene-FET devices. In addition, these La@C82(Ad) nanorods displayed unusual response to a magnetic field. As presented in Fig. 15b, the La@C82(Ad) nanorods orient perpendicularly to the magnetic field. This result contrasts to that for the C60-based nanorods, which usually have orientations parallel to the magnetic field. This observation indicates that the nanorods of La@C82(Ad) have a negative magnetic anisotropy: the magnetic susceptibility in the direction parallel to the rod axis is smaller than that in the direction perpendicular to the rod axis. Further studies are still necessary to clarify the mechanism of this anisotropy.

Very recently, flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurement, which is an effective tool for estimating the intrinsic carrier mobility of organic materials, was used to measure the carrier mobility of the La@C82(Ad) single crystal.347 Interestingly, the crystal exhibited anisotropic electron mobility behaviors. The highest mobility of μ > 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained along the long axis of the crystal under normal temperature and atmospheric pressure (see Fig. 16). This is also the highest value among those reported for organic conductors measured using TRMC. Consequently, the La@C82(Ad) single crystal can be regarded as a semi-metal with high conductivity. Further analysis revealed that the extremely small conduction-valence band-gap, which is 0.005 eV at the applied computational level, together with the short intermolecular distance of 2.60 Å in the La@C2v-C82(Ad) crystal might account for such high electron-mobility. Similarly, the intrinsic carrier mobility of the cocrystal of La@C82 and nickel porphyrin [NiII(OEP)] was investigated.348 The electron-mobility of the co-crystal, μ = 0.9 cm2 V−1 s−1, is much higher than that of the NiII(OEP) single-crystal (μ = 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1). Therefore, the La@C82 moiety is regarded as the main origin of the observed high mobility in the cocrystal. It was revealed that the small band-gap and short intermolecular distance in the cocrystals, which are similar to those of La@C82(Ad)-based single crystal, are both critical factors. In addition, like the crystal of La@C2v-C82(Ad), the conductivity of the cocrystal is anisotropic and the highest mobility was achieved along the c-axis of the crystal lattice.

6.4 Optical properties
Rare earth ions also have rich optical properties. Triggered by the discovery of EMFs, which generally encapsulate rare-earth ions inside the fullerene cage, some interest is directed to the optical properties of EMFs. Early works reported large nonlinear optical responses for both the solution of Dy@C82 and the solid thin film of Gd2@C80.349,350 The enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient was attributed to a metal–cage charge-transfer mechanism. More recently, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Y3N@C80 as well as Er2C2@C82 and Er2@C82 have been well studied.351,352 The light emission of Y3N@C80 was observed at around 710 nm, corresponding to the (HOMO → LUMO)0 transition. However, this emission is featured by a shorter lifetime relative to those of typical rare-earth ions (Er3+, Yb3+, Y3+, etc.) in solid state hosts, which is attributed to the significant cluster–cage interaction. More importantly, results showed that coupling the single Y3N@C80 molecule to a single gold nanoparticle caused a PL enhancement of two orders of magnitude.351 Therefore, this work provided a new concept for using rare-earth ions at the single emitter level. Comparative studies related to the PL spectra of di-erbiumfullerenes revealed that Er2C2@C3v(8)-C82 exhibited the most intensive PL from the encapsulated Er3+ at 1520 nm. The authors believed that this result correlates with the weak absorbance of C3v(8)-C82 at 1520 nm and the wider HOMO–LUMO gap of Er2C2@C3v(8)-C82 relative to that of Er2@C3v(8)-C82.352
6.5 Nanomedicines
Nanomedicine, a combinatorial approach taking advantage of nanotechnology in medical treatment, has emerged as an increasingly important field of research for diagnostics and theranostics. In recent years, fullerenes have attracted increasing attention in this field because of their nanometer size and unique properties. Especially, introduction of metallic species inside fullerene cages, forming EMFs, provides a novel platform for developing future nanomedicines with multiple functions. Different from fullerene nanomedicines, many recent studies related to EMF-based nanomedicines specifically examined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radio-diagnostics, and chemotherapeutics. In this review section, an exhaustive list of the various functionalized EMFs is provided along with their applications as nanomedicines. We also discuss and summarize the unique approaches, mechanisms, advantages, and the aspect of toxicity underlying the use of these EMFs for medical applications.

Imaging properties and MRI contrast agents. 
Exogenous agents containing paramagnetic ions, especially Gd3+, can greatly increase the longitudinal or transverse relaxation rate (r1 or r2; r1 = 1/T1, r2 = 1/T2) of water protons and thereby improve the imaging quality of living tissues. For instance, a gadolinium chelate Gd–DTPA (DTPA = diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid) provides T1 positive contrast in vivo MRI and has been widely used in modern clinical diagnosis.353 However, recent concern on the toxicity of current Gd-based contrast agents highlights the need for safer imaging agents with enhanced imaging capabilities.
EMFs can accommodate more than one gadolinium atom inside the cage and present an interesting alternative for future MRI agents. For such prospects, the most important advantage that EMFs offer is the cage protection on the toxic metal ions inside. Thereby metallic ions such as gadolinium ions can be shielded from the chemical or enzymatic activity within the body, and the unwarranted release of metals is minimized or even avoided. The large surface area of the fullerene cage also allows multiple hydrophilic functionalizations and the attachment of some tissue-targeting ligands. All these features provide opportunities for the application of gadofullerenes in MRI.354
To date, various water-soluble derivatives of gadofullerenes have been synthesized and investigated on their imaging properties. The archetype of these species is the multiply hydroxylated gadofullerene such as Gd@C82(OH)x355–357 and Gd@C60(OH)x.358 They both demonstrated improved relaxation profiles as compared with those of Gd-chelates. The r1 values of these gadofullerenols are remarkably higher (up to 10–40 times) than those of typical clinical agents such as Gd–DTPA. Table 8 presents the r1 relaxivities of some typical water-soluble Gd–EMF derivatives. Although the measurement conditions differ case by case, it appears that all the reported gadofullerenes such as Gd@C60[C(COOHyNa1−y)2]10,359 Gd@C82(OH)6(NHC2H4SO3H)8,360 and Gd@C82O6(OH)16(NHC2H4CO2H)8 (AAD–Gd@C82)361 generally show much higher relaxivities than Gd–DTPA. Furthermore, some gadofullerenes underwent in vivo imaging tests, and apparent T1-signal-enhancement was observed as compared with a control test with Gd–DTPA, suggesting the superior imaging properties of gadofullerenes over the Gd-chelate agents.

For better understanding the nice imaging property of these gadofullerenes, their relaxivity mechanism has been discussed widely. Unlike Gd-chelate complexes, the Gd3+ ions in fullerene cages are completely untouchable. Apparently, the classic inner sphere relaxation mechanism that results from the direct Gd3+–water coordination does not work for gadofullerenes. Much attention on how the shielded Gd3+ ions interact with surrounding water molecules has been paid. Generally, it is believed that the encapsulated Gd3+ ions interact with water protons via two pathways: (i) the spin–electron interaction between Gd3+ and cage carbons; (ii) the chemical proton exchange between the protonated sites on the cage surface and the surrounding water molecules.354 The latter corresponds to the so-called “inner-sphere like” mechanism. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed the strong dependency of gadofullerene relaxivities on the pH value or the salt content of bulk solution.358,362–365 Specifically, it was found that the relaxivities decreased dramatically with increasing pH value or salt content. This trend was proposed to be related to the disaggregation phenomena of gadofullerene nanoparticles under more basic or saline conditions. However, the aggregation of gadofullerenes has been considered to beneficially enhance relaxivities of gadofullerenes via the following mechanisms: (i) aggregated nanoparticles slow down the rotational correlation time of a single gadofullerene molecule, which increases the relaxivity; (ii) the interstitially confined water in gadofullerene aggregates can “deliver” the relaxation efficiently by much more rapid exchange with bulk water molecules, which is the so-called “outer-sphere” mechanism. Anyway, such a feature of tunable relaxivities makes gadofullerene derivatives excellent candidates for pH-responsive MRI contrast agent applications.
Moreover, additional studies have examined the gadofullerene derivatives with improved biocompatibility or tissue-targeting capability. One representative study is the synthesis of Gd3N@C80[DiPEG5000(OH)x] that bears both hydroxyl groups and a di-PEG5000 malonate group.287 Comparison with other gadofullerenes described above shows that this compound has much higher biocompatibility and a high T1 relaxivity. In 2008, Shu et al. reported the conjugation between gadofullerene derivative AAD–Gd@C82 and a tumor-targeting ligand such as an antibody (anti-GFPs) with the aim of introducing the specific targeting capability of gadofullerene.366 In another study, gadofullerene Gd3N@C80(OH)∼26(C2H4CO2H)∼16 was conjugated with 1L-13 peptides,367 successfully gaining the targeting ability towards brain tumor cells. These works made the first step towards development of the EMF-based MRI agent with locally targeting function.
More recent studies particularly addressed the constructions of EMF-based multi-functional nanoplatforms. For instance, in 2010, Dorn et al. reported the hybrid of M3N@C80@SWNH (M = Lu, Gd; SWNH = single walled nanohorn) and their conjugation with CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs).368Fig. 17A–E, respectively, show the T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T1 maps of various SWNH-based materials, the previously reported Gd3N@C80(OH)∼26(CH2CH2COOM)∼16, and the commercial Omniscan agent at similar concentrations. The contrast effect of the functionalized Gd3N@C80@SWNH is weaker than Gd3N@C80(OH)∼26(CH2CH2COOM)∼16, but it is still high enough for visualization. The QD fluorescence is also apparent in the in vivo image of the conjugate, indicating the bimodal capability of this conjugate. In another study, radioactive lutetium 177 (177Lu) together with tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (DOTA) were attached to a functionalized gadofullerene f-Gd3N@C80, yielding 177Lu–DOTA–f-Gd3N@C80.369 Compared with each individual component, such a conjugate is more suitable for effective brachytherapy because of the extended tumor retention and the histologic signs of radiation-induced tumor damage. Therefore, these efforts reveal that there is great promise for developing more elaborate EMF-based agents that are useful for dual modality imaging and/or brachytherapy.

Radiopharmaceuticals. 
If encapsulating radio-active metal, such as 166Ho and 177Lu, inside EMFs are expected to have the potential to work as radio tracers or delivering brachytherapy. The important advantage of such a strategy is, to the greatest extent, eliminating undesired toxicity of radionuclides that might be leaked from their conventional complexes.
Wilson et al. reported the preparation of 166Hox@C82(OH)y, obtained by irradiation of 165Hox@C82(OH)y.372 The following biodistribution studies demonstrated the feasibility of using this compound as a radiotracer. More recently, radioactive EMFs have been further developed for use in radioimmunotherapy of cancer treatment. In 2007, Diener et al. reported the synthesis of 212Pb@C60 using the recoil following α-decay of a parent radionuclide.373 Then, the stability of its carboxylated derivatives was also investigated via a biodistribution study, which revealed undetectable accumulation of 212Pb in bone but extremely slow clearance of this compound in the body. In another study, encapsulation of a radiolabeled cluster inside a fullerene cage, that is 177LuxLu(3−x)N@C80, was reported. The radioactive species was synthesized with a traditional arc-discharge method using 177LuCl3/Lu2O3 as the metal source. The isolated 177LuxLu(3−x)N@C80 was further conjugated with 1L-13 peptides and a fluorescent tag [tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA)].374 Comparison with the carboxylated 212Pb@C60 revealed that the conjugate containing 177Lu-EMF was more suitable for radiotherapeutic and radiodiagnostic applications.


Chemotherapeutic pharmaceuticals. 
In addition to the above-mentioned applications, gadofullerenes are also efficient antitumor candidates with neglectable cytotoxicity and in turn might have potential in chemotherapeutics. In 2005, Chen et al. reported the higher inhibitory activity of gadofullerenol nanoparticle [Gd@C82(OH)22]n on a tumor cell (hepatoma cell, H22) than other prevailing chemotherapy drugs.375 However, their experiments showed that only ca. 0.05% of the used dose was found in the tumor tissues, indicating that the gadofullerenol nanoparticles do not kill the tumor cell directly, which is in sharp contrast to conventional antineoplastic chemicals. The antitumor mechanism has been not yet fully clarified. According to more recent studies, the actual functions of gadofullerenol nanoparticles might involve improving immunity,376,377 inhibiting angiogenesis, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS),378–380 and selectively targeting to tumor sites.381
Additionally, Chen et al. reported that Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles can stimulate T cells (i.e. T lymphocytes) and macrophages to release significantly greater quantities of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α). Such proteins can induce an immune response and efficiently eliminate tumor cells.376 When Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles were compared with other nanoparticles of carboxyfullerene C60(C(COOH)2)2 and fullerenol C60(OH)22 in terms of their antioxidative properties,379 it was revealed that the gadofullerene derivatives were protected against oxidative injury to cellular mitochondria better than the other two empty-fullerene derivatives. Therefore, gadofullerenes might be more valuable for in vivo cytoprotective and therapeutic purposes. More recently, for estimating the potential clinical use of gadofullerenes, the biosafety of the Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles was investigated: no toxic effect was found on the well-established toxicological testing model, C. elegans. Such features in combination with the high anti-tumor efficiency afford Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles great advantages towards clinical use in the near future.

7. Concluding remarks and perspectives
An overview of the current status of research related to EMFs has been given in this article, together with descriptions of several promising applications in related fields. The development and even structural recognition of EMFs remain in early infancy and critical challenges are waiting ahead which are as tough as or even more difficult than before, for scientists to explore in the future.
The availability of EMFs is much less than sufficient for either academic exploration or real application. Using the currently most effective arc-discharge method, the most abundant Sc3N@C80 is obtainable in the gram scale, which is exciting because such an amount is truly abundant for elucidating its structure and intrinsic properties. Nevertheless, other EMF species are much less yielded and are more difficult to separate because of the numerous possible isomers and because of their low stability. Consequently, more powerful synthetic methods and more efficient separation strategies are highly demanded to increase the availability of EMFs. Optimally, selective and controllable synthesis of certain species with desired structures and properties should be a final solution to their long-lasting survival.
Meanwhile, the intrinsic properties of EMFs, especially the chemical reactivity associated with the encapsulated metallic species, have not been fully understood. Since the chemical transformation of EMFs is viewed as the most efficient means to generate useful EMF-based materials, rational design and controllable construction of nanostructures or microstructures of EMFs and their derivatives are expected to be the main concerns in EMF research in the next decade.
Finally, practical applications of these fascinating materials are also awaiting detailed exploration. Because of the presence of the metallic species, which are the mainstay of many novel electronic, magnetic and optic applications, every detail of the functions of both the fullerene cage and the metallic core must be investigated.
In spite of the difficulties listed above, collaborative efforts may ensure that EMFs, as young members of the artificial carbon family, will find their right position in the carbon community and might be more useful than their relatives such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene in the near future, because of the presence and hybridization of the internal metallic species, as well as the diversity of both the cages and the metal core.
