    , Accepted 12th August 2022First published on 12th August 2022AbstractTypical transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphdiyne (GDY) often form type-I heterojunctions, which will limit their applications in optoelectronic devices. Here, type-II heterojunctions based on GDY and TMDs are constructed by introducing Janus structures. An intrinsic type-II heterojunction is presented when the GDY is in contact with a Se-terminated layer, but a type-I heterojunction would appear when it is in contact with the S-terminated surface. Such a difference in band alignment can be attributed to the interaction between the dipole moment formed by the Janus structure and the graphdiyne layer. Furthermore, for heterojunctions in contact with the S-terminated layer, they can be converted into type-II heterojunctions by a small external electric field (for WSSe, only 0.05 V A−1 is required). This approach can suggest a convenient design strategy for the application of graphdiyne in a wider range of applications.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) transition dichalcogenides (TMDs), as representatives of 2D materials, have been widely studied and show great potential for optoelectronic applications, high-end electronic devices and photocatalysts due to their unique physical properties and excellent electronic and optical performance.1–9 In 2017, Lu et al. reported a synthetic strategy to break the out-of-plane mirror symmetry in monolayer MoS2 by fully replacing the top-layer S with Se atoms and formed a new monolayer, the Janus MoSSe.10 With two different surfaces and an intrinsic built-in electric field induced by symmetry breaking, two-dimensional Janus transition dichalcogenides show enriched functionality and potential in the fields of optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, water splitting, spintronics and valleytronics.11–14 For example, Ma et al. reported that MoSSe exhibits pronounced visible-light absorption efficiency, possesses suitable band edges and high carrier mobility and is a potential water-splitting photocatalyst.15 Based on density functional calculations, Ju et al. also indicated that the Janus WSSe monolayer is an excellent photocatalyst for water splitting with high carrier separation.16 Faster exciton formation and longer exciton radiative recombination lifetime in Janus MoSSe and WSSe monolayers compared to their pristine samples were revealed by Zheng et al.17 These research studies demonstrate the excellent optical and electronic properties of Janus MoSSe and WSSe.
Compared to individual 2D nanosheets, van der Waals heterostructures present superior properties and excellent performance and are highly tunable via a wide selection of layer composition, strain, electric gating and doping, which makes they promising as nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.6,18–21 Graphdiyne (GDY), the most stable carbon network with an intrinsic direct band gap of 0.46 eV (PBE) and a high electron mobility of 2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1,22 has attracted wide interest in different fields due to its excellent electrical and optical properties and potential applications in the fields of energy, catalysis, electronics and optoelectronics.23–31 Furthermore, GDY has been introduced into solar cells to improve their performance. For example, by dual doping GDY in PCBM and ZnO films of perovskite solar cells, Li et al. increased the electrical properties, electron mobility and charge extraction ability in the electron transport layers and boosted the efficiency up to 20.0%.32 GDY was also introduced into the PCBM layer of solar cells as an electron transport layer and enhancement in the average power conversion efficiency was observed.33 Enhanced photocurrent in heterostructures formed between CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films and GDY was reported by Guo34 and Bi et al.35 Inspired by these research studies and the excellent optical and electrical properties of both TMDs and GDY, we would expect that the heterostructures based on TMDs, e.g. MoS2 and GDY, will show potential in the applications of optoelectronics and photocatalysts. However, heterostructures based on MoS2 and GDY exhibited an intrinsic type-I band alignment36 while a type-II band alignment is favored in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysts which will separate electron-hole pairs spatially and reduced the recombination rate. Due to the breaking of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in Janus TMDs, it is possible to contact GDY with different sides of Janus TMDs which may possibly tune the band alignment of the heterostructures based on GDY and Janus TMDs and makes it more promising in the applications of optoelectronics and photocatalysts.
Therefore, in this work, we have performed first-principles calculations to study the structural and electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures based on GDY and XSSe (X = Mo, W). The electronic properties under external electric fields are also explored since external electric fields have been proven to be an effective way to tune the electronic properties such as the band gap and the band alignment of van der Waals heterostructures.
2. Computational details
Our first-principles calculations were based on density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).37,38 The general gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)39 form was selected to describe the exchange and correlation energy. The frozen-code projected-augmented wave (PAW)40 method was used to describe the electron-ion interaction and the cutoff energy of the plane-wave basis set is 520 eV. The DFT+D3 method proposed by Grimme41 was chosen to describe the weak van der Waals interactions. A vacuum more than 20 Å was used to avoid the artificial interaction between periodic slabs. The dipole corrections along the z-axis were considered.42,43 All the structures were fully relaxed with an 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack type k-mesh44 until the forces were less than 0.01 eV Å−1 The convergence criterion of energy was 10−6 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometrical structures and stability
In this section, we discuss the geometrical properties and stability of heterostructures based on XSSe (X = Mo, W) and GDY, which we would refer to as G@XSSe in the following. The lattice constants of optimized monolayer MoSSe, WSSe, and GDY are 3.23 Å, 3.23 Å, and 9.46 Å, respectively. For isolated monolayer MoSSe (WSSe), the bond distances of Mo–Se and Mo–S (W–Se and W–S) are 2.53 Å and 2.41 Å (2.53 Å and 2.42 Å), respectively. These results are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results.10,12,15,45,46 To build the G@XSSe heterostructures, we constructed a 3 × 3 supercell of XSSe to eliminate the lattice mismatch of the heterostructures. The lattice mismatch between GDY and XSSe was 2.4%, which was calculated as (1)where a and b represent the lattice constant of XSSe and GDY, respectively. To evaluate the effects of the contact of GDY with different sides of Janus XSSe, i.e., GDY comes into contact with a S-terminated layer (GDY-S contact) or a Se-terminated layer (GDY-Se contact), two types of structures for each G@XSSe were considered, thus, there were four heterostructures, i.e., G@SeMoS, G@SMoSe, G@SeWS, and G@SWSe. The stable configurations of G@XSSe are shown in Fig. 1 (other stacking configurations are shown in the ESI†). The lattice constants, interlayer distance and bond distance of G@XSSe at equilibrium states are shown in Table 1. After GDY and XSSe formed heterostructures, we can see from Table 1 that there are no significant changes in the geometrical structures compared to isolated XSSe. The interlayer distances between GDY and XSSe are all larger than 3.3 Å. These results indicate the van der Waals interaction between the two layers in the heterostructures. From Table 1, we can see that the differences between G@SXSe and G@SeXS in lattice constants and interlayer distance are very small, which demonstrates that contact types have little effect on the interaction between XSSe and GDY.

To investigate the stability of the four heterostructures, we calculated the binding energy of the heterostructures as EΔ = (EG@XSSe − EXSSe − EGDY)/N(2)where EG@XSSe, EXSSe, EGDY, and N are the total energies of the heterostructures G@XSSe, isolated XSSe monolayer and isolated GDY monolayer, and the number of the C atoms, respectively. The calculated binding energies of the four structures are shown in Table 1. The negative value of the calculated binding energies indicates the stability of the four structures. Furthermore, the calculated binding energies are comparable to the results obtained from other van der Waals heterostructures, which confirm the weak van der Waals interaction between GDY and Janus XSSe.47 It can be seen that the contact type has little effect on the binding between GDY and XSSe.
3.2. Electronic structures of G@XSSe
In this section, we investigate the electronic properties of G@XSSe. Fig. 2 shows the band structures of GDY and the Janus XSSe supercell, and projected band structures of heterostructures G@XSSe. For comparison, the band structure of GDY is plotted again in Fig. 2(b).
 Fig. 2  (a) Band structures of isolated GDY, supercell MoSSe and G@SeMoS, and G@SMoSe heterostructures, respectively. The black dots and blue lines in the band structures of G@SeMoS and G@SMoSe represent the projected bands of GDY and MoSSe, respectively. (b) Band structures of isolated GDY, supercell WSSe and G@SeMoS and G@SMoSe heterostructures, respectively. The black dots and blue lines in the band structures of G@SeWS and G@SWSe represent the projected band of GDY and WSSe, respectively. 
For isolated GDY and MoSSe(WSSe), both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are located at the Γ point and direct band gaps of 0.50 eV and 1.63 (1.77) eV at the PBE level were observed, respectively. After combining with GDY, both MoSSe and WSSe show an indirect band gap in each contact type. The VBM was still located at the Γ point while the CBM was located at around the M point. Such a direct–indirect transition was induced by the strain which was introduced into the heterostructures to minimize the lattice mismatch. The direct band gap of GDY was well preserved in the four structures. Therefore, the CBM of GDY and VBM of XSSe are both located at the Γ point in the four heterostructures.
As shown in Fig. 2, the contact type will remarkably change the band alignment and bandgap of G@XSSe. For heterostructures G@MoSSe and G@SMoSe are type-I heterointerfaces with a direct bandgap dominated by GDY while heterostructure G@SeMoS is a type-II heterointerface with a direct bandgap of 0.09 eV at the Γ point. In Fig. 2(a), we can see from the projected band structure of G@SeMoS that the CBM is contributed by GDY and the VBM is contributed by MoSSe. It will foster the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, the generated electrons will move on GDY, which is favorable for electron mobility. A similar conclusion can be drawn for G@WSSe except for that G@SeWS is a metal at the PBE level. To get a deeper insight, we calculated the total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of G@XSSe in Fig. 3. We can see that the VBM of G@SeMoS is mainly contributed by Mo-d orbitals, while the CBM is mainly contributed by C-p orbitals. For G@SXSe, the TDOS near the VBM and CBM are both contributed by C-p orbitals. Therefore, by changing the contact type between GDY and Janus MoSSe, we can greatly change the band alignment and bandgap of heterostructures G@MoSSe and make it appealing for the applications in the fields of photonics and optoelectronics.

To further analyse the effect of the contact type on the band structures of G@XSSe, we have calculated the planar averaged charge density difference and the planar averaged electrostatic potential of G@XSSe which are plotted in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. We know that Janus XSSe possesses an intrinsic dipole moment pointing from Se to S due to the difference of electronegativity between Se and S. When GDY comes into contact with Janus XSSe, the charge rearrangement in the interface (Fig. 4) will cause an interface dipole moment pointing from the GDY layer to Janus XSSe. Thus, for heterostructures G@SeXS, the dipole across the heterostructure increases and points from GDY to Janus XSSe while for G@SXSe it diminishes and points from Janus XSSe to GDY. Therefore, the difference of potential alignment between G@SXSe and G@SeXS may account for the different band alignments.

The insets show the charge density difference of each heterostructure with an isovalue of 0.0001 e Å−3. The blue and red regions represent the charge accumulation and depletion, respectively.

3.3. Electronic properties under an external electric field
For van der Waals heterostructures and external electric fields are an effective way to tune the electronic structures. Therefore, in this section, we discuss the effect of electric fields along the z-axis on the band structures of G@XSSe. The positive direction is defines to be from GDY to XSSe and the negative is just the opposite. We apply a perpendicular electric field in the range from −0.4 V Å−1 to 0.4 V Å−1.
The variations of bandgaps with external electric fields of the four structures are plotted in Fig. 6. For heterostructures G@XSSe, the variation of bandgaps with external electric fields can be characterized into three types, which we label in Fig. 6 as regions I–III. In region I, heterostructures G@XSSe are type-I heterostructures and the bandgap is dominated by GDY which varies little with external electric fields. In region II, the band alignment of G@XSSe is type-II and the bandgaps change with electric fields almost linearly. This results from the upward movements of the energy bands of XSSe relative to the energy bands of GDY upon an increased (decreased) positive (negative) electric field. The relation can be further described by the Giant Stark Effect (GSE). In region III, the bandgaps of G@XSSe are almost zero which indicates that G@XSSe has transformed into a metal.
 Fig. 6  The variation of bandgaps of (a) G@SeMoS, (b) G@SMoSe, (c) G@SeWS and (d) G@SWSe under external electric fields, respectively. 
More specifically, for heterostructures G@SeMoS(G@SeWS), negative electric fields in the range from 0 V Å−1 (−0.05 V Å−1) to −0.3 V Å−1 (−0.4 V Å−1) can effectively tune the bandgaps. This is attributed to the fact that G@SeMoS(G@SeWS) is intrinsically a type-II heterointerface (metal) (Fig. 2) in which the VBM of MoSSe (WSSe) is higher than GDY in energy and the increased negative electric fields will cause the downward movement of the VBM of XSSe relative to GDY. In contrast, for heterostructures G@SMoSe(G@SWSe), positive electric fields in the range from 0.2 V Å−1 (0.05 V Å−1) to 0.4 Å−1 (0.4 Å−1) can tune the bandgaps. This is due to the fact that G@SXSe is intrinsically a type-I heterointerface under zero electric fields in which the VBM and CBM are dominated by GDY (Fig. 2) and the increased electric fields will induce the upward movement of the VBM of XSSe relative to GDY. In conclusion, electric fields can efficiently tune the bandgaps of heterostructures G@XSSe and the contact type in G@XSSe will affect the response to electric fields.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically investigated heterostructures based on graphdiyne and XSSe (X = Mo, W). Unlike the heterostructures constituted by pure TMDs and graphdiyne, the Janus structure forms an intrinsic type-II heterojunction when a Se-terminated layer is in contact with the graphdiyne, which will facilitate carrier separation. However, when the S-terminated layer is in contact, it is still a type-I heterojunction. This difference can be attributed to the dipole moment direction of the Janus structure. Furthermore, since such heterojunctions will have a fast response to external electric fields, the type-I heterojunction can be converted to a type-II heterojunction when a small positive electric field is applied. These findings not only predict an intrinsic type-II heterojunction based on graphdiyne, but also provide an approach for graphdiyne to be used in a wider range of optoelectronic applications.
