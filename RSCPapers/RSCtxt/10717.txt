    , Accepted 11th May 2018First published on 15th May 2018AbstractIn this contribution, we report the working mechanisms of several processing additives for controlling the morphology of four all-polymer systems. The optical and electrical properties, photovoltaic performance, morphology and the dynamic process of film formation of these all-polymer systems were thoroughly examined. We revealed that the effect of additives is largely dependent on the aggregation behaviors of the polymers used. Here, the polymer acceptors with large planar structures have stronger inter-chain interactions, which make their morphology more susceptible to additive treatment compared to the donors. 1,8-Di(R)octane (R = Cl, Br, and I) additives can be applied to multiple all-polymer devices with improved efficiency due to their general capability to increase the crystallinity and extend the effective time during the film formation. Interestingly, DBrO outperforms the widely used DIO, obtaining a highest efficiency of 8.23% for the PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2) based all-polymer solar cells, indicating finer morphology control by a subtle change of the additive structure. In contrast, the addition of chloronaphthalene (CN) can alleviate the inter-chain interaction of polymers to prevent the formation of oversized domains, which make it especially efficient for systems using strongly aggregated polymers like P(NDI2OD-T2). Our results provide insight into processing additives and suggest guidelines to rationally select additives for nonfullerene solar cells.
1. Introduction
Nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs)1 based on novel conjugated semiconducting acceptors are promising technologies with the potential to extend the device absorption to the near-infrared region. Advances in molecular design, materials processing, and device engineering have together helped to achieve device performances that approach desirable metrics for widespread commercialization.2 Among the nonfullerene OSC candidates, solution-processed polymer–polymer (all-polymer) solar cells,1 which possess advantages like enhanced thermal and mechanical stabilities,3 have proven to be a viable alternative to the polymer/fullerene system. And the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) is now above 10.0%.4 For the polymer/fullerene system, optimizing the processing conditions of devices to achieve the desired active layer morphology is critical.5 A number of processing techniques, such as mixed solvents,6 additives,7 and thermal8 and solvent annealing,9 have been explored to control the bulk morphology to attain multiple structural requirements. Among them, the use of processing additives during solar cell device fabrication has become a conventional optimization technique and has a profound influence on the active layer morphology.8 Additives usually have a high boiling point and possess selective solubility to one of the active materials.10a The addition of these additives can usually simultaneously enhance the light absorption and charge carrier mobility as well as suppress charge recombination,7,10 which contribute to higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), ultimately enhancing the PCE.
All-polymer nonfullerene solar cells typically suffer from low Jsc and FF,11 which make their performance historically lag behind those of polymer/fullerene and polymer/molecule OSCs. One of the main restrictions to obtaining high-efficiency all-polymer solar cells is the poor phase separation caused by entanglement of the polymer chains in the all-polymer blend films.12 In the all-polymer BHJ composite, the phase-separated domains not only provide the interfaces for charge separation of the photo-generated excitons, but also serve as percolation pathways for the separated charge carriers that are to be transported to the respective electrodes.13 By this means, controlling the film processing parameters to improve the all-polymer film morphology is a promising strategy. However, such approaches are usually highly empirical and system dependent. Therefore, achieving an in-depth understanding of the processing parameters like solvent additives should in principle provide a more general guideline for film morphology optimization in all-polymer solar cells. Unfortunately, the use of additives has received only limited attention in high-efficiency nonfullerene solar cells to date,14 while it has been extensively explored in fullerene-based OSCs. It was reported that the most representative additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)7,10 also works effectively in some nonfullerene OSCs, including all-polymer solar cells.2,3 We have previously demonstrated a high performance all-polymer device using PTP8 as the donor and P(NDI2OD-T2) as the acceptor,14a in which the PCE could be enhanced by adding an extremely low content of DIO. Following this line of reasoning, it occurred to us that introducing different kinds of solvent additives into an all-polymer blend may result in different effects and better optimize the phase segregation of the bulk heterojunction. Thus, guidelines to rationally select processing additives in all-polymer solar cells are of importance and have to be established.
In this contribution, we systematically investigated the influence of a series of solvent additives on all-polymer solar cells. The addition of aromatic additives like 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)15 can effectively suppress over-crystallization of polymers, especially strongly aggregated polymer P(NDI2OD-T2). As a result, moderately intermixed phases and improved PCEs were achieved for all-polymer solar cells based on PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2), PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2)16 and PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2).4b On the other hand, 1,8-di(R)octane (R = Cl, Br, and I) additives have more universal capability and can be applied to multiple all-polymer systems to establish efficient carrier pathways for enhanced photovoltaic performance, by improving the crystallization of polymer acceptors like P(NDI2HD-T). In addition, it is very interesting to observe that all-polymer cells treated with a rarely investigated additive, 1,8-dibromooctane (DBrO), exhibit the best PCE of 8.23%, 7.10%, 3.33% and 4.30% for PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2), PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T), PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) and PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2) based devices, respectively, in comparison with PCEs of 5.75%, 4.64%, 2.40% and 3.12% for the devices without any additives. We revealed that both the structure of additives and the crystallization behavior of polymers play an important role in fine tuning the all-polymer blend film morphology. Our work may provide insight to rationally select additives suitable for polymers with various crystallization behaviors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Characterization
UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750. Tapping-mode AFM images were obtained with a Veeco Multimode V instrument, and TEM images were recorded on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin Transmission Electron Microscope.
2.2 Solar cell device fabrication and characterization
Solution-processed solar cell devices with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (80 nm) and an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx (9 nm)/Ag (80 nm) were fabricated. The ITO-coated glass substrates were firstly treated with UV/ozone for 20 min; then a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH or Al 4083) layer was deposited and dried at 150 °C in an ambient atmosphere for 10 min, or a ∼40 nm ZnO (sol–gel method) thin film was deposited and dried at 200 °C in an ambient atmosphere for 10 min. Active layers were spun at a spin rate of 2000 rpm from PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) (w/w = 1.5/1.0, 10 mg mL−1, chloroform with/without additive, thickness: 70–80 nm), PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) (w/w = 1.5/1.0, 10 mg mL−1, chloroform with/without additive, thickness: 70–80 nm), PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2) (w/w = 2/1, 10 mg mL−1, chloroform with/without additive, thickness: 80–90 nm), and PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2) (w/w = 2/1, 10 mg mL−1, chloroform with/without additive, thickness: 80–90 nm), and the thickness was measured using a profilometer. Cathodes were deposited by sequential thermal evaporation of 0.6 nm of LiF followed by 80 nm of aluminum, or 9 nm of MoOx followed by 80 nm of silver for inverted devices. The device area is 7.25 mm2. The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a certified IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments, Inc, SolarCellScan 100).
2.3 GIWAXS
GIWAXS measurements were carried out at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated (Ek = 11.24 keV, λ = 1.103 Å) using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator and focused horizontally and vertically at the sample position (450 (H) × 60 (V) μm2 in FWHM) using a K-B-type focusing mirror system. The GIWAXS sample stage was equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the thin sample and the incidence angle of X-rays was adjusted to 0.12–0.14°. GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165, USA), and the X-ray irradiation time was 0.5–5 s depending on the saturation level of the detector. The diffraction angle was calibrated with a sucrose standard (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, b = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was approximately 232 mm. Samples for GIWAXS measurements were prepared by spin-coating polymer or polymer:PC70BM blend solutions on top of the Si substrates. The crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) were estimated using the following equation: , where FWHM is the full-width-at-half-maximum of the fitted Gaussian.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular structure and properties
The chemical structures, thin film absorption and energy levels of PTP8, PTQ1, PTzBI, P(NDI2HD-T) and P(NDI2OD-T2) are shown in Fig. 1. The donor polymers exhibit a wide band-gap of 1.78 eV (PTP8), 1.72 eV (PTQ1) and 1.76 eV (PTzBI). In comparison with the fullerene acceptors, the absorption of P(NDI2OD-T2) is broadened and exhibits complementary absorption with either PTP8 or PTQ1. However, subtle changes in the molecular structure have a notable impact on the relevant absorption: P(NDI2HD-T) exhibits blue-shifted absorption compared to that of P(NDI2OD-T2). To better understand the initial properties of these polymer acceptors, we performed temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption measurements on the polymers in diluted chlorobenzene solutions (0.01 mg mL−1).17 As shown in Fig. S1,† at elevated temperature (120 °C), both polymers are well dissolved and disaggregated. With gradually decreased temperatures, the polymers start to aggregate and their absorption spectra show red-shifts to different extents. The significant absorption shift of P(NDI2OD-T2) indicates strong aggregation of the polymer chains even in solution. In contrast, in the case of P(NDI2HD-T), the absorption spectra exhibit almost no shift, suggesting weaker interactions between polymer chains. It is worth noting that polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) already exhibits strong aggregation before film deposition, while polymer P(NDI2HD-T) exhibits a more amorphous nature. As shown in Fig. 1, nine representative and commercially available solvent additives, i.e.,1,5-diiodopentene (DIP), 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1,10-diiododecane (DID), 1,8-dichlorooctane (DClO), 1,8-dibromooctane (DBrO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and diphenyl ether (DPE), have been applied to optimize the all-polymer BHJ blend morphologies. The basic properties of these processing additives are shown in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 1c, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTP8, PTQ1 and PTzBI are higher than those of either P(NDI2HD-T) or P(NDI2OD-T2), indicating that the energy level positions of the donor and the acceptor are suitable for an efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. In contrast, hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor may be less efficient than electron transfer, judging from the smaller offset between the HOMO of the donor and the acceptor.

3.2 Additive effect on all-polymer solar cell performance
All-polymer solar cell devices were fabricated based on a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/all-polymer blend/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (80 nm), and the device area is 7.25 mm2. Here, we first carried out the optimization for the photovoltaic performance based on our efficient PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) system; the optimized blend ratio of PTP8 to P(NDI2OD-T) was found to be 1.5/1 (Table S2†), and the optimal active layer thickness was ∼70 nm. The J–V characteristics under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2) for all-polymer devices processed from chloroform with different processing additive solvents are shown in Fig. S2–S4,† and the performance parameters are listed in Table S3.† In general, nearly all the additives can improve device performance. However, the values of Jsc and FF vary significantly when adding different additives or the same additive in different amounts into PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) based all-PSCs. First, the length of the alkyl chain in the additive has a significant effect on the effect of the additives. As shown in Fig. S2,† in the case of 1,x-diiodinealkane additives, we find that DIO shows the best device performance, indicating that the length of the alkane can significantly affect the performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that the halogen atom (Cl, Br, and I) attached to the alkyl chain also influences the PCE of all-PSCs (Fig. S3†). It is interesting that the best results come from DBrO, rather than the widely adopted additive DIO. Finally, by adding aromatic additives like DPE and NMP, we also observe improved device performance (Fig. S4†). However, for another frequently used additive, CN, the Jsc starts to drop even at extremely low additive content (0.25%).
To better understand the additive effect on the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) device, we further investigated the dependence of device performance on the additive content using representative DClO, DBrO, DIO and CN (Fig. 2a and b), with the device parameters listed in Table 1. The solar cell device without additive treatment exhibits a high Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 8.21 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.5%, resulting in a best PCE of 4.64% for the as-cast devices. After adding DClO with an optimal content (1.0% vol), all the values of Voc, Jsc and FF exhibit notable enhancement, with a best PCE of 6.02%. Upon adding DBrO to the processing solvent at the same concentration, the Voc and Jsc further increased to 1.0 V and 10.83 mA cm−2, respectively, together with a best PCE of 6.50%. Lots of previous studies have shown that the inverted device structure can further improve device performance due to favorable vertical phase separation.18 We thought to adopt the inverted structure (ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/all-polymer blend/MoOx (9 nm)/Ag (80 nm)) to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the DBrO treated PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) blend. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the inverted devices with the same active layer exhibit improved FF relative to those using the conventional structure. The PCE can be further increased to 7.11%, which is among the best values reported for all-polymer solar cells.3,4,12,13 However, the Jsc (10.58 mA cm−2) and PCE (6.20%) decrease slightly when the conventional processing additive DIO is incorporated. Interestingly, for the device with only 0.5% vol CN addition, the FF (64.9%) and Voc (0.99 V) are notably improved compared to that in the as-cast device; however, the Jsc unexpectedly decreases to 6.42 mA cm−2, resulting in a similar PCE (4.15%) compared to that of the as-cast device (4.25%). When the CN content is further increased to 1.0%, the Jsc, FF and Voc decrease dramatically, and the PCE reduces to ∼2.0%. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, we also used DClO, DBrO, DIO and CN in a similar all-polymer system, PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2), using a different polymer acceptor, P(NDI2OD-T2). Similarly, the 1,8-di(R)octane (R = Cl, Br, and I) additives can improve the photovoltaic performance, and the DBrO treated devices demonstrate the best PCE of 3.33%, in comparison with the 2.40% of the control device. However, solar cell devices treated with CN exhibit a quite different trend. The PCE gradually increases and a maximum value of 3.32% is achieved with the addition of 1.0% CN. Note that the optimal device performance is comparable to that of the DBrO treated devices. We hypothesize that the effect of CN treatment on device PCE is attributed to the difference in the polymer acceptor, since the device structure and processing conditions are almost the same for PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) and PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T).

In order to examine the compatibility of these additives in other systems using different donor polymers, we used DClO, DBrO, DIO and CN on two other representative all-PSCs based on PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2)16 and PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2).4b As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, we investigated the device performance as a function of additive content. In general, both of the all-polymer systems exhibit similar trends compared to those observed in PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) and PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) cases: (1) additive 1,8-di(R)octanes (R = Cl, Br, and I) can improve the photovoltaic performance; (2) solar cell devices treated with DBrO produce the best PCE value; and (3) solar cell devices treated with CN exhibit improved PCE when using polymer acceptor P(NDI2OD-T2). PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2) and PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2) based devices exhibit a highest PCE of 4.30% and 8.23%, respectively, significantly enhanced from 3.12% and 5.75% for devices without any treatment. The less efficient additive CN in the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) system again works quite well for both systems. PCEs of 3.85% and 7.59% were obtained, which are comparable to those of the champion devices. Their crystallization behaviors are quite different from those of amorphous P(NDI2HD-T) and P(NDI2OD-T2) based all-polymer blends, which might result in the different effect of CN. Therefore, the operating mechanisms of the additives for controlling the film morphology in these all-polymer blends need to be thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, a kinetic description of the development of the all-polymer BHJ morphology during deposition, particularly with the processing additives, needs to be clearly presented, which is important for establishing guidelines to rationally select processing additives for all-polymer solar cells.

3.3 Additive effect on charge carrier disassociation, generation and transport

Fig. 4a depicts the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data to confirm the photocurrent. The integrated EQE spectra of the all-polymer cells agree well with the Jsc measured for the same device (within 5% error). Devices processed with DClO, DBrO and DIO show increased EQE value by a factor of approximately 1.5 between 400 and 700 nm compared with the control devices. Unfortunately, the EQE spectrum of the device prepared with the CN additive exhibits an average value of only ∼30% in the whole region, suggesting weaker conversion of incident light into photocurrent. Fig. 4b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) thin films with different additives at optimal content. When PTP8 is blended with P(NDI2HD-T) without any additive, the absorption peaks are quite distinct. The neat polymer film absorption shown in Fig. 1b reveals that the donor polymer PTP8 exhibits peaks at 360 nm, 550 nm and 620 nm, while the polymer acceptor P(NDI2HD-T) shows two peaks at 350 nm and 600 nm. The peaks become more pronounced when the processing additives are introduced. It is quite clear that the absorption peaks of P(NDI2HD-T) (at ca. 350 nm) and PTP8 (at ca. 620 nm) are enhanced significantly with almost all solvent additives. Such an increase in the peak intensity indicates that the intermolecular interaction is stronger, due to enhanced local structural order.10b,14a However, when using CN the vibronic peak of PTP8 (at ca. 620 nm) diminishes significantly, which may be attributed to reduced local structural order of the donor polymer. In order to investigate the charge generation and extraction process in PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) solar cells after using solvent additives, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph)19 on the effective voltage (Veff) was recorded under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4c). For a large reverse voltage (Veff > 1.0 V), Jph becomes saturated except for the CN treated device. The difference in the saturation region shows that more charges are generated in the devices processed from DClO, DBrO and DIO additives. The higher Jph–Veff characteristic from the DClO, DBrO and DIO processed devices reveals the positive effect of the additives on the reduction of bimolecular recombination, resulting in more efficient extraction of free charges at a low effective voltage, at which the maximum power output condition of the solar cells occurs.11,17c The charge carrier mobility was then studied by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method,20 which is an important factor for all-polymer solar cell device performance. Fig. S7† shows the J–V curves of the electron-only device with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/blend/Li/Al and the hole-only device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/MoOx/Ag. The experimental results were fitted and the mobilities were calculated, revealing that the pristine PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) blend has electron and hole mobilities of 5.5 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 3.6 × 10−6 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When optimal DClO, DBrO, DIO and CN were added, the electron mobility increased to 7.0 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 8.3 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 7.5 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, and 1.2 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the hole mobility increased to 1.5 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 2.8 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 2.5 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, and 1.2 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4d, the electron and hole mobilities are more balanced in the blend film processed with the DBrO additive. The balanced carrier transport may contribute to its higher device performance.

3.4 Additive-concentration dependent UV-vis absorption
In order to gain insight into the role of additives in controlling the all-polymer blend morphology, we conducted additive content-dependent UV-vis absorption measurements. As shown in Fig. S5,† with the gradually increased loading of DClO, DBrO, DIO and CN (from 0% to 20%, v/v), the absorbance of diluted PTP8 solution decreased. For control comparison, we also measured the solution absorption with the addition of the same amount of host solvent to exclude the effect of dilution. The absorption spectra of PTP8 with DClO, DBrO, DIO, CN and chloroform are nearly indistinguishable, which indicates that the addition of additives will not cause serious aggregation or disaggregation of PTP8 in the solutions. Additionally, we also performed the same measurements on diluted acceptor polymer solutions (see Fig. 5 and S6†). The acceptor polymer solutions exhibit quite different changes. When gradually increasing the loading of DClO, DBrO and DIO in P(NDI2HD-T) solutions, the absorption spectra start to red-shift, and a new peak at ∼600 nm emerges and becomes stronger upon 30% additive addition. These absorption shifts may indicate strong aggregation of the polymer in the pristine solution by using 1,8-di(R)octanes. However, when gradually increasing the loading of CN in P(NDI2HD-T) solutions, the absorption peaks (at ca. 380 nm) are considerably weakened and exhibit almost no red-shift, which is a significantly different trend compared to the cases of DClO, DBrO and DIO. We then used CN on the highly aggregated polymer P(NDI2OD-T2). As shown in Fig. 5d, the absorption peaks (at ca. 380 nm) are significantly weakened and the absorption spectra exhibit a ∼100 nm blue-shift. These results demonstrate that CN may prevent strong aggregation in the polymer acceptor for better polymer dispersion. It is worth noting that CN can affect the packing of PTP8 in the blend film as mentioned above, while it has only a negligible effect on the pure PTP8. We speculate that CN can reduce aggregation of the acceptor and hence increase the mixing of the donor and acceptor, resulting in decreased packing of PTP8 in the blend film. The more apparent effect of CN on the polymer acceptor may be derived from their similarity in chemical structure.

3.5 Additive effect on the all-polymer blend morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were then employed to study the morphology. As shown in Fig. 6a, the blend film processed without any additive forms relatively large coarse phase-separated domains. We find that the fibril aggregation increased when DClO, DBrO and DIO were introduced. The nanoscale network and reduced phase separation seem more apparent. A dramatic change in the surface morphology is found for the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) film processed with CN. The film exhibits isolated domains and the roughest surface morphology, which may increase charge carrier recombination. This result is in agreement with the lower PCE and photocurrent in solar cell devices adopting CN as an additive. The TEM images of the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) blend films treated with different additives exhibit a similar behavior. Apparently, the as-cast PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) blend film exhibits a certain amount of interconnected polymer nano-fibers, which are beneficial for carrier transport. By adopting DClO, DBrO or DIO as processing additives, the decreased solubility of P(NDI2HD-T) in additives and extension of the film drying process may promote the separation of the acceptor polymer in the blend, leading to purer domains and a more apparent network. In contrast, the blend film with CN treatment exhibits an unfavorable morphology with a less interconnected network structure, which may be induced by the increased solubility of the acceptor polymer P(NDI2HD-T) in CN according to the additive content-dependent UV-vis absorption measurements.

We also conducted two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2d-GIWAXS)21 on the same films that had been used for the morphology characterization (Fig. 7). Fig. 7a presents the GIWAXS patterns of neat films and blend film cast with/without additives. To quantify the scattering data, the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane cuts are given in Fig. 7b. A broad peak at q = ∼1.7 Å−1 and q = ∼1.5 Å−1 arises in the out-of-plane direction in neat PTP8 and P(NDI2HD-T) films, respectively, which corresponds to the π–π stacking peak. This result indicates that both PTP8 and P(NDI2HD-T) have a preferred face-on orientation with respect to the substrate. The PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) blend film without any additive shows a (100) reflection peak at q = ∼0.25 Å−1 and a sharp lateral scattering signal (200) at qxy = ∼0.60 Å−1 in the in-plane direction. Also, a broad signal is present at qz = ∼1.65 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, and it is indicative of face-on π–π stacking. Interestingly, the addition of additive DClO, DBrO or DIO results in enhanced scattering reflections at qxy = ∼0.60 Å−1 and qz = ∼1.50 Å−1, which correspond to the (200) and (010) peaks of P(NDI2HD-T), respectively. Based on these results, we may conclude that the polymer acceptor P(NDI2HD-T) in the DClO, DBrO and DIO additive treatment can produce more crystalline and ordered structures in the blend films. In the case of the CN treated blend film, we observe a notably decreased (010) (qxy = ∼1.7 Å−1) peak of PTP8. Moreover, the (200) diffraction peak of P(NDI2HD-T) is also weakened. However, the (010) (qxy = ∼1.5 Å−1) peak of P(NDI2HD-T) is unexpectedly enhanced. These results imply that CN treatment diminishes the crystalline stacking structure of PTP8 and the lamellar packing of P(NDI2HD-T). A similar trend can be found in the PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) all-polymer blend. As shown in Fig. S8,† polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) exhibits much stronger crystallinity with an ordered face-on orientation. Hence we can observe the obvious aggregation of P(NDI2OD-T2) in the as-cast PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2) blend. The addition of CN can effectively diminish the over-crystallized P(NDI2OD-T2) domains.

D and A stand for donor and acceptor, respectively. 
Crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) were calculated from Gaussian fitting22 of the “lamellar” (200) and π-stacking (010) diffraction peaks (Fig. 7b) to further investigate the effect of solvent additives on the degree of polymer crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 7c, the CCLs from the (010) peak of P(NDI2HD-T) in the out-of-plane direction exhibit an increasing trend: none (1.02 nm) < DClO (1.32 nm) < DBrO (1.51 nm) < DIO (1.46 nm) < CN (1.87 nm), and the CCLs from the (200) peak in the in-plane direction exhibit a similar trend: none (5.71 nm) < DClO (6.61 nm) < DBrO (7.85 nm) ≈ DIO (7.30 nm) > CN (4.70 nm). These structural analyses reveal that the 1,8-di(R)octane additives can promote improved intermolecular organization of the polymer acceptor. Meanwhile, the CCLs from the (010) peak of PTP8 in the out-of-plane direction show a different trend: none (2.56 nm) > DClO (1.98 nm) < DBrO (2.11 nm) < DIO (2.20 nm) > CN (1.54 nm). This is not surprising since the 1,8-di(R)octane additives don't promote the aggregation of donor polymer PTP8, as indicated by the additive dependent UV-vis absorption measurements.
3.6 The mechanism of the additive in engineering the all-polymer blend morphology
Assisted by detailed characterization of the all-polymer blend morphology together with systematical device investigation, we propose a schematic illustration for the BHJ blend morphology of the all-polymer cells under different processing conditions. As shown in Fig. 8, we have proposed a cartoon picture to present the working mechanisms of solvent additives for the all-polymer BHJ blend morphology, especially at the polymer–polymer interface in high-efficiency all-polymer solar cells. We have shown that adding 1,8-di(R)octane additives, especially DBrO, can enhance the polymer acceptor crystallinity, promoting the formation of large ordered acceptor domains and improving donor–acceptor phase separation in the all-polymer BHJ blend film. In contrast, another widely spread additive CN can finely disperse the aggregates of the polymer acceptor, promoting the formation of uniform domains and well mixed donor/acceptor polymer phases before film deposition. Thus CN is more effective in systems with strongly aggregated polymers like P(NDI2OD-T2) to prevent the formation of oversized domains, while it is less effective in systems requiring enhanced crystallization for carrier transport. According to a previous report on polymer/fullerene solar cells,10b a possible explanation as to why DBrO produces the best performance in all three all-polymer systems may be that the Br atom bears an appropriate partial negative charge and the polymer acceptor is electron-deficient, which may result in the desired interaction between DBrO and polymer acceptors, leading to an optimal morphology.

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated the effect of several processing additives on controlling the BHJ morphology of all-polymer organic solar cells based on PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T), PTP8/P(NDI2OD-T2), PTQ1/P(NDI2OD-T2) and PTzBI/P(NDI2OD-T2) systems. The optical properties, electrical properties, photovoltaic performance, film morphology and the dynamic process of film formation of these all-polymer systems were thoroughly examined. We revealed that the effect of additives is largely dependent on the aggregation behaviors of the polymers used. In our system, the polymer acceptors with large 2D planar structures have stronger inter-chain interactions, which make their morphology more susceptible to additive treatment compared to the polymer donors. The series of 1,8-di(R)octane (R = Cl, Br, and I) additives can be applied to multiple all-polymer devices with improved performance due to their general capability to increase the polymer crystallinity and extend the effective time during the film formation. Especially, the additive DBrO outperforms the widely used DIO, indicating finer morphology control by a subtle change of the additive structure. In contrast, the addition of aromatic additive chloronaphthalene (CN) can alleviate the inter-chain interaction of polymers to prevent the formation of undesired oversized domains, which make it especially efficient for systems based on strongly aggregated polymers like P(NDI2OD-T2). In summary, our results provide insight into the mechanism of functionalized processing additives in improving the nano-morphology of all-polymer solar cells and suggest guidelines to rationally select processing additives for high performance nonfullerene organic solar cells.
