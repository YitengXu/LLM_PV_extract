    , Accepted 17th June 2016First published on 21st June 2016AbstractTwo random copolymers based on (2,5-difluorophenylene)dithiophene and dialkoxybenzothiadiazole with benzodithiophene (P1) or thiophene (P2) as the third conjugated bridge having sulfur and fluorine (S⋯F) and/or oxygen (S⋯O) non-covalent intramolecular interaction are synthesized and characterized. In spite of a molecular weight difference over three times between both polymers, P1 and P2 possess similar solubility in organic solvents and thermal stability (Td ∼ 320 °C), which means probably due to that P1 with bulky alkylthiophene substituted benzodithiophene as a third conjugated bridge has less non-covalent intramolecular interaction than that of P2 with thiophene as a bridge. Both polymers were used as electron donors in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPV) with PC71BM as an acceptor. From the photovoltaic measurements it was revealed that P2 shows higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6.82% than that of P1 (2.44%). After 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) treatments as a processing additive, the P1 and P2 devices show a significantly improved PCE of 5.95% for P1 and 7.71% for P2. The surface morphology analysis of the blend films using the atomic force microscope (AFM) reveals that the P1:PC71BM film shows macrophase separation, while the P2 film has a smooth morphology. After DIO treatments, the morphology of both polymer blend films is improved with better bi-continuous nanoscale networks. Charge carrier mobilities through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method demonstrate that P2 with the thiophene bridge has higher charge carrier mobilities than P1. In particular, an inverted structured BHJ OPV with P2 exhibits a PCE of 8.50%, which is the highest PCE reported in the literature regarding random copolymers.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have progressed markedly over the last decade due to their many advantages such as flexibility, visible transparency, aesthetically pleasing appearance, light weight and low cost process.1–3 Great efforts have been devoted to enhance the performance of BHJ OPV. One of the most representative approaches has been developing broad and low band-gap (LBG) polymers that can increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) due to extending the absorption range into the visible to near-infrared regions. The most successful strategy for designing LBG-conjugated polymers could be the donor (D)–acceptor (A) approach, which involves alternation of a conjugated electron-rich donor and a conjugated electron-deficient acceptor within the polymer chain.4,5 D–A polymers have been employed to rationally tune the optical band-gap via intramolecular charge transfer, improving the electronic and optoelectronic properties, charge mobility, and crystallinity through the design and modification of the D and A units.6–8
Another approach to achieve a low and broad band-gap is the synthesis of a random copolymer consisting of more than three different monomers.9–12 By controlling the selection of monomers or the ratio of composition, these polymers can adjust the energy level, molecular ordering, charge-carrier mobility, and absorption range. In addition, the solubility and degree of aggregation of the polymers can be controlled.
On the other hand, the molecular packing properties of donor polymers are very important in addition to the LBG properties for high performance OPV. A highly ordered packing structure in the solid-state relies strongly on the degree of torsion between the backbone repeating units. To promote macromolecular planarity, non-covalent intramolecular interactions such as S⋯F and S⋯O interactions in conjugated polymer backbones have previously been employed.13–18 These conjugated molecules with the S⋯O or S⋯F interaction cause extended conjugation of the π-orbital due to a diminished torsion angle, which induces strong π–π stacking properties. For instance, Kim et al. demonstrated that the 2,2-(2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene-based copolymers with S⋯F interaction have high alignment and vertical ordering properties in the film, which induced a faster field-effect hole mobility of more than three times compared to that without the S⋯F interaction polymer.14 Recently, Woo and Kim et al. demonstrated a thiophene-alkoxybenzothiadiazole-based alternating copolymer to maximize the planarity with a minimal torsional angle due to the sulfur (from thiophene)⋯oxygen (from alkoxy) intramolecular interaction. In addition, this polymer showed a relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.87 V, which was one of the highest values among thiophene-based polymers at the time.15 More recently, they reported a semi-crystalline LBG polymer with S⋯O and S⋯F non-covalent conformational locks using 2′-thiophene-2,5-alkoxyphenylene and difluorobenzothiadiazole, with a face-on orientation, resulting in OPV efficiency of up to 9% in a thick film.16 Sometimes such non-covalent intramolecular interactions, however, may induce low solubility.19
In this study, we introduce the synthesis and characterization of two random copolymers, P1 and P2, with S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions using (2,5-difluorophenylene)dithiophene and dialkoxybenzothiadiazole with benzodithiophene or thiophene as a bridge via Stille polymerization. The addition of a third conjugated bridge was expected to improve solubility while maintaining S⋯O and S⋯F non-covalent intramolecular conformational locks. From the photovoltaic measurements it was revealed that the P2 can raise the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by up to 6.82%, higher than the 2.44% by the P1 polymer, because P2 has non-covalent intramolecular interactions to promote macromolecular planarity, while P1 can induce steric hindrance by the collision between the bulky ethylhexyl-thiophene of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and the dodecyloxy side chain of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) to decrease planarity. With additive treatments, the P1 and P2 devices had better PCEs (up to 5.95% for P1 and 7.71% for P2) and different PCE-enhancement degrees probably due to the different degree of planarity between P1 and P2 and different solubility in the additive. Notably, the P2 polymer in the inverted OPV produced a PCE of 8.50%, with the highest PCE so far reported for OPVs using random polymers. These results indicate that the newly synthesized random polymer can be a promising LGB donor material for high-performance solar devices.
Experimental
Materials and characterization
All starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial supplies unless otherwise specified, and used without further purification. M1, M3, and M4 were prepared according to procedures in the literature.14,23,24
A microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator™) was used to synthesize the polymers. UV-vis spectra were obtained with a Mecasys Optizen Pop spectrophotometer. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with chlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 °C on a Waters 1515 system, relative to polystyrene standards. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with an AutoLab analyzer. All CV measurements were carried out in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumtetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in acetonitrile with platinum as a counter electrode, a 3 mm glassy carbon electrode coated with a thin polymer film as a working electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode.

The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with a washing solvent sequence of methanol, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform. The extracted compound in chloroform was precipitated with methanol, then filtered and dried.

Fabrication of OPVs
For the OPVs fabrication, the glass-substrates with patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) were purchased from Samsung Corning Co, Ltd. The ITO patterned glass substrates had a resistivity of 10 ohm sq−1. The ITO patterned glass was cleaned with acetone, aqueous detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonication for 10 min. After drying in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h, the substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 30 min. The poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, VP AI 4083, Clevious) was spin-coated on clean ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s as a hole transport layer and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air, which formed ∼30 nm PEDOT:PSS-thickness. An active layer solution mixture of the polymer and PC71BM (Nano-C) in the chlorobenzene solvent with or without 1,8-diiodooctane (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.) was prepared, which was then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer in a N2 glove box. Finally, 20 nm calcium and 100 nm aluminum were thermally deposited at a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. Through the use of the shadow mask, the active area of Ca/Al with 4.64 mm2 was formed. To expand the value of the P2 random polymer in OPVs, we also applied it into the different OPV structure with the inverted device architecture having ITO/ZnO bottom and MoO3/Ag top electrodes under the same conditions used for the best P2 normal device. For the characteristics of OPVs, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 and AM 1.5G condition solar simulator under 100 mW cm−2. A reference Si solar cell certified by the International System of Units (SI) (SRC 1000 TC KG5 N, VLSI Standards, Inc) was used for accurate calibration and measurement. The hole and electron mobilities of the P1 and P2:PC71BM blended films were analyzed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au) and electron-only (ITO/Al/polymer:PC71BM/Al) devices. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by JSCLC = 9εεoμV2/(8L3), where J is the current density, εo is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 1014 F cm−1), ε is the relative dielectric constant of the material (3), μ is the mobility of the charge carriers, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
Results and discussion
Materials design and characterization
As shown in Fig. 1, initially we synthesized a new polymer using 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2,5-difluorobenzene) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PTBBT). This polymer was expected to have high crystalline properties due to strong S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent interactions. However, unfortunately, PTBBT with the long dodecyloxy alkyl chain is insoluble in all solvents even at high temperatures due to the strong π–π interaction caused by the S⋯F and S⋯O intrachain nonbonding interaction. To overcome the solubility problem, several approaches such as the incorporation of bulky alkyl chains or the breaking of symmetry have been explored.20 However, increasing the portion of the insulating bulky-side chain induces low electrical properties in the polymer.21 To increase the solubility of the polymer, we adopted random polymerization, which causes perturbation of the structures.22 We synthesized two polymers, P1 and P2, with benzodithiophene and thiophene as the bridge, respectively (Fig. 1), which are representative electron donating units. The synthesis of the polymers is outlined in Scheme 1. All of the monomers were prepared according to the literature.14,23,24 The P1 and P2 were synthesized using Stille cross-coupling condensation polymerization. The synthetic procedures are described in detail in the Experimental section. After polymerization, the polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, and chloroform, and then the chloroform fraction was recovered. These polymers are soluble in hot chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and chloroform. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDI, Mw/Mn) of the P1 and P2 were determined by carrying out GPC at 80 °C in chlorobenzene as an eluent. The Mn values of P1 and P2 are 67.8 and 21.3 kDa with a PDI of 1.5 and 1.17, respectively (Table 1). The Mn of P1 is higher than that of P2 due to steric hindrance caused by bulky substituents of benzodithiophene. Both polymers exhibit relatively good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (Td) above 320 °C under nitrogen, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, see Fig. S1†). The Td of both polymers was pretty much the same even though the Mn of P1 was more than three times higher than that of P2. The reason for this is probably due to the higher aggregated property of the P2 polymer with thiophene than that of P1 with bulky-substituted benzodithiophene.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of both polymers in chlorobenzene solution and spin-coated films on glass substrates are presented in Fig. 1. The optical properties of P1 and P2 are summarized in Table 1. These two polymers exhibited dual-band absorption with λmax around 350 and 600 nm, which can be attributed to localized π–π* transition, and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between electron-donating units and electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole units, respectively. The optical band-gaps (Eg) of P1 and P2 were determined from the onset of the absorption edges in the solid-state and found to be 1.83 and 1.81 eV, respectively. To investigate the electrochemical characteristics of both polymers and to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of both polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumtetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. To estimate the energy levels of both polymers from the vacuum energy level, we used the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as a calibration reference. The half-wave potential for oxidation of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple is 4.8 eV, below the vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were estimated to be −5.48 and −5.53 eV, respectively (Fig. S2†).
OPV performance
To directly investigate the effect of the newly synthesized random polymers on the photovoltaic properties, various OPVs were fabricated with a normal device-configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, as described in Fig. 2a. For the OPV optimization, a fine adjustment of the blend ratio, polymer concentration, and additive concentration was performed as presented in Fig. 2 and S3† plotted with 15 cells from 3 batches. Throughout the optimization experiment, the fixed polymer:PC71BM blended ratio was 1:2, and a polymer concentration of 15 mg mL−1 was adopted. Under the conditions, the P1 and P2-based OPVs showed average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2.34% and 6.73%, respectively. After adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) into the active solutions, extensively used for improving BHJ morphology,25,26 the solar cells showed more improved device properties. The J–V data of the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM-based devices with different additive concentrations are presented in Fig. 2b, and the average PCEs are listed in Fig. 2c. As depicted in Fig. 2b and c, for the two polymers, the OPVs with the 1% DIO additive showed the highest performance (average PCE: 5.77% for P1 and average PCE: 7.46% for P2).

The representative photovoltaic results for the optimized OPVs with P1 (∼170 nm), P2 (∼130 nm), P1 with DIO 1% (∼160 nm), and P2 with DIO 1% (∼120 nm) are summarized in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are listed in Table 2. Clearly, the OPVs based on the P2 random polymer with thiophene exhibit better cell performances than that of P1 with benzodithiophene. The Voc values of P1 and P2 are quite similar, probably due to the fact that there is no large difference in their HOMO levels,27 while the FF obtained in the P2-based OPV is ∼10% higher than that of the P1. In particular, the Jsc of P2 shows a ∼60% enhancement compared with that of P1. From the primary contribution of the Jsc and FF, the PCE of the P2-based OPV is enhanced by more than two times for P2 relative to P1; the PCE of the P2-based OPV reached 6.82% in comparison to the 2.44% for the P1-based device. These OPV-efficiencies were more improved after DIO addition; the P1 was dramatically improved from 2.44% to 5.95%, while the P2 showed relatively little enhancement from 6.82% to 7.71%, probably due to the difference in solubility between P1 and P2 in DIO.28 These observations and trends are in good agreement with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the P1 and P2-based OPVs obtained with identical conditions from the photovoltaic power-curves. As shown in Fig. 3b, the EQE is enhanced by 2.31 times for P2 relative to P1, 2.16 times for P1 with DIO relative to P1, and 1.12 times for P2 with DIO relative to P2. Additionally, as shown in Table 2, the Jsc values of the P1, P2, P1 with DIO, and P2 with DIO were 4.97 mA cm−2, 11.53 mA cm−2, 10.66 mA cm−2, and 13.37 mA cm−2, respectively; the Jsc values obtained with integration of the EQE data are quite close within 3% error, indicating that the observation and results shown in EQE are well matched with those shown in the J–V data, and that the photovoltaic measurements are reliable. In particular, considering that as shown in Fig. 3c, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is improved by 2.25 times for P2 relative to P1, 2.18 times for P1 with DIO relative to P1, and 1.06 times for P2 with DIO relative to P2, that is, the degree of EQE enhancement is nearly identical with that of the IQE enhancement, it was believed that the improved EQE and Jsc obtained in P2 devices and DIO-treated P1 and P2 OPVs could be attributed mainly to the enhanced charge collection efficiency induced by the use of the P2 or additive.29–31 This dramatic difference in P1 and P2-devices could be because P2 may have S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions in conjugated backbones to promote macromolecular planarity, which induces strong π–π stacking and high ordering properties, while P1 may experience steric hindrance from the collision between the bulky alkyl chain of BDT and the alkyl chain of BT, which decreases the planarity.14–16 More importantly, from the OPV-performance, it could be noted that excellent PCEs of ∼6% and ∼8% are achieved with the two newly synthesized, random polymers. These values are among the highest PCEs for random polymer-based OPVs.3,6,32 In particular, with no post-treatments such as thermal/solvent annealing and additives, P2 had one of the highest cell-efficiencies reported so far for normal OPVs.16,33,34

Surface morphology analysis of the blend films
To study the highly different photovoltaic properties in OPVs with P1 and P2 shown in Fig. 3, the nanoscale morphology and phase separation images of the polymer:PC71BM blend active films were also investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4a–h. The P1:PC71BM film showed macrophase separation and a relatively rough surface, while the P2 film showed a featureless morphology and a relatively smooth surface. This observation indicates that a random copolymer design with the third conjugated bridge modification could have a large influence on the miscibility of the polymer and fullerene, and that P2 with a thiophene bridge can provide better nanoscale morphology in BHJ films. In addition, considering that such macrophase separation can limit efficient exciton dissociation due to the decreased donor/acceptor interfacial areas, resulting in a worse Jsc and FF,3,16,35 this dramatic morphology difference could be responsible for the large variation in OPV-performances observed in the pristine P1 and P2 devices without the additive. On the other hand, the P1 blend film with DIO exhibited a dramatic morphological change with better bicontinuous nanoscale-morphology and interpenetrating network compared with that of the pristine P1. Also, the P2 blend film with DIO showed more enhanced phase separation with more distinct surface corrugation compared with that of the pristine P2. Similar trends for the two polymers with/without DIO are also observed in the phase AFM images. Considering that better miscibility, more distinct phase separation, and better interpenetrating networks between the polymer and the fullerene can improve the charge transport and collection to provide a better Jsc and FF,28,36,37 these favorable morphological changes could be responsible for the enhanced cell-performance shown in the P1 and P2-based OPV before/after DIO treatments.

Charge carrier mobilities in the blend films
For better observation, the hole and electron mobilities of the polymer:PC71BM films fabricated identically under the optimum conditions were also investigated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.36,38 As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were recorded as μh = 3.99 × 10−5 and 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 3.26 × 10−6 and 1.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1 and P2 blended films, respectively. Clearly, the P2 with the thiophene bridge had more excellent carrier mobility, with ∼1–2 orders higher μh and μe compared to that of P1. This could be due to the different degrees of planarity between P1 and P2.39 With DIO, the charge carrier mobilities were all improved; the P1 with DIO showed μh of 1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 1.15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and P2 with DIO showed μh of 3.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 6.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which could be due to the morphological differences and changes shown in AFM. These observations and trends are also highly consistent with those shown in the PCE and EQE data. From these observations compared with P1, the improved cell-efficiency through the larger Jsc and FF enhancement observed in P2-based OPVs might be explained by better nanoscale morphology with better phase separation and carrier mobility as shown in Fig. 4, providing more efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport/collection.

OPV with an inverted structure
To expand the value of the P2 random polymer in OPVs, we also applied it to a different OPV structure with an inverted device architecture under the same conditions used for the best P2 normal device. As shown in Fig. 6, the EQE of the corresponding device approached ∼80% in the range of ∼450–600 nm, and the inverted P2 device produced a Jsc of 13.90 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V, and a FF of 71.21%, thus resulting in a PCE of 8.50%, which is better than the PCE of ∼7.71% obtained in the best P2 normal device probably due to enhanced charge extraction and photon absorption in the inverted OPV.28 In particular, it should be noted that the PCE value of ∼8.50% is the highest PCE among BHJ-OPVs using random polymers to the best of our knowledge. These results show that the random copolymer design with conjugated bridge modification can be a highly desirable approach for high-performance LBG polymers and BHJ OPVs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed two random copolymers (P1 and P2) by introducing the concept of non-covalent conformational locks. Both polymers had enough solubility for the solution process despite strong non-covalent intramolecular interactions between sulfur and fluorine and/or oxygen. From the photovoltaic device evaluation, it was demonstrated that the P2 can improve the PCE by up to 6.82%, higher than the 2.44% by the P1 polymer, because the intramolecular non-covalent interactions of P2 can enhance macromolecular planarity, while P1 may experience steric hindrance due to collisions between the bulky alkyl chain of BDT and the alkyl chain of BT, decreasing its planarity. In addition, with the additive, the P1 and P2 devices showed more improved PCEs (up to 5.95% for P1 and 7.71% for P2) and different PCE-enhancement degrees, probably due to the different degree of planarity between P1 and P2 and different solubility in the additive. In particular, the P2 polymer in inverted-structure-based OPVs produced a PCE of 8.50%, which is the highest PCE among conventional OPVs using random polymers, thus suggesting that the newly synthesized P2 random polymer can be a highly viable and feasible donor-polymer for highly efficient OPV applications. The random copolymer approach demonstrated herein an example of a promising candidate as the donor for highly efficient OPVs. Currently, we have synthesized other random copolymers using benzodithiophene and/or thiophene as the donor and alkylbenzothiadiazole as the acceptor with a third moiety, and the relationship between the molecular structure and device performance is under investigation.
