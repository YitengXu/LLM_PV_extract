    , Accepted 27th October 2021First published on 30th October 2021AbstractSupramolecular aggregation of fluorophores will result in a variable absorption spectrum, which is beneficial for tuning the photophysical properties and improving their functionalities. Herein, ordered aggregates of liposoluble porphyrin molecules are obtained from 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP). The influences of the molecular structures, solvents and polymer surfactants have been investigated, and then tetrahydrofuran and pluronic F-127 are screened out to be the optimal candidates for forming ordered aggregates of TAPP. The as-prepared aggregates of TAPP (TAPP-O NPs) exhibit a red-shifted absorption spectrum of 50 nm, enhanced absorbance in the near infrared region and improved photothermal activity. Particularly, the good phototherapeutic effects of TAPP-O NPs highlight the potential of aggregated organic materials for biomedical applications.
Introduction
The structures and aggregation states determine the photophysical properties of fluorophores.1–3 The supramolecular architectures of fluorophores through non-covalent interactions have different states and their associated properties.4–8 The structural and spectroscopic studies on these supramolecular structures could contribute to understanding the intermolecular interactions and develop new functional materials.9–12 By now, many aggregates of dyes including porphyrins,13,14 cyanines,15,16 squaraine dyes,17 perylene bisimide dyes,18,19 boron dipyrromethene20,21 and aggregation-induced emission luminogens22 have been developed and applied to solar cells,23 bioimaging,24 cancer therapy13,16,25 and other fields.26,27
By virtue of the outstanding biocompatibility and photostability, porphyrins have been extensively applied in bioimaging and phototherapy of tumors.28–32 Nevertheless, the short absorption wavelength of porphyrins limits the tissue penetration depth of laser in phototherapy of tumors, and the low absorbance of Q bands increases the requirement of laser power.33 Recently, supramolecular assembly has been employed to properly regulate the absorption spectra of fluorophores.9,34 For example, Zheng et al. confirmed that lipid-conjugated chlorin derivatives could form organized aggregates in lipid bilayers, along with red-shifting the absorption to the near-infrared region.35 Inspired by this, red-shifted porphyrin aggregates obtained through simpler steps should be more practical for phototherapy of tumors.
In this work, porphyrin nanoparticles (NPs) in ordered aggregation states (TAPP-O NPs) were prepared from 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) via a nanoprecipitation method after screening porphyrin molecules (I–VI) (Scheme 1). TAPP-O NPs exhibit a red-shifted absorption spectrum and increased absorbance in the near-infrared region, which is attributed to the extended π–π stacked system.29 Moreover, the TAPP-O NPs exhibit better photothermal effects compared with the disordered porphyrin NPs, which could be employed for highly efficient cancer phototherapy.

Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of porphyrin NPs
In order to study the assembly of porphyrins, 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and its derivatives were synthesized via reported methods.36–40 A series of porphyrin NPs were prepared by the co-assembly with triblock copolymer pluronic F-127 (F-127), aiming to improve the dispersibility of porphyrins in water. Then the absorption spectra of porphyrins in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and their NPs in water were recorded (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the absorption spectra of the porphyrins I–V NPs change insignificantly relative to free molecules (Fig. 1a–e), but the Q band absorption peaks of TAPP (porphyrin VI) NPs generate the most obvious bathochromic shift compared to the free TAPP molecules (from 660 to 710 nm, Fig. 1f). Moreover, TAPP NPs in water possess enhanced absorbance in the Q bands compared to TAPP in THF, as shown in the absorption spectra of TAPP and TAPP NPs at the same concentration (Fig. S1, ESI†). Visually, porphyrins I–V NPs exhibit orange or red color, while TAPP NPs are in green color, which is in accordance with their absorption spectra. Then, copper(II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4′-tetraphenylamino) porphyrin (TAPP-Cu) was synthesized and TAPP-Cu NPs were prepared via the same method as that of TAPP NPs. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the absorption spectrum of the TAPP-Cu NPs changes insignificantly compared with that of TAPP-Cu in THF, probably because the coordination with copper(II) hampers the intermolecular interactions. The results mentioned above suggest that the red-shifted absorption and enhanced absorbance might originate from the interaction between the NH2 part and freebase porphyrin segment, as well as the intermolecular arrangement formed thereby.

To study the influence of organic solvents on the aggregation behavior of TAPP, various organic solvents (THF, 1,4-dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone and N-methyl pyrrolidone) were selected to prepare TAPP NPs. Strikingly, except for THF and 1,4-dioxane, negligible bathochromic shifts in the absorption spectra were observed for the TAPP NPs prepared with other organic solvents (Fig. 2a and Fig. S3, ESI†). And TAPP NPs prepared with THF exhibit stronger absorbance in the Q band compared with those prepared with 1,4-dioxane. To investigate if other surfactants could replace F-127, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-2000 (DSPE-PEG) and poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) were selected to prepare TAPP NPs on the premise of using THF. As displayed in Fig. 2b, the Q band absorption spectrum of TAPP NPs prepared by F-127 exhibits a more obvious red shift and increased absorbance compared with those prepared using DSPE-PEG and PEG-PCL. Moreover, TAPP NPs prepared using F-127, PEG-PCL and DSPE-PEG exhibit green, yellow green and saffron yellow color, respectively (Fig. 2c). The results mentioned above indicate that THF and F-127 are the optimal candidates for the formation of ordered aggregates of TAPP.

(b) The normalized absorption spectra and (c) photograph of TAPP in THF, TAPP NPs prepared with F-127, PEG-PCL and DSPE-PEG, respectively. (d) Absorption spectra of TAPP in a mixed solvent of THF and H2O (1:9) for different times. (e) The absorption spectra and (f) photograph of TAPP in a mixed solvent of THF and H2O with different fw values (10, 50, 70 and 90 vol%). 
Then, the changes in the absorption spectra of TAPP over time were monitored when THF solution of TAPP and F-127 was added into water. As demonstrated in Fig. 2d, the absorption peak of TAPP at 430 nm decreases, and the Q band absorption red shifts along with the increase of absorbance. After 8 h, the absorption spectra of TAPP remained basically unchanged, manifesting the formation of stable aggregates. Next, the spectral changes of TAPP in THF (with F-127 as the surfactant) upon the addition of different fractions of water (fw) were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2e, the absorbance of the Soret bands fades with the increase of fw, and the peak at 660 nm red shifts to 710 nm. Simultaneously, colors of the mixed solutions change from red to green with the increase of fw (Fig. 2f).
Characterization of TAPP NPs
To compare the properties of TAPP NPs in ordered and disordered aggregation states, TAPP NPs prepared by using THF and DMSO are named TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs, respectively, and selected as the representatives. First, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements show that the diameters of TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs are 200 ± 2 and 78 ± 1 nm, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrate that the TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs are in regular spherical shapes (Fig. S5, ESI†), and their sizes are consistent with the DLS results. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the exciton lifetimes were conducted. As exhibited in the fluorescence decay curves of TAPP, TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the exciton lifetimes of TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs are 2.10 and 0.92 ns respectively by calculation, which is below that of TAPP (6.76 ns). The difference in exciton lifetimes of TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs could be attributed to the size effect to some extent.41,42 Powder X-ray diffraction results (Fig. S7, ESI†) suggest that TAPP-O NPs possess higher crystallinity than TAPP-D NPs, that is, TAPP-O NPs are in more ordered molecular arrangements. Furthermore, the size changes of TAPP-O NPs over time were monitored. As illustrated in Fig. S8 (ESI†), whether in water or in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with 10% fetal bovine serum, both the diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) of TAPP-O NPs change negligibly, which indicates the good stability of TAPP-O NPs. To clarify the intermolecular interactions during the formation of TAPP-O NPs, urea, NaCl and Triton X-100 were employed to destroy the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively.43–45 The size of TAPP-O NPs treated with Triton X-100 was decreased from 200 to about 7 nm (Fig. 3a), demonstrating that TAPP-O NPs were destructed. However, there were no apparent changes in the sizes of TAPP-O NPs in the presence of urea or NaCl. Besides, the absorption spectra of TAPP-O NPs treated with urea or NaCl also changed insignificantly, while the Q band absorption of TAPP-O NPs treated with Triton X-100 blue shifted along with the decrease of absorbance (Fig. S9, ESI†). These results suggest that the hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role in the formation of TAPP-O NPs.

Photodynamic and photothermal activity
The photodynamic effect of TAPP NPs was evaluated by utilizing 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a trapping agent to detect the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The absorbance of DPBF after the addition of TAPP-O NPs or TAPP-D NPs shows large decreases when irradiated by 685 nm laser for 180 s (Fig. S10, ESI†). The absorbance changes of DPBF at 420 nm are shown in Fig. 3b, which indicates that TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-D NPs exhibit similar capacity of ROS generation upon irradiation.
Subsequently, the photothermal properties of TAPP NPs were investigated. First, the temperature variations of TAPP-O NPs for a series of concentrations and laser power densities were monitored during the laser irradiation. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the temperature increase (ΔT) of TAPP-O NPs (50 μg mL−1) with irradiation by 685 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2, 10 min) could reach 29 °C, while there is a negligible temperature variation in water under the same irradiation conditions. Fig. 3d shows that the temperature changes of TAPP-O NPs are also dependent on laser power densities. According to previous methods,46,47 the photothermal conversion efficiency of TAPP-O NPs was measured to be 30.4% (Fig. S11, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3e, TAPP-O NPs could achieve a higher temperature increase compared with TAPP-D NPs under the same conditions. Compared with TAPP-D NPs, the increased photothermal activity of TAPP-O NPs is ascribed to the red-shifted and enhanced absorption of TAPP. After 6 cycles of irradiation and cooling, there was a negligible change in the maximum temperature of TAPP-O NPs (Fig. 3f), demonstrating the excellent photothermal stability.
Cytotoxicity of TAPP-O NPs
To achieve optimal therapeutic effects, TAPP-O NPs were employed for the following experiments. First, the ROS generation in living cells was detected by using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as an indicator. Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells treated with PBS/TAPP-O NPs and without/with laser irradiation were named PBS, PBS + L, TAPP-O NPs and TAPP-O NPs + L, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 4a, HeLa cells in the TAPP-O NPs + L group exhibit bright green fluorescence, which certifies the intracellular ROS generation. However, the treatment with laser irradiation or TAPP-O NPs alone could not induce the generation of ROS. Subsequently, the cytotoxicity test of TAPP-O NPs was performed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Strikingly, TAPP-O NPs at an extremely low concentration of 1.0 μg mL−1 under irradiation (0.2 W cm−2) could effectively inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells (Fig. 4b). Live/dead cell staining results further demonstrated the cytotoxicity caused by TAPP-O NPs under irradiation (Fig. 4c). Besides, the Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay was used to quantitatively determine cell death induced by the phototherapeutic effect. As demonstrated in Fig. 4d, laser irradiation or TAPP-O NPs alone does not cause obvious cell apoptosis, while intense fluorescence signals induced by the late apoptosis are detected in HeLa cells in the presence of both TAPP-O NPs and laser exposure.

Antitumor treatment in vivo
We evaluated the in vivo tumor treatment effects of TAPP-O NPs. All animal experiments have been approved (approval No. 202168) by the Academic Committee of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and carried out according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publication No. 85-23 Rev. 1985). To obtain the optimal illumination time, ex vivo fluorescence imaging of tumors was conducted. U14 tumor-burdened Kunming mice were treated with TAPP-O NPs via intravenous injection at different times, then the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were collected. Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows that after 12 h of injection, the tumor exhibits the strongest fluorescence signal. Therefore, 12 h after intravenous injection was selected as the irradiation time for subsequent phototherapy.
Then, the in vivo therapeutic effects of TAPP-O NPs were explored. The schematic diagram of photodynamic and photothermal therapy (PDT and PTT) of tumors is illustrated in Fig. 5a. U14 tumor-burdened Kunming mice were randomly divided into 6 groups with various treatments: PBS, PBS + 0.8 W cm−2, 1.6 mg kg−1, 0.4 mg kg−1 + 0.2 W cm−2, 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.2 W cm−2 and 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.8 W cm−2, in which 0.4 and 1.6 mg kg−1 refer to the injected dose of TAPP-O NPs, while 0.2 and 0.8 W cm−2 are the laser power densities used. 0.4 mg kg−1 and 0.2 W cm−2 were employed to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of TAPP-O NPs at a low injected dose and/or laser power density. The tumor sites were irradiated by a 685 nm laser (0.2 or 0.8 W cm−2) for 10 min after 12 h of intravenous injection with TAPP-O NPs or PBS. In the meantime, the infrared thermal images of tumor sites at different time points were recorded. The temperature of tumor sites of the mice in 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.8 W cm−2 group could increase to 47.7 °C, while the temperature variations in other groups were slight (Fig. 5b and S13, ESI†). After that, the tumor sizes of each group were measured every two days. As displayed in Fig. 5c, the tumor sizes of the mice treated with PBS in the absence or presence of laser irradiation increase quickly, suggesting that laser irradiation alone has no inhibition effect on tumor growth. The tumor growth curve of the mice treated with TAPP-O NPs (1.6 mg kg−1) without irradiation is similar to that in the PBS group. Besides, the treatments with TAPP-O NPs and laser irradiation at a lower dose (0.4 mg kg−1 + 0.2 W cm−2) could partly inhibit the tumor growth. Compared with the 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.2 W cm−2 group, the 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.8 W cm−2 group exhibits better antitumor effect owing to the combination of photodynamic and photothermal effects. After 14 days of treatment, the mice in each group were sacrificed, and the major organs and tumors were collected. The tumor sizes in the photograph (Fig. 5d) and the tumor weights (Fig. 5e) of the mice were in line with the tumor growth curves in Fig. 5c. The hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining of tumor slices shows significant cell death in the groups of 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.2 W cm−2 and 1.6 mg kg−1 + 0.8 W cm−2 (Fig. S14, ESI†), further identifying the excellent antitumor effects of TAPP-O NPs upon laser irradiation.

(f) Body weights of mice after different treatments for 14 days (n = 4). 
The body weights of the mice slowly increased during the treatments (Fig. 5f), indicating that there were no obvious side effects of various formulations. Moreover, there were no evident organ damages (Fig. S15, ESI†) or abnormalities in the observed blood biochemical levels (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†), which suggested the biosafety of different treatments. Overall, TAPP-O NPs could inhibit the tumor growth by efficient PTT and PDT without causing significant side effects.
Conclusions
In summary, a phototherapeutic nanoplatform from ordered porphyrin aggregates (TAPP-O NPs) was developed via a nanoprecipitation method. During the process of assembly, the organic solvent (THF) and surfactant (F-127) together facilitate the ordered arrangement of TAPP molecules. Compared with TAPP-D NPs, TAPP-O NPs exhibit not only red-shifted absorption, but also enhanced absorbance and PTT effects. Above all, TAPP-O NPs could effectively inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer. Therefore, this simple but practical nanoplatform could provide guidance for developing ordered aggregates of organic dyes for more effective cancer therapy. This work also will spur the development of more functional aggregates in the near future.
