A rechargeable battery based on aluminium chemistry is envisioned to be a low cost energy storage platform, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries. Additionally, the challenges that impede progress in achieving a practical aluminium-ion battery are also discussed.Shyamal K. DasShyamal K. Das received his M.Sc.

1. Introduction
Sustainable production and efficient use of electrical energy is the central focus in mitigating the pressing global challenges, like access to energy for all, environmental degradation and climate change. It is estimated that over 1.5 billion people worldwide are completely deprived of electricity and more than a billion rely on an intermittent supply of grid electricity.1 The households that do not have access to electricity are primarily concentrated in remote inaccessible geographical locations, where extending the grid is technically and/or economically not feasible. Centralized grid-based electricity supplies are the most common approach for electrification throughout the world. However, decentralized off-grid supplies are emerging as a technically viable proposition and also cost-effective option for grid-deprived geographical locations. Therefore, harnessing electrical energy from perennial renewable and clean sources at a distribution scale has become a naturally occurring option in recent times. However, the intermittent and diffuse nature of renewable sources strictly necessitates the storage of the generated electricity for its effective and reliable on-demand utilization, which is considered to be a major challenge both in terms of the cost and lifetime of the systems.2,3 Among the large number of existing energy storage technologies, rechargeable electrochemical energy storage and generation devices occupy a suitably prominent position because of their high energy conversion efficiency, outstanding performance, compactness, reliability and on-demand responses.2–4
The foremost notable example of rechargeable electrochemical devices is lead-acid batteries – a technology that is up to 155 years old, but still indispensable in a variety of applications ranging from transportation to telecommunication.2–6 Rechargeable Li-ion batteries, which outperform lead-acid batteries in several aspects, such as energy density, cycle life and maintenance, have been immensely successful in bringing a paradigm shift in the electrochemical energy storage platform.4,7–10 These batteries, which have undergone 25 years of spectacular commercial penetration, are commendably rendering services in portable electronic gadgets and, significantly, in transportation and stationary energy storage applications. Despite being the frontrunner in the range of rechargeable batteries, the future of all kinds of Li-based batteries is critically debatable.11 The excessive consumption of Li- and Co-based minerals due to the ever increasing demand for Li batteries dictated by the life-style of modern society, coupled with the dwindling and geopolitically restricted abundance of these minerals, at some point in the future will become critical in sustaining cost-effective Li-ion batteries.11–13 Considering the possibility of this upcoming shortfall, there are global discussions and unprecedented searches in both academia and industry for alternative and sustainable battery chemistries based on materials with a greater earth-abundance than lithium. In view of this, possible strategies to develop new state-of-the-art sustainable storage technologies hinge on the exploration of Na-, Mg-, Zn-, Ca-, K-, and Al-based battery chemistries.11–39Fig. 1 compares the various properties of these metals.

As an alternative, the first appealing approach appears to be establishing Na-ion battery technology analogous to Li-ion batteries. Interestingly, active research on Na-ion batteries was initiated in the early 1980s, though the majority of breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decade or so.13,40–45 For instance, a recent study evidenced the reversible insertion–deinsertion of Na+ ions in graphite, which has so far been thought to be impossible.44 Similarly, NaFeO2 and P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 cathode materials have also been shown to host Na+ ions, leading to high storage capacities.45 The fundamental similarities in the electrochemistry and physicochemical properties of Na and Li have largely catapulted the development of Na-ion batteries, which is apparently now transcending from the laboratory stage to commercially viable production with the successful demonstration of the first prototype Na-ion battery with an energy density of 90 W h kg−1 by French RS2E scientists in 2015.46 Concurrently, certain electropositive metals have also been considered as an anode for rechargeable metal-batteries.22,27,30,33,36 The direct use of metallic anodes could exceptionally enhance the energy density of the batteries, owing to their outstanding gravimetric and volumetric discharge capacities (Fig. 1c and d). The first example of a metal-battery was a Li-battery designed by Exxon Laboratory in 1972, where metallic Li was coupled to a TiS2 cathode.47 However, very soon it was realized that Li showed the disadvantage of favoring dendrite growth in usual liquid organic solvents during repeated discharge–charge cycles, which makes Li-batteries vulnerable to thermal runaway and explosion hazards.7 This serious safety concern led to the shunning of Li-batteries as a rechargeable power device from consumer products. Hence, only those metals less prone to depositing dendrites have attracted attention. Mg has been of notable importance since the ground-breaking demonstration of a proof of concept rechargeable Mg-battery by Aurbach et al. in 2000.22 Although significant critical technical advancements were achieved over time, it appears that progress in magnesium electrochemistry is stagnating due to the narrow electrochemical window of the available electrolytes, interface instability and the utterly limited choice of Mg2+ ion insertion cathode materials.19,48,49 These considerations have adversely impacted the commercial realization of Mg-batteries. Despite the same challenges being faced, the interest in rechargeable metal-batteries is still growing rapidly with the latest demonstrations of the promising electrochemical activities of metals like K, Zn and Ca.27–35
Similarly, the argument for rechargeable aluminium-batteries is as straightforward as that for other low cost metal-based batteries, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal and the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (Fig. 1a). Further impetus comes from the available fundamental knowledge on the electrochemistry of aluminium. Since the pioneering work by Hulot in 1855, the immense potential of aluminium has not gone unnoticed in the domain of battery electrochemistry.50 There are several examples of primary Al-batteries, such as Al–MnO2, Al–H2O2, Al–S, Al–Ni, Al–KMnO4 and Al–air batteries, though their use is somewhat restricted due to their failure to recharge.51–60 There are basically three additional principal factors that motivate the renewed interest towards aluminium-batteries. First, the inertness of the material and the ease of handling in an ambient environment is expected to offer significant safety improvements for this kind of battery. Second, aluminium can exchange three redox electrons per cation. This means that insertion of one Al3+ ion is equivalent to three Li+ ions in conventional intercalation cathodes. Therefore, since the ionic radii of Al3+ (0.54 Å) and Li+ (0.76 Å) are similar, significantly higher moles of electrons and Al3+ ions can be accepted by the cathodes without much pulverization. Third, aluminium possesses a higher volumetric capacity than Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca and Zn owing to its high density (2.7 g cm−3 at 25 °C) and ability to exchange three electrons (Fig. 1c). This again means that the energy stored in aluminium-batteries on a per volume basis is higher than that in other metal-based batteries. Hence, aluminium-batteries are expected to be smaller in size. The gravimetric capacity of Al is also higher than that of Na, K, Mg, Ca and Zn (Fig. 1d). Despite the higher redox potential of Al (−1.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) compared to other metals (Fig. 1f), the higher volumetric and gravimetric capacities will unarguably impart energy densities close to or higher than the energy densities of other metal-batteries. Moreover, aluminium-batteries could deliver energy at a much more economically feasible rate (i.e. cost per kW h) due to the reduced cost of aluminium (Fig. 1b).61 Therefore, the market penetration of this technology is expected to be easier. The development of an efficient aluminium-battery is hence essential to harness its enormous potential. The European Commission already launched an ambitious project entitled “ALION” to develop aluminium-batteries for energy storage applications in decentralized electricity generation systems in 2015 (ref. 62).
It is noted here that the scientific community in recent times has rechristened rechargeable aluminium-batteries as “aluminium-ion batteries”, breaking the traditional nomenclature of metal-batteries and metal-ion batteries.7Fig. 1g represents a schematic configuration of a typical aluminium-ion battery, which is primarily composed of pristine aluminium metal as the anode, a cathode and an aprotic or protic electrolyte. This review exclusively aims at illustrating the historical and contemporary developments regarding non-aqueous aluminium-ion batteries (AIBs) and also highlights the associated challenges impeding progress towards the commercialization of AIBs in the near future.
2. Historical highlights of developments in non-aqueous aluminium-ion batteries
The concept of AIBs dates back to the early 1970s, although the exact origin is uncertain.63 Research articles on AIBs emerged sporadically from research groups of different origins until the late 1990s. Surprisingly, the momentum of global research activities on AIBs over time has noticeably reduced. Based on our understanding from published reports, the following reasons could be proposed for the slow progress in this area. First, there were formidable obstacles in finding appropriate Al3+ ion conducting electrolytes that are operational at ambient temperature (25 °C). Researchers experienced repeated failures in reversibly electroplating and electrostripping Al in conventional non-aqueous electrolytes usually employed in Li/Na-ion batteries. Second, the library of suitable cathode materials was very sparse. Third, the poor stability of all the investigated Al-ion cells over time discouraged research efforts. Fourth, the packaging of Al-ion cells was a major problem because of the corrosive electrolytes used. Finally, and most importantly, the greater promises and phenomenal success of Li-ion batteries completely spearheaded global efforts in Li-based batteries, setting aside the progress of AIBs at a very premature stage. The following sections present historical accounts of various scientific activities undertaken in developing AIBs during the period of 1970–1990.
Holleck and Giner of Tycho Laboratories, Massachusetts possibly made the first attempt to configure an AIB based on the reduction of Cl2 in a vitreous carbon electrode in 1972.63,64 Vitreous carbon was chosen over graphite because of the swelling and disintegration of graphite electrodes in molten salt. This study utilized a ternary eutectic of AlCl3–KCl–NaCl as the non-aqueous molten salt electrolyte. This type of chloroaluminate electrolyte is classified into three categories, viz. acidic, neutral and basic, depending primarily on the molar concentration of AlCl3 in the electrolyte.65 When the molar concentration of AlCl3 is lower than 50%, the electrolyte possesses basic characteristics and contains AlCl4− and Cl− as primary anions. On the contrary, excessive AlCl3 (>50 mol%) results in acidic electrolyte with AlCl4− and Al2Cl7− anions. It turned out that only an acidic composition facilitates electroplating and electrostripping of Al according to the following reversible reaction.4Al2Cl7− + 3e− ⇔ Al + 7AlCl4−
The operating temperatures of the Al–Cl2 cells were in the range of 90–150 °C. The cell delivers a theoretical energy density of 1431 W h kg−1. It was noticed that the presence of an optimized amount of LiCl in the acidic electrolyte could reduce the operating temperature to as low as 61 °C. The melting temperatures of these electrolytes were found to be a strong function of composition. For example, 66–14–20 mol%, 63.5–16.5–20 mol%, and 62.13–12.7–25.17 mol% of AlCl3–KCl–NaCl showed melting temperatures of 70 °C, 89 °C and 94 °C, respectively. The charge–discharge characteristics of the investigated Al–Cl2 cells were found to be independent of electrolyte composition and temperature. Considering carbon as electrochemically inactive in the electrolytes, it was proposed that Cl2 was reduced and adsorbed at the carbon–electrolyte interface. The electrochemical reactions are listed in Table 1 (sl. no. 1).

In the meantime, attempts were also made to substitute toxic Cl2 as the cathode. Koura of Tokyo University of Science was successful in this pursuit in 1980.66,67 It was brilliantly demonstrated that FeS2 could be used as an alternative to Cl2 (Fig. 2a). From the AlCl3–NaCl phase diagram, a binary composition of 54.5 mol% AlCl3 and 45.5 mol% NaCl (or NaAlCl4) with a melting temperature of 107.2 °C was chosen as an electrolyte. The Al–FeS2 cells, which were investigated at temperatures in the range of 150–300 °C, exhibited remarkable features including an extraordinary life-span of over 300 cycles and coulombic efficiencies of nearly 100%.67 The discharge curves showed two potential plateaus, i.e. a high plateau at 1–1.2 V and a low plateau at about 0.6 V. The charge potential plateau was at about 1.5 V.66 It also turned out that electrolyte additives (e.g. chloride-based compounds) and electrode additives (e.g. CoS, CuS, graphite) significantly influence the performance of Al–FeS2 cells.66 For example, the discharge capacities improved by 120% and 25% respectively due to the addition of SnCl2 (1 mol%) into the electrolyte and graphite (30 wt%) into the FeS2 electrode. Post mortem X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of FeS, Fe and Al2S3 as discharge products (Table 1, sl. no. 2). The same research group also identified FeS as a cathode.67 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of Al–FeS cells in an electrolyte consisting of AlCl3 (48 mol%) and NaCl (52 mol%) dissolved in Al2S3 (0.04 M) showed sharp oxidation and reduction peaks at 1.3 V and 1.6 V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2b. Interestingly, negligible electrochemical activity of FeS was observed in the absence of Al2S3. The electrochemical processes involved reversible diffusion of AlSCl2− ions (Table 1, sl. no. 3). On the other hand, Weaving and Orchard proposed a combination of certain types of metals and their conjugated chlorides as cathodes, such as Ni/NiCl2, Fe/FeCl2, Mn/MnCl2 and V/VCl2.68 The discharge–charge profiles obtained with NaCl saturated NaAlCl4 electrolyte at 250 °C were found to be exceptionally flat with polarization as low as 100 mV. However, the instability of the metal chlorides in NaAlCl4 and the spontaneous electroless growth of Al dendrites shortened the life-span of the cells.69 The dendrite growth could be arrested at low current densities upon addition of MnCl2 into NaAlCl4.69 Grjotheim et al. also showed that tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) in AlCl3–NaCl–KCl inhibits dendrite growth.70

The high operating temperature of the discussed secondary Al-ion cells was a major concern. In a bid to reduce the temperature, Takami and Koura modified the NaAlCl4 electrolyte by infusing 1-butylpyridinium chloride (BPC) ionic liquid.71 Notably, the Al–FeS2 cells showed the ability to recharge at a temperature as low as 40 °C with an optimized concentration of the electrolyte. However, the energy efficiency was unacceptably low (∼50–80% in contrast to the values of 90–100% for cells operated at 90 °C and above). The electrolyte composition played a significant role in the performance of the cells. For example, the capacities could be improved in basic electrolytes (<50 mol% AlCl3) and by replacing NaCl with LiCl. In a similar effort, Hjuler et al. demonstrated a rechargeable Al–Ni3S2 cell with a relatively large number of stable cycles (∼200) at 100 °C utilizing an electrolyte of alkali tetrahaloaluminate salts (LiAlCl4–NaAlCl4–NaAlBr4–KAlCl4 at 3:2:3:2 weight ratio) with a melting point of 86 °C.72 The electrolyte decomposes at 2 V and the cell potential was 0.83–1.00 V. It was proposed that Ni3S2 reduces to Ni during the discharge process (Table 1, sl. no. 4). Berrettoni et al. also evidenced similar reduction of NiS2 in NaCl saturated NaAlCl4 electrolyte at 175 °C (Table 1, sl. no. 5).73
It was clearly realized that the inaccessibility of appropriate Al3+ ion conducting electrolytes was hindering the feasibility of ambient temperature AIBs. In a quest to overcome this formidable challenge, a group of scientists from Frank J. Seiler Research Laboratories, USA and AT&T Bell Laboratories, USA in the early 1980s designed certain chloroaluminate salts utilizing ionic liquids, which are primarily liquid at ambient temperature.74,75 The salts were derived via physical mixing of AlCl3 and 1-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium chloride (MEICl) ionic liquid. Interestingly, both AlCl3 and MEICl are solid at ambient temperature. However, AlCl3–MEICl (2:1 mol ratio) is liquid down to −98 °C.76 The physicochemical properties of AlCl3–MEICl are quite intriguingly similar to the AlCl3–NaCl system discussed earlier.65,76,77 If the molar ratio of AlCl3/MEICl is greater than 1, the mixture of AlCl3–MEICl is acidic. In the case of basic and neutral mixtures, these ratios are respectively lower and equal to 1. The phase diagram of the available anions with AlCl3 concentration is depicted in Fig. 2c. The anions in acidic AlCl3–MEICl are AlCl4− and Al2Cl7−. It was clearly noted that Al could be reversibly electroplated in an acidic composition of AlCl3–MEIC at ambient temperature with efficiencies as high as 99%.77,78 The main responsible anion for reversible Al plating and stripping is Al2Cl7− and the electrochemical reaction occurs via 4Al2Cl7− + 3e− ⇔ Al + 7AlCl4−. In basic AlCl3–MEIC, AlCl4− is not reducible within the stable electrochemical window owing to irreversible reduction of imidazole cations.77,78 Acidic AlCl3–MEIC shows stability in the voltage range of 0–2.5 V against Al.79 The specific conductivities of AlCl3–MEIC with respect to composition and temperature are well documented by Jiang et al.77 Both acidic and basic AlCl3–MEIC were separately used in Al–Al concentration cells as electrolytes (Fig. 2d).74 The configuration of the cell was Al|AlCl3 (37 mol%)–MEIC|polypropylene separator|AlCl3 (60 mol%)–MEIC|Al. Discharge occurred at a voltage of 1–1.3 V. The compositional analysis of the electrodes and electrolytes evidenced three electron reduction and oxidation of Al (Table 1, sl. no. 6). Reynolds and Dymek reported secondary Al–Zn and Al–Cd cells following a similar concept to that of the Al–Al concentration cell.80 These two electrochemical cells were apparently the first demonstration of ambient temperature secondary Al-ion cells. The open circuit potentials of the Al–Zn and Al–Cd cells were 0.7 V and 1 V, and the cells possessed coulombic efficiencies of 87% and 67%, respectively. The cells showed a limited amount (∼20 cycles) of rechargeability. The reversible oxidation and reduction reactions for the Al–Zn and Al–Cd cells are described in Table 1 (sl. no. 7 and 8).
Gifford and Palmisano, in a remarkable way, demonstrated the possibility of graphite as a cathode in combination with an acidic electrolyte composed of AlCl3 and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium chloride (DMPrICl).81 The Al–graphite cells continued to function for 195 cycles at ambient temperature. The discharge plateau appeared at 1.7 V (Fig. 2e). It was proposed that Cl2 produced from Al2Cl7− by the reaction 2Al2Cl7− ⇔ 2Al + 2AlCl4− + 3Cl2 reversibly intercalates into graphite (Table 1, sl. no. 9). The cell capacities were in the range of 35–40 mA h g−1, which is lower than the value for a completely intercalated graphite–chlorine compound with composition C8Cl (279 mA h g−1). The disintegration of the graphite electrode led to the untimely failure of Al–graphite cells. Evidence of graphite intercalation compounds with halogens in AlCl3–LiCl (3:2 wt%) electrolyte at 140 °C was earlier provided by Fouletier and Armand.82 The AlCl4− anions could electrochemically intercalate into graphite. Depending on the type of graphite (e.g. artificial graphite, pyrographite, Ceylon graphite), sharp intercalation and deintercalation peaks respectively emerged in the voltage range of 1.6–1.7 V and 1.7–1.9 V.82 Mohandas et al. also confirmed the intercalation of AlCl4− into graphite during the charge–discharge processes of an Al–graphite cell with NaCl saturated NaAlCl4 electrolyte at 175 °C.83 Donahue et al. considered FeCl3 (infused in reticulated vitreous carbon) as a cathode and investigated Al–FeCl3 cells with an acidic AlCl3–MEIC electrolyte at ambient temperature.84 The charge–discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 2f. The discharge potential is relatively high (1.4–1.7 V). These cells also suffered from poor life-span and self-discharge due to the dissolution of FeCl3 in the electrolyte. The proposed electrochemical reactions are described in Table 1 (sl. no. 10). Conductive polymers also emerged as cathodes in secondary Al-cells.85 The CV curves of an Al–polyaniline cell showed a pair of prominent redox peaks in the voltage range of 0.5–1.8 V in acidic AlCl3–MEIC electrolyte, which was excellently corroborated by the charge–discharge profiles. The cell showed a discharge capacity of 420 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of more than 90%. However, the progressive dissolution of polyaniline in the electrolyte limits the cell life to 20–30 cycles.86
The search for appropriate ambient temperature Al3+ ion conducting electrolytes for secondary Al-cells is complex. First, aqueous electrolytes are eliminated because of their electrochemical instability resulting from parasitic H2 evolution during charging.87,88 Second, conventional non-aqueous organic solvents, commonly employed in Li/Na-batteries, exhibit sluggish or negligible reversible Al electroplating and electrostripping.89,90 Therefore, the majority of research has primarily been focused on chloroaluminate-based electrolytes, where electrochemical activity of Al has been appreciably identified. Although AlCl3–MEIC and AlCl3–BPC electrolytes were employed successfully in secondary Al-cells, the exothermic reaction of MEIC/BPC and AlCl3 was a serious concern.91 The rise in temperature is sufficient for electrolyte decomposition. Hence, precautionary measures are essential to control the reaction rate while preparing AlCl3–MEIC/BPC electrolytes. As proposed by Zhao and VanderNoot, this problem could be overcome by utilizing trimethylphenylammonium chloride (TMPAC) ionic liquid instead of MEIC and BPC, without affecting the electrochemical window.92 In another study, Papageorgiou and Emmenegger revealed that co-solvents (e.g. 1,2-dichlorobenzene, anisole, diphenyl ether) in AlCl3–TMPAC alter the viscosity and ionic conductivity, thus improving the deposition efficiency of Al.93 Besides this, MEIC/BPC could also be replaced by 1,4-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolium chloride (DMTC).86 On the other hand, Legrand et al. proposed that the electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al in AlCl3–LiCl–dialkylsulfone (DXSO2, X = methyl, ethyl or propyl group) electrolytes gives higher plating efficiencies (>90%) in the temperature range of 80–160 °C.94,95 Interestingly, dipropylsulfone could be used at temperature as low as 40 °C. It shows a conductivity of ∼2.5 mS cm−1 at 40 °C. It was found via27Al NMR and AC impedance spectroscopic analysis that solvated Al(DXSO2)33+ cations (formation reaction: 4AlCl3 + 3DXSO2 ⇔ Al(DXSO2)33+ + 3AlCl4−) are responsible for Al electrodeposition in these sulfone-based electrolytes, in contrast to the Al2Cl7− anions in chloroaluminates. The use of DXSO2, however, causes detrimental sulfur contamination in the Al electrodeposits.
3. Contemporary research status of aluminium-ion batteries
This section discusses the latest scientific disseminations in AIBs. After a substantial period of interruption until 2010, there was a sudden resurgence of interest in developing and understanding the mechanism of ambient temperature AIBs.36,96 The effect can be conspicuously measured in terms of the large number of emerging publications and patents.37,38,97–113 However, systematic and detailed studies exclusively on cathode materials and electrolytes are lacking, which makes it difficult to discuss them separately, and, hence, instances of overlap are ineluctable in the following discussion. Table 2 summarizes the performance of certain AIBs assembled with various combinations of cathodes and electrolytes that are currently under research.

3.1. Identification of materials for cathodes
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA reported a high energy density rechargeable AIB in the year 2010 and also filed a patent in the following year.96,97 Proposing a possible rocking-chair mechanism similar to the concept of lithium-ion batteries, this group claimed that the spinel phase of λ-Mn2O4 as a cathode possesses the ability to reversibly host Al3+ ions in acidic AlCl3–MEICl (2:1 mol ratio) electrolyte.96,97,114 Although elaborate experimental evidence is unavailable, the work concluded that λ-Mn2O4 transforms into AlMn2O4 during Al3+ ion intercalation (Table 1, sl. no. 11). The estimated theoretical capacity and potential of the proposed Al–Mn2O4 cell are 400 mA h g−1 and 2.65 V, respectively.114 Later, Archer and co-workers reported the performance of an AIB with a V2O5 nanowire cathode and acidic AlCl3–MEICl (1.1:1 mol ratio) electrolyte in the year 2011.36 The Al–V2O5 cell offers profound evidence of stable electrochemical behavior (20 cycles), as shown in Fig. 3a. The cell exhibits a discharge capacity of 305 mA h g−1 and 273 mA h g−1 in the 1st and 20th cycles at a current density of 125 mA g−1. However, the cell is plagued by an unacceptably low discharge potential of 0.5 V and coulombic efficiency of 91%. The cathodic and anodic redox peaks, respectively, emerge at 0.45 V and 0.95 V in the CV profiles (Fig. 3b), which further corroborates the charge–discharge characteristics. It was also proposed that through a three electron transfer reaction, the Al3+ ion intercalates into V2O5, thus forming AlV2O5 (Table 1, sl. no. 12), although the work lacks sufficient experimental and theoretical evidence for this. Earlier, the possibility of Al3+ ion intercalation–deintercalation into a V2O5 aerogel was suggested by Le et al.,115 who confirmed that 3.33 equivalents of Al3+ ions can be inserted per mole of V2O5 (this corresponds to an energy density of 750 W h kg−1 at an intercalation potential of 1.3 V). Nonetheless, in our opinion, the dissemination of Al–Mn2O4 and Al–V2O5 cells bears remarkable importance in triggering a flurry of worldwide academic interest in the quest for ambient temperature rechargeable AIBs in contemporary times.

Wang et al. reported the possibility of Al3+ ion intercalation–deintercalation in VO2 nanorods (Table 1, sl. no. 13).104 The Al–VO2 cells sustained prolonged stability over 100 cycles. The potential plateaus appear at 0.5 V and 0.7 V in the discharge and charge processes, respectively (Fig. 3c), which is in good agreement with the CV profiles (Fig. 3d). The cell could deliver an initial discharge capacity of 165 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 80% at a current density of 50 mA g−1. It also sustained a high current density of 200 mA g−1 delivering a capacity of 70 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle. Computational simulation indicates the insertion of two Al3+ ions per mole of VO2 without any crystal deformation, thus estimating a theoretical capacity of 485 mA h g−1. Interestingly, the employed electrolyte is a neutral mixture of AlCl3 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMICl). At a glance, contrary to earlier reports, it appears that this work opens up an avenue for neutral electrolytes for reversible Al electrodeposition, however, underlying complexities remain.77 This is due to the presence of benzyl sulfoxide in AlCl3–BMICl, the physicochemical behavior of which is yet to be explored and understood. In order to further identify the parameters that influence the performance of Al–V2O5 cells, Amine et al. embarked on an investigation of the cell chemistry with binder-free V2O5 cathodes.116 Their study assessed the instability of the widely used electrode binder polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) over polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquids. The results showed that V2O5 electrodes prepared with PTFE facilitate longer cell life than those prepared with PVDF. Besides, binder-free V2O5 electrodes, which are fabricated by hydrothermal deposition of V2O5 onto an Ni foam current collector, significantly improve the storage capacity of Al–V2O5 cells. The initial discharge capacities are 239 mA h g−1, 86.5 mA h g−1, and 46 mA h g−1, respectively, for Al–V2O5(Ni), Al–V2O5(PTFE), and Al–V2O5(PVDF) cells at a current density of 44.2 mA g−1. It is inferred that the direct growth of V2O5 nanoparticles on the Ni foam minimizes the contact resistance and, thereby, enhances the charge transport. The discharge potential plateaus appear in the voltage range of 0.45–0.6 V for all the investigated Al-cells. Interestingly, efforts aimed at better understanding the chemistry of Al–V2O5 cells by Reed and Menke call into question the proposed Al3+ ion rocking-chair mechanism in V2O5 cathodes.117 In stark contrast to the outcome of earlier investigations on Al–V2O5 cells, they convincingly argue that V2O5 is electrochemically inert in acidic AlCl3–MEICl electrolyte. The CV and galvanostatic cycling profiles obtained from a pristine stainless steel cathode (Fig. 3e and f) are nearly identical to earlier reports of an Al–V2O5 cell.36 Therefore, the electrochemical activities of Al–V2O5 cells are attributed to the reversible corrosion reactions of the constituents (e.g. Fe and Cr) of the stainless steel current collector with the AlCl3–MEICl (Table 1, sl. no. 14), rather than any Al3+ ion intercalation–deintercalation processes in V2O5. A parallel study undertaken by Chiku et al. again refuted the explanation of Reed and Menke.118 By replacing the unstable stainless steel current collector with inert molybdenum and chloroaluminate electrolyte with a mixture of AlCl3, dipropylsulfone and toluene (1:10:5 mol ratio), they convincingly verified the possibility of Al3+ ion intercalation into amorphous V2O5. The CV profiles of the Al–V2O5 cell show cathodic and anodic peaks at 0.8 V and 1.6 V, respectively, which is further corroborated by galvanostatic cycling (Fig. 3g and h). XPS analysis of the discharged/charged V2O5 electrodes confirms the change in the oxidation state of the vanadium ion, thus suggesting an Al3+ ion insertion/extraction reaction in V2O5 (Table 1, sl. no. 15). Similarly, Gu et al. also confirmed Al3+ ion electrochemical activity in V2O5.119 This study provided experimental evidence for the collapse of the V2O5 crystal structure and the formation of an irreversible amorphous layer along the edge of the V2O5 nanowire during the initial Al3+ ion insertion step, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. Moreover, it was proposed that the mechanism of Al3+ ion storage in V2O5 involves both intercalation and phase-transition reactions (Table 1, sl. no. 16). Wang et al. also verified the electrochemical activity of V2O5 in an electrolyte consisting of Al[TfO]3 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate.120 The Al–V2O5 cell delivers an initial discharge capacity of 87 mA h g−1 and stabilizes at 40 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1. However, the discharge voltage is very low (∼0.25 V) and a large overpotential is observed. On the other hand, a comparison of the intercalation energies for Al3+, Li+ and Na+ ions in MoO3 by first-principles simulations predicts a much lower value of energy for Al3+ ions than Li+/Na+ ions, thus signifying the immense potential of MoO3 as an Al3+ ion host in AIBs.121

Carbonaceous materials as cathodes also have significant promise in AIBs. Fluorinated natural graphite (CFx) as a cathode in a secondary Al-cell delivers a discharge capacity of 225 mA h g−1 at a current density of 60 mA g−1 at the 40th cycle, with no noticeable potential plateaus in the voltage range of 0.2–1.5 V.122 Ironically, the charge capacities are unusually higher than the discharge capacities by about 20%. The employed electrolyte is a combination of AlCl3 and 1,3-di-n-butylimidazolium bromide (BIMBr) in a 0.5:1 molar ratio, and the physicochemical details of such mixtures are untraceable. Although it is proposed that reversible Al3+ ion intercalation into graphite is responsible for the storage capacities, Levitin et al. suggested the formation of aluminium fluoride mediated by a faradaic process during the electrochemical reaction of Al3+ ions with fluorinated graphite.123 In an eye-catching and groundbreaking report, Lin et al. revealed an ultrafast AIB with pyrolytic graphite (PG)/porous graphitic foam (GF) as the cathode and acidic AlCl3–MEIC (1.3:1 mol ratio) as the electrolyte, which delivers an exceptionally high power density of 3000 W kg−1 at an energy density of 40 W h kg−1.37 The Al–PG cell exhibits relatively high discharge potential plateaus in two different voltage ranges of 2–2.25 V and 1.5–1.9 V. The discharge capacities are in the range of 60–70 mA h g−1 with coulombic efficiencies of 98% at a current density of 66 mA g−1 (∼1C). On the other hand, the Al–GF cell sustains an incredibly high current rate of 4000 mA g−1 (∼60C), delivering a discharge capacity of 60 mA h g−1 with an extraordinary cell life-span of over 7500 cycles with coulombic efficiencies as high as 97% (Fig. 5a). In addition, this cell could be charged unprecedentedly faster (1 min) than it could be discharged (34 min) at a capacity rate of 60 mA h g−1. Analysis of the discharged/charged state cathodes confirmed the intercalation/deintercalation of AlCl4− in the graphene layers (Table 1, sl. no. 17). For example, the ex situ XRD measurement of the graphite electrode showed the disappearance of the sharp graphitic (002) peak at 2θ = 26.55° on charging, while two new peaks emerged at 28.25° and 23.56° as shown in Fig. 4d. The peak separation analysis suggested expansion of the graphitic host layers to 5.7 Å. Since the size of AlCl4− anions is 5.28 Å, this confirms the intercalation of AlCl4− into the graphitic cathode. First-principles calculations performed by Jung et al. confirm that AlCl4− can be stored in graphite through formation of dual stacked ionic layers in the interlayer spacing of graphite.124 It is also noted that the diffusivity of AlCl4− increases noticeably with a decrease in the number of graphene layers and, hence, the nanoscale thickness of the graphitic foam is held responsible for the ultrafast behavior observed by Lin et al.37 Further strengthening the argument of AlCl4− intercalation into graphite and supporting the ultrafast nature of Al–graphite cells, Wu et al. theoretically suggested that the expansion of the interlayer spacing of graphite from 3.353 Å to 6.025 Å upon AlCl4− intercalation results in a reduction of the diffusion energy barrier for AlCl4− (∼0.023 eV) in graphite, which is about one order of magnitude lower than that for Li+.125 In contrast to the proposal of Cl2 intercalation into graphite by Gifford et al., these recent studies support Armand's conclusion of AlCl4− intercalation into graphite.81,82 Sun et al. also produced a 1.8 V AIB assembled with graphitic carbon paper as the cathode and acidic AlCl3–MEIC (1.3:1 mol ratio) as the electrolyte.102,108,126 At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the discharge capacities are in the range of 82–85 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, expansion of the graphitic layers from 3.3 Å to 4.55 Å is seen in the electrode after cycling, which suggests the intercalation of chloroaluminate anions. On the contrary, Tsuda et al. noticed a completely different phenomenon with an activated carbon fiber cathode and an acidic AlBr3–MEIBr electrolyte.127 XPS analysis indicates adsorption/desorption of Br2 and Br3− on the carbon fiber during the discharge/charge processes (Table 1, sl no. 18).

Zhang et al. introduced the concept of a dual-ion AIB with a graphite cathode and a conventional Li-ion battery electrolyte (e.g. LiPF6 dissolved carbonates).38 Their prototype system could incredibly deliver an energy density of 220 W h kg−1 (or 150 W h kg−1) at a power density of 130 W kg−1 (or 1200 W kg−1). The cell shows discharge capacities of 100 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles with coulombic efficiencies of 98% at a current density of 200 mA g−1 (∼2C). In addition, the working potential of the cell is very high (∼3.4–4.8 V), as shown in Fig. 5b, and both of the ions (i.e. PF6− and Li+) present in the electrolyte equally participate in the discharge/charge processes. While PF6− intercalates into graphite during charging, the Li+ reacts with Al to form an Al–Li alloy (Table 1, sl. no. 19). Similarly, Sun et al. demonstrated the performance of a hybrid AIB with LiFePO4 as the cathode.110 A mixture of acidic AlCl3–MEIC and LiAlCl4 was utilized as the electrolyte. The most notable feature of this battery is the flat discharge profile at 1.3 V with a low overpotential of 0.2 V. The cell delivers discharge capacities in the range of 160–125 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2C over 50 cycles. The electrochemical redox reactions involve reversible Al deposition/stripping at the Al anode and Li+ ion intercalation/deintercalation in LiFePO4 (Table 1, sl. no. 20).
Another class of cathode materials for AIBs is metal sulfides. The relatively lower electronegativity and larger atomic radius of sulfur compared to oxygen reduce the electrostatic interactions of Al3+ ions when inserting into metal sulfides, thus improving the diffusion of Al3+ ions in sulfides compared to oxides.106 Verifying this, Geng et al. showed that the Chevrel phase of Mo6S8 can host Al3+ ions in an acidic AlCl3–BMICl electrolyte.106 Consistent with the CV profiles, the discharge of the Al–Mo6S8 cell possesses two distinct potential plateaus at 0.55 V and 0.37 V (Fig. 5c). The initial discharge cycle shows a capacity of 148 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 58% at a current density of 12 mA g−1. The low efficiency is attributed to partial trapping of the intercalated Al3+ ions in the Mo6S8 structure, stress induced pulverization of the Mo6S8 particles upon Al3+ ion intercalation and electrolyte decomposition. The cell maintains stability over 50 cycles at a capacity of 70 mA h g−1. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of the discharged state cathode suggests that Mo6S8 could undergo phase transition to Al2Mo6S8 (Table 1, sl. no. 21). A clearer picture of Al3+ ion insertion into Mo6S8 was provided by Lee et al. with the proposal of a two-step two-phase insertion mechanism.128 In the first step, Al3+ ions occupy the inner ring sites in the Chevrel phase and form an AlMo6S8 phase. In the second step, Al3+ ions fill one outer ring site in every three AlMo6S8 units and, finally, form an Al4/3Mo6S8 phase. Ni- and Fe-based sulfides have also been investigated.129–131 The Al–Ni3S2 cell, reported by Wang et al., stabilizes at the 40th cycle with a capacity of ∼60 mA h g−1, falling from a high initial value of 350 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1.129 The discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 5d. The analysis of the discharged state electrode signifies the formation of Al2S3, NiCl2 and NiS, suggesting a possible reversible conversion mechanism (Table 1, sl. no. 22). On the other hand, the Al–NiS cell exhibits excellent stability over 100 cycles with a capacity of around 100 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1.130 However, the charge–discharge and CV profiles of the Al–NiS cell are identical to those of the Al–Ni3S2 system.129,130Ex situ XPS measurement of the discharged state NiS electrode shows the characteristic peak of Ni3S2 at 852.8 eV (Fig. 4h). This suggests the reversible transformation of NiS to Ni3S2 during the discharge–charge processes (Table 1, sl. no. 23). Similarly, Mori et al. confirmed the transformation of FeS2 to FeS and Al2S3 during electrochemical reaction with Al3+ ions.131 Generally, upon Li+/Na+ ion insertion, FeS2 initially forms layered Li2FeS2/Na2FeS2 before transforming to Fe and Li2S/Ni2S.131 The high electron density of Al3+ ions causes sluggish diffusion of Al3+ ions in FeS2 and restricts the formation of any layered structure. Besides metal sulfides, elemental sulfur is also a perspective cathode material for AIBs.105,132 Xia et al. performed experiments with sulfur-impregnated activated carbon as a cathode and acidic AlCl3–triethylamine hydrochloride ionic liquid as an electrolyte.132 The emergence of sharp cathodic and anodic redox peaks, respectively, at 1.65 V and 2.05 V in the CV profile signifies the intense electrochemical activity of sulfur in the Al–S cell. A fairly stable and high capacity of ∼110 mA h g−1 with a high discharge potential plateau at 1.8 V is seen over 40 cycles at a current density of 15 mA g−1. It is also noted that certain electrolyte additives (e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane) significantly impact the cell performance. Reversible conversion of sulfur to Al2S3 is thought to be the guiding electrochemical reaction. An elaborate study on a sulfur cathode with an acidic AlCl3–MEIC (1.3:1 mol ratio) electrolyte was later pursued by Gao et al.105 They reported lower discharge and charge potential plateaus at 0.65 V and 1.4 V, respectively. Remarkably, the Al–S cell delivers discharge capacities as high as 1000 mA h g−1 over 20 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Ex situ XPS measurement of the discharged state sulfur electrode shows reduction of sulfur to S2− and S− species (Fig. 4i), confirming that sulfur undergoes a solid-state conversion reaction in the formation process of Al2S3.
Metal chlorides are also attracting attention as cathodes in AIBs.133,134 Suto et al. investigated the electrochemistry of an Al–VCl3 cell with an acidic AlCl3–MEIC electrolyte.133 The discharge–charge profiles are shown in Fig. 5e. The cell exhibits low storage capacities and abysmally poor stability, which are attributed to unoptimized electrode processing and dissolution of VCl3 in the electrolyte. The dissolution could be arrested to a certain degree by using electrolyte additives (e.g. fluorobenzene). Two stage electrochemical reactions are proposed based on X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. First, VCl3 is reversibly reduced to VCl2 and second, VCl2 is irreversibly reduced to V. The theoretical capacity and energy density of the Al–VCl3 couple based on the redox reaction of V3+ to V0 are estimated to be 170 mA h g−1 and 177 W h kg−1 (or 523 W h l−1), respectively. In a separate study, while evaluating the electrochemistry of Al–Ni/NiCl2 cells, Nakaya et al. found that the degree of acidity of the AlCl3–BPC electrolyte critically affects the performance of the cells.134 It is also noted that the dissolution of the parent cathode and reaction products in the electrolyte can be significantly reduced by controlling the physicochemical properties of the electrolyte. For example, the solubility of NiCl2 in AlCl3–BPC reduces to a 15-fold lower value when the molar concentration of AlCl3 changes from 1.5 to 0.9. Reed et al. described the prospect of using the copper analogue of Prussian blue (copper hexacyanoferrate) as a cathode in AIBs.135 The cells were tested in an electrolyte composed of aluminium triflate and diglyme. The intercalating species was found to be the aluminium–diglyme complex [Al(Di)23+] rather than a free Al3+ ion. Gaussian calculations predict a theoretical capacity of 73 mA h g−1 for one Al3+ ion insertion per unit cell of copper hexacyanoferrate. However, the cell delivers low discharge capacities in the range of 10–60 mA h g−1 and the long-term capacity retention is poor. This is mainly attributed to the instability of the Al anode due to passivation with AlF3. Moreover, the discharge–charge occurs in a low potential range of 0–0.8 V with a large overpotential.
In addition to inorganic materials, the potential of conductive polymers as cathodes in AIBs is also resurfacing.136,137 Hudak demonstrated that energy densities of 44 W h kg−1 and 46 W h kg−1 could be extracted from Al–polythiophene and Al–polypyrrole cells, respectively, at ambient temperature.136 The discharge–charge profiles of Al–polythiophene with an acidic AlCl3–MEIC electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5f. These polymer cells sustain considerably longer cell life (∼400 cycles) with negligible loss of storage capacity and coulombic efficiency. It is noted that the cut-off voltage range in galvanostatic cycling significantly influences the capacity values, which range from 30 to 100 mA h g−1 at 1C. For example, higher cut-off voltages improve the capacity in Al–polythiophene cells but reduce the coulombic efficiency. Interestingly, charge storage occurs via both faradaic and nonfaradaic processes. Koura et al. also identified the excellent electrochemical characteristics of poly-p-phenylene in acidic AlCl3–BPC electrolyte.137 The Al–(poly-p-phenylene) cell shows discharge capacities of around 50 mA h g−1 at current densities in the range of 0.1–1 mA cm−2. The cathodic and anodic redox peaks appear at 1 V and 1.3 V, respectively, in the CV profiles. However, the mechanism of charge storage is not known explicitly.
3.2. Identification of non-aqueous electrolytes functional at ambient temperature
Selection of the right electrolyte, besides the cathode, is unimpeachably crucial for a commercially viable and successful battery technology. Therefore, utmost attention has been focused on unearthing novel Al3+ ion conducting non-aqueous electrolytes and understanding their underlying complex chemistries. As discussed earlier, identification of suitable electrolytes for AIBs is not trivial, unlike for Li/Na-ion battery counterparts. AIBs strictly require electroplating/electrostripping of Al on itself, a process that appears to be fundamentally strenuous, particularly in conventional organic electrolytes. For instance, Archer et al. reported that Al showed no electrochemical activity in an electrolyte of aluminium trifluoromethansulfonate dissolved in an aprotic liquid mixture of propylene carbonate and tetrahydrofuran.36 So far, chloroaluminates with ambient temperature melting points are the quintessential liquid electrolytes for AIBs.36,37,104,122 However, there are several yet unknown physicochemical factors that may guide the performance of an AIB. For instance, the influence of anions of imidazolium-based ionic liquids and the composition of AlCl3/imidazolium ionic liquids on the electrochemical activities are not known. In an attempt to unveil these secrets, Wang et al. recently performed a series of systematic investigations with three different kinds of halogenated imidazolium ionic liquids, namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMICl), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIBr) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII).138 It is evident, as shown in Fig. 6a, that AlCl3–BMICl possesses a higher stable electrochemical potential window (∼4.7 V) than AlCl3–BMIBr (∼3.9 V) and AlCl3–BMII (∼2 V) versus Al/Al3+, which signifies the importance of the chloride anion. As predicted by Density Functional Theory calculations, this is attributed to the higher stability of the chloride anion. The stability order is as follows: AlCl4− > AlCl3Br− > AlCl3I−. In addition, the ionic conductivity also follows the same pattern, with the highest conductivity displayed by AlCl3–BMICl (9.1 mS cm−1 at 30 °C). On the other hand, theoretical calculations of the energy levels of the BMIM+–AlCl4−, BMIM+–AlCl3Br− and BMIM+–AlCl3I− ion pairs suggest a negligible impact of the side chains of the imidazolium cation on both the cathodic and anodic limiting potentials. Furthermore, it is found that the electrochemical stability window of AlCl3–BMICl is strongly dependent on its molar composition. For instance, the anode limiting potential of AlCl3–BMICl with a molar ratio of 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1 is found to be about 2.6 V (vs. Al/Al3+), higher than that of AlCl3–BMICl with molar ratio of 0.8:1 (∼1.75 V). Similarly, the cathode limiting potential is about −0.2 V (vs. Al/Al3+) for molar compositions of 1.5:1 and 2:1, which is much larger than that for the 0.8:1, 1:1 and 1.1:1 compositions (−2.0 V vs. Al/Al3+). This deviation is a consequence of the formation of different anions with the varying compositions of AlCl3–BMICl (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, when these electrolytes are investigated in Al–V2O5 cells, only the cell with a 1.1:1 molar ratio of AlCl3–BMICl is rechargeable, with moderate discharge capacity values (∼100 mA h g−1). Except for the first discharge curve, the discharge–charge characteristics are identical to those previously reported for Al–V2O5 cells.36 The extreme corrosion of the Al anode, supported by SEM images, is responsible for the negligible electrochemical activities of Al–V2O5 cells with higher molar ratios (>1.1:1) of AlCl3–BMICl. In probing the atomistic origin behind the superior performance of chloroaluminate-based ionic liquid electrolytes over traditional carbonates for AIBs, Kamath et al. revealed that facile transport of Al3+ ions is more feasible in chloroaluminates due to the significantly lower free energy of solvation and co-ordination for Al3+ ions.139

Although haloaluminate-based ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolytes for AIBs, they suffer from certain demerits. These electrolytes are extremely corrosive, viscous and hygroscopic in nature, which imposes serious constraints on their processing. The method of reducing the viscosity by adding certain organic solvents is supposedly ineffective because this process further makes them volatile and flammable.140 There are certain water and air stable ionic liquids for electrodeposition of Al, such as 1-butyl-1-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, trihexyl-tetradecyl-phosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, dicyanamide and 4-propylpyridine.141–145 However, there are no reports on their use in AIBs to date. Hence, there is intensive demand for alternative electrolytes for AIBs. Kitada et al., for the first time, showed the reversible electrodeposition of Al on an Al substrate using an AlCl3 dissolved diglyme (G2) electrolyte (1:5 mol ratio).140 The study was further extended to triglyme (G3), tetraglyme (G4) and butyldiglyme (butylG2).146 The CV profiles (Fig. 6b) evidence that reversible electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al is feasible only in the AlCl3–G2 electrolyte. In general, the ionic species in AlCl3–glymes are AlCl4− and [AlCl2(glyme)n]+. Due to the natural desolvation ability of G2, only the [AlCl2(G2)2]+ complex is electrochemically reducible to Al at the anode. This behavior is in stark contrast to Li and Mg electrodeposition in glymes.146 A similar kind of study by Reed et al. also suggested the possibility of reversible electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al in ether-based electrolytes.147 The investigated electrolyte was aluminium trifluoromethansulfonate (Al[TfO]3) dissolved diglyme. The CV profiles (Fig. 6c) show that the electrodeposition process is plagued by severe passivation after the initial cycles. This effect is mainly attributed to the formation of insulating AlF3 on the Al surface. An inverse relationship of electrochemical stability window with electrolyte conductivity is also noticed. A maximum conductivity of 25 mS cm−1 with a minimum stability window of 5.5 V is obtained from 1 M Al[TfO]3. These investigations certainly encourage further comprehensive studies on ether-based electrolytes.
Revisiting the proposal of Legrand et al. regarding sulfone-based electrolytes, Nakayama et al. performed an in-depth investigation to demystify the influence of the concentration of AlCl3 and electrolyte additives on the electrochemical behavior of dialkylsulfones.148 The 27Al NMR and XAFS analyses convincingly showed that Al2Cl7−, rather than Al(DXSO2)33+, is exclusively responsible for the electrodeposition of Al in AlCl3–sulfone electrolytes.94,95,148 Further evidence is reflected in the fact that replacement of AlCl3 with Al(BF4)3 in ethyl isopropyl sulfone (EiPS) results in no electrochemical activity at ambient temperature or beyond. This signifies that Al(EiPS)33+ cations are electrochemically inactive. Strikingly, addition of additives (e.g. toluene) changes the viscosity of AlCl3–sulfones to a favorable limit, thus making them electroactive at ambient temperature. The proposed ternary phase diagram, as shown in Fig. 6d, serves as a guiding map for the proper selection of an electrolyte. These electrolytes inhibit corrosion and growth of Al dendrites, making them of great interest for AIBs.
In order to tackle the problem of corrosion and moisture sensitivity of chloroaluminates, Mandai et al. disclosed a ternary electrolyte comprising Al[TfO]3, N-methylacetamide (NMA) and urea.149 The noncorrosive property of Al[TfO]3 makes it more favorable than corrosive AlCl3. However, the selection of the solvent for Al[TfO]3 is apparently very crucial, since it lacks electrochemical activity in carbonates or tetrahydrofuran.36,149 It was shown that a certain composition of NMA and urea (e.g. Al[TfO]3:NMA:urea = 1:15:4) completely dissociates Al[TfO]3. Hence, solvated Al3+ ions are responsible for reversible electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al (Fig. 6e). Although the proposed electrolyte is better in terms of electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity compared to chloroaluminate-based ionic liquids, the efficiency of electrodeposition is considerably lower owing to the strong solvation of Al3+ ions by the polar NMA and urea molecules. Nonetheless, this type of electrolyte with enhanced efficiency is expected to be beneficial for AIBs. Deviating again from chloroaluminates, Wang et al. developed a noncorrosive and water-stable electrolyte from Al[TfO]3 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate.120 The performance of this electrolyte was evaluated in Al–V2O5 cells and it was found that the concentration of Al[TfO]3 significantly influences the storage capacity and overpotential. The optimized concentration is found to be 0.5 mol l−1. Moreover, the electrolyte sustains a high oxidation voltage of 3.25 V vs. Al3+/Al. In certain cases, ethylbenzene could also serve as an electrolyte solvent for AIBs.150
In addition, polymer gel electrolytes can also act as a protection shield against moisture. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of moisture in chloroaluminate ionic liquids, Sun et al. developed a polymer electrolyte by free radical polymerization of acrylamide monomers in a solution consisting of dichloromethane, AlCl3 and MEICl.107 The tendency of Al2Cl7− anions to form complexes with traditional polymers (e.g. polyethylene oxide, polyacrylonitrile, polymethylmethacrylate and polyvinylidene fluoride), generally used for Li-ion/polymer batteries, makes them undesirable as polymer hosts. The polyacrylamide–AlCl3–MEICl electrolyte sustains reversible electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al after being exposed to air, evidencing the shielding against moisture.
4. Challenges
There are multiple challenges that need to be overcome by any new breakthrough battery technology while undergoing maturation from the laboratory to mainstream commercial platforms. AIBs are also no exception and suffer from certain fundamental and technical challenges, as can be ascertained from past and current studies.36,37,116,117 It is well expected that a commercially successful battery should possess better energy/power densities, longer life-span, enhanced safety and affordability. The investigations carried out over the past five years indicate that AIBs could fall short in offering energy and power densities similar to Li-ion batteries. Nonetheless, they would be competitive with Pb-acid batteries. Though the work of Lin et al. promises exceptionally high power density AIBs, the practically recoverable power based on the total weight of a completely packaged battery could be much lower.37 Of course, there is ample room for improvement, consistent with the view that this battery chemistry is in the nascent development stages. In our opinion, the following interlinked key obstacles are deemed to be of paramount importance and urgently need to be overcome for commercially viable AIBs.
(a) The main focus in AIBs is to utilize the superior electrochemical properties of metallic aluminium as an anode. Pristine aluminium is intrinsically passivated by a strong protective Al2O3 layer that is a few nanometers thick (∼5 nm) in ambient atmosphere.151 This oxide layer, in addition to reducing the electrode potential below the theoretical value, causes a delay to or completely ceases the electrochemical activity of aluminium. Reflecting this point, Wang et al. noticed that Al–V2O5 cells with pretreated Al as the anode are only capable of showing galvanostatic discharge–charge behaviors.120 Pretreatment is performed by immersing Al in acidic chloroaluminates under an inert atmosphere. Xia et al. also mentioned the delayed response of electrodeposition/electrostripping of Al in the initial few cycles of cyclic voltammetry measurements.132 Therefore, it should be noted that pretreatment steps might be essential to partially or completely eliminate the Al2O3 layer, which, in turn, will facilitate the establishment of an electrochemically favorable interface between the aluminium anode and the electrolyte. Another approach would be to explore aluminium alloys with suitable alloying elements.152,153
(b) The difficulty in the electrodeposition/electrostripping of aluminium considerably restricts the choice of electrolytes for AIBs. Acidic chloroaluminates such as AlCl3–MEICl, which are liquid at ambient temperature, are by far the most extensively used electrolytes. Although no pretreatment of aluminium is required and deposition efficiencies as high as 100% can be attained in these types of electrolytes, there are certain major drawbacks of using them, particularly in batteries. First, evolution of toxic Cl2 is possible due to the oxidation of AlCl4−via 4AlCl4− + 2e− → 2Al2Cl7− + Cl2.76,77,138 Second, growth of aluminium dendrites cannot be ruled out. Jiang et al. clearly observed the formation of dendrites, particularly at high current densities (∼100 mA cm−2).77 Reed et al. evidenced a dense mat of aluminium dendrites embedded in the glass fiber separator.117 Such events also occurred in NaAlCl4 electrolyte at current densities as low as 1.4 mA cm−2.72 Third, instances of uncontrolled dissolution of the aluminium anode in the electrolyte have been observed under idle conditions.138 Fourth, chloroaluminates are extremely corrosive. This limits the choices for current collectors and cell packaging materials. The instability of stainless steel has been clearly verified.117 Molybdenum (or tantalum) is suggested as a possible replacement for stainless steel,118,129,148 but it is of high cost (∼USD 45 per kg).61 Finally, chloroaluminate electrolytes based on ionic liquids are highly viscous, hygroscopic and expensive. These considerations could jeopardise the safety and large-scale production of AIBs. On the other hand, organic electrolytes have lower levels of solubility of aluminium salts, and lower conductivities and deposition efficiencies, which are again severe limiting factors for an electrolyte.36,146,147,154 In addition, the formation of insulating AlF3 in certain organic electrolytes further exacerbates the passivation of the aluminium anode.135,147,155,156 Therefore, intricate complexities are involved in the process of finding an appropriate electrolyte for AIBs.
(c) Investigations show that the energy and power densities of AIBs are cathode-limited. A high storage capacity at elevated electrode potentials is an indispensable requirement for any cathode material. Unfortunately, most of the investigated materials deliver discharge capacities of less than 100 mA h g−1. Moreover, their electrode potentials are dismally low (<1 V), except for graphite (∼2 V). These values are acutely insufficient for developing a battery of high performance. There are two major obstacles in finding cathode materials for AIBs. The first is the unease in inserting trivalent Al3+ ions into the cathodes owing to the high charge density.106,119 In addition, the insertion kinetics of Al3+ ions are expected to be quite complex. For example, V2O5 shows discharging ability at 1 V,118 while the majority of studies report discharge at 0.5 V.36,116,119,120 The second obstacle is the instability of the cathodes in the electrolytes. There are instances of dissolution of the cathodes in the electrolytes leading to self-discharge and poor life-span of the batteries.84,133 Considering the degree of difficulty in reversibly inserting divalent Mg2+ ions into cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries,19–21 it is well anticipated that developing a cathode for hosting trivalent Al3+ ions will be an even greater challenge.
(d) Polymer binders are essential in the fabrication process of electrodes for batteries. The most commonly used polymer in the battery industry is polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). However, PVDF is incompatible with acidic chloroaluminate electrolytes.116 Similarly, the instability of traditional polymer separators would not be a big surprise. Additionally, the separator must be mechanically strong to resist the growth of Al dendrites. Therefore, it is immensely important to explore stable binders and separators for AIBs.
Hence, it should be remarked that not only the discovery and optimization of the cathodes and electrolytes are essential, but also understanding the stability of the inactive components such as the current collectors, separators and binders is equally important in order to make AIBs a commercial reality.
5. Lessons and opportunities from Li/Na-ion batteries
The roadmap for developing novel and efficient cathodes for AIBs could be defined from the available vast and systematic knowledge pool of Li/Na-ion batteries. A myriad of examples demonstrate that nanostructuring the cathodes or anodes significantly influences the electrochemical performance of these batteries.13,157–161 Decreasing the dimensions of electrodes to the nanoscale dramatically changes the charge transport kinetics and, subsequently, the electrochemical processes.159 In this context, we particularly highlight nanostructures of V2O5, since this material is extensively used in AIBs. For example, V2O5 nanobelts not only show much larger Li+ ion storage capacities, but also the Li+ ion insertion kinetics are noticeably different compared to bulk V2O5.162 It is also found that the Li+ ion diffusion constant in V2O5 nanoribbons is faster than that in bulk V2O5 by three orders of magnitude.163 This could also be true for Al3+ ion insertion into V2O5. The Al–V2O5 cells reported so far make use of V2O5 nanowires of identical dimensions.36,116,119,120 Therefore, a comprehensive study identifying the dependence of Al3+ ion insertion on the size and morphology of the V2O5 cathode will provide added guidance for materials scientists in designing cathode materials for AIBs. Also, the dependence of the crystal structure of V2O5 on the insertion kinetics of Al3+ ions cannot be ruled out. For example, an initial study showed that amorphous V2O5 intercalates Al3+ ions at 1 V,118 while the orthorhombic phase of V2O5 intercalates at approximately 0.5 V.36,116,119,120 Investigation of Al–Ni3S2 and Al–NiS cells again underscores the importance of crystal phases,129,130 since NiS is electrochemically much more stable than Ni3S2 under identical cell operation. This type of investigation in greater depth could be immediately extended to other transition metal oxides or sulphides for identification of novel cathodes for AIBs.
It is now well known that pulverization of certain types of electrode materials due to volume expansion during repeated Li+/Na+ ion intercalation causes premature failure of Li/Na-ion batteries.164–166 This problem is circumvented by designing electrodes with special morphologies or hierarchical architectures, where sufficient buffer space is available to accommodate the local volume change.164–166 An instance of 50% volume expansion of natural graphite during discharging/charging in an Al-ion cell has been reported37 and an expansion of graphite layers from 3.353 Å to 6.025 Å upon AlCl4− intercalation has been theoretically proven.125 Similarly, stress-induced cracks are visible on Mo6S8 particles upon cycling in Al-ion cells.106 Therefore, pulverization of cathodes in AIBs is equally possible and needs to be accounted for by adopting the established methodologies for Li/Na-ion batteries.
Possible solutions to the detrimental issue of dissolution of cathodes in AIBs could be borrowed from the fundamental understanding of Li–S batteries. Shuttling and dissolution of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 2 < n < 8) is a major cause of capacity fading in Li–S batteries.167–169 However, certain approaches to modify the sulfur cathode have been immensely fruitful in mitigating this problem.160,167–169 For example, sequestration of elemental sulfur in mesoporous carbons (e.g. CMK-3, hollow carbon spheres etc.) inhibits lithium polysulfide dissolution resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance in Li–S cells.167,168 This idea of encapsulating the active cathode materials in a porous and conductive carbon shell could be utilized in designing cathodes for AIBs. It is appropriate to note here the observed distinction in the charge/discharge voltage profiles of the two investigated Al–S cells.105,132 Therefore, it should be commented that tremendous opportunities exist to understand the fundamental operation of Al–S batteries. Again, the study of Al-conducting polymers opens wonderful avenues for further optimizing the performance of Al–S batteries.136 The best conducting polymer and sulfur cathodes could be achieved by using a sulfur-conducting polymer composite cathode in AIBs, since conducting polymer cathodes are extremely stable and sulfur cathodes display discharge plateaus as high as 1.65 V.132,136,137 A similar strategy has already been found to be very promising for Li–S batteries.170 Seizing these exciting and straightforward opportunities will certainly pave the way for establishing a mature platform for AIBs.
A design strategy for safe and stable AIBs requires a better understanding of the electrodeposition of aluminium on to itself. Growth of Li/Na dendrites either at low or high current densities in Li/Na-batteries is an often observed natural phenomenon.171,172 Extensive research in this area has opened up explicit rational methods that augment the stability of the electrode–electrolyte interface and circumvent the unwanted dendrite growth.171 There are instances of growth of aluminium dendrites in Al-ion cells but nothing is known so far about its occurrence.72,77,117 It is proposed that, in addition to conventional solid electrolytes, mechanically strong and highly ionic conducting nanostructured electrolytes are very effective in arresting the growth of Li dendrites.171,173–177 Similar strategies may also be suggested for AIBs. Another trivial approach relies on the exploration of various separators known for Li/Na-ion batteries.178 Computational methods will also be powerful and essential in identifying the critical cell parameters that promote the growth of nucleation sites for dendrite formation.171,179–181
6. Conclusions
A chronology of the developments of rechargeable non-aqueous AIBs since 1970 is depicted in this review. It is undeniable that the energy and power densities of state-of-the-art AIBs could be comparable to or higher than those of Pb-acid batteries. This possibility, combined with the high abundance and low cost of aluminium resources, provides key advantages that may project AIBs as the storage platform of choice for application in large-scale energy storage systems. The very short period of research into AIBs has identified multiple exciting fundamental and engineering challenges for which solutions are being sought. The accomplishment of an ambient temperature AIB itself is a major breakthrough. The progress in this field since 2010 is unprecedented and there is certainly ample scope for improvement. An integrated approach is necessary in designing electrolytes that are compatible with all other constituent components of a battery. The discovery of novel high voltage and high capacity cathode materials is simultaneously required for achieving significant improvements in AIBs. An Edisonian approach may not be fruitful in this area. Therefore, it is important to guide the experimental strategies by using computational and simulation studies to determine the important structural and electrochemical parameters of the cathodes and electrolytes. The nature of the electrode–electrolyte interface is so far completely unexplored. Research efforts must also be devoted to unveiling the mysteries of the electrode–electrolyte interface, so that better electrochemical interfaces can be accomplished. We hope that success in these areas will create new opportunities for AIBs and definitely narrow the gap for placing a footprint in the commercial arena in future.
