Metallopolymers play an increasingly important role as functional materials for energy production, conservation and storage. In this review, we explore the recent advances of metallopolymers in the areas of organic solar cells, white light organic light-emitting diodes and lithium-ion batteries. The structure–property relationship of these polymers and their device performances are paid special attention and described.
Introduction
With the enormous growth of population and the rapid development of economy, the energy crisis originating from the limited reserves of fossil fuels and the environmental problems caused by the massive emission of carbon dioxide are regarded as two great challenges for human beings in the 21st century. In order to meet the energy demand for fitting our daily life, it is quite essential to seek alternative forms of energy and environmentally-benign power sources. Pursuing new kinds of sustainable and clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, has attracted broad interest in both academia and industry over the past few decades. The World Energy Outlook issued by the International Energy Agency also indicates a tripling of the energy generation based on these renewable energy sources between 2008 and 2035.1 In particular, the clean and perpetually available solar power is undoubtedly one promising source for energy supplement. Harvesting energy directly from sunlight by using photovoltaic devices has been considered to be one of the most effective ways of addressing the global energy and environment issues. Compared with the traditional inorganic technology built on the semiconductive silicon materials, solar cells based on organic polymers show the distinguishing features of structural diversity, processing compatibility, device flexibility and large-scale feasibility and thus have been extensively explored in recent years.2–7
Solar energy conversion is an attractive route to develop permanent and clean energy; however, as solar irradiation is intermittent, it is also desirable to store the converted energy in the form of electricity in order to use it efficiently and completely. Energy storage techniques, especially the use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), are of great importance in the mobile society today due to their high energy density and high output voltage. Although the LIBs that are commonly used nowadays are dominated by inorganic metal complexes in the electronic device market, the rapid progress in portable electronics, such as ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight and flexible devices, brings new challenges to the bulky and rigid conventional LIBs.8 For the sake of matching practical requirements and market demands, organic batteries based on redox-active polymers with robust structures have currently become an area of considerable research interest.9–12
On the other hand, lighting consumes over 20% of the total electricity produced in the earth. A majority of such energy consumption and cost comes from the traditional light sources such as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps used in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Therefore, the interest and demand for more energy-efficient products for general lighting purposes are growing rapidly. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) hold promise for use in display applications and general illumination for many reasons, including their improved efficiency and low cost.13 Phosphorescence emissions from metal-containing materials are found to be useful for OLED applications. The efficiency of energy conversion in OLEDs can be enhanced by up to four times, which enables white OLEDs to become a potential new source of “green” solid-state lighting. By embedding metal elements into polymeric scaffolds, both the physical and chemical characteristics of the resulting organometallic materials can be finely tuned, which combine the optical and electronic properties attributed to metal ions with the processing and mechanical features inherent to carbon-based polymers.14,15 The metal centers play a pivotal role in determining the functions of the metal-containing polymers. Since the mid-1990s, the successful synthesis of hundreds of metallopolymers with a unique coherence of spectroscopic properties, redox activity and chemical stability has triggered their potential application in diversified fields.2,16–21 Although several reviews are already available for organic solar cells,3–5,7 lithium-ion batteries,9,11,12 white light-emitting diodes or metal-containing polymers,16–21 there is still a lack of papers that can provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the fundamentals and development of metallopolymers for energy production, storage and conservation (Fig. 1). This review will cover the most significant and representative metallopolymers that have been applied in these three areas. Particular attention will be focused on discussing the structure–property relationships and device performances.

Metallopolymers for energy production
Generally, there are two types of organic based solar energy utilization devices: bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The metal-containing polymeric solar cells are based on the concepts of BHJSCs by blending the donor polymer and the acceptor molecule within a single active layer. These solar cells are attractive owing to their thin film architecture, high absorption coefficients and extended solar energy coverage induced by the metal–organic interaction. Their material properties are tunable by the choice of metal ions and organic spacers. The following section will be devoted to the recent progress in BHJSCs using metallopolymers.
Platinum(II)-based polymers for BHJSCs
Conjugated polymers have received increasing attention as readily-processed organic semiconductor materials. Unlike pure organic conjugated polymers, mixing of metal and ligand orbitals can occur in metallopolymers, which results in special features in these materials. Especially in the Pt(II) acetylenic polymeric framework MP1, π-conjugation of the ligand is preserved through metal22 and their photophysical properties and photovoltaic responses can be fine-tuned by structural modification of the aromatic spacer (Ar). Due to the presence of Pt(II) heavy metal, which induces strong spin–orbit coupling and thus makes singlet to triplet intersystem crossing rapid and efficient, Pt(II) conjugated polymers are suitable systems for investigating the relationship among the chemical structures, the evolution of singlet and triplet states and their photovoltaic performance. The complexation of an electron-donating Pt(II) ion into the main chain was also reported to enhance the interchain charge transport of π-conjugated polymers. The key role of Pt is indicated by the improved absorption in the visible region as well as the improved film morphology, resulting in better solar cell performance and high charge carrier mobilities.3 The first series of Pt(II) acetylide polymers investigated for their solar cell performance refers to those with oligothiophenes as the conjugated bridging ligands (MP1).23 The energy of their optical absorption gap decreases with increasing the number of thiophene units due to an increased delocalization of π-electrons along the polymer backbone. The optical gap is shifted down to 2.40 eV for MP1-3. Photocurrent is detected in single layer devices through the ITO or gold electrode for polymers MP1. MP1-1–MP1-3 show an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.50, 0.75 and 0.47 and fill factors (FF) of 0.32, 0.35 and 0.30, respectively, under illumination at intensities of 90 μW cm−2, 185 μW cm−2 and 440 μW cm−2. In 2006, Reynolds and Schanze investigated the MP1-1 based solar cell again in a BHJ configuration by blending MP1-1 with acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the active layer on the ITO glass substrate.24 In the blend ratio of 1:4 for MP1-1:PC61BM, the device affords the best photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.27%. Photoinduced charge separation in the blends is believed to occur via the triplet exited state of MP1-1.25  
A series of solution-processable and strongly visible-light absorbing polyplatinynes containing oligothienyl–fluorene hybrids MP2 were reported by Wong et al.26 The photovoltaic behavior depends significantly on the number of thienyl rings (m) along the polymer chain due to an improvement of the optical characteristics and charge transporting properties as m increases. From m = 0 to m = 3, the bandgap of MP2 vary from 2.93 to 2.33 eV, which results in a red-shift of the absorption wavelength and an enhancement of the absorptivity of the polymers. A clear trend in the increment of intrachain mobility is also noted along the series up to an order of magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 because of the more extended π-conjugation. At the blend ratio of 1:5 for MP2:PCBM, the η increases sharply from MP2-1 to MP2-4, by simply adding altogether six thienyl rings along the main chain. An η value of 2.47–2.88% can be obtained for MP2-3 and MP2-4 with broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves which cover the spectrum up to 800 nm with a maximum EQE value of 55.7 and 83.2%, respectively. This approach provides a useful avenue for η enhancement by simple structural optimization.  
Similar to MP2, MP3 with electron-rich and strongly blue-absorbing chromophore, phenothiazine–oligothiophene moieties, shows different degrees of absorption capabilities in the solar spectral region showing with different extent of electronic conjugation.27 Again, the optical absorption and electrochemical and electronic properties can be tuned by a suitable manipulation of the oligothienyl chain length. This in turn can improve the photovoltaic performance and an η of 1.3% is obtained for MP3-3.

  Basically, most of the reported Pt(II) polyynes are usually characterized by their relatively large bandgaps.28 Successful strategies are carried out for the creation of narrow bandgap metallopolyynes involving the construction of donor–acceptor (D–A) type systems, which are found to be useful for photovoltaic applications.3 In these polymers, due to the creation of a D–A chromophore based on a combination of a central electron-accepting moiety and electron-donating thiophene rings throughout the chain, the bandgaps of these polymers are significantly lower relative to the one with the purely electron-rich bithienyl ring (2.55 eV).23MP4 with a planar conjugation segment 4,7-di-2′-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as a core component shows a bandgap value of about 1.85 eV.29 The absorption spectrum of this deep purple colored polymer is dominated by a strong band peaking at 554 nm which shows a more extended absorption as compared to MP1. The lowest energy singlet excited state is found to be confined to a single repeat unit in the polymer chain. The triplet state is believed to be not involved in the photoinduced charge separation for the energy conversion, but mostly a charge transfer excited state plays the role instead, which is different from the case of MP1 based blends with higher bandgaps. In the photovoltaic device with MP4, the Voc, Jsc and FF obtained for the best cell are 0.82 V, 15.43 mA cm−2 and 0.39, respectively, resulting in a peak η of 4.93%. The high performance of the MP4 based device is attributed to the balanced charge mobilities between electrons and holes of MP4/PCBM blends. Detailed studies have been carried out for the performance comparison between MP4 and its metal-free polymeric counterpart.30MP4 exhibits an improved absorption in the visible spectral range as well as better film morphology as compared to the metal-free one, resulting in the enhancement of photovoltaic performance after the inclusion of metal ions in the polymer chain. The film of MP4 exhibits significant roughness, which is proposed to affect the photovoltaic efficiency due to the enhancement of charge collection because of the increased area in contact with the electrode, one of the significant factors that affect the photovoltaic performance.29 Further investigation is required to find out the effect of metal incorporation on thin film surface engineering.
After the development of photovoltaic applications by MP4, numerous narrow bandgap polyynes have been reported. Pt(II) polyyne MP5 functionalized with a push–pull 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene–benzothiadiazole hybrid spacer exhibits good thermal stability and possesses a very narrow bandgap of 1.76 eV.31 An η of 0.78% was indicated on the BHJSCs. Further improvement of the solubility and solution-processability of MP5 should result in further enhancement in the efficiency. By replacing the thiophene ring with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene group in MP4, a series of polymers MP6 were prepared by Jen et al.32 These polymers exhibit absorption maxima at 587–611 nm in the solid state, which are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor. All of them have similar bandgap values to MP4 and are in the range of 1.81–1.84 eV. The more structurally rigid unit in MP6-1 as compared to MP4 leads to a significant improvement of the hole mobility and the on/off ratio is improved from 6.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼102 to 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼104, respectively. Further enhancement in hole mobility to 1.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 is detected in MP6-2 and MP6-3 simply by the addition of alkyl chains. The best solar cell performance is based on the MP6-3:PC71BM blend with the highest hole mobility, which results in a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 10.12 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.51 and an η of 4.13%.

  To extend the absorption wavelength and enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character, two terminal electron-donating triphenylamine groups as the π-conjugated spacers were introduced into MP7.33 Due to the presence of extra thiophene rings in MP7-2, it covers a wider range of absorption bands between 300–700 nm with a correspondingly lower HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.85 eV as compared to MP7-1 (bandgap = 2.06 eV). The expansion of π-electron conjugation is crucial for increasing the solar absorption cross-section and the highest η of 1.61% is achieved for MP7-2 with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 4.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.39 in a 1:4 blend ratio with PCBM. Changing the nature of the electron acceptor group in MP4 by dioctyloxyphenyl-substituted thienopyrazine, MP8 possesses a very low bandgap of 1.5 eV with the absorption coverage extending towards the near-infrared (NIR) range of the solar spectrum.34 This polymer represents one of the lowest optical bandgaps reported for metallopolyynes. Due to the heteroaromatic ring in MP8, a strong internal D–A interaction is already present, and this polymer gives an absorption maximum of 655 nm in solution. The EQE responses of MP8 based solar cells are similar to their absorption spectra, which demonstrates that the excitons produced by absorption are dissociated into charge carriers at the contact between MP8 and PCBM in the active layer, and are subsequently collected at the electrodes. The Voc obtained for the best cell is 0.52 V with Jsc = 2.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.31, resulting in an η of 0.46%. It is suggested that the ligand based π–π* excited state is involved, leading to the photoinduced charge separation in the energy conversion for MP8. The relatively low values of photovoltaic parameters are partly due to the fact that all processing and measurements have been performed under an ambient atmosphere which likely results in the presence of traps.

  Polymers MP9-1 and MP9-2 functionalized with a weakly electron-donating fluorene unit and two strong electron acceptors, benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (TDBDPz), respectively, were reported for NIR photovoltaic applications.35 These metallopolymers possess narrow bandgaps of 1.54 and 1.65 eV and a low HOMO level of about 5.50 eV. Since the BBTD type unit is known to possess substantial quinoidal character within a conjugated backbone, it allows for greater electron delocalization. An anticipated red-shift of the long-wavelength peak (by ca. 29 nm) is observed by increasing the acceptor strength of the acceptor unit from MP9-2 to MP9-1 using BBTD. The bands in the NIR region give rise to strong ICT absorption in these polymers. The BHJSC device based on MP9-1 gives a maximum η of 1%. Polymers MP10 with the thienopyrazine–thiophene hybrid spacer also possess extremely low bandgaps of 1.47–1.50 eV.36 This D–A approach succeeds in achieving a broad absorption in the 300–900 nm region. MP10-2 with alkylated thiophenes show a further red shift in absorption as compared to MP10-1, and the lowest energy absorption bands are centered at 656 and 694 nm, respectively, for MP10-1 and MP10-2. The EQE curves of both solar cell devices show the onset near 850 nm with the maxima of EQE values of 26.3 and 48.6%, respectively. A peak photocurrent density of 3.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.51 V and an η of 0.63% are recorded for MP10-2.

  A series of platinynes with D–A molecular structures MP11-1–MP11-3 and random copolymers MP11-4–MP11-9 with two different acceptor building blocks were reported by Jenekhe and co-workers.37 These polymers share the same architecture of alternating D–A–D and Pt ions, with a fixed 2,5-thienylene donor and varying electron acceptors. All these polymers exhibit strong and broad ICT absorption bands that are extended to the NIR region and have tunable optical bandgaps in the range of 1.49–1.97 eV. Their photophysical properties are tunable by increasing the acceptor strength, and red-shifted absorption bands can be observed. Therefore, by changing the electron acceptor from 2,3-diheptylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine in MP11-3 and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in MP4 to thieno[3,4-b]pyrazines in MP10-1, MP11-1 and MP11-2, a gradual red shift of the ICT absorption band occurs that results in peak maxima ranging from 532 to 655 nm. A similar phenomenon is observed in their copolymer counterparts. The absorption spectra of these copolymers at a given composition ratio of its constituent repeating units can be predicted and tailored to cover the whole range of the visible wavelength region. The absorption bands are a result of individual monomers and the relative absorption intensity of different bands is tuned by changing the composition ratio of two D–A–D repeating units. Although this approach broadens the absorption coverage, the improved light harvesting does not translate into improved photovoltaic properties. The highest efficiency of the solar cell among polymers MP11 refers to the copolymer MP11-9, which gives an η of 0.71%.
Wong et al. demonstrated the effect of the number of thienyl rings in platinynes MP12 on the absorption, charge transportation and solar cell efficiency.38 It can be clearly observed that the enhancement of the absorption coefficient and bandgap reduction tuning by increasing the conjugation length of the chain with more thienyl rings is a good strategy. Due to the presence of a more extended π-electron delocalized system through the rigid chain and the creation of an alternate D–A chromophore based on a highly electron-accepting bithiazole ring in combination with electron-donating thiophene rings, the bandgaps of MP12 vary from 2.40 to 2.06 eV. The bandgap value for the red colored MP12-4 is significantly reduced by ca. 0.34 eV relative to the yellow MP12-1. However, the extent of red shift induced by increasing the number of thiophene rings is less pronounced, and there would be little benefit in the further extension of π-conjugation up to a certain limit. A charge-transfer excited state is mainly recognized for the efficient photoinduced charge separation in the energy conversion for MP12. BHJSCs are fabricated by using each of MP12. A considerable increase in the Jsc and η is detected in MP12-3 and MP12-4 relative to MP12-1 and MP12-2. From space-charge-limited current (SCLC) modeling results, the increase in the number of rings results in an increase of intrachain mobility (of the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) for MP12-3 and MP12-4 while the mobility values for MP12-1 and MP12-2 are somewhat lower. Thus, not only the optical but also charge transporting properties can be tuned by changing the length of oligothienyl chains. A relatively high η of up to 2.50–2.66% and broad EQE curves which cover almost the entire visible spectrum from 350 to 700 nm with a maximum of 81.3 and 59.3%, respectively, can be obtained for MP12-3 and MP12-4. This work presents an effective method for the tuning of solar cell efficiency and charge transporting properties for the development of polymer based solar power generation. Polymers MP13 with a cyclopentadithiophenone ring give narrow bandgaps of 1.53 and 1.44 eV for blue MP13-1 and green MP13-239 with the lowest energy absorption bands peaking at 641 and 653 nm, respectively. Absorption data indicate that the CO group is effectively conjugated with the bithiophene in MP13-1 and quaterthiophene in MP13-2 and gives rise to substantially red-shifted absorption maxima. Devices based on both polymers exhibit broad photocurrent spectral responsivity and their spectral responses are up to the NIR regime. Between these two polymers, MP13-2 exhibits improved stability and solar cell performance. The Voc obtained for the best cell is 0.68 V, with a Jsc of 3.15 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.34, resulting in an η of 0.74%. Anthraquinone, which possesses two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups forming its core structure, makes it an electron deficient organic moiety. Therefore, in MP14, by incorporating the 9,10-anthraquinone moiety into the Pt(II) polymer backbone, strong absorption in both the near UV and visible regions due to the presence of an extended π-electron delocalized system is observed.40 The absorption spectra of MP14-1 and MP14-2 are each characterized by strong near-UV intraligand π–π* bands below 400 nm with another low-lying ICT band near 468 and 529 nm, respectively. Their LUMO levels are similar, but the HOMO levels tend to be elevated upon incorporating thiophene rings from MP14-1 (−6.06 eV) to MP14-2 (−5.96 eV), which is in agreement with their absorption profiles. Inclusion of thiophene fragments into the anthraquinone unit further extends the spectral width of absorption appropriate for sunlight harvesting in MP14-2, which in turn can raise the efficiency of its solar cells from 0.02% to 0.35%. Biological studies also suggest the safe exploitation of these two polymers in solar cell applications. By tuning the bandgaps of the Pt(II) polymers with phenanthrenyl-imidazole chromophore by inserting thiophene rings, optical bandgap values of 2.34 and 2.28 eV are detected for MP15-1 and MP15-2, respectively.41 Presumably, a higher degree of conjugation with the additional thienyl units reduces the bandgap. However, unlike other platinynes, MP15-2 shows a slightly blue shifted absorption band as compared with that of MP15-1 (466 nm for MP15-1; 459 nm for MP15-2). This may be speculated by the lower molecular weight and low degree of polymerization in MP15-2, which results in the blue-shifted absorption band. The higher η is obtained in the device using MP15-2:PCBM (1:4) as the active layer with a Voc of 0.53 V, a Jsc of 2.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.28, while the device based on MP15-1/PCBM (1:4) shows an η of 0.28% under the same fabrication conditions. This is mainly attributed to the strengthening of the ICT effect by the enhancement of the electron-donating ability between donor and acceptor units that results in the higher Jsc for MP15-2, and the value is almost double that of MP15-1. These results suggest that the addition of the thiophene unit in MP15-2 gives rise to a more rapid charge transfer from the polymeric main chain to the electron-withdrawing phenanthrenyl-imidazole-tethered side chains and then to PCBM.

  In 2011, Wong and co-workers firstly reported the usage of Pt(II) acetylide polymers MP16 of higher dimensionality for organic solar cell applications.42 Unlike the D–A–D linear polymers mentioned above, the absorption bands of these polymers are dominated by an intense ligand-centered π–π* transition. MP16-1 and MP16-2 show similarly structured broad absorption bands spanning around 300–460 nm whereas MP16-3 shows the spectral absorption band between 315 and 480 nm. MP16-3 with fluorene as the conjugated congener shows the highest absorption coefficient of 1.59 × 105 cm−1 among MP16, while MP16-2 has a higher value than MP16-1. The gain in the absorption coefficient of MP16-2 as compared to the linear polymer MP16-1 reveals that the strategy of increasing molecular dimensionality is an effective way to enhance the light harvesting ability of the polyplatinynes and hence the η value. The three-dimensional (3D) polymers exhibit a 2–4 times larger η than the linear one (η = 0.88, 1.67 and 2.24% for MP16-1 to MP16-3, respectively). This improvement has been attributed to the random orientation of the conjugated segments in films of the 3D compounds, which allows a better absorption of the incident light as compared to the vertically oriented chains of the linear molecule. However, low FF values have been realized for all the polymers, which are characterized by a pronounced voltage-dependent photocurrent. This characteristic is likely to arise from the imbalanced charge transport across the device which is limited by the low hole mobilities of the polymers. Although these polymers have relatively high bandgaps (2.59–2.72 eV) and narrow absorption bands in the solar spectrum, a high η of 2.24% is obtained for the blended polymer PM16-2. Further improvement of the device performance may be achieved by designing other low bandgap 3D polymers with a more conjugated branched architecture in order to harvest more sunlight.
Porphyrins contain an extensively conjugated two-dimensional π-system which renders them suitable for light harvesting and efficient electron transfer. Moreover, porphyrin has rich and extensive optical absorption in the visible spectrum and high mobility, making them a good candidate as the photoactive layer for organic solar cell application.43,44 Wong's group reported the application of metalloporphyrin-containing polyplatinyne polymers MP17 for BHJSCs solar cells.45 Typical absorption profiles for porphyrin-type compounds are observed for all these polymers, which show a sharp and strong Soret band at about 430 nm and a set of weak Q bands between 540 and 635 nm. This type of polymers does not exhibit significant π-conjugation because the large aryl-porphyrin dihedral angles, which result from steric interactions with the β-hydrogens, lead to the non-planarity. A comparison between MP17-1 and MP17-3 indicates a more red-shifted Soret band and Q-bands by 10–15 nm for the latter, witnessing the substituent effect of the thiophene residue onto the π–π*-type transitions of the Zn(II) porphyrin unit. This effect may also be ascribed to the better dihedral angle between the average plane for the thiophene versus the metalloporphyrin one in MP17-3, in comparison with the planes between the phenyl versus metalloporphyrin ring in MP17-1. The photophysical features of MP17-2 are similar to those for the MP17-1 one since the immediate substituent around the central zinc porphyrin chromophore is the same in both polymers. The optical bandgaps for these polymers vary from 1.93 to 2.02 eV, and the lower bandgap in MP17-2 than in MP17-1 somewhat favors the harvesting of more solar photon energy. Because of the stronger absorption features with a broader Soret band and stronger Q-bands in MP17-3, the solar cell based on it exhibits the highest η of 1.04% resulting from a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 3.42 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.39. Although this η represents the highest value reported so far for BHJSCs based on the porphyrin-containing metallopolymers, efforts are needed to further improve the photon to electricity conversion efficiency for practical application.

  In contrast to the platinum(II) metallopolyynes, Fréchet and co-workers designed and synthesized two cyclometalated platinum polymers MP18-1 and MP18-2 to study the effect of the platinum center on excitons. These two structures contain a 2-(2′-thienyl)thiazole C^N ligand and an O^O diketonate ligand and the platinum atom is peripheral to the conjugated backbone with a coplanar conformation. Due to the superior overlap with the solar spectrum, photovoltaic devices fabricated from the MP18-1:PCBM blend can yield a higher η of 1.29%.46 Conjugated polymers MP18-3 and MP18-4 bearing indacenodithiophene and cyclometalated Pt(II) units were reported by Chou and Cheng for organometallic photovoltaic studies.47 In these polymers, Pt(II) ions are coordinated by a common bidentate acetylacetonate ligand and further cyclometalated with the 2-(thien-2-yl)pyridine and 1-(thien-2-yl)isoquinoline moieties in the conjugated backbone. The optical gaps of MP18-3 and MP18-4 determined from their onsets of absorption are 1.96 and 1.82 eV, respectively. The smaller values of the energy gap in MP18 should improve light harvesting and enhance the photocurrent of the device as compared to their Pt(II) free polymers, and therefore the absorptions of MP18-3 (λmax = 567 nm) and MP18-4 (λmax = 580 nm) undergo large bathochromic shifts of around 80–90 nm relative to the organic counterparts. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the singlet state of these polymers to their charge separated state is more favorable, and the triplet energy states of MP18-3 and MP18-4 are too low in energy for PET with PCBM. Their photovoltaic results clearly show the importance of introducing Pt(II) complexes into the polymer system. The Jsc of the device based on MP18-3 (6.10 mA cm−2) is two times that of the device made of its organic polymeric analogue. The superior device performance of the MP18-3-based device (η = 2.4%) is partly the result of its better light harvesting ability, better morphology and possession of nano-scale phase separation. A poor η of 1.7% is measured for MP18-4, which may be due to the large dihedral angle between 1-(thien-2-yl)isoquinoline and 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene, causing weaker intermolecular interactions and therefore lower mobility and lower current density. Upon optimizing the blend ratio of MP18-3 and PC71BM, the highest η of 2.9% with the values of Jsc, Voc and FF of 7.7 mA cm−2, 0.78 V and 0.48, respectively, is achieved. The results suggest that the higher performance of these Pt-containing polymers is not attributed to the triplet state contribution but is mainly due to the significantly red-shifted absorption bands of the Pt-containing polymers, resulting in superior overlap with the solar spectrum. However, the negative effect from the large dihedral angles should not be neglected.
Re(I)-based polymers for BHJSCs
The chemistry and photophysics of chlorotricarbonyl Re(I) diamine complexes have been studied extensively. These complexes possess relatively long-lived excited states which are of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character.48,49 Compared to molecular Re(I) complexes, polymeric systems enjoy the advantages of better processability and being able to form optical quality thin films easily by the spin casting technique. The excited state properties of these polymers can be fine-tuned by adjusting their metal content or by modifying the π-conjugated main chain and/or ligands coordinated to the metal center. Upon the introduction of the Re(I) complex moiety into the backbone of the polymer, the bandgap of the polymer can be significantly reduced, which makes these metal-containing polymers more promising photosensitizers for photovoltaic cells. Chan and co-workers reported the use of polymers MP19 as single and three-layered photovoltaic devices.50 The relative intensity between π–π* and MLCT absorption bands can be altered by adjusting the metal content within the polymers. In MP19-1, the MLCT transition from the Re(I) complex moiety only appears as a shoulder at 520 nm but is dominated by the π–π* band. With a higher metal content, polymers MP19-2 and MP19-3 show more intense MLCT bands and the π–π* transition becomes more obvious. The films by casting the solution of these polymers on ITO coated glass slides with a gold electrode are examined and photocurrent responses are detected upon irradiation. The higher metal content in MP19-2 results in higher quantum efficiency as compared with MP19-1. However, due to the presence of a large amount of Re(I) complex on the main chain, the effective conjugation length in the polymer is shortened, which subsequently affects the charge transport properties of the polymer MP19-3, and leads to a lower quantum yield as compared to MP19-2. The η values of the three-layered photovoltaic devices follow the following order: MP19-2 (η = 0.061%) > MP19-1 (η = 0.045%) > MP19-3 (η = 0.012%). The same explanations can be applied to those described in their single layer devices. Photovoltaic studies of the hyperbranched polymer MP20 have been carried out by fabricating multilayer thin films of MP20 with an ionic polymer by the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition process in a device structure of ITO/MP20/ionic polymer/Al.51 The advantages of using this method include highly accurate control of the thickness of ultrathin polymer film while keeping the loss of materials to a minimum during processing. It is envisaged that upon photoexcitation of MP20, excitons are formed and separated in the presence of an internal field. The photocurrent responses of the devices suggest that the photosensitization process occurs between the junction of MP20 and the ionic polymer. All the MP20-based devices exhibit η of the order of 10−3% with similar FF values. A low bandgap Re(I) complex with an absorption onset at 795 nm is tethered onto the π-conjugated polymer to form MP21.52 The electronic properties of the conjugated polymer are therefore tuned to a large extent and the ICT transition band exhibited a significant red shift from 555 to 633 nm upon metal chelation. The shift is attributed to the increase in electron delocalization from the thienopyrazine unit to the pyridine unit, which is forced to be coplanar with the thienopyrazine upon metal coordination. The coordination of the Re(I) complex into the conjugated polymer lowers the LUMO level to −3.64 eV from −3.25 eV, but only slightly affects the HOMO level. The bandgap of MP20 is detected to be 1.61 eV, which is in good agreement with the optical gap of its thin film. BHJSCs fabricated by using the MP21:PCBM blend show the best performance of η = 0.03% with a Jsc of 0.13 mA cm−2. The relatively low η may be due to the poor absorption coefficient of the charge transfer transition in the visible range as compared with the fully allowed π–π* transition in the UV region. Thus, the inadequate light harvesting limits the charge generation and hence lowers the η of the devices. Poor mixing of the polymer with PCBM may also account for the low current density of the devices. A similar strategy is adopted to reduce the bandgaps of conjugated polymers MP22.53MP22-2 shows absorption at a longer wavelength than MP22-1 by replacing the fluorene monomer with its heterocyclic analogue, cyclopentadithiophene, and their ICT absorption band is located at 740 and 810 nm, respectively, for MP22-1 and MP22-2. However, the absorption intensity of the ICT transition significantly decreases upon metal coordination. This may be attributed to the effect arising from the lowering of electron density of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine. Very low bandgaps of 1.31 and 1.17 eV are examined for MP22-1 and MP22-2, respectively. The coordination of the metal fragment not only extends the absorption coverage, but also improves the hole mobility and hence the charge transfer properties of the polymers. The hole mobility of MP22-1 is in the range of 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is one order of magnitude higher than that of its organic counterpart. Due to the trade-off between mobility and absorptivity, even the hole mobility of MP22-1 is higher than its organic congener, and the overall η of the solar cells decreases. Its η is only 0.03%. Modification of the polymerizable ligand is necessary in order to retain the absorption intensity after metal coordination.  
Ruthenium(II)-containing polymers for BHJSCs
Terpyridyl Ru(II) complexes have attracted the attention of researchers to use them in the application of photovoltaic cells. In particular, the insertion of Ru(II) metals into conjugated backbones has several advantages, which include facilitating the charge generation by extending its absorption range resulting from its characteristic long-lived MLCT, enhancing the photosensitivity in the visible region, easy processability, high thermal stability and the possibility of exhibiting a reversible Ru(II/III) redox process.54MP23 with a Ru(II) terpyridine complex reported by Chan et al. exhibited an intense absorption band at 507 nm in its thin film with a high absorption coefficient of 31000 L mol−1 cm−1.55 Due to the orthogonal geometry between the two terpyridine ligands, the π-conjugated system on the polymer chain is disrupted, which results in the absence of an observable π–π* absorption band at 450 nm and moderate hole and electron carrier mobilities of the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Photovoltaic cells with the device structure ITO/(MP23/SPAN)n/Al were fabricated (SPAN = sulfonated polyaniline) by the LBL deposition process. The η value is of the order of 10−3% and the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is 2% at 510 nm. Although the η is low, this work demonstrates the feasibility of employing a simpler method to fabricate solar cells by the relatively low-cost solution processing method with high accuracy in thickness control in order to match the exciton diffusion length, which is difficult to achieve by the conventional spin-coating process. Lin reported a series of Ru(II) metallopolymers MP24 bearing various benzodiazole cores.54 The introduction of electron donor–acceptor structures into the cores of bis-terpyridyl ligands is expected to obtain a higher Voc value and a more favorable overlap of the absorption spectra from both the active layer and the solar emission spectrum. In all cases, the acceptor moieties are sandwiched between thiophene units, resulting in more planar structures to facilitate interchain association and strong ICT interactions between the thiophene donor and the benzodiazole acceptor, so their absorption spectra cover a broad range (260–750 nm). Due to the larger size and smaller electronegativity of the selenium atom in MP24-2 as compared to those with sulfur and oxygen in benzodiazole acceptors, MP24-2 shows the most pronounced bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum and thereby a smaller optical bandgap (1.63 eV) than the other two (1.74 eV for MP24-1; 1.73 eV for MP24-3). The different electron deficient central units have almost no effect on their oxidation potentials (0.76–0.77 V), but the LUMO levels are clearly affected. A stronger electron-deficient unit results in a lower LUMO energy level (LUMO: −3.56 eV for MP24-1; −3.62 eV for MP24-2; −3.58 eV for MP24-3). Solar cells with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MP24:PCBM/Ca/Al were fabricated. With similar values of Voc (0.42–0.61 V) and FF (0.30–0.34), it is evident that the variations of η values in MP24-based devices mainly depend on the Jsc values (2.18, 1.14 and 1.14 mA cm−2, respectively). The device derived from MP24-1 exhibits the highest η value of 0.45%, and its highest Jsc of 2.18 mA cm−2 could be explained by its higher EQE value at the long wavelength region (ca. 600 nm). Similar Ru(II) polymers MP25 with cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]thiophene and thiophene as donor units and benzothiadiazole (BT) or fluorinated BT as the acceptor unit at the cores of bis-terpyridyl ligands were prepared by Peng.56 The fluorine atoms exert a positive effect on the HOMO level, bandgap, hole mobility as well as phase separation in thin films. The F⋯H, F⋯S and/or F⋯F interactions induced in MP25-2 form stronger stacking, which could result in a higher carrier mobility and better photovoltaic performance in the devices. The best η of 2.66% can be obtained from the MP25-2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 7.12 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51. A relatively lower η of 1.99% has been determined for the corresponding non-fluorinated polymer MP25-1 based cells. The incorporation of donor-substituted bis-terpyridine with acceptor-substituted bis-terpyridine via Ru(II) ions affords the main chain metallopolymers MP26. Their polymer thin films give strong absorption stemming from the overlap of both ICT and MLCT bands located at 560 and 565 nm, respectively, for MP26-1 and MP26-2. The optical bandgaps are strongly influenced by the nature of π-conjugated spacer units, resulting in a lower bandgap in MP26-2 (1.76 eV) as compared to MP26-1 (1.82 eV). The η values of MP26-1 and MP26-2 derived devices are found to be 0.57% and 0.9% with a Voc of 0.66 and 0.7 V, respectively. The higher Voc in the MP26-2 based device could be explained by the lower HOMO energy level of MP26-2 (−5.19 eV) as compared to that of MP26-1 (−5.15 eV). This may be attributed to the presence of a stronger donor unit of carbazole in MP26-2 as compared to the fluorene unit in MP26-1. The higher EQE value at around 600 nm is the main reason for the higher Jsc value and consequently better performance of the cell containing MP26-2.57

  To improve the spectral match between solar light and the absorption of the photosensitizing material, two different light absorbing units are incorporated into a single polymer chain in MP27-1 and MP27-2.58 In these polymers, the π-conjugated main chain absorbs photons of higher energy (2–3 eV), while the Ru(II) dye absorbs photons of lower energy (1.5–2 eV). These polymers exhibit very broad absorption bands spanning 400–750 nm with an enhancement of the optical absorption which enables the utilization of solar light in the NIR region. Heterojunction photovoltaic cells with the simple device structure ITO/polymer/PC60BM/Al were fabricated by spin-coating the polymer solutions of MP27-1 and MP27-2. Under simulated AM1.5 solar light illumination, the Jsc, Voc and η were measured to be 1.53–2.58 mA cm−2, 0.12–0.24 V and 0.084–0.12%, respectively. Plots of IPCE as a function of wavelength suggest that absorption by both the conjugated main chain and the Ru(II) complex are essential to photocurrent generation.  
Other metallopolymers for BHJSCs
Besides Pt(II), Re(I) and Ru(II), conjugated polymers bearing other metal ions as active materials in solar cells are also an area of increasing interest. The effect of tethering an Ir(III) complex to the main chain of a conjugated polymer (MP28) has been examined by Holdcroft and co-workers.59 The absorption band at 385 nm and the longer absorption tail between 400 and 450 nm observed in MP28 are due to the absorption of the poly(fluorene-co-phenylpyridine) main chain and Ir(III) complex, respectively. The formation of the triplet state and the increase of diffusion length of the triplet exciton govern the photovoltaic response, and the η of MP28 is 0.07%. The planarity and S⋯S interaction of fused thiophenes have been found to promote highly ordered π-stacked structures and high hole mobilities. The introduction of dithienothiophene (DTT) and diethynyldithienothiophene into the Zn(II) porphyrin polymer main chain (MP29) can reduce steric hindrance, extend conjugation, enhance absorption, and improve charge transport properties.60 The Soret band and Q-bands of the triple-bond linked porphyrin–DTT polymer MP29-2 show a red shift of ca. 28 and 94 nm, respectively; the Q-bands are broader and stronger compared to that of the single-bond linked counterpart MP29-1. In MP29-1, steric hindrance between directly linked porphyrin and DTT units leads to a twisted main chain and limited conjugation; while in polymer MP29-2, the triple-bond linker between porphyrin and DTT units reduces the steric hindrance and, therefore, promotes coplanarity and extended π-conjugation. An η of 0.3% can be achieved for the BHJSCs using the MP29-2:PCBM (1:3, w/w) blend as the active layer and the value is double that based on MP29-1:PCBM (1:2, w/w). The data are consistent with those for MP29-2 exhibiting stronger Q-band absorption and higher mobility at room temperature.  
Metallopolymers for DSSCs
Besides BHJSCs, polymeric metal complexes have also been studied in DSSCs. In comparison to Ru(II) complexes that are commonly used for DSSCs, these polymers exhibit many advantages, such as diverse molecular structures, high molar extinction coefficients, etc. Zhong reported the design of four D–A dyes with the same Cd(II) complex in the side chain as the electron acceptor but with different conjugated backbones containing fluorene, alkoxybenzene or carbazole as the electron donor (MP30).61 The nature of the conjugated backbone can effectively change the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers. Their absorption spectra exhibit similar curves to the peak maximum located at 397, 389, 411 and 419 nm, respectively, corresponding to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated compartment. The higher energy bandgap in MP30-2 as compared to MP30-1 is mainly due to the steric effect in the former. The lowest bandgap is recorded for MP30-3 (2.30 eV) among these polymers, which leads to more effective light absorption. Therefore, MP30-3 based DSSCs furnish an η of 0.56% with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 1.63 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.50. The η of devices based on MP30-1, MP30-2 and MP30-4 are 0.34, 0.29 and 0.23%, respectively. Here, fluorene may be a more suitable donor unit in designing a photosensitizer for DSSCs. Polymers MP31 containing Co(II) or Ni(II) complexes with a D–π-A architecture have been demonstrated by the same research team.62 Unlike MP30, an additional MLCT band is detected as the shoulder with an absorption tail extending beyond 600 nm for MP31. The stronger electron-donating ability of fluorene in MP31-1 and MP31-3 results in intense peaks at around 462–492 nm in their absorption spectra compared to those of the other two polymers. The bandgaps of MP31 (2.17–2.29 eV) are lower than those of MP30. The η of 1.21% for devices based on MP31-4 is higher than those of devices based on MP31-1 (0.96%), MP31-2 (1.01%) and MP31-3 (1.00%), which is caused by the highest Voc (0.69 V) and Jsc (2.49 mA cm−2) of MP31-4 compared to the other three dyes. This is probably due to the fact that the d8 Ni(II) complex possesses higher kinetic stability than the d7 Co(II) complex, and the alkoxybenzene unit is more conducive for the generation of photocurrent than the octylfluorene unit. All the Jsc values are low which can be ascribed to the low charge separation, the low transportation efficiency and the weak adsorption ability onto the surface of TiO2. Anchoring groups should be introduced to improve the electron-donating ability of these polymers and hence enhance the performance of DSSCs. By using 3,6-carbazole as the conjugated backbone in the polymers MP32 that contain complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline with Zn(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II), MLCT or d–d transition that overlaps with the π–π* transition in the range of 400–480 nm can be detected in the absorption spectra.63 The resulting DSSCs exhibit an η up to 0.44% in MP32-2. Again, the nature of the metal ions has a significant influence on the η of DSSCs. Low spin d8 Ni(II) polymer results in poorer DSSC performance compared to that of d10 Zn(II) and Cd(II) based polymeric complexes.

  Metallopolymers MP33–MP34 based on polycarbazole with complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline in the backbone are also useful for DSSCs.64,65 These photosensitizers with D–π-A structures use polycarbazole as a donor, a CN electron-withdrawing spacer as the π-bridge and a complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline with Zn(II), Ni(II) or Cd(II) as an acceptor. MP33-1 and MP33-2 have two absorption bands centered at about 350–374 and 427–447 nm. The absorption maximum of MP33-1 is significantly red-shifted by 20 nm relative to that of MP33-2, which may be due to the fact that the d10 Zn(II) ion has more electrons than the d8 Ni(II) ion, so that the π–π* transition can take place more easily. The higher absorbance and broader absorption coverage of MP33-1 lead to a higher Jsc value of its DSSC device. The MP33-1 sensitized cell gives a Jsc of 2.52 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V and a FF of 0.58 with the corresponding η of 1.11%, which is two times higher than that of the device based on MP33-2 (η = 0.45%). For MP34, similar absorption profiles to those of MP33 have been recorded. In their photovoltaic response, the η of MP34-3 (2.45%) based devices is higher than those of the devices based on MP34-1 (2.17%), MP34-2 (2.04%) and MP34-4 (2.18%). The better solar cell performance of MP34-3 could be attributed to its higher degree of polymerization which leads to the longest conjugated length. The radius of Cd(II) is larger than that of Zn(II), so the energy level of MP34-3 is the lowest among MP34, further leading to the red-shifted absorption peaks in MP34-3. By using metal 1,10-phenanthroline complexes in the main chain for the conjugated polymers MP35, the highest η of 0.74% was measured for MP35-3.66 The influence of the donor unit on the Jsc is greater than that of the metal in this case as the nature of the donor affects the HOMO level of the polymers greatly. The relatively narrow energy gap and higher ease of electronic excitation in MP35-1 and MP35-3 than those of MP35-2 and MP35-4 lead to higher η values of MP35-1 (0.63%) and MP35-3 (0.74%) than those of MP35-2 (0.54%) and MP35-4 (0.57%).  
Metallopolymers for energy-conserving lighting sources
White polymer light-emitting diodes (WPLEDs) are attracting considerable attention. They hold great promise in the applications of full color displays with color filters and lighting sources. WPLEDs can be easily fabricated using wet processes, including the spin-coating, screen printing, and ink-jet printing techniques, which are expected to be lower in cost in mass production. One of the strategies to obtain white light emission is using devices based on a single-component polymeric material, which have advantages, such as a better control of the doping level of long-wavelength light-emitting materials and a higher ease of getting balanced white-light emission than for devices made with polymer blends or small molecule doped polymer systems.67,68 In the past two decades, studies in this field have attracted growing interest and encouraging progress has been made. Most of them are based on single chain polymers embedded with the Ir(III) complex as the triplet-emitting species because of its high quantum efficiency caused by strong spin–orbit coupling of the heavy-metal Ir(III) ions. Yang and Cao have realized efficient white-light emission from a single polymer, which simultaneously consists of fluorescence- and phosphorescence-emitting species.69 By introducing a small number of green-light emitting BT into the blue-light-emitting polyfluorene backbone and by attaching a small number of iridium complexes as triplet red emitters onto the side chain, simultaneous white-light emission can be obtained based on polymers MP36. The spectra of all the copolymers are wide, covering the whole visible range from 400 to 700 nm. The peaks at 425, 450 and 485 nm are attributed to the emission of the fluorene unit, the peak at 520 nm due to the BT unit, and the peak at 580 nm from the iridium complex. The PLED devices were fabricated with the configuration ITO/PEDOT/poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK)/copolymer/CsF/Al. By changing the content of the BT and/or iridium complex, the EL spectra can be readily adjusted. Although the device based on MP36-4 gives the highest luminance efficiency (ηL) of 6.1 cd A−1, its color is a little green. Devices fabricated from MP36-2 and MP36-3 emit white light with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.33) and (0.32, 0.33), respectively, which are very close to the pure white-light point of (0.33, 0.33). The WPLEDs based on MP36-6 and MP36-8 show a high ηL of 4.7 and 4.6 cd A−1 with CIE coordinates of (0.38, 0.35) and (0.31, 0.34), respectively. Binary copolymers MP37 with only red-emitting iridium complexes attached to the side chain of polyfluorene were synthesized by the same research group.70 All their PL spectra possess two emission bands (440 and 580 nm), indicating that partial energy transfer from the fluorene segment to the Ir(III) unit takes place, which is different from the case of MP36, with energy transfer from fluorene to BT. Poorer performance is detected for MP37-based WPLEDs compared to those fabricated with MP36. This is ascribed to the exciton confinement of the BT unit, which allows efficient singlet energy transfer from the fluorene segment to the BT unit and avoids the triplet quenching resulting from the higher triplet energy levels of phosphorescent green emitters than that of polyfluorene. Pure white light emission of CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.32) can be obtained for MP37-3 with a maximum ηL of 3.2 cd A−1 and a maximum luminance (L) of 4105 cd m−2.

  A series of white-light-emitting polymers MP38 consisting of blue fluorescent polyfluorene that is covalently attached to a small amount of orange phosphorescent Ir complex at the side chains have been developed.71 Due to the extended π-conjugation in the cyclometalating ligand in MP38, the peak due to the Ir(III) fragment is red-shifted in their PL spectra (λPL = 440, 590 nm) as compared to MP36 and MP37. Orange emissions in MP38-1–MP38-3 are stronger than those in MP38-4–MP38-6 at the same doping level. The best result is based on the device with MP38-1, with a maximum ηL of 4.49 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (ηP) of 2.35 lm W−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.46, 0.33). The CIE coordinates can be tuned to (0.34, 0.33) by using MP38-4 as the emissive layer and are very close to those of standard white light. However, the maximum ηL and ηP decreased to 0.81 cd A−1 and 0.42 lm W−1, with the maximum luminance (L) of only 989 cd m−2. The reduction of the efficiency may be attributed to the high triplet energy level of MP38-4, which results in more effective phosphorescence quenching by energy transfer from the Ir(III) complex segment to polyfluorene triplet states.

  By incorporating two different colored phosphorescent Ir(III) emitters (green-blue and red emissive pendant heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes randomly into each different block), the block-copolymer system MP39 can deliver site isolation of the two emitters to suppress energy transfer from blue to red emitters, which normally provides improved white color balance and efficiency of the resulting WPLEDs.72 These polymers have been used as the single active layer in a device with no additional material between the anode and the cathode. The device made from the phase separated copolymer MP39-3 thin film is three times brighter with a lower turn-on voltage (Von) than those devices made from copolymers MP39-1 and MP39-2. MP39-3 with a higher content of the blue emitter shows markedly better EQE (>1.5%) for white emission than the lower molecular weight (MW) polymers MP39-1 (EQE ∼ 0.3%) and MP39-2 (EQE ∼ 0.4%). This is mainly attributed to the minimization of blue emission loss by suppressing unnecessary energy transfer to the red dopant. This molecular approach may be extended to other WPLED systems to improve their device efficiency and should be versatile and broadly applicable. By employing MP40, with charge transporting triphenylamine and oxadiazole chromophores as pendant units and red phosphor as the side group in a single polyfluorene copolymer, balanced EL emissions of all the three primary colors are observed. The EL spectra cover the whole visible region with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 205 nm in its single emissive layer device.73 The CIE coordinates for the MP40-based device are (0.34, 0.38) with a color rendering index (CRI) value of 82. White light is emitted at a voltage as low as 2.8 V, which indicates its low power consumption. Maximum ηL and ηP of 8.2 cd A−1 and 7.2 lm W−1, respectively, were measured. The EL efficiency can be further improved if phosphors with higher triplet energies are covalently linked to a host polymer having a wide bandgap.

  The Ir(III) complex with 2-naphthalene-pyridine as the cyclometalating ligand emitting at 625 nm can be introduced into the polyfluorene backbone in MP41, and by adjusting the monomer feed ratios, broadband white emission from this single polymer is realized.74 The EL spectra of MP41 show three balanced blue, green and red emissions peaking at 420 and 440, 520 and 625 nm, respectively, and the overall emission is located very close to the ideal white point. The emission color of copolymers remains stable upon varying the applied voltage. The enhanced stability of the white emission of the single copolymer is obviously due to the sufficient isolation of green and red chromophores in the polyfluorene backbone. The pure WPLEDs based on MP41-1 give the maximum ηL and EQE of 4.4 cd A−1 and 2.2%, respectively, with a CRI value of 84. A better CRI value of 88 was achieved by using MP41-4 with an ηL of 5.3 cd A−1 and a maximum L of 9900 cd m−2, which represents good color quality for displays and solid-state lighting. These devices possess a fairly slow roll-off in efficiency loss, which can be attributed to the reduction of long radiative lifetime of triplet excited states via chemical modification and therefore, they should be promising candidates for solid-state lighting purpose. By using 2-(2′-benzothienyl)pyridine as the cyclometalating ligand in MP42, white emission is detected with the red emission further shifted bathochromically and located at 660 and 720 nm.75 More pure WPLEDs can be achieved based on MP42-2 and MP42-3. A better performance is realized for the former polymer with a maximum EQE of 3.7%, an ηL of 3.9 cd A−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.31, 0.32). The white light emission from this polymer is stable at all applied voltages, and the EL efficiencies only decline slightly with increasing current density. Thus, the approach of incorporating singlet- and triplet-emitting species into the polymer backbone is promising for high-performance WPLEDs. Hsu et al. developed new WPLEDs from the phosphorescent single polymer system MP43 by using a blue light emitting fluorene monomer copolymerized with a red light emitting phosphorescent dye and end-capped with a green light emission dye.76 The highest brightness in such a device is 300 cd m−2 at 16 V and a current density of 2900 A m−2. However, the saturation effect of the emission capability of the Ir(III) complex at higher current densities leads to changes in the CIE coordinates of the EL spectra, resulting in the loss of color purity when the bias is raised.

  By using fluorenone as the green fluorophore and the Ir(III) complex as the red phosphor on the main chain linked via an ancillary β-diketonate ligand, a series of single active layer WPLEDs based on MP44 were fabricated by Yang and Qin.77 Pure white light emission could be obtained by controlling the content of the blue emissive fluorene higher than 99.9 mol% while simultaneously keeping the green and red emitters well proportioned. CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.45), (0.30, 0.35), (0.28, 0.32) and (0.28, 0.32) are achieved for devices from MP44-1, MP44-2, MP44-3 and MP44-4, respectively. The device from MP44-1 exhibits a maximum ηL of 5.50 cd A−2 and a maximum L of 3361 cd m−2, while the device from MP44-3 shows a maximum ηL of 3.25 cd A−2 and a maximum L of 1015 cd m−2. The white light devices based on MP44-2–MP44-4 exhibit low Von at around 4.0 V, and their CIE coordinates are insensitive to the applied voltages. To control the monomer ratio more easily in order to realize white emission from a single polymer, MP45 without the use of green emission segments was reported.78 In particular, the EL device fabricated with MP45 is found to emit white light consisting of simultaneous blue and red emissions with CIE coordinates at (0.31, 0.32). However, poor EL device efficiencies are detected with the ηL at 0.05 cd A−1 only. Further improvement should be carried out by optimizing the film morphology, layer thickness and postproduction treatment conditions.  
Metallopolymers for energy storage
With the vigorous development and enrichment of electronic products, the recent popularity of portable devices such as cell phones and laptops has stimulated the urgent demand for advanced electricity storage techniques. Due to the superior performance of lithium-ion batteries as compared with lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries, they have been considered to be one of the most promising technologies in the future as demonstrated by their wide application in various kinds of mobile equipment during the past two decades.8 In the search for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with high power and energy density as well as stable charging–discharging performance, the cathode material is always the bottleneck.79 Owing to the inherent unique features of polymers including structural diversity, device flexibility, solution processability and performance adjustability, polymers for use as cathode materials of organic lithium batteries have been extensively studied.11,12 Ferrocene, which is well known for its good chemical stability, stable redox reversibility and rapid reaction kinetics, is a typical standard reference material widely used in electrochemical measurement.80–83 Therefore, studies on organometallic cathode materials have mostly focused on ferrocene-containing polymers.
A series of simple polymers, poly(vinylferrocene) MP46, poly(ethynylferrocene) MP47 and poly(ferrocene) MP48, were synthesized and fabricated as coin cells by Masuda et al. Although decent specific capacities of 105, 105 and 95 mA h g−1 can be obtained for MP46–MP48 based batteries, these polymeric cathode materials suffer from terrible capacity fading owing to their low molecular weights. It is interesting that MP46 shows a flatter charging–discharging plateau than the other two polymers. The variation between the potentials in MP47 and MP48 probably results from the generation of many oxidation states in different energies during the charging–discharging process and it is difficult to oxidize all the ferrocene units under a certain voltage for these polymers.84

  Wong and co-workers incorporated ferrocene on fluorene functionality as the redox-active component to improve the stability and film-forming ability in MP49 and MP50 as the active cathode materials. These polymeric derivatives have a high weight-averaged molecular weight up to 2.9 × 104 g mol−1. Notably, the linear molecular structure originating from the acetylenic linker greatly improves the transportation of the active species along the main chain and thus enhances the redox kinetics during the charging–discharging process. After the introduction of thiophene or triphenylamine moieties into the polymers, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of composite electrodes made of MP49 and MP50 show a loose and porous network, which is crucial for transporting the electrolyte ions in order to obtain favorable electrochemical properties. It is also worth noting that the cross-linking effect of the triphenylamine unit in MP50 may further stabilize the electrode during the charging–discharging process, and more than 100 stable cycles can be obtained under a current density of 10 C.85

  By terminating one para-position of triphenylamine with the ferrocene unit, a linear polytriphenylamine derivative MP51 was prepared after chemical oxidative polymerization. This polymer has a poorer solubility in common organic solvents than poly(vinylferrocene), and thus shows a better stability of more than 50 cycles even at a current rate of 500 mA g−1. Different from poly(triphenylamine), MP51 successfully decreases the cross-linking density by the introduction of ferrocene as a terminating group, and thus promotes the availability of the redox active center to the electrolyte, resulting in an initial discharge capacity of up to 100.2 mA h g−1.86  
To solve the problem of capacity fading in the ferrocene-based polymers, Zhan et al. proposed the use of poly(ferrocenylmethylsilane) derivatives as the active cathode materials for battery applications. A high molecular weight polymer is possible to achieve with silicone bridge bonds. The MW of MP52 and MP53 are determined to be ca. 80000 g mol−1. The cathode containing 40 wt% of MP52, 40 wt% conductive carbon and 20 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene binder is used to fabricate Li secondary batteries with Li foil as the anode and ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate as the electrolyte. The prepared battery may release 90 mA h g−1 specific capacity (77% of the theoretical capacity) within 72 s and exhibit an excellent capacity retention for more than 500 cycles. More importantly, the performance of the obtained cathode material is independent of the anode material used; Sodium secondary batteries and all-organic batteries are also assembled and tested in the same device configuration and with decent capacity performances of 92 mA h g−1 and 85 mA h g−1, respectively.87  
In order to improve the low specific capacity of polypyrrole (PPy) and its charging–discharging curve sloping, Park and co-workers firstly tried to anchor the ferrocene moiety into the skeleton of PPy by chemical bonding, and a copolymer (MP54) was prepared. Compared with the PPy-based cathode which exhibits a low specific capacity of 20 mA h g−1 and a sloped voltage, the discharging capacity of the obtained copolymer could reach up to 65 mA h g−1 with a stable voltage plateau at 3.5 V versus Li/Li+, which suggests that the ferrocene moiety plays a vital role in both morphology improvement and redox potential flattening. This deduction can be further confirmed by SEM. After ferrocene is tethered to PPy, the resulting structure of the copolymer is looser due to the steric hindrance from ferrocene, and thus more accessible to the electrolyte, resulting in a higher specific capacity. Furthermore, owing to the conductivity property and mechanical stability of the PPy backbone, no conductive additive and binder have to be added in the cathode.88  
In 2013, Zhang et al. reported another strategy to optimize the performance of conductive PPy cathode materials by designing ferrocene-containing pyrrole-based homopolymer MP55 and poly(ferrocene-co-pyrrole) copolymer MP56. The undoped PPy, FCP10 and FCP11 show the discharge capacities of 16.5, 43.2 and 68.1 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 between 2.5 and 4.2 V, respectively. The copolymer combines the advantages of both ferrocene and pyrrole and exhibits a synergistic effect as expected. In other words, the resonance doping effect in the extended main skeleton, the advanced electrochemical characteristics of the pendant ferrocene group and the loose morphology of the copolymer all contributed to the improved discharge platform.89

Various kinds of platinum-based metallopolyynes with different organic congeners and structural dimensionalities for BHJSCs have been synthesized via the Sonogashira polycondensation approach, while the metal-containing polymers for DSSCs including cadmium, zinc, nickel and cobalt coordination complexes can be made through the Heck and Yamamoto coupling reactions. These hybrid materials combine the advantages of both metal centers and organic components and exhibit outstanding physical and chemical properties. By simply changing the organic congeners, the optical energy gaps of these polymers are tunable (from 1.17 to 2.93 eV) and all of them have good thermal stabilities (Tdec > 230 °C) (Table 1). The incorporation of heavy metals into organic frameworks has a significant influence on the electronic and optical properties of metallopolymers by controlling the energy transfer dynamics in the molecules (Tables 1 and 2). Photoinduced charge separation in the BHJSCs for polymer blends is believed to occur via the triplet excited state of the high-bandgap metallopolymers.90 Very recently, Huang and co-workers reported a novel class of iridium(III) polymers MP57 for BHJSCs. By including the triplet component in the recorded high efficiency pure organic polymeric counterpart, the elaborately tailor-made material MP57 shows a dramatic improvement in η, which is up to 8.71%.90 This provides evidence of the importance of the metal center in photovoltaic applications. Based on these findings, metallated polymers well demonstrate their potential for efficient solar energy utilization devices.  
On the other hand, most of the polymeric materials for WOLEDs are based on iridium(III) copolymers incorporating multiple organic chromophores as side chain moieties or on the backbones. These iridium-embedded polymers are thermally stable with high decomposition temperatures (Tdec > 380 °C) and can be normally obtained through the incorporation of an ancillary ligand and then post polymerization via a Suzuki coupling reaction. Due to the high quantum efficiency stemming from the strong spin–orbit coupling effect of the iridium(III) ion, both singlet and triplet excitons can be fully utilized in these electrophosphorescent metallopolymers. More importantly, by controlling the monomer feed ratio carefully, the emission intensities from the three primary colors can be made more balanced, their ηext, ηL, the brightness as well as the color quality of the devices could be tuned well (Table 3).
Cathode active organometallic polymers have currently been focused on the ferrocene-based structures. The working principle of the fabricated cell involves the reversible one-electron redox reaction of the ferrocene and ferrocenium couple, providing a stable average discharge potential of around 3.3 V vs. Li/Li+. In particular, these ferrocene-containing capacitive cells exhibit extremely high rate reversible redox properties which are benefited from the fast kinetics upon the charging–discharging process. With the increasing concern about environmental issues of LIBs, metallopolymers with unique features including good processability and flexibility open up a new avenue for energy storage towards high power density and cycle stability (Table 4).
Concluding remarks
In this review, the current development of metallopolymers for energy-generating, energy-saving and energy-storing applications is presented and commented. Compared with commercially obtainable inorganic photovoltaic, lighting and cathode materials, there is still much room for their organic congeners to excel in improving the performances in each category. However, there is no doubt that the use of organic polymeric materials also represents a promising technology to realize practical applications in the near future. Polymeric BHJSCs and DSSCs based on platinum(II), rhenium(I), ruthenium(II), iridium(III), zinc(II), cadmium(II), nickel(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with enhanced light-harvesting efficiency due to the introduction of metal centers are promising candidates for photovoltaic devices. Metallopolymers embedded with iridium(III) complexes show great potential in high-performance WPLEDs owing to their high quantum efficiency resulting from the strong spin–orbit coupling of the heavy metal ion. Based on the unique reversible redox property of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, ferrocene-containing polymers applied for organic LIBs also hold great promise for addressing the size and safety issue during the electrochemical energy storage process. The method of incorporating metal ions into polymeric materials provides structural diversity and has potential to meet future challenges of scalability, flexibility, low power consumption, light weight and reduced cost for the upcoming optoelectronics and so on. To make organometallic polymers commercially competitive, materials that could be utilized in all these energy related devices are needed. So far, the trajectory of these metallopolymers for BHJSCs, WOLEDs and LIBs is upwards and the future looks bright.
