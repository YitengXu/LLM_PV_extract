    , Accepted 19th July 2019First published on 21st July 2019AbstractTaking account of the fascinating properties of photovoltaic materials with conjugated side chains and the great influence of side-chain engineering on molecular structures and optoelectronic properties, we herein successfully developed three novel A–D–A (A = acceptor unit, D = donor unit) type small molecular acceptors (SMAs), IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC, based on a methylene-modified indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor building block (IDTV), in which four flanking aryls were introduced as the conjugated side chains by grafting onto the two ethylene bridges of the IDT unit. The effects of the conjugated side chain and its type (phenyl vs. thienyl) as well as the substitution position (para vs. meta) on the molecular structures, physicochemical properties, charge transport properties, film morphology and photovoltaic performance of these SMAs have been investigated systematically. Compared to the control molecule IDT-PhIC based on IDT, the three IDTV-based acceptors exhibit extended conjugation in the vertical direction, which can enlarge the π-electron delocalization region along the molecular backbone and thus broaden the absorption spectra, reduce the bandgaps and elevate energy levels. Additionally, the conjugated side chains far away from the framework of the IDTV segment can enhance the rigidity, resulting in decreased solubility and improved charge transport properties of the SMAs. Because of the synergistic effects of changing the conjugated side-chain type and substitution position, m-IDTV-PhIC with meta-hexyloxyphenyl as the conjugated side chains exhibits relatively good solubility, a broad absorption spectrum and a high-lying LUMO energy level, moderate molecular planarity and better charge transport properties and film morphology, which are beneficial for achieving higher Voc, Jsc, and FF in devices compared to the control IDT-PhIC and the other IDTV-based SMAs IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC. As a result, among these acceptors, a polymer solar cell (PSC) fabricated with m-IDTV-PhIC as an acceptor and polymer PBDB-T as the donor delivers the best PCE of 5.85% with both the highest Voc (0.99 V) and Jsc (11.58 mA cm−2). This work not only provides a simple and effective strategy for developing new A–D–A type SMAs with conjugated side chains but also proves that the side-chain modification is an effective approach to optimize photovoltaic performance of the acceptors in PSCs.
1. Introduction
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has been proved as the most effective device architecture in polymer solar cells (PSCs), where an electron donor material blends with an acceptor one to form the photoactive layer.1,2 To improve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs, various donor and acceptor materials have been developed via various molecular design strategies, such as backbone manipulation,3–6 side-chain engineering,7–12 and substituent group modification.13–17 In particular, side-chain engineering has received continually increased attention because it plays a vital role in tuning solubility, intermolecular packing, physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of the related donor7 or acceptor8 materials. More importantly, not only the type (alkyl vs. aryl, and alkyl vs. alkoxyl) and position9 (para vs. meta) but also the shape10 (linear vs. branched) and length11 of side chains have a great influence on the molecular structure and optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic materials. Polymer donor materials with conjugated side chains usually exhibited superior performance over their counterparts without conjugated side chains.18,19 In the past few years, a variety of side-chain conjugated polymer donors have been developed for PSCs with PCEs over 13%.20,21 As for acceptors, Zhan et al. recently reported nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with conjugated side-chains grafted directly onto the aromatic rings of the backbone, and achieved a high PCE of 13%.22 These results indicate that both for donor and acceptor materials, it is a very effective approach to enhance PCEs of PSCs by introducing conjugated side chains.
Nowadays, most high-performance SMAs adopt a planar A–D–A (A = acceptor unit, D = donor unit) configuration with a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the D and A units.23 Additionally, some alternative strategies for the design of SMAs have been developed. For example, Zhou et al. designed a novel SMA with an (AA)–π–D–π–(AA) configuration, where four 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) groups were used as A units.24 This kind of SMA usually possess a planar conjugated backbone and several non-conjugated side chains.25 The side chains on the fused-ring central donor (D) core, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT),24,26 indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT)27 and heptacyclicbenzodi(cyclopentadithiophene),28 are linked to the sp3-hybridized carbon atom of the cyclopentadiene moiety, which can inhibit excessive aggregation of the molecules.22 However, the twisted side chain has an undesirable effect on molecular planarity and conjugation length, which limits the absorption and charge mobilities of SMAs. To address this issue, side-chain engineering, including the side-chain type and position, has been used to tune absorption, intermolecular π–π stacking, crystallinity, electron mobility, and molecular energy levels of the SMAs.
In view of the superior properties of side-chain conjugated molecules and the relatively narrow absorption and low electron mobility of IDT-based SMAs, in this paper, we first employed a methylene-modified IDT building block (IDTV, see Fig. 1) as the central donor (D) core and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as the A unit to construct three novel A–D–A type SMAs, IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC, as shown in Fig. 1. These IDTV-based SMAs feature four flanking aryls in the lateral direction as the conjugated side chains grafted onto the central IDT backbone via two ethylene bridges, which is obviously different from the previously reported side-chain conjugated SMAs.22,29,30 This is expected to extend the effective conjugation and broaden the absorption spectrum of the resulting small molecules. In addition, the introduction of sp2-hybridized bridged carbon atoms in the IDTV unit could evidently weaken the steric hindrance of the conjugated side-chains and form more compacted structures, resulting in improved charge transport mobility. Recently, a similar idea was reported by other groups, where some IDTV-based polymer donors with alkyls or aryls as side chains were synthesized and applied both for efficient fullerene- and nonfullerene-based PSCs.31,32 However, as far as we know, this versatile idea has not been applied to the design of SMA materials. Using IDT-PhIC (see Fig. 1) based on IDT with non-conjugated alkoxylphenyl side-chains as the control molecule, IDTV-PhIC based on the IDTV block with para-alkoxylphenyl as the conjugated side chains was firstly prepared. Then, to better understand the effect of the substitution position of conjugated side chains on the molecular structure, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties, m-IDTV-PhIC with meta-alkoxylphenyl side-chains was designed and synthesized. Finally, the third IDTV-based SMA of IDTV-ThIC was synthesized by replacing alkoxylphenyl side chains with alkylthienyl side chains to investigate the impact of the type of the conjugated side chain. Benefiting from the two perpendicular ethylene-bridged conjugation side chains, these IDTV-based SMAs exhibit broader and redshifted absorption spectra, lower optical bandgaps and higher HOMO/LUMO energy levels as compared with the control SMA (IDT-PhIC). As a result, the PSC based on m-IDTV-PhIC and polymer donor PBDB-T33 (see Fig. 1) achieved a PCE of up to 5.85%, which is not only superior to the control SMA IDT-PhIC (PCE = 5.11%) but also significantly higher than that of the PSCs based on IDTV-PhIC (1.77%) and IDTV-ThIC (0.61%). Our results indicate that the conjugated side-chain optimization of A–D–A type SMAs is an effective means to develop high-performance SMAs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the three IDTV-based acceptors are depicted in Scheme 1. The diketone precursor (1) and compounds 3a/3b/3c were easily prepared according to the previously reported procedure.32,34 Then, compound 1 was transformed into the crucial tetrabromide compound (2) possessing two perpendicular ethylene moieties with a high yield of 80% via the Corey–Fuchs reaction in a mixture of CBr4 and triethoxyphosphine. Next, palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling of compound 2 and alkyl substituted arylboronic ester (3a/3b/3c) afforded the intermediates 4a/4b/4c with four conjugated side chains in moderate yields (52–68%). Subsequently, the key dialdehyde compounds 5a/5b/5c were obtained by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction from 4a/4b/4c, respectively. Finally, the target acceptors IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC were obtained via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the dialdehydes and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC). The chemical structures of all the as-synthesized compounds were fully characterized and confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF MS. Synthetic details and structural data for some compounds are provided in the ESI.† The control SMA IDT-PhIC was prepared according to the previous literature.35 These IDTV-based SMAs are soluble in common organic solvents at room temperature or upon heating-up, like dichloromethane, chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The decomposition temperatures (at 5% weight loss) of IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1 in ESI†) to be 380, 379, and 366 °C, respectively, implying an excellent thermal stability for these SMAs.

2.2 Absorption and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these acceptors in chloroform solution and in thin film form are depicted in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and the detailed data are collected in Table 1. In solutions, all the acceptors exhibit strong and broad absorption in the region of 500–750 nm, as shown in Fig. 2a. The control acceptor IDT-PhIC shows an absorption maximum (λmax) at 658 nm with an extinction coefficient (ε) of 2.14 × 105 M−1 cm−1; however, the three IDTV-based SMAs with the conjugated side chains display a redshifted λmax at about 684, 669, and 669 nm and relatively lower ε values of 1.62 × 105, 1.00 × 105, and 1.46 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC, respectively, which indicates that the introduction of conjugated side chains could be beneficial to redshifting and broadening the absorption spectra. This phenomenon suggests that a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect exists between the central D unit (IDTV) and the terminal A unit (IC), due to the increased electron-donating ability enabled by grafting two vinylene groups on the IDTV unit (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2b, the λmax values of these acceptors in thin films show a 37–88 nm redshift compared to what is observed in solutions. The redshifted absorption should be ascribed to the strong intermolecular interactions (interchain packing or aggregation) induced by the extended π-conjugated structure of IDTV segments in the molecular backbones (see Fig. 1). The optical bandgap (Eoptg) values of IDT-PhIC, IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC estimated from the absorption edge (λedge) of the thin film are 1.66, 1.55, 1.59 and 1.52 eV, respectively (Table 1), implying that the introduction of conjugated side groups has a great effect on the bandgaps of the resultant SMAs. Notably, one can find that all the IDTV-based SMAs have a complementary absorption with that of the middle-bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T (see Fig. 2b), indicating that a high Jsc may be obtained for PSCs constructed by these IDTV-based SMAs and PBDB-T.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of these acceptors (see Fig. S2 in ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were deduced from the onsets of the oxidation and reduction peaks, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDT-PhIC, IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC are deduced to be −5.67/−3.89 eV, −5.52/−3.84 eV, −5.63/−3.78 eV, and −5.43/−3.72 eV (Table 1), respectively. It was revealed that both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the IDT-based acceptor can be elevated by introducing conjugated side chains into the IDT core via an ethylene unit. Additionally, changing the type of the conjugated side chains has a more obvious impact on energy levels than the variation of substituent position of the side chains. Fig. 2c presents the energy level alignment of these SMAs and the polymer donor PBDB-T. Notably, both IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC have a higher HOMO energy level relative to PBDB-T, which will be unfavorable to charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, and will ultimately reduce the photovoltaic performance. Clearly, IDTV-based SMAs have upshifted LUMO energy levels relative to that of the control SMA IDT-PhIC, which is favorable to obtain a high Voc of the PSCs with these SMAs. These physicochemical results demonstrate that the conjugated side chain and its type (phenyl vs. thienyl) as well as the substitution position (para vs. meta) have a great impact on the absorption, optical bandgaps and electronic energy levels of the corresponding SMAs.
2.3 Theoretical calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the influence of the conjugated side chain and its type as well as the substitution position on the molecular conformations and electronic structures of these IDTV-based SMAs. For A–D–A type small molecules, the backbone coplanarity is directly related with the dihedral angle of θ1, which is defined to be the conjugation effect of the central D unit and the end group A. As shown in Fig. 3, the optimal geometries of the three IDTV-based SMAs display a slightly bigger θ1 than that of the control molecule IDT-PhIC, implying that the introduction of conjugated side chains by ethylene bridges reduces backbone coplanarity of the small molecules. For the control molecule IDT-PhIC, the four flanking hexyloxylphenyl side groups are perpendicular to the IDT core because of the sp3-hybridized character of the bridged carbons, which allows the free rotation of the side groups and a stretch in space without disturbing the conjugated molecular backbone, resulting in a nearly flat molecular backbone (θ1 = 1.51°), as shown in the top and front view in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, this will hamper the intermolecular π–π stacking of the IDT core. Nevertheless, the molecular backbones of the three IDTV-based SMAs did not exhibit as excellent a planarity as expected, and slightly twisted structures form (θ1 = 2.17–4.46°) even when long 2-ethylhexyl chains are simplified as methyl groups for saving calculation time (see the top and front view in Fig. 3). This can be ascribed to the enhanced steric hindrance between the aryl side groups and the neighboring IC unit (see the front view in Fig. 3), due to the prevention of free rotation of the side groups after the sp3-hybridized carbons were changed to sp2-hybridized carbons in the ethylene bridges of the IDTV core. From another perspective, the conjugated aryl chains far away from the skeleton of the IDTV unit owing to the inserted methylene in the IDTV segment can improve the rigidity of these IDTV-based SMAs and promote the formation of closer intermolecular π–π stacking (see the side view in Fig. 3), which will help to achieve a high charge carrier mobility.

From Fig. S3 in the ESI,† one can see that the electron distributions of the HOMO energy levels are mainly delocalized from the central donor cores (IDT or IDTV) including the conjugated side groups to some part of the A unit (IC), while the LUMO electron densities are almost delocalized over the whole conjugated molecular backbone. Moreover, the HOMO electron distributions of the control IDT-PhIC are different from those of the three IDTV-based SMAs and that of m-IDTV-PhIC is also obviously different from those of IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC, whereas the LUMO electron distributions of all these SMAs are similar. These results suggest that the introduction of the conjugated side chains has a greater impact on the HOMO energy levels (−5.67 to −5.43 eV) than the LUMO ones (−3.89 to −3.72 eV), as shown in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.60/−3.40 eV, −5.24/−3.28 eV, −5.44/−3.22 eV, and −5.27/−3.27 eV for IDT-PhIC, IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC, respectively (Table 1). The limited electron density delocalization of the HOMO energy could be responsible for the slightly higher HOMO energy levels of IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC than those of IDT-PhIC and m-IDTV-PhIC. The variation tendency of energy levels accords with those observed from the CV results.
2.4 Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC, BHJ PSCs were fabricated with the inverted structure ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:SMA/MoO3/Al. The middle-bandgap polymer PBDB-T was employed as an electron donor in view of complementary absorption (see Fig. 2b). Device fabrication conditions, such as the donor:acceptor (PBDB-T:SMA) blend ratio, the thermal annealing temperature, processing solvent (CB, CF, and o-DCB) and additive (DIO and CN) were varied to determine the optimal conditions (see Table S1 in ESI†). For all SMAs, the optimal donor:acceptor blend ratio was determined as 1:1. Under optimized conditions (CB as solvent, and without annealing and additive), PSCs based on the control IDT-PhIC show a moderate PCE of 5.11% along with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 9.99 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 54.7% (see Fig. 4a and Table 2). Consistent with the higher-lying LUMO energy level and broader absorption of m-IDTV-PhIC, PBDB-T:m-IDTV-PhIC-based PSCs show a higher Voc of 0.99 V and an increased Jsc of 11.58 mA cm−2, resulting in a higher PCE of 5.85% under optimized conditions (CB as solvent, thermal annealing at 130 °C and 1 vol% CN as additive). One can find that these IDTV-based SMAs present a comparably high Voc (∼1.0 V) with other previously reported SMA-based PSCs, in which the “same-acceptor-strategy” (SAS) was adopted – benzotriazole (BTA)-based polymer donors paired with BTA based SMAs to realize a rather high Voc (1.0–1.3 V).36–39 This result suggests that introducing the conjugated side chains into SMA backbones is a promising strategy to improve the Voc value. However, the other two IDTV-based SMAs IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC exhibit a poor PCE of 1.77% and 0.62%, respectively, mainly due to both the distinctly reduced Jsc and FF (see Fig. 4a and Table 2). The reasons for this may be ascribed to (i) closer molecular packing and greater rigidity of IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC relative to IDT-PhIC causing excessive aggregation of the molecules, which is harmful to morphological regulation; (ii) the higher HOMO energy levels of IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC compared with the polymer donor PBDB-T, which is unfavorable to the photoinduced efficient electron transfer from the donor to acceptor. As for m-IDTV-PhIC, due to the existence of meta-hexyloxyphenyl conjugation side chains, this acceptor possesses a moderate planarity and rigidity compared with those of the other three SMAs and a lower HOMO energy level than that of PBDB-T, which are beneficial for regulating morphology, improving charge mobility and transferring the photoinduced electron efficiently, and thus leading to a relatively higher Jsc and FF. In BHJ PSCs, the driving force for hole-transfer is extremely dependent on the donor and acceptor HOMO alignment energetics.40,41 The HOMO energy levels of IDT-PhIC and m-IDTV-PhIC are determined to be −5.67 and −5.63, respectively (see Fig. 2c and Table 1), while the PBDB-T HOMO energy locates at −5.54 eV, which means likely favorable hole-transfer from IDT-PhIC and m-IDTV-PhIC to PBDB-T.42–44 It should be noted that the low optical bandgaps of these SMAs may favor preferential excitation versus the donor polymer, allowing observation of hole-transfer from the SMAs to donor polymer in these systems.42 Therefore, efficient SMA to PBDB-T hole-transfer should be partly responsible for the relatively high Jsc, FF and PCEs achieved from m-IDTV-PhIC- and IDT-PhIC-based PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the IDT-PhIC-based device exhibits higher EQE values from 420 to 750 nm relative to the IDTV-based cells, but the latter display obviously broader EQE spectral response ranges than that of the former, owing to the broader and redshifted absorption spectra of the IDTV-based SMAs. The Jsc values deduced from the EQE curves are 9.07 and 10.7 mA cm−2 for IDT-PhIC and m-IDTV-PhIC, respectively, which agree with those obtained from the J–V measurements (Fig. 4a) within 5–10% error.

2.5 Charge transport properties and blend film morphology
The charge mobilities including electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with electron-only (ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:SMA/Ca/Al) and hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:SMA/MoO3/Al) devices. As shown in Fig. 5a and b and Table 2, among these SMAs, m-IDTV-PhIC-based blend films exhibit the highest μe and μh (1.98 × 10−5 and 4.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). In addition, IDT-PhIC-based blend films deliver higher μe and μh compared to the blend films based on IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC. The results reveal that the conjugated side chain and its type as well as the substitution position have effects on the charge mobilities of the blend films based on IDTV. The relatively higher hole and electron mobilities of PBDB-T:m-IDTV-PhIC and PBDB-T:IDT-PhIC blend films could increase charge carrier transportation and reduce charge recombination, thus contributing to a higher Jsc and FF as well as the superior photovoltaic performance of the corresponding photovoltaic devices. The relatively low charge mobilities and imbalanced ratios (μh/μe) of the IDTV-PhIC- and IDTV-ThIC-based PSCs should be one of the reasons for their relatively lower Jsc and FF as well as PCEs. The curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of PBDB-T:SMA PSC devices were measured to investigate the charge dissociation and collection process, as shown in Fig. 5c.45 The charge dissociation efficiency of PSCs can be assessed by charge collection probability [P(E,T)]. Under short-circuit conditions, the [P(E,T)] values of the PSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT-PhIC and PBDB-T:m-IDTV-PhIC were found to be 0.885 and 0.875, respectively, which are obviously higher than those of IDTV-PhIC- and IDTV-ThIC-based PSC devices ([P(E,T)] = 0.711 and 0.580, respectively). This means that the IDT-PhIC- and m-IDTV-PhIC-based PSCs reveal more efficient charge dissociation and collection at the donor/acceptor interfaces.

We also studied the surface morphology of the optimized PBDB-T:SMA active layers by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As described in Fig. S4 (ESI†), a uniform and smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.23 nm was gained from the PBDB-T:IDT-PhIC blend. The PBDB-T:m-IDTV-PhIC blend film displays similar fibrous features to PBDB-T:IDT-PhIC, but relatively larger surface aggregates and a higher RMS of 4.91 nm were observed. As for IDTV-PhIC- and IDTV-ThIC-based blend films, surface aggregates become serious and the RMS increased up to 5.65 nm and further to 44.9 nm, respectively, indicating larger-size phase separation. The serious phase separation in the blend films is unfavorable for efficient charge separation and transportation and consequently limits device performance. We suppose that the great variation in surface aggregates of these blends is closely related with the solubility and miscibility with the polymer donor of the four SMAs. In fact, we found that the solubility of IDT-PhIC is higher than that of m-IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-PhIC under the same conditions (CB, 25 °C). Moreover, IDTV-ThIC shows the worst solubility in most common organic solvents even upon heating-up CF (<10 mg), consequently the much larger surface aggregates in the PBDB-T:IDTV-ThIC blend can be ascribed to the aggregation of IDTV-ThIC. On the other hand, the trend in surface roughness also implies that IDT-PhIC and m-IDTV-PhIC should have a higher miscibility with PBDB-T than that of IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC. Note that the lower phase miscibility in the IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC blends may reflect less favorable interactions between the respective (hetero)aryl substituents (phenyl and thienyl) and PBDB-T, which can increase SMA ordering and alter PSC metrics.46
3. Conclusions
In summary, an ethylene-modified pentacyclic aromatic arene (IDTV) was developed as a donor building block to construct a series of novel A–D–A type small molecules, IDTV-PhIC, m-IDTV-PhIC, and IDTV-ThIC. These IDTV-based small molecules were designed, synthesized, and applied as acceptor materials for PSCs by changing the conjugated side-chain type and substitution position on the phenyl side-chains. Introducing lateral ethylene bridges and side-chain engineering of the conjugated side-chains have great effects on the molecular structures, solubility, absorption spectra, bandgaps, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge transport properties, film morphology and photovoltaic performance of the resultant SMAs. Because of the synergistic effects obtained by varying the conjugated side-chain types and substitution position on the phenyl side-chains, m-IDTV-PhIC exhibits superior comprehensive characteristics to those of the control SMA IDT-PhIC and the other IDTV-based SMAs IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC, reflecting relatively good solubility, a broad absorption spectrum and a high-lying LUMO level, moderate molecular planarity and rigidity, good charge transport, optimal film morphology and efficient m-IDTV-PhIC to PBDB-T hole-transfer, which helps to achieve a higher Voc, Jsc, and FF in devices compared to the other three SMAs. As a result, the PBDB-T:m-IDTV-PhIC-based PSCs show an excellent PCE up to 5.85%, which is superior to the control IDT-PhIC (5.11%). Hole-transfer was also observed from IDTV-PhIC and IDTV-ThIC to PBDB-T, but less efficiently, reflecting measurably inferior morphology and nonoptimal energy level alignment, leading to poor PCEs of 1.77% and 0.62%, respectively. Our findings in this work should provide useful guidelines for the design of novel A–D–A type SMAs for highly efficient PSCs via introducing conjugated side chains and changing the conjugated side-chain type and substitution position on the conjugated side chains.
