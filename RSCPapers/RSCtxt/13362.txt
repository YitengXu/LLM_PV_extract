    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 4th January 2023AbstractDeveloping slot-die coated efficient all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) using eco-friendly solvents is extremely crucial for further large-scale production. However, how to gain control over the balanced phase separation and polymer crystallinity to optimize charge dissociation and transport in slot-die coated all-PSCs, is still mysterious and remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple yet efficient strategy to limit phase separation by using halogen-free solvent ortho-xylene (o-XY) at a precisely manipulated solution temperature to enhance the crystallinity of a PBDB-T:PZT-γ blend film. Consequently, this hot slot-die coated all-PSC achieved a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.01% in ambient air without extra processing treatments. Various characterization studies revealed that elevated temperature could appropriately inhibit the aggregation of polymers in o-XY and more free molecular segments obviously promoted the strong crystallization and pure phase, thus leading to a greatly enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor. Comparatively, the aggregation of PBDB-T in high-temperature halogenated solvent (CB) is overly suppressed, which led to the excessively pure and large phases, and consequently lower PCE. Our effectively integrated strategy can simultaneously optimize the phase separation and crystalline properties by using halogen-free solvent, both of which play significant roles in realizing highly efficient all-PSCs when using the slot-die printing technique.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of a polymer donor (PD) and polymer acceptor (PA),1–5 have attracted much attention due to their various advantages including strong tolerance to the PD/PA ratio in the blend film, good film-forming ability, and superior morphological stability under thermal and mechanical stresses.6–10 By virtue of these distinctive features, all-PSCs are widely regarded as particularly suitable candidates for large-area roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication.11,12 Moreover, the strategy of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs)6,13,14 has recently emerged as an effective way to advance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 18% in binary single junction devices.15–17 These remarkable improvements in device performance further advance the development of all-PSCs.18–20 However, most of the current state-of-the-art all-PSCs at the lab-scale are typically fabricated by spin coating using halogenated solvents (i.e., chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), etc.),15–17,21 which are not suitable for large-scale processing.22–24 In addition, efficient all-PSCs mostly relied on the post-processing methods, such as solvent vapor annealing and thermal annealing, which often suffer from increased production complexity and cost-effectiveness issues. Therefore, simplifying the processing conditions towards optimized morphology by using eco-friendly solvents and slot-die coating is urgently required.25,26
To achieve the above goals, it is essential that the active layers feature a strong polymer crystallization, appropriate phase purity and a domain size around ∼20 nm for efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge transport.27,28 However, it still remains challenging to ensure a small domain size while enhancing crystallization and phase purity, especially in the all-polymer system.29 Different from SMAs, the increased molecular weight endows the polymer acceptor with a large number of entanglements with the PD.30 These entanglements severely restrict the self-assembly of polymer chains, and thus lead to lower polymer crystallization. Meanwhile, the weakened ability of phase separation between entangled PD and PA chains in solution contributes to the smaller domain size and lower phase purity.31 Previous studies have proved that the film cast with high-temperature solution can obtain significantly improved crystallization32,33 due to the disentanglement of polymer chains and the reduced crystallization barrier caused by the twisting of polymer segments. However, these disentanglements caused by high temperature often reduce the diffusion resistance of polymer molecules, and excessive diffusion of the PD and PA into their respective enriched regions during the film formation will lead to a large domain size. Therefore, if the entanglement between the polymer chains is not excessively unwound while the solution processing temperature is increased, it may be possible to maintain an appropriate domain size while enhancing the crystallization of the bulk film. Typically, the halogen-free solvents are poor solvents for polymers, which leads to the excessive entanglement of polymers. Most of the polymer donors, such as PBDB-T, PM6, D18, etc., cannot be completely entangled in halogen-free solvents (such as o-XY, etc.) even at high solution temperatures.34 Therefore, the combination of halogen-free solvents and high-temperature solutions is expected to achieve the balance between polymer crystallization and phase separation in all-PSCs with desired performance. From this perspective, slot-die coating is a quite suitable technique to be employed for eco-friendly solvent processing with accurately controllable processing temperature.35,36
In this work, we successfully investigated the different temperature-dependent entanglement and aggregation behaviors of PBDB-T and PZT-γ in halogenated solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and halogen-free solvent ortho-xylene (o-XY) to optimize the blend film morphology during the slot-die coating process. Elevated temperature strongly inhibited the aggregation of PBDB-T in good solvent CB, but had much less effect on the aggregation of PBDB-T in o-XY due to the limited solubility. In addition, the ultraviolet-visible absorption peak of PZT-γ has a significant 5 nm red shift in CB compared with that in o-XY, indicating that PZT-γ has stronger aggregation in CB. These differences provide the processing window to finely control the phase separation degree and crystallinity of PBDB-T and PZT-γ. In-depth morphology studies show that the film morphology is directly related to the entanglement and aggregation degree of PBDB-T polymers in solution state, where the elevated temperature in o-XY solution enhanced the crystallization of PBDB-T without disaggregating the entangled network of PBDB-T. Benefiting from the more balanced crystallization and domain size in optimal bulk film morphology, the hot slot-die coated PBDB-T:PZT-γ-based all-PSC exhibits a record-high PCE of 15.01% using halogen-free o-XY under ambient conditions. Comparatively, too weak PBDB-T aggregation and stronger PZT-γ aggregation in high-temperature CB lead to excessive phase separation, and the oversized and excessively pure domains result in lower PCE of CB fabricated devices (13.27%). Moreover, this hot slot-die coated all-PSC using halogen-free o-XY has only a slight efficiency loss (only 0.8%) compared with the spin coated PBDB-T:PZT-γ based device using halogenated solvent chloroform (CF) (15.8%) reported in the literature,37 which demonstrates the potential of the hot slot die coating method for the eco-friendly industrial production of all-PSCs in the future.
Results and discussion
The schematic of the slot-die coating technique is shown in Fig. 1a. By heating the substrate and the die, the temperature of the solution during the whole film formation process is regulated to promote crystallization of polymers. The chemical structures of the PD (PBDB-T) and the PA (PZT-γ) are shown in Fig. 1a. We evaluated the entanglement and aggregation state of PD and PA in the PBDB-T:PZT-γ system at different temperatures via temperature-dependent ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra to confirm the feasibility of using halogen-free o-XY to retain the entanglement and aggregation of polymers at high solution temperatures. Fig. 1b and c show the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDB-T and PZT-γ in o-XY (boiling point 144.4 °C) and CB (boiling point 131.7 °C), respectively, in which pronounced absorption peaks at 450–700 nm and 750–850 nm are observed for PBDB-T and PZT-γ, respectively. On increasing the solution temperature, the shapes of the absorption spectra of PBDB-T change apparently and the absorption intensity of PZT-γ decreased slightly, even if the solution concentration is = 0.03 mg ml−1, which indicates that both polymers have formed stacked conjugated segments of polymers in solution, and their amounts and degrees are closely related to the temperature and molecular structure. These conjugated segments will act as entangled nodes to form an entangled polymer network. The absorption peak positions of PZT-γ in each solvent have a blue-shift about 4 nm with decreasing absorption intensity when the solution temperature is increased. This blue-shift is undoubtedly a sign of a reduction in the conjugate length, thus, the hot solution prevents the entanglement of PZT-γ in solution.38 Comparatively, an interesting phenomenon was observed that PZT-γ exhibited a red-shift of 5 nm in CB compared with that in o-XY at the same solution temperature. The red-shift implies that PZT-γ has a more compact aggregate structure in CB.39 The stronger aggregation of PZT-γ in CB is obviously unfavorable for the maintenance of the small domain size during film formation.

As for PD PBDB-T, like most polymers, the increased temperature brings the blue-shift of peaks and weakened absorption intensity in the PBDB-T absorption spectra.40 However, the strength of disentanglement on increasing the temperature is different in two solvents. PBDB-T has better solubility in CB and it is easier to solvate and disperse the PD molecules, thus the 0–0 peak intensity of PBDB-T is rapidly suppressed. However in o-XY, the PBDB-T absorption intensity changes more slowly with increasing temperature. The different entanglement and aggregation behaviors of PD and PA in different solvents can also be observed in temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of blend solutions (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the change trend is consistent with the temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra of the single-component solution. Meanwhile, the 0–0 peak of PBDB-T in the absorption spectrum of blend solution can be hardly observed in 120 °C CB, indicating that there are almost no aggregates of PBDB-T in 120 °C CB at low concentration, which is directly related to the formation of blend morphology. In o-XY, the absorption spectrum of blend solution still has an obvious 0–0 peak of PBDB-T even at 130 °C, which indicates that some aggregates and entanglements of PBDB-T remained in the blend solution. The completely different temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PBDB-T in CB and o-XY are consistent with those of previous reports.15,34,36,41 Additionally, PBDB-T in o-XY at 130 °C has a significantly darker color than PBDB-T in CB at 120 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†), which corroborates our opinion. Utilizing these differences, it is possible to obtain a variety of film morphologies with different degrees of crystallinity and different phase sizes, thereby fabricating devices with optimized performance.
To investigate the effect of temperature-dependent aggregation in the PBDB-T:PZT-γ system on photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, the inverted BHJ structure (glass/ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Al) was fabricated by slot-die coating under ambient conditions without any post-treatment. Their energy levels were measured by cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular levels are −5.31/−3.56 eV for PBDB-T and −5.58/−3.75 eV for PZT-γ (Fig. 1d). In order to ensure that the polymer is fully dissolved in o-XY, the minimum processing temperature was chosen to be 50 °C. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of control (solution at 50 °C) and optimized devices are shown in Fig. 1e and Table 1. Detailed photovoltaic parameters of devices fabricated at other solution temperatures are presented in Table S1 (ESI†).

At a solution temperature of 50 °C, the devices showed PCEs of 9.19% and 11.26% processed with o-XY and CB, respectively. However, improved PCEs with the increased solution temperature are observed in both systems. Particularly, the highest PCE of 15.01% is achieved in the o-XY-processed devices when precursor solution temperature is 130 °C, along with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.68 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.874 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 69.56%. As for the devices processed using CB, the optimized PCE is 13.27% (precursor solution at 100 °C), with a Jsc of 24.71 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.894 V, and an FF of 60.09%. The calculated Jsc values based on external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 1f) are 21.33, 23.72, 22.35 and 23.79 mA cm−2 for devices fabricated using 50 °C o-XY, 130 °C o-XY, 50 °C CB and 100 °C CB, respectively, which correspond well with the actually measured Jsc. Observably, the improved efficiency is mainly attributed to the better Jsc and FF, which are probably due to the morphological evolution as discussed below. Furthermore, the decrease in Voc caused by increasing the solution temperature can be related to the change in the interfacial charge transfer states.41–43 To the best of our knowledge, the efficiency of 15.01% processed with o-XY is the highest PCE among solution printed all-PSCs processed using halogen-free solvent (Fig. 1g and Table S2, ESI†).
From the above discussion, detailed temperature and solvent dependent photovoltaic characterization studies of PBDB-T:PZT-γ all-PSC have been performed. Nevertheless, there is no clear understanding concerning how to connect the disentanglement ability of CB and o-XY for PBDB-T and PZT-γ at different temperatures and the final device performance. Hence, in situ UV-vis absorption spectra were employed to study the evolution mechanism of the transition from solution precursors to thin films. Fig. 2a–d show the time-dependent UV-vis absorption contour maps under various processing conditions. The initial data are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the characteristic peak positions of PBDB-T and PZT-γ over time are extracted therefrom (Fig. 2e). The effects of temperature and solvent on the initial peak positions of PBDB-T and PZT-γ at t = 0 s are consistent with the measurements shown in Fig. 1b and c. That is, the temperature has little effect on the PZT-γ peak position, but the elevated temperature makes the PBDB-T peak position significantly blue shift. At t = 0 s, the PZT-γ peak positions are 815 nm in 50 °C o-XY and 813 nm in 130 °C o-XY (820 nm in 50 °C CB and 817 nm in 100 °C CB). As the temperature increases, the initial peak position of PBDB-T in o-XY changes from 619 nm (50 °C) to 606 nm (130 °C), and thus a blue-shift of 13 nm is produced. A similar situation occurs in CB (617 nm for 50 °C and 603 nm for 100 °C). With the removal of the solvent, the PZT-γ peak positions in the solid-state films all remain around 830 nm and the PBDB-T 0–0 peak positions remain around 619 nm. The distinctly different initial absorption peak positions and the similar final absorption peak positions in films suggest the completely different film formation processes under different conditions. Therefore, the evolution of PBDB-T and PZT-γ peak positions over time will provide critical information for understanding the morphology evolution and device performance changes.

The film formation process can be divided into three stages according to the variation of the absorption peak position. (I) Solvent evaporation stage. Generally, during the solvent evaporation stage, since the solution has still not reached the supersaturated state, the structure of the solute will not undergo significant changes in solution. However, polymer segments gradually begin to undergo phase separation and ordering due to the increasing concentration, which is accompanied by an enhanced absorption intensity and a small or no red-shift of the absorption peak. Hence, the disappearance of the solvent evaporation stage in the high temperature solution means a greatly shortened process time without hindering the control of the nanostructure of the films. (II) Rapid solute aggregation and crystalline growth. In the second stage, the solution enters a state of supersaturation with further evaporation of the solvent. At this time, small ordered segments in solution aggregate strongly due to diffusion and precipitate out of solution, and transform into a solid aggregated structure, and the positions of absorption peaks move fast. The precipitated solid and semi-solid structures act as nuclei to attract ordered segments and free polymer molecules in solution to complete the growth of crystals and the aggregation of the amorphous phase. Therefore, the second stage plays a decisive role in the evolution of film morphology. When observing the changes of the PBDB-T and PZT-γ peak positions in the second stage, we find that PBDB-T ends the change of peak positions earlier than PZT-γ, which means that PBDB-T completes the aggregation first compared to PZT-γ. In particular, in the 50 °C o-XY system, almost no change in the PBDB-T 0–0 peak is observed, indicating that the aggregated structure of PBDB-T in o-XY is completely inherited by the solid film. Therefore, under the condition of 50 °C o-XY, the morphology evolution of the film is dominated by the PD PBDB-T. Since the PD first completed the evolution of the aggregated structure, the PA molecules can only fill in the entangled network of the PD without large phase separation. However, with the increase of temperature and the use of CB, the difference between the aggregation time of PBDB-T and PZT-γ becomes smaller (≈1.14 s for 50 °C o-XY, ≈0.60 s for 50 °C CB and ≈0.42 s for 130 °C o-XY). PBDB-T and PZT-γ almost complete the aggregation simultaneously under the condition of 100 °C CB. (III) The film morphology has been frozen. As the solvent completely evaporates, the speedy shift of all peak positions stops, which means that the aggregation of both PD and PA has completed and the film forming process is finished. To further confirm the reliability of the rule, the in situ absorption spectra of the 90 °C o-XY film and 80 °C CB film were measured (Fig. S5, ESI†). The relative aggregation time of PBDB-T and PZT-γ is defined as t1/t2 (where t1 is the time taken for the PBDB-T peak position to reach the platform in stage II, and t2 is the time taken for PZT-γ to complete aggregation in stage II, i.e., t2 is equal to the duration of the whole stage II). Then the values of t1/t2 under the conditions of 50 °C o-XY, 90 °C o-XY, 130 °C o-XY, 50 °C CB, 80 °C CB and 100 °C CB are 0, 0.47, 0.51, 0.44, 0.71, and 1, respectively. Apparently, untangling entanglement of PBDB-T will prolong the relative time for PBDB-T to recover the aggregated structure in the second stage, weaken the confinement of the PBDB-T entanglement network on the PA PZT-γ, and enable excessive phase separation due to low entropy in the all-polymer system.
Based on the above information, we consider that when o-XY is used as the solvent, increasing the solution temperature only induces the movement of partial segments of PBDB-T. Elevated temperature enables the rearrangement of the segments to improve crystallinity without completely destroying the entangled network of PBDB-T. The entanglement of PBDB-T limits the diffusion of PZT-γ, so that the crystallization of the polymers is improved without causing an excessively large phase, thus 130 °C o-XY processed devices obtain the champion PCE. Even if the high temperature disentangles a part of the entanglement of PBDB-T in o-XY, these entanglement networks will recover rapidly before PZT-γ aggregation is completed during the film formation process (Fig. 2f). Comparatively, the situation is different when CB is used as the solvent. Due to the strong dissolving ability of CB for PBDB-T, at a higher temperature (100 °C), the aggregation and entanglement of PBDB-T are strongly inhibited, and the confinement ability for PZT-γ diffusion is severely weakened (schematic illustration is shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). Afterwards, due to the influence of low entropy, an excessively large domain size will be formed, which limits the further improvement of CB-fabricated device performance. The significantly suppressed PBDB-T 0–0 peak intensity in 100 °C CB in the raw in situ UV data (Fig. S4d, ESI†) also confirmed this statement. The significantly enhanced PZT-γ absorption intensity of the 100 °C CB processed films compared to that under the other three conditions also indicates the excessive aggregation of PZT-γ in the 100 °C CB processed films (Fig. S7, ESI†).41 Simultaneously, the broadening of the PZT-γ peak after treatment at high temperature may be attributed to the increase of J-type aggregates.44,45
In order to further verify the above analysis and the possibility of increasing the solution temperature to enhance the crystallinity of polymers, we subsequently investigated the long-range order and phase separation of different polymer blends by using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS).46,47 The 2D-GIWAXS images and line profiles of blend films are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The GIWAXS of neat films was also measured (Fig. S8, ESI†), and their GIWAXS line profiles are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), thereby identifying the origins of each peak in the blend films. The Scherrer equation is used to gain the coherence length (CL) of the diffraction peaks,48 which can reflect the crystallinity of polymers. The neat PZT-γ films invariably maintain nearly pure face-on orientation under different conditions, while the PBDB-T films exhibit a mixed face-on/edge-on orientation. From the crystal parameters fitted by 1D line profiles of blends, we can find that (100) lamellar stacking peaks are located at ∼0.290 Å−1 and the PZT-γ exhibits a strong (010) π–π stacking peak at q ≈ 1.610 Å−1. For o-XY processed blends, the fitted CL values of the (100) peak in the out-of-plane direction and in-plane direction are as follows: 47.58 Å and 42.20 Å for the 50 °C fabricated film, and 85.86 Å and 106.49 Å under the 130 °C condition (Table S3, ESI†). As for blends fabricated using CB, the CL values of the lamellar stacking (100) peaks in out-of-plane and in-plane directions are 44.01 Å and 51.24 Å for the 50 °C fabricated film, and 57.53 Å and 98.46 Å for the 100 °C fabricated film, respectively. Combined with the appearance of π–π stacking peaks in the neat PBDB-T films processed using high temperature solution, it is obvious that PBDB-T processed at a higher temperature has stronger crystallization. Moreover, due to the stronger backbone conjugation caused by the regioregular structure of PZT-γ, the π–π stacking (q ≈ 1.607 Å−1 and CL ≈ 19.80 Å) of the blend films did not change much under each condition and the backbone stacking of PZT-γ (q ≈ 0.398 Å−1) increased slightly with elevated solution temperature, and this is very beneficial for the three-dimensional transport of carriers.

In addition, the orientation changes of PBDB-T crystallites under different processing conditions are analyzed. As can be seen from the GIWAXS of neat PZT-γ films, the (100) peak of PZT-γ overlaps with the (100) peak of PBDB-T. Moreover, PZT-γ shows a pure face-on orientation, and the lamellar stacking only appears in the in-plane direction, which obstructs the signal of the PBDB-T orientation in the blends. Thus, the pole figure of the PBDB-T (100) peak is extracted from the GIWAXS of neat PBDB-T films processed under different conditions (Fig. S10, ESI†). Lamellar packing is defined as a face-on orientation when the angle is between 0° and 45°, while the diffraction peaks from 45° to 90° can be considered as an edge-on orientation. Unlike the majority edge-on orientation in the neat PBDB-T films processed under the other three conditions, the PBDB-T crystallites processed using 100 °C CB adopted more face-on orientation (48.72% face-on orientation). Indeed, the growth of PBDB-T crystallites requires the formation of crystal nuclei first. At high temperature, PBDB-T can be dissolved well in CB, and the free molecules cannot act as stable nuclei to induce crystal growth.49 The dispersed free PBDB-T molecules need to rely on low-energy sites at the solid–liquid interface for the heterogeneous nucleation process, thus generating more face-on oriented PBDB-T crystallites. Simultaneously, when o-XY is used as solvent, the orientation of PBDB-T crystallites changes less with the increase of processing temperature, which shows that PBDB-T still retains some entangled ordered segments with appropriate size in high temperature o-XY.
To quantitatively analyze the phase separation of BHJ films, R-SoXS characterization is selected (Fig. 3c) and the photon energy of 284.2 eV was used to gain maximum scattering contrast. Detailed phase separation parameters are summarized in Table 2, in which the domain size is evaluated from half the characteristic length (ξ) of the periodic structure (ξ = 2π/q).50 Films printed under various conditions exhibit domain sizes of 33 nm (50 °C o-XY), 36 nm (130 °C o-XY), 37 nm (50 °C CB), and 53 nm (100 °C CB), respectively. By means of analyzing the square root of integral scattering intensity (proportional to the phase purity), the relative domain purities of blends are identified as 0.73 (50 °C o-XY), 0.81 (130 °C o-XY), 0.81 (50 °C CB), and 1.00 (100 °C CB), respectively. It is clear that a higher solution temperature leads to the increased domain size and phase purity in the same solvent processed films, but the CB-processed films show a larger phase compared to the o-XY processed ones. It is widely acknowledged that a proper mixing region is rather important for efficient exciton dissociation. Therefore, although the largest domain size and the highest phase purity of 100 °C CB processed films are beneficial to charge transport and reduce bimolecular recombination, the accordingly decreased PD/PA interface is probably detrimental to exciton dissociation. In contrast, the blend films processed with o-XY at 130 °C retain a relatively small domain size with the appropriate purity and strongest crystallization, thus obtaining the best photovoltaic performance.

Besides, in order to visually compare the phase separation characteristics of the films treated under different conditions, atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase and height images were recorded. As shown in the AFM phase images (Fig. 3d), the 50 °C o-XY processed film shows a relatively cotton-like mixed phase due to the strong entanglement between polymers,31 and only a few fiber structures can be seen, which corresponds to the smallest domain size and the minimum phase purity of the 50 °C o-XY processed film. With the use of a good solvent and increased processing temperature, the fiber structure in films becomes clear, and these fiber networks are very conducive to carrier transport. However, the films processed using 100 °C CB obviously have coarser rope-like fibers compared with the other three films, indicating a larger domain size, which is consistent with the results of R-SoXS. AFM height images are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The mean square surface roughness (Rq) values of the four films are 2.72 nm (50 °C o-XY), 3.16 nm (130 °C o-XY), 3.86 nm (50 °C CB) and 4.21 nm (100 °C CB). Although the enhanced phase separation increases the roughness of the surface as the processing temperature increases,51 the o-XY processed films have a smaller Rq than the CB processed films, revealing that the films prepared using o-XY have a more smooth and uniform surface. This will possibly be conducive to reduce the leakage current and charge loss at the interface between the active layer and electrode.
We further investigated the charge generation and recombination characteristics under various conditions to gain a deeper understanding of the changes in device efficiency. The number of photogenerated charges can be extracted from the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff)52 (Jph = JL − JD, Veff = V0 − Va, where JL is the current under illumination and JD is the dark current, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage). Under different Veff, the amount of photogenerated charge is directly proportional to Pd = Jph/Jsat (the saturation photocurrent Jsat is extracted at the Jph plateau at high Veff). As shown in Fig. 4a, under short-circuit conditions (Va = 0), the Pd values of devices prepared using 50 °C o-XY, 130 °C o-XY, 50 °C CB and 100 °C CB are 88.3%, 95.2%, 88.7% and 91.6%, respectively. The device fabricated using 130 °C o-XY has the highest Pd, indicating that the number of photogenerated charges increases evidently in the low Veff region. Concurrently, Jsats under various conditions have similar values, which indicates that the improved device performance comes entirely from less loss of exciton diffusion, more efficient exciton dissociation, and charge transport with less recombination.

We also measured Jsc as a function of light intensity (P) (from 10 to 100 mW cm−2). In general, the relationship between Jsc and P can be used to characterize bimolecular recombination. There is an exponential relationship between Jsc and P in double logarithmic coordinates (Jsc ∝ Pα).53 When slope α is closer to 1, it means less bimolecular recombination in the device. The α values of 50 °C o-XY, 130 °C o-XY, 50 °C CB and 100 °C CB prepared devices were 0.918, 0.952, 0.933 and 0.966, respectively (Fig. 4b). High processing temperatures result in increased α values in both solvents, implying weaker bimolecular recombination under optimized conditions. CB fabricated devices have less bimolecular recombination due to their larger phases and fewer interfaces. Charge mobility measured through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is shown in Fig. 4c and S12 (ESI†),54 and the detailed values are summarized in Table S (ESI†). Elevating the solution temperature increases both hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility of the devices. However, an enhanced μe: μh ratio from 1.1 of 130 °C o-XY to 1.9 of 100 °C CB can be observed. This results in imbalance of carrier transport, and thus lower FF in the 100 °C CB processed device.
Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of neat and blend films were used to observe the dissociation behavior of photogenerated excitons at the PD/PA interface (Fig. 4d). PBDB-T films processed using different solvents have completely different PL spectra. The PBDB-T neat film processed using o-XY has a significantly stronger 0–0 emission peak (690 nm), indicating that the PBDB-T film processed using o-XY contains more J-type aggregation (head-to-tail). However, the 0–1 emission peak (750 nm) of the CB processed PBDB-T film is significantly stronger than the 0–0 emission peak (690 nm), proving that the CB processed PBDB-T film has more H-type aggregation (face-to-face).55 Due to the strong energy transfer in the blend films, the emission peak of PBDB-T was completely quenched, and only the emission signal (800–1200 nm) of PZT-γ was observed in the blend films. The PL quenching efficiencies of the blend films processed under different conditions were calculated using the emission intensity of the pure PZT-γ films as reference. The 100 °C CB processed film had the lowest quenching efficiency (92.55%) compared to the films prepared under the other three conditions (96.86% for 50 °C o-XY, 96.78% for 130 °C o-XY and 95.95% for 50 °C CB). The results verify that the films processed using 100 °C CB form an oversized and over pure phase that is not conducive to the dissociation of photogenerated excitons.56
Finally, we tested the tensile behavior of the active layer to preliminarily evaluate the potential of PBDB-T:PZT-γ-based all-PSCs as flexible devices. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the 130 °C o-XY processed PBDB-T:PZT-γ film exhibited crack-onset strain of 6.68% and a Young's modulus of 0.72 GPa. Such mechanical ductility of the PBDB-T:PZT-γ film is significantly better than that of SMA-based OSCs and single-component OSCs.57 Furthermore, large-area all-PSCs (1.0 cm2) were prepared using o-XY at 130 °C and the PCE of 11.38% was obtained (Fig. S14 and Table S5, ESI†), which shows the potential of our hot halogen-free solvent processing strategy in preparing large-area all-PSCs. However, the PCE of large-area devices still lags behind that of small-area devices. This is mainly due to the difficulty in preparing homogeneous films even if the slot-die coating technique is used. It is necessary to improve the tolerance of device performance to the thickness of the active layer58 or control the flow of solution in hydrodynamics to prepare homogeneous films, so as to make efficient large-area all-PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we reported an efficient strategy of hot slot-die coating for the PBDB-T:PZT-γ based all-PSCs using eco-friendly o-XY to achieve a record-high efficiency of 15.01%. We believe that the weaker aggregation of PZT-γ in o-XY solution and the restriction of PBDB-T on PZT-γ diffusion in the binary system are the key to prevent large domain sizes. The success of our strategy via elevating the solution temperature significantly enhances the crystallinity of PBDB-T while there is little increase in the domain size by using the halogen-free solvent o-XY. The inherently weaker entanglement of PBDB-T in CB compared to that in o-XY makes the polymer donor incapable of restricting the diffusion of the polymer acceptor, resulting in overly large and pure phases, which limits the efficiency improvement of CB fabricated devices (the PCE of the optimized device is 13.27%). We speculate that the moderate polymer entanglement may be crucial for highly efficient all-PSCs. Our hot solution processing strategy combined with the understanding of the relationship between polymer entanglement and phase separation in slot-die coated all-polymer systems provides practical validation and theoretical guidance for the eco-friendly industrial production of all-PSCs.
