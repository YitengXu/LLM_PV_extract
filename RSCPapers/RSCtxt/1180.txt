1 Introduction
The current supply and availability of energy has been increasing around the world. A rapid increase in the world population with the expected quality of life would be unsustainable without dramatic improvements in the control and efficiency of energy production, storage, and use. The high quality of life has been derived from the exploitation of fossil fuels, and significant scientific and technological innovations. Since the long term effects of increasing CO2 emissions on the earth are still unknown, it is obvious that clean and sustainable energy resources that are independent of the use of fossil fuels are highly required.1,2
Actually, several alternative energy conversion systems have been investigated over the past decades, as represented by battery technology. Fuel cells and alkaline ion and redox flow batteries are promising systems among electrochemical devices.3–11 These systems rely on the performance of ion conducting polymer membranes as separators. The devices function only when the applied membranes can efficiently separate the electrodes and mediate the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode by ion conduction. Taking the harsh operating conditions into consideration, the development of membranes with a high ion conductivity and high stability is demanded.12–19
Ion conducting membranes can be divided into two parts, acidic and alkaline membranes, that is, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) and anion exchange membranes (AEMs), respectively. Among the state-of-the-art PEMs, sulfonated perfluoropolymers (PFSA, e.g., Dupont's Nafion®, 3M, Aquivion™ membranes) have been widely used for PEMs due to their high proton conductivity and high chemical stability. By chemical modification or stabilization, their new products (e.g., NRE212, PFIA, Aquivion™, etc.) can even withstand the high temperature of 120 °C.20,21 However, notable drawbacks, such as a harsh producing process, high cost, and fluoro-release problems still more or less restrict their practical use. Hence, a number of non-fluorinated acid ionomers, especially the sulfonated aromatic hydrocarbon polymers, have been widely studied as alternative PEMs. Typical PEM materials include sulfonated poly(ether ketone)s (SPEKs),22,23 sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s (SPAESs),24,25 sulfonated polyimides (SPIs),26 and sulfonated poly(phenylene ether)s (SPPEs),27,28 which have been well developed during the past two decades.
Anionic materials have also received much attention for use in alkaline fuel cells relative to cationic systems. Due to the enhancement of the electrode reaction kinetics at the cathode, as well as the possibility of using inexpensive metals, extensive studies have been conducted in this field utilizing some classical polymer backbone structures—poly(styrene)s,29–31 poly(phenylene oxide)s,32,33 poly(arylene ether sulfone/ketone)s,34–36etc. Followed by the Menshutkin reaction with a tertiary amine, pentamethyl guanidine or N-methylimidazole, anionic conductive functional groups can be precisely introduced into the membrane.
In general, polyphenylenes (PPs) provide advantages as polymer electrolyte membranes due to the absence of heteroatom linkages in their polymer backbones. Due to the high C–C bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the phenyl–phenyl group (478.6 ± 6.3 kJ mol−1, 298 K, see Table 1),37 these chemically stable polymers have drawn much attention as candidates for ion conducting membranes.

From the viewpoint of chemistry, there are three types of linkages in the polymer main chains, i.e., the ortho- (o-), meta- (m-) and para- (p-) positions. However, due to the reactivity and steric hindrance problems, it is rather difficult to obtain poly(o-phenylene)s with high molecular weights (MWs). In contrast, the meta-linkage makes polymer chains more flexible, and the introduction of a long alkoxyl side chain would effectively prevent the planar arrangement. This results in a shortening of the π-conjugation lengths along the backbones of the poly(m-phenylene)s,39 and provides improved processability and film forming properties.
The most studied ionomers are poly(p-phenylene)s. The aromatic polymer main chains with a para-linkage are exceptionally stable to hydrolysis and oxidation. However, based on coplanar molecular packing, these polymers generally exhibit a longer π-conjugation length in the solid state, resulting in a stiff rod-like feature. Moreover, their low solubility in most organic solvents produces difficulties in obtaining polymers with high MW during the polymerization, limiting the membrane forming process. In general, there are two strategies to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. One is to directly introduce long side chains with sulfonated acid groups to the polymers. The other is to incorporate some flexible oligomers by chemical reaction (e.g., block or graft copolymerization, etc.).
In this review, an overview of polyphenylenes and their derivatives for use in cationic/anionic fuel cell (FC) and vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) applications is presented. Because of space limitations and numerous relevant literature, references are restricted to some key papers, reviews, and our own work. For a broader view, the reader may refer to the huge number of papers in this field. Synthesis strategies, physicochemical properties, morphology, and cell performance are briefly reviewed and discussed.
2 Membrane category and synthesis
2.1 Sulfonated poly(p-phenylene)s
The typical synthetic method for sulfonated alkoxyl PPs involves the Suzuki coupling reaction using dibromo- and diboronic acid-substituted monomers,40 as shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of sulfonated alkoxy-substituted poly(p-phenylene) by the Suzuki coupling reaction.40 
An alternative method was based on the coupling of substituted dichlorophenyl monomers using nickel catalysts with 2,5-dichlorobenzophenone (Schemes 2 and 3).41–43 A sulfonated monomer was polymerized to afford sulfonated poly(p-phenylene)s (SPPs) by nucleophilic substitution. However, chlorosulfonic acid or fuming sulfuric acid were typically employed as sulfonation agents. The resulting polymers exhibited good solubility in polar aprotic solvents and could afford self-standing membranes through common casting processes.43 Also, PPs could be incorporated into multiblock copolymers in conjunction with segmented poly(arylene ether sulfone)s (Scheme 4).44

 Scheme 3  Chemical structures of two types of sulfonated poly(p-phenylene) copolymers: sulfonated poly(p-benzoyl-phenylene) (sPBP, P2) and sulfonated poly(p-phenoxybenzoyl-1,4-phenylene) (sPPBP, P3).42 
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of sulfonated poly(p-phenylene)-based multiblock copolymers (P4).44 
A controlled polycondensation method, called catalyst transfer polycondensation, was applied to prepare PP block copolymers via a chain growth polymerization.45–47 Although it is widely considered that the π-donor ability of the thiophene ring is much stronger than that of the phenylene ring, well defined diblock and triblock poly(p-phenylene)s were obtained with rather low dispersities (Đ).45 As shown in Scheme 5, two electron-donating alkoxyl side chains were initially introduced onto a Grignard-type monomer. Polymerization occurred in the presence of Ni(dppe)Cl2 under mild conditions with the catalyst smoothly moving to the C–Br bond.
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of SP1-P2 diblock (P5) and P1-P2-P1 triblock polymers.45 
Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was investigated to synthesize a triblock (TB) copolymer, as shown in Scheme 6. The macroinitiator PP was first prepared by the nickel-catalyzed coupling reaction with benzyl chloride as the end-capped functional group, then styrene was added along with CuCl and various ligands.48 As a result, TB copolymers were obtained with a low Đ value. Post-sulfonation successfully afforded a sulfonated TB copolymer. This TB copolymer showed a clear phase-separated morphology, which may be favorable for the formation of efficient proton conducting channels.

Another method for the synthesis of poly(p-phenylene)s involves the Diels–Alder reaction.49–52Scheme 7 shows the synthesis and sulfonation processes of DA-sulfonated poly(p-phenylene) SPP ionomers (P6). Diels–Alder additions are generally regioselective, predominantly resulting in para-linkages of the polymer chain. However, regioselectivity may be lower in a sterically-crowded system, which would introduce a few flexible meta-linkages. Thus, these polymers may not be as strictly rod-like as the polymers prepared by nickel-catalytic aryl coupling. Their phenyl substituents provide a greater number of potential sites for sulfonation, which can also be achieved by further sulfonation.
 Scheme 7  Synthetic route of DA-SPP (P6) from 1,4-bis(2,4,5-triphenylcyclopentadienone)benzene and di(ethynyl)benzene.49 
Another pathway to synthesize polyphenylenes is the Ullmann coupling of sulfonated dibromo biphenyl monomers. For this coupling reaction, it is useful to exchange the protons of the sulfonic acids for organic cations or metal ions, such as trimethyl benzylammonium or lithium ions.53,54Scheme 8 shows the synthetic route of SPPs in the presence of a copper catalyst. After polymerization, these groups were then deprotected by an acid exchange process and some of the resulting sulfonic acid groups could be used for other modifications by sulfone formation.

2.2 Sulfonated poly(m-phenylene)s
In principle, all dichloro-aromatic monomers can be coupled by nickel-catalyzed polymerization, which has been used for the synthesis of poly(2-benzoyl-1,4-phenylene) as described above. However, there is a different and more straightforward approach to obtain poly(m-phenylene)s via oxidation polymerization in which the phenyl–phenyl linkage is at the meta-position. Typically, alkoxyl groups or some ether linkages were initially introduced at the 1 and 3 positions on the aromatic monomers so as to increase the electron density of the 4 and 6 positions,55,56 as shown in Scheme 9. The oxidation potentials were usually checked to evaluate the reactivity of the functional monomers. After polymerization, excessive oxidative reagents, such as FeCl3 or VO(acac)2, could be easily removed by rinsing with some common solvents (i.e., EtOH, acetone, etc.).

2.3 Phosphonated polyphenylenes
The phosphonated polyphenylenes, such as poly(1,3-phenylene-5-phosphonic acid), were reported by Rager et al.57 A phosphonic acid ester group was primarily introduced into the aromatic monomer unit by the nickel-catalyzed Arbuzov reaction of an aryl bromide or -iodide with triethyl phosphite.58 The aromatic rings were then linked together at the chlorinated positions by nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling in the presence of metallic zinc.59 The PPs with phosphonic acid groups were obtained by a final hydrolysis using concentrated HCl, as shown in Scheme 10.

2.4 Anionic polyphenylenes
Similar to the DA-SPPs, the DA-PPs were utilized as anionic exchange membranes by the Sandia National Lab.60,61 As illustrated in Scheme 11, DA-quaternary ammonium PPs (DAQAPPs) were obtained by bromination of the benzylic methyl groups of the polymers, followed by the Menshutkin reaction with a tertiary amine or N-methylimidazole.61
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of DAQAPPs.60 
2.5 Cross-linking methods
In most cases, PP membranes were prepared by a solution casting method. A polymer was first dissolved in the proper medium to form a concentrated solution. To modify the properties of the membranes, some cross-linking reagents were simultaneously added to the polymer solution, if necessary. The solutions were cast and the excessive solvent was further evaporated at medium or high temperature. Finally, the as-prepared membranes were detached, washed with water, and followed by ion exchange processes for practical use.
Cross-linking reactions usually occur in the presence of cross-linking reagents. Typically, the active hydroxyl groups were kept as the reaction initiation sites, either on the polymer backbones or the bridges. Scheme 12 shows the mechanism of the cross-linking reaction initiated by adding a multi-functional cross-linker, 4,4′-methylene-bis[2,6-bis(hydroxyethyl)phenol] (MBHP). The reaction occurred at the ortho-position of the alkoxyl or ether linkage by the attack of a benzylic cation in the presence of acid.55 Another method is to make a polymeric network by mixing the polymer and an epoxy-based agent during the membrane curing process,62 as shown in Scheme 13. However, the most widely applied pathway is still the intermolecular reaction between sulfonic acid and phenyl groups, resulting in sulfone bond formation. Normally, this approach takes place at a high temperature or in the presence of dehydration agents, e.g., polyphosphoric acid (PPA) or P2O5.63–67

3 Membrane ex situ characteristics
3.1 Physico-chemical properties
Since SPPs have been recently developed, systematic data for their electrochemical and physical properties are rather limited. The first report was published by Rikukawa's group, in which two typical polymers of sulfonated poly(p-phenoxybenzoyl-1,4-phenylene) (SPPBP) and sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) were investigated for comparison.43,68Fig. 1 shows the conductivity data of these two types of membranes. At a similar degree of sulfonation (DS), SPPBP showed greater water uptake and proton conductivity under varied relative humidity (RH) conditions than the former.

A comparison between P2 and P3 was made by Coutanceau's group.42,69 Both P2 and P3 are thermally stable up to at least 215 °C. The water uptake of the P3 was found to be greater than that of the P2, i.e., 65 and 43 mol%, respectively. Their permeability to methanol was found to be 10 times lower than that of the Nafion® 117 membrane. SPBP with alkyl side chains was then reported by Ohira et al., as shown in Scheme 14.70 The gas permeability of P8 under wet conditions was significantly affected by the length of the side chains, whereas the proton conductivity and water uptake were not, as shown in Fig. 2.

The properties of the SPP derivatives have been reported by many research groups. Zhang et al. directly introduced a sulfonic acid group onto the 2,5-dichlorobenzophenone monomer to get sodium 3-(2,5-dichlorobenzoyl)benzenesulfonate (DCBS), and copolymerized it with the precursor or some functional dichloro-imide monomers via nickel-catalyzed coupling.71–73Scheme 15 lists the chemical structures of their copolymers. Compared to the ionomers obtained by post-sulfonation, these SPP derivatives could be prepared by a one-pot method, and the target IEC value could also be precisely controlled by adjusting the molar ratios of the monomers. The proton conductivity was also 2–3 times greater for P9-70 (refers to 70% DS) than that of Nafion® 117 in the hydrate state.

Researchers from the JSR Corp., Japan, extensively investigated the sulfonated 1,4-phenylene monomers for PP-based multiblock copolymers (JSR membrane, P11).74 Since the JSR electrolyte polymer has been designed with a rigid structure with a high water resistance, it is expected to have a 20–50% higher conductivity than the fluorinated membrane of Nafion® 112 based on the results (Fig. 3). Anyway, the exact chemical structure of their hydrophobic moiety was unpublished due to industrial concerns.

Recently, Chen et al. prepared a series of SPP-co-PAEK copolymers by the coupling of two reactive functional monomers, 2,5-dichloro-3′-sulfobenzophenone and 2,2′-bis[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)]phenoxyl perfluoropropane (P12 in Scheme 16).75 A similar sulfonated poly(p-phenylene-co-aryl ether ketone) based on the benzonitrile group (P13Scheme 16) was also recently designed.76 Strong interactions were found between the “–CN” and water molecules or other polar groups by an amorphous cell module simulation (Fig. 4), thus resulting in the decrease of the WU values and dimensional changes.

Novel sulfonated ionomers were developed utilizing poly(phenylene ether ketone) (PPEK) (segment 1) and a totally sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (segment 2) as the backbones and graft pendants, respectively.77 The synthetic route is shown in Scheme 17. The condensation reaction occurred between the functional fluorine group in segment 1 and the phenoxide-terminated groups in segment 2, and thus formed the graft cross-linked (GC, P14) architecture. The swelling state was anisotropic with some larger size changes in the thickness direction. It is worth noting that the membranes showed a good proton conductive behavior with σ⊥/σ‖ (proton conductivity through-plane/in-plane) values in the range of 0.65–0.92. Considering the real proton conducting state in a fuel cell system, the evaluation of the anisotropic proton conduction ratio was quite essential and should be used as a rule for future membrane characterizations.

A series of fully rigid-rod aromatic polysulfonic acids based on biphenyl backbones was prepared by Litt et al.63,64 A cross-linking reaction occurred in the presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) to form a network structure with a sulfone linkage (Fig. 5). The cross-linking degree was controlled by varying the reaction time and temperature. The IEC value of their membrane (P15) was extremely high (8.0 mequiv. g−1), which would be the highest value among the reported literature on sulfonated PEMs. However, all the films showed elastic moduli between 0.8 and 2.2 GPa with a break at 6 to 9% elongation at 22 to 30% RH. The proton conductivity was 4 to 5 times higher than that of Nafion® over the entire RH range from 20 to 90%. Also, the through-plane proton conductivity was measured as a function of the RH. The data showed a conductivity of nearly 0.1 S cm−1 under 120 °C/30% RH conditions, which reached the US Department of Energy (US DOE) 2015 target.

3.2 Mechanical properties
Mechanical stability is the key factor in determining the membrane strength and durability. Tensile stress (TS) is one of the conventional applied approaches to evaluate the membrane deformation resistance. Quite encouraging results were found on typical SPP-70 (P9), which exhibited a high storage modulus of over 2.0 GPa and loss modulus of over 0.2 GPa at temperatures ranging from 100–450 °C. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of the dry and hydrated membranes were more than 79 MPa and 20 MPa, and 1.7 GPa and 0.5 GPa, respectively, which indicated that these SPP membranes were strong and tough enough for fuel cell applications, even with a high DS.71
Nevertheless, it is considered that a polymer with backbones fully composed of phenyl–phenyl bonds tends to be brittle under high temperature conditions, even if the MW is high enough. The membranes usually show excellent tensile stress with a rather low elongation, which would bring some difficulties in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication. Therefore, much research is focused on SPP derivatives containing flexible linkages. By introducing the poly(arylene ether ketone) moiety, the JSR membrane (P11) shows an elastic modulus of 1.8 GPa, a tensile stress at yield of 83 MPa, a tensile stress at break of 130 MPa, and an elongation at break of 100%, exceeding the perfluorinated membrane by 10 times in elastic modulus and 2.6 times in tensile strength.74 Not surprisingly, based on a PPEK polymer main chain and SPAES side chain, the GC membranes also exhibited a reasonably high mechanical strength with Young's modulus, maximum stress and elongation at break values that ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 GPa, 31–49 MPa and 11–28%, respectively, under 25 °C/50% RH conditions.77
Generally, the tensile stress measurement is useful to evaluate the membrane deformation ability, especially during a hot-press procedure as well as the hydration–dehydration cycles in a fuel cell test. Therefore, the membrane with reinforced chemical structure tends to be an ideal material since it can effectively suppress the dimensional change.
Meanwhile, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is also an insightful parameter which reflects the membrane creep resistance and glass transition temperature under varied conditions. Similarly, almost all the PPs exhibited E′ (storage modulus) and E′′ (loss modulus) values of greater than 1.0 GPa and 1.0 MPa,55,71,73,74 respectively, indicating good potential for high temperature and humidity operation.

3.3 Morphological studies
The morphologies of SPP and its derivatives have been extensively investigated. The structural anisotropy of the P1 membranes was elucidated by Rikukawa et al. via polarized microscope measurements. P1, with IEC values of 1.59–2.81 mequiv. g−1, showed typical colored nematic textures in a DMSO solution (Fig. 6), indicating a molecular organization of a rigid-rod lamellar structure, resulting in an anisotropic behavior during swelling.82

The morphologies of the SPPs have also been characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). These techniques provide direct visualization of the phase separation and the presence of ionic clusters in the membrane. For the polybenzophenone-based SPPs (P9), they showed ionic domains with sizes in the range of 10–30 nm, and the width increased with an increase in the IEC values, as shown in Fig. 7.71

Researchers from the JSR Corp. comprehensively introduced 4 strategies to control the film morphology:69 (1) the mass ratio between the sulfonated and non-sulfonated moiety; (2) the chemical structure of the hydrophilic block; (3) the lengths of each block; and (4) the film casting conditions. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, the desired morphologies were obtained as designed according to these parameters. The phase separation was clearly found for all of the membranes. The strip-like hydrophilic domains were well-connected to each other, and the aggregation became more obvious with an increase in block length ((a) vs. (c); (b) vs. (d)).

It is interesting to study the morphology of a unique SPP derivative with densely located sulfonic acid groups.79 Although the IEC value was as low as 1.21 mequiv. g−1, it still exhibited a well-defined microphase-separated structure with ca. 13–20 nm and 3–7 nm widths for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, respectively (Fig. 9). This approximate isotropic phase separation would be one piece of direct evidence for the obtained high electrochemical performance, which will be discussed in the following section.

AFM has also been employed under various humidic conditions. Chen et al. used tapping-mode (TM) AFM to characterize the morphological positions of both ionic domains in their GC (P14) membranes,77 as shown in Fig. 10. A well-defined nanoscale phase separation morphology was observed for all the obtained GC membranes. Membrane P14(7/10) (x/y, referring to the molar ratio of two dichloro-monomers and the length of the hydrophilic block moiety) with a low IEC (1.26 mequiv. g−1) exhibited a distinct phase separated morphology. The average width of the hydrophilic domains was about 25–35 nm, larger than that of Nafion® exposed to liquid water.83 These discrepancies in the phase separations were closely related to the block length of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic units, as claimed by the authors.

Fig. 11 shows the AFM phase and current images of P5 membranes. Evidently, clear phase separations were observed for all the membranes. In both the phase and current images, the P5 membranes showed sphere-like hydrophobic aggregates surrounded by connected hydrophilic conducting domains. The aggregates became larger with increasing IEC values, which were in good accordance with the proton transport behavior.45

3.4 Chemical stability
In most cases, the chemical stability of the SPPs and derivatives were estimated by accelerated ex situ tests, such as the oxidative test. As it has been recognized that the formation and reactivity of free radical peroxide species are a major source of the degradation of the PEMs used in fuel cells, the oxidation test (so-called Fenton's test), using a H2O2 aqueous solution containing a trace amount of Fe2+, has become a common accelerated test for membrane oxidative stability.84–86 In general, there are two methods: (1) by recording the elapsed time at which the membranes started to dissolve and completely dissolved in the solution; and (2) by the remaining weight of the residues after a certain time period. Table 3 summarizes the reported chemical stabilities of the SPPs and derivatives based on Fenton's test. It should be mentioned that polyphenylenes with pendant sulfonic acid groups were more stable toward peroxide oxidation than the backbone-sulfonated PEMs. For instance, by comparison with a well-developed multiblocked poly(arylene ether sulfone) (e.g., a typical membrane X15Y4 with an IEC of 2.01 mequiv. g−1; X, Y refer to the sulfonated “F-terminated” and “OH-terminated” oligomers, respectively; numbers refer to the chain length by calculation) which was completely dissolved in the aqueous solution,87 a polyphenylene with long sulfoalkyl side chains (e.g., P7, IEC = 2.93 mequiv. g−1) still retained nearly 70% of the residual weight, indicating its excellent oxidation stability. Since it is widely considered that the electron-donating groups (–O–) in the ortho- and para-positions to the sulfonic acid group would stabilize the intermediate (so-called σ-complex, taken from the ab initio calculations), and thus lead to a lower oxidative stability,88–90 the pendant sulfonated side chains would effectively avoid radical-attack degradation.

Nevertheless, this method faces a limitation since there is sometimes a big discrepancy between the test results and the durability of the membranes during PEMFC operation.91,92 It is well accepted that perfluorosulfonic acid membranes afford an excellent chemical stability in Fenton’s reagent, over hundreds to thousands of hours, however, they usually show a much shorter lifetime in fuel cell applications. This rather poor correlation has been explained by the following considerations.93 Generally, there is a complex combination of different degradation processes for PEMs in fuel cells which are strongly influenced by the membrane itself, and its fabrication and operating conditions. The peroxide/radical degradation of Fenton's test cannot be the only measurement for the membrane lifetime prediction. On the one hand, the peroxide content in an accelerated Fenton's test is too high to compare with typical fuel cell operating conditions. On the other hand, a direct lifetime comparison among the different types of membranes is almost impossible when different fuel cell operating conditions are applied. The most significant key issue is that the gas permeation should be taken into consideration. Since the concentration of radicals in the MEAs partly depends on the gas permeability of the membranes, this parameter needs to be evaluated at the same time. Consequently, a sufficient understanding of the degradation of hydrocarbon membranes, especially of the SPPs and derivatives, still needs further study using different evaluation methods.
As for AEMs, hydroxide ion conductivities and stabilities are also the important physico-chemical properties, since they may directly determine the electro-performance in the fuel cell. The aforementioned DAQAPPs,60 both for random and block copolymers, exhibited rather high “–OH” conductivities ranging from 30–50 mS cm−1 with an IEC value of 1.2–1.6 mequiv. g−1, which were greater than some of the well-developed poly(sulfone)-based AEMs.94 This might be attributed to the irregularities of the polyphenylene backbone and bulky side groups which would effectively prevent the packing state in the polymer matrix. A comparison was done, comprised of different cationic substituted groups,61 as shown in Fig. 12. Quaternary ammonium groups with only a benzylic methylene spacer to the polymer backbone showed the best durability with a mere 5% conductivity loss over two weeks in an alkali solution. This trend is also consistent with that in quaternized poly(2,6-dimethyl phenylene oxide)s; the shorter carbon chains result in better stabilities.7

4 Electrochemical device applications
4.1 PEM H2/O2 fuel cells (PEMFC)
Cell performance is the most important in situ test for evaluating the electrochemical properties of PEMs in a fuel cell system. Although based on a high fuel crossover, PFSA ionomers have been used in most cases, even in new generation fuel cell vehicles, otherwise the electrode performance is not very good.
However, studies of the H2/O2 PEMFC performance based on a typical sulfonated polybenzophenone are also rather limited. The first report about the SPP-based H2/O2 fuel cell was published by Bae's group.43 They characterized the I–V polarization curve of P1 (sulfonation level 65%) at 80 °C using a commercial Pt/C electrode (E-TEK ELAT/Std. electrode, platinum loading of 0.4 mg cm−2). The RHs of the cathode and anode were maintained at 100% and the total pressure of both sides was kept at 3 atm. The obtained cell voltage at a 0.8 A cm−2 current density was 0.38 V with a maximum power output (Pmax) of only 300 mW cm−2. The reason for this low performance might be attributed to the relatively low proton conductivity of their membranes.
Most of the presented PEMFC studies focused on SPP derivatives. Okamoto et al. introduced the cell test for a series of imide-based block SPPs.78 Membrane P16 with a low IEC value of 1.51 mequiv. g−1 exhibited an acceptable PEMFC performance of Pmax = 0.76 mW cm−2 under the conditions of 90 °C, 80/80% RH (gas humidifier temperature of 85 °C), and 0.3 MPa. The high through-plane conductivity of P16 (66 mS cm−1 in water) contributed to this reasonably high performance.
Recently, Chen et al. reported the PEMFC performance of SPP-co-PAEKs membranes, as shown in Fig. 13.75 Under mild operation conditions (90 °C, 0.2 MPa, 82/68% RH), P12 showed an excellent PEM fuel cell performance with an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.94 V, a cell voltage at a current density of 1.0 A cm−2 (V1.0) of 0.61 V, and a Pmax of 0.85 W cm−2. The rigid poly(p-phenylene) linkages might make the hydrophilic moiety stack more tightly, resulting in a continuous proton conductive pathway and reasonably high cell performance.
 Fig. 13  Performance of PEMFCs with P12 and Nafion® 112 at 90 °C/0.2 MPa with a supply of H2–air and a gas humidification of (a) 82/68% RH, (b) 48/48% RH and (c) 27/27% RH.75 Reprinted with permission from ref. 75. Copyright 2012 Elsevier. 
Several extensive studies were pursued by Okamoto’s group.79,95,96P17 with a low IEC of 1.21 mequiv. g−1 showed a rather high cell performance at 90 °C, 0.2 MPa and 82/68% RH, i.e., a V0.5 of 0.72 V and a Pmax of >0.95 W cm−2. These results might be the highest level for an SPP and derivatives among the reported literature. Either a decrease in the gas pressure from 0.2 MPa to 0.1 MPa (ambient pressure) at 82/68% RH or a decrease in the gas humidification from 82/68% RH to 30% RH at 0.2 MPa caused a small reduction in the PEMFC performance. Another comparable result was for P14 (3/10) (Fig. 14);96 it showed a V0.5 of 0.75 V and a Pmax of 0.93 W cm−2 under the same operation conditions as mentioned above. It is worth noting that the V0.3 reached as high as 0.8 V, which just satisfies the U.S. DOE target for 2020 (0.8 V), whereas the Pmax still needs to be further improved (U.S. DOE, 1.0 W cm−2).97Fig. 15 shows the durability test for P14 (5/10) at 90 °C, 0.2 MPa and 50% RH under a constant load current density of 0.5 A cm−2, while monitoring the cell voltage and cell resistance. The cell voltage and OCV were held almost constant with only slight decreases (0.03–0.04 V) for 1000 h. Meanwhile, the polarization and power output curves changed with a slight reduction in the PEMFC performance that occurred by 640 h, but no further reduction after 1000 h. This fully hydrophobic polyphenylene structure as the polymer backbone effectively enhances the stability.

Miyatake et al. reported the cell performance of sulfonated polybenzophenone/poly(arylene ether) block copolymer membranes.81Fig. 16 shows their PEMFC and durability results. A reasonably good performance was obtained at a high RH (80 and 100% RH, 80 °C, and ambient pressure), however, the performance became worse with decreasing RH due to the rapid decrease in the proton conductivity. The cell voltage V0.5 decreased from 0.69 V (100% RH) to 0.39 V (40% RH) for membrane P19. The durability was also acceptable with an OCV decrease from 1.07 V (initial) to 0.94 V (after 1100 h). However, it is not easy to directly compare the PEMFC performance for this type of membrane to those of Okamoto's due to the different operating conditions regarding the cell temperature and RHs.

It is quite interesting to evaluate the PEMFC performance of high-IEC membranes.64 The authors stated that the very low elongation at break caused problems during the MEA fabrication; the membranes easily broke during the hot-press procedure. However, a low OCV of 0.84 V was obtained by a non-hot-pressed membrane, indicating the high gas permeation. Also, the voltage curve significantly dropped below 1.0 A cm−2, which was inferior to that of Nafion®. High IEC values did not reflect the high electrochemical performance due to the extremely swollen state of the membranes. The ex situ characterization might cause significant errors if the membrane sheets were too small, since dimensional changes were somewhat imperceptible under these conditions. However, the issue became more serious when the membranes underwent the fuel cell test. Too high IEC values caused non-neglectable large swellings, and they seemed to not be properly adopted as PEM materials in that situation.
The cell performance of the DA-SPPs were characterized by the Sandia National Laboratory.98 Under ideal conditions (100% RH and pure O2 as a cathode gas), membrane P6 with an IEC value of 2.3 mequiv. g−1 achieved 1.02 A cm−2 at 0.65 V, which was 15% less than that of Nafion® 212. Unfortunately, its performance rapidly decreased with a decreasing RH. The majority of the cell losses at a low RH were due to the dramatic decreases in the proton conductivity. Recently, the electrochemical properties were characterized by Kim et al. based on a series of DA-sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone)s (DA-SPPS, P20, see Scheme 20).52 A membrane with an IEC of 1.88 mequiv. g−1 exhibited a slightly higher cell performance than that of Nafion® over the entire range of current densities, and Pmax was roughly 0.69 W cm−2. DA-SPP and its derivatives showed a quite large RH dependence of PEMFC performance, with acceptable data under high RH conditions. Considering their low electrochemical capacities derived from low proton conductivities at a low RH, a morphological study was essential order to simultaneously explore the polymer structure effect. An overview comparison of data on PEMFC performance is summarized in Table 4 (the chemical structure of P21 is shown in Scheme 21).

The fuel cell performance of DAQAPP anionic membranes was recorded with a high catalyst loading of 3 mg cm−2 at 60 °C using H2 and O2 as fuels.99 A large amount of the Pt catalyst was used to minimize catalyst loss during the operation. A good performance was obtained with a Pmax of 205 mW cm−2 at a current density of 0.4 A cm−2 (Fig. 17). However, a difference was found in these polymers with different MWs; the membrane with the lower MW exhibited a much higher cell resistance which resulted in a much poorer electrochemical performance. The mechanical strength was maintained without any abrupt drop during the short-term test, however, the increase in cell resistance (300%) and current density loss (ca. 70%) indicated a degradation of the cation.

According to the mechanism of a fuel cell, it is desirable to use a high-IEC membrane, since sufficient functional groups can facilitate ion conduction as well as reduce cell resistance. However, these would consequentially raise the problem of excessive swelling, resulting in the detachment of catalyst layers. Meanwhile, the degradation always proceeds, especially when ion-rich polymers with electron-donating groups are used, as aforementioned. Therefore, medium-IEC membranes comprising a highly localized hydrophilic moiety and an indurative hydrophobic moiety would be the promising next generation electrolyte materials under real operating conditions.
4.2 Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)
The DMFC performance of SPP-based membranes was reported by Coutanceau's group, in which three typical polybenzophenone-typed SPPs were compared.42 The membrane P23 (Scheme 22), with a 5 times higher coefficient for methanol diffusion, still exhibited a better performance than the other two membranes (P3 in Scheme 3 and P22 in Scheme 22); the Pmax reached 22 mW cm−2 at 0.11 mA cm−2, whereas 10 and 15 mW cm−2 were obtained for the latter two. However, the data seem to be rather inferior to some other reported sulfonated ionomers.100–103 This might be ascribed to the very low conductivity of the as-prepared membrane. Only 8.5 mS cm−1 was recorded at 20 °C in the hydrate state, which was too low to obtain ideal electrochemical performance.
 Scheme 22  Chemical structures of P22 and P23.42 
Membrane electrode assemblies based on P6 ionomers were also tested using 1 M and 3 M of liquid methanol as the fuels.98 As shown in Fig. 18, no obvious difference was found for the power output in the high voltage and low current density region (>0.4 V, <0.1 A cm−2, 1 M MeOH) for all the membranes, however, the conductivity effect became apparent at higher current densities, indicating non-ignorable current times resistance losses (iR losses). The DMFC performance decreased with increasing methanol concentration to 3 M, which might be attributed to a greater fuel poisoning effect at the anode. Therefore, membranes with better methanol blocking capacities exhibited higher performances despite the IEC values. By calculating the membrane fuel crossover, a reduction in methanol permeability on the order of 75% was required to mitigate the poisoning effect in the DMFC, as concluded by the authors.

An acceptable DMFC performance at room temperature was obtained by Zhang's group with P13 copolymers,76 as shown in Fig. 19. With a supply of 4 M methanol to the anode and air to the cathode, the P13 (IEC = 1.86 mequiv. g−1) membrane showed a Pmax of 24.5 mW cm−2, which was comparable to that of Nafion® 117 (24.3 mW cm−1) under the same operating conditions. The performance of the P13 membranes could be attributed to their high selectivity factor.

Copyright 2014 Elsevier. 
On the one hand, the SPPs displayed a comparably low methanol permeation to some well-developed sulfonated ionomers,104,105i.e., a magnitude of 10−7, due to their rigid polymer skeletons. On the other hand, a not completely satisfactory performance was obtained. This might be due to the relatively low through-plane proton conductivities of these aforementioned polymers. Further studies regarding the proton conducting model of the DMFC system are also essential to understand the mass transfer mechanism.
Quite recently, a further improved DMFC performance was obtained for AEM (see Fig. 11, TMAC6PP) in the presence of hydroxide ions in the fuels.106 The highest Pmax of 53.8 mW cm−2 was generated in 1 M KOH at 226 mA cm−2, and the power output did not show much decrease with lowering the KOH concentration to 0.5 M (45.5 mW cm−2). However, a poor performance was found with a supply of highly concentrated alkali solution. On the one hand, a stoichiometric amount of “OH−” was needed for methanol oxidation; the ions could also flush out the carbonate formed in the electrode along with the reaction. But too high an “OH−” concentration in the fuels would inevitably increase the electrolyte viscosity and K2CO3 precipitation, as a result of pore obstruction and a dramatic rise in resistance. On the other hand, gas diffusion layer (GDL) materials were specifically applied with a hydrophilic anode and hydrophobic cathode. It has been demonstrated that the anode hydrophilicity would effectively enhance the MeOH diffusion, while the cathode hydrophobicity would prevent water flooding.107,108 Therefore, the choice of GDL should be another issue in future DMFC applications.
4.3 Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB)
Due to similar roles as a separator and ion carrier, PEMs, which were used in fuel cells, have been typically investigated for VRFB applications.109–114 The Sandia National Laboratory evaluated the VRFB performance of their P6 polymers.115 Although there seemed to be some limitations for these materials as fuel cell membranes, their VRFB properties were quite encouraging. Regardless of the IEC values, all samples showed good columbic efficiencies (CE) and energy efficiencies (EE) of greater than 92% and 88%, respectively. Regarding the durability, the sulfonation degree strongly affected the operating cycles. A higher IEC value resulted in a lower cycle number as well as a faster degradation rate, as shown in Fig. 20.
 Fig. 20  Durability screening test of P6 in V5+ solution.115 Reprinted with permission from ref. 115. Copyright 2012 Elsevier. 
Analogously, DAQAPP membranes were also studied in a VRFB. The VO2+ permeation rate was proportional to the membrane IEC value, while the cell performance showed an opposite result. High CE and EE values of 90–99% and 80–90% respectively were obtained for all the DAQAPPs, which were comparable or higher than that of Nafion® 212 (93 and 80%), as shown in Fig. 21. The durability of these ammonium functionalized membranes was found to be much better than that of the sulfonated ones (P6). Since the degradation largely depends on the IECs, the anionic membranes (low IEC values of 0.4–1.2 mequiv. g−1) exhibited no obvious oxidation and maintained their good shape over 2 weeks.116
 Fig. 21  Cycling efficiencies of DAQAPPs and Nafion® 212. (the IECs for DAQAPP1, DAQAPP2 and DAQAPP3 are 1.20, 0.80 and 0.40 mequiv. g−1, respectively).116 Reprinted with permission from ref. 116. Copyright 2014 Elsevier. 
Nowadays, the research on VRFB electrolytes shifts to not only the choice of materials themselves but also the morphological control, which is of crucial importance for the efficiency. Surface charging, compositing and pore size controlling (nanofiltration mode) were proven to make a great contribution to increasing the ion selectivity.117–120 It is believed that membranes with polyphenylene architectures will also have a bright future, coupled with these advanced technologies.
5 Summary and perspectives
As an important candidate for PEMs, polyphenylene and its derivatives are promising for the commercialization of PEMFCs. Significant progress has been made in the development of SPPs with superior overall performances during the past decade. These membranes also exhibited many advantages under the harsh operation conditions of acidic fuel cells due to their outstanding chemical stabilities. Recent achievements have been obtained with the polybenzophenone-based SPP derivatives. By chemical modification, the GC membranes (Chen's group) exhibited a distinct hydrophilic-hydrophobic microphase separation with a reasonably high proton conductivity and excellent PEMFC performance. The remarkable OCV and maximum power output values were 0.94 V and 0.46 W cm−2, respectively, even at 90 °C/30% RH, under ambient pressure.
Concerning the future prospects for SPP related materials, their cost also needs to be taken into consideration. Although the cost of hydrocarbon monomers is quite low, the preparation of very complicated polymer structures or noble metal catalysts will inevitably increase the manufacturing costs. Meanwhile, post-sulfonation needs to be avoided due to the use of an excessive amount of halogenated solvents, long reaction times as well as some problems with acid-treatment.121 Sulfonated monomers are preferred so that more approaches can be applied for molecular design, however, a high purity is indeed required in order to obtain a polymer with a high MW. Durability would be another issue since more and more attention is being paid to practical fuel cell applications. The aforementioned GC ionomers and polybenzophenone-based main chain type SPPs (Miyatake's group) have undergone over a thousand hours of fuel cell durability testing. JSR membranes even showed endurance under rigorous conditions (110 °C, 50% RH) for over 1000 h. Nevertheless, current progress is still far from the target set by the U.S. DOE milestone 2015 (with a power degradation of less than 20%, and durability over 5000 h).
Studies of PP-based AEMs are also interesting, since many SPP derivatives have already been used in the PEMFC system. The current state is quite encouraging with a power output comparable to some commercial AEMs. Future work should emphasize stability research, including the degradation mechanism.
The possibility for PP derivatives to be used as VRFB membranes is more promising due to the stable phenyl–phenyl bond which could survive under the highly oxidative operating conditions. Similar to the situation of PEMFCs, the durability is still a limiting factor for commercialization, although the ex situ performance is rather good. With scaling up to cell stacks, membrane swelling will become another important issue. Future detailed studies on the mass transfer mechanism and capacity fading during VRFB operation are highly demanded.
In conclusion, it is rather difficult to design or expect just a single type of PP derivative to meet all the requirements for electrochemical device applications. What is needed for future improvements relies on omnifarious efforts, including membranes, catalysts, a transport modeling study, technical assessments, etc.
