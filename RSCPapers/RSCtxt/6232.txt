    , Accepted 20th May 2013First published on 21st May 2013AbstractIn this study, a prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofiber (HTF) was synthesized via an electrospinning method followed by a template-free alkali hydrothermal process and calcination. It was found that dense nanotube prickle-like branches were grown on the HTF with a surface area of up to 154 m2 g−1 and this was ∼4.3 times larger than that of the pure electrospun TiO2 nanofiber (TNF). When applied in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), the highest power conversion efficiency (7.86%) was achieved using a HTF-based bi-layer device. This result was ∼26% higher than that achieved using the TNF-based bi-layer device (6.24%). The significant improvement in DSSC efficiency was investigated using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Examining the results of these measurements, we attribute the improvement to the hierarchical structure of HTF, as it results in greater dye loading and better light scattering, leading to higher light harvesting, as well as faster electron transport and less charge recombination, resulting in a higher charge collection efficiency.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) developed by Grätzel and O'Regan have been studied as easily processed, potentially regenerative and low-cost energy conversion devices in recent decades.1,2 Typically, the working electrode of a DSSC is made of a TiO2 nanoparticle (∼20 nm diameter) mesoporous film on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass and a monolayer of a ruthenium-base complex dye is usually absorbed to its surface. While the power conversion efficiency of a nanoparticle-based DSSC has exceeded 12%,3 the conversion efficiency is still limited. This is in part because the photoexcited electrons that pass through the high surface area nanoparticle-based photoanode are strongly influenced by surface trapping/detrapping effects that arise from grain boundaries, inter-particle connections and surface states. This leads to slow electron transport and an enhancement of the recombination probability.4,5
One-dimensional (1-D) nanostructured (e.g. nanotubes and nanorods) TiO2 materials have been synthesized using various approaches including the template modified sol–gel method,5,6 electrochemical anodization,7,8 and hydrothermal processing.9,10 These 1-D TiO2 structures can be used as potential photoanode materials for DSSCs, and are recognized as effective pathways for the facilitation of electron transport and minimization of the recombination rate, resulting in an improvement of the charge collection efficiency.
Recently, electrospinning has attracted much attention because it provides a cost-effective, versatile and simple way to fabricate 1-D nanostructured TiO2 materials in a continuous process, and can be directly deposited on various substrates within a short period of processing time.11,12 Due to its inherent adaptability and applicability, the electrospinning technique has also been applied to energy conversion and storage device applications.13 Several research groups have used the electrospinning technique to fabricate photoanodes of DSSCs.14–17 In practice, even though an efficient electron transport rate in 1-D nanostructures is available, the performance of these 1-D TiO2-based DSSCs is still poor. This is mainly due to the smooth surface, leading to low dye adsorption and lower porosity, as well as poor light harvesting. Hence, some methods for preparing large surface area 1-D nanostructured TiO2 materials have been reported.18,19 In our previous report, electrospun wormhole-like mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanofibers were also synthesized using ionic liquid as the template and applied in a DSSC. It was found that the as-prepared mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanofibers provided a higher surface area for dye loading and fast electron transport, resulting in an improvement in the power conversion efficiency.20
Apart from greater dye loading and efficient electron transport, there are other key factors to improve the performance of DSSCs, such as the effective utilization of the near infrared region (600–800 nm). However, these factors are usually incompatible with one another. To optimize the overall effect, 1-D hierarchically structured materials have been designed recently for use as photoanode materials. These studies showed that 1-D backbones with a hierarchical nanostructure not only provide effective pathways for fast electron transport, but also greatly enhance the light harvesting, which is mainly attributed to the high surface area and superior light scattering effect, making them promising photoanode materials for improving the power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs.21–24 Nair et al. reported an enhanced power conversion using highly anisotropic titanates prepared from electrospun TiO2/SiO2 composite nanostructures by combining the structural rearrangement of TiO2 and the in situ leaching effect of SiO2 in an alkali environment.25 In addition, the combination of the electrospinning process with hydrothermal treatment has also been reported to obtain 1-D hierarchically heterostructured TiO2/metal oxide materials.26 However, the hierarchical anatase TiO2 1-D nanostructures prepared by the combination method and its application for DSSCs have not been reported. In this study we synthesize template-free prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofibers by this facile route. The characterization and the effect of the prickle-like hierarchical structure of the anatase TiO2 nanofiber-based photoanode on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC were investigated in detail.
2 Experimental section
All purchased chemicals were not further purified in this study. Briefly, a Ti-precursor sol was prepared with 1 mL titanium tetraisopropoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mL of 2-propanol (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mL glacial acetic acid (≥99.85%, Sigma-Aldrich). Another solution was prepared by dissolving 0.43 g poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 1300000 g mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 mL of 2-propanol at room temperature, separately. These two solutions were then mixed at room temperature for 1 h to give a viscous transparent spinnable TiO2 sol. Subsequently, the spinnable TiO2 sol was loaded in a plastic syringe equipped with a 24-gauge stainless steel needle and an electrical potential of 20 kV was applied by a high-voltage power supply (You-Shang Technical Corp., Taiwan). The fluid rate was controlled at 0.9 mL h−1 using a syringe pump (Model 100, KD Scientific) and the working distance was fixed at 10 cm to collect the TiO2/PVP composite nanofibers. Thereafter, the PVP was removed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 1 h to obtain the anatase TiO2 nanofiber (TNF).
The prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofiber was prepared by the alkali hydrothermal treatment from TNF as follows. 0.1 g of the as-prepared TNF was mixed with 20 mL of 10 M NaOH(aq.) solution and stirred for 10 min, then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave to carry out the hydrothermal process at 150 °C for 12 h. After the hydrothermal treatment, the Na+ ions contained in the sample were removed by ion exchanging with a 0.1 M HCl(aq.) solution, washing with DI water, and filtering out the solvent. The filtered sample was dried at 70 °C in an electric oven overnight and then further calcined in air at 450 °C for 1 h to obtain the prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofiber (HTF).
DSSC fabrication
For application in DSSCs, the paste of TNF (or HTF) was prepared as follows. 0.1 g of the TNF (or HTF) powder was dispersed in 5 mL ethanol under ultrasonication for 10 min and added to 0.5 g hydroxypropyl cellulose (Mw = 8000 g mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a viscous paste. The TiO2 paste was coated onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate (TCO22-15, 15 Ω □−1, Solaronix) using a doctor-blade and subsequently annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. For preparation of the bi-layer photoanode, commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) and TNF (or HTF) were utilized as the lower and upper material, respectively, with the same procedure as mentioned above. All the photoanodes prepared were treated with a 40 mM TiCl4(aq.) solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then washed with ethanol and annealed again at 500 °C for 30 min. After they were cooled to 80 °C, the TiO2 films were sensitized by immersing them in an acetonitrile–tert-butanol solution (1:1, v/v) containing 0.3 mM cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Solaronix), at room temperature for 24 h. The TiO2 film electrodes were further rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and dried in an oven at 100 °C to obtain the final TiO2 film electrodes. The electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN). The dye-adsorbed TiO2 film electrode and the platinized FTO counter electrode were assembled with a hot-melt film spacer (Surlyn® SX-1170-25, Solaronix) to form a space. The electrolyte was filled into the space to obtain the corresponding sandwiched DSSC cell. In the remainder of this report, the single-layered and the bi-layered DSSC cells will be denoted as NP-D (nanoparticle-based DSSC), TNF-D (TNF-based DSSC), HTF-D (HTF-based DSSC) and BTNF-D (nanoparticle/TNF-based DSSC), BHTF-D (nanoparticle/HTF-based DSSC), respectively. The optimization thicknesses of the TiO2 films were experimentally controlled and an opaque mask was placed on the cell to obtain ∼0.25 cm2 of the active area during the photovoltaic measurement.
Characterization and measurements
Wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction (WXRD) patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, PW3040/60, Philip) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a generator voltage of 45 kV and generator current of 40 mA to investigate the crystalline phase of the TiO2 samples over angles ranging from 15° to 70°. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) calculated average pore size and pore volume of the TiO2 samples were obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms measured by the surface and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Tristar 3000) at 77 K. The samples were degassed and dried under a vacuum system at 120 °C for 12 h prior to measurement. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7600F, JOEL) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM 2100, JOEL) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV were used to investigate the surface morphologies and microstructure of the TiO2 samples.
Photovoltaic characterization
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a potentiostat (PGSTAT30, Metrohm Autolab B.V.) and illuminated under AM 1.5 G conditions using the solar simulator (XES-40S1, San Ei). The standard incident irradiance intensity (100 mW cm−2) was adjusted with a calibrated mono-crystalline Si reference solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter (PV Measurements, Inc.). To determine the amount of dye loading on the TiO2 film, the dye was desorbed from the TiO2 photoanode film in a solution of 0.1 M NaOH in H2O–EtOH (1/1, v/v). The absorption spectra of the dye desorbed solution and reflectance spectra of the TiO2 films were measured using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (V655, Jasco). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected over the wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm using a commercial IPCE system (QE-mini, Enli Technology Co., Ltd). Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out to determine the electron transport characteristics. For IMPS/IMVS measurements, the solar cells were illuminated under a green LED (λ = 520 nm), in which the amplitude of the AC light modulation was 10% of the DC light intensity and was adjusted with a calibrated Si photodiode (THORLABS). For EIS, the bias potential was set at an open circuit with an AC potential amplitude of 10 mV under an AM 1.5 G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The IMPS/IMVS and EIS spectra were recorded using a potentiostat equipped with FRA2 (frequency response analyzer 2), and the frequencies ranged from 10 k to 0.1 Hz and 100 k to 0.05 Hz, respectively. All of the impedance spectra were fitted using appropriate equivalent circuit models built in the Z-View software.
3 Results and discussion
Characterization of the hierarchical TiO2 nanofibers
Prickle-like hierarchical TiO2 nanofibers were synthesized through a simple electrospinning method followed by the facile template-free alkali hydrothermal route under various conditions and it was found that the best one, HTF, was obtained under 150 °C for 12 h. SEM images of the surface morphologies of the TiO2 nanofibers hydrothermally treated under 150 °C for various time periods are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a and b show that the TNF exhibits a smooth surface closely packed by nanocrystals with average diameters of 100–250 nm, while Fig. 1c–n indicate that the morphology of the hydrothermal processed sample varied with the reaction time. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, with 2 h reaction, sheet-like nanostructure branches were formed on the surface of TNF, but when the reaction time was increased to 6 h (Fig. 1e and f) and 12 h (Fig. 1g and h), the sheet-like nanostructured branches were gradually transformed to prickle-like hierarchical nanostructures with ∼10 nm average diameter and several nanometers length. However, as the reaction time was increased to 18 h, 24 h and 48 h, the prickle-like hierarchical nanostructure was further transformed to a ribbon-like nanostructure with a smooth surface, as observed in Fig. 1i–n. Also, the morphology change of the 1-D nanostructure of TNF hydrothermally treated for 12 h under various reaction temperatures was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S1,† with the 90 °C treatment little change was observed on the surface of TNF, while with the 110 °C treatment the sheet-like nanostructure branches grown on the TNF surface were observed. As the temperature was increased to 150 °C TNF became a prickle-like hierarchical nanostructure, but as the temperature increased to 170 °C it became ribbon-like, as that obtained under 150 °C for 48 h. These images indicate that HTF, obtained at 150 °C for 12 h, exhibited a higher surface area than the other hydrothermally treated TiO2 nanofibers and would be most suitable for application in DSSCs. The possible mechanism for the morphology transformation of HTF during the hydrothermal process is proposed below.

Fig. 2 shows the wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction (WXRD) patterns of TNF, uncalcined HTF and HTF. After the PVP polymer was removed by calcination, the TNF obtained was transformed into the anatase crystalline phase (JCPDS #21-1272). When TNF was reacted under an alkali hydrothermal environment at 150 °C for 12 h followed by an ion-exchange process, the peaks of the anatase phase disappeared from the pattern of uncalcined HTF. Instead, broad peaks at 2θ = 10°, 24°, 29° and 48° were found, and are assigned to the hydrogen titanate crystalline structure.27–29 However, as can be seen, after calcination the hydrogen titanate crystalline structure was converted back to the pure anatase phase for HTF.

In order to learn about the porous microstructure and interior morphologies of HTF, TEM and BET measurements were performed. Typical TEM images are displayed in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, TNF was closely packed with TiO2 nanocrystals, as observed in the SEM image (Fig. 1b). Fig. 3c indicates that after the hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 12 h and calcination, a branched prickle-like hierarchical nanofiber structure was obtained. Furthermore, in Fig. 3d, the magnified image of HTF shows that the prickle-like hierarchical branches grown on the backbone of the TiO2 nanofiber were nanotubes with ∼3.5 nm inner diameter. The images shown in the inset are the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the nanofibers. Both the polycrystalline diffraction rings in the insets confirm that the TNF and HTF samples were in the anatase phase, as indicated by the XRD results.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of TNF, uncalcined HTF and HTF, are presented in Fig. 4. According to the IUPAC classification,30 both the HTF and TNF samples exhibited a type-IV isotherm, indicating that both were typical mesoporous materials. Furthermore, the H3 and H2 hysteresis loop for the HTF and TNF, respectively, that occurred at relatively high pressures (Fig. 4a) reveal that the slit-like mesopores of HTF formed by the prickle-like hierarchical nanostructure were more irregular than the ink-like mesopores of TNF. The BJH pore size distribution curves shown in the inset of Fig. 4a indicate that TNF had a broad pore size distribution. The pores were mainly the voids formed by the closely packed nanocrystals. In contrast, the BJH pore size distribution of the uncalcined HTF exhibits extra sharp peaks at ∼3.3 nm, representing the average inner diameter of the nanotubes grown on the fiber backbone. However, for HTF, the sharp peak was maintained but with a smaller inner diameter (∼3.1 nm), suggesting that the tubular structure was dehydrated to a certain extent during the calcination process.31Fig. 4b indicates that the BET specific surface area of the TiO2 nanofiber obtained at 150 °C was increased as the hydrothermal reaction time increased from 2 h to 12 h then gradually decreased as it further increased to 48 h, while that of the TiO2 nanofiber obtained with 12 h hydrothermal reaction was increased as the temperature increased from 90 °C to 150 °C and then decreased at 170 °C. The decrease of the surface area is ascribed to the increase of the amount of smooth ribbon-like structures formed. The largest surface area (∼154 m2 g−1) obtained was from HTF and was ∼4.3 times larger than that from TNF (∼36 m2 g−1). These results are consistent with the corresponding morphologies indicated in the FE-SEM and TEM images discussed above. Therefore, it is anticipated that HTF would have the most potential as a material for a DSSC photoanode and was used for the rest of the study.

Since the simple hydrothermal treatment of crystalline TiO2 particles with NaOH aqueous solutions was reported by Kasuga et al.,32,33 many other hydrothermal studies have been reported. Nevertheless, much debate on the formation mechanism of the 1-D nanostructure and crystallite phase is still under discussion.34–37 To elucidate the formation of the hierarchical nanostructure obtained in this study, a possible mechanism is proposed and shown in Fig. 5 according to the FE-SEM and TEM results. First, the partial nanocrystals on the TNF surface were dissolved in the sodium hydroxide solution and the layered sodium titanate nanosheets were formed during the specified hydrothermal condition. Thereafter, the nanosheets were gradually curved and scrolled to form the nanotube prickle-like hierarchical structure. However, as the reaction time was longer (≧18 h), the TiO2 materials were gradually dissolved and recrystallized to form ribbon nanostructures, as suggested elsewhere.38,39

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
HTF was used as a photoanode material in order to study the effect of the high surface area on the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC. These results were compared with that of TNF. As is known, the photocurrent is strongly related to the amount of dye loading and the light scattering ability of the photoanode, since this influences the light harvesting and thereby the power conversion efficiency. Fig. 6a shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the TNF, HTF and NP photoanode films without dye adsorbed. These spectra were used to estimate their light scattering abilities. Obviously, the HTF film possessed a higher reflectance than the NP and TNF films in the whole visible region (400–800 nm), implying that the intrinsic properties of HTF's unique hierarchical structure reflected the sunlight within the photoanode more efficiently and would benefit the light harvesting efficiency more.

Furthermore, Fig. 6b indicates the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the solutions containing the N719 dye desorbed from the dye-absorbed photoanodes. The larger dye loading was obtained from the HTF-based photoanode (1.31 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and was ∼4 and ∼2.1 times higher than that from the TNF-based (0.34 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and NP-based (0.64 × 10−7 mol cm−2) photoanodes, respectively. This trend is consistent with the corresponding surface area values obtained from the BET measurements discussed above.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the various DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As is indicated, TNF-D had a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 8.6 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.755 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.63 with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.09%. A Jsc of 10.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.730 V, FF of 0.63 and η of 4.98% were obtained for NP-D. The higher Jsc and η for NP-D than that for TNF-D is mainly attributed to the larger surface area of NP-D. Surprisingly, even though HTF exhibited a larger amount of dye loading and better light scattering ability, the Jsc, Voc, FF and η of HTF-D obtained were 9.2 mA cm−2, 0.749 V, 0.58 and 3.98%, respectively, which was lower than expected. This can be reasoned by the cross-section SEM image shown in Fig. S2(a).† The voids were formed in the HTF photoanode, resulting in a poor interface contact with the FTO conducting substrate. The formation of the voids is attributed to the shrinking during the calcination process due to the special hierarchical branch structure of HTF. Consequently, the high resistance of electron transport and low charge collection resulted. To overcome this problem, a NP-based layer was applied beneath the HTF (or TNF) layer to form photoanodes with a bi-layer architecture, as reported.40 The J–V curves of the bi-layer photoanode-based DSSCs shown in Fig S3† indicated that the best performance was obtained from the HTF/NP bi-layer photoanode-based DSSC, BHTF-D. As listed in Table 1, the addition of the NP layer resulted in a significant improvement of η (7.86%) and Jsc (16.2 mA cm−2) in BHTF-D, which were ∼26% and ∼20% higher than that of BTNF-D, respectively. The enhancement of Jsc and η of BHTF-D is ascribed to the fewer and smaller voids being formed and the reduced contact interface resistance due to the presence of the denser NP layer, which had better contact with FTO, as shown in Fig. S2(b).† This assisted in reducing the shrink during the calcination, as well as the higher dye loading and better light scattering ability of the upper layer indicated in Fig. 6.

Fig. 7b shows the IPCE spectra of the various DSSC devices. The IPCE values of the one-layer nanofiber-based devices, TNF-D and HTF-D, were less than that of NP-D over the whole range, while that of the bi-layer devices BTNF-D and BHTF-D, were even higher than that of NP-D, especially in the longer wavelength range of 600–750 nm. The IPCE value is determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 film, while the efficiency of electron injection and charge collection efficiency are strongly affected by the morphology of the TiO2 material. Therefore, the highest IPCE value over the wide range of 400–750 nm obtained from BHTF-D implies that the incident light was utilized most effectively by its electrode, leading to the highest Jsc and η. This is mainly attributed to the better light scattering ability and larger surface area of the HTF caused by its hierarchical structure, as well as the reduced contact interface resistance from introducing the lower nanoparticle layer. These IPCE results are consistent with the results of the J–V curves, UV-Vis absorbance and reflectance spectra discussed above.
Electron transport and recombination characteristics of the DSSCs
IMPS and IMVS measurements, which provide electron transport information,41–43 were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of the morphology of HTF on the efficiency of the corresponding DSSC devices. The transit time (τt,IMPS) and lifetime (τn,IMVS) of the photoelectrons travelling through the TiO2 film were calculated using the equations τt,IMPS = 1/(2πfIMPS,min) and τn,IMVS = 1/(2πfIMVS,min), respectively. Here fIMPS,min and fIMVS,min are the frequencies at the minimum imaginary component in the corresponding complex plots.42,43 The plots of the electron diffusion coefficient (De,IMPS) and τn,IMVS as a function of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) for the various devices are shown in Fig. 8. The corresponding De,IMPS was estimated using the equation De,IMPS = d2/(2.35τt,IMPS), where d is the thickness of the TiO2 film.44
 Fig. 8  Variation of (a) the electron diffusion coefficient (De,IMPS) and (b) the electron lifetime (τn,IMVS) of various DSSCs versus the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 8a, BHTF-D exhibited larger De,IMPS values than HTF-D under the same Jsc condition, confirming that the NP layer had better contact with the FTO substrate, providing large pathways to facilitate the electron transport. Furthermore, HTF-D showed the smallest De,IMPS, supporting the proposition that the electron transport was retarded due to poor interfacial contact with FTO. The lower De,IMPS value of NP-D, corresponding to the longer transport time, is mainly attributed to the presence of the rutile phase of the TiO2 nanoparticles and the circuitous routes created by the large grain boundaries of the TiO2 particles.4,45
From examining the IMVS results presented in Fig. 8b, the longest electron lifetime was found in TNF-D, indicating the smallest extent of back reaction with I3− due to the 1-D nanostructure of TNF. On the other hand, a relatively shorter electron lifetime in HTF-D than in TNF-D is also ascribed to the poor interface contact in HTF-D, increasing the probability of charge recombination with I3− near the surface areas of the FTO glass that were not well covered by HTF due to its unique shape, consequently decreasing the Voc. Furthermore, the electron lifetime of BHTF-D and BTNF-D was slightly shorter than that of HTF-D and TNF-D, respectively; that is, the lifetimes of the bi-layer devices were slightly shorter than that of the corresponding one-layer devices. This is because the electron recombination probability was increased when the electrons were transported through the NP layer due to surface states and multiple trapping/detrapping events.
To further elucidate the electron transport characteristics, the Nyquist impedance spectra of the five DSSCs under open circuit conditions and 100 mW cm−2 of solar illumination were measured, and are shown in Fig. 9a. Typically, from high to low frequency, the three semicircles in the Nyquist impedance spectra of the DSSCs correspond to (i) the combination of the charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte, FTO/electrolyte and FTO/TiO2 contact interfaces, (ii) electron transport resistance in the TiO2 mesoporous film, and (iii) diffusion resistance of I−/I3− in the electrolyte, respectively. To simulate and interpret the impedance spectra, an appropriate equivalent circuit of the corresponding transmission line model is suggested in Fig. 9b, where rt = Rt/L, rct = RctL and cμ = Cμ/L. Here Rs is the series resistance, including the sheet resistance of FTO and the contact resistance of the assembled cell; RFTO/TiO2 and CFTO/TiO2 are the resistance and the capacitance at the FTO/TiO2 contact, respectively; RFTO/electrolyte and CFTO/electrolyte are the charge-transfer resistance and the corresponding double-layer capacitance at the exposed FTO/electrolyte interface, respectively; Welectrolyte is the diffusion impedance of the redox species in the electrolyte; and RPt and CPt are the charge transfer resistance and interfacial capacitance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, respectively.46–48 From the equivalent circuit, the lifetime (τn,EIS) and transit time (τt,EIS) of electrons in the TiO2 film were calculated using τn,EIS = Rct × Cμ and τt,EIS = Rt × Cμ = L2/De,EIS, respectively, where Rt, Rct, Cμ, and L are the electron transport resistance in the TiO2 film, interfacial charge-transfer resistance related to recombination of the electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, chemical capacitance produced by the accumulation of electrons in the TiO2 film, and the TiO2 film thickness, respectively.48,49 The simulated data of the EIS results are listed in Table 2. As can be seen, the Rs of HTF-D was higher than that of the other devices. Since the differences in the Rs values of the devices prepared in this study are mainly caused by the differences in their FTO/TiO2 interfacial resistances, the larger Rs value for HTF-D is attributed to its poorer interfacial contact with FTO glass as discussed above, leading to a slower charge transport between HTF and FTO glass than the others. By contrast, the reduction of Rs and overall resistance in BHTF-D is attributed to its improved interfacial contact with FTO glass due to the addition of the NP. Besides, the Rt value of BHTF-D was much smaller than that of HTF-D, indicating that the electron transport resistance was much smaller in the HTF/NP bi-layer photoanode than that in the HTF photoanode. This is attributed to the presence of more and larger voids in the HTF photoanode than that in the bi-layer photoanode, as discussed above. These results led to a large improvement in the performance for BHTF-D.

In addition, the electron average diffusion length (Ln), was calculated from the equation Ln = (De,EIS × τn,EIS)1/2.48,49 This parameter is useful for estimating the competition between electron diffusion and recombination: if Ln > L, fewer electrons will be lost before collection. As listed in Table 2, the Ln value of BHTF-D was larger than that of the other devices, suggesting that a higher conversion efficiency would be expected.
On the other hand, it is also known that Jsc can be approximated by the following expression:50Jsc = qηlhηinjηcollI0where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency of a cell, which is commonly determined by the amount of adsorbed dye, ηinj is the charge injection efficiency, ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency, and I0 is the light intensity. Therefore, the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) is also an important index for the performance of DSSCs, and is determined by the competition between recombination and transport of electrons within the photoanode according to the equation ηcoll = 1 − (τt,EIS/τn,EIS).49Table 2 indicates that BHTF-D exhibited both the largest Ln and ηcoll, revealing that compared to the other devices it exhibited the highest Jsc and η. This result confirms that the bi-layer structure of BHTF-D, which had higher levels of light harvesting and effective electron transport, was most beneficial to the conversion efficiency of the DSSC in this study, and is consistent with the J–V performance and IPCE spectra shown above.
4 Conclusions
In summary, a prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofiber (HTF) with high surface area was prepared using the electrospinning technique, followed by the template-free alkali hydrothermal method under specific conditions, and then a calcination process. For application in DSSCs, the one-layer device, HTF-D, showed a slightly lower performance (3.98%) than TNF-D (4.09%) because of the poor contact at the HTF/FTO interface. However, the introduction of nanoparticles as a lower layer in a bi-layer HTF-based photoanode (BHTF-D), resulted in a ∼26% higher power conversion efficiency (7.86%) than the bi-layer TNF-based device, BTNF-D (6.24%). This increase is attributed to the reduced contact resistance, unique morphology of HTF, leading to more dye loading, higher light scattering ability, faster electron transport, and greater charge collection efficiency. It is believed that the prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanofibers also possess potential in other applications, such as Li-ion batteries, fuel cells, and photocatalysts.
