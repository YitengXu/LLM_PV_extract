    , Accepted 20th August 2014First published on 21st August 2014AbstractZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures were prepared by a simple and low-cost chemical precipitation method. The sample was characterised by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray, UV-Vis-NIR, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Morphology of the sample was studied by scanning electron microscopy and it was observed that ZnO nanoplates were covered with ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles. A high resolution transmission electron microscope was used to obtain further information about the crystalline domains of the prepared ternary nanostructure.

1 Introduction
Application of nanotechnologies to the environmental field could lead to a significant progress in science towards global wellbeing. Environmental catalysis is one of the most widely studied processes in order to not only reduce, but also prevent the causes of pollution or even create clean and sustainable energy; i.e. via sunlight driven water splitting for hydrogen generation by fabricating new materials like Pt-loaded TiO2 nanocrystals.1 Recently, attention has also been paid to bio-template structures, mimicking Nature,2 with the aim of fabricating new materials such as carbon nitride with a structure taken from the natural world.3
Among these catalytic processes, semiconductor photocatalysis is expected to be the one with an important role in the efforts of the 21st century for reducing environmental pollution.4 Among semiconductors, zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) are attracting more and more attention by the scientific community owing to their versatility. ZnO, a common n-type semiconductor with a wide direct band gap (Eg) of around 3.37 eV at room temperature, has been extensively studied because of its outstanding optical and electronic properties. Moreover, as an important type of inorganic nanoparticles, metal sulfide nanoparticles have been widely used in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), biological cells, and memory devices.4–9 Among the semiconductors, ZnS with an Eg of ∼3.66 eV can be used for in vivo bio-applications because of its low toxicity.5 Additionally, ZnS has been used for nonlinear optical devices, sensors, lasers, and flat display fields owing to its remarkable optical and electrical properties.10 However, the main disadvantage associated with ZnS is its wide Eg as well as low quantum yield (QY). To improve the QY of ZnS nanoparticles, it is advantageous to incorporate narrow Eg materials or metals as dopants and form a surface layer with any narrow Eg semiconductor or other materials in the form of core–shell particles.11–13
In general, size and composition of nanocrystals play an important role in Egs of semiconductor nanocrystals. However, size-dependent Eg will disappear when the nanocrystals are deposited and converted into a dense film, especially in solar cell applications.14,15
If the film's composition is not varying with the film thickness, then there is a linear relationship between the grain size and the film thickness. It may increase or decrease, but the band gap never changes in this case.16 Therefore, composition control is a more feasible route for the synthesis of semiconductor nanostructures with tunable Eg. Thus far, various ZnO-based semiconductors, heterostructures, have been explored, such as ZnO–CdS, ZnO–ZnS, ZnO–SnO2, ZnO–CuS, ZnO–Ag2S, and ZnO–ZnSe.17–22 Recently, silver sulfide (Ag2S) nanoparticles have attracted great attention due to their potential in many applications; i.e. photoconductors, solar cells, and near infrared photo-detectors.23 More importantly, Ag2S is less toxic than other nanoparticles, such as cadmium sulfide (CdS) and lead sulfide (PbS). A large volume of research has been conducted on nanostructured semiconductor materials as photocatalysts due to their enhanced catalytic efficiency. In fact, compared to the ones based on conventional bulk materials, nanostructured semiconductor materials can lead to more cost-effective and less time- and energy-consuming solutions.24
In this work, a simple and low-cost method was developed to synthesise ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures using a wet chemical precipitation method. Photocatalytic activity of the prepared nanostructures was studied considering NOx (NO and NO2) reduction by comparison with ZnO nanostructures using a solar lamp, which was apparently applied for the first time in the studied system. These pollutants led to different problems, such as photochemical smog, tropospheric ozone, ozone layer depletion, acid rain, and even global warming caused by NOx.25 It was found that photocatalyst stability can be highly improved via deposition of both ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO nanoplates.
2 Experimental
ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures were synthesised by a wet chemical precipitation method. First, 30 mmol of ZnCl2 (Aldrich, Germany) was dissolved in distilled water. Then, the obtained solution was added drop-wise to 100 mL of 1M NaOH (Merck, Germany) solution. The measured pH value of the resulting solution was approximately 13. Subsequently, 38 mmol Na2S was slowly added to the mixture and was left for 2 h under constant stirring. Finally, 1.5 mmol AgNO3 was added to this solution and vigorously stirred for 5 h. The resulting suspension was kept at room temperature for 1 h under mild magnetic stirring to yield ternary ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures. For comparison purposes, ZnO and ZnO–ZnS nanostructures were also prepared using the same method. But, Na2S and AgNO3 were not added to the solution in the last steps in order to get ZnO and ZnO–ZnS nanostructures, respectively. The as-prepared samples were collected after centrifugation and washed with distilled water for several times. The obtained nanoplates were collected and dried for 3 h at 80 °C. The structure, morphology, and chemical analysis of the samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu XRD-6000, Tokyo, Japan), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU-70, Hitachi), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A JEOL 2200FS (JP) high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), which was equipped with a field emission gun operated at 200 kV and a EDS detector (Inca, Oxford Instruments, UK), was used to further analyse the structure of the sample. Optical properties of the prepared samples were studied using UV-Vis-NIR (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 35), Raman (laser wavelength 1064 nm; laser power 350 mW), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bruker RFS/100).
Optical Eg of the components of the ternary nanostructure as well as of ZnO and ZnO–ZnS was evaluated via the Tauc procedure.26 Diffuse reflectance was converted into the absorption coefficient α using the Kubelka–Munk function:27 (1) The Tauc procedure assumes that the absorption coefficient α of a semiconductor can be expressed as (αhν)γ = A(hν − Eg), where A is a material constant, h is Planck's constant, ν is the light frequency, and Eg is the optical energy band gap of the semiconductor material. The power coefficient γ is the characteristic of the type of transition and, for directly allowed transition, is considered to be equal to 2 – transition of ZnO, ZnS, and Ag2S is believed to be directly allowed.28–30 Thus, plotting [F(R∞)hν]2versus hν, optical Eg of the semiconductor material can be obtained from the x-axis (α = 0) intercept of the line tangent to the inflection point of that curve. In this work, the transformed Kubelka–Munk equation [F(R∞)hν]2versus photon energy was fitted adopting a sigmoidal Boltzmann function. Then, the optical Eg values were obtained from the x-axis intercept of the line tangent to the inflection point of those fitted curves.
3 Evaluating photocatalytic activity
Photocatalytic activity (PCA) of the prepared samples was assessed in the gas–solid phase by monitoring NOx degradation. The employed reactor was operated under continuous conditions, as has been thoroughly described in previous studies.31,32
It was made of a stainless steel cylinder (35 L in volume capacity) and its top was sealed and covered with a glass window to allow for the light to reach the photocatalyst placed inside it. The employed light source was a solar lamp (Osram Ultra-Vitalux, 300 W) used for simulating an outdoor situation. The distance between it and the photocatalyst was 85 cm. The light intensity reaching the samples was measured using a radiometer (Delta OHM, HD2302.0, IT) and was found to be approximately 3.6 W m−2 in the UVA range and 25 W m−2 in the visible-light range. Samples were prepared in the form of a thin layer of powder with a constant mass (∼0.10 g) and thus an approximately constant thickness in a 6 cm diameter Petri dish. The tests were performed at 27 ± 1 °C (temperature inside the reactor) with the relative humidity of 31%. These parameters – controlled by means of a thermocouple that was placed inside the chamber and a humidity sensor placed in the inlet pipe – remained stable throughout the tests. The concentration of the pollutant gas at the outlet was measured using a chemiluminescence analyser (AC-30 M, Environment SA, FR). After having placed the photocatalyst inside the reactor and covering the glass window, the inlet gas mixture (prepared using synthetic air and NOx gas) was allowed to start flowing until being stabilised at the concentration of 0.2 ppm. Two mass flow controllers were used to prepare a mixture of air with this concentration of NOx and with a flow rate of 1 L min−1. This step was necessary to guarantee the sample saturation, assuring that, during the test, the measurement of NOx was solely due to the photocatalytic process (i.e. no absorption from the sample, nor from the reactor walls).33
Once the desired concentration of 0.2 ppm was attained, the glass window was uncovered, the lamp was turned on, and the PCA reaction started. The photocatalytic reaction was considered to be completed when the pollutant concentration reached a minimum and a stable level and the sample could no longer keep on decomposing any NOx.
The photocatalytic efficiency was evaluated as the ratio of the removed concentration of NOx. Conversion rate (%) of the initial NOx concentration was calculated as: (2)where (NOx)0 and (NOx)s are, respectively, the initial NOx and final NOx concentrations (both expressed as ppm) after a certain irradiation time.34 Moreover, with the aim of having a better comparison between the tested samples, data relative to the first 20 min of reaction time were elaborated according to the first order kinetic law. All the tests were repeated in triplicate so as to verify the stability of the prepared photocatalysts.
4 Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS file no. 79-0205),35 while Fig. 1b depicts that, after Na2S addition, reflections of ZnS appeared (JCPDS file no. 05-0566), indicating the presence of ZnS with the sphalerite structure.36 Finally, as can be seen in Fig. 1c, addition of AgNO3 led to obtaining another phase related to Ag2S. Therefore, the XRD pattern (Fig. 1c) contained reflections related to ZnO, ZnS, and Ag2S phases and confirmed the formation of ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures.

Morphologies of the prepared nanostructures were examined by SEM images. Fig. 2a and its digitally magnified part show that, in the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructure, there were nanoparticles which covered the surface of the plates; however, single phase ZnO was only made by plate-like nanostructures (Fig. 2b). Therefore, it can be concluded that ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles were deposited all over the surface of ZnO plates in the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures. The composition of the prepared ternary nanostructures was studied by EDS analysis and the obtained results shown in Fig. 2c confirm the presence of Zn, S, O, and Ag in the final products. No extra signal was detected and thus can confirm the high purity of the obtained product. The HR-TEM images of the ZnO nanoplate alone and the prepared ternary nanostructure taken from the individual plate are presented in Fig. 3. For ZnO, the d-value of 0.31 nm corresponded to a d-spacing of the (100) crystal plane of the wurtzite ZnO. For ternary nanostructures, the d-value of 0.29 nm corresponded to the (101) reflection of the ZnS structure37 and that of 0.24 nm to the (03) reflection of the Ag2S structure38 can be observed which further confirmed the presence of ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO nanoplates. The corresponding electron diffraction patterns of the samples are shown in the inset, which also confirmed the crystallinity of the prepared nanostructures.

The UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum of ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures is demonstrated in Fig. 4. There were three specific absorption bands at around 324, 359, and 1142 nm that were related to ZnS, ZnO, and Ag2S respectively.39–41 The presence of these bands confirmed the formation of ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures. On the other hand, the material with such a kind of absorption spectrum can be very interesting for solar light photocatalysis applications.

For this reason, the optical Eg of the prepared ternary nanostructures (ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S) and that of ZnO and ZnO–ZnS were also determined using the Tauc plot (Fig. 5, Table 1, and Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). For these materials, the transition was assumed to be directly allowed and the obtained Eg values were: 3.37, 3.69, and 1.00 eV for ZnO, ZnS, and Ag2S, respectively (cf.Table 1) – values consistent with the expected ones reported in the literature.28–30

The dotted line represents the x-axis = 0, while the red continuous line the x-axis intercept of the line tangent to the inflection point of the samples, i.e. the optical Eg.

As for the pure ZnO nanostructure, its Eg was found to be equal to 3.31 eV, while that of the ZnO–ZnS composite nanostructure was 3.38 eV (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).
ZnO, with a wurtzite structure, belongs to the space group 4C6v with 4 atoms for each unit cell. According to group theory, its optical modes can be predicted as follows: Γ = A1 + 2B1 + E1 + 2E2(3)
Among these phonons, A1 + E1 + 2E2 modes are Raman active and A1 and E1 are infrared active, while B1 (low) and B1 (high) modes are normally silent. A1 and E1 branches split into transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) components due to their polar symmetry. Based on the related literature, the peaks of ZnO nanoplates at 377 cm−1, 438 cm−1, and 580 cm−1 can be attributed to A1 (TO), E2 (high), and A1 (LO) modes, respectively (Fig. 6a).42–44 In the Raman spectrum of ZnO–ZnS (Fig. 6b), the transverse optical (TO) phonon of ZnS was observed at 335 cm−1, while the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon peak was observed at 232 cm−1. The first order LO and TO phonons of ZnS nanoparticles showed a shift towards the lower energy compared to the Raman spectrum of bulk hexagonal ZnS (TO: 274 cm−1 and LO: 352 cm−1),45 which can be attributed to the confinement effect of optical phonons in the ZnS nanoparticles.46

It is clear that the intensity of ZnO peaks in ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S (Fig. 5c) sharply decreased with the formation of ZnS and Ag2S on the ZnO nanoplates.
The FT-IR spectra of the ZnO, ZnO–ZnS, and ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S samples are shown in Fig. 7. The characteristic absorption peak of ZnO was observed at around 407 cm−1,47 while the broad and small peaks located at 3400 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the O–H bond of the adsorbed H2O molecules on the surface of the samples. By comparison with the spectra of the ZnO and ZnO–ZnS samples, it can be observed that, for ternary ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures, the peak at around 407 cm−1 decreased with the formation of ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO nanoplates due to the decrease in the ZnO proportion.48,49

The Kramers–Kronig (K–K) method and FT-IR reflectance spectrum data were used to evaluate the far-infrared optical properties of the prepared ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures. Evaluation of optical constants of ZnO-based nanocomposites is of considerable importance for applications in integrated optic devices such as optical testers, switches, filters, etc., where the refractive index of a material is the key parameter for designing the devices. The limited degree of precision in optical devices is due to variation in the optical properties of a material, including most specifically the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index. Therefore, accurate information on optical properties of ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures, such as the refractive index and dielectric constants in the infrared region, is of paramount importance. The refractive index n is an important physical quantity in the optical design and generally is a complex quantity: ñ(ω) = n(ω) + ik(ω)(4)where n(ω) and k(ω) are real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index, respectively, which can be obtained from the following equations:50 (5) (6)
Here, φ(ω) is the phase change between the incidence and reflected signals at a particular wavenumber ω and R(ω) is the reflectance in that particular wave number. This phase change can be calculated from the K–K dispersion relationship:51 (7)
This integral can be precisely evaluated by Maclaurin's method:52 (8)where Δω = ωj+1 − ωj and if j is an even number, then i = 1, 3, 5, 6,…j − 1, j + 1,… while, if j is an odd number, then i = 2, 4, 6,…j − 1, j + 1,…
In addition, the dielectric function can be obtained by squaring the refractive index. Therefore, the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function are as follows: (9)
The far-infrared optical constants of the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures were calculated and the spectra are depicted in Fig. 8a and b.

The TO and LO optical phonons are useful for illustrating optical interactions with the lattice. The LO mode frequencies were obtained from the imaginary part of  (Fig. 9) and TO mode frequencies corresponded to the peaks of the imaginary part of the dielectric function, as indicated in Fig. 8b. The obtained values of TO and LO phonon modes of ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S were 422 cm−1 and 606 cm−1 respectively.

Photocatalytic activity
The NOx abatement results are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 9, after the first run, the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S sample was the best performing one, which degraded, after 60 min of irradiation time, 53.1% of the initial NOx. ZnO and ZnO–ZnS samples had approximately the same photocatalytic efficiency, degrading, respectively, 45.9% and 47.7% of NOx, which was consistent with their Egs, all placed in the UV-range – having the lamp used important emission lines in that spectral range.53 Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the ZnO sample had a higher initial degradation trend (first 20 min of the reaction) although it was the first reaching a plateau after approximately 35 min of reaction time and could not keep on decomposing NOx. This issue happened, because O2− and OH˙ radicals were formed during the photocatalytic reaction, reacted with the pollutant gas, and resulted in the production of HNO3: NO + OH˙ → NO2 + H+(10) NO + O2˙− → NO3−(11)NO2 + OH˙ → NO3− + H+ → HNO3
Hence, the HNO3 produced on the surface of the catalyst might act as a physical barrier; therefore, it might inhibit the photocatalytic reaction and/or dissolve the photocatalyst.54,55

Furthermore, H+ generated via photocatalytic reaction can dissolve ZnO and thus cause its photocorrosion during light irradiation, which would lead to the decrease of both PCA and stability.56,57 ZnO + 2H+ → Zn2+ + 1/2O2(13)
For this reason and with the aim of verifying the stability of the prepared photocatalyst, tests were repeated in triplicate. As depicted in Fig. 10, the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S sample was again the best performing one, even after the second run (it degraded 51.4% of NOx after 60 min of irradiation time). By contrast, the ZnO sample degraded 34.3%, hence losing almost 1/4 of its original PCA, which was probably due to the above-mentioned photocorrosion effects. Also, ZnO–ZnS slightly lost its initial activity, degrading 43.1% of NOx (versus 47.7%, the value attained in the first experiment). This trend was also confirmed by the initial (first 20 min of reaction) pseudo-first order kinetic constants (cf.Table 2) – values were within the experimental error, considering both the first and second runs for the ZnO–ZnS sample. As for the third run, again, ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S showed the best photocatalytic performance, degrading 49.5% of NOx, therefore only slightly losing its initial activity. On the other hand, the ZnO sample, due to photocorrosion effects, lost roughly 60% of its initial activity (it degraded only 18.5% NOx); also, ZnO–ZnS had a loss in the photocatalytic efficiency, degrading 35.6% of NOx after the third run. This loss in activity after three consecutive experiments (for ZnO and ZnO–ZnS samples) was also confirmed by the pseudo-first order kinetic constants, as reported in Table 2. According to these data, it can be inferred that surface modification, by both ZnS and ZnS–Ag2S, had a severe impact on modifying the charge, reactivity of the surface, and enhancing the stability of the semiconductor, indirectly reducing photocorrosion in bare ZnO. Hence, ZnS and, above all, ZnS–Ag2S surface modification were able to fill the surface oxygen defects in ZnO and make it more stable.58 Then, the H+ migration on the surface of the photocatalyst was able to attack the adsorbed pollutants and inhibit that photocorrosion effect.59 It is known that the conduction band of ZnS lies on a more negative potential than that of ZnO; but, the valence band of ZnO is more positive than that of ZnS.60 Under the exposure of solar simulated light, the photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of the ZnS nanoparticles were transferred to that of the ZnO nanoplates; on the other hand, the holes on the valence band of ZnO nanoplates were transferred to that of the ZnS nanoparticles.61 By adding Ag2S, the photo-generated electrons in ZnO and ZnS were able to move toward the conduction band of Ag2S – as suggested by Liu et al. and schematically shown in Fig. 11 – and henceforth become active centres for the photocatalytic production of O2˙− radicals. Those radicals, together with OH˙ radicals formed during photocatalysis, reacted with the pollutant gas, resulting in the oxidation of NO2 and the final production of HNO3.62 Therefore, the interaction between the ZnO nanoplate and ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles not only boosted an efficient charge transfer in that photocatalytic system, but also improved the stability of the prepared photocatalyst. Therefore, the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S ternary nanostructures are found to be the most stable and efficient photocatalyst among the systems studied here.

5. Conclusion
ZnO nanoplates covered with ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles or ternary ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures were simply prepared by a precipitation technique without using any capping ligands or other additives. Optical properties of the prepared sample studied by UV-Vis-NIR reflectance and Raman spectroscopy were significantly affected by the presence of ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles. The refractive index and dielectric constants of the sample in the far-infrared region were calculated using the K–K method and FT-IR spectroscopy. The values of TO and LO phonon modes were also calculated and the values of 422 cm−1 and 606 cm−1 were, respectively, obtained. Photocatalytic activity of the prepared nanostructures was studied considering the NOx abatement using a solar lamp. The results showed that the interaction between the ZnO nanoplates and ZnS and Ag2S nanoparticles not only encouraged an efficient charge transfer in that photocatalytic system, but also greatly improved the stability of the prepared ternary photocatalyst. Thus, the ZnO–ZnS–Ag2S nanostructures resulted to be the most stable and efficient photocatalysts among the systems studied here.
