    , Accepted 11th July 2016First published on 11th July 2016AbstractWe demonstrate the electron transfer between gold nanoparticles and perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 at a single nanoparticle level by plasmon resonance Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy. Different mass concentrations of CH3NH3PbI3 show different formations of crystal grains on the gold nanoparticles, which led to different degrees of red-shift.
Organometallic halide perovskite materials have become a new generation of solar cell absorbers due to their long carrier lifetime, high mobility, long-range balanced electron–hole transport lengths, as well as their strong and wide light-absorption over the visible spectrum.1–4 In the last five years, this new type of perovskite solar cell has shown remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 19.3%, surpassing dye-sensitized and amorphous silicon cells.5,6 The most efficient perovskite-type absorber is the organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbX3 with X representing Cl, Br or I. The frequently-used structure of perovskite solar cells is FTO/electron transport material (TiOx)/CH3NH3PbX3/hole transport material (Spiro-MeOTAD)/Au, known as the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell structure.7 Several approaches have been explored to improve the properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, such as by controlling the composition and structural ordering of perovskite films, changing the materials of the electron layer transport and hole transport layer, or incorporating metal nanoparticles into the solar cells.8–11 To date, many effective methods have been developed to mix metal nanoparticles into perovskite-based solar cells, especially gold nanoparticles (GNPs).12–15 GNPs have been incorporated into perovskite layers for the high PCE derived from photocurrent and absorption enhancement.12,13 The improved optical properties are attributed to plasmonic effects of the GNPs.16 Therefore, research on the interaction between GNPs and CH3NH3PbX3 is valuable and important.
The emergence and development of dark-field microscopy (DFM) and plasmon resonance Rayleigh scattering (PRRS) spectroscopy have promoted the understanding of the physical and chemical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles at the single nanoparticle level.17 GNPs exhibit excellent optical properties, especially strong light scattering generated by localized surface plasmon resonance; however, they are highly sensitive to local dielectric surroundings, surface morphology, composition and electron density.18 PRRS provides a novel approach for monitoring catalytic events, molecular reactions, and morphological variations on a single nanoparticle’s surface.19–21 To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports concerning the interactions between GNPs and photoabsorption materials at a single nanoparticle level. These interactions could be monitored by the light-scattering intensity changes, spectral shift and the apparent color changes observed in DFM.22
Herein, the interaction between GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3 at a single nanoparticle level was monitored by DFM and PRRS spectroscopy, which induced a color change of the GNPs and a red-shifted scattering spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the interaction between GNPs and perovskite absorbers at a single nanoparticle level has been analysed. Our strategy is shown in Scheme 1. The synthesised GNPs were immobilized on ITO slides, and then annealed with a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor to form perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 coated GNPs (GNPs@CH3NH3PbI3). We found that different mass concentrations of CH3NH3PbI3 show different formations of crystal grains, which led to different degrees of red-shift. The scattering spectral shift is attributed to the change of dielectric constant and electron transfer process.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the interaction between GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3 analysis by conventional dark-field microscopy and plasmon resonance Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy. 
The GNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†), which implied that the GNPs were well synthesized. The dark-field image of about 246 individual GNPs is shown in Fig. S1c (ESI†), and the inset is the magnified view of this dark-field image. The color image of the GNPs was analysed by a self-developed statistical program named ‘nanoparticle analysis’ to provide a statistical peak wavelength distribution.23 The result shows that the calculated peak wavelength of the GNPs is 562 ± 5 nm (Fig. S1d, ESI†).
The morphological and structural details of the CH3NH3PbI3 materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From Fig. 1a, the surface displayed a dense-grained uniform surface and the grain size ranged from 100 to 500 nm, which demonstrated that well-crystallized CH3NH3PbI3 had been synthesized.24 All the other diffraction peaks were assigned to the ITO slides, and no impurity peaks of MAI and PbI2 could be found, indicating high purity of the CH3NH3PbI3 sample. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) technique was used for determining the composition of the CH3NH3PbI3 sample (Fig. 1b). The EDS spectrum exhibits peaks of C, N, Pb and I elements. The mass percentages of I and Pb in the CH3NH3PbI3 were 61.38% and 33.64% with an atomic ratio of 3:1 correlating with the formula unit.25 The composition and crystal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1c, the XRD spectra of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2 were indexed well with their standard spectra from PDF cards No. 30-1797 and No. 07-0235. The diffraction peaks at 19.72°, 29.74° and 50.52° correspond to the (002), (003) and (005) planes of MAI, and the diffraction peaks at 12.66°, 38.64° and 52.32° correspond to the (001), (003) and (004) planes of PbI2. The CH3NH3PbI3 film gave diffraction peaks at 14.02°, 19.90°, 28.30°, 31.76°, 40.40° and 43.00°, corresponding to the (110), (112), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure.25

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was applied to verify the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 after several hours' dark-field determination. A 30 keV Bi+ beam served as the primary ion beam, and the energy of the secondary ions ranged from 0 to 10 eV.26 The TOF-SIMS spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 shows peaks of O−, CN−, N3−, I−, CH3NH3I−, I2−, PbI−, I3−, PbI2−, PbI3− and so on (Fig. 1d). A previous report suggests that water proceeds with an acid–base reaction with CH3NH3PbI3, leading to HI, CH3NH2, H2O, and PbI2.27 Therefore, completely denatured CH3NH3PbI3 has no CH3NH3I− peak in the TOF-SIMS spectrum. The high intensity of CH3NH3I− indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 material has good stability during our whole experimental process.
To analyse the interaction between the GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3 at a single nanoparticle level, we immobilized 62 nm GNPs on clean ITO slides, and then annealed with a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor to form crystal grain coated GNPs. The dark-field images of the single GNPs and PRRS spectra λmax were used to study the interaction between GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), the scattered green spots in the captured DFM image correspond to the individual GNPs immobilized on the ITO slides. When the GNPs were annealed with 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3, the green spots gradually changed to orange (Fig. S2f, ESI†). To investigate the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 grains on the GNPs, different mass concentrations of the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor were used for coating the GNPs and then annealed in N2. The dark-field images of the GNPs after annealing with 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt% CH3NH3PbI3 show obvious color changes from green to orange or red (Fig. S2b–e, ESI†).
The scattering peak λmax of several single GNPs (≥20) in each dark-field image was recorded and drawn as a histogram. The black curves represent the Gaussian fitting for the histogram, and the calculated peak wavelengths of the GNPs before (0%) and after annealing with 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3 were at 561.4, 593.7, 604.9, 623.2, 605.2 and 593.8 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a–f). Scattering peak shifts (Δλ) of the GNPs after annealing with CH3NH3PbI3 from 5 to 40 wt% were compared with those before annealing (Fig. S3, ESI†). The maximum peak shift appeared at 20 wt% and was 61.8 nm. These results show that the scattering peak wavelength of the complex nanoparticles is red-shifted from that of the original GNPs due to the interaction between the GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3 materials.

Few studies have demonstrated heat treatment of GNPs or DMF-coated GNPs before their observation under a dark-field microscope. For the control experiments, GNP-modified ITO slides were annealed at 100 °C in the absence and presence of DMF under N2 for 1 h and were then used for DFM and PRRS experiments (Fig. S4, ESI†). The dark-field images and calculated peak wavelengths of these annealed GNPs were compared with those without heat treatment to prove the feasibility of our experiment (Fig. S1, ESI†). The results show that the calculated scattering peak has a change of ca. 5 nm, within the margin of error. Another control experiment was carried out to immobilize GNPs on the glass and anneal with 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The dark-field image and the calculated scattering peak were compared with those of the GNPs modified on the ITO slide (Fig. S2f, ESI† and Fig. 2f), and show that the indium tin oxide surface has no distinct influence on the scattering peak shift of the GNPs after annealing with CH3NH3PbI3. The subsequent control experiments that characterized the perovskite thin film formed on the ITO slides by DFM and SEM are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), to further confirm the crystalline grains on the GNPs.
Larger GNPs of 90 and 110 nm were synthesized to study the interaction between GNPs and CH3NH3PbI3. The UV-vis spectra and TEM images of these GNPs are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). To get the maximum degree of red-shift, 20 wt% of the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was used for coating GNPs and then annealed in N2. The dark-field images and calculated peak wavelengths of the 90 and 110 nm GNPs before and after annealing with CH3NH3PbI3 are shown in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). The results show that the larger sized GNPs (90 and 110 nm) annealed with CH3NH3PbI3 made the scattering peak wavelength shift to 632 nm and 654 nm.
To further confirm the color change of the spots in the DFM images and the scattering peak shifts for the GNPs, SEM images of 62 nm GNPs before and after annealing with CH3NH3PbI3 of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 wt% were taken (Fig. 3). In the SEM pictures, it is worth noting that the gold nanoparticle was coated with CH3NH3PbI3 grains, which is associated with the color change of the single nanoparticle and the scattering peak shift. At an earlier stage of the annealing process, the produced CH3NH3PbI3 species were firstly deposited on the surfaces of the GNPs to reduce their surface energy, and their deposited positions were deemed “growth sites”. When the CH3NH3PbI3 had mass fractions from 5 to 20 wt%, the follow-up growth sites were still on the surfaces of the GNPs, and then formed the similar core–shell GNPs@CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles. When the mass fraction was above 20 wt%, crystal nuclei were formed, and provided growth sites for further growth into an irregular morphology.28

In order to prove that the plasmon resonance scattering spectral shift was related to the CH3NH3PbI3 grains coating the GNPs’ surface, discrete dipole approximation (DDA) was adopted to simulate the scattering situation of the gold nanoparticles. The DDA method developed by Draine and Flatau has been regarded as one of the most convenient and significant methods for simulating the optical properties of nanoparticles with arbitrary complex refractivities and geometry.29 The model was considered to have a geometry of a gold core with a CH3NH3PbI3 shell, and the refractive index of the dielectric shell was related to the shell composition. According the DDA method and a previous report,30 we carried out a scattering peak simulation of the 62 nm GNPs before and after coating with 5 nm and 10 nm of CH3NH3PbI3 (see the calculation results shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). The calculation results suggest that the scattering spectra of the GNPs shift 10–14 nm after being coated with a CH3NH3PbI3 shell due to the change of dielectric constant. The properties of CH3NH3PbI3 with mass concentrations from 5 to 20 wt% could be explained by this method approximately.
Furthermore, the scattering peak shift before and after annealing with CH3NH3PbI3 might be related to the electron transfer process. The plasmon-induced charge separation process has been suggested in a previous report.16 The GNPs were photoexcited because of the plasmonic effect, and the excited electrons transferred from the gold particle to the conduction band of the CH3NH3PbI3 semiconductor.31,32 Therefore, the electrons on the surface of the GNPs decreased, resulting in a red-shifted scattering peak. The electron transfer could be calculated using the method in another report.33 For this we need the volume of gold nanoparticles. From the SEM image shown in Fig. 3a, the diameter of the gold nanoparticle is 62 nm. The volume is then V = 4π/3 × R3 = 124788 nm3. The volume of a gold atom is 0.0170 nm3, therefore the number of gold atoms in one gold nanoparticle is N = 7.34 × 106. Within the dipole approximation, the plasmon resonance wavelength is given by eqn (1):33 (1)where λp is the bulk plasma wavelength (131 nm for neutral gold), ε∞ is the high frequency contribution to the metal dielectric function (12.2 for gold), εm is the dielectric constant of the medium (1.0 for air) and L is the particle shape factor. The plasmon resonance wavelength for the gold nanoparticle in Fig. 3a is 561.4 nm. Using these data it is possible to calculate the shape factor, L = 0.14. Using eqn (1), L = 0.14, λp = 131 nm, ε∞ = 12.2, εm = 1.0, N = 7.34 × 106 and Δλ = 61.8 − 14 = 47.8 nm. (2)we find ΔN = −1.25 × 106 electrons. The amount of electron reduction up to 106 conduced the large degree red-shift, which eliminated the change of dielectric constant.
In conclusion, the electron transfer between GNPs and perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was studied by DFM and PRRS spectroscopy at a single nanoparticle level. This process resulted in a color change in the DFM images and a large red-shift of the scattering spectra. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor of different mass concentrations gave a different formation of crystal grains, which led to distinguishable degrees of red-shift. In addition, the influence of the dielectric constant could be explained well using DDA simulations. Furthermore, the electron transfer could be calculated according to a previous report. We believe that our results could contribute to understanding plasmonic effects, especially for incorporating plasmonic nanoparticles into solar cells. Further efforts could characterize other optoelectronic properties of organometallic halide perovskites on a single nanoparticle surface.
