The physical characteristics and electro-catalytic abilities of the PtNF-CEs were analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A double layer theory and a crystal facet formation mechanism are used to explain the catalytic abilities of the PtNFs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images depict a dramatic transformation in the surface structure of the Pt clusters. The ITO glass with the PtNFs was used as the counter electrode (CE) of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The DSSC assembled with the as-prepared PtNF-CE exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.74%, while the cell with an additional thin (2 nm) sputtered layer of platinum on the PtNF film shows much higher η of 8.13%, both at 1 sun conditions. The performances of the DSSCs are further substantiated by the data from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and UV-Vis reflectance spectra.
Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), consisting of a dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode, a counter electrode (CE) and an electrolyte with a redox couple (I−/I3−), is an alternative device to a conventional silicon solar cell, due to its low fabrication cost, environmental compatibility and simple fabrication process.1 Photoexcitation of the dye molecules under illumination leads to the injection of electrons from the dye to the conduction band of the TiO2 and their flowing through the external circuit. Simultaneously, the oxidized dye is reduced by an I− ion in the electrolyte and returns to its ground state, in which the I− ion gets converted to a triiodide (I3−) ion. The electrons that flow through the external circuit arrive at the counter electrode and reduce the I3− ions, by the reaction, I3− + 2e− ⇌ 3I−(1)

        Platinum, well-known as a material with one of the best catalytic abilities, is widely applied in the development of cutting-edge technologies, such as fuel cells,2 biosensors,3 and chemical sensors.4 Its desirable chemical and physical characteristics are suitable for various industrial and environmental applications. It is the most commonly used material to fabricate the CE of a DSSC. One of the strategies to enhance the performance of a DSSC is to improve the catalytic ability of its CE for the reduction of I3− ions. Structural modification of a platinum film is expected to improve its catalytic ability. In this direction of research, a few structures of platinum were reported, such as multipods, nanowires, and nanotubes.5,6
Recently, a film of platinum nanoflowers (PtNFs),7–12 a 3-D structure with high surface area, has emerged as a promising topic. Kawasaki et al. synthesized films of PtNFs by chemical reduction13 and electroless galvanic displacement technique,10 and utilized these films to significantly increase the sensitivity of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) for various analytes. In research on a methanol fuel cell, Tiwari et al. used potentiostatic pulse plating (or the pulse potential method, or PRE coined in this study) to grow PtNFs on silicon wafers; these PtNFs showed excellent electro-catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation and also a high CO tolerance.7 Ye et al. used lead(II) acetate (LA) and the surfactant polyethylene glycol (PEG) as shape-controlling agents for the pulse electrodeposition of PtNFs on a carbon substrate.14 Li et al. first seeded a C-Nafion®/graphite substrate with Pt (10 μg cm−2) and then pulse deposited 225 μg cm−2 of platinum on the substrate in the presence of 10−4 mM PEG-400; the ultimate film in their case also consisted of PtNFs.15 Paoletti et al. obtained similar PtNFs structures on carbon substrates, i.e., carbon black and carbon nanotubes;16 these electrodeposited films of PtNFs showed higher electrocatalytic activity at lower Pt loading, as compared with the electrocatalytic activity of a commercial Pt catalyst (E-TEK). Zhang et al. compared a film of PtNFs with a film of Pt nanoparticles, both electrodeposited onto ITO glass under constant potential, and found that the former with a larger surface area showed a higher catalytic ability towards ethanol oxidation.8
Among several synthetic techniques used to prepare Pt thin films, such as sputtering or thermal deposition, electrochemical deposition shows several advantages. In the case of a sputtered Pt film, one should use a vacuum chamber and cannot prevent the wastage of some platinum due to its sputtering onto the surface of the chamber. Thermal deposition of a Pt film can not be applied in the case of plastic substrates, such as ITO-PET or ITO-PEN, because of the fact that they can not bear high temperatures of the order of 450 °C.
In this work, we applied the pulse reverse potential method to electrodeposit PtNFs on an ITO substrate at room temperature, without any further post-treatment, e.g., high temperature treatment, and used the thus obtained electrode as the CE of a DSSC. We used a one-step pulsed electrodeposition process and an ITO-glass as the substrate. This method can, however, be used to prepare a Pt film on an ITO-PEN or an ITO-PET to fabricate a flexible DSSC. By manipulating the electrodeposition parameters, we obtained, in a single process, different morphologies within the main structure of the PtNFs. These morphologies were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The DSSC assembled with the as-prepared PtNF-CE exhibited a high conversion efficiency of 7.74%, while the cell with an additional thin (2 nm) sputtered layer of platinum on the PtNF film showed much higher η of 8.13%, both at 1 sun conditions. This work reports the first use of PtNFs for the counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell.
Experimental
Chemicals

Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6, ACS, Premion, 99.95%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Acetone (CH3COCH3, ACS reagent, 99.5%) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Anhydrous LiI, I2, and acetonitrile (ACN),were purchased from Merck. 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), and tert-butanol (TBA, 99.5%) were received from Acros. Cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (so called N719), and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) were obtained from Sloaronix S. A., Aubonne, Switzerland. Two kinds of commercial TiO2 pastes (Ti nanoxide T and Ti nanoxide R/SP) were purchased from Solaronix.
Preparation of the PtNFs-CE
ITO glass (Solaronix SA, Rsh = 7 Ω □−1) was used as the substrate for the PtNF-CE. The electrodeposition was carried out in a solution consisting of 3.0 mM H2PtCl6 and 0.5 M H2SO4 with de-ionized water as the solvent. The as-prepared PtNF/ITO electrode was rinsed with water after the electrodeposition. The deposition area was 2.25 cm2.
The PRE was performed as follows: the applied potential was continuously switched between the cathodic potential (Ec) and the anodic potential (Ea) to reduce H2PtCl6 during the cathodic polarization and to inhibit the reduction during the anodic polarization. Assuming that there was no reduction during the anodic polarization time (ta), the time can also be considered as the “resting time”. The total cathodic polarization time for each sample was 3600 s. The anodic polarization time (ta) was fixed at 2 s, while the variable, i.e., cathodic polarization time (tc), was kept at 1, 2, 6, 15 and 3600 s (the last one in the case of constant potential). Scheme 1 illustrates the general concept of the PRE. Sputtered-platinum CEs, each with a platinum thickness of 50 nm, were also prepared for comparison.17

Fabrication of the DSSC
First, the commercial TiO2 paste (Ti nanoxide T) was coated on a cleaned fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (FTO, TEC–7, 7 Ω □−1,NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) substrate by a doctor-blade technique, and the substrate was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min; two layers of TiO2 paste (Ti nanoxide T) and one layer of TiO2 paste (Ti nanoxide R/SP) were then coated on the electrode by a doctor-blade technique; the thus coated FTO substrate was then annealed as in the previous process. The total thickness of TiO2 was about 18 μm, which includes 6 μm of a scattering layer on the top. A portion of 0.16 cm2 was selected from the composite film as the active area by removing the side portions by scraping. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the electrode was dipped in a solution containing 3 × 10−4 M N719 dye in acetonitrile (ACN)/tert-butanol (v/v = 1:1) for 16 h. The TiO2 electrode was coupled with one of the various CEs (CEs with various PtNFs and sputtered-Pt); these two electrodes were separated by a 25 μm-thick Surlyn® (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) and sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in ACN was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the two electrodes by capillarity, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the electrolyte injection.
Instrumentation
The PRE was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell at room temperature, using a PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). A platinum sheet and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, NovaTM NanoSEM 230) was employed for obtaining images of the samples at 3 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert, Philips) was utilized to analyze the crystalline orientations of the samples. The electro-catalytic ability and the electro-active surface area of the counter electrodes were verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The assembled DSSCs were illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5 G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.), and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 kHz to 10 Hz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSSC, between the CE and the FTO/TiO2/dye electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed by an equivalent circuit model. The reflectance spectra of the PtNFs counter electrodes were acquired using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR, V670, Jasco Co., Japan), equipped with an integrating sphere.
Results and discussion
Preparation of PtNF counter electrode by pulse reverse potential technique

Fig. 1(a), (b), (c), and (d) show chronoamperograms obtained during the PRE of the PtNFs for different cathodic polarization times (tc); the total cathodic polarization time in each case was 3600 s. The first five cycles of each PRE show a behavior of platinum nucleation. The current density in each case of PRE increases with increase in the number of polarization cycles; this indicates increased deposition of platinum with each cycle of polarization. After about 1000 s, the current density remains stable, indicating a steady state of deposition of Pt on the electrode. The insets in Fig. 1(a), (b), (c), and (d) show the chronoamerograms obtained after 3000 s; these insets show the steady-state deposition of Pt. In the case of constant current potential deposition, a limiting current density is reached after 60 s (Fig. 1(e)); this indicates that the reaction in the case of a constant potential is diffusion-controlled. Fig. 1(f) compares the current responses of different tc's at a glance, and the inset, which is a zoomed-out version of Fig. 1(f), shows the whole picture of each steady PRE; the figure shows the chronoamperograms for different cathodic polarization times; for each chronoamperogram the starting point on the y-axis is the starting point of each cathodic polarization time. The green line in Fig.1(f) indicates the limiting current. The limiting current in the case of 15 and 6 s is the same as that in the case of a constant potential; the currents in the cases of 2 and 1 s have not reached the level of limiting current. Careful observation indicates that the values of cathodic current density increase in the order of 15 < 6 < 2 < 1 s for tc. This current density difference could indicate that the surface concentration of platinum complex ions varies with tc. Theoretically, for a long tc, e.g., 15 s, the platinum complex ions get depleted at the last cycle to such an extent that 2 s of anodic polarization time (ta) is quite insufficient to replenish them. For short tc, e.g., 1 s, the surface concentration of platinum complex ions remains at a high level, because their depletion is minimal during the last cycle; this results in a high reaction rate for a tc of short duration. To further monitor the morphological changes of PtNFs under various conditions, cathodic polarization times (tc) of 4 and 10 s were also used to prepare the films of the PtNFs; the “4 s” and “10 s” films had almost the same morphologies as those of “2 s” and “15 s” films, respectively. Therefore, we did not pursue experiments further with the films formed under these conditions. The SEM images of these films formed at “4 s” and “10 s” are shown in Fig. S1(a) and Fig. S1(b), respectively, in the ESI.†

Physical properties of the films of PtNFs
The adhesiveness of the PtNFs to the substrate could be observed while rinsing. Films, cracked and detached from the substrate during the rinsing, were considered to have poor adhesion, and therefore were discarded for further electrochemical analysis.

Fig. 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) show SEM images of the PtNFs prepared with different cathodic polarization times. A tendency of morphology transformation can be observed. For a short tc of 1 s, Pt clusters tend to form hemispheres with bumps on the surfaces of the spheres.18 As tc increases to 2 s, the bumps gradually grow into obtuse spikes. Then sharp spikes appear at 6 s. A further increase of tc to 15 s results in shrinking of the spikes and forming of sheets within large spheres of platinum.14 Spheres having a textured morphology are observed in the case of a constant potential, i.e., tc of 3600 s (Fig. 2(e)).7,27 This series of transformations can be related to the surface concentration of platinum ions at the very moment when reduction takes place. A short tc like 1 s maintains a relatively high concentration of platinum ions at the substrate for its deposition. As tc increases, a constant ta of 2 s becomes insufficient for the diffusion of Pt ions from the electrolyte to replenish Pt ions near the surface of the substrate. Fig. 2(f) shows SEM images of PtNFs obtained in electrolytes with 0.5 M Na2SO4 for 2 s (top) and 15 s (bottom).

This transformation has similarities with that in Paoletti's work, in which current density was set as the controlling factor16 (in our case, cathodic polarization time is the controlling factor). They obtained uniform Pt spheres under small current density, and thereby at high surface concentration of platinum complex ions. With increased current density, i.e., with increased reduction of platinum complex ions and thereby increasing depletion at the electrode surface, they thus obtained various morphologies, including, sphere-like, sheet-like or texture-like surface.
According to Paoletti's work and our own observations, it can be inferred that a high surface concentration of PtCl62− would result in the formation of spherical particles, and a low surface concentration of PtCl62− would result in the formation of special structures, such as nanosheets and nanospikes.
While taking SEM images, energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were simultaneously obtained to confirm the purity of the film of PtNFs. Only elemental signals were detected for the PtNFs; the EDX spectrum in Fig. 3 indicates the presence of metallic platinum. Savouchkina et al. confirmed the full reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(0) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the case of PtNFs, obtained with similar electrodeposition parameters.19

Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of the films of PtNFs obtained for different cathodic polarization times. All the peak responses are from Pt and ITO substrate, again confirming that no impurities remained after the PRE process. The diffraction peaks of Pt(111), Pt(100), Pt(110) can be respectively indexed to the 2θ values of 39.9, 46.4 and 67.8° for each XRD pattern, according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction standards (JCPDS, PDF no. 88-2343). The data were used to estimate the average grain size of PtNF particles by Scherrer's formula.20,21Table 1 gives the average grain size of the Pt particles obtained at different tc's and at a constant potential. The ratio of ta to tc increases with decreasing tc, i.e., the resting time increases with decreasing tc for the diffusion of PtCl62− to the electrode surface. The surface concentration increases with decreasing tc; this situation provides a larger driving force for the formation of PtNFs and thereby a larger grain size for the corresponding particles. However, the depletion of PtCl62− near the electrode also accelerates with decreasing tc, and this reduces the mentioned driving force. Balancing between the two mentioned effects, the grain size of PtNFs reached a maximum at tc = 2 s.

In order to investigate whether the PtNFs possess a preferential orientation, texture coefficients (TC) were also calculated by using the following equation,22 (2)where I(hkl) indicates the X-ray diffraction intensity obtained from PtNF, and n is the number of diffraction peaks considered. I0(hkl) is the intensity of the standard diffraction pattern (PDF no.88-2343). This study mainly focused on the three low-index crystal planes, i.e., (111), (100), and (110). As shown in Table 1, when tc increases, TC(111) decreases and TC(100) increases. Even though TC(110) seems to have random values, the sum of TC(100) and TC(110) ascended with tc. Such results agree with the SEM images, since the spherical surface is considered to be dominated by the (111) plane18 and the texture surface is considered to be dominated by the (100) and (110) planes.7 Previous researchers have suggested that the special surface morphology can be caused by the SO42− anion, which can strongly adsorb on the Pt(111) facet.8,23 However, considering other reported studies on the adsorption of sulfate ions on platinum24,25 and our own results, we suggest that Pt(100) and Pt(110) also interact with SO42− anions in the PRE process and play a role in the formation of the special structure.
Considering the XRD patterns and the SEM images of the PtNFs, a possible mechanism can be given for the morphological changes of the PtNFs (Scheme 2). With a sufficient surface concentration of PtCl62− near the electrode surface, the adsorption of SO42− ions is rather insignificant, and platinum clusters show a tendency of forming a sphere, which is the most thermodynamically stable structure.26 Theoretically, SO42− ions on a platinum surface hinder Pt growth on their sites of adsorption. When the surface concentration is low, such a blocking effect becomes significant, thereby forming special structures rather than spheres. Since the reaction is more likely to be controlled by the diffusion of PtCl62− from the bulk solution to the surface, rather than its reduction at the bottom surface of the clusters, Pt preferably grows on the tips and edges with shorter diffusion paths. The mechanism proposed might explain why TC(111) decreases as tc increases (Table 1). The hindering effect of SO42− is more significant with longer tc, because of low concentration of PtCl62− under these conditions. Among the three facets, Pt(111), P(100), and Pt(110), the growth of Pt(111) is expected to be hindered to a maximum extent, because the (111) plane is known as the most favourable adsorption plane for SO42− ions. With longer tc, i.e., with stronger hindering effect, TC(111) becomes smaller, because of less growth of Pt(111). The TC(111) values are 1.63, 1.51, and 1.46, respectively for PtNFs obtained with 1 s, 6 s, and 15 s.
 Scheme 2  Influences of surface concentration of PtCl62− and adsorption sites of SO42− on the morphological changes of the PtNFs. 
The effect of the electrolyte on the formation of PtNFs was further confirmed by replacing H2SO4 with Na2SO4 in the PRE. H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte for the electrodeposition of PtNFs in most of the above mentioned literature; Tsekouras and co-workers obtained Pt film with textured surface by applying single potential steps (could be regarded as constant potential) in an aqueous solution containing 10 mM H2PtCl6 and 0.5 M Na2SO4.27 In this work, to demonstrate the fact that a morphology change is not due to the effect of adsorption of H+ on Pt, H2SO4 was replaced with Na2SO4 in the electrodeposition solution, using the same concentration, i.e., 0.5 M for the electrolyte. Using a total deposition time of 1200 s, tc of 2 and 15 s, similar morphologies (Fig. 2(f)) and TC variations (Table 1) were obtained; these results confirm that SO42− plays the main role in the formation of PtNFs.

Electrochemical analysis of the films of PtNFs
To estimate the real electro-active areas (Ar) of the films of PtNFs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, with Pt foil as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Fig. 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the films of PtNFs, obtained at different cathodic polarization times (tc). From the CVs, the real surface areas (Ar) of the films of PtNFs were estimated by integrating the cathodic current density for the hydrogen adsorption reaction and correcting for the double-layer charging current. The charge was integrated under the cathodic current density of their CVs within the range of −0.2 to 0.2 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), and the charge associated with the double layer in the corresponding range of potentials was subtracted as correction; the remained anodic charge corresponds to hydrogen adsorption on the working electrode.28 In addition, a conversion factor of 210 μC cm−2 was used for the calculation.15 The roughness factor (Ar/Ag, where Ag = 2.25 cm2), defined as the electrochemically active specific surface area of Pt per unit area of ITO substrate, was then calculated and is shown in Table 2. The highest roughness factor (151.48 cm2 cm−2) is obtained in the case of 2 s.

The table also includes the values for a Pt film, obtained by a sputtering process; the sputtered Pt film, known to have a flat plane surface with a low roughness factor of 2–10 cm2 cm−2,29 shows rather a smaller roughness factor of 5.28 cm2 cm−2. In order to calculate the specific mass area (electro-active surface area per unit mass of Pt), S, platinum loading of the PtNF-CE was estimated by the direct weighing method. The platinum loading of sputtered Pt-CE was calculated assuming that the platinum film was a compact cuboid bulk material with Pt density of 21.45 g cm−3. Table 2 shows the calculated values; the values indicate that the PtNFs possess comparable S to that of sputtered-Pt, despite the fact that the loadings are higher by an order of magnitude.

Fig. 5 shows gradual changes in the adsorption peaks. It is reported that peaks at −0.08 and 0.02 V represent the hydrogen adsorption on Pt(110) and Pt(100), respectively, and the broad peak between 0.2 and −0.2 V represents the hydrogen adsorption on Pt(111).30,31 Under a short tc of 1 or 2 s, the adsorption behavior is dominated by the Pt(111) peak. As tc increases, peaks of Pt(110) and Pt(100) become more prominent. These results agree with those of XRD and SEM.
The double layer capacitances of the CVs vary considerably with varying tc's. When the tc increases from 2 to 6 s, the double layer charge decreases significantly. The shaded region in Fig. 5 shows the double layer charge in the case of 6 s, which is the smallest one among all. Such phenomena may occur because of the variations in the surface roughnesses of the films of PtNF. A smooth surface of a film of PtNFs formed at a short tc is associated with a thick double layer.32
The electro-catalytic abilities of the as-prepared PtNF-CEs were studied by CV, performed in an acetonitrile solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4.33Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, with Ag/Ag+ as reference electrode. Each CV in Fig. 6 shows two pairs of redox peaks. The electrocatalytic ability of a CE for I3−reduction in a DSSC could be visualized in terms of the cathodic peak current (Ipc) at a more negative potential, and the reaction is shown in eqn (1). The magnitude of this cathodic peak current in a CV expresses the catalytic ability of a PtNF-CE for the reduction of I3− ions in the corresponding DSSC. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the Ipc is largest in the case of PtNFs deposited with a tc of 6 s, which is comparable with the Ipc of the film obtained by sputtering.

To further confirm the electro-catalytic abilities of the PtNFs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied. Two PtNF-CEs prepared under identical conditions were paired to assemble a symmetric cell with identical electrolyte as that used in the assembly of a DSSC.34 The series resistance (Rs) of the symmetrical cell was measured at a frequency of 100 kHz, while the frequency between 10 kHz and 100 Hz was used to estimate the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the cell. By taking half the value of a semi-circle in Fig. 7, the Rct of a PtNF-CE could be obtained; Table 1 shows the Rct values of the cells with different PtNF-CEs. The least value of Rct can be found in the case of the cell with PtNFs, obtained at 6 s. This is attributed to the highest catalytic ability of this CE for the I3−reduction. This result is consistent with that of the CV for the I−/I3−reduction.

However, the PtNF film obtained at 6 s does not possess the largest surface area (Table 2), in spite of its superior electro-catalytic ability. This is contradictory to conventional research reports on Pt catalysts, according to which enhanced catalytic ability is associated with enhanced surface area;11,15 nevertheless, recently there have been more reports to contradict this point.16,18 Here we propose some explanations: first, the double layer is considered as a resistance to the catalytic reaction at the Pt electrode, and can therefore block the diffusion of iodide and triiodide molecules near the electrode surface. The thinnest double layer in the case of 6 s is favourable for faster diffusion of the ions and thus increases the reaction rate at the Pt electrode. Paoletti proposed similar idea, considering the formation of sharp edges and tips on the uppermost surface of Pt nanoparticles. Second, the surface structure of platinum nanoparticles significantly influences the electro-catalysis, because each reaction favors its own specific crystal facet.35 To the best of our knowledge, no paper mentioned a preferential reaction site for the reduction of triiodide at a low-index facet of platinum. Our results suggest that Pt(100) and Pt(110) could possess better electrocatalytic ability to triiodide reduction. It can be noted from Table 1 that the films of PtNFs obtained with 15 s and 3600 s of PRE show the best values of TC(110) + TC(110); in spite of these preferential sites, their Rct values are not better than that of the film formed with 6 s of PRE; in other words their electrochemical activity is not better than that of the film formed with 6 s of PRE. We mentioned already two factors that influence the electrochemical activity, i.e., double layer thickness and specific crystal facet. Other factors, such as conductivity and adhesion of the film with the substrate, also play a role in the electrocatalytic activity of the film for triiodide reduction. Though the specific crystal facet is favorable in the case of the films of PtNFs, obtained at 15 s and 3600 s, other factors are apparently not very favorable for their electrochemical activity (Fig. 6 and Table 1).
Performance of the DSSCs with PtNFs and sputtered Pt
Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs with PtNFs, obtained at different cathodic polarization times, and with sputtered Pt were obtained under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which is defined as 1 sun (Fig. 8); the figure also includes the J–V curve of a DSSC with PtNFs (6 s) which is further coated with a layer of sputtered Pt. Nyquist plots were also obtained for the cells in Fig. 8. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The best power-conversion efficiency (η) of 7.74% was reached in the case of 6 s. With reference to a sputtered-Pt CE, PtNF-CE rendered much higher η for its DSSC.

Even though PtNF-CE (6 s) presented a high performance, a SEM image of the PtNFs in this case shows gaps between the PtNF clusters; such exposed substrate could be somewhat detrimental to the performance of the pertinent cell. To eliminate such a possibility, a thin platinum layer (thickness = 2 nm) was sputtered directly on the PtNFs, obtained with a tc of 6 s. The results in Table 3 show that there is an enhancement in the Jsc from 17.07 to 17.79 mA cm−2, and also an increase in the Voc from 0.68 to 0.69 V for the cell with the sputter coating on PtNFs (6 s), with reference to these values of the cell with bare PtNFs. It is clear that the sputter coating has filled up some uncovered (PtNFs) portions on the substrate with Pt, and thereby increased the conductivity and reduced the internal resistance of the counter electrode, consequently enhancing the Jsc and Voc. A reversed procedure, i.e., sputtering before PRE, was also tested, through cyclic voltammetry. The reaction, however, was too rapid (because of the sputtered platinum surface, which was not suitable for the deposition of the PtNFs under our experimental conditions); a film had formed instantly and cracked after just one cycle of scanning.

Fig. 9 shows electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs with PtNFs (6 s), sputtered Pt, and PtNFs coated with a layer of sputtered Pt, obtained under 100 mW cm−2; the insets show a zoomed-in version of Rct1 and the equivalent circuit model.

Each of the Nyquist plots consists of three semicircles, and they represent, from left to right, the electro-catalytic resistance at the interface between the electrolyte and the CE (Rct1), the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2), and the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Zw). Since a very thin spacer (syrlyn) of 25 μm was used in the DSSC, Zw is insignificant and has merged with Rct2. The values of series resistance (Rs) for the DSSCs with PtNFs (6 s), sputtered Pt, and PtNFs coated with a layer of sputtered Pt are 15.6, 19.4, and 14.8 Ω, respectively. The tendency of Rs agrees with both the tendencies of fill factor (FF) and Voc in Table 3, implying that the DSSC with a smaller Rs shows a higher Voc and FF. The values of Rct2 for the DSSCs with PtNFs (6 s), sputtered Pt, and PtNFs coated with a layer of sputtered Pt were also calculated from Fig. 9 to be 17.6, 18.0, and 18.0 Ω, respectively. It can be seen that the values of Rct2 are nearly the same, because only CE's differ here. The Rct1 portions of the cells are magnified in the inset. From the inset, the values of Rct1 for the DSSCs with PtNFs (6 s), sputtered Pt, and PtNFs coated with a layer of sputtered Pt could be calculated to be 3.3, 4.5, and 3.1 Ω, respectively. This order agrees with the tendency of Rs and confirms the results of the I–V curves of these DSSCs.
It can be noted that in 6 and 15 s samples, the 15 s sample shows a higher current density (see Table 3), even though its electrochemical activity is smaller than that of 6 s sample (see Fig. 6). In order to explain this discrepancy, we have investigated the effect of reflectance of the PtNFs counter electrode on the photocurrent density. Fig. 10 shows UV-Vis reflectance spectra of the PtNFs electrodes, obtained at different cathodic polarization times and also for the case of 6 s + sputtered Pt. The counter electrode, PtNFs (1 s) shows the highest reflectance. This may be attributed to its smooth morphology (Fig. 2 (a)), which is very different from those of other Pt films. However, the photocurrent density of the DSSC with PtNFs (1 s) is the lowest of all. This can be due to the poor electrocatalytic ability of PtNFs (1 s) (Fig. 6). PtNFs (2 s) shows the lowest reflectance (Fig. 10) and low electrocatalytic ability (Fig. 6); therefore the corresponding photocurrent density is very low (Table 3). When the tc is further increased to 6 s and 15 s, the reflectance increased as well, with corresponding increases in the photocurrents. Thus, this tendency of reflectance agrees very well with the tendency of photocurrent density. The 15 s cell shows a higher current density than 6 s cell (see Table 3), even though the electrochemical activity of the 15 s CE is smaller than that of 6 s CE (see Fig. 6). This discrepancy is due the higher reflectance of 15 s CE, than that of 6 s CE (See Fig. 10). The PtNFs (6 s) coated with a layer of sputtered Pt shows a higher reflectance, compared to that of bare PtNFs (6 s); therefore the former shows a higher photocurrent than the latter (see Table 3). With very high catalytic ability (Fig. 6) and reflectance (Fig. 10), the PtNFs (6 s) coated with a layer of sputtered Pt renders for its DSSC the highest photocurrent of all (Table 3).

Conclusions
In this study, PtNF-CEs were prepared by a simple PRE process without extreme conditions like high temperature or vacuum. The PtNFs show distinct surface structures with different physical properties. EDS and XRD confirm the existence of only Pt in the films of PtNFs. A mechanism is proposed for the morphological changes depending on the changes in the cathodic polarization time. Texture coefficients (TC), grain sizes of PtNF particles, roughness factor, specific mass area of the Pt films (electro-active surface area per unit mass of Pt), and charge transfer resistances (Rct1) of the films with PtNFs were all estimated. By analyzing the data from the CVs and the EIS, the electro-catalytic abilities of the PtNFs were compared and optimized. A relationship between the surface structure of PtNFs film and preferential crystal plane of the film was established by combining the results of SEM, XRD, and CV. The superior catalytic ability of the sharp spike morphology is explained with the theory of double layer thickness, and crystal facet activity. Based on the knowledge of the above studies and optimization, DSSCs were assembled with the as-prepared PtNF-CEs. In the case of sharp spike PtNFs, the device reached a high performance with a Voc of 0.68 V, Jsc of 17.07 mA cm−2, and an η of 7.74%. A layer of sputtered Pt on this PtNFs (6 s) has further increased the η of the pertinent cell to 8.13%.
This study provides many directions for future research. First, by tuning the PRE parameter, tc, the Pt structure could be optimized in different deposition solutions that contain various ions or surfactants, which adsorb on the Pt surface. Second, since PtNF films are obtained without high temperature, they are promising to be applied on flexible plastic substrates like ITO-PEN or ITO-PET. Furthermore, different techniques, e.g., vapor deposition, can be tried to fill up the gaps among the PtNFs, and the corresponding enhancements in the performance of the DSSCs can be studied.
