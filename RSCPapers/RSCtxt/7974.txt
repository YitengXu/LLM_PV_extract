    , Accepted 15th July 2015First published on 15th July 2015AbstractBesides the relatively high redox potential of the adopted S2−/Sn2− polysulfide redox couple electrolyte, the parasitic charge recombination process is another significant factor that limits the open-circuit voltage and consequent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Herein, we report a facile method to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives to suppress the charge recombination occurring at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces. Impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements reveal that the PEG additive in the polysulfide electrolyte reduces interfacial recombination when compared with the conventional polysulfide electrolyte in the absence of the PEG additive. A dramatic enhancement of PCE from 5.80% to 6.74% was observed with the introduction of 15 wt% PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte in CdSe based QDSCs. Moreover, the PEG additive also improves the photovoltaic performance stability of the resultant cells.
1. Introduction
Due to the unique optoelectronic properties, such as the high light absorption coefficient, conveniently tunable light harvesting range, and large dipole, the application of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as an alternative light harvesting material to conventional molecular dyes in sensitized solar cells is attracting increasing attention.1–5 Similar to its analogue dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) comprise a photoanode (QD-sensitized mesoporous nanocrystalline metal oxide, commonly TiO2), counter electrode, and electrolyte.6–8 As a vital component of QDSCs, the electrolyte performs the function of QD regeneration as well as the charge transfer between the photoanode and counter electrode.9,10 The polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple aqueous solution electrolyte is commonly used in QDSCs since this electrolyte medium can stabilize the commonly used chalcogenide QD sensitizers and can also offer an acceptable photovoltaic performance to the resultant QDSCs.11–15 Because of the relatively high redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte, the obtained open-circuit (Voc) values in QDSCs, usually less than 0.65 V, are substantially lower than those in DSCs (up to 1.0 eV).16–20 To improve the photovoltaic performance especially the Voc value in QDSCs, alternative redox couples with a relatively low redox potential, including I−/I3−,21 Co2+/3+ complexes,22,23 and organic redox couples,24–26 have been explored. Unfortunately, the commonly used cadmium chalcogenide QDs can hardly survive in the above mentioned electrolyte medium, with a poor stability of the resultant cell devices.
Besides the redox potential of the electrolyte system, the parasitic charge recombination process is another important factor that affects Voc and the consequent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of cell devices.27 A known method to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSC systems is the introduction of a series of additives such as deoxycholic acid (DCA),28 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP)29 and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN),30 into the I−/I3− electrolyte. These additives can suppress the charge recombination and tune the Fermi level of TiO2, therefore brings forward the improvement of performance in the resulting DSC devices. This empirical success promotes us to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with electrolyte additives to improve the performance of the resulting QDSCs. In fact, similar work has been explored in recent reports on QDSCs.31–38 For example, a polysulfide based hydrogel or ionic liquid electrolyte was tested in QDSCs to improve the stability of the designed cells.31–36 Molecular dipoles were used to tune the Fermi level of TiO2 and therefore affect the Voc.37,38 Although recent advances are very impressive, the improvement of the cell stability is at the sacrifice of photovoltaic performance or vice versa in almost all of the previous literature studies. Therefore, the further development of QDSCs with both high PCE and long-term stability is highly desirable, and also becomes a great challenge.
Herein, we report a modified polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase the performance (including both PCE and cell stability) of the resultant QDSCs. As a kind of nonionic polymer, PEG was commonly used as a stabilizer or a capping ligand in the preparation of inorganic nanomaterials because it could adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles via the strong interaction force.39,40 It is expected that the PEG additive in the polysulfide electrolyte can serve as a protective layer over both TiO2 and QDs surfaces by the steric hindrance effect, consequently retarding the unwanted charge recombination between the photoanode and the electrolyte and improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. CdSe based QDSCs were selected as a model cell to evaluate the effect of the modified redox electrolyte. Experimental results indicate that the PCE of QDSCs based on the polysulfide electrolyte containing an optimal concentration of PEG shows an improvement of 16.2% over the reference cells using the polysulfide electrolyte without the PEG additive, together with an additional beneficial effect of improved cell stability.
2. Experimental section
Chemicals
Oleic acid (90%) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. 1-Octadecene (ODE, 90%), selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), oleylamine (OAm, 95%), sulfur powder (99.99%), polyethylene glycol (PEG) (20000) and PEG (4000) were received from Aldrich. All reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Preparation of oil-soluble CdSe QDs
The oil-soluble CdSe QDs capped by oleylamine (OAm) were synthesized by a slightly modified literature method.41 Typically, 0.4 mL of 1.0 M Se solution, prepared by dissolving Se powder into trioctylphosphine (TOP), was mixed with 0.6 mL of TOP and 10 mL of OAm. Under the protection of high purity nitrogen, the above solution was heated to 275 °C, followed by the injection of 1.0 mL of 0.4 M Cd precursor prepared by dissolving CdO in oleic acid and ODE (v/v, 1:1) at 250 °C. Then, the reaction system was heated to 285 °C and kept at this temperature for 6 min. After the precipitation and centrifugation procedure with the addition of methanol and acetone, purified oil-soluble CdSe QDs with an average particle size of 5.4 ± 0.4 nm were obtained. The oil-soluble CdSe QDs were dispersed in chloroform solution for further use. The transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, PL emission and absorption spectra of the obtained CdSe QDs are available in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The absorption spectra of the CdSe QD films with and without PEG–polysulfide electrolyte treatment have also been given in Fig. S2 in the ESI.†
Preparation of MPA-capped water-soluble CdSe QDs
The hydrophilic CdSe QDs were prepared according to our reported procedure.42,43 Briefly, 2 mmol of MPA was dissolved in 1.0 mL methanol, and the pH value was then adjusted to 10.0 by the addition of NaOH aqueous solution. The above MPA-methanol solution was added into 20 mL of CdSe QD chloroform solution with stirring at room temperature for 120 min. The MPA capped CdSe QDs were extracted from chloroform solution by adding 20.0 mL deionized water. After centrifugation and precipitation, the hydrophilic CdSe QDs capped by MPA were obtained. The obtained MPA capped CdSe QDs were dispersed in 1.5 mL deionized water followed by adjusting pH value to 10 for further use.
Assembly of the sealed QDSCs
According to the reported method, TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes composed of transparent layers (9.0 ± 0.5 μm) and light scattering layers (6.0 ± 0.5 μm) were first prepared through the screen-printing technique over the FTO glass substrate (8 Ω per square) that was pre-treated by TiCl4 aqueous solution (0.04 M).44 During cell device construction, sensitized photoanodes were obtained by pipetting MPA-capped water-soluble CdSe QDs on TiO2 film electrodes and staying for 2 h. According to our previous study,45 inorganic ZnS/SiO2 overcoating layers can form the energy barriers over the surface of the photoanode, and accordingly suppress the unwanted charge recombination between the photoanode and the electrolyte. Therefore, the adopted photoanodes were then treated with ZnS/SiO2 double barrier coating layers. Typically, the CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 film electrodes were first coated with ZnS barrier layers by dipping the electrode alternately into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 solution in methanol and 0.1 M Na2S solution in methanol and water mixture solvent (1/1, v/v) for 4 cycles with 1 min per dip, followed by sintering at 300 °C for 2 min. After cooling to room temperature, the photoanodes were soaked in a tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) solution (containing of TEOS, ammonium hydroxide, 2:8 (v/v) mixture of deionized water and ethanol) at 35 °C for 2 h to form a SiO2 layer on the surface of QDs and TiO2.45
The cell was assembled by agglutinating the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and the Cu2−xS/FTO CE using a Surlyn ring (DuPont) of 60 μm thickness. The electrolyte was injected into the cells via pre-drilled holes on the counter electrode, and the hole was then sealed with a thin glass slide. A black mask (0.125 cm2) was used in the subsequent photovoltaic studies. All cell samples studied were constructed with the same batch of photoanodes and Cu2−xS/FTO counter electrodes but with polysulfide electrolytes (1.0 M Na2S and S aqueous solution) containing different concentrations of PEG. To minimize the sampling deviation, the average photovoltaic performances of five cell devices in parallel under each electrolyte composition were adopted. Cu2−xS/FTO counter electrodes were prepared according to a literature method by screen-printing pre-prepared Cu2−xS nanoparticles on a FTO substrate.46 Detailed procedures are described in the ESI.†
Characterization
UV/vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101 PC) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse Varian), respectively. Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by dropping dilute QD dispersion in toluene on copper grids with a carbon support followed by drying naturally in air at room temperature. Current–voltage curves (J–V curves) of the cell devices were tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G solar light (Oriel, Model no. 94022A) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 full sun). The photoactive area was 0.235 cm2 defined by a black plastic disk, while a black mask with an aperture area of 0.125 cm2 was used during measurements to avoid stray light completely. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a Keithley 2000 multimeter, and a spectral product DK240 monochromator with a 300 W tungsten lamp provided illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). EIS was measured under dark conditions at different forward bias currents ranging from 0 V to 0.60 V, applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. In OCVD measurements, samples were illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the dependence of photovoltage on time was recorded after switching-off the light.
3. Results and discussion
To evaluate the effect of PEG additives in the polysulfide electrolyte and determine the optimum concentration of PEG used, a model CdSe QDSC was constructed by our recently developed capping ligand induced self-assembly approach.42,43,47 Due to the convenient availability and effectiveness, PEG-4000 and PEG-20000 were the most used PEG series products in previous literature studies.48 Herein, a mixture of PEG-4000 and PEG-20000 with a weight ratio of 1:1 was used since the mixability of the mixture in polysulfide aqueous solution is greater than either PEG-4000 alone or PEG-20000 alone. For simplicity, this mixture is simplified as PEG hereafter unless specially specified. The CdSe QDs with particle size of 5.4 ± 0.4 nm were selected as sensitizer for their facile and well-developed synthetic method and the relatively good photovoltaic performance for the resulting QDSCs.41,46,49 All cell devices were constructed by assembling the sensitized photoanode, Cu2−xS/FTO counter electrode and polysulfide electrolytes containing different concentrations of PEG as the hole transporter. Details about experiments are described in the Experimental section. To minimize the sampling deviation, the average photovoltaic performance of cell devices was obtained by measuring at least five parallel devices under AM 1.5G one sun illumination.
Photovoltaic performance
The dependence of photovoltaic performance of CdSe QDSCs on the concentration of PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte is shown in Fig. 1. For clarity, the photovoltaic parameters of both average values and champion cells corresponding to cell devices based on various concentrations of PEG additives in polysulfide electrolyte solution are summarized in Table 1. The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of each tested cell devices based on the polysulfide electrolyte containing different concentrations of PEG additives are available in Fig. S3–S7 and Tables S1–S5 of the ESI.† Experimental data show that the PCEs of QDSCs are systematically improved with the increase of the PEG concentration in the polysulfide electrolyte. Since the up-limit of mixability of PEG with the adopted polysulfide electrolyte solution at room temperature is ∼15%, investigation on higher PEG concentration has to be given up. Even though the PEG concentration is as low as 1 wt% in the polysulfide electrolyte, an enhancement of 3.3% in the PCE of the resultant cells is obtained in comparison with the reference cells in the absence of PEG in the electrolyte. The cells based on 15 wt% PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte possess the best PCE of 6.74% (short-circuit Jsc = 15.66 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage Voc = 0.646 V, fill factor FF = 0.666) under AM 1.5G one sun illumination, with an improvement of 16.2% in PCE compared to the reference cells. It is highlighted that the obtained 6.74% PCE is believed to be one of the highest efficiencies in the CdSe based QDSCs. The enhancement of PCE of QDSCs could be ascribed to the reduction of charge recombination between the photoanode and electrolyte solution via the steric hindrance effect of PEG absorbed on TiO2/QDs/interfaces.

From Fig. 1b and c, we can further find out that the improved PCE in the resulting cells is mainly derived from the enhanced Voc and FF values, while the contribution from the Jsc can be negligible. The unchanged Jsc values corresponding to different electrolyte compositions are also supported by similar incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves as shown in Fig. 1d. Similar IPCE properties indicate similar electron collection and/or injection efficiency of different types of cells.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
To unravel the mechanism of the enhanced Voc and FF values in the resultant cell devices with the introduction of PEG additives in the polysulfide electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) measurements were employed for the cell devices containing different concentrations of PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte under dark conditions at different forward bias, and the electrochemical parameters were extracted and analyzed with use of the standard models for QDSCs. Impedance characterization bears the capability to separate the effects of different parts in the cell device, which include sensitized photoanode, counter electrode, diffusion in the electrolyte, and series resistance at each applied forward bias (Vapp). Fig. 2 shows the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and recombination resistance (Rrec) extracted from the corresponding Nyquist curves, and the detailed Nyquist curves for each cells at different forward bias values are given in Fig. S8 of the ESI.† In IS spectra, it has been well established that Cμ reflects the dependence of electron density on the Fermi level, and therefore monitors the distribution of trap states in the band gap of the electron conductor (herein, TiO2). Rrec is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate in the interface between TiO2/electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2a, each cell exhibits similar Cμ values under each forward bias. This indicates that the PEG additive in the polysulfide electrolyte does not affect the energy level of the conduction band or the density of states of TiO2. However, with the increase of the added PEG concentration in the polysulfide electrolyte, the Rrec values are systematically enhanced in the whole applied forward bias range, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. For clarity, Nyquist plots of the cell devices based on the polysulfide electrolyte containing various concentrations of PEG additives at a forward bias of −0.60 V, which is near to the Voc value of the cells, are given in Fig. 2c, and the extracted EIS parameters are shown in Table 2. These results indicate that the recombination between TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces was effectively reduced by the PEG additive in the polysulfide electrolyte.

Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD)
The effect of PEG on the performance of the cell devices was further evaluated by the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement that was usually used to unveil the charge recombination processes.50 Since the electrolyte containing 15% PEG corresponding to the best photovoltaic performance, henceforth we only compare the cell performance based on 15% PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte with those based on the conventional polysulfide electrolyte without the addition of PEG. In a typical measurement process, the studied cell was first irradiated to a steady state by a white LED of 100 mW cm−2 and the Voc decay information was then recorded after turning off the light. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the PEG–polysulfide electrolyte based cell exhibits higher Voc and slower decay kinetics in comparison with that of the plain polysulfide electrolyte based cell, indicating that the recombination rate of photo-generated electrons with the oxidized species in the electrolyte was significantly reduced with the existence of the PEG additive in the electrolyte. The decrease of the electron recombination rate can also be revealed by the electron lifetime (τn), which was calculated from eqn (1) and the dependence of τn on the potential is illustrated in Fig. 3b: (1)where, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge.51 From Fig. 3b, one can find that τn values of the PEG–polysulfide electrolyte based cell are obviously larger than those of the reference cell at the identical voltage, demonstrating that the photo-generated electron lifetime is considerably increased by adding PEG in the polysulfide electrolyte.

Cell stability
Long-term stability of photovoltaic performance is indispensable for the practical application of QDSCs,9,33,52,53 but is often overlooked in most reports. The performance stability of the sealed cells based on the polysulfide electrolyte containing 15 wt% PEG was compared with that of cells based on the conventional polysulfide electrolyte without the PEG additive under continuous irradiation condition by using an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, the photovoltaic performance for both cells exhibits a rapid increase in the first 2 h. This phenomenon is commonly observed in liquid-junction solar cells, which could be attributed to the capillary effect of electrolyte permeation into the mesoporous TiO2 film. As anticipated, the cells based on the polysulfide electrolyte with the existence of PEG show better stability than those in the absence of PEG additives. Experimental results demonstrate that the normalized PCE values of the reference cells start to decline gradually after 12 h, and reach to about 82% of the initial values in the course of 20 h irradiation; while the cells based on an electrolyte containing the PEG additive keep nearly the best performance in the course of 30 h irradiation, and the performance decline started at ∼35 h irradiation. The temporal evolution of J–V curves for cell devices based on the conventional polysulfide electrolyte and the PEG–polysulfide electrolyte are available in Fig. S9 of the ESI.† The improved stability could be stemmed from the PEG layer adsorbed on the QD surface, which prevents photo-corrosion reported in chalcogenides under polysulfide and illumination conditions.9

4. Conclusions
In summary, an unprecedented PCE of 6.74% for CdSe-sensitized QDSCs was obtained by using the modified polysulfide electrolyte with PEG as additives. In comparison with that of the CdSe-sensitized QDSC based on a typical polysulfide electrolyte, the PCE of cells using the PEG–polysulfide electrolyte was significantly improved, and long-term stability (30 h under illumination) was also obtained. The higher PCE of the PEG–polysulfide electrolyte based cells is mainly benefited from the enhancement of Voc and the FF, which could be attributed to the reduction of the charge recombination between TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces. The reduction of charge recombination was confirmed by EIS and OCVD.
