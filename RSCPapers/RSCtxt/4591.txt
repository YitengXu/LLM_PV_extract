    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 18th April 2017AbstractIn comparison with many reported high-efficiency polymer solar cells, only 0.5% (v/v) additive is necessary to optimize a polymer/fullerene (PSFSiF/PC71BM) system, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was boosted from 2.4% to 8.0%. 2D grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is utilized to understand the relevant structural features in the blend films prepared under different processing conditions, and the BHJ morphology is also examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.
Solvent additive processing has been recognized as an effective technique in solution-processed organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices.1–4 This technique entails the addition of a small volume, ≈0.5–5% v/v, of a high-boiling-point liquid to the casting blend solutions. Additive processing has been shown to have an drastic impact on BHJ blend morphology and can significantly increase the power conversion efficiency.5 Different from solvent or thermal annealing,6 solvent additive processing7 does not necessitate an extra processing step; this in consequence will be compatible with large-area printing techniques for mass production. Many morphological investigations of solvent additives have shown their effect on increasing the crystallinity of the conjugated polymer or small molecule; the morphology of the BHJ blend is optimized either by increasing or decreasing the phase separation/purity.9–16 Interestingly, processing small molecule/fullerene active layers with solvent additives demonstrates a higher sensitivity to additive contents compared to those in polymer/fullerene systems.5,14,17 Small molecule/fullerene BHJ films cast with low (0–0.5% v/v) additive contents normally show a notable improvement in their blend morphology; however, the polymer/fullerene BHJ films usually require a relatively high additive content up to 2–3% v/v.5,18–21 Quite recently, latest reports have shown that sufficiently high PCEs can be achieved through low additive addition in polymer solar cells22–25 and nonfullerene all-polymer solar cells.26–28 According to some recent reports, a higher additive content may be unfavorable since a residual additive like 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) within the film has been implicated in slow changes in morphology over time and consequently a reduced device lifetime of polymer solar cells (PSCs).29–31
In recent years, organic conjugated polymers with regioregular molecular structures have attracted tremendous scientific interest.32–36 One major advantage of regioregularity is a greater degree of their inter-chain order, when compared to their less structurally precise counterparts. Both organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) functions require organic semiconductors with sufficient charge carrier mobilities, which is improved with a planar backbone structure, enhanced intermolecular packing, and a high degree of crystallinity.37–39 Therefore, molecular design incorporating regioregular strategies may afford more opportunities to modulate the material properties toward specific OFET or OPV device functions. One successful case by Bazan and Heeger et al.40 involved a pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) fragment. Introducing PT in a controlled fashion allows one to achieve exceptional hole mobilities in OFET devices. More recently, our group reported on the polymer PIPCP, with a regiochemically precise set of D′–A–D–A repeat units and demonstrated that bulk BHJ solar cells using PIPCP were characterized by a particularly low Eg − eVoc loss = 0.5–0.6 eV.41 We also reported on fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) based regioregular D–A polymers PSFSiF,42 see Fig. 1. Quite unexpectedly, BHJ polymer solar cells containing a blend of PSFSiF and (6,6)-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) demonstrated an increase in PCE from 2.43% to 8.5% when only 0.5 v/v% of the solvent additive DIO was added to the chloroform (CF) casting solutions. The large increase in PCE and an unusual low additive content in polymer/fullerene solar cells prompted us to better understand the photovoltaic efficiency and morphology evolution of this regioregular polymer PSFSiF/PCBM blend under additive content stress.

In this communication, we report solar cell performance together with the film morphology of PSFSiF/PC71BM blends in the presence of different additive DIO contents. Assisted by 2-D grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, these investigations provide critical insight into the thin film morphology with the additive present and further increased to higher content. Finally, it is revealed that the additive DIO has a remarkable effect on the crystalline structure of regioregular polymer PSFSiF, which will be important in better understanding the role of the processing additive in polymer solar cells and aid future molecular and device design to achieve high-performing organic solar cells with sufficient stability.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate relevant structural features.43 2-D scattering images for neat polymer films are shown in Fig. 1. PSFSiF favors a face-on orientation, with stronger reflection peaks in the out-of-plane direction at q = 1.72 Å−1, which corresponds to a short “π–π stacking” distance of 3.60 Å. Crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) were calculated from Gaussian fitting of the “lamellar” and π-stacking diffraction peaks (see ESI†).44 The CCL of the (010) π-stacking peak (Table S1†) in the nominally out-of-plane direction was 4.5 nm for neat PSFSiF, suggesting a higher degree of morphological order in FBT-analog polymer films. Note that we are using the CCL to make a relative comparison between similar materials and not using the CCL as a direct representation of the crystallite size. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation exhibits a similar trend to GIWAXS results, as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S2;† ternary conjugated polymer PSFSiF has a planar backbone structure, which is useful for achieving enhanced intermolecular contacts. Hole mobilities were calculated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model45 (see Fig. S2, ESI†); the hole mobility of PSFSiF is as high as 3.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. One major difficulty with OPVs from the polymer PIPCP was overcoming a low fill factor (FF). This, higher SCLC hole mobility theoretically could improve the FF in these solar cell devices.
The photovoltaic properties of PSFSiF were evaluated in a BHJ configuration by incorporating PC71BM as the electron acceptor. All devices were operated under an N2 atmosphere. Single-junction solar cells were made using the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al for PSFSiF (Fig. 2a),42 since interfacial issues associated with protonation46,47 of PT by PEDOT:PSS are not anticipated for FBT-containing systems. Device optimization included adjustments of solvents, additives, donor–acceptor blend ratios, and active layer thicknesses (see Table S4–S8, ESI†). Chloroform was eventually chosen as the best processing solvent, and the PSFSiF:PC71BM weight ratios were optimized to be 1:1, at a solid total concentration of 16 mg mL−1.

PSFSiF:PC71BM blends cast from a neat solvent without any treatment exhibit a relatively low PCE of 2.43%, with a corresponding open-circuit-voltage (Voc), short-circuit-current density (Jsc) and FF of 0.80 V, 7.5 mA cm−2 and 40.4%, respectively. The relatively low PCE of the as-cast device is due to the low Jsc and FF. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3b, significant improvements were observed upon the addition of only 0.5% (v/v) (DIO)21 to the processing solvent, giving highest PCE of 8.0%, with a corresponding Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.74 V, 17.0 mA cm−2 and 63.3%, respectively. Quite unexpectedly, further increasing the content of solvent additives leads to a significant decrease in device FF; solar cells processed with 1.0%, 2.0% and 3.0% DIO exhibit a gradually decreased PCE of 7.45%, 6.5% and 5.3%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2c, solar cell devices based on PSFSiF:PC71BM show an unconventional trend when incorporating processing additive DIO. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of the high-efficiency (>8.0%) polymer-fullerene solar cells are processed by the addition of an additive volume between 2% and 5%.5,38 However, the regioregular ternary conjugated polymer PSFSiF:PC71BM blend exhibits an unconventional optimal content of only 0.5%, and the device performance significantly decreased when adopting a typical additive volume of 3.0%. Previous reports have shown that a residual additive like DIO within the film has been implicated in changes in morphology and will reduce the device lifetime.29–31 In this regard, additive-less or totally additive-free will be promising for further application in a large-scale device, and understanding the additive loading of this PSFSiF:PC71BM system could be helpful in designing high-efficiency and stable photovoltaic devices.

 Fig. 3  AFM conventional height and 3D images (a–e), and TEM images (f–j) of PSFSiF-PCBM blends processed from chloroform with varying DIO contents. The scale bar for TEM is 100 nm. 
To evaluate the photoresponse of the device based on PSFSiF:PC71BM and calibrate the Jsc data, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices with or without DIO were measured (Fig. 2d). In general, all the devices show a broad EQE response from 300 to 800 nm. For the device processed from the neat solvent, the average estimated monochromatic EQE value was around 30%. In contrast, after adding 0.5% DIO, the PSFSiF:PC71BM solar cell device exhibits an average value of about 70% across the 500–750 nm range; further increasing the DIO content only slightly changes the EQE curve. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum is within 5% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. We further investigated the effect of additives on the optical properties of PSFSiF:PC71BM blend films. Fig. S5 and S6† show the UV-vis absorption spectra of the neat PSFSiF and PSFSiF:PC71BM thin films cast from the solvent w/wo DIO. When the blend films were cast with DIO, we can observe enhanced absorption in the PSFSiF region (600–700 nm). In particular, the blend film processed with 0.5% DIO exhibits most pronounced enhancement. Such a significant increase in the peak intensity indicates the change of PSFSiF in the composite film.
To clarify the effect of additive on device performance, we first examined the PSFSiF:PC71BM blend morphology under various processing conditions by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3a–e, AFM height images of PSFSiF:PC71BM films with varying DIO contents were measured. We noticed that the blend processed with DIO shows a larger surface roughness and domain sizes by AFM, likely due to the enhanced aggregation of the polymer or PCBM. DIO is believed to allow a slower crystallization process during spin-coating,5,8,48 thus improving the morphology through enhanced intermolecular ordering and well-developed network structures. In addition, with 0.5% DIO the blend film yields a rough surface, and the domain size increases with more DIO loading. For the PSFSiF:PC71BM blend, excessive DIO appears to result in unfavorable large domain sizes, which is not ideal for charge dissociation and transport. In order to confirm these results, we also investigated the film morphology by using TEM. As shown in Fig. 3f–j. the PSFSiF:PC71BM blend film cast from the neat solvent shows a large scale phase separated morphology; both polymer and fullerene molecules were strongly aggregated. After the addition of optimal 0.5% DIO, the morphology shows a change to the network structured film with inter-connected polymer nano-fibers. The phase separation scale can be estimated to be around 10 nm, which is considered a useful length scale for photovoltaic performance.1–5 For the blends with addition of 1.0% DIO, the TEM image shows similar morphological features compared to that with 0.5% DIO. However, increasing the content of DIO to 2.0% leads to a dramatically change in blend morphology. The blend shows a relatively homogenous morphology without any polymer texture structure and PCBM aggregation. Further increasing the DIO content to 3.0% induces aggregation of PCBM molecules; the ideal network structured film with inter-connected polymer nano-fibers no longer exists. Previous studies5,39,49 have demonstrated that this kind of morphology would not be useful for the exciton dissociation and charge transport process.
GIWAXS measurements were further performed to investigate relevant structural features. We examined the PSFSiF:PC71BM blends cast from chloroform with varying DIO contents (Fig. 4). The 2-D images (Fig. 4avs.b) show that the addition of the optimal 0.5% DIO content provides enhancement of both polymer and PC71BM crystallinity. Interestingly, further increasing the contents to 2.0% and 3.0%, polymer π-stacking (010) is obscured relative to the pristine PSFSiF and optimal PSFSiF:PC71BM blends. In order to further investigate the structural order and crystallinity change, CCLs were calculated from Gaussian fitting of the “lamellar” and π-stacking diffraction peaks (Table S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5, by processing the PSFSiF:PC71BM blend with different DIO contents, the CCL from the (100) peak in the out-of-plane direction exhibits the following trend: neat PSFSiF (4.2 nm) ≈ 0.0% DIO (3.6 nm) < 0.5% DIO (15.1 nm) ≈ 2.0% (14.1 nm) ≈ 3.0% DIO (14.5 nm), and the (100) peak in the in-plane direction shows a similar trend: PSFSiF (4.2 nm) ≈ 0.0% DIO (5.6 nm) < 0.5% DIO (11.4 nm) ≈ 2.0% (12.6 nm) ≈ 3.0% DIO (14.0 nm). Under the same processing conditions, the CCL from the (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction exhibits a quite different order: neat PSFSiF (4.5 nm) < 0.0% DIO (6.3 nm) ≈ 0.5% DIO (6.2 nm) > 2.0% (3.7 nm) > 3.0% DIO (2.7 nm). In summary, the blend processed from pure chloroform shows a smooth surface roughness (2.55 nm) and less crystalline domains. By adding 0.5% DIO to the processing solvent, the RMS value of the blend film increases to 4.55 nm, which may be due to the enhancement of both polymer and PC71BM crystallinity (TEM and GIWAXS). When the DIO increases to a higher content (2–3%), the RMS value of the blend film exhibits a similar value around 4.5 nm, assisted by TEM and GIWAXS characterization, a similar surface roughness may be attributed to the enhanced aggregation of fullerene molecules, in spite of the loss of ordered “π–π” intermolecular contacts in PSFSiF crystalline domain.

 Fig. 5  Crystal correlation length of PSFSiF blends from both out-of plane and in-plane (dashed) diffractions, blend electron and hole mobility as a function of DIO content. 
For a complete comparison, electron and hole mobilities in a diode configuration38 were further measured using PSFSiF blends with varying DIO contents (Fig. S3 and S4, Table S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5, both electron and hole mobilities were greatly improved and achieved a highest value by adding 0.5% DIO (7.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes) the hole mobilities gradually decreased with increased DIO loadings (9.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2.0% DIO and 5.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 3.0% DIO); however, the electron mobilities remain almost the same even at higher DIO loadings. This correlates with the observation that the scattering peak and CCL related to PC71BM exhibits similar values (see Table S2, ESI†). Sufficient charge mobility and balanced electron and hole mobility contribute to a higher FF,50,51 and so in PSFSiF:PC71BM blends, the decreased hole mobility at higher DIO contents breaks the balance between hole and electron transport. This may be a reason that gradually decreased FF and photovoltaic performance are observed with an increased DIO loading. According to the CCL analysis, the loss of ordered “π–π” intermolecular contacts may account for the decreased blend hole mobility.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we disclose the characterization of high-efficiency polymer solar cells under processing additive stress, incorporating a regioregular ternary conjugated polymer PSFSiF as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor. Under ideal solvent additive addition (0.5% DIO), the films show an inter-connected network of crystalline polymer and PCBM domains with a characteristic size of ∼10 nm, concomitant with an increase in PCE from 2.4% to 8.0%. As determined through morphological studies by AFM, TEM and GIWAXS, the blend films under higher (2–3%) additive content conditions show decreased π-stacking ordering and crystallinity of PSFSiF, and less ideal blend morphology of donor and acceptor materials. The result re-emphasizes the need for achieving control of desirable device properties by optimizing both molecular structure and device processing in the future.
