    , Accepted 14th July 2019First published on 23rd July 2019AbstractTwo NIR BODIPY dyes T′2P2A and T′′2P2A were synthesized and used as photosensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). T′2P2A and T′′2P2A were designed by incorporation of bis-thienyl vinyl and thienothiophene vinyl side-arms in the structure. This leads to a red shift in the absorption spectra leading to an enhancement in the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). A high IPCE value of 64% at 750 nm and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.06% were observed for the T′2P2A based DSSC. Furthermore, based on the complementary absorption spectra of TP2A and T′2P2A, even more efficient co-sensitized DSSCs were fabricated. The DSSC based on TP2A + T′2P2A shows an enhancement in the IPCE from 47% to 74% at 550 nm compared to that based on the single dye system T′2P2A. Finally, a high PCE of 6.67% was obtained for the TP2A + T′2P2A co-sensitized DSSC, which was higher than the performances of each individual dye.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have fascinated scientists with their impressive performances. Since the inception of DSSCs, significant studies have been conducted for their development but they are still lacking in several features. To effectively generate power, DSSCs are composed of four successive layers; a nanostructured semiconductor, photosensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode.1–4 Among the architecture components, the dye in DSSCs plays a central role in harnessing energy from the maximum incident light. In this regard, numerous metal based dyes and organic dyes have shown impressive photovoltaic responses.5–16 However, due to the scarcity and complex synthesis process, metal-based dyes remain quite unpopular for large scale production. In contrast, metal free organic dyes with push–pull structures are favourable due to their ability to introduce a wide range of functional groups which can be molecularly engineered in the organic framework of the sensitizer to enhance the light harvesting ability and achieve a high molecular extinction coefficient which eventually results in high performance DSSCs.17–22
Among the existing donor–acceptor organic dyes, boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) has shown potential in DSSCs due to its strong absorption in the visible region and tuneable optical properties. Numerous configurations of the BODIPY core obtained by varying the side arms have been reported and verified but they showed poor to moderate photovoltaic performances.23–25 One of the real reasons behind such low photovoltaic performances of BODIPY based DSSCs was the weak regeneration of the driving force between the ground state oxidation potential of the BODIPY core and the redox potential of the electrolyte.26 Moreover, low photovoltage in BODIPY based DSSCs is observed due to the charge recombination which originates from the interaction of flat BODIPY on top of the TiO2 photoanode. To overcome this problem, Ziessel et al. substituted fluorine atoms at the boron centre with alkynyl-polyethylene glycol chains.27 In other instances, low incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in BODIPY based DSSCs is observed because the BODIPY dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level is very close to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 photoanode. Such a close position of the LUMO level results in a small driving force for the injection of the excited state electrons into TiO2.28 Fluorine substitution at the boron centre is also known to significantly decrease the electron affinity of BODIPY dyes, partially solving this injection issue.29 In the previous study, we synthesized BODIPY dyes TP2A and T2P2A (shown in Fig. 1) by using 5-hexyl-thienyl vinyl substituents through Knoevenagel reactions, which resulted in a significant red shift in the absorption spectra by more than 100 nm. As a result, the IPCE spectrum of the corresponding (T2P2A) dye-based DSSC showed a broad response of >60% in the 560–760 nm region which resulted in a 5.75% power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, to increase the performances of BODIPY dye based DSSCs further rational design is required to enhance the IPCE up to the NIR region.

In this study, we report BODIPY dyes, named T′2P2A and T′′2P2A, containing bis-vinyl-2,2′-bithiophene and bis-vinyl thieno[3,2-b]thiophene substituents, respectively (Fig. 1). The extended conjugation, in regard to previously reported mono-thiophene derivative dyes, not only red-shifts the absorbance but also increases the absorbance wavelength range of the new T′2P2A and T′′2P2A dyes. Indeed, absorptions on the TiO2 film up to 900 nm with a broad absorption in the 600–850 nm wavelength region have been recorded for the T′′2P2A BODIPY dye. As a result, DSSC devices exhibit an IPCE of 64% at 750 nm and a PCE of 6.06% with the T′2P2A dye. The T′′2P2A dye based DSSC showed an IPCE of 52% at 750 nm and a PCE of 3.44%. Finally, the co-sensitized DSSCs using a mixture of the complementary absorbing dyes of TP2A and T′2P2A showed the highest PCE of 6.76% with the following photovoltaic parameters: a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.80 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.556 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.683.

2.2. Fabrication and measurement of solar cells
The double layer TiO2 photoanode with a thickness of (10 + 5) μm was screen printed on top of FTO coated glass (R = 8 to 10 ohm−2) and calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. A solution containing acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol with a volume ratio of 1:1 (v/v) was prepared. 0.2 mM solutions of the BODIPY dyes T′2P2A or T′′2P2A were mixed in this solution for single-dye-based DSSCs. The TiO2 coated substrates were dipped in the dye solutions and maintained at 35 °C for 12 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 film. For the co-sensitized DSSCs, the TiO2 photoanodes were dipped into a 1:1 (0.2 mM:0.2 mM) molar ratio solution of the two respective dyes for 24 h. The co-adsorbent deoxycholic acid (20 mM) was added to the dye solutions for both single dye sensitization and co-sensitization systems. Finally, the platinum-coated substrate was utilized as the counter-electrode. The FTO and the platinum coated substrates were sealed by heating the polymer frame with a 30 μm thick Surlyn spacer separator. The electrolyte containing 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.05 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was injected into the sealed devices. Current–voltage characteristics were measured under standard AM 1.5 G sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan). IPCE spectra were measured with monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 by using a CEP-2000BX Bunko-Keiki simulator. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra were measured using a potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron1255B) under open-circuit conditions based on monochromatic illumination (420 nm). The charge extraction method was performed using the same light source. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using a WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of BODIPY sensitizers T′2P2A and T′′2P2A
The synthetic procedures are depicted in Scheme 1.
The starting step is a Knoevenagel condensation between the active hydrogen compound BODIPY core (called BODIPY 1 in Scheme 1) and the aldehyde A (alkylated thieno[3,2-b]thiophene aldehyde) and the aldehyde B (alkylated 2,2′-bisthiophene aldehyde), respectively, in the presence of piperidine and trace amounts of p-TsOH. We followed the reaction progress based on the colour, which was magenta and blue for the mono and di-substituted compounds, respectively. The second step involved fluorine substitution by reacting the Grignard reagent, synthesized from the BF2 derivative, with the PEG-alkyl derivative. Finally, a flow of carbon monoxide with a [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] catalyst (10 mol%) and ethanol was used to convert the phenyliodo group into an ethoxycarbonylphenyl group. After this the obtained esters were converted to the acid form to achieve the final dyes T′2P2A and T′′2P2A.
3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The two newly synthesized BODIPY dyes T′2P2A and T′′2P2A show two distinctive absorption peaks in solution (Fig. 2). The first peak at high energy exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient in the 350–450 nm range, and has been assigned to the bis vinyl-thienyl residues. The second absorption peak in the near IR region is attributed to the lowest S0–S1 energy transitions in BODIPY cores. Going from the T′2P2A to T′′2P2A dye, both peaks are slightly red shifted highlighting the extended π-conjugation in the 2,2′-bisthiophene in comparison with the fused thieno[3,2-b] thiophene unit (Table 1). Furthermore, the absence of aggregation in solution in these dyes can be confirmed from the match between excitation and absorption spectra (Fig. S3†). For all new dyes, the fluorescence spectrum mirrors that of absorption (Fig. S3†). The relatively weak Stokes shifts and the short lifetimes (between 0.9 ns and 5 ns) are typical for singlet-excited states. In all cases, the excitation spectra perfectly match the absorption spectra, confirming the absence of aggregation of the dyes (Fig. S3†).

Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the dyes T′2P2A and T′′2P2A in comparison to our previously reported TP2A dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The spectra were broadened compared to those in solution, due to the interaction between carboxylic groups in these dyes and the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, because of the presence of two styryl legs per BODIPY unit, T′2P2A and T′′2P2A absorption spectra also exhibited a larger wavelength range than the spectrum of the TP2A dye. The absorption of T′′2P2A is more red-shifted as compared to that of T′2P2A. The redox characteristics were measured by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane solution using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte and the data are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4. Both T′2P2A and T′′2P2A dyes exhibited two anodic processes assigned to the formation of the radical cation and dication. The new dyes contain two side-arms made up of either bis-thienyl vinyl or thienothiophene vinyl and can be directly compared to our previously reported dye T2P2A (which contains two side-arms of vinyl thienyl). The reduction signals of T′2P2A and T′′2P2A are, respectively, 40 mV and 70 mV less cathodic compared to those of the previously reported T2P2A. Furthermore, the excited state oxidation potentials (D+/D*) of T′′2P2A and T′2P2A were measured to investigate the ability of dyes to inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. The potentials of T′2P2A and of T′′2P2A were found to be −0.94 V and −0.85 V (vs. SCE), respectively, which are sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (estimated to be −0.82 V vs. SCE). The electrons injected from the excited-state compete with the radiative and nonradiative decays. As shown in Table 1, the rates of the radiative and nonradiative decays of T′2P2A and T′′2P2A are about 107 s−1. The excited-state lifetime of T′2P2A and T′′2P2A is in the order of about 10−9 s, which is about 3 orders of magnitude longer than the reported electron injection rate.31 These findings ensure that T′2P2A and T′′2P2A can sufficiently inject the electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 (details are in Tables 1 and 2).

3.3. Photovoltaic properties
Based on the appealing photophysical properties of T′2P2A and T′′2P2A dyes, DSSCs were fabricated. The photovoltaic properties of DSSCs sensitized with TP2A, T′2P2A and T′′2P2A are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. DSSCs fabricated with the TP2A dye showed high photovoltaic responses in the visible region. However, at 750 nm the IPCE was limited to less than 1% only. As shown by the absorption spectra in Fig. 3, DSSCs based on T′2P2A and T′′2P2A showed significant red-shifted absorption extended up to 900 nm. Consequently, at 750 nm the IPCEs were recorded to be 64% and 52% for T′2P2A and T′′2P2A based DSSCs, respectively. The IPCE of the T′2P2A-based DSSC is even more impressive with a value of more than 60% in the 610 nm to 760 nm region, which is the best IPCE for any NIR BODIPY dye-based DSSC reported to date.

 Fig. 5  (a) IPCE spectra and (b) J–V curves for DSSCs with the TP2A, T′2P2A and T′′2P2A BODIPY dyes. 
The TP2A dye-based DSSC showed the best photovoltaic parameters of JSC, VOC, FF and overall PCE (η) of 11.40 mA cm−2, 0.526 V, 0.710 and 4.26%, respectively (Fig. 5b and Table 3). The T′2P2A based DSSC showed a high JSC of 16.10 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.536 V and FF = 0.702. The higher JSC for the T′2P2A based DSSC was observed due to its broader IPCE extending up to the NIR region. The T′2P2A based DSSC showed a high η of 6.06%, which is the highest PCE reported for BODIPY-based DSSCs to date. For the other T2′′P2A based DSSC, a PCE of 3.44% was measured with the following parameters: JSC = 12 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.457 V and FF = 0.628.
From Fig. 3, it can be observed that TP2A and T′2P2A showed good complementary absorption properties in the 500–600 nm and 600–800 nm regions, respectively. Hence, we combined them to fabricate co-sensitized DSSCs. As anticipated, the co-sensitized DSSC based on TP2A and T′2P2A showed an IPCE higher than 60% over the whole 340–750 nm region with an IPCE onset at 860 nm. Based on this feature, a high JSC of 17.80 mA cm−2 was measured for the co-sensitized DSSC with an increased VOC of 0.556 V and a FF of 0.683, resulting in a PCE of 6.76% for the TP2A + T′2P2A co-sensitized device (Fig. 6 and Table 3). This result is the highest efficiency reported to date for BODIPY-sensitizer based devices.

3.4. CEM and IMVS measurements
The electron lifetime (τ) is strongly linked to the VOC of the DSSCs. To comprehend the distinctions of the VOC values for the DSSCs fabricated with TP2A, T2′P2A and T2′′P2A single dyes on one hand and TP2A + T′2P2A co-sensitized dyes on the other hand, the relative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes in the DSSC devices were examined. We measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of the charge extraction method (CEM). DSSCs sensitized with both single and co-sensitized dyes exhibit a similar linear increase in electron density as a function of VOC, indicating that DSSCs fabricated with these dyes have similar conduction band edges to TiO2 regardless of the type of dye (Fig. 7a). To further investigate the reason for the differences between the VOC values of the respective DSSCs, we measured the τ of the DSSCs fabricated with TP2A, T2′P2A or T2′′P2A single dyes and with the mixture of TP2A and T′2P2A dyes. Fig. 7(b) shows the τ of the DSSCs as a function of VOC. It is clear that at a constant VOC, the lifetime increases in the order T2′′P2A < TP2A < T2′P2A < TP2A + T′2P2A, which is in accord with the order of increasing VOC observed for the DSSCs.

4. Conclusion
In summary, two new BODIPY NIR efficient sensitizers were designed as photosensitizers and co-sensitizers for DSSC applications. We showed that the thienothiophene unit in T′2P2A could efficiently restrain the charge recombination as compared to the bisthiophene moiety used in T′′2P2A. Moreover, DSSCs based on T′2P2A exhibited a high IPCE of 68% with a best PCE of 6.06%. Such a good value is the best PCE reported for any NIR BODIPY dye. Because of the complementary absorption properties of TP2A and T′2P2A in the ranges of 500–600 nm and 600–800 nm, respectively, co-sensitized DSSCs were naturally fabricated based on these two dyes. DSSC devices using co-sensitization exhibited increased PCEs with a best result of 6.76%. This PCE is higher than the efficiency of each individual single dye based DSSC by 58% and 11%, respectively. These results reveal the importance of molecular engineering for designing efficient BODIPY sensitizers for DSSC applications.
