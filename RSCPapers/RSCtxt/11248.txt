    , Accepted 2nd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractLanthanide (Ln3+)-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), exhibiting excellent optical properties such as long photoluminescence lifetime, narrow emission bandwidth, and low autofluorescence background, have been applied in many fields, especially in biological analysis and medical diagnostics. Despite the exciting progress, the applications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs are hindered by the small absorption cross-section and low upconversion luminescence efficiency of Ln3+. To this regard, several effective strategies associated with energy transfer designing have been proposed to modulate the upconversion luminescence properties of Ln3+ in the past few decades. In this feature article, we focus on the most recent development of optical property designing in Ln3+-doped UCNPs on the basis of energy transfer between Ln3+–Ln3+, Ln3+–dyes, and Ln3+–quantum dots. Some future efforts towards the energy transfer designing in Ln3+-doped UCNPs are also proposed.

1. Introduction
Photon upconversion (UC) that is capable of sequentially absorbing two or more low-energy photons followed by emitting high-energy photons is an intriguing nonlinear optical phenomenon.1–5 This phenomenon was first discovered based on the second-harmonic generation by Franken in the 1960s.6 Later on, Kaiser and Garrett found another type of UC process by taking advantage of multiphoton absorption in the CaF2:Eu2+ crystal.7 However, both processes require expensive ultrashort pulsed lasers to reach higher energy levels for photon UC. In comparison with the second-harmonic generation and multiphoton absorption, lanthanide (Ln3+)-based UC firstly reported by Auzel in 1966 utilized energy transfer between the doped Ln3+ ions by means of their long-lived excited state upon excitation with a low-cost continuous-wave diode laser.8 In the following 30 years, photon UC primarily focused on Ln3+-based bulk glass or crystalline materials owing to the limitations in the preparation of UC nanoparticles (NPs).8 Due to the rapid development of nanotechnology and biological sciences in the late 1990s, the optical properties and bioapplications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs have attracted more and more attention.9–11
Compared with organic dyes and quantum dots (QDs), Ln3+-doped UCNPs offer superior optical properties, such as large antenna-generated anti-Stokes shifts, narrow emission bandwidths, and high photostability, which make them suitable for various applications.12–23 Particularly, Ln3+-doped UCNPs have been widely applied in bioimaging, biodetection, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, gene drug delivery, and theranostics.24–36 Despite the exciting research progress, the applications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs still suffer from small absorption cross-section of Ln3+, low UC luminescence (UCL) efficiency, and overheat effects. Therefore, it is imperative to design the optical properties of Ln3+-doped UCNPs to circumvent these limitations. Energy transfer pathways in Ln3+-doped UCNPs play a vital role in the process of UCL and thereby rational design of energy transfer pathways can effectively alleviate the above issues of Ln3+-doped UCNPs.
Hitherto, many reviews have highlighted the progress of chemical synthesis, optical performance optimization, and biomedical applications of UCNPs.1,3,4,12,16,17 Rather than being exhaustive, this feature article focuses on the optical property designing of Ln3+-doped UCNPs on the basis of energy transfer pathway manipulation (Scheme 1). First, we introduce the energy transfer mechanism of the UCL process in Section 2. Subsequently, we summarize the latest progress in the exploration of Ln3+-doped UCNPs in Sections 3–5, with an emphasis on the energy transfer between Ln3+ ions and Ln3+ ions, organic dyes, or QDs for modulating the UCL properties of Ln3+. Finally, some future prospects and efforts towards this active research field are envisioned.

2. Upconversion energy transfer mechanism
The UC emission of Ln3+-doped NPs usually results from several energy transfer pathways owing to the abundant energy levels of Ln3+. In order to rationally modulate and optimize the optical properties of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, it is essential to investigate their energy transfer process. In this section, we will introduce the typical energy transfer mechanism of the UCL process between Ln3+ ions and Ln3+ ions, as well as Ln3+ ions and organic dyes/quantum dots.
2.1. Energy transfer mechanism between lanthanide ions and lanthanide ions
Due to the unique ladder-like 4f energy configurations of Ln3+ ions, effective photons emitting from high energy levels can be achieved through successive photon absorption and energy transfer from their low-lying energy levels. In general, there are mainly five UCL mechanisms in Ln3+-doped NPs including excited state absorption (ESA), energy transfer upconversion (ETU), cooperative upconversion (CUC), photon avalanche (PA), and energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU).1,3,4
ESA takes the form of sequentially absorbing two pump photons by a single ion. The energy diagram of the ESA process is illustrated in Fig. 1a for a three-level system. The requirements of this mechanism consist of an equal energy gap between G/E1 and E1/E2, as well as long lifetime of the intermediate level of E1. The activator is excited from the ground state to the E1 level when the excitation energy is resonant with the energy gap between the ground state and the E1 level. Then, the second pump photon promotes the activator from E1 to high-lying level E2 before its decay to the ground state. Consequently, UC emission occurs when the E2 level returns to the ground state. To achieve efficient ESA, ladder-like energy levels are required for single doped Ln3+ ions such as Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ and Nd3+.3 Moreover, a low dopant concentration is needed to avoid the cross-relaxation (CR) between activators.
 Fig. 1  Schematic UCL mechanisms in Ln3+-doped NPs. ESA, ETU, CUC, PA, and EMU denote the excited state absorption, energy transfer upconversion, cooperative upconversion, photon avalanche, and energy migration-mediated upconversion, respectively. S, A, A′ and M denote the sensitizer, activator, accumulator, and migrator. G′, E1′, and E2′ represent the ground state, intermediate energy level, and higher energy level of the sensitizer. G, E1, and E2 refer to the ground state, intermediate energy level, and higher energy level of the activator, respectively. 
Different from ESA within a single ion, ETU is realized through energy transfer between two neighboring ions, namely a sensitizer and an activator. In the case of ETU, the sensitizer is excited from the ground state to the E1′ level and sequentially transfers its harvested energy to the emitting E2 level of the activator, while the sensitizer returns to the ground state twice (Fig. 1b). The ETU process has been widely adopted in Ln3+-doped NPs exhibiting high efficient UCL through the sensitizer/activator ion pairs, such as Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+, and Yb3+/Ho3+ with an excitation wavelength at 980 nm.10
Similar to ETU, the CUC process also involves the sensitizer and activator. The main difference is that the activator in the CUC process has no intermediate energy level. In a typical CUC process, the two sensitizers simultaneously transfer the excited energy to the higher excited state of the activator (Fig. 1c). The excited state relaxes back to the ground state followed by UC emission. The CUC process usually takes place in Yb3+-sensitized UCNPs such as Yb3+/Tb3+ or Yb3+/Eu3+ ion pairs and the efficiency is much lower than the ESA and ETU process.4
In the PA process, the E1 level is initially populated by non-resonant weak ground state absorption, followed by resonant ESA or ETU to populate the emitting energy level E2 (Fig. 1d). After this initial stage, CR energy transfer takes place between the excited activator and the ground state sensitizer, resulting in occupying the intermediate energy level E1 for both sensitizer and activator ions. Subsequently, the feedback looping of ESA (or ETU) and CR can exponentially increase the emitting energy level E2, thus producing strong UCL known as the PA UC.3 For PA UC, the pump intensity is required to be above a certain threshold.
In the case of the EMU process, four types of luminescent centers including sensitizer, accumulator, migrator, and activator are usually separated in the core–shell nanostructure. In a typical EMU process, the accumulator is populated to a higher excited state through the ETU process and then transfers the energy to the migrator, followed by random energy hopping within the migrator ions through the core–shell interface (Fig. 1e). The migrating energy is finally trapped by the activator. To effectively eliminate the deleterious CR, the sensitizer/accumulator and the activator are confined in different layers of the core–shell nanostructure.
2.2. Energy transfer mechanism between lanthanide ions and organic dyes/quantum dots
For the energy transfer between Ln3+ ions and organic dyes/quantum dots, they can be treated as the energy donor and energy acceptor, respectively. Therefore, the donor–acceptor energy transfer is introduced in the following based on the nonradiative Förster and Dexter energy transfer mechanisms and radiative energy transfer mechanism.8,37–39
The Förster energy transfer was proposed by Theodor Förster in the late 1940s and has been widely accepted and introduced in the theoretical studies of resonant energy transfer.8 Förster energy transfer can take place through a coulombic dipole–dipole interaction and thereby occur over long distance (1–10 nm). The Förster energy transfer mechanism is shown in Fig. 2a. The energy donor nonradiatively returns from the excited state to the ground state while the energy acceptor is promoted from the ground state to the excited state through the Coulombic interaction. The probability of energy transfer in this case can be given as:39 (1)where τD is the lifetime of the excited state of the donor, R is the donor–acceptor distance, and Rc is the critical radius at which the energy transfer probability is equal to the intrinsic decay rate of the donor. Rc can be achieved by eqn (2):37 (2)where K is the orientation factor, ΦD is the emission quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, n is the refractive index of the solvent, N is Avogadro's number, and J is the spectral overlap. Therefore, the probability of the Förster energy transfer is proportional to the spectral overlap between the donor and acceptor and is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the donor–acceptor distance.

Later in the 1950s, Dexter extended the Förster energy transfer to include the exchange effect based on the quantum theory.40 The Dexter energy transfer can occur through electron exchange between the donor and acceptor. The exchange interactions require the overlap of the wavefunctions between the donor and acceptor and therefore take place within a short distance (less than 1 nm). In the Dexter mechanism, the excited electron of the donor transfers to the acceptor while another electron transfers from the acceptor to the donor (Fig. 2b). The probability of the Dexter energy transfer can be expressed as follows:40 (3)where, D is the Dexter parameter, J is the spectral overlap, and L is the sum of the van der Waals radii. When electron dipole–dipole transition is allowed, the Coulombic interaction is significant even at a short distance. By contrast, the exchange interaction is dominant if the electron dipole–dipole transition is forbidden.
In the case of a radiative energy transfer process, real photons are emitted by the donor and then reabsorbed by the activator within a photon travel distance. The difference between the nonradiative and radiative energy transfer is that the lifetime of the donor is independent of the concentration of the activator due to the emitted photons. The probability of such energy transfer at a sufficient distance R is found to be:8 (4)where δA is the absorption cross-section and τS is the lifetime of the donor. J refers to the spectral overlap integral. Note that both the nonradiative energy transfer and radiative energy transfer depend on the normalized spectral overlap integral. Therefore, the small energy gap between the excited state donor and acceptor is beneficial for improving the energy transfer probability.
3. Energy transfer between lanthanide ions and lanthanide ions
Ln3+-doped UCNPs generally consist of an inorganic host matrix, sensitizer ions (e.g., Yb3+, Nd3+) and activator ions (e.g., Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+). Through the ETU or CUC process, the UC emission of activators is realized. Ln3+-doped UCNPs can emit from ultraviolet to visible and near infrared (NIR) light by optimizing the sensitizers and activators. By taking advantage of high penetration depth and low autofluorescence background, these UCNPs are suitable for various bioapplications under NIR excitation. In this section, we will focus on the energy transfer between Ln3+ and Ln3+ for improving the luminescence intensity, tuning emission wavelength, and tuning excitation wavelength, which are designed for satisfying the requirements of diverse applications.
3.1. Improving luminescence intensity
The low UCL efficiency greatly hinders the applications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs. UCL can be improved through the strategies of manipulating host materials, optimizing concentration and component of dopants, incorporating ions, designing core–shell nanostructures, plasmonic coupling, etc.41–57 Among these approaches, the component and concentration of dopant optimization, energy clustering, and energy level overlap attract considerable attention.45,51,54,58–60
The control of concentration and component of dopants is an effective and common strategy for improving the UCL of Ln3+. For example, co-doping ions such as Mn2+ and Ce3+ can enhance the luminescence of Ln3+-doped UCNPs through energy transfer between Ln3+ and Ce3+ or Mn2+.29,61–63 In the process of most UC, Yb3+ ions absorb the excitation energy and then transfer the energy to the activator ions followed by UC emission. Therefore, elevating the concentration of Yb3+ can improve the energy transfer efficiency and enhance the UCL. For example, highly enhanced UC emission was achieved in Yb3+-rich α-NaYF4:Yb,Er@CaF2 or α-NaYbF4:Tb@CaF2 NPs.45,51,54 Note that a high concentration of dopant may also cause luminescence concentration quenching and produce deleterious CR type energy transfers (CR-ETs). To minimize this CR-ET, we designed a multishell nanostructure of KSc2F7:Yb3+/Tm3+@KSc2F7@KSc2F7:Yb3+/Er3+@KSc2F7@KSc2F7:Yb3+/Ho3+@KSc2F7 through the strategy of oriented epitaxial growth and localized dopants in different layers with a large distance (>20 nm), which can effectively eliminate deleterious CR between activators (Fig. 3a and b).64 This type of Ln3+-doped UCNP by suppressing CR-ETs significantly enhanced the UCL by ∼70 times relative to that of KSc2F7:Yb3+/Tm3+ @KSc2F7:Yb3+/Er3+@KSc2F7:Yb3+/Ho3+ UCNPs without the separating layer of pure KSc2F7 (Fig. 3c).

Compared with the versatile approach of concentration and component controlling, energy clustering is an emerging and appealing approach to enhance UCL of Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Typical UCL contains three processes: absorption, energy transfer and emission. In the process of energy transfer, the excitation energy may be transferred from sensitizers to activators as well as surface defects (Fig. 4a). Therefore, UC emission can be enhanced by confining sensitizers and activators in the clusters for minimizing the long-distance energy migration to surface defects. For instance, Liu et al. developed a novel type of orthorhombic KYb2F7:Er3+ NPs by confining Yb3+ in the tetrad clusters.58 Enhanced violet UC emission was achieved in KYb2F7:Er3+ NPs with 8 times higher than NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs through effectively minimizing the excitation energy migration to surface defects (Fig. 4b). In another work, Xiong et al. realized a high UC quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.75% at a power density of 60 W cm−2 in the ordered cubic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs with minimization of the energy transfer depletion through phase transition from hexagonal to cubic structure.65 A similar energy clustering strategy for enhancing luminescence was also observed in NaYF4@NaYbF4:Tm3+@NaYF4 NPs.59

Besides the above-mentioned strategies, we recently designed a simple method for enhancing the UCL of Ln3+-doped UCNPs based on the energy level overlap of Ln3+ (Fig. 5a and b).60 Because the energy levels of Er3+ at 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F3/2 match well with those of Ho3+ at 5F4/5S2 and 5F5, energy transfer between them may easily take place. Under 1532 nm excitation, the red UCL was significantly enhanced by a factor of 41 in NaYF4:Er3+/Ho3+ NPs relative to that in NaYF4:Er3+ NPs due to the emission overlap between Er3+ and Ho3+ by elevating the concentration of Er3+ from 5 to 10 mol% (Fig. 5c). Likewise, owing to the energy transfer from Ho3+ at 5F3 and 5F5 levels to Er3+ at 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F3/2 levels, improved UC emission in NaYF4:Ho3+/Er3+ NPs can be achieved under 1150 nm excitation due to the dual emission contributions of Ho3+ and Er3+ (Fig. 5d).

3.2. Tuning excitation wavelength
In Yb3+-sensitized UCNPs, the absorption peak of Yb3+ overlaps with that of water molecules, resulting in overheat of tissues in bioapplications when the excitation source of 980 nm irradiates for a long time.66 It is urgent to explore other energy transfer UC systems for minimizing the overheat effects. Recently, Nd3+, Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+-sensitized UCNPs based on the ETU mechanism with excitation wavelengths at 808, 1532, 1150, and 1208 nm have been proposed.60,67–69 Among them, Nd3+ has drawn most attention because of its absorption wavelength at ∼800 nm, which is far away from the absorption peak of water molecules. In addition, Nd3+ has much larger cross-section at ∼800 nm (1.2 × 10−19 cm2) than Yb3+ at ∼980 nm (1.2 × 10−20 cm2), thus benefiting the generation of strong UCL. In Nd3+-sensitized NPs, UCL is usually realized through the energy transfer pathways of Nd3+ → Yb3+ → activator ions.
The core–shell nanostructure provides an effective approach for increasing the UCL intensity of Nd3+-sensitized NPs by minimizing the surface quenching effect. For example, Han et al. observed that the UC emission intensity in core–shell NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4 NPs was ∼50 times higher than that of the core-only NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+/Er3+ NPs under 800 nm excitation.55 However, the above-mentioned NPs with a low Nd3+ concentration of 0.5 mol% may still result in relatively low energy transfer efficiency. To enhance the energy transfer efficiency and UCL, confined Ln3+ ion doping in the core and shell of the core–shell nanostructures was then designed.67,70–75 Yan et al. reported a core–shell nanostructure of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+ NPs with separate energy transfer pathways for Nd3+ → Yb3+ in the shell and Yb3+ → Er3+ in the core.70 Such brilliant design can alleviate the deleterious energy transfer between Nd3+ and Er3+ and increase the concentration of Nd3+ (10 mol%) for improving UC emission. Similarly, Liu et al. designed a core–shell NaYF4:Yb3+/Nd3+/Tm3+ (Er3+, Ho3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+ UCNPs with a high concentration of Nd3+ (20 mol%) in the shell.67 By virtue of the increased amounts of Nd3+, UC emissions from Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ in the core–shell NPs were dramatically increased. Furthermore, to completely eliminate back energy transfer between Nd3+ and activators, the Yb3+-based transition layer has been constructed in the core–shell NPs and the Nd3+ concentration can be increased up to 90 mol%.71 Under 808 nm excitation, improved UCL was achieved in the sandwich-type NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Yb3+@NaNdF4:Yb3+ NPs. The designed nanostructures for typical Nd3+-sensitized UCNP emission are summarized in Table 1.

It should be noted that Nd3+ has multiple absorption positions at 740, 808, and 865 nm. Accordingly, other types of Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs were developed. Recently, Hu et al. designed a core–shell–shell nanostructure of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Yb3+@NaNdF4:Yb3+ NPs under 740 nm NIR-light-emitting diodes excitation.73 This novel excitation source has several advantages for Nd3+-sensitized UC including safe excitation light, relatively low cost, and easy operation.
In comparison with the above-mentioned excitation wavelength below 1000 nm in the first NIR (NIR-I) region, excitation light in the second NIR (NIR-II, 950–1700 nm) region possesses advantages like lower autofluorescence background and scattering lossess, resulting in marked enhancement in the tissue penetration depth and imaging resolution.76 Therefore, it is desirable to investigate novel types of UC systems with the excitation and/or emission wavelength in the NIR-II region. To this regard, Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+ are proposed as activators to emit lights in the NIR-II region.76,77 Meanwhile, they also have absorption peaks at 1532, 1150, and 1208 nm within the NIR-II region. Therefore, Er3+-, Ho3+-, and Tm3+-sensitized UCNPs were designed for bioimaging with deeper penetration depth and higher resolution.60,68,69,78,79 For instance, we reported Er3+-sensitized photon UC in NaYF4 NPs, where Yb3+ worked as a modulator to tune the UCL (Fig. 6a).79 Upon 1532-nm excitation, the UC spectrum exhibited typical emission peaks of Er3+ in single Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs (Fig. 6b). For NaYF4:Er3+/Nd3+ NPs, the emission peaks at 865 and 1060 nm corresponding to the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transitions of Nd3+ were observed, indicating that Nd3+ ions can be sensitized by Er3+ (Fig. 6b). Moreover, UC emissions intensity of NaYF4:Er3+and NaYF4:Er3+/Nd3+ NPs can be modulated through co-doping of Yb3+ in these NPs (Fig. 6b). Similarly, Er3+ can also transfer the excitation energy to Eu3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+, respectively.

In the meantime, Zhang et al. designed Er3+-sensitized UC nanostructures with both the excitation and emission wavelengths located in the NIR-II region.68 Under the excitation of 1530 nm, UC emission of Ho3+ at 1180 nm in NaErF4:Ho3+@NaYF4 NPs was obtained through energy transfer from Er3+ to Ho3+. Later on, Tm3+-sensitized NaYF4:Tm3+/Er3+@NaYF4 UCNPs with excitation of 1208 nm and emission of 1525 nm were also proposed for in vivo information storage and decoding.69
3.3. Tuning emission wavelength
It is essential to tune the emission color of Ln3+-doped UCNPs for multiplex applications. The common strategies are controlling host materials and the concentration and components of dopants.29,61,80–82 Besides, several novel strategies were proposed including energy migration, interfacial energy transfer, orthogonal excitation–emission, and pulse width of excitation tuning.83–93
For alleviating the restrictions of UCL only in the ladder-like energy levels of activators such as Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+, we designed the NaGdF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@NaGdF4:Eu3+ core–shell NPs to produce the UC emission of Eu3+via energy migration by using the double sensitizers of Yb3+ and Tm3+.83 Inspired by this work, many efforts have been devoted to tuning multicolor emission of Ln3+-doped UCNPs.83–85,88,89 For example, Liu et al. realized multicolor tuning of Ln3+-doped UCNPs by the process of cation exchange between Ln3+ and activators (Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Sm3+, and Mn2+) (Fig. 7a–c).89 In the process of such EMU, it generally consists of sensitizers (Yb3+), accumulator (Tm3+), migrator (Gd3+), and activator (Fig. 7b). The sensitizers harvest the excitation energy and then transfer it to the accumulator for populating a higher energy level. Gd3+ can trap the energy from the accumulator and migrate to the activator, leading to the UCL emission. The emission color of NaGdF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@NaGdF4 UCNPs can be easily modulated from ultraviolet to red through the cation exchange of Gd3+ with Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Sm3+, and Mn2+, respectively (Fig. 7d). Based on this energy migration UC mechanism, Tsang and Zhou et al. also achieved multiple UC emissions of Eu3+ and Tb3+ in NaYbF4:Tm3+/Gd3+@NaYF4:Tb3+@NaYF4:Eu3+ NPs through the interfacial energy transfer process.91

Orthogonal excitation–emission UCL, which means that the UC emission color is modulated through different energy transfer pathways by changing the excitation wavelengths, is another efficient approach to tune the emission of Ln3+-doped UCNPs. For example, by combining the Yb3+-sensitized UCL with Nd3+-sensitized UCL or Er3+-sensitized UCL, orthogonal excitation–emission UCL can be obtained. As a typical example, Zhang and Zhou et al. designed the core-multishell NaErF4:Tm3+@NaYF4@NaYbF4:Tm3+@NaYF4 NPs (R-B-1) through a high-temperature co-precipitation method (Fig. 8a).92 Similarly, the core–shell NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+@NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@NaYF4@NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+@NaYF4 NPs (R-G-B) were also prepared (Fig. 8b). In these core–shell NPs, Yb3+, Er3+, and Nd3+ worked as sensitizers to harvest the 980, 808/1532, and 808 nm excitation energy while Tm3+ and Ho3+ ions acted as activators to generate blue/red and green/red UC emissions. As a result, multicolor emissions from blue to green and red in these core–shell NPs were realized by varying the excitation wavelengths and excitation power density (Fig. 8c).

Another way to manipulate the UC emission color is based on modulating the pulsed excitation. The process of exciting an electron from the ground state to the excited state often contains several energy transfer and nonradiative relaxation pathways, which can be regulated by adjusting the pulse width and frequency of the excitation irradiation. To exemplify this, Liu and Deng et al. demonstrated that, in NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+/Ce3+ NPs, the green emission was generated through a direct two-step energy transfer process from Yb3+, while the red emission was generated through the 5I6 → 5I7 relaxation to pump to the 5F5 level, which was populated at much lower rate than the green emission.87 Therefore, the green/red emissions can be tuned by modulating the pulse width of excitation at 980 nm. Accordingly, they designed a core–shell NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+@NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@NaYF4@NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+/Ce3+@NaYF4 nanostructure which combined Nd3+-sensitized UCL and Yb3+-sensitized UCL. Full-color tuning from red to green and blue was achieved by changing the excitation wavelengths and/or modulating the pulse width of excitation irradiation of 980 nm.
4. Energy transfer between lanthanide ions and organic dyes
The origin for low luminescence efficiency of Ln3+ lies in its 4f–4f intraconfiguration forbidden transitions. Specifically, Yb3+, Nd3+, and Er3+ ions have small absorption cross-sections of ∼10−20 cm2, ∼10−21 cm2, and ∼10−19 cm2, respectively. Such a small absorption cross-section results in the low absorption of excitation light and luminescence efficiency of Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Compared with Ln3+, organic dyes have a relatively large absorption cross-section (10−16–10−17 cm2). Therefore, organic dye-sensitized UCL has been proposed to improve the UC intensity by attaching dyes on the surface of UCNPs (Table 2). In this section, we will briefly overview the energy transfer between Ln3+ and organic dyes including excitation sensitization and emission sensitization of Ln3+ with organic dyes for enhancing luminescence intensity.

4.1. Excitation sensitization
One of the pioneering work regarding the introduction of dye sensitization to enhance the UCL of Ln3+ was reported by Zou et al. (Fig. 9a).94 They prepared dye-sensitized UCNPs by binding IR-806 dyes with NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs. The extinction coefficient of IR-806 dyes at 860 nm (390 l g−1 cm−1) is 5 × 105 times higher than that of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs at 975 nm (7 × 10−5 l g−1 cm−1). The overlap between the emission of dye and the absorption of UCNPs is in the range of 900–1000 nm (Fig. 9b). As such, dye molecules can act as an NIR antenna to sensitize NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs within the Förster model. Benefiting from the large absorption cross-section of NIR organic dyes, dye-sensitized UC emission was significantly enhanced by a factor of 3300 under 975 nm excitation (Fig. 9c). Subsequently, UC emission in dye-sensitized NPs were further improved by 8 times in core/active shell NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4 NPs relative to that in NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs as reported by Han et al.95

Although several dye-sensitized UCNPs were explored, there still exists energy mismatch between the emission of organic dyes and absorption of Yb3+-doped UCNPs. To improve the energy transfer efficiency between dyes and Ln3+, Nd3+-doped UCNPs with core–shell nanostructures were proposed.38,96–100 For example, Chen et al. developed the hybrid inorganic–organic system by combining NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@NaYF4:Nd3+ core–shell UCNPs and IR808 dyes.96 In their work, IR808 dyes absorbed the excitation energy of NIR light and then transferred the energy to the sensitizer Nd3+ in the shell through an organic/inorganic interface. The energy was then transferred to the bridge ions Yb3+ in the core through the core–shell interface. Finally, intense UC emission of Tm3+ was achieved via energy tranfer from Yb3+ to activators Tm3+. The dye-sensitized UCNPs with multistep energy cascade transfer resulted in an UCQY as high as 4.8%.
Besides designing the nanostructures of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, organic dyes can also be tailored for enhancing the UC emission of Ln3+.101–103 To this end, Han et al. compared a series of NIR dyes including IR783, IR808, IR820, and IR 845 with excitation wavelengths varying from 780 to 850 nm to sensitize NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs.101 The integrated luminescence intensity of dye-coated UCNPs was found to be 80, 200, 70, and 100 times higher than that of the bare NPs, corresponding to IR783, IR808, IR820, and IR845 dyes, respectively. In addition to the single dye sensitization, Kim et al. recently designed the multi-dye-sensitized UC to broaden the absorption window from the NIR to visible range (450–975 nm).103 As a result, the sequential energy transfer efficiency and UCL were markedly increased by optimizing the ratio and distance of organic dyes to UCNPs.
Although UCL was significantly enhanced when conjugating dyes with Ln3+-doped UCNPs, a general understanding of the energy transfer mechanism between dyes and Ln3+ remains unclear. Schuck et al. discovered that the increased content of Ln3+ can promote sensitizers of dyes from singlet to triplet through intersystem crossing (Fig. 10a).104 Subsequently, the triplet state transferred the energy to NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs (Fig. 10b). In this case, the energy transfer process consists of the electrostatic and exchange interaction, or either of them. Based on this proposed mechanism of dye-sensitized UC, they designed dye/UCNPs hybrids with UC emission intensity 33000 times higher than that of the bare UCNPs (Fig. 10c).

4.2. Emission sensitization
Besides excitation sensitization, the emission of Ln3+-doped UCNPs can also be sensitized via energy transfer from Ln3+ to dye molecules.105 Generally, the UC emission of Ln3+ may be easily quenched in the UCNM/dye hybrids under NIR excitation owing to the energy transfer from UCNPs to dyes.4,28,106 However, Dionne et al. proposed the emission dye-sensitization strategy to enhance the UCL in Yb3+/Er3+-doped UCNPs (Fig. 11a and b).92 The dye ATTO 542 was chosen to decorate on the surface of Na(YGdLu)0.8F4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs owing to its spectral overlap with the green emission of Er3+ (Fig. 11c). Due to the efficient energy transfer from Er3+ to ATTO 542, the UCQY of ATTO 542 decorated with UCNPs was determined to be 2 times higher than that of the bare UCNPs (Fig. 11d–f). Moreover, they found that the lifetime of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition was reduced from 100 μs in the bare UCNPs to 80 μs in the dye-modified UCNPs, indicating that the improved UCL may be resulted from the increased radiative recombination rates.

5. Energy transfer between lanthanide ions and quantum dots
QDs have shown great promise in the fields of bioapplications, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells, owing to their outstanding optical properties such as high PLQYs, broad emission bands and size-dependent emissions.107–109 Through the self-assembly method, hybrids by combining UCNPs and QDs have been developed to realize wavelength tuning by controlling energy transfer from UCNPs to QDs.110–113 In this section, we will highlight the advances of energy transfer between Ln3+ and QDs with an emphasis on tuning multicolor emission and improving luminescence intensity.
5.1. Tuning multicolor emission
In Ln3+ doped NPs, UC emission tuning usually requires a tedious variation of the concentration and composition of dopants. However, multicolor emission can be easily achieved through the energy transfer from UCNPs to QDs.110–113 For example, Perepichka et al. prepared a CdSe-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ heterostructure through electrostatic attraction between amine-capped UCNPs and acid-capped QDs (Fig. 12a and b).111 The composites exhibited red emission at 634 nm under 390 nm excitation (Fig. 12c). Upon 980 nm excitation, the green UC emission at 524 and 542 nm from Er3+ in the composites significantly decreased and a new emission peak at 634 nm of CdSe was observed, proving the energy transfer from UCNPs to CdSe QDs (Fig. 12d and e). Consequently, the UC emission color changed from green to red (Fig. 12f).

There are inherent limitations on UC emission tuning in Ln3+-doped UCNPs owing to the defined energy levels of Ln3+. Compared with Ln3+-doped UCNPs, perovskite QDs (PeQDs) possess tunable emission bands through facile anion exchange.114–117 Therefore, broad UC emission tuning of Ln3+-doped UCNPs can be realized with PeQDs by bandgap tailoring (Fig. 13a). Recently, we proposed a convenient strategy to tune the UCL of LiYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@LiYF4 UCNPs with CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PeQDs (Fig. 13b).118 The luminescence mechanism was governed by the process of radiative energy transfer UC, which was verified by the concentration-dependent UCL in NP-sensitized PeQDs. By virtue of the high conversion efficiency from UCNPs to PeQDs, full-color emissions of UCNPs/PeQDs hybrid were achieved by tailoring the bandgap of PeQDs (Fig. 13c and d). Moreover, the UCL lifetime of NP-sensitized PeQDs can be modulated from nanoseconds to milliseconds, which was dependent on the UCL lifetime of NPs.

5.2. Improving luminescence intensity
The UCL of Ln3+ can be significantly enhanced by NIR dyes due to the large absorption cross-section of organic dyes. However, the applications of dye-sensitized UCNPs are limited by the low UCQY in aqueous solutions and the poor photostability of dyes. As a result, it is essential to discover novel approaches to improve the UCL of Ln3+ to facilitate the practical applications of UCNPs. Recently, Liu et al. utilized the Ag2Se QDs as a NIR antenna to enhance the UCL in Yb3+- and Nd3+-sensitized NPs (Fig. 14a).119 Ag2Se QDs were chosen as sensitizers because of their excitation at ∼808 nm and the large Stokes shift (hundreds of nanometers), which may favor the energy transfer between Ag2Se QDs and Yb3+ (or Nd3+). Three kinds of Ag2Se QDs with absorption peaks at 810, 850, and 870 nm (represented as Ag2Se-810, Ag2Se-850, and Ag2Se-870, respectively) were obtained by varying the precursor ratio of Ag/Se in the synthesis of Ag2Se. For Ag2Se-sensitized NaYF4:Yb3+/Gd3+/Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Gd3+/Tm3+ NPs, their UCL intensities were significantly improved by varying the concentration of Ag2Se QDs, indicating that Ag2Se QDs can work as feasible sensitizers to boost the UCL efficiency of UCNPs (Fig. 14b and c). Among the three kinds of Ag2Se QDs, Ag2Se-810 exhibited the best luminescence enhancement effect for Yb3+/Er3+- and Yb3+/Tm3+-doped UCNPs upon excitation at 808 nm. Furthermore, Ag2Se-810 QDs were also encapsulated on the surface of Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs like NaYF4:Yb3+/Gd3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+. To improve the energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+, the Yb3+ concentration in the shell was optimized to be 7.5 mol% (Fig. 14d). After encapsulating Ag2Se-810 QDs, the UCL of NaYF4:Yb3+/Gd3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+ NPs was enhanced by a factor of 18 with a Ag2Se/UCNPs mass ratio of 2.4 (Fig. 14e).

(Reprinted with permission from ref. 119. Copyright 2019, American Chemical Society.) 
In addition to enhancing the visible UC emission of Ln3+, QDs can also improve the NIR UC emission of Ln3+-doped UCNPs.120,121 For instance, Zhang et al. prepared NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+-CdS heterostructures through the strategy of epitaxial growth.120 Upon excitation at 980 nm, the NIR emission of Tm3+ at 802 nm in the NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+-CdS heterostructures was 7.3 times higher than that of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ NPs due to the efficient energy back transfer from CdS to UCNPs.
6. Conclusions and perspectives
Significant progress has been made in energy transfer design of Ln3+-doped UCNPs to tackle the current existing challenges. These designed UCNPs with superior optical properties open up a new avenue for their applications in deep tissue imaging, optical encoding, high-level anti-counterfeiting, and three dimensional displays. Despite these fantastic studies, there are still several significant hurdles that must be overcome in order to meet the demands of practical applications in different fields.
For energy transfer designing in Ln3+–Ln3+, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient energy transfer pathways other than pure Ln3+–Ln3+ interactions in the UCNPs. For this purpose, introducing transition metal ions like Mn2+ and Cr3+ may generate unique energy transfer pathways in Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Meanwhile, the co-doping of transition metal ions may also affect the nucleation and growth of Ln3+-doped UCNPs so as to modulate their crystallographic phase and the distance between Ln3+ emitters. As such, the UC emission of Ln3+ can be tuned because the optical properties of Ln3+ ions are critically dependent on their local structure.
For organic dye sensitized UCNPs, the excitation dynamics between organic dyes and UCNPs are still not fully understood so far, therefore a more detailed fundamental investigation of energy transfer mechanisms in the dye-modified UCNPs is urgently needed by utilizing the temperature-dependent spectra, time-resolved spectra, transient absorption spectra, etc. In addition, the excitation wavelength of dye-sensitized UCNPs is mostly restricted in the range of ∼800 nm owing to the limitations in the preparation of efficient NIR organic dyes. It is essential to extend their excitation wavelength to the NIR-II region, which might be extremely suitable for deep tissue biosensing.
For energy transfer designing between Ln3+ and QDs, it is well known that PeQDs exhibit several intriguing properties; thus the composites between UCNPs and PeQDs for improving optical performance of Ln3+ receive considerable attention. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to prepare heterostructures composed of UCNPs and PeQDs because of their large lattice mismatch and different nucleation/growth rates. Therefore, some novel strategies such as cation exchange and surface-ligand interaction should be adopted for promoting the formation of UCNP/PeQD heterostructures.
Last but not least, with the development of nanotechnology, more and more novel luminescent nanomaterials have emerged including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon dots and graphene, which may endow Ln3+-doped UCNPs with unexpected and unprecedented optical properties through rational energy transfer designing. Once fundamental questions concerning the controlled synthesis and luminescence mechanism have been unlocked, there is plenty of room for exploring and implementing Ln3+-doped UCNPs for future commercial applications.
