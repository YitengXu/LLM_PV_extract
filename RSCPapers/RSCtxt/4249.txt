1. Introduction
The combination of fullerenes and porphyrins constitutes even after years of intense investigations an interesting and challenging topic. Especially interactions initiated by photoexcitation of non-covalently associated and covalently linked electron donor–acceptor systems are at center of interdisciplinary attention.1 Often used in models for multistep electron transfer, fullerenes, on one hand, and porphyrins, on the other hand, assist in a comprehensive understanding of electron donor–acceptor interactions and, in turn, in paving the transformation towards artificial photosynthesis.2,3 Considering today's call for alternative, renewable energy sources, efficient energy conversion and storage units are of great relevance.
It is fair to say that fullerenes, which were discovered more than three decades ago, are the foundation for the field of low dimensional carbon allotropes and carbon nanotechnology.4 Fullerenes are, however, far more than just C60 and, at least theoretically, all C20+2F with F ≠ 1 and F ≥ 0 are feasible. Well-known examples of fullerenes include, for example, C60, C70, C76, C82, and C84. The most remarkable properties of C60 are, for instance, good thermal and pressure stabilities combined with high chemical reactivity. In addition, C60 is a strong electron acceptor in the ground state, which becomes even stronger in the excited state, and, which enables delocalization and accumulation of electrons.5,6
Soon after the full potential of C60 in electron transfer reactions was realized, electron donating porphyrins were explored. Not only that their 18 π-electron aromatic structure results in high extinction coefficients across the visible range of the solar spectrum,7 but also their excited states are high in energy. In essence, porphyrins are the ideal light harvester and electron donor and, in turn, are the ideal complement to electron accepting fullerenes.
This review comprises a number of different strategies to integrate fullerenes and porphyrins into solution-based electron donor–acceptor hybrids and conjugates as well as solid state-based crystalline and co-crystalline systems. An exclusive focus on porphyrins rather than on alternative light harvesters enables drawing a comparison in terms of similarities and differences between molecular systems, crystalline particulate systems as well as bulk systems.8 We will discuss mechanistic aspects associated with the photoexcitation of porphyrins, namely light harvesting, energy transfer (EnT), charge separation (CS), charge shift (CSH), charge transport, charge recombination (CR), etc. All of the aforementioned have a profound impact on understanding and optimizing photovoltaics, in which electron accepting fullerenes play a decisive role.
2. Charge transfer
Cutting-edge research on the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center has fostered a comprehensive understanding of electron transfer processes.9,10 One of the key parameters that assists in regulating electron transfer is the reorganization energy. The total reorganization energy (λ) describes the energy required to rearrange the electron donor and the electron acceptor as well as their solvation spheres upon electron transfer. λ is a composite term and consists of a solvational (λs) and a vibrational (λv) term.11–13En-route towards the realization of ultrafast charge separation in combination with slow charge recombination (Fig. 1), molecular building blocks, which feature small reorganization energies of electron transfer, are helpful. For example, selecting a rigid molecular building block like C60 results in low λv. Delocalization of electrons in C60, on the contrary, minimizes λs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the processes taking place upon photoexcitation in donor–bridge–acceptor (D–A) systems. 
Not surprisingly, such intrinsic electron transfer features of C60 in combination with the remarkable redox characteristics, render fullerenes, in general, and C60, in particular, perfect electron acceptors for highly efficient, long lasting charge transfer processes.
The total reorganization energy is at the heart of the Marcus theory on electron transfer reactions. In brief, the Marcus theory treats the dependence of the electron transfer rate (kET) on the free energy changes () of the electron transfer reaction as a parabola (Fig. 2).11–13 In the resulting Marcus parabola, three regions are identified. First, in the normal region, where the electron transfer is weakly exergonic, the theory predicts an increase in the rate constant with increasing thermodynamic driving force (). Second, at the top of the parabola, the driving force matches the reorganization energy (). In this activation-less region, the rate constant is at its maximum and it is mostly governed by the magnitude of the electronic coupling (V) element between the electron donor and acceptor. Third, in the highly exergonic region, which starts upon going beyond the maximum, the rate constant starts to decrease with increasing driving force (). Responsible for this trend is a poor vibrational overlap between the wave functions of the product and the reactant. It is often referred to as the inverted region.
 Fig. 2  Marcus plot of log(kET) as a function of free energy changes for electron transfer reactions. 
Efficient and long lasting electron transfer processes require forward electron transfer (FET)/charge separation (CS) kinetics close to the top of the Marcus curve and back electron transfer (BET)/charge recombination (CR) kinetics deep in the inverted region. To this end, molecular building blocks with small λ-values power faster CS and slower CR than those with large λ-values. In line with the aforementioned, λv of C60 as small as 0.06 eV prompts to its full potential in electron donor–acceptor systems.14,15
3. Interfacing fullerenes and porphyrins in covalently linked electron donor–acceptor conjugates
To optimize charge separation, charge transport, and charge collection in, for example, organic photovoltaics (OPV) or organic field effect transistors (OFET), requires a profound understanding of the interfacial processes. Considering, however, the complexity of interfaces, simpler model systems are needed. This is where electron donor–acceptor systems based on electron donating metalloporphyrins and electron accepting fullerenes as p- and n-type materials, respectively, emerged as a great asset.
Covalently linking metalloporphyrins and fullerenes assists in eliminating diffusion as the rate limiting step in electron transfer processes. The first of such examples were reported by Gust et al. and Imahori et al.16,17 employing either bicyclic and amide linkers. A closer look at the charge-separated state reveals a significant stabilization. The synthesis of a plethora of metalloporphyrin- and fullerene-based electron donor–acceptor conjugates followed in the next few years.
Another milestone within the context of exploring the full potential of C60 was the work in 199618 and later on in 2002.19 To illustrate the impact, which the nature of the electron acceptor has on electron transfer processes, the work focused on conjugates of metalloporphyrins with either C60 or benzoquinone as electron acceptor. Substantial differences in the reduction strength of C60 and benzoquinone hampered, however, conclusive interpretations. A better match was realized when using naphthalenediimide and comparing it to C60. Comparable reduction potentials of the electron acceptors, electron donor–acceptor distances, and electronic couplings all result in similar . As such, any notable kinetic difference must correlate with the diverse reorganization energies of the electron acceptors. In fact, a λ value obtained for the C60 conjugate of 0.59 eV is significantly smaller than the one for the naphthalenediimide conjugate with 1.41 eV. As such, the latter study has corroborated the superior properties of C60 as a 3-dimensional electron acceptor.
The efficiency of charge collection in OPVs is tied to a rapid separation of charges and a slow recombination (vide infra). Spatial separation of charges is, for example, a promising means to suppress their recombination. Larger separation correlates, however, with weaker electronic coupling and, in turn, with a slower electron transfer – too slow in some cases to compete with alternate deactivation pathways. On the basis of a superexchange mechanism, long-range electron transfer processes are limited to distances of about 20 Å.20 Research on electron donor–acceptor interactions have documented that cascades of short distance electron transfer steps along well designed redox gradients are promising to circumvent the aforementioned limitations.99 Leading examples are the combination of several redox active building blocks: ferrocene (Fc), free base porphyrin (H2P), zinc porphyrin (ZnP), and C60 in the form of linear-shaped Fc–ZnP–H2P–C60 (1) and Fc–ZnP–ZnP–C60 (2) conjugates (Fig. 3). Notably, the final electron donor and the primary electron acceptor, that is, Fc and C60 respectively, are separated by distances of nearly 50 Å.21 By means of light harvesting by the two porphyrins and energy transfer between them, a cascade of multistep electron transfer, that is, charge separation and charge shift, is the inception of reducing C60 and oxidizing Fc.
 Fig. 3  Structures of Fc–ZnP–H2P–C6021 (1) and Fc–ZnP–ZnP–C6022 (2). In 1, the following reaction cascade follows photoexcitation: Fc–1*ZnP–H2P–C60 (excitation) → Fc–ZnP–1*H2P–C60 (EnT) → Fc–ZnP–H2P˙+–C60˙− (CS) → Fc–ZnP˙+–H2P–C60˙− (CSH1) → Fc˙+–ZnP–H2P–C60˙− (CSH2) → Fc–ZnP–H2P–C60 (CR). 
As a matter of fact, the lifetimes of the underlying charge-separated state is as long as 0.38 s.21 Even longer lifetimes of up to 1.6 s, were realized upon placing two ZnPs rather than one H2P and one ZnP.22 But it is not only the lifetime, which reveals differences, also the quantum yields of the long lasting charge-separated state increased to 34%. Responsible for the latter effect is a larger  value for the initial electron transfer involving C60.
An interesting case of a multistep electron transfer is charge-shifting in rigid, antenna like (ZnP)3–H2P arrays covalently linked to C60 (Fig. 4).23 A particularly strong influence of the solvent polarity on the pathway of excited-state deactivation in (ZnP)3–H2P–C60 (3) conjugate was noted. Involvement of the ZnPs in a charge-shift besides the charge separation between H2P and C60 is controlled by the solvent polarity: it is disabled in nonpolar environments and enabled in polar environments. The consequences are charge-separated state lifetimes of either a few nanoseconds or a few hundreds of nanoseconds spanning across H2P and C60 or ZnP and C60, respectively. Even more interesting is the charge transfer analysis and the structure comparison. Two of the peripheral ZnPs are in cis-position relative to C60 at a distance of 1 nm and interact through space within 5–8 ns. The third peripheral ZnP is at a 3 nm distance from C60 in trans-position, which governs through-bond interactions in 140–160 ns.
 Fig. 4  Structure of (ZnP)3–H2P–C60 (3).23 In 3, the following reaction cascade follows photoexcitation: 1**(ZnP)3–H2P–C60 (excitation) → 1*(ZnP)3–H2P–C60 (interconversion) → (ZnP)3–1*(H2P)–C60 (EnT) → (ZnP)3–H2P˙+–C60˙− (CS) → (ZnP)3–H2P–3*C60 (CR) → (ZnP)3–3*H2P–C60 (EnT) → (ZnP)3–H2P–C60 (ground state recovery). 
Incoherent electron transfer has also been noted when oligo-para-phenylenevinylene 4 (oPPV),24 oligo-fluorene 5 (oFl),25etc. were used to link ZnP and C60 (Fig. 5). Striking is the impact that oFl modification exerts on the electron transfer mechanism. Substitution of the central fluorene unit with dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide 6 leads to unidirectional transfer of holes, but not of electrons in contrast to transfer of holes and electrons in oFls.26 In other words, subtle structural changes of oFls result in notable mechanistic alternations.

4. Tuning interfacial interactions in covalently linked electron donor–acceptor conjugates
To rationalize and to fine-tune interfacial interactions between (metallo)porphyrins and fullerenes, their mutual orientation and their relative distance should be taken into consideration. To this end, three different types of face-to-face arrangements have been elegantly designed and studied (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Examples of different types of face-to-face porphyrin–fullerene arrangements.31 
Two types of π–π stack-type electron donor–acceptor conjugates based on a trans-2 bis-adduct27,28 (Fig. 7) as well as trans-1 bis-adduct29 configuration were developed independently. Short intramolecular separations of 3 Å assures in 7 the presence of charge transfer interactions in the ground state. Importantly, in apolar solvents like toluene, the formation of the C60 triplet excited state has been noted as the result of the charge-recombination. This is in stark contrast to polar solvents, where the direct regeneration of the ground state takes place. Notably, changing the solvent polarity from apolar toluene to polar benzonitrile correlates with shorter charge-separated state lifetimes from 619 to 38 ps. This suggests that the rates of the back electron transfer processes are placed in the Marcus inverted region.
 Fig. 7  Structures of trans-2 and equatorial ZnP–C60727,28 and 8.15 
Similar trends were observed in case of a parachute-type electron donor–acceptor conjugate.30 In particular, slower charge-recombination dynamics were noted at larger  values. Slightly weaker π–π interactions than in the π–π stack-type electron donor–acceptor conjugates facilitate longer-lived charge-separated states due to a better solvent stabilization. As a matter of fact, the lifetime is 69 ps in polar benzonitrile.
In an attempt to discern effects related to the geometrical arrangement of electron donor and acceptor, trans-2 bis-adduct 7 has been compared with the equatorial bis-adduct 8 (Fig. 7).15 Strongly altered π–π interactions were the induction to significant changes. On one hand, the different positioning of the linkers stemming from the trans-2 and equatorial addition pattern leads to either face-to-face or face-to-edge alignment for 7 in the earlier and 8 in the latter. The changes in spatial overlap are reflected in electronic couplings of 10 and 313 cm−1 for 8 and 7, respectively. On the other hand, the face-to-edge geometry in 8 renders electron donor and acceptor accessible. This ensures a much better solvent stabilization of the charge-separated state with a lifetime of 1.1 μs in benzonitrile relative to the 38 ps in 7, where most of the porphyrin surface is covered by the fullerene.
Another case of close proximity between (metallo)porphyrins and fullerenes is given in a Pacman-type face-to-face geometry (Fig. 8).31 Owing to the nature of the linker, 9 is structurally more rigid than 7 or 8 and leads to a fairly strong coupling of 140 cm−1. 9 features 430 ps lived charge-separated state in apolar solvents like toluene, while in benzonitrile the lifetime is decreased to 19 ps. Again, the dynamics of the back electron transfer processes are located in the Marcus inverted region. A λ value of 0.94 eV, which is extraordinarly high, is a result of interaction between closely located oxidized (metallo)porphyrin and reduced C60. It is also in line with the postulated existence of charge-transfer interactions as it was observed in ground state assays, especially in polar solvents.

5. Controlling and tuning interfacial self-assembly in solution
A considerable number of the abovementioned electron donor–acceptor conjugates includes examples of π–π interactions. Those along with hydrogen bonding, complementary electrostatics, and metal coordination emerge from biomimetic organization principles and constitute the foundation of modern supramolecular self-assemblies. An inclusion complex of C60 and a cyclic dimer of a (metallo)porphyrin is one of the unique examples of π-electronic donor–acceptor interactions. Acyclic porphyrin dimers show a low affinity towards fullerenes.32 However, once a cyclic geometry is adopted like in 11 (Fig. 10), a binding constant as high as 6.7 × 105 M−1 was realized.33,34 The overall complexation has been visualized by bathochromic shifts in the absorption spectrum, as well as the presence of a broad charge-transfer absorption band at 750–850 nm. Notably, the flexibility in the linkers of the porphyrin dimer plays a major role. Using the synthetic precursor with rigid diacetylenic linkers, no signs of complexation have been noted.
Likewise, hydrogen bonds are a powerful tool to construct functional, self-assembled associates. Of great importance is multiple-hydrogen bonding as it transcended into a promising approach to construct stable complexes. To this end, the Hamilton-receptor based hydrogen binding motif 10 (Fig. 9) has been introduced in work in the late 1990s in solution and later on in dye-sensitized solar cells.35,36 The composition of a cyanuric acid terminus and the malonate addend provided strong and highly directional association with binding constants that range in apolar solvents between 103 and 106 M−1. The use of the Hamilton receptor in combination with a cyanuric acid motif is at times cumbersome due to its poor solubility. This hurdle has been overcome by means of a variety of dendritic termini at the second malonate branch of C60.
 Fig. 9  Schematic representation of the hydrogen bonding motif of a cyanuric acid derivative and a Hamilton receptor.35 

En-route towards strengthening the binding between (metallo)porphyrin and C60, the combination of different supramolecular binding motifs, so called cooperative binding, was applied. To this end, the hybrid 12 of the guanidinium bis-ZnP tweezers and C60 derivative has been investigated (Fig. 10).37 The practice of merging π–π interactions and hydrogen bonds appears to be a viable strategy as it resulted in exceptionally high binding constant of 106 M−1. Importantly, the excitation of the hybrid generates a nanosecond-lived charge-separated state.
 Fig. 10  Structures of self-assembled ZnP–C601133 and 12.37 
Metal–ligand coordination constitutes another promising approach for obtaining electron-donor–acceptor associates. The first demonstration of this type of system was shown in the form of a complex formed by a (metallo)porphyrin and a C60 derivative.38–40 Monitoring the red-shifted transitions of Q-bands upon ligand coordination, the binding constant of approximately 5 × 103 M−1 has been obtained for 13 (Fig. 11).38 Notably, the complexation of a C60–pyridine derivative to ZnP is reversible, which leads to very efficient electron transfer upon irradiation. Owing to the mixture of intra- and intermolecular electron transfer processes, the charge-separated state has a lifetime of about 10 μs in THF and several hundreds of microseconds in benzonitrile.
 Fig. 11  Structures of self-assembled ZnP–C601338 and 14.41 
Taking the aforementioned another step further, a two-point metal–ligand axial coordination was investigated.41 To this end, a host featuring BF2-chelated azadipyrromethene (azaBODIPY) covalently linked to two porphyrins has been synthesized. The guest was a C60 derivative with two pyridines. The combination of the two 14 (Fig. 11) results in a binding constant as high as 1.85 × 105 M−1. In the absence of the C60 derivative, an energy transfer dominates the excited state interactions between the constituents. In the presence of the C60 derivative, an electron transfer is activated between the closely placed porphyrins and C60. As such, control over electron transfer instead of energy transfer has been demonstrated.
6. Controlling and tuning interfacial self-assembly in co-crystallites
(Metallo)porphyrins and fullerenes not only interact in the liquid phase to yield molecular complexes, but also in the solid state, where they form complexes of particulates. A first realization were fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin hexagonal nanorods.42 To this end, zinc meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (ZnP(Py)4) 15 (Fig. 12) and C60 were first mixed in DMF and then injected into a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) acetonitrile solution. Initially, ZnP(Py)4 flake structures were noted, which after several minutes transformed into nanorods consisting of hexagonal ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes filled with C60 (Fig. 13). In a reference, that is, ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes lacking C60, significant differences in the length, but not in the diameter were found. Overall, the anisotropic crystal growth is governed by π–π interactions between C60 and the ZnP(Py)4 nanosheets resulting in assemblies, which were twice the length seen for the reference ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes. Fluorescence quenching was rationalized by an electron transfer evolving from photoexcited ZnP(Py)4 to C60 and confirmed by transient absorption measurements. In terms of lifetime of the charge transfer a value of about 100 ns was derived. A photoelectrochemical cell was built to explore the solar energy conversion. As a result, the hexagonal ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes filled with C60 showed a broader photoresponse as well as higher incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) compared to reference systems.
 Fig. 12  Structures of zinc meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin 15 and C60 derivatives C60Ph 16 and C60tBu 17. 
 Fig. 13  Scheme of porphyrin and fullerene nanorods. (C60)n as well as (C70)n lead to hexagonal columns whereas (C60Ph)n as well as (C60tBu)n lead to distorted polygonal columns. 
In follow-up studies, nanorods of 15 and different fullerenes, namely C60, several different C60 derivatives or C70, were prepared and characterized.43 Characterizations ranged from DLS, over XRD, TEM, and SEM to steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic assays. Importantly, the size of the fullerene determines the diameter of the spontaneously formed nanorods in the range from 15 to 80 nm. Considering that for C60 derivatives 16 and 17 the largest diameters were found, led to the conclusion that the porphyrin nanosheet organization is hampered by the size of 16 and 17 (Fig. 12). Distorted polygonal columns rather than hexagonal nanorods are the consequence of the crystallization conditions. Transient absorption measurements helped to corroborate that an electron transfer evolves from the porphyrin to the fullerene. The corresponding charge transfer products have lifetimes of around 100 ns for the hexagonal and around 200 ns for the polygonal form. In summary, the lifetime strongly depends on the size of the nanorods, which is an important finding for further studies with regard to light energy conversion systems.
To gain control with respect to size and structure, the synthesis of so called co-crystals was conducted. Reports on co-crystals made of fullerenes or endohedral fullerenes, on one hand, and (metallo)porphyrins, on the other hand, have been numerous with a particular focus on the crystal structure etc.44–47 In stark contrast, studies regarding electron transfer interactions in co-crystals of fullerenes and porphyrins are rare, especially regarding uniform co-crystals.48 In one of the rare examples, the liquid–liquid interface precipitation method (LLIP) was used to produce co-crystals of (metallo)porphyrins and C70.49 Several parameters like the molar ratio between the two components and the antisolvent were varied to fine-tune morphology and structure, but similar morphologies with a parallelogram-like shape and angles of about 57° were corroborated.48 Molecular packing as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction revealed a triclinic structure with an overall ratio of 1:1. The results from absorption and fluorescence measurements as well as transient absorption measurements were rationalized by a ground state charge transfer that transitions in the excited state into electron transfer evolving from photoexcited (metallo)porphyrins to C70. The unique geometry within the nanosheets, namely face-to-face as well as face-to-edge arrangements (Fig. 14) have been taken into account to attribute the lifetimes of the charge separated state. In particular, values of 9.72 ± 3.50 and 173 ± 60.7 ps were related to the face-to-face arranged (metallo)porphyrins and C70 and those that are face-to-edge arranged, respectively.
 Fig. 14  Scheme of the triclinic crystal packing within C70–porphyrin nanosheets (left) and schematic illustration showing two different charge recombinations resulting from two possible radical ion pair states (right).48 
Concerning C60 and Co-porphyrin 1:1 co-crystals for deriving charge transport properties, LLIP was used to prepare nanosheets of tetragonal morphology with lateral sizes of 5–10 μm and thicknesses of 50–200 nm.50 Newly fabricated field effect transistors showed an interesting behavior: the transfer characteristics showed a V-shape curve indicating electron transport as well as hole transport and as such n- and p-type field effect transistors, respectively. In other words, this system exhibits ambipolar transport characteristics and renders such nanostructures as very promising for nanoscale devices.50
7. Interfacial solid-state interactions
Charge transfer between electron accepting fullerenes and electron donors such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, polymers, etc. are not limited to solution or co-crystallite assemblies. They also prevail in the solid-state. Heterojunctions and diodes are leading examples.1,51–53 In the area of organic photovoltaics (OPV), heterojunctions are exemplary for exploiting the photovoltaic effect.54 Following its discovery in 1839, it took more than a century until it was used in solid-state devices.55
The working principle of OPVs is based on the absorption of a photon throughout the photoactive layer. Hereby, an electron is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). As a result, an exciton is formed. For an efficient photovoltaic device, exciton diffusion towards the respective electrodes must be faster than recombination charges.100 Considering large exciton binding energies in the range from 0.2 to 1.4 eV,56–59 free charge carriers are not directly created in the photoactive layer.60 Electronic wave functions in organic semiconductors are more localized than in inorganic semiconductors and, as a consequence, strong electrostatic interactions lead to Frenkel-like excitons, which is described as a neutral excited state.61,62 Efficient charge separation is only achieved when, for example, a built-in electrical field is operative: asymmetrical work functions between anodes and cathodes (Fig. 15).53,63
 Fig. 15  Device architecture of conventional OPV (left) and the schematic view of the energy level alignment (right). 
Currently, the typical OPV architecture consists of a photoactive layer sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS as a p-type anode contact layer on top of ITO and Al as a low-work function metal cathode.64 In addition, LiF is added as an interlayer to improve the electrode contact and, as a result, decrease the contact resistance.65 In the resulting ITO|PEDOT:PSS|photoactive layer|Ca (or LiF)|Al, the fill factors (FF) are improved and the open-circuit voltages (VOC) are stabilized.66,67 Nowadays, top efficiencies of >12% are reported for tandem OPVs (vide infra).68
Early OPVs featured only poor device performances. Responsible were high electrical resistance, low control over the layer assembly, and negligible internal quantum efficiencies. To this end, Tang developed a device with an electron donor combined with a suitable electron acceptor to assure fast exciton diffusion to the electrodes. OPVs, which consisted of a 30 nm thick copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) layer and a 50 nm thick perylene tetracarboxylic derivative, gave rise to device efficiencies of 1%.69
Efficient exciton diffusion is crucial for a high photovoltaic performance. To ensure exciton dissociation, an electron acceptor with high electron affinity, matching work function, and good electron mobility is necessary.53,70 Ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer from organic semiconductors to C60 has fueled research towards highly efficient OPVs.8,71,72 Sariciftci et al. were first to report on photoinduced charge transfer from poly(phenylene-vinylene) (MEH-PPV) to C60.52 A C60-based layer on top of MEH-PPV results in a rectifying current–voltage curve and, in turn, photocurrents were enhanced more than 20 fold. Thin layers of C60 are fairly transparent and exhibit a good electron conductance of ∼10−4 S cm−1.53 As a matter of fact, an average exciton diffusion length of 6–8 nm was determined across the PPV|C60 interface.73 Thus, the exciton should be formed in close proximity to the electrodes.53,74 This would limit effective light-harvesting, as most organic semiconductors absorb light at thicknesses of ∼100 nm.75,76 A possible way to circumvent such a bottleneck is blending electron donor and acceptor into a single layer.71,77 If, in the resulting bulk heterojunction, the electron donor–acceptor structure is well-defined and leads to efficient exciton dissociation, the short-circuit photocurrent densities (JSC) should be improved when compared to a single-layer structure. Two extreme cases should be considered. On one hand, an intermixed electron donor–acceptor layer will exhibit high exciton dissociation yields due to a large interfacial area, but charge transport will be rather poor due to limited pathways for charge percolation. On the other hand, a complete phase separation will be the basis for high charge collection efficiencies, but exciton diffusion will be limited (vide supra).78 To find the threshold on the nanoscale control is an ongoing challenge in the field of organic semiconductors.
Early milestones towards efficient OPVs included the use of PPV or PPV derivatives combined with C60.52,73,77 From transient photoluminescence measurements a photoinduced electron transfer to C60 within the time resolution of the experiment of 60 ps was derived. The real value is, however, on the subpicosecond timescale.79 Light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) measurements corroborated that electron transfer takes place between the polymer and C60.80 Two well separated signals at g values of 2.0025 and 1.9955 were assigned to positive polarons on the polymer and the reduced C60, respectively. Similar results regarding photoinduced electron transfer were reported for poly(3-alkylthiophene) and C60.81,82 For the basic MEH-PPV:C60 p–n junction the efficiencies were modest with 0.02%. Upon improving the device preparation and the architecture external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of up to 5–7% were realized.83 In MEH-PPV:C60 OPVs, the maximum photoactive layer thickness is limited. Even at low C60 concentrations, photoluminescence quenching and, in turn, electron transfer upon photoexcitation is highly efficient. As such, the true bottleneck in C60-based photovoltaics is the charge transport. In other words, the concentrations of electron acceptor and donor should ensure charge percolation channels to the respective electrodes.
C60 tends to crystallize during film formation. Thus, functionalized C60 derivatives with high solubility and good film forming properties were at the forefront of investigations.8,75,76 To this end, Hummelen et al. functionalized C60 with a phenyl and butyric acid methyl ester-containing side group (PCBM).84 Films with up to 80 wt% of PCBM were generated, which accounts for roughly one C60 per polymer unit.71 As a consequence of the better charge transport, EQEs and VOC of up to 45% and 0.81 V were reached, respectively. When choosing chlorobenzene rather than toluene as solvent to prepare PCBM-based films, phase separation is prevented and polymer chain packing is enhanced.72,85 As such, the formation of isolated regions of polymer and PCBM is suppressed and, in turn, the hole mobility in the polymer is increased.70,86 Maximum efficiencies of 2.5% for PPV:PCBM-based photovoltaic cells were reported.
A more recent milestone was the use of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) rather than PPV as the photoactive polymer. P3HT incentives are high mobility, good solubility, unique film forming properties, and a rather low bandgap.87,88 A drawback is the charge recombination between P3HT and C60 in the composite. In turn, best performing devices consist of higher weight ratios of PCBM than P3HT.88,89 Maximum EQEs of 76% and JSC of 8.7 mA cm−2 underline a better light-harvesting properties of P3HT compared to PPV. Based on a VOC of 0.58 V and FF of 0.55 a device efficiency of 2.8% is comparable to PPV-based OPVs. Optimization of the nanoscale morphology and the crystallinity from a post-production annealing process boosted the efficiencies to ∼5%.90
Further improvement of the efficiencies was based on an energy level alignment of electron acceptor and donor. On one hand, rising the LUMO level of the acceptor results in higher VOC. P3HT:PCBM features VOC typically around 0.6 V, which is, however, much smaller than the P3HT band gap of ∼1.9 eV due to a rather large LUMO–LUMO offset. On the other hand, by using C60 bisadducts, the VOC increased to 0.73 V.91 The band gap of P3HT, which is ∼1.9 eV, limits the light-harvesting.92 Decreasing the band gap hence increases the spectral overlap of the polymer absorption with the solar spectrum, but will at one point decrease the photovoltage.92 As a compromise, an optimum band gap should be around 1.4 eV, which is also known as the Shockley–Queisser limit.93
Lowering the band gap of the polymer represents an excellent choice for tandem or ternary organic solar cells.94,95 The electron transfer in ternary blends thereby depends on (i) the polymer content, (ii) the electronic energy levels and band gap of all components, (iii) the polymer location in the binary photoactive layer, and (iv) the microstructure of the film.95 Given the high crystallinity and good charge-transport properties P3HT is an archetypal material for ternary blends in combination with polymers absorbing in the near IR region.78,95 A judicious choice of the polymer is necessary to ensure good crystallinity of the ternary blend. For example, higher photocurrents but lower FF were reported for a ternary blend of P3HT:PCBM:C-PCPDTBT.96 This was ascribed to poorer electron transport, since the crystallinity was reduced upon increasing the C-PCPDTBT concentration. In contrast, the presence of Si-PCPDTBT and P3HT even at high weight ratios resulted in a better crystalline arrangement and, in turn, improved electron transport. As such, the efficiencies of the ternary solar cells were enhanced by 25% compared to binary OPVs.96,97
Semiconductor doping can be applied to enhance the electrical conductivity of the interfacial layer and adjust the energy levels to achieve ohmic contacts at the electrode|photoactive layer interface.76 For small molecule-based OPVs, controlled doping of interfacial layers by co-deposition of dopants and small molecules generally is used to create p–i–n junctions.76,98 As an outstanding example of three-layered p–i–n OPVs, Matsuo et al. used a silyl-modified C60 (SIMEF) and a tetrabenzoporphyrin to produce OPVs with a defined interdigitated structure.51 Since tetrabenzoporphyrins are virtually insoluble in organic solvents, a precursor was spin coated and thermally converted to form the donor p-layer. A binary mixture of SIMEF and the precursor is subsequently spin coated on top to form the interdigitated i-layer. Finally, the p–i–n structure is formed after spin coating a SIMEF solution on the i-layer. Efficiencies of 5.2% were achieved, which are among the best reported for solution-processed small molecule OPVs.
Eventually, the interfacial interactions between electron donor and acceptor play a major role in the development of highly efficient OPVs. Future directions will concentrate on gathering a comprehensive understanding on the working principle and the optimization of materials, which will pave the way to highly efficient and long-term stable solar cells.
8. Conclusions
Over two and half decades of extensive fullerene research have brought a wealth of information regarding (interfacial) electron transfer chemistry. It has found its way into numerous areas of basic science, where (metallo)porphyrins have turned into a key player. But, it goes well beyond basic science, as such knowledge paves the road for emerging and future technological development. Only through the profound understanding of (interfacial) interactions between electron donating (metallo)porphyrins and electron accepting fullerenes more profitable designs of organic photovoltaics featuring organic semiconductors rather than (metallo)porphyrins have been enabled. Despite the immense body of work, which has been performed to investigate fullerenes, we believe that there is still ‘plenty of room’ for even further improvements.
