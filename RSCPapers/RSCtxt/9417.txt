    , Accepted 19th September 2018First published on 20th September 2018AbstractWe report a step-saving new access to D–π–D–π–D type oligoaryls through one-pot sequential C–H (hetero)arylations. Conventionally, these oligomers were prepared by Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions that required prefunctionalization steps. The facilely synthesized linear oligomers were fabricated in perovskite-based solar devices as efficient hole transporters, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of up to 15.4%.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are becoming the rising star in energy materials because they have been shown to exhibit promising power conversion efficiencies (PCE) based on a cost-effective light-harvesting layer in devices.1 Articles reviewing PSC-related topics from different points of view have sprung up for the past few years.2–8 Among different components/layers in a PSC device, the hole-transporting material (HTM) occupies a particularly important place since the selection of HTM molecules may lead to the eventual performance and stability of the solar cells.9 Focusing on the broad applicable small-molecule type HTMs, it must be noted that 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) is the most used electron-rich moiety that has been often introduced to π-conjugated systems.10 As shown in recent examples, Su11 and Qiao12 reported efficient PSCs utilizing a linear D–π–EDOT–π–D molecule as a hole-transporter (PCE = 13–17%). Moreover, the cost for preparing EDOT-containing molecules is generally lower than that for spiro-fluorene-based HTMs. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of large-scale manufacturing in industries, it appears to be reasonable to use EDOT-based HTMs as an alternative to the costly spiro-OMeTAD. However, we found that accessing the D–π–EDOT–π–D type molecules was synthetically very tedious (eight chemical transformations via Stille or Suzuki couplings),11,12 much more complicated than preparing spiro-OMeTAD (two steps including the bromination and amination of spirobifluorene). Although some pioneers employed direct C–H (hetero)arylation to access π-conjugated systems,13–16 they never targeted HTM applications. Therefore, in contrast to the traditional approach, we provide herein a straightforward and viable synthetic design in which D–π–EDOT–π–D can be facilely obtained through sequential C–H (hetero)arylations (Fig. 1 and Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge, this report represents a new one-pot synthesis of D–π–D–π–D type oligoaryls for use in perovskite solar cells.

 Scheme 1  Synthetic strategy analysis: multi-step vs. two-step in one-pot approaches for the D–π–D–π–D type HTMs. 
The analysis of two synthetic strategies is detailed in Scheme 1. In a traditional multi-step synthesis, the key building block (E) was constructed by the Suzuki coupling reaction, which required the bromination of EDOT (A) and the boronation of 2-bromothiophene (C). Molecule (E) was then brominated to give (H). The donor-type bromoarene (F) must be converted into a coupling reagent carrying a boronic ester by using the costly bis(pinacolato)diboron (∼3000 USD per mol) in order to undergo a second Suzuki reaction with (H), which led to the target D–π–EDOT–π–D. However, by employing our two-step in one-pot synthetic approach, molecule (E) can be alternatively generated through the direct C–H heteroarylation of EDOT (A) with (C) in a chemoselective manner, avoiding the tedious prefunctionalization steps of (A) and (C). Furthermore, the not-isolated intermediate (E) may directly undergo second C–H arylation with (F) to afford D–π–EDOT–π–D. This unprecedented strategy substantially reduces synthetic steps for accessing D–π–EDOT–π–D type HTMs.
First, as shown in Scheme 2, EDOT (A) proceeded [Pd]-catalyzed C–H diheteroarylations with 2-bromothiophene chemoselectively to generate compound 1 as a major product, resulting from the different pKa values of proton a (Ha) of EDOT and proton b (Hb) of 2-bromothiophene. It is worth noting that undesired side reactions such as the homopolymerization of 2-bromothiophene or further heteroarylations of 1 were minimized by the optimized reaction time and temperature (3 h, 100 °C). Without isolation and purification, intermediate 1 directly underwent a second C–H arylation with the donor-type aryl bromides 2a–d, leading to the formation of target HTMs M104,12KM03, KM05, and KM07 in 31–60% yields.17
 Scheme 2  Two-step in one-pot synthesis of D–π–D–π–D HTMs: M104, KM03, KM05, and KM07. aReaction conditions for sequential C–H (hetero)arylations: (i) EDOT A (1.00 mmol), 2-bromothiophene (2.20 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%), P(Cy)3 (20 mol%), PivOH (30 mol%), K2CO3 (3.00 mmol), DMF (3 mL), 100 °C, 3 h; (ii) K2CO3 (3.00 mmol), donor-type aryl bromide 2a–d (2.20 mmol), 100 °C, 24 h. bThe reported isolated yield of the four HTMs was calculated based on the 70% conversion from A to 1. 
Some useful properties of the obtained oligoaryls were investigated and the data were collected and shown in Table 1. The optical bandgap (ΔEg) of the four HTMs was determined from the UV/vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra (ΔEg = 1240/λintersect). ΔEg of the triphenylamine (TPA)-ended M104 and KM03 (2.03–2.04 eV) is smaller than that of carbazole (Cbz)-ended KM05 and KM07 (2.11 eV), resulting from the better electron-donating ability of the TPA moiety that leads to a more efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). An electrochemical property study was performed by cyclic voltammetry, showing that the HOMO of all HTMs is located between the perovskite layer's (EHOMO = −5.43 eV) and the silver electrode's HOMO (EHOMO = −4.20 eV), implying that these molecules are able to extract holes effectively from CH3NH3PbI3 (perovskite). Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that M104 and KM05 are thermally more stable (Td = 378 °C; 390 °C) than KM03 and KM07 (Td = 225 °C; 218 °C). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the HTMs was estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that the Tg of the Cbz-ended HTMs (KM05 and KM07) is higher than that of the TPA-ended HTMs (M104 and KM03) by ca. 30 °C. The hole mobility of each HTM calculated in accordance with space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) revealed that M104 exhibited the highest charge transport capability (2.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and is superior to spiro-OMeTAD (2.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

M104, KM03, KM05, or KM07 was then fabricated as a hole-transporting layer in perovskite-based solar cells. The photovoltaic performance of each solar device was investigated and the results are summarized in Table 2. A solar cell with spiro-OMeTAD was used as a reference (open-circuit voltage: Voc = 1.065 V/short-circuit current: Jsc = 22.26 mA cm−2/fill factor: FF = 0.748), and the other cells employing M104, KM05, and KM07 as HTMs exhibited comparable Voc (0.994–1.042 V) and Jsc (19.34–21.40 mA cm−2), leading to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 13.30–15.37%. The methoxy anchors for M104, KM05, and KM07 have been widely studied and used to generate efficient adsorption/attachment on the perovskite surface,18 while the methylthio group on KM03 was found to be a less efficient anchoring group, thus resulting in a lower Jsc and FF that correspond to an inferior PCE (7.08%). Furthermore, the photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of our solar devices was also explored and the spectra are provided in Fig. 2b, showing that M104-, KM05-, and KM07-based cells reached approximately 80% IPCE in the region of 450–600 nm. The cells using KM03 as a hole transporter, however, exhibited a much lower efficiency, which is consistent with its relatively smaller Jsc value as shown in Table 2.

Finally, we attempted to test the device stability with respect to the PCE. Perovskite solar cells using M104 or spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM were examined by a continuous PCE (η) vs. time (t) measurement experiment (Fig. 3). The PCEs reached high values within 10 s and remained stable for more than 600 s. PSCs based on M104 exhibited a stabilized efficiency of 15.3%, matching well with the value obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. 2a). Moreover, it is commonly accepted that a steady power output is closer to the reality than the averaged value calculated from the forward/backward scannings.19 This indicated that the stability of solar devices with M104 is comparable to that of PSCs with commercial spiro-OMeTAD, even though the efficiency of M104 was shown to be lower.

In summary, we describe an atom-/step-economical synthetic strategy for accessing D–π–D–π–D type hole-transporting materials (HTMs) via consecutive C–H (hetero)arylations in one pot. One of the obtained HTMs showed a promising PCE of 15.4% while fabricated as the hole-transport layer of perovskite solar cells. In contrast to the most used Stille or Suzuki reactions, this approach substantially reduced the chemical transformations from 7–8 steps to 2 steps (in one pot), exhibiting its potential to become a viable and practical synthesis alternative for use in materials chemistry and organic electronics.

The isolated yields of KM03, KM05, and KM07 appeared to be low because the by-products generated from the 1st step (e.g. monoarylated EDOT) also reacted with the donor-type aryl bromide in the 2nd step. In other words, we speculated that there were competitive C–H arylation reactions taking place between the by-products or intermediate 1 with the corresponding aryl bromide.
