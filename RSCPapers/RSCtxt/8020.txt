    , Accepted 11th April 2023First published on 13th April 2023AbstractCs2TiBr6 stands as a promising Pb-free alternative perovskite material having demonstrated its potential in photovoltaics. However, it is considered to be highly unstable in air, hindering further improvements and raising concerns regarding its practical implementation. In this work, we report on a method to improve the stability of Cs2TiBr6 NCs using SnBr4 in a facile surface treatement.
Lead halide perovskites, with structure APbX3, where A is a cation and X is a halide ion, are the only solution-processed semiconductors to outperform polycrystalline Si and thin-film photovoltaics and as a result have attracted tremendous attention.1 However, the presence of lead may raise regulatory concerns and impact commercialization due to its toxicity.2,3 In view of this, over the last few years, several novel perovskite and perovskite-inspired structures have been reported containing environmentally-friendly elements. Vacancy-ordered double perovskites are perovskite-inspired structures with general formula A2BX6, in which the B element possesses oxidation state +4. Since titanium is an abundant element in the earth's crust,4 it is nontoxic and its perovskites are intrinsically stable, it is considered one of the potential alternative candidates to replace lead in halide perovskites. In 2018, a titanium-based vacancy-ordered double perovskite with chemical formula Cs2TiBr6 was first reported5 followed by its demonstration in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 3.3%,6 which represents nowadays one of the best performing Pb+2- and Sn+2-free perovskite solar cell, together with bismuth-, silver-, and antimony-based perovskite devices.7–13
Since 2018, different groups synthesised Cs2TiBr6 using different methods and they all reported on its extremely high instability in air.14–19 Upon air exposure the dark red perovskite decomposes producing CsBr and amorphous TiO2.17,18
Solution-processed perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) already demonstrated outstanding optoelectronic properties20–22 and reported efficiency in solar cells above 15%.23 The functionalization of their surface through the use of short ligands, or the growth of a coating around the NCs to produce the so-called “core-shell” structure proved to be an effective method to increase the stability in air and passivation of surface defects of lead perovskite nanocrystals.24,25
We hypothesised that treating Cs2TiBr6 NCs through a surface treatment with tin salts might increase their stability in air, based on the fact that Cs2SnBr6 is stable in air, as we verified and in agreement with the literature.26–28 Therefore, we attempted to stabilize Cs2TiBr6 with a post-synthetic treatment using SnBr4, bearing in mind that Sn+4 is toxicologically inactive contrary to Sn+2.29 Ti+4 and Sn+4 have comparable radii,30 so we expected either a core-shell structure to form, with structure Cs2TiBr6@Cs2SnBr6, or a gradual cation exchange between Sn and Ti to occur, as this was the outcome of similar procedures carried out for the case of CsPbBr3 with bromide salts of Sn+2, Cd+2 and Zn+2, or CsPbCl3 with Mn+2Cl2.31,32
In this paper, we demonstrate the first reported method to increase the stability of Cs2TiBr6 perovskite through a post-synthetic treatment with SnBr4, paving the way towards further studies on the applications of this material in devices.
For the optimization of the post-synthetic treatment, we tuned the amount of SnBr4 added in the Cs2TiBr6 NC solution and the time and temperature of the reaction, in order to obtain the most stable product. After synthesizing Cs2TiBr6 NCs following our previously published method,14 2.5 ml of the NC solution was left under nitrogen flow inside the 3-neck flask and a solution of 103 mg of SnBr4 dissolved in 2 ml of toluene was slowly injected. The total solution was stirred for 30 minutes under nitrogen at room temperature. Afterwards, the solution was washed inside the glovebox adding acetone as antisolvent and centrifuging at 5800 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate redispersed in 2 ml of toluene.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD of the product, together with the calculated patterns for pure Cs2TiBr6 (in red) and Cs2SnBr6 (in green). The product possesses Fmm space group symmetry, which is the space group symmetry of vacancy-ordered double perovskites, and diffraction peaks between those of the two perovskites, indicating that during the treatment Sn inserted in the perovskite structure, taking the same position as titanium. A lattice parameter of 10.805(4) Å was determined from Rietveld refinement of the diffraction pattern, which stays between the lattice parameter of Cs2TiBr6 (10.706(3) Å) and that of Cs2SnBr6 (10.840(3) Å). The narrower peaks of the treated perovskite compared to the ones of the untreated one (in Fig. 2(a)), suggests that the treated NCs increased in size. From Scherrer equation, we calculated that the mean size of the NCs increases from 9.8 ± 0.9 nm to 10.2 ± 0.2 nm after the treatment, in good agreement with the values extracted from TEM images, as discussed later.

The narrow peak at 32.97 degrees, which overlaps with the perovskite peak, originates from the silicon substrate.

After the post-synthetic treatment, we observed a higher stability of the perovskite in air by looking at the evolution of the diffraction peaks over time after air exposure. While untreated Cs2TiBr6 NCs completely decompose after few minutes in air into crystalline CsBr and amorphous TiO2 (and its hydrated form) (Fig. 2(a)),17,18 so that it is not possible to measure its diffraction pattern unless inside a special nitrogen filled sample holder, the SnBr4-treated Cs2TiBr6 NCs are stable for some hours, up to 8 hours in air, depending on the humidity conditions, while after 24 hours the CsBr peak appears at 29.3 degrees (Fig. 2(b)). Since it was reported that the decomposition of Cs2TiBr6 occurs faster under humidity than under pure O2 atmosphere,18 we checked the stability of the SnBr4-treated sample both under 100% humidity conditions and when stored in a desiccator with 5% controlled humidity. Under 100% humidity environment, the sample is stable for less than one hour (Fig. S1, ESI†) while in the desiccator the sample is stable for over 1 week, though after 2 weeks CsBr peaks appear (Fig. 2(c)).
FTIR measurements over time in air reveal the presence of moisture (O–H stretching mode) in the untreated sample from the first minutes of air exposure (Fig. S2(a), ESI†). After the treatment, the same peak is only slightly visible after one day in air (Fig. S2(b), ESI†).
After observing that the post-synthetic treatment was effective in stabilizing the perovskite, a complete characterization of the product was carried out, in order to investigate its chemical composition, the change in the NCs’ morphology and in their optical properties after the treatment.
ICP-OES data, listed in Table S1 (ESI†), indicate that the percentage of B components is 43% Sn and 57% Ti, while the ratio Cs/(Sn + Ti) is 1.83, close to the expected A/B atomic ratio in vacancy-ordered double perovskites, which is 2. This lower ratio suggests the surface is rich in B component, while for the untreated perovskite we previously observed higher Cs content.14 This result is reasonable since the post-synthetic treatment was carried out only with the addition of SnBr4. The elemental analysis was completed carrying out XPS analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†) and EDX mapping (Fig. S4, ESI†). XPS fitting confirms the presence of the elements in the expected oxidation states, namely Cs+1, Ti+4, Sn+4 and Br−1. EDX mapping shows that all the elements in the sample are homogenously distributed.
TEM images before and after the surface treatment are illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (d). In both cases, the NCs have relatively symmetrical shapes. From the statistical analysis of the size of the NCs, considering 150 NCs per sample, we observed that after the treatment the average diameter of the NCs increases from 9.6 ± 1.4 nm to 11.9 ± 1.9 nm (Fig. 3(c) and (f)). We explained this result bearing in mind that the post-synthetic treatment with SnBr4 is carried out in the crude Cs2TiBr6 solution before carrying out any washing step, so that this increase in radius might be due to a “shell” formation from SnBr4 added into the solution and the unreacted Cs oleate precursor left from the reaction.

(b) and (e), plots of the width vs. the length of the nanoparticles, which indicate the nanoparticles are close to the symmetry. (c) and (f), histograms of the NCs diameters, calculated from the area of the NCs, indicating for the untreated sample (c) an average NC diameter of 9.6 nm, with a standard deviation of ± 1.4 nm; for the SnBr4-treated sample, an average NC diameter of 11.9 nm, with a standard deviation of ± 1.9 nm. 
Interestingly, we carried out the synthesis of the alloy structure, with formula Cs2Ti1−xSnxBr6 and the same percentage of tin as the SnBr4-treated sample, and observed it is highly unstable in air. The synthesis of the alloys Cs2Ti1−xSnxBr6 and of pure Cs2SnBr6 was carried out by replacing partially or totally the titanium precursor with tin precursor at the beginning of the synthesis. From the XRD of the products, we observed that they possess a Fmm space group symmetry and lattice parameters between those of Cs2TiBr6 and Cs2SnBr6 (XRD patterns, ICP-OES data and absorption spectra in Fig. S5–S7, ESI†). We prepared one alloy containing 44% of Sn and one containing 60% of Sn (from ICP-OES measurements). From XRD measurements over time we observed that while the 44% sample, which has an amount of Sn in the structure comparable to the SnBr4-treated Cs2TiBr6 NCs sample, decomposes in air within the time of the XRD scan (10 minutes), the 60% sample is as stable as the treated one (Fig. S4, ESI†). The difference in stability between the SnBr4-treated Cs2TiBr6 sample and the alloy samples suggests that, in the treated sample, Sn concentration is higher closer to the surface of the NCs, which explains the higher stability of the treated sample and which is reasonably due to the diffusion mechanism of SnBr4 through the NC during the post-synthetic treatment.
After the structural and morphological characterization, the optical analysis was carried out. Fig. 4(a) shows the absorption of the treated NCs in solution plotted together with the absorption spectrum of untreated Cs2TiBr6 for comparison. The spectrum of the treated sample shows the excitonic peaks characteristic of Cs2TiBr6,33 more visible in Fig. S8(a) (ESI†), and a very steep increase in intensity at short wavelengths, as both Cs2SnBr6 spectrum and SnBr4 spectrum (Fig. S8(b), ESI†). The onset of absorption of both samples is approximately 2.2 eV, indicating the bandgap does not significantly change after the treatment.

The photoluminescence of the SnBr4-treated NC solution was also measured and is plotted together with the absorption spectrum in Fig. 4(b). When exciting at 420 nm, a very weak peak centred at 594 nm was observed. Compared to the PL peak of Cs2TiBr6, observed previously,14 that was found at 580 nm, the treated and untreated samples show the same large Stokes shift, broad peaks and low emission intensities, which have been ascribed to the presence of emissive self-trapped exciton (STE) states in vacancy-ordered double perovskites.33
Photodetector devices were further fabricated with a lateral structure. The SnBr4-treated Cs2TiBr6 perovskite NCs were spin-coated onto the substrates with pre-patterned electrodes. The photoresponse of perovskite nanocrystals was measured with 520nm laser as light source. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), photodetector devices showed clear photoresponse following modulated laser light, with an on/off time of several milliseconds.
In conclusion, we have developed a method to increase the stability of Cs2TiBr6 in air from few minutes to several hours, through a post-synthetic treatment using SnBr4. From the structural and the elemental analysis, we observed that the vacancy-ordered double perovskite structure is maintained after the treatment and that Sn inserted. From the comparison with an alloy structure with the same amount of Sn, we believe that Sn+4 is not distributed homogenously in the treated NCs but that its concentration gradually decreases from the surface to the centre of the NC. From the optical characterization, it was observed that after the treatment the bandgap is not significantly affected, though the shape of the absorption spectrum transformed, with higher intensities at shorted wavelengths. Finally, a photodetector device was fabricated to demonstrate the treated material shows photoresponse.
