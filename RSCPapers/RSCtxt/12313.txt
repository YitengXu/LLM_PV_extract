    , Accepted 26th May 2015First published on 26th May 2015AbstractIn this paper, we have reported a new, visible-light-driven photocatalyst composed of 2D mesoporous TiO2 on reduced graphene oxide, which enables enhanced absorption of visible light, showing outstanding charge separation ability and a large surface area. Graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 (GOMTi) was prepared via a simple hydrothermal process by ternary self-assembly of metal oxide precursors, graphene oxide, and a surfactant. The structural strength and large interfacial contact between the graphene and two dimensional TiO2 sheet lead to a high performance photocatalyst, as compared to a conventional graphene–TiO2 nanostructure composite. In the test for degradation of methylene blue, the photodegradation rate of GOMTi was ∼9 times higher than the rate of common TiO2 nanoparticles (p25), due to the enhanced synergetic effects of graphene and TiO2.
Introduction
The technology of nanostructured photocatalysts is currently the most exciting interdisciplinary research area in the field of materials, energy, and environmental technology because of the potential use of this technology in the degradation of toxic organic molecules, hydrogen production by splitting water, and the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons using light energy.1–7 These applications play an important role in solving current environmental problems and the energy crisis. When a photocatalyst absorbs solar energy, which is larger than the band gap of the semiconducting photocatalyst, electrons and hole pairs are generated, and move to the surface of the catalyst where the oxidation and reduction reactions occur. In general, most photocatalysts are very inefficient in absorbing light and have low photo-efficiency per absorbing photon. For example, TiO2 can utilize only UV light, which is 3% of the total sunlight, due to its large bandgap (3.2 eV).8 Photo-excited electrons and holes are rapidly recombined and dissipated as heat energy before they reach the reaction site, resulting in poor photo-efficiency.9
To enhance the light absorption and photo-efficiency of photocatalysts, the graphene–photocatalyst nanocomposite has been intensively studied in recent years.1,10–16 A hybrid consisting of photocatalysts and graphene can supplement outstanding synergetic effects when the two materials are combined to form a composite. This might be due to the unpaired π electrons of graphene, which has a high surface area that can reduce the bandgap of the photocatalyst by providing a doping effect on TiO2, thereby enhancing their absorption of visible light.1,17 Graphene, which has excellent charge mobility, provides conductive electron channels for separation of the electrons, resulting in inhibition of the recombination of electrons and holes.18–20 Thus, a hybrid composed of the photocatalyst and graphene can increase not only the photo-absorption but also the photo-efficiency per absorbing photon. In addition, a two dimensional graphene sheet is a good template for fabricating a broad range of photocatalyst nanostructures. However, the synthesis of highly dense sub 10 nm sized photocatalysts without aggregation, such as TiO2 on graphene, is still very difficult, and affects the properties of the photocatalyst.21,22 More importantly, the light absorption and photo-efficiency of the graphene–photocatalyst nanocomposites need to be improved in order to use them in practical applications. Nanostructures in photocatalyst systems have been utilized in the creation of composites with graphene, to achieve a synergetic effect between the two materials. An increase in photo-efficiency can be achieved by optimal structure design for efficient electron movement, such as with 1D nanostructures, 2D nanosheets, and mesoporous materials.6,23,24
Various types of graphene–photocatalyst composites, which include TiO2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene,17 graphene wrapped TiO2 particles,1 graphene–CdS nanocluster composites,25 and graphene–SnO2 nanoparticle composites,26 have been suggested to enhance the efficiency of nanostructured photocatalysts with the help of graphene. Incorporation of the graphene sheet into ∼20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in an improvement in photodegradation, both in UV and visible light, compared to single component TiO2 nanoparticles (p25).17 TiO2 particles wrapped in graphene were synthesized to enhance the effect of graphene through conformal contact between graphene and the TiO2 particles.1 Other semiconducting photocatalysts, such as SnO2 and CdS, were also applied on graphene in the form of a nanosized cluster. This system showed an increase in the photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of Rhodamin B (RhB) and the photosplitting of water, respectively.25,26 In order to use graphene–photocatalyst nanostructures for applications such as photosplitting of water, photoconversion of CO2, photodetector and photovoltaic cells, their light absorption and photo-efficiency have to be sufficiently high.
We have significantly improved the light absorption and photo-efficiency of graphene–photocatalyst composites by constructing two dimensional (2D) mesoporous TiO2 structures on a graphene surface, in which the composite was synthesized by a one-pot synthesis method via ternary self-assembly of the surfactant, titania precursor, and graphene oxide. The graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite (GOMTi) consists of vertically aligned, two dimensional mesoporous TiO2 with uniform pores (sub 10 nm pore) and a thin wall (∼3 nm) on graphene oxide. We demonstrated that the 2D mesoporous TiO2 on the graphene sheet significantly enhances the surface area of the mesoporous photocatalyst and the interfacial area between the mesoporous catalyst and graphene. In addition, these mesoporous photocatalysts with nanosized TiO2 walls on graphene do not show any aggregation behavior, unlike previous photocatalyst nanostructures. Thus, the open mesopores with very thin TiO2 walls provide more reactive sites and a short diffusion length to decrease the recombination rate. Furthermore, the large interfacial area between graphene and mesoporous TiO2 leads to enhanced electron transfer and light absorption properties. As a result, the absorption of light energy in the visible light region improved, by a red-shift of 30 nm. Photo-degradation test results of methylene blue in visible light show that the photo-degradation rate increased by a factor of 9 as compared to that of conventional TiO2 nanoparticles (P25), and by a factor of 2 compared to that of graphene–TiO2 nanoparticle composites.
Results and discussion
Graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite synthesis and characterization
The graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite (GOMTi) was synthesized via the hydrothermal process and ternary self-assembly of graphene oxide, titanium precursors (titanium tetraisopropoxide, TTIP) and a non-ionic surfactant (PEO20PPO70PEO20, P123) (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1a, graphene oxide and P123 were mixed into the ethanol solutions, followed by sonication and vigorous stirring. The non-ionic surfactant, a triblock copolymer based on poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(propylene glycol)–poly(ethylene glycol) (PEO20PPO70PEO20, P123), is self-assembled into a spherical form on a 2D graphene sheet after the addition of P123 to the ethanol solution. The non-ionic surfactant consists of a hydrophilic chain on the outer part and a hydrophobic chain on the inner part.27 As the ionic titania precursor is added to the solution, the titanium ions attach the outer part of micelles of P123 and polymerization occurs. Further polymerization leads to the connection of the neighboring micelles (Fig. 1b). This causes phase transformation of the surfactant from a spherical to a cylindrical structure (Fig. 1c).28 It is important to note that different components of the graphene–photocatalyst composite can be prepared, provided different inorganic semiconductors are used. The condensation reaction of the TiO2 precursor was then conducted overnight at room temperature (298 K), with the help of hydrochloric acid. The two dimensional structure of the resulting TiO2 was achieved by controlling the HCl concentration (Fig. 1d). In the graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite, two dimensional graphene oxide plays an important role as a hard template to prepare mesoporous 2D TiO2 in powder form.29 The calcination of the as-synthesized samples was carried out at 673 K for 4 hours, in order to eliminate the surfactants as soft templates and to crystallize the mesoporous TiO2 (Fig. 1e). Finally, the resulting graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 was fabricated in the form of a powder.

Fig. 2 shows representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite. In the TEM images (Fig. 2), the dark and bright regions represent the crystalline TiO2 walls and mesopores on the graphene sheets, respectively. The contrast in the image is generated by variations in the projection of the electron beam, which is normal to the image in the figures. The 2D TiO2 mesopores are vertically aligned with respect to the graphene sheet, and fully opened with large interfacial contact between the reduced graphene oxide and TiO2 (Fig. 2a). The average pore size and wall thickness are about ∼8 nm and ∼3 nm, respectively, as taken from many different TEM images. This is in agreement with data from small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1†) and the BJH adsorption pore volume (Fig. S2b†). The magnified image clearly shows the lattice spacing of (101) of anatase (Fig. 2b), confirming the generation of highly crystalline TiO2 on the graphene. The TiO2 mesopores are interconnected with high rigidity and stability even after heat treatment at 673 K. In contrast, TiO2 nanoparticles tend to aggregate at high temperatures.

To investigate the crystalline phase of TiO2 during the fabrication process, measurements were made using wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized (black line) and post-calcined samples (red line), in which the as-synthesized and post-calcined composite samples were prepared by the sol–gel reaction at room temperature (298 K) and additional heat treatment at 673 K, respectively. The broad peak in the as-synthesized TiO2 indicates amorphous TiO2 at room temperature. After the calcination process at 673 K, the WAXS peaks appear at 25.2°, 37.7°, 47.9°, 54° and 54.8°, representing a typical anatase structure (JCPDS, no. 21-1272), which is the most photoactive crystalline phase in TiO2.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the as-prepared graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 before calcination (black) and after calcination at 673 K for 4 h under an Ar atmosphere (red). 
Moreover, we found that the mesoporous crystalline TiO2 was synthesized on a few layers of graphene, without any restacking of graphene sheets. The XRD pattern of graphene oxide shows a sharp diffraction peak at ∼9.4° (Fig. S3†).30 After fabricating mesoporous TiO2 on the graphene oxide by the hydrothermal process, the peak for graphene oxide disappeared, indicating that graphene oxide sheets were exfoliated by the mesoporous TiO2 sheet on both sides of each graphene oxide sheet. After the calcination process at 673 K, the exfoliated graphene oxide sheets were not restacked. Thus, the mesoporous crystalline TiO2 caused exfoliation of the graphene oxide sheet, and prevented their restacking after the calcination process.
It should be noted that graphene oxide in the GOMTi was significantly reduced during the calcination process. To examine the chemical state of graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 during the fabrication process, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out. In the survey spectrum of GOMTi, only carbon, oxygen and titanium exist without any impurities (Fig. 4a). In the Ti2P spectrum, there are doublet peaks of Ti 2P1/2 (B.E. ∼ 458.9 eV) and Ti 2P3/2 (B.E. ∼ 464.7 eV), which elucidate the Ti4+ chemical state, thereby indicating that titanium exists in the form of TiO2 (Fig. 4b). The C1S spectrum of GOMTi shows an intense peak corresponding to a carbon–carbon single bond (C–C, B.E. ∼ 284.3 eV), along with relatively weak peaks of carbon–hydroxide bonding (C–OH, B.E. ∼ 285.8 eV) and carbon-ketone bonding (CO, B.E ∼ 289.8 eV) (Fig. 4c). However, compared to the peaks for pristine graphene oxide (Fig. 4d), the peak intensities of the hydroxide and ketone groups decreased significantly after incorporating mesoporous crystalline TiO2 onto the graphene oxide. The hydroxide group, in particular, remained at only 10%. This indicates that after the calcination process at 673 K, the graphene oxide was remarkably reduced, with the detachment of oxygen functional groups and restoration of sp2 bonding in carbon. The graphene oxide contains many oxygen functional groups on the basal plane, possessing numerous sp3 carbon, which lacks the electrical properties derived from the conjugation of π electrons of sp2 carbon.31 The reduced graphene oxide enhances charge separation properties that prevent the recombination of electron and hole pairs.32 As shown in photoluminescence(PL) data, the intensity of PL in GOMTi was low compared to that of bare TiO2, which shows that recombination of electron and hole pairs is significantly retarded by the incorporation of graphene into the TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. S4†).

Photocatalytic activity of graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite: surface area, light absorption properties and photodegradation of organic molecules
The graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 (GOMTi) has a large surface area. N2 adsorption analysis results (Fig. S2a†) showed that the adsorption–desorption isothermal plot had a hysteresis loop of type IV, which is characteristic of a mesoporous structure. The specific surface area of the graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 is 130.5 cm3 g−1, which is much larger than that of the graphene–conventional TiO2 nanoparticle (p25) composite (51 cm3 g−1)17 and graphene–TiO2 hybrid nanosheet (95.8–114.9 cm3 g−1),11 and is comparable to the graphene–mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle composite (176 cm3 g−1).33 The exfoliated graphene sheet and mesoporous structure provide a high surface area, which is very important for the efficiency of the catalyst due to the large number of reactive sites for the reactants and electrons in the photocatalyst.
In order to compare the light absorption properties of various types of graphene–TiO2 composites, we measured the UV-visible diffuse reflective spectra of four different specimens (Fig. 5a and c): (i) conventional TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, black), (ii) graphene–P25 composites (G-P25, green), (iii) mesoporous TiO2 (MTi, blue) and (iv) graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 (GOMTi, red). The G-P25 was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of graphene and P25 in an autoclave at 393 K (Fig. 5c).17 The mesoporous TiO2 was prepared by the elimination of graphene sheets in the graphene–mesoporous TiO2 composite via heat treatment in an air atmosphere. The conventional TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) and mesoporous TiO2 have large bandgaps of 3.1 eV and 3.24 eV, indicating significantly low photoactivity in visible light. It is well known that bare crystalline TiO2, anatase and rutile, does not absorb visible light due to the large bandgap.9 Incorporation of graphene into TiO2 nanomaterials caused a red-shift of light absorption and the bandgap was reduced in both mesoporous TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles. The increase in the absorption of visible light appeared in the graphene composites due to the direct interaction between carbon and titanium atoms during the hydrothermal process, as well as the doping effects of the remaining unpaired π electrons generated during the reduction of graphene oxide to Ti atoms during the phase transformation.1,34 Moreover, the incorporation of graphene into the 2D mesoporous TiO2 (MTi) caused a strong red-shift and the bandgap of GOMTi was significantly reduced from 3.24 eV to 2.78 eV compared to the graphene–P25 composite. This might be attributed to the large interfacial area between graphene and the TiO2 nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 5b and d, the GOMTi has a 2D–2D heterojunction of graphene and the mesoporous TiO2 sheet, resulting in a large interfacial area, while the G-P25 consists of a 0D–2D heterojunction of TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene. The 2D mesoporous TiO2 has the advantage of high visible light absorption due to enhanced interfacial interaction between graphene and the TiO2 nanostructures.

We tested the photocatalytic activity of the graphene–mesoporous TiO2 sheet composite for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. We used a cut-off filter, which allows wavelengths greater than 420 nm to pass, with a 300 W light source. To determine the rate of photodegradation, we measured the intrinsic absorbance peak intensities of MB with the maximum absorbance peak (665 nm) as a function of time, which is directly related to the concentration of methylene blue. We used 10 mg of the catalyst in 30 mL of methylene blue solution at a concentration of 3 × 10−5 M. Before starting the photodegradation test, the change in MB concentration was checked in the dark, which provided time for the adsorption of MB on the surface of the photocatalyst. The ratio of MB absorbed on GOMTi is 0.55, higher than that of G-P25, 0.33. This supports the statement that GOMTi provides large number of reactive sites, which enhances photoactivity (Fig. S6†). Fig. 6a shows the MB concentration profiles of P25 (black square), G-P25 (green inverted triangle), MTi (blue upright triangle), and GOMTi (red circle) in visible light. The MB degraded slowly in P25, with a rate constant of 0.53 × 10−3 min−1, due to the low visible-light absorption, fast recombination of electrons and holes, and low surface area. The mesoporous TiO2 sheet without graphene exhibits a relatively fast MB photodegradation rate (k = 2.04 × 10−3 min−1) as compared to P25; however, only 37% of the MB was decomposed after 3 h. Incorporation of graphene into the P25 composite increases the rate of photodegradation of MB to k = 2.24 × 10−3 min−1. Photodegradation of the graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 increased significantly to k = 4.63 × 10−3 min−1, which is 9 times higher than that of the conventional TiO2 particles. GOMTi exhibited a photodegradation rate that was twice the rate of the graphene–P25 composite (k = 2.24 × 10−3 min−1) (Fig. 6b). This is attributed to the high surface area and increased visible light absorption, which is a consequence of the unique two dimensional mesoporous structures on the graphene sheet. As a result, the hybrid structure consisting of a two dimensional mesoporous photocatalyst and graphene had significantly high photocatalytic activity due to an increase in light absorption and charge separation, arising from the large interfacial area. In the graphene–nanostructured photocatalyst composites, the morphology of the nanostructure is a key factor in determining the performance of the photocatalyst in maximizing the synergetic effects of graphene.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 (GOMTi) for visible-light-driven photocatalysis. GOMTi was synthesized via the ternary self-assembly of graphene oxide, a TiO2 precursor, and a surfactant. The mesoporous TiO2 sheets with sub 10 nm pores have a large specific surface area, with a rigid interconnected 3 nm thin TiO2 wall. The combination of graphene and 2D mesoporous TiO2 increases the performance of graphene as a cocatalyst due to the large contact area between the sheet materials. Graphene inhibited the recombination of generated electron–hole pairs to increase the photoefficiency and decrease the bandgap of the photocatalyst by the doping effect of unpaired π electrons, thereby increasing the absorption of visible light. The result was a 9 fold increase in the rate of photodegradation of methylene blue in visible light compared to P25 and a 2 fold increase compared to other graphene based TiO2 composites. GOMTi's outstanding properties, such as an enhanced synergic effect with graphene for the absorption of visible light, fast charge separation, and high surface area, make it an attractive technology for use in many electrochemical applications, such as photocatalysis, energy storage devices, and chemical sensors.
Experimental section
Synthesis of graphene–2D mesoporous TiO2 composite
GO (graphene oxide) was synthesized from preoxidized graphite powder by the modified Hummer's method.27 Initially, 1 g of graphite powder was dissolved in 30 ml of sulfuric acid. 3.5 g of potassium permanganate was then slowly added to the graphite solution with vigorous stirring. After the reaction was allowed to proceed at 308 K for 2 h, the solution was cooled in an ice bath and 200 mL of deionized water was added to dilute the solution. After sufficient mixing, 100 mL of hydrogen peroxide was added to the solution. The yellow mixture was filtered and washed several times using hydrochloric acid. The remaining solvent was removed by processing the samples overnight under dry vacuum at room temperature.
2.0 g of P123 was dissolved in 30 mL ethanol, and 0.1 g of GO was dispersed in the solution by stirring and sonication. To prepare the hydrolyzed titanium precursor, 10 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich) was mixed with 5.92 mL of HCl and aged for 24 h. The hydrolyzed titanium precursor was slowly dropped into the GO solution with vigorous stirring followed by aging overnight at room temperature. The as-synthesized sample was collected by vacuum filtration. After the hydrothermal process, the products were allowed to calcinate in argon at 673 K for 4 h, at a heating rate of 1 K min−1.
Methylene blue degradation test
The measurement of photocatalytic activity was carried out by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The MB solution was prepared by dissolving MB in water at a concentration of 3 × 10−5 M. After adding the photocatalyst to the MB solution at a concentration of 10 mg/30 mL, it was stirred in the dark until the MB was fully adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst. After confirming that there was no change in the intensity in the UV absorption peak, the photodegradation test was carried out in light. A sample was collected every 30 min, and the dispersed catalyst was eliminated by centrifugation. The activity of the photocatalytic degradation of MB was calculated using the intensity of the UV absorption peak at 665 nm, which is the main intrinsic peak of MB.
Characterization
The prepared samples were characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips Technical F30), a small-angle X-ray diffractometer (SAXS, Rigaku D/Max-2500(SWXD)), a high power X-ray diffractometer (WAXS, Rigaku D/max-2500), an X-Ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo VG Scientific Sigma Probe), a UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (V-570, Jasco), and a spectroflurophotometer (RF 5301-PC, Shimadu). N2 adsorption was carried out at 77 K using a micromeritic ASAP 2000.
