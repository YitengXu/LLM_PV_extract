    , Accepted 14th February 2019First published on 16th February 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite field effect transistors have attracted considerable attention. However, reports on perovskite transistors utilizing polymer gate dielectrics are relatively rare. In this paper, we have successfully fabricated two-dimensional (2D) perovskite phenylethylammonium tin iodide ((PEA)2SnI4) field-effect transistors with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) modified by cross-linking (CL) poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) as gate dielectrics (PVA/CL-PVP) in a bottom-gate configuration by a spin coating method. The (PEA)2SnI4 thin films are found to possess a highly crystalline layered structure that facilitates lateral charge carrier transport. The PVA/CL-PVP gate dielectric layers not only have uniform and smooth surfaces with high solvent resistance and low polarity, but maintain relatively high capacitances and low leakage currents. The transistors can operate at room temperature in air probably because of the compatibility of the (PEA)2SnI4 film and the CL-PVP layer, showing a p-channel characteristic with mobilities of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the forward gate voltage scan and 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the reverse one. In particular, hysteresis in the devices can be neglected because of suppressed ion migration in the (PEA)2SnI4 films, high-quality surfaces of the PVA/CL-PVP layers, and the good compatibility of the perovskite with the polymer gate dielectric. The maximum interface trap densities are estimated to be in the order of 1012 cm−2 eV−1, which further confirms that the gate layers offer a high-quality surface and are highly compatible with the (PEA)2SnI4 films. Our work can provide a new path to integrate solution-processed perovskites and low-cost and commercially available polymer dielectrics in a bottom-gate transistor structure for future applications in solution-based flexible optoelectronics.
Introduction
With the power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites soaring from 3.8% to 23.3% in nearly ten years1,2 and the all-round materials being widely applied in other optoelectronic or electronic fields, such as photodetectors,3 light emitting diodes (LEDs),4 tunable lasers,5 resistive switching memory devices,6 and field-effect transistors (FETs)7, studies on two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites8 and the corresponding devices9–11 have been revived, which were first employed as active materials in LEDs12 and FETs13 two decades ago. Despite the remarkable developments in other kinds of perovskite devices, so far, reports on perovskite FETs are relatively rare. The 3D perovskites used as channel layers in FETs involve methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) thin films14–16 and microplates,17 mixed halide MAPbI1−xClx18 and triple cation Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)1−xPb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (FA: formamidinium) thin films,19 and all-inorganic CsPbBr3 ultrathin platelets.20 However, it is still a great challenge to achieve reliable and high device performance in 3D perovskite FETs at room temperature mainly due to ion migration,15,16 which is believed to lead to poor channel current and large hysteresis. An alternative approach utilizing 2D perovskites in FETs has been demonstrated to be successful in enhancing the device performance, since they possess superior charge carrier mobility and better stability due to their layered structure and suppressed ion migration21 stemming from relatively large organic cations, while simultaneously retaining the exceptional advantages of 3D perovskites. 2D perovskites containing aromatic and aliphatic cations, such as phenylethyl ammonium tin iodides ((PEA)2SnI4) or ((C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4)22,23 and their derivatives24 as well as alkyl ammonium tin iodides ((CnH2n+1NH3)2SnI4 (n = 4 to 12)),25 have been incorporated into FETs. Among them, (PEA)2SnI4 utilized in the first perovskite transistor13 has been proven to be the best channel material, while the mobilities of the transistors based on (CnH2n+1NH3)2SnI4 (n = 4 to 12) are extremely low (∼10−3–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). Recently, a record-breaking hole mobility9 of 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been achieved in the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs operating at room temperature under vacuum, and an electron mobility26 of 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 under the same conditions has been reported as well.
Nevertheless, hysteresis phenomena have also been observed9,23,27 in the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs. The differences in the transfer curves between the forward and reverse gate voltage sweeps were first found in the (PEA)2SnI4 devices23 fabricated by vacuum vapor deposition on heavily doped silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) substrates treated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The hysteresis effect was also reported in the transistors where (PEA)2SnI4 was spin coated on the NH3I-SAM-treated Si/SiO2 substrates9 regardless of the record-breaking mobility. Moreover, the n-channel (PEA)2SnI4 FETs in a top-gate configuration26,28 with Cytop as the gate dielectric suffer from the same problem as well. It is apparent that the hysteresis phenomena in (PEA)2SnI4 transistors are significantly associated with the properties of the perovskite/gate dielectric interfaces27 at which the channels are confined. For both the 3D and 2D perovskite FETs, the most widely-used inorganic gate dielectric is SiO29,13–16,22,23,29 and a few include hafnium(IV) oxide (HfO2)30 prepared on heavily-doped Si substrates, thus limiting the applications of these kinds of materials in flexible electronics. With regards to polymer dielectrics, as far as we know, investigations only on poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA),19 Cytop,9,15,18,26,31 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE))27 have been conducted. In the triple cation 3D perovskite transistors and inverters, PMMA served as the top-gate dielectric layers with Si/SiO2 as substrates. As for Cytop, its relatively high cost makes it not suitable for industrial production. More recently, P(VDF-TrFE) has been integrated into Si/SiO2 substrates acting as gate layers independently for the (PEA)2SnI4 active layers. However, notable hysteresis nevertheless remained even though P(VDF-TrFE) could restrain this negative effect in comparison with SiO2. In order to incorporate perovskites into flexible transistors, which find potential applications in displays, sensing, memory, and electronic skin technologies,32 low-cost polymer gate dielectrics compatible with the materials are highly required. Meanwhile, a prerequisite for constructing perovskite FETs with polymer dielectrics in a bottom-gate geometry by the spin coating technique is to solve the issues of solvent corrosion,33,34 which are usually encountered in solution-processed organic FETs (OFETs). The solvents of (PEA)2SnI4 perovskites, such as N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, and isopropyl alcohol, are not orthogonal to low-cost and commercially available polymer dielectrics, for example, PMMA, polystyrene (PS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP). Consequently, these solvents can dissolve and damage the underlying polymer films during the deposition process, which sets a limit on the integration of these polymers and perovskites into a transistor structure.
In this paper, we report on the utilization of high-dielectric-constant PVA35 as a gate dielectric to fabricate bottom-gate (PEA)2SnI4 transistors on indium-tin oxide-coated glass (ITO-glass) substrates using the spin coating method. The (PEA)2SnI4 thin films are found to possess a 2D layered structure by morphological, structural, and optical characterizations. In respect of the gate dielectric, a thin cross-linking PVP (CL-PVP) layer is employed to modify the PVA layer (PVA/CL-PVP) because its hydroxyl groups exert a great impact on transistor performance36–38 and the solvents of (PEA)2SnI4 dissolve PVA. The PVA/CL-PVP gate layer has a uniform and smooth surface with low polarity, while maintaining a relatively high capacitance and low leakage current. The (PEA)2SnI4 FETs based on the gate layer can operate reliably in air at room temperature, exhibiting good performance. In particular, the hysteresis behavior can be neglected because of suppressed ion migration in the 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 film and the good compatibility of the perovskite with the polymer gate dielectric. The maximum trap density at the interface between (PEA)2SnI4 and CL-PVP evaluated from the subthreshold swing further certifies that the PVA/CL-PVP gate layer provides perovskites with a high quality surface for efficient charge transport and reduced hysteresis.
Results and discussion
The molecular structures of PVA and PVP as well as that of CL-PVP with 4,4-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride (HDA) serving as a cross-linking agent and triethylamine (TEA) as a catalyst are depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The perovskite (PEA)2SnI4 thin films were synthesized using a one-step solution method29 using the N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF) solutions of PEAI and SnI2 as precursors. More experimental details are available in the ESI.† From the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), it can be seen that the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film is pinhole free, uniform, and smooth on the micron scale with the exception of some apparent irregular curves on the surface. We speculated that the curves could be the layer edges, which was confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) characterization. Fig. 1(a) exhibits the AFM height image of one of the curves on the surface of the (PEA)2SnI4 layer. It is evident that the film assembles layer by layer along the direction marked by the white strip. The absolute thickness of each corresponding layer is determined from the curve of height versus lateral distance measured by the AFM line scan, as presented in Fig. 1(b). The AFM step height shows that the thickness of the first layer from the surface is 1.58 nm. To determine the crystal structure, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of the perovskite layer was recorded and is illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The XRD pattern displays a dominant peak at 5.5°and relatively weak peaks at 10.9°, 16.4°, 21.8°, 27.4°, 33.0°,and 38.7°, respectively, which can be ascribed to the reflections of the (00l) (l = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) facets of the film, consistent with previous reports for the 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 thin films.9,13,29 The interlayer spacing of the (PEA)2SnI4 film is estimated to be 16.9 Å at low angles according to Bragg's law, which agrees well with the above value obtained with the AFM line scan and the one in the literature.9 These results indicate that the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film possesses a 2D layered structure and that the alternating organic PEA+ and inorganic [SnI4]2− layers self-assemble along the direction perpendicular to the ITO-glass substrate,25 as the molecular structure of the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film in the inset of Fig. 1(c) illustrates. Charge carrier transport in (PEA)2SnI4 thin films is generally believed to take place in the inorganic frameworks extending along the direction parallel to the substrate surface,25 exactly similar to the 2D charge transport in a transistor channel. Therefore, high device performance can be expected in (PEA)2SnI4 FETs.

In FETs, the thickness of a semiconductor film is known to have influences on the vertical charge carrier transport. Usually, an appropriate thickness should not be larger than 100 nm since a thick layer can prevent charge carrier transport vertically from a source or drain electrode to a conducting channel. We took the cross-sectional image of the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film deposited on an ITO-glass substrate using SEM, as presented in the inset of Fig. S2 (ESI†). The film thickness is estimated to be about 100 nm. Subsequently, we analyzed the energy levels of the (PEA)2SnI4 film by performing optical measurements since a metal-semiconductor contact is crucial for the injection of charge carriers. Fig. 1(d) displays the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite film, respectively. The film exhibits a broad absorption band in the visible light region from 350 to 550 nm and an exciton absorption peak at around 610 nm.29 The exciton absorption peak is indicative of the 2D layered structure of the (PEA)2SnI4 film resulting from the strong dielectric and quantum confinement effects.39 The PL peak locating at 628 nm is red-shifted relative to the absorption one owing to the Stokes effect, from which the optical band gap of 1.97 eV is derived for the (PEA)2SnI4 film.29 To evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the film, we recorded its UV photo-emission spectrum (UPS) (Fig. S3, ESI†). The value of the HOMO level is calculated to be −5.67 eV. Thus, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy can be estimated from the optical band gap and the HOMO level, which is about −3.70 eV. The values of the energy levels for the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film agree well with those in a previous report.9,29
On the other hand, a gate dielectric plays a vital role in determining device performance in bottom-gate FETs. We explored the surface and dielectric characteristics of the PVA layer modified by a very thin film of CL-PVP, as well as the PVA film for comparison. The dielectric films were prepared by a spin-coating method according to our previous work,40 on which poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) FETs with high overall device performance were fabricated, and their thicknesses were optimized to provide a high capacitance. Firstly, the solvent resistances of the two dielectric films treated with DMF were evaluated. We dropped 2 μL DMF on the surfaces of the PVA/CL-PVP and PVA films, respectively, and then observed the surface changes. Fig. S4 (ESI†) depicts the optical microscope pictures of the film surfaces changing over time until 27 minutes. As expected, almost no changes were observed on the surface of the PVA/CL-PVP film after the solvent evaporation, but traces of the solvent corrosion were found on the surface of the PVA film. The results suggest that the CL-PVP thin film can improve the resistance to DMF due to a decrease in the amount of the hydroxyl groups after the cross-linking reaction, therefore enabling the PVA/CL-PVP film to act as a gate dielectric layer in bottom-gate perovskite FETs.
The surface morphology of a gate dielectric layer in bottom-gate FETs can affect the morphology and crystallinity of a semiconductor film and the number of trap states41 at the semiconductor/dielectric interface. To assess the importance of the modification by the CL-PVP layer, the AFM height images of the PVA and PVA/CL-PVP film surfaces before and after the DMF treatment are exemplified in Fig. 2(a–d), and the values of the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness are estimated and listed in Table 1. The surfaces of the two pristine films (Fig. 2(a) and (c)) are smooth and uniform. Nevertheless, the roughness of the PVA film greatly increases from 0.340 to 2.826 nm after being treated with DMF, whereas that of the PVA/CL-PVP films slightly changes from 0.326 to 0.595 nm, proving that CL-PVP modification can improve the resistance against DMF. The changes in the RMS roughness obviously show a similar trend to those of the optical microscope images displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). We thus draw a conclusion that the CL-PVP film can effectively overcome the solvent corrosion problem and offer a smooth surface for spin-coated perovskite films with good morphology and crystallinity, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport41 in conducting channels.

Surface polarity and surface energy of a dielectric are also widely recognized as important interfacial factors41 influencing charge carrier transport. To evaluate the surface polarity, the water contact angles of the PVA and PVA/CL-PVP films were measured, which are displayed in Fig. 2(e) and (g). The water contact angle of the PVA/CL-PVP film is 56.55°, much larger than that (32.34°) of the PVA film, revealing that the CL-PVP film is less polar owing to the reduced number of hydroxyl groups due to cross-linking. Consequently, the decrease in the polar groups on the dielectric surface that function as charge traps will lead to low threshold voltage and reduced hysteresis behavior in FETs.42,43 Meanwhile, charge trapping due to the dipolar disorder originating from high polarity44,45 can be reduced at the less polar CL-PVP surface, favoring efficient charge carrier transport. Moreover, we calculated the values for the surface energy based on the water and diiodomethane (CH2I2) contact angles (Fig. 2(f) and (h)), which are believed to disturb the growth and morphology of semiconductor films.31,46 The surface energies of the PVA/CL-PVP and PVA films are 49.07 and 63.21 mJ m−2, respectively. The contact angles and surface energies of the two films are also summarized in Table 1. Fig. S5(a) and (b) (ESI†) illustrate the top-view SEM images of the (PEA)2SnI4 films spin coated on the PVA and PVA/CL-PVP dielectric layers. The (PEA)2SnI4 film on the CL-PVP surface displays a homogeneous surface morphology and irregular curves, revealing the formation of a 2D layered structure, quite similar to the one on the ITO-glass substrate in Fig. S2 (ESI†), whereas the perovskite film on the PVA film exhibits a worse morphology with holes and cracks. As a result, the CL-PVP film modification is a guarantee of a high-quality dielectric surface with low roughness and polarity as well as reduced surface energy for the formation of perovskite thin films with improved morphology and crystallinity.
To compare the dielectric properties of the PVA and PVA/CL-PVP films sandwiched between the ITO and Au electrodes with an effective area of 0.01 cm2, the optimal thicknesses of the two films are estimated from their cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S5(c) and (d) (ESI†). The dielectric films are about 360 nm and 390 nm thick, respectively, and the CL-PVP layer is found to be around 30 nm. The curves of the leakage current density and capacitance per unit area versus the voltage (J–V and C–V) are illustrated in Fig. 2(i) and (j). It can be seen that modification of the CL-PVP film lowers the leakage current density to 10−7 A cm−2 by two orders of magnitude at the voltage range from −40 to 40 V, which will contribute to a low operating voltage and high channel current in a transistor. Besides the thickness difference of the films, it is obvious that the CL-PVP layer plays an important role in decreasing the leakage current density. Furthermore, the relative dielectric constants of 5.04 for the PVA film and 4.98 for the PVA/CL-PVP film are derived from the C–V curves in Fig. 2(j) based on the assumption of a parallel-plate capacitor. This difference in the dielectric constant is negligible, which suggests that modification by the CL-PVP layer has almost no effect on the dielectric property of the PVA film. The capacitance of the PVA/CL-PVP film is 11.3 nF cm−2, only slightly smaller than that (12.4 nF cm−2) of the PVA film, which is high enough to induce sufficient charges in a transistor channel. The surface and dielectric parameters of the PVA and PVA/CL-PVP layers are summarized in Table 1. In a word, the PVA layer modified by the CL-PVP thin film can offer perovskites a high quality surface with good dielectric properties for efficient field-effect conduction.
Herein, we employed the PVA/CL-PVP film as a gate dielectric layer and the 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 film as an active layer to fabricate FETs in a geometry of ITO(Gate)/PVA/CL-PVP/(PEA)2SnI4/Au(source/drain) as shown in Fig. 3(a) (see ESI† for experimental details). It should be mentioned that we had made attempts to construct (PEA)2SnI4 FETs on the PVA layer, but have been unable to obtain working devices because of solvent corrosion. The top-view SEM image of the transistor in the inset of Fig. 3(a) displays that the channel is 50 μm long and 1000 μm wide. Gold was selected as the source and drain electrodes because its work function (−5.10 eV) matches the HOMO level of the perovskite film, as the energy level diagram depicts in the inset of Fig. S6(a) (ESI†). In order to further explore the nature of the contact between the Au electrode and the (PEA)2SnI4 film, we measured the current–voltage characteristics (I–V) of the (PEA)2SnI4 film in a lateral device that was deposited on glass with gold as electrodes, which define a channel length of 50 μm (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). The current varies linearly with the applied voltage at low voltages, demonstrating that the Au-(PEA)2SnI4 contact is an ohmic one and charges can inject effectively from the electrode to the active layer. Moreover, we fabricated a vertical device with the (PEA)2SnI4 film sandwiched between gold and the ITO (Fig. S6(b), ESI†) to probe the vertical charge carrier transport. The J–V curve also exhibits good linearity and the current density is over 10−1 A cm−2 in the voltage range from −1 to 1 V, which suggests that the conductivity of the 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 film in the vertical direction is high and charge carriers can cross the barriers between the alternating organic and inorganic layers and be transported efficiently from the Au electrodes to the channel at the (PEA)2SnI4/dielectric interface.

Fig. 3b presents the C–V characteristic of the (PEA)2SnI4 FET measured at a frequency of 100 kHz with voltages only applied between the ITO gate electrode and one of the Au electrodes, which apparently constructs a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) capacitor of ITO/PVA/CL-PVP/(PEA)2SnI433,47 with an area of 0.2 cm−2 (see ESI† for Experimental details). It can be seen that the C–V curve displays clear accumulation, transition, and depletion regions as the voltage increases from −40 to 40 V, quite similar to that of an ideal MIS structure,47 which indicates that a p-type channel is formed and the device can work in both accumulation and depletion modes. Generally, the maximum value (Cmax) of the capacitance per unit area for an MIS structure in accumulation represents that (Ci) of the dielectric layer. In our case, the capacitance of the PVA/CL-PVP layer is equal to the maximum capacitance (11.5 nF cm−2) of the MIS capacitor at −40 V, which corresponds fairly well to the value of 11.3 nF cm−2 evaluated from the above-mentioned sandwiched dielectric device in a structure of ITO/PVA/CL-PVP/Au. It should be noted that depletion of the semiconductor occurs ineffectively in the maximum voltage range of the impedance analyzer.
The electrical measurements of the (PEA)2SnI4 FET were performed with the source electrode being connected to the ground and both the gate and drain electrodes being biased negatively. The electrical output characteristics of the device are presented in Fig. 4(a). The gate voltage (Vg) ranged from 40 to −40 V in a step of −10 V as the source–drain voltage (Vd) was swept from 0 to −60 V at a scan rate of 2 V s−1. The output curves show that the device can operate in the accumulation and depletion regimes with a typical p-channel behavior consisting of linear and saturation regions as well, and the source–drain current (Ids) in the channel can be effectively modulated by the gate voltage. The transfer curves plotted in Fig. 4(b) and (c) are the Idsversus Vg at Vd = −40 V, scanning forward from 40 to −40 V and then reverse to 40 V with a step of −0.5 V at the same scan rate. From the plots of  for the transfer characteristics in the saturation regions in Fig. 4(b) and (c), the hole mobilities and the threshold voltages in the forward and reverse scans are calculated and listed in Table 2. The mobilities in the forward and reverse gate voltage sweeps are 0.28 and 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the threshold voltages are 21 and 20 V. These extremely small variations in the performance parameters between the two scans suggest that almost no hysteresis exists in the device. For comparison, previously reported performance parameters for (PEA)2SnI4 FETs9,13,22,23,26,27,29 are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) together with the ones in this work. The performance of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs apparently depends on the device configuration, dielectric material, fabrication method, and channel length and width. It is worth mentioning that the devices in this work can operate in air, while a vacuum or inert atmosphere is required for reliable operation of the devices of other groups. The hole mobilities of the device measured in air at room temperature are close to those of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates,9,13,22,23,29 which vary from 0.62–9.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. When compared with the (PEA)2SnI4 devices with polymer gate dielectrics, the mobility value is moderate, nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the transistor based on P(VDF-TrFE)27 though it is smaller than the record-breaking mobility of the device with Cytop as a dielectric. More importantly, the threshold voltages of our device are much lower than the ones of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs with the record-breaking mobility, whereas no such values were reported for the devices with the P(VDF-TrFE) gate dielectric.

Fig. 4(d) shows the semi-logarithmic plots for the transfer curves in Fig. 4(b) and (c). The on/off current ratios in the forward and reverse scans (6 × 102 and 1 × 103) are extracted and listed in Table 2, which are relatively low, but still comparable with that of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs on the Si/SiO2 substrates of the same channel sizes constructed on Si/SiO2 substrates in the literature.13,29 In addition, the transistors with PVA or PVP as gate dielectrics normally display large hysteresis because the hydroxyl groups at the semiconductor/dielectric interfaces can absorb water molecules or impurities that act as charge trappers.42,43 In our previous work,40 a hysteresis voltage shift of 9 V was observed in the P3HT FETs with similar PVA/CL-PVP bilayer dielectrics. However, interestingly, the hysteresis in the transfer characteristics in this work between the forward and reverse scans can be neglected for it is only 1.5 V as estimated from Fig. 4(d). We believe that the negligible hysteresis can be ascribed to the absence of obvious ion migration in the 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 most probably caused by organic spacing layers9,21 and reduced polar groups at the CL-PVP surface via the cross-linking reaction,48,49 as well as the good compatibility of the perovskite with the polymer gate dielectric. Furthermore, the values of the subthreshold swing (S) under the forward and reverse scans, which is a parameter characterizing the switching speed of a transistor, are derived from the linear fits on the semi-logarithmic plots of the transfer curves in the inset in Fig. 4(d) and listed in Table 2. The S values are very close, 7.1 V decade−1 (V dec−1) in the forward scan and 7.9 V dec−1 in the reverse one, respectively. Compared with the reported values of 0.8∼2.6 V dec−1 for the (PEA)2SnI4 transistors,9 the relatively large S values in this work might be related to the (PEA)2SnI4/dielectric interface as well as the Au-(PEA)2SnI4 contacts,9 but are still in the range of 1–20 V dec−1 for most published OFETs.50
To further evaluate the quality of the (PEA)2SnI4/polymer interface in the transistor, the maximum interface trap density Nmax is calculated by the following expression:51  where k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge, and T is the absolute temperature. The values of  in the forward and reserve scans are estimated to be 9.5 × 1012 and 8.5 × 1012 cm−2 eV−1 and are also listed in Table 2. They are within the range from 1012 to 1014 cm−2 eV−1 as published51 for polymer FETs, which further demonstrates that the (PEA)2SnI4 transistor with PVA modified by CL-PVP as a gate dielectric layer has a good interface.
It is also worth mentioning that we have made twenty (PEA)2SnI4 transistors. The mobility and threshold voltage are averaged with standard deviations and are also listed in Table 2. The distributions of the mobility and threshold voltage yielded by the twenty devices are illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†). More than 65% of the devices have a hole mobility ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which indicates good reproducibility of the bottom-gate (PEA)2SnI4 transistors based on the PVA/CL-PVP dielectric layers.
Lastly, we analyze the effects of the oxidation of Sn2+ on the device performance of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs operating in ambient air, which represents a big concern for 2D tin perovskites for practical applications. Though many studies show that a significant increase in the conductivity in 3D tin perovskites due to the p-type doping arising from the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and the formation of tin vacancies52 is a drawback in photovoltaics,53 there has been no study yet on this issue in 2D tin perovskite FETs. In this work, the room temperature conductivity of the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film along the direction parallel to the substrate surface is estimated to be 5.7 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is smaller than that (2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1) of the (PEA)2SnI4 single crystal54 and four orders of magnitude lower than the one (19–23 S cm−1) of the CH3NH3SnI3 single crystal.55,56 This result indicates that the degree of oxidation of the SnI42− unit in (PEA)2SnI4 is much lower.54 We believe that the operational stability of the device in air in this work is a consequence of the improved morphology and crystallinity of the (PEA)2SnI4 film, most probably because the interactions between the 2-phenylethyl groups in the organic PEA spacer layer and the phenyl groups in the CL-PVP layer can lead to a more closely packed surface and facilitate layer-by-layer self-assembly of the perovskite film.25,57 Apart from the enhanced moisture resistance introduced by the hydrophobicity of the long PEA cation chains,58 the encapsulating PEA layer and the compact high-quality 2D layered (PEA)2SnI4 film can protect Sn2+ from contact with oxygen, suppressing the formation of Sn4+-related defects that induces a self-doping process,59 thus enabling the device to operate stably under ambient conditions. Currently, we are studying the (PEA)2SnI4 transistors based on the PVA layer modified by cross-linked poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) (PVA/CL-PMMA). The preliminary result shows reduced device performance in the devices with PVA/CL-PMMA gate dielectrics. One of the most likely reasons for this is the absence of phenyl groups in PMMA. Further investigation is required to clarify the interactions between the (PEA)2SnI4 perovskite and the dielectric substrates and their influences on the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films, which will be useful for integrating other 2D and 3D perovskites with more polymer dielectrics in a bottom-gate transistor structure.
It is possible that the relatively high conductivity in the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film originating from the oxidized Sn4+ ions and tin vacancies is reflected in the moderate mobility and poor on/off ratio in this work since oxygen attack is unavoidable during device operation. Upon oxidation, the Sn4+-related defects54,60 are created as shallow-level acceptors, which might have a negative effect on charge carrier transport in the (PEA)2SnI4 channel by acting as scattering centers after ionization,47 depending on their concentrations. Also, the self-doped defects cause high carrier concentration; thus, the carrier recombination in the channel is probably severe, as reported for tin triiodide perovskite solar cells.52 Furthermore, the moderate mobility in this work is also ascribed to the different device configurations and gate dielectrics compared with the device having a record-breaking value9 of 15 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, the relatively high off current of the device (>10−7 A) might be caused by the high conductivity61 induced by the relatively high carrier concentration due to the p-type doping in the (PEA)2SnI4 film, leading to the on/off current ratio below 104. The above-mentioned poor depletion of the channel is also associated with the relatively high off current, which makes the device require higher voltages to be driven into the depletion region completely. To further improve the performance of the (PEA)2SnI4 FETs, the suppression of oxidation and the reduction of conductivity in (PEA)2SnI4 by the introduction of additives into the precursor solutions are under investigation.
Conclusions
In summary, the bottom-gate 2D (PEA)2SnI4 FETs have been successfully fabricated with low-cost and commercially available polymers as gate dielectrics. The (PEA)2SnI4 thin films prepared by a one-step solution method have been demonstrated to possess a highly crystalline layered structure that facilitates lateral charge carrier transport. The PVA film modified with a CL-PVP thin film is used as a gate dielectric layer, which exhibits a relatively high capacitance (11.5 nF cm−2) and low leakage current (10−7 A cm−2). Additionally, the CL-PVP film enhances the resistance to the solvent of (PEA)2SnI4 and offers a high-quality dielectric surface with low roughness (0.595 nm) and polarity for the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film. The (PEA)2SnI4 FETs fabricated on the PVA/CL-PVP gate dielectric layers can operate at room temperature in air most likely due to the improved morphology and high crystallinity of the (PEA)2SnI4 film originating from interactions between the 2-phenylethyl groups in the organic PEA spacer layer and the phenyl groups in the CL-PVP layer. The devices present good performance with a hole mobility of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1 and threshold voltage of 21 V in the forward gate voltage scan and 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 and of 20 V in the reverse scan. These extremely small variations in the device performance between the two scans suggest that the hysteresis effect can be neglected, which is attributed to suppressed ion migration in the (PEA)2SnI4 film, the high-quality surface of the PVA/CL-PVP layer and the good compatibility of the perovskite with the polymer gate dielectric. The maximum interface trap densities are estimated to be on the order of 1012 cm−2 eV−1, which further confirms that the CL-PVP-modifying PVA gate layer offers a high quality surface and is highly compatible with the (PEA)2SnI4 thin film. Our work can provide a new path to integrate solution-processed perovskites and polymer dielectrics in a bottom-gate transistor configuration for future applications in solution-based flexible optoelectronics.
