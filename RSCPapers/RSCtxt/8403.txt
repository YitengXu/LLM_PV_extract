    , Accepted 27th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractAcceptor–donor–acceptor structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) are the most efficient electron acceptors used in organic solar cells. We use density functional theory (DFT), its time-dependent version (TD-DFT), and an intra-molecular charge transfer index to evaluate the nature of the excited states of FREAs. Typically, several efficient electronic transitions contribute to the absorption spectra of FREAs. An investigation of every efficient electronic transition of each FREA is performed based on the electronic density variation in the donor and acceptor moieties of the molecules upon absorbing solar photons. Not all these transitions are equivalent for light-to-electricity conversion. The first transition contributes the most to the absorption spectra. This transition is intense and extremely efficient for light-to-electricity conversion, giving a higher value of intra-molecular charge transfer. For certain effective transitions of FREAs, the phenyl rings in the donor unit behave as the electron-donating units, such as IDT-NTI-2EH, BTCN-M, and MeIC. The foremost finding of the present research work is that the furthermost strong electronic transitions are not essentially the most effective ones for the conversion of sunlight into electricity.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) adopting bulk-heterojunction configurations and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs)1–9 have been a source of passionate innovation since the first non-fullerene devices outperformed the state-of-the-art fullerene devices.10,11 Indeed, non-fullerene OSCs have considerable advantages over their fullerene counterparts, which include easy synthesis, light-weight, flexibility, structure tunability to enhance light absorption and solution processing, and the stability of the device.12–14 In OSCs, the solar energy is harvested by the blend of a donor (D) and acceptor (A) sandwiched between two electrodes. Upon light absorption, both semiconductors are stimulated to electronically excited states. These excited states are responsible for generating excitons and consequently free electrons and holes to be collected by electrodes.11,14–16
Among NFAs, acceptor–donor–acceptor structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have been recognized as the most promising systems. These FREAs provide strong electron accepting properties and low reorganization energy for one-electron reduction.17 These materials are excitonic molecules with higher Coulomb binding energies, resulting in low efficiency of the final device when compared with inorganic semiconductors. In OSCs, the offset in ionization potential (IP) at a bulk heterojunction A:D interface is required to be large enough to convert an exciton into a charge transfer (CT) state. Fullerenes are advantageous because of their much larger IP offsets relative to those of FREAs. FREAs are the lower bandgap materials in their A:D blends, helping to absorb the photons in the UV, visible, and NIR regions, while the fullerenes are always the wider bandgap components. As recently reported, the high refractive indices and extinction coefficients of FREAs have many important implications, such as strong NIR absorption in blends, enhanced optical cavity effects, and lower exciton binding energies.18–20 Multiple FREA devices have shown lower energy losses as given by considerably more ordered systems such as inorganic semiconductors and perovskites. Due to increased NIR solar harvesting, FREAs deliver higher open circuit voltage compared with fullerenes. FREAs require discerning pairing with a suitable D component, while fullerenes have universal compatibility with donor polymers.
Incredible improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been made owing to the modification of FREA structures to attain intensified sunlight absorption and tunable energy levels,21–23 where PCEs of over 18% have been reported in the last few years.24–26 There is substantially more space for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of these materials using three molecular design strategies: (i) modifying the central fused core, (ii) matching the accepting end, and (iii) side-chain engineering. Despite the prodigious efforts made to advance OSCs, their performance still remains inferior to that of inorganic semiconductor devices. This is one of the reasons that great attempts are being vigorously made to advance OSCs.11 Therefore, theoretically exploring the nature of the excited states of FREAs may be beneficial for understanding their molecular design for further advances.
The first fundamental stage included in OSC operation is the effective absorption of sunlight by the active layer, accomplished by the existence of several electronic transitions of D and A molecules in the visible domain. Not all these transitions, however, lead equally to the final performance of the cell. Indeed, only those that make the best additions of the excited electrons and holes to the electrodes are the most significant, corresponding in fact to the charge transfer (CT) excited states. These excitations include a major reorganization of the electron density of the molecules following excitation, revealing a depletion of density on the D core and an enhancement on the A ends. The CT excitations are proficiently used in light conversion because they have usually long lifetimes to promote the spatial separation of holes and electrons, thus enabling a wider time window for the holes and electrons to reach the corresponding electrodes.
The understanding of the nature of excited-state transitions arising in the visible region of the solar spectrum is, thus, of significance in order to determine the most relevant transitions for the final device efficiency. Theoretical simulation offers considerable savings of resources and time in the design and fine-tuning of the optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic materials for optimized efficiency in optoelectronic devices compared to the typical experimental trial and error method. We herein evaluate the excited states of 12 representative FREAs to obtain an in-depth understanding of their nature. For this objective, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent version (TD-DFT) to evaluate the intramolecular charge transfer (qCT) in push–pull molecules.27,28 DFT and TD-DFT are the most commonly used tools to study the excited states of OSC materials. The structures of all the FREAs studied in this work are presented in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the 12 FREAs studied in this work. 
The benchmark set consists of compounds representing major forms of FREAs in which the D core comprises 3 to 10 fused rings (Fig. 1). IDTIDT-IC,29 IDTIDSe-IC,30 IDSe-T-IC,31 ITTIC,32 and BTCN-M33 have 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as their A groups. The IC unit has been demonstrated as an efficient electron-accepting end group that produces a strong electron intramolecular push–pull effect. The robust intramolecular push–pull effect results in a narrow energy gap. The FREAs also undergo efficient π–π stacking and thus improve the electron transportation in the active layer. IDTIDT-IC, IDTIDSe-IC, IDSe-T-IC, ITTIC, and BTCN-M have indacenodithiopheno-indacenodithiophene (IDTIDT), indacenodithiophene indacenodiselenophene (IDTIDSe), indacenodiselenophene (IDSe), indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT), and benzodithiophene (BT) as their D cores, respectively. Both the IDTIDT and IDTIDSe cores contain fused 10-heterocyclic rings, and they are the largest D moieties considered in this study. O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR have benzothiadiazole-flanked rhodanine end units and indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the D core with different side chains.34 MeIC,35 CBM,36 and FBR37 have D units of IDTT, carbazole (CB) and fluorene, respectively, whereas both IDNTI-2EH38 and A239 have IDT as the D core.
The nature of the excited-state transitions of the mentioned FREAs will be evaluated using TD-DFT and qCT based on the difference of electronic density between the ground and the excited states of interest. The term qCT stands for the moved charge amount. It is calculated by integrating Δρ over the field of electron density depletion, which is equivalent to the integration over the area of increased electron density. The primary goal of this research is to demonstrate how the electronic variance density and the obtained qCT can be used to guide the design of new FREAs for OSCs with the same approach adopted in developing new organic dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells.40–42
In this work, we systematically evaluate the excited states of 12 FREAs employing TD-DFT and the intramolecular charge transfer index. Before the evaluation of the nature of the excited states, we first assess the performance of TD-DFT by applying a series of functionals (from GGA to GHs and RSHs) in order to assess the performance of the methods. The first 10 excited states of all molecules are computed in solution using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach, and the substantial states contributing to the absorption spectra are determined for those molecules. We constructed our benchmark set to include representations of most FREA molecules ranging from 3 to 10-heterocyclic D cores with numerous forms of A units. Most of the selected molecules are based on IDT as a D core, as it is the representative donor core for A–D–A type FREAs and boasts a coplanar and rigid structure for efficient charge transfer. The D core of IDTIDT-IC is obtained by fusing two IDT units in order to provide more fused rings for sufficient electronic density to transfer from the D to the A unit of the molecule. These molecules were chosen to reveal the nature of charge transfer from the fused IDTs to the end units. Applying the design strategy (i) mentioned above, one of the sulfur atoms in the D core is replaced by selenium (Se). This is an effective strategy to provide looser electrons for efficient transfer by enhancing the orbital overlap with adjacent units. Therefore, IDSe-T-IC and IDTIDSe-IC were selected to observe this effect theoretically. Most of the FREAs in this study have IC as the electron accepting unit, which produces a strong electron intramolecular push–pull effect. This push–pull effect is the main interest of this study. To complete the representative set of FREAs, we selected some tricyclic molecules such as CBM, FBR, and BTCN-M, which are among the most efficient molecules used in OSCs. More precisely, the nature of the excited states of various forms of these molecules containing a large number of atoms is systematically reported in this article. This may be beneficial in establishing guidelines for developing and exploring novel efficient FREAs for high-performance OSCs.
2. Computational details
We aimed to determine how the electronic density difference and the qCT for excited states can be used to design new FREAs for OSCs. First, to explore the most suitable method for the purpose and the performance of the pure functional along with its range-separated version, we adopted two global hybrids (GHs) and two range-separated hybrids (RSHs) to evaluate all FREAs and compare the simulation data with experimental ones. The pure density approach and its long-range corrected version were Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)43 and LC-PBE, respectively.44 The GHs were B3LYP45 and PBE0,46 having 20% and 25% Hartree Fock-like exact-exchange, respectively. The RSHs were LC-ωPBE by Vydrov and Scuseria47 and CAM-B3LYP by Handy.48 The values of the range separation parameter in CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE were 0.33 and 0.4 bohr−1, respectively. The qCT value was calculated from the density difference between the ground and excited states for all efficient transitions using the approach developed by Le Bahers27 for push–pull molecules. All the DFT and TD-DFT simulations were accomplished with Gaussian 09 software.49 To reduce the simulation time of the molecular geometry optimization process, we replaced all the long alkyl chains of the FREAs with methyl groups, which is a generally used method that has no effect on the absorption properties of OSC materials.50,51 The vibrational frequencies for all optimized structures were checked to confirm that no imaginary frequency existed. The chemical geometries at the ground state were optimized using PBE0 with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The 6-31G(d,p) is a double-ζ basis set that contains one polarization function on heavy atoms and one on hydrogen atom. This basis set has been found to provide coherent electronic patterns for OSCs between theoretically predicted and experimental results.50,52,53 For organic molecules, the PBE0 functional has been credited with producing improved ground-state molecular structures.54–56 The molecular geometry optimization and the excited-state calculations were performed in the same chloroform solvent as in the experiments. For the excited-state calculations of OPV materials, the PCM57 is generally employed to account for solvent effects.51 As a result, the PCM technique was used to account for solvent effects in order to provide reasonable TD-DFT results for the FREAs. The standard non-equilibrium protocol, particularly developed for excited state calculations in the TD-DFT framework, was designated.58–62
3. Results and discussion
A detailed performance evaluation of all six functionals for the excited states of all 12 FREAs was performed, and the corresponding results and discussion are presented in Sections S1 and S2 of the ESI.† The computed vertical excitation energy (Ever-absorb) data of the first excited state for the benchmark set of 12 different FREAs are reported in Table S1 (see the ESI†). To assess the quantitative accuracy of the functionals for mimicking the experimental excitation energy (λmax), we computed the correlation (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean signed error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMS), and maximum deviation (MAX). All the statistical results for the non-corrected computed data are given in Table S2 and plotted in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Finally, to find an optimum computational method, simple linear regression analysis of the TD-DFT data was performed, and the results are shown in Table S4 and plotted in Fig. S1–S3 (see the ESI†). The results obtained through TD-DFT computations in solution are more accurate and systematic than those calculated in the gas phase when the experimental excitation energies of the samples are measured in solution. The electronic transition from D to A results in separation of charge and a greater dipole moment in the excited state compared to the ground state, which is stabilized via the polar chloroform solvent.63–65 Therefore, all the TD-DFT calculations were only performed in chloroform, as the experimental λmax values measured in the same solvent are available in the reported literature.
3.1. Analysis of the nature of vertical electronic transitions

Table 1 displays the Ever-absorb of the first excited state against the corresponding oscillator strengths (f) computed for the 12 FREAs using all functionals described. For the entire benchmark set of molecules using B3LYP, PBE0, and CAM-B3LYP, the transition energies and respective f values of the first ten excited states are given in Tables S6–S8 (ESI†). Table 2 shows the vertical transition energies for all effective excited states (f > 0.05), the corresponding f values, and the qCT values computed using PBE0. The qCT value is calculated from the difference in electron density (Δρ) in the ground and excited states for a corresponding transition.

Because the Δρ associated with an effective transition of a molecule is obtained from TD-DFT computations, such as the excitation energy, this quantity will also be governed by the exchange–correlation functional used. As a result, the qCT value for each functional is different but consistent, as shown in Table S5 in the ESI.† The Δρ maps for three representative molecules (i.e. IDSe-T-IC, A2, IDT-NTI-2EH) reported in Fig. S4–S6 (ESI†) further confirm that the B3LYP, PBE0, and CAM-B3LYP functionals provide a consistent description of the excited state responsible for the absorption spectrum. Indeed, the tuning of the range-separation parameter in RSHs gives good accuracy to describe the excited states of organic semiconductors. The CAM-B3LYP functional provides excellent accuracy at the default value of the range-separation parameter for all 12 FREAs.66–68 Therefore, we avoided its tuning to save time and computational cost. The nature of each of the computed excited states, based on the Δρ plots obtained using the above three mentioned methods, is entirely identical. This validates the use of the methods for the representation of the vertical excited states of these molecules. The PBE0 functional is the most often used to assess the nature of vertical transitions in OPV materials.42,69 As concluded in Sections S1 and S2 (ESI†) of this study and our reported work for FREAs,70 it also performed the best for the maximum vertical excitation energies. To avoid complexity, we therefore chose PBE0 to choose the most effective vertical transitions (see Table S8, ESI†) and to further assess the nature of these transitions using Δρ maps for all molecules depicted in Fig. 2–5 and Fig. S7–S12 given in the ESI.†

From the examination of the data reported in Table 1, PBE0 shows that the absorption spectra of all molecules are computed to be the results of numerous transitions; the first transition is the strongest (f ≥ 2.27) for all molecules except for CBM, for which the first transition is optically forbidden (f = 0.00). The remaining nine transitions computed were weaker than the first one for all systems, except the second transition for CBM. The second excited state of CBM is the strongest among all of its transitions (f = 1.77 in Table S8 in the ESI†). Indeed, it is clear from the computed f values of all molecules (Tables S6–S8 in the ESI†) that the first excited state is crucial, contributing the most to the absorption spectrum. The Δρ maps for the excited states confirm the directionality of the excited electronic density. The orbitals contributing the most to an effective electronic transition are summarized with their percent contributions in Table S9 (ESI†).
Assessment of the Δρ plots for the first transition of FREAs allowed us to classify it as a CT excitation from D to A. The first transition is thus expected to be extremely efficient for light-to-electricity conversion because it induces an increase of the electron densities near the A groups present on both sides of D, thus enhancing the probability of creation and propagation of holes and electrons in the donor–acceptor aggregate and finally their injection to the device electrodes. More specifically, an electron is gained by the cathode, while the hole is gained by the anode.
The qCT values (Table 2) for the 1st transition of all FREAs allowed us to obtain the relevant charge transfers from D to A. The PBE0 reflects the first transition correctly in the form of the qCT index. All the Δρ plots obtained through PBE0 show the correct directionality for the electron density of all the compounds. The first transition for all FREAs is not only the most efficient in providing charge separation but also the most intense. In other words, the qCT is higher for the most intense transition.
The data obtained for CBM (presented in Table S8, ESI†) illustrate that only three states can be classified as CT states. These are the 2nd (2.23 eV), 6th (3.24 eV), and 7th (3.53 eV) states. Indeed, the f values are greater than 0.05 a.u. for these states only. All these transitions are thus expected to be extremely efficient for light-to-electricity conversion. The remaining transitions are the most unstable, having the smallest f value or an optically forbidden f value equal to 0.
Among the three affective transitions of CBM (Fig. 2), the Δρ maps and qCT values (Table 2) for the 2nd and 7th transitions (Fig. 2b and d) indicate them as CT transitions in which the depletion of electron density (red) is localized on carbazole. For the two described transitions, the electron cloud variation in A and the spacer units on both ends show a decrease (green). Because the electron density varies very little (Fig. 2c), the 6th transition has a very low qCT value (0.386) and cannot be defined as a CT transition. This indicates that a transition having a higher f value may not always give a considerable amount of qCT.
FBR features a fluorene D core flanked by two benzothiadiazole groups on both sides and connected 3-ethylrhodanine as the A ends. The addition of benzothiadiazole extends the conjugation, enhancing the charge transfer and endowing the molecule with electron-deficient character on the outside of the molecule. FBR has six intense transitions (Table 2), more than any other molecule. Indeed, in the visible range, the absorption spectrum of FBR is distinguished by many and usually more intense transitions. The qCT value is small for the 3rd and 6th transitions (Table 2), computed at 2.78 and 2.93 eV, respectively, and these are probably not CT transitions. The remaining four transitions computed at 2.22 (1st), 2.47 (2nd), and 3.26 (8th and 9th) have a large qCT character, allowing us to class them as CT excited states.
A careful study of the density difference plots in Fig. 3 reveals the nature of the excited states. The 1st, 2nd, 8th, and 9th transitions are essentially charge transfers from fluorene to 3-ethylrhodanine. Because of their low energies and high strengths, these donor–acceptor transitions are supposed to be incredibly effective for charge generation. The 3rd and 6th transitions are mainly from benzothiadiazole to 3-ethylrhodanine, and D does not take a very active part in this transfer; thus, these transitions are less effective for the CT process.
The excited-state nature shows that the absorption spectrum of IDSe-T-IC (Table S8, ESI†) is the result of four transitions computed at 1.69, 2.44, 2.61, and 2.94 eV. The 1st and 6th states of IDTIDSe-IC are the most intense and responsible for the UV-Vis spectrum, while the most intense states are the 1st, 6th, and 9th for IDTIDT-IC. The qCT index (Table 2) for these candidates shows higher charge mobility. This is due to the highly planar geometry, which would facilitate the delocalization of π-electrons and hence move towards the strong A moieties. The Δρ plots for IDSe-T-IC and IDTIDSe-IC (Fig. 4) show a greater decrease (red) in the electron density of the D core in comparison to IDTIDT-IC (Fig. S7, ESI†), which is probably due to the selenium atom. The looser and higher outermost electron cloud of selenium atom in IDSe-T-IC and IDTIDSe-IC can enhance the orbital overlap with adjacent units, hence decreasing the band gap and increasing the electron transport, which are the main required properties for FREAs.
Four of the 12 FREAs in the benchmark set (i.e., O-IDTBR, EH-IDTBR, A2 and IDT-NTI-2EH) have the same IDT as the D core. The O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR have the same A, with the alkyl side-chains attached to D differing only slightly. The four long alkyl chains on the D core of O-IDTBR have been substituted with methyl groups to minimize computational time, whereas the 2-ethylhexyl in EH-IDTBER has been preserved. For both O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR, the PBE0 gives four important states (see Table S8, ESI†), with the first one contributing the most to the absorption spectrum.
As can be seen from the experimental and computed data in Table S8 (ESI†), the very slight modification of the D, i.e., the substitution of 2-ethlyhexyl with alkyl chains to go from EH-IDTBR to O-IDTBR, causes no significant shift in the spectra and no considerable change in the computed transitions contributing to the visible spectral region. The higher average short-circuit current of 13.9 mA cm−2 in O-IDTBR on annealing is attributed to its wider external quantum efficiency (EQE) profile, compared to 12.1 mA cm−2 for EH-IDTBR.34 The evaluation of the Δρ plots associated with the most passionate transitions (reported in Fig. S8a–d and S9a–d for O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR, respectively) helps one to find more compelling reasons supporting the PCE gap between O-IDTBR (6.3%) and EH-IDTBR (6.0%)-based OSCs.
All transitions have a clear CT character, thus comprising a density transfer from IDT to 3-ethylrhodanine; the only exemption is characterized by the transition computed at 3.09 and 3.08 eV (Table S8 (ESI†), transition 9 for both) for O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR, respectively. A very limited IDT contribution is calculated for this transition. Contrary to O-IDTBR, in the 6th transition, the two 3-ethylrhodanine units in EH-IDTBR are not correspondent in terms of power conversion efficiency, as only a transfer to one of the 3-ethylrhodanine A units will increase the electronic density upon excitation in the semiconductor aggregate; this supports the transfer of free charge carriers.
For EH-IDTBR, the two most intense transitions (computed at 1.75 and 2.73 eV, respectively) involve a proper and efficient electron transfer from IDT to 3-ethylrhodanine units (Fig. S9a and b, ESI†). The remaining two transitions do not drive the electron density properly from IDT to 3-ethylrhodanine, reducing the probability of charge carriers in the active aggregate from this excited state. The incorrect directionality of the electron transfer density related to the most intense transitions of EH-IDTBR is possibly a relevant factor that may describe the lower performance in solar-light-to-energy conversion of EH-IDTBR compared to O-IDTBR.
A2 and IDT-NTI-2EH are also IDT-based FREAs with different A units. As presented in Table 2, for IDT-NTI-2EH, the PBE0 provides 5 strong transitions computed at 1.69 (1st), 2.53 (2nd), 2.74 (3rd), and 2.83 (4th and 5th, representing degenerate states). The qCT index is highest for the 9th transition and lowest for the 8th transition, which has a value of 0.487 |e−|, making it difficult to classify it as a CT excitation. The rest are CT excitations of various characters, as evident by a simple examination of the associated computed qCT, which ranges from 0.510 to 1.068 |e−| depending on the transition considered (Table 2).
The nature of these CT excitations of IDT-NTI-2EH can be determined by a careful inspection of the Δρ plots (Fig. S10 in ESI†). The 1st, 4th, 5th and 9th transitions in the visible spectrum (at 1.69, 2.53, 2.74, 2.83 eV in Table 2, respectively) are effectively driving the photo-induced electron transfer from the IDT core to naphtho[2,3-b]thiophene diimide (NTI, Fig. S10a–c and e in ESI†) for IDT-NDI-2EH. Because of their low energies and high strengths, these CT transitions are supposed to be especially effective for charge transport. These excited states are thus described by qCT. The phenyl rings of IDT behave as the electron-donating units in the 9th transition. The 8th transition, on the other hand, computed at 2.83 eV, reveals a very slight electron density accumulation on NTI, indicating that it is not a CT excited state.
The thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole (BTT) unit in A2 functions as a π-bridge to connect an IDT as the central D core and 2-(1,1-dicyanootcyl)rhodamine as the terminal group. The fusion of an aromatic thiophene ring onto the BT unit not only extends the conjugation length but also stabilizes the quinoid conjugation scheme, which greatly enhances the CT effect. The CT effect is also improved by the addition of an electron-withdrawing ester group to the fused thiophene ring because a strong electron-withdrawing malononitrile group in the 2-(1,1-dicyanootcyl)rhodamine unit reinforces the CT and stabilizes the quinoid structure.
The absorption spectrum of A2 is composed of four strong transitions, and it is characterized by an intense transition at 1.66 eV along with a less intense transition at 2.64 eV, as presented in Table 2. The qCT value for the 4th transition is the lowest of all, and it cannot play a crucial role in the generation of free charges. This may be explained by the fact that the D unit is inactive in density transfer, and the transfer only occurs between the π-bridge and A, as shown in Fig. S11b (ESI†). According to the interpretation of the Δρ plots (Fig. S11a–c in ESI†), the 1st, 5th, and 6th transitions appear to be the most effective for hole and electron creation. They pair large qCT values with a significant improvement in the electronic density on the terminal groups of 2-(1,1-dicyanootcyl)rhodamine. By increasing the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor materials of the active film, we could enhance the kinetics of electron and hole injection and propagation in the active aggregate.
In BTCN-M, the core electron-rich unit is 4,8-bis thiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT-T), and the electron-deficient IC end groups are connected to BDT-T by thiophene. In comparison to A2, all four transitions that give rise to the BTCN-M absorption spectrum in the visible region are usually very strong (f greater than 0.2 a.u., Table 2), with the most intense one occurring at 1.82 eV.
Inspection of the measured electronic variance density plots associated with all visible-range transitions (Fig. S12 in ESI†) reveals nearly uniform behavior. In each transition, the phenyl rings have donor behavior, which is particularly noticeable in the 3rd and 8th transitions. Table 2 reveals that all of the transitions have a strong qCT quantity, causing them to be labeled as CT excited states.
MeIC and ITTIC have the same IDTT core but different end groups, i.e., IC for ITTIC and the methylated thiophene-fused ending group (CPTCN) for MeIC. In ITTIC, IC and the D core are bound with a thiophene ring. PBE0 gives the two most intense states for Me-IC (Table S8 in ESI†), while it yields the 5 most dominant transitions for ITTIC. The top panel of Fig. 5 shows that the electron density shifts from the IDTT backbone to CPTCN in MeIC, but the phenyl rings are not involved in the first transition. When comparing the phenyl rings to the backbone of D, the plots of the 6th and 7th transitions reveal that the phenyl rings contribute the most to the excitation process. In these transitions, we can assume that the phenyl rings play the role of D. The fused thiophene rings and CN-group in methylated CPTCN act as electron-accepting regions but the methyl group (a weak electron-donating group) does not, justifying the fact that the insertion of methyl will not lead to bulky 3D conformation.35 From the Δρ maps given in Fig. 5 and the data in Table 2 for MeIC, all of these transitions can be labeled as CT. Three of the six ITTIC transitions have nearly identical plots (see Fig. 5 bottom panel) and a strong CT character (Table 2). The CT character and density variations show that the 5th and 7th transitions are less relevant for charge transfer from D to A.
Finally, it is necessary to mention that the final performance of the device is not only affected by the light absorption and excited-state nature of the acceptor and donor materials. There are numerous other essential key factors which also affect the OSC efficiency, such as charge transport, recombination, collection, and voltage loss. The morphology of the active film in an OSC is fundamentally linked to the free charge transport, recombination, and collection at a suitable work function electrode. Interpenetrating neat phases are prerequisites for efficient transport. The larger offsets between the IPs of donor and acceptor materials cause a considerable voltage loss in the system, which reduces the maximum achievable photo-voltage versus the thermodynamic radiative limit71 defined by the optical bandgap of the system.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we analyze the excited-state transitions that occur in the UV-visible absorption spectra of 12 fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and a theoretical intra-molecular charge transfer index based on the electronic density variation upon light absorption is used to describe the efficiency and nature of the electronic transitions for the generation of free charge carriers in the active layers of OSCs.
The results show that the absorption spectra of all FREAs are the result of numerous transitions, with the first one usually contributing the most. Hence, the first transition must be intense and extremely efficient for light-to-electricity conversion, giving a higher value of charge transfer from the electron donor (D) unit to the acceptor (A) unit of the molecule.
The study of the electronic density variations in the electron acceptor and donor units of a molecule in an excited state associated with each of the effective electronic transitions enables us to show how the existence of a charge transfer excitation does not essentially indicate its efficiency in the generation of free charge carriers. In particular, the directionality of the charge transfer must be carefully guided from the D towards the A unit to avoid an inefficient role of the donor, as in the case of the 4th transition of A2, the 7th transition of ITTIC and some transitions of O-IDTBR. For certain effective transitions of FREAs, the phenyl rings in the D unit behave as the electron-donating units, such as those of IDT-NTI-2EH, BTCN-M, and MeIC.
More generally, the use of intra-molecular charge transfer index-based electronic density variation in combination with TD-DFT is a comparatively inexpensive but powerful tool that enables the examination of the efficiency and nature of electronic transitions of large FREAs with potential application in OSCs.
