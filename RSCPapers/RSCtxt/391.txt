    , Accepted 16th April 2020First published on 13th May 2020AbstractElectrocatalysts featuring high activity, selectivity and stability are urgently needed in solar-electricity powered energy-conversion technologies. In the past decade, various electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be electrocatalytically active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite the significant progress, catalyst discovery is still dominated by “trial-and-error” practice due to the lack of understanding of the origin of electrocatalytic activity, active site structures and key factors determining the operando electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, this critical review focuses on summarizing effective catalyst activation strategies to enable efficient catalyst discovery, on the basis of understanding real active sites for the HER and OER. Meanwhile, theory prediction and operando characterization techniques have also been introduced to identify the origin of electrocatalytic activity and active site structures. Moreover, catalyst atomic structure reconstruction/rearrangement under working conditions and the accompanying catalyst activation strategies have been discussed to address the negative impacts of reaction media. Finally, a brief perspective on the challenges and future directions for predicting, characterizing and understanding operando active sites to discover efficient activation strategies will also be presented.Peng Fei LiuPeng Fei Liu received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the East China University of Science and Technology in 2013 and 2018, respectively.

1. Introduction
The expansion of renewable energy technologies, especially combined with intermittent solar and wind power generated renewable electricity, will significantly ease the energy demand pressure and associated environmental issues.1–5 Among the reported technologies, the production of molecular hydrogen from cheap and plentiful water electrolytic technology has been widely regarded as a promising technology due to its high efficiency and simple conversion process that can be powered by electricity generated from renewable energy sources.6–8 For these reasons, noticeable recent effort has been devoted to developing high performance electrocatalysis systems such as integrating photovoltaic (PV) modules with water electrolyzers to construct solar-to-fuel conversion devices.8–17 Although the total conversion efficiency of PV-electrolysis systems is dependent on the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the PV module, the electrocatalysis process has a strong impact on the cost, purity (selectivity) and productivity of target chemicals or fuels. In this regard, high performance electrocatalysts can play a vital role in lowering the electricity consumption required to drive essential electrochemical reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in different electrolytes. For example, efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes are urgently required for alkaline or chlor-alkali electrolyzers,18,19 and low-cost OER electrocatalysts with high stability in acidic electrolytes are essential for proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based electrolyzers.20,21 Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts possessing high activity, selectivity and stability will expectedly advance the large-scale applications of electrolysis-related technologies.
A high performance electrocatalyst is paramount for electrocatalysis and an effective catalyst activation strategy is the key for the discovery of new electrocatalysts.22 However, the catalytic activity origin of electrocatalysts is often unclear due to the frequent lack of deep insights into the catalytic reaction mechanism involving operando active site structures. As a result, the synthesis of electrocatalysts has been heavily relied on “trial-and-error” approaches that greatly restrain the discovery of new catalytically active structures.2,23–26 The recent realization of deficiencies of “trial-and-error” approaches has triggered rethinking of catalyst design strategies, leading to a new catalyst discovery regime that collectively utilizes computation-based theoretical prediction combined with sophisticated operando characterization results and experimental observations to determine the catalytic activity origin and active catalyst structures.27–29
Currently, the reported high performance electrocatalysts are often characterized to relate their structural characteristics with catalytic activities toward target reactions.30–32 In recent years, computational approaches have also been increasingly used to predict catalytically active site structures. In 2009, Nørskov and coworkers systematically reviewed first-principles density functional theory (DFT)-based computational methods for catalyst design and provided a comprehensive summary of theoretical descriptors for various reactions, which could be used to establish relationships between macroscopic kinetics and catalyst active site structures at the atomic scale.27 The descriptors for individual electrocatalysts have been used to predict and evaluate the electrocatalytic performances of important half-reactions such as hydrogen adsorption energy for the HER24,33 and oxygen-intermediate adsorption energy for the OER.34–36 As a result of such developments, it has been proposed that DFT-based computational methods using identified active structures and optimized intermediate adsorption energies can be a powerful tool to facilitate the development of efficient electrocatalyst design and activation strategies.22
Many reported scientific studies have categorically confirmed that the as-synthesized electrocatalyst structures often undergo dynamic structural changes under operando conditions, especially under strong oxidative or reductive conditions in a strongly acidic or basic electrolyte.37,38 In fact, it is these dynamic structural changes that determine a catalyst's activity, selectivity and stability in practical catalysis systems. On this basis, the electrocatalyst design must consider the structural changes induced under the reaction conditions.
A number of excellent review articles on HER and OER electrocatalysts have been published in recent years.19,22,39–42 However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a published comprehensive review on electrocatalyst activation strategies that systematically describes generally applicable catalytically active structure creation methods combined with electrocatalyst structural changes under operando conditions. It has been predicted that new breakthroughs in electrocatalyst discovery will be accelerated by a theory-guided activation strategy combined with insightful knowledge of real active sites at solid/liquid or solid/liquid/gas interfaces under operando conditions. Thus, this review article will centralize electrocatalyst activation strategies for the HER and OER. All the available emerging operando characterization techniques will be considered. For each half-reaction, we begin by introducing theoretical description for predicting active catalytic materials, while simultaneously emphasizing key factors for each half reaction in different operating electrolytes. Meanwhile, we will summarize new research insights into the origin of electrocatalytic activity, intrinsic catalytically active site structures and key descriptors that determine the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, special emphasis will be placed on illustrating the types of atomistic structure arrangements and resultant electronic/energetic changes that could transform a material from being electrocatalytically inactive to active. Notably, the catalyst structural changes under operando conditions will also be reviewed for the new generation of catalyst design. At the same time, the recently developed in situ or operando characterization spectroscopy combined with electrocatalytic analysis will be introduced to help understand and evidence real active sites (Fig. 1). We envisage that new breakthroughs in catalyst discoveries will be emerged from newly identified catalytically active site structures under operando conditions, thereby helping advancing electrolysis technologies with activated electrocatalytic materials featuring high efficiency, robust stability, high selectivity and low cost.

2. Descriptor-based approach for the discovery and activation of electrocatalysts
2.1 HER descriptors
The HER is an important electrochemical reaction that has been subjected to extensive studies since 1905.43 Although the HER is one of the simplest electrochemical reactions, it still involves multiple electron transfer steps that depend strongly on the reaction media and electrocatalysts.44 In acidic media, the HER proceeds through the following elementary step (* means the HER active site):
Volmer step: H+ + e− + * → H*
Heyrovsky step: H+ + e− + H* → H2 + *
Tafel step: 2H* → H2 + 2*
In alkaline media, an additional water dissociation step to generate protons should be taken into consideration, and the Volmer step and Heyrovsky step should be redescribed as follows:
Volmer step: H2O + e− + * → H* + OH−
Heyrovsky step: H2O + e− + H* → H2 + OH− + *
In acidic media, highly active and durable HER electrocatalysts are essential for large-scale hydrogen production using efficient PEM-based electrolyzers.6,20,21 In an attempt to establish efficient nonprecious catalyst design and activation strategies, enormous efforts have been made in recent years to associate essential material properties with HER catalytic activities. In this respect, a volcano-plot approach proposed by S. Trasatti has been widely adopted to guide the rational design and screening of potential HER electrocatalysts.45 This approach correlates HER catalytic activities with descriptors derived from materials' physical, chemical, structural and thermodynamic properties such as the electron work-function,46 atomic number,47 crystal structure,48 melting point,49 bulk modulus49 and hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH).24,33 Among these descriptors, ΔGH has been identified as the most critical descriptor in determining HER activity, with the free energy diagrams proceeding through a single HER intermediate (H*, Fig. 2a). For example, the HER volcano-plot can be further established by correlating the exchange current density of a HER electrocatalyst with its hydrogen–metal bond strength.24,33 This type of volcano plot reveals the relationship between the maximum HER catalytic activity and specific catalytic surface characteristics with optimal hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) that complies with the Sabatier principle, which is regarded as a general explanatory paradigm in heterogeneous catalysis.50,51 In 2005, Nørskov's group used DFT to identify that the materials with ΔGH close to zero feature an optimum HER performance and found computationally that MoS2 compounds meet the criterion.52 Their results suggested that nanoparticulate MoS2 would be an active HER candidate while its bulk form shows poor HER activity, which was proved by Jaramillo and coworkers,30 showing that the HER tends to occur on the edge sites rather than the basal planes. Furthermore, their experimental results based on membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also demonstrated that nanoparticulate MoS2 is an ideal material for the HER with an overpotential in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 V. Besides this theory-guided-design example, the reported results to date have demonstrated the effectiveness of the above-mentioned descriptor-based strategies over the traditional “trial-and-error” approaches. Recent studies also indicate that the efficiency of catalyst design and development can be further improved when the binding energies of reactive intermediates at the catalyst surface and the electron and mass transfer properties of the catalyst are collectively considered to synergistically modify the HER activity descriptors.53,54

In a basic electrolyte, water generally acts as the proton donor due to the lack of protons. The O–H bond in a water molecule (HO–H) is generally stronger than that in hydrated protons (H2O–H+), resulting in sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline electrolytes. Although some materials have been developed with better HER activities in alkaline medium than that in acidic medium, water dissociation still plays an important role in alkali HER processes and the activation barrier of water dissociation may have direct influence on the overall HER activity.19,37,55 Based on the experimental results, the alkali HER kinetics is disappointingly sluggish, two to three orders of magnitudes lower than that in acidic electrolytes.56 However, the alkali HER activity can be facilitated by synergistic interface design. By modifying the Pt(111) surface with Pt islands or Ni(OH)2 clusters, the HER activity could be drastically improved, which is ascribed to the increased water dissociation kinetics on the edge sites or the boundaries between two phases (Fig. 2c).3,18 Markovic and colleagues conducted well-designed experiments to show this synergism activation strategy between Pt and a series of 3d metal hydr(oxy)oxide interfaces (Fig. 2c and d).57–59 The HER activity of these hybrid materials exhibited a volcano-like shape, and their activity increased monotonically with decreased OH–M2+δ energetics, among which Ni(OH)2/Pt(111) was the most active and Mn(OH)2/Pt(111) was the least active. Based on the activity trend of Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, they highlighted that a balance must be established between the transition state energies for water dissociation and the final state energies of adsorbed OH-M2+δOδ(OH)2−δ, that is, the best combination among the 3d elements should have the most favorable balance between accelerating water dissociation and avoiding excessively strongly adsorbed OH-M2+δOδ(OH)2−δ, together with optimal Pt–H energetics.
Very recently, Koper and colleagues also provided experimental evidence through laser-induced temperature-jump measurements to support the viewpoint that HBE is not the only descriptor for HER kinetics at Ni(OH)2/Pt interfaces.60 Similarly, Shen et al. have done fundamental work to demonstrate the importance of both adsorbed hydrogen (Had) and hydroxyl (OHad) for the alkali HER, by using bulk Pt surfaces decorating with different Ni(OH)2 as model catalysts.61 Goddard and colleagues further highlighted the role of reorganization of interfacial water during the charge transfer process, the energetics of which depend on how strongly water interacts with the interfacial field.62 Jia and colleagues reported the catalytic roles of hydroxyl-water-alkali metal cation (AM+) adducts in the double-layer region for the alkali HER, with AM+ as a hard Lewis acid which would bind tightly to OH− (a hard Lewis base) but weakly to the adsorbed OHad (a soft Lewis base), which can facilitate the removal of OHad into the bulk due to the unbalanced charge between OH− and OHad.63 The results reveal that the reorganization energy of the interfacial water was larger in alkaline electrolytes than that in acidic ones, because of the strong electric field lying at the electrode/electrolyte interface for OH− transfer, indicating the importance of adsorbed hydroxyl on the catalyst surface. These findings suggest that the surface water structure is an essential factor that influences the pH-dependent HER activity, which should be taken into consideration when activating alkali HER electrocatalysts. Besides Pt-Ni(OH)2 hybrid model catalysts, ABO3 perovskite oxides have also been developed as HER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium by Shao and coworkers, with their tunable electronic structures featuring surface redox chemistry and oxygen deficiency.64 They further proposed a coordination rationale to introduce A-site ionic electronegativity (AIE) as an efficient unifying descriptor, which could effectively modulate the active B-sites of metal valence, metal–oxygen covalency, band gap and oxygen 2p-band position, to predict the HER activities of 13 cobalt-based perovskite oxides.65
Based on the above summaries, the HER activation strategies should not only focus on the optimization of HBE for the catalyst surface sites, but also consider the water dissociation and reorganization energy barriers in different pH electrolytes.
2.2 OER descriptors
Compared to the HER, the OER is a more complex process, involving the transfer of four electrons, coupled with breaking of the O–H bond and generation of the O–O bond, and thus a high overpotential is needed to overcome the kinetic energy barriers.66 Most of the proposed OER mechanisms include the formation of oxygen-containing intermediates, such as hydroxyl and oxygen intermediates.67 In alkaline media, the elementary steps may proceed as follows:OH− + * → HO* + e−HO* + OH− → O* + H2O + e−O* + OH− → HOO* + e−HOO* + OH− → O2 + H2O + e− + *
In acidic electrolytes, the adsorbed hydroxyl is dissociated from water and the elementary steps can be described as follows:H2O + * → HO* + H+ + e−HO* → O* + H+ + e−O* + H2O → HOO* + H+ + e−HOO* → O2 + H+ + e− + *
Besides the above-mentioned insertion mechanisms for the formation of HOO* intermediates, some OER electrocatalysts also proceed through a direct coupling process, with two O* intermediates coupling to generate an oxygen molecule.67,68
Because of the complexity involved in the four-electron transfer process, the OER mechanism has not yet been fully experimentally validated. However, a common consensus is that the oxygen binding energy (OBE) and the adsorption strength of three oxygen-containing intermediates (HO*, O* and HOO*, Fig. 2b) are crucial to the activity of OER electrocatalysts. Kopper pointed out that a general scaling relationship existed between the HO* and HOO* intermediates (ΔGOOH = ΔGOH + 3.2 ± 0.2 eV).36 Therefore, the HO* and O* adsorption energies are often regarded as OER descriptors to assess the activity. Similar to the HER process, a volcano-shaped plot considering the OER performance and the adsorption energies of intermediates (ΔGO–ΔGOH) has been well established.36 In this evaluation system, the atomic sites on the catalytic surface of tremendous metal oxides are studied by DFT calculations. To enhance the intrinsic OER activity, ΔGO–ΔGOH should be optimized closer to the peak of the volcano. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of oxide-based OER electrocatalysts (e.g. rutile, perovskite, spinel, rock salt and bixbyite), the scaling relationship defines the lowest possible theoretical overpotential, and most catalytic materials are burdened by additional overpotential originating from a suboptimal O* binding energy.36 In this regard, breaking the scaling relationship limitation seems significant to further improve the OER activity via stabilization of HOO* intermediates compared to HO*.
At the same time, electronic structures such as the eg orbitals or d-band centers of 3d-transition metals (TMs), which can directly tune the OBE, have also been investigated as single and independent OER activity descriptors. For example, for some specifically structured oxides like perovskite oxides, a volcano-type relationship can be established between OER activity and the filling of eg orbitals in the surface cations of B-site 3d-TMs, which can also serve as a descriptor of OER activity. The optimal activity was reported with eg occupancy close to unity, characterizing the high covalency of the TM–oxygen bond.69,70 A groundbreaking study reported by Shao-Horn and colleagues showed that the intrinsic OER activity exhibits a volcano-like shape with dependence on the occupancy of the 3d electron and an eg symmetry of surface 3d-TM cations in a perovskite oxide, with high covalency of 3d-TM-oxygen bonds, because the eg orbital participates in σ-bonding with a surface-anion adsorbate, the occupancy of which would influence the OBE.69 They suggested that this eg-filling descriptor is fundamentally different from the number of 3d electrons (both eg and t2g), with the σ-bonding eg-orbital overlapping more strongly with the oxygen-related adsorbate than the π-bonding t2g orbital, directly affecting the electron transfer between the surface 3d-TM cations and intermediates. Based on this prediction principle, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) was rationally screened because the surface Co cations of BSCF are mediated in the intermediate spin state with the electronic configuration of Co cations denoted as t52ge∼1.2g. To verify this anticipation, the synthesized BSCF was evaluated to possess higher intrinsic OER electrocatalytic activity than the benchmarked IrOx electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Followed by this, tremendous perovskite oxides, spinel oxides and other 3d-TM-based compounds with tunable local octahedrons as OER electrocatalysts have been fabricated.71–83 For example, Wu and colleagues used a combined hydrogen treatment with high-valence ion substitution strategy to activate perovskite oxides via optimizing the eg electron filling status and simultaneously improving the electrical conductivity.72 They have successfully fabricated a Ca0.9Yb0.1MnO3 electrocatalyst with an optimized eg electron filling degree of 0.81 and revealed that subtle hydrogen treatment-induced oxygen defects in the lattice could modulate the valence state of Mn, leading to the synergistic modulation of both the eg electron filling degree and conductivity.
In addition to the common adsorbate evolution-based OER mechanisms, lattice oxygen can also participate in the OER process, which opens up new possibilities for activating OER activity using a lattice oxygen redox process and non-concentrated proton-electron transfer steps (Fig. 2e).84,85 In the lattice-oxygen participating OER (LOER) process, the p-band centers of oxygen often play a paramount role in assessing the OER activity. Shao-Horn's group used environmental transmission electron microscopy to analyze the OER process of BSCF perovskite oxides.86 They observed dramatic structural oscillations because of O2 gaseous bubble formation and collapse within BSCF particles. Advanced electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data indicated that O2 gas evolved accompanied by structural oscillation, suggesting that H2O interacted with BSCF under e-beam irradiation to generate oxygen. Based on these new findings, they highlighted that the materials with an O 2p-band center closer to the Fermi level are able to promote OER not only on their surface but also in their bulk, attributed to the low oxygen vacancy formation energy, which results in facilitated proton conduction in the oxide lattice. Furthermore, with the help of in situ18O isotope labelling mass spectrometry analysis, Shao-Horn and colleagues directly evidenced that O2 evolution on some highly active oxides can originate from lattice oxygen.84 They emphasized that to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enhance non-concerted proton-electron transfer during the OER, it is critical to increase the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds. Very recently, Wang's group incorporated inactive Zn2+ into a CoOOH electrocatalyst to form Zn0.2Co0.8OOH, which followed an efficient LOER mechanism pathway via two neighbouring oxidized oxygens hybridizing their oxygen holes without sacrificing metal–oxygen hybridization (Fig. 2e). In acidic electrolytes, Grimaud et al. used La2LiIrO6 as a model catalyst and explained that the formation of active surface oxygen atoms which could act as electrophilic centers for water to react further increases the OER performance.87 In this regard, they showed the activation strategy for surface oxygen sites with Ir migration from the bulk to the surface and established a relationship between surface activity and surface stability, which is rooted in the formation of surface reactive oxygen. Pfeifer et al. also reported that the surface of an initially metallic Ir model electrode would convert into a mixed valence state, with a conductive IrOx matrix during the OER, which contains O2− and electrophilic O− species.88 Using in situ X-ray photoemission, they demonstrated a positive correlation between the surface O− concentration and the evolved oxygen, indicating that these electrophilic oxygen sites may be involved in catalyzing the OER. The results mentioned above highlighted the importance of modifying surface oxygen sites as active sites to activate OER electrocatalysts.
All in all, tuning the binding energy of oxygen-containing intermediates via modulating the electronic structures of catalyst surface active sites (metal sites or oxygen sites) is crucial to enhance OER activity in a wide pH range.
3. 
        Operando characterization

Operando characterization techniques have played a crucial role in the development of modern catalysts. In contrast to ex situ characterization techniques which would introduce uncertainties, the desirable operando characterization techniques can enable near-realistic electrochemical testing for the deep and reliable understanding of the structure–property relationship of catalysts. For HER and OER electrocatalysts which would work in strongly acidic or alkaline electrolytes simultaneously accompanied by polarization potentials, these electrocatalysts usually undergo dynamic structural changes, which determine the activity, selectivity and stability in a practical electrolysis system. The realization of such unavoidable impacts of dynamic structural changes on the catalyst performance has stimulated an upsurge in interest to develop operando characterization techniques capable of determining operando structural changes under real operational conditions such as phase transformation, lattice reconstruction and component leaching.89–95
Following this, a group of operando characterization techniques have been recently reported to in situ monitor the surface intermediates or the local structural changes at the atomic or molecular level.96–107 Li and colleagues used in situ Raman techniques to monitor the electrochemical interface reaction process at single crystal surfaces, which could provide an effective path for real-time investigation of the catalytic mechanism;100,102 Wu and colleagues used in situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical measurements to identify the electrocatalytic intermediates, which could further recognize the catalytic mechanism for electrochemical processes;106 Boettcher's group developed an electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) technique to analyze the morphology dynamics and surface electrochemical potential in heterogeneous electrochemical systems under a practical electrolyte solution;99,103 at the same time, in situ or operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques have been widely used to detect the changes of valence states and coordination configurations of the catalytic sites.104 For example, Wei and colleagues have successfully identified the dynamic active-site structure of Co-based single atoms on a phosphorized carbon nitride (Co1/PCN) catalyst using the operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis technique.37 In their work, a home-made cell was used to perform operando XAFS analysis with the catalyst uniformly distributed on porous carbon cloth as the working electrode substantially in contact with the electrolyte, which is important to guarantee that all the Co single atoms particated in the HER could be probed by X-ray, thus obtaining valuable information of the catalyst from its average probing. The operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Co K-edge of the Co1/PCN catalyst revealed that the absorption edge would be shifted to higher energy sites under open-circuit conditions, indicating an increase of the Co oxidation state compared with that in the ex situ environment. The Co oxidation state would further increase in low overpotential regions. Furthermore, the fitted results showed that the Co average valence states increased from +2.02 to +2.20 and +2.40 for Co1/PCN at open-circuit potential and −0.04 V, respectively. At the same time, operando extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy could further reveal the coordination environment of the single Co site, with local Co–O/N peaks shifting from 1.63 to 1.56 Å. These operando XAFS results unambiguously demonstrated the dynamic structural evolution under alkaline HER conditions, with chemical adsorption of the oxo group on the Co single site, which induced the changes of valence states and the coordination environment.
It is envisaged that a further advance in operando characterization techniques would assist us in directly determining the operando active site structures of a wide spectrum of catalysts, enabling the identification of the catalytic activity origin to guide the development of a catalyst activation strategy for new catalyst discoveries. Importantly, advanced operando characterization techniques can also provide essential information on the driving forces that lead to dynamic structural changes under operando conditions, which can be used to guide the design of catalysts with predictable structural changes under reaction conditions into target stable active structures. Moreover, the precise active site structure identified under operando conditions and insightful knowledge on the activity origin will allow the establishment of experimentally evidenced descriptors that enhance computation-based theoretical calculations to accurately predict the catalytic activities. An ability to obtain the operando active site structures and catalytic activity origin will undoubtedly facilitate the development of computation-based theory guided catalyst activation strategies.
4. Activation strategies
The HER and OER activities could be finely tuned by manipulating the local atomic arrangements of electrocatalysts, which might activate the inert materials to their active states. The local atomic structure modification can introduce the changes in the electronic structures of the surface electrocatalytically active sites, which determines the binding energies of the adsorbate intermediates. It is notable that a single new descriptor would be established with electrocatalytic activities based on the newly developed specific local structures–property relationships from the experimental and theoretic results. In this section, local structure modification techniques, such as lattice cutting, heteroatom doping, single-atom site creation, interface and support modulation, crystal phase engineering and amorphous structures construction, will be systematically introduced to depict how they can be subtly used to regulate the HBE or OBE for performance enhancement (Fig. 3). The activation approaches along with typical activated electrocatalysts have been summarized in Table 1.

4.1 Lattice cutting
Lattice cutting is often conducted to create vacancies or unsaturated-coordination metal centers which can modulate the local charge distribution or spin states for active site centers.108 Therefore, lattice cutting accompanied by local atomic arrangements can optimize the HBE and OBE for enhanced electrocatalytic activities. In the meanwhile, a nondestructive modulation process without change in bulk long-range atomic arrangements will also help establish structure–property relationships for HER and OER electrocatalysts, discovering new descriptors to access their electrocatalytic activity. In this regard, nonprecious materials with catalytically inert nature in its pristine form can also be activated via such lattice cutting strategies to manipulate local atomic structures.
Due to the low formation energy, lattice cutting-induced oxygen vacancies have been the most widely investigated anion vacancies to induce catalytic activity for metal oxides.109,110 Recently, pristine HER-inert metal oxides of WO3,111–113 MoO3 (ref. 114) and TiO2 (ref. 115) have been engineered with subtle oxygen vacancies to induce HER activity in acidic media, due to the optimized HBE of active sites and accelerated conductivity. We demonstrated that HER-inert commercial WO3 nanopowder could be activated to highly active WO2.9 by creating abundant ordered oxygen vacancy structures (Magnéli phase) using a facile thermal treatment method (Fig. 4a and b).111 DFT studies confirmed that the HER activity is originated from the modulated oxygen vacancies surrounding the W sites with optimized HBE (Fig. 4c). The resultant WO2.9 possesses a HER overpotential of −70 mV at a current density of −10 mA cm−2, which is 570 mV lower than that of pristine WO3, indicating that the essentially catalytically inert WO3 has been transformed into a high performance HER electrocatalyst (Fig. 4d and e). Zheng et al. reported that the local oxygen vacancies of WO3 could also modulate conductivity and be used as an electron transfer highway, thus activating the acidic HER activity.113 Recently, the creation of disordered oxygen deficiencies by a soft-template synthetic method was applied to activate commercial MoO3 powder as an efficient HER electrocatalyst.114 The created oxygen vacancies are close to the reduced Mo5+ sites in MoO3−x, favoring the adsorption of water molecules that lowers the HER energy barrier and hence accelerates HER kinetics. In addition to oxygen vacancies, sulfur vacancies via lattice cutting have also been extensively studied to boost acidic HER activities. Local sulfur vacancies could effectively modulate the electronic structures of chalcogenide type materials.116–120 Experimentally, Li et al. have demonstrated that besides the well-known HER active edge sites, the sulfur vacancy sites in MoS2 can also be a major class of HER active sites.116 Such sulfur vacancies have been quantitatively correlated with the HER catalytic activity. Unlike the edge sites that are limited by the length of edges, the sulfur vacancies could exist within the MoS2 crystalline structure in high concentrations.116,117,121 Importantly, the sulfur vacancies in MoS2 have been recently confirmed to act as n-type dopants that could increase the density of states at the Fermi level, leading to an increased charge carrier (electron) concentration and optimized HBE.117 What's more, the local cation vacancies via lattice cutting have also been developed to activate pristine inert catalytic materials. However, compared to anion vacancies, creating cation vacancies is more difficult because they require much larger formation energies.40,110 A recent study revealed that introducing cation vacancies can tune the electrochemical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) TM carbides (MXenes).122 For instance, Meshkian et al. fabricated W1.33C-based MXene nanosheets with ordered W divacancies that possessed high HER activity.123 Based on DFT simulated phase stability of various quaternary (W2/3M1/32)2AC phases (M2 = Sc, Y, W; A = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, In, and Sn), they predicted and successfully synthesized two typical stable structures of (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC precursors, in which intralayer Sc/Y cations ordered in the lattice could be selectively leached to create ordered cation divacancies (Fig. 4f–j). Importantly, they highlighted that the unprecedented advantages of such cation divacancies could be used to activate other MXene-based electrocatalysts.

Lattice cutting induced oxygen vacancies with unsaturated metal centers have been regarded as efficient active sites for electrocatalytic water oxidation. These defects can effectively improve the electronic conductivity and simultaneously enhance the electrophilicity of H2O and facilitate the interfacial electron transfer between defective sites and the adsorbed oxygen-containing intermediates.124 2D structure engineering has been the most-studied strategies to construct unsaturated active metal sites with oxygen vacancies. For example, Wei and colleagues fabricated atomically thin γ-CoOOH nanosheets with surface CoO6−x octahedra as OER active sites, which could simultaneously improve the conductivity and optimize the OBE with enhanced OER performance.125 Recently, Wang's group handily used the Ar plasma etching strategy to activate 3d-TM hydroxide-based electrocatalysts with abundant metal and oxygen vacancies as efficient OER active sites.126–128 Besides the reported inorganic electrocatalysts, 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites are emerging as a new class of efficient OER electrocatalysts with highly exposed active molecular metal sites, improved electrical conductivity and hierarchical porosity.90,129,130 Tang's group reported NiCo bimetallic MOF nanosheets as efficient OER catalysts.90 They proposed that the surface metal atoms in ultrathin MOF nanosheets were coordinatively unsaturated and could feature open sites for adsorption. Based on operando XAFS spectra and DFT calculation, they suggested that the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms were the dominating active centers and the coupling effect between Ni and Co metals could effectively tune the electrocatalytic activity. In addition to these 2D electrocatalysts, Hu et al. recently reported core–shell Mn@CoxMn3−xO4 nanoparticles enriched with abundant edge sites and proved that the edge sites with unsaturated coordination featured intense OH− affinity in alkaline electrolytes, thus promoting the OER activity of the catalysts.131 It is worth mentioning that lattice cutting of intentional electrochemical etching can also create local vacancies. Liu et al. revealed that Ni3FeAlx layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets could be in situ activated owing to the low-coordinated Ni and Fe atoms and defects formed by partial etching/dissolution of Al3+ in an alkaline electrolyte.132 Likewise, Song et al. also reported that perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH)6 could be electrochemically etched to form a highly active OER catalyst because of selective dissolution of Sn hydroxides. They proposed that crystal defects of O vacancies play a vital role in the formation of active catalysts.133 Strasser's group reported hole-doped IrNiOx core–shell electrocatalysts with surface Ni leaching (Fig. 5a).134 The operando XAFS results showed that Ni leaching can be generally used to create lattice vacancies and produce uniquely shortened Ir–O ligand bonds with an unusually large number of d-band holes (Fig. 5b and c). Their DFT calculations revealed that the hole formation on the oxygen ligands is in direct proximity to the lattice vacancies. As a result, the enhanced electrophilic character of oxygen ligands create a smaller OER kinetic barrier due to an energetically favourable acid-base O–O bond formation mechanism, involving easy nucleophilic attack of water molecules or hydroxyl ligands on the electrophilic oxygen sites.

Mechanical strains will concomitantly be generated with local lattice cutting.135 Strain engineering of basal planes for 2D electrocatalysts can change the d-band electronic structure to improve intrinsic HER activity.121,136–140 Theoretical studies suggested that the allied tensile strain in WS2 and MoS2 basal planes could considerably enhance the density of states near the Fermi level to fine tune HBE, leading to enhanced HER activity.121,136 Voiry et al. reported the use of the Li intercalation exfoliation method to obtain WS2 with a distorted and strained 1T phase in the superlattice.136 High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) images confirmed the presence of high concentration locally strained bonds in the zigzag chains of the resultant WS2. Their DFT calculations also suggested that the tensile strains can alter the density of states of WS2 to regulate hydrogen adsorption energy. As a new HER activity descriptor, an optimal strain of 2.7% is calculated to achieve zero free energy (ΔGH = 0 eV). Recently, great breakthroughs have been achieved using capillary force induced strains on plasma-treated MoS2 that enables the collective use of the hybrid localized strains and sulfur vacancies (Fig. 6).121,138,141 This approach could readily achieve optimal ΔGH = 0 eV conditions through synergistic modulation of strain intensity and S-vacancy concentrations, which also offered a means to tune the HER activity by simultaneously tuning individual local structures via lattice cutting (Fig. 6b and c).121 At the same time, the lattice distortion caused by lattice mismatch could also induce sustainable strains for the activation of electrocatalytic performances. Qiao and coworkers designed a unique core–shell Ru@IrOx nanoarchitecture to induce charge redistribution and inner strain, resulting in considerable stability and activity enhancement for an acidic OER.142

4.2 Heteroatom doping
Heteroatom doping has become an effective approach to activate inert monophase materials. Both metal and non-metal heteroatom dopants can introduce changes in the local chemical bonds, charge distribution and electron spin status at the doping sites and their surroundings. Experimental and theoretical studies have confirmed that these changes can alter the electronic structures of active sites to possess optimal HER and OER intermediate adsorption energy, hence, endowing the doped materials with enhanced HER or OER activity.143–147 Furthermore, multicomponent electrocatalysts with diverse heteroatom dopants often benefit from synergistic effects with dual or multi-active sites to boost HER and OER activities.19,148
Incorporating heterogeneous elements into a single-component catalyst can synergistically enhance its intrinsic HER activity. For example, the incorporation of 3d-TM cations via doping has been demonstrated to be effective to boost the HER activity of molybdenum sulfides with electron redistribution between dopants and S atoms. Excellent work by Bao's group revealed the optimum doping heteroatoms and doping content for MoS2, with Co-doped MoS2 (16.7 wt%) having the most efficient HER activity (Fig. 7a).149 The doping form and activation mechanism in Co-doped MoS2 were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Evidenced by the EXAFS spectra, the Co atoms were covalently doped into the MoS2 plane rather than being adsorbed on the surface. Their DFT calculations revealed that the HER activity enhancement was originated from the changes in the electron densities on S atoms caused by the doped Co to balance the H adsorption energy (Fig. 7b). In addition to manipulating electron density on S sites, appropriately doped atoms can also engineer the MoS2 band structures to accelerate the HER. Shi et al. incorporated Zn heteroatoms into MoS2 to modulate its electronic structure with a better matched energy level for the HER that enables electron transfer to occur at a much lower applied potential.150 Non-metal element doping can also be used to activate HER catalytic activities. Cabán-Acevedo et al. discovered that a new ternary pyrite compound, CoPS, can be synthesized via P doping to boost HER activity.151 Thereafter, CoPS catalysts with tunable P/S ratios from 0 to 1 have also been fabricated by Wang and coworkers.152 They reported that compared to pure CoS2 with S− ligands, the Co octahedra in CoPS modulated by P2− ligands featured higher electron-donating character than S− ligands, leading to a more thermoneutral ΔGH at Co sites to facilitate the HER. The doped P atoms could also play a role in regulating the anti-bonding  orbitals due to the fewer valence electrons that further strengthen the chemical bonds between Co and P ligands to enhance the chemical stability. In addition, other non-metal elements, such as O, S, N, Se and Cl, have also been used as effective dopants to facilitate HER activity through altering the electronic structures of pristine catalysts with optimized HBE.153–158 Similarly, heteroatom doping has also been implemented to boost the HER activity of metallic alloy-based electrocatalysts.55,159 For example, Bhattacharyya and coworkers synthesized five-fold intertwined AgxNi1−x alloy nanocrystal catalysts, which showed Pt-like activity in the alkaline medium, requiring an overpotential of 24.0 ± 1.2 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, and their DFT results indicated that the ΔGH of Ni sites could be optimized as a function of their proximity to Ag atoms.55

Multimetal alloyed oxides often exhibit superior OER activity to single-component metal oxides, among which NiFe-based oxides have been systematically studied.160 In 1987, Corrigan has demonstrated that Fe impurities in solution would significantly improve the OER activity of Ni(OH)2 films through electrochemical aging treatment.161 On the basis of investigating NiFe alloyed oxide electrocatalysts, a subtle Fe incorporation strategy has been applied to enhance the activity of pure Ni-based catalysts. We demonstrated that blank nickel foam could be easily activated with remarkable OER activity through simple immersion in the acidic Fe(NO3)3 solution at room temperature, because of the in situ formation of NiFe alloyed oxide films.162 In addition to NiFe OER electrocatalysts, other 3d-TM alloyed oxides have also been demonstrated with enhanced OER activities compared to single-TM oxides, such as NiCo-, NiMn-, CoFe- and CoMn-based oxides.124,163–166 Very recently, some ternary 3d-TM oxides have been discovered. For example, Sun and colleagues have fabricated a dendritic electrode with a core–shell NiFeCu metal/metal oxide via dealloying with an electrodeposited NiFeCu alloy precursor.167 The resultant ternary core–shell NiFeCu electrode exhibited pH-dependent OER activity, indicating that non-concerted proton-electron transfer occurred during catalyzing the OER. Various doping approaches have also been systematically explored to activate non-3d-TM alloyed oxides. In 1989, Corrigan et al. prepared binary 9:1 composite hydroxides of Ni with 13 other metals.168 They reported that the co-precipitated Ce, Fe and La significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activities toward the OER, while the co-precipitated Cd, Pb and Zn conversely poison the reaction. Several other elements have been subtly alloyed with 3d-TMs to improve OER activities. Stahl and colleagues demonstrated that Al3+ alloyed spinel NiFeAlO4 could effectively promote OER performance because Al3+ incorporated into the oxide lattice might activate a water molecular for O–O bond formation, and they speculated that trivalent metal ions featured the same promotion characteristics.169 The enhanced OER activity can also be achieved by doping V, Cr and Ce into 3d-TMs.170–179 For example, Jaramillo and colleagues fabricated Ce doped NiO film based OER electrocatalyst and attributed the improved OER activity to the under-coordinated Ni edge sites resulting from Ce doping.173 Very recently, systematic fundamental investigations of activating model spinel oxide OER electrocatalysts via heteroatom doping have been carried out by Xu's group.79–81 According to the lattice oxygen evolution mechanism, the heteroatom dopants could readily activate the 3d-TM-O building blocks due to the finely tuned d-band and p-band centers of 3d-TMs, and oxygen sites by the doping induced electron redistribution between the tetrahedral metal and oxygen or octahedral metal and oxygen (active centers). For example, the OER inactive CoAlO4 spinel oxides could be activated via a Fe substitution strategy, which was revealed to facilitate surface reconstruction to obtain oxidized Co oxyhydroxides under an operando OER process.80 They used operando XAFS analysis to identify that Fe substitution could activate two deprotonation processes in the reconstructed oxyhydroxide layers, which might result in the formation of negatively charged oxygen sites with low OER overpotentials (Fig. 8a and b). Importantly, they also highlighted that the Fe substitution-induced upshift of the O 2p level could promote the generation of surface oxygen vacancies along with the LOER process (Fig. 8c–e). Moreover, the O 2p level would move down as a result of Al3+ leaching to terminate the surface reconstruction, providing a stable surface to allow the operando investigation of the surface active sites.

It is worth noting that heteroatom dopants can also create multiple active sites with desirable synergies to facilitate electrocatalytic activity.180–186 Zhang et al. reported the use of NiCo2Px as efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline and neutral electrolytes.182 They proposed a water dissociation mechanism in which the H–OH bond of water is weakened by the strong interactions between the under-coordinated Ni centers (Niδ+) and O atoms as well as the electrostatic interactions between the dangling P (Pδ−) atom and H atoms. This facilitates water dissociation into a H atom adsorbed on Co sites nearby the P atoms and HO− with the aid of a free electron adsorbed on Ni sites. As a result, the entire OER process is kinetically governed, depending on a delicate balance of the adsorbed H atom recombination and OH− desorption. In addition to metal dopants, the surface dopants of negatively charged elements for HER electrocatalysts have also been demonstrated as an effective means to promote the water dissociation ability and simultaneously activate the nearby metal atoms with optimized HBE. For example, Sun's group reported that a surface N-modified Ni framework could be used as an efficient neutral HER electrocatalyst and such a surface modification strategy could be applied to other metal frameworks including Cu, Fe, Co and NiCo.181 Their DFT studies and experimental results revealed that the electron-rich N atoms on the surface could accelerate the initial water adsorption and subsequently facilitate the dissociation of HO–H bonds with electron-deficient H atoms transferring to N and OH adsorbed on Ni sites and thus enhance the overall HER process. Analogously, subtle C, O or S incorporation can also promote alkali (or neutral) HER activity.93,183,187,188 Qian's group successfully activated MoS2 by carbon incorporation induced orbital orientation that possesses an exceptional alkali HER performance.188 Their theoretical calculations further shed light on the fact that the carbon doping could create empty 2p orbitals, which are vertical to the basal plane, endowing the pristine inert catalytic materials with excellent water adsorption and dissociation ability. Zheng and colleagues have fabricated a Ni-thiolate coordination polymer and demonstrated that it can be in situ activated during an alkali HER process to form ultrathin Ni nanosheets with superior HER catalytic activity.93 Their XAFS analysis indicated that the metallic Ni with Ni–Ni bonds is the active center for the alkali HER and the trace amount of sulfur adsorbed on the Ni surface facilitate water dissociation by forming Sδ−-hydrated cation networks, while for the OER, 3d-TMs having multiple active sites have been widely reported for 3d-TM based multi-metal electrocatalysts, especially for Fe, Co and Ni, which have not been discussed in detail in this section.
4.3 Single-atom site creation
When compared with heterogeneous catalysts, homogenous catalysts feature the advantages of maximized catalyst utilization and variable steric and electronic environments of each active site.189 However, the stability and complexity issues involved in separating catalysts from reaction products are the inherent disadvantages of homogenous catalysts. Recently, the emerging single-atom (SA) catalysts with homogeneously dispersed active sites have bridged homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, providing a new model to understand the nature of catalysis as well as allowing rational design of active sites at the atomic level to achieve maximal catalyst utilization efficiency and utmost mass-catalytic activity.190–193 Due to these attractive advantages, SA HER and OER electrocatalysts have been extensively investigated. The activity of a SA electrocatalyst is determined collectively by the nature of the SA, the supporting substrate and the coordination bonds that anchor the SA to the substrate. A group of synthetic approaches have been developed to create SA sites with superior HER and OER electrocatalytic activities.192,194,195
For HER electrocatalysts, the most reported active SA sites are created by anchoring the SA onto N-doped carbon-based supports via SA–N–C forms of coordination bonds. For example, Sun's group employed the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to fabricate Pt SAs and clusters on N-doped graphene nanosheets.196 The resultant SA electrocatalyst can achieve a HER activity up to 37 times that of the benchmark commercial Pt/C. Their XAFS characterization and DFT calculations indicate that the HER activity is originated from the unoccupied density of states of Pt 5d orbitals due to the unique SA coordination environment. Furthermore, Sun and coworkers developed a microwave assisted reduction approach to synthesize a Pt–SA HER electrocatalyst anchored on aniline-stacked graphene to show that the molecular aniline not only stabilizes Pt–SA electrocatalysts, but also subtly alters the electronic structures with optimized HBE.197 Besides the widely reported bottom-up methods, Wu and coworkers reported a novel top-down approach to synthesize Pt–SA electrocatalysts via bulk metal thermal emitting.198 This approach utilizes the strong Lewis acid–base interactions of Pt atoms with atmospheric NH3 to form volatile Pt(NH3)x species, which can be directly anchored on the defective sites of carbon supports to form atomically dispersed Pt–SA catalysts.198 Besides these noble Pt–SA sites, various non-precious SA metal-based HER electrocatalysts, such as Ni, Co, Mo and W, have also been fabricated using N-doped carbon support substrates.199–203 For instance, Co–SAs supported on N-doped graphene have been successfully fabricated by a facile thermal treatment of graphene oxide (GO) loaded with Co salt under an NH3 atmosphere.199 The Co SAs are anchored to the N-doped graphene via Co–N–C bonds. The resultant Co–SA electrocatalysts demonstrated a HER activity of lowered overpotentials to deliver the current densities of −1 and −10 mA cm−2 at about −70 and −147 mV, respectively, with a very small onset overpotential of −30 mV. The activated neighboring carbons by the anchored SA are one of the important reasons for the superior HER activity achieved by SA electrocatalysts, which has been confirmed by Li's group using Ni–SA and Fe–SA anchored on a graphdiyne (GD) substrate.204 They identified that the neighboring carbons are activated when receiving charges transferred from Ni–SA or Fe–SA. N-coordinated SAs have also been studied as efficient alkali HER electrocatalysts. Wei and coworkers reported a Co–SA electrocatalyst containing uniformly distributed Co–N4 coordination units for an alkali HER.37 Their operando XAFS analysis and DFT calculations identified that the alkaline HER activity is originated from the high-valence HO–Co–N2 sites, where H2O can be favorably adsorbed to the highly positively charged Co–SA, and importantly, the dissociated OH− and H will be respectively adsorbed on Co–SA and the adjacent N sites (Fig. 9). This is because the high-valence HO–Co–N2 can donate more electrons (1.23 e) to the adsorbed OH and nearby N sites when compared with the pristine Co–N4 sites (0.89 e), which resulted in the oxidation states of 2.16 and 2.05 for HO–Co–N2 and Co–N4 sites, respectively. Fig. 9f shows the calculated Volmer step of the H2O dissociation free energy diagram for the high-valence HO–Co–N2 SA centers that optimize the HBE of N sites and facilitate the Volmer step kinetics for the alkali HER. A similar alkali HER mechanism was also proposed by Chen and coworkers using atomically dispersed RuCxNy electrocatalysts.205 The RuC2N2 configuration can achieve the highest alkali HER activity among RuCxNy because the dissociated OH− and H can be favorably adsorbed onto Ru–SA and the adjacent C sites, respectively, to enhance the kinetics of the Volmer step.

Various SA sites have also been rationally designed to create OER activity. It is worth mentioning that the multi-electron involved OER process can be activated on SA electrocatalysts with different active sites for different elemental steps. Huang's group reported a general approach for the fabrication of well-defined SAs with MN4C4 (M = Fe, Co and Ni) configurations.191 Their XAFS analysis and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging indicate that the single metal atoms occupy the di-vacancies of the graphene lattice (Fig. 10). On such a basis, they proposed a dual-site OER mechanism, where the carbon sites participate in the OER process with HO* and O* intermediates that prefer to reside on the carbon sites, while HOO* intermediates tend to adsorb on the metal sites (Fig. 10g and h). They also highlighted that the validity of this dual-site mechanism is dependent on the d electrons (Nd) of 3d-TM centers. FeN4C4 (Nd = 6) and CoN4C4 (Nd = 7) undergo a single-site process in which all oxygen intermediates are adsorbed on metal sites, while NiN4C4 (Nd = 8) undergoes a dual-site process. As a result, they used DFT simulations and electrocatalytic evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of dual-site OER mechanisms where NiN4C4 showed the best OER performance among the selected SA MN4C4 catalysts, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.72 s−1 (Fig. 10i and j). In addition to the N doped carbon substrate to anchor SA sites, layered metal hydroxides are often chosen to stabilize active OER 4d- or 5d-TM SA sites.206–208 Sun's group fabricated Ru SAs anchored on CoFe LDH supports with local Ru–O–3d–TM motifs.207 They used operando XAFS analysis to prove that Ru SA sites should be regarded as operando active sites for the OER process, during which Ru sites underwent reversible changes of valence states while Co and Fe sites showed the irreversibility of the valence states. They also highlighted the support effect of LDH and used DFT simulations to demonstrate the optimized OBE for single Ru sites, especially with a reduced kinetic energy barrier to form HOO* from O* intermediates. Very recently, 5d-TM SA sites have also been proved as active sites to activate OER activity. Ma and coworkers reported single W6+ atom doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as effective OER electrocatalysts.208 The d0 W6+ atoms with low spin-states feature outermost vacant orbitals for hydroxyl adsorption, and DFT calculations proved the facilitated step of the generation of O* and the following O–O coulping step on single W6+ sites.

As summarized above, we conclude that the support effect usually plays an important role in tuning the local coordination or electronic structures of the SA sites or the adjacent atoms, especially using unique substrates, which could provide plentiful and distinct SA metal–nonmetal coordinations.106,209–215 For example, metal compounds with defects can subtly stabilize the SA sites and afford unique coordination environments. Bao's group successfully decorated Pt single atoms on MoS2 nanosheets to enhance HER activity.209 Evidenced by the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM images, Pt single atoms occupy the positions of Mo atoms in the MoS2 planes. The EXAFS characterization and DFT calculations confirmed that Pt single atoms are coordinated with S atoms and can activate the neighboring in-plane S sites with optimized HBE, further enhancing the HER activity. Wang and coworkers used MXene nanosheets which are enriched with exposed basal planes and Mo vacancies in the outer layers to immobilize single Pt atoms with covalent Pt–C bonds, and the resultant positively charged Pt SA sites demonstrated 39.5-fold HER mass activity compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.211 In addition to metal compound supports to stabilize SA sites, metal supports can also provide a unique coordination environment. Li's group isolated Co single atoms into the Ru lattice on a Ru nanosheet substrate (Fig. 11).210 Based on XAFS analysis, they identified the Co–Ru peaks without any signals of Co–O bonds, and the observed that Co–Ru peaks locate at a longer bond length than that of the Co–Co peaks in the Co foil, further demonstrating the monodispersion of Co atoms in Co-substituted Ru nanosheets (Fig. 11c and d). DFT calculations proved that the resultant RuCo1 catalysts with electron redistribution from Co sites to Ru sites show that the atomically dispersed positively charged Co sites are characterized with moderate OH binding energy, which could reach a balance between facilitating water dissociation and preventing the inhibition of the active sites by the high-affinity hydroxides, finally boosting the alkali HER activity (Fig. 11e and f). Wu and coworkers constructed metal alloy-supported Ru1 sites on different PtCu alloys as effective OER electrocatalysts in acidic media.106 They used DFT calculations to reveal that the unique Ptskin shell created a compressive strain to tune the Ru1 electronic structures, allowing optimized OBE and better resistance to over-oxidation of Ru sites, simultaneously improving the OER activity and stability. Very recently, Qiao's group reported nonmetal I SA sites on a Ni substrate as an efficient alkali HER electrocatalyst.215 They showed that this single-atom catalyst can be activated in alkaline media to generate local Ni–I–O motifs, and they used the in situ Raman spectra to evidence the I–Had signals under HER conditions. The synergistic alkali HER activation mechanism was proposed where the water dissociation step has been accelerated with hydrogen adsorbed on I sites and hydroxyl adsorbed on the adjacent Ni atom sites. In addition, nonmetal O single sites have also been consciously introduced into the basal planes of MoS2 single layers as active sites for the HER by Tapasztó and coworkers.216 They demonstrated that single-site oxygen exhibited an optimized ΔGH of + 1.2 eV, lower than that of S sites in the basal plane (+2.2 eV), simultaneously possessing increased electronegativity at the O sites for H+ adsorption in the acid. They also highlighted that the substitutional oxidation process of the MoS2 basal plane offered a general strategy for engineering 2D electrocatalysts with SA nonmetals with a higher active site density than the traditional strategy of individual hetero-atom catalysts. Besides the unique coordination environments, the specific morphology support can also activate the electrocatalytic activity. Song's group handily used onion-like nanospheres of carbon to immobilize Pt single atoms, and their DFT calculations suggested that the high curvature structure leads to the accumulation of electrons around the Pt sites (the so called tip-enhanced local electric field effect), which ultimately promoted the HER kinetics.213

4.4 Interface and support modulation
The interfaces between two active catalytic materials or catalytic materials supported on specific inert substrates can effectively boost intrinsic HER or OER activity. As we know, the interface effect or the support effect will promote the accumulation of active sites or improve the electron transfer ability while introducing a conductive counterpart. The interface effect often exposes the modulated reactive sites as compared to the individual catalyst because of their strong chemical bonding, electronic interactions or synergistic effects.42 The interfaces could also synergistically promote electrocatalytic activity via modulating the binding energy of different adsorbate intermediates. At the same time, the support effect has been widely studied in traditional catalysis fields, like Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction,42 with the underlying substrate or the support contributing to poor activity. However, the strong electronic communication due to the difference of electronegativity between the catalytic materials and the support will thus optimize the HBE or OBE for the catalytic materials. In summary, the strong electronic interactions between catalytic materials and the substrates play a paramount role in activating the water splitting performance.
The interface effect has been widely investigated for the synergistic promotion of the alkali or neutral HER. For instance, combining Pt with Ni(OH)2 can enhance HER activity in alkaline electrolytes, as the Ni(OH)2 sites can promote water dissociation by interacting with the hydroxyl groups and the adsorbed H atoms on Pt sites can subsequently combine to give molecular hydrogen.3,18 To boost the sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline electrolytes, Markovic and colleagues fabricated model single-crystal Pt(111)–Ni(OH)2 hybrids and systematically demonstrated the synergistic effects between Pt and Ni sites (Fig. 12a–d).18 With in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, they suggested that stable Ni(OH)2 clusters exhibited a predominant hydroxide form on the Pt(111) surface, especially in the HER potential region. They endowed Ni(OH)2 clusters with rich defects based on the observation of a prominent pre-edge from 1s → 3d transition, which are particularly active for dissociative adsorption of water molecules (Fig. 12d). Therefore, they proposed the activation process that water adsorption requiring concerted interaction with O atoms of Ni(OH)2 and H atoms with nearby Pt at their boundaries, finally with two adsorbed H atoms recombining to generate H2 and OH− desorbing from Ni(OH)2 followed by another water dissociation cycle. In addition to the synergistic effect, strong electronic interaction also plays an important role in activating the alkali HER. Shi and colleagues revealed that β-Ni(OH)2 is a better water dissociation counterpart of Pt than α-Ni(OH)2 for promoting alkali HER activity, attributed to the stronger interactions between β-Ni(OH)2 with water and Pt.217 They used DFT simulations to demonstrate the high-activity edge sites of β-Ni(OH)2 which promote water dissociation and strong interactions with Pt sites which modulate HBE, compared with α-Ni(OH)2 in which hydroxyl sites would be affected by intercalated water via forming hydrogen bonds (H–O–H⋯O–H). Inspired by the synergistic effect of the Ni(OH)2–Pt interface, similar plentiful and abundant interface sites with functional virtues have been constructed. Hu et al. synthesized two-dimensional (2D) nanohybridization structures of MoS2/NiCo-LDH with MoS2 as an H-acceptor and LDH as an OH acceptor, dramatically facilitating the HER process in alkaline media (Fig. 12e).218 We systematically studied a series of ultrathin 2D hybridized electrocatalysts of 3d-TM hydroxides on monolayer 2D MoS2 or WS2, and showed that the interfacial boundaries could synergistically promote alkali HER activity with water dissociation-produced OH adsorbed on a metal hydroxide and H absorbed on MoS2 or WS2 (Fig. 12f).219 Similar plentiful interfaces were rationally designed to promote HER activity in alkaline media, such as MoS2/Fe5Ni4S8 (Fig. 12g), Ni/CeO2-CNT (Fig. 12h), MoS2/Ni3S2 and Ni/Ni(OH)2/graphite.220–223 Very recently, Sargent and coworkers rationally designed multisite electrocatalysts with Ni and CrOx sites owing to their strong binding energies for hydrogen and hydroxyl groups, respectively, thus accelerating water dissociation, and Cu sites featuring a weak hydrogen binding energy which will promote the hydride coupling process.224 Besides novel interface design, well-tailed nanostructured interfaces have been fabricated to expose high interface active sites, thus achieving superb HER activity compared with bulk counterparts.219,225–228 Yin et al. successfully synthesized ultrathin platinum nanowires grown on single-layered nickel hydroxide (Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH)2), with an effective interaction between Pt nanowires and the Ni(OH)2 substrates to benefit the enhancement of HER catalytic activity.225

KGaA, Weinheim) and (h) Ni/CeO2-CNT220 (Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society) which can synergistically enhance the HER activity in alkaline media. 
Due to the multi-electron involving nature of the OER, the interface effect has also been successfully applied to activate OER activity. Zhang and colleagues fabricated ultrafine and ultrathin NiO nanosheets which were stabilized by TiO2 derived from monolayer NiTi LDH.229 They proposed that oxygen vacancies induced Ti3+ in TiO2 nanosheets could promote the charge transfer process via increasing donor density, meanwhile improving the water adsorption ability at the catalysts/electrolyte interface with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. At the same time, the strong electron interactions that the electron transfer from NiO to TiO2 counterparts made NiO nanosheets more acidic, which would also promote the OH− adsorption, leading to improved OER activity. In the meanwhile, the specific interface could not only lower down the overall energetic barrier for each step of the OER but also result in faster electron spatial separation. Guo and coworkers fabricated Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interfaces and they used DFT to propose that the interface Co and O sites featured a lower catalytic barrier for the OER, and the interface could be seen as a semimetallic heterojunction to facilitate charge spatial separation with an electron–hole-rich agglomerated region, which consequently led to a high current density.230 We also reported that a Ni2P(O)/Fe2P(O) interface could boost OER activity, with active doped oxyhydroxides to optimize the surface OBE.231 To maximize this interface effect, a sufficient contact between two active electrocatalysts should be further taken into consideration. Wang and coworkers rationally designed two-dimensional superlattices of MoS2 and LDH nanosheets for improved water splitting activity.228 On the basis of DFT calculations, they demonstrated a significant electron transfer of 0.45 Å−2 from LDH to MoS2, and the electron redistribution resulted in local electron accumulation at MoS2 edges to improve the H+ affinity and the hole accumulation on the LDH nanosheets for favorable OH− intermediates.
Like the interface effect with strong electronic interactions to optimize HBE or OBE, the support effect with unique substrate materials can also be leveraged to activate the HER and OER. Previous studies indicated that the support effect focuses on perturbing the electronic structures of the active sites, stabilizing the geometric existence of specific active sites or participating in bond formation with the intermediates giving rise to bidentate sites.173 In 2017, Jaramillo and coworkers used [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters with different substrates of Au, Ag, glassy carbon and Cu to study the catalyst–support interactions for activating the HER.232 They found that an appropriate support could subtly tune the HBE of [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters, with [Mo3S13]2−–Au exhibiting the highest HER activity among all the selected substrates. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst–support effect only influences the first few monolayers of a catalyst, because of the diminishing electronic effects as a function of the distance from the support. Therefore, a rational synthesis strategy should focus on enlarging this support-promotion effect. At the same time, favorable support interactions can subtly improve the intrinsic OER catalytic activity and increase the number of active sites of catalytic materials, thus potentially activating the OER performance.233 For example, the applicable support can promote the generation of high-valence metal centers, which will be beneficial for OER enhancement. In 2011, Yeo and Bell reported that cobalt oxide films deposited on Au, Pt, Pd, Cu and Co supports monotonically decreased, paralleling the decreasing electronegativity of the substrate metals.234 They performed in situ Raman spectroscopy and revealed that the Au substrate could effectively increase the population of surface Co4+ as OER active sites. Recently, Jaramillo and colleagues investigated the effects of Au substrates on NiOOH-based OER catalysts, and demonstrated that the enhanced OER activity is attributed to the stronger physical adhesion of catalysts on Au, which could enhance the population of Ni active sites.233 They also reported that Au-supported NiCeOx films feature under-coordinated sites at the catalyst–substrate interface, which could modulate the OER descriptors (Fig. 13).173 Their DFT results systematically demonstrated the promotion effects of Ce doping, Au support modulation and geometry of Ni active sites (Fig. 13c). On the basis of strong catalyst–support interactions, some core–shell structured OER catalysts with strong electronic interaction have also been discovered.235,236 Hou et al. reported Ag@CoxP core–shell-type heterogeneous nanostructures as efficient OER catalysts, and showed that the Ag core facilitated electron-density migration from Co to Ag and thus promoted the formation of Co4+ species due to the proton-coupled conversion of Co3+–OH to Co4+–O during the OER, prior to oxygen generation.236

4.5 Crystal phase engineering
For crystalline electrocatalysts, phase engineering has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to activate HER and OER performance.237,238 For example, engineering materials from the semiconducting phase to the metallic phase can improve electrocatalytic activity due to promoted charge transfer properties by virtue of the metallic features.237 At the same time, phase engineering via self-reconstruction from the inert phase to the active phase under operando electrocatalytic conditions can also enhance the electrocatalytic activity.86 Following this concept, the meticulous structural design of the so-called precatalyst to promote the generation of an active-phase electrocatalyst can also be adopted for the activation of electrocatalysts.
Certain metallic phase materials show superior HER electrocatalytic activities to the same materials of the semiconductor phase because of the dense active sites and excellent electronic conductivity.239–241 For example, to activate the inert 2H MoS2 HER electrocatalyst, traditional phase engineering methods, such as lithium intercalation242,243 and high temperature conversion,244 have been developed to obtain HER-active metallic 1T phase MoS2. In this regard, a great breakthrough has been achieved by Geng and co-workers who successfully synthesized stable pure metallic 1T MoS2.240 The resultant 1T MoS2 is highly stable in water under ambient temperature and possesses a charge transfer resistance of ∼1 Ω that is much lower than that of 2H MoS2 (∼50 Ω). Moreover, the resistivity of 1T MoS2 (0.482 Ω cm) measured by the four-probe method is three orders of magnitude lower than that of 2H MoS2 (7.68 × 104 Ω cm). The improved conductivity is a major contributor to the superior HER activity of 1T phase MoS2. Very recently, Zhang's group discovered a new means for the large-scale fabrication of micrometer sized 1T′ MoX2 (X = S, Se) layer-structured bulk crystals with high purity which possessed high HER catalytic activities (Fig. 14).54 They fabricated an electrochemical microcell with three different working electrodes decorated 1T′ MoS2, 2H MoS2 or mixed phase samples, and the HER proceeded only on the basal plane of all three samples. With the phase transformation from 1T′ MoS2 to 2H MoS2 under thermal annealing or laser irradiation, the samples exhibited a larger HER onset potential, lower current density and lower electric conductivity (Fig. 14d–f). Using in situ Raman spectroscopy, they successfully observed this phase-transformation phenomenon. As a proof of concept, they demonstrated that the basal plane of 1T′-MoS2 showed more active HER sites compared to 2H-MoS2, benefiting from the intrinsic distorted octahedral crystal structure and efficient charge transfer ability. Similarly, with the help of on-chip microreactors, Zhou and coworkers unambiguously shed light on the effects of individual factors such as charge transfer and thermodynamic energy barriers for tow modeled semiconducting MoS2 and semimetallic WTe2 HER electrocatalysts.241 They emphasized the paramount importance of electron injection at the catalyst/current collector interface and intralayer and interlayer within the electrocatalyst, which might play a more important role than thermodynamic energy considerations, and the results revealed that the activation process of phase engineering from the semiconducting phase to the metallic phase is partiallythe removal of the Schottky barrier originating from the metal–semiconductor interface between the current collector and the catalyst. In addition to the phase control without changing the stoichiometric ratio, tuning the stoichiometric ratios of metal and non-metal atoms is also an effective strategy to improve the intrinsic conductivity and activity of the electrocatalyst. For nickel phosphide (NixPy)-based materials, the Ni–Ni coordination progressively decreased with the increased Ni–P interactions.245,246 DFT calculations indicated that subtly introducing P into NixPy electrocatalysts enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity due to the improved conductivity and optimized Ni–P coordination environments, which has been experimentally validated.247,248 However, too high P:M ratios could compromise the metallic properties of metal phosphides. For instance, Ni3P exhibits higher HER electrocatalytic activity than Ni5P4,249 while Co2P exhibited similar HER activity to CoP.250

OER electrocatalysts generally undergo structural reconstruction in the bulk or on the surface under operando biases and electrolyte conditions.38 Therefore, the phase transformation will change the stability and activity of pristine electrocatalysts and has been intentionally applied to activate OER electrocatalysts. We demonstrated that α-Co(OH)2 intercalated with different anions showed distinguished OER activity under anodic potentials, and the lattice Cl− anions could promote the phase transformation from inert Co(OH)2 into an active CoOOH phase due to the dynamic easy Cl− etching process.251 Very recently, Jiang et al. also reported the promotion effect of lattice Cl− etching for OER activation (Fig. 15).238 They used operando XAFS analysis and DFT calculations to demonstrate the structural features of phase-change derived CoOOH and the as-prepared CoOOH controls. From the operando XASF analysis results, they proposed that the lattice Cl− etching with splitting of Cl–Co bonds would trigger the formation of unsaturated Co–O coordination bonds (Fig. 15b and c), and the DFT calculations further proved the phase-changed model of periodic 4-coordination numbers (4-CN) (Co–O) and 6-CN (Co–O) atomic arrangement, with coordination unsaturated 4-CN Co–O serving as OER active sites (Fig. 15e and f). Analogously, electrochemical etching of lattice atoms from pristine electrocatalysts have been recently reported to facilitate phase transformation to generate active phases.133,252 In addition to etching-promoted phase transformation, specific inactive heteroatom doping can also accelerate the active phase transformation. Lin et al. reported Pt single atom decorated NiO nanocubes as efficient OER precatalysts, which could be in situ phase transformed into active NiOOH species.253 Compared with surface Pt single atom decoration, they highlighted that bulk Pt doping could weaken the Ni–O bonds due to charge transfer from Pt to Ni through O and further promote the generation of active NiOOH species.

Besides the elaborate phase engineering, the construction of novel and particular phases can also activate electrocatalysts. Very recently, Chhowalla and coworkers successfully fabricated a metallic 2H phase of niobium disulfide with additional niobium (2H Nb1+xS2, where x is ∼0.35) for the first time, which has not been studied as a HER catalyst in its traditional phase of a non-layered polytype (3D phase).254 Compared with well-explored 2H and rhombohedral (3R) crystal configurations of NbS2 in the stoichiometry of 1:2 for Nb and S atoms, the excess Nb in 2H Nb1+xS2 results in a Nb-terminated surface featuring thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption energy. In addition, 2H Nb1+xS2 possesses a higher density of states at the Fermi level compared with 3D Nb1+xS2, which would translate into higher conductivity and better charge transfer kinetics. The resultant 2H Nb1+xS2 showed high current densities of >5000 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ∼420 mV, with an exchange current density of ∼0.8 mA cm−2. For the acidic OER, Zou and coworkers developed a novel 6H-phase SrIrO3 perovskite with good structural and catalytic stability, which contained 27.1 wt% less Ir but showed 7 times higher mass activity than IrO2.255 They explained that the novel structure features face-sharing IrO6 octahedral dimer subunits with unique Ir–Ir metallic bonding and weak Ir–O bonding, which is responsible for superior OER activities.
4.6 Construction of amorphous structures
Amorphous catalytic materials lack a significant long-range atomic crystalline order, which can not be evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis and no diffraction peaks can be overserved.256 Thanks to their unique atomic arrangements, these amorphous catalysts feature isotropic properties with a locally disordered structure and abundant unsaturated reactive sites, having found significant utility in the electrocatalytic HER and OER.257,258 Owing to the structural flexibility, amorphous electrocatalysts can also tolerate distinctive coordinated metal centers that may not be thermodynamically stable but highly active. At the same time, multicomponent electrocatalysts can be homogenously dispersed in their amorphous phase, avoiding phase separation in the crystalline model, which can guarantee sufficient electronic interactions between different species.145 Therefore, many electrocatalysts can be activated via transforming from their crystalline phase to an amorphous phase, with local optimized electronic structures to facilitate binding energy of HER and OER adsorbate intermediates.
Recently, a number of amorphous HER electrocatalysts have emerged which show promise in terms of reactivity, scalability and stability, often owing to the existence of numerous defective and unsaturated sites.256,259–262 In 2011, Hu and coworkers reported that an amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) film can be a highly active HER electrocatalyst for the first time, and they attributed the improved activity to the more coordinately and structurally unsaturated sulfur atoms compared to the crystalline phase.259 Following this work, some other amorphous HER electrocatalysts have been fabricated, exhibiting a larger catalytic current density than the corresponding crystalline catalysts, such as amorphous MoSxCly,157 CoSx,263 MoPx,264 WPx,265 NiO260 and so on. However, obtaining the crucial structure–property relationships of these amorphous electrocatalysts still remains as a big challenge. For amorphous MoSx-based electrocatalysts, local terminal S22− sites, bridging S22− sites and unsaturated Mo sites have all been studied as real active sites, and the specific amorphous structure can help maximize the expression of these active sites. Although amorphous electrocatalysts lack a long-range atomic order, they still have a short-range atomic arrangement, which provides the possibility to reveal the operando active sites under HER conditions. To shed light on the real active sites, Yano and colleagues used operando XAFS to analyze an amorphous MoSx electrocatalyst under functional conditions.266 In their work, they proposed that the terminal S22− units of a-MoSx, which would appear in the reduced form of amorphous MoS2 under cathodic potentials, are the real active sites for the HER, and they suggested that the rate-limiting step is the reduction and protonation of these terminal S22− sites. By contrast, Ting et al. evidenced the importance of bridging S22− for high HER catalytic activity.267 With the help of in situ Raman spectroscopic study of a model [Mo3S13]2− cluster, they captured the obvious decreased signals of υ(S–S)bridging rather than υ(S–S)terminal, resulted from the faster protonation process on bridging S22− sites, further demonstrating the importance of bridging S22− sites, whereas Artero and coworkers used DFT calculations and proposed that the Mo-hydride sites are the real active sites for amorphous MoSx under HER conditions.258 Besides MoSx-based electrocatalysts, operando spectroscopic studies have also been conducted for amorphous CoSx HER electrocatalysts. Yang and coworkers used operando XAFS and Raman analysis to identify the existence of octahedral CoS2-like state clusters under HER conditions, where Co centers are predominantly surrounded by a first shell of S atoms, which in turn preferentially exposed more active sites to the electrolyte compared to bulk CoS2.263
Most OER electrocatalysts are based on crystalline multimetal oxides; however, high activities can often be achieved with their amorphous phases. In 2013, Berlinguette and colleagues developed an UV-driven photochemical metal–organic deposition technique for generally accessing a series of amorphous metal oxide materials for water oxidation catalysis.257,268 Their continue studies focus on replacing the expensive metal–organic precursors with low-cost TM salts, exposing these films to near-infrared (NIR) radiation under inert and aerobic environments and broadening the substrates without heat treatment, which indicated a large-scale route to fabricate amorphous oxides from simple metal precursors.145,176,269–273 Besides the photochemical route, some novel fabrication methods to synthesize amorphous OER electrocatalysts, which can precisely control the crystallization rate and temperature, have also been discovered.145,148,176,269,272–274 For example, an aerosol-spray-assisted approach was used to fabricate amorphous oxides by controlling the calcination temperature.269 The room-temperature sol–gel method has been carried out to obtain amorphous hydroxide OER catalysts because of the controlled hydrolyzation rate.145,273 Very recently, Shao and colleagues reported a top-down strategy to generate a nanostructured amorphous hydroxide from a perovskite oxide by FeCl3 post-treatment.148 For these (hydro)oxide based amorphous OER electrocatalysts, active sites have generally been investigated on MO6 (M = 3d-TMs) octahedral frameworks, and the amorphous structure can induce the easy formation of higher-valence 3d-TM centers and more distorted or defective octahedral units relative to crystalline materials. Guo and coworkers demonstrated the easy and holistic transformation of higher-valence Co centers from ultrathin amorphous CoV hydroxides.176 Amorphous OER electrocatalysts have been focused on alkaline stable catalysts, while for acidic OER catalysts, the strategy of breaking the long-range order has also been successfully implemented to activate OER activity. Liu and colleagues fabricated lithium ion incorporated amorphous IrOx (Li–IrOx) electrocatalysts, which showed flexible local atomic arrangements (Fig. 16).275 They used operando XAFS analysis to identify the local structural changes of Li–IrOx, with increased oxidation states of Ir and shrinkage in the Ir–O bond under OER conditions, which are not observed on the crystalline rutile IrO2 electrocatalyst (Fig. 16c and d). Moreover, DFT calculations have demonstrated the kinetics of the deprotonation of the HO* intermediate to generate O* and the subsequent O–O bond formation has been accelerated because of the flexible structure of amorphous Li–IrOx. In addition to holistic amorphous structures, partial amorphous structures have also been systematically studied. Jiang et al. developed core–shell nanoparticles with Ni3B as the core and nickel borate (NiBi) as the shell, and revealed that the OER activity of Ni–Bi@Ni3B closely depends on the crystallinity of the Ni–Bi shell.276 In their results, they revealed that the partially crystalline Ni–Bi intrinsically exhibited a much higher OER activity than amorphous or crystalline analogs because of the fact that partially amorphous structures induced abundant reactive sites. Moreover, to accelerate the conductivity of amorphous catalysts, metallic (conductive) cores (or substrates) have also been subtly designed with amorphous active OER layers.231,277,278

For multicomponent electrocatalysts, an amorphous structure can tolerate homogeneous distribution avoiding phase separation, which meanwhile strengthens the electronic interactions between different components. We have fabricated amorphous CoW(OH)x catalysts to accelerate the neutral HER, where Co sites promote H2O dissociation to generate Had intermediates and W sites could effectively convert Had to H2. It is important that homogeneous dispersion of Co and W at the atomic scale further strengthened their collaborative interactions.261 Zhang et al. reported high-valence W6+ activated FeCoW (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysts.145 They demonstrated that strong synergism between homogeneously dispersed 3d-TMs and W atoms and W6+ species can effectively in situ promote the generation of high-valence Fe and Co species and optimize the Fe–O and Co–O local structures. Similarly, our recent work reported that Mo6+ species have also been demonstrated with effective promotion effects to achieve high-valence 3d-TM centers.279 After that, Zhang and colleagues reported that the formation energy of surface Ni4+ active sites could be systematically lowered by incorporating judicious combinations of Fe, Co and non-metal P (Fig. 17).273 Based on DFT calculation predictions, they anticipated that doping of phosphorus elements lowered the change in formation energy for the Ni(OH)2 → NiOOH transition, and suggested that the phosphorus dopant preferred to be fourfold coordinated and introduced steric strain into the Ni(OH)2 structure (Fig. 17a). In this regard, Fe and Co dopants could also lower the change in the formation energy for the NiOOH → NiO2 transition. More importantly, using in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), they demonstrated that the amorphous NiCoFeP catalyst could readily promote the generation of Ni4+ under low overpotentials (Fig. 17b–d). The resultant NiCoFeP required an overpotential of 330 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in a CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte, and retained its performance after 100 h of operation, broadening its application in non-membrane CO2 reduction electrolyzers.

5. Outlook
5.1 Conclusion
In recent years, various electrocatalysts have been discovered to lower the overpotentials and increase the selectivity for electrocatalysis processes. In this review, the activation strategies of electrocatalysts for the HER and OER in different reaction media, which consist of different electrolyzers to generate hydrogen, have been systematically summarized. We highlight that different key factors in the operando reaction environment should be considered besides the generally used descriptor-evaluation model. Simultaneously, we note that the reconstruction of catalytic materials in an operando working process will also significantly influence the catalytic performance, such as activity, stability and selectivity. Therefore, operando characterization techniques should be developed to analyze the operando changes of electrocatalysts. On the basis of understanding descriptors for each half reaction, key factors in different working environments and operando structural rearrangements, we summarize new insights into the activation of electrocatalysts from cheap and plentiful materials.
5.2 Challenges and further efforts
In addition to the summarized activation strategies, we still realize that deeper understanding activation strategies of electrocatalysts from operando active sites and real-world electrocatalysis should be emphasized, and will express our view on challenges and further efforts of activation strategies for the new generation of high-performance catalyst discovery.

5.2.1 Further investigation of dynamic active sites. 
We envisage that future breakthroughs in catalyst discovery will result from theory-guided prediction based on determined dynamic active site structures and transition states under operando conditions. We highlight that further efforts are therefore needed to tackle the following challenges. Firstly, it is urgent to improve the accuracy and practicality of theoretical prediction toward the activity origin and active catalyst structures, and thus to guide the design and synthesis of high-performance catalysts, especially reliably calculating the reactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface. For example, the explicit involvement of water is known to be important to the reaction energetics, closely affecting the proton transfer process. The solvation environment of simulation would bring about more complexity but provide accuracy for the deeper understanding of dynamic, which has not been widely used in many studies. With the development of theoretical methods, cutting-edge operando characterization and analysis capabilities will be highly desirable to directly and accurately identify dynamic active site structures and sensitively determine transition states and key reaction intermediates, especially encountered with the reconstruction of electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, more fundamental elucidations focused on electrode–electrolyte interfaces and double-layer regions should be further studied to ascertain operando electrocatalytic behaviors. Furthermore, on the basis of deeper understanding of these descriptor-based intermediates, combining theoretical and experimental research, economical and green routes for facile activation of electrocatalysts are crucially required.


5.2.2 Development of two-level volcano plots. 
We also envisage that the design and development of multicomponent hybridized catalyst structures would be a new paradigm of future catalyst discovery, as such catalyst structures enable the catalyst capable of utilizing the purposely designed individual active component to facilitate a target elemental step, and all active components to collectively and synergistically enhance the overall catalytic reaction. This will also facilitate the development of two-level volcano plots: one reflects the catalytic performance of the overall reaction and the other indicates the catalytic performance of individual reaction steps. Meanwhile, two kinds of key descriptors might be proposed to reflect the catalytic activity and a new two-level volcano plot might be drawn to more precisely describe the structure–property relationship. Such a volcano plot can also provide useful guidance to design and develop catalysts at the elemental reaction level. Thus, we propose that further efforts are needed to address the challenges including the development of theoretical and experimental approaches to gain insights into the catalytic behaviors of the boundaries formed in between different components and the near boundary region especially at the atomic level. For example, the distance between two active sites might strongly influence the catalytic behavior, which might be a new descriptor for hybrid electrocatalysts. At the same time, we also highlight that future efforts should be devoted to the synergetic enhancement mechanisms of different components and effective design of hybridized multicomponent catalysts.


5.2.3 Activation of electrocatalysts for real-world electrolysis. 
We believe that transforming breakthroughs in electrocatalyst discoveries into real-world water splitting would be an important objective of future research. We highlight research opportunities to address the following practical issues and challenges. Firstly, the activation strategy of electrocatalysts should maintain operando stability under real practical operation (e.g. ampere-level current and high-concentration electrolyte), to meet the requirements of electrolysis devices. The second is to improve the selectivity towards the target products, especially referring to low-grade and saline surface water, which might badly poison the electrocatalytic material.280 The third research challenge is large-scale catalyst production at low cost, from the present laboratorial level to the industrial level. Additionally, processability for electrode and electrolysis device fabrication could also accelerate the industrialization process of electrocatalysis-based technologies.
