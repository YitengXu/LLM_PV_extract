    , Accepted 4th January 2013First published on 8th January 2013AbstractCarbon nitride (CN) nanosheets with a thickness of around 3 nm were prepared by pyrolysis of urea. Well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles of about 3 nm were pre-loaded on CN nanosheets as the co-catalyst by chemical reduction in ethylene glycol. The Pt/CN sample showed a H2 evolution rate of 45.1 μmol h−1 from an aqueous solution of triethanolamine (TEOA) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). By simply adding a low-cost dye Erythrosin B (ErB) in the photoreaction suspension, a remarkably enhanced H2 evolution rate of 652.5 μmol h−1 was observed. Efficient electron transfer from excited ErB to the conduction band of CN is expected due to the energy difference between the LUMO level of excited ErB (−3.59 eV vs. vacuum level) and the conduction band potential of CN (−3.71 eV vs. vacuum level). A dye sensitization mechanism between ErB and CN is proposed. Upon irradiation with light of long wavelength (λ > 550 nm), the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system still exhibited a high H2 evolution rate of 162.5 μmol h−1. The highest quantum efficiency of 33.4% was obtained at 460 nm. Moreover, the Pt/CN photocatalyst could be easily recycled by simple filtration and 90% of the activity was still kept after five consecutive runs.
Introduction
Light-induced hydrogen production from water using semiconductor materials represents an attractive approach to store solar energy in the form of H2 fuel. The development of efficient, stable and low-cost photocatalyst systems which can utilize visible light (about 43% in the solar spectrum) is of great importance in practical applications. Various visible light-active photocatalyst systems, such as GaN:ZnO solid solution,1 (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox) solid solution,2 Rh-doped SrTiO3,3 nitrogen-doped TiO2,4 TaON,5 Pt–PdS/CdS,6 NiS/CdS,7 and ZnxCd1−xS,8 have shown promising H2 production activities for overall water splitting or in the presence of sacrificial reagents. Recently, a metal-free polymeric semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), was reported to be active for H2 or O2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation.9 Since then, carbon nitride has received increasing attention for photocatalytic application due to its advantageous features including non-toxic nature, high stability, low cost, suitable band structure and easy preparation.10
Commonly, carbon nitride was obtained by pyrolysis of nitrogen-abundant organic precursors, such as cyanamide,9 dicyandiamide,11 melamine,12 ammonium thiocyanate,13 urea,14 thiourea,15etc. In the pyrolysis process, two dimensional tri-s-triazine (melem) sheets connected via tertiary amines were firstly formed and further stacked together, leading to the formation of graphite-like carbon nitride powder. Due to the stacking of carbon nitride sheets, low surface area (normally below 10 m2 g−1)10 was found for bulk carbon nitride powder, which is not favorable for photocatalytic application. To improve the performance of carbon nitride, a template method was utilized to tune the textural properties. Colloidal silica,15 mesoporous silica (SBA-15)16 and ordered silica arrays17 have been chosen as the hard templates to obtain mesoporous or macroporous carbon nitride, while amphiphilic block polymers (Pluronic P123), surfactants (Triton X-100) and ionic liquids were also applied as the soft templates to introduce nanopores into the bulk carbon nitride.18 Dramatically increased surface area (over 100 m2 g−1) was obtained for porous carbon nitride, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance. However, the multiple processes and utilization of harsh conditions, such as the use of HF acid to remove the SiO2 template,15 make this method uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly. Besides texture modification, band structure engineering has also been applied to improve the photocatalytic performance of carbon nitride. Non-metal (sulfur,15,19 boron,12 fluorine20 and phosphorus21) or metal ion (Zn2+, Fe3+)11,22 doping into the framework of carbon nitride was investigated. Enhanced light absorption was found over doped carbon nitride samples, leading to their improved photocatalytic performance.
Dye sensitization has been successfully applied to semiconductors of wide band gap (TiO2, ZnO, etc.) to convert light with long wavelength to energy.23 A high solar energy conversion efficiency of more than 10% has been achieved over a TiO2 photoelectrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell.24 Dye-sensitized TiO2 was also able to generate H2 by photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation.25 Up to now, dye-sensitized carbon nitride for photocatalytic application has not received wide attention. Domen and co-workers synthesized magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc) deposited mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4), which was active for photocatalytic H2 production upon irradiation with light of wavelength longer than 600 nm.26 However, the activity of MgPc-mpgC3N4 was still low with a quantum efficiency of 0.07% at 660 nm. Very recently, Min and Lu reported Eosin Y sensitized nanoporous carbon nitride for H2 evolution, and a relatively high quantum efficiency of 19.4% at 550 nm was achieved.27 Thus it is a good strategy to adopt dye sensitization for activity improvement.
In this work, two-dimensional carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of a low-cost and abundant precursor of urea. An ex situ chemical reduction method was applied to load Pt nanoparticles uniformly on CN nanosheets using ethylene glycol as both solvent and reducing reagent. The as-obtained Pt/CN nanosheet sample showed 2.2–7.1 times higher H2 evolution activity than the aggregated carbon nitride powder samples obtained from other precursors. When a low-cost dye Erythrosin B (ErB) was introduced as a photosensitizer, the constructed Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system exhibited a remarkably enhanced H2 evolution activity due to the extended light absorption to long wavelengths and efficient charge transfer from excited ErB to CN. Due to the good dispersion and smaller particle size of the Pt cocatalyst, the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system also outperformed the Pt(in situ)/CN–ErB system. Moreover, the Pt/CN sample could be recycled by a simple filtration process.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CN and Pt/CN
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without any purification. Carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets were prepared according to a reported procedure with some modifications.9 In detail, 20 g of urea (99.3%, Alfa Aesar) was put in a crucible with a cover and heated under static air at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 2.5 °C min−1. The resultant light yellow powder was washed with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. For comparison, cyanamide (99%, Aldrich), dicyandiamide (99%, Alfa Aesar) and melamine (99%, Alfa Aesar) were also used as precursors treated under the same conditions to obtain the respective CN samples. Pt deposition was conducted in ethylene glycol (EG, 99%, Alfa Aesar). Briefly, 0.5 g of the CN sample was dispersed in 100 mL of EG containing an appropriate amount of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hydrate (H2PtCl6·xH2O, 40 wt% Pt, Acros Organics) by ultrasonication for 30 min. The suspension was then transferred to a round bottom flask, stirred and heated in an oil bath at 160 °C for 2 h. The solid sample was harvested by centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D2 Phaser, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å, 30 kV and 10 mA). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was recorded on a FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer) using a standard KBr pellet technique. The morphologies of samples were observed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM 6701F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 3010). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was performed on an MFP3D microscope (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA) with a cantilever (Arrow NC, Nanoworld) in tapping mode. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement was conducted at −196 °C on a Quantachrome Autosorb-6B apparatus. The specific surface area was determined with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The composition of the as-obtained sample was analyzed on an Elementarvario CHNS elemental analyzer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) at room temperature with the excitation wavelength of 365 nm or 490 nm. Both the excitation and emission slit widths used are 2.0 nm. Acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.5%, Kanto Chemical) was used as the solvent and the concentration of the dye and CN was kept at 0.005 mg mL−1 and 0.05 mg mL−1, respectively. Mott–Schottky plots were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH Instrument Inc., USA) by using the impedance–potential technique. Measurement was conducted on a conventional three-electrode cell, using a fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass with deposited CN, Pt foil, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. An aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. To determine the redox potential of ErB, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment was performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode cell system consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode. The aqueous solution containing 1 mM dye was purged with argon gas thoroughly before the CV test. The scan started at reduction with a rate of 100 mV s−1.
Photocatalytic activity measurement
Photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was conducted in a top window Pyrex cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. Typically, 0.1 g of the sample was dispersed in 100 mL of 5% v/v triethanolamine (TEOA, 99%, Acros Organics) aqueous solution by ultrasonication for 5 min. Prior adjustment of the pH value of TEOA aqueous solution to 9.0 was done with nitric acid (69%, Honeywell) aqueous solution. Then, 0.2 g of Erythrosin B (ErB, Alfa Aesar) was added to the above suspension. A 300 W Xe lamp (Newport) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was applied to provide visible light. Before light irradiation, the reaction system was evacuated and refilled with argon gas several times to remove air inside and finally filled with argon gas to reach about 30 Torr. The reaction cell was kept at about 20 °C by a cooling water jacket. The produced H2 gas was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N, TCD detector, argon as a carrier gas, 5 Å molecular sieve column). Different long-pass filters (λ > 420, 455, 475, 500, 520, 550 nm) and band-pass filters (centered at 420, 440, 460, 480, 500, 520, 550 nm) were equipped when conducting reactions with photons of different wavelengths and collecting quantum efficiency (QE) results, respectively. The reaction solutions were irradiated at λ > 420 nm for 0.5 h before switching to band-pass filters during quantum efficiency measurement. The amount of H2 gas produced in the subsequent 2 h was used to calculate quantum efficiency according to the equation shown below. The number of photons from the radiation source was measured using a silicon photodiode (13 DAS 005, MELLES GRIOT) connected to a broadband power/energy meter (13 PEM 001, MELLES GRIOT).  
Results and discussion
Material properties of CN and Pt/CN
Carbon nitirde can be obtained by pyrolysis of various organic precursors including cyanamide, dicyandiamide, melamine, etc. In this study, a much cheaper and abundant precursor, urea, was adopted as the starting material. To confirm the formation of carbon nitride, XRD and FTIR analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 1A–a, two distinct peaks can be observed. The strong peak located at 27.2° is the typical interplanar stacking peak of conjugated aromatic systems. The other peak at 12.8° belongs to an in-planar structural packing motif. Both peaks are the characteristic peaks commonly found in carbon nitride.9 The FTIR spectrum shown in Fig. 1B further confirms the formation of carbon nitride. The adsorption bands at 810 cm−1 and 1200–1650 cm−1 can be attributed to the breathing mode of triazine and the stretching mode of C–N heterocycles, respectively.28 The broad band at 3000–3700 cm−1 belongs to N–H vibration due to partial condensation and the adsorbed water molecules.15 Elemental analysis (EA) of as-prepared carbon nitride gives a C to N atomic ratio of 0.64, which is lower than the theoretical value of perfect carbon nitride (0.75 in g-C3N4). The hydrogen element was also detected during EA measurement besides carbon and nitrogen elements. The existence of hydrogen element in the form of N–H and NH2 groups which was confirmed by FTIR analysis should account for the relatively low C to N ratio.

The morphology of as-obtained carbon nitride was observed on a TEM and an AFM, as shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, a two-dimensional sheet-like structure consisting of winkles can be observed in the CN sample, which is the analogue of crumpled graphene.29 As shown in a typical height profile of CN nanosheets (Fig. 2d), the thickness of CN nanosheets was found to be around 3 nm, corresponding to about 9 stacked layers. When carbon nitride samples were prepared by pyrolysis of other precursors (cyanamide, dicyandiamide or melamine), much more condensed solid agglomerates with the size of several micrometers were formed as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The FESEM image of CN nanosheets is also shown in Fig. S1d (ESI†) for comparison. It can be seen that CN nanosheets exhibit a loose structure and smaller dimensions. During the pyrolysis process for carbon nitride formation, NH3 gas is commonly released from the organic precursors. Besides NH3, additional H2O vapor is generated when using urea as the precursor. It is expected that these gas species released during the pyrolysis process favor the expansion of the stacked layers, leading to the formation of less condensed carbon nitride nanosheets with smaller thicknesses.14

Recently, Niu et al. reported a thermal oxidation etching method to exfoliate the bulk condensed g-C3N4 agglomerates.30 By directly heating bulk g-C3N4 (obtained from dicyandiamide) in open air at 500 °C, carbon nitride nanosheets with a thickness of about 2 nm were obtained. The specific surface area of carbon nitride sheets was 6 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. Enhanced H2 evolution activity was obtained over carbon nitride nanosheets due to their high specific surface area, improved electron transport ability and longer lifetime of charge carriers, though their bandgap increased by 0.2 eV. In this study, similar graphene-like CN nanosheets were obtained by a more convenient method, which involved the pyrolysis of urea in one step only. The specific surface areas of as-obtained CN nanosheets and other carbon nitride samples are listed in Table 1. It is found that the CN nanosheet sample has the highest specific surface area of 84.2 m2 g−1, which is much larger than those of other carbon nitride samples. The high specific surface area provides more reaction sites, which is favorable for photocatalytic applications.30,31 The sheet-like structure is also beneficial for charge transfer compared with condensed agglomerates.30

Pristine carbon nitride showed low activity for H2 evolution due to the lack of H2 evolution sites. Pt nanoparticles were commonly adopted as the cocatalyst for H2 evolution after being loaded on carbon nitride by an in situ photoreduction method.9,11,17,30,32 In this study, we loaded Pt nanoparticles on CN nanosheets by an ex situ method in ethylene glycol (EG). The XRD pattern of Pt/CN is shown in Fig. 1A–b. It is observed that the loading of Pt nanoparticles in EG did not destroy the nanostructure of CN nanosheets. Two diffraction peaks located at 39.4° and 45.9° can be indexed to Pt (111) and Pt (200) of cubic phased metallic Pt (JCPDS card no. 87-0636). The weak diffraction intensities indicate the formation of small particles. The TEM image of Pt/CN displayed in Fig. 3a clearly shows that Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3 nm deposited on CN nanosheets are uniform and well-dispersed. The measured lattice of Pt nanoparticles is around 0.199 nm (Fig. 3b), corresponding well with the d-spacing of the Pt (200) plane (0.198 nm) obtained from the XRD result (Fig. 1A–b). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CN and Pt/CN are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption edge of CN is around 445 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.79 eV, which is slightly larger than carbon nitride samples obtained from other precursors (Table 1 and Fig. S2, ESI†). After Pt loading, there is no shift of the absorption edge. However, a distinct color change from light yellow to gray is found as shown in the inset of Fig. 4, which is also observed for the light absorption above 455 nm. Similar observations were also found for other Pt loaded semiconductors (CdS,31 TiO2,33etc.), which should be ascribed to the absorption by the black colored Pt nanoparticles.

Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity
Photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was conducted in TEOA aqueous solution using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. After loading of 1 wt% Pt, the CN nanosheet sample exhibited a H2 evolution rate of 45.1 μmol h−1 during the first 6 h of photoreaction. In comparison, carbon nitride samples prepared from other precursors showed much lower activities under the same conditions (Table 1), owing to their dense and aggregated structures. Thus, the CN nanosheet sample was further investigated for dye sensitization. Although carbon nitride has advantageous features including metal-free nature, low cost, easy preparation, etc., the relatively wide bandgap limits its light absorption in a narrow range. Besides foreign element doping, sensitization using magnesium phthalocyanine,26 Eosin Y27 and quantum dots (CdS)34 has been demonstrated as an effective way to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride.
In this study, Erythrosin B (ErB) together with other analogues of the low cost xanthene dyes were chosen to sensitize Pt/CN due to their extended light absorption to above 550 nm. Fig. 5 shows the time course of H2 evolution over the Pt/CN–ErB system and various control systems. Without the addition of ErB, Pt/CN exhibited a stable but low H2 evolution rate of 45.1 μmol h−1 (Fig. 5a). In the absence of CN, i.e., the system consisting of in situ reduced Pt and ErB (Fig. 5b), a H2 evolution rate of 694 μmol h−1 was observed in the first hour but the activity almost ceased in 3 h with a total of 1533 μmol of H2 collected. The instability of H2 evolution in this system was mainly due to the quick photobleaching of ErB. When CN nanosheets were present in the system containing in situ reduced Pt nanoparticles and ErB (Fig. 5c), both the activity and stability were improved. CN nanosheets not only play the role of semiconductor to absorb light, but also act as a shield to decrease the photobleaching rate of ErB. With the Pt/CN–ErB system (Fig. 5d), in which Pt nanoparticles were pre-loaded on CN nanosheets by an ex situ reduction method in EG, further enhanced H2 evolution activity and stability were obtained. A H2 evolution rate of 850.7 μmol h−1 was observed in the first 3 h and a total of 3785 μmol of H2 gas was produced in 6 h. By using an ex situ chemical reduction method, the Pt cocatalyst nanoparticles are well dispersed on CN nanosheets with an average diameter of 3 nm as shown in Fig. 3. In comparison, the particle size of in situ reduced Pt is in the range of 5–10 nm and less well-dispersed, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Both aggregated (Fig. S3-b and e, ESI†) and freestanding (Fig. S3-c and f, ESI†) Pt nanoparticles can be observed in TEM images, which are unfavorable for H2 evolution. Pt cocatalyst nanoparticles were commonly loaded on carbon nitride by an in situ photochemical reduction method for H2 evolution due to the convenience of the method. In this work, we for the first time developed a new strategy to improve the Pt loading state and obtained enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Reaction conditions: 100 mL of 5% v/v TEOA aqueous solution (pH = 9, adjusted with HNO3), a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. 
The stability of the ErB photosensitizer was monitored by measuring the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the reaction mixture at different times. ErB has its xanthene ring substituted with four iodide groups. In our previous study, it was found that the iodide groups in ErB are gradually lost upon cleavage of the C–I bond during photoirradiation, leading to halogen-free fluorescein (FL) molecules.35,36Fig. 6 shows the change in UV-visible absorption spectra during photoirradiation over Pt/CN–ErB and Pt–ErB (without CN) photocatalyst systems. For both systems, the maximum absorption peak was progressively blue-shifted to lower wavelengths together with the decrease in peak intensity, which should be ascribed to the loss of iodine from ErB. However, the peak intensities of the dye in Pt/CN–ErB (Fig. 6a) are much stronger than those in Pt–ErB without CN (Fig. 6b), especially after 2 h of photoreaction, indicating that ErB is more stable in the presence of CN nanosheets. A similar observation was found in our previous self-assembled Rose Bengal-layered double hydroxide–Pt photocatalyst system.37 It is suggested that the support material (LDH or CN) could act as a shield to suppress the self-quenching of the photosensitizers.

The reaction mixture was filtered and diluted 20 times before analysis. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of ErB, 100 mL of 5% v/v TEOA aqueous solution (pH = 9, adjusted with HNO3), a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. 
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used to investigate the electron transfer and excited state interactions between CN and the sensitizer ErB. As displayed in Fig. 7a, at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm, the CN sample showed a strong emission peak centered at 437 nm, corresponding to the electron–hole recombination on CN.27 After adding ErB dye to the CN suspension, the peak at 437 nm became slightly stronger. A new peak at 553 nm appeared in the PL spectrum which should be attributed to the excited ErB. Upon excitation at 365 nm, electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) of CN to the conduction band (CB) as well as from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of ErB to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). According to our electrochemical measurement, the reduction potential of ErB is −1.15 V vs. SCE, corresponding to a potential of ca. −3.59 eV vs. vacuum level.38–40 Due to the small difference between the flatband potential and the lower conduction band edge, the CB potential can be roughly considered to be the same as the flatband potential.41 The Mott–Schottky plots displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show that the flatband potential of CN is −1.03 V vs. SCE, corresponding to a CB potential of ca. −3.71 eV vs. vacuum level. Such an energy level difference makes it possible to drive electron transfer from the excited ErB to CN nanosheets. Thus, the PL intensity enhancement at 437 nm in the CN–ErB system is probably attributed to the recombination of electrons from excited ErB with holes in the VB of CN. The electron transfer behavior between ErB and CN was further supported by the fluorescence quenching of ErB by CN. As shown in Fig. 7b, upon excitation with 490 nm light, ErB shows a strong emission peak located at 553 nm. After dispersing CN nanosheets in the ErB solution, fluorescence quenching was observed, which is due to the efficient electron transfer from excited ErB to CN nanosheets. The emission peak slightly red shifted from 553 nm to 557 nm, which could be due to the π–π stacking interaction between the tri-s-triazine unit of CN and ErB molecules, since both of them have similar aromatic rings in their structures.27

Based on the above results and our previous study,35,36 the mechanism of H2 evolution over the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 1. In the absence of ErB, CN nanosheets play the role of semiconductor only. Upon light irradiation, negatively charged electrons are generated in the CB of CN and transferred through the nanosheet to Pt nanoparticles, where water reduction reaction occurs. The positively charged holes left in the VB are consumed by the sacrificial reagent TEOA. In the presence of ErB, a photosensitization mechanism is proposed. In aqueous solution, ErB molecules absorb light to form the excited state of triplet 3*ErB. Electrons released from 3*ErB are transferred to the CB of CN and then to the Pt nanoparticles for water reduction reaction. The oxidized ErB− is reduced back to ErB2− by the electron donor TEOA. Due to the limited light absorption of native CN (Fig. 4), Pt/CN showed low H2 evolution activity. After sensitization by ErB, dramatically enhanced H2 evolution activity was obtained due to the extended light absorption and efficient charge transfer from ErB to CN.

To further optimize the system, the effect of Pt loading amount on CN nanosheets was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Without Pt nanoparticles, the CN nanosheet sample showed a negligible H2 evolution activity of about 1 μmol h−1 even in the presence of the photosensitizer, indicating that the existence of a cocatalyst is essential. After loading 0.25 wt% of Pt on CN nanosheets, the H2 evolution rate dramatically increased to 315.4 μmol h−1 in the first 6 h. Continually increasing Pt loading to 1.25 wt% led to the highest H2 evolution rate of 652.5 μmol h−1. Further increasing Pt loading to 1.5 wt% slightly decreased the H2 evolution activity to 559.5 μmol h−1. Besides Erythrosin B, other xanthene dyes including Erythrosin Yellowish (ErY), Eosin Yellowish (EY), Rose Bengal (RB) and Fluorescein (FL) were also investigated as the photosensitizers for the Pt/CN catalyst. The molecular structures of these dyes are displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The H2 evolution activities over the Pt/CN–dye system are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It is found that ErB exhibited the highest activity which is followed by EY, ErY, RB and FL. The different halogen substitution in xanthene dyes affects their ground and excited states, which leads to the difference in light absorption and potential of photogenerated electrons.35,42 According to CV measurements, ErB, EY and RB showed the reduction potential of −1.15 V, −1.01 V and −0.94 V vs. SCE, respectively, corresponding to the LUMO level of −3.59 eV, −3.73 eV and −3.80 eV vs. vacuum, respectively. The relative LUMO energy level position estimation is also consistent with the results from computational study for ErB, EY and RB, although the exact positions are different.42 Considering that the conduction band potential of CN is around −1.03 V vs. SCE (−3.71 eV vs. vacuum), it is suggested that electron transfer from ErB to CN is easier than that from EY or RB to CN. Thus, in the Pt/CN–dye photocatalyst system, ErB exhibited the best performance for H2 evolution. The heavy halogen atoms in xanthene dyes are favorable for the formation of long-lived triplet states of xanthene dyes.43 Thus, the superior performance of ErB compared to other dyes with less halogen substitution (ErY, FL) also agrees well with our previously reported Ni–ME–dye photocatalyst system.35
 Fig. 8  Time course of H2 evolution over (a) Pt(0%)/CN, (b) Pt(0.25%)/CN, (c) Pt(0.5%)/CN, (d) Pt(0.75%)/CN, (e) Pt(1%)/CN, (f) Pt(1.25%)/CN and (g) Pt(1.5%)/CN. Reaction conditions: 0.1 g of the catalyst, 0.2 g of ErB, 100 mL of 5% v/v TEOA aqueous solution (pH = 9, adjusted with HNO3), a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. 
Compared with the photocatalyst system containing only semiconductors, one of the advantages of a dye sensitized photocatalyst system lies in the wide light absorption range. Fig. 9a displays the time course of H2 evolution using different long wavelength cut-off filters over Pt(1.25 wt%)/CN in the presence of the ErB photosensitizer. When a 420 nm cut-off filter was equipped, an average H2 evolution rate of 652.5 μmol h−1 was obtained in the first 6 h of photoreaction. With the increasing wavelength of the cut-off filter, the H2 evolution activity decreased gradually. Surprisingly, even upon irradiation with light of wavelength longer than 550 nm, a stable H2 evolution rate of 162.6 μmol h−1 can still be observed. The quantum efficiencies (QE) at different wavelengths over the Pt(1.25 wt%)/CN–ErB photocatalyst system are shown in Fig. 9b. The highest QE of 33.4% was achieved at 460 nm and it still remained 12.3% at 550 nm. Such features are highly desirable for utilization of light with longer wavelengths.

Other reaction conditions are the same as those in Fig. 8. 
In the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system, Pt is an expensive component. It is important to study the recycling behavior from the economic point of view. Fig. 10 shows the recycle study of the Pt/CN sample. After each run of 12 h, the solid sample was filtered and washed with deionized water, and then re-dispersed in a fresh aqueous solution containing ErB and TEOA for the subsequent run. It can be observed that 90% of the activity still remained after 5 runs, indicating the stability and good recyclability of the Pt/CN photocatalyst.

Conclusion
Through pyrolysis of a low-cost precursor urea, two-dimensional carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets with a thickness of around 3 nm were obtained. Well dispersed Pt nanoparticles of around 3 nm were pre-loaded on CN nanosheets in ethylene glycol solution. By using a low-cost xanthene dye ErB as the photosensitizer, a remarkably enhanced H2 evolution rate by 14 times is obtained over the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), which can be attributed to the efficient electron transfer from excited ErB to CN based on the PL analysis. The highest QE obtained was 33.4% at 460 nm. More importantly, the Pt/CN–ErB photocatalyst system was active even upon irradiation with light of wavelength longer than 550 nm. The Pt/CN can be easily recycled and 90% of the activity still remained after 5 runs. This work demonstrates a simple method for loading well dispersed Pt nanoparticles on CN and a proper choice of ErB photosensitizer for optimum enhancement of photocatalytic activity under visible light irritation.
