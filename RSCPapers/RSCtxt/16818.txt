    , Accepted 17th May 2022First published on 17th May 2022AbstractThe photoelectric conversion efficiency of lead-based halide perovskite photovoltaic cells (PSC) has reached 25% in recent years, which is the commercial level. A safe and environment-friendly encapsulation material and process for PSC determines its application in building-integrated photovoltaics. In this work, an acrylate hot melt adhesive (AHMA) with good transparency and extensive cohesiveness was obtained by free-radical copolymerization, based on which, the safety sandwich perovskite photovoltaic cell was prepared together with PVB film at 80 °C.

Before and after packaging, 21.58% and 20.88% of the PCE were achieved, respectively, for the perovskite photovoltaic device, which shows good stability. It has been confirmed that more than 96% of lead leakage can still be blocked from the seriously damaged device after heavy rainfall for 6 hours. The encapsulation scheme introduced here is especially suitable for perovskite photovoltaic building integration.
Introduction
In recent decades, lead-based perovskite photovoltaic cells have attracted considerable attention depending on their strong light absorption, solution processability and high photoelectric conversion efficiency. Several methods have been used to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs),1–4 but the long-term application of photovoltaic devices is still also dependent on their packaging protection.5–9 The polyisobutylene (PIB) blanket has been considered a good encapsulating material for PSCs, which exceeds the requirement specified by the IEC61215:2016 standard (1000 hours). After 1800 hours of damp heat, negligible change is observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the CsFAMA based film, but the PCE of the PIB edge-sealed cells degrades by 30% in the first 200 hours.10 The polymer/glass encapsulation provides an effective method for PSCs under a pressure-tight environment, which effectively suppresses the decomposition reaction even when it is not fully reversible as in the case for MA or FA/MA mixed multi-cation perovskites.11 The edge-sealed device was found to retain more than 80% of the initial PCE for over 400 hours, with a rapid performance loss observed after 400 hours.12 It was confirmed that the devices with blanket encapsulation architecture were stable throughout the entire storage period (500 hours).13
Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) have been widely used in building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) but they are not fit for organic metal halide PSCs due to their encapsulation temperature of 140 °C to 160 °C. The same occurs for polyolefin and Surlyn, where the perovskite film and other layers in the PSCs will decompose under the high encapsulation temperature.14 Decomposition to PbI2 occurred while heating in nitrogen at 85 °C for 24 hours. The formation energy of MAPbI3 is 0.11–0.14 eV, which is very close to 0.093 eV, suggesting the possible degradation of MAPbI3 at continuous exposure to 85 °C.15–18
With the development of PSCs, the lead leakage of PSCs has become a problem that must be faced in its popularization and application.19–21 A large amount of lead will be dissolved and released into the environment when the packaging of lead-based PSCs is damaged and washed by rain. Lead leaking from PSCs can seep underground and into plants, the food cycle of which is ten times more efficient than other lead contaminants already present from human activities.22 Compared with other heavy metal compounds like CdTe (10−34), the highly water-soluble products of PbI2 (10−8) have brought severe risks of Pb accumulation into the food chain.23 Nevertheless, it must be admitted that lead-based PSCs cannot be replaced by lead-free perovskite cells at present.24–26 For example, the certified power conversion efficiency of Sn-based perovskite solar cells is only 14%.27,28 It has been reported that compared with the glass cover packaging with ultraviolet curable resin on the edge of the PSCs module, the epoxy-based encapsulation can reduce the lead leakage rate by 375 times. This is attributed to the best self-healing characteristics under operating conditions and the increased mechanical strength.29 However, when the PSCs are damaged or even fail under severe weather conditions, including storms and hail, the toxic lead will leach out from the PSCs and then enter the soil, polluting the groundwater.
Recently, there has been some research on the lead leakage of PSCs. Alkoxy-PTEG has been used as a hole-transport polymer to reduce lead leakage, depending on its coordination with lead ions.30 Diphosphatidyl glycerol (DI-G) has been successfully added to perovskite layers as a self-shielding interface, and 96% of the lead leakage can be prevented depending on its covalent binding with lead ions and interfacial waterproofing.31 However, only a small amount of lead ions in the PSCs can be adsorbed due to their thickness of 10–30 nm. A thiol-functionalized two-dimensional conjugated metal–organic framework has been used as the electron extraction layer at the perovskite/cathode interface so that 80% of the Pb2+ leaking from PSCs would be captured depending on its water-insoluble nature.32 A dormant monomer additive has been strategically transformed into chelating polymer networks within perovskite layers so that as much as 94% of the rejection rate of Pb2+ dissolution for the cracked PSCs without encapsulation can be achieved after exposure to heavy rain for 24 hours, depending on the perovskite defect passivation and Pb2+ protection from water dissolution.33 However, the two studies mentioned above are not suitable for all PSCs because of their high technical barriers. Phosphonic acid-based polymer has been coated on the front and back sides of the device stack,34 then lead can be absorbed when the device is damaged and immersed in water. However, the surface coating is easily damaged and adsorptive saturation occurs on the outside.35 Recently, a low-cost cation-exchange resin was integrated into carbon electrodes and layered on the glass surface to reduce the lead leakage from carbon-based mini-PSC modules to 14.3 ppb, which is below the safe level of lead in drinking water and independent of temperature.36 It is not suitable for the integrated application of large-area photovoltaic buildings, but it provides a feasible idea for lead leakage adsorption of PSCs.
In this work, an acrylate hot melt adhesive (AHMA) with 85% transparency and extensive cohesiveness at 80 °C was obtained by free-radical copolymerization, based on which the safety sandwich perovskite photovoltaic cell was prepared together with PVB film under 0.05 MPa for 20 min. The PVB film is bonded with glass in advance. It avoids the structural damage of the perovskite device under high-temperature or UV curing. PCE of 21.58% and 20.88% can be achieved from the PSCs device with good stability before and after encapsulation, respectively. The extremely strong impact resistance of the encapsulated PSCs has been confirmed by falling ball impact simulation, which is attributed to the excellent adhesion of AHMA and PVB film in the devices. When photovoltaic devices are damaged, the large number of lead ions released from the perovskite layer can be absorbed by the AHMA in the encapsulation film, which can prevent environmental pollution caused by lead leakage. It has been confirmed that more than 96% of lead leakage can still be blocked in the seriously damaged device after heavy rainfall for 6 hours. The encapsulation scheme introduced here is especially suitable for perovskite photovoltaic building integration.
Results and discussion
Acrylate hot melt adhesive (AHMA) was synthesized by free-radical copolymerization with acrylic acid, methyl acrylate and butyl acrylate. Acrylate polymer is a typical electronic packaging material, the surface resistivity of which is about 1015 Ω sq−1. As shown in Fig. 1a and b the monomers have been completely polymerized as seen from the disappearance of the IR absorption peak at 1636 cm−1, which is attributed to the stretching vibration of the CC group in the acrylate monomer. More than 92% of transmittance for AHMA and AHMA-PVB sandwich glass can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 1c, which is better than the single glass, depending on the antireflection effect of AHMA. The light stability of AHMA is very important for its encapsulation. It has been confirmed that the AHMA/Glass has 95.1% transmittance, and 94.9% after 180 days under light illumination (Fig. S1, ESI†). Here, the thickness of the adhesive film after hot pressing is 47 ± 9 microns. The good hydrophilicity of AHMA can be seen from the surface water contact angle, as shown in Fig. S2, (ESI†) which is attributed to the carboxyl group in the molecule, but it is also a water-insoluble polymer due to the ester group (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). Trace lead ions in aqueous solution can be adsorbed by AHMA, depending on its ion adsorption effect, as described in Fig. 1d. It can be seen from Fig. S3 (ESI†) that 0.5 ppm of lead in solution can be absorbed by 140 mg of AHMA at 40 °C (pH = 4.2).

Laminated glass based on AHMA/PVB with different acrylic content (AHMA-x% AA) was constructed under 0.05 MPa of pressure at 110 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 2a, the shear strength of laminated glass gradually increased to 0.9 MPa and then decreased to 0.3 MPa with the increase in the acrylic acid content in AHMA. It can be seen that 0.9 MPa of the shear strength for the laminated glass can be reached, which is attributed to the carboxyl groups in the polymer. When the acrylic acid content is less than 7%, the cohesive force of AHMA is greater than the external force, but the opposite occurs for content greater than 7%. As such, AHMA with 7% acrylic acid is used for the following discussion (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†).

As shown in Fig. 2b, two glass sheets were bonded by an AHMA film and held a 500 g weight for 395 min of the bonding time. The good thermal stability of AHMA was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis; as shown in Fig. S5, (ESI†) there was no decomposition for AHMA at less than 300 °C. It can also be seen from Fig. 2c that the glass transition temperature (Tg) and melt temperature (Tm) of AHMA are −25.87 °C and 74.92 °C, respectively. It can be used stably for a long time at −25 °C to 75 °C and packaged at 80 °C, which is lower than the damage temperature of most perovskite solar cells. The excellent bonding heat resistance of AHMA was confirmed from the longest bonding time of 103 s (Fig. 2d and Table S2, ESI†). The good cold resistance of the AHMA materials has been confirmed in Fig. S6, (ESI†) where the bond shear strength at −20 °C is consistent with that at room temperature. As shown from the encapsulation structure of PSCs in Fig. 2e, the PVB/glass substrate can be obtained under pressure at 130 °C for 2 hours. AHMA was uniformly coated on the surface of the perovskite cell device and pressed by the PVB/glass substrate at 80 °C for 20 min. The strong shear forces between AHMA and the perovskite material are shown in Fig. 2f. It was also confirmed that AHMA exhibits good adhesion with every layer of perovskite device and PVB packaging material (Fig. S7 and Table S3, ESI†). Therefore, AHMA is a good packaging bonding material for perovskite photovoltaic building integration, avoiding a high-temperature process.
Perovskite solar modules based on the ITO/SnO2/CsFAMAPbI3/PEAI/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au structure were constructed. Glass was covered and encapsulated on the modules with AHMA-PVB. Depending on the PVB film and good bonding properties, the encapsulated photovoltaic module can be applied to photovoltaic building integration, which has excellent impact resistance and greater safety. As the ASTM E1038 standard, the hail damage to the perovskite module under real operating conditions was simulated (100 g steel ball, 50.8 cm). As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S8, (ESI†) the ITO and packaging glass in the damaged micro-module were cracked (Movies S1 and S2, ESI†).

(b and c) The detection of Pb2+ concentration in water after soaking with damaged PSC modules with and without encapsulation. (d) The detection of Pb2+ concentration in solution from the damaged PSC modules with and without encapsulation by dripping with heavy rainfall for different times. Note that the encapsulated PSC was based on the Glass/PSC/AHMA/PVB/Glass structure. 
Firstly, the lead leakage from the damaged solar modules was detected by immersion to simulate the flooding of the damaged modules. In this work, the damaged module was completely immersed in deionized water with different pH values (4.2 and 6.8) at 40 °C. Then, the concentration of lead ions in water was detected by ICP every 30 min, as shown in Fig. 3b and c; after 30 min, the lead concentration outside of the encapsulated module increased sharply due to the lead leakage. The concentration of lead in water for the modules without encapsulation increased with the increase in the immersion time. In contrast, a small amount of lead leakage was detected for the damaged modules with the AHMA-PVB package. This clearly shows that the lead leakage from the damaged perovskite modules can be effectively prevented by AHMA-PVB encapsulation (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†).
Rainwater scouring is a common working condition for photovoltaic building integration. In this work, acid and heavy rainfall (pH = 4.2, 5 mL h−1) were simulated and dripped onto the damaged solar mini-modules with ∼1 cm2 of the damaged area (Fig. S10, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a, a large area of yellow product appeared in the unencapsulated module, while tiny yellow products were observed around star cracks for the encapsulation modules after 1.5 hours. The average lead concentration in water from the three modules without encapsulation was 2384 ppb, and 104 ppb for the one with PVB encapsulation, but only 1 ppb for the modules with AHMA-PVB encapsulation (Fig. 3d). There was no obvious increase of yellow products around the star crack of the encapsulation module after suffering rainfall for 3 h. Here, the average lead concentration in the collected water from the unencapsulated modules for 3 hours was detected as 3524 ppb, but it was 548 ppb and 392 ppb for the ones with PVB and AHMA-PVB encapsulation, respectively. There was still no obvious increase in yellow products after suffering from rainfall for 6 hours, and 17.32 ppm of the average lead concentration without encapsulation modules was detected, but 1.992 ppm and 0.703 ppm for the ones with PVB and AHMA-PVB encapsulation, respectively (Table S5, ESI†). Rainwater can be prevented from entering, depending on the strong impact resistance of PVB, which can reduce the lead leakage. However, the free lead ions can be adsorbed further by AHMA polymer as discussed before. Here, 96% of the lead leakage from the device can be adsorbed by AHMA, which significantly reduces the environmental pollution caused by perovskite photovoltaic building integration. It should be noted that the adhesion of the adhesive film will not be lost after absorbing water. As shown in Fig. S11, (ESI†) after soaking in water for 24 hours, the bonding shear strength between it and glass decreased by less than 0.05 MPa.
The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.58% was achieved from the perovskite solar cells based on the ITO/SnO2/CsFAMAPbI3/PEAI/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au structure without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 4a, PVB was bonded to glass by a hot-pressing process before the encapsulation, and then PVB and the PSC device were bonded by AHMA at 80 °C for 20 min. General perovskite photovoltaic cells are very stable at 80 °C, so the device decomposition of PSC in the process of high-temperature packaging is avoided in this work. Finally, waterproof glue was used to seal the device to block water. As shown in Fig. 4b, PCE of 20.88% was achieved from the PSCs based on the same structure with encapsulation, which is a small change before and after packaging. The J–V curves for the device before and after encapsulation under forward and reverse voltage scanning in both configurations were essentially overlapping, indicating that there was no interface defect in the PSC encapsulated with AHMA and PVB (Table S6, ESI†). More importantly, the efficiency of the encapsulated PSCs remained unchanged after being placed in air for ten days.

Conclusions
In this work, AHMA with excellent light transmittance was synthesized by copolymerization, which can bond with a variety of materials, such as metal, polymers, perovskite, glass, and inorganic matter, etc. More importantly, AHMA can absorb Pb2+, depending on its ionic interactions. PVB was bonded to glass by a hot pressing process before the encapsulation, and then PVB and the PSC device were bonded to AHMA at 80 °C for 20 min. The device decomposition of PSC in the process of high-temperature packaging is avoided in this process. It is suitable for perovskite photovoltaic building integration accompanied by the strong impact resistance of the encapsulated structure. The PCE of 20.88% was achieved from the PSC based on the ITO/SnO2/CsFAMAPbI3/PEAI/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au structure with encapsulation, which is a small change before and after packaging. There was no interface defect in the PSC encapsulated with AHMA and PVB. Using this packaging structure, the lead leakage from the damaged PSC decreased to 10 ppb after heavy rainfall for 1.5 hours, which was lower than the safe level of lead in drinking water. The glass/PSC/AHMA/PVB/glass structure designed in this work provides a new route for the process of perovskite photovoltaic building integration.

Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a mixed solution of ethanol, water, and isopropanol for 15 min, respectively, then cleaned with ozone for 30 min. Colloidal tin oxide was diluted to 4%, and SnO2 film was obtained by spin-coating on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. The film was exposed to ozone for 20 min and then spin-coated with a mixed solution of PbI2 and CsI at 2800 rpm for 30 s, which was obtained by dissolving 600 mg of PbI2 and 18 mg of CsI in DMF:DMSO solution (1.3 M, 9:1 v/v). After annealing at 70 °C for 1 min, The mixed amine salts (FAI:MAI:MACl = 60:5:6, dissolved in IPA) were spin-coated on the film at 2500 rpm for 30 s, air annealed for 15 min, and then transferred to a N2 glove box. The film surface was spin-coated with PEAI (5 mg mL−1, dissolved in IPA) at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and oxidized overnight after spin-coating with Spiro-OMeTAD. Molybdenum oxide and gold electrodes were also vapor-deposited on this film, respectively.
Characterizations
The performance of PSC was measured using simulated AM 1.5 G lighting (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA solar simulator) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The J–V characteristic curves were tested by a Keithley 2400 source meter. The J–V characteristic curves of all solar cells were measured with a metal mask with an active area of 0.0625 cm2. Scan curves, both forward and reverse, were tested with a bias step fixed at 10 mV and delay time fixed at 0.05 s. The optical transmittances of the glass substrate, glass-AHMA, and glass-AHMA-PVB were measured by an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. The lap shear strengths were measured on an electronic universal testing machine at a deflection rate of 5 mm min−1 (INSTRON, Instron 5982). The TGA thermograms of AHMA were obtained at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 atmosphere by a TA Q500 TGA. The DSC curves of AHMA were obtained at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 atmosphere by a TA Q20 DSC. The Pb concentration in water was detected using an ICP-MS instrument (PerkinElmer, Nexion 300D). The infrared spectra were detected using an infrared spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Nicolet 6700).
Synthesis of AHMA and PVB
Here, 51.9 g of butyl acrylate and 27.87 g of methyl acrylate were added to a 100 mL three-necked flask with stirring at 30 °C for 20 min, then 0.42 g of azobisisobutyronitrile was added gradually with stirring. Next, 5.85 g of acrylic acid was added to the mixture slowly drop-by-drop using a dropping funnel with stirring at 40 °C and N2 protection, then 10 mg of polymerization inhibitor was added with stirring. The acrylic acid prepolymer was achieved after reaction at 55 °C for more than 1 hour. The acrylate hot melt adhesive was obtained after pouring its prepolymer into a mould and heating curing at 60 °C for 3 hours.
PVB resin was synthesized by acetal polymerization from polyvinyl alcohol and butyraldehyde with acid catalysis. PVB film was obtained by a tape-casting extrusion process of PVB resin.
Device encapsulation
PVB film was bonded to a glass (1 mm) covered with PI film on the other side at 130 °C under the pressure of 0.05 MPa. PVB/Glass was obtained after peeling off the PI film at room temperature. Next, 140 mg of AHMA was sandwiched between the PVB/Glass and the PSC at 80 °C with 0.05 MPa for 20 min.
Lead leakage
The security of the encapsulated devices with Glass/PVB/AHMA/PSC/Glass structure was detected by a falling ball impact with a 100 g steel ball at the height of 50.8 cm. First, we evaluated the Pb2+ adsorption of AHMA in aqueous solution. Here, 140 mg of AHMA coated on 25 × 25 mm glass was left in 40 mL of water solution (pH = 4.2) with 10.52 ppm of Pb2+ at 40 °C. The Pb2+ concentration in the solution was detected by ICP-MS. For the lead leakage test from damaged perovskite solar modules, the damaged perovskite mini-modules were first immersed in 40 mL of water (pH = 4.2 and 6.8), and the Pb2+ concentration in the solution was tracked by ICP-MS every 30 min. As shown in Fig. S10, (ESI†) the acid rain (pH = 4.2) was dropped at a rate of 5 mL h−1 on the PSC modules at an angle of ∼30° through a drip funnel. The Pb2+ concentration in the scouring fluid was tracked by ICP-MS for 1.5 h, 3 h and 6 h, respectively.
