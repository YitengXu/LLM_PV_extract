    , Accepted 14th March 2016First published on 14th March 2016AbstractBinary lead and tin perovskites offer the benefits of narrower band gaps for broader adsorption of solar spectrum and better charge transport for higher photocurrent density. Here, we report the growth of large, smooth crystalline grains of bianry lead and tin triiodide perovskite films via a two-step solution process with thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing. The crystalline SnxPb1−xI2 films formed in the first step served as the templates for the formation of crystalline CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 films during the second step interdiffusion of methylammonium iodide (MAI). Followed by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vapor-assisted thermal annealing, small, faceted perovskite grains grew into large, smooth grains via the possible mechanism involving bond breaking and reforming mediated by DMSO solvent molecules. The absorption onset was extended to 950 and 1010 nm for the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskites with x = 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. The highest PCE of 10.25% was achieved from the planar perovskite solar cell with the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 layer prepared via the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. This research provides a way to control and manipulate film morphology, grain size, and especially the distribution of metal cations in binary metal perovskite layers, which opens an avenue to grow perovskite materials with desired properties to enhance device performance.
Introduction
Forming alloys has been widely used in semiconductor materials to engineer band gaps and to improve electronic properties via a variety of material growth methods.1 Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are a promising, emerging photovoltaic material that offers the choice to form alloys through metals,2–4 halogens5–7 and organic cations6–12 because of the unique chemical structure AMX3 (A = organic molecule; M = Pb, Sn; X = I, Cl, Br). Very recently, there has been growing interest to explore the use of binary Pb–Sn perovskites as light harvesters to replace pure Pb-based perovskites for photovoltaic applications because in part, it reduces the toxic Pb content but more importantly, it narrows the band gap to enable broader light harvesting from visible to near infrared.2–4 Until now, all the Pb–Sn perovskite layers were fabricated by a one-step solution spin coating process, which yielded clusters with many pinholes and thus significantly affected device performance.4,5 The process conditions must be strictly controlled in order to obtain uniform and pinhole-free planar films.4,5,13 Pure Pb-based perovskite films have been fabricated via the interdiffusion of sequentially spin coated metal halide and methylammonium iodide (MAI) layers.14–16 The independently manipulated nucleation and reaction rate between metal halide polycrystals and MAI enables better control over the pinhole-free perovskite film formation process. Solvent annealing was also applied to promote grain growth and improve crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.17–20 Solar cells that utilized the solvent annealing process for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers demonstrated improved photocurrent, and thus enhanced performance, compared to those using the only-thermal annealing process for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers.17 It is known that there always exists build-in stress in alloys due to different size and binding energy of two elements, which eventually leads to defects or segregation to release the stress and to reduce the system energy. Therefore, we hypothesized that the binary Pb–Sn perovskites could exhibit interesting and unique behaviors resulting from solvent annealing because of the different crystalline structures, the nature of ionic crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3SnI3, and the different binding energy of Pb and Sn to high electron affinity elements (e.g., I and O).
Typically, MAPbI3 perovskite materials adopt a tetragonal I4cm perovskite structure at room temperature and undergo a reversible structural phase transition to the cubic P4mm space group at elevated temperatures.10 Both Sn and Pb are group 14 elements. Although Sn has a smaller ionic radius of 1.35 Å compared to that of Pb (1.49 Å),4 partial substitution of Pb with Sn content up to 43% is within the structural tolerance.21 The resultant crystals still maintain a tetragonal I4cm perovskite structure at room temperature. A transition from tetragonal I4cm to cubic P4mm perovskite structure occurs when the Sn content in the perovskite exceeds 50%.2 In the meantime, partial or complete replacement of Pb with Sn alters the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of perovskite materials, resulting in the band gaps of CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 from 1.55 to 1.17 eV by varying x from 0 to 0.5 and 0.75, i.e., from CH3NH3PbI3 to CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.75Pb0.25I3.2 The absorption onset is able to reach as high as 1060 nm by using CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 or CH3NH3Sn0.75Pb0.25I3.2
The early reported Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells adopted the device structure built upon mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, which requires a high temperature (500 °C) sintering process.2,3,22,23 The active layers were prepared by spin coating the anhydrous dimethylforamide (DMF) solutions of either the mixtures of a certain molar ratio of Sn halide to Pb halide compounds and MAI3 or pre-synthesized perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI32,24 and CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx23) followed by thermal annealing. The best performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.37% was achieved from a device with the active layer made from pre-synthesized binary Pb–Sn perovskite with 25% Sn (CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3).2 A record high PCE of 6.4% was demonstrated by a pure Sn perovskite (CH3NH3SnI3) solar cell.22 Very recently, Pb–Sn with mixed halide perovskite solar cells with a planar heterojunction configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3−xClx/PCBM/C60-bis/Ag were fabricated by a low temperature solution procedure.4 Sn was introduced to the lead perovskite with mixed halide. The CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3−xClx layer was prepared by spin coating a DMF solution with a mixture of SnCl2, PbCl2, and CH3NH3I followed by thermal annealing. An average PCE of 9.77% and a maximum PCE of 10.10% were achieved for the solar cells with 15% Sn in the perovskite layer (CH3NH3Sn0.15Pb0.85I3−xClx).
In this work, we prepared CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskite films using a two-step solution-process method followed by only-thermal annealing and thermal annealing plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing, respectively, and deployed them in solar cells with a planar heterojunction configuration. Unlike the one-step solution process that makes the binary Pb–Sn perovskite polycrystalline films directly from the solutions of either pre-synthesized Pb–Sn perovskites2,24 or mixtures of lead halide, tin halide, and MAI,4 we grew the binary Pb–Sn iodide (SnxPb1−xI2) polycrystalline film first and showed that the crystalline structure of PbI2 was retained for 10 and 25% Sn substitutions. However, the morphology, grain size, and grain orientation were significantly influenced by the amount of Sn substitutions. After spin casting the MAI layer, we annealed the films in three ways, with only-thermal annealing at 100 °C for 2 h, with thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h plus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or DMF vapor-assisted thermal annealing at the same temperature for another 1 h. Both DMSO and DMF interacted with Pb–Sn perovskites and caused morphology changes. DMSO had a much more pronounced effect than DMF, yielding larger grains with the same orientation, and with flat surfaces. A possible mechanism of bond breaking and reforming mediated by solvent molecules was discussed. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements revealed that the substitution of Sn caused the redshift of absorption onset at 950 and 1010 nm for 10% and 25% Sn binary Pb–Sn perovskites, respectively. While the absorption onsets stayed the same, the high EQE appeared in different wavelength changes after the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. As a result, the solar cells containing 10% Sn (CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3) perovskite films made via the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing exhibited an average PCE of 9.95% and the maximum PCE of 10.25%. We also achieved an average PCE of 8.45% and the maximum PCE of 8.83% for solar cells containing the active layer of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 prepared via the only-thermal annealing. The performance is higher than the PCE of 7.37% with the same composition of perovskite, but different device structure and different perovskite film preparation method.2 This research provides a way to control and manipulate film morphology, grain size, and especially the distribution of metal cations in binary metal perovskite layers, which opens an avenue to grow perovskite materials with desired properties to enhance device performance.
Materials and methods
Materials and sample preparation
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized as described previously.25 In a typical procedure, 24 mL of a 33 wt% methylamine (CH3NH2) solution in anhydrous ethanol (Aldrich) was charged with 100 mL ethanol (anhydrous, ≥99.5%) in a 250 mL round bottom flask. The solution was stirred in an ice-water bath with the nitrogen protection. After that, 10 mL of 57 wt% hydroiodic acid (HI) in water (Aldrich) was added dropwise to the methylamine solution over a time period of 30 min. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h. The white precipitate was recovered by rotary evaporation at 40 °C. The yellowish dried precipitate was dissolved in ethanol followed by sedimentation in diethyl ether by stirring the solution for 30 min. The mixture was then washed three times with diethyl ether. The washed solid was then collected and dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. To prepare the solutions for making SnxPb1−xI2 films with x = 0.1 and 0.25, tin(II) iodide (SnI2, 99.999%, Aldrich) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%, Aldrich) powders were mixed with a molar ratio of 0.1:0.9 and 0.25:0.75, respectively. Each mixed powder was then dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%, Aldrich) to a concentration of 0.868 M. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99.5%, Nano-C) powder was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB, anhydrous, 99%, Aldrich) to a concentration of 27.1 mg mL−1, stirred at 90 °C for 2 h, and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter.
Perovskite film fabrication and characterization
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1, Colorado Concept Coatings LLC) were first cut into 15 mm × 15 mm pieces. The substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonication in soapy deionized millipore water, millipore water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min and then treated with oxygen plasma for 30 s. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios™ P VP AI 4083, H.C. Starck, filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter) layer was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 105 °C for 30 min in air. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glove box, spin-coated with prepared metal iodide precursor solutions at 6000 rpm for 45 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 20 min. 70 μL of 0.314 M MAI 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%, Aldrich) solution was dropped onto the substrate, set for 5 s, and then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 35 s. The substrates were dried at room temperature for 1 h. For the only-thermal annealing, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 2 h. For the thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing, the substrates were first thermally annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and then covered by a glass petri dish. A drop of 10 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9%, Aldrich) or DMF was added onto the hotplate inside the petri dish to allow solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. To perform two-dimentional X-ray diffraction (2D-XRD) measurements, the films were protected by spin coating a 30 mg mL−1 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, average Mw ∼ 120000 by GPC, Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.8%, Aldrich) solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The measurement of 2D-XRD was carried out on a Bruker GADDS D8 Discover diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å). Three frames with 160 s per frame were obtained for each sample. Scan angle 2θ begins at 25° with a frame width of 30°. During the scan, the samples oscillate along x- and y-axis with an amplitude of 1.0 mm. Data were processed using the EVA package provided by Bruker Axs. The morphology of the perovskite films was characterized right after the films were prepared using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Sirion SEM).
Device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurement
Solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3Sn1−xPbxI3 (x = 0.1 and 0.25)/PC61BM/C60 (99.95%, MTR LTD.)/bathocuproine (BCP, 99.99%, Aldrich)/Al (99.999%, R.D. Mathis). The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3Sn1−xPbxI3 (x = 0.1 and 0.25) films were fabricated as described above. The filtered PC60BM solution was spin coated onto the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 60 s, annealed at 90 °C for 1 h. A 20 nm C60 layer and an 8 nm BCP layer were thermally deposited in sequence. Finally, the cathode Al layer of 100 nm was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask to make 16 electrodes each with an area of 3.14 mm2. The background pressure was <1 × 10−6 Torr during thermal deposition. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded in a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter unit. The measurements were performed under AM1.5 illumination condition at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a calibrated silicon solar cell that had been previously standardized at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. EQE spectra were measured with a Keithley 6430 sub-femtoamp source meter through NI LabView software control. A tungsten light source was used to illuminate the device through an Acton Research SpectraPro 275 monochromator to provide wavelength selectivity for the EQE measurement. A power meter (Newport 1830-C) was used to calibrate the light source.
Results and discussion
The metal iodide (SnxPb1−xI2) films were formed by spin casting the DMF solutions of the mixtures of SnI2 and PbI2 onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 20 min (Fig. 1). The XRD patterns in Fig. 2A show that the Sn0.1Pb0.9I2 and Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 films have the hematite PbI2 phase with a space group of Pm1 (164),26 indicating that Sn substitutes Pb in the PbI2 crystals and the binary Pb–Sn iodide crystals retain the PbI2 crystalline structure. A dramatic intensity increase in the peaks at 25.7° (002) and 52.6° (004) was observed in the XRD pattern of the Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 film, which might be due to the change of grain orientation or an increase in crystallinity. The 2D-XRD patterns of two films shown in Fig. S1 in ESI† confirm the possible orientated polycrystals from the very obvious intensity distribution of the diffraction rings corresponding to the (001), (002), (003), and (004) planes. The SEM images (Fig. 2B and C) of these two films show dramatically different morphologies. The Sn0.1Pb0.9I2 film has a porous, interconnected structure with the crystal grain size of 100–500 nm and pore size of 100–200 nm. The Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 film is packed with dense flake-like crystals with the size 100–500 nm and about half of the flakes are tilted or even perpendicular to the substrate surface, which confirms the XRD result that the reorientation of crystalline grains occurred in the Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 film. Pure PbI2 crystals were synthesized using a solvothermal method, and hexagonal PbI2 crystalline plates grown horizontally on lead foils in I2 powder and ethanol systems were obtained.26 The highly asymmetric hexagonal plates with an aspect ratio ∼1/10 and the [001] direction of the plate thin direction indicates that growth rate along the [001] direction is much slower than along the hexagonal plane perpendicular to the [001] direction. Here, PbI2 and SnI2 were dissolved in DMF, and the binary SnxPb1−xI2 recrystallized during the thermal annealing process, in which the coordinated DMF in PbI2·DMF was released according to the previous thermogravimetric analysis of PbI2·DMF.27 Our XRD results showed no PbI2·DMF phase after thermal annealing. The SEM images and XRD results showed in-plane orientation of the Sn0.1Pb0.9I2 film and grain reorientation of the Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 film.

The peaks belong to ITO are labelled by asterisk. (B and C) SEM images of Sn0.1Pb0.9I2 and Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 films, respectively. 
The crystalline metal iodide films served as templates to grow perovskite crystals. The Pb(Sn)I64− octahedrons change from the edge connection in metal iodide crystals to the corner connection in perovskite crystals accompanied by the insertion of MA cations. Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns, the top-view and cross-sectional view SEM images, and grain size distribution of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films prepared via the only-thermal and thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted annealing processes after spin coating MAI 2-propanol solutions over the metal iodide polycrystalline films. The peaks for the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 (Fig. 3A1) are ascribed to tetragonal perovskite crystal with a space group of I4cm. The XRD patterns of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 (Fig. 3B1) films are almost identical to those of CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 films, and also no obvious changes were observed for the films prepared via different annealing processes. This indicates that the films with 10 and 25% Sn substitutions are perovskite crystals with the I4cm phase. The results are in agreement with the previous study that a transition from tetragonal I4cm to cubic P4mm perovskite structure occurs for greater than 50% Sn content in perovskites.2 It is reported that the MAPb0.85Sn0.15I3−xClx film prepared via one-step solution method showed partial I4cm/P4mm phases.4 The incorporation of chlorine into MAPbI3−xClx was classified as a dopant both experimentally and theoretically.28 Because there is a large difference between the ionic radii of chlorine (1.81 Å) and iodine (2.20 Å),29 the doping of chlorine might induce the generation of P4mm phase in the MAPb0.85Sn0.15I3−xClx crystal.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns (A1 and B1), top-view (A2 and B2, A4 and B4) and cross-sectional view (A3 and B3, A5 and B5) SEM images, and grain size distribution (A6 and B6) of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 (A) and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 (B) films after the only-thermal annealing (A2, 3 and B2, 3) and thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing (A4, 5 and B4, 5). 
Different annealing processes have a significant impact on the morphology in terms of grain size and surface smoothness for the binary Pb–Sn perovskite films. Fig. 3A2 and B2 show the top-view SEM images of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films, respectively, prepared via the only-thermal annealing. All two films are densely packed with small grains and no pinholes. The surfaces are relatively rough due to different facets of each grain. The histogram of grain size distribution (Fig. 3A6 and B6) shows the average grain size is increased from 124 ± 53 to 158 ± 79 nm with the increasing of Sn content in CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskites for x = 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. Because of the smaller grains than the film thickness of ∼210 nm, many grain boundaries are across the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 film as shown in the cross-sectional view SEM images in Fig. 3A3. The CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 film has more single grains throughout the entire film thickness presumably due to the larger grains (Fig. 3B3). The thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing changed the morphology of films dramatically as shown in the top-view SEM images in Fig. 3A4 and B4. The grains of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 films are larger with some up to ∼1 μm. The top surface of each grain in the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 film is completely flat, indicating a single crystalline plane termination (Fig. 3A4). In-plane defects are clearly shown in the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 film (Fig. 3B4). The histogram of grain size distribution (Fig. 3A6 and B6) shows a clear increase of grain size, but the Sn content films have broader size distributions for all two films after the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. The cross-sectional view SEM images (Fig. 3A5 and B5) show that these films consistently have more single grains spanning the entirety of the films vertically.
Unlike the one-step solution process that makes the binary Pb–Sn perovskite polycrystalline films directly from the solutions of either pre-synthesized Pb–Sn perovskites2,24 or mixtures of lead halide, tin halide, and MAI,4 we fabricated the binary Pb–Sn iodide polycrystalline films first. The morphology, grain size, and grain orientation of Pb–Sn iodide films were significantly influenced by the amount of Sn substitutions as shown in Fig. 2 and S1.† After spin casting the MAI layer, we annealed the films with only-thermal annealing at 100 °C for 2 h, and with thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing at the same temperature for another 1 h. A previous study showed that the perovskite phase was completely formed after 1 h thermal annealing.17 Therefore, the DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing used here is different from that reported before,17 in which DMF (and DMSO) solvent annealing was performed right after the spin coating of MAI without the formation of a perovskite phase. It is reported that two DMSO attach to one Pb and a PbI2·2DMSO complex is formed,2 which retards the crystallization of PbI2.18,30 Based on the elemental analysis and XRD results, a MAI-PbI2-DMSO complex was proposed as a possible intermediate phase that can be formed from the solution with mixed solvents of DMSO and γ-butyrolactone (GBL).30 There are no reports on the interactions of DMSO to perovskites. Our results clearly showed that DMSO molecules interact with Pb–Sn perovskites. As illustrated in Fig. 4, because of the higher bond energy of Sn–O (528 kJ mol−1) than that of Pb–O (374 kJ mol−1),31 the possible preferential attachment of DMSO to Sn, via formation of the Sn–O bonds, breaks the Sn–I bonds, creates PbI64− octahedrons with iodide dangling bonds, and thus causes the rearrangement of Sn- and Pb-centered octahedrons and the growth of grains. In addition, DMSO may also function like a surfactant to guide the formation of flat surface of each grain. The strong (110) and (220) plane peaks in the XRD patterns suggest the grain surface could be the (110) plane of perovskites. The in-plane defects observed at the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite film surface could be caused by the strain due to more Pb segregated to the surface because of the larger ionic radius of Pb (1.49 Å) than that of Sn (1.35 Å).4 This effect is more pronounced when the Sn content is high. The in-plane defects might also be caused by the merging of different orientated perovskite grains originating from the differently orientated Sn0.25Pb0.75I2 plates as observed in Fig. 2C. For the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 perovskite film, the Sn0.1Pb0.9I2 polycrystalline grains are already orientated in the same direction, which facilitates the merge of small perovskite grains with the help of DMSO.
 Fig. 4  Schematics of the possible bond breaking of Sn–I (or Pb–I) in CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskite grains via DMSO attacking during the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing process. The rearrangement of SnI64− and PbI64− octahedrons leads to large, flat grains and the redistribution of Pb and Sn in grains. 
The XRD patterns, SEM images and histogram of grain size distribution of 10 and 25% Sn content perovskite films prepared via the thermal plus DMF vapor-assisted thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 5. Both films are still I4cm phase. Grains of each film are larger than their counterparts prepared via the only-thermal annealing, but smaller than those prepared via the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. Moreover, the grains have more irregular shapes and the surfaces are still rough. DMF and DMSO have different affinity to PbI2.4,27,31,32 Only one DMF coordinates to one Pb and needle like PbI2·DMF crystals can be formed with a layer of DMF on each side of the Pb–I–Pb sheet.27 The morphological difference could arise from the differences in the coordination ability to metal, the volatility, and the molecular structure of DMF compared to DMSO.

The perovskite layers prepared in different annealing processes were deployed in the solar cells with a planar heterojunction structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Al (Fig. 6A), where PEDOT:PSS acted as the hole transport layer, PC61BM/C60 as the electron transport layers, and BCP as the exciton blocking layer. The energy diagram of the perovskites CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 (x = 0, 0.25) and materials involved in the devices are displayed in Fig. 6B. While the valence band maxima are almost the same, the conduction band minimum is lower for CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3, resulting in a reduced band gap from 1.55 eV of CH3NH3PbI3 to 1.24 eV of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3.2Fig. 6C shows the J–V characteristics of the solar cells with the perovskite layers prepared by the only-thermal annealing and the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing under 1 sun AM 1.5G solar illumination. Table 1 summarizes the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill-factor (FF), and PCE derived from the J–V curves. For the solar cells with the only-thermal annealing prepared perovskite layers, the increased substitution of Pb with Sn leads to a significant increase in JSC from 13.9 ± 0.6 to 20.3 ± 0.9 mA cm−2 for the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 solar cells, respectively. The trend is in concord with a recent report even though the devices were fabricated with a configuration of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.2 The significantly increased JSC of the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite solar cells resulted in an average PCE of 8.45 ± 0.59% with a maximum PCE of 8.83% even though the VOC and FF were decreased. The performance is higher than the PCE of 7.37% with the same composition perovskite but different device structure and different perovskite film preparation method.2 While the improvement upon electronic properties resulting from the addition of Sn to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite plays a role in the increase of JSC,2,24 the larger grains of 10 and 25% Sn perovskite films also make contributions, especially for the 25% Sn perovskite film in which many single grains cross the entire film shown by the cross-sectional view SEM image (Fig. 3B3). The fewer grain boundaries across the film thickness reduce the charge carrier recombination at the grain boundary and therefore, results in higher JSC's.

The significant morphology changes of the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 (x = 0.1 and 0.25) perovskite films after the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing impact device performance. The CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 solar cells exhibit an average JSC of 19.0 ± 0.8 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.78 ± 0.2 V, and FF of 0.78 ± 0.2%, yielding an average PCE of 9.95 ± 0.51% and a maximum PCE of 10.25%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance for the solar cells with binary Pb–Sn triiodide perovskites.

J–V hysteresis has been observed in perovskite solar cells.14,16,33–36 The perovskite solar cell performance can strongly depend on the voltage scan directions or scan rates. The origin of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells has been ascribed to the slow dynamic processes originating from the trapping and detrapping of charge carriers, the ferroelectric properties of perovskites, and the ion migration in perovskites.33,34,36,37 Photocurrents of the typical CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite solar cells with the perovskite layers prepared via thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing were measured with the forward and reverse voltage scan and with the sweep delays of 50, 100, and 200 ms between measurement points, corresponding to the scan rates of 0.14, 0.07 and 0.04 V s−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2A and S2B,† no obvious J–V hysteresis was observed with the changes of the voltage scan directions and scan rates. The absence of hysteresis in the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite solar cells suggests that the fabrication method presented here can make large grains and prevent the J–V hysteresis in the devices.35
The UV-Vis spectra of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 films prepared via only-thermal and thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing were shown in Fig. S3.† The absorption onset of the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 film is redshifted compared to that of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 film prepared via only-thermal annealing (Fig. S3A†). The similar trend was observed for the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 and CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 films prepared via thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing (Fig. S3B†). The EQE spectra of these solar cells are shown in Fig. 6D. The solar cells containing the only-thermally annealed perovskites show a clear redshift of the absorption onset from 950 to 1010 nm for the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskites with x = 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. The absorption onsets of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 match the corresponding band gaps reported.2,8 No absorption onset or band gap has been reported for the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 perovskite. The absorption onset of 950 nm, equivalent to the band gap of 1.31 eV, follows the trend of the absorption onset shift and band gap narrowing of CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 from x = 0 to 0.75.2 The very high JSC for the only-thermal annealed CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 solar cells is truly because of the higher EQE over the entire wavelength range of 400–1010 nm. It is very interesting to observe that the different annealing processes do not vary the absorption onsets of each perovskite solar cell, but the spectral shapes change dramatically for the binary Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells. The thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealed CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 solar cells exhibit a significantly high EQE in the range of 500–700 nm with a peak EQE close to 90%. Because peak sun light flux occurs in this range, a high JSC of 19.0 mA cm−2 was obtained, leading to the best PCE of 10.25%.
The thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealed CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 solar cells exhibits a moderate EQE in the long wavelength range of 650–950 nm but a great drop of EQE in the range of 400–650 nm, which eventually results in a decrease of JSC from 20.3 to 17.7 mA cm−2. The EQE measurements revealed that the substitution of Sn caused the redshift of absorption onset from 950 to 1010 nm for 10% and 25% Sn binary Pb–Sn perovskites, respectively. While the absorption onsets stayed the same, the high EQE appeared in different wavelength ranges after the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. As a result, the solar cells containing 10% Sn (CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3) perovskite films made via the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing exhibited an average PCE of 9.95% and the maximum PCE of 10.25%. The change of EQE in different wavelength ranges caused by different annealing processes suggests the possible rearrangement of Sn and Pb in the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskites films due to the movement of octahedrons during the DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing process, which induces the change of the efficiency from photon absorption to charge generation, transport, and collection. Clearly, DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing provides a new way to manipulate binary Pb–Sn perovskite films to yield desired properties.
The device performance and the J–V characteristics of the thermal plus DMF vapor-assisted thermal annealed CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 (x = 0.1 and 0.25) perovskite solar cells are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 7. Compared to the only-thermal annealed perovskite solar cells, the PCEs of the CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 perovskite solar cells are increased by 10.5%, while the PCE of the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 solar cells is decreased by 12.4%. Although the grain size is increased slightly after the thermal plus DMF vapor-assisted thermal annealing, which increases JSC, the still relatively rough surfaces may cause the reduction of FF. With the increase of Sn, more Sn4+ could be produced which degrades the device performance as observed for the devices made via the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the two-step solution process with the thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing is an effective method to make binary Pb–Sn triiodide perovskite polycrystalline films, to increase the grain size, and to manipulate the grain orientation, the surface termination, and the Pb and Sn distribution in grains. The Sn substitution in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite resulted in the extension of absorption onset from 950 to 1010 nm for the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 perovskites with x = 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. The EQE of binary Pb–Sn triiodide perovskite solar cells was sensitive to the annealing processes. The highest PCE of 10.25% was achieved from the planar CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 perovskite solar cell with the thermal plus DMSO vapor-assisted thermal annealing. Because of the nature of an ionic crystal and the unique chemical structure of hybrid inorganic–organic perovskites, the solvent-assisted thermal annealing process could offer an easy yet effective way to manipulate material properties and to further increase perovskite solar cell performance.
