Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc., 1980, 70, 207-222Photoelectrochemical systems with energy storage(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Peter G. P. Ang and Anthony F. SammellsAbstractPhotoelectrochemical cells having the capability of energy storage are covered. Photoanodes used for these cells were selected from MoSe2, GaAs and CdSe. Redox electrolyte species present at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface included Br–/Br2(MoSe2), S2–/S2–n(CdSe) and Se2–/Se2–2(GaAs). Electroactive materials at the counter-electrode of the storage systems were I–I2, Se2–/Se2–2 and Cd.The performance of these photoelectrochemical storage cells for charge upon photoanode illumination and their subsequent electrochemical discharge is discussed.
