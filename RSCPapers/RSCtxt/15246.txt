    , Accepted 23rd December 2019First published on 2nd January 2020AbstractBlackening (or enhancing the optical absorption in the visible region) of nano-sized white semiconducting oxides (N-WSOs) is of significant importance for solar utilization. Here, we present a novel Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-based method for blackening the N-WSOs via facile one-step heating of the N-WSOs with alcohols. Taking n-butanol-induced blackening of TiO2 (anatase) as an example, the pristine TiO2 NP powders can be successfully blackened to form black TiO2 (B-TiO2) via heating with n-butanol at 300 °C for 20 min. Technical analyses demonstrate that the B-TiO2 nanocrystals are wrapped with a 2 nm thick disordered layer, which is rich in oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ and hydroxyl groups. Both theoretical and experimental results show that B-TiO2 has much stronger optical absorption in the visible region than pristine TiO2. Furthermore, the influence factors (including heating temperatures and alcohol types) and good universality of this blackening method are also demonstrated. A blackening principle based on Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-induced oxygen vacancy generation and hydroxylation-anchoring of oxygen vacancies has been proposed, and the mechanism can well explain all the phenomena observed in experiments. Importantly, such B-TiO2 shows hugely enhanced activity in solar photodegradation of dye pollutants. Under simulated solar irradiation, the degradation rate constant achieved by the B-TiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times that of the pristine TiO2, showing an obvious enhancement. Further experiments reveal that the improved degradation activity is mainly attributed to the enhanced optical absorption in the visible region and the synergistic photothermal and photocatalytic effect. This study demonstrates a new and facile approach to blacken the N-WSOs for enhanced solar utilization.
1 Introduction
Nano-sized white semiconducting oxides (N-WSOs), such as titania (TiO2), tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), etc. have great potential in the conversion and utilization of solar energy due to their strong charge separation abilities and excellent stabilities.1–5 However, the N-WSOs usually have wide bandgaps (>2.8 eV), and thus interact weakly with the visible light that accounts for about 50% of the total solar radiation energy.6 Therefore, improving the interaction between N-WSOs and the visible light is of great significance for pursuing high efficiency solar energy devices.
To enhance the N-WSOs’ optical absorption in the visible region, some strategies including the composite method,7–15 structure-induced “light trap”16–21 and element doping22–33 have been proposed and developed. For the composite method, the N-WSOs are usually compounded with some substances (or visible light absorbers) that have strong absorption in the visible region to form a composite. These visible light absorbers include metals (such as Ag,7 Au,8 Pt,10etc.), carbon materials (such as carbon nanotubes,11 graphene,12 fullerenes,14etc.), and some oxide semiconductors (such as Fe2O3,13 CuO,15etc.). Although this is an efficient method which utilizes the synergy functions of the N-WSOs with the absorbers, it suffers from the complexity of synthesis.
For the structure-induced “light trap”, the N-WSOs are usually constructed into complex hierarchical or branched structures, which can cause the “light trap” effect and enhance light harvesting in the visible region. For example, Cho et al. reported that branched TiO2 nanorod arrays can enhance optical absorption and the ability of photoelectrochemical hydrogen production in the visible region.16 Generally, the fabrication of such a complex structure is usually tedious and difficult to be performed on a large scale. In addition, the optical absorption ability of the N-WSOs enhanced by this method is usually very limited.
For the element doping, it includes self-doping and foreign element doping. Usually, these doped N-WSOs have several nano-thick disordered layers on the surface. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results have demonstrated that these disordered layers play an important role in improving the visible light absorption. Self-doping causes oxygen vacancies in N-WSOs’ lattice, forming non-stoichiometric compounds, through thermal reductions with reductants (H2, Al, Zn, Mg, etc.).24,31–36 In general, high temperature (300–800 °C) is required for such reductions. For example, Wang et al. prepared black TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using Al as a reductant in an evacuated two-zone vacuum furnace at 300–500 °C.33 Foreign element doping refers to the introduction of metallic elements (such as Co, Cd, Ag, etc.)26–28 or non-metallic elements (such as B, I, S, H, etc.)25,30 into the host N-WSOs. For instance, Lu et al. doped Co into ZnO through a facile hydrothermal process to improve the optical absorption and photocatalytic activity in the visible region.26 Nonmetallic foreign element doping is usually performed by a two-step process. The first step is to form a large number of oxygen vacancies in N-WSOs by thermal reduction, and then to incorporate the foreign nonmetallic elements into N-WSOs by oxidation with the corresponding foreign elemental substance. For example, Lin et al. synthesized a series of foreign nonmetallic element (H, N, S and I) doped black TiO2 by such a two-step method.30 Generally, most of such blackening processes require high temperature, long periods and complex equipment.
Herein, we present a novel and facile blackening method for the N-WSOs based on the Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism via one-step heating the N-WSOs with alcohols. The blackening process mainly includes Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-based oxygen vacancy generation and surface hydroxylation-anchoring of oxygen vacancies. By taking the n-butanol induced blackening of TiO2 (anatase) NPs as an example, the principle of this method has been demonstrated. The pristine TiO2 powders can be blackened to form the black TiO2 (B-TiO2) after simple heating with n-butanol at 300 °C for 20 min. Technical analyses reveal that the TiO2 NPs are wrapped with a 2 nm thick disordered layer, which is rich in oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ and hydroxyl groups. Both theoretical and experimental results show that B-TiO2 has much stronger visible absorption than pristine TiO2. Further experiments show that the heating temperatures, and the types of alcohol are crucial to the blackening process. Alcohols with high boiling point contribute to the long actual time of the reaction between alcohols and TiO2, and thus form a better blackening effect. Optimal heating temperature around 300 °C is conducive to the occurrence of the Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism and does not destroy the surface hydroxyl which protects the oxygen vacancies, thus providing a good blackening effect. Importantly, such a blackening method is universal, and some other N-WSOs such as SnO2, ZnO and rutile TiO2 NPs can also be blackened using the same method. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that such B-TiO2 can be used as a highly efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of dye pollutants. Under simulated solar irradiation, the degradation rate constant obtained with the B-TiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times that obtained with the pristine TiO2 catalyst, showing an obvious enhancement. Further experiments show that the enhancement should be mainly attributed to the enhanced optical absorption in the visible region and the synergistic photothermal and photocatalytic effect. Finally, stable recycling performance of the B-TiO2 has also been demonstrated; with six cycles of degradation, the degradation efficiency has no obvious decrease.
2 Experimental methods
2.1 Chemicals
TiO2 (anatase) nanocrystal (about 30 nm in mean size) powders, methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), n-butanol [CH3(CH2)3OH], 1-octanol [CH3(CH2)7OH] and methylene blue (MB) used in our experiments all were analytical reagents purchased from Alfa Aesar Corporation. Deionized water produced by a Millipore Milli-Q system with a resistivity of about 18.2 MΩ cm (25 °C) was used in our experiments.
2.2 Blackening process
The blackening processes were performed by one-step heating of N-WSOs with alcohols. Here, we take the n-butanol induced blackening of TiO2 NPs as an example to demonstrate such a process.
Typically, 2 g of pristine TiO2 powders were added into a crucible with 2 mL n-butanol. After 2 min of stirring and 10 min of standing for homogenization, the crucible with a TiO2/n-butanol slurry mixture was transferred to a tubular furnace, and then heated to a temperature of 300 °C in air for 20 min. After that, the powders turned adobe brown in color, forming the B-TiO2. Finally, the B-TiO2 powders were filled into a glass bottle for further analyses and uses.
2.3 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on an X′ Pert Philips diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (0.154056 nm). The Raman measurements were performed on a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman spectrometer equipped with a 633 nm incident laser with a power density of 1.7 mW μm−2 and an integral time of 5 s. The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer with an integrating sphere. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were made on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, USA) equipped with an Oxford IE250X-Max50 energy dispersion spectroscope (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted using an Al Kα X-ray source on a Thermo-VG ESCALAB MKII spectrometer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Thermo Nicolet Corporation, NEXUS). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker (EMXPLUS10/12) paramagnetic resonance spectrometer.
2.4 Photodegradation of MB
The photodegradation performances of the B-TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 catalysts were estimated by using the MB as simulated target pollutants. In a typical case, 200 mg of the B-TiO2 or the pristine TiO2 powders were added into a beaker with 50 mL of MB aqueous solution (100 mg L−1). After 1 min of ultrasound-assisted dispersion, the mixed solution was kept in the dark for 1 h to reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Afterwards, a 300 W xenon lamp with a filter (filtering out the light below 400 nm) was used for the simulated solar irradiation in photodegradation. During the degradation, the irradiation was suspended every 5 minutes to measure the absorption spectrum of the MB solution. The spectral evolution was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer.
2.5 Photocurrent and impedance measurements
The transient photocurrent and AC impedance measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E, CH Instruments, Inc.) under xenon lamp irradiation with 50 W illumination power. A three-electrode quartz cell filled with 50 mL aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.0) was used. The catalyst powders were spin coated onto pieces of FTO glass (1 cm × 1 cm). The coating amounts of the two catalysts were the same, 0.1 mg. Copper wires were connected to catalyst films by silver slurry. The joints and the glass edges were sealed with the resin to avoid current leakage thus forming the working electrode. A Pt net and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The impedance measurements were operated with the simulated sun irradiation and an alternating current amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range from 1 to 100 kHz.
3 Results and discussion
The blackening of TiO2 was typically performed via one-step heating of the pristine TiO2 with n-butanol at 300 °C for 20 min, as shown in Fig. 1a. The white pristine TiO2 powders (as shown at the left lower corner of Fig. 1a) turned dark and formed the B-TiO2 (as shown at the right lower corner of Fig. 1a) after the heating. Optical absorption spectra show that the B-TiO2 has hugely enhanced optical absorption in the visible region, and the corresponding absorptivity ranges from 60% to 80%, which is much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 (4% to 10%), as shown in Fig. 1b. Further analysis reveals that the band gap is narrowed after the blackening. The band gaps are calculated according to the Kubelka–Munk formula (eqn (1))37 and Tauc relationship (eqn (2)),38,39 α ∝ (1 − R)2/2R(1) αhν = K(hν − E)2(2)where α, R, hν, K, and E are respectively the absorption coefficient, reflectivity, the photo-energy of incident light, a constant and the band gap. The calculated band gap of the B-TiO2 is about 2.61 eV, which is about 0.56 eV narrower than that of the pristine TiO2 (3.17 eV).

3.1 The microstructural evolution
To investigate the changes of microstructures of TiO2 NPs before and after blackening, TEM observations were made. The TEM examination indicates that the TiO2 nanocrystals have no obvious changes in the morphology after the blackening; both the B-TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 are NPs with mean sizes at about 30 nm, as shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a.† However, the high resolution (HR)-TEM images illustrate some significant changes on the nanocrystal surface after the blackening. A typical HRTEM image of a typical isolated B-TiO2 NP presented in Fig. 2b shows that the nanocrystal is in the core–shell structure. In the inner core, clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm match well with anatase 101 crystalline planes (JCPDS card No. 01-084-1285). The wrapping layer is about 2 nm in thickness but no obvious lattice fringes can be observed, showing disordered nature. This is much different from the pristine TiO2 nanocrystals, which have no obvious disordered layer on the surface, as shown in Fig. S1b.† It should be pointed that such a disordered layer has been widely reported in the B-TiO2.24,28–30 The corresponding EDS spectrum (Fig. S2†) of the B-TiO2 NP shows the existence of the Ti and O elements in addition to the C and Cu, which should be from the carbon film and copper mesh for supporting the sample. Moreover, the elemental mappings (inset of Fig. 2b) show that the Ti and O are evenly distributed in the NP, and no other elements are observed in the disordered shell region.

Fig. 2c shows the XRD patterns of the B-TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 powders. Both patterns of the B-TiO2 and pristine TiO2 show all the diffraction peaks of the standard anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 01-084-1285). The Raman spectra of B-TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 are presented in Fig. 2d, and all the spectra show the typical Raman pattern of the anatase.40 However, it should be pointed that a blue shift by about 8 cm−1 of the Eg mode (around 145 cm−1) is observed after blackening. This can be directly correlated with oxygen deficiencies on the TiO2 surface, as reported in the previous studies.24,33
To analyze the surface composition of the core–shell structured B-TiO2 NPs, XPS analyses were thus performed. The corresponding XPS full survey spectra show the existence of Ti and O in addition to C (for reference) both in the pristine TiO2 and the core–shell structured B-TiO2 NPs, as shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 2e shows the Ti 2p1/2 spectra. For the pristine TiO2, the peak at 458.6 eV corresponds to Ti4+. For the B-TiO2, in addition to the Ti4+ band at 458.6 eV, a relatively weak Ti3+ band at 457.7 eV can also be observed, suggesting the existence of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies in the B-TiO2.41,42Fig. 2f presents the spectra of O 1s; both the pristine TiO2 and the B-TiO2 show two bands at 529.9 eV and 532.1 eV, corresponding to the Ti4+–O–Ti, and Ti4+–O–H, respectively.24,43 However, by comparison, the Ti4+–O–H band of the B-TiO2 is significantly stronger than that of the pristine TiO2, indicating very abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of the B-TiO2.
To further confirm the hydroxyl groups on the B-TiO2, FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2g) measurements were performed. The characteristic bands of hydroxyl groups near 1640 cm−1 and 3360 cm−1 can be observed both in the pristine and blackened TiO2. The band at 1640 cm−1 should originate from the O–H bending mode, and the band around 3360 cm−1 should be attributed to the stretching mode of the Ti4+–O–H.44,45 Importantly, the B-TiO2 should have more hydroxyl groups on the surface due to the much stronger signal intensity.
The EPR spectral measurements further confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies in B-TiO2, and the correlation results are shown in Fig. 2h. B-TiO2 shows superparamagnetic resonance behavior of oxygen vacancies at g = 2.003, which is consistent with previous studies,22,29 while the original TiO2 has only very weak resonances. These indicate that B-TiO2 has a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, which is in good agreement with the XPS measurement results.
Based on the above results, after blackening, the 2 nm thick disordered layer on the TiO2 NPs containing oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ and Ti4+–OH can be produced, forming the B-TiO2, as illustrated in Fig. 2i.
3.2 Influence factors
The further experiments reveal that the alcohol types and the heating temperatures are crucial for the blackening.

3.2.1 Types of alcohol. 

Fig. 3a shows the corresponding absorption spectra of the TiO2 powders before and after heating with various alcohols at 300 °C. These different alcohols exhibit different blackening effects. With the increase of the carbon content of alcohols, the products obtained are blacker, indicating stronger optical absorption in the visible region. The absorption of 1-octanol blackened TiO2 is as high as 76% to 89% in the visible region. Meanwhile, the band gaps of these blackened TiO2 all decrease to some extent compared with that of the pristine TiO2, as shown in Fig. S4a.† The maximum of gap decrease is about 0.8 eV, which corresponds to 1-octanol.

3.2.2 Heating temperatures. 
Further studies have shown that the temperature plays a key role in the blackening. At low heating temperatures (180 to 300 °C), the increase of temperature can make the B-TiO2 powders darker and the band gaps narrower. However, over high temperatures (>300 °C) will induce negative blackening. The optimal blackening temperature in our experiment is about 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S4b.†

3.3 Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-based blackening
The blackening mechanism should include two processes: Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-based oxygen vacancy formation and surface hydroxylation-anchoring of oxygen vacancies, as typically shown in Fig. 4a.
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic illustration of the alcohol induced blackening. (b) The crystal structures of the complete anatase cell (I) and anatase cell with a hydroxyl-anchored oxygen vacancy (II). (c and d) The density of states (DOS) of the complete anatase cell (c) and the anatase cell with a hydroxyl-anchored oxygen vacancy (d). 

3.3.1 Oxygen vacancy formation and hydroxylation-anchoring. 
The Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism has been widely applied to explain the catalytic effect of transition-metal oxide catalysts.46–49 This mechanism describes a catalytic process in which the metal oxide surface is directly involved via its most reactive surface lattice oxygen atoms to oxidize target molecules. In the process of catalysis, the oxygen vacancies on the metal oxide surface will be produced, and the color of the catalyst will be changed.46–49 In our case, after the heating of TiO2 nanocrystals with alcohols, TiO2 catalytically oxidizes the alcohols via the Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism, or as described by eqn (3), (3)where Olattice, C, VO and C′ respectively present the lattice oxygen atom, alcohols, oxygen vacancy and oxidation products of alcohols. As a result, a large number of oxygen vacancies will be generated on the surface of TiO2 nanocrystals, as shown in (I) and (II) in Fig. 4a. Many previous reports have shown that these oxygen vacancies can cause the band gap to be narrowed by extending the band top and tail to the gap.22,24
In the catalytic process described by the typical Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism, when the catalysis is completed, oxygen in the air will occupy these oxygen vacancy lattices again, thus restoring the color of the metal oxide catalyst. However, in our experiments, due to the hydroxyl groups of alcohols, the most superficial Ti4+ on the surface of TiO2 nanocrystals is bonded with hydroxyl groups, which prevent the oxygen from entering the nanocrystals due to their steric hindrance effect, thus retaining the oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ in the crystal surface after the temperature drops. A disordered surface is thus formed, as shown in (III) in Fig. 4a.


3.3.2 Theoretical consideration. 
Many theoretical calculations have shown that oxygen vacancies on the anatase surface can narrow the band gap and enhance the optical absorption in the visible region.22,24 Here, we consider the effect of surface hydroxyl protected oxygen vacancies on anatase in the band gap. We have calculated the density of states (DOS) distributions of a complete anatase cell (I in Fig. 4b) and a anatase cell with a hydroxyl protected oxygen vacancy (II in Fig. 4b) using the density functional theory (DFT). The general gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Enzerhof (PBE) functional was used to describe the exchange correlation effects in our cases50–52 (see the ESI† for details). It is worth pointing out that the optimized anatase cell with a hydroxyl protected oxygen vacancy is distorted greatly. This is in agreement with the disordered layer on the surface of the B-TiO2, as shown in Fig. 2b. Corresponding calculations show that such an anatase cell with a hydroxyl-anchoring oxygen vacancy also has a narrow band gap, and the band gap is reduced by about 1.2 eV compared to that of intact anatase, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. It should be pointed out that although the calculated values are relatively smaller than the actual band gap values due to the well-known self-interaction induced underbinding of the localized Ti 3d states, the GGA-PBE method is still a widely accepted approach to qualitatively describe the band gap changes caused by the defect states.51,52


3.3.3 Good agreement with the experimental phenomena. 
The different blackening effects of alcohols should be attributed to the difference of their boiling points. It is well known that with the increase of carbon content, the boiling points of alcohols gradually increase. In our system (shown in Fig. 1a), most of the alcohols become steam after heating and are taken away by air flow. Alcohols with low boiling point are more likely to evaporate and be taken away, thus reducing the interaction time with TiO2, which is not conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the TiO2. Therefore, with the increase of the carbon content, the blackening effect is improved, as shown in Fig. 3a. Furthermore, we designed an experiment to verify this. We blackened the TiO2 powders at 300 °C with the argon-loaded alcohol vapor flow instead of air flow. In such a system, the boiling point of alcohols does not affect the reaction time of alcohols and TiO2 due to the continuous and stable input of alcohol vapor, so the reaction time for blackening can be well controlled and aligned. The results show that methanol and n-butanol have a similar blackening effect with the same reaction time of 2 h (see Fig. S5†). This is quite different from the result shown in Fig. 3a. Therefore, the influence of boiling point of alcohols on the blackening effect in our system (shown in Fig. 1a) is confirmed.
At low heating temperatures (180 to 300 °C), the increase of temperature is helpful to the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism-type catalysis due to the heating improved oxygen vacancy formation and lattice oxygen atom migration.46–49 Therefore, more oxygen vacancies will be generated on the surface of the TiO2 nanocrystals, resulting in a better blackening effect. However, excessively high temperatures (>300 °C) will induce the desorption of the hydroxyl group, according to the previous reports.53,54 Without the protection of the hydroxyl groups, the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism-formed oxygen vacancies will be oxidized by the oxygen in air, resulting in a low blackening efficiency. A further experiment also strongly supports this deduction, if we heat such B-TiO2 powders at 400 °C to remove the hydroxyl groups, the powders gradually turn white, as typically shown in Fig. S6.† Therefore, with the increase of temperature, the blackening efficiency increases first and then decreases, as shown in Fig. 3b.


3.3.4 The good universality. 
According to the above blackening mechanism, this presented method should be universal. To illustrate the universality of this method, we prepared some other N-WSOs including ZnO, SnO2 and rutile TiO2 nanocrystals. ZnO and SnO2 were synthesized according to methods in previous reports55,56 (see the ESI† for details), and rutile TiO2 was purchased commercially (from Alfa Aesar Corporation, 60 nm). With the same blackening methods and conditions (heating with n-butanol at 300 °C), we also blackened the ZnO, SnO2 and rutile TiO2 nanocrystal powders, as shown in Fig. 5a–c. This suggests the good universality of this blackening method.

4 Enhanced solar photodegradation
As mentioned before, blackened N-WSOs have great potential in the utilization of the solar energy. In our case, the n-butanol induced B-TiO2 also has good capacity in the solar photodegradation of dye pollutants. By using MB as a simulated dye pollutant and comparison with pristine TiO2, we evaluated the degradation activity of the B-TiO2.

Fig. 6a and b show the evolution of the MB optical absorption spectrum during degradation with the use of B-TiO2 and pristine TiO2, respectively. Both B-TiO2 and pristine TiO2 catalysts can degrade the MB with the irradiation according to the decrease of the characteristic absorption peak of MB around 660 nm, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. It should be pointed that after 1 h of dark treatment, the absorption peaks of MB solutions containing two catalysts have very slight changes in intensity, indicating that the adsorption equilibria are reached. In contrast, the B-TiO2 catalyst has a much higher degradation activity than the pristine TiO2. For the B-TiO2 catalyst, degradation of all the MB is almost completed within 40 min, while, for the pristine TiO2, about 81.2% MB is degraded within the same duration, as shown in Fig. 6c. It should be pointed out that no obvious degradation can be observed in the control group (without catalysts). Quantitatively, if we describe the degradation with a pseudo-first-order reaction mode,57,58 −ln(C/C0) = kt(4)where k and t are the kinetic rate constant and irradiation duration, and C0 and C denote the initial and real-time concentration of MB, respectively. Although the activity difference between them is not obvious, the rate constant of B-TiO2 is about 2.3 times that of pristine TiO2, or the catalytic efficiency of B-TiO2 is much higher than that of TiO2. It can be found that the B-TiO2 catalyst achieves a rate constant (k value) of 0.086 min−1, which is about 2.3 times that of the pristine TiO2 (0.037 min−1), as shown in Fig. 6d. Additionally, we evaluated the stability of the B-TiO2 catalyst. During the six consecutive cycles, the catalyst can degrade at least 95% MB within 40 min (see Fig. 6e) in every cycle, showing good recyclability.

Furthermore, to investigate the role of the visible light in the degradation process, we performed degradation under the visible light irradiation (>400 nm) by cutting out the light below 400 nm with a filter. Fig. 7a shows the evolution of MB concentration during the degradation. It can be seen that the degradation efficiencies are decreased compared with simulated solar irradiation for these two (B-TiO2 and pristine TiO2) catalysts. After 40 minutes of irradiation with the visible light, the B-TiO2 degrades 79.8% of MB, and pristine TiO2 degrades 14.2% of MB. For the rate constant, the B-TiO2 achieves a k value of 0.031 min−1, and the pristine TiO2 achieves a k value of 0.003 min−1. Combining the data in Fig. 6c and d, the photocatalytic ability of pristine TiO2 mainly excited in the ultraviolet region, and the photocatalytic ability of the B-TiO2 can be driven in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions. Moreover, such hugely enhanced catalytic activity of B-TiO2 in the visible light is comparable to that of the TiO2 under UV light. Therefore, compared with the pristine TiO2, the catalytic activity of the B-TiO2 catalyst is solely doubled under the simulated sun irradiation.

(e) The plots of −ln(C/C0) versus t. (f) Schematic illustration of the synergistic photothermal and photocatalysis effect. 
Further experiments show that the enhanced degradation activity of the B-TiO2 should be attributed to the synergistic photothermal and photocatalytic effect. Fig. 7c shows the temperature evolution of the MB solution with the B-TiO2 and TiO2 catalysts during degradation. It can be found that the B-TiO2 can raise the temperature of the MB solution to 78 °C, while pristine TiO2 can only raise the temperature of the solution to about 42 °C. This indicates that the B-TiO2 has better photothermal conversion ability. Therefore, two experiments were designed to verify the synergistic photothermal and photocatalytic degradation, and the results are presented in Fig. 7d. By keeping MB solution in a 0 °C ice water bath with the simulated solar irradiation for catalysis, 49.7% of MB was degraded after 40 min. By keeping the MB solution at 78 °C in the dark for simple thermal degradation without any irradiation, 14.1% of MB was degraded after 40 min. Correspondingly, Fig. 7e shows that the two degradation rate constants are 0.016 min−1 and 0.006 min−1, respectively. In comparison, the typical k value (0.086 min−1, presented in Fig. 6d) is about 5.4 and 14.3 times these two rate constants. Moreover, the linear sum (0.022 min−1) of these two constants is still much smaller than the typical value, showing great synergetic photo-thermocatalytic degradation. This could be attributed to the photo-induced heating, which enhances the separation of electrons and holes and improves the photocatalytic performance,59 as shown in Fig. 7f.
To further confirm the enhancement of the electron and hole separation in the B-TiO2 catalyst, the photocurrent and impedance spectrum measurements were performed. The data show that the B-TiO2 harvests a photocurrent density of 2.1 μA cm−2, which is about 4 times higher than that from the pristine TiO2 film (0.4 μA cm−2), as shown in Fig. 8a. This suggests the obviously enhanced electron and hole generation and separation.60,61 The impedance spectra (Fig. 8b) also show the smoothed carrier transport in the B-TiO2. The corresponding Nyquist curves of both the TiO2 and pristine TiO2 show the semicircles at high frequencies whose diameters represent the charge transfer resistance (Rct), indicating the ease of charge transfer. In contrast, the Rct value of the B-TiO2 is about 830 Ω, while that of the pristine B-TiO2 is about 1660 Ω. This indicates that the B-TiO2 has a smoother carrier transport.61 The enhanced separation of electrons and holes and the smooth carrier transport should be responsible for the improved photocatalytic degradation performance.

5 Conclusions and remarks
We present a facile and rapid blackening process of the N-WSOs via one-step heating with alcohols. Taking the n-butanol induced blackening of anatase TiO2 NPs as an example, the pristine TiO2 powders turn into B-TiO2 powders after heating the pristine TiO2 with n-butanol at 300 °C for 20 min. Technical analyses demonstrate that the B-TiO2 NPs are wrapped with a 2 nm thick disordered layer, which is rich in oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ and hydroxyl groups. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the blackened TiO2 (B-TiO2) has much stronger visible absorption compared with the pristine TiO2. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the heating temperatures, and the types of alcohol are crucial to the blackening. Importantly, such a method is universal; some other N-WSOs such as SnO2 and ZnO NPs can also be blackened using the same method. The reason for the blackening is attributed to stable oxygen vacancies, which are produced through Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism-based oxygen vacancy formation and subsequent hydroxylation-anchoring. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that such B-TiO2 can be used as a highly efficient photocatalyst for degradation of dye pollutants. Under simulated solar irradiation, the degradation rate constant corresponding to the B-TiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times that corresponding to the pristine TiO2 catalyst, showing an obvious enhancement. Further experiments reveal that the B-TiO2 has good photocatalytic activity from the ultraviolet to the near infrared regions, which is quite different from the pristine TiO2 with high photocatalytic activity only in the ultraviolet region. The high degradation activity should be attributed to the synergistic effect of high photocatalysis and good photothermal conversion of the B-TiO2. Finally, highly stable recycling performance of the B-TiO2 has also been demonstrated; with six cycles of degradation, the degradation effect has no obvious decrease.
This work proposes a simple, controllable, versatile, high-yield and easy-to-mass-produce method for blackening the N-WSOs. The new blackening method utilizes the extraction of lattice oxygen in the metal oxide by the Mars–van-Krevelen mechanism to form oxygen vacancies and the protection effect of the hydroxyl groups. This is much different from the existing method of blackening the N-WSOs. In addition, these blackened N-WSOs exhibit good photothermal and photocatalytic synergistic photodegradability, a feature that has not been reported and discussed in single component catalysts. We believe that this work provides a good method and theoretical basis for blackening N-WSOs, and has important positive significance for the development of high-efficiency solar materials and devices.
