    , Accepted 20th August 2017First published on 21st August 2017AbstractN-type conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are promising electron transport materials (ETMs) in high-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). The regulation of the counterions of CPEs can efficiently tune the properties of CPEs as well as their photovoltaic performance. In this contribution, we report a series of counterion-tunable n-type CPEs for the interface engineering of polymer solar cells, and the size, species and substituent groups of the counterions are discussed. The size of counterions had a great impact on the alcohol solubility and photophysical properties of CPEs. Besides, the self-doping behaviors of these CPEs are also highly correlated with their counterion species. Moreover, the charge transport and electrode modification study results show that the counterion species and their substituent groups are critical to the electron mobilities and electrode modification ability of these CPEs as well as their performance in PSCs. PSCs with these CPEs as ETMs can deliver high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10.5%, and over 9.5% PCE can be maintained even when these CPEs are used as thick (80 nm) ETMs, indicating great potential of using these CPEs as thickness-insensitive ETMs for the fabrication of future large-area PSCs using roll-to-roll techniques.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have experienced a rapid development in the past several years due to successful developments in donor/acceptor materials, morphology optimization, processing methods, interface engineering, device architectures, etc.1–13 A large number of high-performance donors/acceptors have been developed to achieve good absorption spectra and energy level alignment as well as blend morphologies, which work synergistically to maximum the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs.3–5,11,12 Besides, great achievements have also been made in the development of novel electron transport materials (ETMs), which play a vital role in transporting the generated current to the cathode of PSCs.7,8,14–16 ETMs serve as a bridge between the active layer and cathode electrode to facilitate electron transportation and collection at the cathode, leading to an improvement in the device performance.7,8,14–18
Traditional organic ETMs with polar side chains and conjugated backbones (such as PFN) can enable very high-performance PSCs.19–21 However, the intrinsic p-type backbone and low electron mobility hinder their application as thick ETMs in the fabrication of large-area PSCs using roll-to-roll (R2R) techniques.22 The performance of PSCs with traditional organic ETMs declines quickly with an increased thickness of ETMs, which is contradictory to the requirement for the processing of large-scale PSCs that the deposited film should work efficiently with a large thickness to withstand rough substrates and obtain a good reproducibility.22,23 High-mobility n-type conjugated polymer/small molecules with polar side chains have a good chance to act as high-performance ETMs for R2R processed PSCs since they are endowed with a gift of fabricating thick films.24–30 Moreover, they can also enable improved electron collection at the cathode in PSCs by lowering the work function of metal electrode, blocking holes, inducing interface doping, etc.7,8,14–16
Recently, naphthalene diimide (NDI) based n-type water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers or conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) have emerged as an important kind of ETMs for organic optoelectronic devices.28,30 The high electron affinity and electron mobility characteristics31,32 of NDI-based CPEs can provide good energy alignment and facilitate electron transportation and collection at the cathode of PSCs. For example, Liu et al. reported a NDI-based conjugated polymer zwitterion-PT2NDISB, which shows high mobility and can enable high-performance PSCs with PCE over 10%.28 We previously reported a neutral amino-functionalized conjugated polymer PNDIT-F3N and an ammonium-functionalized conjugated polyelectrolyte PNDIT-F3N–Br.30 It was found that the amino-functionalized PNDIT-F3N showed photoinduced conductivity-enhancing properties, while the bromide-quaternized polymer PNDIT-F3N–Br can be self-doped without light. These results showed that polar side chains could induce varied doping behaviors to n-type conjugated backbones. Moreover, the versatility of the counterions of n-type CPEs may lead to various features and enable diverse properties. However, n-type CPEs with varied counterions are rarely studied. It has been reported that different counterions can enable different interactions with n-type small molecules,33–35 and thus it is quite reasonable to tune the properties of n-type semiconductors by varying the type of counterion. Moreover, conjugated polymers show greatly enhanced complexity both in chemical and physical properties (such as solubility, polymer structures, thin-film morphology and charge transport properties) compared to small molecules. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the correlation between the counterion species in CPEs and their properties and photovoltaic performance.
Herein, we present a facile method to tune the opto-electronic properties of novel CPEs (shown in Scheme 1) by altering their counterions. By functionalizing the parent CPE-PNDIT-F3N–Br using counterion-exchanging procedures, CPEs with different counterions (F−, Cl−, BIm4− and BArF4−) were obtained. The size of counterions can tune the alcohol solubility and photophysical properties of CPEs. Besides, the counterion species have a high impact on the self-doping behaviors of these CPEs, which was evidenced by the UV-vis-NIR absorption and ESR study. Counterions with stronger electron-donating abilities in CPEs can improve the doping process. Moreover, PNDIT-F3N–BArF4, which possesses strong electron-withdrawing substituent groups in its counterions, can preclude the self-doping behavior and increase the work function of metal electrodes and impede electron transport. CPEs with optimized counterions possess high electron mobility and show less thickness-dependence, indicating their great promise as thick ETMs for organic opto-electronic devices. By using these CPEs as thin ETMs and NT812 (ref. 36)/PC71BM (structures are shown Fig. 4) as the donor/acceptor, PSCs with PCE up to 10.5% can be achieved. These CPEs can also be used as thick (80 nm) ETMs for high-performance PSCs with PCE over 9.5%, indicating the great potential of using these CPEs as thickness-insensitive ETMs for the fabrication of large-area PSCs using R2R techniques.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
PNDIT-F3N–Br with ammonium bromide salt as side chains was prepared according to our previously published paper.30 The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PNDIT-F3N–Br were estimated from its neutral precursor polymer PDINT-F3N, which delivered an Mn and Mw of 12.3 kDa and 20.9 kDa, and thus the Mn and Mw of PNDIT-F3N–Br were calculated to be 15.0 kDa and 25.5 kDa, respectively. Taking PNDIT-F3N–Br as the precursor, other CPEs (PNDIT-F3N–F, PNDIT-F3N–Cl, PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4) with counterions of F−, Cl−, BIm4− and BArF4− were prepared using a counterion-exchanging procedure37 (shown in Scheme 1) in a mixture of methanol and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with high yields from 81% to 92%. The prepared CPEs were characterized by XPS, which can be used to identify the counterion-exchanging grade. The XPS spectra of the CPEs (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) confirmed greater than 99% bromide exchange, indicating the successful preparation of these CPEs containing different counterions. It should be noted that these CPEs with different counterions possess the same conjugation length, thus providing a good template to study the doping behaviors and photovoltaic performance by exempting the potential difference caused by the conjugation length of the backbones of CPEs. CPEs are well known to be soluble in pure water/alcohol-like polar solvents, which is not only environmentally friendly, but also beneficial for the fabrication of multi-layer thin films since most of the processing solvents for conjugated polymers are non-polar.8,15 Here, the methanol solubility of these CPEs showed much dependence on the size of their counterions. PNDIT-F3N–F with F− as the counterion shows the lowest solubility of around 10 mg mL−1 in methanol, while CPEs with Cl− and Br− show slightly higher solubility of about 15–18 mg mL−1 in methanol. PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4, with the larger counterions, show the highest solubility of over 20 mg mL−1 in methanol, which can be attributed to the much-reduced interaction between polymer backbones caused by the large attached counterions. More importantly, the high solubility of these CPEs in methanol will enable the fabrication of high-quality films with an increased thickness using environmentally friendly solvents, which will be advantageous for the mass fabrication of PSCs using R2R techniques.22 The CPEs can form high-quality films with low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, which can be evidenced by their atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography (as shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). The thermal stability of these CPEs was investigated using TGA measurements and the results show that these CPEs possess high thermal stability with Tds (decomposition temperatures) over 220 °C (shown in Fig. S3, ESI†), which ensures their application in organic opto-electronic devices.
Photophysical properties
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of these CPEs in solution and film states were recorded and the corresponding curves are shown in Fig. 1, S4 and S5.† The methanol solutions of these CPEs were firstly prepared for the measurement (the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). It can be observed that all the CPEs showed almost the same absorption bands in the range below 500 nm and between 500 and 800 nm, in which the first absorption band below 500 nm was the π–π* characteristic of the polymer backbones, and the second absorption band between 500 and 800 nm was attributable to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) inside the polymer. Since protic solvents (such as water and methanol) could hinder the electron transfer from counterions to π-conjugated electron accepting groups,34 an aprotic solvent-N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was selected to characterize the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of these CPEs and the resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 2a. It can be found that the π–π* characteristics of the polymer backbones are the same for all the CPEs in NMP solution. However, in the low-energy absorption band, the absorption spectrum of PNDIT-F3N–F declines slightly compared to that of CPEs with other counterions.

Meanwhile, very weak absorption bands ranging from 750 to 850 nm with peaks at 815 nm emerged, which can be attributed to the formation of radical anions.38–40 However, CPEs with other counterions show no absorption bands from 750 to 850 nm, indicating the relatively weak electron transfer between these counterions and the n-type backbone, which is similar to the case of perylene diimide (PDI) based polyelectrolytes.38 In the thin-film state, these CPEs showed varied absorption spectra in the low-energy absorption bands in the range of 500–800 nm, which are highly dependent on the size of counterions. Particularly, CPEs with large counterions delivered blue-shifted ICT absorption bands. The absorption bands of PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 are 20 nm and 55 nm blue-shifted compared to those of CPEs with other counterions. This phenomenon can be explained by the much reduced interaction between polymer backbones caused by large-sized counterions.41 The characteristic of radical anions was reported to be observed in the thin film of polyelectrolytes through a thermal-treatment to trigger the electron transfer from counterions to π-conjugated electron-accepting groups.38 In our cases, the characteristic of radical anions of these CPEs can only be observed in an annealed thin film of PNDIT-F3N–F (shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). Excess counterions were added into the CPE films and post-thermal treatments were applied to further study the correlation of doping behaviors and absorption spectra of these CPEs. It can be observed that only PNDIT-F3N–F fivefold excess (molar ratio) of TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) possesses apparent absorption bands of radical anions in the wavelength range of 750–900 nm (as shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). Meanwhile, the absorption peak (500–700 nm) belonging to the charge transfer from fluorine to naphthalene diimide is obviously weakened (as shown in Scheme S1, ESI†). The relatively strong absorption bands of radical anions in the PNDIT-F3N–F film with excess F− indicate the stronger electron transfer from F− to the backbone of PNDIT-F3N–F.
Electron spin resonance spectroscopy study
Counterions can enable substantial doping effects in n-type semiconductors, such as NDI, PDI, fullerene derivatives, etc.33,34,42–47 Here, the CPEs were submitted for an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy study to achieve a deep understanding of the doping effect of the counterions in the polymer backbones. PNDIT-F3N–F with F− as the counterion shows much stronger ESR signal intensity from the unpaired electron with a g value of 2.002 than other CPEs, indicating that strong electron transfer from F− to the polymer backbone occurs, which coincides well with the radical anion characteristic in the absorption spectrum. The ESR intensities of these CPEs gradually decrease when counterions are changing to Cl−, BIm4− and Br−. The electron transfer from the counterions to the backbones of the CPEs is correlated with the electron-donating strength of the counterions, which can be denoted by lewis basicities.48 The lewis basicities of Br−, Cl− and F− are gradually enhanced, indicating that the electron-donating ability of these counterions is increased, which is consistent with the ESR intensities of their corresponding CPEs.48 However, PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 shows absolutely no ESR intensity, indicating that no doping behaviors exist in PNDIT-F3N–BArF4. Considering that the counterions BArF4− and BIm4− possess the same boron anion, the contradictory ESR signals of the two CPEs with BArF4− and BIm4− might be caused by the attached bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF4) and imidazole (Im4) groups. Both the size and electron donating/withdrawing strengths of ArF4 and Im4 groups in BArF4− and BIm4− are different. The electron-withdrawing ability of the ArF4 group in BArF4− will reduce the electron density of center boron anions in BArF4−, while the Im4 group in BIm4− with electron-donating ability can increase the electron density of center boron anions in BIm4−, and thus electron transfer from BArF4− to the backbone of PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 will be much retarded compared to that from BIm4− to the backbones of the CPE. Besides, the larger size of BArF4− is also assumed to be another factor that impedes the electron transfer from BArF4− to the backbone of the CPE. The great difference in the self-doping behaviors of PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 provide a new way to tune the doping properties of CPEs by changing the substituent groups of counterions.
Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy of CPE modified Ag electrodes
The modification ability of these CPEs in Ag electrodes was examined using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) and the results are shown in Table 1. It can be found in Table 1 that CPEs except PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 can greatly lower the work function (WF) of Ag from 4.73 eV to about 4.0 eV.49–52 CPEs with ammonium salt are well-known efficient modifiers to lower the work function of electrodes (Ag and ITO).50 However, a modified Ag electrode by PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 delivered an increased WF of 5.63 eV. This great contradiction in the modification capability of PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 in Ag electrodes can be caused by the size and counterion species of BArF4− and BIm4−.53 It was reported that tetrabutylammonium halides with larger counterions could result a reduced magnitude of the WF change of metal electrodes.53 However, the size difference of counterions could not sufficiently explain the largely enhanced WF of the Ag electrode modified by PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 since the sizes of both BArF4− and BIm4− are much larger than those of other counterions (F−, Cl−, and Br−). Considering the electron donating/withdrawing ability of BIm4− and BArF4−, a reverse dipole may be formed between BIm4− and BArF4− with the Ag electrode, respectively, which leads to the opposite WF change of the Ag electrode by PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 and PNDIT-F3N–BArF4.41,54 The diverse modification capabilities of these CPEs with different counterions provide us a facile tool to tune the properties of metal/metal oxide electrodes to achieve different applications.

The thickness-dependence of CPEs on the WF of Ag electrodes was also investigated (shown in Table S1, ESI†). It can be observed that the WFs of Ag electrodes decreases slightly when the thickness of CPEs except for PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 increases from 5 nm to 80 nm. The steady WF of the modified Ag electrodes by these CPEs implies that high performance might be obtained when these CPEs are used in PSCs.30 However, the WF change of the Ag electrode modified by PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 with an increased thickness shows the opposite trend. The WF of the Ag electrode modified by PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 with a thickness of 80 nm moves to a high value of 5.85 eV. These results demonstrate that the WF change can be modified by CPEs in a wide range by careful selection of counterions.
Space charge limited current study
Electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Al/CPEs/Al were fabricated and the electron mobilities of these CPEs were calculated using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves of the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 3 and the electron mobilities of these CPEs are summarized in Table 1. PNDIT-F3N–F, PNDIT-F3N–Cl, PNDIT-F3N–Br and PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 show similar electron mobilities of 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 delivered a much lower mobility of 1.2 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. The great contrast in the mobilities of PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 and the other CPEs can be originated from three aspects: the first is the incapability of doping behavior between BArF4− and the polymer backbone of PNDIT-F3N–BArF4. A strongly doped polyelectrolyte may possess higher carrier density as well as higher electron mobility.55,56 Secondly, the low mobility of PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 may be partly attributed to the larger BArF4− which increases the distance between the polymer backbones and impedes the charge transport,41 which was also evidenced by the largely blue-shifted absorption of NDIT-F3N–BAarF4 in the thin-film state. The third fact causes the decline of the electron mobility of NDIT-F3N–BArF4 which might be due to the mismatch of the modified WF of the Ag electrode and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (ELUMO) of the NDIT-F3N–BArF4 backbone (−3.9 eV, shown in Fig. S7†), which would cause a large injection barrier and reduce the current across the devices.54 From the charge transport and electrode modification results of these CPEs, it can be concluded that the anion species and their substituent groups play a key role in their opto-electronic properties, which will potentially largely affect their performance in PSCs.

Performance of bulk heterojunction PSCs
To study the application of these CPEs as ETMs in PSCs, PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/CPEs/Ag were fabricated, where the active layer was constructed from our newly designed conjugated polymer NT812 (ref. 35) (shown in Fig. 4) and PC71BM. Generally, thin films of CPEs were spin-coated from methanol solution with varied thicknesses. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs are presented in Fig. 5 and the relevant data are summarized in Table 2. When the thickness of the CPEs is only 5 nm, the photovoltaic devices with these CPEs except PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 delivered very high performance. CPEs (PNDIT-F3N–Cl, PNDIT-F3N–Br and PNDIT-F3N–BIm4) with counterions of Cl−, Br− and BIm4− can boost the power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic devices to 10.26%, 10.50% and 10.23%, respectively. However, photovoltaic devices with PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 showed very poor performance (4.49%) with much lowered open-circuit voltage (Voc) (0.53 V) and fill factor (FF) (45.22%) compared to those of devices with other CPEs. The intrinsic Voc of photovoltaic devices is dependent on the built-in potential across the photovoltaic devices.57 It can be deduced that in this case, the PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 which can largely increase the work function of the Ag electrode, will decrease the build-in potential across the photovoltaic devices, thus leading to a large voltage loss in the device. Fortunately, CPEs with other counterions (Cl−, Br− and BIm4−) can enable high-performance PSCs with a normal Voc of 0.72 V and a high FF of 70.99, 72.18 and 71.12, respectively. The Vocs of PSCs are related to the WF of the interface/electrode; however, the photovoltaic devices with these CPEs as ETLs show the same Vocs even when the WFs of Ag electrodes modified by these CPEs are varied. It was reported that when the WF of the interface/electrode approached the LUMO levels of the acceptors (−4.1 to −4.2 eV) in the active layer, the Vocs became less sensitive to the variations in the WF of the interface/electrode.58 In our cases, the WFs of CPE modified electrodes are located in the range of 3.99–4.13 eV, and thus it is reasonable that the Vocs obtained in the photovoltaic devices show no difference. The high FF in photovoltaic devices with these CPEs originated from the excellent electron collection ability, including appropriate energy level alignment, hole trapping, interface doping, etc.8,26,30,38 The excellent electron collection ability provided by these CPEs was also evidenced by the results of the PC71BM-based electron-only devices. Given the fact that the counterions in these CPEs may n-dope and improve the conductivity of fullerene derivatives, the interface contacts between these CPEs and PC71BM were further investigated using electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Al/PC71BM/CPEs (5 nm)/Al (results are shown in Fig. 6a and Table S2, ESI†). It can be observed that the devices with NDIT-F3N–F, PNDIT-F3N–Cl, PNDIT-F3N–Br and PNDIT-F3N–BIm4 show significantly improved electron mobilities compared to the pristine PC71BM based devices (0.60 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), reaching 1.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, indicating the occurrence of the interface doping between these CPEs and PC71BM.38 However, electron-only devices with PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 show much reduced electron mobility (0.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to PC71BM based devices, indicating that PNDIT-F3N–BArF4 could block the electron transport from the Al electrode to the PC71BM, which is similar to the case of the pure CPE based electron-only devices. Nevertheless, the above results confirm the importance of counterion species for CPEs, thus providing a great chance to design novel high-performance CPEs. PSCs with thicker (40 nm and 80 nm) CPEs (PNDIT-F3N–Cl, PNDIT-F3N–Br and PNDIT-F3N–BIm4) were fabricated and the results are shown in Fig. 6b and Table 3. Owing to the high mobilities of these CPEs, these photovoltaic devices can maintain high PCEs of over 8%. It is of particular importance that the photovoltaic devices with 80 nm PNDIT-F3N–Cl and PNDIT-F3N–Br can deliver high efficiencies of 9.54% and 9.29% with only slightly reduced Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc) and FF. These results demonstrate that CPEs with high electron mobility and excellent electron collection ability can be successfully applied in PSCs and will be suitable for the mass-fabrication of PSCs using R2R techniques.30,38,59,60

Since the properties of PNDI-F3N–BArF4 are very different from those of the other CPEs, the applications of PNDI-F3N–BArF4 in the interface engineering of PSCs were specifically explored. Firstly, PNDI-F3N–BArF4 with various thicknesses as the ETMs in PSCs were studied and the resulting J–V curves and device parameters are presented in Fig. 7 and Table 4. It can be observed that the Vocs in these devices gradually decreased with the increased thickness of PNDI-F3N–BArF4. The Voc trend in the photovoltaic devices is also in accordance with the WF change of Ag electrodes modified by PNDI-F3N–BArF4 with different thicknesses. Thicker PNDI-F3N–BArF4 will promote the WF of the Ag electrode to a higher value, and further reduce the energy barrier between the cathode and anode, leading to declined Vocs in the resulting photovoltaic devices. The potential application of PNDI-F3N–BArF4 as a hole transport material (HTM) in PSCs was also explored. The resulting J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices (device structure: ITO/PNDI-F3N–BArF4 (5–20 nm)/NT812:PC71BM/PNDIT-F3N–Br (5 nm)/Al) with 5–20 nm PNDI-F3N–BArF4 as HTMs are shown in Fig. S8.† Unfortunately, photovoltaic devices with PNDI-F3N–BArF4 as the HTM showed very poor performance with PCE of less than 1%. The poor performance of these PSC devices can be attributed to the extremely low hole mobility of PNDI-F3N–BArF4 that could not be detected in our multiple trials. These results indicate that a p-type backbone in HTMs is necessary for hole transportation. Since counterions possess diverse modification capabilities in electrodes, it is desirable that CPEs with p-type backbones and optimized counterions could be used as efficient HTMs for PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we present a facile tool to tune the properties of n-type CPEs by changing their counterions. The alcohol solubilities and photophysical properties of these CPEs are correlated with the size of their counterions. The ESR study results show that counterions with stronger electron-donating strength in CPEs can improve the doping process. Counterions with strong electron-withdrawing substituent groups in CPEs can preclude the self-doping behaviors of CPEs, increase the work function of metal electrodes, and impede electron transport. CPEs with optimized counterions possess higher electron mobility and enable PSCs with high performance, implying great potential as thickness-insensitive ETMs for the fabrication of large-area PSCs. The relationship between the counterions and the performance of CPEs is well disclosed and we propose that the strategy we used can provide guidelines for the design of novel high-performance CPEs for organic opto-electronic devices.
Experimental section
General procedure for counterion-exchanging
The precursor CPE-poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide (PNDIT-F3N–Br) was synthesized according to our previously reported paper.30 CPEs with other counterions were prepared using counterion-exchanging procedures:36 firstly, PNDIT-F3N–Br (120 mg, approximately 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 5 mL methanol and 5 mL DMF. Subsequently, a solution mixture of 5 mL methanol and 5 mL water containing salt (1.0 mmol NaF, NaCl, Na+BIm4− or Na+BArF4−) was added. The mixture was stirred for three days at room temperature in darkness, and then was concentrated and precipitated into ethyl acetate, followed by filtration and collection. The counterion-exchanging procedure was repeated once more to achieve a full exchange of the counterions. Finally, the resulting CPEs with desired counterions were dissolved in 10 mL dimethyl formamide again and filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter, followed by precipitation in deionized water and drying under vacuum.
Characterization of the CPEs
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of these CPEs both in solution and film states were recorded using a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 under the protection of nitrogen gas with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted on a CHI66E electrochemical workstation equipped with a carbon glass electrode coated with a CPE film as the working electrode. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, and a Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode. The CV experiments were performed in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. Electron spin resonance spectroscopies of these CPEs in the solid state were conducted on a JEOL JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer (300 K, 9.063 GHz, X-band). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of these CPEs in the solid state was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi.
Fabrication of PSCs
PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NT812:PC71BM/CPEs/Ag were fabricated, where a naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) based narrow bandgap conjugated polymer NT812 (ref. 35) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were used as the donor polymer and acceptor, respectively. The fabrication of PSCs was performed using a standard procedure.35 The solutions for the active layer were prepared by dissolving a NT812:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend in chlorobenzene:o-dichlorobenzene:1-chloronaphthalene (74.7:24.8:0.5 v/v) with the polymer concentration at 11 mg mL−1. Then the CPEs were spin-coated on the top of the active layer with different thicknesses. Finally, 100 nm Ag was thermally deposited on top of the active layer through a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The effective area of a device was defined to be 0.0516 cm2 by the shadow mask. The electron mobility of these CPEs is characterized using electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Al/CPEs/Al and calculated using a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.
Characterization of the PSCs
The J–V curves were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G spectra from a class solar simulator (Taiwan, Enlitech), and the light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 as calibrated by using a China general certification center (CGC) certified reference monocrystal silicon cell (Enlitech). Before the J–V test, a physical mask of an aperture with a precise area of 0.04 cm2 was used to define the device area. The EQE spectra were obtained on a commercial EQE measurement system (Taiwan, Enlitech, QE-R3011).
