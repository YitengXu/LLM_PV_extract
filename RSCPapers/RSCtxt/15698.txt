    , Accepted 12th November 2018First published on 14th November 2018AbstractTernary blend is an effective way to realize high photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). A highly crystalline n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) IDIC was introduced into a low crystalline blend of conjugated polymer donor J61 and n-OS acceptor BT-IC. Higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 10.80% were achieved for the ternary PSCs based on J61:IDIC:BT-IC (0.9:0.2:0.8, w/w), with an improved short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and unreduced open-circuit voltage (Voc). The addition of high crystallinity IDIC into the binary J61:BT-IC blend enhanced the coherence length of polymer donor J61 in the blend film, yielding higher hole mobility and achieving higher Jsc and FF. Charge recombination mechanism analysis revealed that the ternary blend based on J61:IDIC:BT-IC exhibited less bimolecular recombination in comparison with the device based on J61:BT-IC. The energy transfer was unveiled from IDIC to BT-IC for the two acceptors based on photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption measurements. The Voc of the ternary PSCs with 20% lower-lying the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) IDIC in the acceptors remained the same as the devices based on the host binary blend. This finding may account for the reduced bimolecular recombination and the energy transfer in the ternary devices. This study provides an efficient strategy to obtain a high PCE for ternary PSCs by introducing a second small molecule acceptor with high crystallinity.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs have drawn extensive attention as a new renewable energy technology due to their advantages like light weight, flexibility, low production cost and capability to be fabricated into semitransparent devices.1–7 Recently, versatile non-fullerene acceptors achieved rapid development with defined easy tuning absorption, tunable electronic energy levels and chemical structures, leading to PSCs with a PCE up to 13%.8–16 However, the photovoltaic performance of the binary PSCs with a conjugated polymer donor and a non-fullerene n-OS acceptor is often limited by their lower Jsc due to the limited absorption range of the binary system. To broaden the absorption of the active layers of the PSCs, ternary blending with either absorption-complementary two donors and one acceptor or one donor and two acceptors has been used.17–24 The versatile non-fullerene n-OS acceptors played a vital role and provided more opportunity to improve highly efficient ternary PSCs.25–29 Although the PCE of PSCs was enhanced by the ternary blending method, three fundamental mechanisms, namely charge transfer, energy transfer and parallel linkage are still under debate.30–36 The addition of another n-OS acceptor into binary PSCs can commonly improve the Jsc and FF of the ternary PSCs. The Voc of the ternary PSCs could be lower than that of the binary PSCs due the energy levels mismatch between the two acceptors. Importantly, the addition of the third component in the ternary PSCs influences the morphology of the active layer through parameters such as crystallinity, molecular packing and orientation, and the domain size of the blend films.37 For example, Wei et al. reported that the incorporation of a high-crystalline small molecule into binary PSCs can enhance the crystallinity and the face-on orientation of the ternary system, leading to higher hole mobility and less charge recombination, thus, achieving enhanced Jsc, FF, and PCE.32
Zhan et al. reported a planar fused-ring n-OS electron acceptor IDIC with strong “face-on” π–π ordering.38 Our group also revealed that IDIC with a planar structure results in a strong aggregation in the solid film.39,40 In this study, we introduce the highly crystalline n-OS IDIC into a low crystalline blend of conjugated polymer donor J61 (ref. 41) and n-OS acceptor BT-IC,42 achieving a higher PCE of 10.80%, with improved Jsc and FF, and a Voc that remained the same as the host binary blend. The addition of 20% IDIC acceptor enhanced the coherence length of the conjugated polymer donor J61 in the ternary PSCs and formed proper phase separation morphology, thus yielding higher hole mobility and achieving higher Jsc and FF. Although, the LUMO level of IDIC was lower than that of BT-IC, the Voc of the ternary PSCs did not need to be reduced. Charge recombination mechanism analysis revealed that the ternary device based on J61:IDIC:BT-IC reduced bimolecular recombination in comparison with the binary device based on J61:BT-IC. The energy transfer was unveiled from IDIC to BT-IC for the two acceptors based on the PL and transient absorption measurements. The reduced bimolecular recombination and the energy transfer could result in the same Voc of the ternary PSCs with the addition of 20% low-lying LUMO IDIC in the acceptors, similar to that of the host binary device. This study indicates that the introduction of a highly crystalline IDIC acceptor can enhance crystallinity of the polymer donor, thus yielding higher hole mobility and achieving higher Jsc and FF, with the same Voc, which is an efficient way to improve PCE for the ternary PSCs.
Results and discussion
We used low crystallinity conjugated polymer J61 as a donor and the n-OS small molecule BT-IC as an acceptor to fabricate the host binary PSCs and study the effect of introducing different contents of high crystallinity n-OS IDIC on the photovoltaic performance of the ternary PSCs. The chemical structures and the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of J61, BT-IC, and IDIC are shown in Fig. 1a, b. The two main absorption peaks of J61 donor with medium bandgap of 1.91 eV were at 548 nm and 596 nm; and the maximum absorption of BT-IC acceptor with narrow bandgap of 1.43 eV was at 758 nm. The maximum absorption of IDIC acceptor with bandgap of 1.62 eV was at 705 nm. The complementary absorption of the three materials covered the spectral range from 300 to 900 nm, and the broad absorption spectrum was beneficial for improving solar light harvesting. The molecular energy level diagrams of J61 (ref. 41), BT-IC and IDIC are shown in Fig. 1c. The LUMO energy levels of BT-IC and IDIC were measured using cyclic voltammetry to check the LUMO energy level difference between BT-IC and IDIC, and the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S1 in ESI.† The LUMO energy levels of BT-IC and IDIC were −3.86 and −3.91 eV, respectively.

To study the effect of introducing different contents of IDIC into host binary PSCs on the photovoltaic performance of ternary PSCs based on J61:BT-IC, binary and ternary PSCs were fabricated using a conventional device structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/active layer/PDINO (perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide)/Al (see Fig. 1d). The binary PSCs based on J61:BT-IC (1:1, w/w) underwent thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. The corresponding photovoltaic performance agreed with our previous report,42 showing a PCE of 9.56% with a Jsc of 16.35 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and an FF of 67.10%. The photovoltaic performance of the binary PSCs based on J61:BT-IC was further optimized with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 0.9:1, active layer thickness of 100 nm and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 2 min. Under these optimized condition, PCE reached 9.82% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 17.40 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64.51%. Then, we fixed the conditions of donor:acceptor weight ratio of 0.9:1, active layer thickness of 100 nm and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 2 min in the studies of the ternary PSCs. Fig. 2a shows representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the binary devices and optimum ternary devices. The J–V curves of the ternary devices with different IDIC:BT-IC weight ratio are shown in Fig. S2a.†Table 1 lists the photovoltaic performance parameters of the PSCs for a clear comparison. As mentioned above, the binary device based on J61:BT-IC (0.9:1, w/w) exhibited a PCE of 9.82% with a Jsc of 17.40 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and an FF of 64.51%. The binary device based on J61:IDIC (0.9:1, w/w) exhibited a relatively lower PCE of 8.69% with a lower Jsc of 15.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V, and a higher FF of 68.65%. Compared to the binary device based on J61:BT-IC, the optimized ternary PSC with a J61:IDIC:BT-IC weight ratio of 0.9:0.2:0.8 (20% of IDIC in the acceptors) demonstrated a PCE up to 10.76% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 17.91 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.37%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the representative PSCs are shown in Fig. 2b, and EQE spectra of the ternary PSCs with a different IDIC:BT-IC weight ratio are shown in Fig. S2b.† For the PSCs based on J61:BT-IC (0.9:1, w/w), J61:IDIC:BT-IC (0.9:0.2:0.8, w/w) and J61:IDIC (0.9:1, w/w), the integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves were 17.03, 17.84 and 15.14 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree quite well with the Jsc values from the J–V measurement. It should be mentioned that EQE values in the region of 600–770 nm for the ternary PSC improved significantly in comparison with the binary PSC based on J61:BT-IC. The EQE values benefitted from the strong absorption of the IDIC additive in the ternary blend, resulting in the higher Jsc for the ternary PSC.

To better understand the influence of the 20% IDIC acceptor on the active layer morphology, we employed grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) (also named grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)) to investigate the molecular orientation and packing of these thin films.43Fig. 3 shows the two-dimensional (2D) GIXD patterns and the corresponding line-cuts of neat J61, neat IDIC, neat BT-IC, and their blends. The lamellar distances, the π–π-stacking distances and the coherence length of the films are summarized in Table S1.† The J61 polymer showed a (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.24 Å−1, with π–π stacking in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at 1.74 Å−1, and a coherence length of 5.44 and 2.16 nm, respectively. BT-IC showed a (100) diffraction at 0.31 Å−1, π–π stacking in the OOP at 1.81 Å−1, and a coherence length of 12.30 and 2.73 nm, respectively. IDIC exhibited a clear and strong (100) diffraction in the IP direction at 0.38 Å−1, π–π stacking (010) diffraction at 1.81 Å−1 in the OOP direction, and a coherence length of 15.56 and 2.93 nm, respectively. Better defined scattering peaks and stronger intensities were shown with a predominant face-on crystalline orientation. All of these neat films showed preferred face-on molecular packing orientation relative to the substrate. In the blend film based on J61:BT-IC, the (100) coherence length of J61 was calculated (via Scherrer equation) to be 6.38 nm (IP) and 2.56 nm (OOP) by fitting, respectively. The combined coherence length and scattering intensity indicated that J61 and BT-IC intended to mix to suppress polymer crystallization. The J61:IDIC film showed a stronger trend feature. The J61 coherence length was increased to 8.52 nm in the (100) direction and the π–π stacking was increased to 4.55 nm for the J61:IDIC film. There were a series of diffraction peaks in the IP direction 0.4–0.6 Å−1 coming from IDIC molecular packing with a different crystal structure. It is worth to note that J61 in the J61:IDIC film could form a larger coherence length compared to the J61:BT-IC film. Such a feature is attributed to the good crystallinity of IDIC or unfavorable mixing, from which J61 was less perturbed and could aggregate with order. After the addition of 20% IDIC in the acceptor, the ternary J61:IDIC:BT-IC film exhibited an enhanced diffraction feature compared to the binary J61:BT-IC film, as seen from the sharper (100) and (010) diffractions. The J61 coherence length grew from 6.38 to 8.01 nm in the (100) direction and the π–π stacking was increased from 2.56 to 2.85 nm. The peaks of the ternary blend became sharper after adding 20% IDIC, indicating that IDIC indeed enhanced the coherence length of conjugated polymer donor J61 in the blend film. This was beneficial for yielding higher hole mobility and achieving higher FF for the ternary PSC than that of the binary PSC based on J61:BT-IC film.

The corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction of (b) Pristine films and (c) blends films. Solid lines represent out-of-plane and dotted lines represent in-plane. 
Phase separation in the blend films was investigated using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXs) with results shown in Fig. 4. While the J61:BT-IC binary blends showed a weak phase separation (a shoulder at about 0.1 nm−1), J61:IDIC binary blends showed a distinctive phase separation at 0.059 nm−1, giving a center-to-center distance of ≈106 nm. Therefore, the statistical average domain size was ≈53 nm. The lower Jsc and EQE of the binary PSC based on J61:IDIC was probably due to the excessively large domain size, diminishing the donor/acceptor interface for exciton effective separation. It is necessary to note that Jsc of the binary PSC based on J61:IDIC was lower than that of the device based on J61:BT-IC, which was probably due to the red-shifted absorption of BT-IC by about 60 nm than that of IDIC. This broad absorption spectrum was beneficial for wider solar light harvesting, capturing more photons and obtaining higher Jsc. The ternary blend combines scattering features of the two binary blends. After the addition of 20% IDIC into J61:BT-IC binary blend, the phase separation became more intensive and the q position slightly moved. For this system, the scattering curve can be treated using the following equation: .44 The first term describes Porod scattering from clusters (exponent = n) and the second term is a Lorentzian function describing scattering from polymer chains (exponent = m), with two multiplicative factors A and C, corresponding to the Porod scale and Lorentz_scale, respectively, which can be obtained from the fitting results. The most important parameter is the correlation length ξ, describing a correlation length for the scattering entities. For the J61:BT-IC binary blend and the J61:IDIC:BT-IC ternary blend, the correlation lengths were 13.4 nm and 12.2 nm, respectively. Assuming that the volume fraction of each phase was equal to the volume fraction of the components, the average size of each domain was calculated to be about 26.8 nm and 24.4 nm. The morphology was optimal for charge separation and transport, leading to a high Jsc. This small phase separation was dictated by the J61:BT-IC blends, and the introduction of 20% IDIC did not drive it to a large size scale, but instead helped to improve film crystallinity and transport, to boost FF of the PSCs.

The morphology of the abovementioned blend films was further studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see Fig. 5). The J61:IDIC film showed high morphology roughness in the surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 8.72 nm. However, the J61:BT-IC film showed a different feature with a RMS roughness of 0.63 nm. After the addition of 20% IDIC, the morphology of the ternary blend film remained smooth with RMS roughness of 0.75 nm, which was beneficial for charge collection. TEM characterization provided a direct observation of the phase-separation morphology in the bulk, which was consistent with the RSoXS results. Large aggregated structures were seen, which were ascribed to the IDIC aggregated crystallites. A small domain size (∼20–30 nm) for J61:BT-IC, and fibril type texture was observed, indicating that the donor and acceptor mixed quite well. However, a significantly larger domain size (about 50 nm) for J61:IDIC due to the larger coherence length of IDIC (black or grey aggregation) in the J61:IDIC blends, led to diminishing donor/acceptor interface for exciton effective separation, resulting in a lower Jsc. After the addition of 20% IDIC into the binary blend of J61:BT-IC, the coherence length of the polymer donor J61 was enhanced. The ternary blend tended to form a more significant fibril-like morphology, which established a bi-continuous interpenetrating network (see Fig. 5e) and therefore helped hole carriers in efficient transportation.

We measured the hole and electron mobilities by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility was 0.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:BT-IC, 1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:IDIC:BT-IC, 2.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:IDIC (see Fig. S3a†). The electron mobility was 3.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:BT-IC, 3.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:IDIC:BT-IC, 3.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:IDIC (see Fig. S3b†). Compared to J61:BT-IC, hole mobility of the ternary blend film after the addition of 20% IDIC into J61:BT-IC increased significantly, probably due to the enhanced coherence length of the polymer donor J61 in the ternary blend. The electron mobilities changed only slightly for the different blend films. The electron (μe)/hole (μh) mobility ratio of the devices were 3.19, 1.81, and 1.48 for J61:BT-IC, J61:IDIC:BT-IC, and J61:IDIC, respectively (see Table S2 in ESI†), indicating more balanced hole and electron mobilities in the ternary device than in the J61:BT-IC binary device. The higher hole and electron mobilities as well as the more balanced mobility could result in a higher FF for the ternary PSC. The combination of molecular packing, the size of coherence length and phase separation, optimum morphology and higher hole mobility of the ternary blend should be the reason that improved the Jsc and FF, leading to a higher PCE of 10.80%.
To analyze the impact of 20% IDIC content on charge recombination mechanisms, we measured the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the illumination light intensity, as shown in Fig. 6. The dependence of Voc on light intensity (P) can be used to distinguish monomolecular and bimolecular recombination.45 In general, when the slope of the straight line of Vocvs. ln(P) is close to kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in kelvin, and q is elementary charge, bimolecular recombination can be the dominant charge recombination mechanism. When the slope is close to 2kT/q, monomolecular recombination is dominant even at open circuit.45 In Fig. 6a, the slope for the device based on J61:BT-IC, J61:IDIC:BT-IC and J61:IDIC was 0.97kT/q, 0.99 kT/q and 1.23 kT/q, respectively. These findings indicate that the charge recombination at open circuit could be bimolecular dominant recombination and there was no monomolecular recombination in the ternary devices. The Jsc follows power-law dependence versus light intensity, which can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Pα. In general, when α is equal to 1, bimolecular recombination can be neglected, whereas α < 1 indicates that some extent of bimolecular recombination exists.46 The power-law exponent values of the binary devices based on J61:BT-IC and J61:IDIC, and the ternary device based on J61:IDIC:BT-IC were 0.93, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively (see Fig. 6b). The α value of 0.96 for the ternary device was close to 1, indicating less bimolecular recombination compared to that of the binary PSC based on J61:BTIC with an α value of 0.93. The results indicate that bimolecular recombination can be well suppressed by the introduction of 20% IDIC, which could result in the improved Jsc and FF of the ternary device.

The working mechanism for ternary blends was studied further. We carried out the photoluminescence (PL) measurements to understand the role of IDIC and BT-IC acceptors in the ternary PSCs. We can see clearly that there was a large overlap between the emission spectrum of IDIC and absorption of BT-IC (see Fig. S4a†), indicating the possibility for energy transfer from IDIC to BT-IC.47 We used excitation wavelength at 468 nm to measure the PL spectrum of pure IDIC, pure BT-IC, and the blend film of IDIC:BT-IC (1:4, w/w) (see Fig. S4b†). We observed that the emission of BT-IC changed slightly in the IDIC:BT-IC blend, while the emission of IDIC was partly quenched by BT-IC. It was difficult to determine whether there was charge transfer or energy transfer between IDIC and BT-IC. Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to study the transfer process further.48,49 First, we used a pumping wavelength at 800 nm to selectively excite BT-IC in the blend film. Bleaching signals at 690 nm and 760 nm were observed in the BT-IC neat film and BT-IC:IDIC blend films (see Fig. S5b, d, f and S6a, c†), which can be ascribed to the ground state bleaching (GSB) of BT-IC. The normalized kinetic curve of the blend film probed at 760 nm agreed well with that probed for neat BT-IC film (see Fig. S6b†), indicating that there was no transfer process from BT-IC to IDIC under this pumping wavelength. Hence, the TA spectra of the blend film with the excitation wavelength at 800 nm can be regarded as the signal of BT-IC. Then, we used a pumping wavelength at 650 nm to simultaneously excite IDIC and BT-IC in the blend film (see Fig. S5a, c, e†). Except for the bleaching signals of BT-IC, another bleaching signal was found around 720 nm (see Fig. 7a), which was also seen in IDIC neat film (see Fig. S6a†). Therefore, this bleaching signal can be attributed to the GSB of the IDIC component in the blends. This GSB of IDIC drastically decayed in blends during the first picosecond compared to that probed for the neat film (see Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, the GSB of BT-IC at 760 nm increased at a similar time scale (see Fig. 7b), suggesting the transfer of excitations from IDIC to BT-IC. It can be inferred that this transfer was completed within 1 ps. The 650 nm excited TA spectra of the blend probed at 1 ps and 2 ps was in good agreement with that excited at 800 nm and probed at 0.5 ps (see Fig. 7d), indicating that after this transfer process was complete, only the signal of BT-IC remained in the blend film. The charge transfer process leaves positive or negative charges in the IDIC domains, thus inducing GSB signals of IDIC. Therefore, this transfer process observed in the blend film can be ascribed as energy transfer for the absence of GSB signals of IDIC. GSB signals of the IDIC:BT-IC blend film showed a similar lifetime as that of the BT-IC neat film (see Fig. S6d†), indicating that this transfer process did not generate a long-lifetime state as can be observed in other traditional donor:acceptor blends. This finding further confirmed that only energy transfer occurred in the IDIC:BT-IC blend film. It should be mentioned that the Voc of the ternary PSCs with 20% IDIC in the acceptors was similar to the Voc value of the binary PSC based on J61:BT-IC. One of the reasons besides reduced bimolecular recombination of ternary PSCs may be the energy transfer of the acceptors from IDIC to BT-IC. The Voc value of the PSC was then determined by the energy level deference between the LUMO level of the acceptor BT-IC and the HOMO level of the donor J61.50

Conclusion
We demonstrate the high efficiency of ternary PSCs by introducing one n-OS small molecule acceptor IDIC with high crystallinity into a low crystalline binary blend containing conjugated polymer J61 donor and n-OS small molecule acceptor BT-IC. This achieved a higher PCE of 10.80%, with improved Jsc and FF, and retained high Voc of the host binary PSC. GIXD analysis results indicate that the introduction of 20% IDIC enhanced the coherence length of the conjugated polymer donor J61 in the blend film, thus yielding higher hole mobility and achieving higher Jsc and FF. RSoXs analysis results indicate the formation of proper phase separation morphology after the introduction of 20% IDIC into the binary J61:BT-IC. Charge recombination mechanism analysis revealed that the ternary device based on J61:IDIC:BT-IC possessed less bimolecular recombination in comparison with the binary device based on J61:BT-IC. The PL and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy analysis results indicate that the energy transfer from IDIC to BT-IC occurred in the ternary PSCs with less bimolecular recombination, which may keep the Voc unreduced. This study indicates that the introduction of a highly crystalline IDIC acceptor can enhance crystallinity of the polymer donor, thus achieving higher Jsc and FF for the ternary PSCs. The results indicate that introducing a highly crystalline n-OS acceptor is an efficient way to obtain a high PCE for the ternary PSCs.
