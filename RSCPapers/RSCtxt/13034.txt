    , Accepted 3rd April 2023First published on 4th April 2023AbstractAll-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells have received growing attention in the photovoltaic field due to their high stability, low cost, and simple preparation processes. However, the high-density defects in perovskite films and the large energy differences at interfaces have been the main challenges for achieving high power conversion efficiency and good stability. In this work, nickel oxide (NiOx) decorated graphene oxide (GO) is used as a hole collector at the perovskite/carbon interface for a carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell. The crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer and the hole extraction ability are markedly enhanced because of the p-type charge transfer doping of GO from oxygenic groups to NiOx. Finally, the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency of 8.59%. More importantly, the best solar cell free of encapsulation retains 94.2% of its initial efficiency in an air environment over 21 days.
Introduction
In the recent decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received a lot of scientific attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low cost, and simple preparation process.1,2 A challenging problem for organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs is the thermodynamic decomposition of organic components when exposed to light,3 heat,4 humidity,5 and/or oxygen conditions.6 In this fashion, the photovoltaic performances of a PSC module are undoubtedly decreased in real use. To date, the processes for making highly efficient PSCs have always been performed in a super-clean laboratory under anhydrous and anaerobic conditions. In comparison with organic–inorganic hybrid materials, inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites have more stable optical and thermodynamic properties.7,8 It is noteworthy that all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs do not require the external environment to be controlled; therefore, the solar cells based on inorganic CsPbBr3 halide have become a cutting-edge technology.9 Jin et al. used CsPbBr3 as a light-absorbing layer to assemble an all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC, showing the best PCE of 6.7%, and it retained above 99% of its initial efficiency after storing it for 2000 hours in air.10 Subsequently, our group developed a multi-spin coating method to prepare a high-purity CsPbBr3 film and achieved an efficiency as high as 9.72% in a solar cell.11 However, the wide optical band gap (2.3 eV), narrow light absorption range (540 nm) and resultant poor charge carrier recombination of the CsPbBr3 film limit the further improvement of efficiency and stability. Therefore, it is a prerequisite to enhance the crystal structure and the charge carrier extraction ability of CsPbBr3 for high-efficiency PSCs.
Graphene oxide (GO) has exceptional optical and electrical properties,12,13 so it is beneficial for improving interfacial hole extraction by controlling the surface functional groups.14 In addition, the abundant oxygen-containing groups of GO could adjust the perovskite crystal growth.15 Acik et al. increased the service life of PSCs by using fluorine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets.16 Although GO can help extract holes and charge transfer, the oxygenic functional groups at the GO surface also localize the charge carriers. It is a prerequisite to realize the charge delocalization of GO without reducing its charge-extraction ability. Nano-nickel oxide (NiOx) is a typical p-type semiconductor material. Its band gap is 3.8–4.3 eV, and it has high light transmittance, stable chemical properties, and strong hole transport ability.17–21 Because the valence band of NiOx is close to that of CsPbBr3, NiOx could improve the photo-induced electron–hole separation and reduce the interfacial energy loss.22 In previous work, NiOx nanoparticles were used in flexible PSCs,23 and the film-forming properties of the precursor solution were improved due to the high crystallinity and good dispersion of NiOx. More importantly, partial electrons in the oxygenic functional groups in GO transfer to NiOx owing to the electron confinement difference for forming p-type charge transfer doping of GO by decorating GO with NiOx.24 This causes a significantly enhanced hole extraction and transfer ability.
In this work, we report the preparation of NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO as a hole collector in a carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC. On the one hand, the binding of the oxygenic groups in GO and the Pb2+ ions in the perovskite precursor solution could inhibit the formation of excess crystal nuclei, causing an increased grain size and a decreased grain boundary density. On the other hand, the hole extraction was improved, and the charge carrier recombination was reduced due to the p-type charge transfer doping of GO with NiOx nanoparticles.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
All the materials and reagents were used as received without any further purification, including PbBr2 (99.999%, Sigma), CsBr (99.999%, Sigma), graphite powder (99.95%, Aladdin), Ni(NO3)6·6H2O (99.99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), urea (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), anhydrous ethanol (99.5%, Alfa Aesar), anhydrous methanol (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), diethanol amine (99.5%, Aladdin), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 99.99%, Aladdin), and titanium(IV) isopropoxide (99.9%, Aladdin).
Preparation of NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO
A solution of 14.4 g of Ni(NO3)6·6H2O in 10 mL of H2O was named “solution 1”. The other solution of 4 g of NaOH in 10 mL of H2O was labeled “solution 2”. Then, solution 2 was added to solution 1 until the pH value reached 10. NiOx was obtained through a centrifugation process and 2 hours of calcination at 270 °C.
The GO paste was prepared using an improved Hummers method. In detail, 23 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to a mixture of 1 g of graphene and 0.5 g of NaNO3 in an ice bath. Then, 3 g of KMnO4 and 50 mL of H2O were added to the above mixture in order. To remove excess KMnO4, H2O2 solution was added until no air bubbles were created. The GO powders were obtained through centrifugation and freeze-drying processes.
To ensure suspension uniformity, GO, Ni(NO)3·6H2O, and urea were dispersed in an aqueous solution by stirring for 2 h. After stirring for 30 min, the above liquid was moved to a Teflon autoclave and kept at 90 °C for 12 h. Then, the sediment was heated to 400 °C in an air environment for 4 h. The NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO powders were collected after cooling to room temperature, and the NiOx decorated GO samples with a ratio of 25%, 50% and 75% were prepared, which were denoted as NiOx/GO-1, NiOx/GO-2, and NiOx/GO-3, respectively. The specific dosage is shown in Table S1.†
Assembly of CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells
FTO substrates were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. A compact layer of TiO2 was formed by spain-coating 90 μL mixed ethanol solution (0.5 M titanium isopropoxide and 0.5 M diethanol amine) at 7000 rpm for 30 s and short baking at 500 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared TiO2 paste25 was spin-coated onto the compact layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Afterwards, the film was short baked at 450 °C for 30 min in air, immersed in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min, and short baked at 450 °C for 30 min, again.
5 mg of NiOx/GO-1, NiOx/GO-2, and NiOx/GO-3, and 5 mg of NiOx were added to 8 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in an N2 atmosphere. 1 M PbBr2 in the above solution was spin-coated on a TiO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s and subjected to short baking at 90 °C for 30 min. Then, 0.07 M CsBr in methanol was spin-coated on a PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s and subjected to short baking at 250 °C for 5 min. The preceding preparation procedure was repeated three times to obtain a satisfactory perovskite film.
Finally, a carbon electrode was deposited on the above film by coating carbon paste (Shanghai Mater Win New Materials Co., Ltd). After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum, the carbon electrode could be obtained.
Characterization of photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties were characterized in the ambient air environment (40% RH, 25 °C). The J–V curves were obtained using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A, 1.5G). A black mask was used on the solar cell surface to avoid stray light, and the active area was 0.08 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a Zahner electrochemical workstation (IM6) in the dark with an amplitude of 10 mV at Voc.
The NiOx decorated GO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku, with 0.15418 nm Cu-Kα radiation). The microtopography was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 20) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800, Hitachi). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) was carried out using a Horiba JobinYvon instrument, whose excitation is at 510 nm. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Meipuda UV-3200).
Results and discussion
In Fig. S1,† the FTIR spectrum of GO shows the characteristic peaks at 3181.61 cm−1, 1731.46 cm−1, 1620.23 cm−1 and 1042.88 cm−1, and they are caused by νO–H, νCO, νC–OH, and νC–O–C, respectively. Fig. S2† shows the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 37.2°, 43.2°, 62.8°, 75.4°, and 79.4°, which correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) facets of NiOx, respectively. In comparison with pure NiOx, the NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO shows an extra diffraction peak, which is indexed to the (002) crystal plane of GO. The TEM images in Fig. S3† reveal that NiOx nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed in the GO sheets. These results indicate that the NiOx nanoparticles have been successfully loaded onto GO by the hydrothermal method.
The NiOx decorated GO was first applied to carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1a and Table S2.† Through using NiOx decorated GO as a hole collector, we obtained all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs with satisfactory performance. It also gives an overview of the operational mechanism of NiOx decorated GO, which will be discussed systematically in the following section. The impacts of NiOx decorated GO on the CsPbBr3 crystal are explored by studying the composition and morphology of perovskite films. Fig. 1b exhibits the XRD patterns of CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO and pure CsPbBr3 films, where the peaks at 2θ = 15.2°, 21.4°, 30.6°, and 34.1° are indexed to the (100), (110), (200), and (210) planes of CsPbBr3, respectively. In the case of the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO film, the content of the NiOx decorated GO is too low to be detected by XRD measurement. The diffraction peak intensity of the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO film is dramatically increased in comparison with the pure CsPbBr3 film, demonstrating an enhanced crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 film upon using the NiOx decorated GO. Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S4† show the top-view SEM images of CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO films. The pure CsPbBr3 film has some irregular small grains, but the grain size becomes larger with fewer grain boundaries upon adding NiOx decorated GO. The inset images clearly show that the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO film presents a more uniform morphology with an increased average size from 0.5 to 0.8 μm in contrast to the pristine film. As is well known, small perovskite grains are caused by the rapid reaction between lead halide and cations.26 During the crystallization of the CsPbBr3 perovskite, there is a strong interaction force between the oxygenic groups in GO and the Pb2+ ions in the perovskite, which inhibits the contact of PbBr2 and CsBr, and therefore reduces their reaction kinetics. As a result, a high-quality perovskite film with a large grain size, low grain boundary, and high crystallinity could be obtained. These superiorities promote charge carrier transportation in a solar cell.

The NiOx/GO ratio was tuned, and the corresponding devices were labeled CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-1, CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2, and CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-3. Fig. 2a and Fig. S5† show the J–V curves of the carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs, and the related performance parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4.† All the performance parameters including Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE of the NiOx decorated GO assisted CsPbBr3 PSCs are increased in comparison with those of the control CsPbBr3 device, and the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 PSC achieves a champion PCE of 8.59% with a Voc of 1.537 V, a Jsc of 6.98 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.1%. The devices with pure NiOx have lower efficiency than the pristine ones. It is speculated that the agglomeration of NiOx nanoparticles might affect the crystallization of CsPbBr3 and the increase in defect state density. And the high concentration of GO produces defects and leads to reduced efficiency with NiOx/GO-3 treatment. First, the high Voc means a low energy loss (Eloss) according to the equation Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the photonic band gap of CsPbBr3 and e is the electron charge. The Eloss is greatly affected by the interfacial properties. NiOx could reduce the interfacial charge carrier recombination because of its well-matched energy level and good hole extraction capability (Fig. 1a). According to the above equation, the PSC with NiOx/GO-2 shows a higher value of Voc than the pristine ones. Second, the large perovskite grain size also promotes the enhancement of FF. The large grains in a perovskite film have a low boundary defect density, causing a reduced energy loss in the carrier transport process. Third, all the Jsc values are obviously improved after adding the NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO. Despite the above-mentioned hole extraction by NiOx and low boundary density, the GO is decorated with a large number of oxygenic groups such as carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxy, etc.; the oxygen atoms in these bind with the uncoordinated Pb2+ species to passivate defects, which also contribute to a low charge recombination and therefore energy loss. Fig. 2b and c show the J–V curves of PSCs with CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/NiO/GO-2 measured by forward and reverse scanning, respectively. According to the formula, the hysteresis factor is equal to (PCEforward scan − PCEreverse scan)/PCEreverse scan. By using the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 additive, the hysteresis factor is reduced from 38.37% to 20.49% for the control device. The reduced hysteresis is related to the high crystallinity of CsPbBr3 grains and a low defect state density. By keeping the bias at the maximum power, the stabilized efficiency is in good agreement with the Jsc derived from the J–V measurement (Fig. 2d). These results demonstrate that the NiOx decorated GO helps enhance the PCE of CsPbBr3 PSCs. Effective charge carrier extraction determines the final photovoltaic performances, and we further studied the carrier transport and light absorption properties of the resultant perovskite thin films.

As shown in Fig. 2e, the electron reaction of perovskite layers was investigated by TRPL spectroscopy according to the equations27,28f(x) = K + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) and τave = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi, where K is the baseline offset constant, Ai is the decay amplitude, τ1 and τ2 are carrier lifetimes. τ1 is the fast part of nonradiative recombination, which is related to defects. τ2 refers to the slower part of radiative recombination, which is related to electron–hole separation across the interface.29 Although the PSCs with NiO/GO-2 showed a larger τ1 than the pristine one, the device modified with NiO/GO-2 shows the largest τ2 (4.730 ns) in comparison with the 3.030 ns for a pristine solar cell. The average device lifetime (τave) is improved from 0.156 to 0.198 ns by adding NiO/GO-2 into CsPbBr3, as listed in Table S5.† This indicates that both nonradiative and radiative recombinations are decreased, and the charge separation and extraction efficiency are increased. The mechanism behind these findings is the increased grain size, reduced grain boundary, and enhanced crystallinity. Fig. 2f exhibits the UV-vis absorption spectra of pure CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2, and CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 has a higher absorption intensity in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, which is attributed to the increased crystallinity of CsPbBr3. Due to the increased crystallinity and decreased defect density of CsPbBr3, its absorption peak slightly shifts to a lower wavelength. This result is caused by the change in dielectric constant on the CsPbBr3 surface due to the passivation of GO.30,31
To investigate the charge recombination dynamics in a whole device, we measured Jsc and Voc as a function of light intensity by modulated J–V. The relationship between Jsc and light intensity (I) is expressed by Jsc ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1), where α is the fitting factor of mitigated bimolecular recombination. When the value of α is closer to 1, the PSC has a high charge separation rate and a lower recombination rate. In Fig. 3a, the value of α is increased from 0.968 to 0.995 after adding the NiOx decorated GO. The combined measurements of light intensity-dependent Voc are shown in Fig. 3b. According to Voc = nkTln(I)/q + constant (where n is the ideality factor, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant and q is the elementary charge32,33), the decreased ideality factors demonstrate that NiOx decorated GO effectively suppresses the trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. EIS measurements were carried out to further explore the reactions undergone by photoexcited electrons at the interfaces, as shown in Fig. 3c and Table S6.†Rs is the series resistance at the high-frequency region, Rrec is the recombination resistance at the low range, and CPE is an ideal capacitor. The Rs of the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 PSC is smaller than that of the device based on pure CsPbBr3, which is attributed to the conductivity of GO. The Rrec values in the PSCs with CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 are determined to be 22.5 Ω cm2 and 13.6 Ω cm2, respectively. A small Rrec means low charge recombination; therefore, the photo-induced electron–hole recombination could be effectively suppressed. It is obvious that the addition of NiOx decorated GO in the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer has a positive impact on charge carrier recombination. This is due to the high quality CsPbBr3 film with suitable energy-level alignment and low trap-state density. In addition, the smaller CPE value for the NiOx/GO-2 tailored PSC demonstrates less interface charge accumulation than that of a pristine one. These results show that the additive facilitates electron–hole separation and carrier extraction, thereby leading to higher Voc, FF, and Jsc outputs.

To further understand the charge recombination, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics were recorded in the dark, as shown in Fig. 3d. The built-in electric fields (Vbi) can be obtained using the Mott–Schottky formula:34 1/C−2 = 2(V − Vbi − kBT/e)/εε0A2qND, where ε, ε0, kB, and q are the semiconductor's dielectric constant, free space's dielectric constant, Boltzmann's constant and electronic constant, respectively, and A is the area of the electrode, ND is the donor density, and T is the absolute temperature. The PSC with NiOx/GO-2 achieves a higher Vbi of 1.435 V than the pristine device, meaning a larger driving force and reduced interface trap states. Furthermore, a steep slope of a device with NiOx/GO-2 indicates less interfacial charge accumulation. The results illustrated the efficient charge extraction and reduced charge recombination achieved by adding NiOx decorated GO. Fig. S6† shows the J–V curves measured in the dark. Compared with the control CsPbBr3 solar cell, the CsPbBr3/NiOx/GO-2 PSC has a lower leakage current. This demonstrates that the p-type charge transfer doping of GO with NiOx causes a charge localization for reduced low-charge recombination,28 which also results in a high Voc output.
The performance deterioration of a PSC under the attack of high humidity or ultraviolet radiation is still a great challenge to their commercialization.35,36 To assess the stability of the best all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC modified by the NiOx/GO-2 additive, the cell was stored in the ambient air environment, and the photovoltaic data as a function of the storage time are exhibited in Fig. 4. The initial PCEs without and with NiOx/GO-2 treatment are 5.84% and 6.81%, respectively. The stability of PSCs with NiOx decorated GO is higher than that of the pristine one under the high humidity environment (85% RH, 25 °C). The unencapsulated device with NiOx/GO-2 still retains 94.2% of its initial efficiency after 21 days. Other parameters such as Voc, Jsc and FF do not degrade significantly. These results indicate that the use of NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO improves the lifetime of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. It has been previously found that a high-quality perovskite film could significantly increase the lifetime of a PSC.37,38 The high crystallinity indicates that all chemical elements are arranged in an orderly manner, which is not conducive to defects. According to reports in the literature, the defects are vulnerable to the ambient environment and usually become the sites where the degradation of CsPbBr3 to PbBr2 starts. The oxygenic groups of GO can bind with these sites to passivate defects. The decrease in defect density increases the quality of the CsPbBr3 film. As a result, the stability of PSCs is improved by adding NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO.

Conclusions
In brief, NiOx nanoparticle decorated GO has been successfully used as a hole collector to simultaneously increase the crystallinity of a CsPbBr3 film and charge extraction and to passivate perovskite defects. The abundant oxygenic groups in GO can combine with the lead ions of the perovskite precursor solution, allowing for the homogeneous dispersion of NiOx decorated GO in the lead bromide layer to control the reaction rate and form excessive perovskite crystal nuclei. Therefore, the grain size is increased and the grain boundary density is reduced. NiOx is a typical p-type hole-transporting material, and the electrons of oxygenic groups in GO transfer to NiOx nanoparticles because of their electropositivity to minimize the charge localization of GO, causing a p-type charge transfer doping of GO with NiOx nanoparticles. The NiOx decorated GO helps increase the hole extraction and electron–hole separation. Furthermore, the oxygenic groups of GO passivate the perovskite defects. As a result, the best device has a PCE of 8.59% and good stability.
