    , Accepted 22nd November 2021First published on 23rd November 2021AbstractSolar-driven photosynthesis to produce biomass and photocatalysis to reduce carbon dioxide are both carbon sinks. Efficient harvesting of high-performance photocatalysts from photosynthesis-derived biomass is hence promising to reduce the carbon footprint. Herein, a molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery that converts rice husks and silver chloride to silicon-carbide nanowires embedded in a carbon matrix with surface-loaded silver nanoparticles (SiC/C/Ag) is reported as a showcase of carbon-neutral utilization of biomass. The molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery features reduced CO2 emissions, low energy consumption, and compositional/structural refining of cathodic SiC/C/Ag. The resulting SiC/C/Ag shows noticeably enhanced overall CO2 photoreduction. Life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that the CO2 equivalent emission from the production of SiC/C/Ag is compensated for by photocatalytic reduction of gaseous CO2 for only 24.77 hours over the SiC/C/Ag.
Introduction
Carbon neutrality has gained worldwide consensus and is an urgent initiative. Carbon-neutral technologies are hence of prime importance.1–6 Photosynthesis is a naturally occurring process that converts CO2, H2O and inorganic nutrients into carbohydrates with inorganic components (e.g. bio-silica). This primary production serves as a carbon sink to produce biomass using massive amounts of CO2. By mimicking photosynthesis to reduce the CO2 footprint, artificial photosynthesis, viz. photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals, has been regarded as a promising route to realize energy and environmental sustainability.7–11 Harvesting photocatalysts is, however, costly and more importantly carbon-intensive from the viewpoint of life cycle assessment (LCA).12–14 An efficient refinery of biomass to produce high-performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction is intriguing.
Oxygen and silicon are the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, causing biomass to contain considerable amounts of bio-silica.15,16 Rice husks (RHs) are typical biomass composed of organic mass, silica and trace impurities. The difficulty in refining RHs to photocatalysts lies in the enormous amount of CO2 emission from combustion of organic mass,17,18 sluggish kinetics to remove oxygen from silica,19 and impurities retarding the spatial separation of photo-induced charges.20 Molten salt electrolysis has been used for industrial preparation of active metals from metal oxides, which was recently demonstrated by a promising preparation of silicon from silica.21–24 Molten salts are anaerobic and high-temperature media for pyrolysis of organic mass into carbon. The generated carbon accelerates electro-deoxidation of silica and functionalizing the generated silicon by carbonization.25–27 Molten salts have a strong absorption towards CO2, offering in situ capture and conversion of CO2 in molten salt electrolyzers.28–32 Molten salts also allow high dissolution of impurities in RHs, accommodating self-purification of biomass-derived photocatalysts.17 The aforementioned merits of molten salt electrolyzers indicate that molten salt electrochemical treatment of RHs to produce photocatalysts is a promising method contributing to carbon neutrality. Energy efficiency for photocatalyst harvesting and performance of overall CO2 photoreduction are the key enabling factors to achieve practical carbon neutrality at an LCA level, which, however, remains to be established.
We herein report a molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery for carbon-neutral utilization of biomass. Molten salt electrolysis of a cathode consisting of RHs and AgCl generates cathodic SiC/C/Ag and anodic CO2. By introducing AgCl into the RH cathode, energy consumption of the biorefining process significantly decreases, and the obtained SiC/C/Ag exhibits noticeably enhanced photocatalytic activity. A threshold as low as 24.77 hours for solar-driven photocatalytic reduction of gaseous CO2 over the biorefinery-derived SiC/C/Ag achieves carbon neutrality at an LCA level.
Experimental
Molten salt treatment
NaCl–CaCl2 molten salt (500 g in total mass, with a molar ratio of 48:52) was used as the electrolyte. The well mixed salts were put into an alumina crucible. The crucible containing the salts was then put into an alumina crucible reactor, followed by drying at 400 °C for 24 h to remove moisture. After that, the reactor was vacuum-purged and continuously flushed by a high-purity argon flow, and then the temperature was raised to 800 °C. Pre-electrolysis was conducted at a constant cell voltage of 2.6 V for 15 h with a graphite rod as the anode (15 mm in diameter) and a nickel plate as the cathode to further remove the dissolved H2O and impurities. The RH–AgCl pellet cathode was prepared as follows. A certain amount of AgCl was added to an aqueous suspension of 1 g RHs. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 hours without light, and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C to obtain RH–AgCl powder. And the RH–AgCl powder was pressed into pellets (1.0 ± 0.05 g, 20 mm × 2 mm in diameter × thickness) under 5 MPa. Finally, the RH–AgCl pellets were tightly wrapped by porous nickel and used as the cathodes. After the above procedure, the RH–AgCl pellet cathode was inserted into the molten salts to start electrolysis at 2.6 V (Fig. 1a). After electrolysis for 2 h, the sample was collected by ultrasonic leaching with deionized water several times and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The mass of the obtained sample is about 163 mg. The obtained sample is named SiC/C/Ag-x (x = 1, 3, 5 and 7, the mass percentage of AgCl to RHs). The SiC/C sample was prepared by replacing the RH–AgCl mixture with RHs by the same procedure. The SiC and SiC/Ag samples were prepared by annealing the SiC/C or SiC/C/Ag in air at 550 °C for 2 h, respectively. The electrolysis acid treatment of RHs (A-RHs) (180 mg) and SiO2 (150 mg) was also carried out under the same conditions.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Rigaku Miniflex600 X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss SIGMA). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer system. All of the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar 3020 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). CO2 adsorption isotherms were determined at 273 K using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL spectra for the solid samples were investigated on an Edinburgh FLS-920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh, UK). The quantitative analysis was performed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 730). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample in air was carried out using a Mettler Toledo DSC1 TGA apparatus. Contact potential difference (CPD) was measured on a Kelvin probe apparatus (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland).
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a homemade three-electrode quartz cell using a multichannel electrochemical workstation (Solartron Analytical 1470E). A Pt plate and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, which was ultrasonicated in ethanol for 30 minutes and dried at 80 °C. 5 mg of photocatalyst powder and 50 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water, containing 45% water) were added into 0.5 mL of DMF to obtain a slurry by ultrasonication. The slurry was spread onto FTO glass, whose side part was previously protected using Scotch tape. After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 80 °C for 2 h to improve adhesion. Then, the Scotch tape was unstuck, and the uncoated part of the electrode was isolated with epoxy resin. The Mott–Schottky (MS) measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the photocurrent measurement were conducted in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). A 300 W Xe lamp system was used as a light source.
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence of H2O vapor was carried out in a 40 mL Schlenk flask at ambient temperature (Fig. 1b). A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfectlight) was used as the light source, and the light power density is 300 mW cm−2 measured using a photoradiometer (PL-MW2000, Beijing Perfectlight). 50 mg of photocatalyst was placed into the reaction tube. Then, this system was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO2 gas. This evacuation–filling operation was repeated three times. Finally, 20 μL of pure water was introduced into the reactor via the silicone rubber septum. The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 3 h. The stability test was performed for 5 h per cycle; the reaction system was evacuated after every 5 h and refilled with CO2 and pure water. After the irradiation, the production amount of CO, CH4 and O2 was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a barrier discharge ionization detector (BID).
Results and discussion
Structural characteristics
Constant-voltage electrolysis in molten NaCl–CaCl2 at 800 °C was conducted at 2.6 V for 2 hours between the solid RH–AgCl cathode and graphite anode. Pyrolysis of organic mass into carbon, electrochemical reduction of silica to SiC, and electrochemical reduction of AgCl into Ag simultaneously occur, generating cathodic SiC/C/Ag and anodic CO2.17,21,27 The obtained cathodic samples are denoted as SiC/C/Ag-x, where x represents the mass percentage of AgCl against RH in the precursors. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of SiC/C/Ag-5 show that the molten salt electrochemical biorefinery is a nanostructuring of RHs, as evidenced by the generation of SiC nanowires (NWs) embedded in a carbon matrix (Fig. S1, S2 and 2a–c). Surface modification of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) over the SiC NWs is also confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 2d–f) and the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images (Fig. 2g–j and S2 in the ESI†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S3a and S4a†) patterns show the existence of cubic SiC (JCPDS No. 29-1129), graphitic carbon and cubic Ag (JCPDS No. 04-0783). SiC, SiC/C and SiC/Ag samples were also prepared by a similar protocol in the control experiments. The composition of the samples was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S5†) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), the results of which are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.† After the molten salt treatment, the amounts of impurities in SiC/C/Ag are much lower than those in RHs (Table S3†), thus ensuring the self-purification ability of the preparation technique.

Well-defined Ag–SiC and SiC–C interfaces appear in SiC/C/Ag-5, beneficial for light absorption and transfer of photogenerated charges. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS, Fig. S3b†) and the corresponding Tauc plot (Fig. S6†) show the absorption band edge at around 500 nm for SiC, and a band gap of 2.47 eV for SiC. Compared with SiC, a red shift of optical absorption and improved absorption ability occur in the samples with carbon and/or Ag incorporation and the light absorption intensity enhanced with the increase of Ag loading (Fig. S3b and S4b†). A plasmonic absorption band of Ag NPs appears at 400–500 nm in the UV-vis DRS of the SiC/Ag-5 sample (Fig. S3b†), which is absent in SiC/C/Ag-5 due to the masking of carbon. Based on the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S7a†) and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS, Fig. S7b†), VB and conduction band (CB) positions of SiC are located at 1.25 and −1.22 V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE, pH = 7). The incorporation of carbon and Ag also leads to increased surface area (Fig. S8 and Table S4†), higher CO2 uptake (Fig. S9†) and hopefully more photocatalytically active sites. An electron transfer from C to SiC in SiC/C/Ag-5 is suggested by the negatively shifted Si–C signals (Fig. 2k and l) and shifted metallic Ag peak (Fig. 2m). Nitrogen doping into carbon instead of SiC is also confirmed by XPS (Fig. 2l and S10†).27
Photocatalytic performance and mechanism
Photocatalytic overall CO2 reduction over the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation in the presence of H2O vapor. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the products consist of CO, CH4 and O2. Control experiments performed in the dark or without the photocatalyst show the absence of CO and CH4, indicating the nature of CO2 photoreduction (Fig. S11†). SiC/C/Ag-5 shows the highest photocatalytic performance, achieving a CO formation rate of 48.0 μmol g−1 and CH4 evolution rate of 7.0 μmol g−1. A lower and the lowest performance occur in the SiC/C and SiC samples, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO2 photoreduction at 365 nm is calculated to be 0.32% over SiC/C/Ag-5 (Fig. S12†). The decreased photoactivity of SiC/C/Ag-7 is attributed to the excessive amounts of Ag covering the active sites of SiC. The photocatalytic performance of the SiC/C/Ag-5 hybrid is also superior to that of most previously reported results regarding analogous photocatalyst systems (Table S5†). O2 is detected meanwhile by gas chromatography (Fig. S13 and S14†). SiC/C/Ag-5 displays a higher selectivity to CH4. Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S15 and Table S6†) shows that SiC/C/Ag-5 exhibits a smaller slope value than SiC/C, indicating a higher charge carrier density (ND) in SiC/C/Ag-5.33 Higher ND facilitates 8-electron CH4 production. The 13CO2 isotope labeling analysis shows the characteristic peaks of 13CH4 and 13CO at m/z = 17.0 and 29.0 in the gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy spectrum (Fig. 3b), confirming that the produced CH4 and CO originate from photocatalytic reduction of CO2. SiC/C/Ag-5 shows stable activity during the recycling experiments (Fig. 3c), mainly due to a robust structure during the CO2 photoreduction (Fig. S16 and S17†). Photocurrent responses (Fig. 3d), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. 3e), photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 3f) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. 3g and Table S7†) confirm that SiC/C/Ag-5 shows the highest photocurrent, facilitated charge transfer, enhanced spatial separation of photo-induced charges and longest charge carrier lifetime. Due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation over loaded Ag NPs, SiC/C/Ag-5 is photocatalytically active even under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation (Fig. 3h and i). Hot electrons of Ag NPs could inject into the CB of SiC, enhancing the CO2 photoreduction over SiC/C/Ag-5.33–35

Besides the electron transfer at the SiC–Ag interface, the interfacial charge transfer pathway between SiC and C is illustrated by using a Kelvin probe (Fig. 4a). The average contact potential difference (CPD) of SiC, C and SiC/C is 500, 40 and 360 mV, respectively. Accordingly, the Fermi energy levels (Ef) of SiC, C and SiC/C are calculated to be −4.75, −4.29 and −4.61 eV (Fig. 4b and c). Upon intimate contact between SiC and C, electrons migrate from C to SiC to reach equilibrium. A space charge region (SCR) with positively charged carbon and negatively charged SiC is formed to drive photogenerated-electron migration from SiC to C (Fig. 4c). To further verify the charge transfer route, the photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles was executed for SiC/C/Ag-5. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, the Pt nanoparticles are clearly deposited on the surface of C, while there are no lattice fringes of Pt observed on SiC NWs. These results convincingly verify that C mainly serves as an active site for photocatalytic reduction while SiC serves as a photocatalytic oxidation site.

A mechanism for photocatalytic CO2 reduction over the SiC/C/Ag is rationalized in Fig. 4g. The different work functions of SiC and Ag determine the formation of a Schottky-barrier SiC–Ag interface.36 Under irradiation, hot electrons in SPR states are ballistically injected over the Schottky barrier from plasmonic Ag into the CB of SiC. Moreover, photoexcited electrons are excited from the VB of SiC to the CB, leaving holes in the VB simultaneously. The photoexcited electrons rapidly migrate from SiC to C, reducing gaseous CO2 to yield CO and CH4. In the meantime, the photoexcited holes in the VB of SiC oxidize H2O to generate O2. Accordingly, the rationally designed SiC/C/Ag achieves a synergetic utilization of visible light-driven plasmonic hot electron injection, enhanced surface redox reactions and enhanced spatial separation of photo-induced charges.
Energy consumption and environmental impact assessment
Decreasing energy consumption is an essential and central part of chemistry. Energy consumption of the molten salt electrolysis of different feedstocks is calculated based on the mass of the products and passed charge (Fig. 5a). In comparison with electrolysis of SiO2 to Si and electrolysis of A-RHs to Si/C,17,27 the electrolysis of the RH cathode to SiC/C presents a lower energy consumption (Fig. S18†). The decreased energy consumption is due to increased electrical conductivity of the cathode from carbonization.17 By incorporating Ag NPs to further increase the electrical conductivity of the cathode, the lowest energy consumption of 7.04 kW h kgSiC−1 is fulfilled in electrolysis of RH–AgCl to SiC/C/Ag.21
 Fig. 5  (a) Energy consumption in the preparation of different samples, the concentration variation (ΔC) of CO2 and O2 during electrolysis of (b) RH–AgCl and (c) RHs, and (d) gas production during electrolysis. 
Molten salt is a high-temperature and highly corrosive medium. Carbon-based materials (e.g. graphite) are the state-of-the-art anode materials for molten salt electrolysis. Upon molten salt electrolysis of oxides, generation of anodic CO2 over the carbon anode is inevitable. Electrolysis of 1 g RH with a graphite anode causes a theoretical anodic CO2 emission of 2.45 mmol. Significantly decreased anodic CO2 emissions, however, occur in the experimental runs of electrolysis of RH or RH–AgCl (about 1.65 mmol in Fig. 5b–d and S19†). The anomalously decreased CO2 emissions are accompanied by O2 evolution (about 0.79 mmol) over the graphite anode, agreeing well with in situ CO2 conversion in molten salts.29,30,37 The electro-deoxidation of silica and pyrolysis of organic mass generate O2−, which has high solubility in the molten salt. The in situ generated anodic CO2 is captured by O2− in the melts to generate carbonates. The formed carbonates are then electrolyzed to cathodic carbon and anodic O2. The in situ CO2 conversion process in the molten salt biorefinery achieves a reduction of direct CO2 emission by more than 30%.
LCA shows that the CO2 equivalent emission from SiC/C/Ag-5 production is 0.02 tCO2 tSiC/C/Ag-5−1, which is lower than that of SiC/C (Fig. 6, S20, and S21, and Tables S8 and S9†), suggesting an advantage of introducing the Ag into the RH cathode. The CO2 conversion rate of SiC/C/Ag-5 is 18.35 mol per ton per hour, which is higher than that of SiC/C (6.57 mol per ton per hour). The CO2 emitted during the production of raw materials and electrolysis can be fixed by photosynthesis of RH and reduced by photocatalysis over RH-derived photocatalysts. Therefore, to achieve theoretical carbon neutrality, the SiC/C/Ag-5 photocatalyst only needs to run under sunlight irradiation for 24.77 h, while the SiC/C needs to operate for 563.86 h. The time needed by the SiC/C/Ag-5 photocatalyst production system to achieve carbon neutrality falls in the range of stable operation of the catalyst (Fig. 3c), establishing a practical carbon-neutral utilization of biomass.

Conclusions
In summary, a molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery for conversion of RH and AgCl to SiC/C/Ag with excellent photocatalytic activity is demonstrated as a practical carbon-neutral utilization of biomass. The molten salt electrochemical process integrates electro-deoxidation of silica, pyrolysis of organic mass, metallization of Ag, and in situ conversion of CO2. The process hence offers low energy consumption, reduced CO2 emissions, and microstructural modulation of photocatalysts, bridging the gap between solar-driven photosynthesis to produce biomass and photocatalysis to reduce carbon dioxide. Molten salt electrochemistry is a classic topic of industrial extraction of active metals. The present study successfully extends the scope of molten salt electrochemistry from metallurgy to utilization of biomass, and to reduction of carbon dioxide, endowing molten salt electrochemistry with a new scientific meaning of generic technology towards carbon neutrality.
