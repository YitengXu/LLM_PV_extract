    , Accepted 31st October 2019First published on 31st October 2019AbstractAn aqueous solution approach, integrating atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition, is proposed to grow a high-quality Sb2S3 thin film. The Sb2S3 thin film is uniform and dense with a bandgap of 1.78 eV. The photocurrent density of the Sb2S3 sensitized TiO2 array electrode is 40 μA cm−2, which is nearly 25 and 93 times than that of TiO2 and Sb2S3 photoanodes, respectively.
Antimony chalcogenides (Sb–S, Sb–Se, and Sb–S–Se) have attracted a great deal of attentions due to the high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1 at 450 nm), suitable bandgap (1.2–1.7 eV), earth-abundance of the constituent elements, intrinsic large dipole moment, multiple excitations, and good stability against air/moisture.1–5 They are excellent candidates for light sensitizers in solar cells and photoelectrochemical devices. For example, the Seok group has reported Sb2S3 as a sensitizer for an inorganic–organic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.4%.6 Zhang et al. have fabricated a bandgap gradient Sb2(S, Se)3 solar cell with a certified efficiency of over 6%.7 S. I. Seak has achieved the highest efficiency for fully solid-state chalcogenide-sensitized solar cells of 7.5% with Sb2S3.8 Tang's group has used Sb2Se3 thin films to fabricate solar cells with a stable efficiency of 7.6%.9–11 Sb2Se3 also has been used as a photocathode for conversion of solar light to hydrogen with excellent performance by Moon's group.12–15 Therefore, intensive efforts have been expected to improve the performance of antimony chalcogenide devices. Recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has gained particular attention for growing high quality thin films.16–18 Bachmann has used ALD to grow an ultrathin (10 nm) Sb2S3 absorber coating with an efficiency of 2.6%.19 Sung has grown a high quality Sb2S3 film with a controllable thickness and good reproducibility using ALD with a high efficiency of 5.77%.20 However, a slow growth rate of 100–300 nm h−1 under a high vacuum environment as well as complex and expensive instruments largely limit its application on an industrial scale.6 In addition, Tang's group has done a lot of interesting work by rapid thermal evaporation of Sb2S3 power under a vacuum pressure of ∼1 Pa.4,9,11,21 As is well known, the chemical solution technique has native advantage for large-scale processes since it is compatible with large area printing techniques. Typically, chemical bath deposition (CBD) is a convenient, cost-efficient and large-scale method for growing Sb2S3 thin films.22 Recently, Seak's group has reported a Sb2S3 sensitized TiO2 inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cell prepared by CBD with a PCE of 5.1%,3 while after treatment by thioacetamide, the PCE improved to 7.5%.8 However, this group reported that during a conventional CBD the insoluble SbOCl is easy to form due to the hydrolyzing of SbCl3 in water.20 To minimize the formation of the secondary phase and the concentration gradient, some experimental factors such as pH, reaction temperature, substrate position in the solution etc. have been optimized.23 Unfortunately, the oxide/hydroxide phases inevitably appeared, such as Sb2O3, Sb(OH)3, and SbOCl, resulting in the electron–hole recombination centers and hence a lower performance.6,17 Therefore, it seems to be indispensable to develop a chemical solution approach to grow pure Sb2S3 thin film.
Here, we developed an aqueous solution approach, integrating ALD and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), to grow a high-quality thin film. The combination of the advantages of ALD and CVD ensures the pure growth of Sb2S3 thin films. In this approach, a Sb-precursor as the Sb source is prepared through hydrogen bonding between Sb3+ and polyethyleneimine (PEI) in an aqueous solution while thiourea (TU) is used as the S source. The molecular precursor is decomposed into Sb atoms, reacting with H2S evolved from TU decomposition, resulting in direct growth of pure Sb2S3 thin films. The Sb2S3 thin film is uniform and dense with a bandgap of 1.78 eV. As is well known, TiO2 is a promising candidate for the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction due to its remarkable photoactivity, while the performance of pristine TiO2 nanoarrays is restricted by the large bandgap (3.2 eV) making it absorb mainly ultraviolet (UV) range radiation.24,25 Meanwhile, Sb2S3 has a high optical absorption coefficient and narrow bandgap allowing good sunlight harvesting in the UV-visible light region. In addition, Sb2S3 exhibits suitable energy band coupling with TiO2, which is beneficial for charge carrier transfer. Here the photoelectrochemical performance of Sb2S3 has been investigated as a sensitizer on TiO2 nanoarrays.
Firstly, we prepared a Sb3+ aqueous precursor solution as reported in the experimental section of the supporting information. The Sb3+ forms a stable complex with PEI via hydrogen bonding during the synthesis process, which can form a molecular homogenous aqueous solution. In addition, the molecular solution is purified by filtration to remove non-coordinated cation and anion species. By those processes, the prepared Sb3+ aqueous precursor solution is clear and can be stored for several months. Secondly, TU as a sulfur source was added into the prepared Sb3+ precursor solution. In addition, TU is an organic complexing agent, which can form stable complexes with many metal ions in aqueous solution. As a strong ligand, it can combine with metal ionic bonds by the non-bonding electron pairs of the nitrogen atoms or the selective complexation of sulfur atoms with metal ions. That is, an aqueous solution containing Sb3+ and TU would form a stable and transparent precursor solution after stirring for several minutes. Finally, Sb2S3 films could be obtained by spin-coating and annealing in argon atmosphere as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the Sb2S3 film growing process. 
To identify the reaction process during the annealing, Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†) present the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the annealed samples regarding the precursor solutions with TU and without TU. In Fig. S1 (ESI†), the XRD pattern of the sample from the Sb3+ precursor without TU matches well with the PDF card (PDF#71-1173) of elementary Sb. This illustrates that the metal ions are reduced to fresh metal atoms while the PEI can be decomposed into small molecules. This process is similar to a physical atomic deposition process. As for the XRD pattern of the sample from the precursor with TU on the quartz substrate, Fig. S1(b) (ESI†) shows that all the peaks can be indexed to Sb2S3 (PDF#42-1393) without any other secondary phase. During this process, the TU decomposes into H2S, and the H2S reacts with the fresh Sb atoms to form Sb2S3, which is similar to a CVD process. In addition, Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of the annealed sample from the precursor spin-coated on the FTO substrates. Compared with the XRD pattern of FTO, the peaks at 15.7°, 17.5°, 24.8°, 29.2° and 35.5° are identified as the (200), (120), (130), (211) and (240) planes from left to right, which fit well with the standard PDF data (PDF#42-1393). Therefore, pure and crystalline Sb2S3 films can be obtained by the aqueous precursor approach along with TU under annealing. It is worthy of note that the purity of the thin film is independent of the substrate even if we change different substrates to grow the thin films. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful measurement to analyse the structure of the sample. Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectrum of the Sb2S3 films using 532 nm laser wavelength as the excitation power. Peaks appearing at the positions of 110 cm−1, 145 cm−1, 186 cm−1, 237 cm−1, 281 cm−1 and 300 cm−1 belong to the Raman vibration peaks of the antimony sulfide stibnite phase. Among them, the vibration peaks at 110 cm−1 and 145 cm−1 indicate that the as-grown Sb2S3 films form a crystalline phase, and the vibration peaks at 281 cm−1 and 300 cm−1 are assigned to the symmetric vibration of the pyramid element with the C3v symmetric structure of antimony sulfide, which are consistent with the literature report.17 XRD and Raman results show that there is no other secondary impurity phase in the final films. To further investigate the quality of the thin film, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are used to characterize the valence states of the Sb2S3 thin film. The full spectrum, Sb 3d core level and S 2p core level of Sb2S3 films are shown in Fig. 2(c)–(e), respectively. Fig. 2(c) exhibits the Sb and S in the full spectrum. From Fig. 2(d), the binding energy peak at 528.9 eV and 538.3 eV correspond to Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2, respectively, which is indexed to the Sb3+ states of the Sb2S3 thin films. The S 2p spectrum fits the single states of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 at 160.7 eV and 161.8 eV, which are assigned to the S2− state. The separation between Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 is 9.4 eV and that between S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 is 1.1 eV.8 Therefore, only trivalent antimony and divalent sulfur are found in the Sb2S3 films, and no characteristic peak of sulfur–oxygen binding energy is found in narrow-spectrum scanning, which usually occurs in the CBD method to grow Sb2S3 films.3 All the evidence demonstrates that the as-grown Sb2S3 films with high quality are different from the previous aqueous solution approach.26

From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Sb2S3 in which the Sb2S3 film is composed of particles with the films annealed on the FTO substrate as shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S2 (ESI†), an average size of about 400 nm can be found. It is worthy of note that the particle size can be grown to be larger than a micrometer which is very useful for the photoelectric performance of the thin films’ device. In addition, the thin film without obvious cracks is dense and uniform in different magnifications. To further investigate the microstructure of Sb2S3, the as-grown film was scraped off the FTO substrate to prepare the TEM sample. Fig. 3(b) presents a clear TEM image of the Sb2S3 films. The lattice fringes can be seen very clear and no other secondary phases were found. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern from the blue box area shows a regular pattern, which reveals the monocrystal feature of the selected area. High-resolution TEM images are presented in Fig. 3(c and d). These atoms arrange repeatedly and the different lattice fringes correspond to different lattice spacing. It can be indexed to the (231) crystal plane with 0.242 nm lattice spacing and the (631) crystal plane with 0.153 nm lattice spacing, respectively. These lattice interplanar spacings are consistent with the diffraction peaks measured by XRD (2θ = 36.9°, 60.1°), which proves that the as-grown Sb2S3 films are high quality. The above structural characterizations illustrate that the Sb2S3 films have excellent crystallinity for potential semiconductor devices.

In order to measure the optical band gap of the as-obtained Sb2S3, the thin film was grown on a quartz substrate. Fig. 4(a) shows that the absorption range of the Sb2S3 film is less than 800 nm. The optical band gap Eg of Sb2S3 is estimated using the Tauc plot method with a linear extrapolation to (αhυ) = 0.27 The linear extrapolation of the Tauc plot gives an optical band gap of 1.78 eV for the Sb2S3 films, which is suitable for harvesting solar light. Photoluminescence measurements were carried out to verify the band gap as well as the radiative recombination of Sb2S3 films. There is a fluorescence absorption peak at 696 nm in Fig. 4(b), which is consistent with the calculated optical band gap value of 1.78 eV. The photoluminescence spectrum illustrates less nonradiative recombination suggesting the high quality growth of Sb2S3 films.28 Optical characterizations show that the obtained films have advantageous features for harvesting solar light. As mentioned previously, the large bandgap of TiO2 limits its efficiency improvement in photoelectrochemical reactions.29 Meanwhile, Sb2S3 with a suitable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and desirable energy band coupling with TiO2 allows an easy charge carrier transfer as shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†).30 Therefore, the photoelectrochemical performance of the Sb2S3–TiO2 composite thin film is investigated in our study. Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) shows that the photocurrent density of one deposition layer of Sb2S3 on the FTO substrate is ∼178 nA cm−2. Compared with the photocurrent density of the one layer Sb2S3 thin film, the photocurrent density of Sb2S3 films with two layers improves to ∼400 nA cm−2 (Fig. S4(b), ESI†). To further improve the performance of the Sb2S3 thin film, the Sb2S3 is coupled on the traditional photoanode TiO2 arrays. This not only shows good energy band alignment, but also extends the absorption range (Fig. S3(b), ESI†). The photocurrent density is measured for the TiO2, Sb2S3 and TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes as shown in Fig. 4(c). The TiO2 electrodes were prepared on FTO substrates by a hydrothermal method for 20 h. The length for the TiO2 array is around 2.5 μm as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The Sb2S3 electrodes with two layers were grown on FTO substrate. The TiO2/Sb2S3 composite electrode was prepared by a spin-coated Sb-precursor with TU on TiO2 arrays and annealed twice under Ar flow at 400 °C. As can be seen in Fig. 4(c), the corresponding photocurrent density of TiO2, Sb2S3 and TiO2/Sb2S3 is 1.58 μA cm−2, 0.43 μA cm−2, and 11.5 μA cm−2, respectively. The photocurrent density of the composite thin film is about 7 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanodes. This reveals that the composite structures have a great effect on the improvement of the photocurrent density. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density of TiO2 is related to the length and density of the TiO2 arrays.31,32 To investigate the effect of the TiO2 array length on the photocurrent density for the composite photoanode, different lengths of TiO2 arrays are integrated with the Sb2S3 films. Herein, different lengths of TiO2 arrays were synthesized under different hydrothermal reaction times (2 h, 5 h and 10 h). From the SEM images in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the length of the obtained TiO2 arrays is 1 μm, 1.5 μm, 2 μm, respectively. As the length of the TiO2 nanoarrays increases (Fig. 4(d)), the photocurrent density of the composite photoanodes does not increase. When the length of the TiO2 nanoarrays is 1.5 μm, the highest photocurrent density of 40 μA cm−2 is achieved, which is nearly 25 and 93 times that of TiO2 and Sb2S3 photoanodes, respectively. The main reason is due to the diffusion length of the electrons and holes in the Sb2S3–TiO2 composite photoanode. It is clear that the Sb2S3 films have a positive effect on the TiO2 photoanodes and the length of the TiO2 arrays could moderate the diffusion of electrons and holes. To further improve the performance of the composite photoanodes, the different thicknesses of Sb2S3 on TiO2 nanoarrays (5 h) were investigated in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and the morphology of the composite thin film is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). This demonstrates that the interspaces of the TiO2 nanoarrays are filled by Sb2S3. It is interesting to find that the photocurrent density of the TiO2 arrays with two layers and three layers of Sb2S3 deposition is similar and the photocurrent density is about 40 μA cm−2. More importantly, the composite electrode shows good stability in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Therefore, the thinner Sb2S3 thin films on TiO2 cannot absorb enough solar light while the thicker Sb2S3 thin films on TiO2 do not benefit from transport of the photogenerated electron and hole pairs.

In conclusion, a high quality Sb2S3 thin film has been grown via an aqueous solution approach, including the advantages of both ALD and CVD. Sb3+ coordinates to PEI and TU to form a homogeneous precursor solution, guaranteeing high quality growth on the molecular level. The molecular precursor is decomposed into Sb atoms (like ALD), which react with H2S evolved from TU decomposition (like CVD), resulting in direct growth of pure Sb2S3 thin films. The Sb2S3 thin film is uniform and dense with a bandgap of 1.78 eV. Photoelectrochemical properties show that the highest photocurrent density of the TiO2/Sb2S3 based composite photoanodes achieved is as high as 40 μA cm−2, which is nearly 25 and 93 times that of the TiO2 and Sb2S3 photoanodes, respectively. This work will not only provide an optional method for growing high quality metal chalcogenides, but will also give a profound insight into integration atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition.
