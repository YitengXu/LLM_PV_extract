    , Accepted 31st January 2013First published on 5th February 2013AbstractThe ultra-small-sized NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles and hybrid L-NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ (L: dehydro-1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid) nanoparticles have been prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis and water bath reflux method. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, UV-vis absorption spectra, diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as kinetic decay are used to characterize the resulting samples. The hybrid nanoparticles display a broad absorption band from 230 nm to 530 nm by monitoring 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ at 977 nm. Upon the excitation of π–π* transition of the organic 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (label with H4L), the strong NIR emission at about 1000 nm that matches to energy of Si band gap of Si-based solar cells is obtained. As a downconversion luminescent converter, this kind of material might be useful in Si-based solar cells to reduce thermalization loss and enhance conversion efficiency of solar cells via spectral modification.
Introduction
Since the quantum cutting in Eu3+–Gd3+ material was reported by Wegh et al.,1 this kind of material has been widely investigated for applications in the noble gas discharge tube lamp source for the vacuum-UV to visible quantum cutting1–4 and the solar cells for the visible to near infrared quantum cutting.5–31 The latter has rapidly developed in recent years. By cutting one high energy photon into two or more low energy photons with energy close to the band gap of the Si solar cell (i.e. NIR QC), the thermalization losses can be reduced and the efficiency of solar cells can also be enhanced via modifying solar spectrum.
NIR QC can be realized by using coupled rare earth (RE) ions due to their unique energy level structures and high quantum efficiency. Presently, there are numerous reports in a variety of RE ions couples, including Tb3+–Yb3+, Tm3+–Yb3+, Pr3+–Yb3+, Nd3+–Yb3+, Er3+–Yb3+, Ce3+–Yb3+ and Ho3+–Yb3+etc. Among them, the Tb3+–Yb3+ ion couple became focus of research for NIR QC because the energy difference between the Tb3+ 5D4 to 7F6 energy levels is about twice that of the Yb3+ 2F5/2 to 2F7/2 transition, and the Yb3+ 2F5/2 to 2F7/2 emission (about 1000 nm) matches well with the band gap energy of Si. Moreover, the cooperative down-conversion by transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+ ions has been tested to enhance the response of the photovoltaic solar cells.12,13 For the matrices of NIR QC materials, there are a number of studies in fluorides, borates, phosphates and tungstate systems. Among them, fluorides are optimal host matrix materials for NIR QC due to their unique properties, such as low phonon energy, low refractive index, high ionicity, wide band gap, adequate thermal and environmental stability as well as large solubility for RE3+ ions. However, these RE3+ ion couples co-doped with fluorides for NIR QC also possess intrinsic limits, i.e., there is no allowed absorbance in the UV region, thus limiting their practical application. Specially, f → f transitions of RE3+ ions doped in fluorides are Laporte forbidden. The principal disadvantage of RE3+ ions as phosphors is the low molar absorptivity (ε = 1–10 M−1 cm−1)32 associated with 4f → 4f transitions and low absorption cross section (absorption cross section of Tb3+ in the order of 10−21 cm2,33 and no absorption for Yb3+ ions in UV-vis range), leading to inefficient optical excitation and low luminescence intensity.
Rare Earth (RE) organic/inorganic hybrid materials can take advantage of the beneficial properties of both materials of organic ligands and inorganic host materials. Briefly, the excitation wavelength used is in resonance with a strong ligands absorbance. The excited ligands then efficiently transfers its energy to the RE3+ ions and achieve efficient emission. This is so-called “antenna effect”, which will allow for a large increase of the luminescence intensity through indirect excitation, and for the possibility to tune the absorption cross section into regions where the fluoride nanoparticles do not have absorption normally. The net result of so-called “antennae effect” is to increase the effective molar extinction coefficient of the phosphor complexes by several orders of magnitude.34 At the same time, the inorganic fluorides matrixes protect RE3+ cations from sources of nonradiative deactivation, and the luminescence is enhanced.
Herein, in the paper, we prepared the hybrid materials of organic 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4L) with inorganic NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles for the first time. The structure, morphology, photoluminescence (PL) properties in UV-vis and NIR region, fluorescence decay dynamics of the hybrid materials are investigated systematically.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
The rare earth oxides RE2O3 (99.999%) (RE = Y, Tb, Yb) were purchased from Science and Technology Parent Company of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, and other chemicals were purchased from Beijing Chemical Company. All chemicals are of analytical grade reagents and used directly without further purification. Rare earth nitrate stock solutions of 0.2 M were prepared by dissolving the corresponding rare earth oxides in dilute HNO3 under heating with agitation.
Preparation of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10) nanoparticles
In a typical procedure for the preparation of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol% Yb3+ nanoparticles, 13.16 mL Y(NO3)3 (0.2 M), 0.14 mL Tb(NO3)3 and 0.70 mL Yb(NO3)3 were added into 40 mL of aqueous solution containing 28 mmol of trisodium citrate (labeled as Cit3−) to form a transparent solution under vigorous stirring. After vigorous stirring for 20 min, 20 mL of aqueous solution containing 8.4 mmol of NaF was introduced into the above solution. Then the mixing solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon autoclave, sealed, maintained 24 h at 180 °C and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The resulting nanoparticles were precipitated by adding ethanol and separated from the suspension by centrifugation. The precipitates were washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried in vacuum at 75 °C overnight. The NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 10) nanoparticles were prepared in a similar way as described above for the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles.
Preparation of H4L/NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10) hybrid nanoparticles
In a typical experiment, the appropriate amounts of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic anhydride were added into 40 mL of deionized water, and then 1 mL of ethanol was added to form transparent H4L aqueous solution. The as-prepared NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed into H4L aqueous solution. The solution was maintained at 65 °C for 4 h in a reflux system and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting products were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water and dried in vacuum at 75 °C overnight.
Characterizations
X-Ray power diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer at a scanning rate of 5 deg min−1 in the 2θ range from 15° to 80°, with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010, 200 kV) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 S–Twin transmission electron microscope) with a field emission gun operated at 200 kV were used. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 580B IR spectrophotometer in KBr pellets. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a U-3310 scanning spectrophotometer. The diffuse reflectance spectra were measured with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (HITACHI U–4100). The UV-vis photoluminescence spectra were obtained by a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The NIR photoluminescence spectra were studied using an FLS-920 spectrometer. The decay curves measurements were performed by using a tunable laser (Continuum Sunlite OPO (pulse width = 4 ns)) as excitation source. The decay curves were obtained via a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 digital oscilloscope (1 GHz). All measurements were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology
The composition and phase purity of the nanoparticles were examined by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the representative XRD patterns of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+, L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and the standard JCPDS card (No. 06–0342), respectively. All diffraction peaks of the samples can be readily indexed to pure NaYF4. Due to the small-size nature of the particles, a significant broadening of the diffraction peak is observed. Such relatively small sizes are compatible to use in light-converter of Si-based solar cells because small size can avoid optical scatter and improve light transmission of converter. The average size of nanoparticles was estimated for each as-prepared samples from the Scherrer formula, D = Kλ/βcosθ, where D is the average particle size, λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15405 nm), β is the full-width at half-maximum, θ is the diffraction angle of an observed peak, K is a constant (0.89), respectively. The estimated average size of nanoparticles is listed in Table 1. In addition, all the diffraction peaks of RE3+ doped NaYF4 samples have a slight shift to lower angle compared with the pure NaYF4. This is because Tb3+ ion has a bigger radius than Y3+ ion (0.1095 nm for Tb3+vs. 0.1075 nm for Y3+).35

Fig. 2(a) shows the representative TEM image of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ sample. The results for other doping concentrations of Yb3+ in the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 10) and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10) samples are similar to result of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and will not be shown here. From Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that the obtained nanoparticles are roughly spherical and monodisperse. Fig. 2(b) shows the statistics of diameter distribution of the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles. The nanoparticles size distribution is narrow. And the mean diameter of the nanoparticles is 2.6 nm (the total particles reach to 100), which is approximately consistent with the result of XRD. In the illustration of Fig. 2(b), the HRTEM image of nanoparticles clearly reveals the well-resolved diffraction fringes of the lattices, indicating that nanoparticles are highly crystalline. The lattice fringes with 0.198 nm spacing are clearly visible and in accordance with the lattice spacing of (2 2 0) of NaYF4 crystal.

FTIR, UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflection
To demonstrate that the H4L molecules had been bonded onto the nanoparticles, the FTIR, UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflection spectra were measured.
The representative FTIR spectra of the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , the broad band at 3447 cm−1 characterizing mode is appreciable for the O–H (COO–H) stretching vibration. The bands at 1592 and 1403 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretching vibration of the carboxyl group in the citric acid molecule, respectively.36 In the FTIR spectra of the L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+, the absorption bands around 3227 cm−1 and 3041 cm−1 are caused by the νO–H (hydrogen bond inside molecule) vibration peak and the C–H stretching vibration of H4L, respectively.37 Moreover, the spectra show two peaks at 1543 cm−1 and 1439 cm−1, corresponding to the asymmetric (νascoo−) and symmetric stretching vibration (νscoo−) of carboxyl, respectively.37 The absorption peaks at 570–910 cm−1 are assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibrations of benzene rings. At the same time, the νCO stretching vibration at 1660–1770 cm−1 still exist, implying that the carboxyls for H4L have partial coordination with RE3+ by acid radicals.

The representative UV-vis absorption spectra of H4L, L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ are drawn in Fig. 4. For H4L, three absorption bands located around 214, 249 and 294 nm are observed, corresponding to the π–π* transition absorption of the H4L. Similarly, the absorption bands at about 216, 255 and 295 nm were observed for the L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles, respectively. The slight red-shifts of three bands in L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles can be attributed to the increasing conjugation after the H4L are bonded to the surface of the nanoparticles in contrast to the H4L.33 The UV-vis absorption spectra of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10) samples also are measured, and no absorption transition is observed. These results demonstrate that H4L is actually bonded to the surface of the nanoparticles.

The diffuse reflection spectra of different samples are recorded at room temperature. The representative diffuse reflection spectra of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ are drawn in Fig. 5. For the diffuse reflectance spectra of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+, the absorption edge is clearly observed in UV region, which is attributed to the parity allowed transition 4f8 → 4f75d of Tb3+ ions. The absorption bands between 900 and 1050 nm are corresponding to the 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ions. In the diffuse reflectance spectra of L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+, there are three absorption bands between 200 and 400 nm, which are attributed to the π–π* transition absorption of the H4L in the UV region, and absorption bands between 900 and 1050 nm corresponding to the 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ in near-infrared region. The parity forbidden f–f transition of Tb3+ ions cannot be observed because of lower component of Tb3+ ions (1 mol%) in UV-vis region for the diffuse reflection spectra of all samples.

Photoluminescence properties
At room temperature the NIR photoluminescence spectra of the different samples are detected, and the representative ones for NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 6(a) . In the excitation spectra of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ sample by monitoring 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ at 979 nm, a band centered at 270 nm assigned to the characteristic 4f8–4f75d transition of Tb3+ is observed.38 Upon the excitation of 270 nm, an emission peak located at 979 nm and several weak shoulders owing to transitions among different Stark levels of 2FJ (J = 5/2, 7/2) of Yb3+ ions are observed. This resulted from the cooperative energy transition between Tb3+ ions with Yb3+ ions through downconversion quantum cutting.12,13 It is worthy to note that a strong and broad band from 230 nm to 530 nm is observed by monitoring 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ at 977 nm in the excitation spectra of L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ sample, which are attributed to the π–π* transition absorption of the H4L. Upon the excitation of π–π* transition of the H4L, an intense emission peak located at 977 nm and several weak shoulders owing to transitions among different Stark levels of 2FJ (J = 5/2, 7/2) of Yb3+ ions are observed.

To investigate the pathway of energy transfer in hybrid nanoparticles, the photoluminescence spectra of the different samples in UV-vis region were detected at room temperature. The representative excitation and emission spectra of NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ are shown in Fig. 6(b). The excitation spectra were obtained by monitoring the emission of the 5D4–7F5 transition of Tb3+ ions at 545 nm (left of Fig. 6(b)).
For the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles, the excitation spectra are composed of the characteristic 4f8–4f75d transitions of the Tb3+ configuration and forbidden f–f transitions of within the Tb3+ 4f8 configuration. The two bands at 213 and 255 nm are associated with the lowest low-spin and high-spin 4fn−1–5d transitions of Tb3+ ions.39 The excitation bands in the longer wavelength region (280–400 nm) can be assigned as the transitions from the 7F6 ground state to the different excited states of Tb3+ within the Tb3+ 4f8 configuration, that is, 284 nm (5I6), 303 nm (5H6), 319 nm (5D0), 340 nm (5G2), 352 nm (5D2), 369 nm (5G6), and 378 nm (5D3), respectively.40 For the excitation spectra of L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles, it can be seen clearly that the excitation spectra present an intense, broad band from 200 to 355 nm (see the left solid line of Fig. 6(b)), which proves that the Tb3+ in NaYF4 nanoparticles is excited via the antenna of H4L. Upon excitation at 272 nm for the L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ nanoparticles, the characteristic green emission bands of Tb3+ ions are observed (see the right solid line of Fig. 6(b)), corresponding to the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 4–6) transitions. The strongest emission is centered at around 545 nm due to the 5D4 → 7F5 transition. These results demonstrate that the excitation energy is first transferred from H4L to Tb3+ ions. So, the energy transition pathway in the hybrid systems consists of an initial strong absorption of ultraviolet energy that excites H4L to the excited singlet (S1) state, followed by an energy migration via intersystem crossing from the S1 state to triplet (T) state of H4L. The energy is then nonradiatively transferred from the lowest triplet state of H4L to a resonance state (5D4) of coordinated Tb3+ ions. By cooperative energy transition through downconversion quantum cutting, the Tb3+ ions then transfer the energy to the Yb3+ ions, which in turn undergo a multiphoton relaxation and subsequent emission in the near infrared region. The schematic diagram of molecular structure of H4L and the energy transfer in hybrid nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  The schematic diagram of molecular structure of H4L and the energy transfer in hybrid nanoparticles. 
The fluorescence decay curves for the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+ ions at 545 nm in different samples were measured at room temperature. Fig. 8 shows the representative fluorescence decay curves for the 5D4–7F5 transitions of Tb3+ ions in the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ and L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, 5 mol%Yb3+ samples, respectively. It can be seen that the fluorescence decays non-exponentially, which imply that the energy transfer between Tb3+ ions and Yb3+ ions occurs. All of the decay curves can be well fitted by a function as I = I1 exp (−τ1/t) + I2 exp (−τ2/t), where τ1 and τ2 are the decay time constants, respectively. I1 and I2 present the ratios of the decay time components, respectively. The detailed luminescence lifetimes of Tb3+ ions in different samples are listed in Table 1. The results show that the lifetime of different samples decreases rapidly with increasing the concentration of Yb3+, implying the occurrence of energy transfer from Tb3+ ions to Yb3+ ions. The lifetime of the L-NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10) become longer than that of the NaYF4:1 mol%Tb3+, x mol%Yb3+ (x = 1, 3, 5, 10), which can be attributed to the influence of the surrounding media (H4L). The radiative lifetime can be written as  (1) where f(ED) is the oscillator strength for the electronic dipole transition, λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the material. R. S. Meltzer et al.41 observe that the radiative fluorescence lifetime of Y2O3:Eu3+ nanocrystals is dependent not only on the refractive index, but also on the surrounding medium. They deduced that in nanoparticles, n in eqn (1) should be substituted by the effective refractive index neff (x) = x n + (1 − (x) nmed, where x is the filling factor showing what fraction of the space is occupied by the nanoparticles, and nmed is the refractive index of the surrounding media. In the present case, the Tb3+ ions are surrounded by NaYF4 crystal in the L-NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+. The refractive index values are 1.55 for NaYF442 in L-NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ and 1.71 for H4L in lanthanide complexes of H4L. The decreased refractive index of the Tb3+ ions surrounding media will lead neff to be smaller than the refractive index of the complex n which would induce the increase of radiative lifetime. It is important to note that the τ1 for the L-NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ samples are longer than that τ1 for NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ samples. The cause is that the Tb3+ in the nanomaterials locates in different environments. Owing to the large surface to volume ratio of nanomaterials, Tb3+ in the nanoparticles locates two different environments in general, i.e. at the core of the particles and at or near the surface of particles, respectively. The τ1 can be attributed to the luminescence decay from Tb3+ located at or near the surface of the nanomaterials. The shield from the quenching effect of water and “antenna effect” of H4L over the surface of nanoparticles make the lifetime of Tb3+ located at or near the surface of the nanomaterials become longer.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized ultra-small-sized NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles and hybrid L-NaYF4:Tb3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles. Their DC QC PL properties have been studied contrastively at room temperature. Combining the antenna and shield effect provided by organic H4L with the protection of inorganic matrices NaYF4, the hybrid nanoparticles display a broad absorption in the UV-vis domain, strong NIR emission at about 1000 nm that matches to the energy of Si band gap of Si-based solar cells, and longer lifetimes as a result of energy transfer from the organic H4L to Tb3+ ions and then to Yb3+ ions. The results will provide a new path for developing organic–inorganic hybrid luminescent materials as spectral converters to improve the efficiency of Si solar cells.
