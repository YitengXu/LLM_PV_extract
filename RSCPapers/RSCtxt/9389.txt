    , Accepted 28th January 2019First published on 29th January 2019AbstractNature acts as a “Bio-Laboratory”, consisting of plants, algae, fungi, yeast, etc., which are composed of bio-molecules. These naturally occurring bio-molecules play a vital role in the synthesis of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles (NPs) and their nanocomposites (NCs), with distinct shapes and sizes, thereby acting as a driving force for designing safer, greener and sustainable routes using less hazardous chemicals. The present review focuses on the eco-friendly protocols for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs, techniques used for their characterisation and their various applications in organic catalysis, biosensing, environmental remediation and medicinal chemistry. The pivotal role of Cu2O NPs and their NCs in catalysing coupling (C–C and C–N), multicomponent, oxidation–reduction and heterocyclic reactions is highlighted. This emphasises their role in environmental sustainability and versatility in heterogenous catalysis.

Introduction
In the recent past, metal and metal oxide nanomaterials1,2 have received increasing attention and various synthetic routes demonstrated for their synthesis. The wide efficiency and versatility of these nano materials have further promoted their design and initiated the tailoring of suitable sizes and morphologies of metal and metal oxide NPs. The synthesis of nanoscale transition metal oxides3 such as tin oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, and copper oxide is of significant interest owing to their enhanced catalytic activity, high thermal conductivity, excellent antibacterial/antimicrobial activity, availability of economical and scalable synthetic routes, and non-toxicity. Among the various transition metal oxides, the production of Cu2O NPs and their NCs is of special interest in the scientific and industrial fields due to their various applications such as gas-sensing,4 solar cells,5 antibacterial agents,6 catalysis,7 and antifouling coatings.8 Recently, antifouling paints have been formulated with Cu2O NPs together with other chemicals to act as biocides,9 which are meant to impede the growth of algae and other marine organisms. The distinct properties of Cu2O NPs have been greatly harnessed for environmental remediation. Cu2O is also a p-type semiconductor with a small band gap of about 2 eV, which makes it an important material in electronics, magnetic storage, catalysis and solar energy conversion10 (shown in Fig. 1). Normally, Cu2O NPs and their NCs are obtained either via the oxidation of pure copper (thermal oxidation) or reduction of Cu2+. In the literature, there are several reports using different methods for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs such as electrochemical deposition,11 microwave synthesis,12 solvothermal methods,13 liquid phase synthesis,14–18 seed-mediated synthesis19 and microemulsions.20 All these were used to obtain Cu2O NPs with different sizes and morphologies and in certain methods even control these parameters. Among the methods, liquid phase synthesis should be highlighted due to its simplicity, no requirement of expensive lab gear and handling of hazard reagents, low cost and short reaction time. In this method, the synthesis generally starts with the addition of sodium hydroxide to a copper salt (e.g. copper chloride, copper acetate, copper nitrate, and copper sulphate),21 and then a reducing agent is added to obtain Cu2O NPs. Also, a surfactant can be added to control the particle size (e.g. Triton X-100).22–25 The major limitation of chemical methods for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs is the use of harsh and expensive chemicals, which damage the environment and are not bio-compatible.
 Fig. 1  Flow chart showing the applications of Cu2O NPs and their NCs. 
The nano-version of Cu2O has further enhanced its interest from the scientific world and motivates researchers to develop newer routes for its synthesis together with safeguarding the environment using the least amount of harsh chemicals. In an era where every scientific activity directly or indirectly causes a great threat to the environment, the reproducible, facile, effortless, eco-friendly biological synthesis of stable and efficient Cu2O NPs and their NCs has recently envisaged a surge in designing green protocols using both biological extracts and biological wastes (waste to wealth approach) to synthesize a wide range of NPs. Extracts from plant leaves, roots, latex, seeds and stems have also been used for the synthesis of NPs since they act as both stabilizing/capping agents and reducing agents. All biological extracts contain organic compounds such as polyphenols, carbohydrates, and flavones, which act as reducing agents and stabilizing agents.
The main objective of this review is to present the various biogenic methods for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs and highlight the methods used for their characterization, vital applications in catalysis, bio-sensing, environment remediation and medicinal applications. In catalysis, the main focus is coupling (C–C and C–N), multicomponent, oxidation–reduction and heterocyclic reactions. The current findings entail the literature of the applications of Cu2O NPs and their NCs between 2006 and 2018. This is an important review showcasing green methods for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their applications, emphasising their role in organic catalysis and environmental sustainability, which will surely have significance due to the limited number of steps involved and utilization of natural extracts, making them highly cost effective in nature. The green methods for the synthesis of NPs and NCs together with their applications can be certainly mimicked at the bulk level to ensure major gains and productivity of the current research.
Biogenic synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs
Biogenic synthesis involves a very simple procedure. Several plants have been reported in the literature for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs (Tables 1 and 2). The synthesis of NPs is entirely dependent on the chemicals present in the precursor such as saponins, polyphenols, terpenoids, and carbohydrates.26–32 It was observed that the kinetic and thermodynamic modes for the growth of Cu2O NPs can be tailored through slight variations in experimental parameters, such as temperature, concentration and nature of the substrate/additive (ligand, polymer, surfactant, and ion), pH and reaction time.26–32 In all the protocols, the plant parts are collected from different sources, and thoroughly washed with tap and distilled water to remove unwanted materials. The parts are either dried or ground to form a powder and boiled in different solvents (water, ethanol, etc.) or used directly to obtain plant extract (PE). Mostly all extractions are carried out in aqueous medium since all the active ingredients are water soluble (concept of like dissolves like is applied). Different concentration of copper salts as metal precursor and PE can be used for the synthesis of NPs. Generally PE is mixed with copper salt solution and the bio chemicals present in the PE act as a reducing agent (bioreduction) for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs and their NCs and as a stabilizing agent (capping), particularly in the case of Cu2O NPs (as shown in Fig. 2). NPs/NCs are obtained via centrifugation at high speed and can be monitored by visual observation or using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer.

However, not all the PE obtained by various methods have the same active ingredients. Sometimes purification of the active ingredients involves several cumbersome steps33 and also the reducing agent may sometimes be required from an outside source.26
As mentioned in Table 1, Calotropis gigantea (arka) leaf extract was also used to study the synthesis of Cu2O NPs with a size of 8 nm and variable shapes (Fig. 3). Here, the saponins present in the arka leaf act as a bio-surfactant, and the red-shift in the vibrational band (Cu–O stretching) of Cu2O from 637 cm−1 to 640 cm−1 in the presence of a bio-surfactant suggests an interfacial interaction between the NPs and O-atoms of the –OH groups of saponin present in the PE.26 In the literature, Cu2O NPs were synthesized using the leaf extract of Syzygium jambos (L.), containing vitamin C and many polyphenols. The Cu2O NPs synthesised from this method showed effective catalytic activity for the ipso-hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols. The biogenic Cu2O NPs were directly utilised in water for the ipso-hydroxylation of arylboronic acids with various substituents with excellent yields. The catalyst worked without using H2O2, base, ligand and molecular oxygen, and could be recycled several times without significant loss in activity.27 The synthesis of nanoneedle-shaped Cu2O NPs using Arachis hypogaea leaf extract with Benedict's solution as the precursor was described by Ramesh et al. The synthesized NPs showed a sharp absorption band at 259 nm in their UV-Visible spectrum.28 Hexagonal and cubic-shaped Cu2O NPs using Tridax procumbens leaf extract with Fehling's solution as the precursor were described by K. Gopalakrishnan et al. The synthesised NPs were examined for their antibacterial activities against E. coli as model Gram-negative bacteria and it was concluded that these biosynthesized NPs could replace some antibiotic medicines used to combat pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of animals.34

Camellia sinensis leaf extract was also used as a reducing and stabilising agent to form Cu2O NPs. The truncated cubes and spherical NPs were examined for their antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and B. cereus bacteria.35Phoenix dactylifera (date fruit) pulp extract was also used as a reducing agent for the formation of Cu2O NPs in aqueous medium. The synthesized irregular-shaped NPs were found extremely useful for the effective uptake of As(III) ions from polluted water29 (as shown in Fig. 4). Irregular-shaped Cu2O NPs with sizes ranging from 5–20 nm were synthesized at room temperature using the fruit extract of pomegranate, Punica Granatum L.36 Shiyun Ai et al. used lignin (paper-making waste liquid) to obtain Cu2O NPs (shown in Fig. 5).

 Fig. 5  Synthesis of Cu2O NPs from lignin (paper-making waste material.36 
Lignin acted as a reducing and capping agent for the formation of Cu2O NPs in aqueous medium. The sterilisation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and E. coli using Cu2O NPs was also investigated. The Cu2O NPs showed effective bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. Aureus.33 B. Chetia and co-workers developed a green and facile novel procedure for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs within a very short reaction time using banana pulp extract as a reducing agent.37
Characterisation of Cu2O NPs
For confirmation of the formation of Cu2O NPs, different instruments and techniques are used to characterise Cu2O NPs (shown in Fig. 6). Cu2O NPs can exist in solid or suspended liquid phase.
 Fig. 6  Flow chart showing the characterisation of Cu2O NPs.a Images were reproduced with permission and aHRXRD of Cu2O NPs by us. 
Size
The size of NPs is generally described as the diameter of spherical particles in the solid phase. There are different methods (electron microscopy, laser diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction) to measure the particles size of NPs, but TEM is most widely used. In the liquid phase, the size of NPs can be determined using dynamic light scattering.38
Crystallography
Powder X-ray diffraction may be used to determine the crystal structures of NPs. The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 29.58, 36.5, 42.36, 61.64 and 73.62 correspond to the (110), (111), (200), (220) and (311), respectively, which clearly show the presence of pure crystalline Cu2O. The strong and sharp peaks of the prepared Cu2O NPs indicate the high crystallinity of the NPs.
Morphology
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)38 and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)39 are used to determine the morphology of NPs.
Zeta potential
The zeta potential of NPs dispersed in liquid is determined by using different electrophoretic techniques.26
Templates for the synthesis of Cu2O NCs
NPs can be stabilised or functionalised using templates to impart useful properties by controlling their size, morphology and protecting their surfaces, thereby preventing aggregation. Many commercial templates have been reported as functionalising agents for altering the shape, size and properties of NCs but these are difficult to remove and do not easily degrade. Thus, commercial templates are hazardous to the environment. The preparation of homogenous NCs using bio-molecules such as polysaccharides has recently gained interest due to their non-toxic nature and no harsh synthetic procedures. Polysaccharides have emerged as a renewable green alternative template for the fabrication of NCs.26,37 Polysaccharides are a class of polymeric carbohydrate molecules with repeating units of mono or disaccharides linked together by glycosidic linkages. They act as capping agents in the synthesis of NPs and as templates for the fabrication of NCs since they are low cost, hydrophilic, stable, safe, biodegradable and non-toxic. The synthesis is carried out in the presence of water as a solvent; thus, eliminating the use of toxic solvents. Carbohydrates, which have aldehyde groups, play a reducing and controlling role during the formation of Cu2O NPs in solution.34
Eco-friendly routes for the synthesis of Cu2O NCs have been gaining significance in the field of nanotechnology due to their low toxicity, economic validity, single-step procedure and environmental sustainability. The biogenic synthesis of Cu2O NCs is shown in Table 2. Brown algae (Bifurcaria bifurcata) extract was used to study the synthesis of Cu2O and CuO NPs with a size in the range of 5–45 nm with a spherical shape. The synthesized NPs were examined for their antibacterial activities against both E. aerogenes and S. aureus bacteria using the disc diffusion test.40
Cu@Cu2O NCs were synthesized in aqueous solution in the presence of Kappaphycus alvarezii (K. alvarezii) stabilizer and CuSO4·5H2O precursor via a chemical reduction method. The UV-Visible spectrum displayed two peaks at 590 nm and 390 nm, which confirmed the formation of Cu@Cu2O NCs. The average size of the obtained Cu@Cu2O NCs was around 53 nm.41 M. Z. Ansari et al. utilized honey extract to obtain Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs. The oxidized products of honey, i.e. reduced sugar, could also act as a capping agent and stabilizer for the synthesis of Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs, which showed good stability as a heterogeneous catalyst. The Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs were found to be 15 nm in size. Besides, the synthesized Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs showed superior catalytic activity for the synthesis of functionalized Schiff base derivatives.42 The synthesis of spherical Cu2O/RGO NCs using Mangifera indica bark extract with a size in the range of 5–10 nm was described by Tapas Kuila et al. The synthesized Cu2O/RGO NCs were prepared via simple solution mixing. The various phytochemicals such as flavones, terpenoids, aldehydes, ketones, amides, carboxylic acids, quinines, flavones and organic acids present in the bark extract assisted the reduction of Gr to RGO and Cu(CH3COOH)2 to Cu2O. The RGO/Cu2O NCs functioned as an electrochemical sensor for the detection of H2O2.30Punica granatum L. peel extract was used as a capping agent to render nano-oxides soluble and stable. The synthesized spherical shaped Cu/Cu2O/CuO/ZnO NCs with a size of 29 nm exhibited a large surface area and high electrocatalytic behaviour and accessibility for ion diffusion as a potential electrochemical transducer and catalyst31 (as shown in Fig. 7). Pomegranate marc peel (PMP) extract was also used as a reducing and stabilising agent to form Cu–Cu2O NCs. The degradation of toxic organic dyes in wastewater is a major issue, which has been the focus of chemists in the last few years. It is very difficult to remove dyes by natural processes due to their chemical and biological stabilities. The NCs synthesized using pomegranate marc peel (PMP) extract showed good catalytic activities for the degradation of methylene blue.43Manihot esculenta leaf extract was used as a reducing agent to form Cu2O/PVA NCs. Specifically, the reducing sugar extracted from the Manihot esculenta leaf acted as the reducing agent. From the morphological studies, it was noticed that cubic and hexagonal Cu2O particles were dispersed in the PVA matrix.32

Applications of Cu2O NPs and their NCs
Cu2O NPs and their NCs may have different applications depending on their various properties, which are highly influenced by their size, surface properties, optical and magnetic traits, with the synthesis method being important for controlling all these parameters, and thus, their biological properties. Some of these applications include doping materials in semiconductors, catalysts for different reactions, biosensors, remedial action, and antibacterial. We describe their advantageous applications in different subheads to emphasize the remarkable results as a guidance to new researchers for future prospects.
Catalytic applications

Coupling reactions. 
A coupling reaction in organic chemistry is the general term for a variety of reactions, where two hydrocarbon fragments are coupled with the aid of a metal catalyst. The most common catalyst is palladium, but an increasing number of reactions use nickel. Other catalysts include copper, platinum, iron and cobalt.44


C–C coupling reaction. 
Carbon–carbon coupling reactions are among the most useful and most widely studied synthetic transformations, in which two hydrocarbon fragments are coupled using a metal catalyst. In a coupling reaction having a common intermediate, the energy required is transformed from one side of the reaction to the other.45,46


Synthesis of amides by amidation of aryl halides with isocyanides using Cu2O NPs as a catalyst. 
Sarkar and Sen group developed an environmentally benign chemical process for the C–C coupling of aryl halides with isocyanides in aqueous media using Cu2O NPs as a reusable catalyst in the absence of additional stabilizing ligands or additives and organic solvents. Amides were obtained in good yields (74–88%) for a variety of aryl or aliphatic isocyanides and aryl halides (Scheme 1).47The scope and generality of the method were investigated using equimolar aryl or aliphatic isocyanides (2) and aryl halides (1) to give the desired product (3). It was found that the morphology of the catalyst remained unchanged even after three uses.

Sonogashira coupling reactions of aryl iodides with phenylacetylene catalysed by Cu2O@Cu NPs. 
Varma and co-workers tested the core/shell nanomaterial Cu2O@Cu for the Sonogashira coupling reaction.48 The Cu2O@Cu NPs exhibited the ability to catalyse the coupling reaction of aryl iodides (4) and phenylacetylene (5) to yield the corresponding diarylalkynes (6) in excellent yields (85–94%) in the absence of ligand or noble metal (Pd) (Scheme 2). When only Cu2O or Cu NPs were used, no target products were obtained. Thus, Cu2O@Cu NPs were used to promote the Sonogashira coupling reaction instead of the expensive Pd and other noble-metal catalysts. The Cu2O@Cu NCs recovered after the reaction retained their structure, and thus were stable. The catalyst could be recycled, and thus was compatible with the cost-effective and environmentally benign synthesis principle. The Sonogashira coupling reactions for the synthesis of ynones have garnered interest due to their potential for the development of valuable organic compounds/intermediates.49–51 Accordingly, the replacement of conventional Pd-based catalytic systems with earth-abundant metal-based catalysts still remains an area of active research.

RGO-supported Cu2O NPs as an efficient catalyst for the Sonogashira coupling reaction. 
RGO-supported Cu2O NPs were prepared via a liquid-phase reduction method and employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction by B. Wang.52 The catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity towards the reaction of aryl halides (4) with phenylacetylene (5) under palladium-free and ligand-free conditions (Scheme 2). The catalyst also showed high stability with only a slight decrease in activity after five cycles.


Sonogashira coupling reaction between acyl chlorides and terminal alkynes using Cu/Cu2O as a nanocatalyst. 
The catalytic applicability of Cu/Cu2O NPs for the Sonogashira coupling reaction of alkynes (7) and acyl chlorides (8) was tested to yield product (9) by B. M. Bhanage and co-workers. For various alkynes and acyl chlorides, the Cu/Cu2O NPs provided good to excellent yields (63–99%) (Scheme 3) of the respective products under the optimized reaction conditions. The reaction conditions involved phenylacetylene (1 mmol), benzoyl chloride (1.2 mmol), nano-Cu/Cu2O (10 mol%), and Et3N (2 mmol) in toluene (2 mL) at 90 °C for 24 h under an N2 atmosphere. With these optimized reaction conditions, the scope of the developed protocol was extended for the synthesis using various alkyne and acyl chloride derivatives.53

Ag@Cu2O core–shell NPs: active photocatalyst for Suzuki and Suzuki-type coupling reactions. 
V. Bhalla and co-workers developed a rapid and facile route for the preparation of Ag@Cu2O core–shell NPs in aqueous media, where aggregates of the pentacenequinone derivative acted as reactors and stabilizers. Pentacenequinone (10, 13) with phenyl boronic acid (11) in the presence of Ag@Cu2O NCs gave the pentacenequinone-based derivatives (12, 14) in good yields (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of pentacenequinone-based derivatives.54 
The in situ generated Ag@Cu2O core–shell hybrid materials enabled efficient visible light harvesting to catalyse the palladium-free Suzuki–Miyaura and Suzuki-type cross coupling reactions at room temperature. These studies suggest that photogenerated electron–hole pairs are essential for the Suzuki coupling reactions. Upon light irradiation, charge separation in the form of electron–hole pairs is generated within the Ag@Cu2O NCs to give higher yields for the active substrates such as iodobenzene, bromobenzene and aryl halides having electron rich substituents. The use of protic solvents was advantageous in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Ag@Cu2O NCs.54
V. Bhalla et al. synthesised Ag@Cu2O core–shell NCs and utilised these NCs in the Suzuki coupling reaction. The reaction of 1-bromobenzene (15) with phenyl boronic acid (16) in mixed aqueous solution was chosen as a model reaction to investigate the recyclability of the Ag@Cu2O NCs catalyst (Scheme 5) to give the product (17).
 Scheme 5  Ag@Cu2O NC photocatalyst for Suzuki and Suzuki-type coupling reactions.54 
The Ag@Cu2O core–shell NPs could be re-used as a catalyst for the reaction at least three times without any significant loss in activity. Derivatives having phenylethylamine motifs are important due to their extensive use in the synthesis of drug targets for the treatment of various diseases.55 Traditionally, the synthesis of these compounds via the ring opening reaction of aziridines requires strong organometallic nucleophiles.56 The photocatalytic activity of Ag@Cu2O NPs in the ring opening reactions of N-tosylaziridine (18) with organoboron (19) to obtain phenylethylamine were examined. Encouraged by the excellent photocatalytic efficiency, the Suzuki-type coupling reaction of aziridine and organoboron was carried out in the presence of in situ generated Ag@Cu2O NPs using K2CO3 as the base in H2O/EtOH to furnish the desired product (20) in 93% yield (Scheme 6).57
 Scheme 6  Photocatalytic Suzuki-type cross coupling reaction.57 


C–N coupling reactions. 
Carbon–nitrogen coupling reactions are among the most useful and most widely studied synthetic transformations, in which carbon and electronegative nitrogen fragments are coupled with the aid of a metal catalyst. Various noble- and transition-metal catalysts have been developed and employed for these reactions. Cu2O-based NPs in particular have emerged as reliable and cost-effective catalysts for many reported catalytic protocols, and it has been shown that their use can increase the sustainability of these processes.58


Cu2O NP-catalysed amination of aryl halides with aliphatic amines. 
Cu2O NPs catalysed the reaction of aryl halides with aliphatic amines to yield their amino derivatives under mild conditions in the absence of ligand (Scheme 7).59 The amination of iodobenzene (21) with a variety of primary aliphatic amines (22) with a low catalyst loading (5 mol%) proceeded with good to excellent conversions (10–93%) to yield the product (23). The reaction of cyclic amines such as piperidine proceeded with satisfactory yields to obtain the targeted aminated products, but aryl bromides and aryl chlorides were sluggish in the reaction, whereas electron-rich aryl iodides were excellent substrates. Secondary aliphatic amines did not readily undergo acceptable conversions of the desired aniline. However, the reaction of aryl iodide consisting of electron withdrawing substituents was not reported in this study.

Amidation of aryl halides catalysed by the efficient and recyclable Cu2O NPs. 
Using inexpensive and recyclable Cu2O NPs as a catalyst, Xianwen and co-workers developed a novel and efficient method for C—N cross coupling reactions of substituted aryl halides (1) with aromatic/aliphatic amides (24) under mild conditions to give product (25) in excellent yields (67%–86%) (Scheme 8).60 The low cost, excellent selectivity and environmental benignity, together with excellent yields of this method make it especially attractive for industrial applications.

Ligand-free Cu2O NPs catalysed amination of aryl halides in ionic liquids (IL). 
Amination reactions of iodobenzene (4) and its derivatives with aqueous ammonia (26) solution to give aniline (27) are the most common and most desirable reactions in chemical synthesis. H. G. Prechtl et al. developed a simple and feasible methodology for a C–N coupling reaction using nanoscale Cu2O catalysts incorporated in n-Bu4POAc IL (Scheme 9). A wide variety of amines and aryl halides could be coupled selectively in high yields in the absence of ligands or additives (bases) without precautions against water or air.61

Cycloaddition reaction via click chemistry. 
Click chemistry is an approach to develop a set of powerful, selective, and modular building blocks such as azide and alkyne, which work for both small and large scale synthesis.62 Synthetic methodologies facilitating the rapid construction of molecules have attracted the attention of many synthetic chemists. Among them, the 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction, also known as Huisgen cycloaddition, between an azide and terminal alkynes giving rise to 1,2,3-trizole species is of particular interest. This reaction has far reaching applications since both alkyne and azide moieties are major components in many compounds used in the synthesis of medicinal compounds and can also be tagged into a wide range of substituents. The copper(I) catalysed version of this reaction gives only the 4-isomer and is a classic click reaction, which is catalysed at room temperature in 15 minutes to give 91% yield. Copper-catalysed click reactions work essentially on terminal alkynes, where compounds undergo metal insertion into the terminal alkynes.


Cu@Cu2O azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction. 
Ponti et al. determined the morphology and the surface and total composition of mixed Cu/Cu-oxide NPs and their dependence on exposure to air.63 The NPs surface was mostly composed of both Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxide. The authors applied these NPs in the azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction as the catalyst (Scheme 10). A number of alkynes were used with aryl azides bearing substituents with very different electronic demands. The reaction was carried out using an equimolar amount of azide (28) and terminal alkyne (7), Cu@Cu2O catalyst and toluene as the base at room temperature to give the product (29) in excellent yield.

Cu2O-catalysed azide–alkyne click reaction in water. 
D. Kong et al. determined the general procedure for the Cu2O NP-catalysed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of azides and terminal alkynes (Scheme 11).64 In a typical experiment, an equimolar solution of azide (30), alkyne (31) and Cu2O NPs dispersion in water (20 mL) was stirred at 37 °C for 24 hours to achieve the desired product (32). The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad to remove the Cu2O NPs catalyst. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the products were generally of sufficient purity.

Catalytic activity of Cu@Cu2O core–shell nanocatalyst in azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. 
Huisgen azide–alkyne cycloaddition is a representative reaction of click chemistry, especially under copper catalysis. It produces 1,2,3-triazoles as the product, which can be applied in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals and biological materials.65–70 K. H. Park and co-workers evaluated the catalytic activity of Cu@Cu2O core–shell NCs (Scheme 12)71 in the Huisgen cycloaddition of benzyl azide (33) to phenylacetylene (7) at 50 °C for 5 h, which lead to complete conversion to the 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles as the desired products (34). The prepared Cu@Cu2O core–shell NCs provided the desired triazole with satisfactory conversion under similar mild reaction conditions.72–75

Multicomponent reactions (MCRs). 
MCRs are a synthetic methodology also referred to as a multi-component assembly process, in which three or more starting materials react to form a single component in a single reaction vessel to form a new product, which contains portions of all the components. A multitude of MCRs exist, e.g. isocyanide MCRs,76 free-radical mediated MCRs,77 MCRs based on organoboron compounds and metal-catalysed MCRs.78 Among them, the isocyanide MCRs methodologies have applications in most stages of the drug discovery process. Here, we discuss the different MCRs catalysed by Cu(I) NPs and NCs.

Synthesis of propargylamines

Cu2O–ZnO NCs catalysed propargylamines synthesis. 
H. Sarvari et al. efficiently developed the three-component coupling of aldehydes (35) or ketones (36), terminal alkynes (38), and amines (37) to synthesize propargylamines (39) via C–H activation using Cu2O–ZnO NCs as a catalyst. Cu2O–ZnO showed the best catalytic activity at 100 °C in the absence of any additives or base under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 13).79 Aromatic, aliphatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes were efficiently converted into the corresponding propargylamines to achieve excellent yields. The reactivity of aryl aldehydes with electron-rich groups was faster, while substitution of electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring decreased the reactivity and required longer time for the completion of the reaction. However, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde did not give the product even after a long reaction time. To extend the scope of the reaction, various cyclic and acyclic secondary amines such as piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, dibutylamine, and 2,2-(azanediylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(isoindoline-1,3-dione) were used, which gave good results. The best achievement is that this reaction was also applicable for aliphatic ketones, including cyclic ketones, but aromatic ketone, such as acetophenone and benzophenone, did not give the desired products.82 In the case of acyclic ketones, such as acetone, only a trace of the desired product was obtained after a long time period. Finally, the catalyst was easily recycled.

Cu2O@ hydrothermal carbon (HTC)-catalysed propargylamine synthesis. 
G. D. Yadav et al. synthesized Cu2O NP-supported HTC microspheres as a catalyst for the synthesis of propargylamines (Scheme 14).80 In a typical experiment, the reactor was charged with benzaldehyde (40) (2 mmol), phenylacetylene (41) (2.2 mmol), piperidine (42) (2.2 mmol), 0.2 mL internal standard (n-dodecane), methylene dichloride as the solvent and catalyst (0.0015 g cm−3) with the total reaction volume of 20 mL. The reaction mixture was stirred (500 rpm) at the reaction temperature (60 °C) for 5 h to achieve the product (43). The effect of various parameters was studied including solvent, catalyst loading, mole ratio and temperature of the reaction to achieve the best yield at 60 °C and 1.5 × 10−3 g cm−3 catalyst loading.
 Scheme 14  Cu2O@HTC80 or Cu2O-CD81 catalysed propargylamine synthesis. 


Cu2O-cyclodextrin (CD)-catalysed propargylamine synthesis. 
The unprecedented concomitant formation of Cu2O–CD nano-superstructures during the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and their catalytic use in the propargylamination reaction was developed by A. V. Kumar et al. A mixture of benzaldehyde (40) (1 mmol), piperidine (42) (1.2 mmol), phenylacetylene (41) (1.5 mmol), and Cu2O–CD (50 mg) was stirred in a round bottom flask at 100 °C for 1 h to obtain the pure product (43) in good yield (Scheme 14).81 The formed NPs were also recyclable for up to three cycles with no loss in catalytic activity.


Substituted pyrroles synthesis. 
The catalytic application of Cu2O/Ag NPs for the synthesis of substituted pyrroles MCRs using an aldehyde (44), amine (45), 1,3-diketone (46) and nitromethane (47) at room temperature was studied by B. M. Bhanage et al. (Scheme 15).82 The catalytic system provided good yields of products (48) for a wide range of substrates. Also, the catalyst showed excellent catalytic recyclability without much loss in activity.

Miscellaneous reactions

Synthesis of carbonyl dibenzofurans. 
Numerous biologically active compounds83 commonly consist dibenzofurane, which possesses a wide range of activities. The single-step synthesis of carbonyl dibenzofuranes enroute to decarboxylative C–H arylation involving both chemioselective and regioselective synthesis was reported by Sarkar, Sen et al., in which high chemio- and regioselectivity were maintained in the subsequent carbonylative C–C coupling of aryl halides (49) with isocyanide (2) or alcohol (50) using Cu2O NPs under aerobic conditions/parameters (Scheme 16).84
 Scheme 16  Cu2O NP-catalysed decarboxylative C–H arylation and carboxylation for the synthesis of carbonyl dibenzofurans.84 
The intermolecular and intramolecular C–C cross coupling by freezing C-1 and C–H atoms was enabled by the incorporation of 2-(3-iodophenoxy) benzoic acid. A plausible reaction pathway was reported, as shown in Scheme 17. The intramolecular C–C coupling via (52) gave rise to intermediate (53), which was conveniently transformed into intermediate (54) with the liberation of iodide and formation of the Cu(III)–O linkage in basic medium. The p-electrons of linear isocyanides coordinated with Cu(III) to form the cyclic intermediate (54) and the insertion of isocyanides led to intermediate (55), which eventually formed (56) upon decarboxylation. Further, the intermediate (56) was isomerised to an amide (57), which is an aryl copper intermediate in aqueous medium, subsequently leading to (58) as a result of intramolecular activation of the C–H bond. Subsequently, the reductive elimination product was obtained, which could be recycled.

Synthesis of Schiff-base. 
M. Z. Ansari and co-workers developed the honey-mediated green synthesis of a graphene-based NiO2/Cu2O nanocomposite (Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs) catalyst for the synthesis of functionalized Schiff-base derivatives (Scheme 18).42 The synthesis of substituted Schiff-base derivatives provided good to excellent yields (80–90%) in the absence of ligand. The authors used a mixture of 2-amino-benzo [de]isoquinolin-1,3-dione (59) or 2-aminoisoindoline-1,3-dione, (1 mmol) (61), Gr@NiO2/Cu2O NCs and appropriate aldehyde (44) (1.1 mmol) in 15 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) with a few drops of glacial acetic acid (GAA). The reaction mixture was stirred at 120 °C and the progress of the reaction was checked by TLC to achieve the desired product (60 or 62).
 Scheme 18  Synthetic route for Schiff-base derivatives using Cu2O NCs.41 


Cu2O NP-mediated protodecarboxylation of 2-nitrobenzoic acid. 
Prechtl and co-workers reported that Cu2O NPs embedded in ionic liquids (ILs) are effective for the protodecarboxylation of 2-nitrobenzoic acid (Scheme 19).85 The nanoscale copper catalyst was prepared by thermal decomposition of basic copper carbonate in various IL without any additional reducing agent. Among six ILs, only the alkyl phosphonium-based ILs, namely, n-Bu4POAc and (n-Bu4P)2SO4, could decompose CuCO3 into Cu2O NPs at 120 °C and 160 °C, respectively. Finely divided Cu2O NPs were evaluated for the protodecarboxylation of 2-nitrobenzoic acid, which showed comparable activity. Quantitative conversion was achieved with 3 equivalents of Cu2O NPs in n-Bu4POAc, and the catalyst could be recycled in nine consecutive runs with similar efficiency. Substrate screening with 1 equivalent of Cu2O NPs in n-Bu4POAc revealed that 2-nitrobenzoic acids were prone to protodecarboxylation in low to modest conversion (10–65%), while other benzoic acids were essentially unreactive.
 Scheme 19  Protodecarboxylation of 2-nitrobenzoic acid.84 


Oxidation reactions. 
Oxidation of various organic compounds is an important methodology for both academic and industrial purposes. In this section we discuss the oxidation of different compounds, where Cu2O-based NPs are used as catalysts.


Cu@Cu2O NPs for the oxidation reaction of catechol. 
HKUST-1 (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), a copper-based metal organic framework, was investigated as a catalyst in various reactions by K. H. Park et al.86 However, HKUST-1 showed low catalytic activity in the oxidation of catechol. Therefore, they synthesized Cu@Cu2O by reduction of HKUST-1 for enhancement of its catalytic activity. The Cu@Cu2O NCs exhibited highly effective catalytic activity in the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (65) (Scheme 20).
 Scheme 20  Oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol catalysed by Cu@Cu2O.86 


Styrene oxidation reaction catalysed by carbon nanofibers (CNFs)-supported copper-Cu2O NPs (Cu–Cu2O NPs/CNFs). 
J. Bai et al. developed a Cu2O NP (Cu–Cu2O NPs/CNFs) catalyst for styrene oxidation through electrospinning, adsorption and reduction via high-pressure hydrogenation and high-temperature calcination methods.87 It was demonstrated that the catalyst had good catalytic activity and selectivity for benzaldehyde in the reaction. It was found that the conversion of styrene (67) to styrene oxide (68) and benzaldehyde (69) increased gradually to 99% in 3 h. When the reaction time was 3 h, the selectivity of benzaldehyde was more than 50% and it increased constantly as the reaction continued. However, the styrene oxide decreased gradually until it was almost non-existent at 9 h (Schemes 21 and 22).

 Scheme 22  Oxidation of thiophene by PANI/M-Cu2O.88 


Core–shell polyaniline/mesoporous Cu2O (PANI/M-Cu2O) NCs for the photocatalytic oxidation of thiophene. 
R.M. Mohamed et al. synthesized core shell/mesoporous Cu2O NCs for the photocatalytic oxidation of thiophene.88 The catalytic performance of the samples during the photocatalytic oxidation of thiophene under visible-light irradiation was determined by the authors. The photocatalytic degradation of thiophene under visible-light irradiation using 4% polyaniline/mesoporous Cu2O was 2.87, 2.20, and 1.34 times more effective than that observed when using Cu2O NPs, polyaniline/Cu2O NPs, and mesoporous Cu2O, respectively. The effectiveness and activity of the catalyst over five cycles revealed that the 4% PANI/M-Cu2O photocatalyst could be recycled.


Complete CO oxidation over Cu2O NPs supported on silica gel. 
Monodisperse Cu2O NPs prepared via the thermal decomposition of a Cu(I) precursor exhibited exceptional activity toward CO oxidation in CO/O2/N2 mixtures, which was developed by S. O'Brien et al.89 The authors concluded that greater than 99.5% conversion of CO to CO2 could be achieved at temperatures less than 250 °C for over 12 h and the presence of the silica gel extended the lifetime of the NPs (as shown in Fig. 8), presumably by preventing sintering, which decreases their effective surface area. The Cu2O NPs oxidized CO to CO2 for over 144 h with no dependence on O2 concentration before a decrease in reactivity was observed.
 Fig. 8  Complete CO oxidation over Cu2O NPs supported on silica gel.89 


Reduction reactions. 
Reduction plays a central role in the chemical industry, where reductive processes are used extensively in the synthesis of dyes, biologically active compounds, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and rubber chemicals, among others.90–94 In this section we discuss the reduction of different compounds, where Cu2O-based NPs are used as catalysts.
H. L. Wang and co-workers investigated the structure-dependent electrocatalytic properties of Cu2O NPs for the oxygen reduction reaction (Fig. 9).95 The electrocatalytic activity of the Cu2O NPs varied with different crystal planes, where the (100) plane showed the highest activity and four-electron selectivity, but lower peroxide yield (15%) for the oxygen reduction reaction than the (111) plane. They also showed that the Cu2O NPs exhibited better methanol tolerance and durability than commercial Pt/C materials for the oxygen reduction reaction.
 Fig. 9  Cu2O NP-catalysed oxygen reduction reaction.95 
In 2016, P. Babji and V.L. Rao developed an efficient method for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to their corresponding amines using Fe2O3–Cu2O–TiO2 NCs.96 The synthesized nanocomposite was exploited as solid phase catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in the presence of NaBH4 (Scheme 23). After adding NaBH4 to an aqueous solution of 4-NP, the color of the solution changed from light yellow to dark yellow due to the formation of 4-nitrophenolate ions. Then, the color of the 4-nitrophenolate ions faded with time after the addition of Fe2O3–Cu2O–TiO2 NCs and the rate of the reaction was independent of the concentration of NaBH4.
 Scheme 23  Reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.96–98 
Cu2O@Ag polyhedral core–shell NPs with different morphologies (rhombicuboctahedral, cuboctahedral, truncated octahedral, and octahedral) were successfully synthesized via a thermal decomposition approach for the reduction of 4-NP (73) to 4-aminophenol (74) (Scheme 23) and methylene blue to leucomethylene blue in aqueous solution by P. Jeevanandam and co-workers.97 The authors concluded that the NPs possessing an octahedral morphology showed the highest catalytic activity. The core–shell NPs were stable for up to five cycles without loss in efficiency.
H. M. Kao et al. synthesized ultrafine Cu2O NPs confined in cubic mesoporous carbon for the reduction of 4-NP (Scheme 23).98 The Cu2O NPs with a size of 4.0 nm within the mesopores of three-dimensional cubic ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-8) exhibited the best catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NP among the Cu-based CMK-8 NCs. The high surface area of the Cu2O NPs triggered fast 4-NP reduction with an exceptionally high rate constant. In addition, the Cu2O@CMK-8 NCs possessed remarkable reusability and can be a novel and promising material of choice for various practical applications in catalysis.


Heterocyclic reactions. 
Undoubtedly, the largest of the classical branches of organic chemistry is heterocyclic chemistry. The majority of pharmaceutical products possessing biological activity are heterocyclics and heteroaromatic derivatives are at the helm of various disease-fighting medicinal drugs. Heterocyclic compounds such as nucleic acids, vitamins, heme and chlorophyll, cephalosporins, and macrolides are actively engaged in biological and physiological processes and are dominant in nature.99,100



N-Arylations of N-heterocycles. 
Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in all living organisms. Cu2O NPs play a significant role in catalysing their synthesis. Recently, there have been numerous developments in the efficient synthesis of heterocyclics.101 Movahed et al. recently reported the synthesis of N-heterocycles on Cu@Cu2O NCs supported on RGO (Scheme 24).102L-Ascorbic acid, as a reductant, graphene oxide and CuSO4 were employed in the synthesis of Cu@Cu2O NPs. The N-arylation to yield N-heterocycles (77) was achieved in the reaction in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with Cs2CO3 as the base for 1 h at 110 °C using Cu@Cu2O NPs/RGO. This protocol was further extended for other N-heterocycles, giving a high range of yields in four consecutive cycles and also refurnishing the catalyst for recycling.

Regioselective synthesis of α-carbonyl furans catalysed by Cu2O NPs. 
Cu2O NPs were used as efficient catalysts for the regioselective synthesis of α-carbonyl furans from propionates (78) and propynols (79).103 The catalysts were prepared via a simple hydrothermal method,104 which involved the one-pot sequential PBu3-catalyzed formation of 1,5-enynes (80), followed by the Cu2O NPs catalysed cyclization of the latter into α-carbonyl furans (81) (Scheme 25). Diversely decorated furans were accessible through this efficient and regioselective methodology irrespective of the electronic nature of the two partner substituents.
 Scheme 25  Cu2O NP-catalysed regioselective synthesis of carbonyl furans.103 


Multicomponent synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives. 
The environmentally benign one-pot multicomponent synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives using cubic Cu2O NPs as catalysts in aqueous media was reported.105 The nanocatalysts were successfully employed in the synthesis of isoindolinones (82) using 2-iodo-N-arylbenzamides (84), a terminal alkyne (83), and substituted indoles/pyrroles (85) (Scheme 26). The reactions with pyrroles, 3-substituted indoles, and unsubstituted or N-substituted indoles took place at the C-2, C-2, and C-3 positions, respectively. The reasonable conversions in the case of aliphatic alkynes further demonstrated the versatility of the reaction. Interestingly, no alkyne dimerization (Glaser coupling) was observed during the reactions. The catalysts were assessed for their reusability under both aerobic and inert conditions and found to provide a better yield under inert conditions (82% after the fourth cycle) compared to aerobic conditions (72% after the fourth cycle).
 Scheme 26  Synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives using Cu2O NPs.105 


Furane derivatives for the synthesis of ene–yne ketones. 
Liu et al. efficiently synthesised furan derivatives from ene–yne ketones using Cu2O-based magnetically separable nanocatalysts.106 In their initial optimization step, 3-oct-2-ynylidenepentane-2,4-dione (86) was elected as the substrate to monitor not only the activity but also the selectivity of the catalytic process to yield the product (87, 88) in different ratios (Scheme 27). THF and L-proline were shown to be the best solvent and additive, respectively, and the selectivity of the reaction was altered simply by changing the reaction conditions from an aerobic to an inert atmosphere. The substrate scope of the reaction was extensively studied, which showed that the catalytic domino reaction with functional groups at different positions of the alkyne terminus and carbonyl carbon could lead to the regioselective formation of furan derivatives. In their proposed mechanism (Scheme 28), after the initial coordination of Cu(I) species with carbonyl oxygen and a triple bond (91), an intramolecular 5-exo-dig cyclization process allows the formation of either a 2-furylcarbene complex (92) or a zwitter-ionic intermediate (93). In the presence of air, the relatively unstable (91) undergoes aerial oxidation to afford the final product, whereas 1,2-H migrations from the adjacent carbon allowed the intermediate (93) to form the other regioisomers.

Biosensing applications
Biosensors are integrated receptor-transducer devices capable of providing selective quantitative or semi quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element.107 These biological elements include enzymes, whole cell and tissues. They are generally highly selective and offer real-time measurements for bio-analysis and bioprocess control. Cu2O NP-based biosensors have been widely studied for the accurate electrochemical detection of many biomolecules, which is extremely vital to the development of biomedical instruments and clinical diagnosis. Electrochemical biosensors mainly are three types: amperometric-based, potentiometric-based and impedimetric-based, where the amperometric-based mode is the most widely used.
An ultrasensitive amperometric immunosensor based on Cu2O@CeO2-Au NCs108 was synthesized by Y. Dong et al. A novel label-free electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the quantitative detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). An Au–Cu2O/RGO NC-based electrochemical sensor for the selective and simultaneous detection of dopamine and uric acid was developed by R. Sivasubramanian and co-workers. Biological fluids such as human serum and urine were employed to validate the performance of the sensor for real-time applications.109 Cu2O NPs were successfully used for the fabrication of spray-coated and screen-printed working electrodes on alumina substrates for the electrochemical detection of purine bases. J. Chomoucka and co-workers used Cu2O NP-based amperometric-based biosensors for the simultaneous detection of adenine and guanine.110 R. Yuan et al. developed a novel route for the synthesis of Cu2O–SiO2 nanostructured particles via a solution-phase method, which were adopted for the construction of a label-free amperometric immunosensor. The porous Cu2O–SiO2 NCs exhibited good redox electrochemical activity, large surface-to-volume ratio, film-forming ability and high stability. The fabricated immunosensor allowed the low-cost, sensitive, and quantitative detection of ferritin, and has potential application in clinical immune assays.111 J. Yang and co-workers developed the size-controlled synthesis of Cu2O NPs on RGO sheets (Cu2O/RGO) and their application as non-enzymatic glucose sensor materials.112 The smallest size composite-based electrode showed excellent electrochemical activities for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose in alkaline medium. The proposed biosensor was applied for the quantification of glucose with high sensitivity and durability, wide linear range, low detection limit of 0.1 μM, and ease of construction, and thus is promising for the future development of non-enzymatic glucose sensors. Cu2O mesoporous nanospheres (Cu2O MPNS) with different pore size distributions were fabricated and applied as electrocatalysts for the detection of glucose113 by Y. Li et al. In the electrochemical measurements for glucose detection, the large pore size-Cu2O modified electrode exhibited better electrocatalytic activity compared with the small pore size Cu2O-modified electrode. The results showed that the internal diffusion rate plays a vital role in the performance of the sensor. The obtained large pore size Cu2O biosensor exhibited a low detection limit, good sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability, reproducibility, and a wide detection range (0.003 to 7.8 mM) due to its improved internal diffusion and electron transfer ability. G. W. Qin et al. developed an enzyme-free amperometric electrochemical sensor, which was fabricated by casting Nafion-impregnated Cu2O NPs onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Electrochemical analysis of the particulate Cu2O for detecting H2O2 and glucose was described, showing remarkable sensitivity in both cases (Table 3).114

Au/Cu2O NCs were successfully synthesized by L. Tian and co-workers. Au/Cu2O/GCE exhibited excellent performances for the non-enzymatic detection of H2O2 with high selectivity, low detection limit, and strong anti-interference capability. The excellent electrocatalytic activity may be caused by the introduction of Au and the synergistic effect between Au and Cu2O.115 B. B. Jiang and co-workers modified a GCE with Cu2O NPs, nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) and Nafion to obtain a novel sensing platform for the non-enzymatic detection of hydrogen peroxide. The modified electrode was found to have high sensitivity, high catalytic activity and short response time.116 The electrochemical performance of a Cu2O/CuO@RGO modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) for the oxidation of H2O2 was studied by D. Wu et al. The modified electrode exhibited high sensitivity, low detection limit and good selectivity and stability.117 CuO–Cu2O was proposed as a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for the detection of L-cystine. A CuO–Cu2O heterojunction was synthesized by Y. Zhu et al. via a one-step flame spray pyrolysis process, which was employed as a photoactive material for the construction of a PEC sensing device.118 I. C. Wu et al. synthesized a p–n heterojunction nano-structure ZnO/Cu2O photoelectrochemical and self-powered biosensor for the detection of esophageal cancer cells. Four types of human esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) were detected by this biosensor without requiring an extra bias voltage. The measured photocurrent values of high invasion capacity cancer cells were consistently twice that measured by a slight invasion capacity cancer cell.119 L. N. Wu and co-workers developed a dopamine sensor based on a hybrid material composed of Cu2O hollow microspheres and carbon black. The authors studied the electrocatalytic properties of modified GCE towards dopamine oxidation via cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry and found that the sensor displayed a higher electrocatalytic activity and higher sensitivity toward dopamine oxidation compared to other modified electrodes.120

Remedial action. 
A variety of methods are employed for the remediation of the environment to make it free from a wide range of toxins via physical and chemical processes. The physical methods involve reverse osmosis,121 flocculation122 and degradation, while the chemical methods consist of chlorination123 and ozonation.124 Due to its ease of operation compared with reported methods, photocatalytic degradation is one of the most investigated methods for the remediation of dyes in aqueous media. Applying semiconductor photocatalysts to remove organic contaminants in air and water provides a useful approach for solving environmental problems. Cu2O NPs and their NCs play a vital role in the remediation of toxicants, as described in Table 4. In situ remediation by Cu2O NPs and their NCs has widespread environmental implications since they have the potential to decontaminate water by adsorbing toxins such arsenates and arsinites125 and also cause the adsorption and speciation of Cr(VI),126 which is another hazardous pollutant. Organic dyes, which are industrial effluents and major pollutants in water, have been photocatalytically degraded by Cu2O NPs and their NCs.

Medicinal applications. 
Cu2O NPs and their NCs have wide application in the field of medicinal chemistry. In this section we discuss their antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Although they have not been widely investigated as an efficient drug delivery system, Cu2O NPs have good biological properties including effective antimicrobial action against a wide range of pathogens and also drug resistant bacteria. These properties have led to the development of various approaches with direct applications to the biomedical field, such as tailored surfaces with antimicrobial effect. K. Giannousi et al. synthesized Cu2O and Cu/Cu2O NPs and their fungistatic and fungicidal activity were studied for in vitro activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which constitutes a unicellular eukaryotic model microorganism in molecular and cell biology.137 Cu2O NPs/zeolite was synthesized by B. D. Du et al., which showed antibacterial activity against E. coli. Cu2O NPs/zeolite can be favourably produced on large scale for water treatment and agricultural application as an antimicrobial agent.138 S. Zhao and co-workers synthesized Cu2O NPs as a potential agent for uveal melanoma therapy. The synthesized Cu2O-NPs were able to adsorb serum proteins in the cell culture medium, which were then internalized by uveal melanoma cells mainly through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, Cu2O NPs selectively inhibited cancer cell growth and impaired the ability of uveal melanoma cell migration, invasion and the cytoskeleton assembly.139 Shiyun Ai et al. used lignin (paper making waste liquid) to obtain Cu2O NPs. The synthesised Cu2O NPs exhibited efficient antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity against E. coli and S. Aureus.33 Brown algae (Bifurcaria bifurcata) extract was also used to study the synthesis of Cu2O and CuO NPs. The synthesized NPs were found to exhibit high antibacterial activity against two different strains of bacteria, E. aerogenes (Gram negative) and S. aureus (Gram positive).39 The synthesis of hexagonal and cubic shaped Cu2O NPs using Tridax procumbens leaf extract was described by K. Gopalakrishnan et al. The synthesised NPs were examined for antibacterial activities against E. coli as a model Gram-negative bacteria and it was concluded that these biosynthesized NPs can replace some antibiotic medicines used to combat pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of animals.34Camellia sinensis leaf extract was also used as a reducing and stabilising agent to form Cu2O NPs. The truncated cubic and spherical NPs were examined for their antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and B. cereus bacteria.35

Conclusions
Currently, the most significant research is aimed at emphasising the synthesis and applications of Cu2O NPs. The control and tailoring of their architecture provide a comprehensive strategy for the formation of Cu2O NPs and their NCs, which have multifarious applications that are environmentally friendly. The current review highlighted the green protocols and sustainable applications of Cu2O NPs and their composites, which is expected to arouse special interest in innovating similar routes and applications with catalysis at the forefront. It will surely encourage new researchers and provide a meritorious platform for designing a wide range of Cu2O template architectures, which can eventually lead to environment friendly applications. It is also expected to motivate researchers at the industrial level to achieve scalability with economic advantages.
