    , Accepted 5th July 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractIn this study, we prepared three kesterite thin-film solar cells, Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), and based on low light intensity measurements, examined the possibility of using kesterite devices for indoor applications. Interestingly, all the prepared cells exhibited nearly the same device efficiency under standard test conditions of 1 sun; however, under illumination with low-intensity halogen and LED lamps (200–400 lux), the power output of CZTSSe was twice that of CZTSe and CZTS. CZTSe (58%) and CZTS (37%) showed relatively larger open-circuit voltage drops than CZTSSe (29%). Suns–Voc measurements revealed that the ideality factor of CZTS and CZTSe increased as the light intensity decreased, which indicates severe recombination caused by deep-level defects at low light intensities. Furthermore, admittance spectroscopy measurements revealed that CZTSe and CZTS have deep trap energy levels, whereas CZTSSe has comparatively shallower trap energy levels; this validates the rapid open-circuit voltage drop under low light intensity conditions. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements showed that CZTSSe exhibited a higher photovoltage (86 mV) under illumination at 400 lux compared with that under dark conditions. In addition, our results indicated that the CZTSSe sample showed relatively much higher charge separation at GBs (grain boundaries) owing to the downward band bending at the GBs. The findings revealed that for deeper energy levels, the open-circuit voltage reduction was faster; in addition, an absorber layer with shallower defects and efficient charge separation at the GBs can induce high power conversion efficiency under low-light conditions.
1. Introduction
Recent advancements in thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology have widened the scope of indoor applications of energy harvesting technologies.1,2 In such applications, PV devices operate under low-light conditions, that is, the intensity of light is much lower than that of sunlight.3,4 The best example of indoor applications is PV-integrated internet of things (IoT) electronic devices5,6 that are self-powered smart devices for everyday use. Demand for such devices has surged for developing smart houses and industries because they present an opportunity to control the increasing energy demand and thereby save energy.7 PV devices that utilize indoor light in addition to sunlight can be used as energy storage devices to power IoTs.8 PV devices can generate energy from the surrounding environment for prolonged usage and are thus vital for IoT devices.9
The operating conditions and requirements for indoor PV devices differ from those of outdoor PV devices. It is well known that mid-to-wide bandgap (1.5–1.8 eV) materials are preferred for indoor PV devices. This is because mid-bandgap materials can effectively harvest the narrow absorption spectra in the visible range.10 In general, materials providing a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) with a high shunt resistance are preferred for indoor PV applications. Under AM 1.5G spectral conditions, PV devices based on different materials, such as silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), organic PVs, perovskite, and dye-sensitized solar cells, have been reported for outdoor applications.11,12 Among them, silicon based PVs are dominating the current PV market and exhibit excellent performance at 1 sun illumination;13 however, below 1 sun, they exhibit very low photovoltage and poor device performance.
PV devices generate an insignificant amount of photogenerated charge carriers under a very low intensity (200–1000 lux) of indoor light in the visible spectrum. In addition, different photo-responses of graded or different bandgap materials in the visible spectrum lead to a high density of defects and vacancies in PV devices fabricated using the aforementioned materials, which causes unfavorable shutting or recombination of charge carriers within these trap sites. This results in low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PV devices in indoor environments. Therefore, it is necessary to study and elucidate the role of defects and the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers under low-light conditions.14
Considering the need for low-cost sustainable PV technologies, several PV materials have been explored for indoor applications. Kesterite has been widely recognized as a promising PV absorber material.15 Kesterite is advantageous for indoor or low intensity light applications because it has a high absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1 and a direct bandgap.16 Unlike their predecessor CIGS, kesterite materials consist of earth-abundant, low-cost, and environment-friendly elements.17 The kesterite family includes Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS); the bandgap (Eg = 1.0–1.5 eV) and Voc can be tuned by changing the [S]/[S + Se] ratio.17 CZTSSe has shown a record efficiency of 12.6% with a Voc of 513 mV.18 Despite their promising performance, kesterite thin film solar cells have not been studied for indoor applications. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a detailed investigation on the performance of kesterite family materials under low-light conditions to broaden their application scope and thus promote them as a potential candidate for indoor PV applications.
To investigate the optoelectronic and physical properties of different kesterite thin film solar cells under low light intensity conditions (few hundred lux), three different kesterite thin-film solar cells, CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS, were fabricated. Among the three kesterite solar cells, CZTSSe showed the best performance under low light intensity conditions. The evaluation of the defects revealed that the existence of the shallow defects mainly contributes to the enhanced performance of CZTSSe compared to that of CZTS and CZTSe, and the deep level defects hinder the power output of CZTS and CZTSe.
2. Experimental
The precursors of CZTSe and CZTSSe were deposited by sputtering metal targets (Cu, Zn, and Sn, from bottom to top) with specific chemical composition ratios on Mo substrates using a magnetron sputtering system (RSP-5000, SNTech). Similarly, CZTS precursor films were deposited by co-sputtering Cu, ZnS, and SnS on a Mo substrate by using a magnetron sputtering system (ATC-2000, AJA international). CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS were then annealed followed by selenization (only Se condition), sulfo-selenization (S:Se ratio = 1:100), and sulfurization (a combined atmosphere of sulfur and SnS) at 490, 520, and 560 °C, respectively. The average composition of the absorbers was controlled to be Cu-poor and Zn-rich. Subsequently, 50 nm-thick cadmium sulfide (CdS) layers were deposited on the absorbers by chemical bath deposition. Finally, a 50 nm-thick ZnO layer and a transparent conductive oxide layer (210 nm-thick indium doped thin oxide (ITO) for CZTS and 660 nm-thick AZO (aluminum dope zinc oxide) for CZTSe and CZTSSe) were deposited by sputtering. No anti-reflective coating was applied to the samples.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a measurement system (PV measurements, USA) to determine the performance of the devices (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2) with a class AAA solar simulator (WXS-155S-L2, Wacom, Japan). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured using a QEX10 spectral response system (S-9230, SOMA Optics, Japan).

Fig. 1 shows the low light intensity J–V measurement station. We employed a halogen which has a broader spectrum (nm) for covering different bandgaps of the kesterite solar cells in this study. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was performed using an atomic force microscope (AIST-NT SmartSPM™ 1000) in air using a gold-coated Si tip with a 6 nm radius of curvature (HYDRA6R-100NG-10, APPNANO) as the probe in the noncontact mode with an AC voltage of −1 to +1 V. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) was performed using an LCR meter (E4980A, Agilent) by applying an AC frequency of 2 Hz to 1 MHz to the solar cell device in the temperature range of 300–90 K. To analyze the AS results, we employed the data resistance-reactance Rp–Cp model (Cp-D) mode, which provides good accuracy under low-resistance conditions.19

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics and EQE spectra of the three samples. To compare the indoor performances of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS, we ensured that the prepared samples have nearly similar PCEs (8–9%) under 1 sun illumination. In addition, the bandgap of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS is 1.0, 1.13, and 1.5 eV, respectively, and the J–V curves show that the three samples have different bandgaps. Pure selenide CZTSe shows the highest Jsc (36.3 mA cm−2) but the lowest Voc (412 mV) because its bandgap is the smallest among the three samples. On the other hand, pure sulfide CZTS demonstrates the highest Voc (625 mV) and the lowest Jsc (19.9 mA cm−2); CZTSSe has intermediate values for Jsc and Voc. The detailed J–V data of the samples are presented in Table 1.

Fig. 2(b) shows the EQE spectra of the samples. Since the bandgaps of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS are different, the absorption edges of the samples are also different. In a previous report, it was observed that the S/(S + Se) ratio strongly influences the bandgap of the absorber layer.20 Hence, as expected, the bandgaps of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS are different; the pure sulfide has a high band gap of 1.5 eV, pure selenide about 1.0 eV and mixed sulfoselenide 1.13 eV.

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS measured at 400 lux (halogen lamp) and their power outputs. Unlike the J–V characteristics under 1 sun, which show similar PCEs, the power outputs of the samples are considerably different. At 400 lux, CZTSSe shows the highest power output (45 μW cm−2), which is 2.4 times higher than that of pure sulfide CZTS (19.1 μW cm−2). Surprisingly, the PCEs of the samples at 1 sun are similar; however, the power output of CZTSSe is nearly two times that of the other two samples (see Table 2). The spectrum of the halogen lamp shown in Fig. 1(b) is more beneficial to the high-bandgap CZTS than to CZTSe and CZTSSe. The detailed J–V data of the samples at 400 lux are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, CZTSe and CZTS showed relatively large Voc drops, as observed by comparing the J–V curves measured at 200 and 400 lux. It is well known that Jsc has a linear relationship with light intensity, while the Voc has a logarithmic relationship with light intensity. In the case of CZTSSe (Fig. 3(b)), the Jsc and Voc changed with light intensity as expected; however, the Voc of CZTSe and CZTS did not change with light intensity. Besides, all three samples showed increased Rs at 400 lux compared with that at 1 sun; however, the Rs of CZTS increased dramatically from 1.1 Ω cm2 at 1 sun to 119.6 Ω cm2 at 400 lux. A decrease in light intensity decreases the conductivity of the photo-absorber, thus increasing the Rs.21 However, CZTS showed a better fill factor compared with the other two samples.

As shown in Table 2, the Voc drops of CZTSe and CZTS are much greater than that of CZTSSe. The lower power outputs of CZTSe and CZTS at 400 lux are an important issue. As can be seen, the Voc drop of CZTSSe from 1 sun to 400 lux is approximately 29%, while those of CZTSe and CZTS are 58% and 37%, respectively. This can also be observed from the J–V curves of the samples measured at 200 and 400 lux (Fig. 3). As can be seen, the Jsc of CZTSSe at 200 lux is two times smaller than that at 400 lux, and the Voc decreases logarithmically. On the other hand, the Voc drops of CZTSe and CZTS significantly exceeded the logarithmic value. We assume that this is directly related to the higher Voc drops of CZTSe and CZTS compared with CZTSSe. It is well known that a decrease in light intensity decreases the conductivity of the photo-absorber materials, thus increasing the Rs of the device. Therefore, we assume that pure sulphide CZTS has a lower photoresponse (Jsc) compared to that of CZTSe and CZTSSe due to the highest bandgap, and hence pure sulfide CZTS possesses high Rs at 400 lux.
The deviation of the n value from 1 indicates either the existence of unusual recombination or recombination with varying magnitude. In particular, the n = ∼2 diode accounts for SRH (Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination in the space-charge region of the junction, whereas the n = 1 diode accounts for an ideal device, i.e. band to band radiative recombination.22 As can be seen in Table 2, the local ideality factors of CZTS are over the value of 2, and CZTSe is closed to the value of 2. This indicates that the major recombination is dominated by deep-level defects, leading to more Voc drops in low intensity light. Therefore, the severe Voc loss of CZTSe and CZTS at a low light intensity can be attributed to SRH recombination via deep-level defects.
To elucidate the Voc drop with a decrease in light intensity, we measured the variation in Voc as a function of light intensity (Suns–Voc curves). The devices were illuminated with a slowly decaying (∼10 ms) flashlight (xenon flash lamp) and the photovoltages as a function of illuminated light intensity were recorded in the absence of a series resistance. The light intensity was monitored using a single crystal silicon reference solar cell. Fig. 4 shows that, with a decrease in light intensity, the Voc decreased much faster for CZTSe and CZTS than for CZTSSe. This is consistent with the low light intensity J–V measurement results. The Voc of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS decreased from 420 mV to 160 mV, 490 mV to 300 mV, and 620 mV to 350 mV, respectively, as determined by analyzing the Voc curves of the samples from 1 sun to 1 × 10−3 sun. The Voc reduction trends of CZTSe and CZTSSe are similar from 1 to 0.1 sun; however, they showed higher Voc reduction below 0.1 sun. Similarly, the Voc reduction trends of CZTS and CZTSSe are similar until 0.1 sun; however, the amount of Voc reduction decreased rapidly for CZTS as it showed downward bending. At light intensities lower than 0.1 sun, the Voc reduced more in the case of CZTSe and CZTS than in the case of CZTSSe; thus, the low-intensity light outputs of CZTSe and CZTS were lower than that of CZTSSe. This is possibly because of the effect of trap states or deep-level defects in CZTSe and CZTS, which reduced the Voc at low light intensities.

To confirm the defect energy levels in the bandgaps of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS absorber layers, AS measurements were performed on the three devices. The capacitance–frequency (C–f) spectra were measured in the temperature range of 300 K to 90 K (Fig. 5(a–c)) under dark conditions, and the inflection points of the capacitance spectra were used to obtain the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 5(d–f)). The defect energy levels were calculated from the linear fitting of the Arrhenius plots by using eqn (1): ω0 = 2πν0T2exp(−Et/kT),(1)where ω0 is the inflection point frequency, Et is the defect energy level in the bandgap, ν0 is the emission factor, and T is the temperature.23 The trap energy levels of CZTSe and CZTS were calculated to be 170 meV and 218 meV, respectively. On the other hand, the CZTSSe film showed two trap energy levels of 53 meV and 91 meV. This implies that among the three samples, the CZTS film has defects with the deepest energy level, whereas the CZTSSe film contains shallow-level defects. The finding coincides with our expectation. The deeper the energy level of the defects in the absorber layer, the faster the decrease in the amount of Voc reduction. This signifies that the absorber layer containing shallower defects induces a higher PCE at a low light intensity. As discussed above, the trap energy levels of CZTS, CZTSe and CZTSSe films were calculated to be 218 meV, 170 meV and 91 meV, respectively and accordingly CZTS (pure sulfide absorber) exhibits deeper energy level defects. The deeper the energy level of the defects in the absorber layer, the faster the decrease in the amount of Voc reduction. At light intensities lower than 0.1 sun, the Voc reduced more in the case of CZTS (270 mV) and CZTSe (260 mV), and both are reduced faster than in the case of CZTSSe (190 mV).

KPFM was performed to study the local surface potential to determine the morphology and local electronic properties of the CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS devices in the dark and at 400 lux. All the samples consist of a CdS buffer layer on top in order to study the charge separation properties in real device operating conditions. The CPD maps of CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS obtained in the dark are shown in Fig. 6(a–c), respectively, and the corresponding CPD maps obtained at 400 lux are shown in Fig. 6(d–f), respectively. The CPD distribution of each map is presented in Fig. 6(g). As can be seen, CZTSe and CZTSSe show comparable CPD peaks at 0.360 V, while CZTS shows a peak at 0.327 V. This indicates that the work function of the CdS layer, which covers the sample surface, changed slightly in the case of CZTS. This is possibly because of the different growth conditions of the CdS layer or interdiffusion at the CZTS/CdS interface. When measured under light illumination, the curves shifted to lower CPDs for all the samples (Fig. 6(g)). This is responsible for the accumulation of excess electrons diffusing to the top surface of the sample, which were separated from the absorber/CdS interface. CZTSSe shows the largest shift (86 mV), which indicates that charge separation occurred most effectively which could possibly be responsible from the shallower trap levels confirmed by the AS measurement. Meanwhile, the CPD peaks of CZTS and CZTSSe shifted by 47 and 13 mV, respectively. This trend is also consistent with the Voc drop trend (Table 2). The average CPD at grain interiors (GIs) and grain boundaries (GBs) in the dark and at 400 lux are depicted in Fig. 6(h–j). As can be seen, the GIs of all the samples in the dark are comparable for CZTSe and CZTSSe samples while the CZTS sample has a relatively lower CPD. In addition, the CPD in the GIs in the dark is higher than that at the GBs for the CZTS sample; however, the CPDs of both CZTSe and CZTSSe are lower at the GBs than in the GIs. This implies that the band bending at the GBs is opposite, which could be responsible for the presence of oppositely charged defect states at the GBs of the CZTS sample. Under light illumination, the CPDs of all the samples decreased in the GIs, with CZTSSe showing the largest decrease of 55 mV followed by CZTS (48 mV) and CZTSe (15 mV). Similarly, the CPD decreased at the GBs upon illumination; however, it is noteworthy that for CZTSSe, the CPD reduction at the GBs is much larger than that in the GIs compare to CZTS and CZTSe. This indicates that the charge carriers were separated most effectively at the GBs of the CZTSSe sample. In earlier studies, the KPFM measurements of kesterite absorber layers have shown downward band bending at the GB relative to grains (lower work function at the GB) due to compositional variation across the GB.24 It was explained that downward band bending at the GB can attract minority carriers toward the GB, while majority carriers are repelled away from the boundaries.25,26 This results in enhanced charge carrier separation and reduced recombination at the GBs, which improve the device performance. Our results evidenced that such phenomena occur most effectively in CZTSSe samples under low light conditions.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we examined the possibility of using kesterite-based thin-film solar cells for indoor applications through low light intensity measurements. Three kesterite thin-film solar cells, namely CZTSe, CZTSSe, and CZTS, were prepared and analyzed by Suns–Voc, AS, and KPFM measurements. The PCEs of all the samples were nearly the same under 1 sun illumination; however, the samples exhibited different PCEs under low light intensity conditions. The power output of CZTSSe was nearly twice those of pure selenide (CZTSe) and sulfide-based (CZTS) cells, even though the halogen lamp spectrum was more beneficial to high-bandgap CZTS than to CZTSe and CZTSSe. The Voc drops in CZTSe (58%) and CZTS (37%) were more significant than that in CZTSSe (29%). The Suns–Voc measurements revealed that the ideality factors of CZTS and CZTSe increased with a decrease in light intensity up to two orders of magnitude under 0.005 sun illumination. Additionally, the Voc drop trends of CZTSe and CZTS were similar to that of CZTSSe from 1 to 0.1 sun; however, it increased below 0.1 sun. AS measurements showed that the CZTS device has defects with the deepest energy level of 218 meV compared with CZTSe and CZTSSe. The CZTSSe films contained shallow-level defects with two trap energy levels of 53 meV and 91 meV. In addition, it indicates that the deeper the energy level of defects in the absorber layer, the faster will be the Voc reduction. Furthermore, the CPD peaks of CZTSSe showed a larger shift of 86 mV under 400 lux than those of CZTS and CZTSe, as observed by KPFM. Additionally, the GBs of CZTSSe showed severe downward band bending toward GBs which resulted in efficient charge separation at the GBs.
Finally, it was concluded that the depth and density of energy levels strongly affect the Voc reduction. In addition, it signifies that the absorber layer having shallower defects along with higher charge separation at the GBs induces a higher PCE under low-light conditions. Thus, CZTSSe has the potential to be used as an efficient absorber material under low light intensity conditions for indoor PV applications.
