, Accepted 14th October 2014First published on 14th October 2014AbstractWe have designed and synthesized a series of organic dyes featuring phenothiazine donors containing an N-phenylbenzimidazole substituent and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. Benzimidazole incorporation red-shifted the charge transfer transition and increased the molar extinction coefficient of the peak. It also helped to fine-tune the HOMO and LUMO energies of the dyes due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the benzimidazole. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the dyes possessing N-phenylbenzimidazole showed efficiency better than the analogous dye without benzimidazole. The hike in the efficiency resulted from the increase in short-circuit current and open circuit voltage. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the devices revealed that the integration of benzimidazole in the dye enhances the life time of the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and resists electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
Introduction
During the past two decades, among the photovoltaic devices, DSSCs have received immense interest, since Grätzel et al. reported ruthenium-based sensitizers such as N3,1 N719,2 and black dye3 for DSSCs with validated efficiencies greater than 11% under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation. They enjoy supremacy due to their high efficiencies, easy fabrication, decorative nature, low cost of production and eco-friendliness when compared to silicon-based solar cells.4 However, despite their high efficiencies researchers found some inconvenience to handle them, such as use of expensive metals to synthesize sensitizers, low molar extinction coefficients of charge transfer bands, difficulties in purification, environmental pollution and limited resources.5 To overcome such prohibitive issues, metal-free-sensitizers including organic dyes (η = 9.8–12.5%),6 porphyrins (η = 12.3–13%)7 and phthalocyanines were tested with decent success. Recently, perovskite-based solar cells have also received good response due to the solid state assembly and record efficiency (>15%).8 Among them, organic dyes possess special features such as high molar extinction coefficients, cost effectiveness, environmental friendly synthesis and facile purification and diverse structural modifications to fine-tune the function.9
It is well known that, DSSC device is a composite of photoanode such as mesoporous anatase TiO2 & ZnO, redox electrolyte (I−/I3−, Br3−/Br−, Co(II)–Co(III)), sensitizer (organic or inorganic), counter electrode (platinum or carbon).9a,7c,6d,10 Among them, sensitizers play a pivotal role on the cell performance. Most of the organic sensitizers used in DSSCs have the rod-shape donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) molecular configuration. But due to their linear shape they are inclined to form intermolecular aggregates on the TiO2 surface which affects the light absorption and loss in the photo-generated electrons.9d,11
Therefore it is necessary to develop an organic sensitizer to maximize the accumulation of electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and alleviates the loss of electrons by recombination. Non-planar structural elements have been found to be beneficial for some of this purposes.6d,12
Phenothiazine has been widely demonstrated as a successful building block (donor or linker) in the monoanchoring13 or dianchoring14 sensitizers. Phenothiazine possesses low oxidation potentials and forms stable cation radicals on electron removal.15 Structurally also it is unique due to butterfly conformation which may be beneficial to impede the molecular aggregation.16 Realizing these advantages, phenothiazine-containing molecular dyes have been intensively explored. Additional chromophores such as ethylthio-,17 4-hexyloxyphenyl-,13d 4-octyloxyphenyl,18 2,4-dihexyloxyphenyl-,19 1,1,2-triphenylethene,16a,20 fluorene,21 triarylamine,16a,22 carbazole23 and phenothiazine13e have been incorporated on phenothiazine nucleus to enhance the relay of electron from donor to acceptor which gave satisfactory results in DSSC. The chromophores which extend the range of π-electron delocalization in the dye molecule would increase the molar extinction coefficient of the absorption and stabilize the cation radicals formed during the photo-induced electron ejection. Several groups have reported imidazole,24 phenanthroimidazole25 and pyrenoimidazole26 as donors in sensitizers. Also imidazoles have been used as auxiliary chromophores in the triphenylamine-based organic dyes and found to extend the absorption maxima to the longer wavelength region and hike the molar extinction coefficients.27 In this paper, we report organic dyes containing phenothiazine donors and N-phenylbenzimidazole auxiliary chromophores (Fig. 1). Using voluminous segments derived from triarylamine, despite possessing good donor strength reduce the dye-loading significantly.13d,16a We assume that N-phenylbenzimidazole may not increase the bulkiness of the dyes significantly, however, may be sufficient to provide hydrophobic environment to inhibit the penetration of electrolyte. N-Phenylbenzimidazole moieties have been identified to impart electron-transporting capability to dyes and the derivatives have found effective use as electron-transporting layer in organic light-emitting diodes.28 However, its use in the design of organic sensitizers has not received enough focus.

Experimental section
The precursors, 3-bromo-10-butyl-10H-phenothiazine (9)13d and 7-bromo-10-butyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde (1)29 required for the synthesis of the dyes were synthesized according to literature procedures. All other chemicals were procured from commercial sources and used as received. Solvents used for photophysical measurements were distilled over suitable dehydrating agents according to standard methods. All the synthetically obtained compounds were purified by column chromatography using 100–200 mesh silica gel. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker NMR spectrometer operating at 500.13 and 125.77 MHz, respectively. The chemical shifts were calibrated from the residual peaks observed for the deuterated solvents chloroform (CDCl3) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6) at δ 7.26 and δ 2.52 for 1H; 77.0 and 39.5 for 13C, respectively. High resolution mass spectra were measured using a Bruker TOF-Q ESI mass spectrometer. The optical absorption and emission spectra of the dyes were measured for the freshly prepared air equilibrated solutions at room temperature by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer and spectrofluorimeter, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with an electrochemical analyzer using a conventional three-electrode assembly comprising glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and a non-aqueous (acetonitrile) Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The E1/2 values were determined as (Eap + Ecp)/2, where Eap and Ecp are the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, respectively. Ferrocene was used as the internal potential marker.

Fabrication of dye sensitized solar cells
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass electrode (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1, transmittance ca. 80%) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of titanium tetraisopropoxide (1 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (3 g) to obtain a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. TiO2 pastes were coated onto the treated conducting glass by using the doctor blade technique. To coat each TiO2 layer, the dried TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C under an oxygen atmosphere and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The TiO2 photoanodes of the DSSCs employed in the experiments were composed of a 12 μm thickness and 13 nm particle size TiO2 layer/5 μm scattering TiO2 layer. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye at room temperature for 24 h. The standard ruthenium complex, N719, was dissolved in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (1:1) to make a reference dye solution. Various organic dye solutions were prepared in a mixing solvent containing MeCN/tert-BuOH/DMSO (3.5:3.5:3 v/v). Then the prepared TiO2/dye electrode was placed on a platinum-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq−1), thus keeping the two electrodes separated by a 25 μm thick Surlyn. The two electrodes were then sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3 methoxypropionitrile (MPN)/MeCN (1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity; the electrolyte-injecting hole was previously made in the counter electrode with a drilling machine, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the injection of the electrolyte. The surface of the DSSC was covered by a mask with a light-illuminated area of 0.16 cm2 and then illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator. Incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard silicon cell. Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat. The thickness of the TiO2 film was judged by scanning electron microscopic images (SEM). For UV absorption spectra, dye molecules were coated on the TiO2 films, and the corresponding spectra were obtained by using an UV/Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained from the potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with a FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 MHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC between the ITO–Pt counter electrode and the FTO–TiO2 dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding alternating current (AC) amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed by using an equivalent circuit model. IPCE curves were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5 G); light was focused through a monochromator onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/ϕ), where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and ϕ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector and a power meter.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The synthetic scheme used for the preparation of N-phenylbenzimidazole incorporated phenothiazine-based dyes is illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis of the control dye GJ5 which lacks benzimidazole group but possesses bithiophene in the conjugation pathway was accomplished by the protocol depicted in Scheme 2. In the first step, the brominated phenothiazine aldehyde, 7-bromo-10-butyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde (1) was treated with N1-phenylbenzene-1,2-diamine in the presence of sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) in DMF to obtain the benzimidazole functionalized phenothiazine, 2.30 Subsequently, the bromo-phenothiazines (2, 7 & 9) were subjected to Stille coupling31 or Suzuki–Miyaura coupling32 reactions with the suitable tin or boron reagents to yield the required aldehydes (3–5, 8 & 10). In the final step the aldehydes were treated with cyanoacetic acid by adopting Knoevenagel condensation reaction conditions33 to result in the target dyes GJ1–GJ5. All the dyes are red in color and found to solubilize in most common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, etc. They are sparingly soluble in alcohols and insoluble in n-hexane. All the new compounds were thoroughly analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and the data consistent with the proposed structures.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the dyes measured in tetrahydrofuran are shown in Fig. 2(a) while the optical parameters listed in Table 1. All the dyes, except GJ5 exhibited two prominent peaks covering the entire visible region in the absorption spectra. The intense peak positioned ca. 300 nm is attributed to the localized π–π* transition. This peak shows no appreciable variations due to the alternations in the conjugation pathway. Also, the absence of this peak in GJ5 suggests the involvement of N-phenylbenzimidazole moiety in this absorption. The low energy absorption occurring at above 400 nm is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition between the phenothiazine donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. Among the dyes GJ2 exhibited the longest wavelength absorption while GJ3 and GJ4 share the credit for the highest energy ICT. The high molar extinction coefficient and the red-shifted absorption realized for GJ2 when compared to GJ5 is attesting the beneficial role of N-phenylbenzimidazole moiety for the light harvesting property. Also, GJ1 showed bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra when compared to the closely related dye SH-729 reported in the literature. Similar to GJ1, SH-7 also possesses phenothiazine donor, thiophene conjugation and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. But, benzimidazole auxiliary chromophore is absent in SH-7. All these observations point that the benzimidazole moiety is not acting as electron acceptor. An electron acceptor attached to the donor may compete for electron-density from the donor. Such a competitive electron withdrawal from the donor by an additional acceptor may decrement the desired donor–acceptor interaction between the donor and cyanoacrylic acid unit. This generally results in the blue-shift of the charge-transfer transition. However, the red-shift observed for the present compounds on inclusion of benzimidazole may be explained on the basis of increase in the conjugation dimension for the donor unit. This could increase the π-electron density available for donation to acceptor. Alternatively, the poor optical properties of GJ3 and GJ4 are attributed to the phenyl spacer in the conjugation which effectively reduces the donor–acceptor interaction because of its non-planar arrangement. It is interesting that the ICT peak of the dye GJ4 is similar to that of GJ3 despite the former possessing an additional thiophene in the conjugation pathway which further supports the insulating behavior of phenyl linker. The dyes possessing bithiophene in the conjugation exhibited relatively intense absorption when compared to the remaining dyes. All these observations point that the electron-rich planar conjugation pathway and electron-delocalizing auxiliary chromophores on the donor segment are beneficial for increasing the optical density of the dyes. Also, it is interesting to compare GJ2 to the phenothiazine-based dye (JH305)13a reported in the literature which contains 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl unit in place of N-phenylbenzimidazole. The dye GJ2 exhibited red-shifted (18 nm) absorption when compared to JH305. This further supports the argument that for phenothiazine-based dyes, N-phenylbenzimidazole is the better auxiliary chromophore than the alkoxy-substituted phenyl units.

The absorption spectra of the dyes anchored on TiO2 was measured to understand the electronic structural changes for the dyes due to any interaction at the surface of TiO2. Generally, organic dyes exhibit red-shift in absorption due to the formation of J-type aggregates34 or large thickness of the TiO2.35 On the contrary, deprotonation of the carboxylic acid unit may cause a blue-shift.36 In the present case, all the dyes exhibited a slightly red-shifted absorption than that observed for THF solutions but were not significantly different from that of dichloromethane solutions (vide supra). The tailing trend (GJ3 < GJ4 < GJ1 < GJ2 < GJ5) closely resembled to that witnessed for the solution spectra (GJ3 < GJ4 < GJ1 < GJ5 < GJ2). However, as the thickness of the TiO2 remained common for the devices, a trend reversal observed for GJ2 and GJ5 is interesting. It suggests that aggregation is more severe in GJ5 than in GJ2. This probably is a result of aggregation inhibition by the peripheral chromophore, N-phenylbenzimidazole. It is safe to assume that aggregation of other dyes (GJ1, GJ3 and GJ4) may also be diminished due to N-phenylbenzimidazole.
We have also recorded the absorption spectra of the dyes in various solvents such as toluene (TOL), dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol (MEOH), acetonitrile (ACN) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). An absorption peak exhibiting solvent dependence is adjudged to possess charge-transfer character. As illustrated in Fig. 3 for GJ1, in toluene, all the dyes exhibited red-shifted absorption but on increasing the polarity of the solvents the charge transfer peak shifted to shorter wavelength region gradually. Most blue-shifted absorption was realized for DMF solutions. An unusual red-shift observed for DCM solutions for ionic dyes have been critically examined and found to be associated with the instant stabilization of polarizable electrons on excitation.37 Similarly, in the present dyes, the abnormal red-shift for the DCM solutions can be attributed to this phenomenon. The general negative solvatochromism exhibited by the dyes can be ascribed to the stabilization of the dyes in the ground state due to effective solvation by the polar solvents or arising of smaller dipole moments in the excited states compared to those in ground state.38
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the dye GJ1 recorded in different solvents. 
Also the dyes exhibited appreciable red-shift and blue-shift respectively in the absorption spectra on addition of TFA or triethylamine to the dye solutions in THF. It further establishes the charge-transfer nature of the longer wavelength absorption. Protonation by TFA and deprotonation by TEA are demonstrated to cause red- and blue-shifts respectively for the D–π–A organic dyes.
Electrochemical properties
To judge the feasibility of electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band (ECB) of TiO2 and regeneration of oxidized dye by accepting of electrons from the iodine/iodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte, we have evaluated the electrochemical properties of the dyes by performing cyclic voltammetric studies. All the dyes exhibited a quasi-reversible oxidation couple attributable to the removal of electron from the phenothiazine donor (Fig. 4). The redox potential is more positive than that observed for ferrocene under identical conditions. The oxidation propensity of the dyes as determined from the Eox and ΔEp values is highly dependent on the nature of the conjugation pathway. In general, the dyes (GJ2, GJ4 and GJ5) possessing elongated conjugation exhibited low oxidation potentials among the series. Despite GJ2 and GJ5 possessing similar conjugation pathway, a slight positive shift observed for the dye GJ2 is suggestive of the electron delocalization role by the N-phenylbenzimidazole unit. The oxidation potential values which correspond to the removal of electron from the HOMO of the dyes fall in the range of 1.06–1.13 V vs. NHE, while the excited state oxidation potential values which represent the energy required for the addition of electron into the LUMO of the dyes are in the range −1.22 V to −1.50 V vs. NHE. As the oxidation potentials of the dyes are more positive (Fig. 5) than I−/I3− redox potential (0.4 V vs. NHE),9c,9d,39 the regeneration of the oxidized dyes by the I−/I3− redox couple will be favorable. Also, the more negative LUMO of the dyes (Fig. 5) than the ECB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),9c,9d,40 indicates the thermodynamically allowed injection of electrons from the excited dyes to the CB of TiO2.

Theoretical investigations
In order to understand the nature of donor and acceptor orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) and the probability of charge-transfer from donor to acceptor on electronic excitation, we have performed density functional theoretical (DFT)41 computations on the dyes using B3LYP42 hybrid functional and 6-31G** basis set. The electronic distributions in the frontier molecular orbitals of the dyes along with their ground and excited state oxidation potentials are shown in Fig. 5. In general the HOMO is mainly populated over the phenothiazine unit and extended into the thiophene ring in the conjugation pathway. In case of the dyes GJ1–GJ4, it is also spread over the benzimidazole segment. However, the LUMO is mainly localized on the cyanoacrylic acid segment with slight contribution from the adjoining aromatic units. From these observations it is clearly evident that the electronic excitation from the HOMO to LUMO can cause charge migration from the donor to acceptor. However, the partial overlap of HOMO and LUMO orbitals over the thiophene unit in the conjugation pathway points the probability of intramolecular charge recombination for the dyes GJ1, GJ2, GJ4 and GJ5. But in the case of GJ3 there is a clear separation between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals which ensure an effective charge transfer. This is mainly due to the tilting between the phenothiazine and phenyl units. Thus, in all the dyes, certainly the longer wavelength absorption originates from the charge transfer from the phenothiazine-based donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. Red-shifted absorption realized for GJ2 and GJ5 is attributed to the delocalized HOMO and LUMO orbitals which increase the effective conjugation length contributing to the absorption.
Photovoltaic performance of the dyes
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (I–V) and spectral response curves of the photochemical cells fabricated using the dyes as sensitizers are shown in Fig. 6. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are listed in Table 2. In general, the benzimidazole-containing dyes showed better performance than GJ5. Among the series the highest power conversion efficiency was recorded for GJ1. Lowest efficiency exhibited by the dye GJ5 highlights the importance of the benzimidazole-based auxiliary chromophore in light-harvesting. The low efficiency of GJ5 originates from its poor photocurrent density (JSC) and smallest VOC value. It appears that the device based on GJ5 suffers from poor electron collection efficiency and facile electron recombination. The low VOC of GJ5 may be speculated to arise from the depletion of electron density in the conduction band of dye-anchored TiO2. This could arise due to the poor electron injection43 and rapid electron recombination44 of injected electrons with the electrolyte. Relatively low-lying LUMO for GJ2 and GJ5 may reduce the thermodynamic driving force for the electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2. However, the hydrophobic protection rendered by the N-phenylbenzimidazole moiety compensates for it in GJ2. This may suppress the reach of electrolyte to the dye and consequently retard the recombination of electrons in case of GJ2. But with GJ5 the reduced electron injection propensity and pronounced electron recombination minimize the electron density in the conduction band of dye-anchored TiO2 and significantly decrease the photocurrent and open circuit voltage. Overall the DSSC containing the sensitizer GJ1 displayed highest solar energy to power conversion efficiency (η = 3.66%) with the best short-circuit current (JSC = 9.09 mA cm−2) under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation. The better performance of the dyes GJ1–GJ4 over GJ5 is attributed to their relatively high molar extinction coefficients and structural protection for electron recombination.

The devices showed maximum photon-to-current conversion efficiency (Fig. 6(b)) in accordance with the absorption pattern of the dyes uses as sensitizers. For example, the high molar extinction coefficient observed for the dye GJ2 in solution absorption spectrum is matching with the promising IPCE observed for the DSSC fabricated using this dye. Thus, the improved light-harvesting ability of the dye GJ2 is mainly arising from its absorption parameters. However, the poor IPCE spectrum of GJ5 is puzzling despite it possesses appreciable absorption in the longer wavelength region. It clearly indicates that the other structural components which inhibit the dye aggregation and retard the electron recombination are essential to realize high photocurrent in DSSC. In the case of GJ2, N-phenylbenzimidazole serves dual purpose. It extends the conjugation dimension responsible for the charge-transfer transition and provides sufficient steric bulk to inhibit aggregation and retard electron recombination.
The low efficiencies of DSSC largely arise due to the involvement of two major unwanted processes: the recombination of electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 with the oxidized dyes or constituents of redox electrolyte (I3−). These two detrimental interfacial charge transfer processes affect the VOC of DSSC and in turn the overall efficiency of the DSSC. In order to understand the impact of such interfacial charge transfer processes on the efficiency of DSSC, we have performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on the devices under dark and illumination conditions. Dark evaluations are used to access the electron recombination resistance while the measurement under illumination is used to ascertain electron transfer resistance. A device possessing high electron recombination resistance and low charge transfer resistance is expected to display high efficiency. The Nyquist plots observed for DSSC under the dark conditions are displayed in Fig. 7(a). The plot displayed three overlapping semicircles. The middle larger semicircle is important as it gives the information about charge transfer process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.9a,45 The radius of this semicircle is the measure of electron recombination resistance (Rrec). The Rrec for the DSSCs assume the order GJ3 > GJ4 > GJ1 > GJ2 > GJ5 which is very similar to the VOC trend. The high Rrec observed for GJ3 and GJ4 are consistent with the non-planar conjugation pathway present in them. Twisted molecular conformations are generally believed to suppress the penetration of electrolyte across the sensitizer to reach the TiO2 surface.46 Alternatively, for the dyes GJ1 and GJ2 the presence of N-phenylbenzimidazole moiety provides the essential structural complexity to inhibit the flow of electrolyte. Overall the presence of non-planar linker and sterically demanding auxiliary chromophore in the dyes GJ3 and GJ4 is responsible for their high VOC.
The high VOC realized for the dyes GJ1–GJ4 can be explained further by considering the availability of high electron density in the CB of TiO2. More electron density will be available in the CB of TiO2 if the charge collection efficiency is good. Charge collection efficiency can be correlated with the charge transfer resistance. In order to get insights into the charge transfer resistance the Nyquist plots of the DSSC were constructed by the EIS measurements under illumination (Fig. 7(b)). Again, the middle semicircle reflects the quantum of electron transport resistance9a in the device across the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The electron transport resistances (Rct2) of the devices assume the order: GJ5 > GJ4 > GJ3 > GJ1 > GJ2 (Table 2) There are two important inferences from the Rct2 values. Firstly, the dye (GJ5) which lacks N-phenylbenzimidazole chromophore possesses distinctively large Rct2 value. It clearly suggests that the N-phenylbenzimidazole chromophore is beneficial for the charge transport. Secondly, among the N-phenylbenzimidazole containing dyes resistance for the charge transfer decreases as the planarity and electron richness of the conjugation increases. Overall the charge transfer is facilitated by the auxiliary chromophore and planar electron-rich conjugation. Thus GJ2 displays very low charge transfer resistance which may improve its charge collection efficiency in the DSSC. As expected, the DSSC with GJ2 shows high JSC and reasonable VOC.

Fig. 8 shows the Bode phase plots recorded under illumination conditions for the DSSC fabricated with the dyes. The electron life time in the CB of TiO2 deduced from these plots assume the order: GJ3 > GJ4 > GJ1 > GJ2 > GJ5 which is consistent with the observed VOC. Furthermore, among the dyes, high electron life times observed for the DSSC using GJ3 and GJ4 suggest the beneficial role of non-planar π-linker and sterically demanding auxiliary chromophores in hampering the approach of the electrolyte towards TiO2.47

Since the charge recombination is the crucial factor affecting the photovoltaic performance of these dyes, we tried to maximize the device parameters by using deoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent. The DSSC parameters obtained using various amounts of CDCA along with the dyes GJ2 and GJ5 are listed in Table 3 and the I–V and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 9. GJ2 and GJ5 were chosen for this comparative evaluation as they possessed longer wavelength absorption with high molar extinction coefficients. Also, they displayed opposite behaviors as sensitizer in DSSC. On addition of CDCA a quick increase of JSC and slight decrease of VOC (6 mV) was observed for GJ2. But, on further increasing the concentration of CDCA the JSC increased steadily along with VOC. In this way the highest efficiency (5.2%) was recorded for both 20 and 30 mM CDCA bath solutions. But for the dye GJ5 the increase in the JSC and VOC are not uniform. The JSC and VOC increased on addition of 10 mM CDCA, but they declined on further increasing the concentration of CDCA in the bath solution. Addition of CDCA normally hinders the aggregate formation at the surface of TiO2 which leads to improved electron injection efficiency and photocurrent. Also, from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 10) it is clearly evident that the JSC changes in case of GJ2 is due to the reduction in the electron transfer resistance on increasing the concentration of CDCA. But, the electron recombination resistance largely remained unaltered. This clearly suggests that the presence of N-phenylbenzimidazole units is sufficient enough to retard the electron recombination in GJ2. But for GJ5, addition of CDCA decreased the electron transfer resistance and increased the electron recombination resistance in the DSSC. This points that for GJ5-based device, CDCA is essential to inhibit the electron recombination as there is no N-phenylbenzimidazole unit in its molecular structure.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new series of phenothiazine-based dyes by integrating N-phenylbenzimidazole on the nuclear position of the phenothiazine moiety. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes were thoroughly investigated by UV-Vis and cyclic voltammetry. The dyes exhibited red-shifted absorption and more positive oxidation potentials when compared to the parent dye without N-phenylbenzimidazole group. The π-electron delocalization into the benzimidazole moiety was responsible for the red-shifted absorption and high oxidation potential of these dyes. These speculations were supported by the DFT calculations on the dyes which showed the delocalization of the HOMO orbital in the benzimidazole segment. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the dyes showed promising performance parameters. The high electron recombination resistance and prolonged electron life time for the dyes bearing N-phenylbenzimidazole was beneficial for achieving relatively high efficiency (5.2%).
