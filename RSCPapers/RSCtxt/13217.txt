    , Accepted 21st April 2022First published on 22nd April 2022AbstractThe vinylene-bridged helical perylene diimide dimer (PDI2) and its derivatives have received considerable attention for application in nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Benefitting from the large natural dipole moment and the reinforced intermolecular forces, a series of asymmetrical non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) including perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives show comparable and even-better photovoltaic performances in comparison to the symmetrical counterparts. Nevertheless, most of the asymmetrical PDI acceptors were achieved by incorporating a different functional group at the bay position. Breaking the molecular symmetry of PDI at the N position in the imide group is rarely reported. In this contribution, an asymmetrical PDI2 derivative, namely MBI-PDI2, which was constructed by the installation of a mono-benzimidazole group at one of the four imide groups, was synthesized. Using commercially purchased PM6 as an electron donor, a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.13% was achieved for the MBI-PDI2-based OSCs, which is higher than that of the parent PDI2-based ones. This result demonstrates that structural symmetry-breaking at the N position is a versatile design strategy for high-performance PDI-based NFAs.
Introduction
Perylene diimide (PDI) is one of the most important functional dyes and organic semiconductors.1–5 In the past few decades, a large library of PDI derivatives has been developed for tailored applications such as organic solar cells (OSCs),6–12 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),13–17 and organic theranostic agents.18,19 For applications in OSCs, the rigid planarity of PDIs often gives rise to the formation of large phase separations, leading to inefficient exciton diffusion/separation, and ultimately poor photovoltaic performance. Thus, a number of twisted PDI derivatives have been constructed by linking two or more PDI units directly together or with congested spacers.20–25 Based on an exceptional molecular design strategy, Nuckolls and Wang's groups independently reported an exotic series of PDI oligomers that consists of PDI panels fused together by ethylene bridges.26–28 These PDI oligomers exhibit extraordinary n-type mobilities and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in OFETs and OSCs, respectively.29–31 Since then, the PDI oligomers, especially the dimer (PDI2, Fig. 1), have emerged as field-favorite building blocks in constructing nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs).32–56 Besides the nonplanar molecular configurations, the molecular symmetry of the NFAs plays an indispensable role in the determination of photovoltaic performance.57 Research on asymmetric NFAs has been relatively overlooked even though its development could be traced back to 2010.58,59 Luckily, this unfavorable situation has changed since 2017 and advanced briskly in the past five years. Compared to the corresponding symmetrical counterparts, asymmetric NFAs may additionally exhibit enhanced natural dipole moment and stronger intermolecular binding energy, while inheriting the merits of symmetric NFAs such as molecular structure variability and good adjustability in optoelectronic properties.57 Both the larger natural dipole moment and stronger intermolecular binding energy facilitate intermolecular interaction, endowing asymmetric NFAs with comparable and even superior photovoltaic performances compared with those of the symmetrical counterparts.60–63 Most asymmetric NFAs are derived from the state-of-the-art ITIC and Y6 with an acceptor–donor–acceptor configuration,64,65 and only a few asymmetric PDI-based NFAs have been reported.37,56,66–75 Moreover, most of the asymmetrical PDI acceptors were achieved by the incorporation of a different functional group at the bay position. Breaking the molecular symmetry of PDI at the N position in the imide group is rarely reported.66–80 We propose a hypothesis that structural symmetry-breaking at the N position of PDI2 can boost the photovoltaic performances in line with those of symmetry-breaking at the bay region. To validate this hypothesis, in this contribution, an asymmetrical PDI2 acceptor, namely MBI-PDI2, was developed by the installation of a mono-benzimidazole group at one of the four imide groups (Fig. 1). The photovoltaic performances of MBI-PDI2 as well as the parent PDI2 were explored using commercially available PM6 as an electron donor. A best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.13% was achieved for the MBI-PDI2-based OSCs, which is higher than that of the parent PDI2-based ones (6.15%).

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic procedures of MBI-PDI2 are presented in Scheme 1 and Schemes S1–S4 (ESI†). Compounds 1 and 3 were synthesized according to previous literature reports.29,81 It was found that bromination of 1 using N-bromosucinimide (NBS) in concentrated sulfuric acid gave two regioisomers 2 and 2′. Subsequently, the isomeric mixtures underwent Stille cross-coupling reaction with 3 yielding the corresponding ethylene-bridged PDI dimers 4 and 4′. The conversion of 4/4′ to the exclusive product 5 was achieved by Mallory photocyclization. The condensation of compound 5 and 1,2-diaminobenzene in propanoic acid at room temperature afforded the target compound MBI-PDI2 in a yield of 51%. In similarity to other asymmetrical benzimidazole-modified PDIs,82–85MBI-PDI2 may have an isomer as shown in Scheme S4 (ESI†). The synthetic details of all intermediates and target molecules are illustrated in the ESI† (Schemes S1–S4), and the structures were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S7–17, ESI†). To explore the thermal properties of MBI-PDI2 (Fig. S1, ESI†), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere. The decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 390 °C illustrates that MBI-PDI2 possesses good thermal stability.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the chemical geometry structures as well as the molecular frontier orbitals of MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 at the PBEPBE/6-31G(d) level. The alkyl side chain was replaced with a methyl group to simplify the calculation. As shown in Fig. 2, MBI-PDI2 has an X-shaped configuration and the dihedral angle is 23.9°, in similarity to that of the parent PDI2 (24.7°), which can help to suppress excessive self-aggregation of the molecule. The frontier molecular orbital profiles as well as the calculated molecular orbital energy levels of MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The two molecules show obvious differences in the frontier orbital distributions. For PDI2, both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are well-distributed on the whole molecular skeleton owing to the symmetrical configuration. Interestingly, in the case of MBI-PDI2, the HOMO is mainly distributed on the benzimidazole-containing PDI subunit, and the contribution of the other PDI panel is negligible. The LUMO is located on the PDI2 moiety with negligible contribution from the benzimidazole unit.

Optoelectronic properties
The optoelectronic properties of the MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 were investigated using the UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammograms (CVs). As shown in Fig. 3a, in the film state, MBI-PDI2 shows broad absorptions in the range of 350 to 700 nm, and it exhibits an obvious red-shift when compared with PDI2, which may be attributed to the conjugation expansion with the condensation of benzimidazole. The molar extinction coefficients of the long-wavelength absorption maxima were established to be 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 1.8 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for MBI-PDI2 and PDI2, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). The optical band gap calculated from the onset of absorption is summarized in Table 1, which is consistent well with the DFT calculations.

The electrochemical properties of MBI-PDI2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), MBI-PDI2 shows two reversible and two quasi-reversible reduction waves, while no oxidation waves were observed upon an anodic scan up to 2.00 V. The LUMO level of MBI-PDI2 was obtained to be −3.94 eV, and the HOMO level was calculated to be −6.01 eV. The HOMO/LUMO levels of PDI2 were obtained according to our group's published literature.36 These results are illustrated in Table 1 and well-matched with the theoretical calculations. As displayed in Fig. 3b, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 possess well-aligned energy levels with that of PM6, indicating that PM6 is a suitable electron donor for fabricating the MBI-PDI2-based OSC devices.
OSC device performance
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSC devices were fabricated using MBI-PDI2 or PDI2 as the electron acceptor and PM6 as the electron donor, with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:MBI-PDI2/MoO3/Ag. The detailed device optimization and fabrication procedures are presented in Fig. S5 and Table S1–S3 (ESI†). The detailed photovoltaic parameters and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4a. MBI-PDI2-based devices have a slightly lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) than those of PDI2-based ones, which may be ascribed to the relatively smaller energy offset of the HOMO (donor)–LUMO (acceptor). Due to higher JSC and fill factor (FF), MBI-PDI2-based devices show a higher PCE of 7.13% than PDI2 (6.15%). This result demonstrates that structural symmetry-breaking at the N position could improve the device performance.

In order to gain a better insight into the photon response of OSCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were measured and shown in Fig. 4b. Both the devices showed a broad photoresponse region from 300 to 700 nm, which corresponds to the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor. It is noteworthy that the EQE value of the MBI-PDI2 is higher than that of PDI2 ranging from 400 nm to 650 nm. Moreover, the calculated JSC values integrating from the EQE spectra for MBI-PDI2 and PDI2-based devices were 11.18 and 9.92 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well-matched with the corresponding J–V measurements data.
To get insight into the carrier recombination kinetics in the OSCs, we investigate the dependence of VOC and JSC on light intensity (Plight). As shown in Fig. 5a, the dependence of VOC on Plight was fit to the equation of VOC ∝ nkT/qln (Plight). The slope being close to 1 kT/q suggests that the dominating mechanism is bimolecular recombination, while it approaching 2 kT/q illustrates that trap-assisted recombination dominates in the devices. Both the slopes of MBI-PDI2 and PDI2-based OSCs are close to 1 kT/q, indicating that bimolecular recombination is dominant. The slightly smaller n value of MBI-PDI2 means a suppressed trap-assisted recombination, which agrees with the higher JSC and FF of the optimized devices. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5b, the JSC as a function of illuminated light intensity is fit to a power-law relation JSC ∝ PSlight. In principle, it has negligible bimolecular recombination in the device if S is equal to or approximates to 1. The S values of MBI-PDI2- and PDI2-based devices are around 0.9, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination, which is beneficial for achieving high JSC and FF.

To gain further insight into the charge transfer kinetics of the devices, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was employed to explore the carrier transport properties of the blends (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The electron-only and hole-only devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/ZnO/PM6:MBI-PDI2(PDI2)/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:MBI-PDI2 (PDI2)/MoO3/Ag. The MBI-PDI2-based devices showed higher electron and hole mobilities than those of PDI2-based ones, contributing to higher JSC. Moreover, more balanced charge transport was observed in the MBI-PDI2-based device, which might be conducive to the superior FF.

To further understand the exciton dissociation process, the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated. The charge separation, transportation, and extraction efficiencies are determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat (Jph/Jsat), where Jsat refers to the saturation photocurrent density. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the Jph/Jsat values are 82.18% and 88.38% for the PM6:PDI2 and PM6:MBI-PDI2, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat ratio of the PM6:MBI-PDI2 devices showed a better exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection probability, which is beneficial to improving JSC.
The surface morphologies of the PM6:MBI-PDI2 and PM6:PDI2 blends were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 7, the PM6:MBI-PDI2 blend film shows a larger root-mean-square surface roughness (RMS) value of 3.02 nm compared to that of PM6:PDI2 (RMS = 1.51 nm). The larger RMS value indicates an increased contact area between the active layer and interfacial electrode, which is favorable to charge collection.86,87 Moreover, the phase images indicated that the PM6:MBI-PDI2 blends possessed more favorable phase separation.

Conclusions
In summary, an asymmetrical PDI2 acceptor, namely MBI-PDI2, was designed and synthesized by the installation of a mono-benzimidazole group at one of the four imide groups. The optoelectronic properties of MBI-PDI2 and symmetrical PDI2-based OSCs were studied, and their photovoltaic performances have been investigated using commercially purchased PM6 as the electron donor. MBI-PDI2-based devices exhibit superior photovoltaic performance with the best PCE of 7.13%, a JSC of 11.94 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.938 V, and an FF of 63.60%. This result demonstrates that structural symmetry-breaking at the N position is a versatile design strategy for high-performance PDI-based NFAs.
