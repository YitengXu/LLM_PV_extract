    , Accepted 11th October 2019First published on 11th October 2019AbstractAll-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Br, Cl, I) have been considered as promising candidates for developing high-performance, flexible and lightweight optoelectronic devices due to their high absorption coefficient, mechanical durability, low-temperature synthesis ability and stable physiochemical properties. However, the fabrication of pinhole-free, large-scale inorganic perovskite films is still a great challenge, because it is limited by strong chemical bonds and really low solubility, impeding their application in flexible solar cells, photodetectors and light emitting diodes. In this paper, a vacuum-filtration method to deposit large-scale, compact all-inorganic perovskite films from nanosheet suspensions on arbitrary porous substrates, which allows control of the uniformity and thickness of the perovskite films, is reported. The performance of the fabricated flexible-photodetectors was greatly improved by adding a proper amount of carbon nanotube (CNT) additive, which could maintain the low dark current density and increase the photo-responsivity by suppressing the photocarrier recombination. The improved photodetectors showed a large on/off ratio of >1 × 104, and a fast rise/decay time of 52/14 ms. These flexible photodetectors demonstrated excellent mechanical bending capabilities with retained performance after 1000 bending cycles. This deposition method could provide a universal route for preparing inorganic material films for fundamental studies and practical applications.
Introduction
Flexible photodetectors have attracted more and more attention for their potential applications in optical detection,1–5 information communication6 and large displays.7 The outstanding physical properties of all the inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Br, Cl, I), such as high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and lifetime, and its mechanical durability, low temperature process show great potential for applications with flexible photodetectors.8–13,46 Inorganic perovskites have also been found to have a high chemical stability against heat and humidity, together with a better device stability because of weaker ion migrations compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs).14–21 The inorganic perovskite flexible photodetectors require the fabrication of high-quality uniform films with a smooth surface and less pinholes in the thin layers or on flexible substrates. However, inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3, X = Br, Cl, I) materials intrinsically possess much stronger chemical bonds and inorganic characteristics, thus increasing the difficulty of forming pinhole-free film by the traditional spin-coating/drop-casting process, which is similar to the other inorganic optoelectronic materials.11,22–26 To date, uniform inorganic perovskites films are derived from high cost vacuum-deposition and a two-step conversion method or molecular assisted spin-coating with limited small areas.11,22,26–29 Tong et al. created dual-phase CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 thin films using a physical vapor deposition process at a high temperature of more than 130 °C.44 Deng et al. demonstrated an all-sprayed processable method to achieve perovskite/MXene-based photodetector arrays, yet the performance still needs to be improved.45 In reality, large-scale, inorganic perovskite films prepared by low temperature solution processing are often restricted by their solution wetting behavior, solvent flow dynamics and solvent evaporation rates over the entire substrates either in spin-coating or the doctor blading process, where cracks or pinholes could form to degrade the uniformity, even giving discontinuous films.28,29 Therefore, developing a low-cost, reproducible method to deposit the large-scale inorganic perovskite films with controlled thickness on the flexible substrates is highly desirable for the preparation of high-performance perovskite photodetectors.
In this paper, a vacuum-filtration method to produce large-scale continuous inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) film directly on flexible porous substrates in one step, is reported. Driven by the vacuum through the pores of the substrates, wetting behavior whether with hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials is identical, leading to a large-scale crack/pinhole-free film. Large-area flexible photodetector arrays were fabricated based on such continuous polycrystalline CsPbBr3 films. By using CNTs to construct additional conductive paths, the performance of the CsPbBr3 photodetector has been significantly improved, showing a large on/off ratio of >1 × 104 and fast rise/decay times of 52 ms and 14 ms, respectively. The photoresponsivity (∼0.02 A W−1) is comparable to that of other CsPbBr3 photodetectors on rigid substrates. This flexible photodetector exhibits excellent stability with retained performance even after bending for 1000 cycles or more. This is the first time that high-quality and uniform polycrystalline CsPbBr3 films over a wafer-scale substrate with thickness tunability using a one-step vacuum-filtration method have been achieved. This method will be applicable to other hybrid/inorganic perovskites and other inorganic materials, developing into a universal method for obtaining high-quality and uniformly continuous films.
Results and discussion
The vacuum filtration of the CsPbBr3 film is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Both dispersion preparation and film formation take place in an ambient environment. Prior to producing the film, CsPbBr3 precursor was crystallized from CsBr and PbBr2 in DMSO and toluene at a molar ratio of 2:1. With octadecylamine acid solution as surfactant, the CsPbBr3 nanocrystal precursor was formed and dispersed in toluene using an ultrasonic probe (see Synthesis of materials). Then, the CsPbBr3 dispersion was evenly drop casted onto the vacuum filtration membranes, and under the capillary effects from the porous surface it quickly spread over the whole membrane. Driven by the vacuum pressure, the dispersion tunnels through the pores of the membrane as the solvent rapidly evaporated and formed into a thin layer of CsPbBr3 film. The CsPbBr3 dispersion exhibited excellent wetting behavior over the porous surface of the membrane, and followed by simultaneous vacuum extraction from the evenly distributed pores, the resultant film was uniform and compact. The thickness of the CsPbBr3 films could be controlled by the concentration and volume of the dispersion. Three types of vacuum filtration membranes were used: hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, 0.2 μm pores), hydrophilic Nylon 6 (semi-crystalline polyamide, 0.2 μm) and mixed cellulose ester (MCE, 0.2 μm). On either the hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes, the CsPbBr3 dispersion could wet the porous surface very well, and formed a continuous CsPbBr3 layer on all the PVDF, Nylon 6 and MCE membranes (∼cm scale) after vacuum filtration (Fig. 1b). Typical SEM images of the as-prepared films on the PVDF membrane further confirmed that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were stacked tightly with each other, and were shown to be pin-hole free at magnifications as high as 2500 and 15000 times (Fig. 1c and d). This suggested that driven by vacuum pressure, a large-scale continuous CsPbBr3 film could be formed on either hydrophobic or hydrophilic porous membranes.

Uniformity and continuity are two important features for thin films when fabricating electronic devices on them over a large area. Compared with traditional methods for producing CsPbBr3 films, such as spin-coating, drop-casting and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), use of vacuum filtration was superior in terms of uniformity and continuity. As shown in Fig. 2, CsPbBr3 films fabricated by spin-coating, drop-casting and CVD were not continuous at all, full of pinholes, cracks and with large areas which were uncovered regions. This was mainly due to the mismatch wetting between suspension and substrates, and any occasionally abrupt change on them will give defects in the film. In addition, for solution processing methods, there were centrifugal forces in spin-coating and in the “coffee ring” drying mode in drop-casting, which tended to push the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals towards the edge of the substrates. This means that using spin-coating and drop-casting it was very hard to prepare uniform films. Whereas for vacuum filtration of perovskite films on porous substrates, the vacuum force applied for perovskite dispersion through the evenly distributed pores dominated the film formation. This method shows that it was highly reproducible and applicable for fabricating both uniform and compact, inorganic and hybrid perovskite films. The CVD or vapor transport was also commonly used in synthesizing CsPbBr3 films. It involved a few steps: CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were firstly nucleated at certain sites, and then grew vertically and horizontally depending on the designated substrates, and yet it was difficult for them to become uniform and continuous films. In addition, the CVD method required high temperatures (>500 °C) and a long-time for processing (hours). In contrast, the vacuum filtration procedure was superfast (several seconds), which was much shorter than any other solution processing or CVD method.30 Therefore, compared to these three traditional methods for producing perovskite films, the vacuum filtration method was very feasible and highly reproducible for preparing uniform and continuous perovskite films at the centimeter scale.

Results of a comprehensive study of the structure of CsPbBr3 compact film is shown in Fig. 3. First its crystal structure was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Fig. 3a). Two sharp and strong diffraction peaks were observed at 15.1° and 30.7°, respectively, which could be assigned to the (100) and (200) planes of monoclinic CsPbBr3 crystalline structure, respectively. Then, its crystalline structure was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3b, the top surface of an individual CsPbBr3 nanocrystal was a rectangle with each edges of the domain being in the range of 1–3 μm. The high resolution TEM image showed lattice spacings of ∼0.58 nm, which corresponded to the (100) and (010) lattice planes of the monoclinic CsPbBr3 crystal (a = 0.58 nm, b = 0.58 nm, c = 0.59 nm). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results verified the same crystal lattice (Fig. S1, ESI†). Also, elemental mapping of this nanocrystal in TEM was conducted to determine its chemical composition and distribution (Fig. 3c). Only three elements (cesium, lead and bromine) were observed and uniformly distributed over this nanocrystal. The corresponding spectrum and semi-quantification showed that the atomic ratio of Cs, Pb, Br was about 1:1:3 (22.04:20.68:57.28), which was consistent with the theoretical value of the CsPbBr3 crystals. Both the XRD and TEM results indicated that the CsPbBr3 compact film fabricated by the vacuum filtration method was highly oriented and crystalline.

To enable the as-fabricated CsPbBr3 nanocrystal compact film to be used as high-performance photodetectors, CNTs were intensively introduced to improve the separation efficiency of the photoinduced carriers. To enable a uniform CsPbBr3/CNT dispersion, an ultrasonic probe was used to mix the CNTs into CsPbBr3 precipitation dispersion (see Synthesis of materials). The as-prepared dispersion was immediately used to prepare CsPbBr3/CNT compact hybrid film by vacuum filtration. The SEM image (Fig. 4a) clearly confirmed the existence of CNTs in the hybrid film, which connected several CsPbBr3 nanocrystals across several domains. In a SEM image with lower magnification (Fig. S2, ESI†), CNTs were observed to be randomly distributed with no decrease to the uniformity and continuity of the original CsPbBr3 film. From structure characterization, the unchanged PXRD peaks further showed that the introduction of CNTs did not affect the crystallization of CsPbBr3 and orientation of the resultant film (Fig. 4b). Light absorption and photoillumination behavior were studied next. The UV-vis spectrum of the CsPbBr3 film had an absorption peak at about 507 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). Under the excitation of UV light, the photoluminescence (PL) of CsPbBr3 film and CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film was measured and the results are compared in Fig. 4c. With the addition of CNTs, the luminance peak of the hybrid film showed a red shift of 4 cm−1 and an obvious quenching of the luminance intensity. This was probably caused by the charge transfers of the photo-induced electrons through the CNTs, which decreased the recombination of electrons and holes.6 This indicated that by adding CNTs into the CsPbBr3 film, more photons would be re-radiated in the hybrid film upon light excitation, and thus, exhibiting a higher photocurrent.

Successful vacuum filtration of uniform and continuous CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film immediately allowed the fabrication of large-area photodetector arrays (Fig. 5a). After preparing them on PVDF substrates, 50 nm of chromium (Cr) were thermally evaporated as electrode contacts using a shadow mask. The interdigital channel of photodetector arrays was 30 μm in length and 500 μm in width. Considering the large channel dimension, a little variation in perovskite domain size tuning by the concentration of surfactants may not affect the photodetector performance (Fig. S4, ESI†). Instead, dependences on the amount of CNTs mixed in the hybrid film were first optimized. As shown in Fig. 5b, with increasing quantities of CNTs in the hybrid film, the channel of photodetectors gradually became conductive. When adding more than 10 μL CNTs in the CsPbBr3 dispersion to fabricate the photodetector, there was an abrupt increase in the dark current of >two orders of magnitude. To maintain a low dark current and power consumption of the as-fabricated photodetectors, the amount of CNTs in the hybrid film should be no more than 10 μL in this particular case. Under illumination of 532 nm light at a power of 1.46 mW, when 5 and 10 μL CNTs were added in to the CsPbBr3 dispersion, the photocurrents of both increased, and the latter one was more than one order of magnitude larger than the photocurrent of the plain CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 5c). Therefore, for such a CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film, there was an optimum amount of CNTs (here, 10 μL) that could be mixed in a CsPbBr3 film that could balance the dark and photocurrent very well, achieving a larger on/off ratio in the photodetector.

Typical I–V curves of photodetectors based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film obtained using various light illumination intensities of the 532 nm laser are shown in Fig. 5d. The dark current of the photodetector was maintained as low as 0.1 nA after with blending the CNTs. With increasing light illumination power, the photocurrent exhibited a strong positive dependence because more photocarriers were generated. At the illumination power of 8.85 mW, the photocurrent reached more than 1 μA, which lead to a large on/off ratio of >104 at the bias of 3 V (logarithmic I–V curves sweeping from −5 V to 5 V are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). The on/off ratio is a very important parameter for the photodetector, as it affects signal/information processing. It was almost three orders of magnitude larger than that of previously reported inorganic perovskite photodetectors doped with carbon-based materials.6,31,32 The detectivity of the devices was calculated using the equation D* = R/((A/2 × e × Idark)1/2), where A is the effective area of illumination, e is the unit charge of 1.62 × 10−19 C and R is the responsivity of the device. The detectivity of our devices was calculated to be about 3 × 108 Jones at the incident power of 8.85 mW. The photoswitching behavior of the as-fabricated photodetector when the 532 nm laser was turned on and off alternatively was examined (Fig. 5e). Upon turning on the laser, the current sharply increased and then continued increasing at a slower speed. This could be explained by the long time of transportation of the photocarriers across the large channel of photodetectors. When the light was off, the current fell immediately. The periodic current change was very stable when the light was on and off at various intensities, suggesting that it had an excellent working stability (Fig. S6, ESI†). Under the pulse laser, the rise and decay time were measured as 52 ms and 14 ms, respectively (Fig. 5f) and were shorter than those (73 ms and 19 ms) for the detectors without CNTs (Fig. S7, ESI†), which indicated that the photoinduced carriers had a faster separation speed. The response speed of the photodetector based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film could be further improved with a shorter channel length and a thinner perovskite film. The photoresponsivity and external quantum efficiency as a function of illumination power were calculated, and the results are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and which were comparable to most reported values of photodetectors based on composite or plane inorganic perovskites.3,29,33–43
The photodetector based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film fabricated on porous membranes was ultra-flexible. It was attached on to an automated bending machine, and the cyclic stability of photoswitching behavior upon switching a light on and off, was tested (Fig. 6a). After bending up to 150° for 1000 cycles, the as-fabricated photodetector showed almost the same photo- and dark-current with an immediate response, as in its original state (Fig. 6b). In addition, the CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film can also be transferred onto other substrates, such as an elastomer, which lead to a stretchable photodetector. As shown in Fig. 6c, the CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid films were peeled off onto elastomer substrates, such as styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS), and contact electrodes were deposited using a shadow mask to fabricate the photodetectors. With the help of CNTs to bridge the cracked domains (Fig. 6d), there is great potential to produce a stretchable photodetector based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film.

Conclusions
In this work, a new vacuum-driven method to produce large-area continuous inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films on flexible porous substrates is presented. Because of the unique way that the driving force is applied, which is through the pores of the membranes, the wetting behavior of the substrates does not affect the uniformity and continuity of the resultant films. The performance of photodetectors based on the CsPbBr3 films prepared in this way is significantly improved upon introducing CNTs, which can effectively suppress the recombination of the excited charge carriers. The optimized photodetectors showed a superior switching ratio of more than 104, a fast rise/decay time of 52/14 ms and excellent stability, plus the retention of performance even after 1000 bending cycles. This vacuum filtration method should be a universal method to achieve the massive production of all types of perovskite films and other inorganic materials with high uniformity and continuity for high performance optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Cesium bromide (99.999%), and lead bromide (99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Octadecylamine was purchased from Aladdin.
Synthesis of materials
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal dispersions were conducted under atmospheric conditions. The precursor was prepared by dissolving 2 mmol CsBr and 1 mmol PbBr2 in 15 mL of DMSO. The surfactant was prepared by dissolving 2 g of octadecylamine in 10 mL of acetic acid. Next, 100 μL of the precursor and 500 μL of the surfactant were mixed and stirred for 2 min. Then 10 mL of toluene was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. After the perovskites had crystallized from the solution, precipitation was achieved by centrifugation followed by washing with toluene. The final dispersion was in 4 mL of toluene which was then vacuum-filtrated onto a PVDF/Nylon6/MCE membrane (with 0.2 μm pores) to produce compact films. To obtain CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film, 4.2 mg of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was first dispersed into 10 mL of toluene using an ultrasonic probe for 5 h. Then, 4 mL of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystal dispersion was mixed with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 μL of the as-prepared MWCNT dispersion before vacuum filtration. The same precursor dispersion was applied for spin-coating (2000 rpm for 30 s) and drop-casting on SiO2/Si substrates.
Another control sample of CsPbBr3 was synthesized using low-pressure CVD in a three-zone tube furnace. The precursors (a mixture of CsBr (1 mmol) and PbBr2 (0.5 mmol) powders) were placed in the first zone and maintained at 550 °C for 50 min. The pressure was kept at 1000 Pa under the flow of 350 sccm Ar and 50 sccm H2 (99.999%). The target substrates of SiO2/Si were placed downstream in the third zone at 411–461 °C.
Characterization of materials
The morphologies of the films were observed using an optical microscope (Leica DM2700 M) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU8010). The PXRD patterns were collected using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-7000). The TEM images were collected using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Talos F200s, with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV). Elemental mapping was performed using a TEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The PL spectrum was measured on a spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments FS5). The UV-vis spectrum was measured on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600).
Fabrication of photodetectors
The CsPbBr3/CNT compact film was prepared on PVDF membrane (with 0.2 μm pores) using vacuum filtration. The 50 nm chromium contact electrodes were thermally vacuum-evaporated onto the perovskite film using a metal shadow mask. The interdigital channel of the photodetector was 30 μm in length and 500 μm width. The I–V characteristics of the photodetectors were determined using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200) under the illumination of a 532 nm laser. The cycling test was operated using a digitally controlled stretching stage (Custom-made by JiangYunGuangDian).

 	Fig. 1  Uniform and compact perovskite film formed by a vacuum filtration method. (a) A schematic illustration of the vacuum-driven method used to produce perovskite films. Perovskite precipitates wet the porous surface of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes very well and, driven by the vacuum pressure, they form into a uniform and compact film. (b) Photographs of such CsPbBr3 thin films on PVDF, Nylon 6 and MCE membranes. (c and d) SEM images of the CsPbBr3 compact films at lower (c) and higher (d) magnifications.	 

 	Fig. 2  Morphology comparison of CsPbBr3 films produced with different methods. Over-view optical images (left) and the corresponding SEM images (right) of CsPbBr3 films produced via CVD (a and b), spin-coating (c and d) and drop-casting (e and f) methods, showing areas full of pinholes (red arrows) or uncovered regions (yellow arrows).	 

 	Fig. 3  Structural characterization of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals: (a) XRD spectrum of the CsPbBr3 compact film and the standard spectra of CsPbBr3; (b) TEM and HRTEM images of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystal; and (c) the corresponding EDX elemental mapping and spectrum, confirming that the ratio of Cs, Pb and Br atoms is 1:1:3.	 

 	Fig. 4  Morphology and crystal structure characterization of the CsPbBr3/CNT films. (a) SEM image of CsPbBr3/CNT compact films; (b) XRD spectra of CsPbBr3/CNT compact films; and (c) PL spectra of CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/CNT compact films.	 

 	Fig. 5  Performances of photodetectors based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film. (a) A schematic illustration of photodetector arrays on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film. (b) Dark logarithmic I–V curves of photodetectors with different amounts of CNTs. (c) Logarithmic I–V curves of the photodetectors with 5 μL and 10 μL of CNTs tested in the dark and under 532 nm light illumination (1.46 mW). (d) Logarithmic I–V curves of the optimized photodetector tested in the dark and under various power intensities of the 532 nm laser. (e) Photoswitching behavior of the photodetector at a frequency of 4 Hz. (f) Corresponding magnified plots of one response cycle, showing that the rise and decay times are 52 ms and 14 ms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  Flexibility of photodetectors based on CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film. (a) Photographs of the photodetectors under different bending angles. (b) I–t curves of the photodetector before and after 1000 bending-recovery cycles up to 150°. (c) Photograph of CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid film on SEBS elastomer. (d) Optical image of the channels of the as-fabricated photodetector on SEBS elastomer under 15% strain.
