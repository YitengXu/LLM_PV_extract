    , Accepted 6th December 2019First published on 9th December 2019AbstractGaining deep insight into the operative mechanism of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices made of perylene-diimide (PDI) electron acceptors is challenging. Herein we perform a comparative study of three different solution-processable PDI-based heterojunctions for identifying the parameters limiting their OPV device performance. In all three systems the PTB7-Th polymer serves as the electron donor mixed with one of the three derivatives of the EP-PDI monomer, and the C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 dimers. The obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these PTB7-Th:PDI systems is PCEEP-PDI = 3.65%, PCEC6-PDI2 = 5.36%, and PCEBG-PDI2 = 4.12%. Despite the existing major differences in the molecular structure of the PDI acceptors the electron transport properties of all three PTB7-Th:PDI layers remain in the same order of ∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobility is found to have an activation energy close to ∼10kT thereby reflecting a high content of physical disorder in the three PDI acceptors. The endemic characteristic of trap-limited charge transport in PDI-based OPV layers is verified by (i) the dependence of open-circuit voltage on light intensity and (ii) the transient photovoltage characterization of the PTB7-Th:PDI devices. Based on GIWAXS measurements, the size of the well-ordered electron transporting domains in the OPV layers is between 4.0 and 6.8 nm, yet no evidence for PDI nanograin morphology features of the PDI multiadducts is found by scanning electron microscopy imaging. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that all three PDI derivatives form emissive excimer-like states in the solid state, albeit with a different excimer stabilization energy. The losses induced by charge trapping are found to be increased in PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2, that is the derivative exhibiting the most stabilized excimer state and the smallest domain size. The optimum device efficiency of the C6-PDI2 heterojunction is attributed to its capability to form medium-sized electron transporting domains that are less disconnected by traps of disordered C6-PDI2 dimers. These findings signify the importance for PDI-dimer electron acceptors to maintain a three-dimensional configuration when used in OPV layers.
Introduction
In recent years intensive research efforts have been undertaken for the synthesis of high-performance electron deficient small organic molecules and π-conjugated polymeric structures that can be used as electron accepting components in organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.1–3 Impressively, during a short time period a wide range of efficient OPV device platforms has been realized whereby no fullerene derivatives are used as electron acceptor components in the bulk heterojunction of the OPV device. Nowadays fullerene-free organic solar cells deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 16.02%, matching or even exceeding the PCE performance of their fullerene-based analogues.4
In this context perylene diimides (PDIs) have surfaced again as promising electron acceptors in fullerene-free OPVs.5 The superior chemical stability and strong light-absorbing properties of PDI derivatives, and their adaptability in a broad range of solution-processing protocols offer a tremendous opportunity to enable the low-cost fabrication of highly-efficient OPV systems.6 Yet, one of the major bottlenecks that limit PDI-based OPVs in the long-term is the tendency of the disk-shaped PDI unit to undergo aggregation via π–π columnar stacking.7,8 Photo-association of PDI molecules in the PDI aggregates leads to losses in the photon energy initially absorbed by the OPV layer due to the stabilization of PDI excitons to stable excimer species.7,9–11 The remedy applied for suppressing intermolecular interactions in the solid-state is to utilize PDI dimers with twisted configuration, so that π–π stacking can be stereochemically hindered.12,13 Other approaches aimed to the development of PDI multi-adducts with bridged PDI monomers14 or with three-dimensional scaffold configurations.15–17 It was proposed that PDI multiadduct electron acceptors can minimize the intermolecular interactions between PDI species.18 Nonetheless, the PCEs of PDI-based OPV systems remain limited to 9–10%, even when PDI multiadducts are used.19–22
In this work, we aim to identify the actual parameters responsible for the low performance of three PDI-based model heterojunctions developed by a solution processing protocol. Our comparative study is performed when the PTB7-Th electron donor is used as the polymeric matrix in which three different PDI derivatives are tested as the electron acceptors; we compare PDI OPV devices developed by (a) the EP-PDI monoadduct, (b) the C6-PDI2 dimer that is capable to adapt a twisted configuration through a carbon–carbon covalent bond between its monomer units, and (c) the BG-PDI2 dimer in which a thiophene moiety serves as the conjugated bridge-core between its monomer units.
Despite the major differences in the molecular structure of the three PDI acceptors we find that the electron transport properties of the PTB7-Th:PDI heterojunctions are invariant to the monomer- or dimer-like nature of the electron acceptor used, remaining in the order of ∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which contradicts the expectation of fullerene-like electron mobility when PDI multiadducts are used. Interestingly, like EP-PDI, the two derivatives of C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 form PDI excimer-like states in the solid state. Through a systematic study with the use of a broad range of experimental techniques, we demonstrate that the large differences observed in the PCE response of the three PTB7-Th:PDI systems arise due to the different magnitude of non-geminate recombination losses. Our work brings forward an observation that has hitherto remained neglected. Even when PDI multiadduct derivatives are used as electron acceptors, (i) the physical disorder of the multiadduct derivatives in the OPV photoactive layer induces trap-limited charge recombination losses and (ii) the formation of stable PDI excimers is not prevented. These findings provide useful guidelines for designing next-generation PDI electron acceptors.
Results and discussion
Materials

Fig. 1a presents the chemical structures of the materials used in this study. The frontier orbital alignment of the three PTB7-Th:PDI bulk heterojunction systems9,18,23 is illustrated in Fig. 1b, together with the work function levels of the electrode contacts used for the fabrication of the corresponding inverted OPV devices. Fig. 1c displays the normalized absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:PDI photoactive layers. All three blend films absorb light in a broad spectral range between 400 and 800 nm, exhibiting comparable absorptance (1 − T) values when losses due to reflection are considered to vanish (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Solar cell characterization

Fig. 2a presents the EQE spectra of OPV devices with PTB7-Th:PDI photoactive layers when optimum amounts of the 1,8-di-iodooctane (DIO) additive were used as the processing agent, and when the thickness of each photoactive layer was optimized to 80–90 nm.

In agreement with the obtained UV-Vis spectra, the EQE spectra of the PTB7-Th:PDI OPV devices exhibit efficient photocurrent generation across the whole spectral range between 400 and 800 nm. Time-integrated photoluminescence (PL) characterization experiments (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†) confirm the quantitative quenching of the PDI excimer state and the PTB7-Th exciton, with respect to the PL signal of PDI-only and PTB7-Th-only reference films.
The solar cell performance of the PTB7-Th:PDI devices (Table S1, ESI†) was evaluated under simulated solar light illumination conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 2b presents the obtained photo J–V curves, and Table 1 reports the main device metrics. For all three material combinations, the fill factor (FF) parameter remains lower than 60%. Despite the lower VOC of the PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 system, its PCE is higher than that of the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 devices, mainly due to a higher JSC. Overall, the best performance is delivered by the device with the photoactive layer of the C6-PDI2 acceptor; that is the PDI derivative capable to adopt a twisted configuration through a carbon–carbon covalent bond between its monomer units. The same system exhibited a nearly linear dependence of the JSC parameter upon increasing the intensity of simulated solar light (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Instead, deviations from linearity were found in the JSC-dependence of the devices with PTB7-Th:EP-PDI and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 photoactive layers. In conjunction with the findings to be presented below, we interpret the observed deviation from linearity as a result of charge recombination losses.24

In order to better understand the variations in the JSC parameter of the three different PDI-based OPV systems, the free charge carrier generation efficiency was determined by studying the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff).25 Here, Jph corresponds to the difference between the current density under illumination (JL) and the dark current density (JD), whereas Pdiss = Jph/Jsat is defined as the charge dissociation probability and Jsat is the saturation current density. The Jsat values were extracted from Fig. 3, when Jph enters the saturation current regime. As shown in Fig. 3, under short-circuit conditions the calculated Pdiss values are Pdiss = 58.2% for PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, Pdiss = 88.1% for PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2, and Pdiss = 85.8% for PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2. The highest Pdiss is obtained by the C6-PDI2 composite indicating an optimized charge carrier generation in this combination. Considering the absorptance values of the three photoactive layers and the different JSC dependence of their devices on light intensity, we attribute the observed differences in JSC to inefficient charge generation.

Charge transport properties
The charge transport properties of the three photoactive layers were studied by deriving the zero-field carrier mobility based on dark J–V measurements performed for electron-only and hole-only devices. The obtained dark J–V curves were fitted by a modified Mott–Gurney equation that considered the Poole–Frenkel effect (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†).26 The overview of the deduced carrier mobilities values, both for electrons (μe) and holes (μh), is reported in Table 2. The obtained room-temperature μh values in the OPV systems developed by the PDI dimer adducts are found improved, suggesting an optimized molecular packing of the PTB7-Th matrix in the photoactive layers of these devices. Notably, the room-temperature μe values for all three OPV composites remain in the order of ∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. A careful inspection of the obtained μe values reported in Table 2 and Table S2 (ESI†) reveals that by replacing EP-PDI with C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2, the electron mobility is increased only by a factor of 2 and 2.5, respectively. Despite the observed increase of electron mobility in comparison to the system made of the EP-PDI monomer, electron mobilities remain low as compared to those of the other fullerene and non-fullerene based OPV blends.27,28 This suggests that PDI multiadducts are unable to eliminate the detrimental charge trapping effects that are typically seen when PDI monomers are used.29

In order to disclose the origin of this disparity, we first examined the photophysical properties of the three PDI derivatives in dilute solution and in the solid-state. Then, the film morphology and the molecular packing of components in the blend films were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization experiments.
Excimer stabilization of perylene diimide derivatives and structural characterization
The effect of solid-state confinement in the photophysical properties of the three different PDI derivatives was addressed by the UV-Vis and the PL spectra of each derivative, as recorded in dilute solution (0.2 μg ml−1) and in the solid-state. For the dilute solutions, the PL spectra were recorded when three common organic solvents of different dielectric constant (ε) were used, that is toluene (Tol, ε = 2.38), chloroform (CLF, ε = 4.81), and chlorobenzene (CLB, ε = 5.62).
The overview of the UV-Vis and PL spectra as a function of the dielectric constant of the solvent used are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S5). No obvious spectral shifts take place in the UV-Vis and PL maxima of the PDI adducts, thereby ruling out the occurrence of any solvatochromic effects on the probed PDI luminescence.
Upon changing from solution to the film state, significant spectral shifts (ΔE = EPL-sol − EPL-film) are found in the PL maxima of each PDI derivative. The occurred shifts increase progressively from ΔE = 0.15 eV for the C6-PDI2 derivative, to ΔE = 0.30 eV to the EP-PDI derivative, reaching ΔE = 0.40 eV for the BG-PDI2. These values are much higher than the typical PL red-shift occurring due to Lorentz-type intermolecular interactions in films. The comparison reveals that exciton energy losses are operative in solid-state PDI multiadducts films due to the activation of low-energy emissive excimers. The largest spectral shift is found for the BG-PDI2 derivative therefore this PDI derivative seems to form the most stabilized excimer species. In the BG-PDI2 system excimer activation could be driven by the π–π stacking interactions between adjacent thiophene bridge-cores.
For screening the morphology of the three neat PDIs and PTB7 polymer, and the corresponding PTB7-Th:PDI blend films a series of SEM images were recorded. These images are presented in Fig. 5, and in Fig. S6 of the ESI.† As expected, the EP-PDI-only film exhibits large size aggregates similar to those observed earlier for similar OPV blends of this PDI derivative.9,29 In contrast, SEM suggests that on the length scale probed, no formation of nanograin features takes place in neat C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 films. Likewise, no discernable formation of PDI nanoaggregates can be verified by the SEM images of the three PTB7-Th:PDI blends, suggesting that the organization of the PDI derivatives that is responsible for the activation of emissive excimer species takes place on smaller length scales.

Further insight into the effect of intermolecular interactions was gained on the molecular length scale by performing GIWAXS measurements. Previous structural characterization studies of PDI-based OPV blend films have described how the EP-PDI monoadduct can hierarchically self-assemble in multi length-scale arrangements owing to its disk shape molecular structure. For this PDI derivative, PDI columnar structures are formed by π–π stacked PDI monomers, which then assemble to nano-sized PDI domains, as defined by the intercolumnar PDI correlation length.8
For our work, neat PDIs and PTB7-Th:PDIs blend films were characterized by 2D GIWAXS. Fig. S7 in the ESI† presents the in-plane and out-of-plane profiles for neat EP-PDI, C6-PDI2, BG-PDI2, and PTB7-Th components, and Fig. 6a–c presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns for the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 blend films. Fig. 6d–f presents the GIWAXS intensity distributions obtained from the 2D GIWAXS images plotted as a function of the scattering vector q in the region of 0.2–1.8 Å−1, in which the scattering peaks were fitted using a Gaussian model. All extracted information concerning the structural motifs of the studied systems is summarized in Tables S3 and S5 of the ESI.†

Typically, the signature of π–π stacking of PDI is expected in the range of q = 1.7–2.0 Å−1.30 Yet, the corresponding in-plane scattering GIWAXS reflections for each of the three PDI derivatives studied are extended to lower scattering vector q values, indicating the impact of stereochemical hindrance on the capability of the PDI dimers to self-organize in the solid state. Although no direct π–π stacking is possible between the PDI cores of the C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 derivatives, the GIWAXS reflections seen at lower scattering vector q values indicate the onset of longer-range secondary interactions that can facilitate the electronic coupling of adjacent PDI cores in these PDI adducts. For the films of neat EP-PDI, C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 the π–π stacking distances are found to be 3.45 Å (q = 1.82 Å−1), 4.00 Å (q = 1.58 Å−1) and 3.95 Å (q = 1.59 Å−1). When blended with the PTB7-Th matrix, the corresponding π–π stacking distance for each PDI derivative becomes 3.70 Å (q = 1.69 Å−1) for PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, 3.95 Å (q = 1.60 Å−1) for PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and 3.80 Å (q = 1.66 Å−1) for PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2.
By monitoring the in-plane scans of the films developed by the neat PDI derivatives, the scattering intensity of the diffraction peaks verifies the formation of well-ordered domains. An estimate on the size of these domains can be obtained by the FWHM of the X-ray scattering peak, which gives information about coherence length; that is how far the diffraction planes interfere with each other. For the neat films of EP-PDI, C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 the domain sizes are found to be 18.20 ± 0.40 nm (q = 0.37 Å−1), 4.50 ± 0.05 nm (q = 0.35 Å−1) and 4.45 ± 0.02 nm (q = 0.30 Å−1), respectively. Similarly, the (100) diffraction plane of the neat PTB7-Th film exhibits a coherence length of 5.90 ± 0.05 nm (q = 0.28 Å−1), estimating the domain size of the polymer in its pristine state. The impact of blending each of the PDI derivatives with the PTB7-Th donor on the domain size of the PDI component is different for each PDI adduct. For the EP-PDI monomer a substantial reduction is observed, whereas the domains of the two PDI dimers maintain the size of their corresponding neat films. The determined values are 6.80 ± 0.20 nm (q = 0.36 Å−1), 4.00 ± 0.02 nm (q = 0.32 Å−1) and 4.60 ± 0.02 nm (q = 0.32 Å−1) for the films of PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2, respectively. Compared to the domain size in the neat PTB7-Th film (5.90 nm), the size of well-ordered PTB7-Th domains in the blend films increase to 7.25 ± 0.10 nm, 9.10 ± 0.10 nm and 8.70 ± 0.05 nm for PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2, respectively. According to previous WAXS studies on extruded fibers of low-performing PDI-based composites,30 the difference in the domain sizes of the polymer and the PDI acceptor was substantially high, with the domain of the PDI component being always the largest. Here, the observed differences in the domain sizes of the polymer and the PDI acceptor phases are less pronounced. More importantly, in the PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 photoactive layers the dominant domain size is observed for the PTB7-Th phase, which is twice as large as the PDI domain size.
Intensity-dependent and transient photovoltage characterization
The dependence of the device VOC on photoexcitation intensity provides useful information about the presence of traps in the OPV photoactive layers. In trap-free photoactive layers the dependence of VOC on the natural logarithm of light intensity exhibits a slope equal to the thermal voltage coefficient kT/q, where k corresponds to the Boltzmann constant, T to absolute temperature and q to the elementary charge. When slopes higher than kT/q are observed, non-geminate charge recombination loss channels are operative in the OPV device. The dependence of VOC on the simulated solar light intensity, for the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 devices is displayed in Fig. 7a. Respectively, the obtained slopes are 1.7 × kT/q, 1.4 × kT/q and 1.8 × kT/q. The three systems exhibit signs of trap-limited charge recombination characteristics with enhanced dependence of VOC on photoexcitation intensity. The most enhanced dependence is found for the case of the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 material combinations; that is in the systems that are prone to the activation of stable excimer states.

We further investigated charge recombination dynamics in the three PDI-based OPV heterojunctions by performing transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. For all devices, the photovoltage decay was determined for a range of Iexc values and the charge carrier lifetime (τ) was extracted by monoexponential fitting. The charge carrier density (n) in the devices was determined based on the TPC measurement for each Iexc used.31 The dependence of the charge carrier lifetime on the charge carrier density is presented in Fig. 7b after fitting the data with the power-law τ(n) = τ0n−λ functional. Here, λ + 1 represents the apparent non-geminate recombination order.32 The value of λ is the highest for the PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 system (λ = 3.31), decreasing to λ = 2.23 for the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI system and lowering to λ = 1.81 for the PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 system. Irrespective of the system studied, the apparent recombination order is found to be λ + 1 ≫ 2, stressing the important role of traps33 in the charge recombination loss channels that limit these three device systems. The highest λ values are obtained for the PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:EP-PDI devices, in good agreement with the high thermal voltage coefficients found in Fig. 7a. In a previous contribution we demonstrated how the losses caused by trap-assisted charge recombination increase as the dimensionality of the PDI electron acceptor decreases.23 Here this trend is understood further considering the PL spectral shifts (Fig. 4) observed in the transition from dilute solution to the solid-state. The formation of stabilized PDI excimer species proves the planarized configuration of these two PDI derivatives and the reduced dimensionality of their molecular structure. As the PL spectral shift of each PDI derivative becomes larger, the corresponding λ value obtained from the respective OPV device increases.
Temperature-dependent charge carrier mobility
Next, we addressed the effect of physical disorder present in the three PDI-based composite systems on their charge transport properties. Temperature-dependent charge transport measurements were performed for the three systems, both for the case of electron-only and hole-only devices in the temperature range of 140–300 K. For each temperature, the dark J–V metrics of each single-carrier device were recorded, and the corresponding electron and hole mobility values were deduced. For organic semiconductors, the theoretical description of temperature-dependent zero-field charge carrier mobilities was initially based on the Gaussian Disorder Model (GDM),34 in which the temperature dependence of the zero-field charge carrier mobility relies on a ∝ T−2 functional. The GDM describes charge transport as a result of charge hopping in an energetic landscape of density of states (DoS) via a Miller–Abrahams manner, whereby the energy distribution of the DoS sites has a Gaussian form. Based on GDM, the main parameters of the zero-field charge carrier mobility (μ0) and the energetic width (σ) of the DoS can be deduced. However, GDM is unable to fully recover the dependence of charge carrier mobility in the low electric field regime, and it needs to invoke ambiguous mathematical terms (off-diagonal disorder) as free fitting parameters. Also, no consideration exists in the GDM formalism regarding the potential correlation between the different transporting sites of DoS, plus for these sites a point-like character is anticipated that does not exhibit any kind of spatial extension, as would have been expected for the case of π-conjugated polymers.35,36 For alleviating the weaknesses of the GDM model, other theoretical models were developed37–41 that considered the effects of charge carrier density, polaronic character and the spatial correlations between the site energies where transport takes place. By these refinements, the temperature dependence of the zero-field charge carrier mobility is controlled by both parameters of polaron binding energy and energetic disorder. For some cases an Arrhenius-like functional (∝ T−1) can be applied.42–45 In those cases, the derived activation energy of charge transport serves as a metric of the energetic disorder in the DoS and it is inversely proportional to the charge carrier mobility.

Fig. 8 presents the derived μh (Fig. 8a) and μe (Fig. 8b) mobility values as a function of inverse absolute temperature (T−1), for each PDI-based composite. For these data sets, Fig. S8 in the ESI† displays a comparative illustration of fitting with the Arrhenius and the GDM formalisms. As shown in Fig. 8a, across the whole studied temperature range, the hole mobility increases as the temperature increases, yet the dependence exhibits a non-Arrhenius character. The observed deviation can be attributed to an energetically disordered DoS of hole carriers whereby the disorder effects dominate over the polaronic binding energy of the holes. In addition, the non-Arrhenius behaviour could be due to the invariance of the DoS width of holes on the thermal fluctuations caused by the torsional interactions between neighboring conjugated PTB7-Th segments. Both alternatives have been shown to dictate the applicability of the Arrhenius formalism on charge transport occurring in organic semiconductors.36

Dash lines in (b) represent fitting of the data with the Arrhenius equation (see text). 
Concerning the electron mobility, at all temperatures studied, the PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 photoactive layer exhibits the highest electron mobility, however for this system the dependence on temperature is the weakest. In the other extreme, the electron mobility of the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI device has the strongest thermally-activated character, and it is the lowest of all three systems across the whole range of temperatures studied. Upon fitting the electron mobility data with the Arrhenius equation,43 an estimation of the activation energy (Ea) for electron transport is possible.
The derived Ea values for the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI, PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 systems are 282 meV, 249 meV, and 201 meV, respectively. The obtained activation energies are much lower than the energy difference arising from the energetic alignment of the LUMO and the work function of the electrodes used in the electron-only devices. More importantly, they are comparable to values obtained for similar solution processed single component36,44,46 and bulk heterojunction45 organic systems. Therefore, we can suggest with caution that the derived Ea values reflect the width of the electron-transport DoS in each of the PDI derivatives studied. This width is affected by temperature due to the thermal fluctuations caused by the configuration distribution of the PDI molecular structure. Unlike the case of the PDI multiadducts, the PDI monomer is not expected to exhibit a broad distribution of molecular conformations. Even so, it is found to possess the highest width of DoS, most likely due to its capacity to adopt a broad distribution of π–π stacking configurations30 that increases physical disorder. In a similar manner, disorder effects in the structure increase the DoS width of the C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 derivatives due to the broad distribution of dihedral angles between the covalently linked planar units in each PDI dimer. The data presented in Fig. 8b reveal that regardless of using monomeric or multiadduct PDI derivatives, the electron-transport DoS of PDI acceptors tends to remain broad and temperature-dependent. Moreover, the disordered character found for all three PDI derivatives is in line with the presence of traps inferred by the transient VOC results discussed above (Fig. 7b), suggesting that a fraction of low-energy sites in the DoS will be acting as deep traps. In combination with the results of the intensity-dependent VOC study (Fig. 7a), this finding highlights the endemic characteristic of trap-limited charge transport in PDI-based semiconductive layers.
Considering the insight obtained by GIWAXS on the structural motifs of the studied systems we now try to correlate the magnitude of energetic disorder in the electron trap-state distribution with the corresponding domain size of the PDI component and with the electron transport performance. The replacement of EP-PDI by BG-PDI2 results in the formation of smaller domains for electron transport in the blend. Moreover, it leads to the substantial reduction of energetic disorder and in the increase of room temperature electron mobility by nearly three times. In the layer containing the EP-PDI derivative we speculate that the broad distribution of π–π stacking configurations of EP-PDI monomers is present in between the large, well-ordered EP-PDI domains, thereby impeding their effective electronic coupling. Instead, the tendency of BG-PDI2 to form stable excimer states suggests that less BG-PDI2 molecules stay disorganized in the PTB7-Th:BG-PDI2 layer. When EP-PDI is replaced by C6-PDI2, the domain size of the PDI crystallites in the electron transporting phase becomes even smaller, however the electron mobility increases only by a factor of two. The energetic disorder for electrons (Ea) in the PTB7-Th:C6-PDI2 layer remains closer to the levels of the PTB7-Th:EP-PDI system, presumably due to the weaker tendency of C6-PDI2 for self-association. However, since the electron mobility between these small-sized C6-PDI2 domains is increased, the detrimental effects of disordered C6-PDI2 on electron transport should be less intense than those observed when the EP-PDI monomer is used.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have presented a comparative study of three different PDI-based electron acceptors EP-PDI, C6-PDI2 and BG-PDI2 that hold promise for the development of fullerene-free OPV devices. For our work the polymer matrix PTB7-Th was used as the electron donor, and the three PTB7-Th:PDI systems were characterized by means of electrical response in combination with detailed structural characterization. Our study focused on the impact of the PDI molecular structure on the device performance, with attention on the effect of using PDI dimer derivatives as alternatives to the low-performing PDI monomers.
The replacement of the monomeric PDI acceptor by the two PDI dimer adducts did improve the room temperature electron mobility of the OPV blends. Yet, the observed improvement is not enough, and the obtained electron mobility remains orders of magnitude lower than that of fullerene-based acceptors. Moreover, the comparable activation energy of electron mobility and the capability for PDI excimer activation in the three different PTB7-Th:PDI systems indicate that the formation charge trapping sites cannot be easily avoided, even when PDI multiadduct configurations are used. In all three systems studied, the trap-assisted charge recombination losses are found enhanced. Nevertheless, a substantial increase of nearly 50% is achieved in the device PCE upon replacing EP-PDI with the C6-PDI2 acceptor. The positive effect of using C6-PDI2 stems from the weaker tendency of this derivative to form PDI excimer-like states and its ability to preserve the electronic connectivity of the C6-PDI2 domains when blended with the PTB7-Th matrix. In contrast, when EP-PDI is used, larger electron transporting domains are formed that co-exist with disordered EP-PDI monomers, which act as deep energetic traps and impede electron transport. In the other extreme, the use of BG-PDI2 makes the size of the electron transporting domains smaller however this is counterbalanced by the propensity of BG-PDI2 to self-aggregate and to form stable excimer-like emissive species.
Our study gains deep insight into the actual parameters that dictate the solar cell performance of PDI multiadducts and provide useful feedback for material optimization. The use of PDI dimers for the development of OPV devices neither precludes by default the activation of excimer-like states nor guarantees the suppression of trap-assisted charge recombination losses. Like in the case of PDI monomers, some PDI dimers are prone to the formation of low-energy excimer-like species, thus leading to losses of the initially absorbed photon energy and to the enhancement of non-geminate recombination relaxation channels. Next-generation PDI multiadduct architectures functionalized with conjugated core bridges should be designed by considering the tendency of the bridges to undergo π–π stacking. A careful molecular design should be pursued for eliminating this possibility and for enabling the formation of truly high-configurational conformations of these PDI derivatives in the solid state.
Materials and methods
Materials

PTB7-Th and EP-PDI were purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc., and were used as received. The C6-PDI2 small molecule was synthesized according to the published procedure.27 The BG-PDI2 acceptor was synthesized following previous reports.18 ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mL 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.278 mL ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a surfactant, followed by stirring overnight ay 70 °C under ambient conditions.
Thin film and dilute solution characterization
The UV-Visible absorption and PL spectra of the spin coated films were measured using a PerkinElmer, Lambda 1050 spectrometer with a Horiba Jobin Yvon NanoLog spectrofluorimeter, respectively. The optical density of the dilute solutions was measured in a double monochromator spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2700). A temperature stabilized continuous-wave laser source (Lambda Photometrics, DPGL-2010F) was used for photoexciting the solutions at 532 nm. A software-controlled mini spectrometer (Ocean Optics, FLAME-S-VIS-NIR-ES) enabled the acquisition of photoluminescence spectra, after fiber-coupling (M114L01 Thorlabs, 600 μm diameter, numerical aperture 0.20) the luminescence of the photoexcited solutions in the spectrometer.
Morphology characterization
SEM images were captured using a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with a secondary electron detector. GIWAXS measurements were performed using Beam-line 3C at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). A photon energy of 10.6408 keV (λ = 1.1651 Å) was used.
Solar cell fabrication
The inverted structure of the OPV devices was prepared with the structure as glass/ITO (∼110 nm)/ZnO (∼40 nm)/photoactive layer/V2O5 (∼2 nm)/Ag (∼100 nm). ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned by sequential sonications in detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 minutes at each step. After UV/ozone treatment for 30 minutes, a ZnO electron transport layer47 was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm and then baking at 150 °C for 30 minutes on the hot plate under ambient conditions. Active layer solutions were prepared in CB and were heated on a hotplate at 80 °C for overnight with stirring in ambient. Optimum concentrations of different donor/acceptor and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive were used from our reported optimized recipes.18,23,47 The active layers were spin-coated onto the prepared glass/ITO/ZnO substrates in a nitrogen (N2)-filled glovebox. The cathode electrodes were deposited by transferring the samples into a thermal evaporator. V2O5 (2 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was then thermally deposited sequentially on top of the active layer with the help of a shadow mask having a 0.0555 cm2 device area.
Solar cell electrical characterization
The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 power source meter under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator) with reference to a PVM 132 cell certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The external quantum efficiency was measured using a photomodulation spectroscopy setup (Merlin, Oriel) with monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp. The power density of the monochromatic light was calibrated using a Si photodiode certified by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. Photoexcitation intensity-dependent J–V curves were measured using the same solar simulator setup by varying the solar light intensity from 10–100 mW cm−2.
Charge carrier dynamics
The TPV and TPC were measured using a TDC3054C digital oscilloscope connected to high-speed preamplifiers (SR560 and DHPCA-100). The input impedance for the TPV measurements was 100 MΩ to ensure open circuit conditions. The devices were photoexcited by a 3 ns pulsed laser at 532 nm (OBB, NL4300 and OD401) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
Unipolar device fabrication and electrical characterization
Hole-only and electron-only control devices were fabricated with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/Ca/Al, respectively. The dark J–V characteristics of devices were measured in a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 4200 power source meter. For low temperature dark J–V measurements, the devices were mounted on standard sample holder purchased from JANIS along with the cryostat (JANIS VPF-100). The device temperature (180–300 K) was controlled with a connected Lake Shore, 335 temperature controller unit, and dark J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2636 SM unit.
