    , Accepted 12th May 2021First published on 13th May 2021AbstractIn this paper, two cyclohexyl-substituted non-fullerene small molecules, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, are designed to have the same molecular backbone of a bithiophene (T2) core and rhodanine (RH) end groups. T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH can be synthesized via two and four synthesis steps, respectively, from commercially available starting materials. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that both small molecules are thermally stable at temperatures greater than 380 °C. Compared with T2-Cy6PRH, T2-Cy6MRH exhibits a higher thermal-transition temperature and a more negative enthalpy change, indicating that it exhibits greater crystallinity. Unlike T2-Cy6MRH, T2-Cy6PRH can form a uniform film via solution-processing, because the introduction of longer flexible alkyl chains endows T2-Cy6PRH with better solubility than T2-Cy6MRH. The T2-Cy6PRH film (λmax = 490 nm) exhibits complementary UV-vis absorption with the small-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th (λmax = 700 nm). In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of T2-Cy6PRH are relatively low-lying compared with those of PTB7-Th. An organic solar cell device based on T2-Cy6PRH and PTB7-Th exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.60% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.03 V. The addition of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester substantially improved the device performance, owing to the improved film morphology and the cascade-energy-level alignment, resulting in a PCE of 6.91% under additive- and annealing-free conditions.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn considerable attention because of great advances in the fabrication of low-cost, lightweight, flexible, transparent, and large-area printable devices.1–5 Recently, researchers have achieved remarkable progress in the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), and typical acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type NFAs have increased the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to greater than 15%.6–9 The realization of high-performance OSCs necessitates the selection of an appropriate combination of donor and acceptor materials to enable the fabrication of blend films with well-matched physical properties. NFAs should be designed to exhibit (1) absorption that complements that of the polymer donor to enhance the light-harvesting ability of the active layer, (2) energy levels compatible with those of the polymer donor to ensure efficient exciton separation and to maximize the open-circuit voltage (VOC), and (3) a suitable crystallinity to realize a favorable D/A film morphology for efficient charge transport. The modulation of the molecular structure—in particular, π-conjugated core units—has been used as an effective approach to achieving the aforementioned properties because it enables modification of molecular energy levels, increased intermolecular interaction, and improved charge mobility.10
In the development of new organic semiconducting materials, side-chain engineering is also a very useful method to fine-tune the physical properties of the materials and the morphology of the corresponding films. Various side chains introduced onto the donor or acceptor materials in OSCs include linear/cyclic/branched alkyl side chains, electron-donating/withdrawing side chains, conjugated side chains, and oligoether side chains.11 Linear or branched (i.e., 2-ethylhexyl) alkyl or π-conjugated 2D alkylaryl (i.e., alkylphenyl or alkylthienyl) side chains have been widely used in the active materials of OSCs.4,5 A few examples of organic semiconducting materials containing cyclic side chains have been reported.12–16 The effect of cyclohexyl groups on intermolecular aggregation has been investigated. In some cases, intermolecular aggregation has been found to be enhanced by the introduction of cyclohexyl groups because of their rigidity and preferential chair conformation;17,18 in other cases, cyclohexyl groups have led to weak aggregation between molecules by functioning as a bulky steric side chain.15 Therefore, the effect of cyclohexyl groups on molecular aggregation depends on the substitution position and the type of the molecular backbone. The grafting of cyclohexyl groups as side-chains into polymer donors has been shown to strengthen side-chain interdigitation, resulting in an overall tighter lamellar packing in the film state and a PCE more than twice that of the corresponding device with a reference polymer.17 In addition, most of the studies on the effects of cyclohexyl groups have been limited to polymer donors; the literature contains few studies on acceptors with a cyclohexyl group.
Recently, we reported a series of high-performance NFAs, composed of bithiophene (T2) and alkylrhodanine dye.19–22 The relatively short π-conjugation of these NFAs resulted in optical properties that complement those of the small-bandgap polymer donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th). Moreover, the most promising physical properties of this series, the high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (for example, −3.6 eV for T2-ORH) provided high VOC values (>1 V) and a remarkably low energy loss. Because of the non-fused core structure of bithiophene, the synthesis procedures for this series could be quite simple (e.g., two steps for T2-ORH). The structural simplicity of this series enables the chemical structure to be modified in various ways. In the present work, we introduced cyclohexyl groups onto both ends as alkyl side chains to investigate the effect of these groups on the physical properties of a series of these non-fullerene small molecules. Two cyclohexylalkyl-substituted rod-shaped small molecules, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, were designed to have the same molecular backbone of a rhodanine (RH)-flanked bithiophene. The common normal or branched alkyl groups (e.g., the n-octyl group in T2-ORH or 2-ethylhexyl group in T2-OEHRH)19,20 attached to both RH ends were replaced with cyclohexylalkyl groups. Methylene (–CH2–) and propylene (–CH2CH2CH2–), as alkyl spacers with different lengths, are located between the RH and cyclohexyl groups, resulting in T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, respectively. The introduction of the cyclohexyl side chains resulted in higher thermal transition temperatures compared with those of the n-alkyl-containing small molecules. Such a substantial increase in molecular interaction resulted in very poor solubility of T2-Cy6MRH; however, the molecular packing ability of T2-Cy6PRH was suppressed by the introduction of the longer alkyl spacer (propylene), resulting in better solubility suitable for film formation. The optical and electrochemical properties of the small molecules were investigated and found to be complementary to those of the representative low bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th. T2-Cy6PRH could be used as an acceptor for OSCs because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the two RHs at both ends. The inverted OSCs were fabricated with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)/polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/PTB7-Th:T2-Cy6PRH/MoOx/Ag. A PCE of 4.60% with a high VOC of 1.04 V was obtained for an OSC fabricated under the additive-free and annealing-free condition.
2. Result and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The two small molecules, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, consisted of a bithiophene core and cyclohexylalkyl-substituted RH ends designed with different alkyl spacer lengths (methylene and propylene). These RH-substituted bithiophenes, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, were synthesized via two and four steps, respectively, from commercially available starting materials (i.e., cyclohexanemethylamine (Cy6MNH2) and 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol, respectively). The alkyl-substituted RH derivatives, cyclohexylmethylrhodanine (Cy6MRH) and N-(3-cyclohexyl)propylrhodanine (Cy6PRH), were synthesized using bis(carboxymethyl)trithiocarbonate though a ring-closing reaction with the corresponding amine derivatives of Cy6MNH2 and N-(3-cyclohexyl)propylamine (Cy6PNH2), respectively. The Cy6MNH2 was acquired from a commercial source (US$12 per gram), and Cy6PNH2 was easily synthesized from 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol (US$5 per gram) via the Gabriel reaction (yield: >70%)23,24 Finally, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH were obtained in high yield (>92%) via a Knoevenagel condensation between 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-dicarbaldehyde and the corresponding RH derivatives of Cy6MRH and Cy6PRH, respectively, followed by washing with methyl alcohol. No further purification steps were needed. The synthetic routes to T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH are shown in Scheme 1. The chemical structures of all of the intermediates and the final products were confirmed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The final products of T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH were analyzed by 13C-NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). However, the 13C-NMR spectrum of T2-Cy6MRH could not be obtained because of its poor solubility. The UV-vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms of T2-Cy6MRH could also not be obtained for the same reason. By contrast, T2-Cy6PRH was soluble in organic solvents including chloroform. T2-Cy6MRH was soluble in chloroform in concentrations of less than 4 mg mL−1, whereas T2-Cy6PRH exhibited improved solubility in chloroform (20 mg mL−1) at room temperature. The introduction of a longer flexible alkyl spacer resulted in T2-Cy6PRH exhibiting better solubility than T2-Cy6MRH.

2.2. Physical properties
Both T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH displayed excellent thermal stability, losing less than 5% of their weight when heated to 380 °C, as measured by thermogravimetry (TGA) (Fig. 1a). The thermal transition behaviors of the two small molecules were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The endothermic melting temperature (Tm) of T2-Cy6MRH (327 °C) was substantially higher than that of T2-Cy6PRH (232 °C), and the corresponding enthalpy change was also more negative for T2-Cy6MRH (−94.4 J g−1) than for T2-Cy6PRH (−83.4 J g−1). A similar trend was observed in the exothermic recrystallization temperatures (Tcr) upon cooling. The higher thermal-transition temperature and more negative enthalpy change of T2-Cy6MRH indicate that it exhibits greater molecular aggregation and greater crystallinity than T2-Cy6PRH, consistent with the poor solubility of T2-Cy6MRH. In addition, T2-Cy6PRH exhibited liquid-crystalline characteristics at 193 °C according to its DSC thermogram. The phase-transition temperatures of molecules with the same backbone increase gradually with decreasing length of the alkyl side chain.25,26 These trends were also observed in a series of these bithiophene-RH-based rod-shaped small molecules. In our previous report about the alkylrhodanine-flanked bithiophenes, ethyl-substituted T2-ERH (Tm = 305 °C and Tcr = 265 °C)21 exhibited a much higher transition temperature than octyl-substituted T2-ORH (Tm = 204 °C and Tcr = 175 °C).20 The phase-transition properties of the hexyl-substituted T2-HRH (Tm = 243 °C and Tcr = 213 °C)22 were intermediate between those of T2-ERH and T2-ORH. The Tms gradually increased from octyl to hexyl to ethyl substitution, indicating increased molecular interaction. In the present study, because the molecular aggregation behaviors can be controlled by the shape of the substituents as well as their length, as an example of modifying the shape of the substituents, we introduced a cyclohexyl group as a terminal side chain, which resulted in a much higher phase-transition temperature in T2-Cy6MRH (Tm = 327 °C and Tcr = 280 °C). That is, very strong molecular interactions were induced by the cyclohexyl group, which, according to the literature, is attributable to the rigid and preferential chair conformation of the cyclohexyl group.17,18 The Tm of T2-Cy6MRH (327 °C) was more than 120 °C higher than that of T2-ORH (204 °C), resulting in very poor solubility of the T2-Cy6MRH. Notably, T2-Cy6MRH had a higher Tm than the ethyl-containing T2-ERH, despite the longer side-chain length of T2-Cy6MRH. Again, such excessive molecular aggregation could be weakened by the introduction of a longer n-alkyl spacer of propylene in T2-Cy6PRH. The Tm of T2-Cy6PRH was lowered to 232 °C, still higher than that of T2-ORH but lower than that of T2-HRH. Thus, the insertion of a longer flexible alkyl spacer imparted T2-Cy6PRH with sufficient solubility for film formation via solution processing. The thermal characteristics of T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH are summarized in Table 1.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2a and appear to be approximately the same; this result is reasonable given the similarity of their molecular backbones, both of which consist of bithiophene and RH. The UV-vis absorption maxima (λmax) of the two small molecules were observed at 510 nm, irrespective of the introduced alkyl chains. Fig. 2b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the T2-Cy6PRH films. (As previously noted, a film with a proper morphology could not be obtained from T2-Cy6MRH because of its very poor solubility.) The spectrum of the as-cast T2-Cy6PRH film shows two absorption peaks. The λmax of the T2-Cy6PRH film was 490 nm, which was blue-shifted by ∼20 nm compared with the value corresponding to the solution-state (λmax = 510 nm), suggesting H-aggregation.20 Another absorption peak centered at 510 nm exhibited nearly the same intensity as that observed at 490 nm together with an additional shoulder peak at approximately 563 nm. This relatively red-shifted and broadened absorption compared with that in the solution spectrum indicated the existence of J-type molecular aggregation. Thus, the T2-Cy6PRH molecules formed both J- and H-type aggregates in the film state. The coexistence of these different types of crystalline domains in films of pentacene or other rod-shaped small molecules has been widely reported.27–29 In addition, the T2-Cy6PRH film was thermally annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. The spectrum of the TA-treated T2-Cy6PRH film shows an apparently blue-shifted absorption (λmax = 445 nm) compared with the spectra of the as-cast film (λmax = 490 nm) and the solution (λmax = 510 nm). A greater blue-shift in the absorption maximum indicates stronger H-type aggregation induced by thermal annealing (TA). The intensity of the absorption shoulder observed at ∼560 nm was greatly reduced. That is, the aggregation behavior of the T2-Cy6PRH films was changed by annealing. Interestingly, the phenomenon observed in T2-Cy6PRH films was reversed compared with that observed in the previously reported T2-ORH case, where predominant H-type aggregation in the as-cast T2-ORH film was shifted to J-type aggregation by annealing. The change in the aggregation behavior of the T2-Cy6PRH film could significantly influence the OSC device performance, as discussed in Section 2.3.

Importantly, T2-Cy6PRH exhibited complementary UV-vis absorption with the small-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th. The absorption spectra for the PTB7-Th film are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) for comparison. T2-Cy6PRH can absorb light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm, while PTB7-Th can absorb light with wavelengths longer than 600 nm, which is beneficial to light-harvesting in OSCs based on blend films composed of T2-Cy6PRH and PTB7-Th as an electron acceptor and an electron donor, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eg,opts) were estimated from the absorption onset wavelengths (λonset) of the T2-Cy6PRH and PTB7-Th films according to the equation Eg = 1240/λonset (eV). T2-Cy6PRH exhibited a relatively wider Eg,opt (2.02 eV) compared with that of PTB7-Th (1.67 eV).
The electrochemical properties of T2-Cy6PRH were investigated by CV measurements (Fig. 3a). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of T2-Cy6PRH were calculated using the empirical relationship EHOMO = −(Eonset,ox − E1/2,Fc + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = −(Eonset,red − E1/2,Fc + 4.8) eV, where Eonset,ox and Eonset,red are the onset potentials of oxidation and reduction, respectively, assuming that the energy level of Fc is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level.30,31 The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated to be −5.67 and −3.62 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap (Eg,CV) corresponding to the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels was 2.05 eV, which is similar to the optically obtained Eg,opt value (2.02 eV). The energy-level diagram of T2-Cy6PRH is shown in Fig. 3b, together with that of PTB7-Th for comparison. The energetic offsets between the HOMOs (0.5 eV) and LUMOs (0.12 eV) of PTB7-Th and T2-Cy6PRH are observed. In previous studies, an energy-level offset greater than 0.3 eV is required for efficient energy transfer between the donor and acceptor;32 however, in recent studies, effective energy transfer is possible even in devices with an offset smaller than 0.3 eV, achieving energy losses smaller than 0.7 eV.20,31 The optical and electrochemical properties of PTB7-Th and T2-Cy6PRH are summarized in Table 2.

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
Inverted OSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO NPs/PEIE/active layer/MoOx/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of T2-Cy6PRH as an acceptor. On the basis of the aforementioned complementary physical properties of PTB7-Th and T2-Cy6PRH, PTB7-Th was selected as a donor. The D/A blend ratio and film thickness of the active layer were fixed as 1.0:2.0 and 100 nm, respectively. The blend films were thermally annealed at 90 °C and 120 °C for 10 min. All the device performances of T2-Cy6PRH are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Table 3 summarizes the representative device performance properties of T2-Cy6PRH in the as-cast and TA conditions. Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves.

 Fig. 4  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of the device based on T2-Cy6PRH and PTB7-Th. 
As shown in Fig. 4a, the devices based on T2-Cy6PRH exhibited a remarkably high VOC above 1.00 V. Such a high VOC was originated from the relatively high-lying LUMO level of the acceptor (e.g., T2-Cy6PRH). The energy loss (Eloss) was calculated to be only 0.63 eV using the equation Eloss = Eg,opt − eVOC.33 In our system, the lowest optical bandgap among the donor and acceptor components was 1.67 eV for the PTB7-Th donor polymer (Table 2). The aforementioned small energy-level offset between the two LUMOs (0.12 eV) was found to be sufficient for charge transfer between the donor and acceptor, even beneficial to achieving a low Eloss. The EQE response of the device is shown in Fig. 4b and is compared with the absorption spectra of the neat PTB7-Th and T2-Cy6PRH films in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The two EQE peaks centered at 500 nm and 720 nm well match the absorption properties of the T2-Cy6PRH and PTB7-Th films, respectively. The light absorption of both the donor and acceptor contributed to the generation of photocurrent in the device. The complementary absorption properties of the donor and acceptor resulted in broad EQE responses over the wavelength range from 360 to 800 nm.
As summarized in Table 3, the best device performance of 4.60% was achieved with T2-Cy6PRH in the as-cast condition. The efficiency decreased to 4.00% and 3.57% in the devices with T2-Cy6PRH, subjected to TA at 90 °C and 120 °C, respectively, where the short-circuit current density (JSC) values gradually decreased from 11.04 mA cm−2 (as-cast) to 9.83 mA cm−2 (90 °C) and 8.81 mA cm−2 (120 °C). The difference in the JSC values between the as-cast and TA conditions matched well with the differences in the EQE responses. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the EQE profiles of the devices resemble the corresponding absorption profiles of the blend films, in which the absorption peaks centered at 500 nm in the blend films correspond to the absorption of T2-Cy6PRH. Comparing with the relatively sharp absorption and EQE peaks around 500 nm for the TA condition, the as-cast blend film spectra displayed a relatively broad absorption and EQE curves in the region of 500–600 nm, which are consistent with the absorption spectra of the neat T2-Cy6PRH films for the as-cast and TA conditions. As mentioned in the discussion of the absorption spectra, the aggregation type was shifted from J- to H-type and the molecular aggregation (in H-type) in T2-Cy6PRH films was enhanced by TA. According to our previous report on T2-ORH, the slipped-stacked J-type aggregation is more favorable than H-type (edge-on) aggregation for vertical and parallel charge transport in the OSCs.20 In the T2-ORH case, the as-cast film mainly adopted H-type aggregation; however, an appropriate TA procedure could induce J-type aggregation, resulting in greater device efficiency. Similarly, the T2-Cy6PRH-based device also exhibited better performance when the device was fabricated under conditions that led the molecules in the film to adopt J-type aggregation (i.e., the as-cast state). In addition, the height- and phase-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the blend films before and after annealing are shown in Fig. 5. The large rectangular-shape domains were observed in the TA film, which could be assigned as T2-Cy6PRH crystallites induced by TA. The strong H-type aggregation of T2-Cy6PRH under TA condition resulted in a relatively rough film morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.98 nm, compare to that of the as-cast film (1.39 nm), lowing the JSC value in TA.

To further improve the device performance, ternary devices were fabricated by introducing PCBM as the third component. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 6, adding 15% of PCBM to the active layer substantially increased the PCE to 6.91%, which was 1.5 times higher than that of the binary device (4.60%). In particular, the relatively low JSC and FF values of the binary cells, indicating poor exciton dissociation and possible charge back-flow/recombination, were significantly improved by the addition of a small amount of PCBM, which could be attributed to the relatively smooth and uniform surface morphology (RMS roughness = 0.71 nm, Fig. 7). The exciton dissociation and charge collection properties without and with PCBM addition were compared by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff). The charge dissociation and collection probability (P(E,T)) value is defined as the ratio of Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density.34,35 As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the P(E,T) values were effectively increased by addition of PCBM from 69% to 94%. The higher P(E,T) value of the ternary cell suggested the better exciton dissociation and the reduced charge recombination by addition of PCBM, which matched to the higher JSC and FF in ternary cell. In addition to the improved JSC and FF, notably, a high VOC value of 1.00 V was obtained in the ternary device. The control device based on the PTB7-Th:PCBM binary film exhibited the relatively low VOC of 0.83 V (Table S2 and Fig. S11, ESI†). Considering that the VOC of the device is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor and that the LUMO energy level of PCBM is as low as −4.2 eV,20 the addition of PCBM could reduce the VOC of the ternary device. However, in this system, the high VOC of the PTB7-Th:T2-Cy6PRH binary device was maintained in the ternary device (PTB7-Th:T2-Cy6PRH:PCBM). Based on this result, the working mechanism of the ternary device is expected to be a cascade energy-level alignment, rather than an alloy-like structure, and the charge transfer from PTB7-Th to T2-Cy6PRH should be more efficient than that from PTB7-Th to PCBM. The energy diagram and the possible charge transport path of the ternary cell are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The added PCBM effectively improved the film morphology without sacrificing the donor–acceptor charge transfer. Therefore, the JSC and FF values were improved without decreasing the VOC value in the devices.

In conclusion, the relatively high-lying LUMO energy level of T2-Cy6PRH and its complementary UV-vis absorption with the polymer donor PTB7-Th resulted in a PCE of 4.60%. The addition of a small amount of PCBM further improved the device performance, owing to the improved film morphology and a cascade energy-level alignment, which resulted in a PCE of 6.91% under additive- and annealing-free conditions. The simple process proposed here is beneficial for the commercialization of OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, two cyclohexyl-substituted small molecules, T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH, were designed and synthesized to have the same molecular backbone. Both T2-Cy6MRH and T2-Cy6PRH were thermally stable at temperatures greater than 380 °C. The thermal transition behaviors were investigated by DSC measurement. The greater crystallinity of T2-Cy6MRH led to its poor solubility, whereas the solubility of T2-Cy6PRH was sufficient to prepare a uniform film via solution processing. As a film, T2-Cy6PRH exhibited a UV-vis absorption maximum (λmax) at 490 nm, complementary to that of the small-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th (λmax = 700 nm). In addition, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of T2-Cy6PRH were found to be lower lying than those of PTB7-Th. The results presented here indicate that, when combined with the polymer donor PTB7-Th, T2-Cy6PRH could be a promising electron acceptor for use in solution-processable OSCs. A PCE of 4.60% was obtained in the OSC fabricated with PTB7-Th and T2-Cy6PRH. In particular, the high VOC of 1.03 V was obtained owing to the high-lying LUMO energy level. Furthermore, the addition of PCBM as the third component substantially improved the device performance (6.91%) under the additive- and annealing-free conditions, owing to the improved film morphology and cascade energy-level alignment. Such a simple manufacturing process can satisfy one of the prerequisites for OSC commercialization.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials and measurement
Bis(carboxymethyl)trithiocarbonate, 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-dicarbaldehyde, triphenylphosphine, hydrazine monohydrate, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). Piperidine and Cy6MNH2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). Chloroform, phthalimide, diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Seoul, Korea). Triethylamine (TEA) was acquired from Samchun Chemicals (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). THF was distilled from sodium/benzophenone under a nitrogen atmosphere before use.

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD400 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). 13C NMR spectra were analyzed on a Bruker AVANCE HD800 (Bruker, Germany) installed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) at Ochang Center. EA was performed on solid samples using a Vario Micro Cube elemental analyzer at the KBSI Pusan Center. HRMS was performed using JMS-700 (JEOL, Japan). To determine the solubility of each compound in chloroform, a supersaturated solution of each compound was stirred for 48 h at room temperature and subsequently allowed to stand for 12 h. Thereafter, the slurry was passed through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The filtrate was concentrated and its quantity measured. The solubility was measured following a method reported in the related literatures.36,37 TGA and DSC were performed using a TGA/DSC 1 and a DSC 1 (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland), respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating or cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis spectra were obtained using a Mega-U600 (Scinco, Korea). Solution-based samples for UV-vis measurements were prepared by dissolving the analyte in chloroform at a concentration of 5 ppm. Film samples for UV-vis measurements were prepared by spin coating a solution onto a glass substrate. The optical energy bandgaps (Eg,opts) were estimated from the absorption onset wavelengths (Eg,opt = 1240/λonset (eV)) of the films. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted using a 100B electrochemical analyzer, and was calibrated using a ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) standard with a redox potential of −4.8 eV. The three-electrode system comprised a nonaqueous reference electrode (0.1 M Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile solution), a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and a platinum working electrode. The redox potential was measured in acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The films were obtained by dip-coating a platinum working electrode into a solution. AFM images were obtained with NanoScope (Bruker, Germany) using the same samples that were used in the OSC devices as the top layer of the device (ITO/ZnO NPs/PEIE/PTB7-Th:T2-Cy6PRH). The TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2200FS instrument.

4.3. Device fabrication
The devices were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO NPs/PEIE/photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag. The ITO glass was cleaned with sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each and subsequently dried in an oven for 5 h. The ITO-coated glass substrates were pre-treated in a UV-ozone oven for 15 min. The PEIE solution was spin-coated on top of the ZnO NPs. After that, the ZnO NPs/PEIE-coated substrates were transferred to the N2-filled glovebox. The photoactive layer was composed of the NFSM acceptor developed in this work and the representative low bandgap polymer donor of PTB7-Th. The bulk-heterojunction active layer was spin-cast at 3000 rpm from a chloroform solution of donor and acceptor at concentration of 15 mg mL−1. The donor and acceptor blend ratio (D:A) was fixed to 1:2. Finally, MoOx (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were vacuum-deposited successively to complete the inverted device structure. The effective area of the devices was measured to be 9 mm2. The average thicknesses were measured with Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler (KLA Tencor). The J–V curves of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source measure unit (Keithley Instruments). The characterization of un-encapsulated solar cells was carried out in air under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport Company). Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer and the illumination intensity was set using an NREL certified silicon diode with an integrated KG1 optical filter. The EQE was measured using a reflective microscope objective to focus the light output from a 100 W halogen lamp outfitted with a monochromator and optical chopper (PV Measurements, Inc.). The photocurrent was measured using a lock-in amplifier and the absolute photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode.
