    , Accepted 24th January 2014First published on 27th January 2014AbstractTheoretical investigation into vibronic activity observed in the phosphorescence spectrum of 2,2′-bithiophene (2T) has revealed unexpectedly large discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and the available experimental spectrum. Theoretical spectra, obtained using the results of the high-level quantum chemistry calculations and the well founded model for vibronic activity, are considerably wider than the experimental one. The energy of the onset (corresponding to the adiabatic transition energy) is quantitatively reproduced, but the centers of gravity of the simulated spectral bands (vertical emission energies) are considerably red-shifted with respect to experiment. Critical reconsideration and tests of the approximations underlying the theoretical approach have failed to pinpoint the source of the observed discrepancies. In the following experimental reinvestigation of the phosphorescence of 2T we have observed that unusually large concentration of the chromophore and careful recalibration of the detector prior to measurements have been essential to collect a good quality spectrum. Incidentally, being considerably different from the previously reported one, the newly reported phosphorescence spectrum of 2T is in nearly quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.
1. Introduction
Oligothiophenes have received considerable attention over the last two decades as organic semiconductors with potential applications in field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, non-linear optics, and solar cells.1–4 The electric-dipole allowed S1 singlet state was the natural primary target of both experimental and theoretical investigation as the direct product of optical excitation, the main energy carrier in the oligothiophene crystals, as well as the potential precursor for the ionized excited states. The excitation energies, geometry relaxation processes and vibronic activity, and the transport mechanism of the S1 excitation are already quite well recognized.
The T1 triplet states are formed in oligothiophenes with substantial quantum yield through intersystem crossing from the optically allowed S1 singlet states to the triplet manifold, followed by rapid relaxation to the lowest triplet states.5 These states have enjoyed somewhat less attention compared to their singlet counterparts on account of experimental difficulties, such as inaccessibility of the triplet states in standard absorption studies, or low energy and quantum efficiency of the phosphorescence.6 Sophisticated experimental techniques were required to elucidate the excitation energies to the triplet states. The first quantitative study concerning oligothiophenes with 2–5 rings was reported by Landwehr et al., who measured high resolution triplet photoexcitation spectra by recording delayed fluorescence of the crystalline material.7 More recently, Seixas de Melo et al.6 combined time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry with quantum yield measurements of fluorescence and triplet formation to determine ET for oligothiophenes with 2–5, and 7 rings. Rentsch et al.8 and Siegert et al.9 used the photoelectron photodetachment spectroscopy of oligothiophene anions to measure the adiabatic excitation energies to the triplet states, as well as to the totally symmetric excited states. Siegert et al. included DFT/MRCI calculations of the vertical and adiabatic excitation energies to the low lying singlet and triplet states of all the studied oligothiophenes (n = 2–6), and the respective geometric reorganization energies. Rentsch et al. studied shorter oligothiophenes (n = 2–4). They provided the only vibrationally resolved low-temperature (77 K, ethanol matrix) phosphorescence spectrum of 2T available in the literature. This spectrum, however, was not analyzed in detail. To the best of our knowledge there has been no experimental or theoretical study devoted to the vibronic activity in the phosphorescence spectra of oligothiophenes. In this article we present a theoretical investigation focused on rationalizing the shape and fine structure of the 2T phosphorescence band. Unexpectedly large difference between the theoretical spectra and the experimental one forced us to critically review the theoretical approach in the search for sources of the discrepancies. Failing to find one, we have conducted our own measurements and report a new and improved experimental phosphorescence spectrum of 2T.
2. Computational details
Theoretical spectra presented in this study have been obtained using both the density functional theory based calculations and ab initio methodologies. For DFT we have selected the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional.10–12 The lowest triplet state has been modeled as the ground state in the 3Bu manifold of states, its wavefunction being obtained by shifting one electron from HOMO (bg) to LUMO (au) with the accompanying beta-to-alpha spin flip. The square of the total spin (S2) for the converged wavefunction equal to 2.02 shows that it represents a proper triplet state. The alternative approach to modeling of the T1 state that employs the time-dependent version of DFT calculations (using the ground state wavefunction as reference) has been abandoned on account of large spin contamination of the resulting state (S2 = 2.4).
For the leading ab initio method we have selected the approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles (CC2), the current implementation of which enables geometry optimizations and vibrational analyses for both the ground state and the excited molecular states (accessed via the linear response theory).13–15 Since the T1 state of 2T is mostly spanned by the single HOMO → LUMO excited electronic configuration, the corresponding excitation energy from the ground state can be regarded at the CC2 level of theory as correct through second order, providing accuracy comparable with, and sometimes higher than the EOM-CCSD.16 Yet, with this relatively inexpensive method (it scales as N5, N being the number of molecular orbitals) we could venture calculations with basis sets as large as aug-cc-pVQZ. Throughout the whole study the planar conformation of 2T has been assumed for both the ground state and the triplet state. The planar conformation corresponds to the equilibrium geometry (global minimum on the potential energy surface (PES) for the nuclei) for the triplet state. The ground state, on the other hand, is characterized by a double-well PES. The planar conformation represents the saddle point between the two very shallow (≈25 cm−1) minima (trans-gauche conformations), with high probability of tunneling between them. The assumed planarity follows thus the notion of dynamic planarization of molecules with extremely soft torsional or inversional normal modes.34 The impact of this assumption on the simulated phosphorescence spectra is discussed in greater detail in Section 5.
The CC2 results are further corroborated by means of the CASPT2 calculations.17 In contrast to the CC scheme, the CASPT2 method includes the dynamic electron correlation effects only perturbatively through the second order. The corrections, however, are computed for the multireference (CASSCF) wavefunctions, which already account for the static and a part of the dynamic electron correlation. The CASSCF wavefunctions are obtained separately for each electronic state, so the ground and excited states are computed with essentially the same accuracy that depends primarily on the composition of the active space. The lowest valence excited states of 2T are of the π–π* parentage. Consequently, the active space composed of all the ten valence π orbitals (5 bg and 5 au, shortly denoted as 55) seems to be the natural choice. Based on our previous experience with the excited Bu singlet states of 2T,18 however, we have decided to use the 57 active space, containing two additional virtual orbitals of the au symmetry.
The aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets with n = D, T, Q have been used for all the selected methods, except for the CASPT2, for which the calculations with the quadruple-ζ basis set could not be afforded because of their prohibitively high computational cost. The B3LYP and CC2 calculations have been carried out using the TURBOMOLE 6.4 program package,19 and the CASPT2 calculations have been performed using Molcas 7.6.20
Vibronic activity observed in the phosphorescence spectrum of 2T can be characterized in terms of Huang–Rhys (HR) factors Si = bi2/2. The FC parameters, bi, can be evaluated from the formula21,22 (1)in which xA and xB are the 3N-dimensional vectors of the equilibrium Cartesian coordinates in the A-th and B-th states, M is the 3N × 3N diagonal matrix of the atomic masses, and LAi is the 3N vector of the mass-weighted Cartesian displacements constituting the i-th normal coordinate calculated for the A-th (ground) electronic state. For symmetry reasons, the HR factors are non-zero only for the totally symmetric normal modes. The sum of the HR factors multiplied by the respective oscillation quanta (ℏωi) represents the (ground state) reorganization energy λgr., which is also defined as the difference between the electronic ground state energies calculated for the triplet state (13Bu) geometry and the ground state (X1Ag) geometry. Analogously, the excited state reorganization energy λexc. is obtained as the difference between the triplet state electronic energies computed for the ground state (X1Ag) geometry and for the triplet state (13Bu) geometry. Geometry reorganization energies are directly linked to the width of the absorption (λexc.) or emission (λgr.) bands.23

Eqn (1) is based on the assumption of the linear changes in the potential energy for the nuclei upon the electronic deexcitation. In a more rigorous treatment one would include additional effects such as the normal mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) or changes in the vibrational frequencies. Being due to higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the potential energy for the nuclei, these effects can be expected to be of secondary importance in comparison with those originating from the linear terms. Nonetheless, for the studied case of 2T phosphorescence this supposition is tested against the multidimensional approach, which accounts for all the above mentioned effects (cf. Section 5).
3. Excitation and reorganization energies

Table 1 contains the adiabatic energies of the triplet state, vertical absorption and emission energies, as well as the ground state and excited state reorganization energies (λgr. and λexc., respectively), calculated at the B3LYP, CC2, and CASPT2 levels of theory. The energies are clearly not converged for the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set, but the differences between the quadruple-ζ and triple-ζ results of the CC2 calculations are less than 0.035 eV. It indicates that the energies obtained for the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set are close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, and that the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set already provides good accuracy. The respective differences in the B3LYP results are even smaller (<0.01 eV).

The results of the ab initio calculations are very similar to one another, with the CASPT2 energies being somewhat lower than the respective CC2 values. All the excitation energies seem to be overestimated by some 0.15–0.25 eV with respect to the experimental data. Note, however, that the experimental results are red-shifted due to interactions with the neighboring molecules (if measured in the matrix8 or in the crystalline environment7), or they correspond to the geometry of the anion rather than that of the neutral molecule (in the PE-PDS experiments8,9). On this view, the agreement of the CC2 and CASPT2 adiabatic energies for the 13Bu → X1Ag transition with experiment can be regarded as very good. The adiabatic energies obtained in the DFT calculations are by 0.1–0.16 eV lower than the experimental values. This behavior is similar to that observed for the singlet states, for which the B3LYP excitation energies are often underestimated.18,21 For the vertical energies, and consequently for the reorganization energies, no experimental data have been reported so far. The only phosphorescence spectrum directly measured for 2T8 has the onset at 2.25 eV, while the rather sharp maximum of the band is located at 2.06 eV. The observed band is quite symmetric (cf.Fig. 4), with the centre of gravity in the vicinity of the maximum. It implies that the (ground state) reorganization energy corresponding to the 13Bu → X1Ag electronic transition is approximately 0.2 eV. It is in stark contrast with the calculated values, which for the CC2 and CASPT2 methods exceed 0.4 eV, approaching 0.5 eV for the DFT calculations. It also means that the reorganization energy corresponding to the 13Bu → X1Ag electronic transition is considerably lower than the corresponding value for the 11Bu → X1Ag transition (0.29 eV, ref. 21). In view of the more localized character of triplet excitations with respect to the singlet ones one would expect a reversed relation (λtr >λsing). Moreover, the DFT/MRCI calculations of Siegert et al. yielded quite large reorganization energies that for 2T approached 0.6 eV.9 These discrepancies call for further investigation into details of the geometry changes of 2T between its lowest triplet state and the ground state, and into the related vibronic activity that determines the width and shape of the corresponding phosphorescence band.
4. Geometrical parameters and Franck–Condon factors
The differences between the respective bond lengths for the optimized geometries of the X1Ag state and the 13Bu state calculated with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set are shown in Fig. 2. Detailed lists of geometrical parameters computed using all the selected basis sets are available in the ESI.† The pictures obtained in the B3LYP, CC2 and the CASPT2 calculations are qualitatively very similar. The most characteristic feature is the alternating pattern of the CC bonds in the ground electronic state of 2T, showing that in spite of the considerable aromaticity of thiophene,26 the bonds within the rings partly retain their single or double character. The inter-ring bond (C4–C4′) is the longest of all the CC bonds, which indicates that the π-electrons are delocalized predominantly within the thiophene rings. The direct consequences of such an electronic structure are: the softness of the inter-ring torsion, the flatness of the corresponding potential energy surface, and the non-planar, trans-gauche ground state conformation adopted by the 2T molecules in a vacuum. The triplet state wavefunction is dominated by the HOMO → LUMO electronic configuration (55% contribution in the CASSCF wavefunction for the 13Bu state). Owing to the specific features of the frontier orbitals (cf. Fig. S1 in the ESI†), a reversal of the alternating pattern of the CC bond lengths takes place, which leads to large changes in the respective equilibrium bond lengths that accompany the electronic transition. The most pronounced change concerns the inter-ring bond, which becomes shorter by over 0.08 Å. It shows that in the triplet state the coupling between the thiophene rings becomes much stronger. Consequently, the inter-ring torsion is hindered and the optimum conformation of 2T in the lowest triplet state is trans-planar. Such large changes in the CC bond lengths upon the 13Bu → X1Ag electronic transition are bound to cause strong vibronic activity in the region of about 1500 cm−1, where the normal modes that involve stretching of the carbon skeleton of 2T can be found. Little more can be said, however, without a detailed vibronic analysis, especially for the low-frequency normal modes constituted by C–H bendings, ring deformations and in-plane ring rotations.21Table 2 contains the complete list of the HR parameters for the totally-symmetric normal modes obtained using eqn (1) and based on calculations with the largest basis set feasible for the applied methods.

The Si values reveal considerable activity not only for the vibrations that involve the stretching of the CC bonds (ν1, ν2) but also for the two low-frequency normal modes – ν10 and ν11. Analysis of these latter vibrations in terms of the Potential Energy Distribution (PED) using the set of non-redundant internal coordinates, as proposed by Pulay, Fogarasi and co-workers,27–29 shows that ν10 involves mostly changes in the α6 angles (cf.Fig. 1), which lead to in-plane rotations of the rings with respect to one another. ν11 is predominantly the breathing motion of the thiophene rings mixed with some stretching of the CS bonds. These four vibrations dominate the fine structure of the phosphorescence spectrum of 2T (cf.Fig. 3). The remaining 8 normal modes are less important due to lower values of the HR factors. Nevertheless, they still account for 11% of the total reorganization energy (and consequently, of the phosphorescence bandwidth) and are thus not negligible even if most of the details of their vibronic activity may pass unnoticed in the medium resolution spectra.

5. The theoretical phosphorescence spectra
Each individual vibronic band that contributes to the theoretical spectra is represented as a Lorenz-type shape function with the width of 150 cm−1. The relative intensities of the vibronic bands are determined by the FC overlap integrals, available from the well-known recursion formulas30 using the computed HR parameters. Additionally, the intensity throughout the band is multiplied by the factor 3 to account for the fact that the intensity distribution in the emission spectrum is proportional to the third power of the emitted light, according to the relation:31,32 (2)in which A is the Einstein coefficient for the spontaneous emission, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, and μ represents the electric transition dipole moment. Evaluation of the transition dipole moment for the spin forbidden transition is not straightforward and falls beyond the scope of the present study, as we seek to rationalize the shape and width of the phosphorescence band rather than its absolute intensity.

Fig. 3 shows the calculated spectra for the selected quantum chemistry methods (B3LYP, CC2, and CASPT2) combined with the largest basis sets available for each of them (comparison with the spectra obtained using smaller basis sets is shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI†). It is evident at first glance that all of the spectra are very similar to one another. The fine structure is characterized by the same pattern determined by the strong activity of the ν1, ν2, ν10, and ν11 normal modes. The ν10 fundamental is responsible for the first strong peak (denoted as 2), whereas the dominating maximum (3) appears due to the overlap of the ν1, ν2 fundamental bands, and the second replica in FC progression of the ν10 normal mode. The following peak (4) consists mostly of the overlapping ν1 + ν10 and ν2 + ν10 bands. The only noticeable difference between them is in the width of the phosphorescence band, which follows the order of the reorganization energies: λB3LYPgr > λCC2gr > λCASPT2gr.
Such a similarity of the spectra obtained by three different quantum chemistry methods, including the state of the art ab initio calculations, is generally regarded as an indicator of high credibility of the applied methodology and of general accuracy of the theoretical predictions. In this context, dramatically large discrepancies observed between the calculated spectra and the experimental phosphorescence spectrum of Rentsch et al.8 (cf.Fig. 4) have come as an unexpected surprise. The experimental and calculated spectra agree reasonably well in the region between the onset and the global maximum. In the tail region (below 16500 cm−1), however, the predicted intensity is almost twice as high as the intensity observed experimentally. Note that the experimental spectrum shown in Fig. 4 has been transferred from the wavelength to the wave number domain using the following conversion factors: (3)

The observed deviations do not seem to arise from some physical mechanism of irradiative relaxation, as the T1 state of 2T is the lowest excited state of this molecule, and it is well isolated energetically from other states (the lowest excited singlet state is over 0.5 eV higher). Furthermore, in the presence of an irradiative channel the intensity loss would concern the whole spectrum rather than just its low-energy part. Therefore, we have turned to examine potential sources of errors that are related to the assumptions underlying the model of vibronic activity and to the approximations of the quantum chemistry methods.
First of all, the assumption of planarity of the 2T molecule needs to be discussed. For the T1 state it is naturally fulfilled as the planar conformation corresponds to the global minimum of the potential energy for the nuclei. For the ground state, on the other hand, the potential for the inter-ring torsion has two symmetric minima corresponding to the trans-gauche conformations, with the dihedral angle of about 155–160°. The energy barrier separating the minima is, however, extremely low (experimentally estimated at ≈25 cm−1).33
In such cases, the molecules in the gas phase can be regarded as dynamically planar,34 owing to high probability of tunneling through the barrier. In the solid phase, on the other hand, 2T molecules have been found to undergo either partial (in the frozen matrix35) or complete (in the crystal36) planarization, which is reflected in the absence of vibronic activity of the inter ring torsion in the fluorescence spectra of the matrix isolated 2T.37 Being determined by the activity of the in-plane normal modes the fine structure of the phosphorescence spectrum of 2T can thus be described with good accuracy assuming the planar geometry for both electronic states. Incidentally, allowing for conformational differences between the triplet state and the ground state would result in a considerable vibronic activity of the low-frequency inter-ring torsion, which would contribute to the theoretically predicted bandwidth shifting more intensity towards the low energy part of the spectrum, and further increasing the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and the experimental spectrum.
With the assumed planarity of 2T for both the ground state and the T1 state one usually resorts to the simple, projection-based model for vibronic analysis (vide supra). This model adopts the linear approximation to changes in the potential energy for nuclei caused by electronic deexcitation, neglecting the higher-order effects, such as Duschinsky rotation or changes in the vibrational frequencies. Success of the simple approach is based on the observation that these effects introduce only small corrections to the projection-based picture, and are therefore important only for interpretation of high-resolution spectra. In order to find out how strong their impact is in the specific case of the 2T phosphorescence, we have carried out the fully multidimensional Franck–Condon analysis (according to the iterative algorithm of Jankowiak et al.38) using the CC2 results as the input parameters. The resulting spectrum is almost identical to that obtained using the projection-based model (see Fig. S3c in the ESI†), which shows that the influence of the higher order effects is indeed negligibly small—the bandwidth and shape of the spectrum seem to depend primarily on the HR factors. In turn, the accuracy of the HR factors (eqn (1)) depends mainly on the quality of the molecular geometries and normal coordinates calculated for both states involved in the electronic transition (the errors related to using the rectilinear coordinate system have been found to be negligible by comparing thus obtained HR factors with their counterparts calculated using the curvilinear coordinates, as implemented in the DUSHIN program of Reimers et al.39).
As far as the quantum chemistry results are concerned, we focus our analysis on the ab initio methods, as the DFT methodology does not offer a systematic way to control the quality of calculations. Rather, based on accumulated experience and benchmark studies, various DFT functionals are designated to particular aspects of chemistry for selected classes of compounds. Incidentally, the B3LYP functional is renowned for its good performance for organic systems, but its accuracy for excited triplet states is not yet well established. For the ab initio methods, on the other hand, there is usually a well defined hierarchy of models that in principle guarantee increased accuracy of calculations. In the realm of coupled clusters, the CC2 method is followed by a more elaborate (and potentially better) CCSD and CCSD(T) models. The CASPT2 method, on the other hand, can be improved upon either by extending the active space that determines the underlying zeroth-order (CASSCF) wavefunction or by using a higher order perturbation theory to account for dynamic electron correlation effects. Note, however, that for the purpose of this study we have already selected the best methods applicable for systems of the size of 2T. Therefore, the range of possible improvements is rather limited.
Our tests of various modifications of the π–π* active space (55, 56, 65, 66, 67, or 58), concerning the multireference calculations, have shown that they have virtually no effect on the theoretical phosphorescence spectra. Higher order multireference perturbation treatment (e.g. CASPT3) could not be used for 2T even with the smallest, valence active space (55) because of its prohibitively high computational requirements. We have been able, however, to perform geometry optimizations of 2T for both the ground state and the 13Bu excited state using the full CCSD model (EOM-CCSD in the case of the excited state) combined with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. The normal modes required for vibronic analysis could not be obtained at that level of theory and have been taken from B3LYP/aug-cc-pVQZ calculations instead. Methodological inconsistency of such an approach may seem suspect, but the literature reports,21 our previous experience,22 and the test calculations concerning 2T (cf. Fig. S3a of the ESI†) prove that the combined scheme actually works very well, which validates the comparison of the spectra based on the CC2 and CCSD geometries. We have found out, however, that going from CC2 to the more complete model (CCSD) is again of little significance (cf. Fig. S3b of the ESI†). If anything, the latter method yields a slightly broader spectrum than the former. Such small changes to the spectrum obtained at the CC2 level of theory show that for the electronic states that are described predominantly by the singly excited configurations this method offers high accuracy (comparable with that of the full CCSD model) for both the excitation energies16 and the molecular geometries. On that view, we do not expect that inclusion of the higher order terms of the cluster expansion would bring significant changes to the optimized geometries, and consequently to the predicted phosphorescence spectra of 2T. We therefore have to conclude that the observed deviations of our theoretical predictions from the experiment cannot be attributed to deficiencies of the model for the N-electronic wavefunction.
6. Experimental spectrum
Unable to pinpoint the source of the observed discrepancies in the theoretical methodology used in this study, we have taken a closer look at the potential sources of experimental uncertainties. Firstly, the energy region in which 2T phosphorescence is observed lies on the verge of the working range of typical R928 detectors, the inherent sensitivity of which strongly decreases for low energies (λ > 600 nm). This should be compensated for by calibration, but the sensitivity loss may not always be entirely removed. Secondly, the low phosphorescence intensity of 2T may cause problems with separation of the signal from the background noise, and without using high concentrations of 2T the recorded spectra may have a wide error margin, especially after removing the background. On this view, we have decided to measure anew the phosphorescence of 2T taking special care of the above-mentioned issues. 2,2′-bithiophene was purchased from Acros Organics. The solvents used for phosphorescence measurements, namely methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and both are of spectroscopic grade.
The quartz tube containing the sample of 2,2′-bithiophene dissolved in the MeOH–EtOH 1:1 mixture was placed in the cryostat and cooled down with liquid nitrogen thus enabling measurements at 77 K. The steady-state measurements of the phosphorescence were performed using a FluoroMax 4 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba) equipped with a 150 W ozone-free flash xenon lamp with 3 μs pulse width (FWHM). The spectra were collected from the signals recorded in the short intervals delayed by 0.1 ms with respect to the excitation flash in order to eliminate contribution from fluorescence. The excitation was performed at 300 nm and the possible light scattering and reflections were suppressed using a 435 cut-off filter. Prior to the measurements the detector was calibrated in the 300–800 nm range using the Fluka kit of Fluorescence Spectral Standards. On account of the low quantum yield of phosphorescence and decreasing sensitivity of the detector in the range of the measured emission, relatively high concentration of 2T (0.001 M) had to be used to obtain spectra of satisfactory quality.
Our experimental spectrum of 2T is presented in Fig. 5 against the theoretically calculated ones. The experimental spectrum shows resolution typical for the measurements in the liquid nitrogen temperature, comparable with the resolution of the spectrum reported previously.8 The currently presented spectrum, however, is in nearly quantitative agreement with the theoretical ones. It is slightly wider than the spectrum based on the CASPT2 calculations, and somewhat narrower than the DFT-based one. The closest match is observed for the spectrum simulated using the CC2 results, which practically coincides with the experimental one. Only the 0–0 band and the fundamental bands of the ν10 and ν11 normal modes have slightly overshot intensities. It appears that the peculiar, non-Condon shape of the spectrum reported by Rentsch et al.8 is an experimental artifact most likely caused by the reduced sensitivity of the detector in the long-wavelength region. Our experience indicates that in such cases relatively high concentrations of the chromophore have to be used, and careful recalibration of the detector should be carried out prior to measurements. Work is currently underway in our laboratory to measure the phosphorescence of 2T and similar compounds in the liquid helium temperatures, which would shed more light on the vibronic activity related to this electronic transition. Nonetheless, the excellent performance of the CC2 method for modeling the phosphorescence of 2T can already be highlighted, based on the nearly quantitative reproduction of the adiabatic energy of the T1 state, as well as the width, shape and fine structure of the available phosphorescence band.
 Fig. 5  The experimental phosphorescence spectrum of 2T (this work) compared with the simulated spectra based on the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVQZ, CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CC2/aug-cc-pVQZ calculations. 
In addition, a more general although a bit obvious truth comes to mind: improved approximations and more advanced computational tools lead to more reliable results, just as should be expected.
