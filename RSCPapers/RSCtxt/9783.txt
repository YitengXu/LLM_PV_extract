The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and increasing environmental concerns have led to increased demands for alternative clean energy sources.1 Hydrogen is a promising clean chemical fuel for sustainable energy applications.2 Electrolysis of water is a simple way to produce hydrogen on a large scale. To make hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) more energy-efficient, usually requires using an advanced electrocatalyst to drive a large current density at a low overpotential (η). Currently, the state-of-the-art HER catalysts consist of platinum or platinum-based materials2b,3 but the scarcity and high cost of platinum limit their uses. In particular, the most popular proton exchange membrane (PEM) based HER technology requires strong acidic conditions and thus acidic stability of the HER catalysts becomes very critical.4 Although abundant nickel-based materials are efficient catalysts toward HER, they are not stable in acidic solutions.5 This limitation has stimulated significant effort towards the fabrication of non-noble metal HER catalysts suitable for acidic media and progress has been made in recent years, in which compounds based on Fe-group elements, Mo, W including their sulfides, selenides, carbides, borides, and nitrides have received considerable attention.6 Moreover, great efforts have been made to develop cobalt-based complexes.7 Recent research has indeed improved the successful uses of Co2P,7d CoP/CNT7e and CoP7f as highly efficient HER catalysts.
Iron has the advantages of cost and availability. [FeS]-hydrogenases using Fe at their active sites are remarkably active in hydrogen evolution8 but their catalytic activity suffers in an oxygen environment and scale-up production.9 Much effort has been made to design synthetic molecular metal complexes that mimic the properties of the aforementioned enzymes.10 However, most of these complexes usually suffer from high overpotential and/or poor stability.11 Rational design of a solid-state nanoscale inorganic Fe compound to tailor its nanostructures or/and to select its complexing element could overcome shortcomings.12 Giovanni et al. hydrothermally prepared FeS nanoparticles as HER catalysts, exhibiting a mild overpotential under neutral conditions.13 Xu et al. further used anion-exchange to synthesize FeP nanosheets for good HER activity in acidic solutions but the approach was not able to suitably control the compound nanostructure and morphology of the compound for a further improvement of the catalytic efficiency.14 In addition, to produce an electrode for electrochemical evaluation or practical applications in the previously mentioned work, a polymer binder like nafion or PTFE is needed to attach the catalysts on a current collector, which is time-consuming and the polymer binder increases the electron transfer/transport resistance, blocks active sites and inhibits mass transport, thus leading to reduced catalytic activity.15
In this work, for the first time, we use a novel approach to fabricate self-supported FeP nanorod arrays on a HCl-treated Ti foil (FeP NAs/Ti) via low-temperature phosphidation of α-FeO(OH) NAs/Ti precursor. When the as-prepared FeP NAs/Ti was directly used as a novel HER cathode in acidic electrolytes, it exhibited an onset overpotential of 65 mV, a Tafel slope of 60 mV per decade, and a faradaic yield (FY) close to 100%. In particular, overpotentials of only 85 and 183 mV were required to drive current densities of 10 and 240 mA cm−2, respectively, while preserving constant catalytic activity for at least 10 h. In comparison to the only reported work on FeP to date,13 our accomplishment not only demonstrates superior catalytic performances toward HER, but also offers a novel universal approach to delicately control the nanostructure and morphology of the compound for broad applications.
During preparation, the α-FeO(OH) NAs/Ti precursor16 was innovatively low-temperature phosphidated to produce FeP NAs/Ti. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the precursor and phosphidated product, scratched down from Ti. The precursor was identified as goethite [JCPDS no. 29-0713], which is consistent with a previous report.17 After phosphidation, several peaks are observed at 32.8°, 37.2°, 46.3°, 46.9°, 48.4°, 56.1° and 59.7° to correspond to (011), (111), (112), (202), (211), (212) and (020) facets of FeP, respectively (JCPDS no. 65-2595). All these results clearly confirm the chemical conversion of α-FeO(OH) to FeP after the phosphidation reaction.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 2A) suggests a rough surface of the Ti foil after the HCl treatment. The inset in Fig. 2A further reveals that the rough surface consists of nanoflame-like structures. Before the acid treatment, the Ti foil had a flat surface with some cavities (Fig. S1†). Fig. 2B presents the SEM image of α-FeO(OH) NAs/Ti, illustrating that the whole surface of the Ti foil is uniformly coated with α-FeO(OH) nanorod arrays, while after phosphidation the color of α-FeO(OH) NAs/Ti changes from brown to black (Fig. S2†) and no other obvious morphological change of α-FeO(OH) NAs can be seen (Fig. 2C). The resulting FeP NAs are spread apart adequately to form a highly open structure. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum suggests the atomic ratio between Fe and P is nearly 1:1 (Fig. S3†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of such FeP nanorods shows that they have diameters in the range of 40–100 nm and lengths of about several hundreds of nanometers. Moreover, these nanorods are rich in nanopores arising from the dehydration and subsequent phase transition.18 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2E) shows discrete spots indexed to (011), (020), (111), (112), (202), (211), and (212) planes of the FeP structure. Fig. 2F reveals two sets of lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of about 0.242 and 0.273 nm, corresponding to (111) and (011) planes of the FeP phase, respectively. The scanning TEM (STEM) and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. 2G) further show that both P and Fe elements are uniformly distributed within the FeP nanorods.

The as-prepared FeP NAs/Ti was directly used as a hydrogen evolution cathode in a typical three electrode cell setup with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S4,† the results with and without Ar purging confirm that the HER is not sensitive to O2. This could be ascribed to the much faster reduction rate of H2 than that of O2 in a competitive reaction mode at the same electrode. For comparison, the bare HCl-treated Ti foil and the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) were also examined. A resistance test was also performed and an iR compensation was applied for all electrochemical measurements. Fig. 3A shows the corresponding polarization curves. The Pt/C shows excellent HER activity with near zero overpotential. Although the Ti foil exhibits negligible HER activity in the applied voltage range, FeP NAs/Ti is highly active toward the HER with an onset overpotential of 65 mV. When a more negative potential is applied, the cathodic current rises rapidly. The high HER activity for this electrode obviously comes from FeP NAs. To produce a current density of 240 mA cm−2, an overpotential of just 183 mV is required. Thus, FeP NAs/Ti offers exceptional catalytic performances to generate a much higher current density for HER even higher than the commercial Pt catalyst at a relatively high overpotential. For practical application, it is very meaningful to compare the requiring η to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is a parameter relevant to solar fuel synthesis.19 For FeP nanosheets,14 a small Tafel slope of 67 mV per decade, a positive onset potential of 100 mV vs. RHE, and 10 mA cm−1 at the potential of ∼240 mV were observed. For our FeP NAs, the overpotential requiring to drive a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER is about 85 mV, which is the best in comparison to all the reported non-Pt HER electrocatalysts, operating in acidic solutions, including FeP nanosheets,14 CoSe2 nanoparticles on carbon fiber paper,7c Ni2P/Ti,20 and 3D porous MoSx electrodes (Table S1†).21 Moreover, the onset overpotential of our catalyst is also the lowest among all the reported non-Pt HER electrocatalysts, thus demonstrating the best electrocatalytic activity (Table S1†).6,14,19–21

To obtain scientific insight for the FeP NAs/Ti, Tafel plots on FeP NAs/Ti and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) were investigated. The linear regions of the Tafel plots (Fig. 3B) fit well to the Tafel equation η = blogj + a, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope. The Tafel slope is an inherent property of an electrocatalyst that is determined from the rate-limiting step of HER.22 As shown in Fig. 3C a Tafel slope of 60 mV per decade suggests that the hydrogen production on FeP NAs/Ti is based on the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism,23 for which the rate determining step is the reaction of a proton with Hads, by taking a second electron from the catalyst to the electrode to generate H2 (Fig. 4).24

To estimate the intrinsic activity, the turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated by quantifying the active sites by an electrochemical approach.25 The calculated number of the active sites for FeP NAs/Ti is 7.33 × 10−9 mol. Fig. S5B† shows the polarization curves normalized by the active sites and expressed in terms of TOF (see ESI for details†). To reach a TOF value of 2.58 s−1, FeP NAs/Ti needs an overpotential of 85 mV (corresponding to 10 mA cm−2). A turnover number (TON) of 160.8 was calculated at the controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) of 85 mV vs. RHE for 10 h (see Fig. S6 in ESI for details†). All these results can explain the exceptional HER performance of FeP NAs/Ti.
To probe the durability of the catalyst in an acidic environment, we cycled the catalyst continuously for 1000 cyclic voltammetric (CV) cycles between 0.28 and −0.17 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 5, the current density of FeP NAs/Ti decreases only slightly after the continuous 1000 cycles, indicating that the FeP NAs/Ti exhibits an excellent HER activity with reasonable long-term stability. Furthermore, the practical operation of the catalyst was examined by electrolysis at fixed potentials over extended periods,19 in which the FeP NAs/Ti was tested at a constant overpotential of 100 mV vs. RHE for 10 h. The results showed a loss in catalytic activity that might be caused by catalyst poisoning or by the delamination of the catalyst from the electrode.26 Moreover, the FeP NAs/Ti electrode exhibits nearly 100% faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution (Fig. S7†).
 Fig. 5  Durability test for FeP NAs/Ti showing only a slight current loss after 1000 CV cycles between 0.28 and −0.17 V vs. RHE at 50 mV s−1 (inset: time-dependent curve of FeP NAs/Ti under static overpotential of 100 mV for 10 h). 
The high HER activity as well as excellent stability of FeP NAs might reasonably be attributed to three aspects as follows. Firstly, the direct integration of FeP NAs on the HCl-treated Ti foil enables good mechanical adhesion and electrical connection between the two. Secondly, the good intrinsic electrical conductivity of FeP27 favors fast electron transport along the nanorod. Furthermore, its 3D porous configuration allows for the easy diffusion of the electrolyte and thus for a more efficient utilization of active sites in FeP NAs.28
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-prepared FeP in Fig. S8† reveals the presence of Fe 3p, P 2p, P 2s, C 1s, O 1s and Fe 2p. The standard C 1s peak is used as a reference for correcting the shifts. The presence of O 1s is caused by the absorbed and oxidized species.29 Fig. S8A and B† show the XPS 2p spectra in the Fe(2p) and P(2p) regions for the FeP sample. The doublet peaks for the binding energy (BE) of Fe 2p3/2 and P 2p appear at 707.2 and 711.6 eV and at 129.3 and 133.8 eV, respectively. The peaks at 707.2 and 129.3 eV are close to the BE for Fe and P in FeP.30 The peaks at 711.6 and 133.8 eV can be attributed to oxidized Fe and P species, resulting from the superficial oxidation of FeP exposed to air.31 The presence of oxidized species in the samples is probably due to two processes: the separation of products in the air after the reaction, which can lead to surface oxidization of nanoscale phosphides due to absorbed gaseous molecules. This is often observed in nanomaterials,32 indicated by the close-up oxygen XPS spectrum and oxidization of phosphides by residual oxygen in the sealed tube during the reaction.29 Fe 2p BE of 707.2 eV exhibits a positive shift from that of Fe metal (706.9 eV) while the P 2p BE of 129.3 eV exhibits a negative shift from that of elemental P (130.2 eV).33 This suggests that Fe and P in FeP have partially positive and partially negative charges, respectively, to generate electron transfer from Fe to P.30,31,34 It is known that a metal complex HER catalyst incorporates protons from pendant acid-base groups positioned close to the metal center, where hydrogen production occurs for hydrogenases.35 Because the FeP surface also has the pendant P base in close proximity to the Fe metal center, it is reasonable to argue that FeP may share a similar catalytic mechanism to hydrogenases and metal complex catalysts toward the HER.36 In particular, the role of P in FeP should be similar with Ni2P,36 which is associated with an ensemble effect caused by the presence of P for facilitating the HER. It is very likely that the oxide species observed from XPS could also decrease the concentration of highly active Fe due to a stronger ensemble effect. It is noteworthy that FeP is very stable in various pH solutions, which is confirmed by CV measurements, as in Fig. S9,† in which no redox peaks are observed, indicating that neither Fe nor P are electrochemically dissolved.
In summary, for the first time, a simple and facile method to produce electroactive FeP NAs catalysts on a HCl-treated Ti foil as an effective hydrogen evolution cathode is accomplished, demonstrating the best electrocatalytic activity among all reported non-Pt HER electrocatalysts, while offering an innovative method to synthesize metal complexes with well-controlled nanostructure and morphology. Since the catalyst is made of considerably cheaper and more abundant elements with high electrocatalytic activity, it holds great promise for its practical application to produce hydrogen.
