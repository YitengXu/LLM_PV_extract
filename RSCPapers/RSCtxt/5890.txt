    , Accepted 30th March 2021First published on 31st March 2021AbstractDiscrete oligomers are perfect candidates for understanding the structure-dependent properties of polymers. Herein, a series of discrete conjugated oligo(fluorenediacetylene)s (D-oFDAs) with a degree of polymerization (DP) up to 10 were obtained by purification with automated flash column chromatography from polydisperse polymers. It is found that the chain length can affect not only photophysical properties but also crystalline properties. As the DP of D-oFDAs increased, the longer conjugation length caused red shifts in their optical spectra and weaker crystallinity. The effective conjugation length has been extrapolated to be as long as 9 fluorenediacetylene units. Moreover, the oligomers can form uniform films by solution casting for the fabrication of light-emitting diodes, showing that the octamer has the most efficient electroluminescence (EL) properties. When the crystal of the dimer was exposed to 254 nm UV light, only part of the sample was polymerized via a 1,4-addition reaction. Significantly, the simple, scalable and effective strategy provides opportunities to further optimize the structure with diverse blocks and side chains for precisely building macromolecular architectures.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers are a kind of very important organic photoelectric material which are widely applied in organic light-emitting diodes,1 solar cells,2 field effect transistors3 and photoelectric detection.4 Recent development has been directed toward the precise control over the structural properties of conjugated polymers such as the chain-length dependent optical properties of polymers. Small differences in the length and/or dispersity of conjugated polymers have shown significant effects on their physical properties and optical behavior,5–7 especially for those with a degree of polymerization below their effective conjugation length.8–10 Although controlled polymerization has been widely used in the synthesis of well-defined polymers,11–13 these polymers are still a statistical mixture of various molecular weights. As a result, the performance of conjugated polymers reflects a broad distribution of species and not individual, discrete components.
In principle, discrete polymers with uniform chain lengths and chemical structures are ideal models in deep and detailed studies of the structure–property relationship from a fundamental understanding of the parent oligomers such as dimers, tetramers, octamers, etc. However, the preparation of synthetic polymers with a precise structure, composition and function is a great challenge for macromolecular chemists. To date, several stepwise synthesis strategies have been proposed to access discrete polymers including the linear iterative method consisting of successive chain-end functionalization and monomer coupling reaction design by the development of click chemistry.14–17 Moreover, iterative exponential growth (IEG), which relies on orthogonal deprotection and coupling of bifunctional building blocks, is easier to achieve macromolecules with high degrees of polymerization in a relatively few cycles.18–21 Although these methods have been successfully applied to synthesize discrete polymers, they remain unsuitable for preparing large-scale libraries of polymers due to their multi-step and time-consuming nature.22–24 In order to overcome these difficulties, some alternative strategies have been proposed, including stepwise addition by insertion of single monomer units and separation of disperse oligomer mixtures. The former has been generally successful but it is difficult to achieve high chain lengths.25–27 The latter was first reported via recycling size-exclusion chromatography (rec-SEC)28 and then improved via a versatile and scalable strategy based on automated flash column chromatography (FCC) proposed by Hawker and coworkers.29,30 FCC can be employed for gram-scale separation and has become a powerful technique for the synthesis of discrete polymers. This general strategy provides excellent opportunities to design materials and macromolecular architectures with accurate control over molecular weights and chain ends.
Polyfluorenes (PFs), as typical conjugated polymers, have been widely applied as attractive blue luminescent materials due to their good thermal and electrochemical stability, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, effective charge transfer, wide band gap, and facile functionalization at the C-9 position of the fluorene unit.31,32 Driven by the great advantage of discrete polymers for understanding of the intrinsic properties, the study and establishment of chain length−property correlations of different conjugated systems have attracted much attention for fabricating high performance optoelectronic devices.33–35 Geng et al. synthesized a series of discrete oligo (9,9-dioctylfluorene)s and oligo (9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-2,7-vinylene)s via an iterative approach.36,37 Tsutsui et al. have also reported the synthesis and photophysical properties of oligo (fluoreneethynylene)s with fluorene units up to 5. It has been demonstrated that the preparation of discrete polymers plays a significant role in investigating the length-dependent properties of conjugated polymers.
Previous studies have demonstrated that compounds containing diacetylene (DA) moieties can undergo a so-called topochemical polymerization via a 1,4-addition reaction when heated or exposed to 254 nm UV light.38 Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are a unique class of conjugated polymers with interesting optical features; the color of PDAs can be changed from blue to red by the stimulus of heat, pH, pressure and chemicals.39–41 Therefore PDA-based sensors and electronics have attracted broad attention for the development of smart materials. Herein, we expect to introduce DAs into oligo (9,9-dioctylfluorene)s to make discrete oligo(fluorenediacetylene)s for better performance of PF-based materials.42–44
In this paper, a series of discrete oligo(fluorenediacetylene)s (D-oFDAs) were synthesized via the Glaser coupling polymerization followed by purification with automated flash column chromatography. To increase the chromatographic resolution, the starting monomer was designed as bi-FDA having two fluorenediacetylene units as shown in Scheme 1, which enabled the separation of oligo-fluorenediacetylene mixtures up to 10 repeating units. Furthermore, their photophysical, crystalline, and electroluminescence properties and topochemical polymerization were studied in detail. Then, we studied the crystal structure to interpret the reason why only part of the sample was polymerized via the 1,4-addition reaction.

Experimental section
Materials
Cuprous chloride (CuCl; 97%; Macklin) was first washed with excess hydrochloric acid, followed by ethanol and ether, and then dried in a vacuum. 2-Bromo-7-iodifluorene (99%; Aladdin), bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) chloride (98%; Aladdin), 1-bromooctane (99%; Energy-chemical), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA; 99%, Adamas), triphenylphosphine (99%, Adamas), copper(I) iodide (99.5%, Aladdin), 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (98%; Macklin), tert-butyl(ethynyl)dimethylsilane (95%; Aladdin), and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF; 1.0 mol L−1 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Energy-chemical) were used as received. All solvents in this article were dried with activated molecular sieves before use. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China and used as received.
Characterization
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as the solvent with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The 1H NMR spectra were referenced to δ 7.26 ppm in CDCl3 or δ 2.50 ppm in DMSO-d6. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of the polymers were determined using a TOSOH HLC-8320 size exclusion chromatography system equipped with refractive-index and UV detectors using two TSKgel Super Multipore HZ-N (4.6 × 150 mm, 3 μm bead size) columns arranged in series, and it can separate polymers in the molecular weight range from 500–1.9 × 105 g mol−1. THF was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.35 mL min−1 at 40 °C. Data acquisition was performed using EcoSEC software, and molecular weights were calculated with polystyrene (PS) standards. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry measurement was performed using a Bruker Autoflex III (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. Ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The light source used for the optical response test was a diode pumped solid state laser (DPSSL), purchased from LASEVER INC. The model of the green laser is LSR532NL-500, with 532 nm wavelength and 500 mW maximum output power, and the beam diameter on the sample was 4 mm. The model of the blue laser is LSR405NL-250, with 405 nm wavelength and 250 mW maximum output power, and the beam diameter on the sample was 8 mm. The fluorescence emission spectra of the samples in trichloromethane (CHCl3) at a concentration of 0.00125 mg mL−1 were obtained on a HITACHI F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted with a TA Instruments DSC 250 equipped with a refrigerating machine at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The samples with a typical mass of about 4 mg were encapsulated in sealed aluminum pans. The surface morphology was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode (Veeco Instruments Inc., Nanoscope IV). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI760E electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The oligomer concentration was 3.5 × 10−4 mol L−1 of the repeating unit. A platinum (Pt) electrode with a diameter of 2 mm, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The potential was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl in CH2Cl2). HOMO energy levels were estimated using the equation: HOMO = −(4.36 + Eonsetoxd). Electroluminescence devices were fabricated and characterized following a previous publication.45 Automatic flash chromatography of the oligomers was performed on a SepaBean™ machine, using a Sepa-Flash Silica Flash Column, eluting with suitable solvent pairs. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements on 2F8-DA-2Br were performed on a Bruker Smart CPAD area diffractometer with a nitrogen-flow temperature controller using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation at 120 K. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-2014 and the refinement against all reflections of the compound was performed using SHELXL-2014. The crystallographic data for compounds 2F8-DA-2Br are listed in Table S3.†
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of discrete oligomers
The dimer monomer bi-FDA with two end alkynyls was successfully synthesized for a following polymerization via the efficient Glaser coupling reaction to obtain the oligomer with fluorene-diacetylene repeating units. As shown in Scheme S1,† the dimer bi-FDA was obtained via a five-step process. The disperse oligo-fluorenediacetylene mixtures were prepared via the Glaser coupling reaction of bi-FDA in the initial synthesis, followed by automated separation to afford multiple discrete oligomers. Herein, bi-FDA was found to be an optimized monomer of polymerization to allow well resolved separation of oligomer mixtures. The polymerization via the Glaser coupling reaction was conducted using cuprous chloride (CuCl) as a catalyst and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) as a base in the presence of oxygen (Scheme 1).46 Because of the poor solubility of bi-FDA in highly polar solvents, different solvents were tested in the Glaser coupling polymerization. Eventually, an optimized DMF/THF mixed solvent system was selected for a well-controlled DP and for improving the efficiency of the subsequent automated separation, in which DMF as a poor solvent can inhibit the conversion of oligomers into polymers with a high molecular weight and THF as a good solvent can increase the reaction conversion of the monomer. The detailed experimental procedures are shown in the ESI.† The composition and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the resultant oligomer mixture were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass (MALDI-TOF) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses, respectively (Fig. S1†). In the MALDI-TOF spectrum, each mass species was separated by 873.3 g mol−1 corresponding to two fluorenediacetylene (bi-FDA) repeating units, and the isolation of discrete species up to decamer was shown. The SEC elution curve of the oligomer mixture was multimodal and the molecular weight of each peak calculated by SEC (Mn,SEC) was in good agreement with that of discrete oligo(fluorenediacetylene) species. Automated flash column chromatography was used for the separation of the mixture from the Glaser coupling polymerization in the initial synthesis to afford a library of discrete oligomers with the DP from 4 to 10. In this work, careful optimization of solvent conditions (eluent mobile phase) must be carried out to achieve well-resolved separation of oligomer distributions. Successfully, a petroleum ether/chloroform (0–20% v/v chloroform) gradient as an eluent was employed, enabling the isolation of D-oFDAs with DP = 4, 6, 8 and 10 at significantly low dispersity. The details are given in Fig. S2 and Table S1.† Notably, this strategy allows highly efficient synthesis toward the discrete conjugated polymer D-oFDAs compared to the iterative chain-growth strategy. The resulting discrete oligomer library in a single step was carefully characterized by 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF and SEC analyses (Fig. 1). In the 1H NMR spectra, based on the integrations of fluorenyl protons at 7.65–7.50 ppm and the protons of the terminal alkyne at 3.16 ppm, the relative ratio of the protons increased from 24:2 to 36:2, 48:2 and arrived to 60:2 eventually, corresponding to each constituent species with the DP.

As expected, sharp monomodal SEC elution curves at a significantly low dispersity were observed for all D-oFDAs (Fig. 1b), and the present single mass peak matching with the calculated values was observed in MALDI-TOF (Fig. 1c). All results confirmed the successful and clean separation of polydisperse D-oFDAs to discrete oligomers, from the tetramer to the decamer.
Photophysical properties
To investigate the influence of chain length on the photophysical properties of conjugated oligomers D-oFDAs, UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of D-oFDAs with different DPs were recorded in chloroform (CHCl3) and in the thin film, as shown in Fig. 2 and S11.† The uniform thin films of D-oFDAs were prepared via drop casting on glass substrates from dilute chloroform solutions. The maxima of absorption and emission of D-oFDAs are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the oligomers exhibited a broadened absorption peak in comparison with oligo (9,9-dialkylfluorene)s (OFs), because diacetylene repeated units were incorporated alternately into the polyfluorene main chain leading to an increase in conjugation length. The distinct absorption peak at 392 nm for the dimer can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated main chain.47 The conjugation length leads to a red shift of absorption peaks with increasing repeating unit. In particular, a significant red shift was observed from a dimer to a tetramer, so that it was necessary to supplement the properties of a trimer for a detailed gradient observation. The trimer was synthesized independently, and the structure was confirmed by characterization (NMR, SEC and mass spectrometry) (Fig. S12†). In contrast to the absorption, the emission of oligomers in solution showed well-resolved PL spectra. The emission peaks at 398, 422 and 435 nm corresponded to three absorption peaks which were assigned to the 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 transitions.36 The fluorescence intensity of D-oFDAs in the thin film was much lower than the ones in the solution due to aggregation-caused quenching. The maxima of absorption and emission in the film were similar to those in solution, which showed a bathochromic shift with increasing conjugation length from the dimer to the tetramer (Fig. S11† and Table 1). The PL quantum yield (Φ) was determined in THF using diphenylanthracene as a standard, which was in the range of 0.75–0.86, indicating that oFDAs were also efficient emissive species (Table 1).

Effective conjugation length (ECL) is an important concept for understanding the chain-length-dependent properties of conjugated polymers.37 The maximum wavelength of absorption and emission of D-oFDAs changed with the number of fluorenediacetylene units (n) (Fig. 2). As shown in Table 1, the maximum values of absorption and emission demonstrated an obvious red shift from 392 and 398 nm for the dimer to 420 and 430 nm for the decamer, respectively. It was found that the red shift of oligomers became lower and even unchanged with the increase of the chain length. To confirm whether the absorption maximum of the decamer reached the convergent limit with the increase of molecular weight, the disperse PFDA with an Mn,SEC of 12000 g mol−1 was synthesized by polycondensation of bi-FDA for comparison (the synthetic route to PFDA is shown in Scheme S1b†). The absorption maximum of PFDA in the solution and thin film was consistent with that of the decamer. Meier et al. defined the ECL as the conjugation length in which the solution absorption maximum in the series of oligomers was not more than 1 nm above the lower limit, which is given by the infinitely long polymer chain.8 Based on this definition, the ECL of D-oFDAs should be as long as 10 repeating units. In addition, another method of determining ECL is to extrapolate the linear region of the plot of absorption energies or wavenumber vs. the inverse of repeating units of a series of oligomers.8,36,37,48,49 According to this method, the ECL of D-oFDAs was determined to be 9 repeating units (Fig. 2c), similar to that of OFs, which is lower than the ECL from the first method.
Electroluminescence properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in combination with absorption spectroscopy was carried out to estimate the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of the oligomers (Fig. S13†). As listed in Table 2, with the increase of the chain length, the HOMO levels increased, but the LUMO levels had a little change, leading to a smaller bandgap. Moreover, the HOMO energy levels were higher than that of OFs (−5.8 eV),36 indicating easier hole-injection than that of OFs in the typical light emitting diode structure. In order to investigate the electroluminescence (EL) properties of D-oFDAs, we applied the dimer, tetramer, hexamer and octamer for the fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LED) with a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT: PSS, 50 nm)/oFDAs (70 nm)/Ca/Al. The decamer was not measured due to the poor solubility and film-forming properties. Device performance measurements were carried out in air without any encapsulation. It was found that all oligomers except for the dimer emitted bluish-green electroluminescence according to the Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates, which are (0.23, 0.33) for the tetramer, (0.25, 0.27) for the hexamer and (0.26, 0.33) for the octamer. For the dimer, both the electroluminescence spectrum and CIE coordinates indicated that it emitted green electroluminescence, which can be attributed to the oxidative degradation of PF. In general, the intermolecular interactions of PF can give rise to excimer emission in the solid state and promoted the green band emission.50,51 The green band emission of the dimer was more obvious than other oligomers due to the best crystallinity resulting in stronger intermolecular interactions. The octamer exhibited a red-shifted electroluminescence spectrum compared to that of the tetramer and hexamer due to the increase of the repeating unit, as shown in Fig. 3a, which was similar to the counterparts of the PL spectrum. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3b, the devices turn on at a voltage of 16.1 V, 15.0 V, 14 V and 10 V for the dimer, tetramer, hexamer and octamer, respectively. When the voltage was increased to 20 V, the devices for the oligomers showed the maximum brightness. The octamer had a maximum brightness of 170 cd m−2 and a current efficiency of 0.18 cd A−1 at a brightness of 90 cd m−2, and the hexamer had a maximum brightness of 80 cd m−2 and a current efficiency of 0.08 cd A−1. Similarly, the tetramer had a maximum brightness of 48 cd m−2 and a current efficiency of 0.09 cd A−1, and the dimer had a maximum brightness of 30 cd m−2 and a current efficiency of 0.04 cd A−1. By contrast, the devices based on the octamer exhibited the best device performance. This may be ascribed to that the octamer can form more robust films due to the higher molecular weight and easier hole injection due to a higher HOMO level.36

Crystallinity
As we know, polyfluorenes are semi-crystalline with a melting temperature near 160 °C, above which a nematic (N) phase exists up to ca. 300 °C.52 Similarly, we can speculate the presence of crystallization in the oFDAs, and hence the investigation on the chain-length dependent crystallization behavior of oFDAs is clearly needed. Usually, crystallizable polymers can show a glass transition peak, a crystallization exothermal peak and a melting endothermal peak in succession in the DSC heating curve. However, the observation in the DSC curves of D-oFDAs showed neither exothermal peaks nor endothermal peaks (Fig. S14†), which may be attributed to the topochemical polymerization of the diacetylene (DA) unit between the conjugated chains of D-oFDAs.44 Thus it is difficult to characterize the crystallization behavior of the oligomers by DSC. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement can also help in knowing the presence of the crystallized state of polymers. The powder samples of oligomers (dimer, tetramer, hexamer and octamer) were examined by XRD. A series of sharp diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD spectra (Fig. S15†), illustrating the crystalline nature of D-oFDAs. From the XRD spectra, we noticed that the diffraction peaks of D-oFDAs became weaker and broader as the molecular weight increased. In the samples of the hexamer and octamer, only one weaker diffraction peak was detected at 2θ = 6.84° and 6.74°, respectively. Moreover, all oligomers showed Maltese-cross birefringence patterns when viewed under a polarized optical microscope (POM) (Fig. 4). It was observed that the dimer and tetramer demonstrated a more obvious birefringence phenomenon than that of the other two oligomers. Furthermore, some regular geometric shapes can be seen from the dimer and tetramer in Fig. 4a and b, which was in good agreement with the XRD spectra, further showing that the dimer and tetramer have better crystallization properties than the hexamer and octamer. It was indicated that increasing molecular weight led to a weaker reflection and a lower crystallinity.49,53 Meanwhile, a well-organized lamellar crystal can be obtained from the dimer by slowly evaporating from the oligomer solution in THF with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 under a certain solvent pressure in a closed jar. The schematic diagram of the device for preparing crystals is shown in Fig. S16.† The images of the obtained dimer crystals were observed by optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), showing that the crystals had the dimensions of 20–60 μm in length, 15–20 μm in width (Fig. 4e and f), and 1–3 μm in height (Fig. 4g and h). The optical anisotropy of the crystals was clearly observed under polarized light (Fig. 4f). It is a pity that this lamellar crystal cannot be produced from other oligomers via the solvent evaporation method above, due to the poor crystallinity as the molecular weight increased.

Topochemical polymerization
Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are a class of π-conjugated polymers with unique properties, which can be obtained from 1,4-polymerization of diacetylenes (DAs) under the stimulation of UV light or annealing.54 Therefore, it is possible that the 1,4-addition polymerization of D-oFDAs would occur based on the diacetylene units in the conjugated chain.
In view of which polymerization occurs at the 1,4-position to give PDAs when adjacent diacetylene moieties have a stacking distance of about 4.9 Å and a title angle α of about 45°, we choose the dimer and tetramer for the polymerization by exposing the crystals to 254 nm UV light due to their good crystallinity. It was found that the white crystals of the dimer turned into yellow ones after light radiation for 6 h, indicating the occurrence of 1,4-addition polymerization of DAs. However, no change in the color was observed from the tetramer though the light radiation was long enough, showing that the DAs in tetramer crystals are difficult to give PDAs due to a relatively unordered structure. The 1,4-addition polymerization of the dimer was confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopic analysis. As shown in Fig. 5a, a distinct absorption peak at 510 nm appeared in the visible region, confirming the formation of the alternating moieties of the alkene and alkyne.43 Moreover, it was observed from the Raman spectra (Fig. 5b) that the new bands at 2104 and 1468 cm−1 belonging to alternating triple and double bonds, respectively, appeared after photo-polymerization, due to the transition of DA moieties into the alkene and alkyne moieties.44 However, it was noted that the bands at 2210 and 1606 cm−1, which were attributed to the moieties of DAs and the phenyl rings of the dimer, were still retained and showed a much stronger signal than the new two bands, indicating incomplete 1,4-addition polymerization of DAs. Previous studies have shown that the reactivity of DAs is greatly affected by the DA structure of packing in crystals, because the reaction is strict to geometric structures. In order to gain better insight into the spatial structure, we had dedicated to grow single crystals of the dimer firstly. However, it is a pity that the dimer crystal was too small and thin to achieve a X-ray crystal structure. Hence, we expected to get some information about the stacking distances within dimer crystals with the help of the single crystal of 2F8-DA-2Br, of which alkyne of the dimer is substituted by bromine. The structural formula and X-ray crystal structure of 2F8-DA-2Br are shown in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding crystallographic data are summarized in Table S3.† As indicated in Fig. 5d, the stacking distance (d1) of adjacent diacetylene moieties between C1 and C1′ carbons is 10.28 Å, which is much larger than the optimal distance (ca. 4.9 Å). Similarly, the contact distance (d2) between C1 and C4′ carbons and the tilt angle (α) are 7.12 Å and 26.8°, respectively, which deviated from the optimal values of 3.5 Å and 45°. In fact, it is difficult for the topochemical reactions of the dimer in the absence of additional favorable bonding interactions, because the 1,4-addition polymerization of DAs is very dependent on the distance between the reacting butadiyne units. The driving force for the topochemical reactions of the DA units in small amounts inside the dimer is not yet understood.

Conclusions
In summary, a library of D-oFDAs from the tetramer to the decamer was synthesized efficiently by automated chromatographic separation from disperse polymers. MALDI-TOF, SEC and 1H NMR characterization confirmed the successful synthesis of D-oFDAs. As a new conjugated polymer, the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of D-oFDAs were red-shifted with an increasing chain length up to the decamer. EL devices were fabricated from the oligomers except for the decamer, showing that the octamer had the most efficient EL properties. Moreover, the dimer can form lamellar crystals through the solvent evaporation method. With the increase of chain length, the other oligomers were difficult to produce lamellar crystals due to the weaker crystallinity than that of the dimer. The incomplete 1,4-addition polymerization of the dimer crystal was observed by exposing the crystals to 254 nm UV light. The X-ray crystal structure shows that the stacking distances of adjacent diacetylene moieties deviate from the optimal values. We hope that this work can provide guidance for the precise control over the optical and structural properties of conjugated polymers. In the following, we expect to introduce amide groups with an alkyl fragment attached to D-oFDAs to improve additional favorable bonding interactions and provide a more flexible environment for the topochemical polymerization.
