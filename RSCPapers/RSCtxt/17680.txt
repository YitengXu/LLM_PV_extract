    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractHere, we have combined the understanding of density functional theory in relation with lattice strain-to-activity correlation to design a Rucore–Ptshell structured electrocatalyst in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) cathode. This electrocatalyst possesses a compressive lattice strain in the shell region which translocates the Pt valence charge to neighboring atoms to decrease the Pt valence band density of states and thus lower the Pt d-band levels. Consequently, compared with DSCs using Pt nanoparticles (NPs) cathode, the Rucore–Ptshell NPs improves the triiodide to iodide redox reduction activity by 2.11-fold and thus boosts the photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs by ∼30.4%. These results provide mechanistic information for the development of DSCs with reduced Pt utilization and programmable electrochemical performance.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells represent an inexpensive alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic devices because they can be produced in large-scale using environmentally friendly processes. The counter electrode (CE), which collects the electrons flowing from the anode and drives the reduction of I3− to I−, completes the photovoltaic redox cycle and thereby regenerates the photon sensitizer.1 Although conventional platinized cathode on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass shows good efficiency, its low availability and high cost have hindered the further development of DSCs.2 For DSCs, however, low-cost metal oxide or compound (molybdenum/tungsten carbide or titanium nitride) CE can not always perform fast redox kinetics for all types of excitonic solar cells due to their incompatible band levels to newly developed organic redox couples such as (T2/T−) (i.e., di-5-(1-methyltetrazole)disulfide/5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole-N-tetramethylammonium salt) or the conventional I−/I3− electrolyte.3–6
Hence, it is important to develop a new class of electrocatalysts that contains reduced Pt content while providing improved catalytic activity. To pursue Pt replacements, previous studies employed carbon materials and conducting organic polymers as CE catalysts in DSCs.7 Other studies found that inorganic compounds such as CoS, NiS, Cr2O3 and NiN can be employed as CE catalysts with equal efficiency of Pt catalyst.8,9 Although, these reports have successfully established the strategies for cost-effective solar cells, the low chemical stability of polymer and compounds in highly corrosive electrolytes may compromise their sustainability in DSCs.10
From heterogeneous catalysis standpoints, specific surface area, extent of heteroatomic alloying, and lattice strain in near-surface regimes are the deciding factors for good electrocatalysts. These factors of bimetallic electrocatalysts, based on the results of a plethora of structural characterization techniques augmented by first-principle calculations, offer new mechanistic insight into atomistic surface chemistry with unprecedented detail and consequently open the possibilities to improve photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs.11–16
Previous studies have disclosed the mechanism of bimetallic catalysts in the redox reactions of DSCs.4,6 However, the important question that has yet to be addressed is how to control their surface atomic structure at the heterogeneous surface so that a substantial improvement of DSCs efficiency can be achieved. In this study, we demonstrate that when the conventional platinized cathode is replaced by Rucore–Ptshell NPs with appropriate composition and atomistic structure, the photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs can be enhanced. These NPs not only catalysed the I3− reduction reaction to a greater degree, thereby boosting the photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs by ∼30%, but also reduced the Pt loading by ∼60%, compared to pure Pt NPs catalysts. The enhanced performance of Rucore–Ptshell NPs was obtained by examining the effects of the core–shell interface on their surface structures along with electrochemical properties using synchrotron-based characterization techniques, electrochemical analyses, and photovoltaic characterizations. The structural parameter information and theoretically predicted heterogeneous chemistry of electrocatalysts corresponding to the photovoltaic performance of DSCs are given in the following.
Experimental
Nanoparticle synthesis
The Rucore–Ptshell NPs were synthesized by a two-step polyol method with the adopted recipes and reaction sequences in conformity with the expected atomistic architecture. First, hcp Ru cores with an average dimension of ∼2.5 nm (diameter) by ∼3.8 (thickness) nm2 were prepared by reducing 100 mM ruthenium chloride in ethylene glycol (EG) with the thermal treatments adopted from the previous work.17 Second, a Pt shell of exactly 1.5 atomic layer thick was produced by a thermal reduction of Pt anions (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 99 at%) on the surface of Ru cores in the presence of 10 wt% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) stabilizer in EG. The fcc Pt NPs were synthesized by a one-step polyol method in which the thermal reduction of 10 mM Pt anions to Pt NPs (4.2 nm average diameter) was carried out for 1 h in 10 wt% PVP kept at 160 °C.
Cathode and DSC fabrication
The NPs extracted from EG were re-dispersed in ethanol to form a slurry. This NP-containing slurry was spin-coated onto FTO glass followed by an annealing at 330 °C for 30 min to produce the working electrode (working area of 1 cm2) for the CV measurement. The cathode material for our DSCs was also prepared in the same manner. The anode containing 7 μm-thick P25 thin film (surface area = 25 mm2) was prepared by spin-coating P25 (commercial titanium oxide nanopowder of 25 nm) onto FTO glass that was then subject to 450 °C annealing for 30 min before being immersed into N719 dye solution (20 mg of N719 in 67.5 ml of EtOH) for 24 h. The I/LiI-TPB-MPN electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.253 g of I2 (0.05 M), 1.352 g of LI (0.5 M) and 1.339 g of TBP (1.339 g) in MPN solvent (20 ml).
Characterization
Physical properties of NPs (including the crystal structures and the nanostructures) were characterized at various beamlines of NSRRC. Catalytic activity of the NPs in the reaction involved in the redox shuttle of I3−/I− was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a potentiostat (PGSTAT30, AUTOLAB Electrochemical Instrument, Netherlands). The three-electrode system used in CV is comprised of a standard reference electrode of Ag/AgCl, a counter electrode of Pt wire, and a working electrode coated with different NPs. The photovoltaic efficiency of the DSCs was measured under full-sun illumination (AM 1.5G) using a standard potentiostat (Keithley 2400 equipped with a solar simulator Newport 3A).
Results and discussion
Nanostructure determination
The nanostructure of the as synthesized electrocatalysts was elucidated using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis; where the experimental spectra [I(q) vs. q] of Pt and Rucore–Ptshell NPs containing a monolayer of shell atoms are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. As can be seen, the scattering patterns are best described by two-component model functions (solid lines), which comprises the contributions of the interparticle fractal aggregates (dashed lines)18 and the intraparticle form factor (dash-dot lines). Details for the geometric conformation, the structural parameters, and the numerical representations of these models are given in ESI.† Since the surface catalytic activity is the major concern, only the intraparticle structure information (i.e. particle shape, average size and configuration), which corresponds to the scattering oscillation in the range q > 0.08 Å−1, is discussed here. From Fig. 1a, the spectrum of Pt NPs is in good agreement with the SAXS feature of hard sphere particles with Schulz size distribution.19–21 The indistinct scattering hump across the range 0.22 < q < 0.36 Å (denoted by arrow A) is the consequence of shape smearing effect on the SAXS feature of cubic-like Pt NPs (as probed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image in the inset and ESI†). On the other hand, the spectrum of Rucore–Ptshell NPs (Fig. 1b) shows periodic scattering humps (denoted by A′ and A′′) with considerable intensity extending to the q range until 0.59 Å−1 which is a typical SAXS feature of NPs with core–shell structure.19,20 Such scattering periodicity is a result from mainly the in-phase resonance scattering correlation of electron distribution within the shell region and partially the correlation scattering of hard-sphere surface electrons. The structure parameters for the two types of NPs are obtained by fitting their SAXS spectra with adequate models and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. Accordingly, the Pt NPs have an average particle size (σavg) of 43.8 Å and a polydispersity of particle size P = 0.21. On the other hand, the Rucore–Ptshell NPs are grown into disk like particles. Their core diameter (DC) and length (LC) are determined to be 25.0 and 18.8 Å, where the thicknesses of radial shell (TR) and face shell (TF) are 8.1 and 3.0 Å, respectively. The growth of NCs with core–shell structure and precisely controlled shell thickness are evident since P, the particle size polydispersity, is quite small (∼0.11) as determined from the SAXS analysis.

Crystal structure and lattice strain of shell region in Rucore–Ptshell NPs
The effects of the core–shell interface on the crystal structure of the shell crystal could be elucidated by XRD. Fig. 2 compares the XRD patterns of Pt NPs (Fig. 2a) and Rucore–Ptshell NPs (Fig. 2b). The corresponding structure parameters are summarized in Table 2. As illustrated, the three diffraction peaks at 20.05° (D), 23.15° (E), and 32.85° (G) correspond to the metallic characters from (111), (200) and (220) facets of Pt NPs with an average coherent length (Davg) of ∼65.7, ∼60.5 and ∼60.8 Å, respectively, according to the Debye–Scherrer equation. This, which is consistently observed by HRTEM, suggests that the Pt NPs is grown isotropically along different orientations in a cubic like shape. The Rucore–Ptshell NPs are a two-phase system. As demonstrated in Fig. 2b, the metallic Pt (111) (D) and (200) (E) characterization peaks are overlapped with the Ru (100) (A), (002) (B) and (220) (C) in the same range across 16–25.5° in the diffraction pattern.17,22 From SAXS results we know that the shell thickness of Rucore–Ptshell NCs ranges from 3.0 to 8.1 Å. This information suggests that the full width at half-maximum (fwhm, Δ2θ) of these diffraction peaks is far larger than 4.1° (the estimated fwhm value from the Debye–Scherrer equation). Therefore, it is not possible to extract the structure parameters of these facets by deconvoluting the diffraction peaks in this region. To avoid the overlap issues, the crystal structures were determined from the high-angle diffraction peaks (2θ = 31–35°), where only the Ru (110) (F) and Pt (220) (G) would be observed. By adopting the peak feature (the position and Δ2θ), the Davg of Ru (110) (at 33.34°) and Pt (220) (at 32.87°) are determined to be 49.8 and 30.1 Å, respectively. This result is slightly larger than that of SAXS estimation. Because of the formation of a coherent interface between the close-packed facets of Pt fcc and Ru hcp, the lattice modulation of the core–shell interface with a slight extent of Pt restructuring of the Ru core is unavoidable. This is revealed by the considerable extent of peak offset and merging in the low angle region and could be the possible reasons for the enlarged Pt and Ru Davg.

The lattice strain of the Pt shell crystal, s(shell), in the Rucore–Ptshell NPs could be determined by the extent of its characterization peaks offset from the peak of Pt NPs. Before the data analysis, the background signals of polymer retentions and the silicon substrate were carefully subtracted. Herein, the lattice strain in the shell region could be estimated by eqn (1):13 (1)where aPt and ashell are the bulk Pt (i.e., Pt NPs in our study) and Pt shell (in Rucore–Ptshell NPs) lattice constants, respectively. For Rucore–Ptshell NPs, the peak metallic Pt (220) facet (G) is found shifted to the high angle side from that of Pt NPs and has an interplanar spacing of 1.39 Å. It corresponds to a ashell of 3.94 Å, which indicates that the shell Pt lattice was compressed by 0.8% (comparing to aPt) by depositing on the heterogeneous interface of Ru core crystallites. The lattice structure and strain on Rucore–Ptshell NPs are consistently revealed by HRTEM and is given in ESI.†
Atomic structure, electronic structure, and the binding energy of NPs
The core–shell interface also substantially affects the surface atomic configuration, the unfilled d states, and the binding energy of the NPs. These characterizations, which could be elucidated by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), illustrate from where the surface activity of NPs originate. Fig. 3 compares the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra of Pt NPs, Rucore–Ptshell NPs, and Pt foil. The absorption features at 11564 eV correspond to the electronic transitions of 2p3/2 to 5d3/2 of Pt metal; where the magnitude of the absorption hump and white-line (WL) reflects the orbital occupancy of the 5d electronic state.23 Herein, the higher WL intensity is the indication for the lower Pt5d occupancy of NPs than that of Pt foil, which could be caused by the charge donation from Pt to their neighbouring atoms (i.e., oxygen in platinum oxide and ruthenium in Ru core).24 By adopting the differences in the WL intensity between the catalysts and a reference Pt foil to a conventional known L-edges correlation (the L2 XANES are shown in Fig. S1, ESI† which shows the charge transition from 2p3/2 to 5d3/2 state) as developed by Mansour and Reifsnyder et al., the fractional change in the total number of unfilled d states (fd) of Pt atoms in NPs could be quantitatively determined by eqn (2):23,25 (2)where ΔA2 and ΔA3 are the integrated areas between −10 and 15 eV after subtracting the Pt foil data from the NPs data at L2 and L3 edges, respectively. The values of A3r and A2r denote the integrated area of Pt foil at L3 and L2 edges, respectively. The integrated areas are normalized by multiplying with the X-ray absorption cross-section at the corresponding edge jumps (σ); where σ3 (for Pt L3-edge) and σ2 (for Pt L2-edge) are set to be 117.1 and 54.2 cm−2 g−1, respectively, according to the standard database.26 In addition, the number of unfilled d states in the sample (hTs) can then be represented by eqn (3) if that of unfilled d states in the reference material (hTr) is known: hTs = (1 + fd)hTr(3)
 Fig. 3  Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt NPs and Rucore–Ptshell NPs compared with that of Pt foil. 
The estimated hTs for Pt and Rucore–Ptshell NPs are shown in the inset of Fig. 3. This parameter is dominated by structural factors such as morphology, particle size, heteroatomic intermix, and the extent of oxidation of the NPs.27 Accordingly, the hTs of Pt NPs is determined to be 1.63-fold that of Pt foil. Given that heteroatomic intermixing is absent, the higher hTs of Pt NPs relative to Pt foil can be attributed to mainly the particle size effect and partially to surface oxidization. On the other hand, Rucore–Ptshell NPs has a substantial higher hTs, which suggests extensive valence charge donation from Pt to neighbouring coordinates. This is possibly due to the lower homoatomic coordination number of Pt (see Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†) and stronger extent of surface oxidation (or oxygen chemisorption) and heterogeneous interface contact than for Pt NPs.17,28
The interatomic electronic structure of experimental NPs could be deduced by using XPS analysis. Fig. 4 shows the Pt4f region of the spectra from the Pt NPs (Fig. 4a) and Rucore–Ptshell NPs (Fig. 4b) with the fitting curves of different valent Pt species. Within this region, the two emission lines at ∼74.6 and ∼71.2 eV are originated from the contributions of the Pt4f5/2 and 4f7/2 orbitals, respectively. In this study the incident X-ray energy is selected as 275 eV, which corresponds to a probing depth of the emitted photoelectrons of about ∼3–5 Å according to the Beer–Lambert relationship.29,30 In this case, the intensity of the emission peaks (denoted by H) could be considered as a qualitative index for the 4f electron density of Pt atoms. Therefore, lower H implies that the Rucore–Ptshell NPs have a lower Pt4f electron density than Pt NPs NCs. As consistently predicted by the lattice strain modified d-band model and the substantially higher Pt hTs (see inset of Fig. 3),15,16 the lower H of Rucore–Ptshell NPs is indicative of a considerable amount of Pt to neighbouring charge donation due to a compressive lattice strain within the Pt shell region. The appearance of shoulders (denoted by arrows α and α*) at the high energy side of both 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 emission peaks could be the consequence of doublet signals from the high valent species with positive offset of binding energies (BE).30 Similarly, it could be explained by the d-band model with the compressive lattice strain in the Pt shell region (Table 2) and simple surface-to-bulk geometry estimation (see ESI†).

The effects of lattice strain on the Pt valent distributions and the Pt BE shifts of Rucore–Ptshell NPs are elucidated by XPS analysis by fitting the spectra in the Pt4f region. In this region, the spectrum can be deconvoluted into 2–4 pairs of doublets depending on the surface chemical/geometrical environments of NPs. For each doublet, the binding energy (BE) of Pt4f5/2 was set about 3.35 eV higher than that of Pt4f7/2. The obtained structure parameters are summarized in Table 3; where BE and AR refers to the binding energies and relative-area ratios of the integrated intensities (surface composition) of the different species, respectively. Zerovalent Pt (Pt(0)) predominates (85.71%) on the surface of Pt NPs with an intense doublet at 71.24 and 74.59 eV. The second and weaker doublet (at 72.63 and 75.98 eV) with BE at 1.39 eV higher than Pt(0) suggests the formation of 14.29% of Pt(II) species such as Pt(OH)2 and possibly PtO.31 However, high-valent chemical species (e.g., Pt(OH)2, PtO, Pt(OH)4, and H2PtCl6etc.) prevail on the surface of Rucore–Ptshell NPs (57.05%). From geometrical standpoints, the substantially high level of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) species is possibly a consequence of severe surface oxidation. From fitting results, the positions of outer surface Pt(II) and Pt(IV) doublets would shift by 0.52 eV to lower BE from that of Pt NPs or the theoretical values,30 while the BE of the bulk Pt(0) remains unchanged. These results are highly consistent with the prediction of density functional theory calculation based d-band model12,28 and the characterizations of Pt monolayer thin film growth on a Ru(0001) surface.16,32 Accordingly, the BE shift is an indication for the charge translocation between Pt and neighbouring atoms due to the heteroatom electronic interactions of Pt atoms including their extent of alloying, their electronegativity difference to neighbouring atoms, their surface oxidation distributions, and their lattice strain.15,16,28 In Rucore–Ptshell NPs, the ligand effect between Pt and Ru might shift up the Pt4f spectrum.32 However, this is a negligible factor because these two atoms have relatively compatible electronegativity (i.e., Pt = 2.28 and Ru = 2.2). In this case, the substantial downshift of Pt–(OH) BEs could be the consequences of Pt d-band centre lowering by the compressive lattice strain in the Pt region on Rucore–Ptshell. This result is consistently predicted in a previous literature,15 where the offset of BE from the theoretical value could be attributed to the strain relaxation by the presence of interfacet defects.

Fig. 4c compares the valence band (VB) spectra of Pt and Rucore–Ptshell NPs. The VB of the Pt NPs consisted of several features: a steep increase in the BE range of 0.00–0.24 eV, a flat stage with a reflection point at 0.72 eV (surface binding energy, Eb), a shoulder till 3.38 eV (region A), and three additional broad bands centered at 5.27 eV (region B), 9.42 eV (region C) and 12.29 eV (region D). These distinguishing features correspond to that of bulk Pt samples with ordered crystal facets, which resemble the metallic like Pt5d states. In order to clarify the heteroatomic charge donations between Pt and Ru atoms, the VB spectra of Ru NPs and PtRu alloy are compared with that of experimental NPs in Fig. S3, ESI† as a control. Compared to Pt NPs, the Rucore–Ptshell NPs shifts up the Eb by 0.44 eV (at 1.16 eV), merges the d bands in A and B regions, and broadens and downshifts the sub-level bands (C and D) by 3.01 eV. Since substantial attenuation and modification on the Rucore–Ptshell VB features compared to that of Ru NPs are found, the spectrum obtained here can not be thought of as a sum of separate ruthenium and platinum contributions. Instead, it resembles the hybridization effects of sublayer crystal (in our study, the Ru core NPs) on outer layer atom VB structures. From this understanding, the substantial decrease of outer band (region A) intensity indicates the decrease of density of states (DOS, which is consistently revealed by the higher Rucore–Ptshell NPs hTs than Pt NPs above). This reflects the easy charge donation from Pt to the sub-layer Ru atoms and the chemisorbed OH ligands,15 therefore, rationalizing the increase of Eb. Meanwhile, the downshift and merging of sub-level bands imply valence charge injection at the topmost layer Pt atoms. Herein, the high Eb and low d-band levels suggest the easy chemisorption and charge translocation to the electron affiliated anions from the Rucore–Ptshell surface sites.15 These valence band properties, which are consistently proved by the density functional theory (DFT) estimations (see Table 5 and Fig. 6), would facilitate the redox reaction of I−/I3−, and therefore enhance DSC performance.
Electrochemical and photovoltaic characterizations
Keeping in mind the two NPs have distinct differences between structural and I−/I3− chemisorption properties via spectroscopy analyses and DFT simulations; we demonstrate their electrochemical performances, particularly, in the I3− reduction activity at a cathode which substantially influences the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. The activities of NPs over I3− reduction were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode system set-up, in which the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) working electrode (a sheet resistance of ∼12 Ω sq−1) was spin-coated with the two types of NPs as catalyst. Fig. 5a presents the corresponding CV spectra of the two catalysts measured at a potential scan rate of 30 mV s−1 with a step of 5 mV, where four current maximum peaks corresponding to their reactions are indicated by the arrows with capital letters. It is seen that the forward potential scan of Rucore–Ptshell NP catalyst shifts to more oxidative potentials relative to that of Pt NPs, accompanied by a shift of peak A from VPtA = 357.3 mV to VCSA = 276.4 mV and that of peak B from VPtB = 763.7 mV to VCSB = 716.4 mV. Likewise, the reverse potential scan of Rucore–Ptshell NP catalyst also shifts to more oxidative potentials with a considerable shift (104.8 mV) of peak D from VPtD = −38.7 mV to VCSD = 66.1 mV, despite no shift for peak C (VCSC = VPtC = 560.5 mV). Kinetically, these shifts manifest the fact that oxidations A (3I− → I3− + 2e−) and B (2I3− → I2 + 2e−) and reduction D (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) are all faster when catalyzed by Rucore–Ptshell NPs than by their Pt counterparts, and reduction C (3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−) is of equal reaction rate for both catalysts. This is because if the kinetics of a certain redox reaction is faster, the reaction equilibrium can be established more rapidly (compared to the potential scan rate), to convert more reactants. Consequently, the current density takes shorter time to respond to the applied voltage, thus it rises quicker (i.e., lower charge transfer resistance) and peaks at an earlier voltage value as the voltage is swept further to more reductive potentials.33 Moreover, the maximum current density of the I3− reduction (JPtD = 0.44 mA cm−2) is ∼65.9% smaller than that of the I− oxidation (JPtA = 1.29 mA cm−2) for Pt NP catalyst, implying that a significant area of the catalyst surface is inactive due to I2 molecule capping.34 On the other hand, the maximum current densities (JCSD = 1.37 mA cm−2 and JCSA = 1.74 mA cm−2) are both enhanced by ∼211.4 and ∼34.9%, respectively, using Rucore–Ptshell NP catalyst, which substantially reduces the difference of the two maximum current densities, |JD − JA|, to ∼27.0%. Particularly, the catalytic activity enhancement of the Pt surface by the Ru core over I3− reduction is of critical importance for the photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs since this reaction is known to possess a prohibitively slow kinetics.1,34
 Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the two NPs. (b) J–V characteristic curves of the two catalysts. Symbols denote the data and solid lines are fitted curves to the data based on eqn (3) in the text and the equivalent electric circuit shown in the lower inset. Both the CV and J–V were collected using the same electrolyte of acetonitrile solution containing 10.0 mM of LiI and 1.0 mM of I2. Data were measured at a potential sweeping rate of 30 mV s−1. 
The superior I3− reduction activity of Rucore–Ptshell NP on promoting the DSC performance is directly observed by photovoltaic (PV) measurement, which is represented by the current density–voltage (J–V) (Fig. 5b) and the associated power–voltage (P–V) characteristics curves (inset of Fig. 5b). Two DSC devices were assembled with a P25/FTO anode, an I−/I3− electrolyte, and an FTO cathode spin-coated with either type of the NPs. They possess the same fabrication mode and structure, which are schematically depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Compared to Pt NPs, the Rucore–Ptshell NPs cathode increases the short-circuit density current, JSC, by 43.2% (from 12.05 to 17.1 mA cm−2) and decreases slightly the open-circuit voltage, VOC, by 10% (from 0.80 to 0.72 V). Consequently, such a cathode yields a substantial enhancement of the energy conversion efficiency, η = (FF × JSC × VOC)/Pin, by ∼30.4% (from 5.72 to 7.46%), where FF is the fill factor (see eqn (4)), Pmax is the maximum electric output power density corresponding to Jmax and Vmax indicated in Fig. 5b, and Pin = 100 mW cm−2 is the incident light power density. The J–V and P–V characteristics of our DSSC devices are further analysed using a standard equivalent electric circuit of the well-known single-diode model as shown in the inset of Fig. 5b, with characteristic J–V equation given by eqn (5): (4) (5)where J1 is the photogenerated current density. In this equation, the second term is due to the diode current density including the reverse saturation current density J0, where the elementary charge q = 1.6 × 10−19 C, V is the applied voltage, J is the current density, A = 0.25 cm−2 is the area of our DSCs, RS is the series resistance, γ is the diode ideality factor, kB = 8.617 × 10−5 eV K−1 is the Boltzmann constant, and T = 300 K is the absolute temperature. The third term of eqn (5) is the current density flowing through the shunt resistance RSH. As can be seen, the fitting curves (solid lines) are in good agreements with those of experimental data (symbols) for the two DSC devices.
The obtained parameters are provided in Table 4 for both devices. It is worth stressing that the resistances of the NP spin-coated cathodes are assumed to be equal. The validity for this assumption comes from the similar slopes of the CV curves within the voltage range of −170 to 90 mV, much earlier than VA at peak A (see Fig. 5a), in addition to the fact that identical anode and electrolyte are used for both DSC devices. Here, the characteristic parameters could be kinetically rationalized by the different interplays among the processes of the I3− reduction, the charge transportation, and the non-radioactive recombination of electrons from TiO2 NPs to the I3− species between the two DSCs. As indicated, the cathode coated with Rucore–Ptshell NPs shows RS of 76.4 Ω sq−1 which is 50.5% lower than that coated with Pt NPs (RS = 154.4 Ω sq−1). This reduction of RS may account for the quicker response in current to the applied voltage of Rucore–Ptshell NPs than Pt NPs, as discussed previously in their CV performance, revealing its better I3− reduction capability. Of particular interest is the huge difference (about four orders of magnitude) in the values of the shunt resistance for both devices. For Rucore–Ptshell NP based device, the shunt resistance, RSH = 4 × 108 Ω sq−1, is large enough for it to be removed from the equivalent circuit. On the contrary, for the Pt NPs based device, a considerable leakage current should be taken into account because of a low shunt resistance (RSH = 3.33 × 104 Ω sq−1). A plausible interpretation for this contrast is that in the Pt NP based device the non-radioactive electron transfer to the electrolyte, regarded as shunting, is intensified by the presence of more I3− species at the TiO2 NPs surface. This phenomenon may be caused by the slower transportation of I− to I3− from the anode as a consequence of the slower I3− reduction at the Pt NP cathode than at the Rucore–Ptshell NP one, in addition to the diffusion-limited shuttling of the I−/I3− redox couple in the viscous acetonitrile electrolyte. It should be noticed that the same apparent diode ideality factor of γ ≈ 3 means that the processes affecting this factor are assumed to be similar. Nevertheless, a crucial point is that the faster I3− reduction at the Rucore–Ptshell NP cathode, as compared to its Pt NP counterpart, results in not only the increase of J1, but also an increase of J0. Both the increases of J1 and J0 are due to the rapid I3− to 3I− reduction at low DOS, high valence charge dissociation, and low d-band center core–shell NPs surface. Therefore, in such a way, the ratio J1/J0 leads to a 10% reduction of VOC as discussed above, assuming that VOC ≒ (γkBT/q)ln(1 + J1/J0) when the anodic I− digestion rate is relatively slower than that of cathodic I− production in such a DSC module. This is understandable because the factors affecting on the photovoltaic performance chosen in the fabrication of our DSCs devices are those that have been optimized for state-of-the-art DSCs systems comprising conventional platinized-based FTO cathodes, but not our NPs-based FTO cathodes. Therefore, once optimized appropriately the performance of our DSCs devices might be further improved.

First-principle density functional theory (DFT) simulations on heterogeneous surface chemistry
The chemisorption of I3− on Pt(111) and Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces was calculated by the DFT method using the Quantum ESPRESSO package. The substrate was modeled by a slab composed of 5 atomic layers with 12 atoms in each layer. The slab modeling Pt/Ru(0001) was constructed by replacing the 12 Ru atoms of the topmost layer of the Ru slab with Pt atoms. The exchange-correlation was treated by the PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) functionals. The electron cores are described by Vanderbilt's ultrasoft pseudopotentials (PPs) for Pt and Ru atoms and by a norm-conserving PP for I atoms. The optimization of the chemisorption geometries was performed by using the Broyden–Fletcher–Godfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, in which the atoms of the bottom three layers were kept fixed at their truncated bulk positions while those of the top two layers are allowed to relax. The optimal adsorption geometry of linear I3− anion, set perpendicularly to the surface initially, was calculated by allowing the atomic coordinates and distances of the top two layers to relax as well. The position of the d-band centroid relative to the Fermi level was evaluated based on the projected d-density of states.
The DFT simulation is a direct tool to provide understanding of structural and electronic properties and chemisorption of atom/molecules on heterogeneous substrates. The simulation results on I3− relaxation at the experimental substrates are given in Fig. 6 and Table 5. Combining this knowledge and structural parameters from XRD, XPS, XAS and UPS measurements the electrochemical properties can be rationalized reasonably. It is known by experiments and DFT calculations that the compressive lattice strain,15 which is experienced by Pt atoms accommodating on Ru(0001) substrates, results in a downshift of d-band center and binding energies of Pt atoms as revealed by the aforementioned XPS and UPS analysis. As a result, the chemisorption of molecules such as CO and H2 are weakened by the compressive lattice strain as predicted by the d-band model. However, Xin and Linic35 have recently discovered an exception that a family of absorbate–substrate pairs, including very electronegative absorbates (e.g., OH− and halogen groups such as Cl, F and I) and substrates with surface atoms of almost completely filled d-bands (i.e., d9 and d10 atoms such as Pt and Pd), show chemisorption behavior that is reverse to this trend. Accordingly, larger absorption energies (AEs) and longer absorbate–substrate bond lengths (ASBLs) are associated with lower d-band center energies, Ed, for a given absorption geometry. This exception is attributed to the substantial repulsion between substrate d-band states with renormalized adsorbate ones. Interestingly, the result of our DFT calculations shows that the chemisorption of I3− anion on both Pt/Ru(0001) (Ed = −2.87 eV) and Pt(111) (Ed = −2.49 eV) surfaces obeys this exception. In addition to the severe symmetry breaking of the linearly shaped I3− anion, our DFT calculations show that AE and ASBL are both larger (2.40 Å and 2.94 eV) for the Pt/Ru(0001) than for the Pt(111) (2.32 Å and 2.52 eV) as shown in Table 5. Therefore, I3− reduction at a DSC cathode catalyzed by Rucore–Ptshell NPs is energetically more favorable since the larger AE of I3− means that it is easier to reduce I3−, and the larger ASBL means it is also easier to transport I− from the surface. Hereby, the simulation results showing consistent results with that of electrochemical and structural characterizations indicate that the improved photovoltaic efficiency of the DSC module originates from the lattice strain induced top layer Pt to neighbouring atoms valence electron translocation and the valence band modification by the sublayer atoms.

Accordingly, I3− would have a bent and asymmetric conformation after adsorbing at a surface. The I3 to-surface distance (i.e., the absorbate–substrate bond length), the absorption energy, and the energy separation between the d-band centroid and the Fermi level are provided for both chemisorption geometries and are given in Table 5. The pathways for the I3− chemisorption and dissociation on the proposed surface are listed below:
 
1. The I3− molecules dissociate into I−–□ + I2 at stable state after relaxation (□ designates surface sites; e.g. Pt atoms).
2. On the surface of Pt, I− tends to bridge at two Pt atoms via short bonds (strongest I−–□ adsorption).
3. The stronger adsorption energy of I3− with the longer bond length of I−–□ leads to easy adsorption and desorption of I3− and I− at surface sites of Pt/Ru(0001).
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized a DSC cathode catalyst of NPs comprising of a multifaceted disk-like Ru core crystallite and controlled thickness Pt shell, by using a two-step polyol method. The spectroscopy characterizations, DFT simulations, together with the photovoltaic and electrochemical characterizations presented here elucidated that the Ru core lowers the d band level and decreases the valence band DOS of surface Pt via compressive strain at the core–shell interface. The proposed mechanisms are shown in Fig. 7. We found that such core–shell NPs facilitate I3− reduction and weakening of I− chemisorption at the cathode, which can improve the JSC by 43.2% (from 12.05 to 17.1 mA cm−2), and consequently ameliorate the DSC η by ∼30.4% (from 5.72 to 7.46%) compared to a cathode with Pt NPs. Besides, our strategy enables an approximately 90% or higher Pt utilization and 61% reduction in the amount of Pt metal when compared to the cathode with Pt NPs. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the core–shell NPs is tuneable by changing the shell thickness and the core configurations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a core–shell bimetallic catalyst has been reported for such a substantial improvement on the I3− reduction activity and the photovoltaic performance of DSC modules. Most importantly, our full scope structural characterizations combined with first-principle theoretical modelling have outlined the relationship between structure and heterogeneous surface, to improve the design of future exitonic solar cells.
