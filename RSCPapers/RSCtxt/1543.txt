    , Accepted 6th May 2016First published on 10th May 2016AbstractTo enhance the total emission intensity, particularly the red emission of Yb,Er co-doped nanoparticles for red light activated photodynamic therapy (PDT), we doped Mn2+ ions into the NaGdF4:Yb,Er core, and subsequently coated the NaGdF4:Yb active shell to fabricate core–shell structured, up-conversion nanoparticles of NaGdF4:Yb,Er,Mn@NaGdF4:Yb (abbreviated as UCNPs). A novel and facile encapsulation method with gelatin has been proposed to transfer oleic acid (OA) stabilized UCNPs into an aqueous solution and simultaneously decorate zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) photosensitizer molecules. In the encapsulation process, ZnPc molecules are wrapped in the interlaced net structure of the peptide chain from gelatin, forming the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite. The nanoplatform has high emission intensity and excellent biocompatibility, as was expected. More importantly, the enhanced red emission of UCNPs has significant overlap with the UV absorbance of ZnPc; therefore, it can effectively activate the sensitizer to produce a large amount of singlet oxygen reactive oxygen species (ROS, 1O2) to kill cancer cells, which has evidently been verified by the in vitro results. Combined with the inherent up-conversion luminescence (UCL) imaging properties, this UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanoplatform could have potential application in PDT and imaging fields.
Introduction
In recent years, rare earth up-conversion luminescence (UCL) materials have gained considerable attention for their potential applications in lighting industries, color displays, solar cells, nanoscale bio-probes, and optical devices.1–11 Among these, the applications in the biomedical field are especially attractive.12–22 This is because rare earth elements have a unique electronic configuration, which allows their compounds to have versatile physical and chemical properties.23–25
It is well known that rare earth fluoride materials are good hosts for UCL, due to their low phonon energy, low non-radiative decay rates, and high radiative emission rates.26–29 NaGdF4:Yb,Er is an efficient up-conversion phosphor, in which the Yb3+/Er3+ couple displays two main up-conversion emission bands centered at ∼540 nm (green light) and ∼660 nm (red light).30,31 Interestingly, the red light emission promotes the conjugation of Yb3+/Er3+ coupled up-conversion nanoparticles, with the photosensitizer, ZnPc. This occurs when the formed nanocomposite is exposed to 980 nm laser irradiation; the energy of the red light emission can be transferred to ZnPc molecules to produce singlet oxygen (1O2), allowing the nanocomposite to have potential application in photodynamic therapy (PDT).32–35 Nevertheless, the present up-conversion nanoparticles always emit much stronger green emission than red emission, while ZnPc molecules mainly absorb the red emission.36–39 Additionally, green light is not in the optical transmission window, and therefore has limited penetrating depth, making it hard to detect.40,41 In order to amplify the red emission of the Yb3+/Er3+ couple, Han and co-workers made an attempt to increase the Yb3+ concentration.42 This method increased the cross-relaxation processes between Er3+ ions, and red-to-green (R/G) emissions were therefore increased. However, more Yb3+ dopants in the host lattice will decrease interatomic distance of Yb3+ → Er3+ and thus facilitate back-energy-transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+, resulting in the decreased total up-conversion emission.43–45 Liu and co-authors prepared KMnF3:Yb,Er nanoparticles, which have high purity, single-band red up-conversion emission.46 However, the UCL intensity is insufficient at low power density because the host KMnF3 is in the cubic crystal phase, which is not as efficient as the hexagonal phase.47–53
Recently, a new technique was developed to enhance the red emission by co-doping limited amounts of Mn2+ into Yb3+/Er3+ coupled up-conversion nanoparticles.54,55 The total UCL intensity can be retained for the efficient lattice host. The increased intermediate energy level from Mn2+ transfers the energy of the green band of Er3+ to the red band, leading to decreased green emission but enhanced red emission. Capobianco et al. reported that the Yb3+ doped active-shell coating can significantly improve the total luminescence intensity, especially red up-conversion emission, compared to core-only and core-inert shell samples without Yb3+ doping.56 However, the improvement is still limited. Enlightened by the above two routes, we envision that the UCL intensity, especially the red emission should be able to be markedly enhanced by simultaneously co-doping Mn2+ ions into the Yb3+/Er3+ coupled up-conversion core, and coating with the Yb3+ doped fluoride active-shell, which would make the produced material suitable for red emission-sensitized PDT and bio-imaging.57,58 Furthermore, OA-coated UCNPs cannot be used directly in organisms because of their low dispersibility in aqueous solution and bad biocompatibility.58–61 The conventional methods for transforming hydrophobic nanoparticles into hydrophilic ones have their own drawbacks. For example, the ligand exchange method will change the physicochemical properties of the surface and decrease the long-term stability, and the silica coating route faces the problem of great agglomeration and undegradability of silica in physiological environments. Thus, exploiting novel routes for transforming hydrophobic nanoparticles into hydrophilic ones is highly desirable and promising.
Herein, a core–shell structure combining a Mn2+ doped core with Yb3+ doped active-shell coating to enhance red up-conversion emission and total UCL intensity was designed and fabricated for the first time. Also, gelatin, which possesses an amphiphilic nature and polypeptide chain structure, has been used for the conversion of hydrophobic UCNPs to hydrophilic ones. Firstly, gelatin extracted from the connective tissue of organisms is non-toxic, non-immunogenic and biodegradable, which ensure good biocompatibility for gelatin-encapsulated UCNPs.62 Secondly, the hydrophobic segments of the gelatin molecule can be attracted to the surface of UCNPs, while the hydrophilic section, with active groups exposed to the water media can be modified with functional groups.63,64 Furthermore, the interlaced net structure of the gelatin layer can tightly wrap the ZnPc molecules during the transferring process. Therefore, transferring the UCNPs and decorating with ZnPc molecules can be achieved in one step. Additionally, the enhanced red emission of UCNPs overlaps the UV adsorption of ZnPc in the red color range, and can be used to generate ROS upon NIR light irradiation, endowing UCNPs with PDT anticancer capability when excited by NIR irradiation. Accordingly, the gelatin-coated UCNPs were used as a multi-functional platform for PDT and UCL imaging. The biocompatibility with L929 cells, anticancer effects on HeLa cells in vitro and UCL imaging were investigated.
Results and discussion
Phase, composition, structure and luminescence properties
A one-step self-assembly method was adopted to fabricate the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The mixture of cyclohexane solution (containing OA-capped UCNPs and ZnPc molecules) and gelatin with amphiphilic polypeptide chains were emulsified in the water phase under vigorous stirring. With the evaporation of cyclohexane, abundant hydrophobic side chains gradually dragged the peptide chain to the surface of the UCNPs, and the hydrophilic segments were exposed to deionized water. At the same time, ZnPc molecules were wrapped in the interlaced net structure and conjugated with active groups, including –NH2, –COOH and –OH exposed outwardly. Finally, the diluted nanocomposite aqueous solution showed optical transparency. Compared with the existing hydrophilic modification, bio-conjugation and loading processes, this process is time and labor saving. More importantly, the possibility for too many hydrophobic photosensitizers conjugating on the surface of the gelatin layer is avoided, otherwise the biocompatibility would be lowered and the photosensitizer molecules would be easily leaked.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn core and core–shell UCNPs, respectively. The diffraction peaks of both nanoparticles are well indexed to hexagonal NaGdF4 (JCPDS No. 27-0699). The average crystallite sizes were calculated from the Scherrer formula: Dhkl = Kλ/(βcosθ), where K is a constant of 0.89, θ is the diffraction angle, β is the full-width at half-maximum, and Dhkl is the crystallite size along the (hkl) direction. The (100) crystal plane at 2θ = 17.0° was used to calculate the crystal size (D) of the obtained nanoparticles. The crystallite size of the core–shell UCNPs was calculated to be 45.4 nm. The size from the statistical analysis of the TEM images (Fig. 2D) is 47.8 ± 1.5 nm, which is similar to the value from Scherrer's formula. The TEM and HRTEM images of the core, UCNPs, and UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite are presented in Fig. 2. We can see from Fig. 2A that the OA-coated NaGdF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles are well dispersed and the average diameter is about 45 nm. In Fig. 2B, the doping of 40 mol% Mn2+ in the NaGdF4 host has a certain impact on the shape. Some quadrilateral-like particles appear and the uniformity is slightly decreased. This could be caused by the difference in radius between Mn2+ and rare earth ions, which inevitably brings defects to the hexagonal crystal lattice and directly leads to a morphology change in the final product. Moreover, it should be noted that the coordinating ability of Mn2+ is stronger than that of rare earth ions because the inner d electrons with lower energy take part in the coordination.65 This means that when Mn2+ ions enter the crystal sites, the oleic acid ligand still forms complexes with Mn2+ on the surface, and hexagonal crystal growth is hampered. This can also affect crystal perfection and the uniformity of nanoparticles. It is interesting that both OA-coated UCNPs and UCNPs@gel–ZnPc are uniform with spherical shape (Fig. 2D–F), indicating that the coating of the NaGdF4:Yb active shell makes the sample grow into a spherical shape. The size, shape, and dispersity make it feasible for biomedical application. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2C presents the lattice fringes with an observed d-spacing of 0.52 nm, which is in agreement with the lattice spacing in the (100) planes of hexagonal-phase NaGdF4, indicating a high crystallinity of the core nanoparticles. The lattice fringes assigned to the (100) planes can also be observed in Fig. 2F, which shows the highly crystalline nature of the core–shell UCNPs. The average diameter of UCNPs@gel–ZnPc is 55 nm, which is slightly higher than that of the core–shell sample. Besides, close observation reveals that a transparent thin layer can be found on some nanoparticles (Fig. 2E), which may be ascribed to the encapsulation of gelatin. The EDS spectra of the NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn core and core–shell UCNPs indicate that the elements of Na, Gd, Yb, F, Er, and Mn are clearly present, confirming the composition of the samples. Scheme 2A depicts the core–shell structured nanoparticles, showing the green, enhanced red emission and energy transfer upon excitation with 980 nm laser light. Scheme 2B shows the NIR triggered UCL image and photodynamic effect for the final nanocomposite. Fig. 3A presents the UCL emission spectra of the fluorides with different Mn2+ concentration after the green region was normalized upon excitation with 980 nm NIR light. There are two main emission bands at 510–560 nm and 640–680 nm, which can be ascribed to 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions. For pure NaGdF4:Yb,Er, it is obvious that the red emission of the nanoparticles is much weaker than the green one. As is known, green light has only a shallow penetration and is hard to detect in biological tissue. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the red emission for the purpose of detecting and enhancing the ability to activate the red emission-activated ZnPc molecules. It is clear that the red/green (R/G) ratio is increased with increasing Mn2+ concentration. However, further increasing the concentration to 50% only gives rise to a slight increase in the red emission. Considering the decrease in the total emission intensity for the sample with 50% Mn2+ doping concentration (Fig. 3B), we selected 40% as the optimized concentration. For comparison, UC emission spectra (without being normalized to the green emission), are provided in Fig. S1A (ESI†). It is clear that the red region was enhanced, while the green region decreased. As mentioned above, the difference in the ionic radius and the charge difference between the doped Mn2+ and rare earth ions will induce vacancies that may lower the emission intensity. Moreover, with the increase in Mn2+ ions, more energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+ will also lead to decreased up-conversion emission. The change in the red and green emission can also be verified by the decay times. Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents the lifetimes of Er3+ in NaGdF4:Yb,Er, NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn, UCNPs and UCNPs@gel–ZnPc samples under 980 nm irradiation. As shown, the lifetime at 541 nm decreases markedly from 113.7 μs to 63.1 μs after 40 mol% Mn2+ was doped into NaGdF4:Yb,Er, while the lifetime at 655 nm increases from 145.2 μs to 189.2 μs. To keep the total emission intensity and simultaneously obtain bright red emission, we adopted the technique of coating an active shell onto a luminescent core. It was found that the lifetime at 655 nm was increased markedly to 394.3 μs after coating with the active shell. As for the final nanocomposite, the lifetime at 655 nm decreased to 264.7 μs; i.e. the energy of the red emission was transferred to the ZnPc molecules. In order to further improve the R/G ratio of the nanocarriers used in this work, we fabricated core nanoparticles with different Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations and studied their luminescence properties. With increased Er3+ and Yb3+ doping levels, the red regions of the UC emission spectra were enhanced (Fig. S2A and C, ESI†). However, the integrated luminescence intensity had varying degrees of decline after the Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations changed (Fig. S2B and D, ESI†). This maybe caused by the cross-relaxation effect between activators. The emission spectra of NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn and core–shell UCNPs are given in Fig. 3C; as shown, the total emission intensity was markedly enhanced. Moreover, core–shell nanoparticles with the NaGdF4:Yb active-shell have much stronger UC emission intensity than that with the NaGdF4 inert-shell (Fig. S1B, ESI†). It is understandable that the interaction between Er3+ ions and surface ligands/solvent molecules in the surrounding environment is essentially shielded after shell coating, so the fluorescence quenching effect caused by external factors has been almost completely avoided. In particular, the R/G ratio increased from 1.73 to 2.32 after the active shell was coated.

Fig. 3D displays the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ZnPc molecules, and the emission spectra of UCNPs and UCNPs@gel–ZnPc. A strong absorption band at 650–690 nm for the ZnPc solution overlaps perfectly with the emission band of UCNPs in the red emission region. Therefore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between UCNPs and ZnPc molecules will occur when irradiated by a 980 nm laser. This result also indicates that the ZnPc molecules were successfully decorated, and the distance between photosensitizers and the surface of UCNPs is no more than 10 nm, which allows for energy transfer. As expected, the red emission intensity of UCNPs@gel–ZnPc is significantly lower than that of UCNPs upon 980 nm light excitation, which further indicates the efficient energy transfer from Er3+ to ZnPc molecules. The luminescence mechanism and relevant energy level diagrams are depicted in Fig. 4. Firstly, the energy transfer from the 2H11/2/4S3/2 levels of Er3+ to the 4T1 level of Mn2+ contributes to the decreased green emission, and then the following energy back transfer from the 4T1 level of Mn2+ to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+ leads to the enhanced red emission.37 Secondly, the doping concentration in the active shell is 20 mol% and the value of the core is 18 mol%, which means the total concentration of Yb3+ is raised after coating. It has been proved for Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped nanoparticles that increasing the doping level of Yb3+ causes a corresponding relative increase in the R/G emission ratio, which is mainly responsible for populating the red emitting (4F9/2) state (left, Fig. 4). Finally, the increased Yb3+ ions transfer more energy to Er3+, and the Er3+ ions in the 4I11/2 excited intermediate state decay non-radiatively to the lower-lying 4I13/2 state. A subsequent energy transfer from the excited Yb3+ ions brings them directly to the 4F9/2 state. A consecutive transfer can excite the Er3+ ions from the 4F9/2 state to the 2H9/2 state and lead to the observed 2H9/2 → 4I11/2 red emission (right, Fig. 4).

The capping ligands on the surface of the UCNPs were identified by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 5). Both the as-prepared UCNPs and the ZnPc decorated samples exhibit a broad band at around 3450 cm−1, corresponding to the O–H stretching vibration. The strong transmission bands at 2924 and 2854 cm−1 are assigned to the asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretching vibrations of methylene (–CH2), respectively. The bands at 1564 and 1463 cm−1 are associated with the vibrations of the carboxylic group. For UCNPs@gel–ZnPc (Fig. 5B), a strong band at 1652 cm−1 is related to the stretching vibrations of carbonyl in amide bands, which abound in the peptide chains of gelatin. The new bands located at 1600–1450 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of the benzene skeleton in the ZnPc molecules, and some new bands located at 910–665 cm−1 are attributed to out-of-plane bending vibrations of –CH in the benzene rings.35 These results provide additional evidence for the decoration of ZnPc molecules.

Biocompatibility, cell-uptake, anti-tumor and imaging properties
To evaluate the biocompatibility of the sample for potential biomedical application, a standard MTT assay was carried out on L929 cell lines to detect their viability. The cell viability as a function of the sample concentration after incubation for 24 h is given in Fig. 6. It is apparent that the platform exhibits good biocompatibility at all dosages. Only a small variation in cell viability was found even at high concentrations of the samples. The L929 cell viability was 98.3% when incubated at a concentration of 800 μg mL−1, suggesting that the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite is non-toxic to L929 cells. Fig. 7 shows the CLSM images of HeLa cancer cells incubated with UCNPs@gel–FITC for 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 h at 37 °C, in order to verify the cell uptake process. The blue fluorescence is from the DAPI used to mark the nuclei, and the green emission is from the decorated FITC, used to track the carrier. The merging of the two channels is also given. In the first 0.5 h, there is little green emission, which reveals that only a few UCNPs@gel–FITC particles have been taken up by the HeLa cells. The stronger green fluorescence emission of FITC is observed in both the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus with the increased incubation time, suggesting that more particles are localized in the cells. The results further reveal that the UCNPs@gel–FITC carrier can be effectively taken up by tumor cells. Fig. 8A shows the absorbance spectra of the ZnPc solution and supernatant before and after the ZnPc loading experiment, and Fig. 8B shows the standard curve for ZnPc detection at an absorbance wavelength of 665 nm. According to the Beer–Lambert Law, it can be calculated that the ZnPc loading rate is about 71.3%. The photodynamic properties were examined and are presented in Fig. 8C. Here, the DPBF solution is utilized to evaluate the amount of generated ROS in the solution. When ROS are generated, DPBF is oxidized, leading to the decrease in the absorbance intensity at the wavelength of 410 nm. In Fig. 8C, when the NIR laser is used, the absorbance intensities decrease with prolonged time. From the calculated curve in Fig. 8D, the normalized absorbance at 20 min is 39.6%, indicating the effective generation of ROS.

Since the nanocomposite can generate ROS under near-infrared light, the PDT anticancer effects were further detected on HeLa cells in vitro. Fig. 9 displays the in vitro HeLa cell viabilities on incubation for 24 h with free UCNPs, and the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite with and without NIR irradiation at different concentrations. In order to avoid the influence of the thermal effect caused by a long laser exposure time, the irradiation time was controlled at just 3 minutes and the power of the laser machine was 0.5 W cm−2. For HeLa cells incubated with pure UCNPs, and nanocomposite, the viabilities were 96.2–99.8% and 97.8–99.6%, respectively, indicating that the pure UCNPs have low toxicity at high concentration, and the nanocomposite without NIR irradiation is nearly nontoxic to cancer cells. However, when the nanocomposites were added along with NIR irradiation, the cell viability was only 12.7–51.4%, which is markedly lower than that of the nanocomposite without NIR irradiation, revealing the photodynamic effects caused by the singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by the red up-conversion activated ZnPc molecules. The efficient PDT effect may play a significant role in the anticancer process. Fig. 10 shows the CLSM photographs of HeLa cancer cells incubated with nanocomposite only and with nanocomposite under irradiation. Calcein AM, which stains living cells with a green color, and PI, which stains dead cells with a red color, were used to dye the HeLa cells under different conditions, detected by CLSM, to prove the killing effect. It is obvious that the cells were effectively killed after incubation with the nanocomposite under NIR irradiation.

In Fig. 11, the confocal microscopy images indicate that obvious upconverted fluorescence from the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite was observed in the cancer cells under 980 nm light irradiation. The overlay image shows that the upconverted fluorescence was mainly located in the cytoplasm. In addition, no obvious morphology change of cancer cells was observed, implying the good biocompatibility of the nanoparticles encapsulated by the gelatin. These results indicate that the cell uptake and internalization of the nanocomposite were able to occur in cancer cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a UCNPs@gel–ZnPc anti-tumor nanoplatform has been rationally designed and applied for both UCL imaging and PDT. The use of gelatin with native amphiphilic structure and long polypeptides enables the transfer of the OA-coated UCNPs to the water phase, and the conjugation with ZnPc molecules. The doping of Mn2+ and coating with an active shell can simultaneously retain the total UCL emission intensity and enhance the red emission, which results in more energy being transferred to the photosensitizer, ZnPc, to effectively produce 1O2 for PDT. The as-prepared product has excellent biocompatibility and high anticancer efficiency, indicating that the nanocomposite has the potential for use in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Co. LLC (China). Gelatin was obtained from Tianjin Kermel Company. Sodium trifluoroacetate (CF3COONa), trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
Synthesis of the oleic-acid-stabilized β-NaGdF4:Yb,Er,Mn core. Oleic-acid-capped NaGdF4:Yb,Er,Mn was synthesized according to the method developed previously.66 Typically, 1.0 mmol of Yb(oleate)3/Er(oleate)3/Mn(oleate)2/Gd(oleate)3 (mol/mol/mol/mol = 0.18:0.02:x:0.8 − x), 5 mmol of NaF, and 15 mL of oleic acid (OA)/1-octadecene (ODE) (v/v = 1:1) mixed solvent were added to the reaction vessel and heated to 110 °C under vacuum for 30 min, to remove residual water and oxygen. After that, the temperature was increased to 300 °C and the reaction system was kept for 1.5 h in a N2 atmosphere. After the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, ethanol and cyclohexane were used to centrifuge the products. The finally obtained NaGdF4:Yb,Er,xMn nanoparticles were dispersed in 5 mL cyclohexane for further use.
Synthesis of OA-stabilized core–shell UCNPs
The cyclohexane solution of the above NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn nanoparticles was added to a three-neck reaction vessel, then 0.4 mmol of Gd(CF3COO)3, 0.1 mmol of Yb(CF3COO)3, 1 mmol CF3COONa and 15 mL of oleic acid (OA)/1-octadecene (ODE) (v/v = 1:1) solvent were added to the reaction vessel. The solvent was then heated to 120 °C under a vacuum with magnetic stirring for 1 h and flushed with N2. The temperature was increased to 310 °C and kept for 1 h in a N2 atmosphere, and the OA-coated NaGdF4:Yb,Er,0.4Mn@NaGdF4:Yb (abbreviated as UCNPs) were obtained.
Synthesis of FITC modified gelatin
Gelatin (2.4 g) and 6 mg FITC were dissolved in 25 mL Na2CO3 buffer (pH = 9.2). The solution was heated to 40 °C with magnetic stirring. After reacting for 8 h in the dark, the gelatin solution was transferred into a dialysis bag with Mw cutoff of 12000–14000 Da, and immersed in deionized water at 40 °C to remove the free FITC. The dialysis was performed for 3 days and the water was changed 4–6 times each day. Finally, the solution was poured into a culture dish and dried at 60 °C to obtain the yellow-colored FITC-modified gelatin slices.
Preparation of gelatin-encapsulated and ZnPc/FITC decorated UCNPs
Briefly, 15 mg of gelatin were added to a beaker with 15 mL deionized water, and then placed in an ultrasonic cleaner at about 40 °C. After the gelatin was well-distributed in deionized water (about 60 minutes), 5 mL of OA-coated UCNPs (6 mg mL−1) and 2 mL of ZnPc (2 mg mL−1) in cyclohexane were put into the beaker and stirred for 24 h to evaporate the organic solvent, following the self-assembly of UCNPs to form nanocomposite spheres. The hydrophobic UCNPs were transferred into water and decorated with ZnPc in a one-step process. The products were washed three times with deionized water to remove the free gelatin and residual ZnPc molecules. The final nanocomposite was denoted as UCNPs@gel–ZnPc. A similar experiment was carried out to obtain UCNPs@gel–FITC.
ROS detection of the nanocomposite
DPBF was employed as a chemical probe to determine singlet oxygen by measuring the absorption via UV-Vis spectroscopy. Typically, 1 mL of ethanol solution containing DPBF (1 mg mL−1) was mixed with 1 mL of nanocomposite solution (1 mg mL−1) and put into the 24-well plate. The solution was kept in the dark and irradiated by a 980 nm laser (pump power of 1.44 W cm−2) for different time periods (0, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min). The solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was collected for UV-Vis detection.

In vitro cytotoxicity of the nanocomposite
MTT was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the products against HeLa cells. Briefly, HeLa tumor cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 6000–7000 cells per well, then cultured at 37 °C for 24 h in 5% CO2. After that, the UCNPs and the UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite were introduced, and incubated with cells at 37 °C for another 24 h in 5% CO2. The nanocomposite incubated HeLa cells, with and without NIR irradiation, were used to study the photo guided cytotoxicity effect. The samples were diluted with respective concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 μg mL−1 for MTT assay. Then, 20 μL of the as-prepared MTT solution (5 mg mL−1) were added to each well. The plate was subsequently incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C. Finally, 150 μL of DMSO were added to each well, and the samples were shaken for 10 min in order to completely blend the solvent and the formazan. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. Optical density in the absence of drug was regarded as 100% growth. The in vitro viability of cells treated with the nanocomposite was similar to the results of the cytotoxicity MTT assay by incubation with L929 fibroblast cells, instead of HeLa cells.
Biocompatibility of the nanocomposite
L929 fibroblast cells were purchased from the cell bank, Chinese Academy of Science, China. Briefly, 6000–7000 L929 fibroblast cells were plated in 100 μL of media per well, in a 96-well plate, then incubated for 24 h so as to allow the cells to attach to the wells at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subsequently, the samples were diluted to concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 μg mL−1. The solutions with different concentrations were added and incubated for another 24 h. After that, 20 μL of the as-prepared MTT solution (5 mg mL−1) was introduced to each well, which was further incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. In the procedure, MTT was reduced by viable cells to formazan, which was dissolved in DMSO. Finally, 150 μL of DMSO were introduced into each well and shaken for 10 min to blend the solvent and the formazan completely. The absorbance was measured on a micro-plate reader at 490 nm wavelength. Optical density in the absence of drug was used as 100% growth.
Cell uptake
Cellular uptake by HeLa cancer cells was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The HeLa cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate (a clean coverslip was put into each well) and grown overnight as a monolayer. Then, they were incubated with as-prepared UCNPs@gel–FITC at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 h, respectively. After that, the cells were rinsed with PBS three times, fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde (1 mL well−1) at 37 °C for 10 min, and again rinsed three times with PBS. In order to perform nucleus labeling, the nuclei were stained with DAPI solution (20 μg mL−1 in PBS, 1 mL well−1) for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed three times with PBS. The coverslips were placed on a glass microscope slide, and the samples were visualized using CLSM (Leica TCS SP8).
Up-conversion luminescence observation
The HeLa cells used for up-conversion luminescence imaging were seeded in 6-well culture plates (5 × 104 well−1), and then incubated overnight as a monolayer. After that, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 mL of 1 mg mL−1 UCNPs@gel–ZnPc nanocomposite. The cells were then washed three times with PBS solution, and fixed with 1 mL of 2.5% formaldehyde in each well for 10 min at 37 °C. The as-prepared cells were again washed three times with PBS, in order to remove the attached nanocomposite.
Characterization
The ultrasonic cleaner was purchased from Kunshan, China (100 W). The samples for XRD analysis were prepared by depositing the nanoparticles solution on the glass slides and drying at 80 °C in a vacuum. X-Ray diffraction patterns of the particles were collected on a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were obtained from a FEI Tecnai G2 S-twin transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. UV-Vis absorption spectra were acquired by a TU-1901 dual beam UV-Vis spectrometer. Fourier-transform Infrared spectra (FT-IR) were tested on a Vertex Perkin-Elmer 580BIR spectrophotometer (Bruker), using the KBr pellet technique. Up-conversion emission spectra were measured on a R955 HAMAMATSU photomultiplier tube, from 400 to 800 nm, using a 980 nm laser diode module (K98D08M-30W, China) as the irradiation source.
