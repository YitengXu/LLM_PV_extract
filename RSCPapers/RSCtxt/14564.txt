    , Accepted 7th February 2018First published on 7th February 2018AbstractIn this communication, a concentrated solar light (CSL) annealing strategy is proposed with a Fresnel lens as the concentrator for rapid and effective crystallization of nanomaterials. More interestingly, the CSL can be integrated into photoelectrochemical devices and achieved an unprecedented photocurrent density.
Solar energy driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is currently one of the most promising approaches for solar energy applications,1,2 in which the absorption, conversion, and storage of solar energy can be integrated in a monolithic PEC system.3 Many semiconductors have been employed to fabricate the core components of the PEC system of photoelectrodes.4–10 High crystallinity is an essential requirement for all of them for guaranteeing efficient charge transfer. However, an effective crystallization process is usually implemented through thermal calcining in a furnace at elevated temperature, and the excessive non-renewable energy consumption in this process is inevitable to reduce or even offset the potential amounts of converted solar energy on these photoelectrodes. Therefore, novel crystallization processes are highly desirable with renewable energy input, and the exploration of such strategies is still a big challenge.
Solar energy is the most widely available renewable energy source. However, the solar flux is a fairly diffuse energy source, which cannot provide high enough temperature for the direct crystallization of semiconductors. Recently, solar thermal power plants have been rapidly commercialized with the use of concentrated solar light (CSL) to produce high temperature, thus to drive heat engines, and finally to generate electricity.11 Wiechen and Spiccia have proposed artificial photosynthesis under CSL to obtain a high conversion efficiency.12 Deng et al. have also reported the integration of CSL with a flexible thin-film thermoelectric device for sensitive detection of sunlight intensity.13 Thus, the high temperature obtained in the CSL system inspires us to propose a novel crystallization strategy with highly focused solar light as the sole renewable energy source. The CSL system is established through a simple Fresnel lens, which can generate enough high temperature for effective crystallization of photoelectrodes. In addition, the Fresnel lens is comprised of cheap plastics, which is beneficial for its large-scale application in low cost. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, an electrochemically anodized TiO2 nanotube (NT) photoelectrode is selected as a candidate for CSL crystallization because of the following reasons: (1) it is a widely investigated and utilized PEC material with good chemical and optical stability;14 (2) the anodized TiO2 NTs usually exhibit amorphous nature with insignificant PEC response before their crystallization,15 which allows us to distinctively evaluate the crystalline effectiveness through PEC measurements; and (3) the highly ordered and periodic nanostructures of TiO2 NTs can assist light harvesting in the whole solar spectrum, especially in the near-infrared (NIR) light region, which further enhances the light absorption from the CSL system and accelerates the crystallization process.16 Besides the anatase TiO2 NTs, to verify the universality of the CSL strategy, a series of other PEC materials of rutile TiO2 nanowires (NWs), hematite α-Fe2O3 NWs, and p-type CuO NWs have also been employed and annealed in the CSL system for crystallization. Finally, the CSL system has also been integrated into a PEC setup for water splitting and unprecedented high photocurrent density can be achieved.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the CSL system with a Fresnel lens (12 inch in diameter) as the light concentrator, in which the solar light is highly focused onto a spot with a dimension of around 1.0 cm2 on the surface of the photoelectrode. As shown in the top two insets in Fig. 1, the digital photos reveal a simple setup of the CSL system, and all energy input is supplied from renewable solar light. Very interestingly, even such a simple CSL system can provide strong light illumination with intensity about 13 suns and high enough temperature for photoelectrode crystallization. The increase in temperature as a function of time is recorded in the bottom inset in Fig. 1. The temperature fast elevated to more than 500 °C within a short duration of 30 s under illumination of the CSL system, and maintained for a long time, which is a high enough temperature to crystallize most of the photoelectrodes, and can be further increased through reducing the spot size for calcination of special materials. The relationship between the concentrated light spot size and the generated temperature is summarized in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†

The TiO2 NT photoelectrodes were prepared via a previously reported two-step electrochemical anodization method.17–19 The detailed procedures can be found in the Experimental section and Fig. S2 in the ESI.† In brief, the TiO2 NTs were formed on a cleaned Ti foil surface in a fluoride containing organic electrolyte in the first anodization process, and then completely eliminated with ultrasonic removal, whereas well-ordered nanocavities were left behind on the Ti foil surface. With these nanocavities as templates, the TiO2 NTs with unique nanostructures of top-nanoring–bottom-nanotube grew in the second anodization step. Finally, the anodized TiO2 NTs were annealed with the CSL system at a temperature of around 500 °C for crystallization.
The micro-morphologies of TiO2 NTs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, the top view SEM image presented a uniform surface on a large scale. A closer observation of the SEM image in Fig. 2b with higher magnification clearly revealed a highly ordered nanoring structure with a diameter of around 150 nm on the top surface of TiO2 NTs. In addition, the cross-sectional view SEM image (Fig. 2c) further depicted the unique top-nanoring–bottom-nanotube structure with a tube thickness of ∼2 μm. Furthermore, the TEM images in Fig. 2d and e also confirmed the formation of top-nanorings and bottom-nanotubes, respectively. More importantly, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2f presented well-resolved lattice fringes with inter-planar distances of 0.352 nm and 0.238 nm, corresponding to the anatase TiO2 (110) and (004) planes respectively, which indicated that the annealing in the CSL system enabled the change of the amorphous nature of anodized TiO2 NTs to the crystallized state.

To further elucidate the effectiveness of the CSL crystallization strategy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on the as-anodized TiO2 NTs (Fig. S3 in ESI†) and CSL annealed TiO2 NTs (CSL-TiO2 NTs) (Fig. 2g). No obvious TiO2 diffraction peaks can be found on the former sample, implying its amorphous state, whereas the sharp and strong XRD peaks on the latter sample clearly indicated its highly crystalline degree with a dominant diffraction peak at 25.3°, corresponding to the preferential orientation of the (101) plane (JCPDS No. 21-1272). Raman spectroscopy is a more sensitive tool than XRD to characterize crystal structure information. The Raman spectrum of CSL-TiO2 NTs is presented in Fig. 2h. The typical Raman shifts of anatase TiO2 at 146.2 cm−1 (Eg), 394.6 cm−1 (B1g), 514.8 cm−1 (A1g + B1g), and 637.7 cm−1 (Eg) were all detected, further proving its high crystalline degree.20
The optical absorption properties of the CSL-TiO2 NTs were also measured using diffusion reflectance spectroscopy and are presented in Fig. 2i. Obvious multi-band absorption peaks in ultraviolet (UV), visible (vis), and even NIR light regions were observed. However, due to the wide band gap of TiO2, the TiO2 NTs only absorbed the photons in UV regions, and the vis and NIR photons were scattered in the top-nanoring layer, which contributed to the unique multi-absorption phenomena.21 The unique light harvesting ability would be beneficial for significantly enhancing the absorption of CSL, and thus further accelerated the crystallization rates. Therefore, the above-mentioned characterization results indicated that the CSL annealing strategy has successfully implemented the rapid crystallization of TiO2 NT photoelectrodes.
As the CSL system can provide high temperature for crystallization within a very short time of 30 s, the CSL crystallization time should be optimized on the TiO2 NT photoelectrodes. Linear sweep photovoltammetry (LSPV) measurements were performed with the CSL-TiO2 NTs, annealed with different times in the CSL system, as photoanodes in a 1 M NaOH supporting electrolyte under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. S4 in ESI†). The relationship between the CSL annealing time and photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) is summarized in Fig. 3a. The water oxidation potential of 1.23 V is often chosen as a metric to evaluate the PEC performance of photoanodes. The photocurrent densities of the CSL-TiO2 NT samples increased with increasing illumination time, and reached a high steady platform after 30 min. Typically, at least 3–6 h were necessary for good crystallization with thermal treatment in a furnace at temperatures more than 500 °C, and the short CSL annealing time of 30 min suggested that the CSL system can provide a very rapid crystallization process. Now, the next question is whether the CSL annealed sample exhibits the same good PEC performance as their thermally treated counterparts in a furnace. To answer this question, two as-anodized TiO2 NT samples were separately annealed in a CSL system for 30 min and thermally treated in a furnace for 5 h at the same temperature of 500 °C. LSPV measurements on these two samples were performed and the results are presented in Fig. 3b, and the CSL-TiO2 NT sample demonstrated superior PEC performance to their thermally treated counterparts (TT-TiO2 NTs) due to the synergic effects of high crystallinity and the rapid crystallization rate, which limited the formation of barrier layers between the TiO2 NTs and Ti foil within such a short annealing duration.22 In addition, the photo-conversion of CSL-TiO2 NTs under the illumination of simulated solar light of AM 1.5G was calculated using the following equation:23 (1)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Jlight is the incident light irradiance (mW cm−2), Erev° is the standard reversible potential, which is 1.23 V vs. RHE, and V is the applied bias potential vs. RHE. The highest photo-conversion efficiency of 0.13% has been recorded on CSL-TiO2 NTs.

To further elucidate the advantage of CSL crystallization and to estimate the PEC activity of the CSL-TiO2 NTs as a function of wavelength of light, incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values were measured using a two-electrode model without external bias. The IPCE values can be calculated with the following equation and are plotted in Fig. 3c:24 IPCE (%) = 1240I/λJlight × 100%(2)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Jlight is the incident light irradiance (mW cm−2), and λ is the incident light wavelength (nm). In comparison to the TT-TiO2 NTs, the CSL-TiO2 NTs exhibited higher IPCE values due to its efficient separation and transport of photo-generated carriers.
In the practical application of the TiO2-based photoelectrode in PEC water splitting, the biggest concern is its low photocurrent densities under illumination of simulated solar light of AM 1.5G, most of which are far less than the benchmark value of 10 mA cm−2 due to its large intrinsic band gap (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile).25,26 In addition, the fairly diffuse solar flux with ∼1017 solar photons impinging on the surface area of 1 cm2 each second, that is, only ∼100 solar photons interact with one surface atomic site (typical area of 10 Å2) each second, establishes significant limitations on the maximum reaction rates.27 For addressing these concerns, the CSL strategy can not only provide high temperature for the crystallization of photoelectrodes, but also significantly enhance the energy input for efficient water splitting, which would significantly accelerate the water splitting process. The PEC performance of the CSL-TiO2 NTs under illumination of CSL was also estimated. It is noteworthy that the CSL was first filtered through cycling cool water and coated on the outer surface of PEC cells before it reached the PEC setup to maintain the experimental temperature at 25 °C. As presented in Fig. 3d, the CSL-TiO2 NT photoelectrode showed an extremely high photocurrent density of 19.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than the benchmark value of 10 mA cm−2 in the PEC water splitting process for real practical application of hydrogen generation.28 The maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 0.73% was also achieved on the CSL-TiO2 NTs under illumination of CSL. In addition, the TiO2 NTs presented good stability both under illumination of 1 sun and CSL (Fig. S5 in ESI†). Furthermore, the generated hydrogen gas was also measured with a high generation rate of 5.93 μmol min−1 (Fig. S6 in ESI†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to further characterize the conductivity after CSL crystallization (Fig. S7 in ESI†). The TiO2 NTs under illumination of 1 sun or CSL showed much lower resistance than that in the dark, which indicated that the high crystallinity after CSL annealing facilitated the electron transfer. The significantly enhanced photo-conversion efficiency was unprecedented and clearly illustrated the extraordinary potential for achieving high efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen conversion after further optimizing the system, which suggested that the CSL strategy could be a promising method to rebound the PEC water splitting from an underachiever (full of promise, sound in theory but poor on implementation) to a real achiever.
To verify the universality of the CSL crystallization strategy, a series of other commonly utilized PEC nanomaterials of rutile TiO2 NWs (Fig. S8 in ESI†), hematite α-Fe2O3 NWs (Fig. S9 in ESI†), and p-type CuO NWs (Fig. S10 in ESI†), fabricated through different methods,29–31 were also crystallized in this CSL system. As shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†), after CSL annealing, the rutile TiO2 NWs presented good crystallinity with a clear lattice distance of 0.325 nm and a dominant orientation of the (110) plane, and exhibited good PEC performance. In a very similar manner, the α-Fe2O3 NWs also presented good crystallinity after CSL annealing and efficient PEC performance (Fig. S11b in ESI†). The as-fabricated Cu(OH)2 NWs (Fig. S12 in ESI†) were annealed in the CSL system to convert and crystallize to p-type CuO NW photocathodes, and a high photocathodic current was recorded (Fig. S11c in ESI†). Therefore, the CSL has been proved to be a versatile strategy for the crystallization of nanomaterials. Furthermore, the PEC performances of these materials under illumination of CSL were also measured, and all of them presented extremely high photocurrent density, 24.9 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE on TiO2 NWs, 14.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE on α-Fe2O3 NWs, and −24.3 mA cm−2 on p-type CuO NWs at 0 V vs. RHE, which further revealed the fast PEC water splitting applications in the CSL system. All of these photocurrent density and photo-conversion efficiency data are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†
In summary, a CSL annealing strategy was proposed with a Fresnel lens as the concentrator for effective crystallization of nanomaterials with renewable solar energy input. The CSL system can generate a high enough temperature of more than 500 °C, which enabled the crystallization of a series of commonly employed PEC nanomaterials, such as TiO2 NTs, TiO2 NWs, α-Fe2O3 NWs, and CuO NWs, for efficient PEC applications. More interestingly, under illumination of the CSL system, unprecedented photocurrent densities were achieved on the CSL-nanomaterials, suggesting its potential practical applications for efficient solar energy conversion.
