    , Accepted 13th April 2012First published on 13th April 2012AbstractA new series of bis-tridentate, thiocyanate-free Ru(II) complexes (TF-21–TF-24), containing the 2-azolyl-6-phenylpyridine cyclometalate, were synthesized. Upon switching from a pyrazolyl to a more electron deficient triazolyl moiety, the oxidation potentials were fine-tuned to readily accept electrons from the I−/I3− redox couple, so that the dye regeneration proceeds efficiently amid the device operation. This, together with high concentrations of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide in the electrolyte which accelerates dye regeneration, attains a short-circuit photocurrent density as high as 18.09 mA cm−2 and an overall efficiency of 9.04%. The trifling decrease (3–6%) in efficiency after 1000 h of illumination at 60 °C manifests the high device stability, due to the much suppressed solvent volatility in combination with the robust bis-tridentate structure involved in cyclometalating the 2-azolyl-6-phenylpyridine ancillary.

Broader context
The dye-sensitized solar cell has been considered one of the best photovoltaic technologies due to the ecological motivations and cost related issues. Ru(II)-based sensitizers are still considered superior sensitizers, attributed to their high stability and capability of harvesting the greatest proportion of solar radiation. This has triggered extensive research endeavours towards modifying their structure for even better efficiency. In the present article, we illustrated the synthesis of a series of new Ru(II) sensitizers possessing both a tricarboxy terpyridine anchor and a dianionic 2-azolyl-6-phenylpyridine chromophoric ancillary. We also demonstrated clear elucidation on the strategy of fine-tuning the electrochemical potential and the application of an iodide-rich electrolyte, both of which are critical for facilitating dye regeneration and hence improving the efficiency. Our results thus underline the solid foundation for future DSC sensitizers with outstanding efficiencies.

Among all major constituents vital to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), photosensitizers are responsible for light harvesting, while suitable photoanodes, redox couples and counter electrodes are utilized to achieve efficient charge separation, collection and transportation. The major challenge of this emergent technology is to integrate each of the components into a highly efficient, single photonic device.1–7 In 2001, Grätzel et al. developed a panchromatic Ru(II) complex N749 (also known as black dye) with a detectable absorption extended to 920 nm.8 Although the certified power conversion efficiency of N749-sensitized solar cells exceeding 11% has been achieved by enhancing the haze of the TiO2 photoanode,9 researchers are still searching for efficient Ru(II) sensitizers with polypyridine chelates, such as 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (H2dcbpy)10–16 and 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine (H3tctpy),17–20 disregarding the possession or absence of a thiocyanate ancillary, respectively. Along this line, cyclometalating aromatics were also implemented into the sensitizer's design, owing to their robust chelating interaction towards improving the optical responses as well as to extend the absorption profile towards the near-infrared region.21–23
While this approach seems feasible, it was well known that the replacement of a nitrogen donor by a formal carbanion donor would substantially increase the electron density around the metal atom,24–26 giving less positive electrochemical potentials vs. NHE. In contrast, the highly efficient Ru(II) DSC sensitizers commonly possess Ru2+/Ru3+ potentials close to or greater than ca. +0.9 V, while maintaining a sizable overpotential vs. I−/I3− couple to ensure the fast regeneration of the oxidized sensitizer.27 To circumvent this limitation, one solution is to attach a strong electron withdrawing group onto the cyclometalating ancillary so that oxidation potentials can be adequately controlled.28 Alternatively, the incorporation of 2,6-bis(3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-5-yl) pyridine (H2pz2py) has recently been shown to be a feasible approach for the preparation of terpyridine Ru(II) sensitizers without sacrificing the devices performance.29 Encouraged by these findings, we herein report a new set of bis-tridentate Ru(II) sensitizers, with a [Ru(H3tctpy)(azppy)] formula (Scheme 1), in which the azppy ancillary comprises a potentially dianionic 2-(azol-5-yl)-6-phenylpyridine (H2azppy) that incorporates both azole (c.f. either pyrazole or triazole) and a heteroaromatic fragment with electron deficient substituents. As a result, our strategy produces a facile and efficient pathway for concurrently fine-tuning the photophysical and electrochemical properties of these newly developed Ru(II) sensitizers.
 Scheme 1  Structural drawing of the cyclometalating chelates and the associated Ru(II) complexes. 
The tridentate H2azppy ligands are prepared before becoming engaged in the preparation of the desired TF-21–TF-24 Ru(II) sensitizers. In brief, 6-acetyl (or cyano) substituted 2-bromopyridine is reacted with the respective 3,2-dioxaborolane or boronic acid derivative, utilizing Suzuki cross-coupling to afford the functionalized phenylpyridine derivatives. Subsequently, the 6-acetyl and 6-cyano functional groups are converted to CF3 substituted pyrazol-5-yl and 1,2,4-triazol-5-yl fragments, respectively, using the established cyclization procedures.30 The synthetic routes are summarized in Scheme 2, together with the appropriate experimental conditions. These ligands, L1–L4, are then reacted with [Ru(tcetpy)Cl3] to give the corresponding ethoxycarbonyl intermediates [Ru(tcetpy)(azppy)] in good yields, tcetpy = 4,4′,4′′-tricarboethoxyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine. Further treatment of these ethoxycarbonyl intermediates with NaOH in an acetone–water mixture gives the hydrolyzed [Ru(H3tctpy)(azppy)] products with a high purity and excellent yields, and is then followed by acidification.

The UV-Vis spectra of these TF dyes in DMF are depicted in Fig. 1. Using TF-21 as a representative example, besides the higher energy band attributed to the intra-ligand π–π* transition, TF-21 exhibits two low-lying strong absorption bands at 404 and 520 nm, both of which are mainly attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, mixed, to a certain extent, with ligand-centered π–π* transitions. Noticeably, these bands are more intense than those observed in N749, and their extinction coefficients descend steadily towards longer wavelengths. Moreover, there exists a weak shoulder in the region of 670–700 nm, similar to that reported for other terpyridine complexes.31Via the assistance of time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations, the absorption bands (singlet state excitation) of TF-21 and TF-22 are identified as specific vertical lines, shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively.

It is believed that oxidation potentials would provide first-hand information on whether these newly developed dyes can be efficiently regenerated by the I−/I3− redox couple. The Ru2+/Ru3+ oxidation potential (Eox°) of TF-21 is measured as 0.84 V (vs. NHE), which is larger than that of the I−/I3− redox potential (∼0.35 V vs. NHE),32,33 but is unfortunately very close to the redox potential of the I−/I2˙− couple (ca. 0.79 ± 0.1 V vs. NHE).27,34,35 The small difference in the potential versus the I−/I2˙− couple may lead to inefficient dye regeneration despite TF-21 revealing the highest extinction coefficient in the longer wavelength region among all the Ru(II) complexes studied.36 To solve this problem, we synthesized additional Ru(II) derivatives (TF-22–TF-24), replacing the CF3 functionalized pyrazolyl with triazolyl fragments. As can be seen in Table 1, due to their stronger electron withdrawing characteristics, both TF-22 and TF-23 showed a more positive Ru2+/Ru3+ couple of 0.92 V vs. NHE, which is irrespective of the position of the CF3 substituent on the phenyl cyclometalate and significantly extends the driving force of the dye regeneration. Moreover, with an additional electron withdrawing fluoro substituent, the TF-24 sensitizer has the largest oxidation potential, i.e. 0.96 V (vs. NHE) and hence yields the largest driving force. The excited state oxidation potential from the oxidized sensitizers (E°*) was then calculated from their Ru2+/Ru3+ couple and the optical energy gap. For typical Ru dyes, since the electron injection could be from either a singlet or triplet manifold, the gaps of the 0–0 onsets of the lowest absorption band and the phosphorescence are then used to deduce E°* for the singlet and triplet excited states, respectively. Alternatively, the energy of S1 and T1, calculated via TD-DFT (see Table 1), can be utilized to replace the spectral onset. Table 1 lists the excited state oxidation potentials for the first singlet excited state EoS* and triplet state EoT*, calculated using the above mentioned spectral onsets. For both the singlet and triplet states, the resulting data is all more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 anode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE) and hence guarantees the efficient injection of photoelectrons.

abs and λem represent the respective peak maxima, measured in DMF, in nm. Eox° was estimated from the oxidation potential measured in DMF with 0.1 M [TBA][PF6]; it was then calibrated with the Fc/Fc+ potential and converted to NHE by the addition of 0.63 V. ES0–0 and ET0–0 were estimated from the onset of the lowest energy absorption and phosphorescence, respectively. EoS* and EoT* were calculated according to the equations Eox° − ES0–0 and Eox° − ET0–0, respectively. S1 and T1 stand for the calculated first singlet excited state energy and the lowest triplet state energy in nm, respectively.

DSCs were first fabricated by employing a 12 μm thick TiO2 layer (20 nm) plus a 7 μm scattering layer (400 nm). The photoanode was stained by the respective dye solution (0.3 mM) in ethanol, together with DMSO (20%, v/v) and CDCA (1 mM) for 18 h. An electrolyte solution with 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15), was used in these studies. Initially, the DSC fabricated using the TF-22 dye afforded good performances with JSC = 16.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 700 mV, FF = 0.69 and η = 7.97% under a AM 1.5 G simulated one-sun condition. The pertinent data is listed in Table S1 of the ESI.† Furthermore, upon doubling the concentration of DMII up to 2.0 M, an even better JSC of 17.4 mA cm−2 was achieved, affording a conversion efficiency of η = 8.26%. This improvement is in agreement with recent reports on faster dye regeneration under a higher concentration of iodide, upon employment of Z90737 and an Os(II) sensitizer.38 Hereafter, this modified electrolyte is used for the fabrication of all other DSC devices.
Further optimization of the DSCs was achieved by employing a thicker TiO2 anode of 15 + 7 μm, with the aim of improving the loading of the sensitizers, which is expected to increase both the absorption optical length and give a higher short-circuit photocurrent density JSC. Indeed, this manoeuvre has proved to be a positive move as it shows the best JSC of 18.09 mA cm−2 for the TF-22 based DSCs as well as a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.76% (see Table 2), while other sensitizers afforded η values in the range of 4.76 to 9.04% under identical conditions (the detailed device parameters upon conducting the device optimization are shown in Table S1 in the ESI †for scrutiny). Given the best η = 9.04% was from TF-24 and a markedly inferior η value of 4.76% from TF-21, it appears that their inherent oxidation potential is of prime importance to the dye regeneration and hence accounts for the overall efficiencies. The J–V characteristics and IPCE action diagrams are depicted in Fig. 3. It is notable that TF-21, which possesses a less electron withdrawing pyrazolyl fragment, exhibits the worst J–V characteristics and IPCE at all the wavelengths among this series of Ru(II) sensitizers, c.f. TF-22–TF-24. On the other hand, the IPCE value of TF-24 is ∼82% at 550 nm and maintains a high value of ∼70% in the longer wavelength region up to 680 nm. Moreover, it is worth noting that the IPCE values of both TF-22 and TF-23 are superior to that of TF-24 in the longer wavelength region that goes beyond 700 nm, despite showing relatively inferior IPCE values in the shorter wavelength region. For a comparison, DSCs fabricated using N749 as a reference sensitizer showed comparable IPCE data (i.e. light harvest efficiencies) between the region of 450 and 700 nm, and eventually afforded cell performance data: JSC = 17.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 720 mV, FF = 0.70 and η = 8.75%. The integration of IPCE spectral data from the region between 350 and 900 nm shows a deviation of ≤6% between the measured and calculated JSC, which is considered to be within the experimental errors.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also performed, under dark conditions, at a fixed forward bias of 0.7 V to gain a higher perception of these DSCs.39 As shown in Fig. 4, the main semicircle in the Nyquist plot under these conditions displays the impedance to resist electron recombination. The trend of TF-24 > N749 > TF-22–TF-23 > TF-21 is consistent with the descending order of the corresponding VOC (see Table 2). The lowest η value from TF-21 is caused by not only the high electron recombination but also the inefficient dye regeneration, owing to a shallow Eox° level compared with the rest of the TF sensitizers studied. Note that the η values from TF-22 (8.76%) and TF-23 (8.56%) varies only slightly. This small discrepancy falls within the estimated standard deviation and may be caused by the device construction and data measurements. Nevertheless, as indicated by the least electron recombination under these dark conditions (c.f.Fig. 4), TF-24 renders a maximum VOC among all the TF sensitizers and N749.

Device fabrication was also attempted using the deprotonated TF-22 and TF-24 sensitizers, for which the deprotonation was achieved by the addition of 3 equiv. of tetrabutylammonium deoxycholate [TBA][DOC] into the dye solution, such that the in situ metathesis of the carboxylic acid and carboxylate anion between the dye and additive molecules can take place prior to the dye adsorption. As expected, this manoeuvre on the TF-22 sensitized cell gives a slightly increased VOC of 0.73 V, but a decreased JSC of 16.65 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.677, compared to the untreated reference solution (Table 2). Such an observation is attributed to the higher electron density on the TiO2 surface induced by the adsorbed carboxylate, which then lifts the Fermi level of TiO2 and, in turn, raises the VOC and decreases the JSC.40 For confirmation, the TF-24 sensitizer gives a similar trend of an increased VOC and reduced JSC under the same experimental conditions.
Last but not least, if more viscous electrolytes were applied in this study, it would offer the advantage of suppressing the vapor pressure for the electrolyte solution and hence, would prolong the operation life span under accelerated light soaking.41 This is evidenced by the outstanding stability for our TF-22–TF-24 sensitizers examined under one-sun irradiation at 60 °C for 1000 h, as shown in Fig. 5, for which the devices were fabricated using an electrolyte solution containing 2.0 M DMII, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M GuNCS and 0.5 M N-butyl-1H-benzimidazole (NBB) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The overall decline of the cell efficiency, defined as (ηmax − η1000h)/ηmax, is found to be 2.7%, 5.7% and 3.9% for TF-22–TF-24, respectively, for which the values are much smaller than those obtained for the N749 reference cell (∼39%) under identical conditions. Alternatively, this ∼39% reduction in efficiency for the N749 reference is greater than the reported decline of 22% for a set of stability measurements employing an electrolyte with a lower ratio of iodide versus iodine (1.1 M/0.15 M).20 The results thus highlight the excellent stability of the TF series of sensitizers against possible iodide attack under the current conditions.
 Fig. 5  Evolution of the DSC performances of TF-22–TF-24 and N749 measured under AM 1.5 G sunlight-soaking at 60 °C. A 370 nm cut-off long pass filter was placed on top of the cells during illumination. 3-methoxypropionitrile, with a boiling point of 164 °C, was used as the solvent for the long-term test. 
In conclusion, bis-tridentate Ru(II) complexes with functionalized 2-(azol-5-yl)-6-phenylpyridines were rationally designed and synthesized and their respective DSCs were fabricated and tested. These Ru(II) sensitizers present notable near-infrared absorptions up to 880 nm. Upon substituting triazolyl for pyrazolyl fragments, the oxidation potential can be downward shifted by ∼0.08 V (c.f. TF-21 vs. TF-23), giving a greater driving force to facilitate dye regeneration by the standard I−/I3− redox couple. Improvement in the JSC, VOC and even overall efficiency was noticed upon the employment of up to 2.0 M of DMII in the electrolyte. Finally, highly stable DSCs have been achieved, showing an efficiency degradation of only 3–6% under 1000 hours of light soaking at 60 °C, which can be attributed to the robust chemical bonding between the azppy chelate and the Ru(II) metal center, as well as the much suppressed volatility of the electrolytes.

One reviewer pointed out that our previously reported Ru(II) sensitizers, PRT1–PRT4 in ref. 18, showed oxidation potentials in the range 0.60–0.71 V, but can still exhibit respectable efficiency for the fabricated DSCs. After repeating the measurement, the corresponding new data are found to be 0.97, 0.95, 0.95 and 0.96 V, consistent with the conclusion drawn in the present manuscript.

Broader context
The dye-sensitized solar cell has been considered one of the best photovoltaic technologies due to the ecological motivations and cost related issues. Ru(II)-based sensitizers are still considered superior sensitizers, attributed to their high stability and capability of harvesting the greatest proportion of solar radiation. This has triggered extensive research endeavours towards modifying their structure for even better efficiency. In the present article, we illustrated the synthesis of a series of new Ru(II) sensitizers possessing both a tricarboxy terpyridine anchor and a dianionic 2-azolyl-6-phenylpyridine chromophoric ancillary. We also demonstrated clear elucidation on the strategy of fine-tuning the electrochemical potential and the application of an iodide-rich electrolyte, both of which are critical for facilitating dye regeneration and hence improving the efficiency. Our results thus underline the solid foundation for future DSC sensitizers with outstanding efficiencies.
