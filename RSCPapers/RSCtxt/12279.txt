    , Accepted 14th August 2017First published on 15th August 2017AbstractBismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been regarded as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting owing to its rich elemental abundance and relatively narrow bandgap. However, the incompatibility of the penetration depth and short diffusion length limits its performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we develop a cost-effective stamping method to fabricate inverse nanocone array (ICA) substrates for supporting nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 films. The ICAs show a remarkable light trapping effect in such a way that the intensive light absorption region is advantageously shifted from the top of the active layer on a planar substrate to the bottom surrounded by the ICA, where charge separation is strikingly more efficient. By integrating the ICA-photoanode with a tailor-made, bandgap-adjustable perovskite solar cell, we devised a PEC-photovoltaic (PEC-PV) tandem device, which has achieved a self-powered STH efficiency of around 6.3%. Our study opens a new avenue for designing solar fuel devices with PEC-PV architectures.
1. Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into chemical bonds is an engaging prospect for the storage of renewable energy.1–5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells represent a convenient pathway by which hydrogen generation from water using solar energy might be realized.6–10 However, the integration of low price, high efficiency and long term stability in one material is still a challenge.11 Over the past few years, extensive efforts have been made to develop bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) based photoanodes because of its low-cost, relatively narrow bandgap of 2.4 eV and low valence band edge position for the oxygen evolution reaction.12–15 Strides have recently been made to shorten its hole transport length by changing its structure to nanoporous, enhance its light absorption by light trapping, enlarge its electron density by doping and improve its surface reactivity with water by co-catalyst coating, which pushed its applied bias photon to current (ABPE) conversion efficiency to around 2%.8,12–18 Although great achievements have been made in its hole diffusion, light absorption and activity of co-catalysts, its charge separation efficiency is still unsatisfactory.19,20 This has resulted in an AM 1.5 photocurrent of less than 6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while the maximum theoretical value is 7.5 mA cm−2.16 Our previous study has shown that charge separation in the BiVO4 film is highly dependent on the light absorption distribution, where high intensity light absorption suppresses the trapping process during carrier diffusion and induces high charge separation efficiency. Along this line, it is highly promising to develop an efficient light management strategy towards optimal light absorption distribution in photoanodes.
In this work, we presented an inverse nanocone array (ICA) structure as the light trapping substrate for supporting nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) by a cost-effective stamping method. The light absorption of nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA structure was proved to be redistributed where the intensive absorption region was moved from the top part on the planar substrate to the bottom part, close to the charge collector. In the intensive light absorption region, the electrons could transport two orders of magnitude faster than in the weak absorption region, so the recombination inside BiVO4 is largely suppressed.9 Thus, the redistributed light absorption enables more efficient charge separation on the ICA substrates than that on the planar ones. As a result, the photoanode delivered a remarkable ABPE value of 2.30% at 0.65 V vs. the RHE. Remarkably, such a high efficiency comes about at a low cost of our new stamping method, indeed much lower than that of the Cl2-based reactive ion etching method reported previously due to the great reusability of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp and the replacement of the expensive silicon substrate by Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and PDMS. Therefore, this stamping strategy is much more amenable to large scale fabrication and suitable for practical applications. Moreover, we designed and constructed a PEC-perovskite solar cell (PSC) tandem device to achieve a self-powered water splitting system. The bandgap of the PSCs was deliberately tuned by composition engineering to match that of the Mo:BiVO4-based PEC cell, bringing the STH efficiency to a new level of 6.3%.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Aluminium foil (0.25 mm thick, 99.99% purity), PbI2 (metal basis, 99.999%) and PbBr2 (metal basis, 99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 184 SIL ELAST KIT) was purchased from Dow Corning. TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD), MAI and FAI were purchased from Dyesol. IPA (HPLC, ≥99.9%) was purchased from Duksan. PC60BM (≥97%) was purchased from Nano-C. All other chemicals were the products of Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without any purification.
2.2 Fabrication of inverse nanocone array molds
The soft PDMS nanocone array mold was fabricated by the previously reported methods.21–23 Firstly, an electrochemically polished Al foil was imprinted with a hard silicon stamp with hexagonally ordered nanopillars with a height of 100 nm and a pitch distance of 1 μm to create a nanoindentation array on its surface. Afterwards, the inverse nanocone array was formed by a multi-step electrochemical anodization and wet etching process in an acidic solution by applying a suitable direct-current (DC) voltage. Subsequently, a 50 nm Au film was evaporated on the surface of the as-prepared Al2O3 films with the inverse nanocone array to reduce the adhesion between PDMS and Al2O3. Thereafter, the pre-mixed PDMS (10:1 with the curing agent) was drop coated on the Au-covered Al2O3 films. Then, they were placed under vacuum for 30 min at room temperature to exclude residual gas inside liquid phase PDMS. The degassed PDMS on Al2O3 films was then cured at 80 °C for 30 min. Eventually, the PDMS mold was carefully peeled off. The thickness of the PDMS mold was adjusted to around 1.5 mm. A m-TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s using a commercial TiO2 paste diluted with 1-butanol with a weight ratio of 1:1. The PDMS mold was immediately pressed on the wet m-TiO2 film with a continuous pressure of ∼2.7 × 104 Pa. Then, the m-TiO2 film with the PDMS mold was heated to 110 °C for 20 min. After the m-TiO2 film cooled down, the PDMS mold was carefully removed and a stable inverse cone array (ICA) was constructed. The ICA-TiO2 film was then sintered at 550 °C for 2 h to remove the residual organic ligand. Finally, a 50 nm Pt layer was sputtered and a 50 nm SnO2 layer was sprayed onto the ICA-TiO2 film.
2.3 Preparation of nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 on the planar and ICA substrates
A precursor solution for the preparation of Mo-doped BiVO4 photoelectrodes contained 0.5 M bismuth nitrate, 0.6 M vanadyl isopropoxide and a certain amount of bis(acetylacetonato) dioxomolybdenum(VI) in acetylacetonate and ethanol (v/v = 50:50). The precursor solution was deposited on the ICA substrates or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates using a controllable spin coating technique. BiVO4 photoelectrodes were obtained by annealing the samples at 300 °C for 1 h and 450 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. Excess V2O5 was removed in 1 M NaOH solution at 50 °C for 15 min with gentle stirring. The resulting Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes were rinsed with water several times to remove the residual solution and then air dried at room temperature. The optimized Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes were obtained with a Mo doping concentration of ∼3%.
2.4 Surface modification of the FeOOH/NiOOH co-catalyst
The FeOOH/NiOOH layer was deposited as follows. Using photo-assisted deposition (1 sun, AM 1.5G), FeOOH was deposited in a 0.1 M FeSO4 solution under 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl for 13 min. NiOOH was then deposited in 0.1 M NiSO4 (pH was adjusted to 6.7 with a basic solution) under 0.11 V versus Ag/AgCl for 6 min. Finally, one additional NiOOH layer was formed by electrodeposition in 0.1 M NiSO4 under 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl for 1.5 min.
2.5 Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation
A 3D FDTD-method Maxwell solver designed by Lumerical was employed to simulate the absorption profile of Mo:BiVO4 on different substrates. The structural parameters were based on the SEM images of actual devices. The complex refractive index of TiO2, FTO and BiVO4 was collected from the databases and previous studies.23,24 A plane wave source with different wavelength ranges was incident from the z-axis. Periodical boundary conditions were applied to x and y axes for a unit cell.
2.6 Fabrication of bandgap tunable PSCs
The NiO films were deposited according to our previous work.25,26 In brief, patterned FTO glass substrates were cleaned by successive sonication in de-ionized water, acetone, iso-propanol and ethanol for 30 minutes. After being dried at 120 °C, FTO glass substrates were placed under UV-ozone treatment for 30 minutes. The NiO precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Afterwards, the NiO films were sintered at 550 °C for 2 h in air followed by cooling down to room temperature. The MAPbI3 based PSCs were fabricated by a reported method.25 For the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2Br based PSCs, the perovskite solutions were prepared by dissolving PbI2, FAI, CsI and PbBr2 of desired compositions in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a volume ratio of 2:3 and stirred at 60 °C overnight. The perovskite dispersion consists of 1.2 M perovskite with 0.12 M PbI2. The perovskite layer was deposited according to a reported method with minor modifications.27 Specifically, 35 μL of perovskite dispersion was dropped onto the substrate and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s. At the 5th second of the second step, 0.7 mL of toluene was poured onto the spinning film. After the spin-coating, the perovskite films were annealed at 95 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the cooled perovskite films were coated with PCBM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm of silver was thermally evaporated onto the substrate through a shadow mask with the active area confined by the cathode and anode being 0.10 cm2.
2.7 Materials characterization
The morphologies of TiO2 and Mo:BiVO4 deposited on the glass substrate were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7100F). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and transmission spectra were measured using an UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, model Lambda 20). For the diffuse reflectance mode, BaSO4 was taken as the reference.
2.8 Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical measurements
Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical measurements utilized simulated solar illumination obtained using a 300 W Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 global filter (Newport). J–V curves were recorded on an IM6x electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co.). Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes were used as the working electrodes, a Pt net served as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. All electrodes were immersed in a quartz electrolytic cell; the photoelectrode was covered by ethoxyline except for a window for light illumination. The illuminated area was fixed to 0.25 cm2. All photoanodes are illuminated from the BiVO4 side (light does not pass through FTO).
The power density of the incident light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using a thermopile detector and a National Renewable Energy Laboratory certified reference cell. Photocurrent measurements were performed in a 0.5 M potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) buffer solution (pH 7) [reported with respect to the RHE; E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.1976 V + 0.059 pH]. N2 gas was purged through the cell during the measurements to instantaneously flush away O2 from the working electrode. J–V curves were measured by sweeping the potential to the positive direction with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. IPCE spectra were measured using a Zahner ZENNIUM CIMPS system. IPCE was measured at the reversible water oxidation potential of 1.23 V versus the RHE in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) using the same three-electrode setup described above for photocurrent measurements.
The applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (η) for a water-splitting photoelectrode that requires an applied bias can be evaluated using the equation:η = J (1.23 V − Vapp)/Plightwhere Vapp is the applied voltage versus the RHE, J is the externally measured current density, and Plight is the power density of the illumination.
To construct a PEC-PV tandem device, standard solar light (1 sun) was separated into two beams using a beam splitter (515 nm). The light beam (<515 nm) was used for testing the performance of PEC cells, and the other light beam was used for measuring the performance of PSCs. The area of the splitter is 4 inch × 4 inch. The overall water-splitting efficiency (ηSTH) of the photoelectrolysis system is estimated by overlapping the individual J–V curve obtained from a PSC and a photoanode and can be calculated usingηSTH = 1.23 V (JOP)/Plightwhere JOP is the maximum operating current density of the integrated PEC system, which is the current density at the intersection of the two J–V curves.
The charge separation efficiency is calculated from the equation:13Φsep = JPEC/(Jabs × Φox)where Jabs is the theoretical current density of photoanodes calculated from its absorption spectrum, “JPEC/Φox” can be regarded as the current density of photoanodes towards the oxidation reaction with the hole scavenger.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Tailored light absorption profiles of the ICA structure
The efficiency of the nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 based photoanode is limited by its poor conductivity as efficient charge transport and adequate light absorption are hardly achieved at the same time.8,9,13 Our strategy is to use an engineered ICA structure as the substrate to move the intensive light absorption region of the Mo:BiVO4 film from the top part to the bottom region closer to the charge collector. This unique structure not only enhances the light absorption capability of Mo:BiVO4 by the multiple light reflection, but also increases the charge separation by locating the strong light absorption region in proximity to the charge collector (Fig. 1a and b).
 Fig. 1  Schematic showing the intensive optical absorption region of nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 on (a) a planar substrate and (b) the ICA substrate, which has been moved much closer to the substrate in (b) than in (a) for significantly more facile charge separation. (c) Simulated absorption distribution of 900 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 on the planar substrate. A major part of light is absorbed at the top of the film (light blue region), which is far away from the charge collector. (d) Simulated absorption distribution of Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate with a 250 nm capping layer. The near bottom red area implies where light is intensively absorbed, indicating a large amount of charge carriers generated in the same region. The red area is close to the charge collector, which enables trap-free charge transport to obtain higher charge separation efficiency than that of Mo:BiVO4 on the planar substrate.9 
To investigate how light travels into the ICA and planar structures, we simulated the cross-sectional integrated absorption distribution of light within the wavelength from 370 to 520 nm (Fig. 1c and d).8,23,24,28 In the case of Mo:BiVO4 on the planar structure, the light absorption intensity decreases from top to bottom, indicating that most of the light is absorbed at the top part of the Mo:BiVO4 film, which obeys Lambert–Beer's law of light transport in the thin film structure (Fig. 1c).9 However, the light absorption distribution in the ICA structure is notably different from that in the planar structure. The diameter of the ICA matches well with the light absorption wavelength of Mo:BiVO4, and the incident light is reflected and resonated, resulting in the electro-magnetic wave redistribution and significant enhancement within the ICA structure. A red zone at the bottom part of each inverse cone represents much stronger absorption than the blue region at the top for the planar substrate (Fig. 1d), indicating remarkable light harvesting in the ICA structure. As the highly intensive absorption region moves from the top to the bottom part, most of the photo-generated carriers will be produced in the region close to the charge collector, which is essential to achieve efficient charge separation and high internal quantum efficiency.9
3.2 Imprinting technique based fabrication of the ICA substrate

Fig. 2a–d show the fabrication process of the conductive substrate with the ICA structure (see Experimental procedures). At the start, a uniform mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer was deposited on the flat glass via spin coating.29 Subsequently, a pre-prepared PDMS mold (Fig. S1†) with a nanocone array structure was mildly impressed on the wet m-TiO2 film.21,22,28 Due to the residual solvent, TiO2 NPs inside the wet film could be easily pushed out by the nanostructure of the PDMS mold and form the ICA structure, which is the negative copy of the nanocone array structure (Fig. 2a).30 Afterwards, the m-TiO2 coated glass and PDMS mold were fixed together and carefully baked at 110 °C to remove the residual solvent and make the ICA structure rigid. During the heating process, a certain weight was added on top of the PDMS mold to maintain the ICA structure against the possible movement of TiO2 NPs when evaporating the solvent. The pressure between the PDMS mold and the glass substrate was optimized to ∼2.7 × 104 Pa (Fig. 2b). After the solvent was thoroughly removed, films were cooled down to room temperature and the PDMS molds were gently peeled off. As the adhesion between solid m-TiO2 and the PDMS mold is very weak, no observable TiO2 or organic residue could be found on the surface of the PDMS mold. The mold could be used several hundred times without any noticeable structural collapse due to the mechanical robustness of the template and the soft nature of the contact printing process. Thereafter, a sintering process at 550 °C was conducted to connect TiO2 NPs together and exclude the organic ligand inside ICA-TiO2, which made the ICA structure more rigid.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of the fabrication process of the ICA substrate and SEM images of the ICA substrate with/without nanoporous Mo:BiVO4: (a) firstly, the PDMS mold with the nanocone array structure was impressed on the wet mesoporous TiO2 film to create the ICA structure. (b) Secondly, the TiO2 film and PDMS mold were baked at 110 °C with a certain weight to maintain the ICA structure during the solvent evaporation process. After cooling down, the PDMS mold was peeled off from the TiO2 film (ICA-TiO2). Subsequently, a 550 °C sintering process was conducted to remove the ligand inside the ICA-TiO2 film. (c) Thereafter, a 50 nm Pt layer was sputtered and a 50 nm SnO2 layer was sprayed onto the ICA-TiO2 film to construct a conductive layer. (d) Finally, nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 was deposited on the conductive ICA-TiO2 film via a sol–gel process. SEM image of the top-view ICA-TiO2 film (e) without/(g) with Mo:BiVO4, the side-view of the ICA-TiO2 film (f) without/(h) with Mo:BiVO4. The ICA structure is highly ordered and its thickness is around 1 μm. Mo:BiVO4 shows a porous structure and fills the ICA well. All scale bars are 1 μm. 
The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the ICA-TiO2 shows that the diameter of each inverse cone is around 1 μm and they are closely packed together to form an ordered array structure (Fig. 2e & S2†). The thickness of the ICA-TiO2 is around 1 μm (Fig. 2f). To make the ICA substrate conductive, a 50 nm Pt layer and a 50 nm SnO2 layer were subsequently deposited using a magnetic sputtering technique and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method, respectively (Fig. 2c). The next step is the deposition of Mo:BiVO4 by a sol–gel process, which has been described in detail in our previous work (Fig. 2d).8 The obtained Mo:BiVO4 is uniform and exhibits a nanoporous structure (Fig. 2g). The corresponding XRD patterns fit well to the standard data (Fig. S3†). In addition, Mo:BiVO4 fills the ICA structure well, as the precursor could easily wet the surface of SnO2 and go into the inverse nanocones (Fig. 2h). The coating of the FeOOH/NiOOH [Fe(Ni)OOH] co-catalyst is based on a modified procedure reported previously.13
3.3 Promoted performance of ICA based PEC devices
Achieving adequate light absorption and efficient charge separation at the same time is essential for high performance PEC water splitting cells. Fig. 3a presents the typical photocurrent–potential (J–V) curves [V is with respect to the RHE; E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.1976 + 0.059 pH] of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the planar and ICA substrates, measured in a 0.5 M KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. When sweeping the potential from 0.2 to 1.4 V vs. the RHE under AM 1.5 illumination, Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate exhibits a photocurrent of 6.01 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE, which is much higher than that on the planar substrate (3.39 mA cm−2). The photocurrent is among the highest achieved for BiVO4 based photoanodes toward the direct water oxidation reaction.8,13,31 The ABPE curves of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the different substrates were calculated, as depicted in Fig. 3b. Although the highest ABPE is only 1.28% for Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the planar substrate, the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the ICA substrate can achieve an ABPE as high as 2.30% accomplished at 0.65 V vs. the RHE, which is also among the highest ABPE reported to date.12,17
 Fig. 3  PEC performance and optical profiles: (a) J–V curves of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the planar and ICA substrates measured in a 0.5 M KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7) and at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The corresponding dark currents are also shown. (b) ABPE curves of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the planar and ICA substrates. (c) Measured UV-vis spectra of Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate (blue solid line) and the planar substrate (red solid line), and their corresponding simulated air mass (AM) 1.5G spectrum-integrated absorption (dotted lines) with light wavelengths from 400 to 600 nm. (d) IPCE spectra of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the ICA and planar substrates tested at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. 
To compare the difference of Mo:BiVO4 on each substrate, we first measured their optical properties after nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 deposition. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra show that the light absorption of Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate is relatively higher than that on the planar structure (Fig. 3c, solid lines), indicating a strong light trapping effect in the ICA structure. The bandgap of the Mo:BiVO4 is estimated to be ∼2.4 eV from the absorption spectrum, which is consistent with the previous reports (Fig. S4†).8,14 The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results are also in agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 3c, dotted lines).
Apart from the high light harvesting efficiency, another important factor for high-performance PEC cells is the charge separation efficiency. It's found that the light absorption of Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the planar substrate is 10% smaller than that on the ICA substrate (Fig. 3c). However, the achieved photocurrent is much lower, which strongly suggests that large amounts of photo-generated carriers recombine during the transport process before reaching the charge collector. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements of Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the different substrates were used to understand this phenomenon (Fig. 3d). The Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the ICA structure shows the IPCE value reaching ∼91% within the wavelength region from 365 nm to 480 nm, while that on the planar structure is only around 52%. The IPCE results indicate that the recombination is much stronger for Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the planar substrate than that on the ICA structure. Furthermore, we calculated the charge separation efficiency of two photoanodes using the hole scavenger, which is 94% for ICA-Mo:BiVO4 and 63% for planar Mo:BiVO4 (Fig. S5†).13 This indicates that the enhanced charge separation from the ICA structure plays a critical role. To investigate the origin of charge separation enhancement, we conducted an intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) test to evaluate the mean electron transport time in Mo:BiVO4 based photoanodes (Fig. S6†). In the ICA-Mo:BiVO4, the electron transport coefficient (Dn) is independent of the light intensity and much larger than that of planar-Mo:BiVO4. However, the Dn of planar-Mo:BiVO4 is dependent on light intensity. Because the trap density in BiVO4 has a negative correlation with the light intensity, the above results mean that electron transport in ICA-Mo:BiVO4 is free of trapping/de-trapping processes and much faster than that in planar-Mo:BiVO4. The fast electron transport is believed to benefit the charge transport efficiency in ICA-Mo:BiVO4.9 In other words, charge transport remains efficient for Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH on the ICA structure, in good agreement with the light absorption redistribution in the ICA structure.
3.4 Self-powered PEC-PV devices by integration
To achieve a self-powered water splitting system, we constructed a PEC-PV tandem device. In the PV part, we utilized metal halide perovskite solar cells, since the bandgaps of APbI3−xBrx (A = MA, FA, Cs) are tunable within 1.4–1.8 eV, and because of its low price and superior performances.27,32–36 As representatives, the NiO-based inverted structure MAPbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2Br PSCs were used to assemble the tandem devices.26,37,38 For the device measurements, standard AM 1.5 irradiation was split into two light beams (Fig. 4a). The Voc output of the MAPbI3-based PSC with a cut-off filter (<515 nm) is still as high as 1.065 V (Fig. S7†), which is about 80 mV smaller than that of the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2Br-based PSC (Fig. S8†). This causes the separately measured J–V characteristics of PSCs and PEC cells (two-electrode test) to have intersection points at 5.45 mA and 5.70 mA, respectively (Fig. 4b). The latter corresponds to the theoretical STH efficiency of 7.01%, which is higher than the former which corresponds to 6.70% theoretical STH efficiency, indicating that a higher Voc of the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2Br-based PSC in tandem with the Mo:BiVO4 ICA-based PEC cell can obtain a higher STH efficiency. Fig. 4c presents the IPCE spectra of the PEC-PV tandem device with different illumination wavelengths, which shows good agreement with J–V measurements. When evaluating from IPCE, the band-gap of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2Br is around 1.69 eV, in accordance with the previous report.32 The stability test of the sealed PEC-PV tandem device was evaluated. It showed negligible decay within 6 h irradiation, indicating decent durability (Fig. 4d).25,37,39,40 H2 and O2 production were detected by gas chromatography (GC) (Fig. S9†).41 The amount of generated H2 and O2 is ∼95.6 μmol cm−2 h−1 and ∼50.8 μmol cm−2 h−1, corresponding to ∼90% photocurrent-to-H2 coulombic efficiency for the device. Considering this coulombic efficiency, the calculated STH efficiency is 6.3%. The slight deviation is likely due to our imperfect manual sampling method of H2 for GC analysis.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have devised a scalable method to prepare ICA supported nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 for constructing PEC water splitting devices. Such a unique design can move the strong light absorption region much closer to the charge collection region so that charge separation can be much more efficient. Owing to the combined improvement in light trapping and charge collection with the ICA substrate, the nanoporous ICA supported Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH photoanode can deliver ∼6.01 ± 0.15 mA cm−2 under 1 sun illumination at 1.23 V vs. the RHE with the ABPE of 2.30% at 0.65 V vs. the RHE. By virtue of judicious assembly of the PEC cell with a deliberately bandgap-tuned PSC, we obtained a tandem device with around 6.3% STH efficiency. Our study presents a successful case for achieving a higher efficiency PEC-PV tandem device by rational light management and bandgap engineering, which will provide a new avenue for more efficient and lower-cost water splitting devices.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic showing the intensive optical absorption region of nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 on (a) a planar substrate and (b) the ICA substrate, which has been moved much closer to the substrate in (b) than in (a) for significantly more facile charge separation. (c) Simulated absorption distribution of 900 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 on the planar substrate. A major part of light is absorbed at the top of the film (light blue region), which is far away from the charge collector. (d) Simulated absorption distribution of Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate with a 250 nm capping layer. The near bottom red area implies where light is intensively absorbed, indicating a large amount of charge carriers generated in the same region. The red area is close to the charge collector, which enables trap-free charge transport to obtain higher charge separation efficiency than that of Mo:BiVO4 on the planar substrate.9	 

 	Fig. 2  Illustration of the fabrication process of the ICA substrate and SEM images of the ICA substrate with/without nanoporous Mo:BiVO4: (a) firstly, the PDMS mold with the nanocone array structure was impressed on the wet mesoporous TiO2 film to create the ICA structure. (b) Secondly, the TiO2 film and PDMS mold were baked at 110 °C with a certain weight to maintain the ICA structure during the solvent evaporation process. After cooling down, the PDMS mold was peeled off from the TiO2 film (ICA-TiO2). Subsequently, a 550 °C sintering process was conducted to remove the ligand inside the ICA-TiO2 film. (c) Thereafter, a 50 nm Pt layer was sputtered and a 50 nm SnO2 layer was sprayed onto the ICA-TiO2 film to construct a conductive layer. (d) Finally, nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 was deposited on the conductive ICA-TiO2 film via a sol–gel process. SEM image of the top-view ICA-TiO2 film (e) without/(g) with Mo:BiVO4, the side-view of the ICA-TiO2 film (f) without/(h) with Mo:BiVO4. The ICA structure is highly ordered and its thickness is around 1 μm. Mo:BiVO4 shows a porous structure and fills the ICA well. All scale bars are 1 μm.

The corresponding dark currents are also shown. (b) ABPE curves of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the planar and ICA substrates. (c) Measured UV-vis spectra of Mo:BiVO4 on the ICA substrate (blue solid line) and the planar substrate (red solid line), and their corresponding simulated air mass (AM) 1.5G spectrum-integrated absorption (dotted lines) with light wavelengths from 400 to 600 nm. (d) IPCE spectra of the Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH film on the ICA and planar substrates tested at 1.23 V vs. the RHE.
