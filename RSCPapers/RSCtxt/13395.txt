    , Accepted 15th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractTwo-dimensional tin selenide (SnSe) nanosheets were synthesized using a plasma-assisted direct current arc discharge method. The structural characterization indicates that the nanosheets are single-crystalline with an average thickness of ∼25 nm and a lateral dimension of ∼500 nm. The high pressure behaviors of the as-synthesized SnSe nanosheets were investigated by in situ high-pressure synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering up to ∼30 GPa in diamond anvil cells at room temperature. A second-order isostructural continuous phase transition (Pnma → Cmcm) was observed at ∼7 GPa, which is considerably lower than the transition pressure of bulk SnSe. The reduction of transition pressure is induced by the volumetric expansion with softening of the Poisson ratio and shear modulus. Moreover, the measured zero-pressure bulk modulus of the SnSe nanosheets coincides with bulk SnSe. This abnormal phenomenon is attributed to the unique intrinsic geometry in the nanosheets. The high-pressure bulk modulus is considerably higher than the theoretical value. The pressure-induced morphology change should be responsible for the improved bulk modulus.
Introduction
The past decades have witnessed great progress in the production of ultrathin nanomaterials.1–5 Since the first introduction of strictly two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystal graphene,6 2D nanomaterials have become a highly promising new class of materials and have sparked a diversity of applications in the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique dimension-dependent optical,7–9 electrical,10,11 magnetic12,13 and superconducting properties.14,15 As a typical 2D layered material, tin selenide (SnSe) nanocrystals have been exploited in a diverse range of fields such as solar energy conversion,16,17 holographic recording,18 near-infrared optoelectronic devices19 and rechargeable Li ion batteries.20 In addition, other advantages, such as earth-abundance, less toxicity and chemical stability, have also made the controlled synthesis and property study of SnSe a focus of interest.
Current synthetic strategies for SnSe nanostructures primarily focus on the so-called wet-chemical synthetic processes such as solvothermal, chemical bath deposition and electrodeposition. Various nanostructures, such as 0D nanocrystals,21,22 1D nanowires17,23 and 2D nanosheets,24,25 have been prepared through these methods. However, the precursor, intermediate and solvent residues adsorbed at the surface of the products are difficult to remove and substantially modify the intrinsic properties. Moreover, “solvent-free” synthesis approaches (e.g. chemical or physical vapor depositions (CVD/PVD))26–28 have also been explored for the growth of SnSe. These methods are easy to operate, less toxic, assemble fewer defects and avoid residual impurities. However, the synthesis process normally needs complex procedures, essential substrates and long reaction times, which reduce the synthetic efficiency. Thus, the controlled synthesis of pure-phase and free-standing SnSe nanostructures in a convenient way is still a great challenge. One aim of this study is to explore a rapid, low-cost and high-yield method for the synthesis of SnSe nanosheets (NSs).
In general, the properties of nanomaterials largely depend on their crystal phase, surface area, morphology and architecture. Therefore, the structural stability of sheet-shape nanomaterials is one of the crucial factors for their application. It is well known that high pressure provides a powerful method for investigating the physicochemical properties and structural phase transitions of materials. Most previous studies on SnSe mainly focused on the synthesis method and property analysis. Only a few studies on the high-pressure behavior of SnSe have been reported. In 1984, Chattopadhyay et al. reported that SnSe does not undergo any phase transition up to 34 GPa by energy dispersive X-ray diffraction study.29 In 1990, Peters et al. investigated the crystal structure of SnSe under low-pressure using Mössbauer spectroscopy. They found that the identified change of interlayer bonds drove SnSe from a predominantly 2D structure to a more 3D material below 3 GPa.30 Subsequently, Carlone et al.31 measured the optical gaps of SnSe up to 4 GPa and Agarwal et al.32 investigated the electrical resistivity and thermopower around 6 GPa. In all these early works, although some subtle changes have been observed under high pressure, the exact origin of these changes was still unclear and no phase transition has been found. More recently, Loa et al. observed that SnSe undergoes a continuous transition from the GeS-type structure to TII-type structure with a transition pressure (PT) of 10.5 GPa based on the synchrotron radiation technology.33 This phase transition sequence is closely related to the recent computational works on GeS,34 GeSe,35 SnS36 and SnSe37 itself. In 2011, Alptekin et al. proposed that SnSe undergoes a second-order phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma structure to the orthorhombic Cmcm structure at 7 GPa, using ab initio constant-pressure methods. However, it should be noted that PT is significantly lower than the experimental results and the high-pressure bulk modulus (B0) is not mentioned in the experiment. To clarify the uncertainties, reliable and detailed high-pressure experiments are necessary. In addition, previous studies on nanomaterials under high pressure have revealed a series of interesting phenomena and novel properties, which are different from their corresponding micro and bulk counterparts. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of high pressure studies on nanoscale SnSe.
Herein, a novel, efficient and simple method is reported for the synthesis of SnSe NSs in which tin (Sn) and selenium (Se) metal powders serve as the precursor, which is essential for avoiding the introduction of impurities. Furthermore, to explore the structural stabilities and vibrational properties under high pressure, the obtained SnSe NSs have been investigated by in situ synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) and Raman scattering techniques. Compared with bulk SnSe, certain unusual pressure responses have been observed. The factors that contribute to these distinct high-pressure behaviors are reported and discussed in this study. These phenomena will help to further investigate the undisclosed intrinsic physical properties of SnSe NSs. We expect that this study will not only provide valuable high-pressure experimental information of SnSe, but also offer the opportunity for a better understanding of the pressure-induced phase transition behaviors of other IV–VI layered compounds at the nanoscale.
Experimental
Synthesis of SnSe NSs
The synthesis was carried out in an improved direct current (DC) arc discharge plasma setup.38 A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. S1.† A tungsten rod (purity: 99.99%), 5 mm in diameter and 30 cm in length, was used as the cathode. Sn and Se powders (purity: 99.99%) were mixed with a molar ratio 1:1 and then pressed into an ingot. The ingot was placed in the graphite groove as the anode. The reaction chamber was first evacuated to less than 1 Pa and then filled with argon. This cycle was repeated several times to remove the residual air completely, and then working gas (Ar, purity: 99.999%) was introduced into the chamber. The Ar pressure selected was 10 kPa. When the DC arc discharge was ignited, the input current was maintained at 100 A and the voltage was a little higher than 15 V. The discharging process was maintained for 5 min. Subsequently, the products were passivated for 6 hours in pure Ar gas at 80 kPa. Finally, the fluffy dark gray samples were collected at the surface of the water-cooling wall.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) data were collected on a Rigaku D/max γA diffractometer using a Cu-Kα target (λ = 0.154178 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained via a FEI MAGELLAN-400 microscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), STEM-EDS elemental maps (mapping) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained on a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) was monitored by a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrometer.
High-pressure studies

In situ high-pressure synchrotron ADXRD measurements were performed at the 4W2 beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) with a beam wavelength of 0.6199 Å. A Mao-Bell-type diamond anvil cell (DAC) with culet diameter of 400 μm was used to preindent the T-301 stainless steel gasket to 60 μm thickness. A 100 μm diameter hole was drilled at the center of the gasket to form the sample chamber. The sample, with a tiny ruby chip, was loaded into the sample chamber with a quasi-hydrostatic pressure medium (methanol:ethanol = 4:1). The pressure was determined from the frequency shift of the ruby R1 fluorescence line.39 The Bragg diffraction rings were recorded with a MAR345 CCD detector and the average acquisition time was 500 s. The XRD diffraction patterns were integrated from the images with FIT2D software and were refined using the Rietveld method with Materials Studio software. High-pressure Raman measurements were performed at room temperature using a solid-state diode-pumped Nd:Vanadate laser (Coherent Inc.) with 532 nm wavelength as the excitation source. An Acton SpectraPro 500i spectrometer with 1800 gr mm−1 holographic grating and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, 1340 × 100) were used. The laser power focused on the sample was operated at 3 mW (after filer) to avoid heating effects.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a typical low-magnification SEM image of the as-synthesized SnSe NSs, which mostly exhibit uniform sheet-like morphology. Fig. 1b and 1c are the higher-magnification SEM images of SnSe NSs. It is apparent that the products are ultra-thin, rhombus-shaped and have smooth surfaces. The thickness of the SnSe NSs is ∼25 nm, while the lateral dimension reaches ∼500 nm. Powder XRD was performed to analyze the phase and crystallinity of the SnSe NSs. As shown in Fig. 1d, all diffraction peaks were indexed to the orthorhombic GeS-type SnSe crystal structure (JCPDS no. 32-1382, Pnma) with the lattice parameter of a = 11.579(5) Å, b = 4.185(2) Å and c = 4.427(2) Å. No additional crystalline impurity phases are observed. The corresponding unit cell volume (V0 = 214.52 Å3) is 0.5% larger than that of bulk SnSe (V0 = 213.41 Å3).

To further elucidate the nanostructure of SnSe NSs, TEM and HRTEM investigations were performed and are shown in Fig. 2. The typical morphology of a single NS is shown in Fig. 2b and its corner angle was measured as ∼86°. The single-crystalline feature was verified by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2c, two apparent planes reveal the lattice spacing at ∼0.30 nm and the intersection angle of ∼86° as well. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 2c) indicates that the NS is bounded by {011} planes and orientated with the exposed plane along the [100] plane direction. To identify the elemental distribution and Sn/Se atom ratio, mapping and EDS analysis were recorded (Fig. 2d). The results reveal that the two elements are distributed homogeneously in each NS and exhibit no apparent elemental separation or aggregation. The atomic ratio of Sn/Se is nearly 1:1 (exact value is 49.49:50.51), which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of bulk SnSe.

As mentioned above, the corner angle of the NSs exactly matches the intersection angle of the {011} planes. Thus, the growth mechanism of SnSe NSs should be related to the crystal structure itself. It is well-known that SnSe adopts a layered crystal structure with the atom arrangement resembling the distorted NaCl structure.25 Similar to other group IV–VI binary materials, such as SnS, GeS, and GeSe, strong covalent bonds are present within atomic layers, which comprises zig-zag double layer planes of the tin and selenium atoms and is separated by a weak van der Waals force between the layers along the a-axis direction. Benefiting from the anisotropic atomic bonding nature, the growth rate will be considerably faster in the b- and c-axis orientations compared to the a-axis, which will prefer the formation of a sheet-like morphology. This type of growth mechanism corresponds with the previous growth model of SnSe NSs, which were synthesized on different substrates via a non-catalytic vapor phase synthesis method.28
Fig. S2† shows the UV–vis DRS of SnSe NSs. To determine the indirect and direct optical bandgap values, Kubelka–Munk transformations were performed using the following equations:40 A = −lg(R)(1) F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R(2)where A is absorbance, R is reflectance and F(R) is Kubelka–Munk constant. In the actual experiment, the relational expression becomes [F(R)hv]1/n = A(hv − Eg). The value of n is 1/2 and 2, which correspond to the direct and indirect transition, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2a,† the onset of absorption was found to be in the near-infrared region at ∼1400 nm. A plot of [F(R)hv]2versus energy indicates a direct band gap of ∼1.18 eV (Fig. S2b†), and a plot of [F(R)hv]1/2versus energy indicates an indirect band gap of ∼0.92 eV (Fig. S2c†). These values are consistent with previous reports and meet the optimum band gap (Eg = 1.0–1.5 eV) of high-performance light absorbing materials.41 This means that the as-synthesized SnSe NSs are appropriate for potential applications in solar cells,16,21 radiation detectors42 and memory switching devices.43
High-pressure synchrotron ADXRD investigation
It is well-known that applying high pressure is an effective approach to study the structural stability and possible phase transitions of bulk/nanomaterials. The as-synthesized SnSe NSs are investigated by in situ high-pressure synchrotron ADXRD for further exploration. Representative high-pressure XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3a and the pressure dependence d-spacing of the lattice planes are shown in Fig. 3b. During the entire compression processes, all diffraction peaks shift to higher angles with increasing pressure. Although no extra peaks appear in the XRD patterns, some inconspicuous variations such as the shift rate and relative intensity of specific peaks have been observed from 6.7 to 14.3 GPa. From 6.7 GPa, the peaks of the (002) and (312) planes gradually approach their adjacent peaks of the (020) and (420) planes (marked with hollow diamonds and right arrows), respectively, and completely merge with them at 14.3 GPa with compression (marked with solid diamonds). The merged peaks move to the higher degrees up to the highest pressure that we measured. Moreover, the intensity of the peaks of the (201) and (011) planes (marked with asterisks and down arrows) weakened significantly and disappeared in this pressure range. It could be concluded from the abovementioned evidences that the initial phase translate into a higher-symmetry isomorphic structure starting at 6.7 GPa and finishing at 14.3 GPa. This transition could also be observed more directly through the changing slope of the pressure dependence d-spacing in Fig. 3b. To confirm this conclusion, the Rietveld refinement of the patterns at 1.2 and 19.6 GPa is carried out. As shown in Fig. 4, the initial and high-pressure phases exactly match the orthorhombic structure with the space group of Pnma (62) and Cmcm (63), respectively. This phase transition sequence is consistent with the previous experimental33 and theoretical37 studies on bulk SnSe.

To obtain more information about the structural stability, the axial compressibility of the SnSe NSs has been investigated from the pressure dependence of the lattice parameters. As shown in Fig. 5a, the short b- and c-axes form an intersection at ∼7 GPa, which indicate that the lattice parameters changed from a > c > b to a > b > c beyond this pressure. This change coincides with the previous studies on the temperature-induced second-order structural transformation of SnSe.29,44 The transition pressure (PT) is agreement with the ADXRD results as well. By taking a closer look at the relative lattice parameters (Fig. 5b), we observe a strong anisotropic compression. The c-axis is found to be more compressible than the other axes, although the a-direction is perpendicular to the layers, which pile up with weak van der Waals coupling. Moreover, we observed some interesting changes in the pressure dependence of both a/c, a/b and c/b in the range of 7–14 GPa (Fig. 5c). More precisely, in terms of compressibility, the initially “softest” c-axis reaches the a-axis above 7 GPa, and the b-axis becomes “stiffer”. Similar behavior was detected in the isostructural GeS and GeSe using ab initio techniques.34,35 The compression mechanism was described as follows. When the structure is subjected to pressure, the strongest compression along the c-axis causes a significant reduction of the distance between the next nearest neighbor atoms. As a result, two new chemical bonds of high-pressure phase are formed at a certain distance. This transformation mechanism also applies to the high pressure behavior of SnSe NSs. In addition, we display the P–V data of SnSe in Fig. 5d. The volume decreases monotonically without any discontinuities. The data are divided into two groups (0–6.7 GPa and 14.3–29.2 GPa) and fitted with the Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of state (EOS) as follows:45 P = 3/2B0[(V0/V)7/3 − (V0/V)5/3]{1 + 3/4(B′0− 4) × [(V0/V)2/3 − 1]}(3)where B0 is the bulk modulus and B′0 is the pressure derivative. V and V0 are the volume at pressure P and at ambient pressure, respectively. The Pnma phase gives a bulk modulus of B0 = 34.4(21) GPa with a fixed B′0 = 4. This result is in agreement with the theoretical value of 33.3 GPa (ref. 37) and experimental value of 31.1 GPa.33 The bulk modulus of the Cmcm phase is B0 = 80.1(11) GPa with B′0 at 4, which exhibits a significantly reduced compressibility compared to the theoretical value (B0 = 40.9 GPa).37

The spheres denote the experimental data and lines are guides to the eye. Pressure–volume relation of SnSe NSs (d). The results are fitted to Birch−Murnaghan equation. The dashed areas represent the phase transition pressure range. 
When the pressure drops to the ambient level, all diffraction peaks are recovered for the shape of the initial structure, indicating that the pressure-induced structural transformation is reversible. These distinctive compressibility changes of specific structural parameters are reminiscent of second-order isostructural transitions observed in related layered materials,46,47i.e., structural transitions without any syngony change and volume discontinuities. Thus, we attribute the changed compressibility in SnSe above ∼7 GPa to a second-order isostructural continuous phase transition.
Discussion
We should note that the PT of SnSe NSs (∼7 GPa) is considerably lower than that of bulk SnSe (∼10.5 GPa). However, numerous studies on nanomaterials indicate that the reduction of particle size could lead to an apparent elevation of PT.48,49 Because the large pressure gradient can result in a significant decrease of PT, the effect of the pressure-induced non-hydrostaticity in the sample chamber could be a possible reason. In this study, hydrostatic stress is achieved by immersing the sample in a pressurized fluid medium (M:E = 4:1). This type of medium is able to maintain a hydrostatic/quasi-hydrostatic state up to 15 GPa. Because the observed PT is located within the pressure range, it is thus believed that such a reduced PT is not caused by the large pressure gradient across the sample. Moreover, a critical size of 15 nm has been uncovered for a large number of nanocrystalline materials.50–52 Below 15 nm, nanomaterials display a unit cell volumetric expansion together with softening of the Poisson ratio and shear modulus, which would result in a reduction of PT.53 Interestingly, a volumetric expansion was observed at ambient pressure in SnSe NSs despite the fact that the size of the NS is larger than the critical size. Therefore, we have reason to believe that the abnormal volumetric expansion with the softening of the Poisson ratio and shear modulus may also play a crucial role in the reduction of PT for this second-order isostructural continuous phase transition in SnSe NSs. In addition, the complete phase transition pressure (PC) is considerably sluggish and the phase transition pressure range is extended greatly. The sluggishness can be explained as a high-energy hindrance that prevents the rapid transition to a high-pressure phase in nanomaterials.54,55
In general, for nanocrystalline materials, the bulk modulus elevates compared to their respective bulk material because of a higher surface energy contribution.54,56 However, it should be noted that the initial phase B0 of SnSe NSs is consistent with bulk SnSe. This distinct compressibility should be attributed to the unique intrinsic geometry of the NSs. This can be explained as follows. The thickness of SnSe NSs is on average ∼25 nm and the lateral dimension reaches an average length of ∼500 nm. The size characteristics are considerably different from conventional 1D nanowires and 0D nanoparticles, because even the lowest dimension is markedly larger than the critical particle size. Therefore, in terms of the size, the SnSe NSs should be regarded the same as the corresponding bulk SnSe and therefore they should exhibit the same nature. Moreover, the high-pressure phase B0 is considerably higher than the theoretical value. We suggested that the pressure-induced morphology changes play an important role in structural stability. For SnSe NSs, fractures occur more easily in this type of large-scale NSs under high pressure, especially during a structural transition. The zig-zag atomic arrangement in the intralayers of SnSe was seriously distorted like a retractable spring or an accordion. The sheet-like morphology was seriously damaged and the large-scaled NSs were crushed to pieces with smaller sizes. This phenomenon of pressure-induced morphological change has also been reported in CdSe57 and ZnS58 spherical nanocrystals. To confirm this assumption, TEM and HRTEM investigations of the quenched sample have been performed. As shown in Fig. S3,† the sample has been transformed into an irregular polymer composed of fragments. The lattice spacing of ∼0.30 nm indicates that these fragments still have a crystalline nature, and the average particle size was reduced to ∼10 nm. These fragments will show a higher surface energy than initial NSs and bulk materials, which will result in an enhancement of the bulk modulus.59 The same result occurs in other sheet-like nanostructures such as CdSe60,61 and Bi2Te3.62 Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the pressure-induced morphology change should be responsible for the improved bulk modulus of high-pressure phase SnSe.
High-pressure Raman investigation
To detect the pressure-induced isostructural transitions, we performed high-pressure Raman investigations up to 29.2 GPa at room-temperature. The starting SnSe material has an orthorhombic structure with Pnma (D162h) space group with the Sn and Se atoms in 4c Wyckoff positions (x, 1/4, z). The group-theoretical analysis indicates the following 12 modes are Raman active among 21 zone-center (Γ-point) phonon modes in SnSe:63 4Ag + 2B1g + 4B2g + 2B3g(4)
The selected Raman scattering patterns of SnSe NSs at various pressures are shown in Fig. 6a. Only five modes (3Ag at 75, 126, 162 cm−1, B1g at 135 cm−1 and B3g at 105 cm−1) are detected at ambient conditions, and the remaining modes are expected at low frequency ranges or have low intensities. With increasing pressure, the Ag(2) mode merges with its neighboring B3g mode and cannot be resolved above 6.8 GPa. The intensity of the B3g mode gradually decreases and this mode disappears at ∼10 GPa. The B1g mode, which is hidden in the background at ambient pressure, becomes “visible” after 6.8 GPa and increases gradually with further compression. Moreover, the Raman mode frequency evolution against pressure is shown in Fig. 6b. A dramatic discontinuous change of slope has been observed at 6.8 GPa. When the pressure was decreased to ambient pressure, the initial vibrational modes are recovered, indicating that this transition is reversible as well. Because the Raman findings are consistent with the ADXRD results in terms of PT, we have reasons to assume that a direct link exists and therefore the slope changes can be regarded as additional evidence of the pressure-induced structural transition in SnSe.

The top pattern is collected after releasing the pressure. The pressure dependence of Raman frequency shifts in SnSe (b). Vertical dotted lines indicate phase transition pressure. 
Recently, SnSe has attracted considerable attention in the thermoelectric community due to the Cmcm structure features, which can induce strong anharmonicity in bonding and can result in intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity.64 The mode Grüneisen parameter (γ) is a powerful tool to describe the changes in anharmonic bonding and can be directly measured from a single high-pressure experiment. We calculated the γ values using the following equation: (5)where ω0 and ω are the mode frequencies at ambient pressure and at high pressures, respectively; P and B0 are pressure and bulk modulus in GPa, respectively. The list of all the observed modes along with their frequencies, assignments and Grüneisen parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized high-purity, free-standing 2D SnSe NSs with uniform morphology via a plasma assisted DC arc discharge method. The high-pressure behaviors have been investigated by in situ synchrotron ADXRD and Raman scattering up to ∼30 GPa at room temperature. A second-order isostructural continuous phase transition from orthorhombic structure Pnma (62) symmetry to Cmcm (63) symmetry has been observed at ∼7 GPa, which is considerably lower than the transition pressure of bulk SnSe. The decreased transition pressure can be attributed to the volumetric expansion with the softening of the Poisson ratio and shear modulus. In addition, the bulk modulus of the Pnma phase is consistent with that of bulk SnSe, which is different from most nanomaterials. We suggest that this abnormal compressibility arises from the unique intrinsic geometry in the nanosheets. Moreover, we observed a significantly enhanced bulk modulus of the Cmcm phase compared with the theoretical results, which is considered to be caused by the pressure-induced morphology change. We believe that this study not only provides valuable experimental information about SnSe nanosheets, but might also shed some light onto the pressure-induced phase transition behaviors of other IV–VI layered structural compounds at the nanoscale.
