    , Accepted 17th December 2020First published on 18th December 2020AbstractSignificant advances in organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have been achieved in recent times. In high performance Pero-SCs, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) is an effective polymer hole transport layer (HTL), but the requisite dopants and thermal annealing may limit its application in terms of the cost and stability of the resulting devices. Therefore, doping- and annealing-free HTLs are highly demanded for the long-term development of Pero-SCs. In the present study, we designed and synthesized three block copolymers with conjugated backbones (denoted as DTS, CDT, and DTP) and applied them as HTLs in p–i–n Pero-SCs with the configuration ITO/HTL/PSBMA/MAPbI3(Cl)/C60/BCP/Ag. These three materials require neither doping nor annealing as HTLs, and we obtained high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.16%, 20.05%, and 17.60% for Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT, and DTP, respectively. More importantly, the devices are quite tolerant to moisture and heat. The unencapsulated Pero-SCs retained over 94% of their initial PCE after 1500 h in air with a relative humidity of ∼20%, and over 83% of their initial PCE after 400 h at 85 °C.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have developed rapidly, and their maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 25%, which is comparable to that of silicon-based solar cells.1–4 It is predicted that Pero-SCs may be superior to silicon solar cells in terms of their cost and manufacturing process.5–10 The only scientific problem standing in the way of their commercialization is their stability (short lifetime).11 According to the existing literature, interfacial layers play a key role in the stability of the solar cells, independently of the perovskite film.12,13 In this regard, the bottom interfacial layer is especially important. In addition to facilitating charge extraction and transportation, the bottom interfacial layer is also responsible for the quality of the perovskite layer in terms of crystallinity and defect-passivation.14
In p–i–n Pero-SCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is often used as the hole transport layer (HTL) due to its good electrical conductivity and high light transmittance. Nevertheless, the inherent acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS is detrimental to both the ITO substrate and perovskite layer.15–18 Some alternative inorganic materials have been explored, such as NiOx,19 CuOx,20 CoO,21 CuSCN22 and NiCo2O4.23 Among them, NiOx showed superior performance in improving device stability; however, the relatively low conductivity of NiOx limits the further promotion of the PCE. Therefore, many efforts have been made to increase the conductivity.24–27 In addition, producing uniform and dense inorganic films usually requires high-temperature annealing and rather complicated processing, both of which may increase the energy consumption and cost of the massive production of Pero-SCs.19–23
Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) is another representative HTL that requires low-temperature annealing (70–100 °C)28–30 and dopants to increase the hole mobility of the film. For instance, Huang's group firstly introduced 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) into PTAA to reduce its series resistance and enhance its conductivity.31 (Trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium (Li-TFSI)32 and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP)33 have also been utilized as dopants in PTAA to enhance its hole mobility. However, hygroscopic Li-TFSI and volatile t-BP both tend to result in the rapid degradation of the Pero-SCs. Therefore, dopant-free HTLs with high hole mobility and compatible surface affinity with the perovskite precursor are highly demanded for highly efficient and stable Pero-SCs.34,35
In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of block copolymers with conjugated backbones (DTS, CDT and DTP) and applied them as HTLs in p–i–n Pero-SCs. The films do not require dopants or thermal annealing to act as HTLs, and the resulting devices are quite tolerant to moisture and heat. The devices based on the three polymers all maintain over 94% of their initial PCE after being stored in air with a relative humidity (RH) of ∼20% at 25 °C for more than 1500 h. The devices based on DTS, CDT and DTP exhibited maximum PCEs of 20.16%, 20.05% and 17.60%, respectively.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis, optical absorption and energy levels of the three copolymers
P3HT was first synthesized by the KCTP/GRIM method,36,37 and then further polymerized with the monomers 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and either 2,6-dibromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, 2,6-dibromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, or 2,6-dibromo-4-n-octyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole to give the corresponding polymers DTS, CDT and DTP, respectively, via the Stiller coupling reaction. The details of the synthesis are presented in the ESI.† Their chemical structures are shown in Scheme 1. The thermal stability of the three molecules was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S5 in ESI†). All three copolymers showed no weight loss up to at least 200 °C, indicating their relatively high thermal stability.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of DTS, CDT and DTP. 
The effect of the copolymers on the transparency of the ITO substrate was investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy. The thickness of the films was controlled to be the same as those applied in the solar cells with best performance (for details, see the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 1a, the average transmittances of ITO, ITO/DTS, ITO/CDT, ITO/DTP, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PEDOT:PSS from 380 to 800 nm are 84.72%, 80.94%, 80.38%, 79.70%, 79.69% and 81.00%, respectively. Although the absorption of the copolymers covers almost the whole range of visible light, the films are so thin that they do not affect the transparency of the ITO substrate. In addition, perovskite has an extremely high absorption co-efficiency. Therefore, the absorption losses of the perovskite caused by the copolymers is not discussed in the following study.

The UV-vis spectra of DTS, CDT and DTP in chlorobenzene are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption edges of DTS, CDT and DTP are approximately 800, 800, and 898 nm, respectively, and their corresponding band gaps can be determined using eqn (1).38 Eg,opt = 1240/λonset(1)
The optical band gaps of DTS, CDT and DTP are 1.67, 1.54 and 1.45 eV, respectively. The HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO (ELUMO) energy levels of DTS, CDT and DTP were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 1c) with Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode and calculated according to eqn (2) and (3), where φOXonset is the onset oxidation potential versus Ag/Ag+.35,39 EHOMO = −e(φOXonset + 4.71 V)(2) ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt(3)
The EHOMO and ELUMO values of the three copolymers are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† The energy levels of the three copolymers, along with those of the other materials involved in this research, are plotted in the diagram shown in Fig. 1d. For HTLs, EHOMO is an important parameter, and the values for DTS, CDT, and DTP are −5.23, −5.14, and −5.01 eV, respectively. The EHOMOs of the perovskite, copolymers and ITO substrate increase sequentially, which promises good hole transport between them.
2.2 Photovoltaic properties
DTS, CDT, DTP were applied as HTLs in p–i–n Pero-SCs with the configuration ITO/HTL/MAPbI3(Cl)/C60/BCP/Ag. Note that neither annealing nor dopants were utilized in the preparation of the HTLs. Both C60 and BCP were thermally evaporated on top of the perovskite films. The thickness of the perovskite, C60 and BCP are approximately 320, 20 and 8 nm, respectively (Fig. S6†). The details of the preparation are described in the experimental section. The photovoltaic performance of the Pero-SCs was evaluated under AM 1.5G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1. During the measurements, shadow masks were adhered to the substrates to define an active area of 0.0757 cm2. The J–V curves of the Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT and DTP are shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† The maximum PCEs for the DTS-, CDT- and DTP-based devices were 17.27%, 17.02%, and 14.87%, respectively. These relatively low PCEs were attributed to the low surface coverage of the perovskite films due to the poor surface wettability of the copolymer HTLs by DMF solution. This poor wettability is reflected by the DMF contact angles on the corresponding surfaces (Fig. S8 in ESI†). Inspired by our previous study, a thin layer of the zwitterionic polymer poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) was inserted between the copolymers and the perovskite layers.40 After this modification, the films showed better affinity towards DMF, and, hence, the coverage of the perovskite films was greatly improved. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S9 in ESI†) images show a dramatic reduction in the pinholes in the perovskite film after PSBMA was inserted between the HTLs and perovskite films. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the Pero-SCs are shown in Table 1. Herein, the devices with PTAA were used as a control (PTAA HTL without thermal annealing), and obtained a PCE of 16.92%. PTAA HTL with annealing achieved a PCE of 19.25%, and unannealed PTAA modified with PSBMA achieved a PCE of 18.02%. The performance of the devices with PTAA is comparable with those reported in the literature.41 For the devices based on the conjugated backbone copolymers DTS, CDT and DTP, the maximum PCEs were 20.16%, 20.05% and 17.60%, respectively. We varied the scan speed, and the results (Fig. S10 and Table S3 in ESI†) indicate that the scanning speed has little effect on the measured performance of the devices. The PCE values of two of the conjugated backbone copolymer devices are higher than those of the Pero-SCs based on PTAA, and one is lower. Notably, the three copolymer HTLs were not doped or thermally annealed during the preparation of the films. Among the three copolymers, the use of DTP led to a relatively low PCE, mainly due to the relatively lower open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). These should be attributed to the mismatch of the EHOMOs between HTL and the valence band of the perovskite film (Fig. 1d), and may also be caused by a slight differential in hole mobility.42 The space charge limited current (SCLC) was employed to further quantify the hole mobility. Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices with an ITO/HTL/PSBMA/perovskite/MoO3/Al configuration. The hole mobility (μh) can be derived using the Mott–Gurney law J =(9/8)εε0μ(V2 L−3) and the corresponding hole mobilities of the devices are summarized in Table S4 in the ESI.† As shown in Scheme 1, the Si atom in DTS is replaced by a C (CDT) or N (DTP) atom in the other polymers. The Si–C bond length is greater than the C–C or N–C one. A longer bond implies a smaller steric space between the alkyl chain on the heteroatoms and the thiophene group, thus leading to stronger interaction between the fused rings, which is more conducive to charge transport.43,44 The hole mobilities of DTS, CDT, DTP and PTAA were also measured using an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Ag device configuration, as shown in Fig. S11a.† The μh of DTS, CDT, DTP and PTAA were 8.83 × 10−5, 8.43 × 10−5, 4.96 × 10−5 and 6.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S5†). The J–V curves were employed to determine the conductivities of the different HTL films. The curves and corresponding conductivities are shown in Fig. S11b and Table S5.† The conductivities of DTS, CDT and DTP were 1.3 × 10−5, 1.2 × 10−5 and 9.6 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The relatively high hole mobilities and conductivities of the corresponding films should be responsible for the higher performance of the corresponding devices.

 Fig. 2  Measured J–V curves for hole-only devices with different HTLs, inset: structure of hole-only device. 

Fig. 3a shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on the DTS, CDT and DTP. The EQE values were close to or higher than 80% throughout the investigated spectral range. The integrated current densities of the devices based on DTS, CDT and DTP were 21.21, 21.15 and 20.46 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jscs values obtained from the J–V curves. The forward (FS) and reverse scanning (RS) J–V curves and specific parameters of the Pero-SCs with the highest PCEs are shown in Fig. 3b and Table S6 in the ESI,† respectively. The hysteresis of Pero-SCs is usually evaluated using a hysteresis index (Ih), as shown in eqn (4), where JRS (@0.8 Voc) and JFS (@0.8 Voc) represent the photocurrent densities at 80% of Voc in the RS and FS J–V curves, respectively.45,46 The Ih values of the devices using DTS, CDT and DTP as HTLs were 0.006, 0.005 and 0.016, respectively. These results indicate that the hysteresis of all the Pero-SCs was extremely small. (4)

(c) Statistical analysis of the PCEs of the devices based on the different HTLs. 20 cells were analyzed for each HTL. (d) Steady-state performance of the Pero-SCs with different HTLs. 
The reproducibility of the devices was assessed by analysing 20 cells for each copolymer HTL, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 3c. It is clearly shown that each data group has a rather narrow distribution, indicating the good reproducibility of corresponding devices. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of the Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT and DTP were tested using the maximum power point (MMP) under continuous 1 sun illumination at constant bias voltages of 0.92, 0.94, and 0.86 V, respectively. In Fig. 3d, the steady-state PCEs of the devices based on DTS, CDT and DTP were 19.20%, 19.65% and 17.51%, respectively. These results are comparable to those obtained from the J–V curves.
2.3 Charge extraction, transportation and recombination
In order to explore the charge extraction and transportation capability of the DTS, CDT and DTP HTLs, the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films with the structure ITO/HTL/PSBMA/perovskite were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 4a–b. The PL of the perovskite coverings on the DTS, CDT and DTP films was significantly quenched, indicating fast charge transfer between the perovskite films and HTLs; thus, the three copolymers are favourable for extracting holes from the perovskite film.47,48 The time-resolved PL curves were fitted using a biexponential function, and the fitted data are summarized in Table 2. The fast decay parameters (τ1, f1) represent the quenching of the perovskite photo-generated carriers by the HTLs. The slow decay parameters (τ2, f2) represent the photoluminescence decay of the perovskite photocarriers through internal recombination.49,50 For the perovskite films on DTS and CDT, f1 is relatively larger and τ2 relatively shorter. These results indicate that the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite film is suppressed, and the charge separation and transportation between the perovskite and DTS (or CDT) are more efficient.34 This provides a good explanation for the relatively lower PCE of the Pero-SCs based on DTP.

Subsequently, the charge transportation capability of the copolymer films was investigated using alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS). The measurement was performed in the dark with the applied bias set to the Voc of the corresponding Pero-SC. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of the ACIS; the inset is the equivalent circuit employed to fit the plots. Herein, Rs represents the internal series resistance associated with the sheet resistance of the electrode. Rtr represents the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces, such as the HTL/perovskite and electrode/HTL interfaces.40,51,52 The parameters determined by fitting the curves are summarized in Table S7 in the ESI.† The Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT and DTP have similar Rss, with values of 7.9, 6.9 and 7.8 Ω, respectively. However, their Rtrs are quite different, with values are 36.6, 42.7 and 52.0 Ω for the Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT and DTP, respectively. Their relatively low Rtr values imply that the Pero-SCs based on DTS and CDT have better charge transfer and less charge recombination. These results are consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the devices.

In addition, the defect-assisted recombination between the interfaces of HTL/PSBMA/perovskites was compared by plotting the Voc and the log-dependent Plight, as shown in Fig. 6. Voc and lnPlight have a linear relationship, Voc ∝ (kBT/e)ln(Plight), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, e is the elementary charge, and Plight is the light intensity.43,53,54 The slope can be determined by linear fitting of the data, and the values for the devices based on DTS, CDT and DTP are 1.45, 1.46 and 1.98 kBT/e, respectively. The relatively larger slope of the device based on DTP indicates that its defect-assisted recombination should be worse. This result provides a sound explanation for the PCE disparity between the Pero-SCs based on the three conjugated–backbone copolymers.

2.4 Stability assessment
The stability (lifetime) of Pero-SCs has become a bottleneck blocking their practical application. High temperature and humidity are two extreme conditions under which accelerated aging would happen, and can be used for testing the stability of the cells. Fig. 7 shows the PCE evolution over time at 85 °C and an RH of approximately 20%. The thermal stability was conducted in a glove box filled with nitrogen and the temperature was kept at 85 °C. As shown in Fig. 7a, the Pero-SCs based on DTS, CDT and DTP all maintained over 83% of their initial PCE after 400 h. The Pero-SCs also showed excellent humidity stability. As shown in Fig. 7b, all the Pero-SCs retained over 94% of their original PCE after being stored in air with an RH of approximately 20% for 1500 h at 25 °C. It is worth noting that none of the Pero-SCs were encapsulated before or during the stability test.

3. Conclusion
In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of copolymers with conjugated backbones and applied them as HTLs in Pero-SCs. Unlike the HTLs frequently used in p–i–n Pero-SCs, these copolymers require neither thermal annealing nor doping, and provided PCEs competitive with those reported in the literature, which was attributed to their matched energy levels and good charge extraction and transportation abilities. Moreover, these copolymers were proven to be excellent HTLs in terms of improving the stability of Pero-SCs. Without encapsulation, the Pero-SCs maintained over 83% and 94% of their initial PCEs at (1) 85 °C in nitrogen for 400 h and (2) an RH of approximately 20% in air at 25 °C for 1500 h, respectively.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
ITO-coated glass (10 Ω sq−1) was purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to literature reports.55,56 PbI2 (99.999%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. PSBMA was synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization according to literature reports.57–59 Pristine C60 was obtained from Suzhou Dade Carbon Nanotechnology. PTAA, methylammonium chloride (MACl) and BCP were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co. DMF (anhydrous, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB; anhydrous, 99.8%) were acquired from J&K Technology.
4.2 Fabrication of devices
The ITO-coated glass was bathed sequentially under ultra-sonication in detergent, Milli Q water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol; each solvent was used twice for 20 min each time. For the deposition of the HTLs, DTS, CDT or DTP was dissolved in chlorobenzene to obtain a 0.5 mg mL−1 solution, stirred overnight and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s in a glove box. For the PTAA-based devices, a layer of PTAA (1.5 mg mL−1 in toluene) was spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in the glove box. The PSBMA layer on the HTL was obtained by spin-coating a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution of PSBMA (0.25 mg mL−1) at 4500 rpm for 20 s. The perovskite films were fabricated via a two-step deposition. 1 mol L−1 PbI2 in DMF was stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. MAI and MACl were mixed with concentrations of 50:5 mg in 1 mL IPA. The PbI2 solution was first spin-coated on HTL/PSBMA films at 4500 rpm for 20 s, and then a drop of the MAI/MACl mixture was dropped onto the centre of the spinning PbI2 film for 30 s. The as-prepared samples were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in a glove box filled with N2. Finally, C60 (20 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (80 nm) was deposited on the perovskite film by vacuum evaporation at 2 × 10−4 Pa.
4.3 Instruments
UV-vis spectra were measured using a Cary 5000 spectrometer produced by Agilent Technologies. CV measurements were taken on a Zahner Ennium IM6 Electrochemical Workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) with a glassy carbon disk, platinum wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The CV tests were conducted in a 0.1 M acetonitrile solution of Bu4NPF6. During the measurement, ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard, which was assigned an absolute energy of 4.71 eV versus the vacuum level. The J–V curves of the Pero-SCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter in a glove box filled with N2. The measurement was conducted under AM 1.5 G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1. Shadow masks were adhered to the substrate to define an active area of 0.0757 cm2. The EQE curves were calibrated using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, QE-R3011) in atmospheric conditions. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out on an FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instrument, UK). Time-resolved PL measurements were acquired on a Lifespec II (Edinburgh Instrument, UK), and the transient PL spectra were collected by monitoring the signal at 780 nm excited with a 477 nm laser (2 MHz). The Nyquist plots were obtained using an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) in the dark with the bias set to the Voc value of the respective cells. The performances of all the devices were measured immediately after their fabrication.
