    , Accepted 20th August 2014First published on 20th August 2014AbstractTwo Ru hydride complexes, Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)H (1-H) and Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H (2-H) supported by cyclic PR2NR′2 ligands (Cp* = η5-C5Me5; PR2NBn2 = 1,5-dibenzyl,-3,7-R-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane, where R = Ph or tBu) have been developed as electrocatalysts for oxidation of H2 (1.0 atm, 22 °C). The turnover frequency of 2-H is 1.2 s−1 at 22 °C (1.0 atm H2) with an overpotential at Ecat/2 of 0.5 V in the presence of exogenous base, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), while catalysis by 1-H has a turnover frequency of 0.6 s−1 and an overpotential of 0.6 V at Ecat/2. Addition of H2O facilitates oxidation of H2 by 2-H and increases its turnover frequency to 1.9 s−1, while H2O slows down the catalysis by 1-H. In addition, studies of Cp*Ru(dmpm)H (where dmpm = bis(dimethylphosphino)methane), a control complex lacking pendent amines in its diphosphine ligand, confirms the critical roles of the pendant amines of the P2N2 ligands as proton relays in the oxidation of H2.

Broader context
Substantial progress has been achieved in recent years on the development of molecular electrocatalysts for the production of hydrogen by reduction of protons, but far fewer catalysts are known for the opposite reaction, oxidation of hydrogen. The oxidation of hydrogen provides a means of converting the chemical energy of the H–H bond into electrical power in PEM fuel cells, but is typically catalyzed by platinum based catalysts. Hydrogenase enzymes in nature catalyze both the production and oxidation of hydrogen, and a key functionality in the [FeFe] hydrogenases is an amine base that functions as a proton relay. We report in this paper the synthesis and characterization of two molecular ruthenium hydride complexes that are a new class of molecular electrocatalysts for the oxidation of H2. A turnover frequency of 1.2 s−1 was observed at 22 °C and 1.0 atm H2 for catalysis by Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H. The PtBu2NBn2 ligands are cyclic diphosphine ligands that contain a pendant amine to facilitate intramolecular and intermolecular proton transfers. Addition of water further enhances the turnover frequency to 1.9 s−1. Control experiments on a closely related Ru complex that has no pendant amine show no catalytic activity, and the observed H2O accelerating effect confirms the critical roles of intramolecular proton relays (the pendant amines) and intermolecular proton relays (H2O) on the catalytic activity.

Introduction
The interconversion of H+, electrons and H2, i.e. 2H+ + 2e− ⇌ H2, is a potentially viable approach to utilize sustainable but intermittent renewable energy resources, such as solar or wind.1,2 Interestingly, in the world of bacteria, H2 also plays an important role in energy storage and metabolism.3,4 The metabolism of dihydrogen in bacteria is regulated by a class of metalloenzymes, hydrogenases, including [Ni–Fe] hydrogenase,5 [FeFe] hydrogenase6 and [mono-Fe] hydrogenase.7 The [Ni–Fe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases, which essentially function like the Pt electrode in low temperature fuel cells and electrolyzers for H2 oxidation and production, have remarkable rates and efficiencies for reversible H2 oxidation and production. These natural systems have inspired chemists to develop molecular electrocatalysts based on inexpensive metals for energy conversions.8–21 The [FeFe] hydrogenase enzymes have been shown to contain an azadithiolate ligand at its active site (see Scheme 1) that facilitates H–H bond formation and heterolytic cleavage,22 and transfers protons between the active site and solution through a proton channel.23,24 Rauchfuss et al. incorporated a redox-active derivative of ferrocene into a diiron model complex containing a pendant amine that mimics the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site for the chemical oxidation of H2.25
 Scheme 1 
Our group has studied a variety of metal complexes containing cyclic diphosphine ligands, abbreviated as PR2NR′2 (1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane, where R and R′ are alkyl or aromatic substituents). The PR2NR′2 ligands have been found to be versatile ligands26–29 for the design of nickel,30–33 cobalt34,35 and palladium36,37 electrocatalysts for H2 production, and nickel32,38–44 and iron45–48 electrocatalysts (see Scheme 1) for hydrogen oxidation. When the pendant amines in the second coordination sphere are positioned close to the metal ion, they play important roles in facilitating the cleavage or formation of the H–H bond and promoting proton transfer between the metal center and solution.
Ruthenium(II) derivatives containing a cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp = η5-C5H5) and a diphosphine ligand have been extensively studied, and the facile reactions of these types of complexes with hydrogen under mild conditions to form dihydride and/or dihydrogen derivatives have been well documented.49–54 It has been shown that the activation of H2 and intramolecular proton transfer in this class of ruthenium complexes is facilitated by a nitrogen base incorporated into monophosphine ligands.55 However, electrocatalytic activity for H2 oxidation or production for these derivatives has not been reported. We have recently reported a half-sandwich Fe complex, [CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2NBn2)H], as the first Fe-based electrocatalyst for H2 oxidation,46 and this result suggests Ru congeners may also be active for electrochemical H2 oxidation. Mayer and coworkers have shown that [Cp*Ru(PR2NR′2)(η2-O2)]PF6 undergoes protonation of one of the pendant amines of the P2N2 ligand, forming an intramolecular O⋯H–N hydrogen bond between the pendant amine and the dioxygen ligand, suggesting the pendant amines in the P2N2 ligands could also play an important role in catalytic O2 reduction.56,57 Although numerous catalysts are known for electrochemical reduction of protons to H2,8–21,26–28,58 very few molecular electrocatalysts have been developed for H2 oxidation.30,38,39,42,45–48,59 We report here the syntheses of new ruthenium complexes, Cp*Ru(PR2NBn2)H and [Cp*Ru(PR2NBn2)(H2)]BArF4 [Bn = benzyl; ArF = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] derived from Cp*Ru(PR2NBn2)Cl (1-Cl, R = Ph; 2-Cl, R = tBu). These studies have led to the development of ruthenium-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation involving intramolecular heterolytic H–H bond cleavage and further generalize the important functions of pendant amines of the P2N2 ligand for intra- and intermolecular proton transfers and H2 oxidation catalysis.
Results and discussion
Syntheses of complexes
Cp*Ru(PR2NBn2)Cl (1-Cl, R = Ph; 2-Cl, R = tBu) (Scheme 2) were synthesized by the reported procedures.56,57 The 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectra of 1-Cl and 2-Cl confirmed their identities. When H2 is bubbled through a dichloromethane-d2 solution of 1-Cl or 2-Cl in the presence of NaBArF4 (see Scheme 1), the orange color rapidly fades to pale yellow, and the resulting product is assigned as the dihydrogen complex [Cp*Ru(PR2PBn2)(H2)]BArF4, 1-H2 (R = Ph) and 2-H2 (R = tBu), on the basis of NMR spectroscopic data. The 1H NMR spectrum of each product shows a broad singlet near −9.0 ppm assigned to the H2 ligand. No evidence for a second isomer with two hydride ligands is observed in the spectrum. When D2 is bubbled through the solution of each product, evidence for H-D exchange is observed within minutes, and the HD resonance splits into a triplet with JH-D = 20.0 Hz for 1-HD, and 22.0 Hz for 2-HD, indicating 0.99 and 1.05 Å H–H bond distances in these molecules according to the equation of Heinekey.60,61 The longer H–H bond distances indicate more activated H2 molecules in these [Ru(H2)]+ complexes than those of [CpFePh2NBn2(H2)]BArF4 (ref. 45) (0.91 Å) and [CpC6F5FetBu2NBn2(H2)]BArF4 (ref. 46) (0.91 Å) calculated by the same equation.60 The H-D coupling further confirms that these ruthenium complexes contain dihydrogen ligands. The H-D exchange indicates reversible heterolytic cleavage of H2 by these ruthenium complexes, consistent with observations previously reported for [CpFe(PPh2PBn2)(H2)]BArF4).45 This H-D exchange is facilitated by the pendant amine in the ligand, which can lead to the formation of a ruthenium hydride with a protonated base in the ligand, similar to [CpC5F4NFe(PtBu2NtBu2H)H]BArF4, which was characterized by neutron diffraction studies.47 Rapid intermolecular exchange between NH+ and ND+ sites in the ligands followed by deuteron transfer back to the metal hydride results in the formation of the Ru(H-D) derivative. The [Cp*Ru(PR2PBn2)(H2)]BArF4 species are more stable than the corresponding [Cp*Ru(PR2NtBu2H)H]BArF4 tautomers, and are the only species observed experimentally. A similar situation is observed for [CpFe(PPh2PBn2)(H2)]+ and its H–H heterolytic cleavage tautomer.45 In previous studies of reactions of H2 with a series of Cp*Ru(diphosphine)Cl derivatives in the presence of NaBArF4, the formation of the dihydride derivative or a mixture of dihydrogen and dihydride isomers was observed by NMR spectroscopy at room temperature.51–54 The addition of D2 to the isomeric mixtures also led to the formation of Ru(HD) derivatives, but this occurred over a period of hours, significantly slower rate than the rates we observed for 1-H2 and 2-H2.
 Scheme 2 
The reaction of Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)Cl, 1-Cl, with excess NaBH4 in THF gave Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)H, 1-H, and a similar reaction of 2-Cl with NaBH4 in EtOH resulted in the formation of Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H, 2-H (Scheme 2). The 1H NMR spectra of these products exhibit triplets (due to the coupling of the hydride ligand to both P atoms of the P2N2 ligand, JPH = 30 Hz) at −12.3 ppm and −14.9 ppm for 1-H and 2-H, respectively, that are assigned to the hydride ligands. The addition of HBF4·Et2O to a solution of these metal hydrides in acetone-d6 resulted in the formation of the corresponding dihydrogen derivatives, 1-H2 and 2-H2, as identified by NMR spectroscopy.
Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammograms for the ruthenium complexes were recorded in 0.1 M NBu4B(C6F5)4 fluorobenzene solutions, unless otherwise noted, using a glassy carbon electrode. Acetonitrile is often used for electrochemical studies, but these Ru complexes, as well as the related Fe complexes reported earlier, bind CH3CN strongly, so the non-coordinating solvent fluorobenzene was used in these studies. One-electron oxidations of 1-Cl and 2-Cl were observed in CH2Cl2 solutions containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, and are assigned to the RuIII/II couples.57 Both complexes exhibit the same potential for the RuIII/II couple at −0.38 V versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple (all potentials in this paper are reported versus Cp2Fe+/0),57 implying no substituent effect on the RuIII/II redox couple in CH2Cl2 solutions. The cyclic voltammogram of the chloride derivative 1-Cl recorded in fluorobenzene, exhibits a reversible wave of the RuIII/II couple at −0.44 V (ΔEp = 85 mV) (see Fig. 1a), ca. 60 mV more negative than the value recorded in CH2Cl2. No reduction wave was observed at potentials as negative as −2.0 V. 2-Cl exhibits a reversible RuIII/II couple at −0.48 V, 40 mV more negative than that of 1-Cl, suggesting the PtBu2NBn2 ligand is slightly more electron donating than PPh2NBn2 (see Fig. 1b), consistent with Ni(I/0) couples for complexes with these ligands.62 Plots of the anodic peak current versus the square root of the scan rate are linear, indicating the oxidations of 1-Cl and 2-Cl are diffusion-controlled one-electron processes (See Fig. S1 and S2†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of 1-Cl (black trace) and 1-H (red trace); (b) cyclic voltammograms of 2-Cl (black trace) and 2-H (red trace). Conditions: 1.0 mM [Ru]; 0.1 M nBu4NB(C6F5)4; under 1.0 atm Ar; scan rate, 100 mV s−1; Cp2CoPF6 (−1.33 V vs. Cp2Fe+/0) was used as an internal reference and is present in all four cyclic voltammograms. 
In the cyclic voltammogram of the hydride derivative 1-H, the quasi-reversible wave corresponding to the RuIII/II couple (anodic peak at −0.62 V) is shifted to a more negative value relative to that of the chloride derivative (−0.44 V). Scan rate dependence studies in a range from 0.1 V s−1 to 25.0 V s−1 revealed that the oxidation becomes fully reversible above 16.0 V s−1 (see Fig. S3†). In the cyclic voltammogram of 2-H, which contains the more electron-donating tBu group on the phosphorus atoms, the RuIII/II oxidation was shifted to a significantly more negative potential of −0.84 V in fluorobenzene. This oxidation wave showed quasi-reversible character that was scan-rate dependent; at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 a small reduction peak was observed upon reversing the initial scan direction with ia/ic = 1.8, and at a scan rate of 25 V s−1, the ia/ic ratio was ca. 1.0 (see Fig. S4†). The irreversible character of the oxidation of 1-H and 2-H at slow scan rates is attributed to irreversible chemical reactions following the oxidation of RuIIH to RuIIIH: facile intramolecular proton transfer from the Ru center to a pendant base and subsequent intermolecular proton transfer to RuIIH, which is consistent with electrochemical behavior of half-sandwich Fe-hydrides with similar ligand environments, e.g. CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2PBn2)H.45,46
Both complexes 1-H and 2-H were examined for electrochemical H2 oxidation (1.0 atm, Fig. 2). Under an atmosphere of H2, no change was observed in the potential or the amplitude of the oxidation wave at −0.62 V, the RuIII/II couple of 1-H. This indicates that neither the starting metal hydride 1-H nor its oxidized form reacts rapidly with H2. However, when aliquots of the amine base DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, pKa = 24.34 for H-DBU+ in CH3CN)63 were added to this solution under hydrogen, an increase in oxidizing current was observed at a slightly more negative potential (half peak potential at −0.71 V) with the wave reaching a plateau after the addition of about 8.0 equiv. of base. This current increase is characteristic of an electrocatalytic oxidation of H2. The cathodic shift of the catalytic waves of 1-H compared to the original oxidation wave suggests that proton transfer following oxidation is fast in the presence of DBU. At concentrations of base greater than 6.0 mM, the catalytic current becomes independent of base concentration, and the ratio of the catalytic current (icat) to the peak current in the absence of H2, (ip) is 3.6 (see Fig. S5†) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. This ratio can be used to calculate a turnover frequency for H2 oxidation of 0.6 s−1 under 1.0 atm of H2 at room temperature using eqn (1), where n is the number of electrons (2 for H2 oxidation), R is the gas constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1), F is Faraday's constant (9.65 × 104 C mol−1), v is the scan rate, and T is the temperature (298 K).64–66 Electrochemical H2 oxidation using complex 2-H as electrocatalyst gave a rate of 1.2 s−1, ca. twice that of 1-H. The catalytic oxidation of H2 has been confirmed by identifying the deuterated base, DBU-D+ (at 10.54 ppm in the 2H NMR spectrum) in the chemical oxidation of D2 employing 2-H as the catalyst and ferrocenium as the oxidant (see eqn (2)). The yield of deuterons from the chemical oxidation of D2 catalyzed by 2-H corresponded to 9.2 turnovers, confirming catalysis. The turnover frequencies for the oxidation of H2 catalyzed by 1-H and 2-H are comparable to that of recently reported CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2PBn2)H.46 From the pKa of the conjugate acid of the exogenous base, DBU, the catalytic overpotential at Ecat/2 for 1-H and 2-H can be estimated to be 0.6 and 0.5 V, respectively. The estimation of the overpotential is based on the pKa difference of DBU and Et3N in CH3CN (see details in the Supporting Information). Other bases such as N-methylpyrrolidine and triethylamine did not lead to catalysis of H2 oxidation. (1) (2)

(a) Cyclic voltammograms of a fluorobenzene solution of 1-H (1.0 mM) under 1.0 atm H2 with increasing concentrations of DBU as indicated in the legend. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of a fluorobenzene solution of 2-H (1.0 mM) under 1.0 atm H2 with increasing concentrations of DBU as indicated in the legend. Conditions: 1.0 mM Ru hydride; 0.1 M nBu4NB(C6F5)4; 1.0 atm H2; scan rate, 20 mV s−1; 22 °C; Cp2CoPF6 (−1.33 V) as internal reference. 
Based on the data presented above, a catalytic cycle for oxidation of H2 is proposed in Scheme 3 for the catalytic oxidation of H2 by 1-H and 2-H. This mechanism is the analogous to that proposed for related half-sandwich complexes of Fe that also contain P2N2 ligands.46 In this mechanism, H2 oxidation is initiated by oxidation of the RuII hydride (step a) followed by facile intramolecular proton transfer from the RuIII–H to the pendant amine (step b); the square in Scheme 3 indicates a vacant coordination site on the metal. Deprotonation by the exogenous base, DBU (step c) gives a RuI species that undergoes a second oxidation to produce an unsaturated RuII species (step d) that binds H2 (step e). We propose an intramolecular heterolytic H2 cleavage (step f) that leads to a Ru hydride and protonated amine. This complex is shown in Scheme 3 with a “dihydrogen bonding” interaction67,68 between the protic N-Hδ+ and hydridic Ru-Hδ−. We recently isolated a related Fe–H⋯H–N complex, and its structure was determined by single crystal neutron diffraction.47 Intermolecular deprotonation of the Ru–H⋯H–N intermediate provides a lower barrier pathway compared to direct deprotonation of the Ru-(H2) complex. The existence of the Ru(H2) complex and its H2 cleavage tautomer (the intermediate formed in step f) is supported by H2/D2 scrambling observed for 1-H2 and 2-H2.45,46 Collman et al. previously reported a mononuclear RuII porphyrin complex, Ru(OEP)(THF)2 (OEP = octaethylporphinato dianion) that is an electrocatalyst for H2 oxidation when absorbed on the edge planes of graphite electrodes.69 Ogo et al. previously reported a Ni–Ru heterobimetallic complex as a H2 oxidation catalyst and demonstrated its function in a PEM fuel cell device.70 For both Ru based catalysts, which lack a built-in base, catalysis is proposed to involve intermolecular heterolysis of H2 using an exogenous base during the oxidation of H2.
 Scheme 3 
Effect of H2O on H2 oxidation by 1-H and 2-H
For Ni-based H2 oxidation electrocatalysts, H2O can significantly accelerate the rate of intermolecular proton transfer from the protonated pendant base to a base in solution.41,42 This can lead to different catalytic pathways under different conditions. In the presence of water, deprotonation of the protonated pendant amine prior to oxidation leads to a lower overpotential compared to a pathway where oxidation precedes proton transfer.42 To determine if water might influence the turnover frequencies or overpotentials for oxidation of H2 by 1-H and 2-H, water was added to form a saturated fluorobenzene solution at a base (DBU) concentration of 14.0 mM (i.e. in the base independent concentration regime). In the case of 1-H, addition of H2O led to a decrease in the catalytic current (See Fig. S6†). However, for 2-H, a modest catalytic current enhancement was observed upon addition of 40 μL water with icat/ip = 6.6, corresponding to a turnover frequency of 1.9 s−1 (see Fig. 3). This rate is ca. 1.6 times faster than without added H2O for this Ru complex.41,42 In addition to the enhanced current, there is an apparent cathodic shift in the half-wave potential (ca. 40 mV). This shift indicates that proton transfer from the RuIIIH to the base in solution is faster for this complex in the presence of water. This observation is consistent with a steric component to the activation barrier associated with the intermolecular proton transfer shown in step c of Scheme 3 that is decreased by water bridging between the protonated pendant base and the base in solution. Further addition of H2O to the solution of 2-H did not lead to any additional increase in the catalytic current or decrease in overpotential, consistent with saturation of the fluorobenzene solution.
 Fig. 3  Electrochemical H2 oxidation by 2-H before and after addition of 40 μL H2O into 1.0 mL of fluorobenzene solution. Conditions: fluorobenzene solution, 1.0 mM 2-H; 0.1 M nBu4NB(C6F5)4; 1.0 atm H2; scan rate, 20 mV s−1; 22 °C; Cp2CoPF6 (−1.33 V) as internal reference. 
One plausible explanation for the different observations of the effect of H2O for 1-H and 2-H is that the preference for binding H2 and H2O is different for the unsaturated Cp*Ru(P2N2)+ complexes formed in step d in Scheme 3. Several Ru(H2O) half-sandwich complexes supported with Cp or Cp* ligands have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction.71,72 Competitive binding of H2vs. H2O has also been studied for several dihydrogen complexes. In early studies, Kubas and co-workers found that the relative binding strength of H2vs. H2O to tungsten complexes varies according to temperature.73 A recent review discusses the influence of hydrogen bonding, solvent, and entropic factors that influence the relative strength of binding of H2vs. H2O.74 For 1-H we hypothesize that the open site of the unsaturated species preferentially coordinates H2O over H2. Because of this competitive binding of H2O, only a small amount of 1-H2 enters into the catalytic cycle, leading to the observation of decreased catalytic current. In the case of 2-H, it is believed the relative binding ability of H2O and H2 is reversed due to subtle differences in the Lewis acidity of the unsaturated species or the polarity of the binding pocket, arising from the different phosphorus substituents, phenyl versus t-butyl. In this case, the rate of H2 binding (step e of Scheme 3) and the rate of intermolecular proton transfer (step c) are faster, leading to a small increase in rate and a small decrease in the overpotential.
Complex A of Scheme 4b corresponds to the heterolytic cleavage product of H2 (step g in Scheme 3) and complex B of Scheme 4b corresponds to the RuI species resulting from intramolecular proton transfer in step b of Scheme 3. In Scheme 4b, H2O can assist proton transfer by forming hydrogen bonds with the two catalytic intermediates, A and B, and the exogenous base (denoted as :B) can remove a proton from the bridging water molecule that may function as a secondary proton relay.42 The formation of the intermediate B is consistent with the potential shift of the catalytic current (see Fig. 3). Compared to the direct proton transfer from the catalyst to an exogenous base (complexes C and D in Scheme 4b), proton transfer through a bridging H2O molecule is believed to have a lower barrier, with reduced steric hindrance and greater accessibility of the exogenous base. In contrast, for CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2PBn2)H,46 which has a similar ligand environment as 1-H and 2-H, addition of H2O completely inhibits the oxidation of H2. It should be noted water tolerance is a prerequisite for H2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cell applications as there is a large humidity at both electrode sides of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell devices. Further understanding of the H2O compatibility of 2-H could lead to the development of H2O tolerant Fe catalysts.
 Scheme 4 
Comparative studies of Cp*Ru(dmpm)H
The ability of Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H to serve as an electrocatalyst for oxidation of H2 is attributed to the ability of the pendant amine to function as an effective proton relay for intramolecular proton transfers, including heterolytic cleavage of H2, and for proton transfers to the exogenous base in solution. A related ruthenium complex that does not incorporate a proton relay was also studied for possible electrocatalytic activity. Cp*Ru(dmpm)Cl (where dmpm = bis(dimethylphosphino)methane) is expected to have an electronic influence at the metal center similar to P2N2 ligands. Cp*Ru(dmpm)Cl was synthesized according to a published procedure,75,76 and converted to Cp*Ru(dmpm)H by a reaction with excess NaBH4 in ethanol.
Cp*Ru(dmpm)Cl exhibits a reversible RuIII/II wave at −0.52 V, which is 40 mV more negative than that of 2-Cl (see Fig. S7†). Scan rate dependence studies indicate the oxidation is a diffusion-controlled one-electron process (see Fig. S8†). Cp*Ru(dmpm)H shows an irreversible oxidation peak at −0.61 V at 100 mV s−1 (see Fig. S9†). Under H2 (1.0 atm) and in the presence of DBU, there is a current enhancement by a factor of about 2 consistent with the H− ligand being oxidized to a proton, but there is no plateau in current (see Fig. S10†) that would indicate catalytic H2 oxidation. This control experiment indicates that the pendant amine is required for the catalytic H2 oxidation observed for 1-H and 2-H.
Remarks on the Ru catalysts and previously reported Fe catalysts
The design of Ru-hydride catalysts, 1-H and 2-H, was inspired by previously reported Fe catalysts, [CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2NBn2)H] (ref. 46) and [CpC5F4NFe(PtBu2NtBu2H)H]BArF4.47 Both Ru and Fe catalysts have a similar piano-stool geometry. There are subtle differences in the ligand environment for these two systems. Complex 1-H, Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)H, is more similar to CpFe(PPh2NBn2)H (ref. 45) as they share the same P2N2 ligand. The Fe complex is not catalytic for the oxidation of H2 due to base (DBU) binding to the open site of the corresponding unsaturated species, [CpFe(PPh2NBn2)]+.45 It is believed that the observed catalysis by 1-H benefits from the steric protection provided by the bulky Cp* ligand that impedes DBU binding. 2-H, Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)H, is more closely related to [CpC6F5Fe(PtBu2NBn2)H] (ref. 46) with the major difference being the substituents on the Cp ring. In terms of electrochemical oxidation of H2, 1-H and 2-H exhibited similar rates to the Fe catalysts but higher overpotentials. The larger overpotentials for 1-H and 2-H are due to the use of the stronger exogenous base (DBU) compared to weaker bases (e.g. N-methylpyrrolidine and Et3N) used for the Fe catalysts. As mentioned above, complexes 1-H and 2-H did not show catalysis using N-methylpyrrolidine and Et3N. While Ru metal is more electronegative than Fe, Cp* is much more electron-donating than CpC6F5 and CpC5F4N, and the Cp*Ru(H2) complexes are more basic than the Fe(H2) complexes supported by CpC6F5 or CpC5F4N ligands. As a result, intermolecular deprotonation of 1-H and 2-H (step g in Scheme 3) cannot be accomplished using weak bases.
Summary/conclusions
A new class of Ru electrocatalysts containing P2N2 ligands with pendant amines have been developed for electrochemical H2 oxidation, demonstrating the general utility of pendant bases in the design of molecular electrocatalysts for H2 oxidation and production for a range of metals. Our studies of a control complex lacking the pendant amines indicates the pendant amines are crucial to function as proton relays in the catalytic oxidation of H2. In addition, structural changes of the ligand can influence catalytic activity by influencing the binding affinity of H2 and H2O, and suggest similar control may be feasible for related Fe–H catalysts through systematic ligand modification.
Experimental section
General experimental procedures

1H, 2H and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H) at 20 °C. All 1H chemical shifts have been internally calibrated to the monoprotio impurity of the deuterated solvent. The 31P{1H} NMR spectra were proton decoupled and are referenced to external phosphoric acid.
All electrochemical experiments were carried out under an atmosphere of argon or hydrogen as indicated, in 0.1 M nBu4NB(C6F5)4 fluorobenzene electrolyte solutions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a CH Instruments model 660C potentiostat. Cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate (Cp2CoPF6) was used as a secondary internal standard with all potentials referenced to the Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe0 couple at 0 V. The working electrode (1 mm PEEK-encased glassy carbon, Cypress Systems EE040) was polished using Al2O3 (BAS CF-1050, dried at 150 °C under vacuum) suspended in fluorobenzene, and then rinsed with neat fluorobenzene. A glassy carbon rod (Structure Probe, Inc.) was used as the counter electrode. The reference electrode consisted of a silver wire coated with a layer of AgCl and suspended in a solution of 0.1 M nBu4NB(C6F5)4 in fluorobenzene. The solution of the reference electrode was separated from the analyte solution by a Vycor frit.
Synthesis and materials
All reactions and manipulations were performed under an Ar or H2 atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques or a glovebox. Solvents were dried using an activated alumina column and stored under Ar. N-methylpyrrolidine, Et3N, and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) were distilled from KOH and stored under Ar. All NMR solvents were purified according to standard methods. 1,3-di(t-butyl)-5,7-dibenzyl-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane (PtBu2NBn2),62 1,3-diphenyl-5,7-dibenzyl-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane (PPh2NBn2),30 Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)Cl (1-Cl),57 Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)Cl (2-Cl)57 and Cp*Ru(dmpm)Cl (ref. 75 and 76) were prepared using published procedures. All other reagents were used as received.
[Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)(H2)]BArF4 (1-H2)
Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)Cl (0.022 g, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in a CD2Cl2 solution that had been purged with H2. A solution of NaBArF4 (0.027 g, 0.03 mmol) in CD2Cl2 was purged with H2 and added to the ruthenium complex. The color of the solution changed from orange to pale yellow. The dihydrogen adduct was identified by NMR spectroscopy. Attempts to evaporate solvent to isolate the complex lead to decomposition, presumably due to loss of H2. 1H NMR, (CD2Cl2, ppm): −8.59 (br s, 2H, Ru–H2); 1.42 (s, 15H, Cp*); 3.29, 3.24, 2.94, 2.60 (m, 8H, CH2); 3.98, 3.66 (s, 2H each, CH2Ph); 7.0–7.8 (m, Ar–H, 20H). 31P{1H} NMR (CD2Cl2, ppm): 34.62 (s).
[Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)(H2)]BArF4 (2-H2)
Complex 2-H2 was generated analogous to 1-H2. 1H NMR, (CD2Cl2, ppm): −9.89 (br s, 2H, Ru–H2); 1.04 (3-line pattern, 18H, t-Bu); 1.92 (s, 15H, Cp*); 2.45 (m, 6H, CH2); 2.80 (br, m, 2H, CH2); 3.67, 3.64 (s, 2H each, CH2Ph); 7.2–7.8 (m, Ar–H, 22H). 31P{1H} NMR (CD2Cl2, ppm): 45.32 (s).

1-H2 and 2-H2 can also be prepared by addition of one equivalent of HBF4·Et2O to the corresponding Ru–H species in acetone.
[Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)(HD)]BArF4 (2-HD)
[Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)(H2)]BArF4 in CD2Cl2 was purged with D2 for ca. 5 minutes. In the 1H NMR spectrum, both the original Ru(H2) resonance and a new triplet near −9.9 ppm with JHD = 22.0 Hz were observed and is assigned to the Ru(HD) resonance.
Cp*Ru(PPh2NBn2)H (1-H)
Under a N2 atmosphere, Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)Cl (0.212 g, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in ca. 10 mL THF and the resulting solution was added to a suspension of NaBH4 (0.114 g, 3.0 mmol, in 10 mL ethanol). The color immediately changed from orange to yellow. The solution was stirred for 3 h, then the pale yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and dried. Recrystallization of the product from Et2O yields an analytically pure product. 1H NMR, (C6D6, ppm): −12.3 (t, JPH = 30 Hz, 1H, Ru–H); 1.77 (s, 15H, Cp*); 3.18, 2.95, 2.90, 2.50 (m, 2H each, CH2); 3.87, 3.21 (s, 2H each, CH2Ph); 7.0–7.5 (m, Ph, 20H). 31P{H} NMR (C6D6, ppm); 44.09 (s). Anal. calcd for C40H48N2P2Ru: calc. C, 66.74; H, 6.72; N, 3.89. Found: C, 66.32; H, 6.31; N, 3.54.
Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H, (2-H)
Under a N2 atmosphere, Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)Cl (0.212 g, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in ca. 20 mL EtOH, and NaBH4 (0.114 g, 3.0 mmol) was added. The color of the solution immediately changed from orange to yellow. The solution was stirred for 3 h, then the pale yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and dried. This product was redissolved in Et2O, the solution filtered, and after solvent removal under vacuum, the resulting solid was dried again. Yield: 0.10 g, 50%. 1H NMR, (C6D6, ppm): −14.94 (t, J = 31 Hz, 1H, Ru–H); 1.01 (t, 18H, t-Bu); 2.09 (s, 15H, Cp*); 1.89, 2.21, 2.32, 3.1 (m, 2H each, CH2); 3.39, 3.75 (s, 2H each, CH2Ph); 7.0–7.5 (m, Ph, 10H). 31P{H} NMR (C6D6, ppm); 52.44 (s). Anal. calcd for C36H56N2P2Ru: calc. C, 63.60; H, 8.30; N, 4.12. Found: C, 63.23; H, 8.48; N, 4.17.
Cp*Ru(dmpm)H
Cp*Ru(dmpm)Cl (0.077 g, 0.19 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH and NaBH4 (0.086 g, 2.3 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred for 20 h, and then evaporated to dryness. The yellow solid was extracted with Et2O, the resulting yellow solution was filtered, and after solvent removal from the filtrate the resulting solid was dried under vacuum. The extraction/filtration process was repeated to give the product as a yellow brown solid. Yield: 0.056 g, ca. 80%. 1H NMR (ppm, d8-tol): −11.28 (t, 1H, Ru–H, JPH = 34 Hz); 3.01 (m, 1H, CH2); 2.63 (m, 1H, CH2); 2.11 (t, 15H, Cp*, JPH = 2 Hz); 1.31 (t, JPH = 5 Hz, 6H, Me); 1.26 (t, JPH = 4 Hz, 6H, Me). 31P{1H} NMR (d8-toluene): −14.56 (s). Anal. calcd for C15H30RuP2: calc. C, 48.25; H, 8.30. Found: C, 48.17; H, 8.03.
Electrochemical H2 oxidation catalyzed by 1-H and 2-H
A 1.0 mL fluorobenzene solution containing 1.0 mM catalyst (1-H or 2-H) was maintained under 1.0 atm hydrogen. Aliquots of base (DBU) were added, and the cyclic voltammograms were recorded after each addition. The peak current observed for the oxidation of 1-H or 2-H in the absence of base is defined as ip for 1-H or 2-H, and the peak or plateau current observed in the presence of various amounts of base is icat. The ratio of icat/ip was used to determine the rate for the oxidation of H2. The effect of H2O on the oxidation of H2 was examined by adding H2O to the solution of 1-H or 2-H after reaching the base-concentration independent regime.
Chemical oxidation of D2 catalyzed by 2-H
Chemical oxidation of D2 was conducted to establish the catalytic nature of electrochemical H2 oxidation. This evaluation using D2 instead of H2 avoids interference of any adventitious protons that could possibly occur during H2 chemical oxidation. A standard solution of C6D6 (10 mM) was prepared in PhF. A solution of 2-H (5.0 mM) was prepared using the standard solution. For each individual experiment, 5% loading of 2-H (1.0 mL, 3.34 mg, 0.005 mmol) was added to a NMR tube with the preloaded oxidant, [Cp2Fe]PF6 (27 mg, 0.1 mmol) under D2 (1.0 atm). Then 0.1 mmol DBU (16 μL) was injected into the NMR tube. The NMR tube was shaken for ca. 5 min, resulting in an orange solution and the disappearance of the blue color associated with [Cp2Fe]PF6. Subsequently, a 2H NMR spectrum was recorded to verify the formation of deuterated base, [DBU-D]PF6, with a 2H NMR resonance at 10.54 ppm. The average yield of the product [DBU-D]PF6 from two runs was ca. 92% determined by using the C6D6 internal standard for integration, corresponding to 9.2 turnovers.

Broader context
Substantial progress has been achieved in recent years on the development of molecular electrocatalysts for the production of hydrogen by reduction of protons, but far fewer catalysts are known for the opposite reaction, oxidation of hydrogen. The oxidation of hydrogen provides a means of converting the chemical energy of the H–H bond into electrical power in PEM fuel cells, but is typically catalyzed by platinum based catalysts. Hydrogenase enzymes in nature catalyze both the production and oxidation of hydrogen, and a key functionality in the [FeFe] hydrogenases is an amine base that functions as a proton relay. We report in this paper the synthesis and characterization of two molecular ruthenium hydride complexes that are a new class of molecular electrocatalysts for the oxidation of H2. A turnover frequency of 1.2 s−1 was observed at 22 °C and 1.0 atm H2 for catalysis by Cp*Ru(PtBu2NBn2)H. The PtBu2NBn2 ligands are cyclic diphosphine ligands that contain a pendant amine to facilitate intramolecular and intermolecular proton transfers. Addition of water further enhances the turnover frequency to 1.9 s−1. Control experiments on a closely related Ru complex that has no pendant amine show no catalytic activity, and the observed H2O accelerating effect confirms the critical roles of intramolecular proton relays (the pendant amines) and intermolecular proton relays (H2O) on the catalytic activity.
