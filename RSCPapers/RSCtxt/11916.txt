Platinum-loaded conducting glass has been widely exploited as the standard counter electrode (CE) for DSSCs. However, the high cost and the rarity of platinum limits its practical application in DSSCs. This has promoted large interest in exploring Pt-free CEs for DSSCs. Very recently, graphene, which is an atomic planar sheet of hexagonally arrayed sp2 carbon atoms, has been demonstrated to be a promising CE material for DSSCs due to its excellent conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity. This article provides a mini review of graphene-based CEs for DSSCs. Firstly, the fabrication and performance of graphene film CE in DSSCs are discussed. Secondly, DSSC counter electrodes made from graphene-based composite materials are evaluated. Finally, a brief outlook is provided on the future development of graphene-based materials as prospective counter electrodes for DSSCs.Hui WangHui Wang is a PhD candidate student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Michigan Tech University studying under the supervision of Prof. Yun Hang Hu.

Broader context
Solar energy is the largest single source of clean energy. However, energy prices based on the present solar technologies are incomparable to those of fossil fuels. Highly efficient solar cells are necessary and urgent. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently leading third generation photovoltaic devices, which represent the cutting edge of solar technologies with a high efficiency and low production cost. One of the great challenges for DSSCs is the development of Pt-free counter electrodes (CEs). As a rising star, graphene has been demonstrated to be a promising counter electrode material for DSSCs due to its excellent conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity, as well as its good mechanical flexibility. In this article, we evaluated the performance of graphene-based counter electrodes in DSSCs, analyzed the conductivity and structure of graphene with regards to its performance in DSSCs and formulated strategies for the further improvement of graphene counter electrodes.

1. Introduction
Increasing energy prices and growing attention on global warming have motivating the creation of economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels. The sun deposits 120000 TW of radiation on the earth, which is the largest single source of clean energy. Currently, however, only about 5 GW of power is generated by solar cells.1 This has occurred because energy prices, based on present solar technologies, are incomparable to those of fossil fuels. As the first generation solar cells, silicon-based photovoltaic cells dominate the solar market due to their high efficiency. However, their indirect optical band gap requires a thick active layer for solar conversion, which results in the expensive fabrication of large area materials. The aim of second generation of photovoltaic (PV) materials was to reduce the fabrication cost through the deposition of thin films.2 However, both first and second generation devices suffer the same performance restrictions, such as “red losses” (photons with energies below the band gap of the device cannot be absorbed) and “blue losses” (photons with energies above the band gap lose their excess energy as heat). Third generation PVs, which represent the cutting edge of solar technologies, are designed to exceed the limits of single-junction devices for a high efficiency and a low production cost.2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently the leading photovoltaic device with regards to third generation PVs.3,4 Since a prototype for DSSCs was reported in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel,3 they have aroused an intense interest.5–8 Although the solar power conversion efficiency of DSSCs is lower than that of classic crystalline silicon cells, there is a high potential for improvement of the efficiency.9 Furthermore, nanomaterials are attracting attention in the development of DSSCs.10,11 Graphene, two-dimensional atomically thick carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal “honeycomb” lattice structure, is a rapidly rising star in nanomaterial research.12 As the thinnest 2D material, graphene possesses a high carrier mobility (>200000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an electron density of 4 × 10−9 cm−2),13,14 a high specific surface area (2600 m2 g−1)15 and a high optical transparency (97.7%).16 These unusual properties have stimulated the extensive exploration of graphene for use in transparent electrodes, as an electronic promoter and in counter electrodes for DSSCs.17–19 This mini review focuses on the investigation of the exciting and important area of graphene-based counter electrodes for DSSCs.
2. DSSC counter electrodes
As shown in Fig. 1, a typical dye-sensitized solar cell consists of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film as the photoanode, a counter electrode (CE) and an electrolyte with a redox couple in the liquid or solid state.20–22 The CE’s task is to reduce redox species in liquid solar cells, which are used as mediators in the regeneration of the sensitizer after electron injection, or to collect holes from the hole conducting material in solid-state DSSCs. For an optimized cell, one must choose a CE material with the lowest possible sheet resistance, excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of the redox electrolyte, high chemical stability and a low cost.
 Fig. 1  A schematic of a DSSC in principle. 
The reactions at the CE are dependent on the type of redox mediator used to transfer charge between the photoelectrode and the CE. In most cases, the iodide–tri-iodide couple has been employed as the redox mediator and the overall redox reaction in DSSCs can be described as: I3− + 2e ↔ 3I−(1)
The tri-iodides are produced near the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and reduced at the counter electrode. Platinum-loaded conducting glass has been widely employed as the standard CE for DSSCs due to its high catalytic activity and excellent conductivity as well as its high corrosion stability against iodine in the electrolyte.23–25 However, the combination between the limited resource of platinum and the large application of platinum-based catalysts in the vehicle industry makes platinum extremely expensive and in diminishing supply. Therefore, it is important to explore Pt-free materials to replace the Pt counter electrode for DSSCs.26 For this reason, recent attention has been focused on various materials as potential alternatives to Pt, including carbon,27–31 transition metal sulfides,32–36 nitrides37–41 and carbides.42
Kay and Grätzel first explored a graphite/carbon black mixture as a counter electrode43 due to its low cost and abundance. This pioneering work stimulated intensive researche to evaluate various types of carbon for DSSC counter electrodes. It was reported that, under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight, energy conversion efficiencies were 6.67, 3.9, 4.5 and 7.7% for DSSCs with counter electrodes of graphite,43 activated carbon,44 single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)45 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),46 respectively. Furthermore, DSSC with large-effective surface-area polyaromatic hydrocarbon (LPAH) counter electrodes achieved an energy conversion efficiency of 7.89%.47 Currently, the main drawback of carbon-based counter electrodes is the requirement of a large amount of carbon to reach comparable efficiencies to Pt-based CEs. This makes the device bulkier and more opaque.48 As a rising star in the carbon family, graphene, with its unique properties, is being explored as a DSSC counter electrode to solve these issues.
3. Graphene-based counter electrodes for DSSCs
Graphene was expected to be a promising material for DSSC counter electrodes due to its excellent conductivity that can decrease charge transfer resistance (Rct). Kaniyoor and Ramaprabhu49 showed that the Rct of thermally exfoliated graphene (TEG) films is 11.7 Ω cm2, which is very close to that of Pt electrodes (6.5 Ω cm2). The DSSCs fabricated with TEG as a counter electrode exhibited a power conversion efficiency of about 2.8%, comparable to that (about 3.4%) of Pt-based DSSCs. Furthermore, Zhang et al.50 made similar observations, namely, the Rct value of graphene nanosheet (GN) films is close to that of Pt, resulting in comparable efficiencies between the DSSCs using GNs and Pt as counter electrodes. So far, several groups have explored graphene-based counter electrodes.49–55 From Table 1, one can see that the reported efficiencies of DSSCs fabricated with graphene counter electrodes vary from 0.7 to 6.8%. The difference in the efficiency with graphene counter electrodes is mainly due to the utilization of different techniques for the graphene film preparation and the DSSC fabrication. Graphene films for DSSC counter electrodes have been formed by various techniques, including thermal exfoliation from graphite oxide,49 the oxidative exfoliation of graphite followed by hydrazine reduction,50 the chemical reduction of graphene oxide colloids under microwave irradiation51 and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) followed by an annealing treatment.52,53 So far, the best DSSC efficiency (6.8%) has been obtained with a graphene counter electrode fabricated via the following approach:50 graphene nanosheets (GN), which were synthesized by a hydrazine reduction of exfoliated graphene oxide, were ground in a terpineol solution and then deposited on a FTO glass, followed by annealing in air. It was shown that the annealing temperature used for the GN-based counter electrode exhibited a remarkable effect on the performance of DSSCs, namely, the PV performance increased and then dropped with an increasing annealing temperature (Fig. 2).50 The optimized annealing temperature was 400 °C, at which the best performance was achieved. The best cell showed a short-circuit current (JSC) of 17 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.747 V and a fill factor (FF) of 53.62% under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, leading to a high energy conversion efficiency of 6.8%. It was found that there was a trade-off between enhancing the adhesion and increasing the electrical conductivity of the GN film on the FTO glass by the annealing treatment in air. When the annealing temperature was higher than 400 °C, the GN film was easier to peel off from the substrate due to the presence of fewer organic binders (terpineol and ethyl cellulose), which were burned out at high temperatures, causing a higher Rct in the counter electrode.

The performance of a DSSC with a graphene counter electrode is dependent on the structure of graphene. Perfect graphene has an extremely high conductivity, but it may possess a limited number of active sites for I3−/I− electrocatalysis. Kavan et al. demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of graphene nanosheets is usually associated with its defects and oxygen-containing functional groups.56 It is well known that lattice surface defects exist in graphene sheets prepared from graphite via an oxidation–reduction approach. Lattice defects are considered as electrocatalytic active sites. On the other hand, Roy-Mayhew et al. found that increasing the number of oxygen-containing functional groups in a graphene sheet enhanced its electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction.57 Furthermore, Xu et al. reported that reduced graphene oxide (RGO) functionalized with –NHCO– groups exhibited a higher catalytic ability than the original RGO.58 This indicates that –NHCO– groups can increase catalytic activity. However, it is still unclear what specific oxygen-containing functional groups in the RGO sheets are mainly responsible for the I3−/I− electrocatalysis. In addition, it was found that the DSSC with the counter electrode, which was made from partially reduced graphene oxide, exhibited a low conversion efficiency equal to 40% that of a Pt-based cell.59 This happened because the partially reduced graphene oxide had too many oxygen-containing groups, which decreased the electrical conductivity of graphene.60,61 Therefore, one must make a balance between the electrical conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity of graphene to optimize the DSSC by functionalization.
Graphene possesses an excellent mechanical flexibility. Tung et al.62 showed that, after bending to 60° more than 10 times, the electrical resistance of a graphene film remained almost unchanged, whereas the resistance of the brittle indium tin oxide (ITO) film was increased by a factor of 3. Furthermore, Lee et al. demonstrated that a DSSC with a graphene-based counter electrode exhibited almost the same cell performances before and after bending of the electrode.63 In contrast, for a DSSC with an ITO-based counter electrode, the performance was greatly degraded after the bending treatment. This indicates that graphene can be exploited to fabricate flexible counter electrodes for DSSCs.
4. Graphene-based composites for counter electrodes
4.1 Graphene/polymer composites
Since the composite materials of graphene with conductive polymers were first reported by Stankovich et al. in 2006,64 graphene-based composite materials have attracted much attention. Recently, graphene/conductive polymer composite films have been employed as counter electrodes in DSSCs.65,66 In the composite films, the polymer can act as a conductive support, with graphene being responsible for catalysis.65 As shown in Fig. 3a, the graphene sheets were dispersed uniformly in the (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) matrix due to strong static interactions between 1-pyrenebutyrate (PB−)-functionalized graphene sheets and the PEDOT chains. In this composite system, graphene sheets can provide high catalytic activity toward the reduction of iodine, while PEDOT-PSS can form a highly conductive matrix around the graphene sheets.67 The DSSC with such a graphene/PEDOT-PSS counter electrode exhibited an efficiency of 4.5%, which is higher than that (2.3%) of the DSSC with a PEDOT-PSS counter electrode in the absence of graphene (Table 2).65

On the other hand, graphene sheets can also be used as a support for conductive polymers. To disperse a conductive polymer on graphene sheets, Wang et al.66 synthesized polyaniline (PANI) on graphene sheets as a nanocomposite material by an in situ polymerization technique. As a result, the graphene sheets were homogeneously coated with polyaniline nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). The DSSC, which was fabricated with the PANI/graphene counter electrode, achieved a high conversion efficiency of 6.09%, which is close to that (6.88%) of the corresponding cell with a Pt counter electrode. Lee et al. dispersed PEDOT on a graphene layer as a counter electrode.63 The DSSC with such a graphene/PEDOT composite counter electrode showed a high efficiency of 6.26%. This occurred because the incorporation of graphene into PEDOT resulted in, not only the superior electrochemical activity, but also much faster transport through the composite film.
4.2 Graphene/metal composites
A strategy to reduce Pt loading in DSSCs is to exploit Pt/graphene composite materials as counter electrodes.68–70 Gong et al. synthesized a Pt/graphene composite (Fig. 4(a)) via the self-assembly of polyelectrolyte, graphene and H2PtCl6, followed by an annealing treatment.68 The DSSC with the Pt/graphene composite as a counter electrode achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.66%, comparable to that (8.16%) of the DSSC with a sputtered-Pt counter electrode. Importantly, the Pt/graphene counter electrode contained much less Pt than the sputtered-Pt electrode, leading to a dramatic decrease in the DSSC fabrication cost. Furthermore, the effect of Pt loading on the PV performance of the DSSCs was evaluated by Bajai et al.69 They deposited Pt nanoparticles on graphene layers using a pulsed laser ablation method (Fig. 4b) and revealed that the amount of Pt loading had a remarkable influence on the efficiency of the resulting DSSCs. An optimized Pt loading (27.43%) was obtained. The DSSC with the optimized Pt/graphene counter electrode not only contained a lower amount of Pt, but it also exhibited an improved conversion efficiency. The efficiency improvement was attributed to the increase in the graphene sheet defects caused by Pt as the D/G ratio of the Raman spectra (Fig. 5) was increased by incorporating Pt into the graphene sheets.70

Ni was also combined with graphene to form composite counter electrodes. Dou et al. employed a hydrothermal reaction for the synthesis of Ni12P5/graphene composites, in which Ni12P5 nanoparticles were embedded into the graphene sheets (Fig. 4d).71 Furthermore, they demonstrated that the Ni12P5/graphene exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, resulting in a high efficiency (5.7%) for the DSSC with the Ni12P5/graphene counter electrode (Table 3).

The role of graphene in these metal/graphene composite materials was recognized as a scaffold to well disperse metal (Pt or Ni12P5) particles, increasing the availability of the metal particles for electron transfer.70,71 Furthermore, graphene could also provide a fast diffusion pathway for the electrolyte and ensure excellent electrode–electrolyte contact, which improves the electron transfer rate at the interface. The metal (Pt or Ni12P5) nanoparticle can serve as both the active site for electrocatalytic processes and the spacer between the graphene sheets to accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte (Fig. 6).

4.3 Graphene/carbon nanotube composites
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been well investigated as catalytic materials for DSCCs.72–74 This interest has been due to SWCNT and MWCNT showed promising electrical conductivity and extremely large and tunable surface areas. Furthermore, their controllable defect edges could facilitate the electron kinetics associated with I3− reduction. In addition, as we discussed above, graphene has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for counter electrodes. This has stimulated recent interest in exploring graphene/CNT composites as counter electrode materials for DSSCs (Table 4).75–79

Choi et al. fabricated a counter electrode using the graphene/MWCNT composite material, in which carbon nanotubes were grown on chemical reduced graphene layers via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (Fig. 7a).75 The I–V characteristics of the DSSC with the graphene/MWCNT counter electrode are shown in Fig. 7b. The cell exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 3.0%, which is higher than that of the DSSC with a MWCNT-based counter electrode. The efficiency improvement was attributed to the expansion of the reaction area (at the interface) due to the vertically grown MWCNTs on the graphene sheets. The performance of graphene/MWCNT counter electrodes was further improved by modifying its preparation approach, namely, graphene was first prepared on a SiO2/Si substrate via CVD, followed by the growth of carbon nanotubes on top of the graphene layer.76 The DSSC with the CVD graphene/MWCNT counter electrode showed an efficiency of 4.46%. Furthermore, Zhu et al. exploited the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method to synthesize reduced graphene–CNT composite materials as DSSC counter electrodes.77 From Fig. 8, one can see that the composite material possesses a graphene–CNT network structure that can ensure an excellent contact between the graphene sheets and the CNTs. The I–V characteristics of the DSSCs with the graphene/CNT composite counter electrodes show that, with an increasing of CNTs to graphene in the composite film, the efficiency of the DSSC increases first (reaching a maximum value of 6.17% at 60% CNTs) and then decreases (Fig. 8). The optimized content (60%) of CNTs in the graphene/CNT composite counter electrode was further confirmed by Battumur et al., who prepared graphene/CNT composite films with a doctor blade method.78 The initial increase in the efficiency of the DSSC was attributed to the formation of a graphene–CNTs network structure, whereas the final decrease may be due to a lower specific surface area of CNTs in comparison to graphene sheets.77 Velten et al. also investigated graphene and MWCNT composite materials for DSSC counter electrodes.79 They found that the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC with a graphene/MWCNTs composite counter electrode was 7.55%, which is higher than that using MWCNTs alone (6.62%). This was attributed to the increase of the electrical conductivity between the MWCNT bundles and the graphene sheets.79

5. Outlook
Graphene is a novel counter electrode material for the development of DSSCs with a high performance and a low cost due to its tunable structure and excellent conductivity, as well as its high film-flexibility.
It was found that the defects and functional groups of the graphene sheets play a critical role in the electrocatalytic sites in DSSC counter electrodes. Therefore, tuning the defects and searching for effective functional groups for graphene sheets may be promising research directions for graphene-based DSSCs.
Transition metal sulfides34–36 and nitrides37–41 are effective materials for DSSC counter electrodes. It would be reasonable to expect the further improvement of DSSC efficiency via the combination of graphene sheets with these compounds to produce effective composite counter electrodes.
So far, there is very limited information regarding the electrocatalytic mechanism of graphene sheets in DSSC counter electrodes. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the role of graphene in the counter electrodes needs intensive future research.

Broader context
Solar energy is the largest single source of clean energy. However, energy prices based on the present solar technologies are incomparable to those of fossil fuels. Highly efficient solar cells are necessary and urgent. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently leading third generation photovoltaic devices, which represent the cutting edge of solar technologies with a high efficiency and low production cost. One of the great challenges for DSSCs is the development of Pt-free counter electrodes (CEs). As a rising star, graphene has been demonstrated to be a promising counter electrode material for DSSCs due to its excellent conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity, as well as its good mechanical flexibility. In this article, we evaluated the performance of graphene-based counter electrodes in DSSCs, analyzed the conductivity and structure of graphene with regards to its performance in DSSCs and formulated strategies for the further improvement of graphene counter electrodes.
