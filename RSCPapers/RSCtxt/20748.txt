    , Accepted 17th April 2012First published on 17th April 2012AbstractWe report a nickel oxide (NiOx) thin film, from a cost-effective sol–gel process, coated n-type silicon (n-Si) as a photoanode for efficient photo-oxidation of water under neutral pH condition. The NiOx thin film has three functions: (i) serves as a protection layer to improve the chemical stability of the Si photoelectrode, (ii) acts as an oxygen evolution catalyst, and (iii) provides junction photovoltage to further reduce overpotential. The oxygen evolution onset potential is reduced to below the thermodynamic water oxidation level and oxygen evolution was observed at low overpotentials. Our results demonstrate the fabrication of robust photoelectrodes from low-cost NiOx and Si, which enable a practical solar water oxidation with high efficiency.

Broader context
Silicon is a very attractive photovoltaic material for efficient solar energy harvesting and has been broadly used for solar cells. However, it is not chemically robust enough for practical photolysis or solar water splitting applications. Herein, we report nickel oxide coated silicon as a highly efficient photoelectrode for water oxidation. The reported electrode offers improved oxidation overpotential from p/n junction formation, catalyzed oxygen evolution, and prolonged operation lifetime. Moreover, the heterogeneous photoelectrode uses cheap and earth abundant materials, employs low cost and scalable processes, and is potentially practical for solar hydrogen production.

Traditional hydrocarbon-based energy sources emit large amount of green-house gases to the atmosphere and have caused serious environmental issues. Converting and storing solar energy has great potential to address these problems.1 Artificial photosynthesis (AP) mimics photosynthesis by using solar energy to drive a water oxidation reaction and to produce free electrons which consequently generate hydrogen2 or carbohydrate with CO2 participation.3 One viable approach to AP is via inorganic semiconductor photo-electrochemistry, where semiconductor photoelectrodes harvest solar energy, generate photocarriers (electrons and holes), and then conduct electrochemical reactions at semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces. This creates a huge potential to produce sustainable energy and to reduce CO2 emission4 with a minimum number of energy conversion steps and thus offers a theoretically higher efficiency.5 A major challenge with this particular approach for AP is to engineer and manufacture efficient photoelectrodes and catalysts from stable, non-toxic, and low cost materials to meet the global energy demand.
Silicon is an attractive candidate for photovoltaic applications in terms of moderate energy band-gap and great abundance on earth.6 However, one of the problems with Si for photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell applications is that an insulating oxide film rapidly forms on the surface in aqueous solutions under either working or idle condition and thus the Si photoelectrode becomes immediately disabled from the oxide passivation. Approaches for this purpose include coating the Si surface with organic polymers,7,8 derivatives,9–11 metals or silicides,12–14 wide band-gap semiconductors,15,16 and/or selecting proper electrolytes.17–20
Besides the unfavourable thermodynamics discussed above, the other critical problem with the n-Si photoanode is associated with the kinetics of the competing carrier recombination. This results in the high overpotential loss; thus a high anodic bias is needed to drive the water oxidation process/oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In general, research focused on using the n-Si photoanode by means of altering charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor–liquid interface to improve the current efficiency for the net water oxidation while limiting the anodic decomposition current. To make OER as well as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as facile as possible, electrocatalysts have been broadly studied theoretically and experimentally.21,22 Widely reported OER catalysts in the form of organic molecular, metal particles, or inorganic oxides normally contain transition metals of high electrochemical activity such as Mn,23 Co24 and Ru/Ir.25 On the other hand, non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (NiOx) is considered as one of the best OER electrocatalysts.26 Although with higher overpotential than RuO2 and IrO2,27 an NiOx based electrocatalyst is more abundant and thus cost-effective (Ni is the 9th most abundant element in the earth's crust). Moreover, NiOx has a wide band-gap and is one of the very few stable and p-type transition metal oxides.28
In this communication, we report the use of an inexpensive sol–gel NiOx thin film coated n-Si photoanode for photo-oxidation of water operated under neutral pH condition. The NiOx thin film has three functions – it protects Si from direct contact with aqueous solution and thus prevents severe anodic decomposition of Si during PEC operation. It serves as an OER electrocatalyst and provides junction photovoltage, both of which assist in the improvement of surface kinetics, reduction of the oxygen evolution onset potential, and therefore improvement of the overall water oxidation efficiency.
The NiOx film was prepared using a previously reported sol–gel method29,30 and subsequently dried in air at 300 °C afterwards (see ESI†). Further annealing at 400 °C in an inert environment was conducted to improve the crystallinity. Fig. 1a shows the typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) images with the cross-sectional view and 75° angle view of an annealed NiOx film on n-Si. Both the as-prepared and annealed films were very uniform and crack-free (Fig. S1†). An atomic force microscopy (AFM) study on the annealed film revealed a root mean square-RMS surface roughness of 1.07 nm, indicating a very smooth surface. The annealed NiOx film with a thickness of 37.4 nm showed >90% transmittance at a wavelength of 600 nm, indicating a very transparent coating (Fig. S2†). In addition, the annealed NiOx film also showed a decreased refractive index (1.74 measured at a wavelength of 632.8 nm). Therefore, the NiOx film also served partially as an anti-reflection coating on planar Si allowing minimized optical loss in the NiOx film as well as at the interfaces.

The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis showed an oxygen rich composition in the annealed NiOx film. The films were further characterized using the X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (see ESI†). O K-edge absorption in the photon energy range of 535–550 eV in the XANES study corresponds to O 2p state hybridized with Ni 4sp state,31 or the multiple scattering states.32 The distinguished peaks resolved from the broad peak in the as-prepared film suggested a film with an improved crystallinity by thermal annealing (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the peak at ∼532 eV to ∼533 eV indicated a transition to O 2p state hybridized with Ni 3d state.31 Relative peak intensity and peak shape of the transition to O 2p/Ni 3d states reflected the Ni–O covalence, i.e. an intensive peak could mean stronger Ni 3d/O 2p hybridization (stronger covalence). Therefore the relatively reduced peak intensity and sharpened peak profile in the annealed film hinted at a more ionic Ni–O bonding,33 which also shifts the O K-edge threshold negatively. The Ni L-edge spectra (Fig. 1d) showed that the Ni2+ oxidation dominated in both samples and an increase of peak ratio of 852.5 eV over 854.4 eV at the L3 edge of the annealed sample clearly indicated a reduced oxidation state by annealing in an inert environment.34

Fig. 1e shows the O 1s spectrum of the as-prepared and annealed NiOx films. The broad peak at 532.5 eV was the only peak resolved from as-prepared sol–gel NiOx film, probably due to C–O bonding of the residual organic species in the sol–gel film. This broad peak diminished during the annealing process. The peaks at 529.5 and 531.2 eV indicated the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ in the annealed film, respectively. The peak intensity ratio suggested a Ni2+ rich film. Analysis of the main peak of Ni 2p3/2 photoelectron spectra (854.0 eV) and satellite of the as-prepared and annealed NiOx films provided semi-quantitative evidence of the degree of non-stoichiometry (Fig. 1f). Satellite intensity (855.9 eV) dropped while the main peak (854.0 eV) intensity increased from the annealed NiOx film suggesting a reduction in Ni3+ concentration, which strongly supports the XANES and EDXS results. Further Ar+ plasma depth profiling showed an increased intensity at a new peak (852.6 eV) due to the partial reduction of the film (not shown), which was also strongly dependant on the Ni3+ concentration.35 In addition, an XPS depth profiling study revealed the reduced oxygen concentration from surface (Ni:O = 1:1.41) to bulk (Ni:O = 1:1.15), which was believed to originate from the adsorption of oxygen mainly at the surface.

Fig. 2 shows a cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. S3†) comparison of various well-accepted metal oxide protected n-Si photoanodes in a PBS buffered 0.25 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 7.2) including titanium dioxide (TiO2) and tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), together with proposed NiOx which represent three typical material selection strategies in n-Si based heterojunction photoanodes. Although all three are intrinsically wide band-gap, they show distinguished optoelectrical and electrochemical properties. TiO2 is a well-known ultra-violet (UV) sensitive photocatalyst exhibiting n-type conduction, while ITO is non-photosensitive but highly conductive. NiOx, on the other hand, is a non-photosensitive p-type electrocatalyst. Differences between these strategies are compared and discussed in detail below. n-Si|NiOx (curve 1) showed the lowest onset potential (Vph-onset) in the CV studies, which is defined as the potential where photocurrent density is higher than 0.1 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. This value of 0.52 V was lower than that of the photoelectrodes with ITO coatings by RF sputtering and ultrathin TiO2 by atomic layer deposition (ALD, see ESI†). Moreover, the Vph-onset of n-Si|NiOx was even below the thermodynamic oxidation level of water (EH2O/O2, green dashed line). Indeed, oxygen bubbles were observed to form on the surface at a low overpotential (132 mV). Furthermore, the n-Si|NiOx photoelectrode showed a much sharper turn-on of photocurrent compared to the samples coated by ITO and TiO2 (curves 2 and 3) and a minimum difference between forward and backward scans suggesting a greater stability of the NiOx protected Si. Curve 3 in Fig. 2 shows the CV scan of the n-Si photoanode protected by TiO2 coating, which is a well-accepted passivation layer.36 The n-Si|TiO2 electrode showed the highest Vph-onset of 1.646 V and lowest current density. The TiO2 layer was deposited using ALD for 50 cycles and was about 2.5 nm in thickness. The purpose of the ultrathin TiO2 layer was to minimize the strong photocatalytic effect from TiO2 while the photogenerated carriers from Si and Si–TiO2 interface can tunnel through. A detailed study showed that an increase of TiO2 thickness (from 2.5 to 75.5 nm) resulted in an increase of photoanodic current from TiO2, which changed the tunnelling current to recombination-limited current.37 Curve 3 also showed an irreversible reaction in the n-Si|TiO2 system. This is presumably due to the non-optimized ALD growth condition in our system, caused by trapped Cl atoms in the film.38 Consecutive multiple linear scans with a minimum stabilization time of 20 min between each scan and a long term stability scan at fixed external bias were collected (Fig. S4†). Current density at anodic bias (2 V) dropped from 0.3 to 0.07 mA cm−2. This current degradation could be explained by the existence of pinholes providing pathways for Si oxidation in the presence of water. Most importantly, an ultrathin TiO2 coating does not change the surface kinetics for charge transfer; therefore a large overpotential is still needed to drive a significant oxygen evolution current. In addition, as-grown TiO2 showed high resistivity, which potentially causes the accumulation of holes at the interface and reduces current level.

Curve 2 (n-Si|ITO) in Fig. 2 shows overall higher photocurrent density in the same bias range and lower Vph-onset (1.454 V) compared to curve 3 (n-Si|TiO2). Hall measurement revealed that the annealed ITO showed resistivity of as low as 5.9 × 10−4 Ω cm (carrier concentration 4.09 × 1020 cm−3 and Hall mobility 23.4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high conductivity of ITO coating facilitated the hole transportation and removed photogenerated holes rapidly from the Si surface to the water,16 which is one of the major reasons for the improved photocurrents. ITO protected n-/p-Si photoelectrodes were studied before,39 and chemical stability of ITO is still a concern (Fig. S4†), which is related to the grained structure and chemical composition of ITO, as well as the bias polarity and pH environment.
Compared to ultrathin TiO2 coating and conductive ITO coating, the coating of NiOx to the n-Si photoanode has different electron transfer process at the interface. The mechanism of the NiOx catalytic effect is summarized in a reversible process below:40 (1) Ni(II/III) + H2O + h+ → Ni(II/III)(OH) + H+(2) 2Ni(II/III)(OH) → Ni(II/III)(O) + Ni(II/III) + H2O(3) 2Ni(II/III)(O) → 2Ni(II/III) + O2↑(4)where Ni(II/III) in the equation above is the divalent or trivalent active site of Ni at the surface. Photogenerated free electrons in Si (eqn (1)) are blocked by a high conduction band barrier at the Si–NiOx junction and flow to the back-contact. Holes, on the other hand, drift across the junction by the built-in field and participate in a series of surface reactions (eqn (2)) at potentials significantly lower than the water oxidation potential. Interstitial O and higher state Ni ions (Ni3+) exist in NiOx and Ni3+ ions act as acceptors leading to the p-type conductivity,41 as well as OER catalytic centres.42,43 The catalytic performance of the photoelectrodes was also investigated using a Tafel plot44 extracted from the voltammetric scan (Fig. S5†), where one can see the greatly reduced overpotential as well as the reduced Tafel slope by switching ITO (n-Si|ITO blue ▲) to NiOx (n-Si|NiOx black ■). To further evaluate the catalytic effect of the NiOx thin film, we performed a comparative study on NiOx and Ir coatings. Ir is in the same transition metal group with Pt and is broadly used in catalysis, which is also the best corrosion-resistant metal. In our study, an ultrathin Ir layer (2–3 nm), with small grain sizes and a high transmittance, was sputtered on n-Si|ITO and n-Si|NiOx photoelectrodes. Fig. 3a shows that n-Si|ITO|Ir (dark cyan ▼) had lower overpotential compared to that of n-Si|ITO|NiOx (magenta ◀), which is consistent with previously reported results.27 However, the n-Si|NiOx|Ir (red ●) photoelectrode showed minuscule improvement with respect to n-Si|NiOx. The lowest Tafel slope from the best of device was 129 mV per decade, which is close to the generally accepted 120 mV per decade on high surface area catalysts.25 This value is considerably large compared to the previously reported best NiOx electrocatalysts,45 presumably due to the limited mass transport,46 the high resistivity of the NiOx film, as well as the low concentration of Ni3+ in annealed film.
 Fig. 3  (a) Comparison of the Tafel plot of n-Si|ITO, n-Si|NiOx, n-Si|ITO|Ir, and n-Si|NiOx|Ir under illumination at 100 mW cm−2, and (b) comparison of voltammetric behavior of samples showing dark catalytic properties of NiOx and Ir coated n-Si|ITO sample. 
The electrocatalytic effect of NiOx and Ir can be further identified by electrolysis in the dark (Fig. 3b). One can observe that due to the metallic nature of ITO and change of interface energetics by adding ITO between the electrolyte and Si, the dark electrolysis current of n-Si|ITO exponentially increased after an anodic bias of 2 V (curve 1) with an actual Vph-onset at 2.46 V. NiOx and Ir coating on n-Si|ITO showed clear dark catalysis (curve 2 and 3) with Vph-onset of 1.39 V and 1.18 V, respectively. This was due to the intrinsically higher catalytic activity of Ir compared to NiOx. Anodic waves prior to the oxygen evolution current (curve 2) are due to oxidation and regeneration of Ni3+ ions.47
In order to isolate the catalytic effect from the photovoltage effect in the n-Si|p-NiO PEC electrode, we also characterized the NiOx coating on n-Si|ITO whose overpotential and Tafel slope, interestingly, fall between that of n-Si|ITO and n-Si|NiOx. The n-Si|ITO|NiOx showed a reduced overpotential and Tafel slope compared to that of n-Si|ITO and demonstrated the catalytic effect of NiOx, while increased values compared to that of n-Si|NiOx indicated an additional effect from the p-NiOx–n-Si junction owing to the junction photovoltage. Rectifying I–V behaviour in the dark indicated a solid-state p–n junction between p-NiOx and n-Si (Fig. S6†). The solid state n-Si|p-NiOx heterojunction photovoltaic devices showed an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 300 mV under 100 mW cm−2 solar irradiation, which could further reduce the overpotential needed. A similar idea using photovoltage to reduce overpotential was demonstrated earlier.48 The p-NiOx–n-Si junction facilitated the separation of photo-induced charge carriers under the built-in electric field and p-NiOx also served as a hole transporter and electron blocking layer43,49 minimizing the leakage and dark current. However, we were not able to obtain the conductivity of NiOx film presumably due to the small hole mobility.50 The non-optimized conductivity of the film was believed to be one of the limiting factors to the low photocurrent density.51
The applied bias solar conversion efficiency (ABCE) was calculated using eqn (3), (5)where J is the current density (mA cm−2), Vapp is the applied electrode bias (V vs. Pt counter electrode), E is the Nernst potential for water oxidation (V vs. Ag/AgCl 1 M KCl at pH = 7.2), P is the incident optical power density (100 mW cm−2 in all the measurement), and α is the integrated optical attenuation coefficient introduced by the measurement setup (Fig. S7†). In order to take into account the ohmic losses and overpotential losses at the counter electrode, we used a two-electrode setup for this calculation25 (Fig. S8†). Together with the aforementioned CV results, performances of various n-Si photoanode-based structures are summarized in Table 1. Power conversion efficiency was calculated at an additional overpotential of 432 mV to the water oxidation level (1 V of applied bias vs. Pt counter electrode). The n-Si|NiOx photoelectrodes showed 1.34% overall conversion efficiency, which is orders of magnitude higher than that of n-Si|ITO or n-Si|TiO2 photoelectrodes. It is also much larger than the conversion efficiency of n-Si|ITO|NiOx (0.30%). Coating catalytic Ir thin film on n-Si|NiOx and n-Si|ITO photoelectrodes showed increase of conversion efficiency to 1.37% and 0.33%, respectively.

No noticeable changes or damages on the NiOx surface were observed after the CV study in PEC measurements, indicating the chemical and mechanical robustness. The ability of forming a uniform and robust thin film is one of the most critical merits for a photoanode protection layer. Although the photoelectrode was still able to provide efficient water oxidation current after 4 h of intermittent operation over 3 days (Fig. S9†), the n-Si|NiOx photoelectrode showed current degradation over time. Possible reasons included deactivation of NiOx, limited diffusion of hydroxide, and deconstructive high current density. These possibilities are currently under investigation through various approaches.
Conclusions
Sol–gel NiOx functionalized Si photoanodes were studied for high efficiency water photo-oxidation. n-Si|NiOx shows a negative-shifted onset potential to about 1.18 V (vs. RHE), which is lower than that of other metal oxide coatings and is below the thermodynamic water oxidation level. Catalytic effects of the photoelectrodes are investigated and demonstrated using Tafel plots from comparisons of various systems under illumination and in the dark. The n-Si|NiOx photoelectrode shows 1.34% overall conversion efficiency, which is more than 4.5 times larger than that of n-Si|ITO|NiOx and orders of magnitude higher than that of the n-Si|ITO or n-Si|TiO2 photoelectrode. A minimum difference between forward and backward scans is observed from the NiOx coated electrode indicating a greater electrochemical stability. The sol–gel based approach is cost-effective and does not require any high-profile equipment for film deposition. The highly transparent NiOx film from this technique also minimizes the light loss. These results enable a stable, low-cost and protective electrocatalyst made of an earth abundant element52 and its coating to n-Si. This structure offers a potential solution to scalable and mass-producible low cost photoelectrochemical cells for practical clean hydrogen fuel production and artificial photosynthesis.

Broader context
Silicon is a very attractive photovoltaic material for efficient solar energy harvesting and has been broadly used for solar cells. However, it is not chemically robust enough for practical photolysis or solar water splitting applications. Herein, we report nickel oxide coated silicon as a highly efficient photoelectrode for water oxidation. The reported electrode offers improved oxidation overpotential from p/n junction formation, catalyzed oxygen evolution, and prolonged operation lifetime. Moreover, the heterogeneous photoelectrode uses cheap and earth abundant materials, employs low cost and scalable processes, and is potentially practical for solar hydrogen production.
