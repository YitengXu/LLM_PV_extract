    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 15th August 2018AbstractHybrid nanostructures comprising disparate materials and having intricate shapes and facets are highly desired in photocatalytic applications requiring high selectivity. However, to produce such structures requires precise morphological control, and this is largely dictated by the stringent requirements of the reaction conditions, in addition to intricate, expensive, or tedious preparation steps. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable method for the preparation of hybrid nanostructures that combines carbon dots with hexagonal nanoplates of nickel-based compounds. The resultant heterostructure not only improves visible light absorption, but also exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol when compared to carbon dots or hexagonal nanoplates of nickel-based compounds alone. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to the higher separation and transfer efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers at the interface between the carbon dot and hexagonal nanoplate of nickel-based compounds. This work opens up a straightforward and effective route to yield inexpensive and efficient photocatalysts for improved solar energy capture and conversion.
1. Introduction
The properties of a nanomaterial are determined by a set of physical parameters that may include its composition, size, shape, and structure.1 It is well-established that the catalytic activity of a nanomaterial can be enhanced by reducing its size; yet, its selectivity and efficacy depend mostly on the packing of atoms on the surface or the exposed facets.1,2 Since the facets exposed on a nanomaterial have a strong correlation to their shape, shape-controlled nanomaterials are of great interest not only for obtaining catalysts with precise activity and selectivity, but also for understanding catalytic phenomena.1,2 The growth and morphology of shape-controlled nanomaterials are affected by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. These include temperature, pressure, precursor concentrations, regulation of the surface energy by the adsorption of additives and impurities, and mass transport limitations.1 Consequently, the fabrication of shape-controlled nanomaterials not only demands stringent control over reaction conditions, but also intricate, tedious, or costly preparation steps. The simple, inexpensive and large-scale synthesis of shape-controlled nanomaterials remains a challenge.
Carbon dots (CDs) are carbonaceous particles less than 10 nm in size and composed of sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon.3 Due to their ease of synthesis, low cost, excellent optical properties, good stability and non-toxicity, CDs are increasingly being employed for photocatalytic solar-to-energy conversion.3–5 When applied in such settings, CDs typically serve as either electron donors or electron acceptors6 and are used in combination with various other materials. Such combinations offer enhanced photocatalytic performance through unique interfacial regions that facilitate charge separation and increase the concentration of charge carriers available for photoreactions. As a result, a series of CD-based photocatalysts, including CDs coupled with semiconductors, conjugated compounds, metals, and molecules, have been developed for applications that include: photocatalytic degradation,7–11 H2 evolution,12–15 CO2 conversion,16,17 or fine organic synthesis.18–22 In most cases, however, the nanostructures coupled with CDs present spherical or irregular shapes. Only limited morphologies of nanostructures in combination with CDs have been reported to date. Among the different morphologies, the ultrathin nanosheets or two-dimensional layered nanostructures as one of the components in the heterostructures have been demonstrated to show better catalytic performance because of their larger specific areas and higher loading capability of CDs.10,13
Nickel compounds (such as oxides and sulfides) are rich in valence states and are highly abundant, and have been widely used in electrocatalysis, electrochemical capacitors and lithium batteries.22–25 It has been demonstrated that the nanorods, nanosheets and nanotubes of Ni compounds generally possess high performance catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction or the oxygen evolution reaction with the aid of abundant active sites at their surface.23–25 However, there is only limited information on the photocatalytic performance of nickel compounds, or as components of co-catalysts.
Recently, we reported the synthesis of CDs by the reaction of coal pitch powder with a mixed solution of formic acid and H2O2.26 Herein, we employ a piece of fresh Ni foam to remove excess formic acid from the CD solution via a dissolution reaction, thereby producing a heterostructure combining CDs and hexagonal nanoplates of nickel-based compounds after water evaporation. This method toward a hybrid nanostructure does not require stringent or complicated experimental conditions, nor tedious, costly, or inefficient preparation steps. Furthermore, it is scalable, and capable of producing gram-scale quantities or greater. Importantly, the resultant heterostructure exhibits stronger light capture and much better activities for the photo-reduction of nitrobenzene than CDs alone. We found that the formed electrostatic field at the interfaces between the hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds and CDs promoted highly efficient photogenerated charge separation and migration, hence resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
All chemicals such as formic acid (88 v/v%), H2O2 (30 v/v%), 4-nitrophenol and NaBH4 were purchased from Aladdin, and they were directly used without further purification in our experiments. Ni foam (99.8%) was purchased from Taiyuan Power Source Co., Ltd, China.
2.2 Carbon dot preparation
The CDs were prepared by our reported method.26 Simply, 200 mg of coal pitch powder was transferred into a mixed solution containing 30 mL of formic acid (88 v/v%) and 3 mL of H2O2 (30 v/v%), and the resultant slurry was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 8000 rpm, the supernatant liquid containing the suspension of CDs was retained, and the precipitate was discarded. The concentration of CDs is estimated to be 2.6 ± 0.1 g L−1 based on our reported work.26 The photoluminescence (PL) and structure images of CDs are given in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†).
2.3 Carbon dot–hexagonal nickel compound nanocomposite preparation
The nanocomposite of CDs with nickel compound hexagonal nanoplates (named S1) was prepared as follows (ESI, Fig. S3†): a piece of fresh Ni foam (50 mg) was immersed into a beaker containing the as-prepared CD solution mentioned above, at room temperature. After reacting for beyond 18 h, the Ni foam was completely dissolved (see Fig. S4†). It was found that the PL emission of the CD solution was significantly quenched by Ni2+ ions (Fig. S5†). Subsequently, the resultant solution was heated to 180 °C till it was ultimately dried out and a khaki-coloured solid was obtained. For comparison, another experiment was performed using the same procedure as that of S1; however, the as-prepared CD solution was substituted with the mixed solution of 30 mL of formic acid and 3 mL of H2O2. The dissolution of Ni foam in this mixture was much faster than that in CD solution (Fig. S4†). Consequently, an aqua-solid coloured powder containing only hexagonal nanoplates of nickel compounds was produced, and was named S2.
2.4 Sample characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by dropping dilute products onto carbon coated copper grids. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different samples were obtained using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer at CuKα radiation with a scanning rate of 2° min−1 in the 2θ range of 5–90°. Light absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of all samples were recorded using a Kratos AXIS 165 mutitechnique electron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source for determining the composition and chemical bonding configurations. The zeta potentials of the samples were monitored using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS analyser.
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell system. Sample electrodes were prepared by dip-casting ethanol suspensions of the samples onto 2 cm × 4 cm indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrodes, which were then dried in a vacuum at 70 °C for 2 h to evaporate the solvent. 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte solution, and a Pt coil and Ag/AgCl reference electrode acted as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Linear potential scans were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 within a given potential window. All of the data were collected on a Bio-Logic (SP 120) electrochemical workstation.
2.5 Photocatalysis test
In order to prevent the signals from the sample powders S1 and S2, or CDs, from interfering with those of the photoactive reactants and products during UV-Vis absorbance measurements, 5 mg of sample powder was blended with approximately 10 μL of a polyvinyl butyral (PVB, 1 mg) ethanol (1 mL) solution under stirring. The resultant mixture was drop casted onto a glass sheet (2 cm × 4 cm) and then air-dried. The glass sheet coated with the sample powder was immersed in an aqueous reaction solution obtained by mixing 7.5 mL of 0.05 mM 4-nitrophenol and 7.5 mL of 10 mM NaBH4. The solution was irradiated with light from a 300 W xenon lamp placed 30 cm away. Optical cut-off filters were utilized to remove wavelengths below 420 nm, ensuring that only visible and IR light impinged the samples during the photocatalytic tests. All photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a room with tightly controlled air conditioning in order to minimize heating effects. The light intensity reaching the solution was about 100 mW cm−2. The decrease in 4-nitrophenol concentration and the formation of reduction products were monitored using UV−vis spectrophotometry by taking aliquots at regular intervals.
3. Results and discussion
SEM images of the as-prepared samples (S1 and S2) are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S6 (ESI†). These images reveal the formation of hexagonal nanoplates whose size is less than 1 μm. The morphology and structure of these hexagonal nanoplates are further elucidated by TEM observation, where uniform hexagonal nanostructures (inset of Fig. 1b) are consistent with the SEM observations. TEM also confirms that the thickness of the hexagonal nanoplates is approximately 40 nm (Fig. 1b). Magnified TEM images of an individual hexagonal nanoplate in the absence and presence of CDs are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively, revealing that they clearly exhibit similar shapes. The hexagonal nanoplates without CDs were easily decomposed during HRTEM observations; hence, the enlarged view did not reveal any lattice. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the individual hexagonal nanoplates without CDs contained diffuse rings (inset of Fig. 1c). Based on these findings we conclude that the hexagonal nanoplates could be composed of organic Ni compounds. When CDs are covered on the surface of the hexagonal nanoplates, clear diffraction rings were observed in the SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 1d), which are indexed well to the graphite structure. The obtained HRTEM image of one of the CDs reveals its crystalline nature with a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm, expected for the (100) diffraction facets of graphite carbon (Fig. 1e). In addition, the chemical compositions of S1 and S2 were measured by EDX (Fig. S7†). The EDX spectra prove that S1 and S2 only contain C, O and Ni atoms, whereas signals of Cu ought to arise from the copper grid. Fig. 1f shows the atomic percent of C, Ni and O determined from EDS spectra for S1 and S2. Due to the CDs covered on the hexagonal nanoplates, the C content of S1 is apparently higher than that of S2.

The chemical structures of the hexagonal nanoplates with and without CDs were further confirmed using XPS analysis (Fig. 2). Both samples possess three peaks at around 284, 532, and 855 eV, which are attributed to C 1s, O 1s and Ni 2p, respectively. The relative intensities of the C 1s and Ni 2p peaks in the XPS spectra of the hexagonal nanoplates with CDs and without CDs differ substantially. When the CDs are covered on the surface of hexagonal nanoplates, the relative intensity of the C 1s peak increases while that of the Ni 2p peak decreases. High-resolution XPS C 1s spectra of S2, CDs and S1 are depicted in Fig. 2c–e, respectively, all of which reveal the presence of sp2/sp3 carbons (CC/C–C), C–O groups and OC–OR groups.27 Notably, the content ratios between sp2/sp3 carbons and OC–OR groups obtained by comparing their peak areas are determined to be 0.495, 56.837, and 4.544 for S2, CDs and S1, respectively. Due to the CDs being covered on the surface of hexagonal nanoplates, the Ni 2p signals of S1 are much weaker than those of S2. Therefore, XPS results agree well with the TEM characterization. Further analysis of Ni 2p indicates that the peaks at 856.7 and 874.3 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni2+, and the peaks at 857.8 and 875.6 eV are assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni3+, respectively.25 This implies that the hexagonal nanoplates contain multivalent nickel.

XRD patterns of S1 and S2 are typical of those for Ni compounds and Ni oxides (Fig. 3a). Most of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to nickel formate (C2H2NiO4) with an unknown crystal system (PDF#14-0796) and hexagonal Ni2O3 with lattice constants of a = 0.461 nm and c = 5.61 nm (PDF#14-0481). The content of Ni2O3 is expected to be low because the intensities of its diffraction peaks are much lower than that of nickel formate. In addition, the impurity peaks, labelled by the dotted rectangle frame in Fig. 3a, may be assigned to nickel carbonate. The ultra-small size of CDs generally results in a broad peak at around 24° with weak intensity, and therefore it is difficult to distinguish it from the diffraction patterns of Ni compounds. Based on the analysis of TEM, XPS, and XRD patterns, the observed hexagonal nanoplates are composed of nickel formate accompanied by a small amount of Ni oxides. During liquid evaporation at 180 °C, some nickel formates may be decomposed, and the presence of H2O2 leads to the formation of Ni2O3. If all C elements are considered to be from nickel formate on the basis of the EDX result, the content of nickel formate is estimated as ca. 81% in hexagonal nanoplates. It is worth noting that our presented hexagonal nanoplates are difficult to be dissolved in water (Fig. S8†). Hence they belong to new Ni-based compounds, differing from the pure nickel formate.

The combination of CDs with hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds follows the typical electrostatic adsorption mechanism. When nickel formate levels reach supersaturation in solution under heating, the crystallization process occurs via nucleation and growth. Such reaction conditions may favor the growth of hexagonal nickel formate structures, leading to the formation of hexagonal nanoplates. As shown in Fig. 3b, the surface charges of hexagonal nanoplates (2.2 mV) and CDs (−10.4 mV) in the solution are positive and negative, respectively. Consequently, strong electrostatic forces are generated between them, which may give rise to their combination as illustrated in Fig. 3c. The combination of CDs with hexagonal nanoplates results in a zeta potential of −0.7 mV, and hence such structures become much more unstable than CDs and hexagonal nanoplates in the solution. This will favor the precipitation of CD coated hexagonal nanoplates within the solution ahead of the precipitation of either the hexagonal nanoplates or the CDs alone. In this way, each carbon dot is assembled on the surface of the hexagonal nanoplate.

Fig. 4a shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of S1, S2 and CD powders. Among the three samples, S1 exhibits the highest absorbance in the entire spectrum. S2, namely hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds display two strong absorption bands from 350 to 500 nm and from 600 to 800 nm. The CD powder shows a broad absorption over the entire wavelength range investigated. The combination of CDs with hexagonal nanoplates leads to an obvious increase in the UV-Vis absorption, especially at both absorption bands from 350 to 500 nm and from 600 to 800 nm. This suggests that the hexagonal nanoplates are helpful for improving the light absorbance.

It is well-known that NaBH4 is incapable of reducing 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the absence of a catalyst.19,28,29 The conversion process of 4-NP to 4-AP can be directly observed from its UV-Vis spectra at different time intervals. When a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution is added into 4-NP, the characteristic absorption peak (317 nm) will be shifted to 400 nm.28,29 After the addition of a catalyst, the reduction of 4-NP is initiated, which can be visualized by tracking the gradual decrease in intensity of the 400 nm absorption peak, which is accompanied by the appearance of a new peak at 297 nm attributed to 4-AP.28,29 This successive decrease in intensity of the 400 nm peak is generally considered for the kinetic investigation of the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP.29 The linear relationship of 4-NP concentration with absorbance intensity is given in Fig. S9.† The variation of 4-NP concentration can be easily monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy.
UV-Vis spectra of 4-NP reduction in the presence of S1, S2 and CD powders irradiated with visible light are shown in Fig. 4b–d, respectively. These results verify that the maximum absorbance peak at 400 nm gradually decreases as the reduction reaction time proceeds, simultaneously accompanied by the increase in intensity of the 297 nm peak. In the presence of S1, almost complete conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP was achieved within 10 min irradiation, whereas both S2 and CD powders exhibited less than 12% and 47% conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP after 60 min irradiation, respectively. To visually compare photocatalytic reduction activities of the three samples, the percentage of conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP can be estimated using the following equation,29 (1)where A0 is the initial absorbance, and At is the corresponding absorbance at irradiation time t. The calculated results given in Fig. 4e clearly illustrate that the largest conversion rate occurs for S1. On the other hand, compared to the amount of 4-NP, NaBH4 is in excess during the reaction process; thereby, the rate of the reduction reaction is independent of its concentration. According to the linear plot of ln(At/A0) vs. time, the reduction reaction conforms to pseudo first-order kinetics, and thus the photocatalytic reactivity can be confirmed by calculating the rate constants from the slope using the following equation:29 (2)
The rate constants (k) for the reduction reaction are obtained from the slope of ln(At/A0) vs. time (min), as shown in Fig. 4f. The rate constants of S1, S2 and CD powders are about 0.263, 0.003, and 0.009 min−1, respectively. Namely, the rate constant of S1 is 88 times greater than that of S2, and nearly 30 times higher than that of the CD powders. Therefore, the reactivity of the CD-covered hexagonal nanoplates for the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP is remarkably superior to that of either hexagonal nanoplates or CDs alone.
A more profound understanding of the sample's mechanism for converting 4-NP to 4-AP may be found through characterization via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nyquist plots have been widely used to investigate charge transfer efficiency at interfaces, which determines photocatalytic activities.7–9,20,30,31 A general EIS model is depicted in Fig. 5a, where two regimes are apparent in the EIS curve, namely a high frequency region (semicircular) and low frequency (linear) region, dominated by charge transfer and diffusion, respectively.31 An equivalent circuit was employed to simulate the EIS curve of the sample electrodes (inset of Fig. 5a), where R1 represents the electrolyte resistance, the contact resistance, and the intrinsic resistance of the substrate; R2 represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance; and Q is the constant phase element.
 Fig. 5  (a) The general model depicting EIS, the inset is the equivalent circuit; (b) EIS curves of sample S1; (c) EIS curves of samples S2 and CDs; (d) Mott–Schottky plots of S1, S2 and CDs; and (e) schematic of enhancing reduction efficiency of 4-NP. 
The measured EIS curves of samples S1 and S2 and CD powders are shown in Fig. 5b and c, and the charge transfer resistances are found to be approximately 11, 240 and 145 Ω, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the charge transfer resistance of S1 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of S2 and CDs, suggesting that the separation and transfer rates of photogenerated charges are remarkably enhanced through the interfacial interaction between CDs and hexagonal nanoplates. Mott–Schottky (MS) results of S1, S2 and CDs exhibit positive slopes (Fig. 5d), indicating that the three samples are n-type semiconductors, i.e. the electron is the main charge carrier for them. Based on the intersection point of the potential and linear potential curve, the flat band potentials are approximately −1.07, −0.95 and −1.07 (V vs. Ag/AgCl) for S1, S2 and CDs, respectively. Since the conduction band is close to the flat band potential, the electrons at the band levels of S1, S2 and CDs can definitely reduce 4-NP to 4-AP in contrast with their conversion potential, −0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was obtained by cyclic voltammetry measurements (ESI, Fig. S10†). These results imply that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of S1 compared with S2 and CDs may be attributed to the higher separation and transfer efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers.
Although the as-prepared hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds are not a single phase based on the above results and discussion, their combination with CDs through electrostatic adsorption dramatically enhances visible light absorption or solar energy capture. Importantly, the resultant interfaces between the hexagonal nanoplate of Ni-based compounds and CDs could form an electrostatic field as shown in Fig. 5e. This electrostatic field is able to separate photoexcited electrons and holes, and accelerate electron migration to the surface of the hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds. This case has been supported by the above EIS results. Moreover, the positively charged hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds (Fig. 3b) are more prone to adsorbing negatively charged 4-NP molecules.32 Their superficial electrons at an energy level of −1.07 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) are energetically favorable for participating in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP (−0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl) to 4-AP. Simultaneously, the holes are migrated to the CD surface accompanying with energy release. As a result, the heterostructures of the hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds and CDs present higher catalytic activities.
According to the above proposition, the CDs offer photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic reactions while the hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds are mainly used to facilitate separation of the electron–hole pairs and carrier migration to the surface. Thus, the CDs should act as electron donors in this system. To confirm this, the quenching effect of photoluminescence (PL) intensity by the known electron acceptor 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and electron donor N,N-diethylaniline (DEA) was measured to explore the electron accepting and donating capabilities of the used CDs based on the previously reported method.6 As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL intensity of CDs is significantly quenched when adding 0.2 mM of DNT, whereas there is a very small reduction of their PL intensity after adding DEA, even if its concentration is five times higher than that of DNT. Moreover, Fig. 6b presents the luminescence decays of the CDs in the absence of quenchers and in the presence of 0.2 mM DNT and 1 mM DEA. The average lifetime of CDs is 5.124 ns and can be deconvoluted with two components: 2.968 ns (ca. 53.367%), and 7.591 ns (ca. 46.633%). After addition of 0.2 mM of DNT, the lifetime decreases to 2.892 ns, whose decay time can also be fitted into two components: 1.97 (ca. 60.536%) and 4.305 ns (ca. 39.464%). The striking PL quenching and reduced lifetime indicate the high efficiency of the underlying electron transfer in this system. Nevertheless, the lifetime of CDs is almost unchanged after addition of 1 mM of DEA. All of the above results have verified that photoexcited CDs used in the present work are excellent electron donors rather than electron acceptors.

In any catalytic process, one of the key steps is the adsorption of the reactant molecules on the surface of the catalyst. Our previous work has demonstrated that the zeta potential of 4-NP is negative.32 From Fig. 3b, it can be deduced that the positively charged hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds are better for adsorbing 4-NP molecules, then allowing catalytic reactions to proceed more rapidly. The experimental results depicting adsorption phenomena are given in Fig. 6c. The adsorption amount of 4-NP on the surface of S1 (0.33 mg mL−1) is increased with both time and initial concentrations of 4-NP. After it reaches a maximum value of adsorption at the given concentration of 4-NP, the adsorption remains constant with shaking time. Hence, the extent of adsorption depends on the initial concentrations of 4-NP and time. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of S1 at the given temperature is provided in Fig. 6d. It can be seen that the saturated adsorption weight of S1 is 5.88 μg mg−1 at 30 °C. These results indicate that 4-NP can be adsorbed onto the surface of S1 to react. By the reaction of borohydride ions with the surface of S1, the formed surface-hydrogen species33 and the surface photogenerated electrons transferred from CDs induce the reduction of 4-NP adsorbed onto the surface of S1.
4. Conclusions
We have developed a facile, scalable method for preparing a hybrid photocatalyst combining CDs and hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds. The resultant heterostructure not only improves visible light absorption, but also results in enhanced photocatalytic activity for the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP when compared to CDs or hexagonal nanoplates of Ni-based compounds alone. Besides its energy band alignment with the reduction potential of 4-NP to 4-AP, our investigation also demonstrates that this heterostructure possesses much lower charge transfer resistance and electrostatic adsorption-induced inner field at interfaces; thereby, it can efficiently separate photoexcited charge carriers and facilitate their migration to the surface, resulting in excellent photocatalytic performance. Given the ease and scalability of their production, in addition to the low cost of the starting materials, the approach herein is highly amenable for commercial photocatalytic applications. We expect that the simple and highly effective strategy adopted here could be employed for the design of new photocatalytic reduction nanostructures with improved solar energy capture and conversion.
