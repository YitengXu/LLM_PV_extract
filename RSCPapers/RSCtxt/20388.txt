    , Accepted 24th July 2017First published on 24th July 2017AbstractSequential series multijunction dye-sensitized solar cells (SSM-DSCs), which are mechanically stacked single illuminated area DSC devices wired in series, are reported to have exceptionally high photovoltages (Voc) ranging from 1.9–4.7 V from 2–5 stacked subcells. The use of multiple photoactive films under one area within the SSM-DSC framework is made possible by fine-tuning the thickness of TiO2 in each device and by judicious dye selection to allow for excellent light distribution among the films, termed as “photon management”. The SSM-DSC approach allows for incorporation of materials designed to use the maximal potential energy of photons in each region of the solar spectrum. Importantly, SSM-DSCs were observed to maintain high Voc under low-light conditions, rendering these systems very attractive for indoor applications. Additionally, an SSM-DSC was found to have a solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 2% (2.7% including H2 production) for the reduction of CO2 to CO with IrO2 and Au2O3 electrocatalysts, without an external bias.

Broader context
Powering many electrochemical processes and charging batteries directly from sunlight with limited area systems is a challenge for photovoltaics. Most commonly, photovoltaics have concentrated on developing systems that incorporate the maximal number of photons regardless of the photon energy difference in each region of the solar spectrum. We have set forward an approach where a sustainable, non-toxic solar cell technology (dye-sensitized solar cells) can be configured in a sequential series multijunction-DSC (SSM-DSC) system to give photovoltages reaching 4.7 V from a single illuminated area device through careful photon management. SSM-DSCs offer an attractive, easily processable method for powering higher voltage applications even under low light conditions. As an example, both water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction/water oxidation catalytic systems were powered with non-biased DSCs for the first time with up to 3% solar-to-fuel efficiencies. The initial system being set forward in this paper capitalizes on the high potential energy of early spectral photons to generate high-voltage SSM-DSC devices, which utilize only photons from 400–700 nm. This approach is complementary to many inorganic solar cell technologies focusing on narrow band-gap materials and offers a method for enhancing the voltage output of these systems with single area illumination.

Global energy demand is steadily increasing. Sustainable fossil fuel-free pathways to electricity and fuel production such as conversion of water to H2 and CO2 to carbon fuels with only O2 as a byproduct are highly desirable.1–3 Solar energy is the most abundant energy source; however, energy conversion and storage need to be increased in efficiency for practical applications.3,4 One strategy for increasing solar cell power conversion efficiencies is by using photons of different potential energies in separate subcells with photon distribution and conversion per subcell being carefully controlled (Fig. 1). Using high potential energy photons to generate large open-circuit voltages (Voc) from front subcells in sequential solar cell systems is highly desirable to maximize the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of multijunction solar cell devices. Additionally, devices generating high photovoltages from a single illuminated area are desirable for solar-to-fuel conversion with electrocatalysts and battery charging applications with limited areas.5–12

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising in terms of cost, stability, commercial viability and environmental impact when compared with many solar cell technologies. Additionally, DSCs are an exceptionally attractive solar cell technology for converting high potential energy photons efficiently with the highest single DSC cell giving a Voc value of 1.4 V.13,14 Traditionally, research efforts for DSCs have targeted achieving high efficiency single-junction devices by balancing photocurrent and Voc. However, single cell devices convert all absorbed photons regardless of potential energy to the same voltage resulting in significant energetic waste from high-energy solar spectrum photons. Series multijunction DSCs (SM-DSCs, 2 subcells) combined with low energy photon utilizing solar cells such as GaAs or silicon offer device architectures to circumvent this potential energy loss (Fig. 1).15–28
This strategy relies on different wavelength ranges of light absorbing materials to divide up the solar spectrum, and DSCs with these device architectures have not demonstrated a photovoltage in excess of 2.0 V from a single illuminated area device to date to the best of our knowledge. SM-DSC devices have so far been limited to two subcell (double junction) systems presumably because efficient photon conversion is expected to diminish dramatically with typical device active layer designs.22,24–26 Herein we demonstrate that through (1) the judicious control of electrode film thickness, (2) proper dye selection, (3) careful redox shuttle selection, and (4) the addition of a film surface protection technique, sequential SM-DSCs or SSM-DSCs (mechanically stacked with a single illuminated area) can reach record high Voc values of 4.7 V from a 5-device system with an overall PCE of 4% (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, the photovoltage is obtained with only the use of early photons (400–700 nm) and metal-free sensitizers D35 and Y123 (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) with a low energy redox shuttle ([Co(bpy-pz)2]+3/+2).13,29–36
DSCs operate by the photoexcitation of a dye, which then transfers an electron from the excited state to TiO2. The electron then traverses an external circuit before being collected at a counter electrode and returning to the oxidized dye. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) is calculated through the equation: PCE = (Voc × Jsc × FF)/Io, where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor and Io is the incident light intensity. The redox shuttle should only be slightly higher in energy than the ground-state energy of the dye for a minimal loss of photovoltage. First, individual subcells were optimized. The open-circuit voltage of D35/[Co(bpy-pz)2]+3/+2 single cell DSC devices is measured at 1000 mV with a PCE of 5.9% (Fig. S3 and Table S3, ESI†).16,31 The addition of an insulating capping layer (PFTS: perfluorooctyltrimethylsilane) used to slow the recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the redox shuttles gives Voc values of up to 1040 mV (PCE of 6.8%, Table S3 entries 1 and 2).37 The device exhibits an improved PCE through an increase in both Voc and Jsc. An increase in electron lifetime in TiO2 (Fig. S5, ESI†) is observed with PFTS treatment indicating slower recombination kinetics.32,37–41 No shift in the conduction band of TiO2 was observed based on charge-extraction from open-circuit conditions as a function of light intensity indicating that the gain in voltage is due to slowing recombination losses (Fig. S5, ESI†).37,42,43 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a fluorinated self-assembled monolayer (FSAM) treatment such as PFTS has been evaluated with Co+3/+2 redox systems. Y123 based-devices show a lower performance as a result of apparent dye desorption from the TiO2 surface with PFTS treatment (Table S3, ESI†). Only D35 devices in the remaining studies employ PFTS treatment.
Careful control of device thicknesses for each electrode in the SSM-DSC system is used to balance the photon distribution to each subcell by strategically allowing light to pass through the first electrode. Judicious “photon management” strategies for SSM-DSC devices are critical for high performances because subcells wired in series are limited by the lowest current subcell with the maximal current being proportional to the number of photons absorbed by a subcell. Therefore, the TiO2 film active layer thickness for the front subcells was evaluated between 0.8 and 2.2 μm without a scattering layer (Fig. S3 and Table S3 entries 7–10, ESI†).22,24Jsc values ranging from 2.8 to 7.1 mA cm−2 are obtained with D35 through film thickness control with IPCE peak values ranging from 38 to 75% (Fig. S3, ESI†). In a similar fashion, the Jsc of Y123 based devices could be modulated between 5.2 and 7.5 mA cm−2 by changing the film thickness (Fig. S3 and Table S3 entries 11–12, ESI†).
With a method for tuning device photocurrents in hand, SSM-DSC devices with 2–5 subcells were constructed (Fig. 2 and Table 1) by the judicious selection of subcell thicknesses. Ideally, irradiation should be equally distributed among the subcells according to the photon flux, based on the photon potential energy, and allow minimal transmitted photons through the SSM-DSC system. Thus, the front subcell was varied depending on the total number of subcells in the SSM-DSC to ensure the maximal efficiency. To evaluate the equal distribution of photons, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. S6, ESI†) and IV measurements (Tables S6–S8, ESI†) are made for each individual cell after being configured in an SSM-DSC system. For a two-subcell SSM-DSC with D35/D35, a record high Voc is obtained at 1.97 V with a PCE of 6.9% (Table 1 entry 1 and Fig. 2). A D35/Y123 SSM-DSC using a broader absorbing second dye led to a Voc of 1.92 V and a higher PCE of 7.1% (Fig. 2 and Table 1 entry 2). A loss of FF is observed for the D35/Y123 SSM-DSC when compared to the D35/D35 system (0.71 vs. 0.62). This loss is due to a mismatch of current through the two devices, which highlights the necessity of careful photon management. Adding a third subcell (D35/D35/Y123) further increased the device photovoltage to 2.87 V with a PCE of 6.4%. Changing the center subcell to Y123 led to a comparable Voc of 2.81 V with a PCE of 6.4%; however, a significant increase in the FF was observed for the D35/Y123/Y123 system at 0.61 (from 0.55) due to a better matching of subcell Jsc values. In this configuration, the third cell was found to be current limiting via IV and IPCE measurements, which suggest that the initial photon absorbing subcells collect a disproportionate number of photons (Table 1 entries 4–6 and Fig. S6, S7, ESI†). Fig. S6 (ESI†) compares the IPCE for subcells in an SSM-DSC device with a combined IPCE of the three subcells showing a peak of ∼60% near 600 nm. Changing the redox shuttle system from [Co(bpy-pz)2]+3/+2 to [Co(bpy)3]+3/+2 for the third cell alone gave a significant increase in current at the third subcell leading to an SSM-DSC with a Voc of 2.67 V and a PCE of 7.0%. To further increase the current at the back cell, a broader absorbing Ru-sensitizer was selected (HD-2-mono37) with I−/I3− as the redox shuttle system (Fig. S1, ESI†).44 A D35/Y123/HD-2-mono SSM-DSC system gives a high PCE of 7.7% with a Voc of 2.62 V. Both the D35/Y123/Y123 and D35/Y123/HD-2-mono devices gave excellent fill factors (0.72 and 0.74, respectively) owing to very well balanced currents through all three devices as shown by the changes in IV and IPCE curves (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).

SSM-DSC systems with 4 and 5 subcells were constructed to evaluate the effects on photovoltage with increasing subcell number (Fig. 2 and Table 1 entries 7–9). A 4-subcell SSM-DSC system with D35/D35/Y123/Y123 gave a Voc of 3.72 V with a PCE of 5.8%. The PCE value was similar to the 3-subcell system with these dyes. Two 5-subcell systems were constructed with the same first four subcells and varying the final subcell: D35/D35/Y123/Y123/Y123 or HD-2-mono. These devices gave Voc values of 4.67 V and 4.38 V respectively with similar overall PCE values at 4.3 and 4.4%. To the best of our knowledge, this is a record demonstration of photovoltage in a dye-sensitized solar cell system from a single illuminated area.
Intriguingly, the SSM-DSC system maintains high photovoltages even under low light conditions at 3.99 V at 10% Sun intensity for a PCE of 7.0% (Fig. S9 and Table S11, ESI†). Thus the SSM-DSC system is highly attractive for indoor light-to-electric applications requiring high voltages such as a lithium ion battery charging at ∼3.7–4.0 V.28 Finally, two SSM-DSC systems were connected in series with two side-by-side illuminated areas to further test the limits of this approach. Two sets of 4-subcell SSM-DSC systems wired in series with side-by-side illumination give an overall Voc of 7.52 V with a PCE of 4.4% (Fig. 2 and Table 1 entry 10). In a similar experiment, combining 4- and 5-subcell SSM-DSC systems led to a Voc of 8.55 V and a PCE of 4.1% (Fig. 2 and Table 1 entry 11). This represents the highest voltage obtained with a DSC device with a double illuminated area to the best of our knowledge.
Having shown tunable photovoltage values based on subcell count and material selection in SSM-DSCs, intriguing applications with demanding conditions were evaluated. An interesting approach for solar-to-fuel conversion is a photovoltaic powered-electrochemical cell (PV-EC) system that operates without external bias.8,10,45–48 Ideally, the maximum power point of the PV system would intersect with the EC system IV curve at a point where the IV curve is near vertical. Excess voltage from the PV device beyond this intersection is potential energy loss. The SSM-DSC system outlined above offers a readily tunable device configuration where the PV device voltage can be selected for minimal potential energy loss.
Two EC systems with low overpotentials for electrocatalysis were selected to demonstrate the utility of SSM-DSC systems as the PV component of PV-EC systems. Both EC systems utilize an IrO2 heterogeneous surface catalyst to drive the electrocatalytic half reaction: 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2. The protons and electrons were used to either reduce CO2 to CO or to generate H2 based on electrode choice. Au2O3 is known to drive a low overpotential and selective aqueous CO2 reduction (Fig. S10, ESI†).49 The IrO2/Au2O3 EC system operates with a maximum current around 1.8–1.9 V in basified water where the standard reduction potential of CO2 is 1.43 V. Thus, a 3-subcell SSM-DSC system can power the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous media with no external bias (see Fig. S14 for a schematic and Fig. S17 for an energy-level diagram, ESI†).49 The D35/Y123/Y123 Co(bpy)3+3/+2 SSM-DSC device was selected as the maximum power point is at ∼2.35 V. This allows for minimal voltage loss and maximal current through the PV-EC system. An overall efficiency for CO production (ηco) of 2% was calculated, with a solar-to-fuel efficiency of 2.7% when H2 produced is accounted for using the equation: ηco = (Jop × E(CO2/CO) × FE)/Io, where Jop is the operating current density, E(CO2/CO) is the thermodynamic free energy (1.43 V for this EC), FE is the Faradaic efficiency, and Io is the incident solar power density (Fig. 3). This represents the only DSC EC system driven with simulated sunlight and water as the electron source for the solar-to-CO conversion of CO2 with no external bias. The diminishment of the Jop overtime was found to be due to the deterioration of the performance of only the front cell in the SSM-DSC system (Fig. S11, S12 and Table S12, ESI†). This loss in performance over time for the front device was found to be fully circumvented through the use of a 385 nm UV cut-off filter (Fig. S13, ESI†).50

To demonstrate the unbiased splitting of water to O2 and H2, a PV-EC system using IrO2 for water oxidation and Pt for proton reduction was employed with the same three subcell system used for CO2 reduction. The EC IrO2/Pt system is known to operate at ∼1.7 V with high current in basic solutions.51 A solar-to-fuel efficiency of 3% was observed for the PV-EC system (Fig. S15–17, ESI†) with the thermodynamic free energy taken as 1.23 V. Additionally, the charge versus time plot is nearly linear for the measured time period (Fig. S19, ESI†). In a dramatic display of the SSM-DSC device stability, a 3-subcell SSM-DSC device was constructed with an IrO2-covered titanium electrode attached at the SSM-DSC cathode and a platinum wire connected to the SSM-DSC photoanode (images and schematics: Fig. S15, ESI†). This device was fully submerged in an aqueous solution and irradiated with a solar simulator in a beaker open to air. A flow of O2 and H2 can be observed at the electrodes via the video supplied as the ESI.† This stands in stark contrast to other solar cell technologies that require precautions such as argon chambers.8 Importantly, this device qualitatively produced H2 for multiple days.
Conclusions
In conclusion, single illuminated area SSM-DSCs with >2 subcells were analyzed for the first time. The individual subcells were optimized for a balance of light transmission and absorption through TiO2 film thickness to achieve the highest possible Voc values per unit area with an SSM-DSC device. This novel approach gave Voc values as high as ∼4.7 V for a single illuminated area device connected in series with a PCE of ∼4.4%. This remarkable Voc was further enhanced by series connection of two SSM-DSC devices irradiated side-by-side, which lead to an exceptionally high Voc value of 8.5 V, a Jsc of 1.9 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.25% and a PCE of 4%. Considering the ease of manufacture, availability of already well-studied materials, simplicity of the architecture and improved stability, this seminal report on SSM-DSC devices will likely spark a number of additional investigations geared at solar-to-fuel devices and portable-energy charging systems using a low area solar cell. As a set of future directions, SSM-DSCs are being investigated which apply efficient red photon harvesting DSC sensitizers (>750 nm), in a multijunction with inorganic PVs (silicon, GaAs, etc.), which minimize the glass-related transmission losses, and which incorporate redox shuttles with theoretical Voc values greater than 1.5 V for a single cell.

Broader context
Powering many electrochemical processes and charging batteries directly from sunlight with limited area systems is a challenge for photovoltaics. Most commonly, photovoltaics have concentrated on developing systems that incorporate the maximal number of photons regardless of the photon energy difference in each region of the solar spectrum. We have set forward an approach where a sustainable, non-toxic solar cell technology (dye-sensitized solar cells) can be configured in a sequential series multijunction-DSC (SSM-DSC) system to give photovoltages reaching 4.7 V from a single illuminated area device through careful photon management. SSM-DSCs offer an attractive, easily processable method for powering higher voltage applications even under low light conditions. As an example, both water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction/water oxidation catalytic systems were powered with non-biased DSCs for the first time with up to 3% solar-to-fuel efficiencies. The initial system being set forward in this paper capitalizes on the high potential energy of early spectral photons to generate high-voltage SSM-DSC devices, which utilize only photons from 400–700 nm. This approach is complementary to many inorganic solar cell technologies focusing on narrow band-gap materials and offers a method for enhancing the voltage output of these systems with single area illumination.
