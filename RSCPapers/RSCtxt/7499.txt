    AbstractThis chapter provides a digest of the literature reported during 2009 concerning the halogens and compounds containing these elements in their positive oxidation states. Its intent is to highlight discovery and provide insight into current research trends.
Highlights
Highlights of the 2009 literature concerning the halogens include the synthesis of an inorganic model for the starch-iodine complex with a central channel bearing polyiodide species50 and the preparation of three new oligomeric iodanes from the treatment of PhI(OAc)2 with sodium bisulfate in aqueous acid.72
Elemental halogens
Although fluorine is the most abundant halogen in nature its unique properties render it biologically unavailable. Causing marked effects on the electronic properties of physiologically active compounds, the incorporation of fluorine into pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals is a vibrant and active area of research. The recent application of 19F NMR techniques for the study of metabolism, structure and binding interactions has been the focus of a recent review.1 Through use of a clever CT-HCCF-COSY pulse sequence the assignment of 19F NMR resonances in a mutagenesis-free approach has been demonstrated on Ca2+-bound 13C, 15N 3-fluoro-L-tyrosine-enriched calmodulin (CaM) from Xenopous laevis.2 The broad application of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) has led to their presence as persistent environmental pollutants. In a detailed study the 19F NMR parameters for CnF2n+1COOH (n = 6–8) PFCAs were determined using B3LYP-GIAO/6-31++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations in conjunction with natural bond order analysis of chemical shifts.3 Full geometry optimizations for the linear n-alkane (C6–C27) PFCAs indicated that all have helical structures with the helical angle increasing slightly with increasing chain length. A bispherical fluorocarbon molecule, denoted as 19FIT (19F imaging tracer), has now been prepared as a rapidly excreted imaging tracer for 19F MRI as an alternative to perfluorocarbon agents which may persist within the organs for months.4
Use of a recently introduced recoupling method, the sandwiched PI pulse (SPIP) sequence, has been applied to the observation of the spatial proximity of 19F nuclei in solid-state fluoroaluminates at ultra-fast magic angle spinning.5 The solid-state NMR literature for the 35/37Cl, 79/81Br, and 127I nuclides has been summarily reviewed through 2008; the advent of ultrahigh-field solid-state NMR spectrometers (B0 ≥ 18.8 T) has increased the number of investigations on these quadrupolar nuclei.6
The separation of uranium isotopes for nuclear power generation has accumulated 1.7 million tons of depleted uranium hexafluoride, DUF6. Given the environmental and security concerns over its storage, a recent article critically discusses the methods by which the material be reconverted to uranium oxides and either HF or high value fluorine based reagents such as COF2, WF6, MoF6, PF5, SF4, SiF4 or SF6.7 Fluorination methods, including nucleophilic fluorination, electrophilic fluorination and trifluoromethylation using continuous-flow microreactors are currently under development. Compared to batch methods, they offer automation and reaction optimization with efficiency gains through generation of less waste, lower solvent use and reduced exposure to reactive intermediates.8
While the addition of Cl2 and Br2 to alkenes and alkynes is a ‘classic’ reaction, the addition of F2 has proved more challenging. It has now been demonstrated that arylacetylenes can be converted to tetrafluoroethane derivatives using a dilute mixture of F2 (3–10% in N2) bubbled through a solution of the arylacetylene at −78 °C.9 Diluted F2 has also found application in the fluorination of acyclic and cyclic β-ketoesters in conjunction with a Lewis-acid catalyst and chiral ligand system with the goal of achieving enantioselective fluorination.10 Moreover, the first quaternary nitride-fluoride to be reported, Ce2MnN3F2−δ, has been synthesised via fluorination of the ternary nitride Ce2MnN3 with 10% F2/N2 at 95–115 °C.11 10% F2/N2 has also found application as an organocatalyst for an efficient and mild protocol for the stereoselective preparation of structurally diverse racemic N-aryl and N–H aziridines.12 Given the high reactivity and difficulty in handling elemental fluorine, the use of electrophilic fluorination reagents such as Selectfluor® (1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis-(tetrafluoroborate)) and NFSi (N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide) continues to receive the majority of focus in organic synthesis. For example, a series of E- and Z-allyl silanes underwent fluoro-cyclization to afford cis- and trans-fluorinated tetrahydrofurans using NFSi.13 The authors also report the first instance of an asymmetric fluorocyclization using a reagent prepared in situ from Selectfluor® in conjunction with a cinchona alkaloid. Selectfluor® is pivotal in the conversion of Au(I) into Au(III) during the first Au-catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling of propargylic acetates and arylboronic acids to afford α-arylenones.14 NFSi was successfully employed for the preparation of fluorinated flavanones through a one-pot Knoevenagel condensation/Michael addition/electrophilic fluorination sequence.15 The reactions demonstrated remarkable diastereoselectivity given the constrained relationship within the reactive enolate intermediate towards fluorination with NFSi.
The first preparation of arylated 3-fluoropyrroles bearing an aldehyde or alkoxymethyl function at the C-5 position has been developed using Selectfluor®.16 This synthesis appears to be a general route to 3-fluoropyrroles considered important building blocks for the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Aryl allylic fluorides were synthesized from arylalkenes in good yields by using Selectfluor® in DMF.17 Lastly, Selectfluor® was utilized to construct the difluorocyclopentene moiety of (±)-4′-ethynyl-5′,5′-difluoro-2′,3′-dehydro-3′-deoxy-carbocyclic thymidine, an analogue of the promising anti-HIV agent Ed4T.18
The potential energy curve of F2 in the ground electronic state 1Σ+g has now been determined and analyzed in the region from 2.8 to 8 Å as the sum of the uncorrelated dissociating wave function and the correlation energy contribution.19 The potential energy curve has a barrier at about 4 Å of 40 μhartree arising from the competition between the attractive London dispersion interaction and the repulsive coaxial quadrupole alignments in the ground state. In previous investigations this barrier remained unexplained or regarded as experimental error. The dynamics of the F2 reaction with propene was determined experimentally and using CCSD(T) calculations.20 The calculations overestimate the reaction barrier heights systematically as the experimentally determined barrier of 2.4 ± 0.3 kcal/mol is up to 2.8 kcal/mol lower than the computational results. Methyl substitution efficiently reduces the reaction barrier for the F2 + propene reaction compared to F2 + ethylene by 5.5 ± 0.5 kcal/mol.
The majority of work concerning elemental chlorine published in 2009 is focused on its physical chemistry, especially in relation to the environment. Volatile vinyl ethers are replacing many industrial solvents to reduce negative health effects. The kinetics of their photochemical oxidation with chlorine atoms has now been studied using a Pyrex tube flow reactor using Cl atoms produced by microwave discharge of Cl2 diluted in He.21 Similarly, the temperature dependence of the gas-phase reaction of Cl atoms with propene and 1-butene was studied by FTIR within the range of ambient temperatures (285 < T < 313 K).22 The combustion of coal for electrical production is the greatest anthropogenic source of mercury emissions in the atmosphere. Calculations at the B3LYP/RCEP60 VDZ level of theory have recently been used to study the chlorine oxidation of mercury as a model for mercury speciation in the quench zone of flue gases.23 High-resolution electron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations have been used to study the Auger decay processes of the Cl 2p ionized states in Cl2 leading to reassignment of the normal L2,3VV Auger decay spectrum.24 The theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the L2,3VV Auger electron spectrum of Cl2 obtained after selective Cl 2p−13/2 photoionization of the chlorine molecule. The mechanism, kinetics, and thermochemistry for the gas-phase reaction between pyridine and atomic chlorine has been investigated using hybrid density functional model BB1K, BHandHLYP, and the ab initio MP2 method.25 At lower temperature, the primary reaction channel is addition of Cl to the pyridine N-atom forming an adduct (C5H5N–Cl) through a weak N–Cl bond as the ΔrG values for reactions with the ring hydrogens remains positive. At higher temperatures the main channel becomes abstraction of an ortho-hydrogen.
Elemental bromine has also seen greater physical and theoretical focus in the recent literature. The 6-311G standard basis set used in electronic structure calculations for bromine possesses a contraction error of 25.6 kcal/mol−1 for Br(2P), which is appreciably higher than the contraction errors of the other five p-block elements of the fourth period. A substantial improvement in this basis set has been reported (r-6-311G) which reduces the contraction error to 9.5 kcal/mol comparable to the other fourth row p-block elements.26 The AM1* semiempirical molecular orbital technique now includes parameters for bromine and iodine.27 This technique has the advantage of using d-orbitals as polarization functions in the basis set. The investigators provided a detailed test of these new parameters for the calculation of ΔHof, ionization potentials, dipole moments and geometries for a number of bromine and iodine compounds. Using the relative rate method, the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients for the reactions of atomic Br2 with toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydropyran were measured over the range of 295 to 362 K.28 Based on their results the authors suggest that differences in the entropy of activation may be just as important as the enthalpy of activation to explain variations in reactivity. It is has been demonstrated that 79Br NMR spectroscopy may be a practical tool for kinetic analysis.29 Although quadrupolar nuclei are generally harder to study due to their dominant quadrupolar relaxation characteristics, line broadening is less of an issue in simple spectra where only one species is observed. Rate constants determined by 79Br NMR for several ‘classic’ reactions where bromide ions were produced compared favorably with those obtained by other means.
As opposed to chlorine and bromine, iodine continues to find novel and elegant applications in synthetic methodology. Highlights of the past year seem to focus on the use of I2 in place of transition-metal or elaborate non-metal catalysts as illustrated through the following examples. Medicinally interesting triarylmethanes can efficiently be synthesized by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of arenes with arylaldehydes in the presence of 10 mol% I2 under ambient conditions in toluene.30 As opposed to previous metal or Lewis acid catalyzed methods, the reaction scope extends to the use of enolizable aliphatic aldehydes for the preparation of diarylalkanes. It has been shown that I2 promotes a ring-closing alkene iodoamination reaction of homochiral unsaturated β-amino esters containing a cis-dioxolane unit.31 Subsequent N-debenzylation provides an elegant and stereoselective route to iodomethyl pyrrolidines known to be potent glycosidase inhibitors. I2 has been shown to be an alternative to transition-metals in the catalytic homocoupling of arylboronic acids in PEG-400 under aerobic conditions.32 A perplexing problem arises from the fact that iodine is only present in catalytic amounts leaving the open question of the identity of the stoichiometric oxidant. The investigators propose that iodine is oxidized by molecular oxygen in the PEG-400 solvent. Arylalkenes undergo hydroamidation using sulfonamides in toluene under reflux to afford N-tosyl or N-mesyl secondary amines.33 The I2-pyridine-tert-butylhydroperoxide system provides an alternative to transition metals for the oxidation of benzylic methylenes to ketones and primary amines to nitriles under virtually solvent-free conditions.34 Similarly, direct oxidative conversion of alkyl or aryl halides into nitriles with I2 and 1,3-diiodo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin in aq. ammonia avoids the use of strong metal-based oxidants.35
Other contributions to the chemistry of I2 in the preceding year include the C3-benzylation of 4-hydroxycoumarins using secondary benzyl alcohols in presence of 10 mol% I2 in CH3NO2 at 50 °C.36 This general method was applied to the one-pot preparation of the pyranocoumarin core central to many bioactive compounds. A convenient entry into indoloquinoline alkaloids such as cryptotackieine utilizes a one-pot imination of indole-3-carboxyaldehyde with aryl amines followed by an I2 catalyzed annulation.37 Treatment of N-thioacyl-1-(2-pyridyl)-1,2-aminoalcohols with I2 and pyridine in THF leads to the formation of bis(1-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridyl)arylmethanes under mild conditions.38 A previous mechanistic investigation into the preparation of CF3I from the reaction of CHF3 and I2via CF2 carbene has led to a relatively low temperature synthesis of CF3I.39 Structurally strained fluorocarbons are better thermal sources of CF2 carbene and thus CF3I can be synthesized by the vapor-phase catalytic reaction between hexafluoropropylene oxide with I2 in the presence of KF on activated charcoal at 200 °C.
Diode laser based frequency-modulated absorption spectroscopy has been used to probe the photolysis of molecular iodine at 193 and 248 nm.40 This technique allows the observation of the initial electronic transition as well as the velocity of the fragments. Based on the serendipitous discovery that I2 and pyridine react within a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) matrix to afford highly polar N-iodopyridinium polyiodides (pyI+, I+x) rather than the expected pyridine-I2 complex, a thorough investigation using linear dichroism Fourier transform infrared (LD-FTIR) spectroscopy was undertaken.41 Although the details of the structure are still unknown the authors conclude from the sharpness of the observed IR bands of the complex that it must have one dominant, characteristic structure. The dynamics of the I2-benzene complex molecule in both ground and excited electronic states has now been investigated using UV-vis absorption, FTIR, resonance Raman, and femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (fs-CARS) in a solid Kr-matrix.42 The authors purport that controlling the charge transfer reaction of this complex is possible through a fs-CARS scheme, although difficult to achieve due to dephasing of the electronic states.
A substantive review of the halogenation of organic compounds in ionic liquids has been published.43 Given the unique properties that can be engineered into these designer solvents many halogenation reactions may be ‘rediscovered’ though the enhanced tunability of reaction variables possible in these systems. An engaging structural perspective on enzymatic halogenation covers recent investigations concerning the synergism between structure and mechanism in the five known classes of natural halogenases.44 The authors suggest that thorough study of the active site architecture and halide binding sites will benefit our understanding of small molecule synthesis especially with regards to reaction specificity.
Interhalogens and polyhalides
A challenge for uranium enrichment schemes is the removal of rare-earth elements (REE) from enriched UO2. BrF3 has been demonstrated to be effective for the separation and extraction of REE impurities from uranium at laboratory scale.45 The industrial application of halogen fluorides for the fluorination of uranium compounds necessitates a thorough understanding of the phase equilibria of these systems. Various binary and ternary UF6-halogen fluoride systems were studied using methods of differential-thermal and visual-polythermal analyses to study the liquid–solid phase equilibria and static methods to determine the liquid–vapour phase equilibria.46 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) that utilize the redox mediator I−/I3− couple can provide remarkable solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies (η) of 12% but suffer from a mismatch between the I−/I3− redox potential and that of the dye resulting in energy loss incurred during dye regeneration. Promising DSCs cells based on two novel carbazole dyes and a Br−/Br3− redox mediator have been shown to substantially reduce this energy loss but only with η = 3–5%.47 A recent account discusses the I−/I3− redox couple with emphasis on the mechanism and kinetics governing DSCs, loss mechanisms as well as alternative redox couples including Br−/Br3−.48
The remarkable single crystal X-ray structure of the [(CH3CN)2I]+ cation in [(CH3CN)2I][AsF6] has now been reported.49 Prepared by the reaction of [I3][AsF6] with CH3CN in liquid SO2, it is the first structurally characterized example of an [I]+ cation and one of only a few examples described chemically. In the crystalline state the [(CH3CN)2I]+ cation is entirely linear and centrosymmetric about the iodine atom with I-N distances of 2.198(3) Å. The cubic unit cell (Pa (#205)) consists of the arsenic atoms of [AsF6]− arranged in cubic close-packing and the iodine atoms of [(CH3CN)2I]+ distributed over the octahedral gaps, rather similar to simple NaCl.
Although the starch-iodine indicator is familiar to every chemist, the exact structural features of this complex are unknown. The unique blue–black chromophore is purported to consist of modulated I5, I3 and I2 units within the 5 Å central cavity of the left-handed helical structure of amylose with the average I⋯I distances between polyiodide units (3.1 Å) being less than the van der Waal radii. A captivating inorganic model for the starch-iodine complex {(C4H12N2)2[CuII4](I2)}n has now been prepared from comproportionation of CuIIIO and Cu0 in a mixture of HI, I2 and piperazine under hydrothermal conditions.50 The helical arrangement of tetraiodocuprate(I) anions, piperazinium dications encompass a central channel of 5.5 Å containing polyiodide species. Raman studies of these species indicate a high degree of statistical disorder.
Several other synthetic applications of the interhalogens have appeared. The application of IBr for the deprotection of O-trityl and O-dimethoxytrityl ethers of carbohydrates and nucleosides can be used even in the presence of acid- or base-labile groups.51 IF5 is shown to convert benzyl sulfides to gem-difluoro compounds even in the presence of functional groups such as a ketone, nitrile or amide.52
Halogen oxides
Periodic acid (H5IO6) has been successfully employed for the preparation of polyaniline with an electrical conductivity of 100 S cm−1, the highest yet observed for a chemically prepared polyaniline.53 Transition metal free oxidative carbonylation of amines to ureas has been achieved by use of NaIO4 and CO (45 atm) in the presence of DMAP.54
Theoretical predictions indicated that dioxygenation of the sulfur atoms in fused oligothiophenes could significantly reduce the HOMO–LUMO gap, a potential boon for the application of these materials as field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. HOF·CH3CN has now been demonstrated as the reagent of choice for the synthesis of these compounds allowing exploration into their electronic and optical properties.55 Efficient continuous flow micro-reactor technology has been developed for the high yield epoxidation of alkenes with HOF·CH3CN.56 DFT calculations have been used to probe the reaction mechanism for the oxidation of sulfides and sulfoxides with various periodates; a substantive breadth of evidence suggests a one-step oxygen-transfer mechanism with simultaneous I–O bond breaking and SO bond formation.57
The chemistry of atmospheric chlorine oxides continues to garner great theoretical interest. Mass-resolved detection before and after laser irradiation of ClOOCl was used to determine its precise photodissociation cross section at 248.4 and 266 nm.58 This technique can obtain data without knowledge of the absolute concentration alleviating the need for the preparation of pure ClOOCl. The ClO + HOCO reaction has been investigated for the first time using high-level ab initio calculations and theoretical kinetic determinations to determine the thermal rate coefficients and product branching ratios.59 Several high-level ab initio calculations and UV/Vis matrix spectroscopy spectra of ClOOCl isolated in neon suggest that the observed absorption over the 290–400 nm region (most pertinent to polar stratospheric ozone loss) is substantially higher than previously reported.60 The new benchmark W4 approximation has now been applied to ab initio calculations of thermochemical data for the halogen oxides.61 Recent interest in the removal of oxychlorine species (ClOx−) from drinking water has prompted entry level studies on the use of iron porphyrins to act as dismutases for the degradation of ClO2−.62
Hypervalent halogen compounds
Hypervalent bromine chemistry has not received the serious attention given its iodine relative even though compounds of this type have been known since 1952. Access to these compounds is mostly limited to the treatment of bromoarenes with BrF3 or BrF5, highly toxic and difficult to handle oxidants. Ochiai has recently included treatment of hypervalent bromine chemistry within a broader treatise63 and a specific review of hypervalent organo-λ3-bromanes.64 Wirth and coworkers have published an account focusing on the unique applications of (diaryl)-λ3-bromanes, aryl(alkynyl)-λ3-bromanes and aryl(alkenyl)-λ3-bromanes.65 Cyclopent-1-enyl-(aryl)-λ3-bromanes were prepared by low temperature ligand exchange of p-CF3C6H4BrF2 with potassium cyclopentenyltrifluoroborate in MeCN.66 Complexation with [18]crown-6 increases the thermal stability of these reactive compounds and thus the single crystal X-ray structure was determined.
Although Stang and Zhdankin published their third comprehensive review of this area late in 2008 containing well over 1000 references, many more specialized reviews and accounts have followed in 2009. Zhdankin has published a more focused account on the use of hypervalent iodine(III) compounds for synthetic applications.67 The application of hypervalent iodine compounds in carbohydrate modification is one under-studied area that has now been covered in a concise review.68 Stang has published a personal account of his research concerning hypervalent iodine applications in supramolecular chemistry.69 The use of hypervalent iodine compounds in catalytic amounts in conjunction with inexpensive stoichiometric oxidants is a burgeoning area which has also garnered the attention of a recent review.70 Finally, a treatise on the application of hypervalent iodine oxidization of alcohols has also appeared.71
Many novel and intriguing hypervalent iodine compounds have been prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Most notably, three new oligomeric species have been synthesized by the treatment of PhI(OAc)2 with sodium bisulfate in aqueous acid.72 These include the previously unknown μ-oxo-[bis(acetoxy)iodo]benzene (Fig. 1(a)), a solid-state polymeric phenyliodine(III) sulfate, [(PhIO)3·SO3]n (Fig. 1(b)), where the polymer chains form a remarkable pseudo triple-helix supramolecular structure and a tetrameric phenyliodine(III) sulfate (Fig. 1(c)) where strong intermolecular interactions form a pseudo double helix. Analogous to diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylates, 2-[(aryl)iodonio]benzene-sulfonates have now been prepared and structurally characterized.73 These compounds may have application as recyclable aryl donors in metal catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura reactions. (Z)-3-Iodo acrylic acid derivatives can be easily oxidized to cyclic iodoxolones.74 These compounds have similar oxidation chemistry to iodoxybenzoic acids, but are more effective given their increased solubility in organic solvents. Furthering investigations of iodinanes bearing interacting ortho substituents, two new N-(2-iodylphenyl)tosylamides and 2-iodylphenyl tosylate have also been prepared and structurally characterized.75 These compounds bear pseudocyclic structures formed by intramolecular I⋯O interactions between the iodine atom and a sulfonyl oxygen. Mono- and perfluoroaryliodine(III) compounds, (ArIX2, X = F, CN) are known to possess strong intermolecular contacts between iodine and fluorine or nitrogen respectively. In a recent report the structural features of the N-base adducts of these iodinanes with phenanthroline, 2,2′-bipyridine, and quinoline were reported.76

Hypervalent iodine compounds are highly active aryl sources in metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. The Pd-catalyzed arylation of activated C–H bonds with diaryliodonium salts has now been studied with regards to overall scope and mechanism.77 Detailed mechanistic treatments have implicated a bimetallic high oxidation state Pd species as a key catalytic intermediate; raising the possibility that similar intermediates may be involved in other Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions. The RuCl3/PhIO2 co-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols or hydrocarbons has been demonstrated using Oxone® as the stoichiometric oxidant in aqueous acetonitrile.78 Key to the catalytic cycle is the previously reported oxidation of PhIO or PhI to PhIO2 in the presence of Ru(III) salts. A definitive comparison of two recently engineered hypervalent iodine oxidants, 2-iodylbenzoic acid isopropyl ester and [(PhIO)3·SO3]n, with iodosylbenzene in the metal porphyrin or phthalocyanine catalyzed oxygenation of anthracene has been reported.79 The engineered reagents offer faster reaction times and experimental convenience. A (η3-allyl)palladium(IV) complex is suggested to be the key intermediate in allylic C–H acetoxylation and benzoyloxylation reactions using DIB as the oxidant.80 These reactions are regio- and stereoselective and do not induce rearrangements. Meso-functionalized porphyrins were directly prepared from [5,10,15-triphenylporphyrinato]zinc(II) by DIB-NaAuCl4-mediated reactions with various amine and thiophenol nucleophiles.81 Gold-catalysis has also been applied to the oxidative homo- and hetero-coupling of arenes with PhI(OAc)2 under ambient conditions with marked functional group tolerance.82 The first mild conversion of methyl arenes to aryl nitriles at room temperature has been achieved using a mixture of NaN3, PhI(OAc)2 and catalytic CuSO4.83 The direct alkynylation of indole and pyrrole heterocycles using a benziodoxolone-based hypervalent iodine reagent in conjunction with catalysis by AuCl has been reported.84 1-(Trifluoromethyl)-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one has been used in conjunction with Zn(NTf2)2 for the facile trifluormethylation of aliphatic alcohols. Intriguingly a zinc-bearing iodane intermediate was isolated and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography.
The application of hypervalent iodine compounds often precludes the need for metal oxidants or catalysis. PhI(OAc)2 is effective for the conversion of piperidines to their cis-2,3-diacetoxylated analogs via selective functionalization of the sp3 C–H bonds in the absence of metal catalysis.85 In the same study, tetrahydroisoquinoline derivates were R–C–H functionalized with nucleophiles including nitroalkanes, dialkyl malonates, and β-keto esters in conjunction with PhI(OAc)2. Treatment of various thiophenes and pyrroles with PhI(OH)OTs followed by TMS-Br generates a unique PhI(Br)aryl intermediate which can add as an electrophile to electron rich arenes in a metal-free oxidative cross-coupling reaction.86 (1)Firmly emplaced as standard reagents in organic synthesis, hypervalent iodine compounds continue to be applied for the elegant solution of specific synthetic problems. A remarkable oxidative Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement induced by Ph(OAc)2 in hexafluoroisopropanol involves the transposition of a methyl group from a benzylic carbon to the ipso position with dearomatization.87 The authors stress the ability to transform an inexpensive and simple phenol into a highly functionalized core by an effectively “aromatic ring umpolung” process. In a second paper a simlar process is described for an PhI(OAc)2 mediated oxidative Friedel-Crafts reaction used towards the total syntheses of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids.88 Chiral 2-(o-Iodoxyphenyl)-oxazolines are the first known iodoxybenzene derivatives with a neutral nitrogen ligand in the ortho-position.89 These compounds have been successfully employed for the asymmetric synthesis of ortho-quinol Diels-Alder dimers from ortho-alkylphenols.
But-3-enyl camphanate was reacted with PhIO/BF3·OEt2 to afford 3-acyloxytetrahydrofurans with high diastereoselectivity; a useful synthesis given the biological importance of chiral oxygen heterocycles.90 Towards the full synthesis of cortstatin A, a key pentacycle has been constructed using a concise PhI(OAc)2 induced tandem intramolecular oxidative dearomatization and nitrile oxide cycloaddition of the (+)-Hajos-Parrish ketone.91 The physiologically-active fused indenodiazepinone scaffold can now be prepared by the oxidation of indenocarboxamides with bis[(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene] with yields and by-products (indenopyrazolinones and α-hydroxyamides) that correlate to the aromatic substituents of the substrate.92N-acyl enamines undergo oxidative cyclization with PhI(OAc)2 to afford α-oxy N-acyl aminals and hemiaminals.93 This methodology has been applied to the synthesis of psymberin, a member of the pederin family of natural products.
Catalytic chiral iodobiarenes in conjunction with an excess of mCPBA have been demonstrated to be effective in asymmetric phenol dearomatization reactions with high regio- and diastereoselectivity to afford epoxides.94 One intriguing question with regard to the in situ production of the iodane was proposed by the authors—why are carboxylated iodoarenes difficult to independently oxidize yet this oxidation easily occurs in situ in the presence of the phenolic substrate? The vibrancy of this area of research should inspire further investigations to determine the answer.
2-Iodoxybenzenesulfonic acid was much more active than substituted 2-iodoxybenzoic acids (IBX) as a catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols with Oxone® in non-aqueous media.95 Water soluble oligomeric iodosylbenzene sulfate, (PhIO)3·SO3 (I), has been used for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides or the oxidative rearrangements of alkenes to aldehydes or ketones.96 The reagent can be conveniently generated in situ or under solvent-free conditions. Hypoiodous acid generated from the combination of IBX and I2 in DMSO has been shown to be remarkably reactive; the conversion of even electron poor alkenes to iodohydrins with predominately anti-stereoselectivity.97
