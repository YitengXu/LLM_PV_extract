    , Accepted 7th February 2012First published on 8th February 2012AbstractThe sea urchin TiO2 (SU TiO2) particles composed of radially aligned rutile TiO2 nanowires are successfully synthesized through the simple solvothermal process. SU TiO2 was incorporated into the TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) network to construct the SU–NP composite film, and applied to the CdS/CdSe/ZnS quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). A conversion efficiency of 4.2% was achieved with a short-circuit photocurrent density of 18.2 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 531 mV, which corresponds to ∼20% improvement as compared with the values obtained from the reference cell made of the NP film. We attribute this extraordinary result to the light scattering effect and efficient charge collection.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) consisting of a wide band-gap semiconductor film, a dye and an electrolyte have been regarded as a promising alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic cells.1 Instead of using a dye, the sensitization of a photoanode can be achieved through modification of the oxide surface with a narrow band-gap semiconductor quantum-dot (QD). Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) recently have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their advantages over DSSCs. The advantages include (i) higher molar extinction coefficient2 of QDs than ruthenium complexes,3,4 (ii) tunable energy gaps,5 and (iii) multiple exciton generation6 which may potentially lead to a theoretical maximum efficiency7 higher than that of DSSCs.
Research on high-performance QDSSCs has been motivated by the following achievements: (i) various semiconducting metal chalcogenides (CdS,8,9 (∼1.35%) CdSe,10–12 (∼3.21%) PbS,13etc.), (ii) surface modification of QDs with ZnS passivation14,15 (∼2.02%) and the QD-size effect,11 (iii) improvement in linking between the QDs and the TiO2 matrix via chemical bath deposition (CBD) and self-assembly binding (SAB),14,15 (iv) non-corrosive Co2+/Co3+ and polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) complexes16,17 (∼1.15%) used as redox mediators, (V) Pt-free counter electrodes made of Au, Cu2S, and carbon18–20 (∼4.22%) and (Vi) structural optimization of a TiO2 photoelectrode (∼4.79%).21 In spite of extensive studies, however, efficiencies of most QDSSCs are still below 4%.
Recently, hierarchically structured oxide materials such as ZnO aggregates,22 nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2,23 mesoporous TiO2 beads24–26 have been reported as functional photoelectrode materials in the sensitized photovoltaic devices. These porous spherical systems consist of nano-sized crystallites that are aggregated to create micrometre- or submicrometre-sized secondary particles and thereby can function as light scattering materials maintaining a large internal surface area for sufficient sensitizer-uptake. Thus, these bi-functional materials having 0–3 hierarchy seem to be more appealing than traditional nanocrystalline TiO2. However, slow-trap-limited electron transport remains a problem in the charge collection kinetics.
In this work, we have synthesized a different type of hierarchical nanostructure: sea urchin TiO2 (SU TiO2) formed by clustering nanoneedles that has a mean diameter of about 50 nm and a length of a few micrometres to construct a radially aligned particle that is 4 to 7 μm in diameter. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of 1–3 hierarchical structures for the QDSSCs. It has been widely reported that 1D nanostructures have superior electron lifetime and recombination time than traditional nanoparticle films. In addition to the advantage of charge collection efficiency, 1D structures can effectively scatter visible light, thereby enhancing the overall light harvesting.
We present a new approach of implementing the benefits of nanostructures by suitably combining the SU TiO2 and traditional TiO2 nanoparticles (NP) to construct a hybrid composite photoelectrode (SU–NP) for the QDSSCs. In particular, the nanoparticles offer a high surface area (73.29 m2 g−1) for sufficient QD loading, whereas SU TiO2 particles provide a highway for fast charge collection and multiple scattering centers within the photoelectrode (Scheme 1). CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs made of the SU–NP composite film exhibited remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency: 4.2% versus 3.5% for the reference cell made with the NP film.

Experimental
Preparation of the photoelectrode with the SU TiO2 (SU) and the TiO2 nanoparticles (NP)
The SU TiO2 particles were synthesized by a simple solvothermal process through the modification of the reported procedure for TiO2 nanowire growth.27 For this, a precursor solution was prepared: 15 ml titanium butoxide, 24 ml titanium tetrachloride (1 M in toluene), and 8 ml hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) were dissolved in 80 ml toluene. After centrifugation (3700 rpm), an 80 ml transparent solution was collected for solvothermal treatment. Then, 16 ml absolute ethanol was added as a dispersing agent to the above solution (Fig. S1, ESI†). Finally, the mixture underwent autoclaving at 180 °C for 4 h. The autoclaved precipitates were washed with absolute ethanol.
The known synthetic procedure was used to prepare 20 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles (NP).28 As-prepared nanoparticles were used for the SU TiO2–NP composite.
To make a viscous paste, SU TiO2 and NP were mixed with a polymer binder and α-terpineol. The weight% in the SU–NP paste was 12.5% SU TiO2, 12.5% NP, 10% ethyl cellulose, and 65% α-terpineol. The mixture was then alternatively stirred and sonicated three times. Since the TiO2 sol contained a significant portion of ethanol, the mixture underwent rotary evaporation to remove the residual ethanol. The viscous paste was collected and kept in an opaque glass bottle. With the same procedure, a NP paste was prepared for reference: 18% NP, 9% ethyl cellulose, and 73% α-terpineol.
The viscous paste was printed on the FTO glass substrate. After calcination at 500 °C for 30 min, the films were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and washed with water and ethanol. The treated films were heated at 500 °C for 30 min. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S2, ESI†) clearly show that the thicknesses of two samples are almost identical (NP: 14.5 μm, SU–NP: 14.6 μm).
Deposition of CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs
The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique,29 known as a modified version of chemical bath deposition, was employed to assemble the CdS QDs on the TiO2 anode. For the deposition of the CdS QDs from the precursor solutions, two separate solutions were prepared: 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 in ethanol and 0.1 M Na2S in methanol. Two distinct working electrodes (SU–NP composite, NP) were immersed into the Cd2+ solution and the S2− solution successively for 2 minutes each. After dipping into one solution, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and methanol to remove the excess of each precursor. The number of the SILAR cycles was optimized to be 6 in our experimental conditions. The CdS-deposited photoanodes were dried on a hot plate at 60 °C and washed with deionized water.
Then, the CdSe QDs were deposited on the TiO2 films using chemical bath deposition (CBD). For the nucleation and growth of the CdSe QDs, TiO2/CdS films were immersed in an aqueous solution containing Cd(SO4):Na2SeSO3:N(CH2COONa)3 = 80 mM:80 mM:160 mM at 10 °C for 12 h. The Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was prepared by refluxing Se (0.5 M) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.6 M) at 120 °C for 7 h.
After the deposition of the CdSe QDs during the CBD process, the sensitized films were rinsed with deionized water. Then, the films were dipped again in 0.5 M aqueous Na2SeSO3 solution at 70 °C for 30 min to remove residual Cd2+ ions, which otherwise could cause the formation of the CdS QDs on the deposited CdSe QDs (Fig. S3, ESI†) by reacting with S2− ions during the ZnS passivation.30 ZnS was finally deposited on top of the sensitized films through the SILAR process. For the ZnS passivation, two separate solutions were used: 0.1 M aqueous Zn(NO3)2, and 0.1 M aqueous Na2S. Two SILAR cycles were used.
Cell fabrication
The counter electrode was prepared by dripping a Pt solution (Solaronix, Platisol T) on the FTO glass substrate, which was followed by thermal treatment at 500 °C for 30 minutes. For the cell assembly, a hot-melt 60 μm-thick Surlyn (Solaronix, Meltonix 1170-60) was used as a spacer between the working electrode and the Pt electrode. The polysulfide electrolyte was composed of 1 M S and 1 M Na2S in deionized water.
Characterization
Morphology and crystallography of the SU TiO2 particle were studied by employing a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; JEOL, JSM-7401F) and an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, RINT 2000). For the sensitized TiO2 films, higher resolution TEM images and EELS analysis data were obtained by a TEM (JEOL JEM-2200FS) in NCNT (National Center for Nanomaterials Technology in Pohang). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained by utilizing a Micrometrics Tristar 3000 system. The photovoltaic performance was measured under an illumination of a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, 92251A) at one sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with an active area of 0.16 cm2. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were recorded as a function of the wavelength from 350 nm to 850 nm (PV Measurements, Inc). A 75 W Xenon lamp was used as a light source with a monochromator. Calibration was performed with a NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a reference (chopping frequency at 4 Hz). The monochromatic power density was calibrated using a reference Si photodiode as a standard from the NIST. UV-visible reflectance spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis spectrometer (Lambda 750S). Electrical impedance spectra were measured using an impedance analyzer (BioLogic, SP-300), with a frequency ranging from 10−1 to 106 Hz, and analyzed using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out on a electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated red light emitting diode (625 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, RTL01), which can provide both DC and AC components of illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 10−2 Hz to 102 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a–c) show morphological features of the calcined SU TiO2 particles. The high-magnification FE-SEM image indicates that the SU TiO2 particles are composed of nanoneedles that have a mean diameter of about 50 nm and a length of a few micrometres to construct a radially aligned particle that is 4 to 7 μm in diameter. In the inset of Fig. 1b, broken particles reveal the internal nanostructure of the SU TiO2. It seems that many nanoneedles are densely packed within the spherical particle. The high-resolution image of a single nanoneedle constituting the SU TiO2 (Fig. 1d) shows that the material is fully crystalline with the lattice spacing of 0.324 nm, which corresponds to the rutile (110) plane.

Time-dependent analysis provides more detailed information on the formation process of the SU TiO2. Fig. S4a (ESI†) shows that nanoparticles were initially created after 30 min solvothermal reaction. With the prolongation of reaction time (Fig. S4b, 1 h, ESI†), the aggregates were formed which finally led to the 1–3 hierarchically-structured SU TiO2 (Fig. S4c, 4 h, ESI†). The anisotropic growth of nanoneedles on the spherical particle surface can be understood in terms of shape-controlled chemistry.31–33 It is thought that Cl− ions adsorb selectively onto the (110) crystal plane,34 which limit further growth of this plane, resulting in anisotropic growth and hence radially aligned TiO2 nanoneedle formation.
The XRD patterns indicate that two distinct samples are in different crystalline phases (Fig. 2): SU TiO2 in rutile, and NP in anatase, respectively (JCPDS card No. 21-1276 and 21-1272).

Fig. 3 shows the STEM images of the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD-sensitized NP (a) and SU films (c). Most of the QDs seem to be individual on the NP film with less agglomeration of the QDs, and a partially uncovered surface is also found. In contrast, the SU TiO2 seemingly forms larger QD agglomerates with better coverage on the surface of TiO2 nanoneedles. This implies that the surface coverage of the QDs is superior at the SU TiO2. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) shows spatial distribution of the QDs deposited on the NP and SU TiO2 samples at a high resolution.26 Magnified TEM images of NP and SU TiO2 and the corresponding EELS data are shown in Fig. 3b and d.

The current–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were studied under one sun illumination (Fig. 4). The photovoltaic properties of the SU–NP and NP cells are summarized in Table 1. The SU–NP cell shows Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) of 531 mV, 18.2 mA cm−2, 0.43 and 4.2%, respectively; the reference NP cell shows 510 mV, 15.2 mA cm−2, 0.45, and 3.5%. Both Jsc and η of the SU–NP device are improved by around 20%, compared to those of the NP cell. The quantum efficiency (IPCE) provides detailed information on the light harvesting mechanism (inset of Fig. 4). It is observed that the overall IPCE values of the SU–NP cell are higher than the NP cell over the whole spectral range. This implies that efficiency improvement in the SU–NP composite QDSSC is mainly due to the enhanced current density.

It is well known that the photocurrent density (Jsc) can be calculated by the following expression:35 Jsc = qηlhηinjηccIo(1)where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency of a cell, ηinj is the charge-injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge-collection efficiency, and I0 is the light flux. Here, ηlh is commonly determined by the amount of adsorbed QDs and light scattering of the films; ηcc is largely determined by the competition between the charge collection and recombination.36 Since identical QDs (CdS/CdSe/ZnS) are applied both to the SU–NP and NP films, ηinj values of two QDSSCs are assumed to be the same. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the photocurrent density under our experimental conditions is determined by two parameters: the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh) and the charge-collection efficiency (ηcc).
The ηlh value is explained by the reflectance spectra. Since the micrometre-sized SU TiO2 particles can function as scattering centers (Fig. S5, ESI†), the SU–NP composite film can effectively confine visible light (450 to 750 nm). We concluded that improved red response of the NP–SU film contributes to the enhancement in the ηlh, which is reflected to the increased IPCE values at the long wavelength region. After the sensitization with the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs, the reflectance spectra take on a new aspect (Fig. 5b). The reflectance of each sample is reduced at the short wavelength range (under 650 nm) due to the absorption of the incident light by the QDs.
 Fig. 5  Diffuse reflectance spectra of the SU–NP composite film and the NP film before (a) and after (b) QDs deposition. 
Even though the SU TiO2 particles possess an inferior QD loading capacity owing to a lower surface area of 10.16 m2 g−1 (NP: 73.29 m2 g−1), the SU–NP device yielded remarkably larger IPCE values at the short wavelength region. This contradictory result comes from the difference between ηcc in two distinct QDSSCs (SU–NP and NP cells). Note that ηcc is generally determined by the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectra (IMPS/IMVS). In brief, IMPS measures the periodic current response to the intensity-modulated light, providing kinetic information on the charge transport under short-circuit conditions. On the other hand, IMVS is conducted with the same perturbed light but under open-circuit conditions, which offers the recombination lifetime. The electron transport time (τt) can be estimated from the equation τt = 1/(2πft), where ft is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS imaginary component. Similarly, the recombination lifetime (τr) can be determined from the relation τr = 1/(2πfr), where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component. Fig. 6a presents the plot of the electron transport time (τt). It is noticeable that τt of the SU–NP hybrid composite-based QDSSC is larger than that of the reference NP cell. The relatively faster electron transport seems to be due to fewer interparticle junctions within the SU–NP photoelectrode.37,38 The effective electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) was also estimated from the expression: Dn = L2/(2.35τt),39 where L is the film thickness. The Dn of the SU–NP cell was 2.3 times larger than that of the NP cell under 100 W m−2 illumination (Fig. S6, ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Incident light intensity dependent transport time constant (a) and the recombination time constant (b) for the QDSSCs based on the SU–NP composite film and the NP film measured under 625 nm LED illumination. 

Fig. 6b shows that τr of the SU–NP cell is longer than that of the NP device over the whole light-intensity range. The increased τr is attributed to the presence of the relatively defect-free single crystalline TiO2 nanoneedles that have far fewer grain boundaries, which may result in the reduced electron trapping phenomena.40,41 Additionally, better surface coverage of the QDs at the SU–NP film can promote longer τr.38 This assumption is in agreement with the previous analysis obtained from the TEM images. This result is also consistent with Nyquist plots obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) employed to examine the interfacial reactions in the QDSSCs (Fig. S7, ESI†). The effective electron diffusion length (Ln) was obtained from Dn and τr using the relationship Ln = (Dn × τr)1/2. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the Ln (35.69 μm) of the SU–NP cell is around twice as thick as that of the NP cell (17.97 μm) under the light intensity of 100 W m−2. On the basis of the increased τr, improved photoelectron densities n (n ∝ Jscτr)42 yield a higher Voc43 in the SU–NP cell.
The charge-collection efficiency (ηcc) can be calculated by the two values obtained from the above IMPS and IMVS analysis via the following equation:44 ηcc = 1 – (τt/τr)(2)Consequently, ηcc of the SU–NP cell (92.9%) was 20.6% larger than that of the NP device. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that higher Jsc is mainly due to the higher ηcc, and partially due to the higher ηlh of the SU–NP hybrid composite QDSSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, sea urchin TiO2 (SU TiO2) particles composed of rutile TiO2 nanoneedles and TiO2 nanoparticles (NP) have been synthesized through a solvothermal process. For the cell fabrication, the SU–NP hybrid composite film was prepared, and compared with the NP film. CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs made of the SU–NP film achieved a noticeable improvement in power conversion efficiency: 4.2% versus 3.5% for the reference cell made of the NP film. We attribute this extraordinary result to the higher photocurrent density (Jsc) of the SU–NP cell (18.2 mA cm−2), corresponding to about 20% improvement in comparison with the NP cell. The origin of the enhanced Jsc was investigated in terms of two parameters: the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh) and the charge-collection efficiency (ηcc). The diffuse reflectance spectra and the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectra confirmed that both ηlh and ηcc were enhanced due to the internal light scattering and more efficient charge collection. Therefore, we concluded that the SU–NP hybrid composite can be exploited as a versatile building block for the QDSSCs.
