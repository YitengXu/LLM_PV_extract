Part 1.—Absolute absorption cross-section(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )David N. Mitchell, Richard P. Wayne, Paul J. Allen, Richard P. Harrison and Robert J. TwinAbstractThe free radical NO3 was generated by the reaction of NO2 with ozone. A recirculating flow system was used so that concentrations of ozone ≈ 5 × 1017 molecule cm–3 could be used. The absorption spectrum of NO3 in the wavelength range 498–671 nm was obtained.An absolute absorption cross-section was obtained at λ≈ 662 nm by using reactant concentrations such that all NO2 was converted to NO3 and no NO3 was lost: that is, the [NO2] added provided the absolute measure of [NO3] in the system. The conditions used were [NO2] [graphic omitted] 1012 molecule cm–3; [O3] [graphic omitted] 3 × 1017 molecule cm–3. At the absorption peak (λ≈ 663 nm) the cross-section is (121 ± 20)× 10–19 cm2 at T= 294 ± 4 K. A comparison is given of this value with the results of other workers, and some implications for the photochemistry of NO3 are suggested.
