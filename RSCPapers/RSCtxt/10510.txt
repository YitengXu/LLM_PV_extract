    , Accepted 16th January 2021First published on 23rd January 2021AbstractMost semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) show a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) because of the inherent narrow band-gap of the active layer materials, which is proven to be a key limitation for the improvement of the device performance. To obtain a high VOC, wide-band gap polymer donors, such as PM6 are often selected for ST-OSCs, but the absorption in the visible light region of such wide-band gap polymer donors is not conducive to the transparency of the devices. Therefore, rational design of active materials to improve the VOC and device efficiency without sacrificing transparency is critical to realize ST-OSCs for practical applications. Herein, we propose a new design concept of combination of donors and acceptors with low energy levels and overlapping near-infrared absorption for high performance ST-OSCs. We incorporate chlorine, sulfur and fluorine functional atoms into the polymer PCE10 to down-shift the energy levels of the resulting polymer donors, namely PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F, respectively. All these functionalized polymer donors show lower energy levels than PCE10, ensuring a significantly higher VOC. Especially, the narrow band-gap PCE10-2Cl having overlapping absorption with the non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F not only obtains a remarkably improved VOC, but also achieves a comparable photocurrent to the blends with complementary absorption. Subsequently, the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F-based device delivers a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.72% among the functionalized PCE10-based devices. For the ST-OSC device with PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, a PCE of 8.25% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 33% is achieved without any extra treatment, which is an outstanding performance of ST-OSCs with an AVT of over 30%. These results indicate that a rational combination of narrow band-gap donors and acceptors with overlapping absorption is a promising strategy to fabricate high performance ST-OSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted tremendous attention, because they are low cost and light weight, exhibit high power conversion efficiencies and capable of being made into flexible semitransparent devices.1–7 The visible-light transparency feature of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) makes organic photovoltaic technology attractive for application in new markets, such as window panes, building architecture and greenhouse roofs.8–16 In order to obtain high-performance ST-OSCs, it is necessary to rationally design and select the active layer materials to meet the special requirement of ST-OSCs that not only have high power conversion efficiency (PCE), but also have high average visible transmittance (AVT) and high color rendering coefficient. In the recent past years, the rapid development of narrow-band-gap NFAs has provided an effective way to improve the performance of ST-OSCs because of their strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and adjustable energy levels.17–20
However, the photovoltaic performance of ST-OSCs is generally lower than those of the opaque counterparts. For example, Zhan et al. used a narrow band-gap donor combined with an ultra-narrow band-gap acceptor to obtain a device with more than 35% AVT. However, the inherent narrow-band-gap of active materials resulted in a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.739 V and high energy loss (Eloss), limiting the enhancement in device performance.21 In general, the first design principle of ST-OSCs is to choose transparent materials for device assembly. For the active layer, only narrow band-gap semi-conductive materials with NIR absorption can meet such requirements of ST-OSCs, because they perfectly avoid the capture of visible light. Moreover, the strong absorption in the NIR region of the narrow band-gap active materials also enables most ST-OSCs with a notably high short-circuit current density (JSC). However, most of the reported active layer materials with narrow band-gaps, including polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors, possess relatively low lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and relatively high highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs). Such energy levels result in a narrow offset between the HOMO of donors and the LUMO of acceptors which determines the VOC value of organic solar cells. As a result, a low VOC is usually obtained by ST-OSCs, which is proven to be a key limitation for the improvement of the device performance. Since the narrow band-gap confines the energy levels of the donor and acceptor, increasing of VOC becomes a big challenge for ST-OSCs. To simultaneously obtain a high VOC and high PCE of ST-OSCs, many researchers have to choose medium width band gap donors with deep HOMO levels for device fabrication. For instance, Tan et al. fabricated a ST-OSC with a VOC of 0.82 V and a PCE of 12% by blending a non-fullerene acceptor Y6 with a medium width band gap donor PM6, but this device only showed 25% AVT, just reaching the critical value of AVT required from ST-OSCs.22–25 The low visible transmittance of the device originated from the strong absorption in the visible light region by the medium width band gap donor. Hence, there is an inherent trade-off between photovoltaic performance and AVT in the visible light range of 400–800 nm.26–31 Since a high AVT is a fundamental requisite of ST-OSCs, rational design of active materials to improve the VOC and device efficiency without sacrificing transparency is critical to realize high performance ST-OSCs for practical applications.32
Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thio-phene-2-carboxylate] (PCE-10) is a famous narrow band gap donor material for high-performance organic solar cells when blended with fullerene acceptors.33 As the research interest on fullerene acceptors is replaced by non-fullerene acceptors, PCE10 as a donor material has gradually faded out of people's sight. However, PCE10 shows strong absorption in the near-infrared region, which is potential application for ST-OSCs to obtain high AVT and high JSC. Forrest et al. paired PCE10 with an ultra-narrow band-gap non-fullerene acceptor IDC-4Cl to make a ST-OSC, obtaining an ultra-high AVT of 43%.34 Baran et al. also used PCE10 combined with an ultra-narrow band-gap acceptor IEICO-4F to obtain a device with JSC up to 27 mA cm−2.13 The outstanding JSC and AVT value of the PCE10-based devices are mainly due to the strong absorption in the near infrared region. Regrettably, PCE10 has a high HOMO level, resulting in a relatively low VOC of devices and limiting the further improvement in the device performance.
In order to maximize the VOC for improving the PCE and obtaining high AVT simultaneously, the HOMO and LUMO levels of donor polymers should be close to those of non-fullerene acceptors, and the optical band gap should also be narrow.35,36 Therefore, we need to reduce energy levels as much as possible, but still ensure sufficient driving force for electron and hole transfer.37–40 In this work, we propose a new design concept of combination of donors and acceptors with low energy levels and overlapping NIR absorption for high performance ST-OSCs. Chlorine, sulfur and fluorine atoms are introduced into PCE10 to down-shift the energy levels of the resulting polymer donors, namely PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F. All these functionalized polymer donors show lower HOMO and LUMO levels than PCE10, ensuring a significantly higher VOC when blended with a non-fullerene acceptor, IT-4F. Intriguingly, for the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend, the overlapping absorption of the donor and acceptor does not reduce the JSC value relative to those blends with complementary absorption. More importantly, such a combination can selectively pass most visible light through the device to guarantee a high AVT and get a high VOC and PCE at the same time. As a result, the best PCE of 10.72% with the highest VOC of 0.82 V is obtained by the device with PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, which is much higher than those of the reference device with PCE10:IT-4F. Apart from the high VOC, a PCE of 8.25% with an AVT of 33% is also achieved without any extra treatment for ST-OSCs with PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, which is an outstanding performance of ST-OSCs with an AVT of over 30%. In addition, these ST-OSCs also have great aesthetic value and good color rendering.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F are shown in Fig. 1. The target products PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction according to the literature.41–43 Detailed synthesis procedures and the structural characterization are provided in the Experimental section of the ESI (Fig. S1†). All of the three donor materials can dissolve in common solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, but PCE10-2Cl shows the best solubility compared to the other two counterparts. Gel permeation chromatography measurements at room temperature showed that the number average molecular weight (Mn) of PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F was 110.86 kDa, 90.71 kDa and 38.29 kDa, respectively, and the polydispersity index was 1.53, 2.04 and 1.33, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). PCE10-SF has a much smaller number-average molecular weight because it has worse solubility than PCE10-2Cl and PCE10-2F, which reduces the growth of the molecular chain during the polymerization process.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymer donors, PCE10 and non-fullerene acceptors are shown in Fig. 2a and S4.† Compared with PCE10, chlorinated polymer donor PCE10-2Cl shows a very similar absorption with a slight redshift, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.57 eV. The red shift light absorption and narrower band-gap of PCE10-2Cl imply that PCE10-2Cl as a donor for ST-OSCs is more suitable than PCE10. For the fluorinated polymer donor, the absorption of PCE10-2F does not change significantly, while PCE10-SF has a slight blue-shift absorption. The optical band gaps of PCE10-2F and PCE10-SF are 1.57 and 1.70 eV, respectively. The blue-shift absorption band of PCE10-SF is probably ascribed to the lowest number-average molecular weight and the poorest molecular packing. The wide band gaps make it unfavorable for ST-OSCs. In addition, to the small molecule acceptor IT-4F, PCE10-2Cl and PCE10-2F have a very overlapping absorption, while PCE10-SF shows better absorption complementarity. Such a difference in the light response would greatly affect their corresponding JSC values.

The LUMO and HOMO levels of the three polymer donors were measured using cyclic voltammetry. The results are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The HOMO/LUMO levels of PCE10, PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF, PCE10-2F and IT-4F are −5.24/−3.66 eV, −5.50/−3.93 eV, −5.53/−3.76 eV, −5.47/−3.96 eV, and −5.66/−4.14 eV, respectively. Compared to PCE10, the HOMO energy levels of PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F are reduced by 0.24 eV, 0.29 eV and 0.23 eV, respectively. It should be noted that the downshift energy levels of the PCE10-2Cl and PCE10-2F do not cause a reduction in the band-gap, which is more conducive to obtain a high VOC and ensure a high transparency of the resulting devices. It can be seen from the energy levels shown in Fig. 2c that ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO for PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, PCE10-2F:IT-4F and PCE10-SF:IT-4F (ΔEHOMO of 0.16 eV, 0.13 eV and 0.19 eV, ΔELUMO of 0.21 eV, 0.38 eV and 0.18 eV, respectively), are less than the typical required value of 0.3–0.5 eV for exciton separation.18–20 Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was thus used to study the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behaviors in the blend film (Fig. 2d–f). According to the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 2a, the PL emission spectra of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, PCE10-2F:IT-4F and PCE10-SF:IT-4F were measured with excitation wavelengths of 710 nm, 710 nm and 680 nm to probe electron transfer and with an excitation wavelength of 720 nm to probe hole transfer. As shown in Fig. 2d–f, compared with their corresponding pure films, all the blend films show significantly quenched PL indicating the efficient electron/hole transfer from the donor/acceptor to acceptor/donor. Among these blend films, PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F shows the most completely quenched PL. Therefore, such efficient transfer of both electrons and holes between the donor and acceptor would ensure the efficient generation of photoexcited charge carriers.
Photovoltaic properties
We fabricated OSC devices with the indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide/active layer/MoO3/Ag inverted structure and studied the photovoltaic performance of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F, PCE10-SF:IT-4F and PCE10-2F:IT-4F-based devices. A control device based on PCE10:IT-4F was also produced. The processing conditions of the devices are shown in the ESI.† The current density/voltage (J–V) curves of OSC are shown in Fig. 3a. Detailed photovoltaic parameters of these four devices are summarized in Table 1. A PCE of 7.92% is obtained for the PCE10:IT-4F-based device with a VOC of 0.655 V, a JSC of 18.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.27% (Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI†). The downshifted HOMO levels of these modified-PCE10 polymers obviously improve the VOC values of the resulting devices. The device based on PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F exhibits a VOC of 0.822 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.13 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 71.94% and a PCE of 10.72%. A moderate energy loss (Eloss) of 0.62 eV can be calculated from the equation of Eloss = Eg − qVOC (Eg is obtained from the edge of the EQE curve). Besides the dramatically improved VOC value, the FF is found to be also enhanced from 66.27% to 71.94%, suggesting that a more favorable morphology has been built in the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F film. In contrast, the devices based on PCE10-SF:IT-4F and PCE10-2F:IT-4F only obtain the PCEs of 2.41% and 3.71%, respectively. The reduced overall device parameters of the devices with PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F are probably as a result of their relatively low molecular weights and unfavorable morphology produced from their poorer solubility.

Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the four devices. The devices based on PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F show a poor photoelectric response, with a maximum EQE value of 48% and 40%, and integrated current density as low as 8.3 and 10.9 mA cm−2, respectively. However, the integrated current density calculated from the EQE curve of the device based on PCE10-2Cl is 18.1 mA cm−2, comparable to that of the PCE10-based device (Fig. S5†). These values are within the 5% mismatch of the JSC values from the J–V curve. Generally, complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor is found to deliver much superior photocurrent than overlapping absorption, because it can fully use the wide range of UV-vis light. Unexpectedly, the overlap of the absorption of PCE10-2Cl and IT-4F in the narrow region of 600–800 nm produces much higher JSC than the more complementary absorption of the blends with PCE10-SF and IT:4F. When we further increase the film thickness of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F from 80 nm to 110 nm, JSC gradually increases from 18.1 to 19.8 mA cm−2. We thereby fabricated the device based on IT-4F blended with a popular donor PM6 with a wide band-gap for comparison, as shown in Fig. 3c, d and Table 1. The thickness of PM6:IT-4F and PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F films is kept the same (110 nm) to exclude the effect of thickness on the photocurrent. As can be observed from the EQE spectra in Fig. 3d, compared with the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend (19.1 vs. 19.0 mA cm−2), PM6:IT-4F with complementary absorption obtains an almost equal JSC value. In fact, the main photon flux of the solar spectrum is located in the near IR region, and the energy distribution in this region reaches 51% of the solar spectrum. Most narrow bandgap acceptors (such as IT-4F that was used in our work) can not completely absorb the whole energy of this region. We compared the absorbance of the active layer of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F with that of PM6:IT-4F under the same condition, and the absorption of background has been subtracted. From Fig. S6† we can see that the blend film based on PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F with overlapping absorption shows much higher intensity than PM6:IT-4F with complimentary absorption, but their absorption ranges do not show significant difference. Since both the blends have efficient charge transfer (as revealed by their completely quenched photoluminescence), the higher absorbance of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F indicates a higher charge generation efficiency in this blend. We further calculated the JSC values directly from the absorption spectra. The calculated JSC of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F is 13.32 mA cm−2, while that of PM6:IT-4F is 12.78 mA cm−2. Despite other factors in a real device, the theoretical photocurrent of the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F film is higher than that of PM6:IT-4F only considering the light absorption. The lower calculated JSC values from the UV spectra than those from J–V and EQE curves originated from lack of utilization of light reflection from the back electrons that contributes greatly to the photocurrent. In a practical device, as a result of the influence of comprehensive factors (e.g. morphology and charge transport), the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F-based device with overlapping absorption shows a comparable JSC value to the PM6:IT-4F-based device. These results give a signal for design of ST-OSCs: active layer materials with overlapping absorption in the NIR region would be a good choice for ST-OSCs to obtain high transparency but without sacrificing the photocurrent.
Morphology characterization
The surface morphology and volume morphology of the blended membranes were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4a and S7,† PCE10:IT-4F has a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.08 nm. The surface of the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend film is smooth and uniform, and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 1.03 nm, similar to those of the PCE10:IT-4F film. In addition, a nanofiber structure is observed in the phase diagram (Fig. 4a and b) and TEM image (Fig. 4c and S8†) of the hybrid membrane, which ensured efficient charge transport in the device. These morphological features, in turn, help the device achieve high JSC, FF and PCE. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 1.83 nm for PCE10-SF:IT-4F and 2.31 nm for PCE10-2F:IT-4F. PCE10-SF:IT-4F and PCE10-2F:IT-4F blend films even exhibit an obvious aggregated state, illustrating poor compatibility between the donor and acceptor. The unfavorable morphology is also an important reason for their poor photovoltaic performance.

(g) GIWAXS image of PCE10-2Cl, IT-4F and PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend films. (d) GIWAXS intensity profiles along the in-plane (dotted line) and out-of-plane (solid line) directions. 
In order to deeply study the volumetric molecular packing information of the neat PCE10-2Cl film and the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend film, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. Fig. 4d shows the corresponding intensity profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions. Fig. 4e–g shows the 2D-GIWAX patterns of neat PCE10-2Cl, neat IT-4F and PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend films. The neat PCE10-2Cl film (Fig. 4e) shows a strong stacking peak (010) in the OOP direction at q = 1.77 Å−1 (d ∼ 4.04 Å), and the corresponding lamellar superimposed (100) peaks in the IP direction at q = 0.312 Å−1 (d ∼ 24.40 Å), indicating that PCE10-2Cl has well-defined lamellar and π–π stacking structures. For the neat IT-4F film (Fig. 4f), a weak (010) diffraction peak at q = 1.44 Å−1 (d ∼ 6.89 Å) appears in the OOP direction, while a weak (100) peak at q = 0.363 Å−1 (d ∼ 16.39 Å) appears in the IP direction. For the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend film (Fig. 4g), both the (100) diffraction peak and (010) diffraction peak also can be observed in the IP direction and in the OOP direction, respectively. The strong diffraction peaks reveal a strong preference for face-on orientation in the blend film. Such typical face-on orientation of the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F blend film infers that compared with the neat film, the packing arrangement of the polymer PCE10-2Cl remains almost unchanged in the blend film, but with larger crystallite coherence lengths (CCL) (Table S2†), which can facilitate vertical charge transport and reduce charge recombination.
Semitransparent photovoltaic device performance
The 1.5G AM solar spectrum consists of UV, visible and NIR regions. Sunlight has the largest energy distribution of 51% in the NIR region, while the visible spectrum and UV spectrum have 47% and 2% energy distributions respectively.18–20 The response curve of the human eye is narrowly distributed in the visible spectrum of 380–780 nm, and its maximum response is about 550 nm. As shown in Fig. 5a, transmittance around 550 nm dominates the average visible transmittance (AVT) of materials, while the light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm and longer than 700 nm has negligible influence on it. For the donor material PM6, most of the absorption of the neat film is in the range of 500–700 nm, and the peak overlaps with the peak of the human eye response, which will greatly reduce the AVT value and is not unfavorable for the fabrication of semitransparent devices. Intriguingly, the main peak of PCE10-2Cl and IT-4F neat films is located in the NIR region (>700 nm). Both of them have such a weak absorption in human eyes response region can guarantee a high AVT for the devices. Fig. 5b shows the transmittance spectra of the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F and PM6:IT-4F active layer on ITO glass with the thickness being kept the same (110 nm). The AVT of the ITO glass is 90.3%. The PM6:IT-4F/ITO glass shows a maximum transmission of 55% at 470 nm with an AVT of 37.4%. However, PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F/ITO glass shows better transmittance, with the highest transmission of 73% at the 450 nm peak, obtaining an AVT of 50.7%. Fig. 5c shows the pictures of different active layers on ITO glass. Photos based on PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F show that it performs well in ST-OSCs with a clear and bright background, while devices based on PM6:IT-4F show much poorer transmittance.

(c) AVT value and photograph of PM6:IT-4F and PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F active layer film on ITO glass with the same active layer thickness of 110 nm. 
We fabricated a semitransparent solar cell based on PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F (the thickness of the active layer is 80 nm), where ultra-thin Ag with different thicknesses (5, 10 and 15 nm) was used as the back electrode to enhance the AVT of the device. As shown in Fig. 6a, the Ag thickness plays an important role in the overall AVT of the device. The device with 15 nm thick Ag just obtains the critical AVT of approximately 25%. In contrast, the device with 5 nm thick Ag shows a high AVT of more than 44%. Fig. 6b shows the current–voltage (J–V) curve of the ST-OSC; the device performance is summarized in Table 2 and the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6c. When the thickness of Ag is changed, a clear trade-off between AVT and PCE can be observed. When the AVT values of PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F devices are 44%, 33% and 25% with 5, 10 and 15 nm thick Ag, respectively, the corresponding PCEs are 6.5%, 8.25% and 9.0%. It is worth noting that a high VOC of 0.82 V is obtained for all the ST-OSCs, even for the device with AVT over 44%. Fig. 6d summarizes the recent progress on VOC and AVT of ST-OSCs. From the figure we can see that for all the reported ST-OSCs with AVT over 25%, the VOC of 0.82 V is the highest value reported so far. Therefore, such a high VOC contributes to a decent PCE of 8.25% with a high AVT of 33%. This efficiency is also one of the outstanding performances of ST-OSCs with an AVT of over 30%. Therefore, by rational design of the active layer composed of donors and acceptors both with deep energy levels and overlapping absorption in the NIR region, the contradiction between light transmittance and device performance is effectively alleviated.

Advanced ST-OSCs also need to conform to human aesthetics and color perception. Parameters such as color coordinates (x, y) (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) can be used to evaluate human visual color perception, and these parameters can be calculated based on the transmission spectrum of ST-OSCs. The color coordinates of the ST-OSC in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram are shown in Fig. 6e and S9 (ESI†). The CIE coordinates of the best PCE device (Ag layer 15 nm) are (x = 0.2306, y = 0.2748), CCT is 23756 K, and CRI is 71.7. The CIE color coordinates of the control transparent device (Ag layer 10 nm) are (x = 0.2359, y = 0.2877), the CCT is 17463 K, and the CRI is 69.2. The CIE color coordinates of the best transparent device (5 nm of the Ag layer) are (x = 0.2435, y = 0.2948), the CCT is 14597 K, and the CRI is 70.6. ST-OSC's digital photos further verified the color reproduction performance of the device. Fig. 6e shows a photo of the Institute of Polymer and Energy Chemistry of Nanchang University, with/without the ST-OSC, and its Ag layer thickness is 5 nm. The 5 nm ST-OSC with the Ag layer shows a light blue color, which is close to the color of glass windows used in homes. These results indicate that our ST-OSC has an attractive color appearance.
Conclusion
In summary, we developed high performance ST-OSCs using a strategy of combination of narrow band gap polymer donors and narrow band gap non-fullerene acceptors with overlapping absorption and deep energy levels. All these functionalized polymer donors show lower energy levels than PCE10, ensuring a significantly higher VOC. Especially, combination of the PCE10-2Cl donor and the non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F with overlapping near-infrared absorption does not reduce JSC relative to the blends with complementary absorption. Such a combination can selectively pass most visible light through the device to ensure a high AVT and get a high VOC and PCE at the same time. Subsequently, the PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F-based device delivers a champion PCE of 10.72% among the functionalized PCE10-based devices. When a 10 nm Ag film is used as the bottom transparent electrode, the AVT of ST-OSCs is 33%, and the PCE is 8.25%, which is one of the outstanding performances of ST-OSCs with an AVT of over 30%. The results indicate that a combination of narrow band-gap donors and acceptors with overlapping absorption is a promising strategy to fabricate high performance ST-OSCs.
