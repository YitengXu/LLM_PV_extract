    , Accepted 31st January 2023First published on 31st January 2023AbstractRational design of bifunctional transition metal electrocatalysts with customary efficiency for water splitting is essential for yielding high-purity hydrogen, but remains challenging. Herein, we propose a non-metal atom S and oxyphilic transition metal atom Fe co-regulation strategy to optimize the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of metallic Ni (S–Fe–Ni). The S–Fe–Ni metal exhibits super activities with an ultralow overpotential of 25 mV and 200 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 89 mV and 235 mV at 100 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER, respectively. When served as the cathode and anode, the S–Fe–Ni catalyst only needs 1.49 V to obtain 10 mA cm−2 for water splitting. Further experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the S and Fe induced electronic redistribution optimizes water and hydrogen adsorption for enhanced HER and the in situ derived S doped NiFe hydroxyl oxide is associated with the enhanced OER. This work puts forward new insights into designing transition metal bifunctional catalysts for alkaline water splitting.
1. Introduction
Vigorously developing clean and renewable energy provides an attractive strategy for alleviating energy shortages, environmental pollution, and carbon emissions. Renewable energy powered water electrolysis technology can convert unreliable, intermittent renewable energy into clean and efficient hydrogen energy.1,2 However, efficient catalysts are urgently needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics and large overpotential due to the multi-step electron transfer process of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).3,4 At present, Ru/Ir oxides and Pt metals are reference catalysts for the OER and HER, while their high price and rareness are not conducive to their universal applications.5–7 Moreover, the mismatch between OER and HER electrolytes makes an electrolytic water device more complicated. Hence, it is urgent to design bifunctional transition metal-based catalysts, which is still challenging.
To seek alternative catalysts for precious metals, exploration of transition metal based catalysts including single-atom catalysts,8–11 alloys,1,12 phosphides,13–17 oxides,18,19 (oxy)hydroxides,20–22 sulfides,23,24etc., has never stopped. Transition metals with excellent conductivity have attracted extensive attention. Nickel, a transition metal with abundant reserves,25 is recognized as a promising water splitting catalyst due to its stronger H adsorption capacity than Pt and moderate OH bond strength.26,27 However, the weak adsorption, low dissociation efficiency of water and stronger adsorption energy to hydrogen result in its unsatisfactory alkaline HER activity.28 Compared with the HER, the OER process involves multiple O-containing intermediates,29,30 and the transformation of these intermediates puts forward more stringent requirements for catalytic sites. High-valence metal sites are generally considered OER active centers,31 but the inherent low-valence of metal Ni seriously deteriorates its OER activity. How to optimize the adsorption capacity of metal Ni to H2O and O-containing substances is critical to optimize the HER and OER activity.
The adsorption and desorption behavior of intermediates is related to the surface electronic structure of catalysts.32 Various carbon material encapsulated metals33–35 and composite catalysts28,36–38 have been developed to optimize the electronic structure of transition metals. Unfortunately, these strategies can only enhance the HER or OER activities in general, and a multi-step synthesis process is often required. Moreover, a multi-component catalyst also makes it difficult to identify the active sites. In contrast, heteroatom modification is a promising strategy to adjust the surface electronic configuration of transition metals without changing their composition,39 and different types of heteroatom modifications can improve the HER or OER activities, respectively. Recently, theoretical studies have disclosed that slightly oxidized Ni is more suitable for H adsorption.40 Non-metal atom modification may be a direct and effective method to adjust the charge state of Ni. Although a few studies have successfully prepared non-metallic modified transition metal catalysts and some progress has been made in the HER,39,41,42 developing a simple and operational synthesis method is still a great challenge. Furthermore, non-metallic modification displays little effect on OER performance. Single metal sites make it difficult to achieve the transformation of OER intermediates.29 A general strategy is to introduce another transition metal into metal Ni.43,44 The incorporated heterogeneous metal atoms can induce the electronic reconstruction of Ni and may serve as the adsorption site for O-containing substances. In this regard, considering the weak oxygen binding ability of Ni, the chemical couple of Ni with oxophilic transition metal atoms can modulate the oxygen binding capacity of the catalyst surface,45–47 thus enhancing the OER activity. However, the HER performance of Ni catalysts coupled with oxophilic transition metals is still inferior to that of Pt. Based on the above discussion, using moderate electronegativity non-metal atoms and oxophilic transition metal atoms to jointly regulate the electronic structure of Ni may be a feasible strategy to optimize the HER and OER activities, and eventually realize high-efficiency bifunctional water splitting.
Inspired by this thought and given the inferior catalytic activity, we adopted a one-step electrodeposition method to simultaneously introduce S and Fe to enhance the water splitting performance of the metal Ni catalyst (S–Fe–Ni). Benefitting from the adjustment of S and Fe, the S–Fe–Ni catalyst shows distinguished bifunctional catalytic performance with ultralow overpotentials of 25 mV and 89 mV for the HER and 200 mV and 235 mV for the OER at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 and is significantly superior to commercial catalysts. When used as the cathode and anode, it only needs 1.49 V to obtain 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the S–Fe–Ni catalyst displays super durability at 20 and 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h during the HER, the OER and water splitting. The experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of S and Fe induces electronic redistribution, generating high-valence metal sites. More importantly, oxophilic Fe atoms significantly enhance H2O adsorption, while S atoms accelerate the water dissociation process by pulling the H atom. In addition, the introduced S and Fe weaken the H adsorption of Ni, leading to an improvement in HER activity. The improvement in the OER is associated with the in situ derived NiFe hydroxyl oxide.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Physicochemical characterization

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of S–Fe–Ni, S–Ni, Fe–Ni and Ni powder catalysts. The S–Fe–Ni catalyst displays typical metallic nickel diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, which reflect the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of Ni (PDF #70-1849), and no detectable sulfides were formed. The S–Ni, Fe–Ni and Ni catalysts also show similar XRD patterns as S–Fe–Ni, but the diffraction peaks of S–Fe–Ni and S–Ni catalysts are broadened and the peaks at 51.8° and 76.4° are not obvious compared with those of Fe–Ni and Ni. According to the Debye–Scherrer formula, the calculated crystallite size of S–Fe–Ni and S–Ni is 3.6 nm and 3.2 nm, respectively. The smaller crystallite size may be induced by the adsorption of thiourea on the generated nanoparticles, which inhibits the growth of the nanoparticles and reduces the crystallinity.48–50 The smaller crystallite size and poor long-range ordering result in broadened diffraction peaks. Moreover, the adsorbed thiourea on Ni nanoparticles can be reduced at the reduction potential of the electrodeposition process and finally formed the S–Fe–Ni catalyst.49,51 In Raman spectra (Fig. 1b), a weak peak appears at about 325 cm−1 which is consistent with Ni–S vibration in Ni3S2 (Fig. S1†),52,53 indicating that the incorporated S is bonded with Ni. The weak peak intensity is attributed to the low content of S. The morphology of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The nanoparticles uniformly cover the surface of the NF skeleton and high-resolution SEM images demonstrate the flocculent surface of S–Fe–Ni nanoparticles (Fig. 1c, d and S2b†). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results based on SEM confirm that the atomic ratio of Ni, Fe and S is 64.6%, 8.3% and 16.1%, respectively (Fig. S2c and Table S1†). The S–Ni/NF catalyst displays a similar morphology to S–Fe–Ni/NF (Fig. S3†), while for Fe–Ni/NF and Ni/NF, a uniform layer of membrane catalyst covers NF, which is composed of closely arranged particles (Fig. S4 and S5†). The difference in morphology may be caused by the complexation of thiourea with Ni2+ or Fe3+ ions and the adsorption of thiourea on the freshly generated primary nanocrystals.48 The flocculent surface of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst is also confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1e). A lattice fringe of 0.205 nm appears in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of S–Fe–Ni, which reflects the (111) plane of Ni metal (Fig. 1f). In addition, the EDS elemental mapping demonstrates the uniform distribution of Ni, Fe and S elements in the catalyst (Fig. 1g).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is adopted to investigate the composition and surface electronic configurations of the prepared catalysts and their elemental contents are shown in Table S2.† For the Ni 2p spectrum, the Ni0 peaks (851.71 and 868.85 eV), Ni2+ peaks (855.01 and 872.66 eV) and a pair of satellite peaks (sat.) are indexed to the S–Fe–Ni catalyst.54 Similar results are observed for the S–Ni, Fe–Ni and Ni catalysts (Fig. 2a). However, the different ratios of Ni0 in Ni (46.7%), Fe–Ni (27.2%), S–Ni (13.9%) and S–Fe–Ni (12.4%) catalysts analyzed through the peak areas disclose that the incorporation of Fe and S appreciably regulate the electronic structure of Ni (Fig. 2d). For the Fe 2p spectra, the Fe0 peaks (707.15 and 719.70 eV) and Fe3+ peaks (711.31 and 724.66 eV) are observed in the S–Fe–Ni catalyst (Fig. 2b),55 and the ratio of Fe0 in S–Fe–Ni decreases compared with that in Fe–Ni, indicating the higher valence of Fe in S–Fe–Ni (Fig. 2e). For the S 2p spectra, the S 2p3/2 peak of S–Fe–Ni (161.16 eV) shifts 0.3 eV to lower binding energy compared with S–Ni, indicating the rich-electron states of S elements (Fig. 2c).56 The work function of Ni and Fe is 5.15 and 4.5, respectively, and the electronegativity of Ni and Fe is 1.91 and 1.83, respectively. When some Ni atoms are replaced by Fe atoms, the binding ability of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst to electrons is reduced, so that electrons can be easily transferred to S atoms to form the rich-electron states of S elements. For O 1s spectra, the incorporation of S reduces the content of lattice oxygen, which suggests that the increase of high-valence Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions is mainly attributed to the regulation of S (Fig. S6†). High oxidation states of Ni2+ and Fe3+ possess strong affinity for oxygen intermediates, and low oxidation metallic Ni0 has the advantage of bonding H,57,58 thus promoting the initial adsorption of OH in the OER and the conversion of O intermediates, as well as the adsorption and dissociation of H2O in the HER, which leads to the enhancement of the OER and HER activity.

2.2 HER performance of S–Fe–Ni/NF
The HER performance was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH with a typical three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 3a, the optimized S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 25 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst also exhibits a significantly reduced overpotential of 89 mV at 100 mA cm−2, which is superior to that of the S–Ni/NF (205 mV), Fe–Ni/NF (359 mV), Ni/NF (402 mV) and Pt/C/NF (157 mV) catalysts (Fig. 3c). Comfortingly, the HER performance of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst precedes those of most Ni-based catalysts (Table S3†). The reaction kinetics and rate-determining step (RDS) were analyzed through the Tafel slope. The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays a Tafel slope of 41.1 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of S–Ni/NF (75.0 mV dec−1), Fe–Ni/NF (82.5 mV dec−1), Ni/NF (121.7 mV dec−1) and Pt/C/NF (42.1 mV dec−1), disclosing the improved reaction kinetics and the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (Fig. 3b).59 Charge transfer kinetics was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After fitting the EIS curve with an equivalent circuit (Fig. S7a†), the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct, 0.93 Ω), which indicates the enhanced electrons transport efficiency (Fig. 3d, Table S4†). Moreover, the EIS curve of Pt/C/NF shows two semicircles and the high frequency semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance, while the low frequency semicircle corresponded to the impedance of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film between the electrode and the electrolyte, and its equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S7b.† In addition, the influence of deposition potentials and thiourea and Fe3+ concentrations on HER performance was also explored, and the catalyst prepared at 3.5 V with 2.5 M thiourea and 9 mM Fe3+ concentrations exhibits the best catalytic activity (Fig. S8–S10†).

(f) I–t curves of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst at 20 and 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h testing. 
To disclose the origin of the high activity, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was first assessed through double layer capacitance (Cdl). The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst demonstrates the largest Cdl of 3.5 mF cm−2, suggesting abundant catalytic active sites (Fig. 3e and S11†). Moreover, the ECSA-normalized polarization curves show the excellent inherent catalytic activity of S–Fe–Ni/NF which is higher than that of S–Ni/NF, but significantly higher than that of Fe–Ni/NF and Ni/NF catalysts, indicating that the introduced S greatly enhances the inherent activity of Ni (Fig. S12†). The mass normalized polarization curves also confirm the superior inherent catalytic activity of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst (Fig. S13†). In addition, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays the largest turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.38 s−1 at 100 mV, which further proves its superior inherent activity (Fig. S14†).60 A multicurrent chronopotentiometric curve was used to examine the stability of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst. The potential rapidly stabilizes and remains unchanged for 500 s at each step and eventually maintains the initial potential at 20 mA cm−2 after the multi-current test, which suggests the good mass transport ability and conductivity of S–Fe–Ni/NF (Fig. S15†). The long-term durability of all catalysts was evaluated through the i–t test at 20 mA cm−2 and the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays a negligible attenuation for 50 h, while S–Ni/NF, Fe–Ni/NF, Ni/NF and Pt/C/NF catalysts display severe attenuation (Fig. 3f and S16a†). The LSV curves of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst show a negligible change after the i–t test, which further confirms its excellent durability (Fig. S16b†). In addition, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays only a slight drop of 10% at 100 mA cm−2 after the 50 h test (Fig. 3f). XRD patterns and SEM and TEM images of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst after the HER process indicate that the structure and morphology maintain similarity with those of the initial state (Fig. S17–S19†). The excellent structure stability leads to excellent electrochemical durability.
2.3 OER performance of S–Fe–Ni/NF
Likewise, the OER activities were also evaluated in 1.0 M KOH. The CV curves were adopted to detect the activation information of Ni and Fe species in the OER process. As shown in Fig. S20,† the OER CV curves show an obvious Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation peak, indicating that the surface Ni was oxidized to higher valence of Ni species in the OER process. To eliminate the influence of the oxidation peak on overpotential reading, a negative scan of LSV curves was performed to evaluate the catalytic activity. The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst displays excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Even at 100 mA cm−2, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst also possesses an ultralow overpotential of 235 mV, which is superior to that of S–Ni/NF (358 mV), Fe–Ni/NF (287 mV), Ni/NF (493 mV) and RuO2/C/NF (466 mV) catalysts (Fig. 4a and c), implying its super OER performance. Moreover, this performance precedes that of most Ni-based catalysts (Table S5†). The markedly reduced Tafel slope of S–Fe–Ni/NF (31.4 mV dec−1) and Fe–Ni/NF (33.8 mV dec−1) suggests that the incorporation of Fe enhances the catalytic kinetics, and the third electron transfer step determines the reaction rate (Fig. 4b).61 The improved reaction kinetics may be related to the increased high-valence metal sites and the optimized O intermediate affinity. The EIS and fitting results disclose that the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst has excellent electrical conductivity (Fig. 4d and Table S6†). To optimize the synthesis process, the deposition potentials and thiourea and Fe3+ concentrations were optimized based on the OER catalytic performance, and the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst exhibits outstanding activity for the OER process (Fig. S21–S23†).

(f) I–t curves of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst at 20 and 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h testing. 
To disclose the origin of the high OER performance, the ECSA of contrast samples was evaluated (Fig. 4e and S24†). The S–Fe–Ni/NF (14.1 mF cm−2) and S–Ni/NF (21.4 mF cm−2) catalysts show higher Cdl than Fe–Ni/NF (5.4 mF cm−2) and Ni/NF (7.8 mF cm−2), suggesting the higher active surface area. The ECSA-normalized polarization curves show that the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst has the highest inherent activity and Fe–Ni/NF is the second, indicating that the improved OER performance is mainly attributed to Fe (Fig. S25†). Moreover, the mass normalized LSV curves and the lowest overpotential at a TOF value of 0.1 s−1 further confirm the excellent inherent activity of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst (Fig. S26 and S27†). In addition, the multicurrent chronopotentiometric curve suggests the high mass transport ability and conductivity of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst (Fig. S28†). The long-term durability curves are shown in Fig. 4f and S29.† The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst remains stable for more than 50 h, and the LSV curve displays a slight attenuation after the i–t test, while the other catalysts show significant attenuation, implying the excellent stability of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst. Even at 100 mA cm−2, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst remains stable for more than 50 h (Fig. 4f). The XRD pattern of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst after the OER is still isostructural to that of metal Ni (Fig. S17†), and a more obvious flocculent surface around the S–Fe–Ni particles is observed in SEM and TEM images (Fig. S30 and S31a†). The HRTEM image further confirms that the inside of the nanoparticles remains in the metal phase, while the flocks at the edges are transformed into the NiOOH phase (Fig. S31b†). The SEM-EDS results show that the atomic content of S is 13.6% after the OER (Table S1†). These results indicate that the surface layer of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst is reconstructed to form S-doped NiFe hydroxyl oxide, which is considered to be the true active site.62
Considering that thiourea may be adsorbed on the catalysts during synthesis, in order to explore the role of thiourea adsorption on the samples, Fe–Ni/NF and Ni/NF, for which TU was not added to the electrolyte during the synthesis process, were immersed in 2.5 M TU solution to adsorb the thiourea molecules on their surface. Considering the synthesis process of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst, the thiourea molecules can be adsorbed on the freshly generated primary Ni nanocrystallites and they were reduced to form S2− at reduction potential. Combined with being washed with deionized water and ethanol after the deposition, only a few thiourea molecules were adsorbed on the surface of S–Fe–Ni/NF. Similarly, after immersing in TU solution, Fe–Ni/NF and Ni/NF were washed with deionized water and ethanol, so that the thiourea content is similar to that of S–Fe–Ni/NF or may not have much difference. According to the experimental results (Fig. S32†), both the HER and OER performances of Fe–Ni/NF and Ni/NF are decreased after immersing in 2.5 M TU solution, indicating that the adsorption of thiourea is not conducive to the improvement of catalytic activity. Therefore, the improvement in the catalytic performance of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst mainly originated from the introduction of S, rather than the synergistic effect between the TU molecule and S–Fe–Ni/NF.
2.4 Insight into the superior electrocatalytic activity
According to the reaction process, the alkaline HER involves the adsorption of H2O molecules and H and dissociation of H2O molecules, while the alkaline OER process refers to the OH− adsorption and the conversion of intermediates. Therefore, optimizing the adsorption capacity of catalysts for O-containing substances is crucial to enhance the HER and OER performance. The OH binding energy was evaluated through electrochemical OH chemisorption and a lower anodic peak potential indicates stronger OH binding.63,64 The peak potential of S–Fe–Ni/NF (0.261 V) is lower than that of Fe–Ni/NF (0.268 V), S–Ni/NF (0.390 V) and Ni/NF (0.415 V) catalysts, suggesting the enhanced OH binding capacity of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst (Fig. S33†). It is worth noting that the enhancement of OH binding ability mainly results from the incorporation of Fe. Water adsorption follows the same rule with OH species under dynamic conditions.63 Furthermore, the RDS is analyzed through the Tafel slope. For the HER, the Tafel slope of the Ni/NF catalyst suggests that adsorption and dissociation of the H2O molecule is the RDS. The significantly decreased Tafel slope of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst indicates that the introduction of Fe and S facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of H2O.59 For the OER, the smaller Tafel slope of Fe–Ni/NF, S–Ni/NF and S–Fe–Ni/NF catalysts suggests that the incorporation of Fe and S enhances the adsorption of OH− and the conversion efficiency of O-containing intermediates, thus changing the RDS.61 Moreover, S–Fe–Ni/NF and Fe–Ni/NF catalysts possess approximately the same Tafel slope, which further confirms that Fe is mainly responsible for the enhanced OER activity and reaction kinetics.
To further elucidate the origin of the outstanding HER activity, the electronic structure and the relevant adsorption energy of S–Fe–Ni and Ni were explored using DFT calculations. Ni (111) was adopted to model the Ni catalyst and the surface of S–Fe–Ni was simulated by replacing the Ni atom with an Fe atom and adsorbing a S atom on the hollow sites of the Ni (111) surface (Fig. S34†). The electronic structure was first analyzed through differential charge density. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the incorporated S atom induces electron transfer from the surrounding Ni atoms to the S atom, resulting in the formation of an electron-deficient Ni atom center and electron-rich S atom center. This result is consistent with the XPS results that the introduction of a S atom causes part of Ni0 to lose electrons and convert into Ni2+, which does not cause significant changes in the peak position of Ni0, but induces an increase in Ni2+ contents (Fig. 2a and d). Moreover, in the vicinity of the Fe atom, electrons are transferred from the Ni–Fe bonding region to the Fe atom, thus forming an electron-deficient ring at the bonding center of the Ni atoms and the Fe atom. These results reveal that S and Fe induce the electron reconstruction of Ni. In addition, the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules often limit the alkaline HER activity of the catalysts. The H2O is adsorbed at a top Ni site on the Ni (111) with an adsorption energy (ΔE) of −0.35 eV. However, on the S–Fe–Ni surface, the H2O is adsorbed at the top Fe site with a significantly reduced ΔE of −0.73 eV, which indicates that the introduction of an Fe atom greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of H2O for the S–Fe–Ni catalyst (Fig. 5c). In the optimized H2O adsorption model, the O–H bonds of H2O adsorbed on S–Fe–Ni are 0.9786 and 0.9863 Å, disclosing stronger bond polarization compared with H2O adsorbed on Ni (111), which is conducive to the dissociation of H2O molecules (Fig. 5d). The O–H bond pointing to the S atom has longer bond length, which is related to the S atom pulling the H atom in the O–H. The charge density distributions of S–Fe–Ni and Ni (111) after H2O adsorption show that a large number of electrons are accumulated on H2O due to the strong electronegativity of O (Fig. 5e). Further Bader charge calculations show that the charge of the S atom increases from +0.4305 to +0.5017 after the adsorption of H2O, indicating that the S atom has electronic interaction with H atoms in H2O, which facilitates the breaking of the O–H bond (Fig. S35†). Considering that the H atom is preferentially adsorbed on the hollow site of Ni (111),54 we calculated the free energy of H* (ΔGH*) on the fcc hollow of the Ni (111) surface (Ni_fcc), the different hollows of S–Fe–Ni (Ni_1, Ni_2 and Ni_3) and the S sites (S_1 and S_2). As shown in Fig. S36† and 5f, the ΔGH* of S–Fe–Ni at Ni_1 (−0.261 eV), Ni_2 (−0.353 eV) and Ni_3 (−0.349 eV) is much lower than that of Ni_fcc (−0.497 eV), implying the weakened H adsorption energy of S–Fe–Ni. Moreover, the Ni_2 and Ni_3 hollows away from the Fe atom display similar ΔGH*, but are higher than the Ni_1 hollow. The optimal H adsorption site is adjacent to the Fe atom, suggesting that S and Fe atoms are responsible for the reduced H adsorption energy on the S–Fe–Ni surface.

The surface reconstruction has been discovered during HER and OER processes and the reconstruction of catalysts can form real reactive species to enhance the catalytic performance. Therefore, the XPS spectra of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst after the durability test at 20 mA cm−2 were investigated (Fig. 6 and S37†). For the HER process, the metal substance in catalysts will be reduced to lower valence state species under negative potential conditions, accompanied by the corresponding reduction of anion contents.65 This reconstruction phenomenon during the HER process has been observed in sulfides and phosphides.66,67 In the O 1s spectra (Fig. 6d), the metal–O content of initial S–Fe–Ni is 4.23%, which is related to the oxidation of metal atoms on the surface of the catalyst by adsorbing oxygen molecules in the air. After the long-term HER test, the contents of S elements for S–Fe–Ni/NF obtained from XPS measurement decrease from the initial 10.02% to 5.54% (Table S2†), while this change is 16.1% to 14.6% based on the SEM-EDS measurement (Table S1†), indicating that some of the surface S atoms were dissolved during the HER test. More importantly, the oxidized pristine catalyst in the air was reduced at the reduction potential. These results indicate that more highly active Ni and Fe atomic layers on the catalyst surface were exposed. After the long-term stability test, due to the inevitable exposure of the catalyst to air, more oxygen molecules are absorbed on the highly active Ni and Fe atomic layers, resulting in a significant increase in the metal–O content from the initial 4.23% to 11.23%. It is also because of the surface reconstruction of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst that the ratio of Ni0 and Fe0 increases and the S contents obtained from XPS measurement are decreased. For the OER process, a dynamic surface reconstruction of catalysts during the OER process has been widely observed and it is generally proved that the surface phase of catalysts transforms into highly active oxyhydroxides at oxidation potential.68,69 Especially in non-oxide electrocatalysts, a large amount of surface non-metallic ions can be leached.17 Due to the surface reconstruction of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst during the OER process, it is the disappearance of Ni0 and appearance of Ni3+ on the S–Fe–Ni surface, the increase of the Fe3+ ratio and the enhancement of M–O bonds from the initial 4.23% to 9.79% that indicate the formation of NiFe oxyhydroxide on the catalyst surface.70 Moreover, the S contents obtained from XPS measurement are decreased from the initial 10.02% to 0.42% (Table S2†), indicating the leaching of surface S atoms and partial surface phase conversion to NiFe oxyhydroxide. In addition, the S contents change from the initial 16.1% to 14.6% after the HER long-term test and 13.6% after the OER long-term test based on the SEM-EDS measurement (Table S1†), which indicates that the leaching of S atoms may occur on the surface of the catalyst due to the surface reconstruction. Moreover, the Raman spectrum of S–Fe–Ni after the HER long-term durability test displays a similar peak at about 325 cm−1 to the initial S–Fe–Ni catalyst. However, two new characteristic vibrations appear at 477 and 548 cm−1 after the OER process which match well with the Eg and A1g vibration mode of Ni–O in NiOOH, further confirming the formation of S-doped NiFe hydroxyl oxide (Fig. S38†).71 Based on the above analysis, we propose the reaction mechanism of the S–Fe–Ni catalyst for the HER and OER, as shown in Fig. 7. For the HER process, the Fe sites improve the H2O adsorption and the S atoms pull the H atom in the O–H, which synergistically promotes the cleavage of H–OH bonds. Moreover, S and Fe atoms reduce the H adsorption energy on the S–Fe–Ni surface. For the OER process, S-doped NiFe hydroxyl oxide converted from the S–Fe–Ni catalyst has strong OH− adsorption,72 and the in situ formed interface of S–Fe–Ni and derived NiFe hydroxyl oxide could facilitate the deprotonation of *OH and stabilize the *OOH intermediate, thus enhancing alkaline OER performance.

2.5 Electrocatalytic water splitting of S–Fe–Ni/NF
Inspired by its superior catalytic activity, the water electrolysis activity of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst was assessed in a two-electrode cell (Fig. 8a). The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst shows high performance with an ultralow voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm−2, which is much superior to that of S–Ni/NF (1.68 V), Fe–Ni/NF (1.74 V), Ni/NF (1.85 V) and Pt/C‖RuO2/C/NF (1.63 V) catalysts (Fig. 8b and c), even better than most Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S7†). The S–Fe–Ni/NF couple can also be powered through a 1.5 V battery and lots of bubbles are observed on both sides (Video S1†). Moreover, a solar cell driven overall water splitting device was designed and plenty of bubbles can be observed under sunlight (Fig. 8d and Video S2†), indicating that the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst that converts unstable solar energy into clean and efficient hydrogen energy. In addition, the Faraday efficiency (FE) of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst was evaluated at 100 mA cm−2 and the volumes of H2 and O2 were recorded every 200 s (Fig. S39†). The recorded volumes approach the calculated values, and the volume ratio of O2 to H2 is approximately 1:2, revealing the high FE (98.2%) of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst (Fig. 8e). Moreover, the S–Fe–Ni/NF couple exhibits excellent stability at 20 mA cm−2 with a negligible attenuation (Fig. 8f), while Pt/C/NF‖RuO2/C/NF shows a drop of 33% (Fig. S40a†). The LSV curves of the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst also show a negligible change after the i–t test, which further confirms its super durability (Fig. S40b†). Even at 100 mA cm−2, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst maintains stability for more than 50 h and a low attenuation of 6% (Fig. 8f). Therefore, the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst can serve as a potential bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis with superior performance.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we rationally designed a non-metallic S and oxyphilic transition metal Fe co-regulated Ni metal as a bifunctional catalyst for water splitting through a facile one-step electrodeposition method. The S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst delivers low overpotentials of 25 mV and 89 mV for the HER and 200 mV and 235 mV for the OER at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 with superior stability, respectively. The introduction of S and Fe tailors the electronic structure of Ni metal, and the improvement of the HER is related to the optimization of water and hydrogen intermediate adsorption and the enhancement of the OER is associated with the in situ derived S doped NiFe hydroxyl oxide. More importantly, when the S–Fe–Ni/NF catalyst is applied in an alkaline electrolyzer, only 1.49 V is needed to obtain 10 mA cm−2, and hydrogen can also be obtained through an assembled solar-driven alkaline electrolyzer. This work has positive significance for promoting the large-scale application of hydrogen generation through water splitting and provides new insights into designing transition metal bifunctional catalysts for water splitting.
