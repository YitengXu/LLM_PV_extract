    , Accepted 17th June 2013First published on 17th June 2013AbstractSb-based semiconductors incorporating heterostructures of InP, InAs, AlSb, InSb, GaSb, InGaAs, InGaSb, GaAsSb and InGaAsSb can be used for high speed, low power applications such as wide-bandwidth telecommunications for aircraft, satellites, wireless communication, and global positioning systems, as well as thermophotovoltaic cells, THz medical imaging and remote sensing, IR sensors for space exploration, high resolution biomedical spectroscopy and military systems, including security scanners. Sb-based electronic devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) offer high speed, low power consumption and good breakdown voltages. High electron mobility InAs/AlSb or InSb/AlSb and high hole mobility InGaSb/AlSb quantum well heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) have also been widely pursued for THz amplifiers and high speed complementary logic circuits.
Introduction
Lower power alternatives to Si electronics are attractive in many emerging applications, such as for space exploration or even consumer electronics that increasingly operate from battery supplies. The density and computing power of integrated circuits are now limited primarily by power-dissipation concerns. While the shrinking of feature sizes of individual transistors has reduced power consumption at that level, the increasing transistor count has led to an increase in the overall power consumption of a personal computer at a rate of about 22% per year.
One promising option for low power electronics is transistors based on antimonide compound semiconductors. GaSb has a bandgap of 0.72 eV, while InSb has a bandgap of 0.17 eV (an electron mobility of almost 80000 cm2 V−1 s−1);1 making alloys of these materials are one of the most promising choices for low power electronics. Their development has been identified as a priority in the recent RSC report “Chemistry for Tomorrow's World”.2 Significant progress has also been made in the fabrication of In(Ga)AsSb, InGaAs and GaSb thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells.3,4 In TPV power systems, combustion-driven radiant sources are utilized for the generation of electricity. During energy conversion, TPV cells convert part of the thermal radiation emitted by a combustion-heated radiator into electricity. The photon energy of the selected part of radiation should be matched to the bandgap of the cells. Low bandgap TPV cells are preferred, since they utilize a greater portion of radiation from the thermal radiator in the temperature range of interest.
Besides, InSb has the largest electron magnetic moment among all the III–V semiconductors.5 Research for spintronics and spin-based quantum information has been pursued based on InSb nanostructures (nanowires).6–8 Sb-based glassy semiconductors are another group of materials that attract much attention lately.9 The chalcogenide glasses have a rapid reversible phase transition between the crystalline state and the glassy (amorphous) state, which is suitable for acoustic-optic devices, optical memory and phase change random access memory in particular.10,11
The binary semiconductor GaSb devices were originally developed for GaAs/GaSb tandem solar cells. GaSb TPV cells can be fabricated using a simple diffusion process that is conducive to large volume production. Low bandgap In(Ga)AsSb and InGaAs cells are also of considerable interest. Recent research has also shown that a very small amount of Sb (typically less than 1% of Sb composition) is effective for improving the optical properties of GaInNAs films and beneficial to GaInP/Ga(In)As/GaInNAs(Sb)/Ge quadruple junction solar cells.12 These quaternary and ternary semiconductors are mostly grown from epitaxial methods such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).13–15
One of the most promising applications of high speed, low power electronics is THz imaging and sensing.16,17 Narrow direct band gap semiconductors such as InSb, InAs, GaSb and InAsSb are particularly rich sources of optically excited THz radiation. At THz frequencies, it is possible to image concealed objects in security, quality control, non-destructive evaluation applications and can also provide more details in medical applications.
Extensive progress has also been made lately in Sb-based low power electronic devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) and heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs). This paper reviews progress in the design, growth, fabrication, and performance of these low-power electronic devices, including discussion of the authors' recent results.
Sb-based heterojunction bipolar transistors
(a) Background
For the past two decades, InP-based HBTs have attracted great interest for use in very high frequency applications such as 40 Gb s−1 optical communication systems.18–28 The use of double heterostructures based on InP material systems has allowed larger breakdown voltages and bandwidths than was possible for SiGe bipolar transistors. Recently, aggressively scaled InP/InGaAs single heterojunction bipolar transistors (SHBTs) and InP double heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs) have exhibited record current gain cutoff frequencies (fT) and power gain cutoff frequencies (fMAX) as high as 765 GHz and 1 THz, respectively.29,30
The relationship between the bandgap and the lattice constant in the InP material system is shown in Fig. 1. There have been several configurations proposed for InP-based HBTs. Among the high speed HBTs invented to date, InP-based HBTs with Sb-based semiconductor bases, such as GaAsSb and InGaAsSb, have lately received a great deal of attention because of the excellent dc and microwave performance associated with the type-II band alignment at the base/collector (B/C) junction. The use of a GaAsSb base layer in these structures relaxes the requirement for a composition-graded layer and suppresses the current blocking effect that is frequently observed in In0.53Ga0.47As/InP DHBTs. The band alignments of InP-based HBTs with an InxGa1−xAs1−ySby base are illustrated in Fig. 2.31–33 Type-II InP/GaAsSb DHBTs have exhibited a maximum fT of over 500 GHz and Johnson's figure of merit of over 2300 GHz V.34 This excellent performance can be attributed to their capability for high current operation resulting from their staggered band alignment at the base/collector (B/C) junction. However, the negative conduction band offset (ΔEc < 0) at the GaAs0.51Sb0.49/InP heterojunction affects electron transport and has a detrimental influence on the current gain due to the accumulation of electrons and field inversion at the type-II GaAs0.51Sb0.49/InP base/emitter (B/E) junction.35 Replacing the GaAsSb base by an InGaAsSb base to form InP/InGaAsSb/InGaAs double heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs) allows one to overcome the electron accumulation issue because the base-emitter junction becomes a type-I heterojunction. The reduced bandgap of the InGaAsSb base also results in a lower B/E turn-on voltage (VBE) as well as an emitter/collector bias voltage (VCE).36–38

Another reason that InGaAsSb is an attractive choice for the base material of InP-based HBTs is that it offers flexibility in adjusting the strain, which affects the band structure of the devices. As an example, the energy band diagrams of a relaxed (unstrained) and a tensilely strained In0.37Ga0.63As0.88Sb0.12 layer grown on InP substrates are illustrated in Fig. 3. The energy bandgap of the In0.37Ga0.63As0.88Sb0.12 strained base layer is estimated to be 0.634 eV, smaller than 0.684 eV for the relaxed one. This strain induced bandgap shrinkage increases the valence band offset of the E/B junction and prevents the back injection of holes from the base to the emitter, subsequently improving the electron injection efficiency. Several important device properties, including low turn-on voltage, high average electron velocity, long minority carrier lifetime, and low specific contact resistivity, have been demonstrated.39,40 These unique properties make the InGaAsSb base DHBTs very attractive for low-power terahertz (THz) devices.

(b) InP/InGaAsSb/InGaAs HBTs
To understand the advantages of Sb-based HBTs, the design and characteristics of pseudomorphic InP/In0.37Ga0.63As0.89Sb0.11/In0.53Ga0.47As HBT devices are discussed. The epilayers are typically grown on Fe-doped semi-insulating (100) InP substrates in a solid-source MBE system equipped with arsenic, phosphorus and antimony valve cracker cells. Silicon and beryllium are utilized as the n-type and p-type dopants, respectively. The DHBT layer structure consists of an n-type InGaAs collector, a p-type InGaAsSb base, an n-type InP emitter and an n-type InGaAs emitter cap. During the MBE growth, a streaky reflection high energy electron diffraction pattern (RHEED) persists, indicating that the pseudomorphic InGaAsSb base layer is fully strained in the DHBT. After growth, a single X-ray diffraction peak is used to confirm the existence of a clear oscillation fringe to ensure that high-quality InGaAsSb can be grown on InP without phase separation.
The incorporation of Sb into the InGaAs base reduces the conduction band offset of the type-I InP/InGaAsSb E/B junction and introduces a conduction band offset to form a type-II InGaAsSb/InGaAs B/C junction. The reduction of the conduction band offset and the increase in the valence band offset of the E/B junction are apparent, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The turn-on voltage of the In0.37Ga0.63As0.89Sb0.11 base DHBTs decreases to as low as 0.35 V at a current density of 1 A cm−2 while that of the conventional InP/InGaAs SHBT is 0.51 V at the same current density. Since the forward voltage is proportional to the bandgap of the base material and the discontinuity of the conduction band, when the Sb mole fraction increases to 27%, the InGaAsSb base DHBTs show a low turn-on voltage of 0.32 V, one of the lowest values reported for InP-based HBTs, as can be seen in Fig. 4(b).

The use of a type-II InGaAsSb/InGaAs B/C junction for high current density and high-speed operation is desirable as the band lineup mitigates the current-blocking effect, as well as the Kirk effect.41 In combination with a low E/B turn-on voltage, a collector-emitter offset voltage VCE,offset as small as 43 mV is achieved which can be compared with the value of 320 mV for InP/InGaAs DHBTs in the common-emitter output characteristics as shown in Fig. 5(a). An open-base breakdown voltage (BVCEO) of more than 4 V at Ic = 1 kA cm−2 indicates that the InGaAsSb base does not affect the breakdown voltage as long as a high-quality InGaAsSb/InGaAs B/C structure is grown. The high current capability of this device is also demonstrated in Fig. 5(a), as a low-knee voltage of 0.5 V is obtained at a current density of 650 kA cm−2. Higher current handling capability is also expected and reflected in the microwave characteristics shown in Fig. 5(b), with fT plotted as a function of the collector current density for HBTs with either an InGaAsSb or an InGaAs base. The InGaAsSb DHBT with a 42 nm base exhibits a peak fT of 238 GHz at a collector current density of 621 kA cm−2 as compared to the peak fT of 222 GHz at 463 kA cm−2 obtained for the conventional InGaAs SHBT. The improved current handling capability also indicates that the InGaAsSb DHBT structure is able to maintain this high frequency performance for an even larger base width. This is in part because of the higher average electron velocity in the collector (3.5 × 107 cm s−1). This value compares favourably to that of the conventional InGaAs SHBTs.

(c) InAlAs/InGaAsSb/InGaAs HBTs
As described in the previous section, InP/InGaAsSb/InGaAs DHBTs, with type-I E/B and type-II B/C junctions, exhibit high current gain, low turn-on voltage and high collector current. The current gain of the InGaAsSb base DHBTs shows a weak dependence on both emitter size and doping concentration. This unique behavior is both intriguing and desired because the current millimeter-wave DHBTs suffer from insufficient current gain when a heavily doped base is used. It is also found that DHBTs with an InAlAs emitter would enable a high mole fraction of Sb in the base while maintaining a type-I E/B junction and a type-II B/C junction for the HBTs. For instance, the higher valence band offset at the type-I In0.52Al0.48As/In0.42Ga0.58As0.78Sb0.15 E/B junction prevents the injection of holes from the base to the In0.52Al0.48As emitter, leading to higher electron injection efficiency. Furthermore, the type-II staggered band alignment of the In0.42Ga0.58As0.78Sb0.15/In0.53Ga0.47As (B/C) junction increases the current operation capability due to the postponed Kirk effect. To achieve even higher speed operation with InGaAsSb DHBTs, it is essential not only to decrease the base and collector transit time through the layer structure design and wafer growth quality, but also to reduce the emitter size, parasitic resistance and capacitance through the device layout design and size scaling, simultaneously.

Fig. 6(a) shows the Gummel plot and common-emitter current gain of a sub-micron emitter (0.65 × 8.65 μm2) In0.42Ga0.58As0.78Sb0.15 DHBT. The low value of the base current ideality factor of 1.41 confirms the benefit of replacing the type-II E/B junction by the type-I E/B junction, which helps to alleviate the electron pile-up effect and reduce the tunneling recombination current. The turn-on voltage can be reduced to as low as 0.38 V at a collector current density of 1 A cm−2, compared to the turn-on voltage of 0.5 V for the abrupt InP/InGaAs HBT. The Gummel plot also shows the high current gain β obtained with the scaled HBT, which is indicative of another unique property of the InAlAs/InGaAsSb/InP HBT. From time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, it is found that the minority carrier lifetime of the heavily doped InGaAsSb is higher than those of InGaAs and GaAsSb.42 This might account for the high current gain observed for HBTs with a heavily doped InGaAsSb base. For HBTs with a base thickness as thick as 44 nm and a base doping concentration as high as 6 × 1019 cm−3, a decent current gain of 50 at a collector current density of 35 kA cm−2 and the maximum current gain of 123.8 at a collector current density of 364.73 kA cm−2 are demonstrated. The common-emitter current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the InAlAs/InGaAsSb/InP HBT are shown in Fig. 6(b). The collector offset is only 0.25 V and the common-emitter breakdown voltage is 2.6 V for a collector current density of 1 kA cm−2.

The sub-micron InAlAs/InGaAsSb/InGaAs DHBT shows an fT and fMAX of 260 and 485 GHz, respectively, at a collector current density of 302 kA cm−2, as depicted in Fig. 7(a). The reported high frequency performance of various InP-based and SiGe HBTs is summarized in Fig. 7(b).43–48 The results indicate that InGaAsSb DHBTs have excellent potential for low power and high speed performance.

(d) Insignificant emitter size effect of InGaAsSb base HBTs
HBTs with an InGaAsSb base have been found to exhibit little emitter size effect because of their low surface recombination characteristics. This is a very desirable characteristic because the adverse emitter size effect is more pronounced in small devices and might reduce the current gain of THz HBTs.
The surface recombination current at the E/B junction comes mainly from the exposed base region near the intrinsic region. Due to the surface pinning effect, the conduction band is pulled downward near the exposed base region to form a low potential profile, which drives part of the electrons from the intrinsic base to the extrinsic base region to recombine with the holes. Increasing the Sb mole fraction of InGaAsSb in the base region causes the Fermi level pinning position to move toward the valence band edge and decreases the amount of downward conduction band bending at the exposed base, thus causing fewer electrons to be injected into the extrinsic base region.48
The emitter size effect, reflected in the dc current gain, of InGaAsSb base HBTs, is indeed weak and becomes weaker as the Sb content of the base increases, as shown in Fig. 8. Consequently, very low surface recombination velocities S are extracted from the experimental results of the InGaAsSb base HBTs. The deduced S is about one order of magnitude lower than that of HBTs with an InGaAs base. It is typical for compound semiconductors to have high surface recombination velocities in comparison to Si (∼10 cm s−1) and this can lead to problems in scaling devices to small dimensions because current can be lost in both lateral and vertical devices due to surface recombination. The InGaAsSb materials exhibit some of the lowest recombination velocities among the compound semiconductors, as shown in Table 1. The low S observed in the InGaAsSb base HBT strengthens its potential for use in low power electronics.49,50

Sb-based heterojunction field effect transistors
(a) Background
It is well known that Si integrated circuit technology has been developing following Moor's law since the law's inception. However, the operating voltage has not been scaled down accordingly which results in the increasing power density and chip temperature with the increased complexity and the decreased clock speed of the circuits. There is thus an urgent need to find a solution to significantly reduce the operating voltage without degrading the performance and density of integrated circuits. A few possible solutions to this issue have been proposed based on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS).55 While various efforts to improve Si FETs, including enhanced mobility via strain engineering, enhanced quasi-ballistic transport via short gate length and strain, high-k gate dielectric and metal gate electrode, still continue, high mobility channel materials such as III–V compounds also attract great interest.56
With small band gaps and effective masses in the bulk form and electron mobilities at room temperature in the range of 40000 to 77000 cm2 V−1 s−1, InAs and InSb hold the potential for very low-power, high-speed device applications, as summarized in Fig. 9. These Sb-based semiconductors, for a given electric field, will have at least 50 times higher velocity compared to Si. This means equal velocity can be demonstrated at very low operation voltage. Thus, there is a growing interest in improving the scaling of devices employing ultra-low gate length structures. Compared with the state-of-the-art Si FETs, Sb based high mobility HFETs show better improvement in intrinsic speed performance at the same power with an almost 10-fold reduction in power at the same performance.57 The FET has evolved so that the mobility dominates the transistor speed when the period of the FET gate length is of several microns. This means that the mobility with a low electric field is directly related to the electron transport speed. In modern FETs, the short gate lengths result in a high field in the channel and reduce the mobility and device performance. For an FET with a gate length of 30 nm, and a drain–source drop voltage of 0.5 V, the average field in the channel is 167 kV cm−1. The steady-state carrier velocity is going to be saturated at such a high current, and this saturation current plays an important role in terms of transistor speed for low power electronics. For InAs and InSb, a maximum carrier velocity of around 4 × 107 cm s−1 has been measured, in comparison with 107 cm s−1 for Si.1 Moreover, at high fields, there is no drastic drop in velocity in InAs and InSb as in the other III–V compounds such as GaAs, InP and InGaAs. Such high-speed performance in both low and high electric fields indicates that the Sb based compound semiconductor is the ultimate choice allowing for superb control of the electrostatics inside the channel.
 Fig. 9  Electron and hole mobility versus bandgap for different semiconductors. 
Quantum well (QW) Sb-based HFETs have a very large conduction band discontinuity like that of InAs/AlSb or InSb/AlSb heterostructures. This creates a strong confinement of electrons in the QW region.57–61 InAs/AlSb heterojunctions have sheet concentrations of ∼1012 cm−2 and electron mobilities of 20000–30000 cm−2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. InSb/AlSb heterojunctions also show a sheet concentration of 5.8 × 1011 cm−2 and electron mobilities of up to 50000 cm−2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. Reports indicate a simultaneously high peak fT of 220 GHz and 305 GHz for InAs/AlSb and InSb/AlSb heterostructures, respectively.62–88 Additionally, the Sb-based HFETs have achieved equivalent high-speed figures of merit performance with 5× to 10× lower dissipation compared to the case for the GaAs or InP material system, along with a reported low noise amplifier (LNA) demonstrating a 1.5 dB typical noise figure with an associated gain of 25 dB from 1–16 GHz at a low DC dissipation of 16 mW.89,90 A chart summarizing the Sb-based high electron mobility HFET mobility versus electron concentration is shown in Fig. 10(a).
 Fig. 10  (a) Electron mobility versus sheet density and (b) hole mobility versus sheet density for Sb-based quantum well heterostructures. 
There has also been interest in exploring the potential of Sb-based HFETs for advanced logic applications, which can enhance the digital circuit functionality. GaSb and InSb are the only compounds with a higher hole mobility than Si, as also shown in Fig. 10. The first report in 1990 demonstrated an Al0.9Sb0.1As/GaSb HFET with a hole mobility of 260 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a sheet carrier concentration of 1.8 × 1012 cm−2 at room temperature.91 The results revealed the possibility of utilizing GaSb in complementary circuits. By 2007, the hole mobility of InxGa1−xSb/Al(Ga)Sb heterostructures at room temperature was 1500 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a sheet carrier concentration of 7 × 1011 cm−2.92 The 0.2 μm gate length devices exhibited a maximum transconductance of 100 mS mm−1, and a maximum fT and fMAX of 19 GHz and 34 GHz, respectively.93 Others showed a 40 nm gate length InSb/InAlSb HFET, which exhibited a hole mobility as high as 1230 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a carrier concentration of 0.8 × 1012 cm−2 and a fT of 140 GHz accompanied by low dc power dissipation.94 A summary of the Sb-based high hole mobility HFET mobility versus hole concentration is shown in Fig. 10(b).92–99
(b) InAs(Sb)/AlSb high electron mobility HFETs
To gain insight into Sb-based HFETs, the design and characteristics of InAs/AlSb HFET devices are exhibited as an example. Fig. 11(a) shows the layer and device structure of an InAs/AlSb HFET. The InAs/AlSb HEMT materials were grown by solid-source MBE on a semi-insulating (001) GaAs substrate. The growth of thick AlSb and AlGaSb buffer layers is followed by the growth of InAsSb/AlSb HEMT active layers. The thick buffer layers were grown to accommodate a ∼7% lattice mismatch between the GaAs substrate and the antimonide materials. The HFET active layers consisted of an AlSb bottom barrier, an InAs channel, an AlSb top barrier and an InAlAs plus InAs cap. The as-grown wafer had a high room temperature mobility of 24800 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron sheet concentration of 1.73 × 1012 cm2. InAs/AlSb HFETs were fabricated by e-beam lithography processes to have 0.2 μm gate length. The drain–source saturation current (IDSS) at VDS = 0.4 V is 733 mA mm−1 and the corresponding output conductance (gDS) at this bias is 1660 mS mm−1. A peak transconductance (gm,peak) of 1520 mS mm−1 is obtained at VGS = −0.6 V and VDS = 0.4 V. A subthreshold swing (S.S.) of 128 mV dec−1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio of 1023 are obtained at VDS = 0.4 V. The high frequency performance with a cut-off frequency (fT) of 105 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 132 GHz were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 11(b).
 Fig. 11  (a) Layer and device structures of the InAs/AlSb quantum well HFET used in the example; (b) (left) drain–source I–V characteristics of a 0.2 μm InAs/AlSb n-channel HFET, and (right) cut-off frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) characteristics of the 0.2 μm gate-length InAs/AlSb n-channel HFET. 
InAs/AlSb HFETs showed very poor drain I–V characteristics and undesirable high drain currents that increased rapidly with increasing drain voltages. Large kink currents resulted in the drain biases being limited to below 0.4 V, affecting circuit designs. Approaches to improve breakdown or a suppressed kink current include the use of increased quantum confinement,100 composite channels,101,102 and InAsSb channels.72 The former two take advantage of materials with a larger effective energy bandgap to alleviate the impact ionization rate. Instead of InAs channels, the latter approach uses InAsSb as the channel material, which allows type-I band alignment with the AlSb barrier. Impact-ionized holes will be confined in the channel so they do not accumulate in the buffer layer. Moreover, n-type doping below the channel layer also provides a valence band potential in the substrate and inhibits holes accumulation in the buffer; thus kink currents are suppressed.103Fig. 12 shows a comparison of the common-source dc characteristics of an InAsSb/AlSb HFET with those of a conventional InAs/AlSb HFET. This InAsSb/AlSb HEMT for example had a marked reduction in dc output conductance at VDS ≥ 0.3 V. At VDS = 0.5 V and ID = 100 mA mm−1, the output conductance in the InAsSb/AlSb HEMT was 60 mS mm−1 compared with 400 mS mm−1 in the InAs/AlSb HEMT. The reduced output conductance was still estimated as 4.6 times larger than that in the InAsSb/AlSb HEMT. This significant improvement in output conductance was primarily due to the two features, the hole barrier potential in the buffer layer and the type-I lineup InAsSb channels in the proposed device structure. All impact-ionized holes were inhibited from accumulating in the buffer layer or going to the gate, being confined to the channel and finally collected by the source electrode.

Developing Sb-based metal-oxide–semiconductor field emission transistors (MOSFETs) is also another important task for low power electronics. Due to the lack of high quality insulator–semiconductor interface options, a lot of effort has been aimed at the development of gate dielectrics deposited on the III–V compounds, which include Ga2O3, Gd2O3, Al2O3, SiNx, and HfO2etc.104 The InAs MOS capacitors fabricated by composite oxides and SiO2 discussed in early studies have suffered from problems such as negative flat-band shift and large hysteresis, indicating high densities of both interface states and bulk fixed charges.105,106 Recent reports reveal results for InAs MOS capacitors and FETs, which were fabricated on a bulk InAs material using ALD-deposited Al2O3 dielectrics.107 A MOSFET with an MBE grown Gd2O3 layer for passivation is illustrated as an example. The interfacial density of states (Dit) was determined by the conductance method to have the low values of 1012 cm−2 eV−1 near the conduction band edge, as indicated by the circle dots in Fig. 13(a). There is an approximate 2 times reduction in Dit's for the case with the implementation of a MBE-Gd2O3 layer in the Dit spectra, indicating the effectiveness of MBE-Gd2O3 passivation. Furthermore, lower values in the Dit spectra suggest better device performances for Al2O3/Gd2O3/InAs. A comparison of the transfer characteristics for devices in these two cases at 77 K is shown in Fig. 13(b) and (c). It can be seen that the implementation of a MBE-Gd2O3 layer has clearly enhanced the transconductance from 4 to 60 μS μm−1 (at VDS = 1 V) for 12 μm gate length devices. The enhancement can be attributed to the lower Dit values near the conduction-band edge. For depletion-mode MOSFETs, the Fermi level near the conduction band edge will be driven back to the midgap to deplete the channel. Thus, lower Dit values will result in better control of the Fermi level, thus improving the device performance.108

(c) InGaSb/AlSb high hole mobility FETs
As mentioned above, there has been interest in the potential of III–V FETs for advanced logic applications to enhance the digital circuit functionality as an extension of Moore's law. Therefore, complementary circuits in an Sb-based material system are highly desirable.109 Some results have demonstrated the practicality of Sb-based compound semiconductor complementary logic circuits with balanced n-channel and p-channel HFETs.110,111 Challenges still remain in terms of enhancing the hole mobility of Sb-based p-channel HFETs.
In this section, we will discuss InGaSb p-channel HFETs as an example. Following the previous n-channel HFET buffer layers, an active region is contained in an AlSb bottom barrier layer, an In0.4Ga0.6Sb channel layer and an AlSb top barrier. In0.5Al0.5As and undoped InAs were also grown as the cap layers. A beryllium (Be) modulation doping sheet of ∼1 × 1012 cm−2 was applied 5 nm above the channel layer to further increase the hole concentration. The hole mobility was increased by high compressive strain provided by a large lattice mismatch of approximately 2.1% between the AlSb bottom barrier and the In0.4Ga0.6Sb channel layer, and an enhanced quantum confinement achieved using the thin 7.5 nm In0.4Ga0.6Sb channel layer. Both were applied to split degenerate heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) valence bands, thereby reducing the probability of hole interband scattering.92Fig. 14 shows the trends for the improvement of hole mobility by compressive strain achieved in our previous work.

A hole mobility as high as 1220 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a carrier concentration of 1.3 × 1012 cm−2 was achieved for InGaSb p-channel HFETs after growth of the optimized In0.4Ga0.6Sb/AlSb quantum-well materials. InGaSb/AlSb heterostructures were processed to create 2 μm gate length HFETs. The device exhibited a maximum drain current (ID,max) of 102 mA mm−1 at VDS = −3 V and VGS = −1 V, a peak gm of 92 mS mm−1 at VDS = −3 V and VGS = 0.4 V, and an on-state breakdown voltage in excess of 3 V. The pinch-off was observed for a 0.6 V gate bias at ID of 1 mA mm−1 at VDS = −0.5 V. A subthreshold swing (S. S.) of 149 mV dec−1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio of 351 were obtained at VDS = −3.0 V. A cut-off frequency (fT) of 15 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 20 GHz were obtained at VDS = −3.5 V and VGS = 0.4 V, as shown in Fig. 15.

(d) Sb-based high mobility FETs using a Si substrate
Although InAs(Sb)/AlSb QW HFETs have been successfully grown on GaAs substrates as mentioned previously, the growth of such heterostructures on Si substrates remains a challenge as a consequence of the numerous defects generated due to the substantial lattice mismatch (of approximately 12%) and inconsistent polarity between the two material systems. It is reported that a thick SiGe/Ge/GaAs stacked buffer layer (>6 μm) can be used to accommodate the lattice mismatch.68 However, the complicated thick buffer layer makes it difficult to practically integrate Sb-based devices with Si devices. To avoid using such a thick buffer layer, direct growth of a GaSb and/or AlSb buffer layer on Si without Si (Ge) and GaAs as an initial layer has been proposed.83,112–114 For example, a composite low-temperature (LT) grown AlSb/GaSb metamorphic buffer layer can effectively release the strain between GaSb and Si by forming 90° misfit dislocations, which would not penetrate to the active region of the devices. However, the AlSb/GaSb composite structure cannot completely prevent the formation of planar defects. Instead, a GaAsSb step-graded metamorphic is found effective in avoiding the formation of micro-twins and giving a smooth surface morphology. As a result, electron mobilities of up to 18100 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 39700 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be achieved at room temperature and 77 K, respectively.115
Conclusions and further developments
In the last decade, there has been rapid progress in the development of Sb-based low power electronics. The most impressive are the Sb-based HBTs for which fT and fMAX as high as 765 GHz and 1 THz have been recorded; Sb-based HFETs with n-channel mobilities of 20000–50000 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a high fT of up to 350 GHz and a p-channel mobility of up to 1500 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been demonstrated. Although Sb-based semiconductors have numerous advantages, there are many technical challenges that need to be overcome before they become the mainstream of future high-speed and low-power electronics. For Sb-based HBTs, there remain a few process issues in device scaling, such as surface leakage and emitter resistance issues. For Sb-based MISFETs, the lack of a stable gate dielectric for low gate leakage is a critical issue. A high-resistivity chemically stable buffer layer is another issue that remains to be resolved. Similar to the case of silicon-based transistors, the scalability of Sb-based transistors is necessary. A three-dimensional structure, such as FinFETs or nanowire FETs, will be needed to improve the electrical characteristics of Sb-based transistors with scaling.
For the widespread use of low power electronics based on Sb-based semiconductors the manufacturing cost is essential. It has to be lowered by using large substrates, low cost chemical precursors, and high throughput processes that are comparable to Si-based fabrication processes. For the materials chemistry and device communities, this means the development of pure and efficient precursors, novel heterostructure designs, improved growth conditions for high material quality, and compatible processing technologies for integration with Si integrated circuits.
