    , Accepted 17th September 2019First published on 17th September 2019AbstractCapacitive deionization (CDI) is an alternative water purification technology. Electrode materials are crucial for the deionization performance. However, the commonly used carbon electrode materials suffer from such issues as unsuitable porous structures, low conductivity and poor wettability, which limit their practical applications. Herein, we developed a cost-effective strategy to fabricate graphene nanosphere decorated N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks as highly-efficient electrode materials for CDI applications. The effects of unique morphology, chemical composition and N-doping were clarified by conducting controlled experiments. The obtained materials exhibit a layered porous sheet-like structure decorated with graphene nanospheres, large surface area, regular micro and mesopores channels and high-level N-doping (up to 10.56 at%). The obtained CDI electrode delivers high specific capacitance, fine wettability, fast ion diffusion and excellent charge transfer ability. A high salt removal capacity (23.42 mg g−1) with a high removal rate has been demonstrated at 1.2 V in a 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution, indicating the synergistic effect of N-doping and special morphological structures on the improvement of CDI performance. Besides, the obtained CDI electrode also presents good deionization stability over multi-regeneration cycles and the desalination efficiency is up to 90%. The results presented in this work open a new avenue for the development of highly efficient desalination of saline water.

Environmental significance
Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an alternative and energy efficient water purification technology, which consumes low energy to produce potable water. Electrode materials are quite crucial for the deionization performance. However, the commonly used carbon electrode materials suffer from such issues as unsuitable porous structures, low conductivity and poor wettability, which limit their practical applications. To solve such issues, herein, we developed a cost-effective strategy to fabricate graphene nanosphere decorated N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks as highly-efficient electrode materials for CDI applications. Owing to their high-level N-doping, high specific capacitance, fast ion diffusion and excellent charge transfer ability, our GNNLMCS exhibit the highest salt removal capacity (23.42 mg g−1) with fast salt removal rates and good desalination efficiency (90%). The extraordinary CDI performance indicates the synergistic effect of N-doping and well-interconnected mesoporous structures of the GNNLMCS, which opens a new avenue for the development of highly efficient desalination of saline water.

Introduction
In addition to the food and energy crisis, water scarcity is also one of the main global problems in worldwide, which affects millions of people.1,2 In recent years, these issues have worsened due to rapid growth of population, environmental pollution and drastic climatic changes. Research scientists have paid great attention to renewable energy storage fields such as wind energy, hydropower, solar and nuclear power cells, etc.3,4 In order to obtain potable water from seawater, desalination played a crucial role due to the unlimited ocean water source.5,6 Technological innovations have made saltwater desalination a reality for increasing the supply of fresh water in the world. Generally, common desalination technologies include electrodialysis,7,8 thermal distillation,9,10 reverse osmosis (RO)11,12 and capacitive deionization (CDI).13–16 The ever-growing demand for energy saving and fresh water requires a new desalination strategy with lower cost, economic energy consumption, abundant material resources, higher deionization capacity and environmentally-friendly features. CDI is regarded as a novel and promising alternative technology due to its simple operative process, low applied voltage (<2 V), low energy consumption, cost-effectiveness, prevention of secondary pollution and easy regeneration of electrodes and use for removal of charged species from sea water and brackish water.17,18
To date, the most commonly used porous carbon electrodes consist of activated carbon (AC),19 carbon nanotubes,20,21 ordered mesoporous carbon,22 metal–organic framework derived nanoporous carbon,23–27 carbon aerogel,28,29 graphene30–32 and composites of these materials. In addition, hollow carbon spheres have extensively received great attention in many fields such as drug delivery,33 catalysis,34 energy storage35 and adsorption,36 because of their unique architecture, low specific density, high specific surface area (SSA), reduced charge diffusion resistance and meso and micropores on the hollow spheres. Moreover, graphene coated carbon spheres were synthesized by a soft template process.37 The high conductivity and unique 3D mesoporous structure of the resultant carbon materials can facilitate the charge transfer ability and salt ion transport in CDI applications. Li et al. designed N-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres and achieved a high desalination capacity (SAC) of 16.6 mg g−1.38 Zhang et al. reported 3D graphene spheres and graphene-sheet spheres and attained high salt removal capacity.39 Pan et al. reported 3D graphene sponge and N-doped graphene based electrodes and attained a high desalination performance (14.9 mg g−1 and 21 mg g−1).40,41 Based on the above descriptions, graphene coated carbon spheres still exhibit some undesirable properties, which greatly restrict their electrosorption performance.
Recently, hierarchically mesoporous carbons with both micropores and mesopores have also enabled salt ion transport by delivering reduced electrical resistances and smaller diffusion pathways and have been believed to be favored for CDI application.42 Mesopores enable fast ion electrosorption but smaller resistant pathways for salt ion transport through the framework; micropores not only provide large active sites but also minimize ion diffusion distances.43,44 A mesoporous carbon with an SAC of 15.2 mg g−1 and 3D carbon sponge exhibited a salt removal capacity of 8.6 mg g−1 but their desalination rates were not sufficiently high and left possibility for forthcoming development and improvement.45–47 Currently, a prominent alternative is to develop and design hybrid composites of graphene spheres and porous carbon as electrode materials, which exhibit improved performance compared to simple graphene, due to synergistic effects of graphene sphere and porous carbon.48,49 Therefore, more efforts have been required to explore the synthesis and rational design of graphene sphere and porous carbon hybrid composites with a hierarchical porous structure and explore their CDI performance.
In this work, we report a new strategy to fabricate graphene nanosphere decorated N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks (GNNLMCS) and it is reasonable to predict that the desired GNNLMCS should not only maintain a favourable porous layered structure but also possess unique features for CDI applications, for instance good electrical conductivity, high SSA and well-defined pore volumes. For this framework, firstly, we prepared pillaring N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks (NLMCS) by using a simple sodium carbonate-urea-based process and glucose is used as the carbon precursor. Secondly, a porous carbon matrix was decorated by graphene nanospheres (GNs), which result from a Ni coordination complex. Our process is obviously more scalable and greener, because the decomposition products can be easily removed by washing and the precursors easily self-assemble by evaporation due to the strong hydrogen bonding. Mostly, N-doping is the most attractive property, which increased the charge transfer ability and improved the wettability and it has been employed in CDI to enhance the desalination performance compared to non-atom doping. As estimated, the maximum salt removal capacity of 23.42 mg g−1 in a 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution was obtained with the GNNLMCS-12 CDI electrode and the salt removal percentage was around 90%. This study opened a new window for large-scale production of high-performance carbon materials for CDI and other applications.
Experimental section
Chemical reagents
Urea (≥99.5%), D-(+)-glucose (≥99.5%), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (≥99.7%), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (≥99.9%), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (≥99.4), dimethylformamide (DMF) (≥99%), N,N,N-triethylamine (NEt3), iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·H2O) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. All chemical reagents were purified before using.
Synthesis of graphene nanospheres
For a typical synthesis of graphene nanospheres (GNs), a DMF (30 mL) solution of EDTA (0.59 g) and NEt3 (2 ml) was added to a DMF (20 mL) solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.16 g). After mixing the two solutions, a light blue precipitate was formed followed by filtration and washing with neat DMF. The grey powder was obtained after drying at room temperature overnight. [Ni2(EDTA)] (1.015 g) was directly calcined at 1000 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and the black powder (Ni/GN) was obtained.
Synthesis of N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks
For preparation of NLMCS, NaHCO3 (0.8 g), urea (1.2 g) and glucose (0.8 g) were dissolved in pure deionized water. After stirring for 2 h, evaporation occurs at 105 °C overnight. Then the mixture was thermally treated at 700 °C for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain NLMCS.
Synthesis of GNNLMCS
For fabrication of GNNLMCS, Ni/GS (0.25 g) and NLMCS (0.5 g) were added to 50 ml EtOH and H2O solution (2:1) and hydrothermally treated at 120 °C for 6 h. The Ni/GNNLMCS was obtained, washed three times with methanol by using centrifugation and dried overnight at 60 °C. Ni was then etched from the resulting powder (Ni/GNNLMCS) using 1 M HCl (12 mL) and 1 M FeCl3·6H2O (12 mL) and the mixture was refluxed at 80 °C for 3 h. After cooling, the black sample was collected by using centrifugation and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times. The sample was dried overnight in vacuo at 60 °C to obtain GNNLMCS-12. For comparison, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 with a ratio of GN:NLMCS of 1:1 and 2:1 were synthesized by using a similar method.
Physical characterization
All samples were investigated by SEM, HRTEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, BET and a wettability test. The details of the characterization are given in the ESI.†
Electrochemical characterization
Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are shown in the ESI.† The specific capacitance was calculated by using eqn (1): (1)where Cs is the specific capacitance, dV refers to the potential window, v is the scan rate, I is the response current and m is the mass of the sample electrode (5 mg).
Electrosorption experiments
In this work, a single NaCl feed water solution was used, where the diffusion coefficients of the cation (Dcation) and anion (Danion) are different. The batch mode CDI experiment for all CDI electrodes was conducted in NaCl aqueous solution with concentrations of 100, 300 and 500 mg L−1, respectively. The volume of the NaCl solution was 50 mL in each CDI experiment. The applied cell voltage between two electrodes ranged from 0.8–1.2 V and the flow rate of the solution was around 25 mL min−1. The total mass of the active material was 0.16 g in all CDI electrodes. The solution conductivity was monitored and measured at the outlet of the unit cell by using a conductivity meter. The salt removal capacity of the CDI electrodes was measured as follows: SAC = (C0 − Ce)V/m(2)where SAC is the electrosorption capacity, C0 and Ce are the initial and final NaCl solution conductivities, V is the salt solution volume and m is the total active mass of both electrodes. The salt removal percentage or electrosorption efficiency (%Δsalt) can be calculated as follows: %Δsalt = (C0 − Ce) × 100%/C0(3)
The charge efficiency of the electrode can be calculated as follows: Λ = (Γ × F)/∑(4)where Λ represents the charge efficiency, Γ is the SAC value, F is the Faraday constant and ∑ is the integral of the corresponding current (charge, C g−1).
Results and discussion
The synthesis of GNNLMCS is described in Fig. 1. Specifically, in preparation of NLMCS, hydrogen carbonate, urea and water anions are alternately linked side by side via O–H⋯O and N–H⋯O to form a cross linkage between adjacent layers, resulting in a two dimensional layer-like structure. Under excessive heat, the glucose molecules can be decomposed during evaporation at 105 °C, causing the formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). It is suggested that 5-HMF is arranged alternately and sandwiched between the adjacent carbon layers bridged by hydrogen bonds. Finally, 5-HMF is dehydrated from the mixture during carbonization and transformation of sodium bicarbonate and urea, together with escape of water molecules, resulting in the formation of layered-mesoporous carbons. Next, the graphene nanospheres are prepared from a [Ni2(EDTA)] complex, where Ni nanoparticles were mainly used to synthesize multi-layered GNs. Afterward, GNs and NLMCS are hydrothermally treated and self-assembled and after acid etching, lead to the formation of GNNLMCS architectures.

The morphology of GNNLMCS was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as presented in Fig. 2. Fig. S1a and b† showing NLMCS confirm that they have a layered and highly porous structure. Fig. 2a shows that GNNLMCS-12 is composed of cross-linked layered porous carbon and intercalated graphene nanospheres in which abundant meso and macro-sized interconnected pores within the layered matrix can be obviously seen. Interestingly, GNNLMCS-12 not only possesses a pillaring layered structure but also exhibits numerous small round pores along the layered channels. This kind of porous morphology is highly essential for CDI electrodes, because the interconnected pores would function as a highway for transport of ions adsorbed on the skeleton surface of GNNLMCS-12 hybrids, and are ideal for the storage of salt ions and uniform distribution of discharge products. The intercalated GN framework is robust (Fig. 2b) and can also be used as a conductive network to rapidly transport the salts ions within the entire electrode matrix.50,51 For CDI, the well-developed structure made of NLMCS and self-assembling of GNs in the skeleton and the framework are helpful for the rapid transport and adsorption of salt ions within the CDI electrode.

White spheres and lines indicate graphene nanospheres on mesoporous carbon sheets and (f) elemental mapping (C, N, and O) of GNNLMCS-12. 
The TEM images of GNNLMCS-12 further confirm that the NLMCS are composed of interconnected GNs and have a relatively loose structure. Typically, the GNs are decorated on the layered carbon frameworks and are inserted into the carbon layers (Fig. 2c and d). Further, the HRTEM image clearly reveals that all GNNLMCS-12 comprised randomly oriented graphitic layers in the porous framework with an interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, which represents the (002) plane of graphite. This implies that the GNNLMCS-12 matrix is mainly composed of GNs and glucose-derived layered carbons, further revealing that GNs consist of 5–6 layers of interconnected graphene (Fig. 2e). For comparison, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 are also prepared with different ratios of GN:NLMCS and the corresponding TEM and SEM images are shown in Fig. S2.† Relatively, aggregation of GNs and cross-linked carbon layers can be obviously observed, which would decrease the porosity and prevent the effective transportation of salt ions, which simultaneously affect the electrosorption process. Additionally, the elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 2f) demonstrated that the C, N and O elements are uniformly distributed throughout the GNNLMCS-12. Actually, the primary precursors for GNs are Ni and EDTA. And the Ni–EDTA complex contains nitrogen atoms as shown in its structure. Therefore, after the annealing process the EDX spectrum shows that N is also located on GNs.
The structure characteristics and chemical composition of GNNLMCS were examined. The XRD patterns of GNNLMCS, GS and NLMCS are shown in Fig. 3a and S3a.† Two diffraction peaks (2θ = 26.2° and 43.1°) are observed, which correspond to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively. These results illustrate that all the samples have a nongraphitic nature and amorphous structure, demonstrating the formation of graphene nanospheres between carbon layers along their stacking direction.52 Therefore, the highly intense (002) peak and a weak broad (101) peak in carbon electrodes is mostly due to the intercalation of GNs into the carbon layers and the GNs have a certain contribution to enhance the interlayer spacing (Fig. S4†). No other peaks are observed, which confirms that Ni and other inorganic species are completely removed during acid etching. It is confirmed that GNNLMCS are formed effectively and GNs are successfully decorated on N-doped mesoporous carbon layers.

Raman spectroscopy was further employed to verify the graphitic quality of GNNLMCS. Two remarkable peaks around 1329 and 1573 cm−1 correspond to the D- and G-bands, respectively (Fig. 3b and S3b†). The D-band arises from the sp3 defective sites, while the G-band is related to the bond stretching of all sp2-bonded pairs. It is generally accepted that the degree of graphitization (ID/IG) specifies the relative amount of defects in the graphitic structure and it can be seen that with the increase in the ratio of GN:NLMCS, the ID/IG values of GNNLMCS increase gradually from 1.01 to 1.08. The ID/IG values for all the samples of GNNLMCS, GN and NLMCS are listed in Table S1.† The results indicate that all the samples of GNNLMCS restore their sp2 carbon and the graphitic structures are highly disordered as compared to GNs and NLMCS. Furthermore, a sharp 2D band is also observed in the spectrum of all GNNLMCS, indicating the thickness and increased number of graphitic carbon layers.53 The Raman and XRD results also give evidence for non-graphitized and amorphous carbon frameworks as well as the intercalation of graphene nanospheres into carbon layers (see the ESI† for detail). In summary, these results confirm the highly graphitic structure and increased number of carbon layers for GNNLMCS-12, which is in good agreement with the SEM results.
To assess the porous characteristics and texture properties of GNNLMCS carbon-based materials, N2 sorption measurements are summarized in Fig. 3c and d and Table S1.† The calculated specific surface areas (SSAs) of GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 are 605, 935 and 1143 m2 g−1, respectively. The pore size distribution (PSD) analysis shows that all the porous carbon materials have hierarchically porous structures with micropores and mesopores and the average pore size of all composite materials ranges from 0.22–51.2 nm. The SSAs of GNs and NLMCS are 494 and 554 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S5a and b†). The high surface area of GNNLMCS-12 is due to the high porosity and successful intercalation of GNs in mesoporous carbon layers. Moreover, all composite materials demonstrate typical type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, which indicates that a large number of micropores and mesopores exist. The cumulative pore volume distribution of carbon electrodes is derived from the DFT model, which further confirms the distinct microporosity of the electrodes (Fig. S6†). In comparison to that of GNNLMCS-21, the cumulative pore volumes of GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 were reduced from around 0.76 mL g−1 to about 0.42 and 0.38 mL g−1, respectively. However, distinct microporosity still remained for both GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 as suggested in their pore size distributions. Particularly, after high N-atom doping GNNLMCS-12 has a much larger surface area than the other controlled samples and is supplemented by the enlarged pore volume ranging from 0.26–51.22 nm. The urea additives verified that urea has three functions in the processes of pore creation: as a carbon source, extra pore-creating agent and N-doping precursor. The comparisons among GNNLMCS illustrate that the amount of micropore volume (Vmic) and mesopore volume (Vmeso) improved with increasing the N contents. Considering that the micropores and mesopores are usually preferred for salt electrosorption, increasing the N-atom doping level might be a tremendous way to achieve high CDI performance. Obviously, GNNLMCS-12 possesses a large number of mesopores and it is clear that abundant mesopores can enhance the surface usage and facilitate the infiltration of CDI electrode materials. Therefore, the highly porous and layered structure of the GNNLMCS-12 network confirms the large SSA which is favourable for fast ion diffusion.54 Alternatively, increasing the GN:NLMCS ratio increases the internal contact resistance in the carbon layers and limits the conductivity due to possible blocking of micropore channels, which seriously affect the electrosorption capacity. Therefore, a suitable ratio of micropores and mesopores needs to be carefully controlled according to their use in CDI applications. It has been stated that such hierarchically porous structures may not only promote the formation of carbon–N active sites but also improve the electrosorption performance during CDI.55
XPS analysis was conducted to characterize the elemental composition and surface chemical state of GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12. Based on XPS results, the carbon content, oxygen content and N-doping level can be calculated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the XPS survey of GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 comprises three prominent peaks at about 283, 532 and 398 eV, which are related to C1s, O1s and N1s, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the C 1s spectrum of GNNLMCS-12 consists of four peaks, the –C–O bond at 287.76 eV, the –COOH bond at 289.06 eV, the –C–N bond at 286.23 and the –C–C– bond at 285.11 eV, respectively. The graphite-like –C–C– bonds have sp2 hybridization, demonstrating that the carbon atoms are arranged in a layered honeycomb lattice. As expected, a new peak located at 287.66 eV can be detected in the C 1s spectrum, signifying the successful N-atom doping. The N contents of all the samples are listed in Table 1. During the process of N-atom doping, the highly active oxygen species can be easily exchanged by N-atoms.56 In order to study the chemical configuration of N species, the high resolution N 1s spectra of GNNLMCS-12, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 were recorded as shown in Fig. 4c. Clearly, the N 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into four different N-peaks located at 397.8, 398.7, 400.2 and 401.4 eV, which are attributed to pyridinic-N (N-6), pyrrolic-N (N-5), graphitic-N (N-G) and oxidized-N (N-Ox), respectively. GNNLMCS-12 has a high N content (10.56 at%) which is much higher than those of GNNLMCS-11 (7.6 at%) and GNNLMCS-21 (4.95 at%). This high N content depends on the nitrogen contents originating from the urea and the increased ratio of NLMCS. The N-atom doping improves the surface polarity of carbon-based electrode materials, which not only enhances the wettability but also results in better capacitance behaviour.57 More concretely, the predominant N-6 and N-5 are electro-active and high electron-donating capability to deliver good pseudocapacitance in the NaCl electrolyte. The presence of N-G can not only provide the active sites for interacting with salt ions in the NaCl electrolyte but also improve the electronic conductivity. Therefore, the enhanced desalination performance of GNNLMCS-12 would be attributed to its excellent N-atom doping property and enhanced electronic conductivity.

To further confirm the porous structure, the wettability of the as-fabricated electrodes was assessed by using dynamic contact angle measurements (Fig. 4d). The initial contact angles for GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 are 88.9° and 91.3°, respectively. As the time increases to 75 s, the final contact angles decrease to 24.2° and 37.4°, respectively. Obviously, it is proposed that GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 have low hydrophilicity. In comparison, the GNNLMC-12 electrode exhibits a lower initial contact angle of 77.6° and as the time increases to 75 s, the final contact angle decreases to 6.8°. Clearly, GNNLMCS-12 has substantially enhanced wettability, indicative of its high hydrophilicity compared to other electrodes. The enhanced wettability of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode should be attributed to the variation caused by N-atom doping and the porous structure. This can be explained that N-atom doping can not only generate the structural defects but also alter the porous morphology to develop the pure graphitic carbon of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. Therefore, these two features enable the access of salt ions into the pore channels of the electrode. In other words, the entire porous structure can be completely employed towards the maximum adsorption of salt ions.
To better illustrate the electrochemical performance of GNNLMCS electrode materials for CDI, we first employed cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a 0.5 mol L−1 NaCl solution to explore the salt ion removal capacity of electrode materials. Fig. 5a and S7a† show the CV curves at 1 mV s−1 from 0.5 to −0.5 V. No redox peak is observed and all the curves exhibit quasi-rectangular shapes, showing that all materials reveal a typical electric double layer capacitance (EDLC). A high Cs of 321 F g−1 is achieved by GNNLMCS-12 at 1 mV s−1. The Cs of GNNLMCS electrodes calculated by eqn (1) increases in the order GN < NLMCS < GNNLMCS-21 < GNNLMCS-11 < GNNLMCS-12 (Fig. 5b and S7b†). The CV curve is still rectangular even at a high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, indicating the low internal resistance of, high rate capability of and fast ion electrosorption into the GNNLMCS-12 electrode (Fig. S8†). In contrast, the other electrode materials show apparently inclined CV curves and low Cs which is possibly attributed to their different internal morphologies. Therefore, the excellent CV profile and high Cs suggest fast ion diffusion into the active sites and outstanding capacitive behaviour of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in the rapid charge–discharge process.58

(d) Nyquist plots of GNNLMCS and the inset presents an expanded view in the low frequency region and equivalent circuit (inset). All curves were obtained in a 0.5 mol L−1 NaCl solution. 
The GCD curves of GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 electrodes in a 0.5 mol L−1 NaCl solution at 0.2 A g−1 with a voltage range of 0.5 to −0.5 V are presented in Fig. 5c. It is clear that all the electrodes exhibit a classic triangular shape with linear and symmetric GC curves, indicative of good reversibility and excellent EDLC behaviour. Moreover, the GNNLMCS-12 electrode displays the longest discharging time among all the electrodes, indicating the highest capacitance, which is in good agreement with the CV curves. Moreover, GNNLMCS-12 exhibits linear GCD curves at different current densities (Fig. S9a†). Additionally, at the beginning of the discharge process, the GCD curves show iR drops, which describe the inner resistance and ion diffusion resistance between electrode materials and salt electrolyte.59 The iR drops of GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 electrodes at different current densities are shown in Fig. S9b.† As the current density increases, the iR drop also increases due to the inadequate discharge in the electric double layers at the initial stages of the discharging process. Clearly, at all current densities, GNNLMCS-12 exhibits the smallest iR drops as compared with the other electrodes. This smallest internal resistance of GNNLMCS-12 is thought to be advantageous in CDI applications.
The electrical resistance and capacitive behaviour of all the electrodes were assessed by EIS analysis. EIS analysis was performed for all GNNLMCS electrodes in a 0.5 mol L−1 salt solution as shown in Fig. 5d. The GNNLMCS-12 electrode exhibits a small semi-circle at the low frequency region, indicating distinctive capacitive behaviour, which means that the salt ions are rapidly diffused into the meso and microporous channels. The GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-21 electrodes display a semi-circle at high frequency regions, indicative of the poor and slow diffusion of ions. As seen in the Nyquist plots, the x-intercept of the plots in the high frequency region can be regarded as the bulk resistance (Rs), corresponding to the intrinsic electrical properties of the carbon electrode and electrolyte, internal electrode resistance and contact resistance between the current collector and CDI electrode.60 Clearly, the low value of the x-intercept indicates the lowest Rs and rapid charge transfer ability. The small semi-circle indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CDI electrode and interface of the electrolyte.61 The Rct values for GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 electrodes are 0.83 Ω, 0.79 Ω and 0.65 Ω, respectively. Thus, GNNLMCS-12 has the lowest Rct, fastest ion diffusion and the best charge transfer ability in the NaCl solution as compared to the other CDI electrodes. Such a lowest value of electrical resistance for the GNNLMCS-12 electrode may be advantageous for CDI applications. On the other hand, the electrochemical performance of carbon electrodes was also tested in a 500 ppm NaCl solution (Fig. S10†).
A series of CDI experiments were performed in a 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution in order to test the desalination performance of the as-prepared electrode materials. The CDI profiles of GN, NLMCS, GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 electrodes in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution at 1.2 V with a flow rate of 25 ml min−1 are shown in Fig. 6a. It is clear that once the voltage is applied, the solution conductivity of every electrode decreases very quickly. The conductivity of the electrodes being saturated by salt ions plateaued in 45 min, indicating the ion adsorption equilibrium. After 120 min, the SAC values calculated by eqn (2) for GN, NLMCS, GNNLMCS-21, GNNLMCS-11 and GNNLMCS-12 electrodes were 12.81, 14.07, 16.51, 20.67 and 23.42 mg g−1, respectively. Clearly, the SAC of GNNLMCS-12 is higher than the other reported CDI electrodes (Fig. 8d), indicating that the ions are easily diffused into the porous channels of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode.32–35,37,60–63 In comparison, GNNLMCS-21 and GNNLMCS-11 electrodes have lower electrosorption performance, owing to their non-uniform morphology, low SSA and lower Cs. Similarly, GNs and NLMCS have the lowest CDI capacity among the other CDI electrodes. We also fabricated GNNLMCS-14 with a GN:NLMCS ratio of 1:4 and checked the electrosorption performance. The CDI profile of the GNNLMCS-14 electrode in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution at 1.2 V with a flow rate of 25 ml min−1 is shown in Fig. S11.† The GNNLMCS-14 electrodes exhibit the electrosorption performance of 15.37 mg g−1, which is not higher than the other GNNLMCS samples. Actually, the NLMCS ratio is higher than the GN ratio (1/4) and the GNs are not completely decorated on the layered mesoporous carbon, which hinders the interlayer spacing of NLMCS. Obviously, this ratio will affect the other properties of GNNLMCS-14. Therefore, we predict that the GNNLMCS-12 electrode has the highest electrosorption capacity attributed to its well-defined porous morphology, N-doping properties, high SSA, wettability and highest electronic conductivity. The N-doping enhances the hydrophilicity and conductivity of the carbon electrode materials because the N-atom provides a free lone pair to carbon, so that the carbon atom adjacent to the N-atom has high positive charge density. Therefore, the doping of the electron-rich N-atom increases the chemical reactivity and electron transport properties of carbon materials, which is thought to be useful in CDI applications.64

Besides, the CDI Ragone plots can also be employed to determine both the salt removal capacity and salt electrosorption rate (SAR) of carbon-based electrode materials. Generally, it is favourable to shift the Ragone plot towards the upper right region, which indicates a rapid SAC and the fastest SAR. The CDI Ragone plots of all the electrodes are shown in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the Ragone plot of the GNNLMCS-12 CDI electrode shifts to the upper rightmost region, demonstrating the highest salt removal capacity and a rapid salt removal rate among all the electrodes. Therefore, it is confirmed that the largest amount of salt ions can be adsorbed by the GNNLMCS-12 electrode with a rapid adsorption rate.
In order to explore the effect of other operating conditions such as applied voltage, flow rate and initial salt concentration on the electrosorption performance, further CDI experiments were conducted. The electrosorption curves of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in different initial NaCl concentrations are shown in Fig. 7a. The SAC values of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in 100, 300, and 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution are 15.09, 18.15 and 23.42 mg g−1, respectively. Clearly, in all curves, the salt removal capacity increased rapidly and after 40 min reaches the equilibrium stage. Therefore, it is confirmed that the highest SAC value will be achieved as the initial NaCl concentration increases. As shown in Fig. 7b, the Ragone curves show that at the higher NaCl concentration, the Ragone plot shifts to the upper rightmost region, indicative of the fastest SAR and rapid SAC for the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. The enhanced SAR and SAC can be explained by the increased conductivity of the effluent NaCl solution and adsorption of the largest amount of salt ions in the pores of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. Therefore, by increasing the initial NaCl concentration, the fastest SAR and rapid SAC can be achieved, compared to the lower initial NaCl concentration.

Furthermore, charge utilization is also a significant tool to explore the electrosorption performance, which can be revealed by charge efficiency.65 The current response of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in different NaCl concentrations is shown in Fig. S12.† Based on eqn (4), the calculated Λ values of GNNLMCS-12 in 100, 300 and 500 mg L−1 salt solution are 0.54, 0.61 and 0.73, respectively. Obviously, the above Λ values show that as the initial salt concentration increases, the charge efficiency of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode also improves which correlates well with the preceding reports.66,67
Similarly, the cell voltage also affects the CDI performance of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. The SAC curves of GNNLMCS-12 in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution at different applied voltages with a flow rate of 25 ml min−1 are shown in Fig. 7c. The SAC values of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode at 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 V are 15.46, 19.68 and 23.42 mg g−1, respectively. Clearly, the highest SAC at 1.2 V indicates the strong electrostatic contact of salt ions with CDI electrodes. The Ragone plots for GNNLMCS-12 at different applied voltages are shown in Fig. 7d. The results show that at 1.2 V, the Ragone plots of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode shift to the upper rightmost region, indicative of the fastest SAR and rapid SAC. At 1.2 V, the charge efficiency of the electrode increases, which improves the SAR of the electrode. As a result, as the applied voltage increases to 1.2 V, the ions are fully adsorbed from the NaCl solution.
Next, the CDI performance of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode was evaluated at different solution flow rates. The CDI curves of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in a 500 mg L−1 salt solution with different flow rates are presented in Fig. 8a. The SAC values of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode with flow rates of 25, 40 and 60 mL min−1 are 23.42, 19.83 and 16.74 mg g−1, respectively. Clearly, as the solution flow rate increases, the salt removal capacity of the electrode decreases. Therefore, it is confirmed that the highest salt removal capacity can be achieved by the GNNLMCS-12 electrode at 25 ml min−1. The Ragone plots for the GNNLMCS-12 electrode at different solution flow rates are shown in Fig. 8b. The results demonstrate that the Ragone plots shift to the upper and rightmost region at 25 ml min−1, indicating both the fastest SAR and rapid SAC. This can be explained that at a lower flow rate the Ragone plot shifted towards the right region due to a longer retention time for positive and negative ions in the pores providing a large amount of salt ions in the adsorption sites of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. Therefore, 25 ml min−1 is the most suitable flow rate for CDI electrodes to achieve the highest salt removal capacity and fastest salt removal rate.

(c) Regeneration cyclic stability of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode over 42 adsorption–desorption cycles in a 100 mg L−1 NaCl solution at a charge/discharge voltage of 1.2–0 V. (d) Comparison of the ion removal capacity of GNNLMCS-12 in this work with those of the reported carbon electrodes in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution. 
The deionization cyclic stability of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode is also essential to investigate the reversibility during the CDI process. The cyclic stability curves of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in a 100 mg L−1 salt solution at a charge–discharge voltage of 1.2–0 V are shown in Fig. 8c. After adsorption of salt ions on the electrode surface, the voltage was decreased to 0 V and the conductivity increased to its initial value and the adsorbed ions desorbed back into the solution, indicative of the outstanding deionization cyclic stability of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. This can be explained by the faradaic reaction during the charge/discharge process. During charging, the salt ions are adsorbed rapidly while during discharging, the cathode acts as an “anode” by donating electrons and the anode acts as a “cathode” by accepting the electrons, so that the faradaic reaction occurs on the surface of the electrode and salt ions are completely desorbed. Clearly, GNNLMCS-12 can still achieve the SAC value of 12.25 mg g−1 after 42 adsorption/desorption cycles, indicating the remarkable regeneration of cyclic stability of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode in the CDI process. With this cycle stability, no decline was observed in the electrical conductivity after all the charge–discharge processes. Afterward, the electrosorption percentage of GNNLMCS-12 was calculated by using eqn (3) and the desalination efficiency was around 90% as shown in Fig. S13.† Thus, we look forward to the auspicious prospects of GNNLMCS-12 for CDI applications.
Based on this explanation, the GNNLMCS-12 electrode exhibits excellent electrosorption performance. This can be elucidated from the following aspects: the chemical composition and porous layered structure. Considering its incredible surface chemistry, superior SSA and well-defined pore size, the enhanced electrosorption performance is mostly ascribed to the exceptional layered and porous structure. Moreover, the shorter ion diffusion distance and decreased ion diffusion resistance can lead to salt ion adsorption on the entire surface, causing a shorter time for reaching electrosorption equilibrium.68,69 The excellent CDI performance of GNNLMCS-12 is mainly credited not only to the layered and porous structure but also to the improved charge transfer ability, high Cs, high N doping property and enhanced wettability. The Cs of the CDI electrode materials is also an essential feature for high electrosorption performance. In this work, the GNNLMCS-12 electrode achieves a Cs of 321 F g−1, which is considerably higher than the other CDI electrodes, ensuring the largest amount of ions for adsorption in the EDL of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode.70,71 Similarly, the N-doping also plays a key role in enhancing the electrosorption performance of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. Unfortunately, the GNNLMCS-21 and GNNLMCS-11 electrodes have lower CDI performance. This can be described by the following aspects: poor SSA, low Cs and poor wettability whereas the increased ion diffusion resistance inside the pore channels hinders the accessibility of NaCl ions to all the pores. Thus, the GNNLMCS-21 and GNNLMCS-11 electrodes have the lowest salt removal capacity and the lowest salt removal rate. Additionally, the summary of the electrosorption performance of our electrodes compared to reported carbon-based CDI electrode materials are presented in Table S2.† Clearly, the GNNLMCS-12 electrode has the highest level of electrosorption performance among different carbon-based CDI electrodes. Remarkably, the highest SAC and highest SAR are determined by the synergistic effect of the layered porous morphology and N-atom doping property. Therefore, we believe that the GNNLMCS-12 electrode may be a promising candidate for CDI applications, energy storage, adsorption, etc.
Conclusions
In summary, graphene nanosphere decorated N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks were originally prepared and demonstrated as highly-efficient electrodes for capacitive deionization. The experimental results illustrate that the GN and NLMCS ratio plays a significant role in the layered porous structure and electrochemical properties of the GNNLMCS electrodes by influencing their N-atom doping property, SSA, ion diffusion resistance and charge transfer ability. The obtained GNNLMCS-12 electrode possessed a unique layered porous structure and outstanding N-atom doping property, fine wettability, best charge transfer ability and rapid ion diffusion. Compared with GNNLMCS-21 and GNNLMCS-11 electrodes, the GNNLMCS-12 electrode exhibits the highest Cs of 321 F g−1. The GNNLMCS-12 electrode achieved an extremely high salt removal capacity of 23.42 mg g−1 and the fastest salt removal rate. Besides, no obvious decline in the CDI performance has been detected in the charge–discharge process, representing good deionization stability over multi-regeneration cycles of the GNNLMCS-12 electrode. In recent studies concerning the conversion of metal–organic frameworks into carbon or graphene-based materials, we strongly consider that the process described in our work can be extended to produce various porous graphene-based frameworks, comprising heteroatom-doped mesoporous carbon or bioinspired graphene materials and employed as highly efficient electrode materials for desalination as well as in energy storage and conversion applications. We believe that highly efficient capacitive deionization of saline water can be realized by using novel graphene-based porous carbon frameworks.

Environmental significance
Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an alternative and energy efficient water purification technology, which consumes low energy to produce potable water. Electrode materials are quite crucial for the deionization performance. However, the commonly used carbon electrode materials suffer from such issues as unsuitable porous structures, low conductivity and poor wettability, which limit their practical applications. To solve such issues, herein, we developed a cost-effective strategy to fabricate graphene nanosphere decorated N-doped layered mesoporous carbon frameworks as highly-efficient electrode materials for CDI applications. Owing to their high-level N-doping, high specific capacitance, fast ion diffusion and excellent charge transfer ability, our GNNLMCS exhibit the highest salt removal capacity (23.42 mg g−1) with fast salt removal rates and good desalination efficiency (90%). The extraordinary CDI performance indicates the synergistic effect of N-doping and well-interconnected mesoporous structures of the GNNLMCS, which opens a new avenue for the development of highly efficient desalination of saline water.
