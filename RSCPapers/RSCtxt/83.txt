    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 1st June 2016AbstractThe electrochemical and photochemical catalytic reductions of CO2 using N,O and N,S-NHC-containing dicarbonyl rhenium(I) bipyridine complexes have been investigated. By replacing the carbonyl ligand in tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes with a weaker π-accepting ligand, the characteristic MLCT transitions shifted to lower energy. This makes photocatalysts capable of harvesting low-energy visible light for catalyzing CO2 reduction. A detailed study revealed that these dicarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes are also highly selective for photocatalysis of CO2 to CO with a good quantum efficiency (10%), similar to that of the tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complex analogues. From the electrochemical study, it was observed that the catalysts efficiently produce CO from CO2 with high turnover frequency and good stability over time.
Introduction
The effective conversion or incorporation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful chemicals or fuels has received considerable and increasing attention in the scientific community as these processes not only enable the development of useful substances from a sustainable carbon source (CO2)1 but they may also partly contribute to stabilizing the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 levels through capturing and converting it into a chemical feedstock.2 However, as CO2 is kinetically inert and thermodynamically more stable than other organic compounds in the reduced forms, energy is required for the conversion of CO2 into these compounds. Tremendous efforts have been made to design molecular catalysts for electrochemical or photochemical reduction of CO2 in order to drive the reduction processes more efficiently.3
Amongst the molecular catalysts, the luminescent tricarbonyl rhenium(I) diimine complexes3e–i are well-known to show good electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity for selective reduction of CO2 to CO. Although the quantum efficiencies of these rhenium-based catalysts for CO2 reduction are high, the solar light utilization is limited by the weak visible light absorption of these complexes because the MLCT transitions of these complexes occur in the UV region with very weak tailing in the visible region.4 It has been well-documented that the MLCT transitions of these complexes could shift to a lower energy visible region through the use of better π-accepting diimine ligands.4 However, the reducing power of the catalytic intermediate (one-electron reduced form) would then be decreased as the energy of the π* orbital of the diimine ligand is lowered, thus rendering the catalytic reduction process inefficient. To achieve visible light driven photocatalytic reduction of CO2, photosensitizers and supramolecular systems such as Ru(II)–Re(I) have been designed.5
Recently, we have developed several new series of Re(I) diimine luminophores through the replacement of the carbonyl ligands with various types of ancillary ligands,6 through which the MLCT transition energy could be readily modified and fine-tuned. Since the MLCT transition in these complexes can be altered through the perturbation of the dπ(Re) orbital with the ancillary ligands without the need for changing the diimine ligand,6 the reduction potential of the one-electron reduced form, which is mainly dependent on the diimine ligand, can be maintained when the ancillary ligands are varied for designing complexes with lower MLCT transition energy. As our recently reported N,O- and the N,S-N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Re(I) complexes exhibit good stability and are not susceptible to nucleophilic attack,6f,g two of the reported complexes (Chart 1) with strong MLCT absorption in the visible region have been synthesized6g to investigate the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

Results and discussion
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO
Both complexes (1 and 2) are active photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. Carbon monoxide evolved from the CO2 saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1, v/v) solutions containing 0.5 mM of the photocatalyst [1, 2 or [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl]3e,f (Re–Cl)] and in the presence of 0.1 M 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as a sacrificial electron donor7 upon irradiation with white-light LEDs (the lamp spectrum is shown in Fig. S1†). The CO produced from the photocatalysis was monitored using FT-IR spectroscopy and GC-TCD of the reaction headspace. As is typically observed in Re-based photocatalytic CO2 reductions,3e–h there was no induction period in these photocatalytic systems, which showed the highest CO production rate during the initial period as reflected by the slopes (in the first 90 minutes of irradiation) in the plots of TON for CO production (TONCO) vs. time (Fig. 1a). The initial rates were in the order of 2 > [Re–Cl] > 1. The CO production rate gradually decreased and reached a plateau at ca. 15 hours of irradiation. The TONs for photocatalytic systems with 1, 2 and [Re–Cl] were found to be 57, 102 and 87, respectively, after 15 hours of irradiation.
 Fig. 1  Photocatalytic activity of 1 (■), 2 () and [Re–Cl] () for CO production. Conditions: 4 mL of CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1, v/v) solutions containing 0.5 mM of the photocatalyst and 0.1 M BIH, excitation source: Osram Parathom 13 W white-light LED (a) without filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) and (b) with liquid filter: 1% K2CrO4 solution (λ > 480 nm). 
When low-energy visible light with λ > 480 nm was used as the excitation source, the TONCO of 1 and 2 after 15-hour irradiation increased considerably from 57 and 102 to 90 and 153 (corresponding to the net production of ca. 306 μmol of CO in the case of 2), respectively; while the TONCO of [Re–Cl] dropped from 87 to 10 (Fig. 1b). The significantly better photocatalytic performance of 1 and 2 than that of [Re–Cl] with the low-energy photo-excitation can be attributed to the much stronger absorptivity of these carbene complexes in the visible region (Fig. 2). The increased total turnover numbers of 1 and 2 after 15 hours of irradiation with lower-energy excitation (λ > 480 nm) compared to those with the unfiltered light are likely due to the enhanced photo-stability of these carbene complexes with the lower-energy excitation, which is typical of Re(I) diimine complexes.8 [Re–Cl] should also have a better stability under the same conditions.8 However, due to the low absorptivity of [Re–Cl] at λ > 480 nm (Fig. 2), the light is not efficiently harvested, and thus its photocatalytic performance decreased significantly. On the other hand, the lower initial rates for CO formation in the photocatalytic systems of 1 and 2 with the lower-energy excitation (Fig. 1b) can be attributed to the reduction of the total light intensity absorbed by the complexes as the high-energy light (λ < 480 nm) was cut by the liquid filter.

Similar to other Re(I)-based photocatalytic systems, the photocatalysis with 1 and 2 is also highly selective for the reduction of CO2 to CO, with only very small amounts of H2 and HCOO− being detected throughout the 15-hour photolysis experiments. The quantum yields for CO generation (ΦCO) under the same conditions with monochromatic 480 nm excitation are 0.11 for 1 and 0.09 for 2, which are in the typical range of the other Re(I)-based single-component photocatalytic systems for the reduction of CO2 to CO (0.005–0.30, λex = 365–436 nm).3f,g,9 These results confirmed the capability and the high effectiveness of the NHC-containing dicarbonyl Re(I) complexes for the utilization of low-energy visible light for CO2 photocatalytic reduction.
As CO2 adducts with Re-based photocatalysts have been proposed to be one of the key intermediates,3f,g,10 attempts have been made to characterize the reactive intermediates by ESI-mass spectrometry during the course of the photocatalytic reaction to verify if CO2 adducts can be formed in these dicarbonyl NHC-containing rhenium(I) complexes (1 and 2). After 30 min photo-irradiation, new peaks assignable to the ion clusters of [M − CO + CNR]+ and [M − carbene − CO + 2CNR]+ with the intensity comparable to the parent peak [M]+ were observed in the ESI-mass spectra (Fig. 3). Although peaks corresponding to the CO2-adducts as well as the coordinatively unsaturated species such as [M − CO]+, [M − CNR]+ and [M − carbene]+ are not detected in the ESI-mass spectra, the observation of [M − CO + CNR]+ and [M − carbene − CO + 2CNR]+ in the mass spectrum confirmed that the CO, CNR and carbene ligands in these complexes have undergone photo-induced ligand dissociations. These photo-induced ligand dissociations are also supported by a number of new CN and CO stretches observed in the dichloromethane extracts of the photocatalytic reaction mixture after 30 min of irradiation (Fig. S2†). These ligand dissociations would generate coordinatively unsaturated species, which can form CO2 adducts during the course of the photocatalytic reduction. These observations suggest that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction of 1 and 2 can undergo a similar reaction mechanism via a CO2 adduct as it has been proposed for the tricarbonyl Re(I) system.3f,g,10

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO
Cyclic voltammograms of 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4. The first monoelectronic, quasi-reversible reduction is most likely ligand centred (reduction of the bpy ligand). Peak potentials at a low scan rate are equal to –1.26 V vs. SCE with 1 and −1.21 V vs. SCE with 2. The second, more negative wave is metal centred with peak potentials at a low scan rate (0.1 V s−1) equal to −1.79 V vs. SCE with 1 and −1.735 V vs. SCE with 2. This electrochemical behaviour is similar to the [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] complex, for which the doubly reduced [Re(bpy)(CO)3]− species has been shown to possess a formal charge distribution of Re0(bpy)−1.11 When being doubly reduced, 1 and 2 are proved to be catalytically active upon CO2 saturation of the DMF solution, as shown in Fig. 4a and b, and the addition of a weak Lewis acid (LiClO4 0.1 M) or Brønsted acid (MeOH 0.5 M) accelerates the catalytic rate. Higher current and lower overpotential were noticed for 2, thus we focused our further study on this complex. To confirm that CO2 is indeed reduced, electrolysis experiments were performed at −1.8 V vs. SCE in the presence of either LiClO4 (0.1 M, Fig. S3†) or MeOH (0.5 M, Fig. 4c). In both cases, the only reduction product was CO (detected and quantified by GC). In the case of LiClO4 addition to the solution, the current density (1 mA cm−2) rapidly decreased to almost zero. This is likely due to the precipitation of the lithium carbonate salt (Li2CO3) formed upon catalysis, as already observed under similar experimental conditions.12 Note that in this case a solid deposit was observed on the carbon plate, pointing towards the formation of an insoluble salt. In contrast, upon 1.5 h electrolysis in the presence of methanol (0.5 M), the current density remained almost constant, close to 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4c). The Faradaic efficiency for CO formation was 90%. The rate constant for catalysis kcat was obtained from the electrolysis current and from the CV wave (foot-of-the wave analysis) taking into account that the reaction is a two electron process and that the catalytic CO production is likely kinetically controlled by the addition of CO2 to the active Re species. As detailed in the ESI,†kcat was calculated to be equal to 100 s−1 from CV analysis, which is in good agreement with kcat = 30 s−1 obtained from the electrolysis current. Note that an estimation of kcat in the presence of 0.1 M LiClO4 using the foot-of-the wave analysis led to 103 s−1, very close to the turnover frequency obtained with [Re(bpy)(CO)3py]2+ in the presence of Brønsted acids.3f,n These results highlight the remarkable catalytic activity of 2 towards CO2, although the overpotential η is rather large (e.g. under electrolysis conditions η = E0(CO2/CO) − Eelectrolysis = –0.93 + 1.8 = 870 mV).13

Conclusions
The NHC-containing dicarbonyl Re(I) complexes reported here are highly selective and efficient catalysts for the electrochemical and photochemical conversion of CO2 into CO. On the basis of their photocatalytic properties, it can be concluded that the replacement of one carbonyl ligand with another weaker π-accepting ligand in the tricarbonyl Re(I) diimine complex system is a successful strategy for the development of highly selective photocatalysts that can effectively use low-energy visible light for catalyzing CO2 reduction.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
The dicarbonyl Re(I) complexes, {Re(CO)2(CNC6H4Cl-4)[CN(4-ClC6H4)C2H4X](bpy)}(PF6) (1: X = O; 2: X = S),6g and the sacrificial electron donor, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH),14 were synthesized according to literature procedures. All solvents were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. Bu4NPF6 was obtained from Fluka (puriss.) and used without further purification.
Physical measurements and instrumentation
All ESI mass spectra were recorded on a PE-SCIEX API 150 EX single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer.
Cyclic voltammetry and electrolysis
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT128N potentiostat (Metrohm). The three-electrode setup consisted of a glassy carbon working electrode (custom made, 0.071 cm2) polished with diamond paste of various diameters (successively 15, 6, 3, and 1 μm, 60 seconds each), a Pt wire counter electrode, and a SCE reference electrode (−0.241 V vs. NHE). All experiments were performed under an Ar or CO2 atmosphere at 25 °C, the double-wall jacketed cell being thermostated by circulation of water. The Ohmic drop was compensated using the positive feedback compensation implemented in the instrument.
Controlled potential electrolyses were performed using a PARSTAT 4000 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research). The experiments were carried out in a cell using a glassy carbon plate (S = 1.0 cm2) as a working electrode, and a SCE reference electrode. The Pt grid counter electrode was separated from the cathodic compartment with a glass frit. Gas chromatography analyses of gas evolved in the headspace during the electrolysis were performed with an Agilent Technologies 7820A GC system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. CO and H2 production was quantitatively detected using a CP-CarboPlot P7 capillary column (27.46 m in length and 25 μm in internal diameter).
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO
Photocatalytic reactions for CO2 reduction were performed in 20 mL Pyrex glass tubes (i.d. = 10 mm) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. A DMF–TEOA (5:1, v/v, 4 mL) solution containing BIH (0.1 M) and the photocatalyst (0.5 mM) was added to the tube, sealed and purged with CO2 for at least 20 min. The solution was then irradiated in merry-go-round irradiation apparatus, which was equipped with a sample holder for eight reaction tubes and 4 white-light LEDs (Osram Parathom 13 W white-light LED, PAR30, Fig. S1, ESI†) set at a distance of ca. 10 cm from the reaction tubes as the excitation source. For the experiments using visible light excitation with λ > 480 nm, the reaction tubes were immersed in a 1% K2CrO4 solution as the solution filter with a minimum path-length of 25 mm to cut off most of the high energy light (λ < 480 nm). During irradiation, the glass tubes were sealed with septa and the temperature was controlled at 25 °C. The gas samples of the head-space CO contents were analyzed by FT-IR spectrometry (Perkin–Elmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrophotometer) and GC-TCD (Agilent 5890, equipped with a Chrompack 5 Å molecular sieve column (30 m × 0.32 m × 1.5 μm)). The formate (HCOO−), oxalate (CO2CO2)2− and other anions, which were commonly known to be generated in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the irradiated solutions, were also determined by ion chromatography (Dionex ICS 1600). The quantum yields for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions were determined in a septum-sealed quartz cubic cell (path length: 1.0 cm) containing CO2 saturated DMF–TEOA (4:1, v/v, 2 ml) solution of BIH (0.1 M) and photocatalysts (0.5 mM). The excitation (480 nm) was generated by using a 500 W ozone-free Oriel Hg(Xe) lamp, coupled with an Oriel 77200 1/4 m monochromator. The incident light intensity (480 nm) was determined to be 7.04 × 10−9 einstein per s by the iron oxalate actinometry.15 The temperature of the irradiated solution was maintained at ca. 25 °C. The CO formed was analyzed by GC as detailed above. The quantum yield for reduction of CO2 to CO is defined as the number of moles of CO produced per einstein of photons absorbed by the photocatalyst after 5 hours of irradiation.

 	Chart 1  Structures of the Re(I) N,O- and N,S-carbene complexes.	 

 	Fig. 1  Photocatalytic activity of 1 (■), 2 () and [Re–Cl] () for CO production. Conditions: 4 mL of CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1, v/v) solutions containing 0.5 mM of the photocatalyst and 0.1 M BIH, excitation source: Osram Parathom 13 W white-light LED (a) without filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) and (b) with liquid filter: 1% K2CrO4 solution (λ > 480 nm).	 

 	Fig. 2  Overlaid UV-vis absorption spectra of 1, 2 and [Re–Cl] in CH2Cl2 solution.	 

 	Fig. 3  ESI-mass spectrum of the photocatalytic reaction mixture of 2 (a) before irradiation and (b) after 30 minutes of visible-light (λex > 480 nm) irradiation. The insets show the expansion of the major peaks (m/z = 782 [M − CO − carbene + 2CNR]+, [Re(CO)(bpy)(CNC6H4Cl-4)3]+; 842 [M − CO + CNR]+, [Re(CO)(bpy)(carbene)(CNC6H4Cl-4)2]+) and the simulated isotopic patterns for the assigned ion clusters.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a, b) Cyclic voltammetry (v = 0.1 V s−1 in DMF, Bu4NPF6 0.1 M) at a glassy carbon electrode of (a) 1 (0.5 mM) under argon (blue trace) and with CO2 0.23 M + LiClO4 0.1 M (pink trace), and 2 (0.5 mM) under argon (black trace) and with CO2 0.23 M + LiClO4 0.1 M (red trace); (b) 2 (0.5 mM) under argon (black trace) and with CO2 0.23 M + MeOH 0.5 M (red trace). (c) Controlled potential electrolysis (−1.8 V vs. SCE, glassy carbon plate) with 2 0.5 mM (in DMF, MeOH 0.5 M, Bu4NPF6 0.1 M): current (black trace) and charge (red trace) vs. time.
