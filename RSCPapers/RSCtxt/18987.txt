    , Accepted 9th April 2017First published on 10th April 2017AbstractA copper-and-zinc (Cu–Zn) alloy material was synthesized using a vacuum sealing method, in which evaporated zinc was reacted with copper film or nanoparticles to form a homogeneous Cu–Zn alloy. This alloy was evaluated as an electrocatalyst and/or cocatalyst for photocatalysis to selectively reduce carbon dioxide to formic acid. Based on the optimised alloy composition, the Cu5Zn8 catalyst exhibited efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. Furthermore, we constructed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) three-electrode system, in which the Cu5Zn8 film functioned as the cathode for CO2 reduction in the dark and strontium titanate (SrTiO3) served as the photoanode for water oxidation. The PEC system also selectively reduced CO2 to formic acid with a faradaic efficiency of 79.11% under UV-light and the absence of an applied bias potential. SrTiO3 particles decorated with nanoparticles of the Cu–Zn alloy also photocatalytically reduced CO2 to formic acid under UV-light. Isotope trace analysis demonstrated that water served as the electron donor to produce oxygen and organic molecules under UV light, similar to photosynthesis in plants. The Cu–Zn alloy material developed in the present study is composed of ubiquitous and safe materials, and can catalyse CO2 conversion by means of various kinds of renewable energies.
1. Introduction
The increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels has become a global problem. The non-renewable nature of hydrocarbon-based fossil fuels necessitates the use of CO2-free energy sources like solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. The development of CO2-recycling systems based on such renewable energy sources is of growing importance to establish the desired carbon-neutral society. In particular, the rational design of high-performance catalysts is in critical demand to efficiently reduce CO2 to valuable organic products for different renewable energy sources under moderate conditions through electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis and/or photocatalysis.
The main products of CO2 reduction in aqueous media are formic acid (HCOOH), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), and methane (CH4).1–7 Among the possible CO2 reduction products, HCOOH is highly desirable as it is widely used in the energy and chemical industries as a fuel and as a raw material for H2 generation.8 HCOOH is also important for the production of various organic agents through thermal treatments or catalytic reactions,9 and can be used in agricultural and animal husbandry as a silage additive.10 At the industrial scale, HCOOH is mainly produced from methyl formate, which is synthesised from CH3OH and CO in the presence of a strong salt base. However, this method requires a large excess of water and the disposal of accumulated by-products.11 As the market for formic acid is estimated to exceed $600 million by 2019,12 it is highly desirable to develop clean and renewable HCOOH production processes based on CO2 conversion with solar-, wind- and/or hydropower.
In previous studies, Ru complex catalysts were used for selective CO2 reduction to HCOOH.3 Although high efficiency (faradic efficiency over 70%) was achieved, the Ru-complex was precluded from broad use due to its high cost and complicated synthesis. To achieve low-cost and easy preparation, numerous types of metals and alloys were proposed as CO2-reduction catalysts13–23 such as Zn,24,25 Cu,26–34 Ag,35–37 Au,38,39 Cu–Au,40etc. These materials can catalyse CO2 reduction owing to their d-electron availability10 and low surface CO2 adsorption strengths.41 However, only a few metals can achieve selective CO2 to HCOOH conversion with low efficiency and high overpotential.42 It is known that different CO2 reduction products are generated via different pathways depending on the balance of the adsorption strengths of reduction intermediates (CO2˙− anion radicals and CO˙ radicals) on the catalyst surface.7,29,43–46 Thus we anticipated that the selective conversion of CO2 to HCOOH can be realized by tuning the chemisorption strengths of the reduction intermediates on the catalyst surface through rational alloying of elemental metals with different adsorption abilities.
Herein, we report that an alloy of Cu and Zn (Cu–Zn), which is historically called “poor man's gold” due to its abundance, non-toxicity, and brilliant finish, can selectively convert CO2 to HCOOH in aqueous media at room temperature probably because the chemisorption strengths of CO2˙− and CO˙ radicals were regulated to an ideal condition for the CO2 to HCOOH conversion.
In previous studies, a Cu–Zn alloy electrode was reported to be used in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction47,48 and a Cu-modified zinc oxide was reported to function as a CO2 hydrogenation catalyst at high temperatures.49–51 However in this study, we have successfully materialized Cu–Zn alloy catalysts as film electrodes and SrTiO3-supported nanoparticles for the electrochemical/photoelectrochemical reduction and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. The CO2 reduction activity of the Cu–Zn catalysts was firstly optimised by tuning the alloy composition of the film electrodes to Cu:Zn = 5:8 (Cu5Zn8). The Cu5Zn8 film catalyst further exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical performance for the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH under UV light when used as the cathode in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) equipped with mesoporous SrTiO3 photoanodes. It was finally demonstrated that Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 can also serve as an efficient photocatalyst that selectively promotes the desired CO2-to-HCOOH conversion under UV irradiation.
2. Experimental and evaluation
2.1 Preparation of Cu–Zn film electrodes
Titanium (Ti) metal sheets (99.5%, Nilaco Co.) were used as the substrate to fabricate electrodes. Pure Cu films with a thickness of 50 nm were sputtered onto the surface of the Ti sheets. These Cu-coated Ti sheets served as pure Cu electrodes in the control group. The prepared Cu-coated Ti sheets were placed in vacuum-sealed quartz ampoules with pure zinc (Zn) metal grains. The vacuum-sealed ampoules were then heated in an electric oven to temperatures higher than the melting point of Zn (>419 °C at ambient pressure) such that the Cu-coated Ti sheets were annealed in Zn vapour for 1 h to yield the Cu–Zn film electrodes. The Zn concentration of the Cu–Zn film electrode was controlled by tuning the Zn vapour pressure, which was dependent on the heating temperature.
2.2 Preparation of SrTiO3 photoanodes
SrTiO3 paste was prepared from commercial SrTiO3 powder (ALDRICH, nanopowder, <100 nm particle size, >99.5% trace metal basis). Mesoporous SrTiO3 films 8 μm thick were prepared on FTO glass substrates by screen-printing the SrTiO3 paste over the surface, which were further annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to yield mesoporous SrTiO3 electrodes. Exposed surface of the FTO substrate was covered with heat-resistant insulating tapes for an electrochemical measurement.
2.3 Preparation of Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder
Pure Cu nanoparticles were first deposited onto the surface of the SrTiO3 powder to obtain Cu nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder. An aliquot (2 g) of SrTiO3 powder was dispersed in 40 mL of distilled water that contained 5.28 mg of CuCl2·2H2O. This solution was stirred overnight in an argon (Ar) atmosphere and cooled in an ice bath. An adequate amount of NaBH4 solution (>0.61 mL of 1 M solution) was added to this solution to precipitate Cu nanoparticles. The obtained Cu nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder was collected by centrifugation and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 hours. The Cu nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder was then vacuum-sealed in quartz ampoules with pure Zn grains and heated at elevated temperatures for 2 days to yield the desired Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder.
2.4 Electrochemical CO2-reduction performance tests
The prepared Cu–Zn film electrodes, pure Pt plates, and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Air-tight electrochemical cells were half filled with a 0.1 M aqueous solution of KHCO3. The Cu–Zn film electrodes were cleaned by 10 cycles of repeated cyclic voltammetry in the electrolyte solution: starting bias (E0) = −0.9 V, 1st operating bias (E1) = −1.8 V, and 2nd operating bias (E2) = −0.1 V, with slope 90 mV s−1. Either CO2 or Ar gas was purged into this electrolyte solution prior to the performance test.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical CO2-reduction performance tests
An H-type glass cell was used for the photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction over the Cu–Zn film electrodes. The Cu–Zn film electrodes were used as the cathode, while the prepared mesoporous SrTiO3 electrodes were used as the photoanode (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The cathodic- and anodic sides of the glass cell were separated by a Nafion membrane. The electrolyte on the cathodic side was a CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 solution and that on the anodic side was a 0.01 M NaOH solution containing 0.1 M KCl. During the performance tests, the anodic side was irradiated with UV light (Hg–Xe lamp (240–300 nm), LA-410UV, Hayashi Ltd., see the spectrum of the light source in the ESI (Fig. S2†)). The gaseous products in the headspace such as CH4, CO, and H2 were quantified with a gas chromatograph (BID, SHIMADZU). The liquid products in the electrolyte solution such as HCOOH were quantified with an ion chromatograph (SHIMADZU).
2.6 Photocatalytic CO2-reduction performance tests
A 100 mg aliquot of the prepared Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder was dispersed in a CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 solution that was contained in an air-tight glass reactor equipped with a quartz window. The same light source and chromatograph as mentioned above were used for the performance test. A rectangular quartz cell (10 × 10 × 50 mm3) was used for isotope tracing experiments. For the tracing of 13C, the Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powders were dispersed in 1 mL of 0.1 M KH13CO3 solution into which 13CO2 gas was purged prior to irradiation. For the tracing of 18O, H218O was used as the solvent for the electrolytes. The gaseous products were quantified with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, SHIMADZU).
2.7 
          In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis
The in situ FT-IR spectra were measured using FTIR6100 (JASCO), the catalytic reaction was conducted in a gas-flow reactor with a quartz window (S.T. Japan), in which Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powders were put in a porous ceramic cup. For pre-treatment, pure Ar gas was introduced to the reactor at the flow rate of 100 mL min−1 at 573 K for 1 hour. Heater was only used for pre-treatment. During the catalytic reaction, Ar gas or CO2 gas were introduced into the reactor through bubbling of water to flow humid gas. UV light (Hg–Xe lamp (240–300 nm), LA-410UV, Hayashi Ltd) was used as light source. The Cu nanoparticles loaded SrTiO3 prepared according to the Session 2.3 was also analyzed as a control group. The schematic illustration of the in situ FT-IR analysis was shown in our ESI (Fig. S3†).
3. Results
3.1 Characterisation
The prepared Cu–Zn film electrodes were characterised using hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES; hν = 5.95 keV) at the undulator beamline BL15XU52 of SPring-8 as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The Cu 2p and Zn 2p peak positions for the Cu–Zn film electrode (Cu:Zn = 5:8, see Fig. 2 and the corresponding paragraph) were different from those for pure Cu and Zn metals, indicating that the Cu–Zn film was neither pure Cu nor Zn, but an alloy of Cu and Zn. Fig. 1c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile of the same Cu–Zn film electrode. The reflection peaks at 35.97, 37.89, 43.23, and 62.96° correspond to the (222), (321), (330), and (600) reflections of the atomically ordered Cu5Zn8 alloy (cubic), which is consistent with the expected chemical composition of the Cu–Zn film, Cu:Zn = 5:8. As discussed in the next section, this Cu5Zn8 film electrode exhibited significantly enhanced electrochemical CO2 reduction.

3.2 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the prepared Cu–Zn electrode under CO2 and Ar purging are shown in Fig. 2. Pure Cu and Zn electrodes were also evaluated as control groups. The onset potential of the Cu–Zn electrode was found to be −0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl at the lowest, which was markedly lower than those of pure Cu (−1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and Zn (−1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The atomic ratio of Cu–Zn in the alloys was controlled by varying the annealing temperature under vacuum, as described in the Experimental section. Specifically, with increasing heating temperature, the Zn concentration in the Cu–Zn electrode also increased. Fig. 2d shows the influence of the Zn concentration in the Cu–Zn alloy electrode on the onset potential for CO2 reduction. The onset potential was lowest at a Zn concentration of ∼60 atom%. The Zn concentrations in Fig. 2d were determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental analysis (raw data shown in Table S1 in the ESI†), and the optimised Zn concentration of ∼60% was consistent with the crystal structure (Cu5Zn8) determined by XRD (Fig. 1c).
The reaction products generated by the Cu5Zn8 electrode, pure Cu electrode, and pure Zn electrode under different bias potentials are also shown in Fig. 3. Notably, the scales of the vertical axis for the Cu5Zn8 electrode and pure Zn electrode are about 10 times larger than that for the pure Cu electrode. The amount of HCOOH generated at the Cu5Zn8 alloy electrode was markedly higher than that produced at the pure Cu electrode (<0.03 μmol), which generated CH4 and CO as the main reaction products. The Cu5Zn8 alloy electrode also generated more HCOOH than the pure Zn electrode (<1 μmol). Specifically, under −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the selectivity of the Cu5Zn8 alloy for HCOOH generation was obviously better than pure Cu or pure Zn, as shown in Fig. 3d. It is noted that the faradaic efficiency of the Cu5Zn8 alloy for HCOOH generation was 71.11% at a bias application of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The CO2 to HCOOH conversion efficiency of the Cu5Zn8 alloy catalyst was higher than that of the previously reported Cu–Zn alloy electrocatalysts.47,48

3.3 Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction
We constructed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, in which the Cu5Zn8 electrode served as the cathode for CO2 reduction and SrTiO3 was used as a photoanode for oxygen production from water (Fig. S1†). When the SrTiO3 photoanode was irradiated with UV light, water was oxidised at the anode by the photogenerated holes in the valence band of SrTiO3, whereas the excited electrons were transferred to the cathodic Cu5Zn8 electrode and used for CO2 reduction. The production of HCOOH at the cathodic side under rest potential conditions (without any bias application) is shown in Fig. 4. The amount of HCOOH generated by the Cu5Zn8 electrode was markedly higher than those by the pure Cu- or Zn electrodes, which were consistent with the results of electrochemical CO2 reduction shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 4  Amount of HCOOH produced by a PEC cell equipped with a Cu5Zn8 electrode as the cathode and CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. PEC cells equipped with a pure Cu cathode and a pure Zn cathode in CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 (electrolyte) were used as controls. 
We also conducted the photoelectrochemical performance test under Ar gas at the cathodic side as a control experiment (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The C1 molecule production was quite limited, while H2 production was significant with Ar bubbling. These results indicate that C1 molecules are produced by CO2 reduction on our Cu5Zn8 electrode. In addition to the HCOOH shown in Fig. 4, other gaseous products such as CO, CH4, and H2 in the headspace of the reactor were quantified and are shown in our ESI (Fig. S5†). Based on these data, we estimated the faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production of the Cu5Zn8 cathode combined with a SrTiO3 photoanode. It is noteworthy that the faradaic efficiency of HCOOH production was as high as 79.11%, which is markedly higher than those of pure Cu (28.54%) or Zn (47.68%). In the case of pure Zn, hydrogen was mainly produced through water splitting and only limited CO2 reduction activity was observed. The Cu5Zn8 electrode also had excellent stability, with the turnover number (TON) for CO2 reduction reaching 1458.9, which was twice of that of pure Cu (731.3) under the same experimental conditions. The quantum efficiency of photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction by the Cu–Zn electrode was 0.13%.
3.4 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction by Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder
Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder was prepared using a similar vacuum annealing method to that used for film fabrication, as mentioned in the Experimental section. The prepared Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder was characterized by TEM, XPS, and UV-visible optical absorption, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen in the TEM image, the Cu–Zn nanoparticles were approximately 3–5 nm in diameter and uniformly distributed on the SrTiO3 surface. The deposition of alloy nanoparticles was also confirmed by UV-visible spectra, which absorbed visible light photons according to their metallic plasmon absorptions. The spectral shift observed in the XPS spectra demonstrated that the Cu nanoparticles were successfully converted to Cu–Zn alloy nanoparticles.

Measurement condition: 10 cycles, 3 repetitions, one step = 0.15 eV, 40 ms. (c) The UV-visible spectra of pure SrTiO3, Cu nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3, Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3, and the Cu–Zn alloy nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3. 
Under UV irradiation of the Cu–Zn nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powder, CO2 was mainly converted to HCOOH, whereas CH4 and CO productions were limited (Fig. 6). A negligible amount of hydrogen was detected in the reactor headspace, indicating that the Cu–Zn co-catalyst was highly selective for CO2 reduction. Oxygen production through water oxidation would be proceeded by photogenerated holes in SrTiO3, but oxygen molecules that cannot be ignored already existed in the head space of our reactor and/or were adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst powder as H2O2 molecules.53 Therefore, we tried to prove that the water molecule was an electron donor using isotope trace analysis,3,54 as shown in the ESI (Fig. S6†). When H218O was used as the aqueous electrolyte solution, 18O2 (m/z = 36) generation was detected. This result strongly suggests that water molecules served as the electron donor in our photocatalyst system, which is consistent with photosynthesis in natural plants. We also analysed the gas-phase products in the headspace under 13CO2 (m/z = 45) isotope bubbling with light irradiation. As a result, gas phase 13CO (m/z = 29) was detected, indicating that the extracted electrons from water molecules would be excited into the conduction band of SrTiO3, and these excited electrons react with CO2 to produce fuel molecules.
 Fig. 6  Photocatalytic CO2 reduction by Cu–Zn alloy nanoparticle-loaded SrTiO3 powders. HCOOH, CH4, CO, and H2 were generated. 
According to the XPS analysis of the Cu–Zn nanoparticles-loaded SrTiO3 powder collected after the CO2 reduction, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S7†), there was no valence change of Cu and Zn during the reaction, indicating that our catalyst was stable under photon irradiation in aqueous media. The TON for the CO2 reduction of the particulate system was 11.46, which is lower than that of the Cu–Zn thin film electrode system under the same experimental conditions. Even though the two materials were prepared using the same vacuum annealing method, the Zn concentration of the Cu–Zn nanoparticles was higher than that of the Cu–Zn electrode (Table S2†). The XRD pattern of Cu–Zn nanoparticles loaded SrTiO3 (5 wt%) also proved that pure Zn exists (Fig. S8 ESI†). In the case of the particulate system, Zn vapour would be directly loaded on the surface of SrTiO3 without reacting with Cu during annealing. The present modification method with Cu–Zn nanoparticles is facile and applicable to various light harvesting materials to enhance their photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.
4. Discussion
The high selectivity of the Cu–Zn alloy electrode toward HCOOH generation can be explained based on the relationship between CO2 reduction pathways and the state of the catalyst surface. Among numerous studies on CO2 reduction pathways,14,43,44,55 most papers suggest that the formation of HCOOH is initiated by a CO2˙− radical formed near or weakly adsorbed on the catalyst surface.5,42,56 As shown in Fig. 7, when the catalyst surface has weak adsorption for CO2˙− anion radicals, one electron would transfer to CO2 and CO2˙− radicals would be predominantly formed in a state where the C atom is available for hydrogenation, leading to the generation of HCOO−. The Zn surface has very weak adsorption strength for CO2˙− anion radicals; thus, during CO2 reduction, CO2 is converted into HCOO− as the main reaction product. However, due to this weak adsorption strength, proton reduction (water splitting) competes with CO2 reduction in aqueous electrolytes, and the selectivity of zinc for CO2 reduction is quite low.10,14
 Fig. 7  The speculated pathways for CO2 reduction. 
In contrast, when the catalyst surface has high adsorption strength for the CO2˙− anion radical, the radical formed on the metal surface is stabilized by d-electron back donation and would be subsequently converted to the CO˙ radical. If the adsorption strength for the CO˙ radical is weak, the radical would desorb from the metal surface, resulting in the production of CO. In contrast, if the adsorption strength is appropriately strong to stabilize the CO˙ radical on the catalyst surface, the radical is further converted to CH4 and/or CH3OH. Notably, if the adsorption strength is sufficiently strong, the metal surface will be occupied by the CO˙ radical, leading to deactivation of the catalyst. In the case of Cu and Cu oxides, although the CO2 reduction properties were previously reported,26,28,34,57–61 their adsorption and desorption strength with CO2 was so strong that the CO2 radicals can be adsorbed on the Cu surface,62 causing the generation of CH4 and/or CH3OH.
By combining Cu with Zn at the atomic scale, the surface adsorption and desorption would take place at the interface between Cu and Zn in the alloy compound. Specifically, the adsorption strength for both the CO2˙− anion radical and CO˙ radical decreased, and thus, HCOOH was mainly generated as a CO2 reduction product. By combining Cu and Zn at the atomic scale in an alloy, high selectivity for HCOOH formation and suppression of hydrogen production were achieved. This proposal is also supported by computational study on the free binding energies of hydrogen and *COOH of intermetallic alloys including Cu–Zn alloy.63 In the present study, in situ FT-IR analysis was operated to verify our proposal, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S9†), in humid CO2 under UV irradiation, bidentate surface carbonate were recognized in the case of Cu–Zn nanoparticles loaded SrTiO3 powders while monodentate surface carbonate was detected from Cu nanoparticles loaded SrTiO3 powders. These results provide a plausible explanation for the high selectivity of HCOOH generation of Cu–Zn catalyst.
5. Conclusions
The Cu–Zn alloy catalyst developed here was prepared from abundant and environmentally friendly materials, and exhibited high conversion efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to organic molecules, particularly HCOOH. The Cu–Zn alloy catalyst can be used as an electrode for electrochemical CO2 reduction, or combined with a photoanode for photoelectrochemical reactions. The faradaic efficiency of converting CO2 to HCOOH was as high as 79.11% in the photoelectrochemical cell, demonstrating that the catalyst had high selectivity toward HCOOH generation. The Cu–Zn electrode also had excellent stability with the turnover number (TON) for CO2 reduction reaching 1458.9, which was twice that of pure Cu (731.3). The quantum efficiency of the photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction by the Cu–Zn electrode was 0.13%. In addition, we also achieved nanoparticlisation of the Cu–Zn alloy catalyst. When the Cu–Zn nanoparticles were loaded onto the surface of SrTiO3, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was promoted under UV-light. We demonstrated that the Cu–Zn alloy catalyst exhibited high efficiency, stability, and selectivity for CO2 reduction in the electrode system as well as the particulate photocatalyst. The ability to selectively regulate CO2 reduction using the Cu–Zn alloy catalyst described here may prompt the development of new types of alloy catalysts with high selectivity for CO2 reduction.
