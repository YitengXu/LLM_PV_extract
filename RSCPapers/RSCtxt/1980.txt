    , Accepted 11th November 2010First published on 6th December 2010AbstractWe describe the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a supramolecular trisporphyrin complex on mesoporous TiO2 films. The dye sensitised solar cell performance as well as the interfacial charge transfer kinetics have been evaluated. A large improvement has been achieved with the supramolecular assembly when compared with the individual molecular components when utilized in photovoltaic devices. The advantage of the supramolecular system is two-fold: improvement of the photocurrent and retardation of the wasteful recombination dynamics between the photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidised electrolyte.

Broader context
We show herein how to control the interfacial charge transfer reactions that limit the device efficiency in Dye Solar Cells through supramolecular interactions between the sensitizers. The long-standing proposed use of supramolecular sensitizers in molecular photovoltaic devices is demonstrated and, moreover, higher light-to-energy conversion efficiencies have been achieved.

Introduction
The synthesis of multi-chromophore architectures using supramolecular self-assembly processes constitutes a promising alternative and integration to simply covalent systems. In this vein, many artificial multiporphyrin “non-covalent” assemblies have already been prepared in homogeneous conditions (in solution) through metal mediated interactions. Many of these systems have been designed as bio-mimicking systems of one of the most superb biological complexes known: photo-system II (PSII).1–6 Furthermore, the electron and energy transfer processes that take place in these supramolecular assemblies have been studied in great detail.7,8 The longstanding proposed application of supramolecular assemblies whose photo- and/or electro-active components can be adequately tuned has been the conversion of the energy stored in their excited or charge separated states into electrical (photovoltaic) or chemical (hydrogen) power. To achieve this goal, it is mandatory that the supramolecular assemblies can be incorporated onto solid films of functional molecular devices, such as dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs).
DSSCs have attracted much interest within the scientific community since the breakthrough paper reported by O'Regan and Gratzel.9 To date, ruthenium polypyridyl sensitisers have given the best light-to-energy conversion efficiencies.10,11 However, ruthenium is a costly element and ruthenium polypyridyl complexes show only moderate absorption extinction coefficients (ε ≈ 18000 cm−1 M−1), which would result in the need to fabricate thicker and more costly devices. Therefore, several efforts have focused on the development of new metal free sensitizers in order to reduce the solar cell cost, obtain thinner devices and improve cell voltage.12 A detailed description of the major organic sensitizers used in DSSCs has been reviewed recently.13 Those chromophores have been anchored onto metal oxide particles alone, or in a mixture with other sensitizers (co-sensitization) but rarely employing supramolecular assemblies. This approach could provide further improvements to DSSC performance. Despite this, few examples are reported in the literature employing DSSCs and supramolecular chemistry. Studies involving such assemblies can be roughly divided into the following three types: (a) the encapsulation of dye sensitizers by cyclodextrines forming rotaxanes,14,15 (b) the attachment of a host–guest receptor to the dye, which is selective to electrolyte components,16–18 and (c) the self-assembly of photoactive molecules onto the TiO2 surface.19
Herein, we describe the construction of a supramolecular trisporphyrin assembly on mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 films by means of a stepwise self-assembly supramolecular process. The system titanium dioxide–zinc bisporphyrin–free base porphyrin (TiO2–ZnP–FbP) was reported previously by Koehorst et al.20 using covalently bounded porphyrin heterodimers. This approach was described as an unlikely system for DSSCs due to a competition between electron injection and energy transfer processes (Fig. 1). In spite of this, we demonstrate that the above mentioned competition is not relevant when the supramolecular assembly is used instead of covalently linked porphyrin architectures. Furthermore, DSSC performance and interfacial charge transfer kinetics have been measured for nanocrystalline TiO2 films sensitized with zinc bisporphyrin, MP216, and its assembled trisporphyrin, MP216 + MP151, as well as with the reference supramolecular assembly involving a non-photoactive unit, MP216 + BP (Fig. 2). The authors would like to point out that the aim of this study is to prove the principle that such assemblies can be used in DSSCs to show promising efficiencies and not to show optimized device efficiencies that for obvious reasons are still higher when using ruthenium polypyridyl complexes.21 The optimization of supramolecular systems for high efficiency DSSCs is not within the scope of this work which is solely focused on: (i) how to assemble individual molecular entities onto mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 films through supramolecular binding, (ii) the total characterization of the formation of the supramolecular complex, (iii) their application in DSSCs and (iv) the complete characterization of the charge transfer processes in order to elucidate the reasons for the large improvement obtained with the supramolecular device.

Experimental section
Synthesis
The synthesis of zinc bisporphyrin MP212 and MP216 as well as bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151 was carried out using straightforward standard procedures (see ESI†).22–24 Long alkyl chains were attached to MP151 in order to increase the porphyrin solubility in common organic solvents and, thus, avoid possible purification issues. The synthesis of BP was described by Ballester et al. and can be found elsewhere.23
Optical and spectroscopic measurements

UV-Visible
spectra were recorded using a 1 cm path length quartz cell in a Shimadzu© UV spectrophotometer 1700. The laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were carried out by the same procedure as Durrant et al.25 employing a PTI nitrogen dye laser as excitation source and a 150 W tungsten lamp as light probe. The charge extraction and transient photovoltage (TPV) decay were carried out with a system setup as previously reported by O'Regan et al.26
Device preparation
In the present work two different types of devices are utilized depending on the measurements being conducted. Highly transparent thin film devices were utilized for L-TAS experiments. These devices were made using 9 µm thick films and sensitized with the porphyrin dyes until the absorbance reach 0.4 a.u. at the maximum absorption wavelength. On the other hand, for optimized cell efficiencies, devices were made using 13 µm thick films consisting of a 9 µm layer of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (Dyesol© paste) and a 4 µm layer of 400 nm TiO2 particles (scatter layer). Prior to the deposition of the TiO2 paste the conducting glass substrates were immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) for 30 minutes and then dried. The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto a conducting glass substrate (Hartford Glass Inc. with 15 Ω cm−2 resistance) using the screen printing technique. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. The heated TiO2 electrodes were immersed again into a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled before dye adsorption. For the thin film devices the area was 1 cm2 while for the optimized thick film DSSC the active area was 0.16 cm2. The counter electrode was made by spreading a 10 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in ethanol onto a conducting glass substrate with a small hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using vacuum, followed by heating at 390 °C for 15 min. A MP216dye solution of 300 µM in chlorobenzene was prepared and the film immersed at room temperature for 24 hours. For the supramolecular assemblies MP216 + BP and MP216 + MP151, a 300 µM chlorobenzene solution that contained a mixture of zinc bisporphyrin MP216 and its complementary bipyridyl moiety was prepared and the film immersed for 24 hours. It is worth pointing out that the stepwise supramolecular assembly can also be attained by the subsequent film immersion in a MP216 solution for 24 hours and into a BP or MP151 solution for an additional 48 hours, attaining identical solar cell performance in both procedures. The sensitized electrodes were then washed with ethanol and dried under air. Finally, the working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn) frame that melts at 100 °C. Electrolyte LP2 consisted of 0.6 M butyl-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.05 M iodine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (1:1). In this case, well-known additive tert-butylpyridine was not used because it could compete with the bipyridyl ligand in the supramolecular assembly, affecting the solar cell performance.
Device characterization
The photovoltaic measurements were carried out with a 150 W solar simulator from ABET© Technologies with the appropriate set of filters for the correct simulation of the 1.5 AM G solar spectrum. The incident light power was measured as 1000 W m−2 with a calibrated Silicon photodiode, with the spectral sensitivity close to this value for the devices under examination. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The current to voltage (I–V) curve was measured automatically with home-built Labview© software. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out with a home made setup, consisting of a 150 W Oriel Xenon lamp, a motorized monochromator and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. An integrating sphere was employed in order to provide homogeneous monochromatic light distribution over the whole active area of the devices. In addition, photocurrent and irradiated light intensity were measured simultaneously.
Results and discussion
The homogeneous (or spontaneous???) self-assembly of zinc bisporphyrin MP212 induced by coordination with bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151 was first probed using UV-Visible titrations in chloroform solution. The incremental additions of MP151 to a CHCl3 solution of MP212 (2 × 10−5 M) produce a small but detectable shift of the zinc bisporphyrin Q bands. In addition, two new bands centred at 515 nm and 650 nm appeared due to the free base porphyrin contribution (Fig. 3). The fit of the titration data, using SPECFIT© software,27 to a 1:1 binding model allowed us to calculate the stability constant value K1:1 = 9.8 ± 1.7 × 104 M−1 and the UV-Visible spectrum of the putative 1:1 complex.28 The relative intensity of the bands for supramolecular assembly depicted in the inset in Fig. 3 corresponded to 0.53 (517 nm), 1 (560 nm), 0.60 (610 nm) and 0.06 (645 nm). Moreover, the high value of the stability constant determined for the cyclic trisporphyrin MP212 + MP151 complex indicates its exclusive formation in the concentration range of the titration conducted and is indicative of the existence of a ditopic axial coordination between bipyridyl porphyrin MP151 and zinc bisporphyrin MP212 (Fig. 2).

Having briefly investigated the solution behaviour and UV-Visible absorption properties of the trisporphyrin assembly, we decided to move to the study of the assembly formation on TiO2 nanoparticles. Our approach involved the use of a stepwise self-assembly process employing high surface area mesoporous 4 µm thick films of TiO2 nanoparticles. Firstly, the TiO2 film was immersed into a 250 µM zinc bisporphyrin MP216 solution in CHCl3 for different times, and the absorption kinetics were monitored at the maxima absorption wavelengths, 555 and 600 nm, until a plateau was reached (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The adsorption kinetics can be fitted using the Lagergren equation:29 (1) where Absmax (a.u.) is the maximum absorption that the sample could reach on the film and Kads (min−1) is the rate constant. The fitting resulted in a Kads = 0.034 min−1 and indicated that a fully loaded 4 µm thick mesoporous TiO2 film of MP216 (Abs555 = 1 a.u., Abs600 = 0.412 a.u.) required 3 hours of sensitisation.
Having observed that the sensitisation time is a variable that controls the extent in which MP216 is anchored onto the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2, two films were prepared with different loadings of MP216, denoted as mid loading (Abs555 = 0.473 a.u.) and high loading (Abs555 = 1.006 a.u.). The next step was the heterogeneous self-assembly of previously anchored zinc bisporphyrin (MP216/TiO2) with bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151. The pre-sensitised film was immersed into a 250 µM solution of MP151 in CHCl3 for different times and the kinetics of the supramolecular assembly were monitored at 517 nm and 647 nm, where the free base porphyrin bands did not overlap with the zinc bisporphyrin absorption spectrum (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Selected absorption spectra for mid and high loadingMP216/TiO2 films after immersion in MP151 solution. Corresponding time: 0 (straight line), 5 (dotted line) and 30 minutes (dashed line). The insets show the supramolecular assembly kinetics, monitored at 517 and 647 nm, fitted to the Lagergren equation. 
The kinetic studies revealed that mid loading mesoporous TiO2 films required 15 minutes (Kads = 0.36 min−1) soaking time for supramolecular assembly saturation whereas for the high loading films at least 40 minutes (Kads = 0.19 min−1) were required. These kinetic results indicated that lower zinc bisporphyrin MP216/TiO2 loadings enabled easy penetration of bipyridyl MP151 free base porphyrin into the TiO2 pores. It is worth noting that in both cases, the final UV-Visible spectra had a relative intensity of the bands of 0.58 (517 nm), 1 (560 nm), 0.58 (610 nm) and 0.06 (645 nm), which was in a good agreement with the UV-Visible spectrum of supramolecular assembly MP212 + MP151 obtained in solution. Therefore, we can conclude that supramolecular species on the film MP216 + MP151/TiO2 had the same geometry, a cyclic trisporphyrinvia ditopic metal mediated interaction, which we found in CHCl3 experiments. In addition, these experiments revealed that no free zinc bisporphyrin MP216 remained uncomplexed on the nanocrystalline TiO2 film.
Once we confirmed that the supramolecular assembly supported onto the TiO2 nanoparticles is identical to the solution experiments, we applied this methodology to DSSCs a step further. Solar cells were made with 9 µm film TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm diameter) plus a 4 µm scatter layer with an active area of 0.16 cm2. As first step, solar cells containing only zinc bisporphyrin MP216 were optimized by controlling the solvent, immersion time and additives used. The best performance was obtained after 24 hours sensitisation time using chlorobenzene as solvent (Table 1). We note that the addition of chenodeoxycholic acid as co-sensitiser, a well-known additive that avoids the formation of aggregates especially for organic dyes, did not have any significant effect on the device performance. This result suggested that zinc bisporphyrin MP216 was bulky enough and it was able to break the possible aggregates formed by π–π stacking.

Having optimised DSSCs for MP216, we proceed to develop solar cells containing the trisporphyrin supramolecular assembly MP216 + MP151. However, it is well known that supramolecular interactions induce a molecular reorganisation and, therefore, the molecular geometry on the TiO2 film for assembled and non-assembled zinc bisporphyrin MP216 moiety may not be identical. It could result in non-reliable device performance results. Thus, no photoactive bipyridyl unit BP was utilised in order to form an assembly with zinc bisporphyrin, MP216 + BP, adopting the same geometry as trisporphyrin MP216 + MP151 on TiO2 surface. Solar cell performances are shown in Table 1. We would like to point out that the electrolyte could not contain tert-butylpyridine, because pyridine derivatives could compete with bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151 in the supramolecular assembly.
Performance characteristics of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5. Higher photocurrent was attained when trisporphyrin MP216 + MP151 was used, confirming that the photoactive unit supported via supramolecular interaction contributed effectively to the device performance. The band appearing at 517 nm on the IPCE spectrum indicates clearly the positive effect of the MP151 moiety on the photocurrent generated and, therefore, suggests electron injection from both zinc and free base porphyrin units in contrast to previous published results for TiO2–ZnP–FbP system.20

Laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) has been used by several authors in order to monitor the charge transfer processes in TiO2 films occurring following light excitation.25,30 We also utilized L-TAS to monitor the e−TiO2/dye+ recombination reaction as well as to record the generated cation spectrum for the supramolecular assembly. In this study, we recorded the spectra of the porphyrin cation for TiO2 films sensitized with MP216, MP216 + BP and MP216 + MP151 upon excitation at 580 nm (maximum absorbance of zinc porphyrin) and fixing the acquired time to 100 µs. The resulting spectra had a maximum at 660 nm and a shoulder at 860 nm (inset Fig. 6) and were identical for all samples (Fig. S2,† ESI†). The spectrum obtained corresponded to the zinc porphyrin cation, which was in good agreement with spectra present in the literature for this species.31 The L-TAS data indicate that photo-excitation of the trisporphyrin MP216 + MP151assembly on the TiO2 film results in electron injection from both free base and zinc porphyrins with the resulting hole generated exclusively located on the zinc porphyrin moiety. The charge recombination lifetimes between e−TiO2/dye+ were measured for all samples exciting at 580 nm and monitoring the resulting kinetics at 660 nm (Fig. 6). The data obtained can be fitted to the stretched exponential function: (2) where A1 is the signal amplitude, τ is the cation lifetime and β is the stretching parameter. Recombination decays resulted in extremely long lived charge separated states for MP216/TiO2 (τ = 150 ms, β = 0.5), MP216 + BP/TiO2 (τ = 160 ms, β = 0.5) and MP216 + MP151/TiO2 (τ = 26 ms, β = 0.3), compared with other porphyrin dyes.31,32 Faster electron recombination lifetimes for assembled MP216 + M151trisporphyrin on TiO2 film were expected, because the extra electrons injected from zinc and free base porphyrin accelerate this recombination.30 However, in this case recombination e−TiO2/dye+ did not limit the cell performance because the regeneration of oxidised dye turns out to be a very fast process, less than 10−6 s, which is on the limit of our system.

Coloured solid lines represent their stretched exponential fittings. Laser excitation was set to 580 nm. Inset: transient spectrum of MP216 + MP151/TiO2 acquired at 100 µs. 
Once confirmed that the e−TiO2/dye+ recombination reaction had a negligible effect due to the long lifetime attained, we focused on the e−TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination reaction. Higher photovoltage (Fig. 5) was obtained when supramolecular assemblies were present, either with BP or MP151. It could be due to (a) a shift in the conduction band of TiO2 induced by the assembly and/or (b) a difference in the recombination kinetics between the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and the oxidised electrolyte. Charge extraction measurements were performed in order to elucidate the charge accumulated in the TiO2 electrode at different cell voltages.33
As depicted in Fig. 7, the TiO2 conduction band remained invariable for MP216 and MP216 + BPcells, as expected, whereas for the trisporphyrin assembly MP216 + MP151 an upward shift of 125 mV was observed. This result is in good agreement with the increase in voltage observed for the supramolecular system as illustrated in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 7  Charge extraction measurements of solar cells containing MP216 (dark circles), MP216 + BP (red squares) and MP216 + MP151 (green triangles) expressing the electron density as a function of the cell voltage. 
Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements have been used by several authors for the evaluation of the interfacial charge recombination reaction between injected electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidised electrolyte (e−TiO2/electrolyte+).34,35 As can be seen in Fig. 8, slower recombination e−TiO2/electrolyte+ is obtained for trisporphyrin MP216 + MP151 supramolecular assemblies compared with the zinc bisporphyrin MP216. As mentioned above, additional molecules attached via supramolecular interactions can induce a different geometry of zinc bisporphyrin moiety, which can act as an effective barrier preventing the contact between the oxidized electrolyte and the TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Indeed the higher photovoltage for the MP216 + BP solar cell supports our hypothesis and, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the supramolecular system shows slower e−TiO2/electrolye+ recombination dynamics. Thus, the higher Voc attained for the trisporphyrin supramolecular assembly MP216 + MP151 can be rationalized in terms of an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band plus slower e−TiO2/electrolye+ recombination dynamics.

Conclusions
In summary, novel zinc bisporphyrins MP212 and MP216 were designed and synthesised to interact through a supramolecular assembly with a bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151. The resulting trisporphyrin supramolecular assembly was characterised initially in solution, where a ditopic metal mediated interaction zinc porphyrin–pyridyl moiety was assigned due to the high stability constant attained. Subsequently, the self-assembly process was characterised on TiO2 film by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The resulting supramolecular complex was assigned as a cyclic trisporphyrin with an identical geometry and ditopic interaction as that observed in the solution experiment. Furthermore, the adsorption results showed that the supramolecular assembly was not dependent upon dye loading, achieving full trisporphyrin formation either with middle or full dye loading on the TiO2 nanoparticles.

        DSSC performances were evaluated, with a 100% increase in efficiency for the supramolecular trisporphyrin MP216 + MP151assembly, compared with both plain zinc bisporphyrin, MP216, and its supramolecular assembly with no photoactive unit, MP216 + BP. Higher photocurrent in trisporphyrin can be rationalised in terms of an extra photo-injection from zinc and free base porphyrin units, as is shown in the IPCE spectrum. Moreover, e−TiO2/dye+ recombination reactions were slower. In addition, undesired energy transfer from zinc to free base porphyrin in our system TiO2–ZnP–FbP did not affect the photo-injection process, in contrast to the literature precedent.20 On the other hand, higher photovoltage was obtained for both supramolecular systems. It has been rationalised in terms of slower e−TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination kinetics, due to the blocking layer effect when supramolecular assemblies are present. Furthermore, trisporphyrin assembly showed an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band, which is also in a good agreement with the higher photovoltage obtained. We would like to point out that inverted system TiO2–FbP–ZnP with a favourable energy transfer process, consisting in an hydrolysed free base porphyrin MP151 and a MP212 derivative, has been attempted in DSSC devices with extremely low performance obtained. Further work to elucidate such low device performance is being carried out.

Broader context
We show herein how to control the interfacial charge transfer reactions that limit the device efficiency in Dye Solar Cells through supramolecular interactions between the sensitizers. The long-standing proposed use of supramolecular sensitizers in molecular photovoltaic devices is demonstrated and, moreover, higher light-to-energy conversion efficiencies have been achieved.


 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the processes occurring in the supramolecular assembly MP216 + MP151 anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2 in a DSSC device. Straight and dotted lines denote the desired and undesired processes respectively. ET denotes energy transfer and h+ the hole position after electron injection takes place.	 

 	Fig. 2  Chemical structures of the molecules and their supramolecular assembly used in this study. The mesophenyl groups are omitted in assembly MP216 + MP151.	 

 	Fig. 3  Selected absorption spectra for the titration of zinc bisporphyrin MP212 with bipyridyl free base porphyrin MP151 in CHCl3 corresponding to: 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 equivalents of MP151 added. Inset: calculated spectrum for the 1:1 complex MP212 + MP151.
