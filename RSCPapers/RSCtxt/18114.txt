    , Accepted 8th February 2020First published on 25th February 2020AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which utilize polymer donor (PD)/polymer acceptor (PA) blend films as the photoactive layer, have attracted considerable attention and achieved substantial progress. Nevertheless, only a few PAs have led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >8% in all-PSCs, and most of them are naphthalene diimide-based polymers. Herein, a series of PAs named PBTI2(xDT)-FT have been developed, which consist of a 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene diimide (BTI2)-alt-3,4-difluorothiophene polymer backbone, where the ratios of 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) and 2-octyldodecyl (OD) side chains on BTI2 have been varied such that x designates the percentage of BTI2 units with DT side chains (i.e. 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100). The side chain engineering aims to fine-tune the polymer chain packing and thus optimize the film morphology. When applied in all-PSCs through additive-free processing, the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based cells yield a promising PCE of 8.32% with the well-known PTB7-Th as the polymer donor, substantially higher than those of the two parent copolymers (6.82% for PBTI2(0DT)-FT and 4.30% for PBTI2(100DT)-FT). This PCE is also one of the highest for additive-free all-PSCs. Moreover, the devices show a good stability with 90% of the initial PCE retained after 400 h. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of side chain engineering of PAs on optimizing the film morphology and improving the PCE.
Introduction
Historically, polymer solar cells (PSCs) typically refer to organic solar cells consisting of a p-type conjugated polymer as the electron donor material and a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor material to form a bulk heterojunction film as the photoactive layer.1–3 Different from using fullerenes or other small molecules as acceptors,4–6 mixing an n-type polymer acceptor (PA) with a p-type polymer donor (PD) provides an all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC).7,8 Compared to fullerenes, the absorption of PAs can be easily tuned using the tool box of organic and polymer chemistry, and a higher absorption in the visible and even near infrared region can be realized for PAs, which could significantly enhance the short-circuit current (JSC) of solar cells.9,10 The more readily tunable frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels are also beneficial for reducing the energy loss and thus achieving a high open-circuit voltage (VOC).11,12 In addition, all-PSCs have demonstrated better device stability, mechanical robustness and stretchability than those of fullerene- or small molecule-based PSCs, which make them great candidates for wearable/portable electronic devices.13 The recent progress in the synthesis of PDs with tailored properties and device engineering has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs up to ∼12%,14 which is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art fullerene-based PSCs.15 However, compared to the diversified PDs with distinct molecular structures, very few PAs can yield all-PSCs with PCEs >8.0% to date,16–18 and those with high PCEs are dominated by naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based n-type conjugated polymers due to their appropriately-positioned FMO energy levels, high electron mobility, and good absorption in the visible region.19 Despite these positive characteristics, the NDI polymers suffer from several intrinsic disadvantages, which prevent the further improvement of their performance in all-PCSs. For example, the most prevalent NDI-based PA, namely N220020,21 (Fig. 1a), possesses a strong aggregation propensity due to the large and rigid NDI unit, which causes N2200 to often suffer from poor miscibility with PDs, leading to imbalanced hole and electron transport.22

To this end, solvent vapor annealing and solvent additives are typically required to optimize the morphology of blend films.24,25 Indeed, the NDI-based all-PSC devices demonstrate significantly reduced performances without post-treatments.26,27 However, such treatments complicate device fabrication and thus enhance the difficulties for large-area and low-cost fabrication of all-PSCs. In addition, the low absorption coefficient of N2200 in long wavelengths is the bottleneck of the photocurrent and efficiency enhancement. To tackle these issues, much effort has been devoted to developing new PAs. For example, Jenekhe and coworkers have synthesized a 2,2′-biselenophene analogue of N2200 named PNDIBS, yielding a high PCE of 9.4% when blended with a polymer, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl))benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-bis(5-thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T), as the donor.18 Subsequently, they replaced a certain amount of 2,2′-biselenophene in the PNDIBS with monoselenophene, affording a series of random copolymers to further optimize blend film morphology (Fig. 1a). As a result, the PCE of 10.1% was obtained in all-PSCs.17 However, these NDI-based polymers have very limited tunability in the LUMO energy levels owing to their strongly localized LUMO profile on the NDI unit, typically yielding VOC values <1.0 V in all-PSCs which limit further development of all-PSCs.28,29 Moreover, other new PAs based on NDI-free building blocks such as 5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,30 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione31 and double B←N bridged bipyridine32etc. were also developed (Fig. 1b), which have improved absorption coefficients and more tunable LUMO energy levels. Nevertheless, very limited NDI-free (or non-NDI) π-conjugated PAs can offer PCEs > 6% in all-PSC devices.33–37
Among various non-NDI electron-deficient building blocks, the 2,2′-bithiophene imide (BTI) has been proven to be an excellent one, and we have systematically investigated the synthesis, structure–property correlation, and device performance of BTI-based polymer semiconductors in the past decade.38,39 Their promising device performance has driven us and our peers to further expand the BTI family. For example, Osaka and coworkers first reported the synthesis and application of 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene diimide (formally thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′′′,3′′′:5′′,6′′]azepino[3′′,4′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6,11,13-tetrone), i.e. the fused BTI dimer BTI2 (Fig. 1c). They have demonstrated that BTI2 is a versatile electron-deficient building block for high-performance polymer semiconductors.23 Inspired by the pioneering work of Osaka, a series of fused BTI oligomers BTI2–BTI5 (BTIn, n = 1–4) with distinct imide group number and conjugation length were successfully synthesized by our group (Fig. 1c).40 The invention of BTIn has greatly enriched the family of imide-functionalized (hetero)arenes and offered a remarkable platform for developing n-type polymers for all-PSCs.39,41 Various strategies such as core substitution,42,43 terpolymeriztion31 and ring fusion44 have been carried out, and as a result the PCE of all-PSCs with BTIn-based PAs has greatly improved from 1% in Osaka's original work23 to 8.9% in our recent work.44 From the perspective of material design, side chain engineering of polymers is regarded as a simple but effective strategy to regulate interchain interactions of polymers, and consequently the packing of polymer chains and the film morphology.45–49 Until now, side chain engineering has mostly focused on PDs used in PSCs with only a few examples on PAs in all-PSCs.33,50–53
Driven by the great success of BTIn-based polymers for all-PSCs23,31,42,44,54 and side chain engineering55–58 for device performance improvement, herein a series of BTI2 and 3,4-difluorothiophene-based random copolymers PBTI2(xDT)-FT are synthesized, which feature different ratios of 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) and 2-octyldodecyl (OD) side chains on BTI2, where x (x = 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100) is the percentage of BTI2 having a DT side chain in all BTI2. When blended with the polymer donor poly{4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7-Th), side chain engineering of PA results in the preferential face-on orientation of polymer chains and improved blend film morphology, which yields well-balanced and high charge carrier mobilities. The optimal polymer PBTI2(50DT)-FT achieves a promising PCE of 8.32% in additive-free solar cells with a large VOC of 1.01 V, which is significantly higher than those of the BTI2-based parent copolymers, i.e., 6.84% for PBTI2(0DT)-FT and 4.64% for PBTI2(100DT)-FT. To the best of our knowledge, 8.32% is among the highest efficiencies reported to date for additive-free all-PSCs. Moreover, PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based all-PSCs show excellent long-term stability in the conventional device structure, outperforming PSCs based on other types of electron acceptors. The results suggest that side chain engineering of PAs is critical for achieving improved blend film morphology and developing high-performance all-PSCs.
Results and discussion
The new random copolymer PAs were synthesized based on Stille coupling polymerization (Fig. 2a), where the BTI2 monomers with distinct side chains were synthesized according to the methods previously reported in the literature.23,54 In addition, alternating copolymers PBTI2(0DT)-FT and PBTI2(100DT)-FT were also prepared for comparison. It should be noted that PBTI2(0DT)-FT (a.k.a. f-BTI2-FT) and the corresponding performance of the all-PSCs have been previously reported by us.54 Here, PBTI2(0DT)-FT-based all-PSCs are fabricated as the control devices for a more consistent study and better understanding of the effects of side chain engineering of BTI2 on film morphology and device performance. The structures of all the polymers were confirmed through the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S10–S14, ESI†) and elemental analysis, which are in good agreement with the feed ratios of two BTI2 monomers. All the polymers have comparable number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indexes (PDI) (Table S1, ESI†), which should minimize the molecular weight effects on polymer optoelectronic properties and device performance. These polymers show excellent stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) over 400 °C (Fig. S1a, ESI†) and the thermogravimetric analysis results suggest that the stability of all the polymers is sufficiently high for all-PSC fabrication over a wide range. Moreover, there are no evident thermal transitions in the temperature range of 35–300 °C for all the polymers in DSC characterization (Fig. S1b, ESI†), which are in good accord with most (semi)ladder-type polymers.39

As shown in Fig. S2, ESI† and Fig. 2a, all the polymers display almost the same UV/Vis absorption spectra in both solution and thin film with absorption bands located from 500 to 700 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of ∼1.84 eV, which are derived from the onsets of thin film absorption profiles (Table S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, they show pronounced shoulders at 590–620 nm in both solution and film, indicating their strong aggregating characteristics even in the dilute solution. All the polymers show nearly identical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels as determined by cyclic voltammetry, which are in the range from −6.09 eV to −6.13 eV for the HOMO and from −3.39 eV to −3.48 eV for the LUMO level (Fig. 2c and Table S1, ESI†). These results are within the error range of the CV measurement. In short, side chain engineering has minimal effects on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting random copolymers due to the comparable electronic properties of BTI2 with distinct side chains.31,33,59,60
The effects of side chain engineering of BTI2 on the photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers as electron acceptors were investigated by fabricating all-PSC devices with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PAs/LiF/Al (Fig. 3a). A well-known polymer PTB7-Th with an Eoptg of 1.58 eV was chosen as the PD, which can form a complementary absorption with our PAs.61 It was found that the blend films with a PD:PA ratio (w/w) of 1:2 and active layer thickness of 80 nm yield optimal performances for all-PSCs. Fig. 3b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the optimal all-PSCs with the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra illustrated in Fig. 3c, and the device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). The all-PSCs based on the parent polymer PBTI2(0DT)-FT showed a JSC of 12.80 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 52.97%, and a VOC of 1.01 V, yielding a PCE of 6.84%, which is comparable to that shown in a previous report.54 Upon further loading the BTI2-DT in the PA, a PCE of 8.32% was achieved for polymer PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based all-PSCs fabricated without using any processing additives. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is among the highest values reported for all-PSCs based on NDI-free acceptors.7,26,27,33 However, as the BTI2-DT content in PA is further increased, the PCE dropped to 6.23% for the PBTI2(70DT)-FT-based all-PSCs. However this efficiency is still higher than that (4.30%) of cells based on PBTI2(100DT)-FT. Notably, without processing additives, most of NDI-based PAs exhibited a severe decline of device performance due to unfavorable blend morphology.19 To our delight, solvent additives were not required in our systems to achieve optimal all-PSC performance; in fact the use of solvent additives resulted in reduced PCEs (Table S2, ESI†). Overall, the experimental results demonstrate that PBTI2(50DT)-FT is a promising alternative to the commercial polymer N2200 for the fabrication of efficient additive-free all-PSCs.

The EQE spectra of all devices (Fig. 3c) fabricated under the optimized conditions demonstrate a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm with photocurrent contributions from both PD and PA. The integrated JSC values (ca. JSC) based on the EQE curves are in accordance with those from the J–V measurements with a mismatch of <5%, which verifies the reliability of our results (Table 1). Notably, the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based devices yield the highest photoresponse with a maximum EQE value of 66% recorded in the 550–650 nm range. In addition, it is noteworthy that a low energy loss (Eloss) of less than 0.57 eV was achieved in all devices (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC, where Eoptg is the smaller value between PA and PD, here PTB7-Th, 1.58 eV). Such Eloss is among the smallest ones in all-PSCs,62,63 which should be beneficial in improving PCEs in all-PSCs, reflecting the advantage of these new PAs.
To understand the correlation between the side chain of the PAs and its device performance, the surface and bulk morphologies of the polymer:polymer blend films were probed via atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. As depicted in Fig. 4a–c, the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(0DT)-FT blend shows rather coarse surface morphology with an average root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.09 nm. In contrast, a relatively smooth surface with an RMS roughness of 1.85 nm is observed for the PBTI2(100DT)-FT-based blend. However, the random copolymer PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based blend film exhibits a moderate RMS roughness of 2.13 nm (Fig. 4a), indicating that the crystallinity and blend morphology could be fine-tuned via side chain engineering.64 Meanwhile, the TEM characterization reveals that the phase separation of all-polymer blends can be readily optimized by varying the BTI2-DT loading in the polymer PBTI2(xDT)-FT. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4g–i, a well-developed interpenetrating network with nanoscale phase separation is observed in the PBTI2(50DT)-FT blend film, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. The distinction of the morphology of all blend films implies that the observed variation in the JSC and VOC originates from the blend morphology and that the miscibility between the PD and PA can be regulated via the side chain engineering of PA.

The morphology of these PAs in neat and blend films is further characterized by two-dimensional-grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The 2D-GIWAXS images and the corresponding line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5. The crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) in the out-of-plane (OOP) and the in-plane (IP) directions were calculated using the Scherrer equation, which are summarized in Tables S5–S8 (ESI†). To investigate the effects of the side chain engineering on morphology, all neat films were prepared under the conditions for optimal device fabrication. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, all the PAs show pronounced (100), (200) and (300) scattering peaks in the OOP direction with different peak positions, corresponding to a lamellar spacing of 26.53, 26.98 and 27.65 Å for PBTI2(0DT)-FT, PBTI2(50DT)-FT, and PBTI2(100DT)-FT, respectively (Table S5, ESI†). The increasing trend in the lamellar spacings results from the increased loading of BTI2-DT with a longer 2-decyltetradecyl side chain (versus BTI2-OD with a shorter 2-octyldodecyl).65 Because of the torsion of the polymer backbone, relatively increased π–π stacking distance was observed in NDI-based polymers compared to BTIn-based polymers. When the third components incorporated have the longer alkyl side chains or different electronic properties, the π–π stacking distance will further increase, which is not conducive to charge transport.19,27,51 In our case, such enhanced π–π stacking distance is suppressed due to the more planar molecule backbone of BTI-based polymers enabled by reduced steric hindrance.31,38,42 Hence, they all have their (010) π–π stacking peaks in the OOP direction with the same peak positions at q ≈ 1.77 Å−1, corresponding to a close π–π stacking distance with a d-spacing of ≈3.55 Å (Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, all PA neat films show comparable (010) CCL values (∼48 Å), calculated from the full-width-at-half-maximum based on the Scherrer equation (Table S6, ESI†). Next, we compared the GIWAXS results of PA with a distinct side chain blended with PTB7-Th at the same conditions for the optimized devices without any solvent additives. The pronounced (100) scattering peaks observed along the OOP direction in the neat films are maintained in all blend films (Fig. 5b and d). Compared to neat films, (100) peaks of the blend films are much stronger in the IP direction. These trends are consistent with what was observed in neat films, that is, an increase in the branched side chain length leads to larger lamellar distances between the polymer backbones but has a negligible impact on π–π stacking. Despite this, the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(50DT)-FT blend shows a slightly larger π–π stacking CCL (4.8 nm) than other blends (Table S8, ESI†). Furthermore, all blend films show a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial for achieving efficient charge transport in the vertical direction.

In addition, to gain insight into the relationship between the morphology and the device performances of the all-PSCs, the electron (μe) and the hole (μh) mobilities of all the blends were measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method under optimized device conditions to compare the vertical bulk charge transport properties of the blends. As summarized in Fig. S3 (ESI†), on one hand, all the blend films exhibit similar and high μh values (μh > 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), while the μe value (μe = 2.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(50DT)-FT blends was over an order of magnitude higher than those of the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(0DT)-FT (μe = 1.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PTB7-Th:PBTI2(100DT)-FT (μe = 7.09 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) blends, contributed by the more pronounced π–π packing structure with face-on orientation, suggesting that charge transport pathways were better formed in the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(50DT)-FT blend films.66–68 Notably, the μe measured in the PTB7-Th:PBTI2(50DT)-FT and blend films were much higher than those of the NDI-based copolymer blend films, likely due to the more delocalized LUMO and the high electron affinity of polymers.19 On the other hand, the μh/μe ratios became greatly more balanced, with values of 2.98 (PBTI2(100DT)-FT), 2.82 (PBTI2(0DT)-FT) and 1.02 (PBTI2(50DT)-FT), respectively. This feature should be of benefit to minimize charge recombination and to reduce the build-up of space charges in the PBTI2(50DT)-FT blend, leading to efficient charge extraction and thus yield the high FF and JSC of the corresponding devices. In order to further investigate the charge transfer properties of the blend films, the PL quenching efficiencies are measured by comparing the PL intensity of the neat PTB7-Th and blend films excited under the same wavelength (650 nm). As depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the most outstanding quenching was achieved for the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based blend with a quenching efficiency of up to 93%, which indicates that most efficient charge transfer might occur at the PTB7-Th and PBTI2(50DT)-FT interface.42,69 The trend in PL quenching efficiency matches well with the observed trend in JSC and FF, suggesting that the exciton dissociation and energy transfer process in the blend can be improved by subtle changes of the alky chain length in PAs.

Based on the previous studies,70,71 polymers feature a long polymer chain and thus entangle a polymer network, along with reduced freedom of motion of the long polymer chain and less gain of entropy,7 enabling higher D/A phase stability of all-polymer bulk heterojunction blend films compared to that of polymer/small molecule. Therefore, it can be expected that the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based all-PSCs have better stability than other types of PSCs. As depicted in Fig. 6 and Tables S10, S11 (ESI†), The device stabilities of the all-PSCs made from the same donor PTB7-Th but different representative types of electron acceptors including PC71BM, ITIC, N2200 and copolymer PBTI2(100DT)-FT were measured and are compared in Fig. 6. The devices were stored in a nitrogen-filled glove box at room temperature under dark conditions. The PCEs of the small molecular acceptor PC71BM and ITIC-based device rapidly decomposed in a short time with about 70% of its initial PCE after 100 h and gradually declined to 50% after 240 h. In contrast, the three PA-based devices show much longer lifetimes with >80% of the initial PCEs maintained after 400 h, in particular, the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based device exhibits the best stability among all the tested devices and holds approaching 90% of its initial PCE. N2200 and PBTI2(100DT)-FT-based devices retain around 82% of their initial PCEs, respectively. Moreover, the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based device also keeps 97% of the initial JSC compared to those of PBTI2(100DT)-FT (93%), N2200 (90%), ITIC (65%) and PC71BM (50%) after 400 h (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the superiority of PBTI2(50DT)-FT is greater than other types of electron acceptors in morphology and relevant device stability.
Conclusion
In summary, we present our design approach and synthetic strategy to develop high-performance polymer acceptors without typical naphthalene diimide for applications in all-polymer solar cells. 2,5-Bis(2-thienyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene diimide is used here as the electron-deficient unit together with difluorothiophene as the donor co-unit to yield a series of new random copolymer acceptors PBTI2(xDT)-FT. The side-chain engineering strategy is employed to improve the miscibility between polymer acceptors and polymer donors to optimize blend film morphology and enhance device performance of all-PSCs. With various characterization techniques, we have carefully examined the polymer acceptors with a focus on the structure–property–performance relationship. Among the polymers, the random polymer PBTI2(50DT)-FT was found to greatly outperform the control copolymers (i.e. 6.84% PCE for PBTI2(0DT)-FT and 4.30% PCE for PBTI2(100DT)-FT), showing a promising PCE of 8.32% without using any processing additives, which is among the highest values reported so far for additive-free all-PSCs. In addition, the PBTI2(50DT)-FT-based all-PSCs exhibit a good lifetime with 90% of the initial PCE retained after 400 h storage, which is higher than that of the state-of-the-art polymer acceptor N2200 under the same conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that side chain engineering of polymer acceptors is a highly effective approach to optimize polymer chain packing and film morphology and thus yield greatly improved device performance in all-PSCs.
