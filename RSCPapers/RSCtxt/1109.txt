    , Accepted 22nd March 2023First published on 22nd March 2023AbstractLow-dimensional semiconductors can be used for the fabrication of various optoelectronic devices due to their fascinating structures and physical properties. Herein, one-dimensional single-crystalline antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) rods with tunable lengths/diameters were synthesized via a hydrothermal approach followed by thermal treatment. Comprehensive structural characterizations and theoretical simulations revealed that annealing in H2/Ar can further remove the sulfur residue on the pristine Sb2S3 surface and improve the crystallinity of the rods with a reduced number of structural defects. The resultant high-quality Sb2S3 rods manifested impressive optoelectronic properties. As a proof-of-concept, a single Sb2S3 rod photodetector was fabricated and tested. The device manifested good response rate (5.10 A W−1), high external quantum efficiency (1130.7%), fast rise/decay time during on/off switching (4.03/4.08 ms), and a good detection rate (2.16 × 1010 Jones, herein “Jones” are the unit of detection rate by default). The photodetector also displayed a high switching ratio of 109.8 under 560 nm monochromatic light. The photodetection performance is superior or comparable to recently reported systems. Our results highlight the importance of the fine control of crystallinity, purity and defects (density) of semiconductors through rational post treatment for optoelectronic applications. The Sb2S3 rods may also find potential applications in other optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Modern (opto)electronic devices need a high working efficiency, fast response, low operation power consumption and manufacture lost. In particular, organic–inorganic or all-inorganic perovskites have evolved as very promising optoelectronic materials with emerging applications in photovoltaics and various detectors.1 As typical optoelectronic devices, photodetectors have broad applications from daily consumer electronics to environmental monitoring, memory storage, space research, optical communications, and the internet of things (IoT).
A photodetector can work in several ways based on its configurations, such as via photoconduction, photoelectrochemical, and photodiode actions. Among them, photoconduction-type detectors have the simplest device architecture and only need a certain bias voltage to attain reasonable detectivity. In addition, the photodetector performance is heavily dependent on the (opto)electronic properties of semiconductors.
Recently, metal chalcogenides have attracted wide attention due to their non-toxicity, low cost and convenient synthesis. They are widely used in the fields of photocatalysis,2 energy storage, photovoltaics and optoelectronic devices. Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a typical metal chalcogenide, with a direct bandgap, Eg, of 1.5–2.2 eV,3–7 a high absorption coefficient (α > 105 cm−1), and environmental benignity. Typically, Sb2S3 has an orthorhombic structure made up of infinite parallel Sb4S6 molecular chains.8 Owing to its strong light absorption capability in the visible light region, Sb2S3 has shown promising applications in the optoelectronic fields, such as a light absorption layer in solar cells and photodetectors.9,10
The optoelectronic properties of Sb2S3 are heavily dependent on its crystallinity, morphology, surface (chemistry), defect types and concentrations.11,12 For solar cell applications, Sb2S3 thin films have been obtained using a solution-based deposition method followed by annealing. This method offers control of the film thickness, crystallinity, composition and grain boundaries. The as-formed Sb2S3 thin films can act as a light absorbing layer. Moreover, the films can be sandwiched between an inorganic electron transport layer and polymer hole transport layer (HTL)13–16 to construct solar cells. Recently, the Tang group17 reported a monitorable chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach for the synthesis of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films. The as-prepared thin films were used in solar cells, attaining a champion photoelectric conversion efficiency of 8.27%. In addition, polycrystalline Sb2S3 thin films have been deposited by thermal evaporation following thermal treatment.18,19
Notably, Sb2S3 thin films can also be employed to construct photodetectors.20 For example, Bera et al.21 prepared Sb2S3 thin films via a CBD method. After coupling with a spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor, a p–n heterojunction diode type photodetector could be fabricated. The responsivity of Sb2S3-based hybrid photodetectors could be further improved by introducing another oxide layer as a hole barrier. For example, Jia et al.22 attached a TiO2 layer underneath an Sb2S3 film to create a space depletion region. The TiO2 blocked the photogenerated holes and boosted the photodetection properties and polarization sensitivity of the device.
However, polycrystalline Sb2S3 thin films possess many grain boundaries. The grain boundaries scatter the charge carriers and affect their transport. Low-dimensional single-crystalline Sb2S3 exhibits high charge transport capability, showing promise for use in optoelectronic applications.23 Interestingly, Sb2S3 can be grown into one-dimensional (1D) wires or rods due to its unique anisotropic crystal structure. Refluxing,24 sulfur-assisted steam transfer,25 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods26,27 have been proposed to synthesize 1D (nano)structures. Among them, the CVD method can be used to obtain Sb2S3 wires/rods/tubes with a relatively high crystal quality.27,28 However, this method is associated with high production costs and can exhibit poor reproducibility. In comparison, the hydrothermal approach serves as an alternative route by which to fabricate 1D Sb2S3 structures on a large scale at a low reaction temperature.29 This presents a new opportunity for device integration and optoelectronic applications.
However, the Sb2S3 products prepared via hydrothermal approaches can have a relatively low crystallinity with a high defect density. Moreover, the surface and/or interfacial chemistry of a semiconductor material can play a critical role in affecting its optoelectronic properties. Notably, the Cao group30 reported the fabrication of CdS/CdSe quantum dot (QD) co-sensitized solar cells. In their work, ZnSe was coated on the QD surface as a passivation layer. The deposition sequence of the ZnSe passivation layer greatly affected the surface/interface composition and photoelectric conversion performance of the solar cells. Therefore, the mild hydrothermal synthesis of 1D Sb2S3 paired with a rational post treatment could be vital for its applications in various optoelectronic devices.
In this work, we report the synthesis of single-crystalline Sb2S3 rods via a hydrothermal route for application in photodetectors. Interestingly, we found that the hydrothermally-derived pristine Sb2S3 rods contain a trace sulfur impurity, which severely affects their optoelectronic properties. Moreover, characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the sulfur residue could not be removed by post annealing in N2. Instead, thermal treatment in a H2/Ar mixture was proven to eliminate the sulfur residue and improve the crystallinity of Sb2S3 with a reduced defect density. This treatment enabled the realization of a Sb2S3 rod-based photodetector that exhibits good performance. Our study highlights the importance and role played by the surface/interface chemistry of semiconductors in determining their optoelectronic properties. We also stress the importance of the rational selection of a post treatment process towards improving the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Antimony trichloride (SbCl3, analytical reagent, AR, 99%) and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O, AR, 99%) were purchased from McLean and used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the Sb2S3 rods
The Sb2S3 rods were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using SbCl3 and Na2S2O3·5H2O as Sb and S sources, respectively. First, 2 mmol of SbCl3 was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water along with stirring for 30 min until a milky white turbid solution was obtained. Then, 3 mmol of Na2S2O3·5H2O was added into this solution with stirring. The color of the mixed solution then turned from milky white to light yellow and finally to orange-yellow. Next, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) liner, sealed and maintained at 180 °C in an electric oven for 24 h. After reaction, the black precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol three times in sequence, respectively. Next, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 8 h in a vacuum oven with a vacuum degree of −0.08 torr. To investigate the influence of post treatment, the dried sample was either annealed at 500 °C for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere or at 400 °C for 2 h in a H2/Ar atmosphere.
2.3 Characterization
Optical images were observed using an optical microscope (SSC-G808). The morphology and composition of the Sb2S3 rods were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta FEG 250, FEI) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs were collected on a Tecnai F30 instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The crystal structures of the samples were identified using a powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD, DX-2700) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. Ultraviolet (UV)-visible light absorption spectra were measured on a UV-4100 spectrometer (Hitachi). The sulfur vacancy defects were measured using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, EMXnano) spectroscopy. Current–voltage (I–V) and current–time (I–t) curves of the as-fabricated devices were recorded on a semiconductor integrated test system (Keithley 4200SCS, USA). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were measured on an IK3301 instrument at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples was measured using a Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer.
2.4 Computational details
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using projector augmented wave pseudopotentials with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional in the Vienna ab initio package (VASP).31,32 Energy cutoffs of 520 eV and 400 eV were used for the geometry optimization of Sb2S3 primitive cells and surface slabs, respectively. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was used during the construction of surface slabs to avoid unexpected interactions between neighboring mirrors. A gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack scheme was employed for k-point sampling with a mesh grid density of 0.05 (2π Å−1). The convergence criteria of the self-consistent field iterations and forces were set as 1 × 10−6 eV atom−1 and 0.01 eV Å−1 for primitive cells, and 1 × 10−5 eV atom−1 and 0.02 eV Å−1 for surface slab models, respectively. During the surface calculations, dipole corrections along the z-axis and van der Waals interactions with a DFT-D scheme were both considered. The adsorption energy (Eads) of S8 or S2 molecules on the Sb2S3 surfaces was calculated based on the following equation:Eads = Emol/surface − Esurface − Emolwhere Emol/surface, Esurface and Emol represent the total electronic energies of the entire system (a surface adsorbed with one S8/S2 molecule), pristine surface, and one S8 or S2 molecules in the vacuum, respectively.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed at 773 K using a canonical (NVT) ensemble with a Nosé–Hoover thermostat. The integration time step was 1 fs and the total simulation time was 3 ps.
The calculated results were visualized with the help of VESTA.33 Some pre-/post-treatments of the settings of the calculations were performed with the assistance of VASPKIT.34
2.5 Preparation of the Sb2S3 rod-based photodetector
A small amount of Sb2S3 powder was dispersed in absolute ethanol under mild sonication. For device fabrication, 10 μL of Sb2S3 liquid was dropped onto SiO2/Si substrate and allowed to dry naturally. After that, 50 nm Au electrodes were deposited on the modified substrate by electron beam evaporation.
3. Results and discussion
The Sb2S3 rods were synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction using SbCl3 and Na2S2O3 as Sb3+ and S2− sources, respectively, as schematically shown in Fig. 1a. The Sb2S3 sample without post-treatment in a typical reaction (180 °C, ∼24 h) is defined as “p-Sb2S3” hereafter (where “p” represents “pristine”). SEM reveals it comprises rods with lengths of up to ∼100 μm and diameters of 0.2–3 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). The large aspect ratio of the rods with low aggregation makes them suitable for re-dispersion and deposition on diverse substrates for device fabrication. Further experimental trials revealed that the p-Sb2S3 products prepared at 180 °C for 8 and 16 h mainly consisted of rod-assembled bundles (Fig. S2, ESI†). Moreover, the p-Sb2S3 samples synthesized at a lower (160 °C) or higher temperature (200 °C) for 24 h contained both rod-assembled bundles and irregular aggregates (Fig. S3, ESI†). These results suggest that a versatile method for the synthesis of large-sized Sb2S3 rods with tunable morphologies and particle sizes can be realized by carefully controlling the experimental parameters.

After annealing in H2/Ar, the Sb2S3 sample (“Sb2S3–H2/Ar”) retains a well-defined rod shape with a smoother and cleaner surface (Fig. 1b) than its p-Sb2S3 counterpart (Fig. S1, ESI†). EDS mappings of S (Fig. 1c) and Sb (Fig. 1d) and their overlay (Fig. 1e) unravel their uniform distribution throughout the whole rod. The crystal structure of the samples was analyzed by PXRD (Fig. 1f). All the observed diffraction peaks in the Sb2S3–H2/Ar pattern can be readily indexed to pure orthorhombic structured Sb2S3 (JCPDS card No. 42-1393). No diffraction peaks for antimony oxides or sulfur species can be observed, suggesting the high purity of the sample. The lattice parameters of the sample were further determined as a = 11.239, b = 11.313, and c = 3.841 Å using Rietveld refinement (Fig. S4, ESI†). In contrast, the PXRD pattern of the p-Sb2S3 rod sample disclosed the coexistence of a trace sulfur species (Fig. S5, ESI†). Residual sulfur was formed during the hydrothermal synthesis process due to the disproportionation reaction of Na2S2O3: S2O32− + 2H+ = S + SO2 + H2O. The formation of H+ can be ascribed to the hydrolysis of SbCl3 in water. The presence of sulfur has a negative effect on the optoelectronic performance of the Sb2S3 rod-based photodetector device. Moreover, although sulfur has a relatively low boiling point (ca. 444.6 °C), the sulfur residue could not be simply removed by annealing the p-Sb2S3 sample under a pure N2 atmosphere for 2 h at 500 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†). To further uncover the underlying mechanism for the interactions between the existing sulfur with p-Sb2S3, DFT calculations were carried out. The results prove that the S8 molecule can be stably adsorbed on the Sb2S3 surface with an adsorption energy (Eads) of −0.69 eV (Fig. S7a, ESI†). Moreover, if a small S2 molecule is considered, an even stronger chemisorption can exist via the formation of interfacial Sb–S bonds between the surface exposed Sb and S atoms from S2 (Fig. S7b, ESI†), leading to a higher Eads of −1.22 eV. Further, AIMD simulations suggest that the S8 molecule migrates on the Sb2S3 surface instead of escaping to vacuum when the system is heated at ∼500 °C for a period of 3 ps (Movie S1, ESI†). This result is roughly in agreement with the PXRD of the p-Sb2S3 sample after annealing at 500 °C under N2 (Fig. S6, ESI†). Instead, when the p-Sb2S3 sample was subject to annealing in a H2/Ar mixture, H2 reacted with residual S to form H2S gas, which can escape from the Sb2S3 surface easier. To verify whether sulfur vacancies were present or produced during the annealing process, the EPR spectra of the p-Sb2S3 and samples subjected to two different annealing atmospheres were measured. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the absence of any noticeable signals for vacancy defects suggests that no sulfur vacancies existed in all three samples. In addition, the annealing treatment further increased the crystallinity of the Sb2S3 rods and decreased the defect density in the product. In particular, the diffraction peak intensity ratio of the (020)/(060) plane in the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample was higher than that in the p-Sb2S3 sample, implying the increased crystallinity of the former with decreased defect density.
Raman spectra of the p-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3–H2/Ar samples are depicted in Fig. 1g. Five clear Raman peaks can be observed at ∼125, 188, 237, 280 and 303 cm−1, respectively. The peak at 125 cm−1 corresponds to the B2g phonon mode in Sb2S3 and the peak at 188 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration of Sb–Sb bonding. The band at ∼237 cm−1 signals the anti-symmetric vibration of S–Sb–S bonding. The peaks at ∼280 and 303 cm−1 can be assigned to the anti-symmetric Sb–S and symmetric stretching modes of Sb–S bonds, respectively.35–39 Compared to the p-Sb2S3 sample, a higher Raman peak intensity is noted at 303 cm−1 for Sb2S3–H2/Ar, an indication of enhanced symmetric Sb–S stretching due to reduced defect density. The Raman measurement of a single Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod at different positions was also performed (Fig. S9, ESI†). Clearly, both anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes of Sb–S bonds can be noted along the rod, implying its relatively high crystal quality.
The composition and valence state information of elements on the Sb2S3–H2/Ar surface were next studied by XPS analysis. The survey spectrum (Fig. S10, ESI†) reveals the existence of Sb, S, O and C elements on the Sb2S3–H2/Ar surface. The Sb and S signals stem from the Sb2S3 sample, while the O and C originate from adsorbed moisture on the Sb2S3 surface. Fig. 1h and i show the high-resolution XPS spectra of the spin-orbital doublets of the Sb 3d and S 2p species in the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample, respectively. By fitting the curves, the doublets with binding energies (BEs) at 539 and 529.6 eV with a spin-orbital splitting energy of 9.4 eV correspond to the Sb 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 species of Sb2S3, respectively. In addition, the bands with BEs of 540 and 530.4 eV can be respectively ascribed to the Sb 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 species of the trace Sb2O3 on the sample surface due to oxidation after exposure of the sample to air or doping by O.40 The slight oxidation of Sb2S3 could be caused by its exposure to the air for several days before conducting the XPS measurements. In addition, it was deduced that the trace Sb2O3 on the sample surface was amorphous and thus could not be detected by PXRD. Deconvolution analyses of the high-resolution S 2p spectrum revealed the existence of S 2p1/2 (162.7 eV) and S 2p3/2 (161.5 eV) in the S2− anions in Sb2S3. Compared to the p-Sb2S3 sample (Fig. S11, ESI†), the BE of Sb 3d in Sb2S3–H2/Ar shifts towards a higher value (about 0.7 eV higher). Meanwhile, the BE of S 2p moves toward a lower value (about 0.5 eV lower). Such a BE shift implies that charge transfer occurs from Sb to S, indicating the increased crystallinity of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample after annealing.27,41
The morphology and microstructure of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods were characterized by TEM and HRTEM, with the micrographs shown in Fig. 2. The low-magnification TEM image reveals the well-defined rod-like morphology of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample. The rod has a smooth and clean surface (Fig. 2a and b) with a diameter of ∼200 nm. The SAED data (Fig. 2c) exhibit a clear dotted diffraction pattern, indicative of the high-quality single-crystalline nature of the rods. The HRTEM micrograph (Fig. 2d) reveals well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.562 and 0.356 nm that correspond to (200) and (310) lattice planes of orthorhombic Sb2S3, respectively.

The optical properties of the semiconductors are important performance indicators for their applications in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, the UV-vis absorption and steady-state PL spectra of the Sb2S3 samples were measured. Fig. 3a displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of the p-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods. The p-Sb2S3 rods exhibit broad absorption in the visible light range between 400 and 700 nm. Compared to p-Sb2S3, the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample exhibits even higher absorption possibly due to its improved crystallinity with reduced defect density. Fig. 3b presents the relationship between (αhν)2 and hν derived from Fig. 3a. The optical band gap (Eg) values of the p-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods can be respectively calculated as 1.59 and 1.61 eV using the Tauc equation.42 Further, the Urbach energy (Eu) can be calculated from the absorption edge. Typically, Eu can be derived from the following equation:  where α is the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant and hv is the photon energy. The calculated results show that the Eu value for the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample is lower than that of the p-Sb2S3 sample. This indicates the reduced band-edge trap states in the Sb2S3–H2/Ar sample. PL spectra of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods (Fig. 3c) reveal only one strong luminous peak at ca. 740 nm, suggesting the high purity and crystallinity of the sample. In addition, we conducted PL tests on a single Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod by linear scanning at several different positions (Fig. 3d–f). Most of the PL peaks at different positions of the single rod were in agreement with the data in Fig. 3c, albeit with a decreased peak intensity at some spots possibly caused by the damage resulting from continuous illumination.

To study the optoelectronic properties, we fabricated a single Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod photodetector device by depositing Au electrodes on it, as schematically shown in Fig. 4a. An SEM image of a Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod with covered Au electrodes is shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that the two ends of a single Sb2S3 rod are respectively placed on the Au electrode, and the width between the electrodes is 10 μm. To probe the device's optoelectronic properties, its current–voltage (I–V) curves were firstly tested in the dark and under the illumination of 560 nm monochromatic light at a light power density of 110 μW cm−2 (Fig. S12, ESI†). Clearly, the as-fabricated device shows a high switching ratio of ca. 109.8 due to the high crystal quality of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod. Fig. 4c displays the I–V curves of the device at various light power densities from 20 to 110 μW cm−2. Overall, the device exhibits a good photocurrent response as a function of increase in light intensity. Also, the current response under negative bias voltage is slightly smaller than that under positive bias voltage. This phenomenon is probably due to the existence of a weak built-in electric field caused by the formation of a weak Sb2S3/Au Schottky junction at the interface. The work function of Au is slightly larger than that of Sb2S3. Accordingly, the Fermi energy level (Ef) position of Sb2S3 is slightly higher than that of Au. When they are in contact, electrons will flow from Sb2S3 to Au spontaneously until a dynamic equilibrium is reached where they share the same Ef. Thus, a Schottky junction is formed at the Sb2S3/Au interface. Such a junction can be weakened under larger bias voltages. In addition, the Schottky junction is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated electron (e−)/hole (h+) pairs, contributing to higher photocurrent responses. We also measured the optoelectronic properties of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod photodetector device after its storage for 1 week. The I–V curves (Fig. S13, ESI†) suggest that the photocurrent of the device after storage for 1 week decreases slightly compared to the fresh device. This result indicates that the presence of O and C has some effect on the optoelectronic properties of the sample. This further elucidates the important role of the surface/interface chemistry of semiconductors in affecting their optoelectronic properties. Therefore, for long-term application of the as-assembled device, some additional procedures such as encapsulation may be necessary.

Fig. 4d further depicts the logarithmic I–V curves of the device under different light power densities. Basically, the I–V curves under light illumination show a relatively high symmetry on both sides. In contrast, the dark current shows a zero drift phenomenon, possibly caused by the current instability of the device under dark conditions and the drift movement of charge carriers under bias voltages. In addition, the presence of a weak Schottky junction at the Sb2S3/Au interface can exert a weak rectification behavior and induce the asymmetry of the I–V curve. However, under light illumination, the photogenerated charge carrier concentration is much higher than that in the dark, making the asymmetric behavior no longer obvious. The relationship between the photocurrent and light power density is presented in Fig. 4e. The photocurrent curve versus light power density was then fitted according to the power law IP = APθ,43 where IP, A, and P denote the photocurrent, a constant, and the incident light intensity, respectively. For the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rod device, the non-unity exponent θ was estimated to be around 0.63, suggesting a complex process of generation, recombination, and trapping for the e−/h+ pairs within the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods.
To quantitatively assess the performance of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device, the responsivity (Rλ),44 external quantum efficiency (EQE),45 and detectivity (D*)46 were also calculated using the following equations: Rλ = IP/Popt(1) (2) (3)where IP is the photocurrent, Popt is the incident light power density, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, q is the elementary charge, λ is the incident light wavelength, η is the quantum efficiency, and A and Id are the effective area and dark current, respectively. Fig. 4f shows the curves of R and EQE as a function of light intensity for the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device. It can be seen that both R and EQE decrease with increased light power density, mainly due to the recombination loss in the device. The calculated R value for the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device is 5.10 A W−1. Such a reasonably efficient response can be attributed to the strong absorption and effective charge carrier collection in the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods. Moreover, the EQE value under the same light conditions was evaluated to be 1130.68%. This indicates the presence of more photogenerated e−/h+ pairs with less recombination during the illumination process. Fig. 4g depicts the curves of D* as a function of light intensity for the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device. It can be seen that the D* values decrease with an increase in light power density due to increased recombination loss in the device. Accordingly, the corresponding highest detectivity D* reached 2.16 × 1010 Jones.
Repeatability and response speed are also two important criteria for photodetectors. The time-dependent photoresponse curves of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device under different bias voltages were measured by periodically switching the light on and off (560 nm) (Fig. 4h). The main reason for the selection of several (high) voltages was to test the device stability and robustness of the Sb2S3 single rod device. Clearly, the low and high current conduction states of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device could be effectively modulated by chopped illumination with relatively good repeatability. It was also found that the photocurrent of the device increased with an increase in the bias voltage. In addition, a fluctuation in the photocurrent of the I–t curve could be caused by noise from the external environment and increased instability of the single-rod device with increased test potential ranges. Finally, Fig. 4i shows a single–response cycle of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device. Generally, the rise/decay time constant is defined as the time required for the current to increase from 10% to 90% (or decrease from 90% to 10%) of the equilibrium value.47 The rise/decay time of the Sb2S3–H2/Ar device is as short as 4.03/4.08 ms, respectively. It should be noted that we also tried to measure the photodetection properties of the p-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3–N2 rods. However, the optoelectronic properties of the two samples were rather poor and unstable. In several cases, their I–V curves are not normal due to the negative influence of the coexisting trace sulfur on the surface of the samples. We further compared the optoelectronic properties of our Sb2S3–H2/Ar device with some recent reports, as shown in Table 1.22,48–51 It can be seen that the response rate, EQE, and detection rate of our device have been further improved, although its optoelectronic properties are not very good. In addition, it is expected that the optoelectronic properties of the Sb2S3 rods can be further boosted by optimizing the synthetic conditions. Thus, the Sb2S3–H2/Ar rods show potential for applications in high-performance photodetector devices.

4. Conclusions
Single-crystalline Sb2S3 rods with tunable diameters and lengths were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The resultant Sb2S3 sample contains a trace sulfur impurity, which affects its optoelectronic properties and applications in optoelectronic devices. Experimental characterizations, DFT calculations and AIMD simulations reveal that post treatment can play a crucial role in improving the purity, crystal quality and optoelectronic properties of the final Sb2S3 samples. The hydrothermally prepared Sb2S3 sample after annealing in H2/Ar (Sb2S3–H2/Ar) has no sulfur residue, with a high surface cleanness and decreased defect density. The as-fabricated device manifests good photodetection capability, including a fast response rate (5.10 A W−1), high EQE (1130.68%), rapid rise/decay (4.03/4.08 ms) and high detection rate (2.16 × 1010 Jones) under 560 nm monochromatic light illumination. Moreover, the device also has good switching cycle stability and response speed, which are beneficial for practical application. This work provides new insights into the rational design and controlled synthesis of semiconductors with reasonable post treatments for use in diverse optoelectronic device applications.
