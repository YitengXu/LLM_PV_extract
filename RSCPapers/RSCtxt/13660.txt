1. Introduction
With the continuous expansion and deepening of the world's industrialization process, energy and environment as two major global issues are getting increasingly serious, which restrict the development of modern society.1,2 Nowadays, global energy supply mainly derives from the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which is the main cause of serious environmental pollution and is also decreasing rapidly.3 Green and renewable energies from solar cells, hydrogen fuel cells, Li-ion batteries, water splitting instruments, and nanogenerators emerged as new forms of energy capable of satisfying these needs.4–6 Compared with traditional fossil energy, fuel cells and lithium-ion battery technology offer many advantages, such as high conversion efficiency, low environmental pollution, and mild operating conditions, which have been a primary focus in this field.7–9 In these energy conversion devices, the conductive medium plays a critical role. Previously, the most important ion conductive materials in chemical power sources were composed of a traditional sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer–copolymer, such as Nafion or flemion.10,11 However, the preparation process of these polymer materials is complicated and expensive, and their molecular structure cannot be accurately confined, which is not conducive to the subsequent design to further improve the ion conductivity. Later, researchers tried to use ceramics,12–14 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),8,15,16 and other materials as ion-conducting materials. However, ceramic materials can only exhibit high electrical conductivity under high-temperature conditions,13 and MOFs cannot work in special environments due to their instability, such as strong acids and alkalis, which limits their application. Therefore, it is an urgent demand to develop new materials to further enhance the performance of the device.
In 2005, O. M. Yaghi and co-workers first proposed the concept of covalent organic frameworks (COFs).17 Since then, a great variety of COFs have been reported, including boronate ester-linked,17 boroxine-linked,17 imine-linked,18 azine-linked,19 β-ketoenamine-linked,20 hydrazone-linked,21 triazine-linked,22 imide-linked,23 phenazine-linked,24 olefin-linked,25 thiazole-linked,26 dioxin-linked,27 urea-linked,28 carbamate-linked,29 and ester-linked30 COFs (Fig. 1). The well-defined crystalline structures, excellent chemical stability, large specific surface area, and designable pore environment31–33 of COFs have made them highly designable and functionalized material platforms with great potential in diverse applications, such as catalysis,34 gas adsorption,35 separation,36 drug delivery,37 function devices,38 smart sensors,39 and supercapacitors.40 Most recently, the applications of COF ion conductors in fuel cells and solid-state ion batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their insulating character and intrinsic features.1 Firstly, the unique properties of porosity, high surface area, functional pore surfaces, and rich structural tenability of COFs offer great opportunities to load a variety of guest molecules (such as water, phosphoric acid, phytic acid, polyoxometalates, organic heterocyclic compounds, p-toluene sulfonic acid, etc.) into their pores to improve ion conductivity. Secondly, the ordered structure and uniform and tunable channels of 2D COFs provide well-defined pathways for ion diffusion, for readily investigating the ion transport mechanism. Thirdly, COFs are pure organic materials constructed by pure covalent bonds and have relatively light weight, high chemical, thermal and mechanical stability, and strong membrane processability, which is very helpful for the real-world applications.41,42

Herein, we will give a comprehensive and systematic review of the current progress in the research of ionic conduction, which covers proton conductive COFs and their application for fuel cells, lithium-ion conductive COFs and their application for Li-ion batteries, and other conductors. Particular challenges as well as future application prospects of COFs in the field of ion conduction are critically discussed.
2. Proton conductive COFs and their application for fuel cells
Among many fuel cell systems, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have become a research hotspot due to their outstanding advantages such as high energy density, high conversion rate, and pollution-free emissions.43 As the core component of PEMFCs, proton exchange membranes play a decisive role in the entire fuel cell systems.44 Unlike semicrystalline or amorphous polymers such as Nafion45,46 and its derivatives, COFs have higher crystallinity and thermal stability, a clear pore structure, and tailorable functional groups, which make them ideal materials for the construction of proton-conducting pathways. When COFs are used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cell systems, due to their excellent porosity, the fuel gas may initially pass through the proton exchange membrane and make direct contact, which will lead to a decline in fuel cell performance. However, as time goes by, the water molecules produced by the reaction can play a role in isolating the fuel gas to a certain extent, so that the performance of the fuel cells can remain stable. Proton mobility and ion exchange capacity (IEC) are vital factors for the conduction behavior in COFs. To construct high proton-conducting COFs for practical applications, further concerns on how to increase the concentration of available protons should be invoked. The first is the incorporation of proton donors (e.g., imidazole, H3PO4) into the pores of COFs, which can facilitate the dynamic motion of proton carriers over a wide range. The second approach is mimicking the structure of the sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer–copolymer, Nafion, introducing sulfonic acid groups onto the frameworks by covalent bonds. Indeed, a considerable number of proton-conducting COFs have been successfully reported by these strategies. In this section, the application research of COFs as proton conductors under hydrous and anhydrous conditions is discussed. Table 1 presents summaries of the proton conductive COFs described so far.

2.1. Hydrous proton conductive COFs
The first example of a COF based proton conducting material was proposed by Banerjee et al. in 2014.47 They used 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and 4,4′-azodianiline (Azo) or 4,4′-diaminostilbene (Stb) to design and synthesize an azo functionalized COF and stilbene functionalized COF (Tp–Stb) (Fig. 2a). Because of the irreversible nature of the keto–enamine form, both COFs exhibited high stability toward boiling water, strong acid (9N HCl), and moderate base (6N NaOH). Considering that H3PO4 has the highest proton conductivity among all the materials due to low volatility (>158 °C) and high proton mobility, which can form the extended hydrogen-bonding network utilizing three ionizable O–H bonds, the authors loaded phosphoric acid (PA) into the channel of Tp–Azo and Tp–Stb (termed PA@Tp–Azo and PA@Tp–Stb) by a simple immersion method to investigate their proton conductive properties (Fig. 2b). Notably, both Tp–Azo and Tp–Stb showed negligible proton conductivity under hydrous or anhydrous conditions (Fig. 2c–e), which suggested that COFs acted as supports. PA@Tp–Azo showed a proton conductivity of 6.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 under the anhydrous condition of 340 K and a proton conductivity of 9.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 under the conditions of 332 K and 98% relative humidity (RH) with an activation energy (Ea) value of 0.11 eV (Fig. 2f). These results indicated that water molecules play an important role in promoting the transport of protons because of their hydrogen-bond networks. Surprisingly, the proton conductivity of PA@Tp–Stb was almost zero under anhydrous conditions and a poor value of 2.3 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 332 K under 98% RH, which was much lower than that of PA@Tp–Azo. These results showed that the interaction between the proton responsive azo group and H3PO4 existed in PA@Tp–Azo.

Although the conductivity values of these COFs are not very high, it opens a novel direction for the study of COF-based proton conductors. To further improve the proton conductivity, Banerjee and co-workers synthesized thermally and chemically stable bipyridine functionalized COFs through the Schiff base condensation reaction involving TP with 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-diamine (Bpy).48 Notably, TpBpy–MC using mechanochemical routes exhibited lower crystallinity and porosity compared to TpBpy–ST using solvothermal methods. Both TpBpy–ST and TpBpy–MC, similar to Tp–Azo and Tp–Stb, exhibited negligible proton conductivity, which indicated that the COF backbones only acted as the support. Because heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms can act as protonation sites, the bipyridine group has the potential to abstract protons from mineral acids. To further improve the proton conductivity, H3PO4 as the proton carrier was chosen to be loaded into the channels of TpBpy–ST and TpBpy–MC by the traditional immersion method. Interestingly, the obtained PA@TpBpy–ST and PA@TpBpy–MC had a maximum proton conductivity of 1.98 × 10−3 and 2.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 393 K under 0% RH, which was not only two orders of magnitude higher than that of the PA@Tp–Azo (6.7 × 10−5 S cm−1) under similar conditions, but also comparable with that of its MOF counterparts i.e., PA@MIL-101 (1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1). Furthermore, the authors, for the first time, successfully utilized the mechanochemically synthesized COFs as solid-state electrolytes to assemble PEMFCs and to investigate their performance under real operating conditions. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabricated using PA@TpBpy–ST pellets exhibited a solid-state electrolyte conductivity of 1.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.66 ± 0.02 V under 50 °C, which can be maintained for 1.2 h and began to sharply drop. For PA@TpBpy–MC, the OCV can attain 0.86 ± 0.02 V at 30 °C and then increase to a maximum of 0.90 V, remaining stable for 2.5 h at 50 °C. The current (I)–voltage (V) polarization plots showed a maximum power density of 7 mW cm−2 and a maximum current density of 29 mA cm−2, thereby ascertaining the completion of proton-conduction and the cell circuit nature of the COF.
Recently, we created a new stepwise synthesis strategy to develop a series of highly crystalline, porous, and stable COFs.49 A high density of azo groups accompanied by phenolic hydroxyl groups were integrated into the COF structures, allowing azo groups to serve as proton acceptors and load sites for added acids, while phenolic hydroxyl groups serve as proton donors facilitating proton conduction (Fig. 3). The synthesized COF (NKCOF-1) exhibited high hydrophilicity and excellent stability in strong base, strong acid, and boiling water. Upon loading with H3PO4, the obtained H3PO4@NKCOF-1 realized an ultrahigh proton conductivity of 1.13 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 353 K under 98% RH, the highest among all COF materials. The Ea values of NKCOF-1 (0.24 eV) and H3PO4@NKCOF-1 (0.14 eV) showed the Grotthuss mechanism for proton conduction. Furthermore, membrane electrode assemblies were fabricated using H3PO4@NKCOF-1 as the solid electrolyte membrane for proton exchange, resulting in a maximum power density of 81 mW cm−2 and a maximum current density of 456 mA cm−2.

In view of the fact that heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms can act as protonation sites to bind with proton carriers, Micica and co-workers synthesized 2D porous aza-fused π-conjugated COFs (aza-COF-1 and aza-COF-2) with embedded phenanthroline-like units by the condensation reaction of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate (HKH) with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene hexahydrochloride (HATP) or 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride (TAB) to obtain high proton conductivity (Fig. 4a).50 Both COFs showed good chemical stability and can be robust in the presence of 12 M HCl and 14 M KOH for 24 h. Due to the uniform 1D channel and abundant pyrazine hydrogen bonding (O–H⋯N), which can interact with water molecules, the pristine aza-COF-1 and aza-COF-2 obtained proton conductivity values of 1.51 × 10−5 and 8.78 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 323 K under 97% RH, respectively (Fig. 4b and c). The Ea values of aza-COF-1 (0.78 eV) and aza-COF-2 (0.96 eV) suggested the vehicular mechanism for proton transport (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, acidification with H3PO4 can increase the proton conductivity of aza-COF-1 and aza-COF-2 by several orders of magnitude under the same conditions. The authors impregnated these two COFs with 12 M H3PO4, and the obtained aza-COF-1H and aza-COF-2H can achieve a proton conductivity of 1.23 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 4.80 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 323 K under 97% RH, respectively (Fig. 4e and f). The Ea values of aza-COF-1H (0.29 eV) and aza-COF-2H (0.45 eV) were much smaller than those of the pristine COFs (Fig. 4g), suggesting a mixed-type Grotthuss mechanism and vehicular mechanism for proton transport.

When the abovementioned COFs are applied to proton exchange membrane fuel cells, good mechanical flexibility is of great importance. However, the poor mechanical flexibility and disrupted pore channels of COFs have often resulted in poor performance under real fuel cell-operating conditions. Based on this, Banerjee and co-workers later proposed a new strategy by introducing p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) to prepare a series of self-supporting, flexible, and porous COF membranes (COFMs), which are PTSA@TpAzo, PTSA@TpBpy and PTSA@TpBD(Me)2 (Fig. 5a–d).51 In all the cases, the PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized COFMs primarily corresponded to the characteristic peaks of PTSA. When the COFMs were washed with hot water for removing the PTSA, the intensity of the COF peaks at low angles increased markedly, which confirmed that PTSA successfully loaded within the COF pores. Therefore, PTSA·H2O can not only be used as a co-reagent to greatly increase the crystallinity and porosity of COFMs during the growth of COFMs but also be used as a proton donor to make COFMs have high proton conductivity. It is worth noting that these COFMs with the proton donor (PTSA·H2O) were less impregnated (8–12 wt%), but still showed very high proton conductivity, which was better than that of all previously reported COFs. Among them, PTSA@TpAzo exhibited a proton conductivity of 7.8 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 80 °C and 95% RH (Fig. 5e) with an Ea value of 0.11 eV (Fig. 5h). When applied to a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a maximum power density of 24 mW cm−2 was obtained. This performance was also superior to that of all previously reported COF and MOF materials, indicating that COF membranes are feasible when used as proton exchange membranes in actual fuel cells. In addition, the authors also found that the proton conductivity of COFMs increased as their thickness decreased (Fig. 5e–g), and they estimated that PTSA@COFM with a thickness of 50 μm can make the performance of a single battery very close to the most advanced PEMFCs based on Nafion.

The synthesis of COFs by the solvothermal method is currently the mainstream COF synthesis method, but this method requires high-temperature conditions and consumes a lot of resources. Therefore, exploring a green synthesis method to synthesize COFs at room temperature (RT) has attracted widespread attention from researchers. In 2017, Zamora and co-workers published the room temperature one-pot condensation reaction of 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) with 1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (BTCA) to yield RT-COF-1, RT-COF-1Ac, and RT-COF-1AcB (Fig. 6a).52 By introducing LiCl into the pores of RT-COF-1, the resulting LiCl@RT-COF-1 was highly hydrophilic, which significantly increases its proton conductivity. Compared with RT-COF-1 (1.83 × 10−5 S cm−1), RT-COF-1Ac (1.07 × 10−4 S cm−1), and RT-COF-1AcB (5.25 × 10−4 S cm−1), LiCl@RT-COF-1 exhibited a proton conductivity of 6.45 × 10−3 S cm−1 under the conditions of 313 K and 100% RH, which suggested the important role of guest molecules for proton transport. In addition, these COF materials can be processed in the form of flexible membranes, which was extremely beneficial for constructing PEMFCs (Fig. 6b). When applied to a real PEMFC, RT-COF-1Ac showed the best performance with the maximum power density and maximum current density reaching 12.95 mW cm−2 and 53.1 mA cm−2 under the condition of 323 K, respectively (Fig. 6c).

Recently, our group reported a green strategy to synthesize an olefin-linked COF through the benzoic–anhydride-catalyzed Aldol reaction between the activated methyl groups of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (PZ) and 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) under solvent-free conditions (Fig. 7a).53 Compared with the conventional solvothermal approach, which required harsh synthetic conditions, this synthetic method was much easier to control and achieve the large-scale synthesis of COFs. The olefin-linked pyrazine-based COF (NKCOF-10) possessed a high surface area, exceptional chemical stability, and abundant nitrogen sites on the pore wall, which can effectively confine the H3PO4 network within the 1D nanochannels through hydrogen-bonding interactions. The formed H3PO4@NKCOF-10 exhibited ultrahigh proton conductivity (9.04 × 10−2 S cm−1) under the conditions of 80 °C and 90% RH (Fig. 7b), and ultralow activation energy (0.06 eV). The realistic proton exchange membrane fuel cell using H3PO4@NKCOF-10 as the solid electrolyte under H2/O2 operation conditions reached values up to 676 mA cm−2 and 135 mW cm−2 for current density and maximum power, respectively (Fig. 7c).

Considering that the proton carriers loaded on COFs are prone to leak under anhydrous and high-temperature conditions, resulting in unstable proton conductivity, it is more meaningful to develop COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity, which can ensure more stable proton conductivity. In this context, Zhao and co-workers reported on the mechanically-assisted synthesis of two sulfonated COFs by the condensation reactions of Tp with 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (DABA, for NUS-9) or 2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-disulfonic acid (DABDA, for NUS-10) which had one-dimensional (1D) nanoporous channels and were decorated with pendant sulfonic acid groups.54 Due to these densely packed sulfonic acid groups in the pores, which can provide a proton source and adsorb water molecules, the obtained two fully sulfonated COFs exhibited a high intrinsic proton conductivity of 1.24 × 10−2 S cm−1 (NUS-9(R)) and 3.96 × 10−2 S cm−1 (NUS-10(R)) at 298 K under 97% RH. In addition, the authors mixed these two COFs with non-conductive polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and obtained a series of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to evaluate the application for proton exchange membranes. When the COF loading is 50 wt% in the MMMs, the proton conductivity reached the highest with 5.06 × 10−3 S cm−1 for NUS-9(R)@PVDF-50 and 1.58 × 10−2 S cm−1 for NUS-10(R)@PVDF-50 at 353 K. The Ea values of NUS-9(R)@PVDF (0.20 eV) and NUS-10(R)@PVDF (0.21 eV) showed the Grotthuss mechanism for proton conduction.
Along with this design strategy, Gu and co-workers reported two cyano-substituted benzofuran linked COFs (GS-COF-1 and GS-COF-2) which were connected by hydroxybenzene–aldehyde and acetonitrile building blocks (Fig. 8a).55 Unlike the majority of COFs that were synthesized based on condensation reactions, these two COFs were crystallized from irreversible cascade reactions involving consecutive cyanide migration, ring-closure, and oxidation reactions. Due to the irreversible property, the obtained COFs have high chemical stability in both acid and base and can be post-modified synthetically to install predesigned functionality under harsh conditions. Based on this, the authors reacted GS-COF-1 and GS-COF-2 with H2SO4 and AcOH aqueous solution and obtained two acidified COFs (GS-COF-1–COOH and GS–COF-2–COOH). Considering the crystallinity and abundant carboxylic acids on the pore surfaces of the two COFs, they utilized them as vehicles for proton conduction. The proton conductivities of GS–COF-1–COOH and GS–COF-2–COOH were 1.21 × 10−3 and 1.38 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C under 90% RH, respectively. The Ea values of GS–COF-1–COOH (0.29 eV) and GS–COF-2–COOH (0.27 eV) suggested the Grotthuss mechanism for proton transport. To utilize the regular channels of COFs and further enhance the proton conductivity, the authors doped PA into the nanopores of two acidified COFs. Under the same conditions, the proton conductivities of the obtained H3PO4@GS–COF-1–COOH and H3PO4@GS–COF-2–COOH increased to 3.45 × 10−2 and 4.35 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively (Fig. 8b and c). The Ea values for the proton transport in H3PO4@GS–COF-1–COOH and H3PO4@GS–COF-2–COOH were 0.23 and 0.21 eV, respectively. Remarkably, H3PO4@GS–COF-1–COOH and H3PO4@GS–COF-2–COOH exhibited outstanding stability, with the proton conductivity retaining almost no change upon continuous work for 24 h, which originated from their highly robust frameworks.

Additionally, Babu and co-workers believed that a proton carrier linked 2D-polymer can be a better candidate for proton-conduction, and they developed a crystalline 2D-polymer (BIP) composed of benzimidazole units as an integral part, prepared by the condensation of aryl acid with 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene in polyphosphoric acid (PPA) medium (Fig. 9a).56 This imidazole-linked-2D-polymer exhibited lower proton conductivity below 60 °C and 60% RH, which suggested that BIP was not an active proton transporter under anhydrous conditions. However, with an increase in temperature and RH, BIP exhibited a significant improvement in proton conductivity and obtained an ultrahigh proton conductivity of 3.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 under the conditions of 95 °C and 95% RH (Fig. 9d–f), which was highest among that of the undoped porous organic frameworks reported so far. The Ea value of BIP (0.31 eV) suggested the possibility of a Grotthuss mechanism for proton transport (Fig. 9g).

Different from the development of COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity, Zhu and co-workers focused on the porous cationic organic framework and used bromide ions as the counterion to design and synthesize a stable cationic COF, namely EB-COF: Br (Fig. 10a).57 This cation framework prepared by the Schiff base reaction of ethidium bromide (EB) with Tp had high thermal and chemical stability and can be used as a simple anion exchange platform. Through the ion exchange process, the authors prepared a series of charged COFs (EB-COF: X, X = F, Cl, Br, I) whose porosity and pore size can be precisely adjusted. More importantly, by introducing polyoxometalate (POM) into the porous cation framework, the proton conductivity of the COF material can be greatly improved. Zhu and co-workers chose to introduce PW12O403− into the EB-COF: Br through an ion exchange process (Fig. 10b), and the resulting EB-COF: PW12 exhibited a high proton conductivity of 3.32 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature under 97% RH (Fig. 10d) with the Ea value only 0.24 eV (Fig. 10f). In contrast, the proton conductivity of EB-COF: Br without PW12O403− was 2.86 × 10−6 S cm−1 under the same condition (Fig. 10c). This increase in proton conductivity was mainly due to the formation of water clusters around PW12O403−. The interaction between hydrophilic PW12O403− and water molecules can provide interconnected hydrogen bond networks in the 1D pores of COFs to promote the transport of protons.

Similarly, Jiang and co-workers synthesized a triazole functionalized COF by using Tp and 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole as the building units and then loaded it with phosphotungstic acid.58 The obtained COF (HPW@COF) had a 1D channel lined with protonated triazole (triazolium cations) by hydroscopic HPW and neutral triazole as well as counter anions (PO40W123−) and could act as proton-donors and -acceptors forming interconnected hydrogen-bonding networks, thus greatly facilitating proton conduction, particularly under low RH. The authors used this HPW@COF as a filler and sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) as a polymer matrix to fabricate composite membranes. The obtained proton conductivity of SPEEK/HPW@COF-15 (6.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) was 35.5 times higher than that of SPEEK (1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1) and 11.6 times higher than that of SPEEK/COF (4.9 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 65 °C under 40% RH. This work showed that amphoteric N-heterocyclic COFs were promising hosts for proton carriers, which can be used as high-temperature proton exchange membranes under low RH or anhydrous conditions.
The interaction between the skeleton and polar water molecules by enhancing the hydrogen bond network in COFs has been proven to be an effective method to promote proton transport. In order to achieve this purpose, Chen and co-workers established the rational design of a new class of gel guest-assisted, ionic COFs that exhibited superior proton conduction.59 They selected two –N–H bond-containing COFs (TpPa-1 and TpBD) with different porous frameworks as models, which were renamed here COF-1 and COF-2, separately (Fig. 11a). Chen and co-workers modified hydrophilic alkali metal ions (Li+ and Na+) on the skeleton of COFs, and the resulting ionic framework can generate a strong electrostatic field, which promoted the formation of a hydrogen bond network and mobile protons from dense and extensive water molecules. The original COF-1 had a negligible conductivity of ∼10−8 to 10−9 S cm−1 even at room temperature under 98% RH. However, COF-1–Li and COF-1–Na exhibited the highest conductivities of 2.7 × 10−2 and 2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 under the conditions of 313 K and 98% RH, respectively (Fig. 11b), which were comparable with those of the reported COF conductors. Similar conductivity results can also be found in the COF-2–R and PCP-1–R series (R = Li+, Na+). Moreover, a pyrrole/phosphoric acid guest was then introduced into these ionic COFs and “in situ” gelled to further provide multiple H+ diffusion paths. The obtained COF complex thus exhibited a further improved conductivity of 1.3 × 10−1 S cm−1 under the conditions of 313 K and 98% RH, which was even comparable to that of the typical commercial Nafion membranes. Notably, this gelation approach can also make insoluble COF particles into freestanding and flexible COF-based membranes, which can be successfully applied under PEMFC operating conditions (Fig. 11c and d).

2.2. Anhydrous proton conductive COFs
Hydrous proton-conducting materials have exhibited excellent proton conductivity and potential in fuel cells, but they need the temperature of below 100 °C for them to function well. Therefore, the design and development of anhydrous proton-conducting materials for high-temperature (>100 °C) proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT–PEMFCs) are in need. The use of higher temperature in the PEMFCs creates faster kinetics and less CO poisoning at the platinum electrode.
The first example of using COFs for high-temperature anhydrous proton conduction is a sulfonic-acid-based TpPa–SO3H synthesized by Banerjee and co-workers that exhibits intrinsic proton conductivity under anhydrous conditions in 2016.60 The sulfonic acid groups were aligned on the 2D layers at periodic intervals and promoted the proton hopping inside the hexagonal 1D channels. The intrinsic proton conductivity of TpPa–SO3H was measured as 1.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 120 °C under anhydrous conditions. To enhance the proton conductivity, Banerjee and co-workers synthesized a hybrid COF (TpPa–(SO3H–Py)) by a ligand-based solid–solution approach that contains sulfonic acid as the acidic site, as well as pyridine as the basic site, in order to immobilize acidic proton carrier molecules. The impregnation of phytic acid molecules inside the framework increased the anhydrous proton conductivity up to 5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 120 °C. Such an approach highlighted the advantage and first-time use of hybrid COFs for interplaying intrinsic to extrinsic proton conductivity.
On the other hand, most studies are still based on a preconception that large pores eventually cause simply flow of proton carriers rather than efficient conduction of protons, which precludes the exploration of large-pore polymers for proton transport. In this context, Jiang and co-workers synthesized one COF (TPB–DMTP–COF) by the condensation of 1,3,5-tri(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TPB) and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP) under solvothermal conditions.61 The frameworks were designed to constitute hexagonally aligned, dense, mesoporous channels that allowed for the loading of N-heterocyclic proton carriers (Fig. 12a and b). Jiang and co-workers used triazole (trz) as the organic proton carrier for proton conduction (Fig. 12c), and the obtained trz@TPB–DMTP–COF exhibited conductivities of 7.0 × 10−4, 7.7 × 10−4, 8.2 × 10−4, 8.8 × 10−4, 9.6 × 10−4, 1.0 × 10−3, and 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, and 130 °C, respectively (Fig. 12e–h). The Ea value of trz@TPB–DMTP–COF (0.21 eV) showed the Grotthuss mechanism for proton conduction. To investigate the scope of N-heterocyclic proton carriers, they employed imidazole (im) as the proton carrier and prepared im@TPB–DMTP–COF using the same method as for the trz@TPB–DMTP–COF (Fig. 12d). The conductivity of the im@TPB–DMTP–COF was evaluated to be 1.79 × 10−3, 2.07 × 10−3, 2.39 × 10−3, 2.76 × 10−3, 3.19 × 10−3, 3.78 × 10−3, and 4.37 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, and 130 °C, respectively (Fig. 12i–l). This difference in proton conductivity was mainly due to the existence of two lone paired N in triazole, which reduced the proton concentration. The Ea value of the im@TPB–DMTP–COF (0.38 eV) suggested that the proton transport in the im@TPB–DMTP–COF also follows the Grotthuss mechanism.

In 2020, in order to further improve the anhydrous proton conductivity of COFs, the same group reported the topology guided synthesis of an imine-bonded (CN) dually stable COF (TPB–DMeTP–COF) by a condensation reaction of TPB with 2,5-dimethylterephthalaldehyde (DMeTP) to construct dense yet aligned 1D nanochannels, in which the linkers induced hyperconjugation and inductive effects to stabilize the pore structure and the nitrogen sites on pore walls confine and stabilize the H3PO4 network in the channels via hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 13a–c).62 The authors loaded H3PO4 to the channels of TPB–DMeTP–COF by using neat H3PO4 crystals via a vacuum impregnation method (Fig. 13d and e), and the obtained H3PO4@TPB–DMeTP–COF showed a proton conductivity of 1.91 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 160 °C. The Ea value was calculated to be 0.34 eV, indicating that there are low-energy transitions in the nanopores of COFs.

At the same time, Horike and co-workers presented a bottom-up self-assembly strategy to construct perfluoroalkyl-functionalized hydrazone-linked 2D COFs through the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzen with three fluorocarbon-based hydrazide monomers of different lengths under solvothermal conditions (Fig. 14a), and systematically investigated the effect of different lengths of fluorine chains on their acid stability and proton conductivity.63 Compared with their nonfluorous parent COFs, the obtained fluorinated COFs, namely COF–Fx (x = 6, 8, 10), possessed structural ultrastability toward strong acids as a result of enhanced hydrophobicity (water contact angle of 144°). The superhydrophobic 1D nanochannels can serve as robust hosts to accommodate large amounts of phosphonic acid for fast and long-term proton conduction under anhydrous conditions and in a wide temperature range. Upon loading with H3PO4, hydrogen-bonding networks were formed between H3PO4 with the frameworks and perfluoroalkyl chains of COFs which afforded rapid proton transport (Fig. 14b). Therefore, the obtained COF–F6–H exhibited a high anhydrous proton conductivity of 4.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 140 °C with a 62 wt% H3PO4 loading (Fig. 14c), which was four orders of magnitude higher than that of its nonfluorous counterparts and among the highest values of doped porous organic frameworks so far. The Ea value was calculated to be in the range of 0.09–0.54 eV with the change of H3PO4 loading (Fig. 14d). Compared with COF–F6–H, COF–F8/F10–H with the same amount of H3PO4 loading showed lower conductivities due to the lower porosity and crystallinity.

In order to investigate the influence of the hydrogen donor ability of imine functional groups in COFs on the proton conduction, Wang and co-workers synthesized a series of iso-reticular COFs with a similar pore structure and surface area through the condensation reaction of 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)pyrene with 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-dicarboxaldehyde, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde, and 4,4′-biphenyldiamine, named Py–BT–COF, Py–TT–COF, and Py–BD–COF (Fig. 15a).64 Among them, the Py–BT–COF and Py–TT–COF contained hydrogen bonding inactive thiophene rings (Fig. 15b–d). Then they infiltrated different amounts of imidazole into the COFs by vapor diffusion in a highly controlled manner. When the amount of loaded imidazole was 30 wt%, the obtained Im@Py–BT–COF-30, Im@Py–TT–COF-30, and Im@Py–BD–COF-30 exhibited a proton conductivity of 4.23 × 10−4, 5.11 × 10−4, and 5.85 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 130 °C, respectively (Fig. 15e–g). The Ea values of Im@Py–BT–COF-30, Im@Py–TT–COF-30, and Im@Py–BD–COF-30 were calculated to be 0.36 eV, 0.36 eV, and 0.55 eV, respectively. When the amount of loaded imidazole was further increased to 50 wt%, the proton conductivity of Im@Py–BT–COF-50, Im@Py–TT–COF-50, and Im@Py–BD–COF-50 was further increased to 2.92 × 10−3, 3.08 × 10−3, and 8.20 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 130 °C (Fig. 15h–j), which was 6.9, 6.0, and 14 times as compared to that of Im@Py–BT–COF-30, Im@Py–TT–COF-30, and Im@Py–BD–COF-30, respectively. The Ea values of Im@Py–BT–COF-50, Im@Py–TT–COF-50, and Im@Py–BD–COF-50 were decreased to 0.31 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.32 eV, respectively. Even three COFs were iso-reticular with nearly the same pore volume, the proton conductivity of two thiophene-containing COFs (Py–BT–COF and Py–TT–COF) was significantly higher than that of Py–BD–COF, ∼8 times for 30 wt% imidazole loading and over 3 times for 50 wt% loading. This result demonstrated that the introduction of the thiophene ring to the imine COFs induced subtle stronger hydrogen bonding toward the loaded imidazole, which in turn promoted proton transfer along the channel.

Although phosphoric acid and azole doped COFs have shown some advantages in anhydrous proton conduction at elevated temperatures, the present proton conductivity of these proton conductors is still not comparable with that of commercial perfluoro–sulfonic–acid polymers. In order to maximize the proton conductivity of COFs doped with PA and pyrrole, Ma and co-workers believed that one of the feasible methods was to reduce the proton dissociation energy in the COF system so that it is easy to release protons and achieve high proton conductivity.65 In 2020, Ma and co-workers synthesized four targeted 2D COFs through the condensation reaction of Tp with 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP, for TAP–COF), p-phenylenediamine (PD, for PD–COF), 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ, for DAAQ–COF), and ethidium bromide (EB, for EB-COF) (Fig. 16a). These four COFs all contained 1D open nanochannels as well-defined proton transport channels. By introducing Lewis base, polar and cationic sites into 2D COFs, the proton dissociation degree of PA and 1,2,4-triazole in doped COFs can be tuned, which showed that the PA and 1,2,4-triazole loaded COFs exhibited excellent proton conductivities in the temperature range from 80 °C to 200 °C under anhydrous conditions compared with the pristine COFs (Fig. 16b and c). Due to the formation of ethidium–biphosphate ion-pairs in charged COF channels, the PA@EB-COF exhibited a high anhydrous proton conductivity of 2.77 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 180 °C with the Ea value only 0.34 eV, which was ranked among the highest values of reported porous materials. The ion pairs lined along the channels of the cationic COF can not only decrease proton dissociation energy but also act as proton transfer sites.

3. Lithium-ion conductive COFs and their application for Li-ion batteries
The electrolyte is an important part of lithium-ion batteries and plays a very critical role in battery performance. Traditional liquid electrolytes have safety problems such as volatility, flammability, and explosiveness.66 Lithium ions diffuse slowly in the liquid electrolytes, and the migration number is usually less than 0.5.67 At the same time, the electrochemical window is relatively narrow. These shortcomings limit the liquid electrolytes’ further application. In order to solve the above problems, researchers began to focus on solid-state electrolytes.68 In recent years, among solid-state electrolyte materials, inorganic solid-state electrolytes have been intensively researched.69 However, state-of-art inorganic solid-state electrolytes have a large grain boundary resistance inside the crystal and poor compatibility with the electrode interface which resulted in a tough migration of lithium ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Large energy barriers easily affect the performance of battery capacity. In contrast, COFs have good flexibility and processability, good compatibility with electrodes, low interface impedance, and customizable 1D channels and the predictability of the structure allows the functional design of COFs to be realized.70,71 In addition, the chemical stability of COFs is outstanding,72,73 which makes COFs host materials for solid-state electrolytes. Table 2 presents the summaries of the lithium-ion conductive COFs described so far.

3.1. Extrinsically lithium-ion conductive COFs
At present, in order to apply COFs to solid-state electrolytes, the first problem to be solved is how to improve the conductivity of lithium ions in COFs. For this, researchers mainly use two methods. The first method is to introduce external lithium salt, namely loading lithium ions in the pores of COFs to realize ion transport.
In 2016, J. Uribe-Romo and co-workers proposed for the first time that the lithium-ion conductivity of COFs can be improved by immersing COF powder in a lithium salt solution and then pressing them into sheets.74 In this way, lithium ions can enter the pores of COFs and be quickly transported. They selected COF-5 and TpPa-1 as the research objects and performed EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) on the pellets of LiClO4-impregnated COFs to study their use as solid-state electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. The lithium-ion conductivity of obtained COF-5 and TpPa-1 pellets only reached up to 0.26 and 0.15 mS cm−1 at room temperature, respectively, and the Ea value of the COF-5 pellet was as low as 37 ± 4 meV. This outcome indicated that COFs can be used as solid-state electrolytes in Li-ion batteries, but there was still a lot of space for improvement.
Lithium salts simply infiltrated in the pores of solid-state COFs tend to be present in closely associated ion pairs, resulting in slow ionic diffusion dynamics. Promoting the dissociation of ion pairs in solid-state conductors has thus become an important approach for improving ionic conductivity of COFs. Based on this, Chen and co-workers designed and synthesized a cationic COF (named CON–Cl) by the condensation reaction of Tp with triaminoguanidinium chloride (TGCl) under solvothermal conditions, and then mixed the CON–Cl with LiTFSI salt in ethanol solution to realize the anion exchange from Cl− to TFSI− (Fig. 17a).75 The obtained Li–CON–TFSI was expected to interact with the TFSI− anions by electrostatic forces and thereby liberated the Li+ ions for faster ion conduction (Fig. 17b). In this way, the Li–CON–TFSI can exhibit a lithium-ion conductivity of 5.74 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 2.09 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C (Fig. 17c) with an Ea value of 0.34 eV (Fig. 17d). In addition, the average Li+ transference number value of 0.61 ± 0.02 and the electrochemical window up to 3.8 V were determined for Li–CON–TFSI.

In 2018, Jiang and co-workers proposed to introduce flexible oligo(ethylene oxide) chains on the pore walls of COFs, which can form a polyelectrolyte interface in the nanopores of COFs to provide a way for lithium-ion transport.76 In order to verify this idea, they designed and synthesized two COFs (TPB–DMTP–COF and TPB–BMTP–COF) by the condensation reaction of TPB with DMTP or 2,5-bis((2-methoxyethoxy)methoxy)terephthalaldehyde (BMTP) under solvothermal conditions to set up control experiments (Fig. 18a and b). Among them, the TPB–DMTP–COF had only methoxy groups on the pore walls, while the TPB–BMTP–COF had flexible ethylene oxide chains on the pore walls. After treatment with LiClO4 solution, the obtained Li+@TPB–DMTP–COF can achieve lithium-ion conductivities of 1.36 × 10−7, 6.74 × 10−7, and 5.37 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 40, 60, and 80 °C with an Ea value of 0.96 eV, respectively (Fig. 18c–e). As a comparison, the lithium-ion conductivities of Li+@TPB–BMTP–COF under the same conditions were 6.04 × 10−6, 2.85 × 10−5, and 1.66 × 10−4 S cm−1 with the Ea value down to 0.87 eV, respectively, which were 44, 42, and 30 times higher than those of Li+@TPB–DMTP–COF (Fig. 18f–h). Notably, the Li+@TPB–BMTP–COF can exhibit a lithium-ion conductivity of 5.49 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 90 °C. This significant increase in lithium-ion conductivity proved the key role of dense oligo (ethylene oxide) chains in promoting lithium-ion transport.

Following their previous work, Jiang and co-workers further explored the introduction of tetra(ethylene oxide) (TEO) polyelectrolyte units to the pore walls of TPB–DMTP–COF and TPB–BMTP–COF for modification by adding 2,5-bis(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)terephthalaldehyde (BPTA) as a second linker to the polycondensation systems of TPB and DMTP or TPB and BMTP (Fig. 19a–c).77 Through tuning the molar ratio of BPTA to DMTP or BMTP, the resulting COFs, named [TEO]x–TPB–DMTP–COF and [TEO]x–TPB–BMTP–COF, can possess different contents of TEO polyelectrolyte units on the pore walls. The X value was determined by X = [BPTA]/([BPTA] + [DMTP]) or [BPTA]/([BPTA] + [BMTP]) and was designated to be 0.33 and 0.5 (Fig. 19d–f). After loading LiClO4 to the pores of COFs by the solution diffusion method, the obtained Li+@[TEO]0.33–TPB–DMTP–COF can achieve lithium-ion conductivities of 7.77 × 10−6, 4.15 × 10−5, and 2.05 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 40, 60, and 80 °C with an Ea value of 0.78 eV, respectively. Along this line, the lithium-ion conductivities of Li+@[TEO]0.5–TPB–DMTP–COF under the same conditions were 1.31 × 10−5, 7.32 × 10−5, and 2.49 × 10−4 S cm−1 with an Ea value of 0.68 eV, respectively. As a comparison, the Li+@[TEO]0.33–TPB–BMTP–COF exhibited lithium-ion conductivities of 8.43 × 10−6, 5.35 × 10−5, and 2.69 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 40, 60, and 80 °C with an Ea value of 0.82 eV, respectively. In addition, the lithium-ion conductivities of Li+@[TEO]0.5–TPB–BMTP–COF under the same conditions were 5.51 × 10−6, 2.77 × 10−5, and 3.79 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. The above results indicated that TEO polyelectrolyte units on the pore walls of COFs can greatly promote the lithium-ion transport, but a further increase of the PEO content may result in the decrease of pore volume and low loading of ion species which may block the transport of lithium ions.

In 2019, Horike and co-workers introduced poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains of different lengths to the channels of 2D COFs and then obtained three new PEO-functionalized hydrazone-linked COFs (COF–PEO-3, COF–PEO-6, and COF–PEO-9) by the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with three PEO-based hydrazide monomers under solvothermal conditions (Fig. 20a).78 After immersing these three COFs in the THF solution of LiTFSI, the lithium salt was loaded into the pores of the COFs. The obtained COF–PEO-3–Li, COF–PEO-6–Li, and COF–PEO-9–Li achieved the lithium-ion conductivities of 9.72 × 10−5, 3.71 × 10−4, and 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 200 °C, respectively (Fig. 20b and c), which showed that COFs had thermal stability under ultra-high temperature conditions and can be used as solid-state electrolytes under extreme conditions. Electrochemical test results also showed that with the increase of the PEO chain length, the corresponding lithium-ion conductivity of the COFs also increased.

Similar to the design strategy mentioned above, Wang and co-workers proposed a new method of combining low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) with anionic COF (CD–COF), neutral COF (COF-5 and COF-300), and cationic COF (EB-COF–ClO4) to accelerate the transport of Li+ (Fig. 21a and b).79 In this way, polyethylene glycol was confined in well-arranged channels, maintaining high flexibility and Li+ solubility. All these four COFs were loaded with LiClO4 in acetonitrile and then mechanically pressed into pellets for electrochemical tests. The obtained PEG–Li+@CD–COF–Li, PEG–Li+@COF-300, PEG–Li+@COF-5, and PEG–Li+@EB-COF–ClO4 can exhibit ion conductivities of 2.60 × 10−5, 1.40 × 10−6, 3.60 × 10−8, and 1.93 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 1.30 × 10−4, 9.11 × 10−5, 3.49 × 10−5, and 1.78 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 120 °C, respectively (Fig. 21c). This result suggested that COFs with an ionic network exhibited higher ion conductivity than those with a neutral framework. In addition, the Ea values of 0.17, 0.20, 0.35, and 0.21 eV and the average Li+ transference number of 0.20, 0.44, 0.40, and 0.60 were determined for PEG–Li+@CD–COF–Li, PEG–Li+@COF-300, PEG–Li+@COF-5, and PEG–Li+@EB-COF–ClO4 (Fig. 21d). The low Li+ transference number of PEG–Li+@CD–COF–Li was mainly due to its anionic skeleton that can fix lithium ions.

3.2. Intrinsically lithium-ion conductive COFs
The second method to improve the conductivity of lithium ions is not to introduce external lithium salts but to directly fix the anionic functional groups on the skeleton of COFs, which can effectively prevent the migration of anions, and only allow COFs to combine with loose lithium ions to use separately conductivity caused by lithium-ion migration.
In 2016, Zhang and co-workers developed a series of novel spiroborate-linked ionic COFs (ICOFs) by the condensation reaction of a diol with trimethyl borate (Fig. 22a).80 In view of the unique porosity and ionicity of these ICOFs, the authors selected ICOF-2 combined with lithium ions on the skeleton as the Li-conducting solid-state electrolyte. Through mixed with PVDF in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and bladed onto aluminum foil, the ICOF-2: PVDF film can be obtained after the solvent is completely evaporated. Then the authors immersed the ICOF-2: PVDF film in propylene carbonate (PC) for 24 h, and the obtained ICOF-2: PVDF exhibited an ion conductivity of 3.05 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.24 eV (Fig. 22b and c). The average Li+ transference number value of ICOF-2 was 0.80 ± 0.02 which can suggest that ICOF-2 was quite close to ideal single-ion conduction.

Along the analogous thought, the same group reported a series of crystalline imidazolate-containing ICOFs (H–ImCOF, CH3–ImCOF, and CF3–ImCOF) as single-ion conductive COFs by the condensation reaction of a mixture of the imidazole-containing diamine with 1,3,5-triformlybenzene under the solvothermal conditions (Fig. 23a).81 Through lithiated with n-butyllithium, the obtained H–Li–ImCOF and CF3–Li–ImCOF exhibited lithium-ion conductivities of 5.3 × 10−3 and 7.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 while the CH3–Li–ImCOF only showed a lithium-ion conductivity of 8.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 23b). This result suggested that the electron-withdrawing substituents covalently connected to the imidazole group can weaken the ion transport while the electron-donating substituents can significantly increase the interaction between lithium ions and imidazole. In addition, the Ea values of 0.12, 0.10, and 0.27 eV and the average Li+ transference number of 0.88, 0.81, and 0.93 were determined for H–Li–ImCOF, CF3–Li–ImCOF, and CH3–Li–ImCOF (Fig. 23d–e), which can further confirm that this CF3–Li–ImCOF can become a high-efficiency single-ion-conducting solid-state electrolyte.

In 2019, Lee and co-workers also showed that the presence of freely mobile anions in the electrolytes caused unwanted interfacial side reactions between electrodes, resulting in the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites.82 Therefore, they designed and synthesized a lithium sulfonated COF (TpPa–SO3Li) as a single lithium-ion conductor by fixing the sulfonic acid group on the skeleton (Fig. 24a). Through the condensation reaction of Tp with 1,4-phenylenediamine-2-sulfonic acid (Pa–SO3H) under the solvothermal conditions, the authors firstly prepared a sulfonic acid COF (denoted as TpPa–SO3H). Then they reacted this TpPa–SO3H with LiOAc to exchange its protons with lithium ions, and the obtained TpPa–SO3Li exhibited an ionic conductivity of 2.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.18 eV and a Li+ transference number of 0.9 (Fig. 24b).

In addition, Zhang and co-workers also proposed a pre-synthetic strategy to synthesize a series of single-ion conductive COFs (Tp–PaSO3Li–COF, Tp–PaSO3Na–COF, and Tp–PaSO3K–COF) by fixing sulfonic acid groups on the skeleton of COFs.83 Among these COFs, Tp–PaSO3Li–COF showed a high lithium-ion conductivity of 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 293 K. The Ea value of 0.13 eV and the Li+ transference number of 0.94 were determined for Tp–PaSO3Li–COF.
4. Anion conductive COFs and their application for fuel cells
Anion conduction has broad application prospects in the direction of energy conversion and storage. In order to achieve high-efficiency anion transport, the role of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is very important.84,85 It can provide the flow of anions between the electrodes and determine the energy conversion efficiency of these electrochemical devices.86 In the past few decades, the polymer network has made great progress in the direction of anion conduction. The transport process of anions is affected by various factors such as side-chain distribution, polarity, anion concentration, process conditions, etc., which brings a large difficulty to precise control over the microenvironmental regulation.87 In contrast, the modular nature of COFs allows the lattice to be customized at the molecular level, and the side chains of the pores can also be re-designed and modified to give 1D pores a good physical and chemical environment.88 At the same time, the strong covalent connection of COFs can provide a stable framework to cope with harsh operating conditions. Based on the above advantages, COF membranes are expected to become a new generation of anion exchange membranes to achieve efficient anion transport.89
In 2020, Jiang and co-workers used quaternary ammonium (QA)-functionalized hydrazide and aldehyde building units to construct four kinds of crystalline frameworks that featured dense and ordered alignment of ionic side chains along the intrinsic channels, which made these COFs have low energy barrier paths toward anion transport (Fig. 24a).90 For the purpose of improving the processability of COFs, the authors proposed that a phase-transfer polymerization facilitated the assembly of COF membrane approach (abbreviated as phase-transfer polymerization) to prepare several self-standing COF–QA membranes (Fig. 24c). In these membranes, COF–QA-2 exhibited a hydroxide conductivity of 211.8 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, which was the highest among the reported anion exchange membranes (Fig. 24d and e). Furthermore, the authors explored the potential application in fuel cells using the COF–QA-2 membrane as the solid electrolyte membrane, and the fabricated membrane–electrode assembly acquired an open circuit voltage of 0.989 V and a peak power density of 163.7 mW cm−2, which was comparable to the single fuel cell performance of AEMs in previous reports.
One year later, in order to further achieve efficient anion conduction of COFs, the same group reported a series of QA-functionalized COFs (COF–QAs) using QA-functionalized hydrazides and six different aldehyde precursors as building blocks.91 This molecular precursor engineering made these fabricated COFs featuring permanently ordered channels and precise arrangement of QA groups for anion transport. In an organic–aqueous reaction system, through the appropriate selection of aldehyde precursors, the authors realized controllable fabrication of COF–QA membranes with desired morphological structures and elaborate manipulation of porous channels inside the frameworks. They found that smaller and higher electrophilic aldehydes facilitated the reaction–diffusion process and finally achieved the facile preparation of four kinds of COF–QA membranes. Among these aldehyde precursors, TFB was preferred to fabricate tighter COF membranes with optimized channel structures through a phase-transfer polymerization process, which exhibited ever-reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200 mS cm−1 at 80 °C under 100% RH among previously reported anion conductors.
Recently, Jiang and co-workers used TAPB as knot and BPTA and DMTP at different molar ratios (X = 100 × [BPTA]/([BPTA] + [DMTP]) = 50 and 100) as the linker to synthesize [HCC]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs with ethynyl side units on the pore walls.92 Upon a quantitative azide–ethynyl click reaction, [HCC]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs were transformed into [PF6−]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs in which the pore walls were engineered by cationic chains with imidazolium termini and PF6− counteranions. Then they conducted anion exchange of [PF6−]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs using an aqueous NaOH solution as the eluent which replaced PF6− with OH− to yield [OH−]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs. As the pore wall enabled the integration of cationic chains to self-assemble OH− anions while the dense π–π stack allowed for the organization of OH− anions into six single-file chains in each channel, these obtained [OH−]x–TPB–BPTA–COFs both had a tailor-made anionic interface to enable and promote OH− anion conduction. Among them, [OH−]100–TPB–BPTA–COFs exhibited the OH− anion conduction of 1.53 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 80 °C with an Ea value of 0.20 eV measured in ultrapure water and 5.34 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 80 °C with the Ea value of 0.11 eV measured in water vapor.
5. Conclusions and future prospects
Herein, we summarize the research progress in proton, lithium-ion, and anion conduction of COFs in recent years. COFs have well-defined crystalline structures, excellent chemical stability, large specific surface area, and designable pore environment which make COFs have great advantages in the field of ion conduction. Recently, a large amount of article has focused on this field and achieved high ionic conductivity. However, there are still some challenges in the application of COFs for ion conduction.
First of all, the number and connection methods of ion-conducting COFs reported so far are still relatively limited, and there are relatively few studies on the relationship between the structure and ionic conductivity of COFs. Secondly, although some COFs have achieved high ionic conductivity, they have not been applied to operation under actual conditions due to their poor membrane formation, such as being used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells and as solid-state electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, which makes its practical application potential cannot be judged. Thirdly, the single crystal structure of most COFs is still unclear that causes great challenges in exploring its conduction mechanism.
In the future, in order to make COFs have further development in the field of ion conduction, on the one hand, researchers should continue to expand the introduction of functional groups and explore more mild preparation conditions to create COFs which both have excellent film-forming properties and high electrical conductivity. On the other hand, researchers should attempt to obtain the single crystal samples of COFs and study the single crystal structure of COFs which can explain the conduction mechanism of COFs from the structural point of view. In addition, the ultimate goal of applying COFs to ion conduction is to realize their practical applications in fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries and other systems. Therefore, the relevant application research of COFs must be strengthened in future explorations, rather than just testing their theoretical conductivity.
In summary, the excellent pore properties of COFs provide excellent transport paths for ion conduction. According to the different ions transmitted in the channel, we systematically classified and summarized the diversity and importance of COFs in ion conduction. We believe that with the rapid development of synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and chemical engineering, this research field will rapidly develop into practical applications in the near future. We hope that this work will provide guidance for the design and synthesis of functional COFs to develop advanced conductive properties and stimulate innovation in this emerging field.
