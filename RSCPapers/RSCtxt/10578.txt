    , Accepted 7th June 2018First published on 7th June 2018AbstractAlthough graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) has been widely studied for its photocatalytic applications in environmental remediation and solar energy conversion, the electronic structure of CN has not been optimized in terms of reactant activation and ROS generation. In this work, C self-doped g-C3N4 (CN-C) was prepared by co-pyrolysis of urea and saccharose and showed highly enhanced photocatalytic NO removal efficiency in comparison with the pristine CN. Theoretical and experimental methods were highly combined to illustrate the geometric structures of CN-C and reveal the promotion mechanisms in terms of enhanced optical and electron transfer properties. The unique electronic structure of CN-C allows NO and O2 to be more easily activated for the production of reactive radicals to participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction. The enhanced production of reactive radicals and the boosted separation rate of photogenerated carriers could promote the photocatalysis efficiency, leading to efficient and stable photocatalytic oxidation of NO over C self-doped g-C3N4. Importantly, the conversion pathways of photocatalytic NO oxidation over CN and CN-C have been elucidated based on the results of DFT calculations, ESR spectra and in situ DRIFTS spectra. A new absorption band at 2175 cm−1 associated with the NO+ intermediate is discovered for CN-C. The present work could offer new insights into the understanding of the electronic structure and photocatalytic NO oxidation mechanism on typical photocatalysts.
Introduction
Photocatalysis has gained considerable attention due to its promising applications in environmental remediation and energy conversion.1–8 Subsequently, significant advances about the development of highly efficient photocatalysis have been made, including splitting of water to yield hydrogen fuel, photo-decomposition of hazardous substances, artificial photosynthesis and photoelectro-chemical conversion.9–12 Generally, three main steps are included in a semiconductor photocatalytic cycle: (1) light stimulates the photocatalysis to generate electron–hole pairs; (2) the separation and transportation of photogenerated electrons and holes induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); (3) the photocatalytic redox reaction occurs via the ROS. Hence, to improve photocatalytic performance, we can focus on the functionalization of photocatalysts by broadening the visible-light absorption range, boosting the separation of charge carriers, and elevating the redox ability.
Recently, g-C3N4 (CN), as a low-cost and metal-free layered conjugated photocatalyst, has been widely applied in water splitting, organic pollutant degradation, organic catalysis and electrocatalysis under visible light irradiation due to its appealing electronic band structure, physicochemical stability and steerable molecular skeleton structure.13–22 Unfortunately, limited by the chemically sluggish properties originating from the intrinsic graphitic sp2-hybridized array of tri-s-triazine repeating units and weak covalence between layers,13 photo-generated carriers would transfer randomly, triggering low charge separation efficiency and thus unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance. Therefore, various approaches to optimize the photocatalytic performance of CN are highly desirable.
In addition to construction of g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts to increase the photocatalysis efficiency,23,24 doping additional elements and impurities into CN can distinctly tune the optical, electronic structure, and physical properties of CN, including incorporation of molecules with heteroatoms,25 carbon materials,26,27 and metal or nonmetal elements.28,29 In a recent report, the photocatalytic NO removal efficiency of CN can be enhanced via interlayer element doping to craft interlayer oriented electron transportation channels for high separation rates of photo-generated carriers.30 Also, element doping like S and B could boost the photocatalytic activity by promoting light absorption, enlarging surface areas and adjusting the electronic structure.2,31 Nevertheless, foreign element doping may also have some detrimental drawbacks. Apart from the poor oxidation power of photo-excited holes, possible defects can be introduced due to the doping asymmetry leading to fast recombination of photo-generated electron/hole pairs.32–35
It has been reported that self-doping could not only modify the surface architectures and electronic properties of photocatalysts, but also avoid the introduction of foreign impurity that may act as recombination centers.36–40 Some research works on C self-doped g-C3N4 (CN-C) have been developed, which could enhance the absorption capacity of visible light and the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons/holes, and thus improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. For instance, CN-C has been designed to greatly enhance the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production.41–43 Nevertheless, most of the reported works have focused on the optimization of photocatalytic performance, and the effects of C-self doping on the reactant activation and the conversion pathway of photocatalytic reaction have not been revealed.
Herein, we developed a simple thermal polymerization method to prepare C self-doped g-C3N4 using urea and saccharose as precursors. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited substantially high visible-light photocatalytic NO removal efficiency. We combined the theoretical and experimental methods to illustrate the promotion mechanisms in terms of enhanced photoelectric properties and photocatalytic efficiency. According to DFT calculations and ESR spectra, O2 molecules tend to be adsorbed on the surface of CN-C and then be activated easily, which is beneficial to receive more electrons for the production of ˙O2− radicals to participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction. Besides, the enhanced adsorption and activation of NO have been demonstrated by DFT calculations and in situ DRIFTS technology, which promote the formation of an important reaction intermediate—nitrosyl species NO+ to accelerate the conversion of NO to final products. In addition, the photocatalytic NO conversion pathway on CN-C is unravelled. Our work advances the understanding in a new perspective and could provide new insights into the photocatalysis reaction mechanism.
Experimental section
Catalyst preparation
All chemical reagents employed in this study were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. 10 g of urea and saccharose with different masses (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 10.0 g) were added into four different alumina crucibles (50 mL), respectively. Then 20 mL deionized water was put into the alumina crucibles. The obtained solution was dried at 60 °C to get the solid precursors. The solid precursors were placed into a semi-closed alumina crucible with a cover and heated at 550 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. After thermal treatment, the alumina crucibles were cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained samples with different masses (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 10.0 g) were collected and labelled CN-C1, CN-C2, CN-C3 and CN-C10, respectively. Pure CN was also prepared by direct calcination of 10 g urea under the same thermal treatment conditions.
Characterization
The crystal phases of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (Model D/max RA Rigaku Co., Japan). The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of the samples was detected by elemental analysis (EA, Vario ELIII CHASO). The morphology and structure of the prepared photocatalysts were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL model JSM-6490, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, Japan). Nitrogen adsorption apparatus (ASAP 2010, USA) was used to detect the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of the obtained products with all samples degassed at 300 °C for 2 h prior to measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Al Kα X-ray radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at 150 W (Thermo ESCA-LAB 250, USA) was used to investigate the surface chemical compositions and states. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of radicals spin-trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were recorded on a JES FA200 spectrometer. Samples for measurement were prepared by mixing the samples in 50 mM DMPO solution tanks (aqueous dispersion for DMPO–˙OH and methanol dispersion for DMPO–˙O2−) and irradiated with visible light. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out on a Bruker ESP 500 spectrometer. Steady and time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, ELSP-920). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (F-7000, HITACHI, Japan) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained for the dry-pressed disk samples using a scanning UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis DRS, UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly to investigate the optical properties of the samples.
Density functional theory calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP5.3.5),44 applying a generalized gradient correlation functional.45 A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV was employed within the framework of the projector-augmented wave method.46,47 The Gaussian smearing width was set to 0.2 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst Pack grid. All atoms were converged to 0.01 eV Å−1. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) was carried out to verify the thermal stability of doped configurations, using the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.48,49 A 2 × 3 × 3 supercell of bulk CN was first relaxed; then carbon replaced three different nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1e–g).

In situ DRIFTS investigation

In situ DRIFTS measurements were conducted using a TENSON II FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with an in situ diffuse reflectance cell (Harrick) and a high-temperature reaction chamber (HVC), as shown in Scheme S1.† The reaction chamber was equipped with three gas ports and two coolant ports. High-purity He, high-purity O2, and a 100 ppb NO mixture could be fed into the reaction chamber, and a three-way ball valve was used to switch between the target gas (NO) and the purge gas (He). The total gas flow rate was 100 mL min−1, and the concentration was adjusted to 500 ppb by dilution with O2. The chamber was enclosed with a dome having three windows, two for IR light entrance and detection, and one for illuminating the photocatalyst. The observation window was made of UV quartz and the other two windows were made of ZnSe. A Xe lamp (MVL-210, Japan) was used as the irradiation light source. Before measurements, the prepared samples were pretreated for 2 h at 300 °C.
Results and discussion
Chemical composition and microstructure
To reflect the crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples, XRD was performed. As shown in Fig. 1a and S1,† two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1° (corresponding to the (100) plane) and 27.4° (corresponding to the (002) plane), which are derived from the in-plane repeated units and the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems of CN, respectively.50 This result demonstrates that C self-doping does not change the basic atomic structure of CN. Nevertheless, a slight left shift of the (100) peak over CN-C2 has been observed in comparison with pure CN, which can be ascribed to the fact that carbon with a larger atomic radius than nitrogen could influence the intralayer structure via substituted doping.
The compositions of CN and CN-C were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S1†) reveals that CN and CN-C only contain C, N and O species without other impurities. As shown in Fig. 1b, the high-resolution XPS peaks of C 1s of the two samples can be fitted into two peaks with binding energies of 288.3 and 284.8 eV, which can be ascribed to the N–CN coordination and C–C bonds, respectively.51,52 Obviously, the intensity of the C–C bond peak is significantly enhanced in the CN-C2 sample, indicating that carbon is doped into the CN. As shown in Fig. 1c, the high-resolution XPS peaks of N 1s of the two samples could be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 398.9 eV, 400.4 eV and 401.4 eV, which can be attributed to the C–NC, N–C3 and C–N–H groups, respectively. The intensities of the peaks of CN-C2 at 400.4 eV and 401.4 eV decreased significantly in comparison with those of the pure CN, indicating that the nitrogen atoms were partially replaced by doped carbon atoms. In addition, elemental analysis was used to detect the composition of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Table 1, the C/N ratio of CN-C samples was higher than that of CN, further reflecting the successful doping of carbon in the CN-C samples.

In order to unravel the geometric structures of CN-C, we employ DFT calculations to certify the possible doping sites. According to previous research reports, carbon was more likely to be doped into in-plane CN.42,43 We established three possible crystal structures, that is, carbon replaces nitrogen at three different positions (Fig. 1e–g). According to the calculated results, the nitrogen atom which is used to connect the three heptazine heterocyclic rings of CN would be substituted easily by carbon since the E0 of the crystal structure (Fig. 1e) is significantly lower than those of the other two structures (Fig. 1f and g). Therefore, the geometric structures of CN-C are changed obviously, which is in line with the results of XRD, XPS and elemental analysis.
SEM and TEM were employed to confirm the morphologies and microstructures of the CN and CN-C2 samples. The pure CN sample exhibits the aggregated morphologies of a typical stacked layered structure (Fig. 2a and b). There is no obvious difference in the morphology of CN-C2 compared with the pure CN (Fig. 2c and d). As shown in Fig. 2e and f, CN-C2 with a layered structure can be observed, which is similar to the pristine CN. In addition, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the BJH pore-size distribution curves (Fig. S3†) demonstrate the porous architecture of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Table S1,† the BET surface areas (SBET) of CN, CN-C1, CN-C2, and CN-C3 samples are measured to be 81, 89, 118, and 118 m2 g−1, respectively. The increased SBET of the CN-C samples indicates that co-pyrolysis of urea and saccharose could increase the surface area and thus provide more active sites to promote the transfer of reactants and thus optimize the photocatalytic performance.

Photocatalytic activity and reactive radical generation
The photocatalytic performance of the CN and CN-C samples was evaluated by the removal rate of NO under visible-light irradiation. Previous studies have confirmed that NO cannot be photo-oxidated under visible irradiation without photocatalysts,53 but it can be oxidized into NO3− or NO2− in the presence of photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation.54 It can be seen from Fig. 3a and S4a† that the NO removal ratio of pure CN can reach 33.23% after 30 min irradiation. Compared with pristine CN, the photocatalytic performances increased to 50.89%, 56.77%, 53.00%, and 38.73% for CN-C1, CN-C2, CN-C3, and CN-C10, respectively (Fig. S4a†). Notably, CN-C2 exhibits the highest NO removal ratio (56.77%), indicating that the C self-doping content has a certain influence on the photocatalytic activities and C self-doping can be an efficient approach to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of CN. In addition, the stability of CN-C2 was evaluated by five continuous recycling tests (Fig. 3b). After the consecutive tests, the photocatalytic performance of CN-C2 shows little deactivation, indicating that the prepared C self-doped CN can be used as a highly efficient and stable photocatalyst for NO removal.

To further elaborate the promotion mechanism of the photocatalytic NO removal, we investigated the reactive species that participated in the NO degradation reaction with DMPO spin-trapping ESR. As shown in Fig. 4a, much stronger signals of DMPO–˙O2− have been detected for CN-C2 than those of CN, demonstrating that C self-doping could enhance the generation of active species (molecular oxygen is activated by electrons to produce ˙O2−) due to the strong electron excitability and better charge transfer peculiarity.

Blue, gray, and red spheres represent C, N, and O atoms, respectively. 
Moreover, we investigated the generation mechanism of ˙O2− by DFT calculations. Fig. 4c and d represent the charge density difference distribution of O2 adsorption on CN and CN-C, respectively. By utilizing the Bader method,55 we can calculate the total charge (Δq) of O2. Notably, compared with the pure CN, the Δq of O2 increases from 0.14 eV for CN to 0.17 eV for CN-C2. This fact implies that C self-doping could promote the activation of O2 and facilitate the production of abundant electrons to activate O2 molecules, thus forming more ˙O2− to participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction, which is consistent with the DMPO˙O2− results (Fig. 4a). Besides, the total charge (Δq) of NO decreases from 0.04 eV (CN) to 0.10 eV (CN-C2), indicating that the carbon doping in CN could induce easy adsorption of the NO on the surface of CN and thus lose more electrons to become activated. In addition, the signals of DMPO–˙OH were also detected (Fig. 4b). Since OH−/H2O cannot be directly oxidized into hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), the observed ˙OH radicals can be obtained by the following route: ˙O2− → H2O2 → ˙OH, which also reflects the increased electron excitation and better charge transfer characteristics of CN-C2.
Charge separation
The separation and recombination rates of photo-generated electron/hole pairs have a great influence on the production of reactive species that play a significant role in photocatalytic performance. Hence we further explore the separation and transportation efficiency of carriers. The electronic characteristics of CN and CN-C2 were detected by room temperature solid state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). As displayed in Fig. 5a, a single EPR signal centered at a value of 2.0 is observed, which can be assigned to unpaired lone electrons of π-conjugated CN aromatic rings.56–58 Importantly, regardless of light or dark conditions, the intensity of CN-C2 far exceeds that of the pristine CN, implying that the substitution of N with C could boost the electron mobility, accelerate the charge transportation, and thus contribute to the improved photocatalytic performance of CN-C2. PL spectra (Fig. 5b) are detected to further understand the recombination process of charge carriers. With the increase of the carbon-doping content, the PL peak intensity was significantly reduced (Fig. S4b†), suggesting that carbon substitution is beneficial to suppress the recombination of photo-generated electrons–holes. The above conclusion is consistent with the results obtained in Fig. 4. Therefore, the rapid migration of electrons and the decreased recombination rate of photo-generated carriers can provide abundant electrons to activate the O2 molecules and thus dramatically facilitate the production of reactive species to participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction. The charge difference distribution (Fig. 5c and d) displayed that the electronic gain or loss can be observed. It can be found that the randomly distributed electrons around the central nitrogen of CN (Fig. 5c) are localized around the central carbon of the modified nitrified carbon (Fig. 5d) and form a local region with high electron density, which increases the adsorption and activation of oxygen and nitric oxide. Because N is more electronegative than C, the surrounding atoms are more likely to lose electrons when C replaces N. To illustrate the effect of electron localization more intuitively, the carried charges (Δq) of atoms around the central C atom are calculated with the Bader method (Fig. 5e and f).55 Apparently, the C atoms around the central C atom of the CN-C model possess more electrons in contrast to the pristine CN model, which further confirms that the substitution of carbon atoms enables the localization of the electrons around, the N atoms around the doped C become electron-deficient, which is favourable for NO activation via accepting electrons from NO (Fig. 4f).

Light absorption and band structure
The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples are investigated by a combined experimental and theoretical method. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the CN-C2 sample exhibits a red shift of the light absorption band edge in contrast to the pristine CN, which is consistent with the calculated results (Fig. 6b). This result implies that the light absorption capacity of CN-C2 is stronger than that of the pure CN. Moreover, the intensity of light absorption increases with the increase of the C content (Fig. S4c†). Evidently, CN-C10 exhibits the strongest visible-light absorption. The band gap of the as-prepared samples (Eg) is estimated from the intercept of the tangents to the plots of (αhν)1/2νs. photon energy (Fig. 6c and S4d†), and the values are 2.71 eV for CN and 2.65 eV for CN-C2, respectively. These facts implied that the CN-C samples are endowed with enhanced visible-light absorption and narrowed band gaps when compared with CN. Meanwhile, the density of states (DOS) are calculated (Fig. 6d) and the band gap of CN-C is lower than that of the pristine CN. Note that the calculated values of CN and CN-C are smaller than the experimental results (Fig. 6c), which can be ascribed to the well-known limitation of the plain DFT method.

In situ DRIFTS investigation and photocatalytic reaction mechanism
To reveal the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation on CN and CN-C2, in situ DRIFTS was employed to monitor the reaction intermediates and final products on the surface of the as-prepared photocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 7. The background spectra are recorded before injecting NO into the reaction chamber. The NO adsorption bands appear under dark conditions when NO is in contact with the photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 7a and S5a,† the adsorption bands of N2O (2136 cm−1) and NO−/NOH (1133, 1148 and 1163 cm−1) can be observed.3,8,59 Additionally, the other adsorption bands centered at 888, 1009 and 1081 cm−1 (Fig. S5a†) can be assigned to NO2−, nitrates and bidentate nitrates or monodentate nitrites, respectively.1,2,4,6,60 With the progress of adsorption, the intensity of adsorption bands located at 888 and 1081 cm−1 (Fig. 7a) is increased progressively, indicating the gradual accumulation of nitrite and nitrate compounds and the chemical adsorption of NO on the surface of CN. The formation of nitrates and nitrites is ascribed to the active two-coordinated N atoms, which promote the formation of the activated oxygen species that could boost the oxidation ability of surface oxygen species for NO oxidation.61,62 After the adsorption equilibrium is reached, the time-dependent IR spectra of CN under visible light irradiation are recorded dynamically. As shown in Fig. 7c, the adsorption band centered at 2136 cm−1 disappears, and the intensity of adsorption bands at 883 and 1081 cm−1 becomes more obvious, which indicates that more NO can be converted to nitrites and nitrates. Besides, a new adsorption band located at 864 cm−1 (Fig. S5c†) is detected, which can be attributed to the final products of photocatalytic NO oxidation (chelated nitrite).7 Tables S2–S5† summarizes the assignment of adsorption bands for CN and CN-C2 samples.

In situ IR spectra of NO adsorption and visible light reaction processes over CN and CN-C2. 
Compared with CN (Fig. S5b†), new absorption bands of CN-C2 are detected at 910 cm−1, 1025 cm−1, 2095 cm−1 (N2O4, NO, NO2), indicating that more intermediate products are generated. Meanwhile, the adsorption bands at 985 cm−1 (chelating bidentate NO3− species), 1106 cm−1 (nitrites), and 1122 cm−1 (bidentate NO2−) are stronger, indicating that more final products are formed (3NO + OH− → NO2 + NO− + NOH, NO2 + ˙OH → NO3− + H+).63–65 In the range of 1260–860 cm−1, although the tendency of adsorption bands is similar to that of CN (Table S4†), one notable difference is that an obvious band associated with NO+ appeared at 2175 cm−1 (Fig. 7d) under visible light irradiation.2,8,60,66,67 Hadjiivanov et al. found that when NO was adsorbed onto surfaces possessing strong oxidative ability, an important reaction intermediate of NO oxidation—NO+ was usually observed.65 The adsorbed NO+ tends to be preferentially oxidized into nitro compounds by reactive oxygen species in comparison with other nitrogen-containing species (NO + ˙OH → OH− + NO+, NO+ + 2˙OH + 2OH− → NO3− + 2H2O).68,69 Furthermore, the intensity of the adsorption bands at 866 and 1001 cm−1 (Fig. 7d) is increased progressively but the adsorption bands of N2O disappeared, which indicates that NO on the surface of CN-C2 is gradually transformed into the final products. The final products can be removed easily by water washing and the photocatalyst can be regenerated via this facile method.
Hence, through the above detailed analysis of in situ IR spectra, an important reaction intermediate of NO oxidation (NO+) is detected and the conversion pathway of photocatalytic NO oxidation could be further revealed.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that C self-doping is a novel and efficient strategy to optimize the electronic structure and enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 by combining theoretical with experimental methods. The C self-doping with localized electrons could activate the reactants, accelerate the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and promote the generation of reactive radicals for NO oxidation. Time-dependent in situ IR spectroscopy, ESR and DFT calculations revealed the conversion pathway of photocatalytic NO oxidation. During the oxidation of NO on g-C3N4, NO is oxidized into NO2 by superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, and then oxidized into nitric acid. The electron-deficient area of CN-C can promote NO to obtain an electron and generate an intermediate NO+. The formation of an intermediate product makes NO more easily oxidized into the final product. The present work could provide new insights into the understanding of the electronic structure and photocatalysis mechanism on typical photocatalysts.
