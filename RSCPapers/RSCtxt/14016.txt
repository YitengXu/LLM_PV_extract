    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 20th April 2017AbstractTwo-photon excitation (TPE) photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great interest due to its distinctive properties, e.g., good penetration ability of biological tissues and less damage to healthy tissues. However, the conventional photosensitizers (PSs) for PDT have poor subcellular location capability and low two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section in the phototherapeutic window. Herein, we report a fascinating multi-functional TPE PS, polythiophene nanoparticles (PT NPs), for simultaneous lysosome-targetable fluorescence imaging and PDT. PT NPs show bright yellow fluorescence, good water solubility as well as excellent photo- and pH-stability. Moreover, PT NPs exhibit high singlet oxygen generation quantum yield (∼42%) and large TPA cross section (∼3420 GM). A fluorescence imaging penetration depth of 1800 μm could be reached in the tissue phantom under the TPE mode. Due to these outstanding merits and their unique clathrin- and caveola-independent intracellular uptake pathway, PT NPs have great potential for application in TPE fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.
1. Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an extraordinary theranostic technology for cancer treatment due to its high destruction of tumors, low systemic toxicity and side effects, low drug dose requirement, negligible drug resistance, non-invasive nature, and combinability with other therapeutic assays.1–5 In PDT, cancer cells are locally killed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH˙) upon exposure to a photosensitizer (PS) under precisely controlled light irradiation. Meanwhile, the fluorescence emitted from the PS can be employed for locating tissue and photodiagnosis.6,7 However, the absorption spectra of currently approved PDT PSs are mainly located in the visible region (below 700 nm), which is a major drawback as conventional one-photon excited (OPE) PDT cannot penetrate deep tissue, and thus these PSs are mostly utilized for superficial tumor identification and therapy.8,9
Two-photon excitation (TPE) PDT with near-infrared (NIR) photons as the excitation source has been recognized as an alternative promising approach for cancer treatment. This approach not only inherits the advantages of OPE PDT as mentioned above, but also offers other distinctive merits. First, the TPE PDT can penetrate deeply into biological tissues. The NIR excitation wavelength used in TPE is coincident with the biological transparency window in the range from 700 to 1000 nm, resulting in a much deeper light penetration depth than that of visible light.10 Second, due to the quadratic dependence of two-photon absorption (TPA) on laser intensity, the sample region outside the laser beam focus cannot be excited, which can prevent injuries to adjacent healthy tissue. Third, the nonlinear excitation mode is also helpful to improve the spatial resolution of imaging and to reduce the possibility of photobleaching.11–13
It is well established that the intrinsic properties of PSs are vital to the efficiency of cancer therapy. To develop ideal PSs for TPE PDT, some important criteria should be considered: (1) large TPA cross section in the therapeutic window, (2) high 1O2 generation efficiency, (3) nontoxicity in the dark, (4) excellent photostability and water solubility, and (5) low cost and ease of synthesis.14 In addition, due to the high reactivity and short lifetime of 1O2 (∼3.5 μs) and limited diffusion distance (∼2 μm) inside the cell,15–18 the cytotoxic response is limited to the irradiated area at the intracellular level. Thus, the therapeutic outcome of PDT is strongly dependent on where the ROS interacts and which subcellular organelles it targets, such as endosomes, the plasma-membrane, lysosomes, mitochondria, the nucleus, etc.19–21 However, most of the clinically used PSs generally show poor subcellular localization capability and low TPA cross sections (<100 GM, 1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s photon−1), and thus their TPE PDT efficiencies are generally low.22 To overcome this drawback, two strategies have been developed to make TPE PDT more widely applicable: (1) TPA cross section of PSs could be enhanced by expanding their π-conjugated structure through chemical modification.23–25 Alternatively, integrating PSs with organic or inorganic light harvesting units can improve the performance of PSs in TPE PDT based on the energy transfer mechanism.26–29 In addition, gold nanostructures (e.g., nanoparticles and nanorods)30,31 and metal complexes (e.g., Ru, Ir and Pt complexes) also have good capabilities for the generation of 1O2 under the TPE mode.32–35 Unfortunately, the clinical translation of these agents has been impeded in consideration of the cytotoxicity of the ligand or unbiodegradable heavy metals. It is of great interest to develop novel effective TPE PSs for simultaneous imaging and PDT.
Water soluble conjugated polymers have been known to exhibit strong light harvesting abilities, excellent photostability, high fluorescence quantum yield and readily modifiable properties. These properties have been widely employed to develop novel biosensors and bioimaging agents.36–38 Moreover, they have also been found to display large TPA cross sections and have been utilized as TPE energy donors to indirectly excite PSs by energy transfer processes.39–43 However, only a few conjugated polymers have been reported that can directly generate 1O2 under TPE.44 Herein, we present the synthesis, characterization and in-depth biological investigation of positively charged polythiophene nanoparticles (PT NPs, Fig. 1a) as the lysosome-targetable TPE PDT agent. The cellular uptake mechanism of the NPs was also systematically investigated. This study demonstrates that the PT NPs have a large TPA cross section, high 1O2 generation quantum yield, appropriate fluorescence quantum yield and lysosome-targeting ability, which enable them to serve as good TPE phototheranostics for simultaneous imaging and therapy.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of PT NPs
PT NPs were obtained by a self-assembly method.45,46 In detail, 10 mg of PT powder was dissolved in 20 mL of CH3CN–H2O (v/v = 1/9) solvent mixture. The solution was ultrasonicated for 10 min, and after that, CH3CN in the solution was removed by bubbling nitrogen. Finally, a dispersion of NPs was achieved.
2.2. OPE and TPE optical property measurements
The absorption and OPE fluorescence spectra of PT NP aqueous solution were recorded with HITACHI U3010 and HITACHI F4600 spectrometers, respectively. The fluorescence quantum yield of PT NPs was measured using a spectrometer attached to an integrating sphere. The TPE fluorescence spectra of PT NPs were measured with a fiber spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB2000 CCD). A Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser (Spitfire, Spectra-Physics, 100 fs, 80 MHz) was used as the TPE laser source. The wavelength of the output laser beam was tuned from 740 to 880 nm. The TPA cross section of PT NPs in water was determined using the TPE fluorescence method. With fluorescein in water (pH = 11) as the reference, the TPA cross section of PT NPs was calculated per polymer molecule using the following equation:  where the subscripts R and S stand for the reference and PT NPs, respectively; σ is the TPA cross section; F is the integral area of the TPE fluorescence; ϕ is the OPE fluorescence quantum yield; η is the overall fluorescence collection efficiency of the experimental apparatus, and C is the concentration. The concentrations of the fluorescein and PT NPs are 1 μM and 10 μg mL−1 (∼0.06 M), respectively.
2.3. 
          1O2 luminescence and quantum yield measurements
The 1O2 emission signal was detected using a HITACHI F900 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 532 nm excitation laser and a NIR detector. The 1O2 generation quantum yield was measured by a chemical trapping method using disodium 9,10-anthracendipropionic acid (Na2-ADPA) as the trapping agent and Rose Bengal (RB) as the standard photosensitizer. Xeon light (PLS SXE300C) was employed as the irradiation source, and two filters, UVCUT400 and VISREF (320–780), were used to adjust the emission wavelength from 400 nm to 780 nm. The absorbance of Na2-ADPA at 378 nm was recorded at different irradiation times to get the decay rate of the photosensitizing process. The 1O2 quantum yield of PT NPs was calculated using the following formula:  where KNPs and KRB are the decomposition rate constants of Na2-ADPA by PT NPs and RB, respectively. ANPs and ARB represent light absorbed by PT NPs and RB, respectively. They were calculated by integrating the area of the absorption spectra of PT NPs and RB. ϕNPs and ϕRB are the 1O2 generation quantum yields of PT NPs and RB, respectively. The standard ϕRB is 75% in water.
2.4. Cellular uptake pathways
The effect of temperature on cellular uptake was investigated by pre-incubating HeLa cells in a serum-free medium at 4 °C for 1 h and incubated with PT NPs for another 4 h. Amiloride, chlorpromazine and cytisine were applied to inhibit micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveola-mediated endocytosis, respectively. The effect of inhibitors on the intracellular uptake was studied by pre-treating them with chlorpromazine (10 μg mL−1), cytisine (1 μg mL−1), or amiloride (50 μM) at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, these inhibitors were removed, PT NPs (50 μg mL−1) in cell culture media containing inhibitors were added and further incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells only incubated with PT NPs were used as the control group. These cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with paraformaldehyde. The cell nucleus was stained with Hoechst and visualized under a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 100× objective lens. Numerical aperture of the objective: 100×/1.4 Oil (DIC N2), OFN 25, Plan Apo VC, Nikon Company. Immersion oil, type: NF, nd = 1.515 (23 °C). Microscope: Ti Microscope, Light path: L100, Condenser: 3 (DIC N2), Zoom: 1.00, Nikon Company.
2.5. Colocalization of PT NPs and the lysosome tracker
HeLa cells were incubated with PT NPs (50 μg mL−1) at 37 °C for 4 h and then co-incubated with LysoTracker Deep Red (100 nM) at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times and visualized using a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope.
2.6. OPE and TPE PDT in vitro
Xeon light (400–780 nm) and an 800 nm femtosecond pulse laser from a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire, Spectra-Physics, 1 kHz, <130 fs) were used as the OPE and TPE PDT light sources, respectively. The standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium hydrobromide) assay was carried out to quantitatively evaluate the cytotoxicity and PDT efficiency of PT NPs. The cell culture medium was replaced by PT NP solution with different concentrations of fresh cell culture medium. The incubated cells were subjected to irradiation with Xeon light for 10 min. Then, the cell medium was refreshed after incubation for 24 h, and the cells were further incubated with MTT solution. Finally, the culture medium was discarded and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added; the absorbance of the DMSO solution at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader to calculate the cell viability.
In order to in situ monitor the TPE PDT capability, the cells cultured with or without PT NPs were continuously irradiated with an 800 nm laser which was used for the laser scanning confocal microscopy. The bright field cell images were acquired every minute.
2.7. TPE deep tissue fluorescence imaging
Intralipid was used as the mock tissue in consideration of its similar turbidity and scattering properties to the real tissue. The fluorescence signals of PT NPs at different depths in mock tissues were detected using a two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope equipped with a 10× objective lens. To create a gap with adjustable height, double-sided adhesive layers were intercalated between both ends of the two coverslips. Then a stock of 1% intralipid solution was filled into the gap of two coverslips to simulate biological tissues with different thicknesses.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of PT NPs

Fig. 1a shows the molecular structure of PT. Quaternary ammonium was introduced in view of its water solubility and positively charged nature. The detailed synthesis and characterization of PT were described in our previous work.37 PT NPs were obtained using a self-assembly method as depicted in Fig. 1b. The morphology of the NPs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which suggests that the PT NPs are spherical in shape with a mean diameter of ∼50 nm (Fig. 1c). Two broad size distribution peaks at ∼80 nm and ∼300 nm were observed in the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The former peak can be attributed to the well dispersed NPs, and the latter peak might originate from the aggregation of NPs. The DLS result shows a slightly higher mean size for the NPs as compared to that observed by TEM, which is due to the drying process during the TEM sample preparation.47 The zeta-potential of PT NPs was determined to be +51.9 mV, indicating a mass of positive charges on their surface.
3.2. The OPE and TPE optical properties of PT NPs
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PT NPs in Fig. 2a displays a characteristic absorption band of polythiophene and the absorption maximum is located at 440 nm. PT NPs aqueous solution emits yellow fluorescence under 365 nm irradiation (right inset, Fig. 2a) with a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (ϕ = 8%). The fluorescence spectrum ranges from 500 to 700 nm with a peak at 560 nm (Fig. 2b, blue line). It is noteworthy that the NPs exhibit a large Stokes shift of 120 nm. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the NPs exhibits a broad band centred at 443 nm (Fig. 2b, black line). To examine the photostability, PT NPs and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) aqueous solutions were exposed to continuous irradiation of Xeon light (500 W, 400–780 nm). As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), PT NPs retain their 90% absorbance after exposure to the irradiation of Xeon light for 60 min, which indicates that the NPs have excellent photostability. Moreover, the fluorescence of PT NPs is also independent on the changes of pH values ranging from 3 to 11 (Fig. S2b, ESI†). In addition, PT NPs almost can maintain their fluorescence in different media (DI water, PBS, saline and FBS) during the one week observation period (Fig. S2c, ESI†). These excellent optical properties make PT NPs promising candidate for bioimaging applications.

The inset: quadratic relationship between the integration area of the fluorescence spectrum and the excitation laser power. (d) Excitation wavelength dependent TPA cross sections. 
The TPE properties of the PT NPs were investigated by using a femtosecond pulse laser with the output wavelengths from 740 to 880 nm. As shown in Fig. 2b (red line), a strong fluorescence band centred at 566 nm was acquired under the excitation of an 800 nm laser. The TPE fluorescence nature of the NPs was further confirmed by excitation intensity dependent fluorescence spectra. As shown in Fig. 2c, the higher the excitation power was used, the stronger the fluorescence intensity that could be obtained. The quadratic dependence of fluorescence spectrum's integrated area on the excitation laser power confirmed that the observed emission indeed arises from TPE (Fig. 2c, inset). The TPA cross sections of PT NPs at different wavelengths were measured. As presented in Fig. 2d, in the excitation region of 740–820 nm, the TPA cross section of PT NPs was around 3000 GM and the largest value was up to 3420 GM at 770 nm, which is much higher than the clinically used PSs (∼100 GM).
3.3. 
          In vitro cellular uptake of PT NPs
To determine the subcellular localization of PT NPs, a commercially available lysosome-targeting dye, LysoTracker Deep Red was used for a co-localization study. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, both PT NPs and LysoTracker Deep Red show strong fluorescence inside the cells. The fluorescence images of PT NPs and LysoTracker Deep Red can be merged rather well (Fig. 3c and d), confirming that PT NPs can specifically target the lysosomes of living cells. In addition, there are only a few differences in the emission intensity profiles of PT NPs and LysoTracker Deep Red (Fig. 3e) within the linear region of interest (ROI; given by a white line in Fig. 3d). Furthermore, a high Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.9028 was calculated from the intensity correlation plots (Fig. 3f). These results demonstrate that PT NPs are lysosome-targetable and can be used for imaging in living cells with satisfactory performance. The lysosome targeting property might be related to the triethylenediamine group. As we know that the micro-environment of the lysosome is weakly acidic (pH 4.5–5.5), some amine groups like morpholine and diethylenediamine are inclined to remain within the lysosome due to the protonation of the amine groups.48,49 There are many triethylenediamine groups located at the surface of PT NPs. These triethylenediamine groups might be inclined to selectively target the lysosome owing to their similar structure to diethylenediamine.

To explore the cellular uptake mechanism of PT NPs, we investigated the effect of temperature on the uptake efficiency. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the cellular uptake of PT NPs was significantly inhibited when HeLa cells were pre-incubated at 4 °C. Furthermore, three endocytosis inhibitors including chlorpromazine (CPZ), cytisine, and amiloride were employed to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveola-mediated endocytosis, and micropinocytosis, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), when HeLa cells were pre-incubated with CPZ, cytisine and amiloride, the cellular uptake efficiencies were 89.1%, 86.5% and 88.2%, respectively. This result demonstrated that clathrin- and caveola-independent endocytosis plays a crucial role in the uptake of PT NPs.
3.4. Generation of 1O2
Another important parameter for a PS is the capability of producing 1O2. When the PT NPs D2O solution was exposed to the irradiation of a laser at 532 nm, a characteristic luminescence peak of 1O2 at 1275 nm could be observed (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the ability of PT NPs to generate 1O2 under the TPE mode was investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4b, a characteristic 1O2-induced signal was detected in the ESR spectra of PT NPs aqueous solution, while the ESR spectra of pure water show no obvious changes before and after 800 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S5a, ESI†). Moreover, the 1O2 was detected by using disodium 9,10-anthracenedipropionic acid (Na2-ADPA). As shown in Fig. 4c, the characteristic absorption band of Na2-ADPA gradually decreased with prolonged irradiation time, which indicated that Na2-ADPA has been partially consumed by 1O2. The 1O2 quantum yield was calculated to be 42% by using Rose Bengal as the standard photosensitizer (the detailed data are shown in Fig. S5b–f, ESI†).

(d) Dose-dependent OPE (red histogram, white light, 400–780 nm, 10 min, 80 mW) and TPE (blue histogram, 800 nm laser, 10 min, 500 mW) PDT effects of the cell viability of HeLa cells. The black histogram represents the cytotoxicity of PT NPs under dark conditions. 
3.5. 
          In vitro OPE and TPE PDT
The standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium hydrobromide) assay was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PT NPs. As shown in Fig. 4d (black histograms), the cell viability remained nearly 90% after incubation with PT NPs (50 μg mL−1) for 24 h under dark conditions, whereas, the cell viability decreased to 60% if HeLa cells incubated with PT NPs (3 μg mL−1) were exposed to the irradiation of white light for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 4d (red histograms), the cell viability under the irradiation of white light is highly dependent on the concentration of NPs. With the increase of NP concentration, the cell viability is gradually decreasing. By contrast, HeLa cells maintained high cell viability even at a high concentration of NPs (20 μg mL−1). Encouraged by their low dark cytotoxicity and high phototoxicity, we further explored its potential application for TPE PDT by using an 800 nm laser as the light source. As shown in Fig. 4d (blue histograms), the cell viability was decreased to 27% in the presence of 12 μg mL−1 PT NPs after irradiation for 10 min.
Their outstanding properties, including large TPA cross section, good photostability, and high fluorescence and 1O2 quantum yields, enable PT NPs to have the capability for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and therapy. The TPE phototheranostic efficiency of PT NPs on HeLa cells was studied by two-photon laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5a, strong fluorescence was observed from the HeLa cells after treatment with PT NPs under 800 nm excitation, while no fluorescence signal could be collected in the absence of PT NPs (Fig. 5b). The morphology changes of HeLa cells were further monitored during the period of irradiation for 3 min. As expected, the morphology of cells pretreated with PT NPs significantly changed (the formation of numerous blebs, Fig. 5). However, no obvious cell morphology changes could be observed in the absence of PT NPs after the same light irradiation (Fig. 5, down), suggesting that the light used in this experiment was safe for the cells and the cell death was indeed induced by the irradiation of PT NPs. These results indicate that PT NPs can serve as efficient PSs for TPE PDT which allows simultaneous fluorescence imaging and therapy of cancer cells.

In comparison with other TPE PDT nanomaterials, PT NPs have their own merits. For example, Au nanostructures exhibit a large TPA cross section (over 104 GM). Nevertheless, Au nanostructures in general need surface-bound stabilizing ligands to attain their water dispersity, and these organic molecules may degrade the biocompatibility of Au nanostructures. Moreover, the Au nanostructures usually have a high photo-thermal conversion efficiency and a low 1O2 generation yield (<10%).50 In addition, the morphology of Au nanomaterials is susceptible to laser irradiation, which further influences their fluorescence and 1O2 generation.51 In comparison with Au nanostructures, PT NPs have a lower TPA cross section, but PT NPs are superior to Au nanostructures in water dispersity, biocompatibility, photo- and pH-stabilities, and 1O2 generation quantum yield (∼42%). Graphene quantum dots have high TPA cross section, excellent water dispersity, biocompatibility and pH- and photo-stabilities. Our recent work also demonstrated that graphene quantum dots could be used as a new photosensitizer due to their high 1O2 generation yield.7 However, the 1O2 generation efficiency of graphene quantum dots strongly depends on their size, microstructure, surface state, doping elements, doping level, precursors and the methods used for their synthesis, and it still needs substantial effort to understand how these factors affect the 1O2 generation efficiency of graphene quantum dots. Moreover, large-scale and controllable synthesis of graphene quantum dots is still a challenging work. In comparison with graphene quantum dots, PT NPs have a smaller TPA cross section, but they exhibit comparable water dispersity, biocompatibility, pH- and photo-stability, and 1O2 generation yield. Moreover, PT NPs have an accurate molecular structure, which enables us to obtain a scalable synthesis and have better control over its photochemical and photophysical properties.
3.6. 
          Ex vivo TPE deep imaging
The ex vivo TPE fluorescence imaging capability of the PT NPs was further studied by using intralipid as the mock tissue due to its similar scattering property to real tissue.52,53 The schematic of the imaging setup is shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The stock of intralipid solution (1%) was injected into the tunable gap of the two coverslips to simulate the biological tissues with different thicknesses. A drop of PT NP aqueous solution was dripped on the top coverslip, and a two-photon laser scanning confocal microscope was used to image the PT NPs at different depths in the mock tissue. The obtained TPE fluorescence images (upper panel of Fig. S6b, ESI†) indicate that the PT NPs have good imaging properties including high resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio at depths ranging from 0 to 1300 μm in the tissue phantom by using an 800 nm laser as the excitation source. Even at the depth of 1800 μm, the TPE fluorescence signal of PT NPs can also be detected by enhancing the power of the laser. In contrast, the OPE fluorescence imaging (lower panel of Fig. S6b, ESI†) shows that the maximum penetration depth is less than 800 μm (even using the full output power of excitation). These results also demonstrate the capability of PT NPs for deep tissue fluorescence imaging.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared water soluble conjugated polymer nanoparticles that can specifically accumulate in lysosomes. The investigation of the cellular uptake pathway of PT NPs showed that the cellular uptake of the NPs is energy dependent, and the clathrin- and caveola-independent pathway is the main approach in the endocytic progress of these NPs. The PT NPs have some outstanding properties, such as large TPA cross section, high 1O2 generation quantum yield, strong fluorescence, excellent photostability and pH-stability, and low dark cytotoxicity, which enable the PT NPs to simultaneously achieve fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy under one- or two-photon irradiation. Furthermore, PT NPs show excellent deep tissue imaging capability upon NIR excitation. The imaging penetration depth of 1300 μm was achieved by PT NPs in the tissue phantom under the TPE mode. Therefore, these NPs have great potential for application in TPE phototheranostics.
