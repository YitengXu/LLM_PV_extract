    , Accepted 14th April 2020First published on 14th April 2020AbstractBacteriorhodopsin (bR), a proton-pumping protein that converts light into electrochemical energy, has recently attracted attention for solar energy conversion applications. However, its application for electrochemical supercapacitors has not been reported due to the demanding requirements on ordered oriented membranes. Herein, the authors explore bR for supercapacitor application by decorating oriented bR-monolayers onto the surface of an ordered and highly capacitive polyaniline (PANI)-nanofilm prepared by electropolymerization on an Au electrode. The prepared PANI-nanofilm displays good and tunable pseudocapacitive performance attributed to its multiple proton doping states. Due to the synergistic contribution of light-induced proton pumping capacity and the photoelectric function of bR, the specific capacitance of the bR/PANI/Au-electrode has been enhanced pronouncedly by the introduction of oriented bR-monolayers, and has been further improved upon light irradiation. At a current density of 60 A g−1, a specific capacitance as high as 1146 F g−1 was achieved following 550 nm light irradiation for the as-prepared bR/PANI-nanocomposites.
Introduction
The introduction of biomolecules into nanomaterials endows the composite nanomaterials with desired biofunctions, which has become a new research focus.1–7 The integration of DNA and proteins with engineered nanomaterials has shown promise for potential versatile energy conversion applications.5–15 Recently, Rusling et al. described the implantation of proteins into graphene oxide-based capacitors,5 in which the introduction of proteins provides the capacitors with a better biocompatibility. Furthermore, the structure of proteins provides pseudocapacitive behavior for charge/discharge (due to protonatable charged amino acid residues), and makes shuttling of ions more convenient. Very recently, bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a natural proton-pumping protein in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum that converts light into electrochemical energy, has attracted research interest toward energy conversion applications,1,8–20 due to its exceptional stability to chemical, thermal, and photochemical degradation, and unique photoelectric and photochromic properties. Although bR has been integrated with functional nanomaterials for solar energy applications,6–11 such as bR/TiO210–12 and Pt/TiO2/bR,9 and electrocatalytic water splitting for H2 production,12,13 no reports so far have been made to use bR as an active bio-component for electrochemical supercapacitor applications due to the extremely demanding requirements on ordered oriented membranes to take full advantage of the proton pumping capacity of bR and achieve high-efficiency solar-to-electrochemical energy conversion.
Supercapacitors, as important energy storage devices, have aroused worldwide attention for their use in portable electronics and electric vehicles21,22 because of their high power density, fast charge–discharge capacity and long cycle life. Among numerous capacitor materials, polyaniline (PANI) is widely used and promising for the next-generation of supercapacitor devices23–28 due to its high-energy density, reversible proton doping/de-doping properties, low-cost, excellent environmental stability and tunable pseudocapacitive performance associated with its multiple oxidation states. Various carbon nanomaterials,24,25 metal oxides26 and other polymers27 have been incorporated into the PANI-polymer to increase the surface area and mechanical properties of PANI-based supercapacitors.23–27 In this study, we explore bR photochemical properties for supercapacitor application by decorating oriented bR-monolayers onto the surface of an ordered and highly capacitive PANI-nanofilm, prepared by electropolymerization on an Au electrode. The capacitance performance of the bR/PANI/Au-electrode has been enhanced pronouncedly by the introduction of oriented bR-monolayers, of which bR photo-activity (both proton pumping capacity and biological conductance functionality) mediates the proton doping/de-doping and electron transport processes of the PANI-nanofilm.
Results and discussion
Ordered PANI-nanofilms were constructed by electrodeposition. To obtain uniform and ordered PANI-nanofilms, 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) was first self-assembled on the gold electrode surface via Au-thiol chemistry.29,30 The successful assembly of 4-ATP was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S1 & S2, respectively in the ESI†). The Raman spectrum of the 4-ATP monolayer on gold showed a series of peaks centered at 1007, 1088, 1177, 1494 and 1593 cm−1, which can be assigned to the C–C bending vibration, C (benzene)–S stretching vibration, C–H band stretching vibration and C–C stretching vibration of benzene rings, respectively.29 As shown in CV curves (Fig. S2†), the redox peaks of 4-ATP can be clearly observed. The oriented PANI-nanofilms were then electrodeposited on the 4-ATP monolayer-modified gold electrode by the CV technique in 0.1 M aniline and 1 M H2SO4 solution. The 4-ATP cation radicals can be selectively electrogenerated on the electrode surface and act as nucleation sites for ordered polyaniline growth through head-to-tail coupling at the C4 and N position of 4-ATP.29 As shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1a and b), the as-prepared PANI-films are composed of homogeneous and close-packed nanopillar arrays with a flat top in the range of ∼200–500 nm, which is in agreement with a previous report.30 The thickness of PANI-films is controlled by deposition cycles, with a typical thickness of ∼260–360 nm for one cycle deposition, as determined by SEM measurements (Fig. 1c).

bR-containing small phosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with a mean hydrodynamic size of ∼125 nm and a typical zeta potential of −26.8 mV (determined by dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential measurements as shown in Fig. S3 & S4†) were prepared according to our previous method.12,17,18 As shown in Fig. S5,† the prepared vesicle suspension displays a typical bR absorption at about 568 nm. The successful insertion of bR into SUVs was further confirmed by measuring the light-induced pH change of the vesicle solution. Upon illumination with green light, the solution pH increased by about 0.08 units, due to proton pumping from the solution to the vesicle interior.17 Oriented bR/PANI-nanofilms were then constructed by electrostatic adsorption of freshly prepared, surface negatively charged bR-vesicles onto PANI surfaces, followed by vesicle fusion to form oriented bR-monolayers on the outside surfaces of PANI-nanofilms.12 A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to monitor the mass change during the process (Fig. S6†). The mass of PANI and bR deposited on a 2 mm-diameter gold electrode was estimated to be ∼1.16 μg and 5.46 × 10−3 μg, respectively. The successful adsorption of bR on PANI-nanofilms was confirmed as well by SEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses (Fig. 1d–i), the Raman mapping image (Fig. S7†), Raman spectra (Fig. 1j), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 1k & S8†). As shown in the EDX image (Fig. 1d–i) and Raman mapping image (Fig. S7†), the P and S elements from bR vesicles were uniformly dispersed on the PANI film. And as shown in Fig. 1j, the Raman spectrum of the PANI-film showed a series of peaks characteristic of PANI. The peaks at 1076, 1175, 1342, 1511 and 1582 cm−1 correspond to the C (benzene)–S stretching vibration, C–H band stretching vibration, C–N stretching of semiquinone, CN stretching of the quinoid ring, and C–C stretching of the benzene ring, respectively.31 Most of the Raman spectra of bR have been covered by PANI,31 except the peak at 1470 cm−1, which corresponds to the C–C–H in-plane deformation mode of bR.20 Moreover, the XPS spectrum of the PANI-film (Fig. 1k) exhibited bands at 285.3, 399.4, and 532.4 eV, corresponding to C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively. In addition to these peaks, the XPS spectrum of the resulting bR/PANI-film showed a peak at 132 eV, which is associated with P2p states of bR (Fig. S8d†). These spectra indicated that bR has been successfully assembled on the surface of PANI-films.
The as-prepared bR monolayer preserved its photoactivity after the deposition on PANI films. As shown in Fig. S9,† after irradiation with green light (λ = 550 nm) for about 5 min, the characteristic peak of ground state bR at ca. 570 nm disappeared, while a new peak centered at ca. 420 nm emerged, indicating bR changed into an M-like intermediate. And after keeping in the dark for another 5 min, the peak at 570 nm reappeared, while the peak at 420 nm disappeared, indicating that the M-like intermediate of bR has transferred back to its ground state.22
Strong and direct evidence of both maintained photoactivity and orientation of bR in the monolayers was further confirmed by measuring pH changes of the bR/PANI film electrode in solution upon light irradiation. In this study, the bR/PANI film electrode as well as a portable pH meter were immersed into the Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution to monitor the light induced pH change. For the oriented-bR/PANI electrode, upon illumination with 550 nm light, the pH of the 4 mL Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution decreased gradually from 4.23 to 4.15 (Video S1†) within 3 min, indicating the outward proton pumping contribution of the bR in the film electrode since the monolayered bR proteins were oriented on the PANI film electrode surface with the cytoplasmic side facing the substrate surface.18 For the random bR/PANI electrode (prepared by electrostatic deposition of native bR patches, in which both sides of bR are negatively charged and can attach randomly to the electrode surface), due to the offset of the outward/inward proton pumping in the system, the pH increased by only about 0.01 pH unit under light irradiation (Video S2†). For a bare solution without the bR/PANI electrode, the pH did not change under the same light irradiation (Video S3†). The quantum efficiency for this light-associated process was calculated to be ∼3% (the detailed calculation process can be found in the ESI†).32,33
To check the possible solar supercapacitor behavior of a purely bR photoelectrode (PANI free), an oriented-bR monolayer was firstly prepared by the same method via electrostatic adsorption on the 4-ATP modified Au electrode and tested. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the redox current and capacitance of the 4-ATP modified Au electrode were all obviously enhanced with light irradiation, implying that a purely bR photoelectrode is also useful for a solar supercapacitor. Besides the instinctive capacitor-like behaviors induced by the proton-pump effect which caused an ion concentration difference and generated an electrochemical potential,11 the good bioelectronic conductivity of bR16 also contributes to the capacitance performance of the polymer modified electrodes. We then investigated systematically the supercapacitor behaviors of the bR/PANI system. CV curves were recorded to investigate the capacitance behavior of the prepared PANI and bR/PANI-films in 1.0 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 aqueous solution (pH ∼ 5.0), using a three-electrode cell within a potential range from −0.2 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the peak current, integrated CV area and the discharge time decreased in the order of the orientated bR/PANI (bRo/PANI) films, random bR/PANI (bRr/PANI) film and PANI film, indicating that the incorporation of bR is beneficial to improve the capacitance of the PANI-based capacitor. Irradiation of pure PANI-films showed little effect on the capacitive response. However, irradiation of the bR/PANI-electrode with 550 nm light (using a cut-off filter) led to an additional obvious increase in peak current and integrated area, implying a positive contribution of oriented bR in the hybrid system. We also found experimentally that when the CVs were recorded at a low scan rate, the light effect will be enlarged, which may be due to the fact that more photons could participate in the redox reactions at a low scan rate.

The final bR concentrations for bRo1, bRo2 and bRo3 were 0.12 mg mL−1, 0.25 mg mL−1 and 0.32 mg mL−1, respectively. 
As shown in the redox reaction equation for PANI (Fig. S10†), the oxidation of PANI is accompanied by de-doping of protons; following 550 nm light illumination, the oxidation current of bR/PANI was significantly enhanced, indicating proton release contribution of bR since the monolayered bR is oriented with the cytoplasmic side facing the substrate surface16–18 which, as schematically depicted in Fig. 2e, endows bR with outward proton release capability and hence facilitates the oxidation of PANI-films. Upon illumination with green light, bR transports protons from the PANI film to the electrolyte solution, and with the deprotonation electrons are transferred from the PANI film to the electrode. This was further supported by a control experiment using the randomly oriented bR-monolayer prepared by electrostatic deposition of the native bR-containing purple membrane (whose both sides are negatively charged) onto the surface of PANI-films. In this case only small variation in current density was observed upon light illumination due to the somehow offset of the outward/inward proton release capability of un-oriented bR in the system. As shown in Fig. 2b and d, both the charging process and discharging process were improved by the introduction of oriented bR-monolayers. This implies that besides the proton pumping effect, the bioelectronic conductivity of bR also played an important role in improving the capacitive performance of the system (via improving the charge transport ability of the hybrid films, especially during the discharging process) since bR itself is an effective photoconductive biomaterial.13–16

Fig. 2f shows typical on/off photocurrent responses of the oriented-bR/PANI, random-bR/PANI and PANI electrodes recorded in 1.0 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution at 0.6 V. Compared with the PANI-electrode, pronounced photocurrent generation of the oriented-bR/PANI electrode was observed, indicating proton release contribution of bR in the hybrid system. The process was further manifested by the electrochemical impedance spectrum (Fig. S11†) since the incorporation of bR benefits the electron conduction of PANI. Electrodes with various bR loadings were further tested and assessed to maximize the light-activated capacitance. As shown in Fig. 2g and h, the capacitance performance of the bR/PANI film electrodes increased with the increase of bR content.
Since there are large iR drops for the PANI-based capacitors, attributed to the low conductivity of PANI at pH 5.0 (Fig. 2d), we further investigated the capacitive performance of the bR/PANI-electrode in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution. The capacitive properties showed the same tendency in acidic solutions. As shown in Fig. 3a, typical PANI redox peaks can be observed, and both the potential difference between redox peaks and peak current of bR/PANI increased with increasing scan rate (Fig. 3b), indicating fast diffusion of electrolyte ions at the electrode interface. To assess the electrochemical capacitive performances of the electrodes, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 3c–f. The specific capacitance19 (Cs) of bR/PANI with light illumination was calculated to be 1102 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, higher than that of bR/PANI in the dark (803 F g−1) and that of the bR-free PANI electrode was calculated to be 603 F g−1. Fig. 3d–f show, respectively, the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of bR/PANI-films at different current densities, and the variation of Cs with current density for the bR/PANI under light and in the dark, and PANI-films on the gold electrode. For both the PANI and bR/PANI electrodes, the capacitance values are very well retained with the increase of current density from 2 A g−1 to 60 A g−1, indicating that the ordered head-to-tail structure of PANI-nanofilms is beneficial for electron transfer from PANI to the electrode and there is little dead mass of the PANI-films (Fig. 3g). At a current density of 60 A g−1, higher Cs values of 1146, 804 and 612 F g−1 were obtained for bR/PANI with or without light irradiation and bR-free PANI-films, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the highest value among those of various PANI-based supercapacitors previously reported (Table S1†).

This work represents a successful attempt of using bR for supercapacitor applications. The merits and potentials of integrating bR with capacitive materials for electrochemical energy device applications are obvious since bR is a robust native light-driven proton pump protein with exceptional stabilities (compared to other proteins) towards thermal, chemical, and photochemical degradation (bR survives at harsh pHs of 1–14, in high salt environments, and even at an overly high temperature of 140 °C if immobilized on a solid support).16 The long-term stability of PANI and bR/PANI-electrodes was also examined by continuous cycling. As shown in Fig. 3h, the bR/PANI-electrode has similar long-term stability to the PANI-electrode, indicating the feasibility of bR incorporation for practical supercapacitor application of PANI-films. Nyquist plots (Fig. S12†) showed that the bR/PANI-film has a better conductivity than the PANI-film in acidic solutions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we succeeded in exploring bR, a native proton-pumping protein, for supercapacitor application by integration of oriented bR-monolayers onto the surface of an ordered and highly capacitive PANI-nanofilm that was prepared by electropolymerization on an Au electrode. A superior pseudocapacitive performance of the resulting electrode was achieved, which is attributed to the head-to-tail ordered structure of the conducting PANI that facilitates electron transfer from PANI to the electrode, combined with the maintained proton release and bioelectronic conductivity of bR that mediates the electrochemical process for performance enhancement. At a current density of 60 A g−1, a specific capacitance as high as 1146 F g−1 was achieved under 550 nm light irradiation for the prepared bR/PANI-nanocomposites. This study is a successful attempt of the application of bR in the supercapacitor field.

 	Fig. 1  Characteristics of the prepared PANI and bR/PANI nanofilms. (a and b) SEM images and (c) thickness measurement of the PANI-film. (d–i) SEM images of the bR/PANI (d) and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of C (e), N (f), O (g), P (h) and S (i) for the bR/PANI films. (j) Raman spectra of bR, PANI and bR/PANI. (k) XPS of PANI and bR/PANI films.	 

 	Fig. 2  Electrochemical behaviours of the bR-modified electrode in 1.0 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution (pH ∼ 5.0). (a) CV curves of the bR/Au electrode (PANI-free) in 1.0 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution (pH ∼ 5.0) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. (b) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the bR/Au electrode with light irradiation and in the dark. Under light irradiation, the capacitive properties increased about 1.86 times. (c) CV curves and (d) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of bR/PANI-composites and PANI-films with or without light, at 5 mV s−1 in the potential range from −0.2 to 0.8 V, or at a current density of 5 A g−1; bRo represents the oriented bR film, and bRr represents the random bR film, the concentrations for bRo and bRr were the same. (e) Schematic illustration of photo-assisted H+ de-doping via outward proton release of oriented bR in the bR/PANI system. (f) Photocurrent response of bR/PANI and PANI electrodes at 0.6 V potential in 1.0 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution (pH ∼ 5.0). (g) and (h) The effect of bR content on the capacitive of the bR/PANI electrode. The final bR concentrations for bRo1, bRo2 and bRo3 were 0.12 mg mL−1, 0.25 mg mL−1 and 0.32 mg mL−1, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Light enhanced capacitive performances of bR/PANI in 1.0 M H2SO4. (a) CV curves of bR/PANI-composites and PANI-films with or without light at 100 mV s−1 in 1.0 M H2SO4. (b) CV curves of the bR/PANI-electrode at different scan rates. (c) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of bR/PANI with or without light and the PANI electrode at 2 A g−1. (d–f) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of bR/PANI with light, bR/PANI without light, and the PANI electrode at different current densities, respectively. (g) Variation of the specific capacitance with current density for the bR/PANI-electrode under light or in the dark, and the PANI-electrode. (h) Stability of bR/PANI and PANI-films during the long-term charge–discharge process at 10 A g−1.
