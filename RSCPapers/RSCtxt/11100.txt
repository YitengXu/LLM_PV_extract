    , Accepted 25th March 2017First published on 28th March 2017AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) usually need to be optimized with the strategies of thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapor annealing (SVA), or processing additives (PA) to obtain the best performance. Here, PA and TA were used simultaneously for OSCs based on the novel organic molecules TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT. The synergistic effect of PA and TA on the active-layer morphologies was investigated by measurements of optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and grazing incident X-ray diffraction. Comprehensive results suggest that a PA can enhance the crystallinity of the active layer, whereas subsequent TA treatment can gradually undermine a well-ordered morphology with increasing TA times. However, upon using a PA with reasonable TA treatment (temperature and annealing time), the blends can develop an interpenetrating network with appropriate phase separation to facilitate charge transfer and transportation. Therefore, an OSCs device based on TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM showed the best power conversion efficiency (6.1%) after treatment with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene additive and further annealing at 130 °C for 40 s. These results demonstrate that highly efficient OSCs can be achieved through optimization of active-layer morphology via appropriate PA and TA treatment.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been thought of as a promising next-generation “green” technology due to their low cost, light weight, flexibility and solution processability.1–4 With rapid progress in the past decade, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >10%5–9 have been realized for polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures. This progress has occurred as a result of the development of photoactive materials, including electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials, along with innovations and optimizations in device processing.10–17 Compared with the widely investigated PSCs, solution-processed small-molecule solar cells (SMSCs) have the advantages of easier energy-level control and less batch-to-batch variation which, because small molecules can be obtained at high purity and generally have a monodisperse structure, have attracted increasing attention.18–20
Recently, the PCE of OSCs have also reached ≤10% through careful design of molecular structure as well as device optimization.21 However, the typical integration of efficient small-molecule donors which can achieve high performance remains very limited. Moreover, the morphology of the active layer in OSCs must usually be optimized to obtain the best performance. Strategies such as thermal annealing (TA), processing additives (PA), and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) have been shown to improve the morphologies of some OSCs.22–24 Generally, those strategies are utilized for optimizing the morphologies of the active layer alone. For example, the excellent OSCs based on the benzodithiophene (BDT) core created by Chen et al. exhibited the best PCEs of 9.3% after TA treatment compared with a non-annealing reported value of 3.46%.21 Meanwhile, Cao and colleagues have reported indacenodithiophene (IDT) core-based small molecules, and the best device exhibited a PCE of ≈8.1% after SVA treatment.25 In PA-based techniques, Bazan and coworkers have reported devices based on dithienosilole (DTS) unit small molecules which demonstrated gains in PCE from 1.8% to 7% when added to 0.4 v/v% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO).26 Compared with using a certain strategy alone, sometimes any two of strategies used together could be better and improve PCE further. Chen and colleagues first optimized the morphology of a DR3TSBDT-based blend with TA treatment, followed by SVA treatment, and the corresponding PCE was 6.38% for the non-annealing device, 7.61% for TA and 9.6% for TA combined with the SVA treatment device.27 This improved performance was mainly due to increased absorption due to TA treatment and formation of nanoscale-phase separation with further SVA treatment, which contributes to high exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency. Another successful mixed method is PA treatment with further TA treatment, as reported by Yan et al., which has been used for improving the performance of PffBT4T-OD category-based PSCs.17,28,29 However, the mechanism and driving force for the structural changes that lead to optimized morphologies have not been investigated and remain undetermined. Moreover, PA with further TA treatment has not been attracting adequate attention in OSCs. Thus, there is a need for using this approach to improve OSCs performance and obtain insight into the synergistic effect of PAs and TA in OSCs.
In the present study, the in-air solution-processed acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type small molecules TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT (Fig. 1) were designed and synthesized to obtain insight into the influence of PA with further TA treatment on morphology optimization. The structures of the two small molecules were optimized according to our previously reported small molecule BDT(TffBTTT6)2.30 In our previous work, a moderate PCE of 4.17% was achieved in BDT(TffBTTT6)2-based devices. Its poor solubility and film-forming property limited the possibility to obtain a higher performance in OSCs. Therefore, hexyl chains were enclosed within thiophene groups to overcome those defects. As a result, TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT exhibited an excellent solubility of ≈120 mg ml−1 in chloroform owing to the multiple alkyl chains on the BDT units and the π-bridge. The synergistic effect of PA and TA in TBDT-T6ffBT or OBDT-T6ffBT blends with [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) have been investigated intensively by optical microscopy (OM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Interestingly, there are apparent distinctions in TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM and OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends after treatment with PA and TA, leading to obvious differences in their device-based performance. The OSCs device based on TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM shows the best PCE of 6.1% after treatment with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) additive and further anneals at 130 °C for 40 s. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the best PCE of solution-processed OSCs based on BDT and difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (ffBT) unit small molecules.

2. Results and discussion
The syntheses of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Intermediate products (3) were synthesized by 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and tributyl(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (2) under Stille conditions. Then, compound 3 was coupled to (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (4) or (4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (5) to obtain the final products. The full experimental details and structural characterization (Fig. S1–S3) can be found in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S4, ESI†) was used to investigate the thermal properties of the two small molecules. Under a N2 condition, the onset temperature with 5% weight loss was ≈440 °C for TBDT-T6ffBT and 350 °C for OBDT-T6ffBT, respectively. The thermal stability of the two molecules was good enough for application in OSCs. Additionally, TBDT-T6ffBT with thiophene-conjugated side chains manifested better thermal stability than the corresponding alkoxy-substituted molecules OBDT-T6ffBT, which agrees with a study showing that 2D-conjugated compounds have better thermal stability than alkoxy-substituted compounds.31 The thermal transitions of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 2a. DSC thermograms indicated that alkyl side chains dramatically influenced the thermal properties of a given molecular backbone. Compared with BDT(TffBTTT6)2, the intensive and sharp crystalline exothermic peaks of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT implied improved crystallinity after attachment of hexyl chains to the π-bridge. Thus, TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT with more alkyl side chains could easily form a relatively ordered packing structure in films. The DSC thermograms of the blends of TBDT-T6ffBT:PCBM and OBDT-T6ffBT:PCBM were also measured and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Compared with their pure films, the crystallinity of the two small molecules decreased after blending with PCBM.

The absorption spectra of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT in solution and solid state are shown in Fig. 2b. TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT showed similar absorption in solution and film. Both small molecules showed two obvious absorption bands in solution. Band one in the region 300–450 nm was due to a π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, whereas band two in the region 450–600 nm was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the molecular donor and acceptor units. In comparison with their solutions, TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT films exhibited a noticeable bathochromic shift by 50 and 60 nm at λmax, respectively, thus indicating molecular packing in the solid state. The optical band gaps calculated from the absorption edges of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT films were 1.73 and 1.72 eV, respectively, as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1 (ESI†), the frontier orbital energy levels of TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT were estimated from their cyclic voltammogram (CV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated from the onset of the oxidation, and were −5.29 eV for TBDT-T6ffBT and −5.36 for OBDT-T6ffBT. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for TBDT-T6ffBT and OBDT-T6ffBT were −3.56 and −3.64 eV, respectively, which were calculated from the difference between the optical band gap and the corresponding HOMO energy level.
Then, OSCs devices were fabricated by an ITO/ZnO/active-layer/MoO3/Ag structure in which the organic molecules were TBDT-T6ffBT or OBDT-T6ffBT. We tried to optimize device performance by utilizing the PA and TA techniques. Fig. 2c depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the optimized devices. The detailed photovoltaic properties are shown in Table 1. The performance of TBDT-T6ffBT-based devices was first optimized by choosing different acceptor (PC61BM or PC71BM) as well as changing donor/acceptor weight ratios (Fig. S7 and Table S2, ESI†). The solar cell based on TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM displayed the best PCE of 2.59% with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:0.8. Then, the morphologies of the active layer were optimized by using the TA method (treatment with a different temperature for 10 min). Optimal performance was obtained when the TA temperature was 130 °C, resulting in a PCE of 4.2%. The increased PCE was mainly due to the increased crystallinity of the active layer and stronger optical absorption, resulting in a substantial improvement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) (9.16 mA cm−2vs. 5.51 mA cm−2). It is noticeable that the device performance decreased dramatically after the active layer annealed at high temperature (160 °C) probably owing to the destructive morphology of the blend. After that, the device performance was improved by PA technology using 1-CN additive. After adding 0.5 v/v% 1-CN additive, the PCE was significantly improved to 5.1% with remarkably enhanced Jsc and fill factor (FF) (Table 1).

To further optimize the device performance, PA and TA simultaneous treatment on a TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM-based device was investigated systematically. First, the blends were spin-coated from the active-layer solutions with 0.5 v/v% 1-CN additive. Then, the blends were annealed at 130 °C before being transferred to the vacuum chamber of a thermal evaporator within the same glovebox. Surprisingly, the performance of the devices were significantly influenced by the different TA times. As shown in Table 1, the performance of the solar cells improved with annealing for a short time (<40 s), and further decreased dramatically after annealing for a long time (>2 min). Noticeably, the device that annealed at 130 °C for 40 s showed the best PCE of 6.1% with a highest Jsc of 12.08 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V, and FF of 62.3%. It is important to note that such high efficiencies of 6.1% are among the best achieved for OSCs from organic small-molecules donors. These devices are much more efficient than the best reported BDT- and difluorobenzothiadiazole-based OSCs devices.32–35 However, in the case of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM-based devices, TA and PA technology did not optimize device performance (Fig. S8 and Table S3, ESI†). Without any treatment, the best-performance solar cell of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM was based on a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:0.8 (Table S2, ESI†). The pristine version showed a PCE of 1.86% with a lower Voc of 0.759 V, Jsc of 4.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 50.5%. The lower Voc compared with that for a TBDT-T6ffBT-based device could have been due to the distinct difference in the morphology of the blend. We found that neither TA nor PA treatment resulted in enhanced PCEs. Indeed, a significantly declined FF and worse Voc were obtained when compared with the pristine device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized OSCs was measured to verify the accuracy of the measurement. As shown in Fig. 2d, the conversion of photons to electrons was apparently improved after PA and TA treatment, resulting in much higher Jsc. The observed changes upon PA and TA indicated significant morphological rearrangements in the blend after PA and TA treatment, which led to better molecular packing of the active layer. These changes were also attested in a color change of the films from brown without any annealing to dark-blue after PA and TA treatment (see inserts in Fig. 2d). The Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE data agreed well with those obtained from J–V measurements.
To understand the effect of PA and TA treatment on the significantly improved efficiency as well as the correlation of the observed device performance differences between the two molecules, detailed investigations on those devices are presented. The light-intensity-dependent J–V characteristics, charge mobilities, and morphology of the blends were determined to ascertain the mechanism of PA and TA treatment and structure–property relationships of the device performance.

Fig. 3 exhibits the OM images of the active layer before and after PA and TA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3a, a very uniform and homogeneous morphology of the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine film was observed. After PA treatment, as shown in Fig. 3b, the crystallinity of the active layer could be enhanced, thus the film morphology became well-ordered, which could facilitate charge transfer and transportation. With further TA treatment, the well-ordered morphology gradually decreased with increasing time of TA treatment (Fig. 3c and d) and the morphology was disrupted severely when annealing time reached 2 min (Fig. 3e and f). These worse morphologies could explain why the device performance decreased significantly after TA treatment for >2 min. However, in the case of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends, the outcomes were completely different. Compared with the OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine blend, the annealed (PA or PA + TA) blends became highly disordered, which could be detrimental to charge transportation and lead to a very low PCE (Fig. 3h–j). It is very surprising that such a distinct difference in morphology was induced by PA and TA treatment between TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM and OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends. Then, AFM measurements of blends with or without PA and TA treatment were performed. The surface morphology of the blends are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a–f are AFM height images of TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM with or without PA and TA treatment. The TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine blend exhibited a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.25 nm. After addition of 0.5 v/v% 1-CN additive, the active layer roughness decreased to 3.85 nm. This smooth surface could provide good contact between electrodes and the active layer, favoring more efficient charge transport and improving performance. Upon further optimization with TA at 130 °C for different times, the roughness of the blends gradually increased to 6.43 nm. Fig. 4h–j are AFM height images of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM with or without PA and TA treatment. Compared with the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine blend, the roughness of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine blend was 8.25 nm. This rough surface would be not favorable for charge separation or transport, leading to a low PCE. It was similar to the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blend upon treatment with PA technology: the roughness decreased to 5.14 nm, then increased to 5.82 nm by subsequent TA at 130 °C for 40 s. The phase images of TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM and OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends before and after PA and TA treatment are also depicted in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Noticeably, there was a apparent difference between TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM- and OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM-based active layers. For the two molecules-based pristine blends, OBDT-T6ffBT aggregated severely in contrast to TBDT-T6ffBT, indicating that OBDT-T6ffBT mixed worse with PC61BM, which decreased exciton dissociation and charge transportation (see Fig. S9a and h, ESI†). Upon PA and TA treatment, TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends formed a clear donor–acceptor phase separation while OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends still aggregated obviously with many fibrillar networks. The severe aggregation of OBDT-T6ffBT could partly account for the low efficiency of the OBDT-T6ffBT-based device.

To gain further insight into the reason for the different performance of the two molecules-based devices as well as the effect of PA and TA treatment with different times, the morphologies of the active layers were investigated by TEM (Fig. 5 and Fig. S10, ESI†). Without addition of 1-CN, the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine blend displayed severe PC61BM-rich aggregation (dark areas) in the range 100–200 nm (Fig. 5a). The poor mixing of TBDT-T6ffBT with PC61BM resulted in a low PCE of the TBDT-T6ffBT-based device. The large PC61BM-rich domains disappeared and a homogeneous morphology with inconspicuous phase-separation features was found when 1-CN was added, thereby leading to an enhanced Jsc and FF (Fig. 5b). However, ideal nanostructures with separated donor and acceptor domains have not been observed yet. With further TA treatment for different times, phase separation and a bi-continuous interpenetrating network appeared, especially when the blend annealed for 40 s (Fig. 5d). As the annealing time reached ≥2 min, the morphology became inhomogeneous and some cracks emerged (Fig. 5e and f), which was detrimental for exciton diffusion/dissociation, resulting in a lower Jsc. By contrast, the OBDT-T6ffBT-based blends displayed inhomogeneous morphologies whether the 1-CN was added or not, resulting in a quite low PCE (Fig. S10a and b, ESI†). This finding could also explain why the performance of OBDT-T6ffBT-based devices cannot be improved by PA and TA treatment, which was in agreement with the result of OM and AFM measurements.

The scale bar is 200 nm. 
To further understand the performance changes in TBDT-T6ffBT-based devices after addition of 0.5 v/v% 1-CN followed by different TA times, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and out-of-plane GIXRD were characterized to study the structure order/molecular packing of TBDT-T6ffBT pure films and blends with PC61BM before and after TA (Fig. 6 and Fig. S11, ESI†). The pure blend and blend without any treatment both showed very low crystallinity with no diffraction peaks, which indicated the amorphous nature of the pristine blend. On the other hand, upon TA, the crystallinity of the TBDT-T6ffBT blend was significantly enhanced. This can be seen from the (100) diffraction in Fig. S11 (ESI†). For the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM blends after treatment with the PA method, the GIXRD pattern showed an obvious (100) diffraction. The enhanced degree of crystallization could improve the phase purity as well as intermix the phase area of the materials, which had positive effects on the photovoltaic performance. Then, the annealed (PA treatment) blends were treated at 130 °C for different times (from 20 s to 10 min). To our surprise, TA did not further improve the degree of crystallization of the blends, but instead gradually decreased increasing annealing time. Hence, unlike optimizing the blend by pure TA (as can enhance the crystallinity of the blend), TA after PA treatment could distort its crystallinity. Additionally, the longer the annealing time, the more serious was the damage in crystallinity. Also, reasonable crystallinity of the blend as well as desirable phase separation are important for exciton diffusion/dissociation, and thus lead to high efficiency in blend-based devices.

Besides, to assess the effects of the optimized device with PA and PA + TA on the charge recombination properties in OPVs, the light-intensity-dependent J–V characteristics of TBDT-T6ffBT-based solar cells with optimization at different conditions (optimized by 0.5 v/v% 1-CN vs. 0.5 v/v% 1-CN with 130 °C annealing for 40 s) were measured. Fig. 7a shows a log–log plot scale and is fitted to a power law according the equation:Jsc ∝ IαIf the slope of the curve (α) reaches I, then it implies weak bimolecular recombination, and the free carriers can be “swept out” and collected by the electrodes efficiently.35 The calculated α values for the devices with PA and PA + TA treatment were 0.98, and 0.96, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the two devices was very weak. Besides, the trap-assisted recombination process was also investigated by measuring the dependence of Voc on the light intensity. We plotted Vocversus the logarithm of light intensity using the following equation:Voc ∝ nkT/qln(P)where k, T, q, and P are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in Kelvin, the elementary charge, and the light intensity, respectively. Normally, for bimolecular recombination dominating in OPVs, the slope of Vocversus light intensity should equal kT/q, whereas a stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope larger than kT/q is obtained, for trap-assisted recombination predominating the loss of charge carriers.36 As shown in Fig. 7b, compared with slopes of 1.36kT/q for the device optimized by only PA treatment, the calculated slope of 1.23kT/q for the device that had PA + TA treatment implied the weaker dependence of Voc on the light intensity. This result demonstrated that further TA treatment leads to fewer trapping centers during charge transport, which consequently increases the FF and Jsc parameters in OPVs.

To further probe the charge dissociation and collection process, measurements of the charge dissociation probability P(E, T) were examined for the two differently treated devices, as shown in Fig. 7c. The P(E, T) is defined as Jph/Jsat, and the Jph is defined as Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Veff is defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage at Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias.37Jsat is where the Jph reaches its saturation at high reverse voltage (Veff > 2.0 V), which means all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated to free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. The plot of photo current density against the effective voltage Veff in logarithmic scale allows calculation of P(E, T) under the Jsc condition, and yielded 89.5% and 91.3% for the blend that had PA treatment and the blend that had PA and TA simultaneous treatment, respectively. The higher P(E, T) values indicate that a higher charge-dissociation efficiency occurred at interfaces between TBDT-T6ffBT and PC61BM blends after PA and TA treatment, which is consistent with the improvement in Jsc and FF after further TA for 40 s. Moreover, the different charge transfer ability of the blends with different times of annealing were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method,38–40 as shown in Fig. 7d and Fig. S12a (ESI†). The hole mobility for the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine device was 2.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was much higher than the value (3.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) for OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM pristine device (Fig. S12b, ESI†). After addition of 0.5 v/v% 1-CN as the additive, the hole mobility for TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM increased to 1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas for OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM it decreased to 7.53 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. This extremely low mobility could partly explain why the performance of OBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM-based devices was very poor. It can be clearly seen that the hole mobility for the TBDT-T6ffBT:PC61BM (with 0.5 v/v% 1-CN) device with annealing at 130 °C for 40 s was the highest (1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the hole mobility fell to 9.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the annealing time was 2 and 10 min, respectively. The changes in the hole mobility of PBT-2TPF4:PCBM with different annealing times also verified that the charge transport was more efficient when annealing for 40 s.
3. Conclusions
The synergistic effect of PA and TA in two novel TBDT-T6ffBT- and OBDT-T6ffBT-based small molecule OSCs was investigated. For a TBDT-T6ffBT-based device, using PA technology alone can induce orderly arrangement of molecules, resulting in enhancement of the crystallinity of the blend, whereas using the TA method individually not only enhanced the blend crystallinity but also could enable phase separation owing to an aggregation of fullerene. Interestingly, TA treatment could break the enhanced crystallinity of the blend with PA technology, and the longer the annealing time, the more serious was the damage. Thus, the TA time must be short and the optimized value was found to be 40 s, which corresponded to the best performance of the device (PCE of 6.1%). To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the best PCE values for solution-processed OSCs based on BDT and ffBT small-molecule units. Additionally, the situation for OBDT-T6ffBT was different to that for OBDT-T6ffBT-based devices, which displayed inhomogeneous morphologies after PA and TA treatment; these are not beneficial for exciton diffusion/dissociation and lead to quite low PCE values. Their dissimilar device performance and reaction to PA and TA treatment could be rationalized by their different chemical structures. It can be anticipated that further improvement in device performance could be realized by the appropriate simultaneous use of PA and TA technology to better control the crystallization dynamics during film formation.
