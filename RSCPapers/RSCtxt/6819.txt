    , Accepted 27th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractN2 fixation is one of the most important chemical reactions in the ecosystem of our planet. However, the industrial Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis process is restricted by harsh reaction conditions (350–550 °C, 150–350 atm) and undesirable environmental effects (a large amount of CO2 emission). Photocatalytic N2 fixation is promising for achieving sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions with lower energy input and less environmental issues. However, the known photocatalysts for N2 reduction under mild conditions still face the great challenge of very low energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we report a facile solution-phase method to prepare the heterojunctions based on n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods and oxygen-vacancy-rich p-type BiOBr nanosheets (Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr). Originating from the formation of p–n junctions and suitable bandgap configuration, the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions exhibit effective light utilization and photogenerated electron–hole separation properties. Moreover, it is confirmed that the oxygen vacancies on BiOBr nanosheets are propitious to the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules. Benefiting from these merits, the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions exhibit improved photocatalytic performance for N2 conversion to ammonia without any noble metal co-catalysts and sacrificial reagents under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Nitrogen is a crucial element to many biomolecules essential to life, such as nucleic acids, proteins and so on.1 Despite N2 being abundant in the atmosphere, most organisms cannot directly utilize it because of the very stable molecular structure of the N2 molecule with the presence of the non-polar energetic NN triple bond.2,3 On the other hand, ammonia synthesis is also one of the most important chemical processes, because ammonia is the necessary raw material for fertilizer production and a potential energy carrier with high gravimetric hydrogen density (∼17.6 wt%).4–6 Until now, large-scale ammonia production has still been predominantly dependent on the energy extensive Haber–Bosch process that transforms N2 and H2 into ammonia on the surface of the iron-based catalysts under high temperature and high pressure conditions.7,8 Therefore, it is of great significance to develop green and sustainable methods for ammonia production.
Notably, biochemical N2 fixation can be achieved by nitrogenases in organisms under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions.9,10 Inspired by this natural reaction, photocatalytic N2 fixation has recently attracted rising attention because it can use clean and abundant solar power as the driving force to convert N2 and H2O to NH3 under mild conditions.11,12 However, the development of photocatalytic N2 fixation is greatly hampered by the lack of robust and efficient photocatalysts. Although photocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3 has been demonstrated on various photocatalysts such as TiO2, CdS, WO3, g-C3N4 and so on,13–17 the catalytic activities for NH3 production are still relatively low. The main reasons could be listed as follows: (1) it is very difficult to adsorb the nonpolar N2 molecule on the surface of photocatalysts;18,19 (2) the strong NN triple bond with a high bond energy of ∼941 kJ mol is too stable to be cleaved;20 (3) some high energy intermediates are involved in the reaction process;19,21 and (4) the rapid recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes may result in the inefficient separation and utilization of photogenerated charges.22,23 To alleviate these issues, various strategies have been developed to improve the performance of photocatalysts, including loading of noble metal co-catalysts (e.g. Au, Pt, Ru, etc.),24,25 tuning of compositions (e.g. doping),17,23 constructing heterostructures, and modulating the bandgap and electron structures (e.g. defect engineering).26–28
Herein, we report a reasonably designed photocatalyst based on the heterojunctions of n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods and oxygen-vacancy-rich p-type BiOBr nanosheets (Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr). The surface of the n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods are covered by ultrathin p-type OV-BiOBr nanosheets to produce nanostructural p–n junctions, which exhibit a broad range of light absorption and efficient photogenerated charge separation/transport rates.29–32 In addition, the hierarchical structure of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions with relatively large specific surface area can provide more active sites for nitrogen fixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the OV-BiOBr nanosheets are very conducive to the adsorption and activation of inert N2 molecules and can also serve as electron traps to localize electrons for N2 fixation reaction.25–27 Some previous reports have also demonstrated that oxygen vacancies can facilitate the activation of small molecules.33,34 Benefiting from the good synergistic effect of p–n heterojunctions and oxygen vacancies, the as-synthesized Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr photocatalyst exhibits good photocatalytic activity for N2 conversion to NH3 in ultrapure water under ambient conditions without the need for any co-catalysts or sacrificial reagents.
Experimental
Materials synthesis

Preparation of α-MoO3 nanorods. 
Typically, 1210 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O and 584.4 mg of NaCl were dissolved in 40 mL of ultrapure water, and then 10 mL of 3 M HCl was added to it dropwise under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the resulting solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then heated at 180 °C for 20 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, and then the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times, respectively. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C for 24 h.


Preparation of Bi2MoO6 nanorods. 
Bi2MoO6 nanorods were prepared by a simple solution-phase reflux process. Typically, 100 mg of the obtained MoO3 nanorods were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water with ultrasonication for 10 min to form a homogeneous suspension. Subsequently, 679.0 mg of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring. The suspension was refluxed with an oil bath at 120 °C for 4 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the product was collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight.


Preparation of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions. 
Briefly, 300 mg of the as-synthesized Bi2MoO6 nanorods were added into 80 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) under vigorous stirring followed by the addition of 95.5 mg of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and stirred for 1 h to obtain solution A. Meanwhile, 85.7 mg of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was added into 20 mL of EG under stirring to obtain solution B. Solution B was added dropwise slowly into solution A under stirring. After 10 min, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 8 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, and the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times, respectively. Finally, the precipitate was dried at 80 °C overnight.

Material characterization
The morphological features of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6480) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) apparatus and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The crystallinity of the as-synthesized products was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D-8 advanced diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and using Cu Kα as the irradiation source (λ = 1.54178 Å). The chemical states and compositions of the samples were characterized using a PHI-5000 VersaProbe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray as radiation. Raman spectra were measured using a Horiba JYLabRAM Raman spectrometer (473 nm excitation wavelength). The optical properties of the samples were evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-2600; Shimadzu Corp., Japan) in the diffuse reflectance mode. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ-2C analyzer to measure the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area.
Photocatalytic measurement
The N2 photo-fixation experiments were carried out in a 250 mL quartz reactor, using a 300 W xenon lamp (without a cutoff filter) as the light source. Typically, 30 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed in 60 mL of ultrapure water and transferred into the reactor. The reactor was equipped with a water circulation system in the outer jacket to ensure that the reaction was conducted at 25 °C. High-purity N2 was bubbled into the reactor for 60 min under dark conditions to saturate the suspension with N2. Then, the reaction was performed under light irradiation for 60 min with continuous bubbling of N2. Subsequently, 5 mL of the suspension was taken out every 20 min and then centrifuged for 2 min at 9500 rpm to remove the photocatalyst completely. The concentrations of ammonia and possible hydrazine hydrate by-product were measured using the Nessler's reagent spectrophotometry method35 and the Watt–Chrisp (para-dimethylamino-benzaldehyde) method36 with a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Visible spectrometer, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on a CHI-760E electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode cell at room temperature. The platinum plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. To make the working electrode, 2 mg of the sample was dispersed in a mixture of 950 μL of ethanol and 50 μL of 5% Nafion solution, and then uniformly coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GC, ALS Co., Japan) and dried naturally. Ultrapure water was used as an electrolyte solution. The EIS measurements were conducted both under dark conditions and under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation, respectively.
Results and discussion
The detailed synthesis steps for preparing Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions are described in the Experimental section. Briefly, MoO3 nanorods were firstly prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. Then, the MoO3 nanorods were refluxed in the aqueous solution of Bi(NO3)3 at 120 °C for 4 h to produce Bi2MoO6 nanorods. Finally, OV-BiOBr nanosheets were in situ grown on the Bi2MoO6 nanorods through a solvothermal method to produce Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions. The morphological features of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1a–c, the SEM and TEM images reveal that the as-synthesized Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions are composed of hierarchical Bi2MoO6 nanorods (about 400–600 nm in diameter) grafted with plenty of in situ grown ultrathin OV-BiOBr nanosheets (about 10–20 nm in thickness). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was further used to investigate the microstructures of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions. Fig. 1d and e reveal the presence of both Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr in the hierarchical heterostructure. The lattice fringes of 0.32 nm and 0.28 nm correspond to the (131) plane of Bi2MoO6 and the (110) plane of BiOBr, respectively. As control samples, pristine MoO3 nanorods, n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods and p-type OV-BiOBr nanosheets were also prepared, as detailed in the Experimental section. As the precursor for synthesizing Bi2MoO6 nanorods, MoO3 nanorods have a smooth surface with a length of 3–5 μm and a width of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1f). Fig. 1g and h show that the pristine Bi2MoO6 nanorods exhibit rough surfaces decorated with numerous nanoparticles. Without the addition of Bi2MoO6 nanorods, pristine OV-BiOBr nanosheets were also prepared, which show the morphology of densely assembled ultrathin platelet-like structures, as illustrated in Fig. 1i.

The compositions and crystalline features of the as-synthesized nanostructures were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. EDX elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 2a) demonstrates the presence and uniform distribution of Bi, Mo, O and Br elements in the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 2b, the XRD peaks of the heterostructures can be well assigned to the peaks of Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no. 21-0102) and BiOBr (JCPDS no. 09-0393). Raman spectra shown in Fig. 2c were further employed to investigate the chemical composition of the as-synthesized products. The Raman vibrations of Bi2MoO6 at 700–900 cm−1 were assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the MoO6 octahedra in Bi2MoO6.37,38 For OV-BiOBr nanosheets, the distinguished Raman peaks located at 50–170 cm−1 corresponded to different Bi–Br stretching vibrations of external A1g, internal A1g, and E1g internal modes.39 The Raman spectrum of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions simultaneously exhibit the characteristic peaks of Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr, indicating the presence of Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr in the heterostructure.

To investigate the chemical states of the elements in Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) reveals the coexistence of Bi, Mo, O and Br elements, consistent with the above EDX results. The high-resolution XPS spectra of each element were deconvoluted into different peaks. Two strong peaks at the Bi 4f region (Fig. 2e) located at 158.6 and 164.0 eV can be assigned to Bi4f7/2 and Bi4f5/2, confirming the presence of Bi3+ species.40 Notably, the other two weak peaks at 157.8 and 163.5 eV indicate the existence of low-valence Bi species.40 As presented in Fig. 2f, the high-resolution XPS spectrum at the Mo 3d region shows two characteristic peaks at 231.5 and 234.7 eV, corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively.41 The peaks located at 67.35 and 68.35 eV (Fig. 2g) are attributed to Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2.27 As shown in Fig. 2h, the four energy bands of the O 1s XPS spectrum located at 529.5, 530.7, 531.9, and 533.0 eV are assigned to the lattice oxygen of BiOBr (Bi–O), the lattice oxygen of Bi2MoO6 (Mo–O), oxygen atoms near the oxygen vacancies and adsorbed oxygen, respectively.27,41,42
The representative N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the samples are presented in Fig. 3a–c. Compared to Bi2MoO6 nanorods and BiOBr nanosheets, the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions possess higher specific surface area, which can provide more photocatalytic active sites. Room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed to determine the presence of oxygen vacancies. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions display an EPR signal at g = 2.003, assignable to the electrons trapped by the oxygen vacancies.26,27 In contrast, pristine Bi2MoO6 nanorods show no obvious EPR signal, indicating the absence of oxygen vacancies in the Bi2MoO6 nanorods. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was also employed to study the optical properties of the samples. The absorption threshold of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions is slightly red-shifted to 485 nm compared to Bi2MoO6 (481 nm) and OV-BiOBr (427 nm), enabling relatively broad visible light response and better light utilization of the heterostructure (Fig. 3e). The Tauc plots (i.e., (Ahν)nvs. hν plots, where n is 2 for the direct bandgap semiconductor (Bi2MoO6) or 1/2 for the indirect bandgap semiconductor (OV-BiOBr)) reveal that the bandgaps of Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr are 2.54 eV and 2.75 eV, respectively (Fig. 3f). According to the valence band XPS spectra (Fig. 3g), the valence band maximum (VBM) levels of Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr are calculated to be 2.03 eV and 2.91 eV, respectively. Therefore, the conduction band minimum (CBM) energies of Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr are calculated to be −0.51 eV and 0.16 eV, respectively. The band alignment of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions is beneficial for the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. To investigate the charge transfer properties and interfacial reaction resistances of the samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted under light irradiation and dark conditions, as presented in Fig. 3h and i. Compared with pristine Bi2MoO6 nanorods and OV-BiOBr nanosheets, the Nyquist plot of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions shows smaller radii under both the conditions, indicating that this architecture can promote the interfacial charge transfer and reduce the interfacial reaction resistance. Moreover, the radius under light irradiation is smaller than that under dark conditions, suggesting that more carriers have been produced by the heterostructure owing to the light excitation.

To determine the role of the p–n heterostructure and oxygen vacancies in photocatalysis, solar-driven N2 fixation tests were performed in pure water under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp without any cocatalysts or sacrificial reagents. The average ammonia generation rate of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions is found to be ∼90.7 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 30 times higher than that of pristine Bi2MoO6 nanorods (3.0 μmol g−1 h−1) and 3 times higher than that of OV-BiOBr nanosheets (31.2 μmol g−1 h−1), revealing the greatly increased photocatalytic N2 fixation activity of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions (Fig. 4a). Besides, the ammonia production of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions under visible-light irradiation (a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter) was also evaluated. As presented in Fig. 4c, the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions show an average ammonia yield rate of 81.0 μmol g−1 h−1 in ultrapure water under visible light, indicating that this photocatalyst has good light utilization and N2 fixation activity in the range of visible light. The control experiments (under dark conditions, in an Ar atmosphere, or without photocatalysts) did not show the generation of ammonia, confirming that ammonia was formed by N2 reduction over Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions under light irradiation. In addition, the control experiment of photocatalytic N2 fixation over Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions in acetonitrile (CH3CN) instead of H2O did not show the generation of ammonia, demonstrating the key effect of H2O as the proton source for ammonia photosynthesis. Moreover, in order to eliminate the interference of CTAB, the photocatalytic N2 fixation reaction in the aqueous solution of CTAB (0.01 mol L−1) under an Ar gas flow and without a N2 gas flow has been conducted. As shown in Fig. 4c, there was almost no ammonia detected after testing for one hour, indicating that the residual CTAB on photocatalysts has no contribution to the product yield on the ammonia photosynthesis, further confirming that the N atoms of the generated ammonia originate from N2. Notably, no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic activity was observed after continuously testing for 6 h, indicating the good stability of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions (Fig. 4b). Another possible product of hydrazine hydrate over the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions under full-spectrum Xe lamp illumination in a N2 atmosphere was also detected according to the Watt–Chrisp method.36 As shown in Fig. 4d, compared with the standard samples of hydrazine hydrate solutions with various concentrations, it can be confirmed that there is no hydrazine hydrate product generated by the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions after N2 photofixation testing, indicating good selectivity for N2 fixation to ammonia. The SEM image of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions after the long-term test (Fig. 4e) shows almost no morphological change, further demonstrating good structural integrity.

(f) The proposed reaction mechanism of photocatalytic N2 fixation over Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions. 
Based on the above experimental results and analysis, the possible mechanism of photocatalytic N2 fixation on Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 4f. Under light irradiation, both Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr can generate electron–hole pairs. Due to the type II alignment between n-type Bi2MoO6 and p-type OV-BiOBr, the electrons generated from the CB of Bi2MoO6 transfer into the CB of OV-BiOBr, and the holes formed in the VB of OV-BiOBr transfer into the VB of Bi2MoO6. The electrons moved in the CB of the OV-BiOBr are further trapped by the oxygen vacancies of OV-BiOBr and then reduce nitrogen to ammonia. Meanwhile, the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 is above the VB of Bi2MoO6; therefore, the photo-oxidation reaction of H2O to O2 is initiated by the holes from the VB of Bi2MoO6. The greatly improved photocatalytic performance of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunctions is mainly attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, the bandgap alignment of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterostructure enhances the light absorption ability compared to pristine Bi2MoO6 nanorods and OV-BiOBr nanosheets. Secondly, the formation of p–n junctions between Bi2MoO6 and OV-BiOBr promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Thirdly, the presence of oxygen vacancies that served as electron traps can effectively inhibit the electron–hole pair recombination and also facilitate the adsorption and activation of the inert N2 molecules, providing more active sites for the photocatalytic N2 fixation reaction. Briefly, the reasonable design and synergistic effect of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterostructure ensure enhanced light absorption, promote the photo-excited charge separation, and provide abundant active sites for N2 fixation, thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an effective Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunction photocatalyst for photo-driven N2 conversion to NH3 under ambient conditions. The cooperation of Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr p–n heterojunctions and oxygen vacancies significantly facilitated electron–hole pair separation and contributed to the adsorption and activation of inert N2 molecules, thus enabling the artificial photocatalytic N2 fixation in ultrapure water without the need for any noble co-catalyst or sacrificial reagent. We suggest that this work may provide a promising strategy to rationally design advanced photocatalysts for highly efficient artificial N2 fixation.
