The crystalline structures and morphologies of both the precursor and the final product were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We also examined the photovoltaic performances of our samples by assembling them in photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The TiO2 microspheres sample with the tube-in-tube nanostructure shows a 213% and 269% increase in short current and conversion efficiency compared to that of TiO2 nanorods microspheres. The most interesting result in this study is that, even under the conditions with less dye adsorption (ca. 20% less), an optimized photoanode containing our TiO2 sample showed an energy-conversion efficiency of 7.57%, higher than the value (6.50%) of the photoanode containing solely anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. We concluded that the unique micro and nanostructure helps to increase the light harvesting and, thus, improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.IntroductionOne-dimensional (1D) titania (TiO2) nanostructures, such as nanotubes, nanowires, and nanobelts, have received a lot of research interest recently due to their unique properties, e.g. high specific surface areas, high resistance to light and/or chemical corrosion, and fast electron transportation.1,2 Thus, 1D TiO2 nanomaterials have been widely used in different areas, for instance, as sensors,3–5 as photocatalysts,6,7 as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),8–11 in drug delivery12 and in water purification.13,14 Among these 1D TiO2 nanostructures, we are particularly interested in TiO2 nanotubes, which have a large internal surface area and pathways for efficient charge and electron transportation along the growth direction of the nanotubes.15–17 In 1996, Hoyer reported the first example of TiO2 nanotubes by using the electrochemical deposition of TiO2 in a poly(methyl methacrylate) mold, followed by the dissolution of the polymer.18 From then on, several methods have been developed for the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes, including sol–gel,19 electrochemical anodic oxidation,16,20–22 hydrothermal treatment23,24 and surfactant templating approaches.25 The electrochemical anodic oxidation and surfactant templating approaches are popular, however, a heating treatment is usually required to remove the organic templates and improve the crystallinity of TiO2. Such an annealing process may cause the collapse of the tubular structure. As a result, it is important to develop a novel method for the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes without destroying the tubular structure.In 2010, our group reported the first example of using a simple anisotropic corrosion route to prepare a 1D TiO2 nanotubes array from their 1D nanorods precursor.26 The obtained 1D TiO2 nanotubes possess V-shaped inner structures. Previous studies from other research groups on silicon-based solar cells show that silicon solar cells with V-shaped structures have high light absorbance, low reflectance and low transmittance.27–30 Recently, Yang et al.31 reported silicon nanowires with a new type of nano-V-shaped light trapping structure, while some other groups reported the famous black silicon,32–34 which is constructed by many wedge silicon nanorods creating V-shaped light trapping spaces between the neighbouring silicon nanorods. All these examples showed a consistent result that silicon with a V-shaped structure has a much higher light absorbance, resulting in a higher photon to current conversion efficiency. Based on these examples, we anticipate that the microsphere assembly of 1-D TiO2 nanotubes with V-shaped inner structures should show promising performance in DSSCs application.In this paper, we report the extension of our anisotropic corrosion approach for the synthesis of TiO2 flower-like microspheres composed of V-shaped nanotubes with diameter of ca. 400 nm, which were obtained by the anisotropic chemical etching of a TiO2 nanorods precursor. Interestingly, we observed that the as prepared TiO2 nanotubes contain many tiny nanotubes with diameters in the order of 100 nm. To our best knowledge, this is the first example of TiO2 with tube-in-tube structures. The most striking feature of our sample is the presence of two different V-shaped spaces, i.e., one is the micro-V-shaped space created by neighboring nanotubes, with sizes from several hundred nanometers to several microns, and the other one is the nano-V-shaped space inside an individual nanotube with the size of tens of nanometers. We then assembled the TiO2 flower-like microspheres in DSSCs and measured the photovoltaic properties of the device. The DSSCs device based on our sample showed a 269% increase of the overall energy conversion efficiency, compared to the DSSCs device based on the TiO2 nanorods precursor with a similar flower-like microspherical morphology. In the end, we designed a sandwiched photoanode containing our TiO2 flower-like microspheres and achieved a photon to current conversion efficiency of 7.57%.ExperimentsMethodsAll reagents were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., LTD and used as received. In a typical preparation of the flower-like TiO2 nanorods precursor, 1 mL of TiCl4 was added dropwise into 20 mL of deionized water at 4 °C. Ten minutes later, the solution was transferred to 20 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5%–38% by weight) in an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After stirring for five minutes, the autoclave was placed in an oven at 150 °C–180 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the as-formed white precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol, and finally dried at 80 °C in air for 1 h. In this stage, we received the flower-like TiO2 nanorods precursor. In the second stage, the product obtained in the first stage was treated by acid aqueous solutions (mixture of distilled water and concentrated hydrochloric acid with volume ratio of 1:1) at 423 K for 10 h. The sample was collected and washed with distilled water three times followed by drying in air at 80 °C. In the end, we obtained flower-like TiO2 nanotubes.CharacterizationThe crystalline structure of the sample was investigated by a Bruker-D8 Avance X-ray diffractometer, with graphite monochromatized high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at the operation voltage of 40 KV and current of 40 mA. XRD patterns were recorded from 10° to 80° (2θ) with a scanning step of 0.05° at a scanning rate of 2° min−1. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a FEI Quanta-200 instrument. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) pictures were taken on a HITACHI S-4800 FESEM instrument. HRTEM images were taken via a JEOL JEM-2010UHR instrument at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.DSSCs assemblageFor the preparation of films, 0.4 g of powder of the flower-like TiO2 nanotubes was mixed with a 2 mL mixture of water and ethanol (1:1, vol. ratio) and 0.4 mL of acetylacetone (ACAC) by grinding. 0.4 mL of polyoxyethylene (10) octylphenyl ether (Triton x-100) was then added to the mixture in order to facilitate the spread of the paste on the fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass (F: SnO2, 14 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) substrate. The substrate was pre-washed by nitric acid, 2-propanol and deionized water. The coating of the TiO2 paste onto the FTO substrate was done via the doctor blade method.35 The resulting film was subsequently annealed at 450 °C for 30 min in air. After cooling down to room temperature, the TiO2 electrode was then impregnated with a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by a thermal annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. When cooling back to 80 °C, the electrode was immediately immersed in 0.3 mM dye solution (dye: N-719, solvent: t-butanol and acetonitrile mixture with volume ratio of 1:1) for 24 h to finish the dye absorption. A commercially available Pt-coated FTO substrate (Dalian HeptaChroma. SolarTech. Co., China) was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in the mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio of 85:15) was injected into the space between the anode and the cathode by using a vacuum back-filled method.In order to prepare a photoanode with a sandwiched structure, the flower-like TiO2 nanotube sample was pretreated by ethyl cellulose in ethanol solution. The mixture was then ground in an agate mortar at room temperature for 30 min, allowing the ethanol to evaporate. The final paste contained 18 wt% TiO2, 9 wt% ethyl cellulose, and 73 wt% terpineol. An anatase TiO2 nanoparticles paste was prepared in a similar way. The paste was screen-printed onto the FTO glasses layer by layer, followed by the sintering process and the dye adsorption process as described in the previous paragraph.Photovoltaic measurementCurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the sample were measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel 94023A-450W) giving light with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated by a certified reference Si solar cell with intensity of 100 mW cm−2 before use. A black mask with a window area of 0.16 cm2 was applied on the TiO2 film side to get rid of the redundant light. The adsorbed amounts of N719 dye were determined by desorbing the dye from the titania surface in a mixed solution of 0.1 M NaOH in water and ethanol (volume ratio of 1:1), and the concentration of desorbed dye was analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.Results and discussionCharacterization of materialsIn the experimental section, we described two stages of hydrothermal preparation of the TiO2 materials. In this section, we start with describing the characterization of the product obtained in the first stage. In Fig. S1 in ESI† we present the SEM images and the XRD pattern of the product. An overview of the sample is shown in an SEM image in Fig. S1A,† where we can see many flower-like clusters with spherical shape and the diameters in the order of 10 μm. A magnified SEM image of an individual microsphere is presented in Fig. S1B,† while a further magnified SEM image showing the surface of the microsphere is presented in Fig. S1C.† From Fig. S1B and S1C,† one sees that the microsphere is constructed by many rod-like building blocks, which have random orientations on the surface of the microsphere. These rod-like building blocks have diameters of several hundred nanometers and lengths of several microns. The crystalline structure of this sample was investigated by XRD. We present the XRD pattern of this sample in Fig. S1D,† from which one can see that all diffraction peaks can be assigned to the tetragonal rutile TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21–1276, a = b = 4.59 Å, c = 2.96 Å). Due to the structure of this TiO2 sample, we refer to this sample as TiO2 microsphere (R). In the second stage of preparation, we treated the TiO2 microsphere (R) sample obtained in the first stage by hydrochloric acid solution at 423 K for 10 h, followed by washing with distilled water three times and drying in air at 80 °C. The morphology and structure of the product were investigated by FESEM. A FESEM image showing an overview of the sample is presented in Fig. 1A, where one sees the flower-like clusters of cylindrical objects that resemble the shape of their precursor as shown in Fig. S1A.† These clusters in Fig. 1A are also nearly spherical in shape and have diameters in the order of 10 μm. In Fig. 1B we present a magnified FESEM image of an individual microsphere. From Fig. 1B, we can see that the building blocks for the microsphere are tube-like structures with lengths of several microns and diameters of ca. 400 nm. The sidewalls of these building blocks are as smooth as their precursor. Different from their precursor in Fig. S1B and S1C,† we can also see that most of these rods in Fig. 1B have non-flat and hollow ends, thus we referred to them as nanotubes. The random distribution of these nanotubes in the microsphere creates V-shaped spaces of different sizes. The distances between these neighboring nanotubes are from several hundred nanometers to several microns, matching the wavelength of sunlight. We expect that such a micro-V-shaped structure can effectively trap incident light with a certain wavelength via multiple reflections between the walls of the adjacent nanotubes. Fig. 1  (A) A FESEM image showing an overview of microspheres of TiO2 nanotubes. (B) A FESEM image of an individual microsphere of TiO2 nanotubes. (C) A magnified FESEM image showing the open end of a TiO2 tubular building block, the lower left is a cartoon mimicking the tube-in-tube nanostructure of the nanotube, and dashed blue lines emphasize the tubular nature of the wall of the nanotube. (D) XRD patterns of the TiO2 sample. In Fig. 1C, we present a magnified FESEM image of the open end of a TiO2 tubular building block for the microsphere. From Fig. 1C, one sees that the cross-section of the tube is irregular but nearly rectangular, and clearly see the non-flat tip and rough inner surface of the nanotube. Intriguingly, we notice that the wall of the nanotube seems to possess tubular structures, as indicated by the dashed blue lines in Fig. 1C. We also present more FESEM images emphasizing such tubular structures in Fig. S2 in ESI.† These smaller tubes have diameters in the order of 100 nm and construct the wall of the larger tubes. In order to better depict this tube-in-tube structure, we present a cartoon mimicking this structure in the lower left of Fig. 1C. This is the first example of TiO2 with tube-in-tube structures. We also confirmed the crystalline structure of this TiO2 sample by XRD. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1D shows the pure rutile phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21–1276, a = b = 4.59 Å, c = 2.96 Å) of the sample. By comparing the structures and morphologies of the sample obtained in the first stage (Fig. S1†) with the one obtained in the second stage (Fig. 1), we can see that the main characteristics of rutile phase and the flower-like microspheres are preserved during the second hydrothermal treatment. The main difference is the structure of the cylindrical building blocks of the microspheres. In the TiO2 microsphere (R) sample, the building blocks are nanorods. After being treated with hydrochloric acid solution, these nanorods were corroded to form nanotubes. The corrosion took place preferentially along the growth direction of the TiO2 nanorods in the first stage of hydrothermal preparation.26 Due to the characteristics of the tubular structures, we refer to the second sample as TiO2 microsphere (T).In order to have a better understanding of the tubular structures of the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample, we further characterized this sample by TEM. TEM images with different magnifications for different areas of the nanotubes are presented in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2A, we can measure the width of a single tube to be ca. 400 nm. The regions in dashed blue circles show the non-flat tip of the nanotube. More TEM images showing the V-shaped space inside the nanotube are presented in Fig. S3 in ESI.† A magnified TEM image of the tip of the nanotube is shown in Fig. 2B, where one can see the irregular shape of the tip (as shown in the dashed blue circles). We can also notice that the wall of the tube is constructed by many rod-like entities with diameters in the order of 10 nm. We emphasize one of the rods using a dashed red circle in Fig. 2B. Another magnified TEM image of the tip is presented in Fig. 2C, where one sees a smaller tubular structure (in a dashed blue circle), which seems to be created by small rods. This is similar to what can be observed in the FESEM images in Fig. 1. From Fig. 2C, we can also observe the V-shaped space generated by the adjacent TiO2 nanotubes as marked by blue dot lines. In Fig. 2D, we present a high-resolution TEM image of a small TiO2 nanorod, from which we can measure the lattice distance. The as-calculated 0.325 nm corresponds to the (110) lattice distance of rutile TiO2, the lattice planes of [110] and [001] are also indicated in Fig. 2D. Fig. 2  (A–C) TEM images of an individual nanotube of the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample with different magnifications. (D) HRTEM image of the TiO2 nanotube ZA sample, showing the lattice structures of rutile phase TiO2. Formation mechanismThe formation mechanism of the TiO2 microsphere (R) can be explained as follows. The hydrolysis of TiCl4 in the HCl aqueous solution at high temperature induced the preferential formation of the growth units of Ti(IV) complex ions, which depends critically on the acidity and ligand in solution.36 In the presence of supersaturated titanium sources, the Ti(IV) complex was then converted to TiO2. The formation of TiO2 might come up according to the following reactions: TiCl4 + HCl + H2O → Ti(IV) complex(1) 2 Ti(IV) complex ↔ TiO2(2)The Cl− ion in the hydrothermal solution is known to restrict the growth of the (110) facet of rutile TiO2 while promoting the growth along the [001] direction, forming TiO2 nanorods that are tetragonal in shape and square top facets. The TiO2 nanorods in the [001] direction, because the (001) facet is more reactive than the others (e.g. (110), (100) and (101) facets).37 The existence of many small particles on the top of the nanorods confirmed the growth process.In our previous studies,26 we proved that the active crystalline (001) facet preferentially dissolves in the conditions of TiO2 dissolution. When TiO2 nanorods were treated with hydrochloric acid during the hydrothermal process, the HCl preferentially etched the TiO2 nanorods in the [001] direction because the (001) facet is far more reactive than the crystalline facet of the side wall, i.e. the dissolution rate along the long-axis direction is faster than the side wall direction. The faster corrosion along the (001) facet decides the formation of a tube structure. The decreasing concentration gradient of HCl along the corrosion direction in the confined space of the TiO2 nanotube and the increased exposure to corrosion of the previously eroded side wall induce the formation of V-shaped morphology.Photovoltaic propertiesIn this section, we describe the experiments investigating the photovoltaic properties of the two TiO2 samples that we have prepared. Both TiO2 microsphere (R) and TiO2 microsphere (T) samples were assembled in DSSCs. We expected the TiO2 material with the special tubular structure and morphology to display high light trapping efficiency, thus showing good performance in DSSCs application. As illustrated in Scheme 1, there is a V-shaped space inside an individual nanotube (scheme 1B). The V-shaped tubular structures can essentially trap incident light through multiple reflections (Scheme 1C).27,30–32 In another aspect, the tubular structure of the TiO2 endows the sample with higher surface area than the nanorod precursor (TiO2 nanorod is 1.93 m2 g−1, TiO2 nanotube is 7.05 m2 g−1), which should increase the absorption amount of dye molecules. In Table 1, we show the values of the dye loading on each TiO2 sample with identical film thickness, i.e., a value of 1.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the TiO2 microsphere (R) sample and a value of 2.8 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample.

A commercially available Pt-coated FTO substrate was used as the counter electrode. We used a constant power density of 100 mW cm−2 of the incident light. In Fig. 3A, we present the characteristic photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs based on our two TiO2 samples. The photoanode based on the TiO2 microsphere (R) sample exhibits a short-circuit current density Jsc = 2.70 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage Voc = 0.78 V, and a fill factor FF = 0.56, leading to an overall energy- conversion efficiency η =1.06%. Meanwhile, the photoanode based on the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample displays a short-circuit current density Jsc = 8.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage Voc = 0.81 V, and a fill factor FF = 0.57, leading to an overall energy-conversion efficiency η = 3.91%. All these values are listed in Table 1 for comparison. We can see that the photoanode based on the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample showed a 213% and 269% increase in Jsc and η, respectively, compared to the photoanode based on the TiO2 microsphere (R) sample. Fig. 3  (A) I–V characteristics curves of DSSC assembled by using (a) TiO2 nanorod microsphere (R) and (b) TiO2 nanotube microsphere (T); the insets are the corresponding SEM images; (B) The optical transmission spectra of two photoanodes, the inset is their diffuse reflectance spectra. From Fig. 3A and Table 1, we can see the improved performance of the DSSCs based on our TiO2 microsphere (T) sample. However, we are not satisfied by the relatively low energy-conversion efficiency η = 3.91%. One important reason is the low loading amount of dye on rutile TiO2 materials. In Fig. 3B, the transmittance of the TiO2 microsphere (T) is lower than that of the TiO2 microsphere (R). It suggested that the TiO2 microsphere (T) has a higher light-trapping ability than that of TiO2 microsphere (R), which may result in a remarkable increase of the light-harvesting in DSSC.38,39 So, we conclude that the TiO2 nanotube microsphere (T) has a higher light-trapping effect than that of the TiO2 nanorod microsphere (R). From the inset of Fig. 3, we can see these two samples almost have a similar high diffuse reflectance. It indicated that the high light-scattering ability, which can effectively extend the optical path in the TiO2 film and improved the performance of DSSCs based on the TiO2 microsphere (T). In order to further improve the performance of the DSSCs device based on our sample, we added another type of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles to create a sandwich structure of several layers of TiO2 materials. The anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared via a traditional method, as reported previously.40,41 For the photoanode with the sandwich structure, we used a screen printing method39,42 to coat two layers of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles first, followed by two layers of our rutile TiO2 microsphere (T) sample, and finally another two layers of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. In comparison, we prepared another photoanode containing six layers of the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and tested the performance of the corresponding DSSC in parallel, the thickness of these two types of photoanodes is about ~12 μm. We refer to the DSSC using the pure anatase TiO2 nanoparticles photoanode as DSSC-1 and the one with sandwiched photoanode as DSSC-2.In Fig. 4A, we present the characteristic photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of DSSC-1 and DSSC-2. Compared to DSSC-1, the DSSC-2 exhibited a higher short-circuit current density (13.7 vs. 12.2 mA cm−2) and a higher open-circuit photovoltage (0.76 vs. 0.73 V). Both of the DSSCs have the same fill factor value FF = 0.73. The DSSC-2 possessed an overall energy-conversion efficiency of η = 7.57%, which is higher than the value of DSSC-1 (η = 6.50%). However, we were surprised by the values of dye adsorption for each photoanode. For DSSC-1, we obtained a dye adsorption amount of 20.8 × 10−8 mol cm−2, while for DSSC-2, with a higher energy-conversion efficiency, we obtained a smaller value (16.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2) of dye adsorption amount. Thus, we conjecture that the improvement of energy-conversion efficiency was due to the enhancement of effective light trapping in our sample with tube-in-tube structures. Fig. 4  (A) Characteristic photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of dye-sensitized solar cells assembled by using the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles photoanode (DSSC-1) and the sandwiched photoanode (DSSC-2). (B) The optical transmission spectra of the two naked photoanodes, the inset is their diffuse reflectance spectra. We confirmed our postulation by measuring the diffusion reflectance spectra and optical transmission spectra of the two photoanodes. From the transmittance spectra in Fig. 4B, the sandwiched electrode has a lower transmittance than that of anatase electrode. This suggested a superior light-trapping ability and a remarkable increase of light-harvesting in DSSC-2. In the inset of Fig. 4B, the sandwiched photoanode of DSSC-2 has a higher diffuse reflectance than that of the anatase photoanode of DSSC-1. The higher diffuse reflectance represents an increased light-scattering ability. The reflection and refraction between nanotubes and multi-reflection within the V-shaped cavity can greatly increase the multi-utilization of light. So, the enhancement of the light-scattering ability can effectively extend the optical path in the TiO2 film, which is beneficial for improving the light-harvesting efficiency, thus promoting photogenerated electrons and achieving a better photovoltaic performance.43,44ConclusionTo conclude, we describe a two-step hydrothermal preparation for flower-like TiO2 microspheres with a tube-in-tube structure. Inside the TiO2 microsphere, there are two types of V-shaped spaces, one is the micro-V-shaped space created by adjacent nanotubes and the other one is the nano-V-shaped inside the nanotube. The unique feature of these nanotubes is that their walls are constructed by smaller nanotubes with a diameter of around 100 nm. We propose an anisotropic etching mechanism to explain the formation of the TiO2 microspheres with tube-in-tube structures. The TiO2 microspheres sample with the tube-in-tube structure exhibited a 213% and 269% increase in the short current and conversion efficiency, respectively, compared to that of the TiO2 nanorods microspheres. An optimized photoanode containing our TiO2 sample together with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles showed an energy-conversion efficiency of 7.57%. We attributed such improvement to the special dual V-shaped structures of the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample, which improve the light harvesting through multiple reflection and refraction. Due to this special structure, our TiO2 microsphere (T) sample shows a great potential for DSSC application. We envisage that the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC can be further improved by increasing the dye loading on the TiO2 microsphere (T) sample.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1162108, No. 51272104); the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20131409); the Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Province Department of Education (No.11KJA150002; No.10KJB150006); the Science & Technology Pillar Program of Jiangsu Province (No. BE2009679), and the Financial Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering.Notes and referencesS.
