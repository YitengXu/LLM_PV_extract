Soc., Faraday Trans. 1, 1984, 80, 1029-1038Differential pulse voltammetry as an in situ monitoring technique for the thermal-decomposition kinetics of nitrate melts(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Francesco Palmisano, Luigia Sabbatini and Pier Giorgio ZamboninAbstractDifferential pulse voltammetry has been used to detect NO–2 at trace level in fused nitrates. A detection limit of 10 ppb was estimated. The technique was employed for studying the thermal-decomposition kinetics of molten nitrates under controlled experimental conditions. A pseudo-zero-order kinetic process was found, characterized by a kinetic constant of 7.6 × 10–11 mol kg–1 s–1 at 538 K and by an apparent activation energy of 39 ± 2 kJ mol–1 in the temperature range 510–620 K.The suggested reaction mechanism is 2 NO–3⇌ NO–3+ NO–*3 NO–*3→ NO–2+½O2 where the first reaction seems to represent an equilibrium prior to the second rate-determining reaction.The equilibrium constant and the value of ΔH for the reaction NO–3= NO–2+½O2 were also calculated from equilibrium data and compared with previous literature parameters estimated by indirect or approximate methods.
