CQDs play dual roles on the improved photocatalytic activity of CQDs/P25. Under UV-Vis light irradiation CQDs act as an electron reservoir to improve the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs of P25.

Introduction
Solar photocatalytic H2 production through water splitting with semiconductor photocatalysts is a fascinating scientific and technological challenge in the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.1 Among photocatalysts, TiO2 is one of the most promising catalysts because of its relatively low cost, superior photocatalytic performance, long-term stability, and environmental friendliness. However, the UV light responsivity of TiO2 owing to its large 3.2 eV bandgap and the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes restrict the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. To solve this problem, many strategies have been developed, such as loading noble metals,2–9 doping with metal and nonmetal elements,8–16 sensitization with organic dyes,9,17 coupling with narrow bandgap semiconductors,9,16,18–20 and so on. Recently, the coupling of TiO2 with metal-free carbonaceous materials, such as C60,21,22 carbon nanotubes,23–25 and graphene8,26–29 for efficient photocatalysis has attracted much attention. However, developing a more facile and low cost strategy to TiO2-based photocatalysts with visible light response for efficient H2 production still remains a challenge.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), a novel class of nanocarbons, have been attracting increasing attention due to their unique properties, such as excellent up-converting and size dependent photoluminescence, robust chemical inertness, superior stability against photobleaching, high aqueous solubility, and low cytotoxicity,30 and have been successfully utilized in bioimaging,31,32 sensors33 and light-emitting devices.34,35 Very recently, CQDs have also been studied for catalytic applications. Kang et al. reported several CQDs/semiconductor composites prepared mainly by physical adsorption for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dye pollutants in the liquid or gas phase under visible and infrared light irradiation.36–40 The conjugated π structure of CQDs in these composites plays an important role for their improved photocatalytic activities, such as facilitating the adsorption of organic dyes.41,42 The strong chemical interaction between the CQDs and semiconductors should make the composites more stable and the charge transfer between them more efficient, leading to higher photocatalytic activity. Additionally, developing CQDs modified TiO2 composites for efficient photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous solution is still rare.
Herein, we developed a facile hydrothermal route to prepare the CQDs modified P25 TiO2 composites (CQDs/P25) via the newly formed chemical bond Ti–O–C with a “dyade” structure. The phase, morphologies, microstructures and optical properties were investigated in detail. The CQDs/P25 was then utilized for photocatalytic H2 production from methanol aqueous solution without loading any noble metal cocatalyst under UV-Vis and visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation, with a comparison to pure P25. A possible mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed based on the measurements of the transient photocurrent response, surface photovoltage, and hydroxyl radicals.
Experimental
Reagents
TiO2 (P25) was purchased from Shanghai Haiyi Scientific & Trading Co., Ltd. Terephthalic acid was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent CO., Ltd. Sodium hydroxide, methanol, and ethanol were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Plant (Beijing, China) and used as received without further purification. Distilled water was used during the experimental process.
Synthesis of the CQDs
The CQDs were synthesized by an alkali-assisted electrochemical method.39 Firstly, 0.4 g NaOH was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water. 20 mL ethanol was then added, followed by ultrasonic treatment for several min to yield a transparent solution. Subsequently, graphite rods 0.5 cm in diameter were placed into the solution as both the anode and cathode. Then, the CQDs were produced under 30 V. The raw CQDs solution was first treated with MgSO4, stirred for 20 min, and then stored for 24 h to remove the salts and water. Finally, the CQDs solution was separated with a dialysis bag (3500 Da) and the reddish solution was collected.
Synthesis of the CQDs/P25 composites
The CQDs/P25 composites were obtained by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 20 mL distilled water and 6 mL ethanol were mixed together, and then 0.4 g P25 and 4 mL CQDs (2 mg mL−1, dispersed in ethanol) were added. The mixture was kept stirring for 4 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous suspension. After that, the suspension was transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 140 °C for 4 h. The resulting CQDs/P25 composites were collected by centrifugation and then washed with distilled water three times, and finally dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight. To investigate the effect of the CQDs content on the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, the CQDs/P25 composites with different contents of CQDs (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 wt%) were prepared and labeled as CQDs/P25-x (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 wt%, respectively).
Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was performed on a Bruker DAVINCI D8 ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer GX spectrophotometer scanning from 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere scanning from 200–800 nm with BaSO4 as the reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe (Physical Electronics) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1846.6 eV) as the X-ray source. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions were obtained using a Quadrasorb SI MP apparatus at 77 K. Prior to the experiments, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 °C for 12 h. The total specific surface area of the samples was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Photoluminescence study was carried out on a Hitachi F4600 Luminescence Spectrometer.
Photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution
The reactions were conducted in a 60 mL quartz vessel with a rubber septum. The photocatalyst powders (50 mg) were dispersed in a 25 mL aqueous solution containing 6.25 mL methanol as the sacrificial agent. The suspension was dispersed by ultrasound treatment for 10 min, and then purged with N2 for 30 min to remove the O2 and was sealed with a rubber septum. The light source was a 500 W halogen lamp equipped with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ > 450 nm) (XPA-7 photochemical reactor, Nanjing Xujiang Machine-electronic Plant). The temperature of the suspension solution was maintained at room temperature by a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph (N2 carrier gas, molecular sieve 5 Å, TCD detector).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The transient photocurrent responses were measured in a quartz cell with a conventional three-electrode system: a Pt gauze as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and the as-prepared samples were coated on the ITO substrate as the working electrode. Specifically, the working electrodes were prepared by coating the slurry made of 0.25 g photocatalyst, 0.06 g polyethylene glycol (PEG20000) and 1.0 mL water onto ITO glass electrodes by the doctor blade method, and then calcining at 450 °C for 30 min. The thicknesses of all the photocatalyst coatings on the ITO electrodes were almost the same, about 8 μm. The electrolyte was 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Fig. S1†) equipped with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ > 450 nm).
Surface photovoltage measurements
The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements were performed according to a previous work.43 A sandwich structured electrode (ITO–sample–ITO) was employed.
˙OH-trapping experiment
20 mg CQDs/P25-1.5 wt% was suspended in 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 10 mM NaOH and 3 mM terephthalic acid. Before light irradiation, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min. Subsequently, 4 mL of the solution was removed every 2 min for UV-Vis irradiation and 10 min for visible light irradiation, and then centrifuged for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements.
Results and discussion
The HRTEM image of the CQDs in Fig. 1A reveals a spherical morphology, ∼4.6 nm in diameter with a lattice spacing of around 0.283 nm assigned to the graphitic carbon (JCPDS card no. 46-0943). After the coupling of the CQDs with P25, the resulting CQDs/P25 is yellow and the corresponding TEM image shows that its size is almost the same as that of pure P25, ranging from 20 to 30 nm (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the coupling of the CQDs with P25, an HRTEM image of the CQDs/P25 was recorded (Fig. 1C and S2†). As shown in Fig. 1C, the interplanar spacings of 0.149 and 0.350 nm agree well with the (213) and (101) plane of anatase TiO2, respectively (JCPDS card no. 21-1272), while the interplanar spacing of 0.169 nm is assigned to the (220) plane of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 21-1276), indicating the presence of P25, which is also consistent with the XRD result (Fig. S3†). The interplanar spacing of 0.283 nm assigned to the CQDs can also be observed in Fig. 1C, demonstrating the successful coupling of the CQDs with P25. Although no typical XRD peaks for carbon species can be found from the XRD spectrum of the CQDs/P25 (Fig. S3†), this is due to the low content of CQDs in the composites (≤2.5 wt%).18,28 FTIR spectra were also carried out to further characterize the formation of the CQDs/P25 (Fig. 1D). The characteristic absorption peaks of the CQDs at 2974, 2932, 1580 and 1400 cm−1 associated with the skeletal vibration of sp2 and sp3 C–H, CO and C–OH in curve c, indicate the existence of CQDs in the composites. The broad absorption band below 1000 cm−1 has a red shift and becomes wider compared with that for P25 (curve a), which is attributed to the combination of the Ti–O–Ti and Ti–O–C vibrations.26

To further illustrate the interaction of the CDQs with P25, XPS was performed on the CQDs/P25. The full-scale XPS spectrum (Fig. 2A) shows the existence of Ti, O, and C in the CQDs/P25. The deconvoluted C(1s) XPS spectrum of the CQDs/P25 is presented in Fig. 2B. The typical peaks at 284.9, 286.5, and 289.2 eV are attributed to the C–C (graphite), C–O and OC–O bonds, respectively, suggesting the presence of the CQDs in the CQDs/P25, which is well consistent with the HRTEM and FTIR results. The peaks at 530.1, 531.3 and 532.4 eV in the deconvoluted O(1s) XPS spectrum are assigned to the Ti–O, C–O and O–H bonds, respectively,44 further revealing the presence of the CQDs (Fig. 2C). The Ti(2p) XPS spectra of the CQDs/P25 and P25 were also collected (Fig. 2D). The peaks at 464.5 and 458.8 eV observed in the CQDs/P25 (Fig. 2D-a) for Ti(2p1/2) and Ti(2p3/2), respectively, are slightly shifted towards a higher binding energy compared with those in pure P25 (Fig. 2D-b). This suggests that the chemical environment of Ti in the CQDs/P25 has been changed due to the strong interaction between the P25 and CQDs and the formation of the Ti–O–C bond.44 Based on the above results it can be concluded that the coupling of CQDs with P25 is via the formation of the Ti–O–C bond.45,46

Photoabsorption is one of the key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 3, pure P25 has almost no absorption above 410 nm, while the CQDs/P25 composites show an obvious absorption in the visible light region ranging from 410 to 600 nm, and the absorption increases gradually with the increase of CQDs contents. Therefore, CQDs play a critical role in the enhanced visible light absorption of the CQDs/P25, which is expected to enhance its visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity (Fig. S4†).

The photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/P25 was evaluated by photocatalytic H2 production from methanol aqueous solution at room temperature under UV-Vis and visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4A, under UV-Vis light irradiation, pure P25 exhibits a relatively low photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (2.3 μmol h−1), probably due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. After the coupling of P25 with CQDs, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate increases gradually with the increase of CQDs content. The highest evolution rate (9.1 μmol h−1), ∼4 times higher than that of pure P25, was observed for the CQDs/P25-1.5 wt%. However, further increasing the contents of the CQDs results in the gradual decrease of H2 evolution rate, which is probably due to the opacity and light scattering of the CQDs decreasing the absorption of incident light, and the reduced catalytic active sites.28 The optimization experiment on the amount of CQDs/P25 shows that the optimal usage of photocatalyst for the highest H2 evolution rate is around 50–60 mg (Fig. S5†). The visible-light-driven (λ > 450 nm) photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of those samples was also tested (Fig. 4B). Pure P25 shows nearly no photocatalytic activity because it cannot be excited by visible light (λ > 450 nm) due to its wide band gap (>3.0 eV, can only be excited by the light λ < 413 nm). However, with the gradual loading of CQDs onto P25, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate increases gradually under visible light irradiation. The highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (0.5 μmol h−1) was reached for the CQDs/P25-2.0 wt%. It should be noted that in the pure water system without methanol under UV light irradiation CQDs/P25 also can generate H2, but the evolution rate is about an order of magnitude lower than that in methanol aqueous solution (Fig. S6†). Moreover, no H2 can be detected over the CQDs/P25 in pure water under visible light irradiation. These results reveal that methanol can scavenge the holes in P25 effectively to improve the H2 evolution rate under UV irradiation, and the holes photoinduced from CQDs under visible light irradiation can oxidize methanol but not OH− in pure water.

More importantly, our CQDs/P25 composites prepared by the hydrothermal method showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activities under UV-Vis and visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation compared with the CQDs/P25 composites prepared by the physical adsorption which have been repeatedly used for the photodegradation of organic dyes39 (Fig. S7†). This could originate from the strong chemical interaction between the CQDs and P25 via the newly formed Ti–O–C bond confirmed by the above XPS and FTIR spectra, which is in favor of the charge transfer between the CQDs and P25.
The stability of the CQDs/P25 was further investigated in order to demonstrate its applicability in photocatalysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of H2 yield over CQDs/P25-1.5 wt% is almost in proportion to the reaction time within 16 h, with a constant H2 evolution rate (∼8.3 μmol h−1), indicating that the stability of the CQDs/P25 is satisfactory, like P25 for further practical applications.
 Fig. 5  Time course of H2 yield over CQDs/P25-1.5 wt% (red squares) and P25 (black circles) from a methanol aqueous solution under halogen lamp irradiation. 
For better understanding of the improved photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/P25, the specific surface area of the P25 and CQDs/P25 composites was measured (Fig. S8†). Table S1† shows that their specific surface areas do not have any obvious differences, implying that the specific surface area should have no effect on the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.
The electrochemical experiments were then conducted to study the photoinduced charge-transfer behavior.
As shown in Fig. 6A, both P25 and CQDs/P25 show sensitive photocurrent responses during repeated on/off cycles of the UV-Vis irradiation, and the changing trend of the stable photocurrent density of CQDs/P25 is consistent with their photocatalytic H2 evolution activities. The notably enhanced photocurrent response of CQDs/P25 can be attributed to the coupling with CQDs which serve as the electron reservoir like frequently used cocatalyst Pt in photocatalytic H2 production to trap the photoinduced electrons from P25 and thus enhance the separation efficiency of electrons and holes.28

Likewise, under visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation, significantly improved photocurrent responses are also observed for the CQDs/P25 compared with P25 which shows nearly no photocurrent response (Fig. 6B), which is also consistent with their photocatalytic H2 evolution activities. This suggests that the CQDs play an important role in the improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic activities of the CQDs/P25. The π conjugated CQDs may act as a photosensitizer, like organic dyes, and the photoexcited electrons transfer from the CQDs to P25.
To get further information about the transport behaviors of the photoinduced charge carries, the SPV technique was employed. Fig. 7 shows that the SPV response bands of the pure P25 and CQDs/P25 are obtained in the range of 300–400 and 300–520 nm, respectively. In the UV response region (300–400 nm), the SPV response intensity of the CQDs/P25 is much stronger than that of P25, implying the higher separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carries in the CQDs/P25 due to the presence of the CQDs acting as electron reservoirs.43 The photoluminescence spectra of P25 and the CQDs/P25 in Fig. S9† show that the emission intensity of P25 decreases gradually with the increase of CQDs contents, revealing some electrons transfer from P25 to the CQDs, which is in agreement with the above SPV results.
 Fig. 7  SPV spectra of (a) P25 and (b) the CQDs/P25-1.5 wt%. 
Interestingly, besides a strong SPV response in the UV region, the CQDs/P25 also show an evident SPV response in the visible light region (400–520 nm), which is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption of the CQDs/P25. Under visible light irradiation, the π conjugated CQDs, like organic dyes, can be excited and then the photoexcited electrons transfer to P25, which causes the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs, resulting in the SPV response. This is in good agreement with the above transient photocurrent response measurement.
To further confirm the mechanism of the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity over the CQDs/P25, ˙OH in the photocatalytic reaction system was detected. ˙OH can be trapped by terephthalic acid (TA) to generate 2-hydroxy terephthalic acid (TAOH) which emits a strong fluorescence at around 426 nm.47–49 Therefore, the quantity of ˙OH in the system can be easily evaluated by monitoring the intensity of fluorescence. Fig. 8a shows that a significant fluorescence associated with TAOH is observed upon the UV-Vis light irradiation of the CQDs/P25-1.5 wt%. This implies that a large amount of ˙OH is generated due to the photoexcited holes from P25. Besides, a good linear relationship between the fluorescent intensity and irradiation time is observed, revealing a good stability of the CQDs/P25 during the photocatalytic reaction.47 However, nearly no fluorescence associated with TAOH is detected for the CQDs/P25 upon visible light irradiation (λ > 450 nm), indicating that no ˙OH is formed (Fig. 8b). It can thus be concluded that no “electron–holes” pairs are generated from P25 under visible light irradiation (λ > 450 nm), and the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production behavior of CQDs/P25 should be attributed to the photosensitization effect of CQDs.42,50 The π conjugated CQDs in the CQDs/P25 serve as a photosensitizer, like organic dyes, and sensitize P25 through the newly formed Ti–O–C bond between the CQDs and P25 already evidenced by the above FTIR and XPS measurements.

Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic H2 evolution over CQDs/P25 is proposed in Fig. 9. The CQDs in CQDs/P25 play dual important roles for the improved photocatalytic H2 production activity. Firstly, under UV light irradiation, CQDs serve as the electron reservoirs to trap photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of P25, which facilitates the efficient separation of electrons and holes, and thus the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Secondly, under visible light irradiation, the π conjugated CQDs act as a photosensitizer like organic dyes to sensitize P25 into a visible light responsive “dyade” structure, and donate the electrons to the conduction band of P25, leading to the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity.

Conclusions
In summary, CQDs/P25 composites with efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under UV-Vis and visible light irradiation have been successfully prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal strategy. Under UV-Vis light irradiation, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of CQDs/P25 is ∼4 times higher than that of pure P25. Differently from pure P25, CQDs/P25 also exhibited efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity. The measurements of the transient photocurrent response, SPV and hydroxyl radicals indicate that under UV-Vis light irradiation CQDs serve as electron reservoirs to trap the photoinduced electrons from excited P25 for the efficient separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and thus show improved photocatalytic activity; while under visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation, the CQDs act as a photosensitizer, like organic dyes, to sensitize P25 into a visible light responsive “dyade” structure, in which the photoinduced electrons transfer from excited CQDs to P25 and then react with protons for H2 production. Therefore, this work is expected to provide new possibilities for the rational design and preparation of CQDs modified metal oxide composites without noble metal loading for applications in solar fuel, solar cells, etc.
