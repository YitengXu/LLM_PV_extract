    , Accepted 2nd May 2021First published on 13th May 2021AbstractCharge transport properties of a P3HT:DIPBI bulk heterojunction solar cell are modelled by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on a morphology obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics. Different methods for calculating the hopping integrals entering the charge transfer rates are compared and calibrated for hole transport in amorphous P3HT. The influence of intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer on the total charge carrier mobility and hence the power conversion efficiency is investigated in detail. An analysis of the most probable pathways with low resistance for hole transport is performed, establishing a connection between charge mobility and morphology.
1 Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSC) have been developed as a light-weight and low-cost alternative to conventional photovoltaic devices.1–8 Commonly, they are composed of a donor polymer, e.g. poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)9–19 and a fullerene-based acceptor, e.g. PCBM.20,21 However, due to the limited chemical tunability of fullerenes, a number of non-fullerene acceptors,22–25 mostly perylene bisimide (PBI) derivatives,24,26–36 have been proposed leading to rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of donor–acceptor blends.3,37–50
Although a number of rational considerations enter the development of this type of solar cell, it is still hard to predict its precise morphology, which plays a crucial role in the photovoltaic performance.51–63 The morphology depends on a number of different factors such as the molecular weight of the donor and acceptor compounds,64–69 solvation effects,70,71 film processing,72,73 regioregularity,12,74 purity and mixing75,76 of donor and acceptor materials77 as well as post-treatment.78,79 Therefore, reliable theoretical predictions on the morphology of a particular blend depending on the fabrication protocol (e.g. annealing temperatures) and its influence on the device properties, such as charge mobility, would be extremely valuable. This presents a huge challenge to theoretical modelling, since it requires the combination of various methods designed for different time and length scales ranging from quantum mechanics on the molecular scale to Monte Carlo simulations on the morphological scale. Such a multiscale simulation approach for charge mobilities in photovoltaic materials has been pioneered by Andrienko, Nelson and co-workers.80–86
A similar approach86 is adopted in this study, which aims to compute the charge carrier mobility in a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the non-fullerene acceptor tetrachlorinated diperylene bisimide (DIPBI)38,87 (Fig. 1) via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (kMC)88,89 using intra- and intermolecular charge transfer rates based on Marcus theory.90 The underlying morphologies were previously generated by coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at different annealing temperatures of 500 K, 700 K, and 900 K before cooling the system down to 300 K and backmapping the structure onto an atomistic representation.91 Subsequently, the morphology is partitioned into charge residence sites (representing individual donor or acceptor molecules or fragments thereof), and charge hopping rates are computed using Marcus theory for all pairs of neighbouring sites. The hopping rates depend sensitively on the various quantities entering the Marcus formula, i.e. the internal and outer-sphere reorganisation energies, site energy difference, charge transfer integrals, and external driving forces. A number of different methods – both semi-empirical and first principles – for calculating these quantities will be assessed with regard to their accuracy and computational speed. Finally, the computed hopping rates are employed in kMC simulations from which information on charge dynamics, including mean site occupations and charge fluxes, is extracted and correlated to the morphology.

It is generally assumed that the charge carrier mobility μ in P3HT is determined by the relative and absolute size of crystalline, semi-crystalline, and amorphous domains in the sample.92,93 In completely amorphous P3HT, the mobility has been determined to be of the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field effect transistors (FET),11,94 while a range of 10−7–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been found by time-of-flight (TOF) measurements9,10 and carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV).95,96 The mobility's sensitivity to the magnitude of the external electric field and temperature96,97 may contribute to the large spread in mobility values; however, differences in the morphology are the most likely source.
Numerous correlations between the P3HT molecular morphology and the charge carrier mobility are discussed, such as an increasing fraction of crystalline regimes,98–100 an enhanced order in the π–π-stacking direction,65 the order of the polymer backbone,58,101–104 and the interconnectivity of crystallite regions by tie chains.17,58,105 Random orientation of crystalline domains and charge transport across domain boundaries reduce the mobility as compared to the perfect crystal.106,107 Hence, it is of major importance for efficient charge transport to bypass amorphous regimes.58,108 A desired tailoring of morphological features requires to understand and seize control of the molecular assembly processes and thus of the resulting solid-state short- and long-range order. Experimental studies report a peak in hole mobility as a function of molecular weight Mw, making it a potential tuning parameter due to the direct impact on the evoked micro-structure.68,69
Going beyond the morphology and focusing on individual donor molecules within it, the mobility has been shown to strongly depend on the length and conformation of the polymer chains.
Theoretical transport models along a single polymer strand find an increase of mobility with chain length109 and a saturation for sufficiently long chains.104 This details that charge transport is strongly determined by the polymer conformation58 and limited by chain folding.103 In general, the appearance of rigid chains with few conformational defects leads to an increase in mobility.110 The upper bound in mobility is found in pure crystalline P3HT in thin films with self-organised conjugated lamellae, which yield up to μ = 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in FETs.19,111–114
Charge carrier mobilities in P3HT:PCBM blends can be of the order 10−5–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 depending on the quota of regioregular P3HT in the blend15,115–117 and on the annealing temperature.15,118 The mobility can drop by four orders of magnitude in P3HT:PCBM in as-cast devices with respect to pristine P3HT, but can recuperate upon annealing.15 The mobility in pristine PCBM films is higher by one order of magnitude than in the P3HT:PCBM blends.119,120 Increasing the PCBM content to 60–80 wt% increases electron mobility and accordingly improves performance for thicker devices.120
DIPBI has been proposed38,87,121 as a non-fullerene alternative to PCBM. The DIPBI molecule is made up of two linked perylene diimide (PDI) units and possesses a slightly twisted, non-planar geometry (Fig. 1 and ESI,† Fig. S26).
In pure DIPBI organic single-crystal transistors, high charge carrier mobilities in the range of μ = 1.0–4.7 cm2 V−1 s−1121 have been determined, higher than those of PCBM-based OFETs,15,119,120,122 making it a promising candidate for solar cells. Indeed, a respectable PCE of 3.62% was measured in P3HT:DIPBI OSCs.38 There are indications that a further increase in the PCE may be prevented by DIPBI's propensity to form large aggregated π-stacks.91 The present paper aims to unravel the role of DIPBI and the morphology in charge transport in P3HT:DIPBI blends. Moreover, the simulations will provide a fundamental understanding of the relation between charge transport and morphology, which may prove useful for the future development of BHJ-OSCs.
2 Theoretical background
2.1 Marcus rate
The Marcus rate expression kAB for a charge transfer reaction A* + B → A + B* in a charge transfer complex from a hopping site A to a site B reads84 (1)The key quantities in the Marcus rate are the charge transfer integral |JAB|, the reorganization energy λAB and the site-energy difference ΔEAB. The remaining quantities are temperature T, Boltzmann's constant kB, and the reduced Planck's constant ħ.
2.2 Reorganization energy
The reorganization energy λ = λin + λout is split into an internal λin and an outer-sphere λout contribution, referring to a relaxation process of nuclear coordinates within the charge transfer complex and the environment upon charge transfer, respectively.
The internal contribution is evaluated in a four point scheme using the internal energies on the diabatic potential energy surface of molecules A and B in the charged c and neutral n states in the optimised neutral N or charged C geometry:84,123 λinAB = UnCA − UnNA + UcNB − UcCB.(2)where UnCA, for example, denotes the internal energy of neutral molecule A at the geometry optimised in the charged state.
The outer-sphere contributions84 take into account polarisation effects and the rearrangement of molecules in the environment of volume Vout surrounding the charge transfer complex. They are given by (3)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and cp = εopt−1 − εs−1 is the Pekar factor,124,125 that includes the dielectric constant at the high (εopt) and low (εs) optical frequency limits, respectively. The electric displacement fields DA,B(Rc) in the integrand are evaluated using atomic partial charges in the neutral, qn, and charged state, qc: (4)where the index a refers to atoms in molecule A, b to atoms in B, and c to atoms in the environment.
2.3 Site energy difference
The site energy difference ΔEAB = EA − EB is the driving quantity for a charge transfer reaction. The charge transfer rate yields a maximum, when the site energy difference cancels the reorganization energy. Site energies contain the internal energy contribution EinA = UcCA − UnNA, which is given by the ionization potential or the electron affinity of an individual molecule, as well as electrostatic (Eel) and polarisation (Epol) contributions accounting for environmental perturbations: EA = EinA + EelA + EpolA + EextA(5)An external electric field Fext leads to an additional contribution, ΔEext, to the site energy difference, due to an elementary electric charge q = ±e hopping along the distance vector dAB: ΔEext = −q(dAB·Fext)(6)The electrostatic interaction energy (7)is evaluated based on sets of permanent multipole moments {Qakl}, that reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP). The interaction between a component t ≡ l1k1 of the multipole expansion on site a and the component u ≡ l2k2 on site b is determined by the tensor , which mediates the distance and orientation dependence.126 The Thole model127,128 includes induction effects based on induced multipole moments {ΔQakl}. Their generation is penalized by a bilinear form, which hinders the formation of induced multipole moments, (8)where the tensor η is the inverse of the polarizability tensor α.129 Both equations for the interactions130 between permanent and induced moments (9)and the induced multipole moments (10)are solved in self-consistent cycles to obtain the induction energy contributions.84,131
2.4 Charge transfer integral
The charge transfer integral or electronic coupling element |JAB| for a charge transfer between site A and site B is given as the off-diagonal Hamiltonian matrix element |JAB| = |〈ΦA|Ĥ|ΦB〉|(11)in the diabatic basis ΦA,B describing the charge being localized on A and B, respectively.
Below we compare three different approaches to determine |JAB|, namely constrained density functional theory (CDFT), the dimer projection (DIPRO) method, and the molecular orbital overlap (MOO) method in conjunction with Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (ZINDO) Hamiltonian. These approaches decrease in accuracy, but increase in computational efficiency in the order they are listed.

2.4.1 Constrained density functional theory. 
In this work, CDFT132–135 has been used to obtain benchmark values for intermolecular and especially intramolecular transfer integrals. In CDFT, the Kohn–Sham energy functional E[ρ] is minimized under the scleronomic constraint that the charge difference between two hopping sites is Nc = 1 for the localization of the excess charge on the donor A and Nc = −1 for the localization on the acceptor B with the help of the Lagrange multiplier technique. The constraint Nc is given by (12)where ρ(r) is the electron density and w(r) is a weighting function that confines the excess charge to a certain region of space: (13)The sums in the nominator run over all atoms a and b of the donor A and the acceptor B, respectively, whereas the denominator includes all atoms N. The unperturbed (or promolecular) electron density of atom i, (14)is employed according to the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme,136 where the sum includes all orbitals ϕji(r) with occupation numbers poccj and the distance r = |r − Ri|. Furthermore, CDFT yields the vertical energy gap in Marcus theory, which is the energy difference between the diabatic states ΔEintAB(R) = EB(R) − EA(R). Here, EA is the energy of the initial diabatic state with the excess charge on donor A and EB is the corresponding energy of the final state on acceptor B.
As the calculation of |JAB| with CDFT is computationally much more demanding than with DIPRO, we only use this method for the intramolecular charge transfer integrals as a function of the torsional dihedral angle θSCCS between two adjacent hopping sites in a P3HT chain and to obtain reference data to scale intermolecular charge transfer integrals (see Section 4.2.1).


2.4.2 Dimer-projection method. 
In the DIPRO method,137 the intermolecular charge transfer integral for a given charge transfer complex is calculated by projecting the monomer frontier orbitals ϕA,B onto the dimer orbitals ψi: (15)Here, one exploits that the dimer Hamiltonian Ĥ is diagonal in the basis of the dimer eigenfunctions ψi with the eigenvalues εi. The orbitals can be calculated with any electronic structure method; however, typically DFT or semiempirical methods are employed.
The charge carriers are assumed to occupy the frontier orbitals of the hopping sites A and B, so that an electron jump occurs between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) ϕLUMOA,B and the hole transfer occurs between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) ϕHOMOA,B, respectively. As the charge transfer integral enters the Marcus rate quadratically, it favours sites with a significant frontier orbital overlap for charge transfer.


2.4.3 ZINDO-based molecular orbital overlap method. 
An alternative fast approach to evaluate the charge transfer integral exploits the molecular orbital overlap method based on the ZINDO Hamiltonian.138,139 For each dimer configuration, the method constructs the matrix elements of the ZINDO-based Hamiltonian from weighted orbital overlaps between molecules A and B in their dimer arrangement. The procedure requires only self-consistent calculation of the monomers A and B; their orbitals are then rotated and translated into the correct dimer geometry.

2.5 Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
With all parametrized Marcus charge transfer rates kAB for neighboring hopping pairs in a given morphology at hand, one can obtain the charge carrier dynamics by solving the master equation for a Markov chain140via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.84 At the beginning of every single-charge carrier kMC simulation the charge is randomly injected on a P3HT hopping site i. Then, the total escape rate kesci of site i is evaluated as a sum over all nearest neighbours j (16)Afterwards, a particular neighbour l is selected according to the variable step size method (VSSM),141 where one generates two random numbers r1,r2 ∈ (0,1] and sums all probabilities kij/kesci until the sum exceeds the value r1 at the minimal index l, i.e. (17)The charge remains on site i for the waiting time (18)which is weighted according to r2, and is then transferred from the site i to the site l. The simulation time tsim is updated by the waiting time τi, and the process is repeated until a set maximum number of kMC steps Nstep are evaluated.
The field effect mobility μ, which is a macroscopic observable, can be obtained from the relation142–144 (19)where one evaluates the projection of the average velocity of the charge carriers 〈v〉 on the unit vector eext of the external electric field Fext. The average velocity 〈v〉 is given as the charge displacement vector d divided by the simulation time tsim. For instance, if the external field Fexti is aligned parallel to a simulation box vector in direction i ∈ [x,y,z], then the projection of the velocity on the external field yields the field effect mobility μi in direction i.
The average local current145Ii through a hopping site i at position ri is given by (20)where the sum takes into account both the occupations pocc and the charge transfer rates kij to all nearest neighbours j in a distance dij = (rj − ri)/rij.84
3 Computational details
3.1 Marcus rate evaluation
The wavefunction and geometry optimizations were performed with the Gaussian 09 Rev. D.01 program package.146 For the calculation of the charge transfer integrals and the internal reorganization energy λin in P3HT, the polymer chains are reduced to the polymer backbone, substituting the hexyl side chains by methyl groups, leading to poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT).
An in-house code (Charge Transport Package (CTP)147) was developed to control the workflow within the multiscale model. It is provided as a GitHub repository together with data to evaluate charge transfer rates. It assists in the calculation for the components of the charge transfer rates by driving conventional software packages84,146,148–151 and assembles these results for the determination of the charge transfer rates.
The internal reorganization energy λin and the internal site energy difference ΔEin are evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional152,153 and the 6-311G** basis set154–156 for DIPBI and P3MT with different thiophene segment lengths n ∈ [1,32].147
Charge transfer integrals were calculated using the three different methods introduced in Section 2.4. All CDFT-based intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer integrals132,134,135 were calculated with the CPMD software package149 using the PBE functional157 in conjunction with Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials158 and a plane wave (PW) basis set truncated at an energy cutoff of 80 Ry.
For a DIPBI dimer, an orthorhombic simulation box of size 22.0 × 21.0 × 25.0 Å3 was chosen. For homomolecular P3MT pairs, the box size was adjusted according to their conformation – from 15.0 × 13.0 × 23.0 Å3 to 15.0 × 16.0 × 23.0 Å3 for P3MT 3mers, from 15.0 × 16.0 × 23.0 Å3 to 15.0 × 16.0 × 30.0 Å3 for P3MT 5mers, and from 15.0 × 13.0 × 35.0 Å3 to 15.0 × 16.0 × 39.0 Å3 for P3MT 7mers.
Our in-house code147 was developed to perform DIPRO calculations using orbitals generated by the Gaussian 09 or DFTB+150 programs. DIPRO charge transfer integrals were calculated in combination with the semiempirical PM3,159–161 AM1,162 ZINDO,139,163 and DFTB164,165 methods, as well as with DFT. In the Gaussian 09 package, the DFTB calculations are performed with Slater–Koster files166,167 and the Mio-1-1168,169 parametrization, while the DFTB+ program package uses the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding method (SCC-DFTB)170 approach with the 3OB-3-1 set of parameters for the third-order parametrization for organic and biological systems.171–173 DIPRO/DFT calculations were carried out with the exchange–correlation functionals PBE,157 PBE0,174 and B3LYP in combination with the basis sets 6-31G* or 6-311G**.
The charge transfer integrals with the ZINDO/MOO method138 were computed using the VOTCA program package.84,151
The outer-sphere reorganization energy contributions λout were evaluated taking into account all atoms inside the simulation box using the minimum image convention.84 The Pekar factor was estimated to be cp = 0.05 from the experimentally determined dielectric permittivity of P3HT at high frequencies, εopt = 3.0,175 and at low frequencies, εs = 3.5.176 In the absence of any corresponding data for DIPBI, we approximated the cp value of the blend with that of pure P3HT.
The outer-sphere contributions to the site energy difference, Eel and Epol, (see Section 2.3) were calculated in a self-consistent fashion using the Thole model127,128 with a default cutoff of about routcut = 30 Å,84 using atomic polarizabilities and partial charges. The latter were obtained with Gaussian 09, using the CHelpG method177 with DFT B3LYP/6-311G** by averaging over 10 samples of the same species extracted from the atomistic morphology for its neutral, positively or negatively charged state, respectively.
3.2 Morphology
Atomistic molecular mechanics (MM) simulations are performed using the GROMACS program package.148,178 We use an initial, amorphous P3HT morphology published elsewhere179 with 416 P3HT 32mer polymer chains. It is reheated to T = 900 K for 15 ns in a NPT run with a velocity rescale thermostat,180 a Parrinello–Rahman barostat181 with a constant pressure of p = 1 bar and a time step of Δt = 1 fs. Subsequently, the system is cooled to T = 300 K and run for 1 ns, resulting in a unit cell with an average dimension of (30.6 × 10.4 × 10.5 nm3).
The blend simulations are performed in an orthorhombic box of size 13.9 × 26.9 × 14.6 nm3, containing 416 P3HT polymers made up of 32 thiophene units, each, and 1248 DIPBI molecules, corresponding to a density of ρ = 1.245 g cm−3. We focus on three different morphologies, which were equilibrated in coarse grained molecular dynamics runs at T = 500, 700, and 900 K, followed by a backmapping to an atomistic MM representation and re-equilibration at room temperature.91
The angle density to distance plot was generated with the Molecular Plane Analyser package developed in-house182 using an intermolecular cutoff distance of 15 Å.
3.3 Charge transport simulations
The hopping rates are calculated with CTP147 for the 12 nearest neighbours of every hopping site, defined by the distance of the center of mass (COM) in the nearest image convention in the orthorhombic simulation box. This corresponds to an average distance of the twelfth neighbour of P3HTNN12 = (10.8 ± 1.6) Å for P3HT hopping sites and DIPBINN12 = (14.5 ± 1.6) Å for DIPBI, and leads to an average distance between the hopping sites of AB = (8.4 ± 3.1) Å (Table S3, ESI†). The kMC simulations are based on a set of Marcus rates precomputed with CTP147 and they are carried out with the VOTCA program package.151 As a default, we apply a moderate external field of magnitude |Fext| = 1.0 × 107 V m−111,84 in x, y, or z direction and average over Nkmc = 72 kMC simulations per field direction with Nsteps = 1.0 × 1010 steps, each, of a single charge carrier inside the simulation box to obtain the total mobility  at a temperature T = 300 K.
The kMC simulations are initialized as follows. At the beginning of every simulation, a single morphology frame is extracted from the atomistic P3HT:DIPBI MM simulation and partitioned into hopping sites using CTP.147 Each DIPBI molecule is regarded as a single hopping site, due to its extended frontier π-orbitals, whereas the P3HT 32mer chains are separated into subunits according to the torsional angle between the individual thiophene rings. If the dihedral angle θSCCS between two adjacent rings meets the cutoff criterion, (21)the rings are considered to belong to different hopping sites in the polymer chain. A cutoff dihedral angle of θcutSCCS = 75° was chosen for the SCCS dihedral angle θSCCS between two adjacent thiophene rings based on the delocalisation of the frontier molecular orbitals179 (for more details, see ESI,† Section S7). In the Marcus model, the charge-localized states represent a set of diabatic basis functions.
This procedure results in hopping sites corresponding to polymer segments of different lengths n ∈ [1,32] (ESI,† Fig. S1). For the P3HT morphology, we thus arrive at 1284 hopping sites, yielding 9985 charge transfer pairs in the neighbour list, including 878 intrachain transitions.
For the P3HT:DIPBI blend morphology at 500 K, one obtains a total of 47546 hopping pairs, composed of 3496 DIPBI ↔ DIPBI, 8726 DIPBI ↔ P3HT, and 35324 P3HT ↔ P3HT hopping pairs. The latter category is subdivided into 4851 intrachain and 30473 interchain transitions between hopping pairs. A similar partitioning is obtained for the morphologies at 700 K and 900 K (Table S3, ESI†).
As the employed atomistic force field includes united atom types, the molecules need to be saturated with H atoms at the aliphatic side chains using CTP147 prior to the quantum-chemical calculations. This also applies to the boundaries between intrachain P3HT segments, where additional H atoms are inserted to saturate the segments to be able to perform DIPRO charge transfer integral calculations. These H atoms are afterwards treated as virtual H atoms in the multipole expansion schemes and do not contribute to the outer-sphere energy contributions.
All intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer rates are pre-evaluated for all pairs in a neighbour list using CTP147 and loaded into the VOTCA program package to perform the kMC simulations.
4 Results and discussion
Before we discuss the kMC simulations, we take a closer look at the key ingredients entering the Marcus rates and compare the performance of a variety of quantum-chemical methods.
4.1 Internal reorganization energy and site energy difference
The internal reorganization energies λin and internal site energy differences ΔEin were all calculated at the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G** level based on the optimized structures of isolated molecules. These intrinsically averaged data sets are applied to all pairs, regardless of relative orientation, conformation or local environment. The results are depicted in (Fig. 2) for hole transfer between DIPBI molecules and both P3MT → DIPBI and DIPBI → P3MT transitions as a function of the thiophene segment length n. The internal reorganization energy between two DIPBI molecules is λin = 0.130 eV.
 Fig. 2  (a) Internal reorganization energy λin and (b) internal site energy difference ΔEin for hole charge transfer as a function of the thiophene segment length n in a P3MT chain. The data is based on DFT/B3LYP/6-311G**. Transitions for hole transfer between DIPBI → P3MT (red), P3MT → DIPBI (orange) and DIPBI → DIPBI (violet) are taken into account. 
As can be seen from (Fig. 2), the reorganization energy λin is generally higher for hole transfer from DIPBI to P3MT than in the opposite direction, except for n = 1. The DIPBI → P3MT curve exhibits a maximum of λin = 0.514 eV at n = 3 and decreases gradually with increasing n to λin = 0.324 eV for n = 20 (Fig. 2a, red curve). In the inverse direction (P3MT → DIPBI), the reorganization energy decreases from λin = 0.308 eV at n = 1 with increasing n to λin = 0.163 eV at n = 20 (Fig. 2b, orange curve). As the reorganization energy is practically converged asymptotically for n = 20, the same value is also applied for n ∈ [21,32]. The validity of this approximation is supported by DFTB based reorganization energies, which are lower in energy but extend the trend to P3MT 32mers (Fig. S2, ESI†). The internal site energy difference ΔEin for hole transfer from DIPBI to P3MT increases with rising thiophene segment length n and reaches the asymptotic value of ΔEin = 2.036 eV for n = 20 (Fig. 2b, red line). This value is also used for n > 20. The negative value for n = 1 of ΔEin = −1.180 eV is an exception, as all other values (for n > 1) are positive, favouring hole transfer from DIPBI to P3HT. This is the expected behaviour for a blend of the electron donor (hole acceptor) P3HT and the electron acceptor (hole donor) DIPBI. For hole transfer in the opposite direction (P3MT → DIPBI), the values for ΔEin mostly possess negative sign, due to the relation ΔEinAB = −ΔEinBA (curve not shown). If A and B are the same species, ΔEin = 0 eV.
4.2 Charge transfer integral
A key quantity in the parametrization of charge transfer rates is the charge transfer integral |JAB|. As the DIPRO-based charge transfer integrals can vary significantly with respect to the chosen electronic structure method (e.g. AM1, PM3, ZINDO, DFTB), we propose a scaling scheme for intermolecular DIPRO charge transfer integrals (Section 4.2.1) to meet the predictions of CDFT reference calculations. A torsion-dependent parametrization of the intramolecular charge transfer integrals for P3HT is derived from CDFT reference values (Section 4.2.2).

4.2.1 Scaling the DIPRO charge transfer integral |JAB|. 
The charge transfer integral |JAB| is evaluated using the DIPRO method in combination with different electronic structure approaches for pairs of P3MT oligomers of variable length at different intermolecular distances and orientations and compared to CDFT reference values. Thus, scaling factors are derived for the DIPRO approach in conjunction with DFT, PM3, DFTB/Mio-1-1, and DFTB/3OB-3-1 with respect to CDFT. As CDFT is computationally rather demanding, we limit its application to small oligomers (i.e. 3mers, 5mers, and 7mers) of P3MT. The P3MT pairs were constructed from two planar molecules with various interplanar distances Δz = [3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0] Å both at an initial position Δx = 0 ÅÅ (see Fig. 3a) and with a lateral shift of Δx = 4.0 Å (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  Relative alignment of a pair of P3MT 3mers without a lateral Δx = 0 Å shift at a vertical distance Δz = 3.0 Å (a) and a lateral shift Δx = 4.0 Å and a vertical distance Δz = 5.0 Å (b). 
As one can see in Fig. 4, CDFT yields higher |JAB| values for hole transfer than DIPRO for all configurations of P3MT pairs. A linear fit |JAB|CDFT = a|JAB|DIPRO + b was performed for each data set. Especially for low values of |JAB|, the data are seen to lie close to the fitted line, while one observes larger deviations for larger |JAB| values. In the case of DIPRO/PBE/6-311G**, the linear fit gives a slope of a = 2.887 and a y-axis intercept of b = −32.01 meV; for DIPRO/PM3 one obtains a = 6.886 and b = −55.74 meV.

The sensitivity of the DIPRO charge transfer integrals |JAB| on the chosen underlying electronic structure method also becomes apparent from the distribution for all neighbouring hopping pairs in an amorphous P3HT morphology (Fig. S6, ESI†). One can see that the unscaled distributions can differ significantly in shape, mean value, and standard deviation, ZINDO/MOO and DIPRO/ZINDO yielding lower average values than DFTB, AM1, or PM3.


4.2.2 Intramolecular charge transport in P3HT. 
The intramolecular charge transfer integral |JintAB| and the vertical energy gap ΔEintAB for P3MT with n = 2 were calculated by CDFT as a function of the dihedral angle θSCCS between two thiophene units (Fig. 5). For this purpose, the dihedral angle θ(SCCS) was varied between −180° and 180° in steps of 2.5°. For each geometry, two CDFT calculations were carried out in which the excess charge is localized on the donor A and on the acceptor B segments, respectively. Subsequently, the charge transfer integral |JintAB| and the vertical energy gap ΔEintAB are evaluated using the two diabatic wavefunctions.
 Fig. 5  Intramolecular charge transfer integral |JintAB| (a) and vertical energy gap ΔEintAB (b) for hole transfer in P3MT with n = 2 as a function of the dihedral angle θSCCS (inset) obtained with CDFT. 

Fig. 5a shows that |JAB(θ)| has a maximum value of 2.97 eV at θ ≈ −180°, which corresponds to a planar configuration with the methyl groups on the same side of the chain. The value of |JAB(θ)| then decreases with increasing θ and reaches a minimum at −90°. It is worth noting that even at this orthogonal orientation of the two thiophene rings, the charge transfer integral does not completely vanish, but remains at |Jmin| = 0.018 eV. A further increase in θ leads to a second, slightly lower maximum of 2.88 eV at θ = 0°, in which the side methyl groups face away from each other (regioregular P3MT). Overall, the curve exhibits a mirror symmetry with respect to θ = 0°.
The minimum vertical energy gap ΔEintAB is −0.11 eV at θ ≈ −180° (Fig. 5b). The value of ΔEintAB remains practically constant up to θ ≈ −140°, then increases up to a maximum of 0.14 eV at θ ≈ 0°, switching sign at θ ≈ −85°. The slight asymmetry of the curve with respect to θ = 0° can be understood in terms of the underlying molecular asymmetry of the dithiophene.
In the kMC simulations of P3HT or P3HT:DIPBI morphologies, the above dihedral-dependent values of |JintAB| and ΔEintAB are employed as follows. If a pair of two neighbouring P3HT segments in the morphology is separated by an angle θSCCS, which satisfies the cutoff criterion (eqn (21)), then the |JintAB(θ)| and ΔEintAB(θ) values obtained from cubic spline fits to the respective data sets are used to evaluate intrachain hole transfer rates kintAB. This procedure is applied irrespective of the length of the P3HT segments. A transition to a segment on the same chain that is not a direct lateral neighbour is made possible by employing a charge transfer integral |JAB| obtained from the DIPRO method and is considered an intermolecular transfer.
The importance of variations in the torsion angle along the polymer backbone for intrachain charge transport is undoubted.183 The excess charge induces a chain planarization that goes along with a reduction of the amount of energetic disorder along the chain and in its environment.184,185 In the literature, the dihedral dependence of the intramolecular charge transfer integral has been approximated as186 J = J0cos(θ)(22)with J0 ≈ 0.3 eV estimated from the HOMO/HOMO−1 splitting using the fragment orbital approach. Alternatively, this dependence has been incorporated directly into the charge transfer rate,187,188 (23)with a prefactor ν = 1015 s−1 and J0 = 1 eV.189 Our CDFT-based procedure goes beyond such ad hoc approximations. It is applicable to all chain conformations found in the morphology and ensures the accessibility of all segments along the polymer chain to the excess charge.

4.3 kMC simulations of pure P3HT

4.3.1 Hole mobility. 
As a first test of our model, we simulate the hole mobility in the well-studied system of amorphous pure P3HT. Our particular focus is on how different approximations made in the evaluation of the quantities entering the Marcus charge transfer rate affect the simulated charge carrier mobility.
The order parameter S (see ESI,† Section S5 and Fig. S7) of the employed P3HT morphology obtained from molecular dynamics simulations (see Computational details) clearly indicates that the system is in an amorphous phase. This corroborates our finding from visual inspection, where we note the absence of both crystalline regimes and extended spaces of parallel aligned P3HT lamellae. As a first approach to determine the charge carrier mobility, we treat each P3HT chain as a single molecule (n = 32) and compute the site energy contributions Ei = Eel + Epol for 416 P3HT (Fig. S8, ESI†), yielding an average energy of Ēi = (−0.131 ± 0.146) eV (eqn (5)). The average outer-sphere reorganization energy distribution is out = (0.157 ± 0.014) eV (eqn (3)).
Regarding the intermolecular charge transfer integrals |JAB|, the major drawback of treating each P3HT chain as a single entity is that frontier orbitals are not necessarily localized in the region where two neighbouring molecules interact most strongly (ESI,† Section S7 and Fig. S10) This often leads to tiny wavefunction overlaps and thus small values of |JAB|, in turn yielding unphysically small charge transfer rates. As a consequence, a very low mobility of μtot = (1.73 ± 4.04) × 10−14 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained from the kMC simulations with default ZINDO/MOO transfer integrals.
In an improved approach, the P3HT polymer chains were partitioned into segments according to a cutoff dihedral angle of θcutSCCS = 75° (Fig. S10, ESI†). All quantities entering the Marcus rate were then calculated based on the individual segments except for the outer-sphere contributions. This opens up a large number of additional pathways leading to a dramatically higher mobility of μtot = (6.21 ± 0.66) × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 (using ZINDO/MOO transfer integrals), due to the ability of the charges to access different conjugated segments along the polymer chains.
As a further improvement, also the outer-sphere contributions, i.e. λout and ΔEout, were calculated with respect to individual segments. In addition, intramolecular hole transport along different adjacent, conjugated segments in a P3HT polymer chain was now taken into account using the CDFT rates calculated in Section 4.2.2. Together with ZINDO/MOO intermolecular charge transfer integrals, this leads to another increase in the total mobility by one order of magnitude to μtot = (9.01 ± 47.0) × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1.
In the following, instead of the ZINDO/MOO method for intermolecular charge transfer integrals |JAB|, we use the (unscaled) DIPRO approach in combination with the different electronic structure methods ZINDO, DFTB/3OB, AM1 and PM3 in order to assess the impact on intermolecular hole transport.
The lowest charge carrier mobility of μtot = (1.34 ± 7.76) × 10−12 cm2 V−1 s−1 is found for DIPRO/ZINDO. An increase by an order of magnitude to μtot = (5.41 ± 11.9) × 10−11 cm2 V−1 s−1 is found for DFTB/3OB. The semiempirical methods AM1 and PM3 lead to very similar results of μtot = (1.84 ± 0.25) × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μtot = (1.85 ± 0.14) × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
In a further step, we employ linearly scaled DIPRO/DFTB/3OB and DIPRO/PM3 charge transfer integrals to match our benchmark CDFT values (see Table 1). For DFTB/3OB, linear scaling leads to an increase in the total mobility by more than one order of magnitude to μtot = (1.15 ± 0.48) × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similarly, an increased mobility of μtot = (3.81 ± 8.18) × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for PM3.
To study the effect of the outer-sphere contributions to the total mobility, we have also carried out kMC simulations in which the corresponding terms were switched off, i.e. by setting λout = 0 and ΔEout = 0. In combination with unscaled DIPRO/PM3 transfer integrals, we thus obtained a mobility of μtot = (1.87 ± 4.00) × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. Comparison to the result obtained including outer-sphere contributions shows that they have a detrimental effect on hole mobility when they are calculated based on a segmented polymer chain. The mobility is, however, vastly enhanced when the outer-sphere contributions are calculated based on the assumption that the excess charge occupies the entire polymer chain, yielding a value of 1.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Experimental hole mobilities in completely amorphous, pure P3HT range from 10−7 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.9,10,15 An even higher mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 was measured for intrachain transport.190 Typical time of flight experiments are performed with moderate external fields of the order of Fext = 1 × 107 V m−111 to 1 × 108 V m−1.9 This range has also been used for theoretical modelling of photovoltaic materials,84 although the local field strength in the material is not strictly known due to possible screening effects,191 the emergence of space charges192,193 due to (undesired) doping194 and imbalanced charge transport.195,196 However, the charge carrier mobility is known to be extremely sensitive to the applied external field.10 This has also been found in recent theoretical studies using a lower external field of Fext = 1 × 104 V m−1,16 resulting in a charge carrier mobility of μ ≈ 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for amorphous P3HT. Theoretical mobilities of the same order of magnitude have also been obtained for a vanishing external field using the ZINDO electronic structure method and a constant reorganization energy.197
To further investigate the influence of the external field strength, we have carried out kMC simulations at various values of Fext between 1 and 1010 V m−1. As one can see from Fig. S12 (ESI†), the mobility monotonously increases with decreasing field strength. For Fext = 1 × 104 V m−1, we obtain a mobility of μ ≈ 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, in agreement with Adamo et al.16 Clearly, it is possible to obtain any mobility value by adjusting the external field including the experimental results. Therefore precise knowledge of the local electric field present in the material would be highly desirable.
Furthermore, there are a number of other approximations made in the multiscale modelling approach applied here that can potentially impact the mobility, e.g. finite size effects97,198 or the reduction of the P3HT chain length to 32 segments, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 5.3 kDa. Experimentally, molecular weights ranging from 5 kDa to 72 kDa and beyond have been used resulting in mobility variations of up to two orders of magnitude.68,69,103,114,199 Moreover, hole mobility crucially depends on the degree of crystallinity99,100,104 and the locally ordered packing of chain segments103,200 in the device,201 which in turn depends on the length of the polymers used. Such ordered domains are completely absent in our morphology, which is consistent with the low mobilities observed in our simulations.
Another limitation of the present model is the assumption of fixed nuclei during charge transport, not allowing for any feedback of the electronic dynamics onto the nuclear subsystem. Hence polaronic effects, which have been shown to be important in other polymeric materials202–204, are not included here.
To summarize, the choice of electronic structure method for the evaluation of the charge transfer integrals and the outer-sphere contributions influences the simulated hole mobility significantly. From the comparison of our kMC results with literature values, we conclude that charge transfer rates based on Marcus theory using the scaled DIPRO/PM3 method for interchain charge transfer integrals and the CDFT-based intrachain charge transfer integrals in combination with outer-sphere reorganization energies as well as electrostatic and polarization contributions to the site-energy difference constitute a good compromise between accuracy and computational effort for the determination of the hole mobility in amorphous P3HT.

4.4 Site occupation and current in P3HT
Visual inspection of the hopping site occupation numbers inside the P3HT morphology shows that there are densely packed regions with elevated average occupation numbers connected by isolated filamentary polymer chains with even higher occupation numbers (Fig. 6). The average occupation numbers  of the hopping sites in P3HT decrease from n = 1 to n = 4 and tend to increase with the conjugated segment length for n > 4 (Fig. 7a). A similar observation can be made for the local current albeit with more pronounced local deviations from the overall trend (Fig. 7b).
 Fig. 6  Hopping sites with 10% highest occupation numbers in the P3HT morphology. 
 Fig. 7  (a) Decadic logarithm of average hole occupation numbers log10 of hopping sites as a function of the thiophene segment length n in the P3HT morphology from kMC simulations with holes at an applied external field Fext = 1.0 × 107 V m−1 in x-direction. (b) Average current density per hopping site |Ī| for hole transport. 
The pathway of lowest resistance for the charge carriers to cross the simulation box is evaluated using Dijkstra's algorithm.205 For this purpose, we define the external voltage between two hopping sites i and j as Uij = Fext·dij and evaluate the current Iij on the basis of the occupation numbers pocc and charge transfer rates kji and thus determine the local resistance (24)where eij = dij/dij is the unit vector connecting the two sites. This way, we have transformed the network of local currents |Iij| to one of local resistances |Rlocij| between nodes. To analyze the charge carrier pathways between the two electrodes, we follow the charge carrier movement between two narrow slabs perpendicular to the field at opposite ends of the simulation cell, which we denote as start and end zones. The start zone with a width dzone = 15 Å includes all hopping site centers with dCOMl < dzonel (l = x, y, z), while the end zone is obtained by shifting the start zone by the box length dboxl thus extending the box in field direction l by dzone. In other words, we follow the charge carriers until they have travelled the entire length of the box in l-direction. For every hopping site in the start zone, the Dijkstra algorithm is applied to obtain the pathway of lowest resistance  for reaching the end zone.
The five pathways with the lowest resistance are shown in Fig. 8. On average they have a resistance of log10Rtot = (13.2 ± 0.9) Ω, the minimum resistance being log10Rtotmin = 11.9 Ω. The path of minimum resistance contains predominantly long, nearly planar segments with an average chain length of  = 16.4 ± 9.7. It consists of 29% intrachain and 71% interchain transitions.

5 P3HT:DIPBI blend
5.1 Morphologies
In the following, we will focus on the characterization of the three different P3HT:DIPBI morphologies generated with annealing temperatures of 500 K, 700 K, and 900 K in coarse-grained simulations. Since some differences in the UV/vis spectra of the three systems were found in ref. 91, we wondered if charge carrier mobilities also differ. First we analyse the planarity of the P3HT chains and then describe the stacking behaviour of DIPBI in the blend.
We define a planarity descriptor P for individual P3HT 32mers (see ESI,† Section S9, eqn (2)), determine its distribution for all chains inside the morphology, and compare the average values  for an entire blend morphology (Fig. S13, ESI†). The three morphologies obtained at 500 K, 700 K, and 900 K give very similar values of  = 7.66 ± 0.96, 7.63 ± 0.93 and 7.75 ± 1.00, respectively. In contrast, the value for pure P3HT is much higher ( = 17.95 ± 1.07), meaning that the planarity of the P3HT chains decreases significantly in the presence of DIPBI. This is corroborated by our finding that conjugated segments are typically longer in pure P3HT (Fig. S1, ESI†).
In order to characterize the aggregation patterns of DIPBI, we calculated the intermolecular distance dAB = |dB − dA| and the angle α = arccos(nA·nB) enclosed by the two normal vectors nA and nB for every pair of DIPBI molecules A and B within a 15 Å radius (see ESI,† Section S10 for the precise definition of dAB and nA,B). The density plots shown in Fig. 9 illustrate the frequency with which distinct relative DIPBI/DIPBI arrangements occur in the simulation box as a function of dAB and α. The DIPBI molecules are seen to favour π–π-stacking with the molecular planes aligned parallel to each other. This is indicated by the bright areas around α = 0° and α = 180°. In the density plot for the 500 K morphology, a bright spot is visible at about dAB = 4.0 Å, which can be attributed to nearest neighbour stacking. The bright feature extends up to dAB = 6.0 Å, corresponding to half overlapping DIPBI molecules, which stack with only one PBI wing, each. Analogous patterns emerge with lower density at dAB = 8.0 Å and dAB = 12.0 Å, corresponding to the second-nearest and third-nearest neighbours, respectively. The obscure region in the center around α ∈ [30°,170°] and dAB < 10 Å corresponds to physically unrealizable arrangements due to the spatial extension of the unflexible DIPBI core without side chains measuring about 15 × 15 × 4 Å3. At larger distances of dAB > 10 Å, one can also find tilted pair configurations including orthogonally aligned T-stacks.
 Fig. 9  Density plots of the distance dAB and the angle α between the normal vectors to the DIPBI planes for three P3HT:DIPBI morphologies at 500 K, 700 K and 900 K. 
The spots corresponding to DIPBI/DIPBI stacking arrangements are more smeared in the 700 K morphology owing to lateral shift, and the hot spot at dAB = 4.0 Å is reduced in intensity. The number of pairs in the range dAB = 12.0–15 Å is increased, when compared to 500 K.
The 900 K morphology exhibits a higher tendency for aggregation from dAB = 4.0 Å up to dAB = 7.0 Å, where the hot spots are smeared out along the distance axis due to more shear movement along molecular planes at higher temperatures. A reduced number of pairs are found for T-stacks in the interval α ∈ [50°,150°] and at dAB = 10–14 Å.
All in all, the three density plots detail the presence of stacking aggregates.
The radial distribution functions g(r) of the hopping sites centres do not alter significantly for the three morphologies (see ESI,† Section S11 and Fig. S15). Also the size distributions of the occurring P3HT segments are similar (Fig. S1, ESI†).
5.2 Hole mobility
In the following, we discuss kMC results obtained with different approximations and morphologies. We start with kMC simulations performed for a single time frame from the morphology at 500 K with charge transfer integrals |JAB| calculated using the CDFT/PBE and unscaled DIPRO/PM3 approaches for intramolecular and intermolecular hops, respectively, and internal reorganization energies λin computed at the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G* level. If we set all outer-sphere contributions to zero, we obtain a rather high charge carrier mobility of μ = (6.02 ± 0.05) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The inclusion of outer-sphere reorganization energy contributions λout for a whole P3HT 32mer results in a reduction of the charge carrier mobility by four orders of magnitude to (2.60 ± 0.06) × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Additional incorporation of site energy differences ΔEout contributions for a whole P3HT 32mer does not alter the mobility significantly, yielding a value of (3.07 ± 0.08) × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. Analogous simulations for the morphologies obtained at 700 K and 900 K give mobilities of (2.58 ± 0.14) × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and (5.27 ± 0.15) × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These findings correlate with the increasing degree of order found with decreasing annealing temperature.91
Scaling the DIPRO/PM3 intermolecular transfer integrals to the CDFT reference data dramatically raises the hole mobility to (8.41 ± 0.07) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 500 K morphology - an increase by four orders of magnitude including outer-sphere contributions for entire polymer chains (see ESI,† Section S6)
The influence of the external field strength on the charge carrier mobility was investigated in the interval Fexti ∈ [1.0 × 107, 3.0 × 108] V m−1 (Fig. 10). Overall, an inverse field dependence can be seen, i.e. the mobility decreases with increasing external field by up to four orders of magnitude in this interval. It can also be seen that charge transport is practically isotropic. The curves for μx, μy, and μz appear to be particularly close together at low external fields, but this is owed to the logarithmic scale.
 Fig. 10  Charge carrier mobility μi (i ∈ x,y,z) in P3HT:DIPBI as a function of the external field strength Fexti in i-direction. Charge transfer integrals |JAB| were obtained from DIPRO/PM3 scaled to CDFT. 
Both phenomenological and theoretical statistical analyses in the literature206,207 predict the relation . The coefficient β is temperature dependent and has been shown experimentally to become negative above 250 K in the case of amorphous P3HT10 in agreement with our results (see Fig. S12, ESI† for pure P3HT). The physical interpretation for negative field dependence is as follows: when the spatial disorder in the system exceeds the energetic disorder, a few randomly oriented fast hopping routes exist. At higher fields, those fast routes whose direction is not aligned with the direction of the external electric field are diminished, resulting in decreasing mobility with increasing electric field.208
To our knowledge, no experimental data for charge carrier mobilities in P3HT:DIPBI blends are available so far. Our simulations suggest, however, that the mobility in the blend is considerably enhanced compared to amorphous P3HT (see above).
5.3 Site occupation

Fig. 11 displays the 10% most occupied hopping sites in the P3HT:DIPBI morphology and their respective average occupations. It indicates that segments with high occupancy are irregularly distributed within the morphology. Note that the occupation numbers vary over many orders of magnitude, even within the top 10%. The site with the highest occupation is a terminal P3HT chain segment with n = 6 and an occupation probability of p = 0.28%. As illustrated by Fig. 11, hole transport occurs predominantly within the P3HT network. Of the top 10% most populated sites, about 5% are DIPBIs (Fig. 11, top) and 95% are P3HTs (Fig. 11, bottom). The DIPBI molecules are evenly scattered inside the simulation box and do not emerge in large clusters or networks, the maximum number of molecules in an aggregate being three. In addition, the DIPBIs exhibit only low to medium occupation numbers. The P3HT molecules, on the other hand, clearly form a three dimensional network inside the simulation box representing highly efficient charge transport channels, which are separated from each other by vast void spaces. In fact, 16% of all DIPBI and 7% of P3HT hopping sites are never visited at all in the simulations. The picture emerging from the above population analysis, that hole transport takes place mainly in the P3HT subsystem, is further underlined by a closer look at the number of hops occurring between different types of sites. It turns out that 99.8% of all hops occur from a P3HT segment to another P3HT segment, which differentiate into 6.3% intramolecular and 93.7% intermolecular jumps. Only 0.1% of all hole jumps occur from one DIPBI to another DIPBI, a small portion of 8.09 × 10−4% are transitions from DIPBI to P3HT and a slightly lower amount jumps in opposite direction, which exclusively arise from segments with n ≤ 3.
 Fig. 11  Hopping sites with the 10% highest occupation in the P3HT:DIPBI morphology from kMC simulations with holes at an external field Fext = 1.0 × 107 V m−1 in y-direction. Upper panel: DIPBI, lower panel: P3HT. The occupation numbers are averages over 72 charge carrier trajectories. 
In addition to locating the sites with the highest occupations, we have also calculated the overall average occupation numbers  for DIPBI and different segment lengths of P3HT. As can be seen from Fig. 12 the average occupation of DIPBI is far lower than any P3HT value, in line with the above observations. Fig. 12 also reveals a tendency for rising occupations with increasing segment length n, which goes hand in hand with an increased average resting time (Fig. S16, ESI†) and an increased delocalization of the excess charge.
 Fig. 12  Decadic logarithm of average hole occupation numbers  (a) and average local current per hopping site |Ī| (b) for hole transport as a function of the thiophene chain length n of a conjugated segment in the P3HT:DIPBI morphology. For n = 16, no error bar is shown because only one segment of this length occurs. 
5.4 Current
The average local current per hopping site |Ī| for hole transport (eqn (20)) is depicted in the bottom panel of Fig. 12 as a function of the P3HT segment length n. The overall trend is that |Ī| increases with n, being larger by one order of magnitude for the longest segments compared to the shortest. As the hole occupation numbers are low for DIPBI molecules (see above), the contribution of DIPBI to the total current is also low.
The regions of high average local current are illustrated in Fig. 13. As the isosurface with I = 1.12 A m−2 (red tubes) shows, there exists a network of current tracks along which hole transport predominately occurs. Among the hopping sites with the highest 10% local current contributions to the total current, the vast majority (94.9%) are P3HT segments and only about 5.1% DIPBI molecules.
 Fig. 13  Molecules with the highest 10% local current contribution log10|Ī| to the total current (color-coded) based on kMC simulations of hole transport in P3HT:DIPBI morphology. The simulation box includes the isodensity surface for the local hole current at I = 1.12 A m−2 (red tubes). 
We have calculated the pathways with the lowest resistance using the Dijkstra algorithm (see Section 4.4). Choosing a thickness of dzoney = 15 Å of the start and end zones, we have 360 hopping sites in the start zone. Fig. 14 displays 15 representative minimum resistance pathways with different starting points giving rise to three main branches crossing the simulation box with the lowest Rtot values (see Fig. S24, ESI† for the distribution of log10Rtot).
 Fig. 14  Charge carrier pathways with minimal resistance in P3HT:DIPBI morphology based on Dijkstra algorithm. The pathways are determined for every molecule in the start zone (black, below) to those in the end zone (black, above). The molecules, which belong to the pathways are depicted in the paper chain representation (orange), where the one with the lowest Rtot is depicted in VdW representation. 
The pathways include several stretched thiophene chains that are predominantly oriented parallel to the external field direction y. The pathway with the smallest Rtot consists of 196 thiophene units, the average segment length being  = 4.7 ± 2.5, and nine DIPBI molecules involving 32% intramolecular transitions and 55% intermolecular transitions within the same domain, and 12% D/A or A/D transitions. It traverses five DIPBI molecules that are connected by a π-stacking motive with lateral shifts. Also the parallel alignment of thiophene chains facilitates charge transport. We can correlate these structural features of the pathways to the local resistance log10Rloc (Fig. 15a). The pathway exhibits small resistance along linear sections and larger values at winding sections with predominantly intermolecular transitions at the interfaces. Taking the average resistance of all low resistance pathways yields log10Rtot = (10.7 ± 1.1) Ω with a minimum resistance log10Rtotmin = 9.7 Ω. These numbers are considerably lower than the corresponding values for pure P3HT (see above). Note that the lowest possible resistance of a molecule is πħ/e2 = 12.9 kΩ.209 Experimental investigations find a linear relationship between the molecular length and resistance in oligothiophenes chain length n > 11 at the order log10R = 8 to 10 Ω,210,211 which coincides with our findings.
 Fig. 15  Hole transport pathways with small electronic resistance based on Marcus hole transfer rates using the Dijkstra algorithm. (a) Hole transport pathways with (color-coded) local resistance log10Rloc and (b) the occupation numbers log10pocc. 
The DIPBI molecules exhibit smaller occupation numbers along the pathway compared to those found on P3HT segments especially high pocc at longer chains, which coincides with the findings in depicted in Fig. 12a). Overall, combinations of intramolecular and intermolecular transitions promote efficient hole transport in P3HT:DIPBI morphology.
6 Conclusions
A multiscale model to investigate the interplay of donor and acceptor components in a P3HT:DIPBI donor–acceptor blend and the resulting effects on charge transport properties in an organic bulk heterojunction solar cell has been presented. It employs morphologies obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, back-mapped onto an atomistic representation, and charge transport simulations using the kinetic Monte Carlo method in combination with Marcus charge transfer rates, which are parametrised using first principles or semiempirical electronic structure approaches. We find that the choice of method to compute charge transfer integrals and reorganization energies can influence the resulting charge carrier mobilities immensely. Linear scaling factors have been established to enable the use of DIPRO-based charge transfer integrals from computationally efficient semiempirical methods whilst maintaining the order of magnitude of CDFT reference data. Comparison of kMC simulations with and without intramolecular charge transfer within the P3HT oligomers clearly reveal the importance of intramolecular contributions to the overall charge carrier mobility. The analysis of low resistance pathways established useful correlations between hole transport efficiency and local morphology. In particular, it revealed that both donor and acceptor species contribute to efficient hole transport. Hence, a good stacking behaviour is required not only inside the respective D and A domains, but also at the interfaces. This knowledge could be useful to guide the design of future D/A blends. A mild influence of annealing treatments on the charge carrier mobility was found.
