    , Accepted 21st July 2022First published on 4th August 2022AbstractVisible light as an excitation source is much more accessible than ultraviolet light, but the synthesis of lanthanide complex (LnC) films with visible-light excitation and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is still a challenge. We report herein a visible light excitable and highly luminescent film by incorporation of a europium(III) (Eu3+) tetrakis(β-diketonate) complex with tetraphenylphosphonium as a counterion into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. Excellent compatibility between the complex and PMMA was observed, resulting in the PMMA film with an 80 wt% loading content of the complex exhibiting a PLQY of up to 62.5% and a high transparency of ∼89%. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the luminescent film was used to fabricate luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), in which the strong luminescence effect of the luminescent film is responsible for its optical conversion efficiency of 1.46% with a G of 1.87. This study presents a new model system for the development of highly transparent LSCs by utilizing high loading contents of LnCs.
1. Introduction
During the past several decades, luminescent lanthanide complexes (LnCs) have aroused great interest due to their unique optical properties such as narrow-band spectrum, large Stokes shift, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and long radiative lifetimes of the excited state.1,2 The promising luminescence of LnCs originates from the parity-forbidden f–f transition of lanthanide ions and the efficient light harvesting and effective sensitizing capacity endowed by the coordinated organic ligands.3–5 Consequently, luminescent LnCs show great potential in a wide variety of photonic applications, such as organic LEDs, phosphors for LEDs, light conversion films for photovoltaic devices, and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs).6–8 Despite the great progress made in the research fields of luminescent LnCs, very few LnCs materials allowing visible light excitation have been reported.9–11 In all of these examples, the increase of the lanthanide sensitization in the visible spectral region was usually realized through exploration of ligand design. For example, Fu et al. firstly synthesized the Dpbt ligand by incorporating N,N-dialkyl aniline moieties into dipyrazolyltriazine systems and utilized it for the development of a new europium(III) (Eu3+) β-diketonate complex that extends the excitation wavelength to the visible range.10 Francis et al. reported an efficient visible-light-excitable Eu3+ complex by employing the 2,2′-dipyridyl N,N′-dioxide (bpyO2) ligand for OLED application.11 Nevertheless, such organic ligands require extensive synthesis efforts and no definitive solution tunes the triplet excited state energy levels of ligands to match the excited state energy of lanthanides. In addition, to realize the photonic applications, e.g., as light conversion films for photovoltaic devices and LSC devices, luminescent LnCs must be incorporated into the polymer matrix.12 However, the doping contents of LnCs in the polymer matrix are usually quite low owing to the poor compatibility between the individual components, leading to the low luminescence of the LnCs-containing polymers, which cannot meet the requirement of the practical application in the photonic devices. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve highly luminescent LnCs with visible-light excitation that can be doped into the polymer matrix with a high content.
Herein we reported characterization and photophysical studies of two Eu3+ tetrakis (β-diketonate) complexes with quaternary phosphoniums as counter cations: Eu(TTA)4TPP (1) and Eu(TTA)4MTPP (2) (TTA = thenoyltrifluoroacetone, TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium and MTPP = methyltriphenylphosphonium). The complexes show intense red emission when irradiated by UV light (λmax = 365 nm), and rather high PLQYs of 59.72% and 61.05% for complexes 1 and 2 were obtained, respectively. In particular, complex 1 possesses excellent compatibility with the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer, resulting in the PMMA film with an ultra-high loading content of the complex (80 wt%) yielding a visible excitation window (up to 500 nm) and exhibiting PLQYs of up to 62.5%, while maintaining high visible transparency (ca. 89% transmission in the visible spectral region). Bearing in mind the possible application, we further fabricated a thin-film LSC by drop-casting the PMMA film containing complex 1 onto a PMMA slab, where the strong luminescence effect of the luminescent film is responsible for the LSC's optical conversion efficiency of 1.46% with a G of 1.87.
2. Results and discussion
Complexes 1 and 2 were prepared by the reaction of tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl) or methyltriphenylphosphonium chloride (MTPPCl) with Eu(TTA)4Na (3) via the counterion-exchange method. The general formula of complexes 1 and 2 is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), which were fully characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). The crystal structure of complex 1 was obtained, which has a mononuclear structure, crystallizing in the triclinic space group P (Fig. 1 and Table S1, ESI†). In an asymmetric structure unit, Eu3+ is chelated by eight oxygen atoms of four TTA moieties and one TPP+ ion is located in the outer sphere acting as the counter ion. No solvent or water molecules are trapped in the crystal structure. The result reveals a 4:1 TTA/Eu structure of the complex with a coordination number of 8. The anions and cations interact via van der Waals and electrostatic forces.13 The possible π–π stacking mode is excluded during crystal packing, despite the presence of plentiful aromatic ring fragments in the structure (Fig. S4, ESI†). The selected crystallographic data are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2 was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S5a, ESI†). It can be found that they exhibit similar destruction trends and their starting decomposition temperatures are around 250 °C. However, complex 1 appears to be much more stable compared to complex 2 at the end of TGA, because TPPCl shows better stability compared to MTPPCl (Fig. S5b, ESI†).

The UV-visible absorption properties of complexes 1 and 2 were measured in ethanol solution. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), both complexes mainly consist of a shoulder perk at 234 nm ascribed to the π–π* electronic transitions from TPP+ (MTPP+) and two broad bands with a maximum in intensity at around 267 and 339 nm assigned to the π–π* electronic transitions of TTA, respectively. Compared to the uncomplexed TTA ligand, the absorption maximum shifts from 326 nm to 339 nm in the case of complexes 1 and 2, indicating the formation of coordination bonds between TTA and Eu3+.14,15
The photophysical properties of complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state were investigated, while the photoluminescence features of complex 3 in the solid state were studied as a control. As shown in Fig. 2a, their excitation spectra obtained by monitoring the characteristic 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ show a broad band in the range of 245–455 nm ascribed to the π–π* electronic transitions of the TTA ligand and a narrow band at 465 nm corresponding to the Eu3+ ion sharp absorption lines. The broad band dominates the whole excitation spectrum, indicating that the sensitization via the excited states of the ligands is more efficient than the Eu3+ direct excitation. Compared to the excitation spectrum of complex 3, the absorption bands corresponding to the organic ligand for complexes 1 and 2 shift to the short wavelength region, indicating the changed environment of Eu3+.16
 Fig. 2  (a) Excitation spectra, (b) emission spectra and (c) luminescence decay curves of complexes 1, 2 and 3. 
The emission spectra of complexes 1–3 display five sharp peaks at around 580, 593, 613, 655 and 701 nm, assigned to the well-known transitions of 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4)17,18 (Fig. 2b). Among the peaks, 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0, 3) transitions are very weak, as they are strictly forbidden according to Judd–Ofelt theory. Only one weak peak for 5D0 → 7F0 is an indication that all the Eu3+ ions occupy a single site of the point group symmetry Cs, Cn or Cnv. The 5D0 → 7F1 transition is a magnetic transition, almost independent of the Eu3+ symmetry. The most intense 5D0 → 7F2 peak is sensitive to the symmetry of the coordination sphere, dominating the whole emission spectrum. It accounts for the observed red light and points to a low site symmetry around Eu3+ without an inversion center. The 5D0 → 7F1 transitions of complexes 1 and 2 show one sharp line, while the 5D0 → 7F1 transition of complex 3 displays splitting, which could be explained by the environment around the central Eu3+.19 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to further confirm the chemical state of Eu in the coordination unit. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3 (ESI†), the binding energy of Eu3+ in complexes 1 and 2 decreases with respect to 3, indicating that TPP+ or MTPP+ leads to an increase of the electron cloud density in the complexes, which provides evidence for the change in the environment of Eu3+. In addition, the intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions in the complexes was estimated for the symmetry of the coordination sphere.20 For complex 3, the intensity ratio of 5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F1 is 12.9. This intensity ratio increases to 30.8 and 30.0 for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. Together, these results suggest that the substitution of Na+ by TPP+ or MTPP+ ions leads to lower site symmetry around the Eu3+.
The 5D0 lifetimes of complexes 1–3 were measured by monitoring the emission decay curves within the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths (Fig. 2c). The luminescence decay curves can be fitted to a single exponential function yielding a lifetime of 0.436 ms for 1, 0.418 ms for 2 and 0.222 ms for 3, indicating all Eu3+ ions occupy the same average coordination environment, as already concluded from the analysis of the emission spectra.11 The PLQYs of complexes 1–3 were experimentally determined to be 59.72%, 61.05% and 21.58%, respectively. The luminescence lifetimes and PLQY values of complexes 1 and 2 are much higher than those of complex 3. Also, the radiative rate constant (kr) and nonradiative rate constant (knr) were estimated from the emission spectrum and lifetime of the 5D0 state21,22 (eqn (S1)–(S2), ESI†). Complex 3 exhibits a nearly doubled knr value compared with those of complexes 1 and 2 (Table S4, ESI†). This means that TPP+ or MTPP+ ions reduce the possibility of energy transfer between Eu3+–Eu3+ as a non-radiative process. The difference in luminescence properties between complexes 1, 2 and 3 can be attributed to the steric effects of counterions. We have found that the structure of the Ln3+ tetrakis(β-diketonate) complex with Na+ ions as counterions is built through 1D polymeric chains with alternating Na+ and [Ln(β-diketonate)4]− units,23–25 whereas Ln3+ tetrakis(β-diketonate) complexes with large size counterions have a loose-packing pattern in a crystal lattice.26,27 Therefore, the steric effects of counterions lead to not only the change of the Eu3+ coordination environment, but also the avoidance of molecular aggregation-induced luminescence quenching.28
To realize the photonic applications, the luminescent films were prepared by dissolving PMMA in DMF in the presence of different contents of complex 1 in mass, followed by drop-casting on a PMMA slab, and their photophysical properties were investigated on the PMMA slab. Complex 1 shows excellent compatibility with PMMA, indicating that the transmittance of the luminescent film in the visible region can be ca. 89% even when the loading contents are high up to 80 wt% as shown in Fig. 3a. The sharp line-like signals noted in the luminescent films correspond to the intra-f6 transitions of Eu3+. Moreover, the transmittance of the luminescent films decreases slightly with the increase of complex 1 loading content in the PMMA film, from 94% for 5 wt% to 89% for 80 wt%, attributed to the tinting caused by the high loading contents (Fig. 3a inset). Also, Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the SEM images of the luminescent films with different contents of complex 1, which has a smooth surface morphology, indicating the homogenous distribution of complex 1 in the PMMA film, without any evidence of impurities in it. The homogenous distribution of complex 1 in the PMMA matrix can also be confirmed by EDS mapping, and its thickness is around 221 μm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the luminescent films with different contents of complex 1 show a broadened peak corresponding to the PMMA amorphous phase, whereas the crystalline region of complex 1 is not found (Fig. 3b). It is speculated that the long-range order structure of complex 1 is absent in the PMMA matrix, and complex 1 is found free as an anion ([Eu(TTA)4]−) and a cation (TPP+). The diffraction peak of PMMA centered at 13.8° shifts to higher angles and decreases in intensity at doping contents ranging from 5 wt% to 80 wt%, suggesting a potential influence of complex 1 on the PMMA matrix, maybe due to the formation of aggregates ([Eu(TTA)4]−) disturbing the long range regularity of PMMA. Another important observation from the FT-IR data is that the doping of complex 1 has a negligible effect on the absorption bands of the PMMA polymer film. This result indicates that the interaction between the Eu3+ ions and the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group in the PMMA backbone was absent (Fig. S9, ESI†).

The obtained luminescent film on the PMMA slab is highly luminescent, which can be verified by the bright red emission even in daylight as shown in Fig. 3c, and the concentrated red light on the edge can be easily discerned. Very bright red emission was observed when the luminescent film was irradiated by a UV lamp (λmax = 365 nm) as vividly shown in the inset of Fig. 3e. The excitation spectra are shown in Fig. 3d. Interestingly and unprecedentedly, the excitation spectra of the luminescence films induce a bathochromic shift with the increase of the complex content in PMMA. The luminescent film with a complex 1 loading content of 80 wt% presents a visible-light-excitable window (200–500 nm). The highly possible reason for the red shift of excitation spectra is molecular aggregation of [Eu(TTA)4]− in PMMA, in which the molecular stacking of [Eu(TTA)4]− tends to be coplanar, leading to a higher degree of exciton delocalization.29–31 This hypothesis can be further demonstrated by comparing the excitation spectra of complex 3 and the luminescent film with a complex 1 loading content of 80 wt%, in which their excitation profiles are similar. According to the analysis of the steric effects of counterions, the observed bathochromic shift in complex 3 with respect to complex 1 is due to the aggregation of [Eu(TTA)4]−. Therefore, the high loading content-induced red-shift in the excitation spectrum indicates that the aggregation of [Eu(TTA)4]− in PMMA was presented. With regard to the role of TPP+ in PMMA, it greatly facilitates the compatibility between complex 1 and PMMA. When doping complex 3 in PMMA, decreased compatibility between them can be observed (Fig. S10, ESI†), which in turn indicates the effectiveness of TPP+ in PMMA. In fact, the incorporation of complex 2 into PMMA also shows excellent compatibility and the bathochromic shift of the excitation maximum with increasing complex loading (Fig. S11, ESI†). These results highlight the interest of using TPP+ or MTPP+ as counterions to afford excellent compatibility of the complexes with PMMA showing interesting photophysical properties.
The room temperature emission spectra of luminescent films with different contents of complex 1 under excitation at the maximum of the broad ligand band were also recorded (Fig. 3e). Their emission profiles have no significant changes compared with complex 1. In the case of luminescent films with different contents of complex 1, their emission intensity increases continuously as the complex 1 loading content is increased from 1 wt% to 80 wt% (Fig. 3e and Fig. S12, ESI†). Upon excitation in the bands ranging from 380 to 500 nm, the emission spectra of the luminescent films with a complex 1 loading content of 80 wt% show the characteristic transitions (5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4)) of Eu3+ ions (Fig. S13, ESI†), further demonstrating that the luminescent film can be excited by visible light. In addition, the values of both the luminescence lifetime and the PLQY (within an experimental error of 10%) for luminescent films with different contents of complex 1 are almost in accordance with those found for complex 1 in the solid state (Fig. 3f and Table S5, ESI†), suggesting that the PMMA matrixes have no influence on the sensitization process of the Eu3+ ions. These results indicate that no molecular aggregation-induced luminescence quenching occurred in the luminescent films, despite the very high doping content of complex 1. This phenomenon contradicts the steric effects, implying that PMMA plays a significant role. We speculate that [Eu(TTA)4]− was wrapped by PMMA, therefore avoiding aggregation-induced luminescence quenching. It should be emphasized that the red shift of excitation peaks and the increased luminescence intensity are very favorable for LSC to make use of sunlight. To the best of our knowledge, incorporation of LnCs into the polymer matrix even with an 80 wt% loading content exhibiting a PLQY of up to 62.5% and a high transmission of 89% in the visible spectral region is first reported, which may open a new paradigm for LSC fabrication.
The possible application of the luminescent film on the LSC was studied. Fig. 4a shows the spectral distribution of the LSC (80 wt% loading content of complex 1) and the sunlight at Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G), where the shadowed area represents the available sunlight for the LSC. In order to further evaluate the electrical performance of the LSC architectures with excellent optical properties, a commercial silicon solar cell masked by black paper to form an outlet with an active area of 1.2 cm2 was coupled with one side of the LSC (Fig. S14, ESI†). The working principle of the LSC is illustrated in Fig. 4b. The silicon solar cell used in the LSC reveals an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.5 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 45.24 mA·cm–2, a fill factor (FF) of 36.73%, and a corresponding PCE of 8.31% (Fig. 4c). When the top surface of the LSC was exposed to AM 1.5G illumination, the concentrated red light emitted from the edges is more evident (Fig. 4c inset). The photovoltaic performance of the LSC with different contents of complex 1 (active area: 9 cm2) integrated with the silicon solar cell is shown in Fig. S15 and Table S6 (ESI†), in which we observed a significantly enhanced JSC by increasing the loading content of complex 1, indicating that high loading contents of complex 1 would facilitate the solar energy harvesting. Another commonly used parameter to evaluate the performance of the LSC is optical conversion efficiency, ηopt, which is defined using the following equation:32  where Pout represents the power from the slab edge of the LSC and Pin is the input power coming in through the top surface of the LSC. ILSC is the short circuit current from the silicon solar cell coupled with the LSC. ISC is the short-circuit current of a solar cell directly illuminated by a solar simulator. G is the geometrical factor, determined by the ratio between the surface and edge areas of the LSC. The experimental ηopt determined in the LSC (for 80 wt% of complex 1) is 5.40% with a G factor of 1.87 (Fig. 4c). It should be noted that part of the photovoltaic contribution is indeed brought by the PMMA slab in this system. Compared to the PMMA substrate, the ηopt of the LSC is improved by 1.46%, which can be attributed to the contribution of the luminescent film. The variation of J–V curves with different illumination areas was also investigated as shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The output power (Pout) extracted from them shows a linear relationship as the increase of coverage area because of the zero-reabsorption loss of complex 1 (Fig. 4d).33,34 This behavior suggests that all portions of the LSC surface contribute nearly equally to its total power output, favorable for the fabrication of the large-area LSC.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, luminescent Eu3+ complexes 1 and 2 were synthesized, and the luminescence properties of complex 1 in PMMA thin films were studied. Substitution of the Na+ counterion of the Eu3+-tetrakis-TTA by TPP+ or MTPP+ results in promoted luminescence performance, with the PLQY at around 60%. A model and possible mechanism for the steric effects of the counterion were suggested. When complex 1 was doped into a PMMA thin film at 80 wt% loading content, the luminescent film exhibited a visible-light excitable range, pointing to an exceptionally high PLQY (over 60%) and 89% transmission. On this basis, a prototype LSC integrated with the luminescent film was fabricated, in which the strong luminescence effect of the luminescent film is responsible for its optical conversion efficiency of 1.46% with a G of 1.87.
4. Experimental section
Materials
2-Thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl) and methyltriphenylphosphonium chloride (MTPPCl) were purchased from Aladdin. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was obtained from J&K. Europium(III) acetate hydrate (99.9%) was purchased from Beijing HWRK Chemical Co. Ltd. Ethanol and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory. All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification.
Synthesis of complexes [Eu(TTA)4]TPP (1) and [Eu(TTA)4]MTPP (2)
0.5 mmol of the TTA ligand was reacted with 0.5 mmol of NaOH in ethanol. A solution of EuCl3 (0.1 mmol) in ethanol was dropwise added into the above solution with constant stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. Afterwards, TPPCl or MTPPCl (0.1 mmol) in aqueous solution was added. After reaction for 4 h, the complexes were extracted with water. The extract was filtered, washed several times with H2O, and dried in vacuo. The crystal of complex 1 was obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of the complex in methanol.
Fabrication of the LSC in the film configuration
1 g of PMMA powder was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF solvent at 60 °C for 30 minutes with stirring. Afterwards, an appropriate amount of the above solution was drop-coated on a PMMA slab (3 × 3 × 0.4 cm) in the presence of a desirable content of complex 1. Then, the PMMA slab was placed on a heating plate at 80 °C for slow evaporation of the solvent, leading to transparent film formation.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 using a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer. Crystal data were collected on a Rigaku XtaLAB PRO MM007 DW diffractometer at 293(2) K, 298(2) K and 113(2) K with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the φ and ω scan modes. Luminescence data were obtained using an Edinburgh Instruments spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared spectra were obtained on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrophotometer by using pressed KBr pellets for solid samples ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1. Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar Vario EL. The UV absorbance spectra of the samples were measured with an Agilent Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrometer. Surface analysis was conducted with an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis using an SDT Q600 TGA in ambient air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The J–V characterization was performed using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (7ISO503A, Sofn Instruments). For the characterization of the photovoltaic solar cell performance, the LSCs (with an active area of 9 cm2) were directly coated on a monocrystalline silicon solar cell (with an active area of 1.2 cm2).
