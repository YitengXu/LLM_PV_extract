    , Accepted 15th October 2018First published on 16th October 2018AbstractThe logical linking of electron-rich and electron-deficient fragments has brought forth considerable advances in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic dye-sensitized solar cells in the past decade. In this work, we construct a 5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (BTETA) segment and employ it as the electron acceptor to exploit a donor–acceptor sensitizer in combination with the triarylamine-cyclopentadithiophene electron donor. With respect to its congener based on the efficient benzothiadiazole-benzoic acid (BTBA) acceptor, this employment of more electron-deficient acceptor BTETA does not alter the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) too much, but leads to an obviously downward displacement of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. The resultant energy-gap shrinkage endows the new dye with a red-shifted absorption peak concomitant with a higher molar absorption coefficient, while this style of downward movement of the LUMO energy level does not exert a distinct impact on the electron injection efficiency from photoexcited dye molecules into titania, which endows the new dye with an enhanced photocurrent output, bringing forth an efficiency improvement up to 12.0% under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 conditions.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 have large potential to achieve the transformation of solar-to-electricity at a low cost, owing to their abundant raw materials and simple manufacture technologies.2 In the past decade, most of the attention in this field has focused on the exploration of high absorption coefficient photosensitizers.3–17 Apart from traditional organometallic dyes such as polypyridine ruthenium complexes3–5,18 and Zn–porphyrin complexes,7,8,19 numerous endeavours have been devoted to the exploration of a great variety of donor–acceptor (D/A) organic sensitizers,9–17 owing to their abundance of raw materials, flexibility of molecular design and gorgeousness of colours, achieving a steady increase in efficiency and stability.20–24
Plenty of donors have been employed to synthesize D/A organic sensitizers based on the traditional cyanoacrylic acid (CA) acceptor.25–28 However, most of the newly developed D/A dyes with a low optical gap based on the CA acceptor cannot endow the device with high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs)29–32 due to the critical kinetic limitations such as exciton dissociation,33–35 which probably originates from the short lifetime of the singlet excited state for organic dyes. In this context, it has been demonstrated that replacing CA with more electron-deficient benzothiadiazole-benzoic acid (BTBA) for organic dyes can result in energy-gap shrinkage concomitant with a prolonged lifetime of the excited state,36 which is highly desirable for efficient DSCs. Based on the BTBA acceptor in combination with the triarylamine-cyclopentadithiophene (TPACPDT) electron donor, a high absorption coefficient organic dye C25822 (Fig. 1a) has been successfully prepared, which can achieve over 11% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) conditions. However, there is a large torsion angle between benzothiadiazole (BT) and benzoic acid (BA) as shown in Fig. S1,† which limits the delocalization of frontier molecular orbitals and the diminution of the optical gap.

(b) Energy-level evolution from segments of the electron donor (green) and electron acceptors (purple and blue) to dye molecules (orange and red) derived from the theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. 
It is known that triple-bond insertion between aromatic rings, in general, reduces the torsion angle by limiting the steric interactions.37 Moreover, the replacement of benzene with thiophene can also generally reduce the torsion angle between aromatic rings and enhance the delocalization of frontier molecular orbitals.38 On the basis of this analysis, in this contribution, we will extend this work by replacing BA with thiophenezoic acid (TA) and inserting a triple-bond between BT and TA, to synthesize a more electron-deficient 5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)thiophene-2-carboxylic acid segment (BTETA) and employ it as the electron acceptor of a new dye coded HW-4 (Fig. 1a), which features a more coplanar skeleton with respect to its counterpart with the BTBA acceptor (Fig. S1†). This new dye also displays a red-shifted absorption peak compared to its analog24 with a benzene ring instead of thiophene (Fig. S2†), which is consistent with our anticipation. We will further systematically compare its energy level, light-harvesting, charge generation, and photovoltaic characteristics with those of the reference dye C258 based on the efficient BTBA acceptor.
Results and discussion
In the beginning, we first scrutinized the energy-level evolution from segments of the electron donor and electron acceptors to D/A dye molecules to disclose the acceptor related intrinsic electronic properties by the quantum-chemical calculation. In Fig. 1b, we present the relative frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the two acceptors BTBA and BTETA and the donor TPACPDT as well as the corresponding D/A dyes. It is clear from Fig. 1b that both C258 and HW-4 feature similar energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) with respect to the corresponding electron donor of TPACPDT and electron acceptor of BTBA or BTETA, indicating that the frontier-orbital interactions between the donor and acceptor in these D/A molecules are weak. This phenomenon probably results from the large aromaticity of the benzene ring in the BT unit,39 which is different from the conventional organic dyes with CA as the acceptor.40 In addition, the replacement of BTBA with more electron-deficient BTETA brings forth an obviously downward displacement of the LUMO energy level, leading to an energy-gap shrinkage from C258 to HW-4.
We further evaluated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of C258 and HW-4 by measuring cyclic voltammograms of C258 and HW-4 with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent in a wide potential window (PW) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox (Fig. 2a). Decamethylferrocene (DMFc) was added as the internal reference and the potentials were further calibrated with the standard redox couple ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels could be calculated via the equation E = −4.88 − Eonset, where Eonset represents the onset oxidation or reduction potential of a sensitizer at the ground state, respectively, and the values are compiled in Table 1. HW-4 possesses a similar energy level of the HOMO (−4.94 eV vs. vacuum) and an obviously downward displacement of the LUMO energy level (−3.38 eV vs. vacuum) with respect to those of C258 (HOMO: −4.93 eV vs. vacuum; LUMO: −3.24 eV vs. vacuum), giving an energy-gap shrinkage by 0.13 eV. The relative change tendencies of experimentally measured energy levels and energy gaps of these two dyes are well consistent with the aforementioned prediction based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

In order to preliminarily evaluate the application prospect of HW-4 as a photosensitizer in DSCs, we first inspected the light-harvesting capacity of HW-4 at the molecular level by recording the electronic absorption spectra of diluted THF solutions of C258 and HW-4 (Fig. 2b). The detailed parameters are collected in Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 2b, an obviously red-shifted maximum absorption wavelength (λMEASABS) of 579 nm was measured for HW-4 with the BTETA acceptor, compared to that of 546 nm for C258 based on the BTBA acceptor, which originates from the energy-gap shrinkage during the acceptor alteration. Moreover, the molar absorption coefficient (εMEAS) at the λMEASABS increases from 33.8 × 103 to 41.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1 along with the acceptor transformation from BTBA to BTETA. Taking into account the molecular structure related intermolecular interaction on the surface of the semiconductor, which is the practical status for these sensitizers in DSCs, we further evaluated the light-harvesting capacity of the dye-coated titania film in conjunction with a tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II)/(III) redox couple (Co-bpy, for details see the Experimental section) which was used in the following device studies via measuring the light-harvesting yield (ϕLH) as a function of wavelength. As explicitly depicted in Fig. 2c, both these dyes display saturated light-harvesting in a broad region, which is closely related to the high molar absorption coefficient of these two sensitizers. In comparison with the titania film grafted with C258, the HW-4 coated titania film also presents augmented light-harvesting at a desirable longer wavelength similar to that observed in dye diluted THF solutions.
To gain insight into the acceptor correlated electron absorption spectra, we performed the calculation of the vertical singlet electronic transitions for these two sensitizers in THF solvent based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method. The simulated maximum absorption wavelengths (λTD-CAMABS) and oscillator strengths (f) as well as the corresponding assignments for the S0 → S1 transition are also incorporated into Table 1. The calculated results can nicely reproduce the experimentally observed red-shifted λMEASABS and increased εMEAS from C258 to HW-4. Note that the S0 → S1 transitions of both C258 and HW-4 mainly originate from the HOMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO. We further inspected the distribution of the S0 → S1 transition-involved frontier molecular orbitals for C258 and HW-4 sensitizers. As presented in Fig. 3, both of the HOMO and HOMO−1 in these two molecules are mainly localized over the TPACPDT donor skeleton, while the LUMOs of C258 and HW-4 are predominantly localized over the respective acceptor fragments, manifesting that the S0 → S1 vertical electronic transitions for both dyes display a clear characteristic of intramolecular charge transfer.

The energy-offset between the LUMO energy level of the photosensitizer and the conduction-band edge of the titania film plays a pivotal role in determining the dynamic process of electron injection.33–35 Thereby, to check out the potential influence of shifting the LUMO energy level on the electron injection yield (ϕEI), we recorded the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) traces of dye-grafted alumina and titania films by use of the time-correlated single photon counting technique (TCSPC).41,42 Herein, alumina was selected as a reference due to the absence of energy offset for electron injection at the dye/alumina interface. Thereby, the dynamic photoluminescence (PL) decays of dye coated alumina (blue curves) in Fig. 4 can be ascribed to the deactivation of optically generated excited states for these two dyes via radiative and nonradiative processes. There are significantly accelerated PL decays (red curves) along with the oxide substrate transformation from alumina to titania, indicating the occurrence of swift electron injection from electronical excited-states to the titania due to the favourable energy-offset at the dye/titania interface. The electron injection yields can be roughly calculated via the equation ϕEI = 1 − IT/IA, where IT and IA are the respective integrals under PL traces of titania (magenta curves in Fig. 4) and alumina films (green curves in Fig. 4), respectively, being 96% for C258 and 95% for HW-4, indicating that the downward shifting of the LUMO energy level along with the switch of the acceptor from BTBA to BTETA does not exert perceptible influence on the electron injection yield, which may be attributed to the maintained long excited state lifetime during the energy-gap reduction (Fig. S3†).
 Fig. 4  Time-correlated photoluminescences (PL) of dyed alumina (blue curves) and titania (red curves) films infiltrated with a Co-bpy electrolyte: (a) C258 and (b) HW-4. PL intensities (I) of alumina and titania samples were first calibrated by considering the absorbances at 482 nm, and then normalized according to the PL maximum of a corresponding alumina sample (IMAX,A). Integrals under PL traces (S) of alumina (green curves) and titania (magenta curves) samples were normalized in terms of the global PL integral (SG,A) of a corresponding alumina film. Excitation wavelength: 482 nm; detection wavelength: 750 nm. IRF is also included (gray curves). 
The performance of HW-4 as a photosensitizer material in DSCs has been further evaluated by fabricating DSC devices based on a tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II)/(III) redox couple in acetonitrile. The details of device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. The EQE as a function of wavelength was first recorded as presented in Fig. 5a. Note that both of the cells with C258 and HW-4 exhibit a broad plateau with a similar EQE summit of ∼90%. The photosensitizer transformation from C258 to HW-4 brings forth ∼30 nm red-shifting of the photocurrent onset wavelength, owing to the augmented absorption coefficient of HW-4 at a desirable longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 2c.

An antireflection film was laminated on top of DSCs. The aperture area of the metal mask is 0.160 cm2. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characters of DSCs with C258 and HW-4 were further measured at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 2. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of the device with C258 are 18.07 mA cm−2, 866 mV and 71.0%, respectively, affording a PCE of 11.1% which is similar to a previous report.22 In good agreement with the preceding EQE measurements, the cell with HW-4 displays an obviously larger JSC of 20.17 mA cm−2, which overcompensates the disadvantageous impact of reduced VOC from 866 to 838 mV, bringing forth an efficiency improvement up to 12.0%. Note that the PCE of the device based on the standard N719 dye under the same conditions is 8.3%.

It is well known that the JSC can be roughly proportional to the flux of photogenerated carriers because the measurement of JSC is performed at a very low electron density in the titania film where the charge recombination flux can be substantially attenuated. Thereby, we first recorded J–V curves at various light intensities to understand the acceptor related VOC variation. Plots of VOC as a function of JSC are presented in Fig. 6a. It is clear that the HW-4 cell displays an obviously lower VOC than C258 at a given JSC. Considering the same redox electrolyte used in DSCs with these two dyes, the VOC variation should stem from the shifting of the electron quasi-Fermi-level in titania, which inherently originates from a displacement of the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and/or an undulation of electron density. For an invariable photogenerated carrier flux, the electron density depends on the interfacial charge recombination rate between the electrons in titania and the oxidizing agent in electrolytes and/or oxidized dye.43–46 Thereby, we further carried out charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements to attain an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic origins of acceptor related VOC variation. As presented in Fig. 6b, both the C258 and HW-4 cells exhibit similar charges extracted from titania (QCE) at the same potential bias, indicating that the photosensitizer transformation from C258 to HW-4 does not have a distinct influence on the conduction-band edge of titania and the distribution of trap states of titania compared with the Fermi-level of the electrolyte.

On the other hand, as presented in Fig. 6c, the HW-4 cell displays an obviously shorter half-lifetime (tTPD1/2) of charge recombination with respect to the C258 counterpart at a given QCE, giving a distinct clue on the aforementioned photovoltage dissimilarity at a given JSC. The dye loading amounts (Cm) on the surface of the mesoporous titania film were further estimated by visible spectrometry to understand the dye structure related origin of interfacial charge recombination, being 2.2 × 10−8 and 3.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C258 and HW-4, respectively. The larger dye loading amount for HW-4 on the titania surface may originate from its more coplanar skeleton (Fig. S1†) with respect to C258, which could signify a higher propensity of dye molecules to form aggregates on the titania surface. It is noted that the favorable influence of increased Cm on the voltage47 in the HW-4 cell is not reflected, which is similar to the observation in previous studies.22,48 This phenomenon could originate from the porous features of the organic molecule layer on the titania surface. The more three-dimensional structure for C258 could restrain the adverse interfacial charge recombination with medium-sized redox couples,49–52 which is also observed in dark current density–voltage (Fig. 5b) and aforementioned TPD measurements, accounting for the higher VOC of C258 with respect to HW-4.
Conclusions
To summarize, we have synthesized a new organic sensitizer based on the 5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)thiophene-2-carboxylic acid acceptor, which displays a power conversion efficiency of 12.0% under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 conditions. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements have shown that the replacement of the efficient benzothiadiazole-benzoic acid acceptor with this more electron-deficient moiety for dye molecules brings forth a narrowed energy-gap and red-shifted absorption peak, without impacting the exciton dissociation efficiency at the dye/titania interface as disclosed in transient emission measurements. We have also observed the breakdown of the positive correlation between dye loading amounts on the surface of titania and photovoltage of DSCs, suggesting the crucial role of the giant three-dimensional structure in controlling the interfacial charge recombination, which should be seriously considered in the design of further organic sensitizers with a broad spectral response to solar irradiance for more efficient DSCs.

In a three-neck flame-dried round-bottom flask was dissolved 3 (314 mg, 0.40 mmol) in THF (10 mL) and cooled to −78 °C using a dry ethanol cold bath. Under argon, n-BuLi (0.38 mL, 1.6 M in hexanes, 0.60 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture, which was stirred for 0.5 h at −78 °C. After trimethylstannyl chloride (120 mg, 0.60 mmol) was added in one portion via syringe, the mixture was slowly warmed and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Water was slowly added to terminate the reaction and the mixture was extracted three times with diethyl ether before the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.

In a dried Schlenk tube were dissolved organostannane and 2 (315 mg, 0.80 mmol) in toluene (10 mL). Then Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (34 mg, 0.048 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was refluxed for 6 h. Water was added to terminate the reaction and the mixture was extracted three times with chloroform before the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After solvent removal under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (toluene/petroleum ether 60–90 °C, 2/1, v/v) on silica gel to yield a black powder as the desired ethyl ester.

Computational details
The ground state geometries were optimized employing the hybrid B3LYP54 functional and the vertical excitation energies were simulated by the long-range corrected (LRC) CAM-B3LYP functional,55 which has significant improvements on the description of the charge-transfer transition.56,57 Frequency analysis was also performed during the structural optimization to ensure that there is no imaginary frequency. The 6-311G(d,p) basis set was selected for all the calculations. The solvent effect of THF on the geometry has been simulated by the C-PCM method.58 All calculations were carried out with Gaussian 09 program packages.59
Device fabrication
A double layer titania film made by screen-printing on a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick) was employed as the negative electrode for DSCs presented in this paper. A 4.5 μm-thick translucent layer based on 25 nm sized titania particles was first deposited on an FTO glass and further covered with a 5 μm-thick light-scattering layer of 350–450 nm sized titania particles (WER4-O, Dyesol). Preparation procedures of titania nanocrystals, screen-printing pastes, and nanostructured titania films were very similar to those described in a previous paper.60 A circular titania electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was dye-loaded by immersing it into a 150 μM dye solution in the mixed solvent of chloroform and ethanol (v/v, 1/9) involving 300 μM SC-4 coadsorbent. A 25 μm-thick Surlyn ring was heated at 130 °C to adhere a dyed titania electrode and an Au/Cr coated FTO (NSG, TEC7, 2.2 mm) electrode, under a suitable mechanical pressure. The infiltrated electrolyte is composed of 0.375 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II) di(bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), 0.075 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile.
Instrumentation
Cyclic voltammograms of dye solutions were measured with a CHI660C electrochemical workstation by using a three-electrode electrolytic cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum gauze counter electrode, and a silver wire quasi-reference electrode. In our nonaqueous electrochemical measurements, a low potential sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 was used and even so an iR drop was compensated. Electrochemically reversible decamethylferrocene (DMFc) was employed as the internal reference, which has a more suitable redox potential than ferrocene (Fc) for metal-free DSC dyes. The formal redox potential dissimilarity between DMFc and Fc in THF was measured, being 0.489 V. We performed electronic absorption measurements on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. Details of EQE, J–V, CE and TPD measurements can be found in a previous publication.61
