We improved the electrochemical performance of bismuth molybdate by rare earth doping and rGO modification, and it can potentially be a desirable electrode material.
1. Introduction
Global energy consumption is substantially increasing in response to the modern economy and the rapid increase in population. With increasing concerns regarding environmental pollution due to the inordinate use of fossil fuels, researchers are probing alternative energy storage and conversion devices.1 Consequently, a wide range of energy storage systems has been investigated, including batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical supercapacitors. Supercapacitors with enhanced power density and capacitance, extended cycle stability, and rapid charge and discharge rates that are inexpensive as well as nontoxic are viable candidates for sustainable power storage systems.2–5 However, there are limits to the applications of supercapacitors due to their lower energy density when compared to batteries, which have drawbacks such as overheating problems, lower cyclic performance, and restricted power performance.6,7
There are two categories of ultracapacitors, which are commonly known as supercapacitors: (i) electric double layer (EDLC), where storing the energy occurs due to charge accumulation at the electrodes and electrolyte interface (non-faradaic process), and (ii) pseudocapacitors, which encounter reversible oxidation and reduction reactions (faradaic process).8,9 Supercapacitor commercialization will rapidly occur if an increase in their energy density can be achieved that is compatible with their sustainable life cycle. There is a demand for ideal electrode materials to overcome their limitations. Carbon,10 transition metal oxides,11 metal sulfides,12 transition metal dichalcogenides,13 and polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene)14 have all been thoroughly examined as electrode materials for energy storage. Because of their porous surface area, supercapacitors based on carbon are inexpensive, with extended lifetimes and rapid charge kinetics that enhance their electrochemical behaviour.15,16
Bismuth molybdates are auruvillis family members with the molecular formula Bi2O3. xMoO3, where x = 1, 2, 3 corresponds to α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9 and γ-Bi2MoO6, which are three phases differing in their crystal structure that can incorporate perovskites such as (MoO4)2− and fluorite-like (Bi2O2)2+ slabs that are alternately positioned. Because of its exceptional features such as low melting point, thermal conductivity, and expansion, there is a broad array of applications for bismuth molybdate in energy storage,17 gas sensors,18 photocatalytic performance,19 and solar cells.20 Electrode materials, i.e., the as-synthesized materials that act as a host, undergo improved surface chemical states with enhanced conductivity and more optimal oxidation and reduction processes when doped with rare earth metals. Because of the rare earth metal complexes and their high ionic radius, doping them in active material could prompt lattice distortion, leading to lower crystallites and relatively low charge transfer resistance (Rct). Diminished Rct enhances the specific capacitance and performance rate with increased electrical conductivity.21–23 The gel matrix method, which is inexpensive, aids in producing high-purity material. A gel matrix achieves high uniformity at low temperature and pressure when produced using conventional synthesis techniques such as hydrothermal, wet chemical, and coprecipitation.24–26
Seevakan et al. prepared Bi2Mo2O9 spherical nanoparticles using a microwave combustion method. Excellent electrochemical behaviour of the synthesized particles was observed that enhanced the supercapacitor performance due to the specific capacitance (Cs) of 197 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 with a capacitive retention of approximately 93% after 1000 cycles.27
In this work, we used a gel combustion method to synthesize rare earth-doped bismuth molybdate (Bi2−xRExMo2O9) that was able to undergo reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-modified nano self-assembly (GM-Bi2−xRExMo2O9; RE = Ce and Gd). The purity and the phase confirmation of the prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The shape and surface morphology of the GM-Bi2−xRExMo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nano self-assembly was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy were used to examine the optical behaviour of the prepared products. An extensive analysis was performed on the impact of the rare earth-doped nano self-assembly. The electrochemical properties of the prepared nano self-assembly were explored through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. A well-formed electrode was used to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, and the electrochemical performance of the device was examined. Herein, cerium and gadolinium were incorporated as dopants to the nano self-assembly, which was expected to exhibit significant electrochemical behavior with sustainable cyclic stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), and citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O) were all acquired from Merck. Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) and ethylene glycol (C6H6O2) were procured from CDH India and Himedia, respectively. In this research, all compounds were used without further purification.
Gadolinium oxide powder (Gd2O3) purchased from Material, Technologie & Kristalle GmbH (MaTeck) was dissolved in nitric acid and gadolinium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O), and then recrystallized in deionized water for further use. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and activated carbon were used for the electrode preparation.
2.2 Synthesis of pure and rare-earth doped Bi2Mo2O9 nanoparticles
A sol–gel auto-combustion method was employed to produce Bi2Mo2O9 nanoparticles. The synthesis was accomplished in the following manner. The precursors used in this experiment were 1.75 mmol of bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), 0.25 mmol of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24), and 2 mmol of citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O). One mmol of (NH4)6Mo7O24 was dissolved in 45 mL of deionized water, and 5 mL of acetic acid was used to blend the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O with the prior molybdate compound. The preceding solution was sustained by continuous stirring for one hour to achieve a homogenous solution. The solution was then treated with the required volume of citric acid to generate the citrate complex. In addition, a few drops of ethylene glycol were added to enable the formation of gel in the solution.28 The obtained solution was then stirred at 80 °C for gel formation.
To initiate the combustion reaction, the obtained dried flakes were preheated at 300 °C. After thermal treatment, the samples were extracted and annealed at 550 °C to obtain a precise Bi2Mo2O9 phase.29–31 Next, 10% of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Gd(NO3)3·6H2O precursors were added to synthesize Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 by adopting the above procedure. The obtained rGO (30 mg) synthesized using a modified Hummers' method was incorporated in the synthesis of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 using a gel matrix method. The amounts of the precursors used for the synthesis of the samples appear in Table S1.† The prepared product was subsequently used for all ensuing characterizations.
2.3 Preparation of electrodes
A homogenous slurry of Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) was formulated by combining the solvent NMP with the active material, PVDF, and activated carbon (85%, 5%, and 10%), respectively, for the working electrode, which was coated on Ni-foam and thermally treated for 12 h at 70 °C. In addition, a separator-like filter paper was inserted between the positive (GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd)) and negative (activated carbon) electrodes to allow only the conduction of ions. From the two-electrode and three-electrode configuration, the electrochemical behaviour of the synthesized nano self-assembly was studied.
2.4 Instrumentation
The purity and phase confirmation of the prepared nanoparticles were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku, Japan), with a diffraction angle range of 5° to 55° at a scan rate of 2° per min. The Raman spectral studies of the pristine sample were conducted using a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR 800 Raman spectrometer under the excitation of 532 nm. The surface morphology and elemental mapping of the as-synthesized samples were examined with a ZEISS EVO 18 scanning electron microscope and a JEOL JEM-2100 Plus transmission electron microscope. The surface area and the pore size of the samples were examined using a Quantachrome Nova Station surface area and pore size analyzer and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The CV, GCD, and EIS electrochemical characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles were examined using a BioLogic SP-150 electrochemical workstation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis
The purity and the phase formation of the formulated Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nanoparticle self-assembly were examined using XRD. Fig. 1 depicts the comparative XRD pattern of pure Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd). The peaks obtained for the as-synthesized Bi2Mo2O9 agree with standard data. An intense double-shouldered peak was observed at 2θ = 28.11° for undoped Bi2Mo2O9 relative to the (2 3 0) plane. In addition, rare earth to the Bi2Mo2O9 double shoulder disappeared and became a single peak. Corresponding to the plane (−1 3 2), Bi2Mo2O9 exhibited a peak at 2θ = 29.3°. There were numerous small intense peaks at 2θ = 32°, 33.3°, and 46.84° for Bi2Mo2O9. When Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 were modified with rGO and thermally heated, these peaks disappeared. Variation in peaks might be the effect of dopants, and no impurity peaks were observed in the rGO-modified nano self-assembly. The samples with rGO annealed at 550 °C did not show any rGO peaks, indicating that rGO creates patterns in the self-assembly and evolved from the composite at high temperatures.

3.2 Raman spectral analysis
Raman spectral study aids in the analysis of structural characteristics of the material. The Raman spectra of the as-synthesized Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nano self-assembly ranging from 50 to 1000 cm−1 is shown in Fig. 2. For pure Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and the GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nanoparticle assembly, considerable peaks are observed within the range of 80 to 200 cm−1, with varying intensities of the peaks. The highly intense characteristic peak of Bi2Mo2O9 at 889.5 cm−1 became sharp upon further doping of rare earth, which was attributed to the bonds of MO5 moieties.32 The vibration of Mo–O stretching of orthorhombic MoO6 octahedrons produced the hump-like low-intensity peak at 779 cm−1. The peak centered at 289.8 cm−1 is ascribed to the bending mode of Eg vibrations. Peaks in the 180–500 cm−1 range are due to the MoO6 octahedral bending movement. The peaks above 600 cm−1 were due to Mo–O stretching, and below 400 cm−1, are in accordance with Mo– bonding.33 There was no abrupt change in peak shift with the addition of rGO and rare earth to Bi2Mo2O9.34,35

3.3 Morphological analysis
The surface morphology of the as-synthesized pure Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nano self-assembly was investigated using SEM. Fig. 3 showcases the SEM images of (a and b) Bi2Mo2O9, (d and e) Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (g and h) GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (j and k) Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and (m and n) GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9. The elemental composition of the prepared Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 particles was confirmed and is shown in Fig. 3(c, f, i, l, and o), respectively. The weight percentages of the samples appear in Table S2.† Pure Bi2Mo2O9 exhibited Porifera-shaped self-assembled nanoparticles with regular pores. On further addition of Ce and Gd, the shape became disturbed. The Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 enabled complete growth of the particles with some irregular hollow spheres.

When GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 was added, there was a hindrance in growth that subsequently created small voids. In addition to Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, hollow spheres on the smooth surface merged, disturbing the pattern's regularity. Higher magnification revealed that interlinked mesopores formed a tubular arrangement in the spheres with distorted edges. The GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 exhibited additional growth of mesoporous particles inside the hollow spheres, enhancing the material's active sites. The stacked layers of spheres containing indefinite porous particles in the fractured edges with increased active sites might be helpful in the reinforcement of the capacitive behavior of the nano self-assembly. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 4(a–c) thereby confirmed the clustered formation of Bi2Mo2O9 particles, and upon magnification, closed hexagonal-like structures packed together were observed. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of Bi2Mo2O9 depict interplanar spacing of approximately 3.03 Å, corresponding to the (023) plane. The structure of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 was distorted and indefinite, as shown in Fig. 4(d–f) and (g–i), respectively.

3.4 XPS analysis
The elemental composition of the pristine nano self-assembly was examined using XPS. The XPS spectra of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, O 1s, C 1s, Gd 4d, and Ce 3d of Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) are depicted in Fig. 5(a–f). The survey spectrum of the synthesized materials is represented in Fig. S1.† The spectrum confirmed that nano self-assembly successfully occurred with the elements Bi, Mo, O, C, Ce, and Gd without any impurities. The binding energies of the pure as-synthesized Bi2Mo2O9 are 165.1 and 159.8 eV, respectively, resulting from Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2, and there was a minimal difference in shift with the incorporation of Gd. The binding energies of the characteristic peaks Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo6+ species at 232.74 and 235.8 eV for Bi2Mo2O9, respectively, were shifted to 233.1 and 236.4 eV with the addition of Gd.36 The Gd 4d spectrum comprises a characteristic peak observed at 160.3 eV.
 Fig. 5  XPS graph of (a) Bi 4f, (b) Mo 3d, (c) O 1s, (d) Ce 3d, (e) Gd 4d, and (f) C 1s for Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9. 
The peaks at binding energy 903.11, 901.8, and 881.81 eV corresponded to Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2. Minor variations in binding energies of the peak reflected the successful incorporation of Gd and Ce.37 There was a characteristic O 1s peak at 530 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of Bi2Mo2O9, and the Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembly exhibited peaks at 531.3 eV. These peaks were assigned to the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl oxygen, respectively.38 The C 1s peak of GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 was much stronger than that of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 centered around 285.3 eV and was due to the CO bond, confirming the residence of residual carbon in the as-synthesized rGO-modified self-assembly.39
3.5 Electrochemical analysis
Cyclic voltammetry investigations of the as-synthesized samples were performed using 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at 5–100 mV s−1 scan rates with a potential window range of 0–0.5 V. Fig. 6(a–d) depicts the cyclic voltammograms of (a) Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (b) GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (c) Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and (d) GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9. During this investigation, all of these samples exhibited pseudocapacitive behavior throughout different scan rates in the half-cell test. This behaviour indicates the distinctive redox reactions that occur when ionic moieties pass through the electrolyte–electrode interface. It was also discovered that the redox peaks changed in size as the scan rate was altered, providing further evidence of charge polarization. There were different redox occurrences for all of these samples, as evidenced by their pseudocapacitive behaviour during the half-cell test at low and high scan rates. While observing redox potentials at lower and higher scan rates, Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 spotted oxidation at 0.29 V, reduction at 0.21 V, and Vlower = 0.08 V at 5 mV s−1. At a higher scan rate of 100 mV s−1, however, the same was observed at 0.34 V and 0.19 V, with Vhigher = 0.15 V. The scan rate difference (Vdifference = 0.15 − 0.08 V) indicted that the process is quasi-reversible (pseudocapacitive).40–42
 Fig. 6  CV graph of (a) Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (b) GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (c) Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and (d) GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9. 
Because of the increased width in the diffusion layer, the current responsiveness in the CV curve decreased at lower scan rates, whereas the opposite tendency was ascertained at increased scan rates. While scanning, peaks in redox potentials showed a linear correlation between the current and scan rate due to the diffusion-controlled process. During the redox reactions, OH− diffusion was distributed among the electrolyte–electrode surface.43–47 An in-depth comparison of these electrodes revealed that there was an extended surface area of the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembled electrode in the potential window of 0–0.5 V at the scan rate of 5–100 mV s−1. The incorporation of Ce caused this phenomenon in the nano self-assembled electrode. The smaller-sized Ce exhibited superior ionic conductivity. The addition of the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembly increased the number of electrochemically active sites, specific capacitance, ionic pathway, and overall electronic transport of the electrode material.
The specific capacitance ‘C’ can be calculated from CV graphs using the following equation: (1)where “Idv” denotes the integral area enclosed by the CV graph, “m” denotes the mass of the active material (g) coated on the surface of the electrode, “ΔV” represents the voltage window (volts), and “s” represents the scan rate (mV s−1).47
Trasatti et al. employed a formula to examine the EDLC and pseudocapacitance (PC) characteristic value.48,49 The capacitive and faradaic effect of the GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) nano self-assembly is shown in Fig. 7. The percentage of capacitance contribution was estimated using the following equations: CEDLC% = (CEDLC/CT) × 100% (or) CO = (CO/CT) × 100%(2) CPC% = (CPC/CT) × 100% (or) Ci = (Ci/CT) × 100%(3)

The GCD investigations of the formulated electrodes were performed at potentials ranging from 0–0.5 V and current densities ranging from 1–5 A g−1. The GCD curve of (a) Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, (b) GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, and (c) their comparative specific capacitance graph, as well as (d) Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, (e) GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and (f) their specific capacitance comparison, are depicted in Fig. 8. This GCD shows a reversible charge/discharge pattern, contributing to high coulombic efficiency across the prepared electrodes. Here, the charge/discharge time steadily decreased with the increase in current density. Additionally, at increased scan rates and current densities, OH− ion diffusion was minimal, and the electrolyte did not have sufficient time to permeate the entire electrode surface. When the scan rate and current density are increased, the time is minimal for the ions to diffuse over the material. However, when scan rates are slow and current densities are low, there will be sufficient time for the ions to move across the entire surface of the active material. There was higher specific capacitance at low current densities for the prepared electrodes, which is inconsistent with the ion exchange mechanism.50–53 From the GCD graph, the specific capacitance can be evaluated by using the following equation: (4)where the current density (A) is given by “I”, “Δt” represents the discharge time, “m” denotes the mass of the material (g) on the working electrode, and “ΔV” is the applied voltage window (volts).54

These GCD measurements reveal that the nano self-assembly electrode of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 has a greater specific capacitance of 898 F g−1 than the nano self-assembly GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 with 868 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. From these specific capacitance values, the areal capacitance of each electrode material was computed and found to be 2.136 F cm−2, 2.694 F cm−2, 2.1 F cm−2, and 2.604 F cm−2 for Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, respectively. The areal capacitance was calculated based on previous reports of practical applications.4,55–57 Furthermore, the potential drop of the electrodes was measured. The potential drop in the GCD is composed of two components: I and R. The EIS in this investigation showed that this electrode has a low charge transfer resistance as well as a solution resistance. As a result, R is low among the components I and R. Also, cyclic voltammetry confirmed that current I is the greater quantity in our circuit. As a result, the current flowing through the circuit is what is primarily responsible for the decrease in IR, and the calculated values for the circuits appear in Table 1.

EIS was used to investigate the interfacial behaviour and kinetic response between the electrolyte and the electrode. EIS analyzed the conductivity over a frequency range of 0.01–100 KHz. The EIS graph was constructed to interpret the interphase resistance between the active electrode and the electrolyte in terms of real versus imaginary components of the impedance. The Nyquist plot of this active electrode and the resulting equal circuit model is shown in Fig. 9. To determine the physical changes involved in the material, equivalent circuit parameters were used to simplify the overall impedance contribution and create an EIS spectrum. Using the equivalent circuit C1/(R1 + C2/R2 + M3), the constant phase components of the cell resistance were determined. This equivalent circuit assisted in determining that solution resistance (Rs) Rs = 0.6254, 0.5405 Ω, and charge transfer resistance (Rct) Rct = 0.4854 and 0.4278 Ω for Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9, respectively. There were diminished ionic Rs and Rct values at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 sample. This showed that this nano self-assembly in the KOH electrolyte was characterized by enhanced electrical conductivity and rapid electron transport kinetics.

Excellent morphology may be responsible for the enhanced charge transfer.58–60 EIS analysis revealed great electrical contact with low ionic resistance, indicating that the nano self-assembly may be highly appropriate for supercapacitor applications.61,62 The GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembly exhibited a higher capacitive retention of approximately 92.85% at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 9(c), when compared with GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 in Fig. 9(d).

3.6 Electrochemical performance of the fabricated device
The electrochemical behaviour of the nano self-assembly GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9//AC two-electrode assembly was investigated at scan rates from 0 to 1.5 V. This two-electrode assembly used activated carbon as the negative electrode and GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 as the positive electrode, with the corresponding potentials set at −1 to 0 V and 0 to 0.5 V. A sheet of Whatman filter paper separated the anode and cathode. This fabricated device used activated carbon as the negative electrode material due to its greater conductivity and outstanding electrochemical reversibility. The equation was used to calculate the balancing of mass between the electrodes in an asymmetric two-electrode system.63 At first, the specific capacitances of the material under investigation (GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd)) and the activated carbon in the three-electrode set-up were calculated separately. The capacitance and mass values at both electrodes were compared to determine the optimal mass weighted at the cathode in the two-electrode configuration. Only 2 mg of active mass was used on the positive electrodes, and 5 mg was used on the negative electrodes coated on nickel foam to obtain an accurate result for the device's performance. After that, a few drops of KOH electrolyte were placed on both coated Ni-foam electrodes. The KOH electrolyte-drenched Whatman paper was then employed as a separator. m−/m+ = (C+ × V+)/(C− × V−)(5)
We used a Swagelok test cell to construct the asymmetrical configuration of the cathode, anode, and the separator. The electrochemical performance of the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device in 3 M KOH electrolyte was enhanced. Fig. 10(a) depicts CV measurements at 5–100 mV s−1 using a two-electrode setup. Eqn (6) and (7) were64 used to determine the energy and power density from the GCD curve (Fig. 10(b)). A comparison of the asymmetric devices in this study with those from previous reports is shown in Table 3. (6) (7)

The highest energy density (58.96 W h kg−1) and power density (750 W kg−1) were achieved at a scan rate of 1 A g−1. The calculated energy and power density of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 from GCD curves for varying current densities are represented in Table 4. The capacitive retention and coulombic efficiency of a GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 electrode are shown in Fig. 10(c). Capacitive retention remained at 84.13% at 5 A g−1 at the end of 10000 cycles. For the corresponding GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembly, it was estimated that the coulombic efficiency was 98.79%.

Our results showed that GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 is the most optimal electrode material for supercapacitors because of its high power and effective energy density. Fig. 10(d–f) exhibits the electrochemical performance of a fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device using the GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assembly. Compared to GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9, the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 self-assembly showcases outstanding supercapacitive behaviour. The Ragone plot of energy density vs. power density depicted in Fig. 11 compares the power performance of the current work with those of previous reports for fabricated asymmetric devices. Our fabricated device sustained a high energy density over a wide range of power densities.
 Fig. 11  Ragone plot compared with previous reports of fabricated ASC devices. 
The superior electrochemical behaviour of the GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 fabricated asymmetric device might arise from the effect of surface area. To examine the surface area and pore size of the prepared particles, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was carried out. Fig. 12 shows the nitrogen adsorption and desorption graph of synthesized (a) Bi2Mo2O9 and (b) GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9. The surface area and pore size of the samples are shown in Table S3.† GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 exhibits a higher surface area in comparison with Bi2Mo2O9, which aids in the enhancement of the electrochemical behaviour. Thus, the observation confirms that GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 is suitable for utilization in the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitor devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the sol–gel combustion technique was used to successfully synthesize Bi2Mo2O9, Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9, and GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd). Reduced graphene oxide was incorporated into rare earth-doped bismuth molybdate to enhance and examine its supercapacitive behavior. The monoclinic structure and the phase formation of Bi2Mo2O9 without any impurities were affirmed by XRD. The optical nature of the developed nano self-assemblies was examined using Raman spectroscopy. The surface morphology and the existence of elements of prepared materials were explored using SEM and XPS analysis.
The electrochemical performance of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 nano self-assemblies was scrutinized with CV, EIS, and GCD analysis. In a three-electrode configuration, GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 exhibited remarkable specific capacitances of 898 F g−1 and 868 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. After 5000 cycles, GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 displayed an admirable capacitive retention rate of approximately 92.85% and 91.29% @ 5 A g−1, respectively. The two-electrode fabricated asymmetric device of GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 and GM-Bi1.9Gd0.1Mo2O9 exhibited a similar power density of 750 W kg−1 in accordance with an exceptional energy density of 58.96 W h kg−1 and 56.67 W h kg−1, respectively. GM-Bi1.9Ce0.1Mo2O9 exhibited an outstanding supercapacitive performance with a capacitive retention of 84.13% after 10000 charge–discharge cycles. The exceptional electrochemical behavior of GM-Bi1.9RE0.1Mo2O9 (RE = Ce and Gd) implies that rare earth doping and rGO modification enhanced their supercapacitive behavior as expected and suggests that they may be reliable electrode materials for energy storage systems.
