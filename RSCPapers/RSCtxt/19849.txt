    , Accepted 8th February 2013First published on 11th February 2013AbstractHigh quality MWCNT material based counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated using a novel route and their power-conversion efficiency was studied. Transition metals such as Fe, Ni, V, Mn, Cr, Mo, Ru and Pd loaded on Co-SBA-15 molecular sieves were synthesized and tested for the formation of MWCNTs at different temperatures (700–1000 °C) using a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. This result showed that Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 systems are highly suitable sources as catalysts for the growth of MWCNTs compared to other bimetallic systems. TEM and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the synthesized MWCNTs were of high quality and well-graphitized. The MWCNTs were applied to the counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Cyclic voltammetry measurements proved that the catalytic activity of the MWCNT coated electrode towards I3− reduction was significantly higher than that of the Pt coated electrode. Electrochemical impedance measurement of the symmetric cell revealed that the charge transfer resistance of the MWCNT coated electrode was less than that of the Pt coated electrode. Due to the low charge transfer resistance of the synthesized MWCNTs, the DSSCs with MWCNTs as counter electrode gave better photoelectric performance compared to DSSCs equipped with a conventional Pt counter electrode.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted huge interest from researchers all over the globe because of their simplicity of fabrication and cost-effectiveness compared with silicon based photovoltaic devices.1–5 In general, a DSSC comprises a dye sensitized TiO2 nanocrystalline film as a working electrode, an electrolyte containing iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple and a platinum (Pt) film coated conductive glass as a counter electrode (CE). A key requirement for a high performance DSSC is that the counter electrode needs to possess high catalytic activity towards triiodide reduction and conductivity. Platinum is an efficient catalyst for triiodide reduction and a power conversion efficiency of more than 11% has been achieved when it was used as a counter electrode.6,7 However, the expenses involved in acquiring this rare noble metal limit the practical applications of this technology on large scale. Therefore, extensive research has been devoted to develop alternative functional materials to replace Pt as the counter electrode, in order to reduce the overall cost and simultaneously retain the performance of DSSCs.8,9 A variety of low-cost counter electrode materials such as conducting polymers,10–17 carbonaceous materials18–29 and inorganic compounds4,8,30–32 have been proposed to replace Pt in DSSCs. Among the Pt-free counter electrode materials, multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are potential candidates because of their high specific surface area, superior electronic conductivity and excellent mechanical strength.33 Recently, MWCNTs have been employed as a counter electrode in DSSCs with improved performance of DSSCs.21,22,34
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be synthesized using various methods, including laser-ablation, arc-discharge and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).35–37 Among these methods, CVD is moderately simple, economical and easy to scale up the production level when compared to laser-ablation and arc-discharge. In addition, CVD is the most economic way to obtain high purity CNTs with predictable properties, uniform diameter and good yield for their application purposes. Synthesis of CNTs is essentially a two-step process consisting of an initial catalyst preparation step followed by the real reaction for which the presence of catalysts is vital. It is worth reiterating that careful selection of the catalyst and the catalytic support improves the process yield significantly. Interactions, either chemical or physical, between the catalytic support and metal nanoparticles have a tremendous influence on the catalytic properties of the nanoparticles. As stated by a rule of thumb, weak interactions lead to tip-growth mode whereas strong interactions lead to base-growth.38 Investigations by many researchers have revealed that bimetallic catalysts are much more effective in facilitating the growth of CNTs by CVD than monometallic catalysts.39,40 Different researchers have tried various mixtures of transition metals (Fe–Co, Co–Ni, Fe–Ni) on various porous supports such as MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaCO3etc. and evaluated their catalytic activities.40–43 It was reported that the yield and diameter of synthesized CNTs varied according to the size of transition metal particles on the surface of the support. Bimetallic catalysts like Co–Mo and Fe–Co have also been effectively utilized for growing CNTs.44,45 The use of transition metal catalysts over a suitable support is the favoured method for producing large amounts of carbon material at moderate temperatures.46
Noble metals have been previously investigated as promoters for cobalt based catalysts. Kogelbauer et al. studied the effect of Ru on Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by different methods and found that Ru increased the reducibility and the dispersion of cobalt.47 The results of CNT growth with the same catalyst but on different types of support suggest that substrates with larger surface areas, such as alumina and silica, will promote the nucleation and growth of CNTs.48,49 High surface area allows the carbon source atoms to diffuse readily on the surface of the metal catalysts. If an active catalyst metal species is present within a fine pore, it will quickly form enough carbon to fill up the pore and block the entrance of additional reactant hydrocarbons.
The discovery of silica based and metal substituted mesoporous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48, Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15), etc., found potential applications in the field of catalysis, separation, adsorption and CNT synthesis.50,51 Among the catalytic supports, SBA-15 is a silica-based mesoporous material with ordered uniform hexagonal channels ranging from 3 to 30 nm with narrow pore size distribution.51 It is one of the most attractive catalyst supports with high thermal and hydrothermal stability and a large surface area of 600–1000 m2 g−1, allowing for the dispersion of a large number of catalytically active species. Besides that, reducibility is favoured for the SiO2 supported Co catalyst because the strength of the interaction between the cobalt and the support is lower than other commonly used supports.52 In comparison to other Co supported catalytic systems such as MCM-41, Co incorporated in SBA-15 offers additional advantages such as high surface area, uniform porosity, and higher thermal and hydrothermal stability. The present report elucidates the superior activity and stability of cobalt incorporated SBA-15 catalysts in the selective synthesis of SWCNTs and MWCNTs. In addition, the second metal introduced into the Co-SBA-15 increases the yield of CNTs significantly by promoting the uniform dispersion of cobalt nanoparticles.
In the present investigation, the different transition metals such as Fe, Ni, V, Mn, Cr, Mo, Ru and Pd loaded on Co-SBA-15 ordered mesoporous molecular sieves were synthesized. These catalysts were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for the growth of CNTs. Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 are highly suitable sources as catalysts for the growth of MWCNTs compared to other bimetallic systems. The purified CNTs were physico-chemically characterized by TEM, Raman spectra and TGA. In addition, it was demonstrated that the MWCNTs grown over Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 can be used as a counter electrode for DSSCs with improved photoelectric performance compared to conventional Pt counter electrode.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cobalt(II) acetylacetonate and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) were purchased from Aldrich and used as the source for cobalt and silicon, respectively. Ferric nitrate, nickel nitrate, chromium nitrate, manganese acetate, vanadyl sulfate, ammonium molybdate, ruthenium chloride and palladium chloride were purchased from Merck and used as a source of Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, Mo, Ru and Pd, respectively. Triblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (EO20PO70EO20, Pluronic P123; Mav = 5800, Aldrich) was used as a structure-directing agent. Anhydrous toluene, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, acetonitrile and acetic acid were purchased from Merck. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), iodine, lithium iodide, 4-tert-butyl-pyridine, ethyl cellulose, terpineol and N719 dye [cis-di (thiocyanato)-N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II)] were purchased from Aldrich. All the reagents were used without further purification. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass plates (sheet resistance 15 Ohm sq−1) were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd, HK. The FTO conducting glass plates were ultrasonicated thoroughly in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 15 min in each step to remove organic pollutants and other contamination.
2.2 Synthesis of the catalysts
The Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%) was synthesized following a two-step method. Initially, mesoporous siliceous SBA-15 was synthesized according to the procedure from literature.51,53 4 g of Pluronic P123 was dissolved in 30 g of distilled water and 120 g of 2 M HCl. The mixture was continuously stirred until the copolymer was completely dissolved. Then, 8.5 g of TEOS was slowly added in drops. The mixture was then stirred for an additional 10 min and transferred to polypropylene bottles. The bottles were maintained at room temperature for 20 h. Subsequently, the samples were aged at 100 °C in an autoclave for 48 h. After cooling, the solids were washed and filtered with deionized water. The as-synthesized samples were heated under nitrogen atmosphere from room temperature to 540 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and then stabilized under nitrogen for another hour following which the carrier gas was switched from nitrogen to air for 5 h to remove the template at 540 °C. The mass ratio of each component during synthesis was 2:4.38:4.25:70.62 (P123:HCl:TEOS:H2O).
The Co-SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized following a controlled grafting process through atomic layer deposition (ALD) using cobalt(II) acetylacetonate precursor. Wang et al. had earlier reported that only the samples grafted using cobalt(II) acetylacetonate showed high dispersion and high reduction stability.54 The cobalt precursor solution was prepared by dissolving cobalt(II) acetylacetonate in 150 mL of anhydrous toluene for 3 h. The solution was refluxed at 110 °C for 3 h with N2 flowing through the apparatus to completely dissolve the appropriate amount of cobalt precursors (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%). The calcined SBA-15 was simultaneously suspended in 80 mL of anhydrous toluene and refluxed in N2 atmosphere to remove any adsorbed water. The cobalt precursor solution was then added to the SBA-15 toluene suspension, and the mixture was refluxed for another 3 h. N2 gas was purged to remove any physisorbed water and to prevent the contact of samples with moisture in air. Thus, the N2 gas was continuously purged throughout the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled, filtered and washed with toluene to ensure that there was no unreacted cobalt precursor left on the SBA-15. The solids were then dried overnight at ambient temperature. The calcination procedure for the as-synthesized Co-SBA-15 was the same as for the siliceous SBA-15.
Thus, the prepared catalysts when evaluated gravimetrically for yield percentage of MWCNTs revealed that 5 wt% of Co-SBA-15 showed optimum yield and hence, it was further used for the preparation of bimetallic catalysts which were subjected to different studies. Fe/Co-SBA-15 catalysts with different Fe contents (0.1–0.4 wt%) were prepared by wet-impregnation of 5 wt% Co-SBA-15 using an aqueous solution containing the desired amount of ruthenium chloride. The catalysts were dried overnight in an oven at 120 °C followed by calcination at 400 °C for 5 h. In this study, the Fe-loaded samples were labeled as x% Fe/Co-SBA-15 with x standing for the iron weight percent in the Co-SBA-15, where wt% represents the final Fe/Co content in the sample tested by ICP-AES analysis. Bimetallic Ni/Co-SBA-15, Cr/Co-SBA-15, Mn/Co-SBA-15, V/Co-SBA-15, Mo/Co-SBA-15, Ru/Co-SBA-15 and Pd/Co-SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized following similar procedure as discussed above.
2.3 Catalytic performance
The growth process of CNTs was carried out in a simple CVD reaction assembly, consisting of a horizontal tubular furnace and a quartz tube as reported previously.55 The catalytic activities of Fe/Co-SBA-15, Ni/Co-SBA-15, Cr/Co-SBA-15, Mn/Co-SBA-15, V/Co-SBA-15, Mo/Co-SBA-15, Ru/Co-SBA-15 and Pd/Co-SBA-15 were measured by estimating the carbon deposit yield. The catalyst was first prereduced at high temperature (700 °C) under pure hydrogen for 30 min and then purged with argon for another 30 min to remove any hydrogen that may have been adsorbed on the samples. Typically, 100 mg of pre-reduced catalyst was placed uniformly on a quartz boat located at the middle of the reactor. The furnace was heated from room temperature to reaction temperature under argon flow (110 mL min−1), and then the feed was switched to equal volumetric ratio of nitrogen and acetylene gas mixture when the desired reaction temperature was reached. The CVD reaction was carried out for 30 min, and then the furnace was cooled down to ambient temperature under argon atmosphere.
2.4 Fabrication of counter electrode
The MWCNTs were mixed with a 5 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose (EC) in terpineol by ultrasonication. The mixture was fabricated on the transparent conduction oxide (FTO) glass substrate by a spin-coating method and dried at 300 °C for 30 min to obtain the MWCNT counter electrodes. For comparison, a Pt electrode was prepared by a similar method.
2.5 Fabrication of the TiO2 photoanode
The TiO2 thin-film photoanode was fabricated by a spin-coating technique. The detailed procedure is as follows: 0.5 mL of acetic acid and 3 g TiO2 (P25, Degussa) powder were mixed in an agate mortar. Then, 2.5 mL distilled water and 15 mL ethanol were introduced dropwise into the agate mortar. The mixture was transferred to a beaker using 25 mL of ethanol and stirred for 1 h followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Terpineol and ethyl cellulose in ethanol was added to it. Subsequently, the above mixture was kept for 24 h in an ultrasonic water bath at 28 °C to obtain a well-dispersed TiO2 paste. This paste was spin coated on a cleaned FTO conducting substrate and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 thin-film is immersed in 50 mL of 0.5 mM ethanolic N719 dye solution for 24 h in dark at room temperature. Then the film was cleaned with ethanol and dried and used as a photoanode (working electrode) for DSSCs.
2.6 DSSCs assembly
A Surlyn thermosetting spacer was kept between photoanode and counter electrode and both of them were clamped. The active area (0.25 cm2) of the cell was filled with an electrolyte by injecting the mixture of 0.1 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) + 0.6 M MPI (1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide) in acetonitrile through the pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode. The holes were subsequently sealed with a polymer sheet.
2.7 Characterization of catalysts and MWCNTs
The amount of the metal loaded into the SBA-15 was analyzed and determined by ICP-AES (Perkin Elmer OPTIMA 3000). The sample was dissolved in a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid before the measurement. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded with a PANalyticalX'Pert diffractometer, using nickel-filtered Cooke radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) and a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium solid-state detector. The diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 0.5–10° for the catalyst and 5–80° for the CNTs. The peaks were identified with reference to the compilation of stimulated X-ray diffraction patterns. The surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution were measured by N2 adsorption at −197 °C using an ASAP-2010 porosimeter from Micromeritics Corporation. The samples were degassed at 200 °C and 1.3 × 10−3 Pa for about 8–10 h prior to the adsorption experiments. The mesopore volume was estimated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.5 by assuming that all the mesopores were filled with condensed nitrogen in the normal liquid state. Pore size distribution was estimated using the BJH algorithm (ASAP-2010) available as built-in software from Micromeritics. Thermogravimetric analysis measurements were carried out under atmospheric air using a high-resolution TA Instrument, SDT Q600. About 15 mg of the synthesized catalyst and CNTs were used for each experiment. The sample was heated in air at the rate of 20 °C min−1 in the temperature range from 35 to 1000 °C. The samples for TEM analysis were initially dispersed in ethanol or acetone by ultrasonicating for 30 min which was allowed to settle. A drop of the supernatant liquid was then transferred on to a carbon coated copper grid and mounted onto the TEM (JEOL 3010) operated at 300 kV and the micrographs recorded. Raman spectra were recorded with a Micro-Raman system RM 1000 Renishaw using a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm (Nd–YAG), 0.5 to 1 mW, with a 1 μm focus spot in order to avoid photodecomposition of the samples. In addition to ICP-AES analysis, the presence of metal nanoparticles in the SBA-15 and in the as-synthesized MWCNTs was confirmed by XPS analysis. Shimadzu ESCA 3400 with Mg Kα primary radiation (15 kV, 15 mA) was used for the XPS measurements. The XPS experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum (10−8 Torr) after cleaning the sample surface by an ion-gun etching process. The XPS data for the as-synthesized MWCNTs is discussed and that for the catalysts is given as ESI.†
2.8 Electrochemical and photovoltaic measurements
The assembly and measurements of the dye-sensitized solar cells were carried out as described below. The electrochemical experiments were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N). Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI + 1 mM I2 + 0.1 M LiClO4, using a three electrode cell with Pt or CNT coated FTO as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. For EIS measurements, a thin layer symmetric cell was fabricated by clamping two identical MWCNT or Pt coated FTO electrodes to each other with a thermosetting polymer (Surlyn, Dupont) spacer. The EIS measurements were performed under normal conditions (without exposure to a light source) over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. The electrolyte, 0.1 mM LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.5 M 4-tertiary butyl pyridine in acetonitrile was filled between the electrodes through the pre-drilled holes and sealed. The photovoltaic performance parameters of DSSCs were measured under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3 Results and discussion
The HRTEM images of calcined Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%) showed well-ordered hexagonal arrays of mesopores along with one-dimensional channels, which indicated a P6mm mesostructure, as shown in Fig. S1(a–d).† The HRTEM images of Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 with different magnifications are shown in Fig. 1a–c and d–f, respectively. The images showed the representative morphology and distribution of Co, Fe/Co and Ru/Co nanoparticles inside the pores of SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieves. From the images, it was observed that the pore structure was regular with well-ordered arrays and the metallic nanoparticles were present within the channels of SBA-15. The Co, Fe/Co and Ru/Co nanoparticles exhibited a narrow size distribution in the range of 1–3 nm. The distance between two consecutive centers of hexagonal pores was estimated to be about 12 nm while the thickness of the pore wall was around 4 nm.

The surface area, pore size and pore volume of Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%), Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 materials were determined by N2 sorption isotherm and tabulated in Table 1. From the values, it was evident that the surface area, pore diameter and pore volume decreased with an increase in the Co, Fe/Co and Ru/Co concentrations. The sorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%), Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 are depicted in Fig. 2. From the figure, it was inferred that the mesoporous structure was retained even after the loading of Fe or Ru into the Co-SBA-15. The isotherms conformed to type IV with an H1 hysteresis loop which was typical for mesoporous materials with 2D-hexagonal structure and having large pore size but narrow size distribution. The sharp steps that were found to occur at a relative partial pressure in the range of 0.6–0.8 correspond to the capillary condensation of N2 and indicate the uniformity in the pores. Moreover, the narrow pore size distribution confirmed the regularity of the pore diameter.

The XRD patterns of calcined Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%), Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 are shown in Fig. 3. It was noted that the XRD patterns of the catalysts were similar to those of pure siliceous SBA-15 materials by Zhao et al.51 Three well-resolved and two poorly resolved diffraction peaks could be observed which are indexed to the (100), (110), (200), (210) and (300) reflections, respectively of the hexagonal P6mm space group. Therefore, the above results from HRTEM, N2 physisorption and XRD characterization suggested that the method employed in this study was a suitable method for the formation of mesoporous silica catalysts with highly ordered 2D hexagonal P6mm structure.

The concentrations of metal in Co-SBA-15 (1, 3, 5 and 8 wt%), Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 catalysts, determined using ICP-AES, are given in Table 1. The data indicated that the Si/M (M = Co, Fe/Co and Ru/Co) ratio was retained in all the samples which suggested that there was no loss in the metal concentration that was added initially; in other words, leaching out of the metal particles was not observed from the mesoporous molecular sieves. This observation resulted from the interaction between M and Si–OH species leading to the formation of M–OH and as a consequence, a higher amount of M was retained within the pores of the molecular sieves. As a result, the Si/M ratios of the synthesized material were very close to that of the initial addition of the metal content.
The order of the activity of the catalysts for the synthesis of MWCNTs at 800 °C was determined gravimetrically and was as follows: 5 wt% Co-SBA-15 > 3 wt% Co-SBA-15 > 8 wt% Co-SBA-15 > 1 wt% Co-SBA-15. The highest carbon deposition was achieved in 5 wt% Co-SBA-15 compared to the other monometallic SBA-15 catalysts. The efficiency of the optimized 5 wt% Co-SBA-15 in the synthesis of MWCNTs at different temperatures (700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C) was studied. The maximum yield was observed at 800 °C followed by 900 °C, 1000 °C and 700 °C (Table S1†). The explanation for the observation of lower activity at higher loading of Co is as follows. Higher levels of loading are associated with irregular dispersion and result in the formation of bulk and clustered metal particles. This decreases the number of active sites and surface area thereby affecting the growth of CNTs. The influence of temperature on the growth of MWCNTs was also evaluated and it was shown that the amount of carbon deposited increased when the temperature was raised from 700 °C to 800 °C, but a further increase in temperature was associated with a decrease in the carbon deposit yield. The decrease in carbon deposit yield observed at higher temperatures was due to the formation of carbonaceous impurities. The enhancement in the growth of MWCNTs on 5 wt% Co-SBA-15 with the use of a second metal (Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, Mo, Ru and Pd) with 0.2 wt% loading was observed at different temperatures (800–1000 °C) (0.2 wt% of metal loading was chosen as it displayed the best properties when compared with other wt ratios). Fig. 4 shows the effect of the reaction temperature on the carbon deposit yield over Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, Mo, Ru and Pd loaded Co-SBA-15 catalysts for 20 min. The carbon deposit yield was found to follow the order: Ru/Co-SBA-15 > Fe/Co-SBA-15 > Ni/Co-SBA-15 > V/Co-SBA-15 > Pd/Co-SBA-15 > Mo/Co-SBA-15 > Cr/Co-SBA-15 > Mn/Co-SBA-15 at the same reaction temperature of 800 °C. When compared with the other metal loaded catalysts, Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 showed the best and comparable MWCNT growth at 800 °C (Table S1†). This observation of excellent performance by the Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 could be attributed to the even dispersion of the metal particles over the support and the existence of a higher number of active sites. This suggests that the Fe or Ru addition gave rise to increased metal dispersion. Li et al. reported that the increased metal dispersion observed in their study was possibly due to the effect of Ru on the nucleation of cobalt clusters.56 In addition, Fe or Ru metal particles have the potential to stimulate the growth of MWCNTs when present along with cobalt. From the above discussion, it is evident that the presence of small amounts of Fe or Ru enhances the growth of MWCNTs significantly on the Co-SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieves.
 Fig. 4  Effect of reaction temperature on the carbon deposited yield over transition metals loaded on Co-SBA-15 catalyst (catalyst: 100 mg, acetylene: 40 mL min−1, argon: 110 mL min−1, hydrogen: 110 mL min−1 and reaction time: 20 min). 
The morphology of the MWCNTs grown on Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 was characterized using TEM and is shown in Fig. 5. It was observed that highly dense rope-like carbon nanostructures grew from the surface of the catalyst supports while a closer look with higher magnification showed that they possessed a hollow core. From the TEM images corresponding to Fe/Co-SBA-15 catalysts (Fig. 5a–c), the MWCNTs were observed to possess a more uniform diameter than those grown over Ru/Co-SBA-15 (Fig. 5d–f). To further validate the observations as regards the diameter distributions, more than 200 MWCNTs per sample were selected and their outer diameters were measured from the TEM images. It was found that both the catalysts were not only associated with the highest yield but with comparable morphologies. These results show that both Fe and Ru affect the diameter distribution of the produced CNTs. In addition, it was also noted that the 0.2 wt% loading of Fe and Ru facilitated the growth of MWCNTs with the smallest diameter and having the most narrow diameter distribution.

In general, Raman spectra are characterized by three main signals: G band, D band and radial breathing mode (RBM). The G band appears at around 1200–1400 cm−1 and was ascribed to tangential modes of a graphene sheet. The D band at around 1400–1600 cm−1 was related to the defects in a graphene sheet and the presence of amorphous carbon. The RBM peaks originate in CNTs with small diameters of less than 3 nm, and their position was strongly dependent on the nanotube diameter. Raman spectra of CNTs grown over Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 system at the optimized reaction condition (temperature = 800 °C; flow rate of acetylene = 40 mL min−1 and time = 20 min) are shown in Fig. 6. The Raman spectroscopic measurements for MWCNTs grown over Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 catalysts (designated as MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2, respectively and the same will be followed throughout the text) were conducted at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. It can be seen that the spectra of MWCNTs displayed two common peaks at 1330 cm−1/1326 cm−1 (MWCNTs-1/MWCNTs-2) and 1581 cm−1/1580 cm−1 (MWCNTs-1/MWCNTs-2), which are associated with disordered carbonaceous products (D-band) and tangential graphitized products (G-band) and are characteristic peaks for MWCNTs.57,58 The peak intensities of the G-band and D-band are denoted as IG and ID, respectively. It is to be noted that the IG > ID values for the MWCNTs-1 were similar to that of MWCNTs-2.

Fig. 7a–d show the main photoemission signals of iron, cobalt, carbon and oxygen of as-grown MWCNTs on Fe/Co-SBA-15 bimetallic catalyst. The two distinct core level signals were observed at 710.43 and 723.73 eV in Fig. 7a, corresponding to Fe (2p3/2) and Fe (2p1/2), respectively. The doublet feature of the Fe (2p) spectrum is due to spin orbit coupling resulting in 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe. The observed binding energy (710.43 eV) for Fe (2p3/2) is relatively higher than that of bulk iron (707 eV).59 The same shift was observed for Fe (2p1/2) as well. Similarly, a doublet peak was observed at 779.45 and 794.89 eV for Co (2p3/2) and Co (2p1/2), respectively (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the peaks were slightly shifted towards higher binding energy when compared to the pure metallic state of Co. These changes in the binding energies of Fe and Co in SBA-15 are mainly attributed to the formation of Fe–Co alloy in association with the small size of the metal nanoparticles, which also causes a slight shift in the binding energies.59Fig. 7c and d show the core level signals of carbon of CNTs and oxygen of SBA-15. The XPS signal at 530.6 eV represents the unbound state of oxygen at the surface and the shouldering at about 532 eV represents the oxygen bonded with Si in the SBA-15 matrix.

The XPS spectra for the MWCNTs grown over Ru/Co-SBA-15 are shows in Fig. 8a–d. A strong and symmetric peak at 284.5 eV was observed as shown in Fig. 8a which represents the Ru 3d5/2 and the peak is slightly shifted towards higher binding energy when compared to bulk Ru (280 eV).60 Moreover, the Co (2p3/2) and Co (2p1/2) were observed at 780.7 and 794.9 eV and these binding energies are also relatively higher than that of pure bulk Co. As discussed in the previous case, the shifts in the binding energies of Ru and Co are the indication of Ru–Co alloy formation in the SBA-15 matrix. Fig. 8c and d show the XPS signals of carbon of CNTs and oxygen of SBA-15. In this case, the XPS signal at 531.9 eV is dominant which represents the oxygen bonded with Si in the SBA-15 matrix and the weak shouldering at lower energy side (530 eV) represents the unbound state of oxygen at the surface. In addition, the XPS spectra for the Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 catalysts were shown in Fig. S2a–d and S3a–d.† The similar characteristics of bimetallic catalysts were observed with clear binding energy variations. As a consequence, the presence of metallic nanoparticles within the channels of SBA-15 was confirmed by the XPS analysis.

The thermogravimetric analyses of MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 are shown in Fig. S4.† It was observed that both the samples displayed similar weight loss characteristics. The initial weight loss (in trace amounts) observed between the temperature 40 and 100 °C was due to desorption of physically adsorbed moisture on the MWCNTs. The steep fall in weight observed in the decomposition temperature range between 550 and 650 °C was attributed to the oxidation of the MWCNTs. It was noted that there was no weight loss below the temperature of 550 °C which proves the absence of carbonaceous impurities like amorphous carbon and microcrystalline carbon, since the combustion of amorphous carbon usually occurs below 400 °C. Additionally, since no weight loss was observed beyond 650 °C, it was confirmed that the synthesized MWCNTs were of high purity without any metallic particles. Furthermore, the MWCNTs have high thermal stability due to the presence of numerous well-graphitized walls.
The X-ray diffraction patterns of MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 are shown in Fig. S5.† They showed that the intensity of the graphitic peak (002) strong and prominent, while the interlayer spacing of the MWCNTs was closer to the interlayer spacing of ideal graphite crystals (0.3354 nm). The spectra displayed a strong peak at 2θ = 25.53°/25.73° (MWCNTs-1/MWCNTs-2) and a weak peak at 2θ = 44. 17°/44.21° (MWCNTs-1/MWCNTs-2) and were respectively assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of graphite.
CV measurements were carried out to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrodes for the reduction of I3−. The oxidation and reduction peaks of I−/I3− for the Pt, MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 counter electrodes were almost identical (Fig. S6†), while the cathode peak potentials of MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 were found to be more positive than that of the Pt counter electrode. In addition, the cathodic current densities of the MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 were significantly higher than that of Pt, demonstrating a much faster I−/I3− reaction rate. The superior electrochemical activities of the synthesized MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 were probably due to their higher active surface areas.
Cyclic voltammetry of the I−/I3− system on the MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 with different scan rates was also studied (Fig. S7†). The cathodic and anodic peak current densities were found to gradually shift to the negative and positive directions respectively with increasing scan rates. Also, the excellent linear relationship between the square root of the scan rate and peak current density can be observed. This indicates the diffusion limitation of the redox reaction on MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 with no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox couple and either MWCNTs-1 or MWCNTs-2.
Most importantly, the DSSCs with the MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 electrodes show good stability. This stability was confirmed by the stability of the current–voltage curves over time for the I−/I3− redox system with the MWCNTs working electrode and Pt counter electrode (Fig. S8†). No detachment of the MWCNTs films from the FTO glass was observed after the 200th cycle. It was observed that both the counter electrodes exhibited a stable cathodic peak current density as inferred from their CV. This indicated that the fabricated MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 film not only possessed excellent electrochemical stability, but also were attached firmly onto the FTO substrate.
The value of charge transfer resistance (Rct), which was determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), plays a significant role in the performance of the DSSCs. The Rct values of Pt, MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 are given in Table 2. Nyquist plots of MWCNTs-1, MWCNTs-2 and Pt counter electrodes in a thin-layer symmetric cell configuration are shown in Fig. 9. The half value of the real component of impedance of an electrode at a high-frequency side semicircle is considered as its Rct.61 When the impedance data were fitted with the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 9), Rct of MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 counter electrodes were found to be 2.68 Ω cm2 and 2.76 Ω cm2, respectively. Under similar conditions, the Pt counter electrode showed a higher value of 3.57 Ω cm2. The derivation of such high electrocatalytic property in MWCNTs electrodes is still a subject of interest. Only a few reports have emphasized that a large surface area enhances the electron transfer kinetics of the counter electrodes.62

 Fig. 9  Impedance spectra of symmetric cells fabricated using MWCNTs-1, MWCNTs-2 and Pt coated FTO plates. 
The measured photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on three counter electrodes (MWCNTs-1, MWCNTs-2 and Pt) are summarized in Table 2. It was determined that the optimum annealing temperature for the binding of MWCNTs over FTO was 300 °C (results not discussed here). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) performance of the three DSSCs in the different levels of simulated solar illumination is shown in Fig. 10a and b. Under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, air mass 1.5 G), the J–V curves of all three DSSCs were compared. The overall conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 counter electrodes showed 9.38% and 9.26%, respectively, which was relatively improved when compared to the efficiency (9.17%) of the DSSC prepared with platinum counter electrode (Table 2). It is well known that the heterogeneous rate constant (k0) of Pt electrode for the I−/I3− redox reaction is one order higher when compared to conducting polymers/carbonaceous materials.63 Therefore, the observed nominal enhanced efficiencies of DSSCs fabricated using MWCNT-1 and MWCNT-2 based counter electrodes can be understood from their lower Rct values. Besides lower Rct, the large surface area of MWCNT-1 and MWCNT-2 can also contribute to the efficiency enhancement.

4 Conclusions
High quality MWCNT counter electrodes were successfully fabricated for the photovoltaic application of dye-sensitized solar cells. MWCNTs were grown outside the mesopores of Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 molecular sieves with straight and uniform diameter along with a high degree of graphitization. It was shown that Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 molecular sieves were good carriers for the preparation of MWCNTs. From the above observations, it is noteworthy that a small amount of added Fe or Ru plays a significant role in enhancing the growth of MWCNTs. The XPS measurements show that carbon nanotube formation occurred over the bimetallic Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 catalysts. The excellent growth of MWCNTs over Fe/Co-SBA-15 and Ru/Co-SBA-15 was proved by the TGA, TEM and Raman studies. These catalysts were suitable to produce the MWCNTs with 10–15 nm diameter and high density. The Fe or Ru metals were dispersed in the catalysts mostly through the formation processes of solid solution with Co-SBA-15 and intermetallic species. The optimized reaction conditions for the formation of high quality MWCNTs with high yield were 40 mL min−1 of acetylene at a temperature of 800 °C for 20 min of reaction time. All the results suggested that mesoporous molecular sieves with Fe or Ru loaded on the Co-SBA-15 exhibited a good structural stability and are promising catalysts for the growth of MWCNTs in large scale.
Their uniform controlled diameter, high density, high purity and good graphitization was found to be superior to the commercial MWCNTs. The synthesized MWCNTs were used as counter electrode material for DSSCs. The electrocatalytic ability of the synthesized MWCNT based counter electrode was found to be higher than that of the Pt based counter electrode. The long-term stability of the fabricated MWCNT electrocatalyst for I3− reduction was clearly improved by the chemical binding between FTO and MWCNTs. Electrochemical impedance measurements of the DSSCs exposed that the Rct of MWCNT fabricated electrode was very small. The DSSCs with MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 delivered a higher conversion efficiency (η) of 9.38 and 9.26%, respectively. The conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs employing the MWCNTs-1 and MWCNTs-2 counter electrodes are slightly higher than that of the cell with the Pt counter electrode (η = 9.17%). Thus, the high crystalline MWCNTs can serve as a potential candidate to replace the expensive Pt for the counter electrode of DSSCs.
