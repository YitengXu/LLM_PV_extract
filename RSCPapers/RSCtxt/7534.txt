    , Accepted 28th April 2021First published on 28th April 2021AbstractAn organic small molecule composed of a tetra-indole core was designed and introduced as a hole selective layer for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). 5,10,15,20-Tetrahydrotriindole[2′,3′:4:2′,3′:5,6:2′,3′:7,8]cycloocta[1,2-b]indole (TTI) when integrated in PSCs, also passivated the defects in perovskite by suppressing the non-radiative recombination as noted from photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements and gave improved photovoltaic performances. The device showed a power conversion efficiency of 15.83% when employed as an hole selective layer, however on passivating the interface of perovskite/hole selective layer, the PCE improved significantly to 19.23%. Additionally, the TTI treated device showed improved charge transfer behaviour and long-term stability when stored in the dark under an ambient atmosphere.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a surge of attention due to their outstanding performances in the thin film photovoltaic (PV) family. Their merits of solution processability, intriguing photophysical properties, long carrier diffusion length, and small exciton binding energy led to rapid advances in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) through device engineering.1–5 The certified PCE in excess of 25.5% has put PSCs on par with well-established PV technologies, and made them a viable alternative to silicon-based PV technology.6 The notable advancement in PV performances stems from device architecture, modulating the perovskite composition, growth of high quality perovskites and choice of charge extraction materials.7 To further boost the performances and reliability in PSCs, not only the development of the active layer is required but also the development of rational interfacial layers such as the hole transport layers and the electron transport layers is an essential research.8,9
The device architecture of PSCs is divided mainly into three classes: mesoporous, planar (n-i-p) and inverted planar (p-i-n) structures.10,11 Currently, the most efficient PSCs are mainly based on the n-i-p architecture, where the n-type layer of TiO2/SnO2 and the p-type layer of Spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA are used, together with mixed halide perovskites as light absorbers.12,13 The hole transport material (HTM) plays a critical role in PSCs not only to enhance the PCE but it also controls the stability of the PSCs by preventing moisture permeability into the perovskite layer. HTMs should possesses higher hole conductivity and electron blocking properties.14,15 Numerous HTMs have been developed for PSC applications based on small molecules, polymers and inorganic materials.16 Inorganic HTMs are promising candidates due to their high stability, however the PCE performance is limited by their surface defects, low intrinsic conductivity, poor solubility in common organic solvents and particle size reproducibility.17 Besides, the polymer based HTMs display decent morphological properties but low stability and reproducibility, especially when the dopants are used.18 Compared to the inorganic and polymeric counterparts, small molecules as HTMs are viable alternatives owing to high purity and solubility, defined molecular structure and good reproducibility. In addition, the interface properties between the perovskite and HTM play a trivial role in achieving high reliability in PSCs.19–22 The interfacial property is dependent on the HTM layer, mainly due to their appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for band alignment.23 Spiro-OMeTAD is being considered a standard and is a widely used HTM in PSCs. Spiro-OMeTAD induces instability in the PSCs on addition of the hygroscopic dopants, which is a prerequisite, as pristine Spiro-OMeTAD does not possess the intrinsic charge carrier mobility and the post-oxidation of the HTM has an adverse effect on the perovskite layer.24 Besides, the high material cost, stemmed from the multi-step synthesis process escalates the cost of PSCs.25
Aromatic hydrocarbons are an extensively studied class of materials owing to their unique electro-optical behaviour.26–28 Such molecules find applications in organic electronics such as organic field effect transistors (OFETS), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The development of new heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with large π-extended systems as functional materials in organic electronics is being studied. Among the heterocycles, the indole based motifs are key heteroatomic molecules29–31 as HTMs, light harvesters or emitters in the optoelectronic field, owing to their electrical and thermal merits.32,33 Among the various indole motifs, 10,15-dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c] carbazole (triindole or triazatruxene or TAT) was largely explored for PV applications. With the seminal report of triazatruxene,34 synthesized from 2-indolone,35 other TAT based derivatives were widely utilized as organic semiconductors in various optoelectronic fields. Due to the easy modification of photophysical and electrochemical properties with strong π–π stacking and charge transport ability, indole motifs have been extensively studied.36–39 Additionally, the nitrogen atoms of indole moieties provide stability against oxidative doping from the atmospheric oxygen. The triazatruxene compound, containing three indole units, fused with six membered benzene rings with an extended delocalized π-system was reported.40 It is composed of three indole rings linked to the central phenyl ring with an extended π-system. The triindole based moiety allows structural substitution and modification to tune the optoelectrical properties.41
Similarly, cyclooctatetraenes (COTs) are another class of polycyclic aromatic compounds with a nonplanar saddle-shaped geometry consisting of 8-π annulene as the structure.42,43
The advantageous property of the COT-based system includes the structural coalescing with aromatic systems such as phenyl, thiophene, furan, pyrimidine and thiazole.40 Cyclic tetramer COT fused indole motif 5,10,15,20-tetrahydrotriindole[2′,3′:4:2′,3′:5,6:2′,3′:7,8]cycloocta[1,2-b]indole (TTI) was synthesized,44,45 however remains largely unexplored.
Result and discussion
The molecular structure and synthesis route of TTI are shown in Scheme 1. Synthesis of the tetra-indole moiety was carried out in POCl3 under a dry environment in a single step. However, the reaction of 2-oxindole in POCl3 provides both tri-indole and tetra-indole as the products.40 Both the product mixtures were purified and the tetra-indole compound was characterized by NMR (1H and 13C) spectrometric analysis (Fig. S1–S2, ESI†). The 1H and 13C spectral patterns and relative integrated values are consistent with the structure of TTI. TTI was readily soluble in dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and partially in toluene. We measured the absorption of TTI in chlorobenzene, ethyl acetate and binary mixture of chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate (Fig. 1a). The absorption spectra in the different solvents show a clear π–π* transition peak at 312.8 nm. However, the absorption peak in the spectra remains unaltered, indicating no intermolecular rotation in different solvent polarities for TTI.

We measured the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile, and TT1 revealed a glass transition temperature (Tg) at 110 °C (Fig. 1b). We can expect that the tetra-indole moiety would offer a thermal and morphological stability during the PSCs fabrication and operation. No distinctive transitions for crystallization and melting behaviour during the DSC scan from the room temperature to 350 °C were noted.
We run the density functional theory (DFT) calculation to ascertain the electronic transition in TTI,40 and noted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −4.6 eV and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −1.06 eV. The saddle shaped core of the tetra-indole derivative showed a twisted molecular structure (Fig. 1c), with a non-planarity because of strong steric hindrance. The HOMO and LUMO of TTI were delocalized and loaded over the backbone of TTI (Fig. 1d and e). Overlap of the partial wave function between the two orbitals was noted, which indicates that the delocalization occurs at the tetra-indole core and this can be beneficial for the neutral exciton generation and hole transfer transitions. The energy levels suggest that TTI is suitable as an HTM for PSCs and further derivatization or doping of TTI can allow energy level tuning.
Hole mobility was measured by fabricating a hole only device with the structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. The hole mobility of TTI was measured using the space charge limit current model. By fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curve, we derived the mobility value according to the Mott-Gurney equation (Fig. S3a, ESI†). The undoped TTI showed higher mobility (4.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) than Spiro-OMeTAD (5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). While in the doped state, the mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was higher than that of TTI (1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). We measured the conductivity in a sandwich configuration (FTO/HTM/Au). The conductivity of the undoped TTI was found to be 1.21 × 10−6 S cm−1 and for the Spiro-OMeTAD, it was 0.32 × 10−6 S cm−1 (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
EPR spectroscopy experiments were designed to quantify the charge formation by doping and the mobility of the free radical cations. The EPR measurements were carried out under similar conditions with a concentration of 30 mM solutions of doped and undoped Spiro-OMeTAD and TTI (Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 2  (a) EPR spectra registered with 30 mM chlorobenzene solutions of doped Spiro-OMeTAD and TTI, and (b) influence of the modulation amplitude of the applied field on the EPR signal of doped TTI. 
The undoped Spiro-OMeTAD solution shows the characteristic weak signal due to Spiro-OMeTAD+ species generated by natural oxidation.46–48 In all the cases, the intensity of the signals increases over time under illumination (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, the intensity of the signal gradually decreases after 24 hrs. With light exposure, a remarkable enhancement of the EPR signal was noted for the doped materials as compared to the undoped ones.
The spectral parameters were deduced by a computer simulation program working at the second order of the perturbation theory (Table S1, ESI†). For all the samples, good fits were obtained considering the presence of only one type of free radicals. Therefore, the photo-generated radicals appear to be similar to those derived from exposure to oxygen or oxidation by the dopants, but the photo-generation of radicals with very short lifetime (<10−6 s) cannot be disregarded.49 The values of the g-factor are not affected by doping and are slightly higher for TTI samples indicating a higher orbital contribution, which implies that the unpaired electron resides longer on the nitrogen atoms. However, the most significant differences between both types of compounds are observed in the peak-to-peak linewidths. The signal observed for doped TTI is narrower than that of undoped or for the Spiro-OMeTAD solutions (c.a. 0.5 vs. 5 Gauss). To detect the signal without distorting it, it was necessary to reduce the modulation amplitude of the EPR experiment to 0.2 G (Fig. 2b).
In this type of free radicals solutions, the linewidth of the EPR signal is mainly related to the density of the solvent (molecular movements), the concentration of the paramagnetic effects (exchange/dipolar intermolecular interactions) and the mobility of the spins. The peak-to-peak linewidth of the undoped Spiro-OMeTAD is 6.1 G, while 4.7 G for the doped sample. Similar peak narrowing of the peak for Spiro-OMeTAD doped samples after light irradiation was reported, and was attributed to the exchange narrowing derived from the increase of radical concentrations caused by both the irradiation and the dopants.50 However, radical peak narrowing similar to the doped TTI was only observed for Spiro:LiTFSI:t-BP after 40 days of light exposure. This peak narrowing accompanied by a change from a Lorentzian to Gaussian profile of the EPR lines in perovskite-Spiro-OMeTAD films was attributed to the formation of mobile holes by light irradiation.51 In the present case, the concentration of spins is higher in the doped Spiro-OMeTAD than that of doped TTI solution, therefore the narrowing of the signal cannot be attributed only to the fast intermolecular exchange. In addition, the fit of the doped TTI EPR signal has been achieved with a 100% Lorentzian line shape. Arguably, the doping of TTI favors the formation of mobile holes under light exposure.
The photon absorption of the perovskite with HTMs shows a similar profile (Fig. 3a). To investigate the charge extraction behaviour at the perovskite/HTM interface, the steady state PL spectra of the perovskites were recorded (Fig. 3b). We noted significantly reduced PL emission of the perovskite (on the quartz) at 770 nm, after coating of TTI and quenching, displaying a similar profile as Spiro-OMeTAD. Slight discrepancy in the PL peaks can be ascribed to the higher valence band (EHOMO) of TTI as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD.

The cross-sectional SEM image of the TTI based PSC (Fig. 3c) shows the perovskite thickness of 450–500 nm and that of 30 mM TTI had a thickness of 73 nm. The microstructure of TTI with the perovskite (Fig. S5, ESI†) suggests a smooth surface that can enhance the interfacial contact between the perovskite and hole transporting layer.
To evaluate TTI as a potential core for the HTM in PSCs, we fabricated MAPbI3 based devices in both n-i-p configuration {FTO/bl-mesoTiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au} and p-i-n configuration {FTO/HTM/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag}.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the n-i-p based PSCs under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G are shown in Fig. 3d, while the corresponding PV parameters the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor, and PCE are listed in Table 1. The PSCs fabricated with TTI exhibited a PCE of 15.8%. (Jsc = 20.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 1003 mV, FF = 75.72%) with negligible hysteresis, while under similar conditions, the Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC yielded a PCE of 17.22% (Jsc = 22.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.014 V, FF = 75.37%). The device with TTI possessed similar Voc and comparable FF values but lower Jsc values as compared to the standard Spiro-OMeTAD. We ascribed the marginally lower performance to the mismatched energy levels and the slow rate of charge extraction arising from low mobility. The HOMO (as calculated from DFT) level of TTI is higher as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in lower open circuit voltage and lower short circuit current which could be ascribed to the low hole mobility of doped TTI.

The series resistance and shunt resistance for TTI based PSCs showed a value of 42.28 Ω and 43.53 kΩ whereas the derived value of Spiro-OMeTAD was 54.14 Ω and 85.22 kΩ. The statistics of fabricated PSCs with TTI exhibited a PCE of 15.13%, which is slightly lower than that of the PSC with Spiro-OMeTAD under the similar conditions. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded (Fig. 3e) and illustrates photon to current response covering the broad spectrum from 300 to 800 nm. An onset of photocurrent generation is displayed in the EQE spectra, which is in congruence with the band gap of the perovskite. Expectedly, the device with TTI exhibits a slightly lower EQE than that of Spiro-OMeTAD due to the lower Jsc value obtained. We measured the steady state output of TTI and Spiro-based PSCs for a short period of time (300 s) and the TTI based PSCs showed higher reliability as compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 3f).
Moreover, we further evaluated the long-term moisture and thermal stability of the PSCs (Fig. 4a and b). It can be deduced from the figure that 70% of its initial PCE was retained for the TTI based un-encapsulated device, kept at room temperature with a relative humidity of 50–60%. Furthermore, we noted nearly 80% of its initial PCE value retainment for TTI based PSCs upon thermal annealing at 85 °C, demonstrating its superior thermal stability. Notably, only 30 mM of TTI was employed as compared to 70 mM of Spiro-OMeTAD, this will further cut down the materials consumption and reduce the cost.

The hysteresis index (HI) was calculated by measuring the devices in both the forward scan (FS) and reverse scan (RS) direction (Fig. 4c and d). TTI based PSCs showed a low HI of 0.060 compared to Spiro-OMeTAD (0.084). The HI of the devices was calculated according to the equation:HI = [JRS (0.8 Voc) − JFS (0.8 Voc)]/JRS (0.8 Voc)
We believe that with further derivatization of TTI at different –NH positions and coupling will allow it to be an efficient and cost effective HTM. We also fabricated inverted PSCs with TTI as the HTM in a device architecture FTO/TTI/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. S6, ESI†). The PCE of the inverted PSCs with TTI exhibits 10.48% (Voc = 825 mV, Jsc = 23.43 mA cm−2 and FF = 54.19%).
Arguably, the four –NH groups with the electron pairs in the tetra-indole core of TTI can also act as Lewis bases and expectedly passivate the positively charged defects and trap states of the perovskite layer.52 The strong electron donating ability of the –NH group in TTI can help in coordinating with the Pb2+, leading to Lewis-adduct formation, that can deactivate the positively charged defects on the surface of the perovskite layer.
The placement of the interfacial layer can also be advantageous in improving the charge extraction at the interface and readily lowering the non-radiative recombination in the PSCs.53 Crystallinity of the perovskite upon passivation by TTI was analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. We noted that the diffraction peaks at 14.28° and 28.65° are related to the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite crystal (Fig. 5a). XRD peak intensities after TTI treatment tends to decrease slightly, plausibly due to the amorphous nature of the TTI passivated layer atop the perovskite, which suppresses the peak signal and buries the intensity.

The PV performance of the fabricated PSCs improved on treatment with TTI at the interface between the perovskite and the hole selective layer. We fabricated the PSCs in n-i-p configuration: FTO/bl-mesoTiO2/PSK/TTI/Spiro-OMeTAD. The cross-sectional SEM image of the TTI treated device, along with the surface images of the perovskite layer with and without TTI treatment is presented in Fig. 5b–d.
To decipher the coordination between TTI and perovskite, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The core level peak of C 1s spectra shows the presence of TTI on the surface of the perovskite layer (Fig. 6a and b).54 The binding energy of Pb core electrons in Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 was shifted by 1.7 eV towards higher ionization potentials (Fig. 6c), which experimentally indicates the formation of covalent bonds between TTI and Pb atoms in the perovskite. Moreover, N 1s peak shifting and increase in the number of N atoms in the TTI treated perovskites indicate the increment in electron cloud density of the lone pairs of N-atoms interacting with the Pb2+ ions of the perovskite. The I 3d peak of the TTI treated perovskite (Fig. S7, ESI†) shows the different binding energies of the organic structure on the surface of the perovskite.

The adopted PSCs architecture substantiates the effective transport of charges (Fig. 7a), and the band alignment of TTI with respect to perovskites (Fig. 7b). The J–V curves upon TTI passivation (Fig. 7c) show improvement in the PCE. The PSCs with MAPbI3 showed an initial PCE of 17.64% (Voc = 1027 mV, Jsc = 22.90 mA cm−2, FF = 74.92%) while a superior PCE of 19.23% (Voc = 1070 mV, Jsc = 23.55 mA cm−2, FF = 76.29%) was measured upon TTI treatment (Table 2). The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are extracted from the J–V curves; while the Rs values are nearly similar, Rsh was increased intensely for the TTI treated PSCs. This further ascribes the suppression of the shunting current pathway upon TTI passivation. We calculated the hysteresis index (HI) (Fig. S8, ESI†), for pristine PSCs (0.176) and the HI value reduces to 0.07 for TTI passivated PSCs. The reduced HI suggests reduction in trap-state density of the perovskite with TTI passivation. From the PSC statistics, it is evident that the average values of the PV parameters improved upon TTI passivation (Fig. S9, ESI†). The average Voc increases from 1020 ± 9.3 mV to 1070 ± 10 mV, which is attributed to the decreased non-radiative recombination and enhanced charge carrier lifetime. The average FF improved from 75 ± 4.26 to 76 ± 1.58 due to improved hole extraction and reduced density of traps. Similarly, the overall PCE is improved from 17.64 ± 1.12 to 19.23 ± 0.42 with TTI passivated PSCs. In the EQE for the TTI treated and pristine PSCs (Fig. 7d), an onset of photocurrent generation was noted which is in congruence with the band gap of the perovskite. In the whole spectrum region, the PSCs with TTI passivation exhibit an improved EQE.

The photo-carrier density increases in the photoactive layer in the case of reduced non-radiative charge recombination. The quasi-Fermi-level splitting, in this case, is enhanced, which thereby increases the build-in-potential (Vbi) of the PSCs and subsequently gives improved PCE. We measured the Mott Schottky plot made under dark conditions (Fig. 7e) for pristine and TTI passivated PSCs. The build-in potential (Vbi) and depletion layer width (W) are derived from C−2–V plots.55,56 An improved build in potential of 740 mV for the TTI treated PSC was extracted, at 10 kHz, while the pristine PSC gave a value of 734 mV. The calculated Vbi value for the TTI treated device is slightly higher as compared to the untreated one, which ascribes enhanced charge extraction and high photocurrent. Additionally, with the increase in the build in potential Vbi, we calculated the depletion width (W) for pristine PSCs and the TTI passivated PSC (, where ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, Vbi is the build in potential, N is the density of fully ionized defects). The depletion layer width (W) was calculated to be 168.51 nm for the pristine PSC, and this increases to 198.55 nm for TTI passivated PSCs.
To further substantiate the passivation effects, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis was performed (Fig. 7f), and the spectral analysis provides insight into the charge transfer and recombination behavior.57,58 The Nyquist plots were measured in the dark at 0.8 V. We deduced that the recombination resistance in the TTI passivated PSC (larger semicircle) is higher as compared to the pristine PSCs, and TTI passivation leads to larger recombination resistance and elucidates its role in passivating the defects.
The charge transfer resistance and recombination resistance as a function of voltage (Fig. 7g and h) were derived from Nyquist plots (Fig. 7f and Fig. S10, ESI†), which display a single arc and the used equivalent circuit model is shown. The profile of the recombination resistance follows a similar trend and at voltage close to Voc, it displays lower recombination, suggesting that the key contribution of recombination processes is in the bulk of the perovskite. With the passivation of TTI, higher recombination resistance was noted, suggesting its use to suppress non-radiative recombination losses. Recombination resistance, near to the Voc, is higher for TTI passivated PSCs, pointing to a reduction in the non-radiative recombination defects. Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance was lower for TTI treated PSCs, which we ascribed to the filling of grain boundaries as well as defects passivation.
The passivation of the perovskite layer by TTI is expected to enhance the stability of the PSCs. We investigated the impact of thermal and atmospheric stability on the perovskite and TTI passivated perovskite (Fig. 8a). The optical absorbance spectra were recorded for the freshly prepared films with and without TTI treatment (Fig. S11a, ESI†). The films were left for ageing under continuous heating at 85 °C (ambient atmosphere) and the absorbance spectra were recorded accordingly (Fig. S11b and c, ESI†). Our results indicate that the absorption onset of the TTI treated perovskite was similar and the dark color of the perovskite was also maintained, while the pristine perovskite shows degradation (yellow colored) upon continuous heating and exposure to the ambient atmospheric conditions. The TTI passivated perovskite film showed excellent stability upon continuous exposure to relative humidity and heat. We studied the long-term stability and measured the PCE with and without TTI passivation, periodically (stored in a dry box, 30–40% relative humidity at RT) for a period of 36 days. The PCE values of the PSCs with TTI maintained about 90% of their initial values whereas the pristine PSCs retained only 77% of their initial values after 36 days (Fig. 8b). The hydrophobicity induced by TTI can also be deduced by the contact angle measurement (Fig. 8c), which showed a higher angle of 96° for the TTI treated as compared to the untreated one 80°, this will induce device stability.

Conclusions
A tetra-indole based core as a small molecule was introduced and probed as a hole transporting material. TTI gave competitive performance when used as hole selective layers in perovskite solar cells, furthermore, the photovoltaic performance was improved when used as a passivating agent. A PCE of 19.23% was obtained when TTI was placed as an interfacial layer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggests that TTI helped in reducing the defects by reducing the non-radiative recombination. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of TTI helped in enhancing the stability of the device. We believe that further derivatization of the TTI core will accelerate its investigation as effective hole transporting materials to rival the use of Spiro-OMeTAD. Our approach suggests its dual functionality as a hole transporting material as well as substituting the use of organic moieties and complementary improvement in the defects in the perovskite layer.
Experimental
Materials
2-Oxindole and POCl3 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lead iodide (99.9%) was procured from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) and employed as such. Methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol. Solvents DMF, DMSO, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and chlorobenzene were purchased from Acros Chemicals and used as such.
Synthesis of TTI
Solution of indoline-2-one (5g, 37.55 mmol) in POCl3 (25 mL) was stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 8 hours. After cooling the mixture, it was slowly poured into ice water and stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture solution was slowly neutralized by adding KOH solution under continuous stirring. A dark green crude was obtained after extraction. The crude product was purified using silica gel column chromatography adding pure DCM to obtain TTI (16.27%) and TAT (18.1%) as pale-yellow solids. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ ppm; 11.43 (s, 4H), 7.57 (d, J = 7.6, 4H), 7.41 (d, j = 7.7, 4H), 7.07 (m, 8H); 13C (125 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ ppm; 137.75, 135.23, 127.81, 121.73, 120.02, 119.17, 111.80, 105.99.
Device fabrication
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (NSG11) was cleaned in sequence prior to use by ultrasonication (2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 minutes) followed by rinsing with deionized water, acetone and then isopropanol (IPA). Finally, the electrodes were treated under UV-ozone for 30 minutes for the removal of residues on the surface. The TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate via spray pyrolysis at 500 °C using a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol (1:19). Post spray, the substrates were left at 500 °C for further 30 minutes and allowed to cool down. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on these electrodes through a spin coating process (30 s at 4000 rpm); for this, a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) was diluted to 1:8 in ethanol. The electrodes were annealed first at 125 °C, followed by 500 °C using a programmable ramp in four-step heating and were then maintained at 500 °C for 30 min to acquire an anatase phase. On attaining room temperature, the substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 30 minutes and transferred to an argon-filled glove-box for perovskite layer deposition. The precursor solution for preparing the MAPbI3 was prepared by dissolving MAI (1.2 M) and PbI2 (1.2 M) in DMSO. The perovskite solution was spin coated in a two-step sequence at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 s and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 110 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped as an antisolvent approach on the substrate 5 s prior to the end of the spinning process. The perovskite coated substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 50 min in a glovebox. On acquiring room temperature, the hole selective layer of TTI (30 mM) was deposited. Spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM) was prepared by dissolving the corresponding amount of materials in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The HTLs were doped by adding bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) in the molar ratio of 0.5 and 3.3, respectively. 40 μL of HTM solutions were spin-coated atop of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s, in an argon filled glove box. For the passivation of the MAPbI3 layer, 3 mg mL−1 TTI was dissolved and spin coated on top of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 7 min. The device was finished by evaporating the Au layer of 75 nm as a cathode under a low vacuum (10−6 torr). All solutions were prepared inside an argon-filled glove box with controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (O2 <10 ppm, H2O <2 ppm).
Device characterization
The device photovoltaic parameters were acquired by means of current density–voltage (J–V) curves, logged with a Keithley 2400 source-meter under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination from a 450 W AAA solar simulator (ORIEL, 94023 A). The NREL certified monocrystalline silicon solar cell was used for calibration. A black metal mask (0.1 cm2) was used over the square size active area (0.5 cm2) to reduce the influence of scattered light. The devices were measured at a scan rate: 100 mV s−1, pre-sweep delay: 10 s. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a 150 W xenon lamp attached to a Bentham PVE300 motorized 1/4 m monochromator as the light source.
Thin film characterization
The surface microstructure with and without the passivation layer was examined by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thin films were prepared on the quartz substrate by spin coating for structural characterization; the films were prepared by spin coating of MAPbI3 and 3 mg mL−1 TTI/PSK treatment. X-Ray diffractograms were recorded using the D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg-Brentano geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 angstroms). A scan of 5–10° was selected with an acquisition time of 1° min−1. The absorption spectra were recorded on an UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer). Photoluminescence (PL) steady state measurements were recorded with a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instrument LS55). XPS measurements were carried out on a SPECS system (Berlin, Germany) equipped with the Phoibos 150 ID-DLD analyzer with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.7 eV).
