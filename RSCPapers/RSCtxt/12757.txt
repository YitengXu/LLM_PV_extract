    , Accepted 18th April 2019First published on 18th April 2019Abstractβ-FeSi2, a semiconductor material made of two of the most earth-abundant elements, has important applications in thermoelectrics, photovoltaics and optoelectronics owing to its attractive properties such as suitable band gap and air stability over a wide temperature range. While point defects always play a vital role in semiconductor materials, only sporadic studies have been dedicated to the defects in β-FeSi2. Here, using first-principles calculations we systematically investigate the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2. Our results reveal that the formation energies of the intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2 are high enough to prevent them from forming in a significant concentration under thermal equilibrium growth conditions. As a possible kinetic process generating intrinsic defects, we study the α-to-β phase transition of FeSi2. We find that the phase transition is a slow process occurring on the time scale of an hour. Incomplete phase transition may lead to kinetically formed intrinsic defects. We further calculate the activation energies of the intrinsic defects and show that the experimentally observed conductivity of pure β-FeSi2 should be a result of unintentional doping. Possible extrinsic impurities that may lead to n-type and p-type conductivity and their activation energies are calculated, which are in good agreement with available experiments. Our results provide guidance for optimizing the doping strategy of β-FeSi2 for device applications.
1. Introduction
Transition metal silicides have attracted significant attention in the past decades partly because of their important applications in the integrated circuit (IC) industry.1 Among a large number of silicides, β-FeSi2 is one of the few semiconductors possessing a sizable band gap and promising for thermoelectric, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic applications.2–4 β-FeSi2 has an optical bandgap of 0.80–0.87 eV, which is relevant to optical fiber communication at a wavelength of about 1500 nm.5 Several experimental results indicated that β-FeSi2 can have a direct bandgap so that it can be used for light emitting diodes and integrated into Si ICs.6,7 β-FeSi2 has also been considered as a candidate for applications in solar cells owing to its high optical absorption coefficient exceeding 105 cm−1 at 1.0 eV and a theoretical efficiency of 16–23%.8,9 Furthermore, β-FeSi2 as a conventional thermoelectric material has been studied for several decades because of its air stability at high temperature and the non-toxic and abundant constituent elements.4,10–12
Intrinsic point defects play an important role in governing the transport properties of semiconductors, such as the type, concentration and mobility of charge carriers, which have a great impact on the performance of the thermoelectric, photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. It is reported that the native point defects strongly influence the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of β-FeSi2, hence the thermoelectric performance.13,14 Recent research also suggests that the regulation of atomic scale intrinsic point defects is able to simultaneously optimize the thermal and electrical properties and becomes an appealing strategy to enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit (or zT).15–17 A large number of dopant elements across the periodic table have been incorporated into β-FeSi2 to tune its thermoelectric properties.18 The highest achieved zT is typically between 0.25 and 0.3 for both n-type and p-type materials.4,10,19–21 It is worth noting that mixing of Si0.8Ge0.2 and rare-metal oxides, such as Er2O3 and Sm2O3, into β-FeSi2 has been reported to boost the zT to above 0.5.22,23
Moreover, the level of self-doping and the rate of nonradiative recombination of the photo-excited or electrically injected carriers are greatly affected by the intrinsic shallow and deep defects.24,25 For example, the solar cells and light-emitting diodes based on β-FeSi2 films usually contain a significant number of residual carriers, which are responsible for the low performance of the devices and have been attributed to the presence of intrinsic point defects.26,27 The best power conversion efficiency of β-FeSi2 obtained so far was 3.7%.28 The difficulty in increasing the efficiency has been attributed to the control of stoichiometry, conducting type and doping concentration.29
Despite the wide interest in this material and the importance of defects, the theoretical study on the intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2 has been surprisingly rare. Two previous studies reported density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the defects in β-FeSi2.30,31 But these studies only considered the vacancy defects and the conduction type of the defects was only conjectured by inspecting the calculated density of states (DOS). Silicon vacancies (VSi) have been proposed to be the main defect in β-FeSi2. Since these two preliminary reports, no further theoretical study has been conducted to the best of our knowledge even though the defect properties are still far from being understood. In particular, whether other types of defects, such as interstitials and even antisites, are thermodynamically more stable than the vacancies, whether such defects are shallow or deep defects, and how these defects affect the conduction type observed in experiments remain unknown.
In this paper, using DFT-based first-principles calculations we study the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2. In addition to the vacancies, we consider the interstitial defects at all possible positions, as well as the Fe-on-Si (FeSi) and Si-on-Fe (SiFe) antisite defects. Different from the previous conclusion that VSi is the most thermodynamically stable intrinsic defect in β-FeSi2, we find that Fe interstitial (Fei) is significantly more stable than VSi. We further calculate the activation energies of all the intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2 and determine their types (i.e., donor or acceptor). As a comparison, we study the intrinsic defects in α-FeSi2, a high-temperature metallic phase, and find that Fe vacancies (VFe) have a very low formation energy resulting in non-stoichiometry as reflected in the Fe–Si phase diagram. As β-FeSi2 is often prepared from the α-FeSi2 phase at high temperature, we propose a diffusive phase transition mechanism between the α and β phases and discuss the connection between the phase transition and defect formation.
2. Computational methods
Our DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).32,33 The projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to describe the interaction between the ion-cores and valence electrons.34 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation was used for the exchange–correlation functional.35 To evaluate the reliability of the PBE functional, we also checked the recently developed SCAN functional36 and the hybrid HSE functional.37 We found that the band gaps from the PBE (0.70 eV) and SCAN (0.99 eV) calculations straddle the experimental values (0.8–0.87 eV). However, the band gap from the HSE calculation, 1.63 eV, is significantly larger than the experimental values. The band structures from the SCAN and HSE functionals are shown in the ESI† Fig. S1. In this work, we will mainly present the results from the PBE functional. The comparisons between the PBE and SCAN results on the defect properties are given in the ESI† Fig. S2.
The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis was set to 544 eV. The supercell method was employed to model the defects. We used a 96-atom supercell and a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh38 to sample the Brillouin zone. The activation energies were calculated using a larger 768-atom supercell and Γ-point sampling. All calculations were spin-polarized. The atomic structures were fully relaxed until the calculated Hellmann–Feynman forces on all atoms were less than 1.5 meV Å−1. For β-FeSi2, the simulated annealing method was used to ensure that the optimized defect structures are not trapped in metastable configurations.39,40 The simulated annealing calculation included 7500 molecular dynamics steps for ramping up the temperature to 1500 K, 10000 steps staying at 1500 K and 15000 steps cooling down to 0 K. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method41 was adopted to study the phase transition between α-FeSi2 and β-FeSi2.
The formation energy of a point defect carrying a charge q was calculated following42,43 (1)where EqD is the total energy of the supercell containing a point defect of charge q and E0 is the total energy of a perfect supercell of the host. ni is the number of atoms which are added (ni < 0) or removed (ni > 0) from the host during the formation of the defects. μi is the chemical potential of the constituent element i. Here, we express μi explicitly with respect to the reference energy Ei, which is the total energy per atom in its stable phase. The allowed range for μi is determined by the existence of various secondary phases (i.e., other FexSiy phases in the present case). εVBM is the energy of the valence-band maximum (VBM) of the host material. The Fermi energy εF generally varies between εVBM and the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of the host material.
For calculations on the charged defects, a uniform counter charge was added to the supercell to compensate the charge on the defect. In such calculations, the EqD term in eqn (1) contains an error due to the electrostatic interaction between the charge and its periodic images. In this work, we used a large supercell of 768 atoms to reduce this error. Considering that the dielectric constant of β-FeSi2 is large (about 24),44 we expect that the error is small. We also checked the possible errors in our calculated defect activation energies using the sxdefectalign program.45 The correction to the results obtained by the 768-atom supercell is always smaller than 0.055 eV. The comparison between the results obtained with and without the correction is presented in the ESI† Fig. S3. In the following, we show the results without the correction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures and electronic structure of β-FeSi2
β-FeSi2 has a distorted fluorite structure with the space group of Cmca, having a base-centered orthorhombic lattice. The conventional unit cell contains 16 formula units (f.u.) of FeSi2 and the primitive cell is half the size. Both Fe and Si occupy two different Wyckoff positions. Fe1 and Fe2 occupy the 8d and 8f sites, respectively. Both Si1 and Si2 occupy the 16g sites. To differentiate the positions, Fig. 1 shows the two types of each element in different colors. We find that it is convenient to view the β-FeSi2 structure as formed by stacking two atomic slabs, which are shifted from each other by a/2 and b/2 as illustrated in Fig. 1. This view is also helpful in identifying the three inequivalent interstitial sites, which are marked in Fig. 1a as i1, i2 and i3, respectively. Overall, the structure is topologically the same as the fluorite structure, where the Si atoms form a cubic-like lattice with the Fe atoms occupying every second void along the three directions. So, the number of unoccupied voids (i.e., the interstitial sites) is the same as that of the occupied voids. Among the 16 interstitial sites per unit cell, four are i1, eight are i2, and four are i3.
 Fig. 1  Top (a) and side (b) view of β-FeSi2. The unit cell is indicated by grey frames. The red and pink spheres represent the Fe1 and Fe2 atoms, respectively. The blue and green spheres represent the Si1 and Si2 atoms, respectively. The three inequivalent interstitial sites are marked by i1, i2 and i3, respectively. In both the top and side views, the first and third panels show two identical atomic slabs, which are shifted from each other by a/2 and b/2. The Fe2 atoms are located within these slabs. Stacking the two slabs and inserting the Fe1 atoms between them (shown in the second panels) gives rise to the unit cell of β-FeSi2 (shown in the fourth panels). 
The band structure of β-FeSi2 is shown in Fig. 2a. Our calculation shows that β-FeSi2 without being strained is an indirect-gap semiconductor. Our calculated band gap is 0.70 eV, slightly smaller than the experimental values of 0.80–0.87 eV.5 The direct transition at the Y point (0.75 eV) is only slightly larger than the indirect gap as a result of the flat bottom conduction band. Fig. 2b shows the charge density plots of the VBM and CBM states. They are both dominated by the Fe d character. The VBM state shows significant delocalization which explains the relatively large dispersion of the top valence band near the VBM. In contrast, the CBM state consists of highly localized d orbitals in accord with the flat bottom of the conduction band.

(b) Charge density plots of the VBM and CBM states. 
3.2 Formation energy of the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2
The formation energies of the defects are a function of chemical potentials as in eqn (1) above. We need to first evaluate the allowed region for the chemical potentials μFe and μSi. For this purpose, we consider the possible phases of the Fe–Si system. Fig. 3 shows the phase diagram of the Fe–Si system.46 It can be seen that Fe and Si form five compounds, namely, Fe2Si (β), Fe5Si3 (η), FeSi (ε), and the two phases of FeSi2. It is noted that in the phase diagram, the two phases of FeSi2 are more formally referred to as ζα and ζβ, respectively, in order to differentiate with the β compound, i.e., Fe2Si. But, throughout this paper, we will follow the majority of the literature to refer to the two FeSi2 phases as α-FeSi2 and β-FeSi2.
 Fig. 3  The Fe–Si binary phase diagram.46 By definition, β, η, and ε compounds refer to Fe2Si, Fe5Si3, and FeSi, respectively. ζβ and ζα compounds in the phase diagram correspond to β-FeSi2 and α-FeSi2 as so-called in this paper. 
We calculated the enthalpy of formation of all the Fe–Si phases with respect to bulk iron (in the bcc structure) and silicon (in the diamond structure). Fe2Si, Fe5Si3, FeSi, α-FeSi2, and β-FeSi2 have space groups of Pm1 (#164),47P63/mcm (#193),47P213 (#198),48P4/mmm (#123),49 and Cmca (#64), respectively. In addition, we also considered the ordered Fe3Si phase having the space group of F3m (#216),50 which corresponds to the right edge of the α1 region (or D03 phase) in Fig. 3 at the low-temperature range from 500 to 700 °C. Note that this Fe3Si phase is not explicitly marked in the phase diagram as a compound.46
Following the standard method,42,43,51 we used the calculated enthalpy of formation to determine the allowed region of the chemical potentials μFe and μSi, on which β-FeSi2 is thermodynamically stable. As shown in Fig. 4, with decreasing (i.e., more Si-poor), three phases appear as the thermodynamically stable phase in sequence, i.e., β-FeSi2, FeSi and Fe3Si, while Fe2Si and Fe5Si3 are not stable. This result is consistent with the phase diagram in Fig. 3, where it shows that at low temperature only β-FeSi2, FeSi and Fe3Si are stable. According to our calculation, α-FeSi2 is less stable than β-FeSi2 by 0.18 eV per f.u. and not shown in Fig. 4. The agreement between our results and the phase diagram suggests the reliability of our calculation method. We made a quantitative comparison of our calculated enthalpies of formation with those obtained by the CALPHAD method in a recent work.52 As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the two sets of data show the same trend, but our DFT-PBE results are larger than the CALPHAD results.
 Fig. 4  The calculated stable region of β-FeSi2 in the chemical potential space spanned by μFe and μSi. Each straight line corresponds to x μFe + y μSi = ΔH(FexSiy). The allowed region is marked by a thick blue line. The inset shows a comparison of the ΔHs calculated by DFT-PBE and CALPHAD methods. 
After determining the allowed chemical potential region, we calculated the defect formation energies between the Si-rich and Fe-rich conditions, as highlighted by a thick blue line in Fig. 4. The results are shown in Fig. 5a. We studied totally 14 defects for β-FeSi2 including two VFe, two VSi, three Fei, three Sii, two FeSi, and two SiFe. For the vacancies, VFe2 is lower in energy than VFe1 by 0.07 eV and VSi1 is lower than VSi2 by 0.05 eV. For the Fe interstitial, the energies vary more significantly at the three different sites as marked in Fig. 1. Fei at site i3 is lower in energy than that at sites i1 and i2 by 1.32 and 0.12 eV, respectively. Sii at all three sites relaxed to the i1 site after simulated annealing. For the antisite defects, FeSi2 is more stable than FeSi1 by 0.76 eV and SiFe2 is more stable than SiFe1 by 0.13 eV.
 Fig. 5  The formation energies of the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2 (a) and α-FeSi2 (b) as a function of chemical potentials between the Si-rich and Fe-rich conditions (see Fig. 4). 
In Fig. 5a, we only show the lowest formation energy for each type of defect. Our calculations show that Fei has the lowest formation energy nearly regardless of the chemical potential, except that near the Si-rich limit VFe becomes the most stable defect. Our results are in contrast to the previous DFT calculation on this system, where only the vacancy defects were considered.31 In this earlier work, it was found that the VSi defect has the lowest formation energy. Overall, the formation energies of all intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2 are relatively high, which indicates that β-FeSi2 is a thermodynamically stable phase and the concentration of intrinsic defects is low if the material is grown under conditions close to thermal equilibrium. Taking the most stable defect Fei as an example, at the Fe-rich limit its formation energy is about 1.75 eV. Considering the density of possible interstitial sites of about 2.7 × 1022 cm−3 and 900 K annealing temperature, the concentration of Fei is only about 9 × 1012 cm−3. With such a low concentration, the intrinsic defects under thermal equilibrium conditions usually do not play a significant role in the electronic properties of the material.
As a comparison, we also studied the intrinsic defects in the high-temperature metallic phase α-FeSi2. Because of the higher symmetry, both Fe and Si have only one possible site. So, we considered 6 defects, namely, VFe, VSi, Fei, Sii, FeSi, and SiFe for α-FeSi2. The results are shown in Fig. 5b. The most prominent result is that the Fe vacancy has a very low formation energy, which even becomes negative under Si-rich conditions. This result suggests that α-FeSi2 in its stoichiometric form is not a thermodynamically stable phase because the Fe vacancies tend to form spontaneously. Our results are consistent with the phase diagram in Fig. 3, where it can be seen that the ζα compound (i.e., α-FeSi2) is non-stoichiometric. Also, the ζα compound exists in a wide composition range suggesting that this phase can be stabilized with a wide range of VFe concentration. In the literature, different compositions have been used to describe the α-FeSi2 phase, such as, Fe2Si553,54 and Fe3Si7.55 Based on our result, it is more appropriate to refer to this phase as Fe-deficient α-FeSi2.
3.3 Defects generated from the α-to-β phase transition of FeSi2
By confirming the low defect formation energy of VFe in α-FeSi2, we can be more confident of the calculated high formation energies for the intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2, as shown in Fig. 5a. We can conclude that any significant concentration of intrinsic defects in a sample only resulted from kinetic processes. Next, we discuss one of such possible processes, i.e., the phase transition from α-FeSi2 to β-FeSi2. Fig. 6a illustrates a possible path for this phase change. The β-FeSi2 structure is a distorted fluorite structure (or γ-FeSi2). Without the distortion, as can be seen in Fig. 6a, both phases can be viewed as a simple cubic-like lattice formed by the Si atoms with the Fe atoms occupying the voids either in a layer-by-layer (α-FeSi2) or a 3D checkerboard (β-FeSi2) pattern. The phase change can be accomplished as illustrated in Fig. 6a, i.e., every second Fe atom in the α-FeSi2 phase moves to a neighbouring cubic void. This process represents a diffusive phase transition.
 Fig. 6  (a) Schematic showing the phase transition from α-FeSi2 to β-FeSi2. For clarity, both phases are represented by a simple cubic Si lattice, i.e., without the tetragonal and orthorhombic distortions. The two phases can be related by a phase transition through the diffusion of every second Fe atom into a neighboring void. (b) The diffusion barrier (upper panel) for an Fe atom in α-FeSi2. The lower panels show the diffusion path, where the diffusion direction is marked by a blue arrow and the diffusing Fe atom is marked by a blue dashed circle. 
In the case of the diffusive phase transition, studying the diffusion barrier Eb for an Fe atom to an interstitial site could provide useful information on the kinetics of the phase transition. We used the NEB method to study this process. A 96-atom supercell of α-FeSi2 was used in this calculation, where a single Fe atom was displaced from its original position to its neighboring void, as illustrated in Fig. 6b (bottom panels). Because the diffusion path is simple, we only employed a single intermediate NEB image. To confirm that the converged intermediate image is indeed a transition state, we performed frequency calculation and made sure that there was only a single imaginary mode, which corresponds to the diffusion path. As shown in Fig. 6b, the calculated Eb is 3.7 eV, while the energy difference between the initial and final structures is 1.5 eV. The 3.7 eV barrier is rather high. Considering that the phase transition occurs at 937 °C (see Fig. 3) and a pre-exponential factor ν of 1013 Hz, the rate for a diffusion event to occur is estimated to be 0.004 Hz according to νexp(−Eb/kT), i.e., one event per 250 seconds. Our result suggests that the α-to-β transition is a slow process. Estimated using the 96-atom supercell, the overall time for the phase transition is on the order of an hour. The slow α-to-β transition has also been noted experimentally.18 It should be mentioned that the estimation above only represents the situation at the very early stage of the transition. The barriers could be lowered in the middle of the transition when disorder is introduced into the system.
A consequence of the slow diffusive phase transition described above is the formation of intrinsic defects due to incomplete transition, particularly the Fe-related defects. If some Fe atoms remain undiffused to the “right” positions, Fe interstitials will form. Meanwhile, Fe vacancies will form simultaneously. The Fe deficiency in α-FeSi2 might also be inherited by β-FeSi2, yielding extra VFe defects. Another special example is that Fei and VFe come close to each other forming a Frenkel pair. In general, the materials may not always be prepared under thermal equilibrium conditions. In such cases, intrinsic defects will form kinetically. The incomplete α-to-β phase transition discussed above is just one of the possible kinetic processes. In order to develop a full understanding of the electronic properties of this material, it is still necessary to know the electronic behavior of the intrinsic defects.
3.4 Defect transition levels in β-FeSi2
For β-FeSi2, it is usually difficult to reduce the carrier concentration to below 1017 cm−3 and the undoped samples usually show n-type conductivity.56 There is still a lack of direct evidence whether these behaviors result from intrinsic or extrinsic defects. Information like the type (donor or acceptor) of the intrinsic defects and the positions of their defect transition levels (i.e., activation energies) in the band gap is critically important, but still absent in the literature for β-FeSi2.
It was previously reported that VSi is an acceptor defect and VFe is a donor.30,31 These predictions, however, were based on inspection of calculated DOS, which is only a qualitative assignment. Also, the calculations were done without considering the spin polarization. While stoichiometric β-FeSi2 is non-magnetic, some of the intrinsic defects do exhibit spin magnetic moments and, therefore, the spin-polarized calculation is necessary. Instead of simply inspecting the DOS plots, we followed the standard approach51 to determine the defect transition levels for the intrinsic defects. For a transition from charge state q to q′, the transition level is given by (2)where EqD carries the same meaning as in eqn (1). To avoid the possible errors associated with the image charge interaction in high charge states,57 we only consider the ε(0/+) and ε(0/−) transitions, which are sufficient to determine the type of the defects. We also employed a much larger supercell containing 768 atoms in the defect transition level calculations. We note that for neutral charge calculations, the supercell size effect is minor. Even a 48-atom supercell already gives rise to converged defect formation energies.

Fig. 7 shows the formation energy of the intrinsic defects in different charge states as a function of the Fermi level, where a crossing point between two lines defines the transition and the corresponding position of the Fermi level is the transition level. According to our calculation, the most stable defect Fei is a deep donor, with a (0/+) transition level located at about 0.35 eV below the CBM. The negatively charged state of Fei always has higher energy than the neutral charge state as long as the Fermi level is located within the band gap, suggesting that Fei cannot be an acceptor. The Sii defect is also a deep donor and the (0/+) transition level is located at 0.27 eV below the CBM. For the vacancies, we found that VFe is an amphoteric defect, meaning that it could be either an acceptor or a donor depending on the Fermi level of the system. The donor and acceptor levels are located at 0.52 eV below the CBM and 0.43 eV above the VBM, respectively. Our result is different from the previous report that VFe is a donor,30,31 which was concluded based on inspection of the DOS plots. VSi was found to be a shallow acceptor, as will be further discussed below. Both the antisite defects, FeSi and SiFe, are amphoteric and tend to directly switch between 1+ and 1− states without passing the neutral state. The Frenkel pair defect mentioned earlier was found to behave similarly to FeSi and SiFe in Fig. 7 with a (+/−) transition occurring at about 0.24 eV above the VBM.
 Fig. 7  The calculated formation energy of neutral and charged defects in β-FeSi2 as a function of the Fermi energy of the system. The calculations were done under Fe-rich conditions. The crossing points of different charge states correspond to the thermodynamic defect transition levels (or activation energies). The results were obtained using a 768-atom supercell. 
In general, the deep-level defects will not contribute a significant number of carriers. They can only serve as compensating defects when the material is to be doped. Taking Fei as an example, this defect is a donor, but it will not contribute electrons to the conduction band due to the deep transition level of 0.35 eV below the CBM. The Fei defects, however, will take effect as a compensating defect when β-FeSi2 is to be doped to p-type. As no shallow donors exist among the intrinsic defects, our results suggest that n-type undoped β-FeSi2 should be a result of unintentional doping by extrinsic elements.58,59 Among the intrinsic defects, only VSi shows shallow acceptor behavior. It may explain the p-type conductivity for undoped β-FeSi2. However, extrinsic p-type impurities cannot be excluded.
To better guide the experimental identification of the possible impurities, we examined 18 elements that are located three columns to the left and right of Fe in the periodic table. Fig. 8 shows the calculated results. As the purpose of this study is to provide a trend for these elements, we used the 96-atom supercell. Our results show that V and Cr are candidates for p-type impurities by yielding the lowest acceptor levels, while Pt is the most efficient n-type impurity by yielding the highest donor level. These results are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings.56 In ESI† Fig. S4, we show the results from the SCAN functional. While the general trends are consistent between the PBE and SCAN results, the SCAN functional produces deeper transition levels in most cases, including Pt. Nevertheless, from both methods, Rh, Ir and Au show consistently shallow donor levels and V, Cr, Nb and Ta show consistently shallow acceptor levels. It is worth noting that the nearest neighbors of Fe in the periodic table, Mn and Co, are not the most efficient p-type and n-type dopants on the Fe sites due to the relatively deep transition levels. Predicting the actual efficiency of a dopant also requires knowledge of the defect formation energy, which determines the miscibility of the dopant element in the lattice. We will defer such a study to future work.

4. Conclusions
Based on first-principles calculations, we performed a systematic study on the properties of the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2. We considered the vacancies, interstitials and antisite defects and revealed that the Fe interstitials have the lowest formation energy. But the formation energy is still high enough to prevent them from forming in a significant concentration under thermal equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the intrinsic defects should only play a role when they are formed kinetically. One of such kinetic processes, the α-to-β phase transition, was studied. The defects possibly resulting from this process include Fei, VFe and Fe Frenkel pairs. We studied the types of the intrinsic defects in β-FeSi2 by calculating their activation energies. Only the Si vacancy shows shallow acceptor behavior, while other defects only show deep transition levels. Therefore, experimentally observed n-type conductivity in undoped β-FeSi2 should be a result of non-intentional doping by extrinsic elements. Based on our results from both PBE and SCAN functionals, Rh, Ir, Pt and Au could be efficient donors and V, Cr, Nb and Ta could be efficient acceptors. The results reported in this work are expected to provide a useful guide when optimizing the doping strategy of β-FeSi2 for device applications.

Table Content:
	(1)

 	Fig. 1  Top (a) and side (b) view of β-FeSi2. The unit cell is indicated by grey frames. The red and pink spheres represent the Fe1 and Fe2 atoms, respectively. The blue and green spheres represent the Si1 and Si2 atoms, respectively. The three inequivalent interstitial sites are marked by i1, i2 and i3, respectively. In both the top and side views, the first and third panels show two identical atomic slabs, which are shifted from each other by a/2 and b/2. The Fe2 atoms are located within these slabs. Stacking the two slabs and inserting the Fe1 atoms between them (shown in the second panels) gives rise to the unit cell of β-FeSi2 (shown in the fourth panels).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The band structure of β-FeSi2. The high-symmetry points correspond to the Brillouin zone of the 24-atom primitive cell. The VBM is located at the Y point and the CBM is between the Γ and Z points. The direct gap of 0.75 eV and the indirect gap of 0.70 eV are marked in the plot. (b) Charge density plots of the VBM and CBM states.	 

 	Fig. 3  The Fe–Si binary phase diagram.46 By definition, β, η, and ε compounds refer to Fe2Si, Fe5Si3, and FeSi, respectively. ζβ and ζα compounds in the phase diagram correspond to β-FeSi2 and α-FeSi2 as so-called in this paper.	 

 	Fig. 4  The calculated stable region of β-FeSi2 in the chemical potential space spanned by μFe and μSi. Each straight line corresponds to x μFe + y μSi = ΔH(FexSiy). The allowed region is marked by a thick blue line. The inset shows a comparison of the ΔHs calculated by DFT-PBE and CALPHAD methods.	 

 	Fig. 5  The formation energies of the intrinsic point defects in β-FeSi2 (a) and α-FeSi2 (b) as a function of chemical potentials between the Si-rich and Fe-rich conditions (see Fig. 4).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Schematic showing the phase transition from α-FeSi2 to β-FeSi2. For clarity, both phases are represented by a simple cubic Si lattice, i.e., without the tetragonal and orthorhombic distortions. The two phases can be related by a phase transition through the diffusion of every second Fe atom into a neighboring void. (b) The diffusion barrier (upper panel) for an Fe atom in α-FeSi2. The lower panels show the diffusion path, where the diffusion direction is marked by a blue arrow and the diffusing Fe atom is marked by a blue dashed circle.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 7  The calculated formation energy of neutral and charged defects in β-FeSi2 as a function of the Fermi energy of the system. The calculations were done under Fe-rich conditions. The crossing points of different charge states correspond to the thermodynamic defect transition levels (or activation energies). The results were obtained using a 768-atom supercell.	 

 	Fig. 8  The defect transition levels of the Fe-site impurities calculated using the 96-atom supercell. The donor levels are marked by brown color. The acceptor levels are marked by blue color. Three columns to the left and right of Fe in the periodic table are considered.
