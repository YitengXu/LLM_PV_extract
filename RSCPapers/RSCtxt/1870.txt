    , Accepted 20th October 2019First published on 21st October 2019AbstractFindings and reports in the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been phenomenal and embrace diverse perspectives such as technical issues, yielding, marketing, and environmental concerns. Bottlenecks in the structure, manufacturing, and operation of PSCs have been frequently addressed; the use of various means including crystallography and kinetics studies, simulation, material, solution, and surface/interface engineering, as well as their outcomes, have yielded certified efficiency of 23.7%. However, the short lifecycle, large waste-to-harvest ratio, functional failure during bending and in the dark mode, environmental and stability issues, and lack of power storage hinder their commercial viability. As a remedy, PSCs can be teamed up with one or multiple mechanical or thermal energy-harvesting or electrochemical power storage devices that can fully or partially overcome these nonidealities. Here, the means of integrating different devices with PSCs to form hybrid packs are discussed. The factors contributing toward the efficiency and mechanical robustness of PSCs and their hybrid devices upon integration are investigated. As an essential bridging component, carbon electrodes are also considered. Furthermore, due to the pressing standards in the energy sector, hybrid devices with nontoxic lead (Pb)-free perovskites should form ideal power packs. Therefore, with reference to their lattice model, optical characteristics, and resulting photovoltaic (PV) performance, they have also been briefly highlighted.Fatemeh ZabihiDr Fatemeh Zabihi is a senior researcher and faculty member at the State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Material Science and Engineering of Donghua University, Shanghai, China.

1. Introduction
Concerns over energy supply have become alarming for individuals, businesses, and governments; yet, discovering new energy resources and strategies to deploy them is a tedious task. Today's standards and policies demand clean, sustainable, cheap, and efficient energy sources and deployment protocols having low-carbon footprints. Other principal factors include multifunctionality; mobility; miniaturization; and ease of positioning, installing, manufacturing, and application. Solar energy is an endless and benign gift from nature, which can be efficiently harvested, managed, and used; therefore, it remains to be one of the best solutions. Recently, many approaches, materials, and devices have been studied and devised toward achieving this goal; among them, perovskites are the newest entry. Perovskites are promising materials for future energy security for many reasons. Perovskite semiconductors have direct and tunable optical bandgaps,1–3 broad light absorption in the visible range,4,5 bipolar nature, recombination rates of about 10−4 below the Langevin coefficient of organic materials,6,7 excellent carrier mobility (1–35 cm2 V s−1, depending on morphology and stoichiometry), high carrier diffusion length (100–1000 nm),8–11 unique chemical properties, and adaptive lattice structure.12,13 The generic chemical composition of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, i.e., AMX3, is the presence of a monovalent organic–inorganic cation (A: CH3NH3+ (MA), C2H5NH3+ (EA), HC(NH2)2+ (FA), or Cs+), a divalent metallic cation (M: Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, or Bi2+) from group IV, and a halogen anion (X: I−, Cl−, or Br−) from group VII, or alloys thereof.9,13–17 For any given stoichiometry, the crystal lattice exhibits a specific configuration: cubic, tetragonal, or octahedral, depending on the coordination number, combination, ratio, and size of the ionic moieties; these determine the optical and electrical traits.9,13–15,18–21
By virtue of their tailorable properties, the application of perovskites has overstepped other photovoltaic (PV) systems. There are hundreds of organic and organic–inorganic perovskite compositions, exhibiting different levels of magnetic,22,23 ferroelectric and piezoelectric,24–27 thermoelectric (TE),20,28 and photocatalytic actions.29 However, in recent times, perovskites have become popular as PV semiconductors. From their active short time of development, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed from 3.8% to ∼23.7%. It is important to note that the efficiency of PSCs is expected to theoretically approach the Shockley–Queisser limit of ∼33% and efficiency limit of 31% (without angular restriction) in a single-junction solar cell.14,15,22,30–32 Recent attempts to merge perovskites technology with flexible and bendable substrates,1–3,33–35 as well as different geometries such as fibers and textiles,36–40 have confirmed the versatility of perovskite semiconductor materials. Compatible geometries, ease of bending, stretching, and packing allow effortless movement, installation, and coupling with other devices.25,31,41–45 So far, the efficiency of PSCs assembled on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalate) (PEN) sheets has reached ∼18%.5,35,46,47 From a manufacturing viewpoint, PSCs can be developed through the roll-to-roll process, which is the most affordable process toward commercialization, yielding lower costs.15,33,34,48,49 Nonetheless, despite their advances in efficiency and diversity of materials and methods, serious challenges undermine this intriguing potential, since the fabrication of perovskite solar-energy-based systems remains on the lab scale. Another obstacle appears during their outdoor deployment. Under ambient conditions, PSCs can only work well for a few months regardless of their composition and configuration.22,50–54 Moisture, oxygen, intermittent temperature changes, intensive light emissions, and mechanical stresses deteriorate the chemical composition, deform the structure, and degrade the efficiency of the device.15,55–61 Protection with an ultrathin layer of hydrophobic material such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polymers improves both chemical and mechanical resistances of PSCs.42,62,63 The second level of challenges emanate from overheating under long-term illumination, leading to hotspots, local melts, and undesired chemical interactions and lattice deformation.15,60 The incorporation of a heat-sucking layer can maintain the perovskite at a milder temperature during an extended light-harvesting process.42,63,64 A study on the most recent status of perovskite technology has revealed that newer efforts have been channeled toward chemical and mechanical improvements, rather than overcoming efficiency challenges.3,13,14,65 In other words, further attempts to improve the performance before battling the instability issue are clearly futile.
From a functional point of view, the intensity and direction of illumination are vital points governing the performance of solar devices. Moreover, many setbacks in functions such as the instability of power output make PSCs an unforeseeable and contingent power source. These limitations have motivated researchers to rethink the capabilities of perovskite systems. One plausible approach could be integrating PSCs with an electrochemical energy storage system, e.g., a battery or a capacitor. A combination of PSCs with an energy storage system allows simultaneous/individual energy conversion and storage, which stabilizes the power output regardless of the day cycle. The stored energy can be readily delivered to an external load at any time.66,67 Further, harvesting mechanical and/or thermal energy from the perovskite through the photon-to-voltage process compensates for the interruption of darkness and stabilizes the output voltage.42,67,68 Interestingly, a combination in several cases can circumvent the need for encapsulation,64,66 which makes it attractive from both practical and economic viewpoints. Therefore, an account of how the above has been done is provided here. To the best of our knowledge, only two articles have attempted to review the integration techniques of PV systems with other energy storage, capture, and utilization systems. For example, Yun et al.'s31 recent review covered the integration potentials of dye-sensitized PSCs. However, being a capture–capture integrated system, the issue of storage and sustained performance at variable light intensities and phototronic potential values were not addressed. Another progress report from Liu et al.69 considers the diversity and technical foundation of integrated photocapacitors based on organic dye-sensitized perovskite PVs and supercapacitors. This work leaves a gap with regard to PSC–TE, PSC–piezoelectrically, and PSC–electrochemically connected power packs for analysis, which formed the basis of this progress report.
In brief, this review exclusively accentuates the PV function of PSCs in hybrid energy packs, which can execute multiple tasks and operation in darkness and intermittent light. First, we discuss the integration techniques and significance of carbon materials in this function. Then, this article individually reviews the related literature involving PSC–TE, PSC–electrochemical storage, and PSC–piezoelectric hybrid devices in terms of their integration and performance. Four critical technical challenges of PSCs in hybrid structures are emphasized in the article, i.e., limited absorption in the visible range, thermal failure, disability in the dark mode, and short lifetime. Moreover, the contribution of poisonous Pb toward perovskite energy devices should be reduced to the minimum possible level in order to allow routine and broader applications of perovskites in all the mentioned devices. As a part of this review, we also looked into the advantages and limitations of Pb-free perovskite devices. Finally, concluding remarks about the current challenges and future perspectives toward such hybrid packs are drawn.
2. Integration techniques
The geometry, size, nature, and functional task of each unit, application, and required efficiency determine the combination style and level of miniaturization of a hybrid device. On the other hand, the manner of linking determines the aesthetics, portability, rate of conformity, mount–demount, accessibility, and versatility. Thin-film solar cells, including PSCs, can be incorporated into different energy systems owing to their structural compliance. They are simple to print on arched and flexible platforms, and their two-dimensional structure broadens the active contact area shared with the coupled unit. In principle, there are two primary feasible ways PSCs can take part in hybridization, which are listed as follows:1 (1) separate design-to-direct assembly where two or more individual devices are mechanically attached with a wire connection or stacked on one another, as shown in Fig. 1a. The units can be concurrently/separately operated.2,41,69–71 (2) Uniform all-solid-state assembly in which two or more devices are built in situ in a layer-by-layer manner (Fig. 1b). Here, the different units are monolithically stacked, usually with a shared functional layer, typically an anode or a cathode.42,63,66,67,72,73 All-in-one solid-state packs—although complicated to fabricate—are fascinating; for example, a single device can be made to harvest, store, and later supply different forms of energy. Fig. 1c shows a summary of the possible ways to accommodate PSCs in a multifunctional energy pack.
 Fig. 1  Integration means of various devices for PSC-based hybrid devices. (a) Separate design to direct assembly. Here, two separately designed devices (for example, TE, electrochemical (EC), or piezoelectric (PE)) are connected to each other by the help of a wire connection or a bridging layer. The units can be concurrently or separately operated. (b) Uniform all-solid-state assembly. Here, the different units of the hybrid device are built in situ, usually in a layer-by-layer manner, until a full working device is obtained. The stacking, if made, should be monolithic, with the possibility of a shared functional layer, typically an anode or a cathode. (c) Illustration of a simplified PSCs-integrated device, including TE-, EC-, and PE-connected units. In all these hybrid devices, carbon materials play a vital role in connections and charge transfer. From dual units, complicated multi-in-one systems such as PSC–TE–EC and PSC–EC–PE devices can be developed (T1, T2, and T3 refer to different terminals/contacts for power output). 
Wire connection is a traditional design where a solar cell can be used to charge lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),31,71 capacitors,41,69 or any other form of an electrochemical cell.74 In the case of PSCs, a remote connection is always preferred if the storage or energy-consuming unit is in the liquid state. This arrangement guards the perovskite layer against hydration and decomposition by the electrolyte,64 but this constrains the applications of PSCs involving direct stacking on electrolysis cells for charging purposes (O2, H2, or CO2 evolution systems).75,76 Regardless of the application, an integrated remote system is unharmonious for flexible and wearable platforms and are disturbed by the current lost from the connecting cable.41,77–79 Direct junction and uniform stacking (with a shared electrode) favor flexibility, compactness, lightness, mobility, easy installation, and widen the range of applications.80 On the other hand, a direct junction is principally an odd choice for photocharging purposes since it results in a high series resistance, but manageable for photo-TE perovskite systems. Evidently, when a photoelectric and a TE unit are connected in series, the resultant voltages can either collectively power a workstation or be separately applied. Later on, we will discuss that this configuration can control the heat-induced frustration in PSCs and extend the thermal stability and lifecycle of PSCs.42,45,63 Four-terminal tandem solar cells have also employed this strategy,81–85 which is beyond the scope of this report.
In a uniform all-solid-state assembly, a functional layer is creatively and inconspicuously designed within two different working parts of separate devices. This shared layer can be a co-cathode or a co-anode, which injects photoexcited carriers from the PV into the other element, for example, a capacitor. The electrical field is created via a circuit between the top electrode of the capacitor (back contact) and the front contact of the PV (work electrode). A three-electrode combination is mostly applied in the construction of photo-(super)capacitors.64,66,69,72,73,86,87 In contrast, in the two-electrode uniform assembly, the positive electrode simultaneously serves as photogeneration and storage media.88,89 The latter mechanism is infeasible for the power packs with a perovskite-based harvesting layer. It is worth noting that such integration should preferably be arranged in such a way that it enables a series connection between the components. As debated in the literature,66,90 a parallel connection can fulfil a multifunctional purpose, but it results in voltage losses due to the self-consumption of the PV unit.66 However, a series connection offers the benefit of enhanced output voltage contributed by both the units.
In all-in-one systems, a perovskite or any other layer performs an additional function, which is beyond its optoelectronic role. In terms of design, a perovskite layer sandwiched between two electrodes—with or without electron transport layers and hole transport layers (ETLs/HTLs)—should be able to handle the kinetic voltage conversion along with enhanced broadband illumination. As elaborated in the subsequent sections (piezoelectric hybrid devices (PSCs)) in an all-in-one photostress-driven system, the synergy of the photon- and stress-induced hole polarization leads to enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE).25,72,91 Looking over the investigations hitherto, direct and uniform stackings are conventional for PV storage,64,66,69,72,73,86,87 PV–PV (tandem),81,82 and PV–TE hybrid devices.42,45,63 As a standard feature, a carbon layer is usually used as a counter electrode that is responsible for delivering the charge or thermal energy from the PV to the joint component, as mentioned earlier.42,63,64,66,67,86,91 The following section is devoted to the importance and contribution of carbon materials toward perovskite-integrated energy packs before diving into individual integrations.
2.1. Carbon electrodes (CEs)
Conduction and valence bands of perovskites induce a proper offset with a vast range of organic and inorganic materials, allowing optional architecture and material choices for n/p and electrode junctions. Semiconductive polymers are frequently used as the n/p and electrode junctions in PSCs owing to their abundance, lightweight nature, flexibility, and simplistic processes.2,34,48,72,92 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are typical semiconductive polymers for use in p junctions and electrodes in PSCs and polymer solar cells.2,5,93,94 From a functional standpoint, polymers are relatively weak with regard to charge transport; when used as the bottom junction, they can prolong crystallization and growth of the complete perovskite lattice on account of their smooth surface.95,96 Metals and metal oxides are the most common choices for fabricating electrode and buffer layers in PSCs and perovskite hybrid devices owing to their superior and long-lasting performance. Nevertheless, they are costly and need high temperature or vacuum processing.9,47,97 Furthermore, interfacial chemical conversion degrades metal and metal oxides.5
Summarizing all the abovementioned requirements, carbon allotropes principally impart credible electrical and stability behaviors and yield an effective junction, which can compete with metals and metal oxides.69,98,104,119–121Table 1 lists the energy states (conduction band/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in organics, valence band/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in organics, and bandgap energy)46,48,94,98,100,107,114,116,118 and refractive indexes99,105,114 of the materials (n/p type), commonly reported as the underlayers for perovskites in PSCs. Replacing carbon materials for back and front contact electrodes,98,104 buffers,122 antireflectors,123 and protective hydrophobic junctions has been debated.42,62–64,124,125 Carbon allotropes are conductive and possess a limited bandgap; therefore, they can perfectly perform buffering and charge collection functions.119,125–127 CEs have successfully been incorporated on both the HTL71,128,129 and ETL130,131 sides of PSCs because of carbon properties. A few excellent reviews on the use of CEs in PSCs are recommended here.75,132,133 Beyond this, HTL-free conductive PSCs have been constructed with the help of carbon black, graphite, and graphene, or a combination thereof, where a mesoporous carbon layer (doped or based on multijunctions with metal oxides) plays the two-fold role of a scaffold and charge-extraction element71,129,134,135 with extended stability.136,137 The optical properties of carbon materials can be altered by means of their geometry and surface topography. For instance, graphene has been previously used as an antireflective layer in PSCs owing to its planar (2D) structure,138–140 while CNTs cause multireflections on the surface curvatures and hence increase scattering.140–142 Fluorescent carbon dots with zero-dimensional geometry also exhibit tunable optoelectronic properties and emissions, which have been applied in bioimaging and photocatalysis.143,144 Further, with a thick and highly compact stacking, at the level of graphite, or doping with metal nanoparticles, high absorption can be achieved in the visible range.145,146 Thermal conductivity in some of the carbon allotropes surpass those of metals and metal alloys;42,63,147 therefore, they are mostly preferred for use as the intermediate layer in PSC–TE packs,41,69–71 as discussed in the subsequent sections. Furthermore, the excellent negative surface zeta index of carbon repels the OH− ions of water, yielding a hydrophobic characteristic;91,148 this ensures the chemical stability of the perovskite when exposed to oxygen and water.42,63 Carbon in the form of thin films, fibers, and textiles are mechanically robust and capable of enduring several thousands of bending cycles.104Table 2 lists the state-of-the-art multitask perovskite energy devices where carbon solely serves as a bridging element or performs multiple functions. The structure and role of the corresponding devices are explained in the subsequent sections.

3. PSC–TE hybrid devices
The reason why TEs are popular is that these devices are clean, noiseless, and endurable solid-state gadgets, which can efficiently convert thermal energy into electrical current via the Seebeck effect. The heat flow between the two (hot and cold) surfaces with a prominent temperature difference induces thermal power. The distance between the hot and cold plates is decorated with separate n- and p-type TE elements, accordingly resulting in a considerable temperature gradient and heat flow. The electrical charges are carried within the heat flow, creating a charge density profile and therefore electrical potential with the TE elements. This difference in electrical potential builds up a voltage between the hot and cold plates and induces an electrical current.42,45,63,150,151 TE (n/p) plates are made of typical semiconductors, such as bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), lead telluride (PbTe), and silicon germanium (SiGe), or they are composed of thermally insulating polymers doped with highly conductive nanoparticles.16,63,150,151 For the standard metric of TE performance, the so-called figure of merit (ZT) is defined according to eqn (1): (1)where ρ (Ω cm) is the electrical resistivity, S (μV K−1) denotes the Seebeck coefficient, T (K) is the operating temperature, and κe (W m−1 K−1) and κL (W m−1 K−1) denote the share of electronic and ionic thermal conductivities, respectively.44,152 The operating temperature can be expressed as , which indicates the average temperature of the hot and cold ends across the TE plate. Further, Th and Tc indicate the time-dependent operating temperatures of the hot and cold plates, respectively. The ZT value is a generic quantity that yields the potential of heat to electricity conversion in a thermoelectric material and consequently the efficiency and cost of the corresponding devices.153,154 In principal, a large ZT value indicates a significantly high Seebeck coefficient (high thermal conductivity), a parameter that directly depends on the carrier density, carrier mobility, Fermi level, and temperature. In view of this fact, n-type semiconductive materials are the most desirable thermoelectrics.20,44,63 The importance of the combination of PSCs and TEs relies on several factors, as described in the preceding paragraphs. The performance of any PV–TE hybrid device relies on two factors, namely, the efficiency of light absorption and thermoelectric energy conversion. Generally, materials with a significant optical sunlight absorption coefficient and large ZT value are preferred in such hybrid devices. This is because they can efficiently collect sunlight and transform it into heat and later into electricity. For applicability, the ZT value of any standalone TE should be at least 2 (preferably 3)155,156 and larger than 1 (ref. 157) for applications in PV–TE devices.
The incident broadband solar spectrum lies between 280 and 4000 nm. Therefore, determining a way to use the entire spectrum and translate the received energy into useable electrical energy is paramount if high-efficiency devices need to be realized. Unfortunately, solar cells are not capable of fully converting the energy of the received photons into electrical energy if this energy is smaller or larger than the bandgap energy of the semiconductor-harvesting material. This partly explains why PSCs have a theoretical Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit of ∼33%.14,15,22,30–32 Therefore, all the other incident photons below the bandgap of the material are most probably wasted in the form of thermal energy through the cell. In PSCs, this excess thermal energy can later result in cell degradation. In this sense, therefore, finding a way to convert this heat into electricity can be considered as a fascinating approach. Fig. 2a shows the typical pathway by which the solar spectrum is used in PSC–TE hybrid devices. The photons below the bandgap energy are dissipated as waste heat, which are utilized in the TE attachment when they strike through the cell.158 In detail, this waste thermal energy is caught by the intermediate electrode, which is typically an excellent thermal-conductive layer consisting of materials such as carbon black or graphite and immediately transferred to the top (hot) plate of the TE component, building a large thermal gradient and therefore a profile of carrier density across the TE layer. This electrical potential can escape onto an external circuit and generate a thermoelectric voltage.63 Therefore, a PV–TE device possesses benefits such as enhanced output voltage and current, controlled thermal conditions in the perovskite layer, and efficient use of full-range photons across a wide band of solar spectrum.42,45,63 Such an efficient system is capable of improving the overall efficiency of the hybrid system, as shown in Fig. 2b. Not only is the efficiency increased, but the lifespan of the PSC is also considerably improved. This is due to the lesser amount of reflected heat going back to the PSC, which otherwise would accelerate the degradation of the active layer.159,160

In a typical model of PSC–TE devices (Fig. 2c), the TE generator is placed on the rear contact of the PSC, which allows the collection and conversion of waste photon energy and protection of the PV device from thermal degradation.42,63,150,151 It is possible to incorporate crystalline Si, dye-synthesized, polymer, and perovskite cells onto commercially available TE generators without building all-solid-state PSC–TE devices.63 Overall, in all these systems, an essential intermediate layer (counter electrode) is required, which performs the dual function of the back contact part. An efficient counter electrode should be an excellent heat conductor and electrical buffer to avoid carrier losses from the PV moiety. Beyond that, it should be able to readily catch the IR wavelength, dissipated from the harvesting layer of the PSCs. The valence and conduction bands of perovskites adequately match with those of the CEs, such as graphene, graphite, carbon black, CNTs, and combinations thereof. Moreover, the low price, viability, high infrared absorption, hydrophobicity, nature abundance, and diversity of processes for carbon allotropes make them an appealing candidate for use in antireflectors, buffers, and protection coatings in emerging sustainable electrical devices.42,63,64,140
Perovskites can potentially contribute toward the TE technology in two different ways: (1) PSCs can be built/connected/sandwiched in tandem with a TE generator, where the input thermal energy of a TE generator is supplied from the excess light-induced heat passed over the top component, i.e., the PSCs.42,45,63 (2) Special TE-like perovskites are built and employed as both TE and PV active layers in a single unit structure.44 The first approach has been frequently tested by certain research groups, as described later. However, the second strategy is yet to be realized and fairly beyond the scope of this review. However, we found an exciting and worthwhile work by He and Galli44 with regard to such PV–TE-based perovskites for the possible use of perovskites as TE materials. Using first-principles studies, they approximated the evolution of the overall thermal conductance, Seebeck factor, and ZT versus the carrier density for both lead and tin ammonium iodide, CH3NH3MI3 (M = Pb/Sn). It was discovered that the best TE performance (ZT = 1–2 depending on the ionic conductivity) theoretically occurs when the carrier density is ∼1018 cm−3 orders of magnitude and the density of lattice defections is maintained low. Experimental works on PV/TE-based perovskites are yet to be reported. We believe that the idea might be actually constrained by the high recombination rates in perovskite films, mainly occurring at the grain boundaries, as well as the inherent large density of defects in a crystalline lattice.15
In PSC–TE hybrid devices, different research groups aimed to obtain high-efficiency PV output and TE performances. Different perovskite materials with outstanding Seebeck coefficients; thermal, optical, and electronic properties; state density; and carrier mobility have been addressed. These properties were evaluated and improved via the alteration of chemical compositions and surface engineering, as well as tuning the lattice parameters.20,152,161 Liu et al.42 combined carbon black and 40 nm graphene sheets and employed it as a bridge electrode, which was connected in series to a mesoscopic hole-selective PSC (based on CH3NH3PbI3) to a commercial TE generator (Fig. 3a). The PSC segment individually produced PCE of 9.8% under the ambient condition and PCE of 12.6% in combination with TE. By incorporating a heat sink at the cold side of the TE generator, the overall efficiency was enhanced to 22.2%, which yielded outstandingly improved Voc (1.87 V) and Jsc (22.2 mW cm−2). The light absorption analysis was conducted in the absence and presence of a CE: it was revealed that the CE could increase the wavelength tail from 800 to 1400 nm owing to the strong photon-absorptive nature of the CE, which could trap the IR spectrum, pass it over, and dissipate it from the perovskite. Further, it was indicated that in corresponding regular PSCs with a metal rear electrode (Au, Ag, or Al), the photon energy was reflected and accumulated in the active layer, which deteriorated the PV performance under constant illumination. However, with hybridization, the photon energy absorbed by CE was converted into heat and produced an additional voltage between the two plates, but it also created a larger electrical current. To illustrate the mechanism of thermal damage, they developed a theory ascribing the temperature-induced fatigue of the perovskite layer to several metastable trap sites, in the form of lattice defections, caused by the radiant heat. They suggested that cooling could reduce a significant part of these defections, heal the quasi-Fermi level, and reduce the recombination rate under illumination.42

Xu et al.28 reported an efficient PSC–TE hybrid device with the maximum point power (MPP) output of 20.3% and open-circuit voltage of 1.29 V under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. They adopted a mesoscopic HTL-free (n–i) PSC based on TiO2/ZrO2/carbon multilayer and mixed cation lead halide perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 (bandgap ≈ 1.55 eV), which was connected to a commercial bismuth–tellurium (Bi2Te3) TE generator (Fig. 3b). With this configuration, the hybrid device could utilize the entire solar spectrum of AM1.5 G, where the perovskite absorbs the visible wavelength and the carbon bridge underneath collects the additional infrared light passing through the cell. They explained that the voltage in a single PSC is produced from charge splitting along with the quasi-Fermi level, inversely correlated with the dark current density (J0) and local thermal energy (q): Voc ∼ 1/(q × J0). Under steady illumination, both J0 and q increase due to the accumulation of heat and intrinsic charges. In this case, both Voc and Jsc show downward trends as the temperature increases; the PCE value drops from 13.4% to 11.2% when the operating temperature changes from 25 to 45 °C. After forming a series connection with a TE generator, the overall Voc value surprisingly increased with an increase in temperature owing to the heat sucking and additional heat-induced voltage by the TE generator. Unlike a single PV system, the voltage of a TE generator became stronger with an increase in temperature, reaching 1.18 V at 45 °C, which corresponds to Jsc of 22.39 mA cm−2 and PCE of 17.97%. With multiple TE generators (optimum value of 9 TE generators), the overall voltage could be enhanced to 1.29 V.
In the case of perovskites as an individual thermoelectric, the organic–inorganic perovskite family has become a compelling candidate for use in PV–TE devices. Several research groups have attempted to augment its thermovoltaic potential via the alteration of chemical composition and crystalline structure. However, a fundamental, systematic, and theoretical investigation of the thermoelectric characteristics of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites is missing. Behera et al.161 observed variations in the thermoelectric properties of La1−xNaxCoO3 perovskite oxide, where they doped it with Na+ ions. The modified thermoelectric perovskite oxide (doped with Na+, x = 0.15) revealed substantially reduced electrical resistivity (Ω cm) and enhanced power function (μW m−1 K−1), while it exerted a marginal influence on thermal conductivity (W m−1 K−1) in the operating temperature range of 300–800 K.
4. PSC–electrochemical storage hybrid devices
A solar cell generates power only under appropriately steady illumination. This limitation makes solar cells an only-daytime device. A semiconductor such as a perovskite intrinsically possesses a negligible charge density and drift mobility in dark media.162 Under continuous light emission, electron–hole pairs are excited, disintegrated, and oppositely flow to the conduction and valence bands, forming a quasi-Fermi level. Then, a hole-/electron-selective layer receives the charge carriers and conducts them to the corresponding electrodes. This photon-to-current conversion trend solely occurs under illumination, and the output power predominantly depends on the magnitude of the input light.41,64,67,70,80 In other words, the solar panels in their original form are unable to save energy, so they are limited on cloudy days or useless in the dark.73,163 On the other hand, electrochemical energy storage packs, particularly batteries and supercapacitors, are only capable of storing but not harvesting energy, and their power density and capacitance depend on many factors such as the nature of the precursor materials. Fig. 4a shows a comparison of the Ragone plots of different electrochemical devices in terms of their power and energy densities. A wide range of materials, such as the carbon family, redox-active polymers, electroactive 2D materials, transition metal oxides/hydroxides/chalcogenides, metal–organic frameworks, and different derivatives of these materials, have been applied as electrodes in almost all energy storage devices.164–168 Among them, supercapacitors have gained considerable interest in various research communities owing to their fast charge storage and cycle life. Generally, electrodes for supercapacitors differ from those of batteries in terms of electrochemical behaviors and performance.169 The mechanism of energy storage in these electrochemical devices occurs in two ways: via a non-faradaic process or indirectly via a faradaic process.170,171 Supercapacitors have high power density, but relatively lower energy density; on the other hand, batteries have improved energy density, but less power density.169,172 High-surface-area carbonaceous materials in double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) demonstrate high power density but less energy density in comparison to those of redox-active polymeric materials and certain transition metal hydro(oxides), which demonstrate high energy density but limited power density.173–179 The high power in carbonaceous EDLCs can be attributed to their mechanism of charge storage, which relies on the physical adsorption of reversible electrolyte ions onto the large surface of carbon-based electrodes.180–184 However, redox-active materials are dominated by reversible redox reactions at the electrode surfaces and near the surface.185,186 For batteries, the electrochemical energy storage ability can be attributed to the reversible faradaic reactions occurring in the bulk phase of active materials with charge carriers (Fig. 4b).

Since PSCs can efficiently harvest energy but cannot store it, electrochemical energy devices can be employed to store the harvested energy and later use it as required. This is the primary reason for designing PSC–electrochemical storage hybrid devices. Table 3 summarizes such devices that have been reported in the literature, detailing their architecture, perovskite composition, connection manner, and performance. Integrating PSCs with an electrochemical power storage cell allows instant capture and accumulation of photon-harvested energy (photocharging). Then, through an external circuit, the stored energy can be delivered to an external load (galvanostatic discharging), regardless of the weather conditions.41,73,140,187 From the engineering and design considerations, the storage segment can supply power in the dark and reinstate the output voltage under fluctuating illumination.41 Electrochemical rechargeable systems (Fig. 4c and d), such as batteries, supercapacitors, and/or battery–supercapacitor hybrid systems, can handle this function when they are coupled with solar cells.31,41,71,73,86,125,163,187 All these electrochemical charge storage systems are two-electrode (cathode/anode) devices enclosing an electrolyte that shuttles ions between the electrodes.184 An ion-selective membrane is placed between the electrodes to prevent short circuits and to buffer the electrons. When a specific amount of voltage is sourced from external power, the Li+ ions (in the case of LIBs) are reduced from the cathode and flow across the electrolyte toward the anode surface. Along with this process, the electrical voltage is stored in the form of chemical potential. Inversely, a circuit to an outer load can convey the electrons from the anode and push the Li ions back to the cathode surface.188–190 Simultaneously, a supercapacitor is composed of two electrodes and a separator (dielectric) layer, which is ion-permeable and a charge insulator. With an applied voltage, electrical potential is created and stored on the surface of the electrodes.66,67,191 The dielectric layer in supercapacitors can be a liquid electrolyte or an ion-conducting solid. Recently, symmetric supercapacitors have been extensively devised that comprise two carbon layers, with an air, insulator, solid, or hydrogel layer in the middle.64,66,67,73 The PV and chargeable units are connected via a common electrode, which affords the duplicate function of the counter side for the PSC as well as the electrode for the supercapacitor. Under illumination, the electron–hole pairs in the active layer (here, perovskite) are disintegrated and conducted to the opposite pathways. Using a circuit from the top electrode of the capacitor to the front electrode of the PSC, an electrical field is created, and the resultant electrical energy is gradually accumulated in the capacitor. This photocharging process is extended until the voltage across the capacitor reaches the maximum output voltage of the PSC. The stored electrical charges can be released to an external power load via a direct circuit (galvanostatic discharge).41,66,70,72,73

In a standard photon harvesting–energy storage module, the voltage required to charge the storage part is supplied by the output voltage of the PV part. In this regard, the output voltage of the silicon solar cells (<0.7 V) and dye-sensitized solar cells (<0.8 V) might be insufficient to create sufficient potential over a power storage system.31,71,192 PSCs, in their most developed alignment and composition, produce an output voltage of up to ∼1.25 V,15,193,194 making them a compatible harvesting element for batteries and capacitors.73 The output voltage of PSCs can easily charge supercapacitors; to charge a LIB, however, several solar cells should work in series.71,86 Supercapacitors in hybrid devices are commonly made of CEs, which can serve as the back or front contact in PSCs.62,72,98 Accordingly, a PSC and supercapacitor can be monolithically connected via a shared thin layer of carbon (CNTs, graphene, etc.) or carbon composites. On account of the hydrophobic nature and robustness of the carbon derivative, such an alignment guarantees mechanical and chemical endurance of the entire device.64,66,67,69,70,72,91 Furthermore, supercapacitors possess excellent power density and adequate cycling stability (see the Ragone plot in Fig. 4a).64,66,69,70,72,73 Despite this potential, the energy losses during the delivery-storage process reduce the overall efficiency of the integrated devices far below that of an individual solar cell.31,41,64,67,70,72,80
Beyond the magnitude of the operating voltage, the phase state, thickness, and type of dielectric materials predominately dictate the power storage efficiency and ease of integration. Liquid or gel-like dielectrics have exceptional capacitance and thermal conformity, but they are unsuitable for working along with PSCs in both technical and aesthetic aspects. In direct-stacking integration, aqueous electrolytes suffer from the risk of leakage, thereby permeating and frustrating the perovskite layer.69 On the other hand, a simple wire connection is practically efficient, but it is susceptible to failure and not fit for portable and miniaturized electronics.69,73 With all these pros and cons, the solid-state direct-stacked supercapacitors with limited capacitance41,66,70,72,73 are chemically safe for PSCs and aesthetically compatible for portable and wearable devices.41,70,72 For the concerns mentioned above and to stay within the scope of this article, the solid-phase perovskite photocapacitors have been reviewed and explained from a functional and technical point of view. Then, for presenting an apparent reference and a simple comparison, LIBs and storage model-perovskite hybrid devices are briefly discussed.
4.1 Supercapacitor–perovskite hybrid devices
The theoretical principles of photon conversion and storage in a typical photocapacitor can be better understood from eqn (2)–(5):31,41,67,198 Est = 0.5CV2(2) (3) (4) Ein = Pint(5)where Est denotes the stored energy in a capacitor and Estm denotes the maximum energy that a supercapacitor can store. S indicates the active area of the solar cell and t is the time of photocharging. Pin is the total power input obtained from the incident photons, and ξc and ξoverall represent the efficiency of storage in the supercapacitor and overall efficiency, respectively.
One of the first combinations of PSCs with a solid-state supercapacitor was reported by Xu et al.,41 where a mesoporous, n–i–p, CH3NH3PbI3 PSC was wire-bridged with a bacterial cellulose membrane/polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers/MWCNTs supercapacitor (Fig. 5a). The package enabled fantastic energy storage efficiency of 10% and an output voltage of 1.45 V, with low interruptions during day cycles. The mismatch between the active area of the supercapacitor and the solar cell limited the full-charging period to ∼30 s. The short survival time due to the presence of the bacterial membrane and weak compactness because of the wire connection challenge the versatility of such devices. Using the same integration approach, Du et al.70 developed a symmetric supercapacitor with H2SO4–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solid-state dielectric between two flexible graphene electrodes vacuum-filtrated on silver-coated polyimide. The supercapacitor was then connected to a p–i–n PSC (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al) via two copper wires. Under AM1.5 illumination, the PV unit could produce Voc ∼0.90 V to load the supercapacitor. The charge load was maintained for 45 s by the supercapacitor and discharged from 0.75 V (which is smaller than the Voc value of 0.90 V) at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 5b). Based on a similar approach, Zhou and co-authors developed a semitransparent perovskite photovoltachromic supercapacitors (PVSC) power pack.73 They skillfully integrated a semitransparent PSC together with an electrochromic WO3 supercapacitor into a photovoltachromic supercapacitor in a vertically stacked configuration (Fig. 5c). Their architecture allowed light exposure from both the back and front electrodes. Beyond the energy-harvesting and storage functions, this combined device could control optical transmittance and light-induced heating, and the device benefits from the advanced level of integration, i.e., the tandem model. The transparent MoO3/Au/MoO3 (MAM) multilayer offered average transmission of 70.6% along with a visible range of 380–780 nm. When compared with typical PSCs, in which light enters from the working electrode, the back illumination from MAM enhances transmission up to ∼40% at longer wavelengths (650 nm). In the combined pack, MAM operates as the co-anode between the PV and electrochemical parts. WO3 manages to perform a two-fold service; first as the top electrode of the electrochemical part that accumulates carriers in the charging mode. Second, as a color filter that systematically controls the working state of the PSCs. In detail, when WO3 is saturated by carriers, its color changes to dark blue, blocking the light-harvesting characteristic of PSCs. Contrarily, when the capacitor is discharged by an external circuit, WO3 gets bleached and becomes light-permissive again, switching on the PSC. WO3 absorbs the light and reflects heat radiation during the charging process. Such a selective harvesting process protects the PSC during extended light exposures and prevents premature degradation. Both energy storage and color-filtering functions are associated with electrochemical reactions at the H2SO4–PVA/WO3 interface, according to the following scenario: during the charging step, H+ ions are pulled in by the strong electrical field at the WO3 electrode (R1). This process is reversible (R2), as H+ is released from the electrode during discharging, while the color of the electrode becomes transparent again. Color changes along with the charge–discharge steps also qualitatively indicate the charge contained in the capacitor and the work state of the PSC. WO3⋯e− → (WO3)− + H+ → HWO3 (dark blue)(R1) HWO3 → WO3 + H+ + e− (transparent)(R2)

The tunable color state of the fully integrated pack serves as an indicator of the amount of energy stored in the cell. This mechanism enables the estimation of stored energy in the power pack only by differentiating the colored states, and the devices' photo charge–discharge processes can be easily measured. To realize the stability in the ambient environment, the integrated system was continuously exposed to a full-spectrum illumination for 5 h, which degraded 70% of the initial performance. We can attribute this relatively prolonged lifetime and excellent performance to a number of reasons. First, when compared with conventional photovoltachromic cells, the CEs of their semitransparent PVSC power packs could sufficiently balance the accumulated charge, eliminate any necessity of reverse bias voltage for bleaching the device, and realize reasonable in situ energy storage. The controllable color changes of their device not only showed the amount of energy stored and energy consumed in real time, but it was significant in enhancing the photostability of the PV component by preventing its long-time photoexposure even under the fully charged device state.
Liu et al.66 developed new architecture of the supercapacitor using a composite electrode made of MnO2, mesoporous carbon film, and solid-phase PVA–LiCl electrolyte. Both these electrodes were coated with dielectric materials. The device was assembled on a flexible graphene sheet from one side and shared the mesoporous CE with n–i–p PSC (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/mTiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon film) from the other side. The shared carbon film served as the back contact for the PSC (Fig. 5d). Both series and parallel combinations were prepared and examined. The serial connection showed superior performance because of the wider contact area between the two components, allowing immediate charge evacuation from the PSC to the capacitor. The unique configuration differentiated this layout from the previously reported analogues; first, the LiCl/PVA dielectric layer ensures accelerated ion transfer. Second, the poor electrical performance of MnO2 is compensated by the carbon co-electrode. More importantly, the incorporation of a carbon film as the counter electrode confines light reflection, protecting the perovskite layer from light-induced overheating and degradation.42
The advanced configuration and level of combination were reported by Zhang et al.72 In their hybrid pack, multiple units of PSC–storage devices were integrated into tandems for increased energy harvesting and storage. In their work, bipolar TiO2 nanotubes were electrochemically grown on a Ti foil and applied as the shared electrode, i.e., the negative electrode of the supercapacitor and electron collector for the PSC. The PV part was composed of a uniform photoactive perovskite layer, spiro-OMeTAD HTL, and transparent photocathode, made of an electrospun PVA network, with an ultrathin Au layer on the top. For the capacitor section, Co9S8 nanorods were vertically grown on the carbon cloth and covered with MnO2. This needle-type hybrid electrode favors charge delivery between the carbon cloth and bipolar titanium oxide. The unique architecture, based on the needle-form electrode, carbon cloth substrate, and ultrathin Au/PVA transparent back contact are fit for wearable and deformable devices. From this analysis, excellent PV properties of the device can partly arise from the residual PbI2, filling out the spaces at the grain boundaries and interfaces. The PVA network and Au thin film were deposited by electrospinning and magnetron sputtering, respectively, to avoid exposure to higher temperatures. Five photocapacitor strips woven in the form of a bamboo slip yielded over 2.4 V, which was sufficient to power a LED light and electric fan and achieved an overall PCE of 4.9% with storage efficiency of up to 80%.
Liu et al.64 demonstrated a hybrid PV–storage device based on CH3NH3PbI3 PSC and conducting polymer polyaniline/CNT electrodes with the CNT working as the connecting bridge in an all-solid-state stacked pack (Fig. 5e). Due to the pseudocapacitance of PANI performance coupled with reliable CNT conductivity brought about by the PANI/CNT electrode, their integrated power pack showed large specific capacitance of 422 mF cm−2 (2.0 mA cm−2), excellent coulombic efficiency (96%), combined energy storage efficiency (70.9%), and overall efficiency of 0.77% with reliable power output under complex illumination conditions (including fluctuating sunlight). The ultrathin CNT film as a bridge directly connects the capacitor to the PSC, providing dual functions of a back contact for the PSC and positive electrode for the capacitor.87 A similar setup was also proposed by Kim et al.,200 where a compact and monolithically stacked hybrid device (asymmetric supercapacitor) was connected to a PSC with the help of silver epoxy. The asymmetric supercapacitor was based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrodes and PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte. However, the PSC employed MAPbI3 in the ITO/PSS/PTAA/perovskite/PC61BM/PEI/Ag cell structure. This device was capable of delivering storage efficiency and overall efficiency of 64.59% and 5.07%, respectively. Other similar photocapacitor devices201 in the literature are detailed in Table 3.
Xu et al.149 recently introduced a fully mesoporous perovskite super-photocapacitor, adopting a PEDOT–carbon complex as the junction electrode (Fig. 5f). In the PV side, TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles and mesoporous carbon layers were printed one-by-one on FTO-coated glass, n-type perchlorate (ClO4−)–PEDOT was electrodeposited on the carbon layer, and perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) was infiltrated in the porous stacks by dipping in the precursor solution. On the symmetrical capacitor side, the electrolyte (LiClO4− and MAI in isopropanol) was placed between two ClO4−–PEDOT mesoporous layers. In this stacked integration, the voltage–time trend under AM1.5 simulated sunlight, galvanostatic discharge behavior in the dark mode (blue shadow), variation in areal capacitance storage with current density, overall efficiency of the device versus the photocharging time, and photocharge/galvanostatic discharge cycling stability of mesoporous perovskite photo-supercapacitor were studied.92 PEDOT exhibits an additional role of an electrochromic element, yielding light blue in the oxidized form and turning dark blue in the reduced form. This system recorded high energy storage of 73.77% and overall efficiency of up to 4.70%.
Wearable and self-powered smart textiles are reckoned to be the future of clothing.78 However, integrating both energy harvesting and storage for such self-powered miniature devices offer significant challenges. Nevertheless, Li et al.199 designed a ribbon-like wearable PSC–storage hybrid device capable of simultaneously harvesting and storing energy (Fig. 5g). A fully stacked ribbon device integrating a PSC (capable of generating photoelectrons) and a supercapacitor on the reverse side (for storage of electrons) could be woven into the cloth with the help of cotton yarns. Under illumination, the best PCE performance reached 10.41%, and the supercapacitor could hold an energy density of up to 1.15 mW h cm−3 and power density of 243 mW cm−3.
4.2 Battery- and hybrid storage-perovskite hybrid devices
As mentioned earlier, the PSC–LIB packs are not basically counted as a paragon alternative for PV harvesting–electrochemical storage hybridization because of (i) voltage mismatch and (ii) risk of interdiffusion (ions from an electrolyte to perovskite) and degradation of the perovskite layer. The former issue demands multiple (series-connected) PV components, and the latter one might be tackled by the adoption of a remote (wire) design. Even so, both the abovementioned forms make the entire device undesirable in terms of compactness and portability, as well as making it incompatible for use in wearable and portable smart textiles applications.

Fig. 6 shows the integration strategies and mechanism of working in different reported PSC–battery devices. Fig. 6a shows a schematic diagram of the fabricated PSC–LIB device system designed by Xu and co-workers.71 They employed four perovskite PV units (based on CH3NH3PbI3), which were serially wire-linked with a LIB, having LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 as the active materials for the cathode and anode, respectively. The device could afford overall photoelectric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80%, with reliable charge–discharge cycling stability under continuous illumination of AM1.5 G. This hybrid device was phenomenal because many such PV–hybrid devices earlier have been based on polymer solar cells, which intrinsically offer low PCE and poor stability. Therefore, the use of perovskites resolved these drawbacks, where improved photocharging, carrier density, and carrier mobility, as well as a prolonged active life time, could be achieved when compared with those of polymer solar cells. Li et al.202 also adopted a wire-linked structure and designed a multifunctional PSC–rechargeable lithium-ion capacitor to power wearable strain sensors (Fig. 6b). Four flexible planar PSCs were serially connected to run the PV function. Every individual PSC was composed of a mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite (FAxMA1−xPbI3−xClx) film packed between PC61BM and NiOx as the carrier-selective layers, PET/ITO, and Ag as the conductive electrodes. In the chargeable component, Li4Ti5O12/rGO and carbon-active materials were employed as the anode and cathode, respectively. Their reported PSC–rechargeable lithium-ion capacitor device was capable of delivering overall efficiency of 8.41% and output voltage of 3 V at a discharge current density of 0.1 A g−1.

Unlike the abovementioned reports, Ahmad et al.203 took up the challenge to develop a directly stacked photobattery, where the PSC was directly combined with the LIB (Fig. 6c). A polycrystalline 2D perovskite ((C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4) was blended with rGO as the conductive additives and mixed together with the help of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, for mechanical stability), yielding vertically aligned nanoplatelets, as shown in the SEM image, Fig. 6c. To fabricate a hybrid device, the obtained 2D perovskite–rGO–PVDF film was sandwiched between a separator and transparent collector (FTO electrode). For reliable electrons collection from the perovskite to the corresponding electrode (Cu foil), either rGO or PCBM could be used as the electron transport material. The 2D perovskite cells demonstrated high capacity of ∼410 mA h g−1, which is higher than that of graphite anodes (∼370 mA h g−1) during the first cycle. However, this performance significantly dropped to almost one-fifth the initial value only within a few cycles. This indicates that perovskite-powered batteries have stability issues, which need to be urgently addressed despite their high performance. Moreover, perovskites have started to gain attention for applications in electrochemical energy storage with improved stability.204–209 Ahmad et al.203 tried to analyze the variations in structure and composition of their 2D perovskite–rGO–PVDF film during photocharge and galvanostatic discharge cycles. Using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, an increase in the d-spacing was detected in the perovskite lattice, when discharging was carried out at low voltages (≤1.85 V). This crystal deformation reflects the possible diffusion and insertion of Li ions between the Pb–I interlayers, which could lead to further lattice transformation at 1.4 V, and spacing toward 3D perovskite, along with the Pb traces, at 0.3 V (R3). 2Li + (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4 → 2(C6H9C2H4NH3I) + 2LiI + Pb(R3)
During low voltage discharge (0.3 V), the accumulation of photogenerated holes on the counter electrode repels Li+ out of the perovskite, which also reacts with Li–I, resulting in an additional charge (R4): 2LiI + 2h+ → 2Li+ + I2(R4)
These morphology and composition changes, if repeated, may cause irreversible lattice distortion and formation of a photo-inactive Pb–Li layer, ultimately losing capacity and storage function of the battery in the hybrid pack.
5. PSC–piezoelectric hybrid devices
Crystalline solids with domain boundaries (heterophases) and non-inverse symmetry (BaNiO3-like hexagonal) generate an electrical field when subjected to mechanical stresses,26,211–213via the so-called piezoelectric effect. Crystal deformation (strain) along with a mechanical force results in charge displacement and polarization along the plane normal to the applied strain. Upon polarization, the free charges can escape into an external circuit and power an external load.26,211,212,214 The piezoelectric effect is a reversible phenomenon. This implies that electromechanical materials can also induce mechanical strain as a result of an applied electrical field.215,216Fig. 7a shows an example of the underlying mechanism of voltage generation due to normal stress in a piezoelectric crystalline solid film. The kinetic-induced voltage correlates with the imposed stress and strain via eqn (6):212,214 (6)where Vz denotes the kinetic-produced voltage, dzz is the piezoelectric charge/strain coefficient, εzz indicates the strain, t denotes the thickness of the solid mass, and A is the surface area (normal to the direction of stress), which is effectively subjected to normal stress.

The piezoelectric effect forms the basis for the functioning of several devices, e.g., sensors, transducers, medical imaging instruments, ultrasonic devices, vibration dampers, and actuators.24,25,217–220 The hexagonal unit cell, heterophase nature, and domain boundaries of lead halides and Pb-free inorganic and organic–inorganic perovskite molecules make them electromechanically active, yielding composition-dependent efficiency.211,214,218,221 They are also printable on both flexible and rigid substrates34,94,222,223 and can be shaped into various geometries such as ultrathin layers224,225 and fibers.38,39,226–230 You et al. reported an organic–inorganic toxic-free perovskite called trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II) [Me3NCH2ClMnCl3, (TMCMMnCl3)] with a substantial molecular piezoelectric trait (d33 = 185 pC N−1) and a high phase transition temperature (406 K) as compared to those of BaTiO3.26 The crystal adopts a BaNiO3 configuration, which is an intrinsic ferroelectric. Unlike the organic–inorganic perovskite, Me3NCH2ClMnCl3 can be processed at room temperature and printed on a flexible background. They discovered a profound temperature-dependent phase transition, as shown in Fig. 7b.26 Freezing Cl atoms in Me3NCH2ClMnCl3 at lower temperatures disturbs the central symmetry and causes spontaneous polarization, which is the origin of its intrinsic piezoelectricity.26,213 A phase change over 406 K releases these Cl atoms and reverts the central symmetry due to the interaction of atomic vibrations. The extrinsic piezoelectric effect originates from the interaction between the ordered–disordered crystalline domains and grain boundaries. To increase distortion, the same group formulated a solid molecular solution with a strong piezoelectric coefficient as compared to that of zirconate titanate.211,231 They synthesized a single-crystal (TMFM)x(TMCM)1−xCdCl3 solid solution (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) via vapor deposition at room temperature. Solid molecular solutions are composed of multiple atomic groups as their electrical balance is highly sensitive to the ratio between the mixing groups and consequently the crystalline phase state. Mixing at the molecular scale invariably results in noticeable distortions.211,232 In the case of (TMFM)x(TMCM)1−xCdCl3, the TMF/TMC cation segments (depending on x) discretize the CdCl6 octahedra. The cell asymmetry is determined from the difference between the binding lengths of C–F in TMF and C–Cl in TMC, which varies with x. Fig. 7c shows the symmetry model and differential scanning calorimetry diagram of (TMFM)x(TMCM)1−xCdCl3 (temperature range: 0–140 °C) for the TMFM fraction (x) from 0 to 1.211 They characterized the piezoelectric trait of (TMFM)x(TMCM)1−xCdCl3 solid solution for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique and recorded an extraordinary piezo constant of d33 = 1100–1540 pC N−1 at x ≈ 0.26. Such an interesting piezoelectric behavior can be attributed to the head-to-tail alignment of the cations, leading to noncentrosymmetry, which is the origin of the ferroelectric and piezoelectric natures of this mixed-molecule perovskite.
Having shed light on the key achievements in processing perovskite piezoelectric devices, it is worth noting that increased attention needs to be paid toward improving piezo- and piezo-photoelectric generation of conventional perovskites.238 In this context, Zheng et al.212 broadly reviewed the history and technical issues of Pb-free piezoelectric perovskites, particularly investigating the role of the boundary of the crystal phase domain, electrical properties, mechanisms, and theory behind them, as well as proposing certain intriguing applications. Li et al.214 analyzed the predominant factors that control the ferroelectric activity of perovskite materials, with more orientation toward theories, governing equations, and systematic measurement methods. Cheng et al.221 discussed single-crystalline perovskites as piezoelectric systems, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BaTiO3, and (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN-based components), as the most tested Pb-free piezoelectric components. This current work mainly discusses the properties, synthesis, and characterization methods, emphasizing on the piezoresponse force measurement technique and its application in energy-harvesting devices. We account for the state-of-the-art PV-assisted multifunctional perovskite devices, including piezoelectric and photo-piezoelectric devices as follows.
Bai et al.218 studied the optical and electromechanical properties of a typical ABO3 perovskite solid solution, namely, (1 − x)KNbO3−xBaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−σ (KBNNO, x = 0.1), where the oxygen atom content in the [(1 − x)KNbO3−xBaNi1] moiety governs the bandgap and light absorption. With an optimum atomic fraction and induction of potassium deficiency, the perovskite solid solution yielded a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 = 23 pC N−1 and a direct bandgap value of 1.48 eV, which makes it compatible for photon emission, sensing, and electrical and magnetic fields.
In many works detailing photoactive piezoelectric perovskites, PVDF is one of the critical additives. This can be ascribed to the PVDF's abilities to demonstrate piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties. Moreover, PVDF as a material is readily flexible and easy to process, and its engineering and application studies involve a wide range of piezo-based flexible electronics.239,240 PVDF consists of five different polymorphs, i.e., α, β, γ, ε, and δ, depending on the molecular chain conformation.241–243 Nevertheless, the demonstrated piezoelectric performance of PVDF is majorly related to the strong electrical dipole moment of the PVDF monomer unit in the β, γ, and δ phases.233,244
On the basis of the abovementioned PVDF functions, Sultana and co-workers attempted to design a photoactive piezoelectric perovskite by using an organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in β-PVDF (Fig. 8a).25 Dipole induction from PbI3− cage corners in the perovskite are capable of forcing the CH2−/CF2− groups in PVDFs to align along the polymer backbone. This alignment creates strong electroactive β phases in the vicinity of the perovskite. An optimum polymer content causes CH3NH3PbI3 to dissociate into the CH3NH2 and HI gas phases. The generated gases escape out from the perovskite–polymer layer, leaving behind porous matrices with enhanced electrical responses toward strain.245 Hydrophobic PVDFs encapsulate the perovskite against action from oxygen and moisture,65 as well as increases flexibility, which make it more resistive toward stress cycles.246 Huang et al. utilized PVDFs to enhance the piezoresponse of copper halide perovskite (MA2CuCl4, MA:CH3NH3+) composite films.233 However, their composites were not tested for photoelectric applications. The importance of their work is that it details the interaction mechanism of PVDFs and different perovskites structures. According to Fig. 8b, neat PVDF film and MAPbBr3/PVDF films show similar piezoresponses, while the piezoresponse of MA2CuCl4/PVDF composite films was considerably enhanced. The authors ascribed this to the structural difference in the two perovskites. In MAPbBr3, Pb is placed at the center of the [PbBr6] octahedron; in MA2CuCl4, the dislocation of Cu from the center of the [CuCl6] octahedron causes lattice distortion and consequently enhances polarization due to the strain (improved intrinsic piezoelectric). As a parallel effect, the strong electrostatic interaction between N from MA2CuCl4 and F in PVDF branches strengthen the strain-induced polarization. This work sheds light on the efficient use of different existing perovskites to enhance their piezo behaviors in the presence of PVDFs.

With regard to high-efficiency PSCs based on the piezo-phototronic effect, Wang et al.234 theoretically investigated a perovskite piezo-phototronic solar cell with a gallium nitride (GaN) layer structure, as shown in Fig. 8c. Their design predicated high-efficiency hybrid devices under only 1% strain with improved open-circuit voltages of up to 3.8% with PCE of up to 25.46%. Ding et al.235 coupled a perovskite piezoelectric with a capacitor and applied the generated charge to light up a commercial LED. The harvesting layer was made from FAPbBr3 nanoparticles embedded in β-PVDF (preparation steps are shown in Fig. 8d). In agreement with similar reports, the astonishing piezoresponse (30 V, 6.2 μA cm−2) obtained from this system could be attributed to the intensive electrical interaction between the perovskite and PVDF polymer, as well as the improved deformability induced by the polymer. In order to measure the maximum potential of the piezoelectric performance, the sample was exposed to a strong electrical field (poling). FAPbBr3–PVDF electric dipoles initially show random alignment, which may easily frustrate or negate each other. Upon poling, the highly oriented dipoles induce directional polarization. Kim et al.217 was able to apply an electrical field of 80 kV cm−1 to boost the polarity of bare CH3NH3PbI3, yielding a voltage of 2.7 V and current density of 140 nA cm−2 under stress of 0.5 MPa, which were higher than those achieved from the nonpoled counterpart. Coll's team studied the impact of illumination on the electromechanical characteristics of (CH3NH3PbI3).24 Light-assisted PFM yielded a quantitative assessment of CH3NH3PbI3 grown on TiO2, revealing that the surface morphology and perovskite grain size slightly influence the photo-piezoresponse. Temperature variations, on the other hand, significantly change the phototronic performance of CH3NH3PbI3, stemming from the crystal phase variation.
Recently, Hu et al.236 designed a ZnO microwire for the dual function of piezoelectric induction and n-junction under CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 8e). They revealed that the power output of a PSC with a piezoelectric n-layer depends upon the direction of the imposed stress and ensuing strain. Their findings raise theoretical speculation about the role of crystal orientation in the ZnO wire. As concluded, effective polarization takes place when the applied stress can incline the c-axis of the ZnO wire toward the perovskite interface. Only in this case, the conduction band of ZnO approaches the conduction band of the perovskite, consequently resulting in more natural electron conduction. Recently, Gu et al.237 theoretically studied the piezo-photoelectronic properties of organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. Their work revealed the possible cell performance parameters, i.e., PCE, open-circuit voltages, fill factor, and power output. Fig. 8f shows the schematic and energy band diagrams of the proposed device under applied tensile and compressive strains. From their results, external strain on the perovskite layer, in general, linearly improved the cell performance, which effectively and considerably increased the fill factor and PCE. For example, strains from −1 to 1% linearly improved the fill factor and PCE from 78.5 to 79% and 4.85 to 5.05%, respectively.
6. Current status of Pb-free perovskite semiconductors as important materials in integrated PSCs
The unique optoelectrical characteristics of organic–inorganic perovskites, i.e., high bandgap and absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, and improved carrier mobility, majorly stem from a stable orthogonal unit cell. Pb2+ ions form the foundation of a 3D unit cell of perovskites and fit the ideal coordination and interatomic distances.235,252,253 From the other aspect, Pb should be avoided because of its toxicity, which severely hinders the applications of perovskite power sources in daily human life.254 The degradation of PbI2 in air produces carcinogens and increases the risk of nervous and renal health problems.255,256 In order to address the environmental and health-risk concerns, the search for Pb-free PSCs with superior performance has intensified. Despite the long-term experimental and theoretical studies that have emphasized on stability, secure processing, and toxicity, the PCE of Pb-free PSCs still lags behind that of inorganic and Pb-based perovskite analogues. A range of potential candidates for the next generation of clean PVs, ranging from germanium halides,16,256 alkaline earth metals,257–262 transition-metal-based halides,263 antimony halide,252,264–268 and bismuth perovskites to metal chalcogenides254,255,269–273 have been investigated. In this section, we analyze the current status of efficient, stable, and nontoxic Pb-free perovskite PV materials and the state-of-the alternative art compositions for Pb-free perovskite systems owing to their importance in integrated devices.
6.1 Tin (Sn)-based perovskites
Studies have indicated that Sn-based perovskites offer favorable optical and electrical properties, e.g., a tunable bandgap from 1.2 eV for MASnI3 (ref. 30) to 3.9 eV for Cs2SnCl6;247,274 large absorption coefficient (up to 2.6 eV);274 and significant charge carrier mobility (1.29–3.03 cm2 V−1 s−1).251,275 The theoretical PCE of Sn-based perovskite systems can potentially reach 33% in theory.247,270 However, in practice, Sn-based PSCs could thus far yield the maximum overall PCE value of 9%.250,251,254,274,276–279 Sn itself shows some traces of toxicity, particularly when poured into water,254,278 but evidences show that Sn2+ in perovskites exposed to air is oxidized to an inactive metal oxide.254 Seamless encapsulation can resolve this hazardous challenge.270 With these highlights and challenges, Sn is still maintaining the pace as the most appealing alternative (or dope) to Pb for use in organic–inorganic perovskite devices. Beyond these intriguing physical properties, Sn provides a fit atomic radius as compared to the atomic radii of other divalent metals, which induces minor lattice imperfections.247,251,280–282 Liu et al.247 fabricated inverted planar organic Pb-free, FA0.75MA0.25SnI3, PSCs, yielding PCE of 9.06% with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 9a). With the same perovskite (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3, Zhao's group extensively optimized the FA and MA cations to formulate (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3 with different performances and bandgaps (Fig. 9b).248 They realized that the optimized stoichiometry of (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3 in inverted planar alignment could improve the PCE from 4.29% (for MASnI3) up to 8.12% (for (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3). This improved efficiency could be ascribed to the relatively better lattice form of (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3, which is responsible for inhibiting carrier recombination. Therefore, the hybrid cation formulation can be taken as one of the approaches toward fabricating high-efficiency Sn-based PSCs.

Chatterjee et al.249 investigated the efficiency and stability of a Pb-free hybrid iodide perovskites by introducing a mixed metal formulation, namely, MA3(Sb1−xSnx)2I9, for low-bandgap defect-ordered materials. In their work, the absorbance and current density of the perovskite was found to increase with the Sn content (Fig. 9c). The increase in current density with Sn substitution can be ascribed to the narrowing of the perovskite bandgap, leading to the photogeneration of a more significant number of electrons and holes in the cell. For absorption, according to their justifications, the free carriers induced by Sn4+ exceed the conduction band edge density of states. This phenomenon typically occurs due to the hetero-valency in semiconductors,283 and it improves the absorption coefficient. In this work, with an appropriate Sn content (Xmass = 0.4), the apparent bandgap and refractive index of the perovskite film were determined to be about 1.53 and 2.74 eV, delivering PCE of 2.69% in an inverted aligned cell.
Chen et al.250 developed a divalent 2D/3D perovskite film (CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x) combined with N-(3-aminopropyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (NAP), reaching champion PCE of 13.4% in an inverted architecture with organic junctions. Based on their proposed mechanism, the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group (e.g., g-butyrolactone) can form a Lewis base with NAP, which coordinates with the bivalent (Sn2+/Pb2+) to form vertically oriented 2D regions, as shown in the TEM images and model schematic shown in Fig. 9d. It was also inferred that the passivated trap sites in the 2D/3D structure accounted for the desired PV behavior and long lifecycle of the perovskite films. Funabiki et al.251 investigated the optical/electrical properties of (CH3NH3)2SnI6 (Fig. 9e). This perovskite variant with a strong absorption coefficient of ∼7 × 104 cm−1, carrier concentration of ∼2 × 1015 cm−3, electron mobility of ∼3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and superior conductivity (4-fold) under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) is a reliable Pb-free optical semiconductor suitable for solar cell applications. Chen et al.284 introduced a biphase Sn-based perovskite film composed of ultrathin 2D phenylethylammonium bromide (PEABr) underneath (LDP) and 3D formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) on the top. The deposition of FASnI3 on LDP favors the lattice morphology and orientation, resulting in a reduced density of trap sites. The organic inverted planar structure in this double-layer Pb-free perovskite delivered champion PCE of 7.05%. Similarly, Shao et al.279 combined layered 2D PEA2FAxSnyIz with 3D FASnI3 in a molar ratio of 1:10, yielding PCE of over 9.0% and considerable stability in an organic p–i–n structure. Lee et al.278 performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory and surface-/bulk-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) with synchrotron radiation to explain the instability of MASnI3 when compared with MAPbI3. They confirmed that after maintaining at 350 K for 4 ps, the chemical composition of MAPbI3 remained unchanged, whereas the metastable Sn–I bonding in MASnI3 became disrupted near the surface, causing the depletion of CH3–NH3+ cations and chemical degradation. The large gap between Sn and I in the vicinity of the surface breaks the Sn–I bond and shifts to achieve a stable chemical state. Further, Lee et al. attempted to reduce the role of Pb in perovskites by testing the different ratios of Pb/Sn in Sn-rich MAPb1−xSnxI2.6Br0.4. The Sn content of x = 0.6 yielded a compact and uniform grain structure, leading to hysteresis-free champion PCE of 13.4% in an organic p–i–n configuration and consequently affording air stability.281
6.2 Bismuth (Bi)- and antimony (Sb)-based perovskites
Bi and Sb possess desirable ionic radii that fit into hexagonal unit cells, are moisture-stable, and are less toxic than Pb. Further, the electronegativity of Bi (2.02) and Sb (2.05) are akin to that of Pb (2.33). Based on these exciting properties, Bi and Sb have proven themselves as competitive nontoxic alternatives to Pb.30,253,285–293 Ahmad et al.253 synthesized a one-dimensional (1D) polymeric methylammonium bismuth chloride perovskite, namely, [(CH3NH3)3Bi2Cl9]n, prepared at room temperature, obtained by the diffusion of BiCl3 solution in methanol into an aqueous solution of methylene chloride (Fig. 10a). However, this component was not successful at the device level (PCE of 0.0001% corresponding to a nano-range current density and open-circuit voltage of 430 mV). Furthermore, the bandgap of Bi-based perovskites is undesirably high (2.1–2.8 eV),285,294 reducing the efficiency of the PV performance. Vigneshwaran et al. engineered the optical properties of Bi-based perovskites and obtained an ideal bandgap of 1.45 eV along with improved carrier mobility.294 Using chemical characterization, they inferred that S is prone to heal the defect points rather than chemically interact with the perovskite, which enhances the range of optical absorption and consequently tunes the bandgap within an optimal range. Regarding inorganic and organic–inorganic bismuth perovskites, (CH3NH3)3Bi2Br9 quantum dots show excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiency295,296 and (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 show PCE performances of 0.1% and 1% at the device level, respectively, which have been explored and independently reported by Park and co-workers (Fig. 8b).271 With a similar formulation, Lyu et al.17 reported PSCs based on methylammonium bismuth iodide, i.e., (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, yielding PCE of 0.190% with an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.510 V in a planar architecture.

The first methylammonium antimony sulfur diiodide (MASbSI2) perovskite was formulated by Nie and co-workers.30 It was prepared by the stepwise reaction between antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) (deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD)), antimony triiodide (SbI3), and methylammonium iodide (MAI). Despite the ideal lattice structure (tolerance factor of 0.99), the PV performance of MASbSI2 in mesoporous n–i–p stacking did not exceed 3.08% (Fig. 10c). However, it is worth noting that methylene-free Sb-based components, i.e., (NH4)3Sb2X (X = Br or I), can change the paradigm of solvent engineering as they are entirely soluble in ethanol. Along this line, Zou et al. examined the effect of I/Br ratio in (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x (x = 0–9), yielding champion PCE of 0.51% from (NH4)3Sb2I9, which possesses a single-crystal characteristic (Fig. 10d).252
As a fascinating Pb-free approach, double perovskite compounds are outlined in several theoretical and experimental works.255,297–301 In principle, double perovskites adopt the 2-1-1-6 atomic stoichiometry, where B1+ and B3+ cations replace the adjacent B2+ cations. Fig. 11a shows a comparison of the lattice configuration of a typical ABX3 (1-1-3) and double A2BB′X6 (2-1-1-6) perovskite. A combination of bismuth (Bi2+) with a monovalent metal (M1+) is reported in several Pb-free formulations, such as Cs2BiAgCl6, Cs2BiAgBr6, and (CH3NH3)2KBiCl6.255,297–301 Calculations and systematic analysis substantiate that Pb-free double perovskites possess a tailorable bandgap in the range of 1.8–2.8 eV,255,297,300,301 long carrier lifetime of ≈660 ns,255,297 and longer active lifetime in air when compared with typical Pb-based perovskites.255,300 Following the approach of Pb-free double perovskites, mono and mixed halides (Cs2Au2X6) were considered because of their excellent optical bandgap, close to the ideal Shockley–Queisser value and theoretical PCE above 20% at the device level. According to the simulation results, the mixed valency of Au(+1/+3) optimizes the bandgap size to about 1.3 eV using intermediate band formation, yielding significant absorption factor and PCE of 30% in theory (Fig. 11b).263 Further, Chen's group reported the first Ti-based double perovskite, namely, Cs2TiBr6, prepared using sequential vapor deposition, yielding a favorable bandgap of 1.8 eV and electron–hole diffusion lengths of over 100 nm (Fig. 11c).262 In a planar n–i–p heterojunction, using an organic hole-transporting layer, the Ti-based perovskite could produce champion PCE of 3.3%. Table 4 summarizes the chemical formulation, bandgap, deposition method, cell structure, and champion PCE of state-of-the-art suggested Pb-free perovskites.

7. Concluding remarks
The increasing contribution of solar energy promises to create a fossil-fuel-free energy market in the foreseeable future. PSCs have been fairly popular in this arena on account of their astonishing PV efficiencies, competing with those of crystalline Si solar cells, in addition of their advantage of being printable on flexible, portable, and wearable substrates. However, as an individual power supply, PSCs cannot keep pace with its potential since drastic issues such as unsteady yielding and insecure composition make them unreliable for use in regular services. In addition, deterioration by oxygen and moisture, overheating, and interfacial chemical reactions with junctions severely hinders the universal application of PSCs. Beyond decomposition shortfalls, the output of solar-power-based systems is naturally disturbed by unstable illumination flux. Herein, we show that integrative PSC-based hybrid systems can combat these challenges because from a functional point of view, the incorporation of a PSC with a piezoelectric, TE, or electrochemical storage device can provide steady operation as well as improved output voltage. In terms of endurance, a directly stacked junction encapsulates the device against oxidation and hydration or removes the excessive heat generated during extended light exposures. Furthermore, the elimination of toxic Pb from organic–inorganic solar cells has been comprehensively addressed in numerous studies, which is a prerequisite for fabricating multitasking PV perovskite cells. This review is also partly devoted toward recent advances and progresses made in the development of Pb-free PSCs. We believe that multifunctional Pb-free photon-driven PSC-based hybrid devices can become the frontrunners of the energy market in the near future.
The development of integrated PSC-based TE, photocapacitor/battery, and piezoelectrically connected power packs would require core integration techniques, where carbon materials typically play an essential role as the bridging layer, back electrodes, and beyond. In each section, this review has specifically outlined the various positions that carbon materials can occupy and the additional functions or protection that it can induce for the development of a multifunctional PSC-based hybrid system. The continuously increased contribution of carbon materials to the architecture of PSC-based hybrid systems can be clearly recognized because they are hydrophobic, heat-removing, and mechanically sustainable, which is considered to be an appropriate strategy for the integration of perovskites. However, it is worth noting that the high cost and complicated preparation processes of high-performance carbon materials (e.g., graphene and carbon nanotubes) cannot be neglected, although Pb-free hybrid systems have been considered. In addition, the limitation of the degree of automation of available coating and integration techniques further demonstrate the barriers between lab-based and industry-level applications. More efforts need to be made in order to realize the future implementation of hybrid power and energy technologies based on sustainable carbon materials derived from highly abundant and renewable resources, as well as synthesized and manufactured using low-energy-consumption processes. For instance, carbon materials based on low-temperature synthesis methods (e.g., hydrothermal treatment of biomass) are attracting increasing attention from scientists in the field of hybrid power and energy technologies. Furthermore, CEs based on one-step fabrication techniques such as electrospinning methods are also feasible and versatile.
In addition to research on key materials (namely, carbon materials), the hybridization of PSCs could be further projected from different angles, among which it is the most important to favor active lifetime, robustness, miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, ease of use and setup, and enhanced and sustainable power generation performance. The level of integration and phase state of the joint element (TE, piezoelectric, electrochemical storage system, etc.) can each imposingly upgrade or degrade the function and endurance of the layout. A PSC–TE system should be equipped and designed with a thermally high-performance bridge layer to exhaust and transfer the excess thermal energy from the PV portion and convert it into an additional output voltage. However, a PSC–piezoelectric system could technically and structure-wise mimic a simple (p–i–n or n–i–p) PSC, but should necessarily be printed on a flexible substrate layer (e.g., PET, etc.) made of stress- and impact-resistive materials. In addition, the p–n junction is proposed to employ ferro/piezoelectric materials (such as ZnO and PVDF). A combination of perovskites with a piezoelectric polymer (e.g., PVDF) seems to be unsatisfactory since it may deteriorate photon absorption, work function, and carrier mobility of perovskites. On the basis of all these backgrounds, a flexible planar PSC with a ferro/piezoelectric semiconductive (n/p) under-junction, which is directly stacked on a symmetric carbon-electrode solid-phase supercapacitor, should be able to harvest energy from photons, vapor, and stresses, as well as have the ability to convert them into electrical voltage and simultaneously store the resultant voltage.
For PSC–electrochemical storage devices, PSC-based hybrid systems such as a remotely connected perovskite photocapacitor device cannot offer sufficient degree of packing, compactness, installment and incorporation, portability and modality, etc. Moreover, a LIB needs series-connected PSC modules in order to be charged; therefore, a uniform stacking arrangement is impractical and increases the risk of ion leakage and perovskite degradation. The latter commonly occurs when a hydrogel-dielectric solid-state capacitor is incorporated into PSCs. Overall, the development of novel integration techniques is still challenging. Based on possible solutions to problems involving integration techniques, this four-in-one PSC-based hybrid device allows a high level of harvesting from clean natural resources and can be easily worn or installed as a portable device, too. To enlighten the virtue of PSC-based hybrid power packs, more discussions involving the share and value of future energy production from critical materials to the integration techniques should be initiated by analyzing the hindrances vis-à-vis their deployment.

 	Fig. 1  Integration means of various devices for PSC-based hybrid devices. (a) Separate design to direct assembly. Here, two separately designed devices (for example, TE, electrochemical (EC), or piezoelectric (PE)) are connected to each other by the help of a wire connection or a bridging layer. The units can be concurrently or separately operated. (b) Uniform all-solid-state assembly. Here, the different units of the hybrid device are built in situ, usually in a layer-by-layer manner, until a full working device is obtained. The stacking, if made, should be monolithic, with the possibility of a shared functional layer, typically an anode or a cathode. (c) Illustration of a simplified PSCs-integrated device, including TE-, EC-, and PE-connected units. In all these hybrid devices, carbon materials play a vital role in connections and charge transfer. From dual units, complicated multi-in-one systems such as PSC–TE–EC and PSC–EC–PE devices can be developed (T1, T2, and T3 refer to different terminals/contacts for power output).
