1. Introduction
Michael addition, the nucleophilic addition of a stabilised carbanion to an electron poor alkene or alkyne, is widely used to form carbon–carbon bonds. A variation is to replace the carbon nucleophile with a heteroatom nucleophile, such as oxygen (oxa-Michael) or nitrogen (aza-Michael). One aspect of such hetero-Michael additions is in the formation of heterocyclic rings. A very widely applied reaction is the formation of tetrahydropyrans in a 6-exo-trig manner.1 This reaction has been extensively used in the synthesis of tetrahydropyran natural products. The analogous reaction with a nitrogen nucleophile is also known,2 as is the corresponding 6-endo-trig cyclisation to give a tetrahydropyran. The 6-endo-trig cyclisation with a nitrogen nucleophile, giving rise to piperidines, is less common, but has found application in a number of elegant syntheses. A few examples of the analogous 6-endo-dig reaction have been reported. The 5-endo reaction is even less frequently encountered. Indeed, 5-endo-trig is listed as “unfavourable” by Baldwin,3 although 5-endo-dig is favourable. The objective of this review is to summarise work on these aspects of the endo-aza-Michael reaction. This review is limited to the formation of saturated systems and excludes reactions leading to benzofused heterocycles.
Intramolecular endo-aza-Michael additions leading to piperidines 2 can firstly be divided into two categories: single and double (Scheme 1). In the case of the double-aza-Michael, the starting material is a dienone 1 and the first step of the mechanism is an intermolecular aza-Michael addition (which would give a structure such as 3 as an intermediate), followed in rapid sucession by a single intramolecular endo-aza-Michael addition. In the case of the single addition, the starting material 3 already has the nitrogen nucleophile in place. For both reactions, questions arise about the experimental conditions: acidic or basic, about the stereochemical outcome if the alkenes are substituted, and about the effect of the substituent on nitrogen, R, if any.
 Scheme 1  Single and double intramolecular endo-aza-Michael additions. 
In the case of the single aza-Michael, two further possibilities exist, depending on whether the electron withdrawing group is within the ring that is formed, or outside of the ring. While both reactions are endo in the Baldwin sense, they might be further termed endo-activated and exo-activated respectively (Scheme 2). The former is much more widely used than the latter. A third possibility is that two electron withdrawing groups are present, providing both endo- and exo-activation.4

Endo- and exo-activated additions. 
A final variant is that the Michael acceptor may be an alkyne, leading to a vinylogous amide 9 (Scheme 3). This reaction may also be applied to the formation of five membered rings.

2. The double Michael approach
Given the nature of the starting materials, it is no surprise that many of the earlier papers on this topic come from the laboratory of Nazarov. This work is entirely in the old Soviet literature and just a few examples will suffice.5 Treatment of dienone 10 bearing two methyl groups with methylamine yielded the trimethylpiperidine 11 as a mixture of isomers (Scheme 4). The trans isomer could be isolated by low temperature crystallisation and converted to the opioid analgesic promedol (trimeperidine) 12.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of (±)-promedol. 
A later study from the same laboratory focused on the stereochemical outcome in the case of 2,6-disubstituted piperidine formation (Scheme 5).6 Thus diallylketone 13 was treated with various primary amines to give, firstly isomerisation to the sensitive ketone 1, followed by the double aza-Michael addition. While the equilibrium ratio of the two products, cis-2 and trans-2, was claimed to be about 1:1, a more acidic medium, achieved by addition of ammonium salts, favoured formation of the cis isomer, while a more basic medium biased the ratio in favour of the trans isomer.
 Scheme 5  Stereoselectivity in the double addition according to Korshevets and Mistryukov. 
These results are, however, in some contrast to a report of a double aza-Michael addition to ketone 14 proceeding with very high trans selectivity (Scheme 6).7 The authors published this reaction twice. In one of the two papers, they noted the sensitivity of the stereochemical outcome to conditions.7a
 Scheme 6  Stereoselectivity in the double addition according to Nakamura et al. 
A number of applications of this reaction have been reported.8 Curiously, some of them fail to comment on the stereochemistry despite using the compounds as enzyme inhibitors9 or other biomedical purposes!10 The reaction has also been applied to dienones with other substitution patterns. 3-Substituted piperidinones, such as 18, have been prepared in this way (Scheme 7), with the precursor dienone 17 being derived in these examples by the use of a Shapiro reaction.11
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of a 3-substituted piperidinone. 
In addition to the Nazarov example cited earlier, the double aza-Michael addition has been employed for additional examples of 2,5-disubstituted piperidinones (Scheme 8).12 In this case, the starting dienone 21 was readily available by a combination of regioselective alkyne hydrostannylation and Stille coupling. It was found during this study that the aza-Michael process may be accelerated by the addition of lithium chloride, presumably acting as a Lewis acid; in addition, the Stille and Michael chemistry could be combined in a one-pot process. The product 22 was isolated as an unspecified mixture of diastereoisomers.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of a 2,5-disubstituted piperidinone. 
Trisubstituted piperidinones have also been prepared (Scheme 9). In the first case a single isomer of the product 24 was obtained, with the stereochemistry determined by means of 1H NMR.13 In the second case, “primarily one isomer” of the product was obtained, the structure of which is likely to be quinolizidinone 27.14 In both of these cases, the suggested product is the “all equatorial isomer” which may reflect thermodynamic control.
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of trisubstituted piperidinones. 
A special case involves cyclic dienones 28 which give rise to bicyclic addition products (Scheme 10). A series of such compounds have been synthesised for physical organic chemistry studies using various nitrogen nucleophiles yielding bicylic anilines 29,15 hydrazines 30,16 and amines 31,17 although attempts to use hydroxylamines ran into difficulties and an indirect route to the products had to be devised.
 Scheme 10  Synthesis of bicyclic compounds. 
It may be noted that 31a is tropinone. The reaction also works for the higher homolog (n = 2), yielding pseudopelletierine 31b,18 and this constitutes syntheses of these two natural product derivatives.
3. Applications of the double addition in the synthesis of natural products
Snider and Liu used the double addition of ammonia in a synthesis of (±)-cylindricine (Scheme 11).19 Exposure of dienone 32 to ammonia yielded the piperidinones 33 and 34. As expected from the earlier Soviet work, the ratio of diastereoisomers was influenced by the acidity of the medium, with addition of ammonium chloride giving more of the undesired isomer 34. The desired isomer 33 could be converted into cylindricine A 36 with very modest stereoselectivity by a Hoffman–Loffler–Freytag type cyclisation. Cylindricine A 36 could then be converted to cylindricine D 37 and to cylindricine E 38.
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of cylindricines by Snider and Liu. 
Both Molander and Trost also employed double aza-Michael additions in syntheses of cylindricines, but made the reaction intramolecular through the third valency of nitrogen. Thus, in both cases, formation of the piperidinone involves an exo-aza-Michael addition, followed by an endo addition. Molander and Röhm were able to prepare the double Michael acceptor by carbonylative Stille coupling, then instal the azide group to form dienone 39 (Scheme 12).20 Aqueous chromium(II) chloride proved to be the reducing reagent with the best chemoselectivity giving cylindricine C 40 directly. The high diastereoselectivity was ascribed to a steric clash in the transition state leading to the alternative product of the second aza-Michael addition.
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of cylindricine C by Molander and Röhm. 
Trost and Rudd were able to prepare an analogous dienone 42 from diyne 41 using a ruthenium catalysed hydrative cyclisation (Scheme 13).21 As they employed a Boc protected amine, an acidification-neutralisation sequence delivered cylindricine C 40. In turn, cylindricine C 40 could be converted into its methyl ether, cylindricine D 37, and its acetate, cylindricine E 38.
 Scheme 13  Synthesis of cylindricines by Trost and Rudd. 
A double addition was employed in the synthesis of 48, a model for cylindrospermopsin 49 (Scheme 14).22 The dienone 45 was built up using organolithium chemistry, then exposed to ammonia and ammonium chloride. This gave the piperidine 46 as the major product, while additional material could be obtained by equilibration of the other isomers formed. It may be noted that 46 is the isomer with all substituents in equatorial positions. Interestingly, attempts to form a guanidine resulted in epimerisation at the α-position. Consequently, the ketone was reduced prior to guanidine and then sulfate formation.
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of a cylindrospermopsin model. 
A modestly diastereoselective double addition was employed to construct the piperidine moiety of (−)-lentiginosine 55 (Scheme 15).23 The dienone 52 was assembled using a combination of metathesis chemistry and Grignard chemistry. Exposure of dienone 52 to benzylamine provided the piperidinones 53a and 53b as a 5.2:1 mixture of diastereoisomers at best. Interestingly, while addition of a little trifluoroacetic acid as a catalyst resulted in a faster reaction, it also resulted in lower diastereoselectivity. Upon exposure of the mixture to a benzylamine-trifluoroacetic acid mixture, equilibration occurred to lower the ratio to 2.4:1. Thus, the desired isomer 53a is favoured both kinetically and thermodynamically, though the margin of ΔG is slight. The second ring could be formed by a combination of ozonolysis of the alkene of the major isomer 53a and reductive amination to give indolizidine 54. Removal of the ketone group by the Mozingo method and deprotection yielded the natural product 55.
 Scheme 15  Synthesis of (−)-lentiginosine. 
The alkaloid (+)-hyperaspine 62 has also been prepared using an intramolecular endo-aza-Michael addition (Scheme 16).24 A conventional sequence converted the known alcohol 56 to the hydroxyenone 58. Exposure of this material to mesyl chloride and a base resulted in dehydration, thereby eliminating one of the stereogenic centres, and forming the dienone 59in situ. This material was not isolated, but trapped by addition of benzylamine. This yielded a 3:1 mixture of two piperidines 60a and 60b. These turned out to be both 2,6-cis piperidines, but diastereoisomeric with respect to the pre-existing stereogenic centre bearing the benzyloxygroup. Fortuitously, the major isomer 60a had the correct stereochemistry and could be converted to the natural product 62. While the authors advanced some rather dubious explanations involving conformations of cyclisation to rationalise the stereochemical outcome, it firstly has to be borne in mind that the stereochemistry of the piperidinone is established during the first addition, and that may occur at either of the two alkenes; secondly, such speculation is premature until it can be established whether the reported ratio is the result of thermodynamic or kinetic effects.

4. Single addition to alkene acceptors
In this approach, the starting material already possess the nitrogen nucleophile and, thus, one stereogenic centre can be defined prior to the Michael addition (though equilibration during cyclisation may remain a possibility). One example was found to proceed most efficiently under the conditions that would be employed for ketal formation (Scheme 17).25 Thus, when enones such as 63 were exposed to ethylene glycol and tosic acid, a tandem cyclisation-protection occurred giving the product 64 in much better yield than when a straight forward Lewis acid mediated reaction was attempted. Interestingly, when the analogous starting material 65 with a methyl group on the alkene was subjected to the reaction conditions, a 9:1 mixture in favour of the higher energy trans product 66a over the cis product 66b, was obtained, regardless of the stereochemistry (E or Z) of the starting material. This may indicate facile isomerisation of the alkenes under these conditions.
 Scheme 17  aza-Michael addition with ketal formation. 
More detailed studies showed that a number of factors could have an effect on the diastereoselectivity.26 For instance, changing from ethylene glycol to propane-1,3-diol resulted in an increase. Methanol could also be used in place of a diol. The amount of acid is also a significant variable. With amounts of acid that are well below stoichiometric, the trans isomer was favoured, but, with much larger amounts of acid or with a much longer reaction time, the cis product could become the major product. This is likely to be due to the promotion of equilibration.
Illustrating how the stereoselectivity depends on the substituent on nitrogen, treatment of a trityl protected amine 67 with acid, followed by a reductive amination procedure yielded the trans-disubstituted piperidine 68a with high selectivity (Scheme 18).27 On the other hand, treatment of the trityl protected amine 67 with acid, followed by base yielded the cis isomer 68b as the major product with a ratio of isomers of 75:25.28 In the former case, it is likely that the nucleophilic species is the imine 69, with an N-substituent that is sterically demanding due to sp2-hybridisation. In the latter case it is likely that the nucleophilic species is the sterically undemanding primary amine 70.
 Scheme 18  aza-Michael addition with reductive amination. 
Thus there are numerous examples in which 2,6-disubstituted piperidines can be formed with varying degrees of stereoselectivity, but few attempts to rationalise the results (Scheme 19).29 When the substituent on the nitrogen atom, R2, is sterically demanding, the trans isomer is typically preferred. Such groups may compel the α-substituent, R3, to be pseudo-axial in the transition state 71. Examples are shown in Schemes 17 and 18 with CBZ and imine groups on the nitrogen. When the group, R2, on nitrogen is absent or sterically undemanding, then the cis isomer tends to be favoured via transition state 72 in which both substituents R1 and R3 are equatorial. Examples can be found in Schemes 9, 14, 16 and 18 above, as well as Scheme 32. The reaction shown in Scheme 6 seemingly bucks this trend but, it may be noted that one alkene of the starting material has Z geometry. The reaction shown in Scheme 27 also fails to fit into this classification due to very low stereoselectivity. While this is a necessarily simplistic analysis as it disregards equilibration, it may prove to be helpful.
 Scheme 19  Rationalisation of the stereochemical outcome. 
In addition, there is one report outside of the natural product synthesis literature of an exo-activated endo-aza-Michael addition giving the phosphorus substituted heterocycle 74 (Scheme 20).30 In this report, while there was no mention of the stereochemical outcome, it was noted that the use of a cesium base was important to avoid the alternative pathway of attack by nitrogen on the ester group.
 Scheme 20  An exo-activated addition. 
There are two examples of alkenes which, as a Knoevenagel products, are both exo- and endo-activated (Scheme 21). In one report, the aza-Michael precursor 76 is generated in situ by an imino-aldol reaction.31 It is notable that there is very high diastereoselectivity for the 2,6-cis isomer 77 which exists as the 2,6-diaxial conformer. While this was attributed to π-stacking,32 it may simply be due to the steric demand of the N-substituent disfavouring the 2,6-diequatorial conformer.33 High diastereoselectivity arose from the use of a chiral auxiliary on the nitrogen nucleophile. In another report, an L-menthyl group was incorporated into Michael precursor 78 as a chiral auxiliary, but proved to be less effective in terms of stereocontrol.34

5. The hidden endo-aza-Michael

endo-aza-Michael reactions may be hidden inside tandem sequences. Specifically, the reaction between an imine (or an iminium ion) and the enol (or enolate) of an α,β-unsaturated ketone can be formulated as a combination of a Mannich reaction and an endo-aza-Michael addition. It can also be formulated as a Diels–Alder reaction in which the Michael acceptor participates through an enol or enamine derivative.35 Some reports clearly claim a Diels–Alder reaction (Scheme 22),36–39 some indicate the tandem Mannich–Michael process (Scheme 23),40,41 while others make no comment on the mechanism (Scheme 24).42 One report acknowledges the dichotomy43 and one further report says “Diels–Alder”, but draws “Mannich–Michael”!44 Syntheses of three piperidine alkaloids appears to involve what is clearly a Diels–Alder reaction and, hence, are not discussed here.45 In many of these reactions, whatever the mechanism, the use of an organocatalyst results in an efficient asymmetric process. The method has been found useful, for instance in the synthesis of antihypertensive compounds,46,47 adrenoceptor antagonists,48 and novel β-lactam antibiotics.49 Some applications to natural product synthesis are discussed in the following section.
 Scheme 22  Piperidinone syntheses reported as hetero-Diels–Alder reactions. 
 Scheme 23  Piperidinone syntheses reported as Mannich–Michael sequences. 
 Scheme 24  A piperidinone synthesis that may involve a Mannich–Michael sequence. 
An exo-activated endo-aza-Michael is a component of a rather complex tandem process leading to octahydroindoles 100 and 101 (Scheme 25).50 The sequence involves a Michael addition of a β-ketoester, 99, to an unsaturated aldehdye, followed by an intramolecular Aldol process. This generates an intermediate 102 which then undergoes an exo-activated endo-aza-Michael addition. With a starting material, 99a, containing a stereogenic centre, a highly diastereoselective reaction could be achieved with just lithium hydroxide as the base. Alternatively, a stepwise organocatalytic version gave good enantioselectivity using the Hayashi catalyst 103. This chemistry has been used in the synthesis of several decahydroquinoline alkaloids.50

The condensation of a ketone 104, an aldehyde (twice over) and an amine to give a highly substituted piperidinone 105 may also be formulated as a tandem process incorporating an intramolecular aza-Michael addition (Scheme 26). On the other hand, a combination of two Mannich processes is likely.51,52

6. Applications of the endo-activated single addition in the synthesis of natural products
A simple application of this reaction to piperidine alkaloids is in the syntheses of spruce alkaloid 109a and (+)-241D 109b (Scheme 27).53 Exposure of the enone 106a to the sequence of trifluoroacetic acid and an amine base, as discussed earlier, gave a mixture of piperidinone 107a and 108a. Although the yields were good, the reaction almost completely lacked diastereoselectivity. This was attributed to the small size of the methyl group. The desired cis isomer 107a could be reduced with good selectivity to give the spruce alkaloid 109a. Likewise, enone 106b could be converted to alkaloid (+)-241D 109b. A related synthesis of this alkaloid is shown in Scheme 36.
 Scheme 27  Synthesis of spruce alkaloid and alkaloid (+)-241D. 
The single endo-aza-Michael addition has been used in several syntheses of lasubine 114 (Scheme 28). Probably the first example is in a synthesis reported by Pilli et al.54 In this case, the Michael substrate 111 was generated by addition of an enol ether to an iminium ion generated in situ from N,O-acetal 110. Given the acid lability of the Boc protecting group, a one pot protocol was developed to deliver the quinolizidines 112 and 113via an in situ endo-aza-Michael addition. The quinolizidines were obtained as mixtures of diastereoisomers. In the case where R = Me, the major product 112a had this substituent in an axial position and, thus, this is the alkaloid (±)-myrtine. When R was 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl, the diastereoselectivity was a little lower, but the mixture could be converted to 113b by equilibration with base. Diastereoselective ketone reduction then yielded (±)-lasubine II 114.
 Scheme 28  Synthesis of (±)-myrtine and (±)-lasubine II by Pilli et al. 
The same chemistry could also be applied to indolizidine synthesis, in this case (−)-indolizidine 223AB 118, a dendrobatid frog alkaloid (Scheme 29). The starting material, N,O-acetal 115, was obtained from pyroglutamic acid.
 Scheme 29  Synthesis of (−)-Indolizidine 223AB. 
Another synthesis of myrtine 112a also employed an intramolecular aza-Michael addition (Scheme 30).55 The addition was reported to proceed with complete selectivity. The Michael precursor 111a, the same one as in Scheme 27, was obtained in optically active form by an organo-catalysed asymmetric exo-aza-Michael addition, so that the synthesis delivers (+)-myrtine 112a.
 Scheme 30  Synthesis of (+)-myrtine. 
A more ambitious double endo-aza-Michael was part of a synthesis of both enantiomers of the macrocyclic alkaloid petrosin 121 (Scheme 31).56 The two quinolizidine moieties were established together by a deprotection-aza-Michael sequence of the dimeric material 120 using the an unusual sequence of reagents. Model studies had shown that wet silica gel was the optimum reagent to give the quinolizidine as “effectively a single isomer”. The synthesis was completed by ring closing metathesis and hydrogenation.
 Scheme 31  Synthesis of petrosin. 
An asymmetric synthesis of (−)-lasubine II 114 that is very closely related in concept to the chemistry of Scheme 28, but quite distinct in execution, has been reported (Scheme 32).57 This method was inspired by the biosynthesis which involves the cyclic imine Δ1-piperideine 123. The key to the success of the synthesis was organocatalysis. Thus, the reaction between the cyclic trimer 122, which acts as a source of piperideine 123, and enone 124 in the presence of (S)-proline as the organocatalyst in DMF gave the quinolizidinone 113b in 96% e.e. and with very high diastereoselectivity in a single step. Diastereoselective reduction then gave (−)-Lasubine II 114. (+)-Subcosine II, the dimethylcaffeoyl ester, could then be prepared. Corresponding indolizidines could be prepared similarly and the formal syntheses of a number of other quinolizidines could be claimed.
 Scheme 32  Biomimetic synthesis of (−)-lasubine II. 
In addition, to the Lasubine example given above, the “hidden” aza-Michael reaction has been used in a short synthesis of ent-dihydrocorynantheol 126 (Scheme 33).58 The Mannich–aza-Michael (or Diels–Alder) product 125, produced by an asymmetric organocatalytic reaction as in Scheme 24 (with a seven day reaction time) could be converted to the ent-natural product 126 in just three steps.
 Scheme 33  Synthesis of ent-dihydrocorynantheol. 
Use of (R)-proline, naturally, gave access to the enantiomer of 125.59 This could be converted to ester 128, a known precursor of dihydrocorynantheine 130, and, by an elegant ring contraction, to ester 131, a known precursor of isorhynchophylline 132 (Scheme 34).
 Scheme 34  Synthesis of dihydrocorynantheine and isorhynchophylline. 
In a synthesis of (−)-lasubine I 140, the endo-aza-Michael addition was combined with an organo-catalysed asymmetric exo-aza-Michael, although in separate steps (Scheme 35).60 The dienone substrate 137 was prepared by a sequence of cross-metathesis and a mild Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction. The exo-aza-Michael addition could then be effected using the organocatalyst 141, giving the piperidine 138 in 95% e.e. The corresponding tosyl and nosyl protected compounds behaved similarly, but the Boc analog failed to react. Removal of the sulfonyl group then triggered the endo-aza-Michael addition giving the quinolizidine 139. Interestingly, while this reaction proceeded with high diastereoselectivity (though seemingly under quite carefully defined conditions), some loss of enantiopurity was observed, implying that the retro-Michael–Michael reaction competes with the second Michael addition. The product was converted into (−)-lasubine I 140 in four steps. Quinolizidine 139 is also a promising intermediate for the synthesis of other alkaloids, such as vertine.
 Scheme 35  Two aza-Michael additions in a synthesis of (−)-lasubine I. 
A synthesis of two of the lasubines, plus another alkaloid, employs the addition of a silyl enol ether 143 to Ellman-type imines 142 to generate the aza-Michael substrates 144 (Scheme 36).61 An acid–base sequence removes the auxiliary, resulting in the endo-aza-Michael addition. In the case of the substrate with a nonyl side chain 144a, simple reduction of the resulting piperidinone 107b delivered alkaloid (+)-241D 109b. A related synthesis of this alkaloid is shown in Scheme 27. Alternatively, with the more functionalised enone 144b, removal of the chiral auxiliary resulted the endo-aza-Michael addition and a second cyclisation in tandem fashion to give a mixture of the diastereoisomeric quinolizidinones 145 and 146. The conversion of quinolizidine 145 to (−)-lasubine I 140 is well known; quinolizidine 146 could be converted to (+)-lasubine II 114. Additional syntheses of lasubine may be found in Schemes 28, 32 and 46.
 Scheme 36  Synthesis of three piperidine alkaloid natural products. 
Addition of a silyl enol ether also features in the synthesis of some other piperidine alkaloids (Scheme 37).62 In this case the use of a chiral auxiliary derived from galactose resulted in high diastereoselectivity when imine 147 reacted with enol ether 148 in the presence of a Lewis acid. Acidic treatment of the Mannich adduct 149 results in tandem aza-Michael addition–elimination to give the unsaturated piperidinone 150. After stripping out of most of the functionality of the heterocycle, removal of the chiral auxiliary delivered the alkaloid coniine 152. Anabasine 153 could be prepared in a likewise fashion.

7. Applications of the exo-activated addition in the synthesis of natural products
As pointed out in the introduction, the exo-activated variant of the endo-aza-Michael addition is less frequently encountered in the literature. One application is in a synthesis of epi-deoxypancratistain (Scheme 38).63 The aza-Michael precursor 156 could be prepared by a straightforward Suzuki coupling and the endo-aza-Michael effected by treatment with a strong base. To the disappointment of the authors, the product 157 was the cis-fused isomer, presumably due to protonation of the intermediate on the less hindered face. In this case, attempted equilibration resulted in a host of side reactions. Michael product 157 could be converted to a stereoisomer of deoxypancratistin.
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of epi-deoxypancratistain. 
An endo-aza-Michael was used in a synthesis of (+)-lysergol 161 (Scheme 39).64 The starting material 158, arising from a organocatalysed Michael addition, cyclised in 6-endo fashion (rather than 6-exo attack on the ester group) to give a mixture of diastereoisomers, 159 and 160, with reasonable selectivity. The isomers could be taken through to (+)-lysergol 161 and its epimer, (+)-isolysergol 162.
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of (+)-lysergol. 
In a synthesis of (−)-cytisine 166, it was shown that either diastereoisomer of the product of an endo-aza-Michael addition could be formed according to the reaction conditions (Scheme 40) in a stereodivergent fashion.65 Treatment of the ester 163 with either fresh cesium carbonate or with LiHMDS gave the kinetic trans product 164, arising from face selective protonation of the intermediate enolate. On the other hand, heating with DBU delivered the thermodynamically favoured cis product 165 as the major isomer. This could be converted to cytisine in four steps.
 Scheme 40  Synthesis of (−)-cytisine. 
An endo-aza-Michael addition is also a part of the first synthesis of cytisine 166, reported by van Tamelen in 1950s (Scheme 41).66 This involved a tandem Mannich–aza-Michael process with decarboxylation to convert the malonic acid 167 to the trans-piperidine 168a. After base catalysed equilibration, the cis-ester 168b could be converted to (±)-cytisine 166. The intermediate species that undergoes the exo-activated-endo-aza-Michael addition is presumably amine 169. This is an unusual example, perhaps unique, of a pyridine being the activating group for an endo-aza-Michael addition.

8. Addition to alkyne acceptors
Alkynones can also be very effective Michael acceptors. Both the 5-endo and 6-endo intramolecular aza-Michael reactions are known. The majority of reports, however, employ gold catalysis and thus are not, in terms of mechanism, purely Michael additions. For instance Gouault et al. showed that ynones such as 170 underwent cyclisation in good yield on exposure to a gold(I) hexafluorophosphate catalyst67 or a gold(I) bistriflamide catalyst68 to give unsaturated piperidinones, such as 171, presumably via an α-aurated species 172 (Scheme 42). Indeed, when the cyclisation was carried out in the presence of an electrophilic halogen source, such as NIS, then the α-halo derivative 172 was obtained.69 The products can be subjected to a wide range of transformations which tend to take place on the face opposite to the existing substituent. Good stereocontrol arises because this substituent is axial.
 Scheme 42  Gold catalysed cyclisation. 
An example of the power of this stereocontrol is in the same laboratory's synthesis of a series of piperidine alkaloids: (+)-241D 109b, isosolenopsin 176a, isosolenopsin A 176b70 and epi-myrtine 113a (Scheme 43).71epi-Myrtine is also shown in Scheme 28; other syntheses of alkaloid 241D are shown in Schemes 27 and 36. The reaction has also been used in the synthesis of enzyme inhibitors.72
 Scheme 43  Alkaloid synthesis using gold catalysis. 
Silver has also been used to catalyse the cyclisation, although only one example of an endo-aza-Michael reaction, the conversion of ynone 177 to heterocycle 178, was given in a paper otherwise devoted to the endo-oxa-Michael addition (Scheme 44).73 It may be noted, however, that a metal catalyst is not necessarily needed. There are a number of examples in which the simple nucleophilicity of an amine is sufficient (Scheme 45).68,72,74,75
 Scheme 44  Silver catalysed cyclisation. 
 Scheme 45  6-endo-dig Aza-Michael additions. 
A 6-endo addition onto an alkyne may be involved in a formal synthesis of (−)-lasubine II 114 in which both rings of the indolizidine are established in a single laboratory step (Scheme 46).76 Exposure of the ynone 183 to hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium catalyst directly delivers the indolizidine 186 in a tandem process that involves deprotection, Michael addition, carbon–carbon π-bond reduction and nucleophilic substitution, as well as carbonyl reduction. The precise mechanism depends on the order of events: is the CBZ group cleaved before or after the alkyne is reduced? Thus either 184 or 185 may be intermediates (or both). The indolizidine product 186 may be converted to (−)-Lasubine II 114 by a known Mitsunobu process.
 Scheme 46  Formal synthesis of (−)-lasubine II via an alkynone. 
An advantage of the alkyne as the acceptor is that the corresponding 5-endo-aza-Michael addition is possible.77 Examples include reactions with gold catalysis78 and with platinum catalysis (Scheme 47).79 In the case of gold catalysis, use of the oxide resulted in the least epimerisation of the product 188 during cyclisation. Mercury has also been used, although, given the kinetic stability of the carbon-mercury bond, this is in a stoichiometric fashion with additional steps required to yield a metal-free product and thence obtain the alkaloid (+)-preussin 191.80
 Scheme 47  5-endo-dig Addition reactions. 
Quite surprisingly, sulfonamides can participate in such gold catalysed reactions, despite the strongly electron withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl group (Scheme 48).81 Treatment of alkynones such as 192 with a gold catalyst yields the β-tosyloxypyrroles 194. The reaction appears to proceed by gold catalysed addition of the sulfonamide nitrogen to the alkynone, initially yielding a cationic sulfonamide 193. An intramolecular translocation of the sulfonyl group from N to O then yields the functionalised pyrrole 194. On the other hand, if pyrrole formation is blocked by the presence of a quaternary centre, as in pyrrolidine 195, an external nucleophile, such as m-nitrophenol, can remove the sulfonyl group to yield a bicyclic enone 196. This aspect of the chemistry was applied to a formal synthesis of (+)-nor NP25302 197, an anti-leukemia agent.
 Scheme 48  Gold catalysed sulfonamide cyclisation reactions. 
As the tosyloxy moiety on the pyrrole can participate in Suzuki coupling reactions, this chemistry was applied to a synthesis of rhazinilam 201 (Scheme 49).82 This synthesis employed the gold catalysed cyclisation of ynone 198 to form the pyrrole ring and a CH-activation reaction to form the six-membered ring in transannular fashion. A Suzuki coupling between tosyloxypyrrole 199 and an o-borylated aniline derivative was a key step.
 Scheme 49  Synthesis of rhazinilam. 
An extension of this chemistry is to employ a substrate, such as 202, with an additional alkene or alkyne (Scheme 50).83 As the pyrrole rings produced are electron rich, a second cyclisation catalysed by gold can ensue to give bicyclic product 204, although the balance between the singly cyclised products and doubly cyclised products was quite dependent on the ring size, degree of substitution, and choice of catalyst.

9. Conclusion
The importance of the intramolecular aza-Michael reaction for organic synthesis has been amply demonstrated for endo-activated processes. The application of asymmetric catalysis, especially through organocatalysis, has resulted in some processes of remarkable efficiency. Despite the multiple applications of the reaction, there appears to be little understanding of the stereochemical outcome of these reactions. Studies of this issue are overdue. Few examples, however, have been reported for exo-activated processes and, while the stereoselectivity of this reaction appears to be now better understood, there is considerable scope for its wider application.
