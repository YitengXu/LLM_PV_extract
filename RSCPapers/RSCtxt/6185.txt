    , Accepted 15th May 2018First published on 29th May 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors are ideal gain media for fabricating laser and photonic devices due to high absorption, photoluminescence (PL) efficiency and low nonradiative recombination losses. Herein, organic–inorganic halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is embedded in the Fabry–Perot (FP) microcavity, and a wavelength-tunable excitonic lasing with a threshold of 12.9 μJ cm−2 and the spectral coherence of 0.76 nm are realized. The lasing threshold decreases and the spectral coherence enhances as the temperature decreases; these results are ascribed to the suppression of exciton irradiative recombination caused by thermal fluctuation. Moreover, both lasing and light emission below threshold from the perovskite microcavity (PM) system demonstrate a redshift with the decreasing temperature. These results provide a feasible platform based on the PM system for the study of light–matter interaction for quantum optics and the development of optoelectronic devices such as polariton lasers.
1. Introduction
Discovery of novel materials always plays a crucial role in the revolution of functional devices, especially in the field of optoelectronics. Recently, there has been a remarkable breakthrough in photovoltaics, i.e., the application of organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors in solar cells has resulted in high power conversion efficiency1,2 due to long carrier lifetimes, high carrier mobilities and low nonradiative recombination rates.3 As direct bandgap semiconductors, organic lead halide perovskite semiconductors also display some intriguing optical properties including large absorption coefficient, high fluorescence yield and low Auger recombination losses and thus, they are ideal candidates for low-cost, large-scale and efficient photonic devices.4–9 Moreover, the bandgap and exciton binding energy of several tens of meV (larger than thermal kinetic energy of ∼26 meV)10–14 for organic–inorganic halide perovskites can be tuned by varying the halide composition, thus making them promising building blocks for on-chip multi-color coherent light sources.15 Motivated by these interests, numerous efforts have been dedicated in discovering light-emission mechanisms and achieving lasing behaviors for lead halide perovskite semiconductors.6,16,17 It is known that low threshold carrier density is highly desirable for a laser device. However, this is not always achievable for a traditional inorganic semiconductor laser.18,19 Fortunately, organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors with high-quality cavity resonators (planar microcavity,20 Whispering-Gallery-Mode microdisk cavity,21 tunable open cavity22 and photonic crystals23) can overcome this limitation, thus complying with lower optical reflectivity losses and smaller mode volumes.24 Consequently, most lasing researches on organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors have focused on realizing the ultralow threshold in various cavities or nanostructures, but they are rarely studied for obtaining the relationships of the lasing threshold versus temperature and the lasing wavelength versus temperature. This is one of the key points for achieving a low-threshold lasing device using hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials.
In this paper, we have fabricated a vertical cavity surface emitting laser including a high fluorescent halide perovskite semiconductor to realize excitonic lasing with a threshold of 12.9 μJ cm−2 and a spectral coherence of 0.76 nm. The PL spectra reveal both the decrease of lasing threshold and the enhancement of spectral coherence, via tuning temperature, due to exciton irradiative recombination suppressed by thermal fluctuation.25 In addition, red-shifts of PL and lasing for the PM structure that are observed with the decreasing temperature enable a wavelength-tunable laser device, owing to the significant temperature dependence of perovskites.24,26 Our results provide a platform based on the PM system for investigating the underlying physics of light–matter interaction in quantum optics and for creating efficient optoelectronic devices.27–33
2. Results and discussion
The exciton of CH3NH3PbI3 has stronger oscillator strength and larger exciton binding energy of a few dozens of meV than the thermal kinetic energy at low temperature. The thin uniform film of the lead halide perovskite was excited by 633 nm continuous wavelength laser, and the light emissions obtained from band-to-band transitions of free carriers and exciton recombinations were probed using a micro-PL spectrometer. Fig. 1(a) shows the PL and absorption spectra of the thin film of CH3NH3PbI3 corresponding to the exciton transitions at 30 K, and the results indicated large absorption coefficient and high fluorescence yield. It was clear that the exciton transition peak observed in the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 was about 1.64 eV (756 nm), with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 50 meV (23 nm), implying large exciton binding energy, as calculated by framework of the Elliot's theory for Wannier excitons.10,11 The fitting details of exciton and band-edge absorption are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). Meanwhile, the two emission peaks in the PL spectrum were ascribed to the recombination of free excitons (760 nm) and bound excitons (796 nm), respectively, at 30 K,24 which was different from the excitonic transition at room temperature. To study the temperature dependence of the exciton transitions of the CH3NH3PbI3 material, we carried out detailed spectral measurements at different temperatures. Fig. 1(b) shows a series of absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 when the temperature was gradually increased from 15 K to 90 K; the results suggested that the absorption coefficient became weaker, the excitonic absorption peak broadened and a blue-shifted free excitonic transition (from 756.5 nm at 15 K to 742 nm at 90 K) occurred. The exciton-phonon and defect scattering are the reasons for the broadening of exciton absorption linewidth. The blue-shifted exciton transition (Fig. S1c†) complied with the temperature-dependent orthorhombic phase.
 Fig. 1  (a) The black and red curves represent the absorption and PL spectrum for the thin film of CH3NH3PbI3 at 30 K, respectively. (b) The curves represent a series of absorption spectra at different temperatures, which from the bottom to top are 15 K, 20 K, 30 K, 40 K, 50 K, 80 K and 90 K, respectively. 
For a lasing device, the gain media should be put in an optical cavity. In our device, a thin film of organic–inorganic halide perovskite as the gain medium is inserted in the FP microcavity, which consists of a top metallic mirror and a bottom dielectric distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror. Fig. 2(a) presents a schematic configuration of our experimental device. First, the DBR mirror was deposited on a silicon substrate, with a composition of 17.5 λ/4 pairs of silicon oxide and silicon nitride. Second, a gain film of CH3NH3PbI3 was spin-coated between the silicon oxide layer and a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer to center the perovskite near the antinode of the electric field in the microcavity and to obtain maximum coupling. Third, the top silver mirror of 30 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation. In the inset of Fig. 2(a), a high-quality multilayer structure with smooth interface and uniform facets can be observed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the cross-sectional morphology of the PM system.

(b) The left and right images represent the angle-resolved PL and reflectivity spectral mapping of the PM system at room temperature, respectively. The angle is the detection angle. 
To characterize the quality of microcavity, angle-resolved PL and reflectivity experiments were performed using a home-built micro-PL setup with the Fourier configuration at room temperature. The angle-resolved PL mapping (left image of Fig. 2(b)) illustrates that the dispersion relationship of the PM system is a parabolic curve as a result of the FP microcavity modulating the cavity photon mode energy in various detection angles (θ). The cavity mode energy is related to angle θ, and it is quantitatively described by the following equation:34 (1)Here, E0 is the cavity mode energy at normal detection (θ = 0°) and neff is the effective refractive index of the entire microcavity. The quality factor of the microcavity mode is about 312 at the resonance position (∼782 nm) in angle-resolved PL mapping, which is estimated by the equation Q = λc/Δλc, where λc and Δλc are the wavelength and FWHM of the cavity mode, respectively. The right image of Fig. 2(b) represents the angle-resolved reflectivity spectral mapping of the PM system at room temperature, and it exhibits that the reflectivity dispersion obeys the rule of optical bandgap for one dimensional photon crystal, also modulated by the angle θ as a parabolic curve. The reflectivity stopband of the bottom DBR mirror at normal detection ranges from 700 nm to 820 nm, and its reflectivity rate reaches the maximum of about 0.9 at 760 nm, as shown in ESI Fig. S3.† When the perovskite exciton energy is set to resonate with that of the cavity mode, the photons emitted from the perovskite are confined in the microcavity, which increases the radiative recombination efficiency, thus leading to the positive feedback of spontaneous emission (SE) enhancement.
The PM system performances for oscillation and amplification were characterized when we fabricated a high-quality PM system with high fluorescent efficiency. In Fig. 3(a), nonlinear enhancement of PL intensity for the free exciton transition can be observed at around 759 nm with pump fluence increase at 25 K, which is accounted for by the optical mode feedback selecting and amplifying, i.e., lasing. Fig. 3(b) illustrates a phenomenal line shape for the PL intensity versus pumping power, which implies the occurrence of lasing action; also, the threshold value is 12.9 μJ cm−2. The input-output curve shows that the linear region below the threshold contributes to SE for the free exciton transition, and the lasing behavior works in the nonlinear region above the threshold. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b), the relevant FWMH of the PL peak versus pump fluence presents further narrowing of FWHM Δλ above the threshold, suggesting high monochromaticity and spectral coherence for lasing. In Fig. 3(c), the lasing peak is fitted by Lorentz function, its intensity increases sharply and its FWHM further narrows down with increasing pump fluence. The inset of Fig. 3(c) is the zoom-in spectrum of a lasing mode for the PM system at the pumping fluence of 18.1 μJ cm−2 and the wavelength of 758.6 nm. From this inset, it can be seen that the Lorentz fitting lasing linewidth is as small as Δλ = 0.76 nm, and it is considerably smaller than the SE linewidth below the threshold. The blueshift (5 nm) observed with raising pump fluence may be due to the interaction of carriers and the reduction of refractive index.35,36 The other lasing characterizations are measured at different temperatures, as shown in ESI Fig. S4–S6.†

(b) Nonlinear response of the laser output intensity with pump fluence rise at 25 K, showing that the threshold is 12.9 μJ cm−2. The inset is the FWHM of PL peak versus pump fluence. (c) The PL spectra with pumping power increasing at 25 K. The pumping powers of curves from bottom to top are 10.2, 13.7, 16.3 and 18.1 μJ cm−2, respectively. The inset is a Lorentz fitting of a lasing mode (18.1 μJ cm−2), and the FWHM of this mode is 0.76 nm. 
To gain further insights into lasing characterizations mentioned above, we have performed the experiment by tuning the temperature from 25 K to 75 K. Fig. 4(a) shows the laser output intensity versus pump fluence curves at different temperatures. The phenomenal line shape for input-output curves disappeared above 55 K, implying that the lasing action vanished. It is noted that the corresponding lasing thresholds were raised by a gradual increase in the temperature, and the power law of the power dependence for the PM system SE (below threshold) reduced, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). Thus, the lasing from PM system degraded to the excitonic SE of lead halide perovskite. Moreover, Fig. 4(b) displays the spectra for lasing at the same pump fluence above threshold from 25 K to 75 K. When the temperature was increased, the lasing peaks degenerated, i.e., the laser linewidth broadened and output intensity decreased, which was in agreement with the input-output curves in Fig. 4(a). The spectral coherence, evaluated by lasing linewidth, and the lasing threshold are two key factors for the characterization of a laser device. The lasing threshold and linewidth are up to these factors, such as the loss of optical cavity (Q factor), the dissipation and spontaneous radiation efficiency of light gain materials. Meanwhile, it should be mentioned that homogeneous broadening lasing peaks and raised thresholds are ascribed to the increase in the probability of nonradiative recombination relaxation and exciton-phonon elastic scattering processing because of thermal fluctuation. The slight asymmetric profile for PL shown in Fig. 4(b) was very likely owing to intra-gap level trapping of one of the two carriers and the bound exciton transition.11 In addition, when the temperature decreased, a temperature variation of crystal lattice was introduced. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and the inset, the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition and intricate interaction between structural disorders resulted in a red-shifted free exciton SE;24,37 thus, the relevant lasing peak for the PM system shifted from 751 nm at 75 K to 758.6 nm at 25 K, which was in accordance with the previously reported absorption spectra data (Fig. 1(b)). Interestingly, the temperature dependence for semiconductor bandgap of the perovskite is abnormal for the common inorganic semiconductor, resulting in a wavelength-tunable laser emission by tuning temperature.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have experimentally realized a low threshold (∼12.9 μJ cm−2) and high spectral coherence (∼0.76 nm) laser device for organic–inorganic halide semiconductor with FP microcavity. The PM system has demonstrated that lasing threshold and wavelength can be tuned by temperature covering the near-infrared region (750 nm to 760 nm). The large absorption coefficient and the high fluorescence yield for organic–inorganic halide semiconductor can lead to lasing behaviors. Our findings have demonstrated that the PM system may be a feasible approach to develop electrically driven coherent light sources and to study fundamental quantum optics.
4. Experimental section
Microcavity system fabrication
The bottom DBR was first fabricated by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) consisting of 17.5 λ/4 pairs of silicon oxide (thickness d2 = 133 nm, refraction index n2 = 1.467) and silicon nitride (thickness d1 = 101 nm, refraction index n1 = 1.96). An optical gain film of CH3NH3PbI3 was secondly spin-coated between silicon oxide layer and a PMMA layer. The top silver mirror of 30 nm was finally deposited by thermal evaporation. The detailed procedure of the growth for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the bottom DBR was described in the previous report.38
Optical characterizations
The absorption spectroscopy and steady-state PL were performed on a confocal microspectrometer using reflective symmetry (Horiba-JY LabRam HR800UV). A 633 nm continuous wavelength laser was focused by a microscopy objective (50×) as the excitation source. Angle-resolved PL spectroscopy was measured in a home-built setup with the Fourier imaging configuration. A microscope objective (50×) focused the pump laser on the sample surface by off-resonant excitation with a pulsed laser source (wavelength: 633 nm, pulse width: 50 ps, repetition rate: 10 MHz). The fluorescence image from the microcavity was effectively collected into a spectrometer with a grating and a charge-coupled-device (CCD) through a microscope objective and a bandpass filter. Angle-resolved reflectivity spectroscopy was conducted on a macroscopic angle-resolved spectrograph (IdeaOptics R1). The lasing characterizations were carried out on a home-built micro-PL setup at low temperature in a vacuumed atmosphere. A femtosecond pulsed laser (wavelength: 633 nm, pulse width: 150 fs, repetition rate: 80 MHz) was used as the excitation source, which was focused by a microscopy objective (50×), and this was used for the excitation of the samples; the excitation laser spot was expanded by around 5 μm in diameter.

In the inset, the black line with squares is the relationship of the corresponding lasing threshold and temperature, and the orange line with triangles is the power law versus temperature for the power dependence of PM system (below threshold) at different temperatures. (b) A series of PL spectra with the same pump fluence above the threshold (1.4Pth) at different temperatures. The temperatures of curves from top to bottom are 25 K, 35 K, 45 K, 55 K, 65 K and 75 K, respectively. In the inset, the black line with squares is the relationship of the corresponding PL peak position and temperature, and the blue line with dots is the relationship of FWHM for the corresponding PL peak and temperature.
