However, some open issues still exist in these perovskites, like poor long-term stability, inevitable intrinsic defects and much nonradiative recombination, which greatly weakens their optical capability and seriously hinders their further development. The metal doping strategy, through the partial substitution of foreign ions for native ions, has gradually become an effective method for significantly enhancing the comprehensive properties of CsPbX3. Whereas some previous studies have reported the impressive properties of metal-doped CsPbX3, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review on the influences of metal doping on CsPbX3. In this review, we aim to provide a systematic review of the latest achievements in metal-doped CsPbX3, which focuses on their synthetic methods and the positive effects of metal doping on structure, optical properties, morphology control, carrier behavior and related optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Finally, we put forward a few opportunities and challenges about the further investigation of metal-doped perovskites, which may help researchers explore new research directions.
1. Introduction
In recent years, lead halide perovskites, benefitting from their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), strong luminescence emission and easy bandgap tuning, have shown enormous potential for next-generation high-performance optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.1–8 For example, organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have been widely developed and already show a famous reputation, and their perovskite solar cells (PSC) have demonstrated a high efficiency of more than 20%.9–13 However, the organic components in hybrid perovskites are extremely sensitive to moisture, light and heat,14–16 which inevitably accelerates the decomposition of devices.17 For pursuing better stability, all inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX3, with higher melting points and better thermal stability,18 have been vigorously developed and actively applied in the photovoltaic and optoelectronic fields. Fu's group reported a novel inverted CsPbI3 PSC with a high efficiency of 16.67%, presenting better phase stability against external erosion.19 Liu et al. also demonstrated a PSC based on CsPbI3 with an efficiency of 15.5% and an operating stability of 1000 h under ambient conditions.20 Besides, light-emitting devices (LED) based on CsPbX3 also show high efficiency and bright luminance in red, green and blue light range.8,21–25
Although a few excellent achievements have been made with CsPbX3, some inherent drawbacks still exist and seriously restrict their practical performances and wide applications. For example, lots of intrinsic in-gap halide defects in CsPbCl3 act as nonradiative traps to greatly weaken its photoluminescence and decrease its PLQY.26–28 The red-emitting perovskite CsPbI3 is prone to the harmful and rapid phase transition from black phase α-CsPbI3 (luminescent phase) to yellow phase γ-CsPbI3 (non-luminescent phase) at room temperature, showing poor long-term stability.29,30 Generally, these imperfect luminescence performances of CsPbX3 are closely related to their soft ionic lattices, which are attributed to the lower charges of constituent ions, the greater ionic bonding and the lower crystal lattice energies than conventional quantum dots.18,31,32 The nature of soft ionic lattice endows lead halide perovskites with facile synthesis in more mild conditions, but also enables them to be easily destroyed under heat, irradiation, moisture and polar solvents. In previous reports, many workable methods, like ligand exchange,33,34 polymer strategy35,36 and surface passivation,26,37,38 have been proposed to design a surface protection layer to effectively decrease halide defects, enhance stability and also improve their luminescence properties. However, these methods may temporarily protect the surfaces of perovskite rather than strengthening its fragile soft lattice.18,31 Besides, these methods may even cause unnecessary side effects. For instance, the replacement of original ligands with functional organic ligands could provide a stronger interaction between the perovskites and ligands to promote optical properties and stability.38–40 But the insulation of these organic ligands may inhibit the charge transfer ability in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.41
In this event, the metal doping method, introducing foreign metal ions into original lattice, can be a reliable choice to effectively improve the structural stability of perovskite lattice.1,23,28,42,43 The metal doping method reasonably alloys the specific metal ions into the host lattice to replace Cs+ or Pb2+ during the synthesis process. Therefore, this partial substitution inevitably causes lattice structure adjustments, like tolerance factor changing,28,44,45 lattice expansion,27 lattice contraction46–48 and micro distortion,30 and finally promotes their luminescence capacity. For instance, Guvenc et al. reported the Gd3+ doping approach to stabilize α-CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs),44 showing an increase in tolerance factor from 0.807 to 0.813 and PLQY from 10 to 80% with 10 mol% Gd3+ ions. Das's group alloyed Mg2+ ions into green-emitting CsPbBr3 lattice,47 and the prepared Mg–CsPbBr3 possessed a shrinking lattice with an ultra-high PLQY of ∼100% and a better air- and photo-stability. In addition to structural optimization, the metal doping method also has significant effects on carrier behavior,49–51 morphology,52–54 luminescence range55–57 and related devices performance,58–60 as shown in Fig. 1. These abundant positive achievements effectively prove the applicability of metal doping in all inorganic perovskites, which is worthy of further application and exploration.

In this review, we provide an overall review of recent advances in metal-doped CsPbX3. At first, we summarize some common preparation methods of metal-doped CsPbX3. Then, we mainly pay attention to the positive effects induced by metal doping, including structural change, morphology, enhancing optical properties, adjusting carrier behavior and influences on the related optoelectronic applications. Finally, we put forward some prospects and the possible development direction of metal-doped perovskites in the future.
2. The metal doping strategies
The key to synthesizing metal-doped perovskites lies in ensuring the effective introduction of foreign metal ions into the host to achieve its performance enhancement. Therefore, to achieve the successful metal doping, much effort has been devoted to developing facile and effective preparation methods for metal-doped perovskites, which includes hot injection,27,29,47,61,62 post-treatment cation exchange strategies,37,63–65 ligand-assisted-reprecipitation,66 supersaturated recrystallization67 and single-step ultrasonic synthesis.68 Among these reliable methods, hot injection and post-treatment cation exchange strategies are the two most frequently used ways for synthesizing metal-doped perovskites.
Hot injection was first applied by Kavalenko's group to prepare highly luminescent CsPbX3 in 2015,69 and now has been widely used to synthesize all inorganic perovskites and related products. In a typical hot injection strategy, lead and halide sources (like PbX2) are dissolved in a mixture of solvent and ligands. Then, the prepared Cs precursor is quickly injected into the PbX2 solution at a high temperature. Finally, perovskite crystals form after a rapid cooling process. This method advantageously provides a high temperature and inert reaction environment, which profits effective metal doping and the formation of uniform crystals.31,70 Benefitting from these obvious merits, this strategy has been commonly used to prepare metal-doped CsPbX3 with additional mixing the cation source into the PbX2 precursor solution. Most metal ions, like Mn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Rb+ and rare earth ions,43,47,55,61,71–73 can be effectively doped into the origin lattice to carry out A-site or B-site doping through this method. For example, Li et al. employed hot injection to achieve Zn doping for CsPbI3.73Fig. 2a presents the whole synthetic process of Zn–CsPbI3. First, PbI2 and different contents of Zn2+ salts were dissolved in octadecene (ODE), oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm). Then the mixture was heated to 180 °C, and the Cs precursor was quickly injected to form perovskites, followed by ice bath cooling down to get the final colloidal solution. Based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and X-ray diffraction (XRD), the as-prepared Zn2+-doped CsPbI3 showed the same uniformity as the undoped, but with better crystallinity. In addition, hot injection can be utilized to easily achieve co-doped perovskite NCs through adding the various metal sources into the precursor mixture at the same time.71,74–76

Post-synthetic cation exchange has also emerged as a powerful tool that can achieve successful metal doping at A sites or B sites of CsPbX3 lattices. This method usually uses pure perovskite NCs synthesized in advance as precursor, and then further adds a specific metal ion solution to finish the cation exchange. Representatively, de Mello Donega and his coworkers demonstrated the preparation of CsPb1−xMxBr3 NCs (M = Sn2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+; 0 < x ≤ 0.1) through a post-synthetic cation exchange between Pb2+ and these isovalent cations.46 The product NCs showed uniform morphology with retention of the parent nanocrystal shape and size. It should be noted that this post treatment occurs after the complete formation of perovskite lattice, which may increase the potential barrier for foreign metal ions to enter the host and also lead to a slower doping process and lower doping ratios.37,77 Therefore, some ligands or solvents which interact with the host could be additionally employed for post-synthetic cation exchange to promote the doping process. Mondal reported a postsynthetic treatment for CsPbCl3 NCs with CdCl2,63 where the saturated CdCl2 solution in ethanol or OAm was injected into an as-synthesized CsPbCl3 NC colloidal solution under ultrasonication (Fig. 2b). Both ethanol and OAm broke the PbCl6 octahedral structure and gave assistance to cation exchange and the dissolution of metal salt. Besides, this micro-break also resulted in the dislodgement of PbCl2 from the surface and then created more vacancies, which were filled quickly by CdCl2 already attached to the surface. Yang et al. used a metal carboxylate to effectively anchor the dopant elements on the perovskite surfaces.37 First, the ionic surface and liquid-like crystal structure facilitated the dynamic detachment of the anion–cation pairs and exposed the surface of Pb2+ ions. Then, the external surface interacted with the metal carboxylate, enabling Pb2+ ions to bond with carboxylate and making the dopant coordinate with adjacent halide ions. Benefitting from the dynamic surface nature, the surface ion pair (Pb–Oct) may be exchanged by the dopant ion pair (metal ion–Oct) to form a dopant-anchored surface, as shown in Fig. 2c.
In addition to hot injection and post-treatment cation exchange, some novel and feasible methods have also been developed to obtain metal-doped perovskite NCs with excellent capacities, including but not limited to ligand-assisted reprecipitation,66 supersaturated recrystallization67 and single-step ultrasonic synthesis.68 Li et al. demonstrated the preparation of Mn-doped CsPbCl3 through single-step ultrasonic synthesis.68 Cs2CO3, PbCl2, MnCl2, and some ligands were mixed in a nonpolar solvent, and then the reaction was initiated by an ultrasonic synthesizer at 350 W. After intense stirring for a period of time, Mn-doped CsPbCl3 NCs were obtained after centrifugation. The double emission peaks at 411 nm and 601 nm in photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the Mn signal in the elemental mapping powerfully proved the effective doping of Mn2+ ions.
3. The influence of metal doping on structure
The typical structure of CsPbX3 is concluded to a [PbX6] octahedral structure formed by bivalent Pb ions (B site) and halide ions (X site), with larger monovalent Cs ions (A site) occupying the spaces between the octahedral structures,69,78 as shown in Fig. 3a. The structural stability of perovskites can be judged by the tolerance factor (t), which is defined as: (1)where RA, RB, RX are the ion radius of each ion.23,44,79 Theoretically, when t is in the range of 0.8 to 1.13, the perovskite lattice can stay stable, and when t is closer to 1, the structure is more stable.80,81 When t < 0.8, other alternative structures may be mainly formed due to the too small A-site ions and B-site ions. When t > 1, the perovskites tend to form hexagonal structures.82 Besides, the octahedral factor μ, an experienced geometric parameter, is also applied to measure the structure stability, which is calculated as: (2)

(g) PL spectra of CsPbCl3 NCs before and after CdCl2 treatment. Adapted from ref. 63, with permission from the American Chemical Society © 2018. 
The structure usually demonstrates better stability when μ is between 0.442 and 0.895.83,84 Obviously, the partial substitution between the foreign ions and the host, induced by metal doping, can effectively adjust the values of t and μ and lead to the lattice structure changes, and further affect the overall performance.28,44,85–87
The metal doping of A sites and B sites actually has quite different effects on the structure. Usually, monovalent cations, like Rb+, Na+ and K+ ions, are chosen for A-site metal doping in CsPbX3.22,62,66,67,72 Based on formula (1), doping with these ions with a smaller ionic radius than Cs into CsPbX3 lattice may slightly reduce the tolerance factor and induce structural distortion,88 which might be not conducive to structural stability. But the slight structural distortion induced by A-site doping may improve or change the optical performance. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the incorporation of Rb+ ions into CsPbBr3 caused lattice tilting but also blue-shifted the PL peak.88 Todorović et al.'s group employed Rb+ ions into CsPbBr3 NCs to obtain blue-emitting CsPbBr3 perovskites.72 The trace Rb+ incorporation leaded to the tilting of PbX6 octahedra and thus enlarged the bandgap of CsPbBr3 into blue-emitting range. It is known that Rb possesses less electrons layers and a higher energy outer electron layer in the local crystal structure than Cs, where the electron layer structure of Cs is 1s2 2s22p6 3s23p6 4s24p63d10 5s25p64d10 and that of Rb is 1s2 2s22p6 3s23p6 4s24p63d10. Generally, the lesser electron layers reduce its attraction to adjacent ions, and the higher energy outer electron layers increase the system energy.89 Therefore, the smaller Rb+ ions cannot sustain the original [PbX6] octahedral structure, and cause the octahedron tilting and the in-plane Pb–Br–Pb bond angle changing (Fig. 3d),88–90 which further changes the orbital overlap of Pb2+ ions and halide ions and narrows both the conduction and valence bands to increase the bandgap.72,89,91 Besides, the doping of Rb+ ions also affects the electronic dimensionality of original structure and further changes the local electron density distribution to change the bandgap,89 as shown in Fig. 3e. However, the A-site-doped CsPbX3 may not maintain long-term stability, and its luminescence peak gradually red-shifts with time.89 Furthermore, the higher doping concentration would increase the tilting degree and structural instability of PbX6 octahedra, and even make it difficult to maintain the original crystal morphology.88
B-site metal doping has a more significant influence on the lattice structure because Pb2+ ions lie in the core of [PbX6] octahedra. Most bivalent or heterovalent metal ions can used for B-site doping, including Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Ce3+, Sn4+, rare earth ions and so on.1,50–52,56,57,61,63,92 Formula (1) theoretically predicts that the advantage of B-site doping with smaller metal ions is to increase the tolerance factor and further improve the stability of the lattice structure. Therefore, CsPbX3 can achieve better phase stability and excellent optoelectronic properties with the tolerance factor approaching closer to that of ideal perovskites. Besides, the doping of smaller foreign metal ions also induces lattice contraction and forms shorter metal ion–X bonds,43 followed by improved short-range order and decreased halide vacancies in the doped perovskites.47,49,50,61 For example, Mondal's group reported Cd2+ doping to prepare CsPbCl3 perovskites with an extraordinary PLQY of 98% and bright luminescence.63 After introducing the suitable and smaller Cd2+ to replace Pb2+ ions, the Cs+ ions entered a relatively small void space (Fig. 3f), leading to the less octahedral tilting and an increase in tolerance factor value. Benefitting from the positive structural optimization, the CsPbCl3 perovskites with less halide defects showed exceptional photoluminescence and a high PLQY of 96%, as shown in Fig. 3g.
4. The optimization from the metal doping
4.1. Enhancing luminescence
All the inorganic perovskites CsPbX3 have aroused great attention owing to their excellent characteristics like low cost, high photoluminescence and easy bandgap tuning, which play an important role in the optoelectronic and photovoltaic fields.3,5,7,93,94 However, CsPbX3 with different emission colors have an unbalanced development. The red and green perovskites possess ultra-high PLQY and produce efficient devices,7,93–95 while the blue and violet perovskites (X = Br/Cl, Cl) present poor optical performance and unsatisfactory stability against external fields.3,61,96,97 The major factors that seriously affect the properties of these perovskites may originate from the intrinsic defects in the lattice, which may essentially be elements lost or structural disorder induced by the fragile perovskite lattice in the process of dynamic equilibrium.18,61 The existence of defects inevitably produces more lattice disorder, and captures excitons to carry out nonradiative recombination.27,43,61 In this section, the positive affects of metal doping on the reduction and passivation of halide defects to enhance luminescence are introduced.
Yong et al. reported Ni-doped violet CsPbCl3 with near-unity PLQY, fewer intrinsic defects and short-range lattice orders (Fig. 4a).61 As shown in Fig. 4b and c, the Ni doping substantially enhanced the optical properties of CsPbCl3, like band-edge emission, PL emitting strength and average lifetime. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Pb LIII-edge in Fig. 4d and e were taken for deeply studying the possible influences induced by Ni doping. With respect to the undoped, the doped CsPbCl3 NCs showed a stronger amplitude in R space and a smaller σ2, separately suggesting an improved order of local coordination environment of Pb and an enhanced lattice order. Clearly, the undoped CsPbCl3 NCs showed more disorders and more intrinsic defects in the [PbCl6] octahedra, which were greatly suppressed by Ni doping. Samanta et al. applied Mg2+ doping on the green-emitting CsPbBr3 and violet-emitting CsPbCl3 NCs to effectively passivate the halide defects and improve the optical properties,47 as illustrated in Fig. 4f. After Mg2+ doping, both the PL intensity and PLQY of the doped were obviously enhanced, and the decay process of the doped CsPbCl3 was much slower (Fig. 4g and h). The same optimization effect can be also discovered in the Cu2+ doping process, by which Apurba and his colleagues obtained high-performance CsPbX3 perovskites in violet and blue light region.1 Based on the experimental data, the Cu2+ doping reduced the density of halide defects and rectified the disorder degree of octahedral lattice, which can be responsible for the significant improvement of PL properties, as shown in Fig. 4i.

4.2. Changing bandgap and carrier behavior
The typical band structure of lead halide perovskites is illustrated in Fig. 5a.81 The Pb (6p) orbitals interact with halide (p) orbitals to form the valence band (antibonding) and the deeper conduction band (bonding), and the interaction between Pb (6s) orbitals and halide (p) orbitals produces a deeper valence band (bonding) and a maximum antibonding of valence band. Therefore, doping with foreign metal ions, especially B-site doping, can generate new energy states to influence the bandgap and carrier behavior of perovskites.

Liu et al. discussed the relationship between metal doping and bandgap change.49 In Fig. 5b, the PL spectra indicate that the introduction of Al obviously caused the blue-shifted emission peak and the changed emission color. The VASP code was further used to study the electronic structure and density of states after Al doping. The Al s-orbital, Br p-orbital and Pb p-orbital were hybridized to introduce a new energy level state into the original band gap (Fig. 5c), and this new energy level caused the extended bandgap of the doped perovskites, which leads to the desirable blue-shifted emission.
Besides, the new energy states induced by metal doping have more obvious influences on carrier behavior.50,85,98 Yao et al. studied the carrier behavior and PL kinetics in CsPbBr3 after Ce3+ doping.50 Based on the steady-state UV–vis absorption, PL spectra and digital photos under UV irradiation (Fig. 5d), the Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 clearly showed an enhanced PL intensity with a stronger green light, indicating that the introduction of Ce3+ greatly improves its PL efficiency. Then, time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy characterization methods were applied to understand the carrier behavior before and after Ce3+ doping. On the left side of Fig. 5f and g, the two negative probe bleach (PB) peaks, named PB1 and PB2, can respectively be attributed to the ground-state bleach and the hot-exciton induced bleach, and the other two positive photoinduced absorption (PA) peaks, named PA1 and PA2, can respectively belong to the lowest excitonic state and higher-lying excitonic states. The decay-associated spectra (DAS) on the right side further analyzed the decay results, and τ1, τ2, and τ3 respectively account for the processes of intraband hot-exciton relaxation, exciton trapping to the band gap trap states, and exciton recombination. Compared with the undoped, the former two processes (τ1 and τ2,) got accelerated in the Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3, which may be influenced by the doping-induced new energy state. The photophysical processes in Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 are shown in Fig. 5e. The Ce3+ doping generated new states (marked by an asterisk) near the band-edge, causing the increased density of the lowest excitonic state, which slightly promotes the coupling between the higher-lying excitonic states and the lowest excitonic state (τ1) and the coupling between the lowest excitonic state and the band gap states (τ2).
4.3. Improving stability
Among all the inorganic perovskites, CsPbI3 has a relatively suitable light-emitting bandgap for photovoltaic and lighting devices in near-infrared field.99–101 Although the efficiency of CsPbI3-related photovoltaic devices has exceeded 20%,102,103 these materials still show serious instability under long-term storage at room temperature, which is a huge hidden danger for the realization of PSC with high efficiency and good stability. As shown in Fig. 6a, the black phase α-CsPbI3 with efficient luminescence performance can only stably exist at high temperature, and it quickly changes into yellow phase δ-CsPbI3 with a non-perovskite structure at room temperature,104–106 followed by the optical properties rapidly quenching. The fatal structural instability may originate from the fact that the smaller Cs+ ions couldn't really stabilize the PbI6 octahedral structure, causing the tolerance factor at the edge of instability.107,108 On the other hand, δ-CsPbI3 has a lower free energy and better thermodynamic stability at room temperature, which also results in the easier and more convenient transition from α-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3.109 Therefore, the key to obtaining stable CsPbI3 lies in increasing the lattice internal force, enhancing the binding force between atoms, and increasing the potential barrier of the α-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3 transition.

Behera et al. have successfully stabilized the α-CsPbI3 phase by using smaller Ni ions,29 and the obtained Ni–CsPbI3 maintained strong emission after 2 months (Fig. 6b and c). The results show that Ni ions with the smallest Shannon radius replaced Pb ions to inhibit phase transition from α-CsPbI3 to γ-CsPbI3 and minimized the octahedral tilting. Mn2+ doping has also been studied to stabilize the α-CsPbI3 structure and improve its stability.110 As shown in Fig. 6d, the doping of ∼10% Mn2+ replaced Pb2+ ions in CsPbI3 to stabilize its structure. The long-term stabilities of undoped and Mn2+-doped CsPbI3 were reflected by XRD results in Fig. 6e and f. The undoped CsPbI3 quickly transitioned to δ-CsPbI3 and completely degraded within 5 days, while the Mn2+-doped CsPbI3 did not show any obvious degradation during two weeks and still maintained the α-phase after one month. The excellent stability of Mn2+-doped CsPbI3 originated from the structural enhancements, including the slightly decreased lattice parameters and the slightly increased tolerance factor and cohesive energy.
In addition to regulating the lattice structure, metal doping can also increase the crystal formation energies to improve its stability. Yao's team successfully prepared Sr2+-doped CsPbI3 with few-nanometer-sized nanocrystals, and greatly improved its long-term stability.98 As shown in Fig. 7a, the average size of CsPbI3 changed with the doping amount and temperature, which could be attributed to the lattice contraction induced by the partial substitution of smaller Sr2+ ions for Pb2+ ions. Besides, the formation energies per unit cell (ΔEform), the energy change during the formation of quantum dots, monotonically increased as the doping amount increased (Fig. 7b). In Fig. 7c, the XRD results obviously indicated the better stability of the Sr2+-doped CsPbI3 for 60 days but the quick phase transformation of the undoped CsPbI3. Therefore, the stability of few-nanometer-sized α-CsPbI3 was proved to benefit from the increased formation energies and the decreased structure distortion induced by the incorporation of Sr2+ ions.

Recently, Jena et al. reported that the structure stability of CsPbI3 was effectively improved by the micro strain and the reduced grain size induced after Eu3+ doping.30 The XRD results of CsPbI3 with different concentrations of EuCl3 demonstrated that (200) peak gradually moved to a lower angle, which may be attributed to the lattice expansion caused by Eu3+ ions occupying octahedron intervals (Fig. 7d). The obvious split of (200) peak at higher concentrations of Eu originated from the micro strain and the formation of a micro-distorted cubic structure, which may be beneficial to improve the structure stability. Besides, the scanning electron micrographs (SEM) showed that the CsPbI3 with higher concentrations of Eu had a clearly reduced grain size and more uniform grain distribution (Fig. 7e). The structural stability of CsPbI3 was further tested by XRD in Fig. 7f. For the Eu3+-doped CsPbI3 with the micro strain and the reduced grain size presented no change in XRD peaks after 30 days, showing its better storage stability.
4.4. Adjusting the emission spectra
Most optimizations from metal doping on lead halide perovskites mainly focus on promoting their intrinsic emission, like increasing PLQY and enhancing radiation recombination.1,47,61 But recently, metal-doped perovskites with different photoluminescence color and tunable light spectra have gradually attracted great interests. In fact, the change of light spectrum originates from the characteristic emission of dopants, which can be achieved by the energy transfer between perovskites host and dopants.55,57,71,111,112 In this section, by taking Mn2+ doping and rare earth ion doping as examples, we discuss the influences of metal doping on the emission adjustment of perovskites.

4.4.1. Mn2+ doping. 
To adjust the PL emission of perovskites, the most representative doping engineering is Mn2+ doping, where the d-states of Mn2+ ions can absorb exciton energy from perovskites and emit the characteristic orange light.55,56,112–114 Parobek et al. synthesized Mn-doped CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs, and observed a dual-emission spectra of intrinsic and Mn2+ ions luminescence.113 The absorption spectra in Fig. 8a show that the main absorption peak of the host slightly changed after doping, indicating that the Mn2+ doping may influence its electronic structure. As shown in Fig. 8b, both Mn-doped CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Cl/Br)3 showed a dual-emission including intrinsic exciton luminescence and a broad orange luminescence at ∼600 nm of Mn2+ ions.

Adapted from ref. 56, with permission from the American Chemical Society © 2017. 
Liu's team further explored the relationship between the PL properties of Mn-doped CsPbCl3 and the doping amount and the temperature,56 and suggested that higher emission intensity can be achieved with a higher doping amount and a lower temperature (Fig. 8c). The characteristic emission around at 580 nm induced by Mn2+ doping changed with the reaction temperature (Fig. 8d) and the doping content (Fig. 8e), which may be due to the different energy transfer efficiency between the host and Mn2+ ions under different conditions. They also reported the emission model of Mn-doped CsPbCl3, as presented in Fig. 8f. After irradiation, CsPbCl3 absorbed energy and emitted the intrinsic emission through radiative recombination. Besides, a nonradiative relaxation process also occurred and induced the energy loss. The Mn2+ doping, providing a new recombination pathway of excitons, transferred the excitons to the excited states of Mn2+ ions to initiate recombination and finally emit orange light at 580 nm. This novel recombination pathway often occurs in the d–d states of Mn2+ ions and is called the 4T1–6A1 transition.


4.4.2. Rare earth ion doping. 
Rare earth (RE) elements consist of 15 lanthanide elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) and two lanthanide-related elements (Y and Sc), and have rich energy levels and varied valence states,115 possessing a wide range of characteristic emission from UV to infrared range.111,116–119 These unique spectral characteristics can be utilized to effectively break the original limitation of perovskite luminescence and maximize the regulation of luminescence region.
Lanthanide elements (Ln) can generate continuous photon absorption at low excitation efficiency and emit high-energy light in near-infrared range, which is often used to regulate perovskite luminescence.57,121,122 Pan's group reported that the successful doping of Ln ions into CsPbCl3 and obtained efficient, stable and tunable multi-emission perovskite NCs from visible to near-infrared region.57 As shown in Fig. 9a, the Ln-doped CsPbCl3 not only showed an intrinsic emission peak around 410 nm, but also emitted at different wavelengths with the addition of Ln elements. The appearance of new PL peaks from visible to near-infrared region proves the successful substitution of Ln ions into CsPbCl3, and also indicates the effective energy transfer between the host and Ln ions. Taking Yb3+ doping and Eu3+ doping as examples, the typical energy transfer process in Ln-doped CsPbCl3 is briefly introduced in Fig. 9b and c. After CsPbCl3 was excited, some excitons in the excited state relaxed to valence band for intrinsic luminescence (emitting at 401 nm), and the other part of excitons were trapped by defect states with transferring the energy to Yb3+, which induces the 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition emission. Then the trapped excitons also relaxed to valence band and transferred energy to another Yb3+ for luminescence. Besides, some Ln ions, like Eu3+, have complex energy band distributions, and the energy transfer in the doped perovskites often involves multiple energy states.57,123 In a typical energy transfer process, the excitation energy released from CsPbCl3 first reached the higher energy band (Fig. 9c), and then gradually transferred to the luminescence band (5D0) to emit light. In this case, a part of the energy may be inevitably consumed, so the efficiency is not as high as that of the first direct transfer.

Adapted from ref. 71, with permission from Wiley © 2017. 
It is worth noting that in Pan's work, the PLQY of Yb3+-doped perovskites reached up to 143%, and two or more Yb3+ ions participated in the energy transfer process. This particular photophysical phenomenon is called quantum cutting, where a high-energy exciton will be cut into two low-energy excitons, and the theoretical quantum yield of this process may be close to 200%, which is quite common in RE ions doping.57,120,124,125 Milstein et al. further studied the carrier behavior and energy transfer in RE-doped CsPbCl3, and emphasized the important role of shallow Yb3+-induced defects in the energy transfer process.120 Combined with a variety of experimental results, the new charge-balance “RE-VPb-RE” defects near band edge were generated in CsPbCl3 lattice when RE ions were doped, which may compete with intrinsic defects for capturing excitons during the luminescence process. After the host was excited, some excitons were trapped by intrinsic defects to generate nonradiative recombination. The other excitons were further trapped by the Yb3+-induced defects, and the energy released from this trapping process excited two Yb3+ ions through quantum cutting (Fig. 9d), followed by emitting the characteristic emission in near-infrared region. Based on the room-temperature PL-decay (Fig. 9e and f), the decay process of Yb3+–CsPbCl3 was gradually accelerated and the proportion of PL fast components also increased when the doping amount increased. This phenomenon means that the new defects introduced by Yb3+ doping may accelerate the quantum cutting process and the energy transfer between the host and Yb3+ ions.
However, the uncontrollability, uncertainty and instability of the defects in space and time may lead to an energy mismatch between different energy levels, which could not be a qualified intermediate layer for energy transfer. Recently, codoping with other RE ions and Yb3+ has been proved to effectively improve the efficiency of energy transfer.71,125 Zhou et al. presented an efficient quantum cutting process in CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 with codoping with Ce3+ and Yb3+ ions.71 As shown in Fig. 9g, the doping of RE ions caused a slight increase of bandgap and a blue shift of excitonic emission in CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, followed by the appearance of some characteristic emission peaks in near-infrared range. Besides, among all the systems, the Ce3+ and Yb3+-codoped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 possessed the highest PLQY of 146%. The dynamics of RE-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 was studied by monitoring the lifetime at different wavelengths (Fig. 9h and i). The results show that the lifetime gradually decreased in the order of undoped, Yb-doped, Er3+/Yb3+-codoped and Ce3+/Yb3+-codoped, which proves that the codoping ions obviously accelerated the energy transfer. Besides, it should be noticed that different codoped ions have different acceleration efficiencies for energy transfer, which are determined by the energy gap between the codoped ions and Yb3+ ion. The smaller energy gap between the codoped ions and Yb3+ ion can provide a more smooth energy transfer. The possible mechanism of Ce3+-assisted Yb3+ luminescence is shown in Fig. 9j. At first, the electrons were excited to the conduction band of perovskite by UV light. Then, the excitons were relaxed the 5D state of Ce3+ ion (nearly twice the energy state of Yb ion), followed by two low-energy excitons through quantum cutting being sent to the 2F7/2 state of Yb3+ for initiating radiative luminescence.
Perovskites usually exhibit excellent luminescence properties under high-energy ultraviolet irradiation, but have a poor response to low-energy light in near-infrared region with low upconversion efficiency.118,126 The relative optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices may need a high-energy source for excitation, which greatly increases the energy consumption and cost, and seriously hinders the application of these devices in practical engineering. The RE-doped NCs exhibit higher upconversion efficiency through continuous photon absorption and energy transfer, and can be easily excited by low-cost, low-energy CW diode laser.118,126,127 If the RE-doped NCs can be considered as near-infrared light absorbers to sensitizate CsPbX3 through internal energy transfer, the upconversion performance and the utilization of low-energy of CsPbX3 will be greatly improved (Fig. 10a). Zheng's group used LiYbF4:Tm3+@LiYF4 core–shell nanoplates as an energy step to sensitize CsPbX3 by using the high upconversion efficiency, continuous photon absorption and energy transfer processes of Tm and Yb.127 Under a low-power energy source excitation, different excitons were pumped into different energy levels of Tm3+via the conversion of Yb ions. The typical luminescence on Tm3+ was divided into four regions to excite CsPbX3: the peaks at 347 nm (1I6 → 3F4) and 362 nm (1D2 → 3H6) in UV area, the peaks at 450 nm (1D2 → 3F4) and 483 nm (1G4 → 3H6) in blue area, the peak at 648 nm (1G4 → 3F4) in red area and the peak at 792 nm (3H4 → 3H6) in near-infrared region (Fig. 10b). As a result, CsPbX3 with a high efficiency, adjustable lifetime, and full spectrum emission under low power density excitation were obtained.

4.5. Changing morphology
Usually, CsPbX3 prepared by traditional methods show the uniform morphology of quantum dots (QDs). But with the increasing diversification needs of specific devices, the preparation of perovskites with different morphologies and unique properties has gradually attracted great attention. Therefore, intense research activities actively focus on the morphology engineering of perovskites, generating perovskites with diverse morphology, like one-dimensional (1D) nanorods or nanowires,54,128–130 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets or nanoplates,42,52,131,132 as well as more complex morphologies.
Tang's group applied the Cu doping to design uniform CsPbCl3 nanowires by anisotropic growth along the crystal direction.54 As shown in Fig. 11a, the presence of CuCl2 induced the formation of highly crystalline CsPbCl3 nanowires with a length of ∼500 nm and a diameter of ∼20 nm. In Fig. 11b, the high-resolution TEM (HTEM) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns showed that the as-prepared nanowires presented a lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 4.0 Å, which coincides with (011) crystal plane of tetragonal crystal structures, suggesting that the growth of nanowires was directed by (011) plane. The formation of nanowires is schematically illustrated in Fig. 11c. The presence of Cu2+ ions may induce the nanocrystals to anisotropically grow along [011] direction. Therefore, the (011) crystal plane with high-energy surfaces, showing a faster growth rate than low-energy surfaces, effectively adsorbed ions to decrease its surface energy and discontinue the growth. Because of abundant Cl− ions adsorbing on the surfaces, these surfaces predominantly adsorbed RNH3+ and Cu2+ ions. Compared with RNH3+ ions, Cu2+ ions with stronger electronegativity and the ability to link two active sites are more efficient in decreasing surface energy. Thus, the surface sites occupied by RNH3+ were too few to suppress the growth of new lattice, which promotes the formation of 1D nanowires. Furthermore, these nanowires showed improved stability under ambient conditions and a 3.5-fold-increased photocurrent compared with the original nanocubes.

Quasi 2D nanosheets are also successfully synthesized by metal doping. Sheng et al. studied the Cu2+ ion doping to synthesize quasi 2D CsPbX3 nanoplates with controllable size and uniform thickness (Fig. 11d).131 Based on the results of XRD and TEM, Fig. 11e shows that the square surface and lateral surface of 2D perovskite nanoplates were {100} plane. With the increase of Cu2+ ion concentration, CsPbCl3Br3−x perovskites had gradually grown from QDs to nanoplates, and completely turned into 2D nanoplates with uniform length and thickness when the ratio of [CuCl2] to [PbBr2] was 2:1, but became very irregular fine grains with the higher ratio of [CuCl2] to [PbBr2], as shown in Fig. 11f. Bonato's group also reported that the Sn4+ doping effectively changed the ligand content and finally promoted the nanosheet formation, as shown in Fig. 12a.52 In the ordinary synthesis process, OA usually protonate OAm to oleylammonium (OLA+) and coordinate with perovskites. But Sn4+ ions formed complexes with OAm, then promoted the formation of OA, which in turn, also promoted protonation and the generation of OLA+, as illustrated in Fig. 12b and c. In the process of crystal growth, OLA+ tends to compete with Cs+, occupies A sites to reduce surface energy and affect the morphology. Therefore, in the presence of Sn4+, a higher ratio of OLA+/Cs+ restrained the growth of {00l} direction, and the orthogonal planes {h00} and {0k0} with higher surface energy grew faster, which boosts the formation of 2D nanosheets (Fig. 12d).

(f) Atomic models of cubes and platelets with different Sb intakes. (g) The charge imbalance and crystal growth after Sb3+ doping. Adapted from ref. 42, with permission from the American Chemical Society © 2019. 
In addition to influencing the behavior of ligands, metal doping can also change the morphology by adjusting the charge balance. Bera et al. reported the synthesis of platelet-shaped α-CsPbI3 with 20% Sb (w.r.t. Pb),42 as shown in Fig. 12e. The atomic models present the morphological changes of CsPbI3 with different concentrations of Sb (Fig. 12f). CsPbI3 mainly formed into cube structures when Sb(III) was 25% with respect to Pb in the reaction mixture, while platelets structures were mainly obtained with more Sb(III). The authors assumed that the replacement of Pb2+ ions with Sb3+ ions led to a charge imbalance. Hence, to ensure the charge balance, three Pb2+ atoms were replaced by two Sb3+ ions with a similar ns2 configuration, which leads to the transformation of 3D CsPbI3 to 2D nanoplates (Fig. 12g).
5. Optimization on devices
The outstanding PL properties, such as strong emission, high PLQY, long electron diffusion length, and electron lifetime, make CsPbX3 possible to become a potential candidate for the next generation efficient optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.2,6–8,133 However, compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite devices, the practical applications of CsPbX3 seem quite scarce with insufficient research, which mainly originates from its relatively low efficiency and poor stability. The efficiency of devices is closely related to the quality of materials, which means that a necessary premise of efficient and stable devices is based on high-quality materials. We have already discussed that metal doping has produced excellent optimizations on the comprehensive capacities of perovskites. Therefore, in this section, we further focus on the influences of metal doping on optoelectronic devices, like PSC and LED. Tables 1 and 2 separately summarize the properties of PSC and LED with metal doping in recent years.

5.1. Metal-doped perovskites in PSC
CsPbI3 with a narrow bandgap are considered as a suitable light harvest for PSC,99–101 but the serious phase transition still inhibits its further developments. Shi et al. prepared Yb-doped CsPbI3 with enhanced structural stability, and applied the optimized CsPbI3 on PSC by adopting a device structure of glass/fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO)/TiO2/CsPbI3/PTB7/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 13a.134 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSC based on Yb-doped CsPbI3 showed significant increments after Yb doping (Fig. 13b). The PSC based on 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 had the best optical performance with a Voc of 1.25 V, a Jsc of 14.30 mA cm−2, a fair fill factor (FF) of 0.74, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.12%. The ambient storage stability also showed improvements under Yb doping, as shown in Fig. 13c. Hu's group also doped Bi ions into CsPbI3 to increase its tolerance factor (from 0.81 to 0.84), resulting in better stability and excellent optical properties.135 When the doping amount of Bi was 4 mol%, the PSC showed the best performance and achieved a PCE of 13.21%. At 25 °C and a relative humidity of 55%. Besides, the uncoated solar cells still maintained significant stability for 168 h and maintained 68% of initial PCE. Moreover, the PSC based on the Ni2+-doped CsPbI3 also presented an increased photoconversion efficiency of 9.1% and a short-circuit current density of 13.11 mA cm−2, compared with the undoped (8.2% and 11.83 mA cm−2), which may be mainly attributed to the enhanced stability of CsPbI3.29

In addition to improving the stability of materials, metal doping also influences their light absorption to optimize the devices. Murugadoss's group investigated the photovoltaic performance of PSC based on CsPbI3 with doping different metal ions like Sn, In, Cu and Ag,133 using the structure of glass/FTO/bl-TiO2/perovskites/CuSCN/Au (Fig. 13d). They discovered that only the Sn-doped CsPbI3 with  an enlarged absorption range could guarantee the black phase with stable luminescence properties (Fig. 13e). The best PSC was successfully observed at a Sn concentration of 0.25 g, demonstrating a decent short-circuit photocurrent density of 10.05 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.85%, and a PCE of 5.12%. Besides, the PSC based on Sn-doped CsPbI3 retained about 94% of its initial performance after continuous operation for 250 h under 1 sunlight irradiation, proving its remarkable stability.
5.2. Metal-doped perovskites in LED
In addition to PSC, the metal-doped perovskites with excellent optical properties are also ideal light-emitting layers for LED. Shen and his team reported Zn2+-alloyed CsPbI3 for preparing red LED.23 The partial substitution of smaller Zn2+ for Pb2+ increased tolerance factor and radiative decay rate, showing enhanced stability and PL properties. This red-emitting perovskits LED had a structure with ITO/ZnO/PEI/perovskites/TCTA/MoO3/Au (Fig. 14a), presenting a lower turn-on voltage (2.1 V), a maximum luminance of 2202 cd m−2 and a peak EQE of 15.1% (Fig. 14b).

Metal doping also promotes the developments of LED emitting lights with different color. Hoang et al. used K+-doped CsPbBr3 as an active light-emitting layer of a green LED.22 The K+ ion doping effectively adjusted the bandgap of CsPbBr3 to match with the hole transport layer and electron transport layer (Fig. 14c), which greatly ensures efficient hole injection. With a saturated K+ content of 2.5%, the green LED demonstrated strong EL emission (Fig. 14d) with a peak luminance of 5760 cd m−2 and an increased EQE of 5.6%. Mn-doped CsPbBr3 with lattice contraction and a higher formation energy was also used to prepare an efficient green LED,114 presenting a better EQE of 1.49% and a luminance of 9971 cd m−2 compared with the undoped. Yao et al. demonstrated that the Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 was acted as an efficient emitting layer in green LED,50 due to the PL improvements and easy charge injection after Ce3+ doping. The green LED based on Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 showed an increased EQE of 4.4%. As for blue LED, Hou et al. manufactured an efficient mixed halide CsPb(Cl/Br)3 blue LED with Mn2+ doping, based on a structure of ITO/PeDOT:PSS/TFB/PFI/perovskites/TPBi/LiF/Al.8 As shown in Fig. 14e and f, the LED obviously presented pure and bright blue emission without any Mn emission, and an increased luminance at all doping concentrations. This LED demonstrated a maximum luminance of 389 cd m−2 and an EQE of 2.12%. Petar's team incorporated Rb+ ions into CsPbBr3 NCs to prepare blue LED. The Rb+ doping increased the bandgap of CsPbBr3 and blue-shifted the emission peak.72 The LED had a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/perovskites/TPBi/LiF/Al, showing a peak luminance of 63 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.11% in deep blue region (468 nm) and a peak luminance of 183 cd m−2 and EQE of 0.69% in sky blue region (490 nm).
6. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we concluded the latest advances in the synthesis, optical properties, and applications of metal-doped CsPbX3. Especially, the significant influences on structure, optical properties, morphology, carrier behavior, and relative optoelectronic devices induced by metal doping are mainly discussed. By means of effective synthesis methods, alkali metal ions, RE ions, and transition metal ions can successfully be doped into perovskite structures, and further affect its crystal structures and optical properties. Obviously, metal-doped CsPbX3 has achieved excellent performance with high PL intensity, long-term stability and wide applications in PSC and LED. However, metal-doped CsPbX3 still faces some scientific problems and challenges, which need further research and solutions in the future.
Many reports aim to improve the properties of CsPbX3 by introducing foreign metal ions into the host lattice. However, it remains unclear whether these foreign metal ions are exactly doped into the lattice or just located at the surface, and whether they have different effects on improving performance. Deeper explorations in this field are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanism of metal doping.
Besides, the fatal ion migration is a key factor for weakening the performance and long-term stability of perovskites and their LED devices, especially in blue light range. But the great improvements induced by metal doping mainly focus on improving the structural stability and PL performance of perovskites, but lack intense researches on suppressing ion migration. More efforts should be taken on this aspect to achieve excellent and stable CsPbX3 and LED devices.
Moreover, metal doping can reduce the content of toxic Pb  in perovskites, which provides a feasible way to prepare green and environmentally friendly materials with less lead or lead-free. Also, compared with bulk materials, lower-dimensional perovskites with unique properties and quantum confinement effects, like 1D and 2D NCs, are gradually becoming popular materials for PSC and LED. Therefore, using metal doping method to prepare low-dimensional materials obtained can be another frontier work in the future.
