    , Accepted 19th October 2022First published on 20th October 2022AbstractA wound is defined as damage to the integrity of biological tissue, including skin, mucous membranes, and organ tissues. The treatment of these injuries is an important challenge for medical researchers. Various materials have been used for wound healing and dressing applications among which carbon nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable properties. In the present review, the latest studies on the application of carbon nanomaterials including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon dots (CDs), carbon quantum dots (CQDs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and nanodiamonds (NDs) in wound dressing applications are evaluated. Also, a variety of carbon-based nanocomposites with advantages such as biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, reduced wound healing time, antibacterial properties, cell-adhesion, enhanced mechanical properties, and enhanced permeability to oxygen has been reported for the treatment of various wounds.
1. Introduction
Wounds can be defined as injuries and changes in the function of the normal anatomical structure.1 They can result from a simple break in the epithelial integrity of the skin or can be deeper, extending into subcutaneous tissue with damage to other structures such as tendons, muscles, vessels, nerves, parenchymal organs, and even bones.2,3 Pathological processes that start from the outside or inside of the involved organs cause wounds.2,4 Mostly, wounds are caused by accidental or intentional etiology or as a result of disease processes. However, regardless of their cause and shape, wounds damage tissue and disrupt the local environment inside them.5 Accordingly, 2–3% of the total expenditure on healthcare annually is associated with wound care. Wound healing is one of the essential treatments in the human body.6 Generally, the wound healing process can be divided into four temporary overlapping processes including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling.7 Hemostasis is the first stage occurring immediately after skin injury. Subsequently, the repair process undergoes the inflammatory stage to prevent the wound from being infected and accelerates the wound healing process.8 Next, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress due to high inflammation around the wound occur, which help protect the wound from infection.8 Various materials employed as wound dressings include hydrogels, hydrocolloids, non-adherent films, foams, hydrofibers, emollients, antimicrobials, charcoal, and composite dressings.9 Several nanomaterials have antimicrobial activity combined with wound regeneration features, endowing them promising applicability to treat a variety of wound types. The application of nanomaterials, particularly nanoparticles, in wound healing and infection prevention has increased remarkably over the past 2 decades. Recently, the combination of NPs with scaffolds for wound healing as a targeted approach for the preparation of advanced dressings has gained significant attention.10 One of the most important nanomaterials is carbon. There are several types of carbon nanomaterials, including GO, rGO, CDs, CQDs, CNTs, CNFs, and NDs.11,12
Recently, it has been demonstrated that issues associated with wound care, such as tissue repair, scarless healing, and loss of tissue integrity, can be overcome using carbon nanomaterials.13 Furthermore, efficient wound management is essential, where carbon nanostructures are effective in various processes of wound healing including inflammation, proliferation, fibroblast migration, angiogenesis, and adhesion.2,6,14 In general, bacterial infection can cause wounds to become chronically inflamed, which will become chronic or nonhealing if no effective treatment strategies are applied. In addition to the process of long-term wound healing due to bacterial infection, it has been reported that about 75% of deaths due to burn injuries are due to infection. Therefore, the timely use of effective antibacterial agents to improve wound healing is of great importance.15 Carbon-based nanomaterials have good antimicrobial properties, and also act as antibacterial agents, which are involved in the four wound healing phases and can deliver antibiotics, growth factors, antioxidants and stem cells. These materials are used in tissue engineering, targeted drug delivery, and skin care due to their physicochemical properties and wide diversity. In addition to the hydrophobic nature of carbon nanomaterials, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for their inherent antimicrobial activity.16 In the wound-healing process, electrically conductive composites of CNTs and non-conductive polymeric materials have been used effectively. Therefore, the development of new antibacterial agents is still a hot research topic.6,17–19 Micro/nanocarbon functional materials that can be used as carriers and antibacterial agents in the field of antibacterial dressings have attracted attention from medical staff and researchers. Because these micro/nanocarbons have many advantages including raw materials, low preparation cost, good mechanical stability, strong biocompatibility, biodegradability and antibacterial activity. At present, the antibacterial strategies using micro/nanocarbon functional materials include the combination of antibacterial metal nanoparticles and antibacterial polymer composite materials, which increase the structural stability of wound dressings, improve the photothermal antibacterial performance, etc.9 In this review, we concisely discuss carbon-based nanomaterials and their antibacterial and wound healing applications.
2. Biological properties and wound dressing applications of carbon-based nanostructures
A wound dressing is a bandage used to cover a wound and help it heal by attaching it to the surrounding cellular tissue or bandaging the wound. This can be in the form of hydrogels20–25 foam,26etc. The use of materials that are biocompatible and non-toxic to living cells, together with the ability to reduce the wound healing time, has been considered by many researchers.27 In numerous studies, various materials, especially nanomaterials, e.g., carbon-based nanostructures such as GO, rGO, CDs, CQDs, CNTs, CNFs, and NDs, because of their unique properties, have been used to synthesize appropriate wound dressings to control and heal wounds.28 The important properties that wound dressings should possess include antibacterial activity, cell adhesion, non-cytotoxicity, anti-hemolytic activity, mechanical properties, and permeability to oxygen, while having high absorption capacity and the ability maintain the humidity of the environment under the dressing29 (Fig. 1). One of the most important things after a wound has formed is the prevention of infection and the entry of bacteria and viruses in the wound. In this regard, various materials such as hydrogels, materials with carbon structures and metal oxide nanoparticles with antibacterial properties have been used to synthesize appropriate wound dressings to prevent and control wound infection. For this purpose, composites such as chitosan@polyvinyl alcohol@GO (CS@PVA@GO)30 and chitosan-graft poly(amidoamine) dendrimer-CDs/loaded NO with the formation of N-diazeniumdiolate (CPA-CDs/NONOate)31 have been synthesized, which due to the presence of GO and CDs in their structure, in addition to creating other traits, endows them with strong antibacterial properties. Another important feature in wound healing is the use of a bandage that after application to the wound site, has the property of cell adhesion to assist the rapid migration and proliferation of cells to heal the wound as quickly as possible. According to recent studies, cell adhesion and culture are highly associated with the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the scaffold surface.32 It has been reported that multi-walled CNT/chitosan (MWCNT/CHI) scaffolds, which possess carbon-nanotubes in their structure, in addition to enhancing cell adhesion, are suitable as an artificial substrate for the formation of artificial bone due to the similarity of CNTs to particular biological structures.33 When a wound dressing is used on a wound, its components should neither cause toxicity to the healthy cells around the wound nor destroy or damage them. Therefore, another point that should be considered in the synthesis of wound dressings is the use of substances that are also compatible with healthy cells. The results of some studies have shown that in synthesized nanocomposites, the fusion of hydrophobic CNFs and hydrophilic GO is non-cytotoxic to HaCaT human keratinocytes, increases the physical and antibacterial properties,34 and the MWCNTs present in the composite structure show property of non-cytotoxicity.35 Wounds do not occur only on the skin of the body. Sometimes wounds occur inside the body, causing the internal components of the body to be damaged. Therefore, to increase the use of wound dressings with different applications, materials that can be used inside the body for healing wounds are necessary. As mentioned earlier, it is important that other cells are not harmed during wound treatment. Red blood cells circulate throughout the body, and thus it is very important and vital for them to remain healthy and not damaged while using the intended wound dressing. Accordingly, after synthesizing and making a wound dressing, a hemolysis test should be performed to evaluate the amount of damage to red blood cells. Naturally, structures that can be used without damaging red blood cells or cause minimal damage to them are necessary to avoid problems in the normal conditions of the body.
 Fig. 1  Schematic explanation of the wound healing process in different tissues. 
The toxicity of carbon nanomaterials has been widely studied, although more investigations are necessary to determine their long-term effects on living organisms.36–38 The toxicity of carbon nanomaterials depends on various factors such as their size, length, shape, structure, surface area, active groups on their surface, solubility, surface charge, metal impurities and the type of target cells.37,39 For example, the small size of carbon nanoparticles increases their passage through the cell membrane and increases their toxicity. Also, it leads to an increase in their surface area and their surface interactions with the biological environment. In general, nanomaterials exist in different forms, including particles, tubes, fibers, spheres, rods, cubes, truncated triangles, wires, and films, which have an effect on their kinetics and transport in the biological environment.39 Toxicity can be caused by ROS, cell autophagy and lysosomal membrane damage, pyroptosis, apoptosis associated with the mitochondrial pathway and scavenger receptors, necrosis, etc.37 Nowadays, the toxicity of carbon nanomaterials can be controlled by using techniques such as functionalization and introduction of carbon nanomaterials in biocompatible composites.17,40
The toxicity and effects of carbon nanomaterials on living systems can be evaluated from another point of view. Although carbon nanomaterials are clearly targeted at wound healing in a localized part of the body, there is still the possibility that they can enter the vasculature.41,42 Alternatively, nanomaterials have a tendency to accumulate in organs in the body in the long term and gradually get destroyed and removed from the body. Generally, nanomaterials with a size less than 5 nm can be eliminated from the blood via renal clearance, while that with a size of 10–20 nm through quick hepatic diffusion.43,44 Nanomaterials with a size in the range of 20 to 200 nm can remain in circulation for a long time, while that larger than 200 nm are filtered in the sinusoids of the spleen and recognized and removed by tissue macrophages.43,44
Mechanical properties and the ability to absorb excessive wound secretions, while maintaining adequate moisture and oxygenation are other important properties of wound dressings. Mechanical properties and moisture retention are required for the wound dressing to have suitable elasticity for use on wounds and for it to be folded when used without drying. Also, according to studies, the wound healing process is faster in a zhumid environment than a dry environment. Carbon-based nanoparticles such as rGO and GO, which are present in composites such as palladium/polypyrrole/two-dimensional rGO (Pd/PPy/rGO) and polyurethane/poly(2-acryloylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)-GO nanofibrous (PU/P (AMPS-GO)) nanocomposites, have been developed, improving the wound dressing properties. This can be ascribed to the effect of GO content on the morphology, mechanical roperties and water vapor permeability of composites.45,46
Carbon nanomaterials can be useful in the wound healing process through various mechanisms. Carbon-based nanocomposites can improve cell proliferation and adhesion and increase tissue growth.47 Also, they increase tissue regeneration by improving the hydrophilicity and surface roughness.47 The antibacterial property reported for carbon nanomaterials is also an important feature that can be useful in the wound healing process. Carbon nanomaterials can induce an antibacterial effect through various mechanisms, including physical/mechanical destruction, oxidative stress, photothermal effect, photocatalytic effect, lipid extraction effect and inhibition of bacterial metabolism.48 With further investigation, this antibacterial property can become comparable with other antibacterial nanomaterials.49
2.1. Graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide
GO is a two-dimensional material with a hexagonal and crystalline structure, which is made of a layer of oxygen on its sheets. The presence of oxygen bands allows this material to interact better with other materials and the bonding of its sheets to polymers or other materials through covalent bonds. Also, rGO is a reduced form of GO.50 The extraordinary mechanical,51 electrical and thermal properties,52 aqueous processability,53 amphiphilicity,53 fluorescence quenching ability,53 surface functionalizability,53 surface-enhanced Raman scattering,53 extreme chemical stability,17 antibacterial activity, non-cytotoxicity and biocompatibility54 of these elements have attracted significant attention in applications such as solar cells, energy storage, catalysis, and medical uses55 including the fabrication of wound dressings28 (Fig. 2).

An ideal wound dressing should have multifunctional attributes to satisfy diverse pathological conditions. Adhesion, shape retention and excellent mechanical properties can give it the ability to stabilize the wound structure during the healing process.29 In this regard, a nanocomposite based on a hydrogel composed of polydopamine (PDA), Ag and GO (PDA@Ag5GO1) was synthesized as a wound dressing for healing skin wounds in 15 days (Fig. 3). The presence of GO, in addition to supporting the silver antibacterial nanoparticles, could reduce the accumulation and improve the diffusion of silver. It also has diverse oxidizing functional groups and a large specific surface area with excellent NIR (near-infrared) absorption and photothermal conversion, which can impart desirable mechanical properties to the bandage and enable researchers to select it as an element that primarily responds to the contraction of synthesized hydrogels, and also improves their properties.56 Han et al. studied a dopamine-grafted gelatin/GO (GelDA/GO) composite, among its other functions, as a wound dressing, in which the GO enhanced the cross-linking density of the hydrogel, thus increasing the mechanical strength of the composite (Fig. 4). The hydrogel was also endowed with conductivity after combination with GO nanosheets, which could be used as a self-adhesive electrode, making it a multi-purpose wound dressing. Furthermore, the GelDA hydrogel demonstrated inherent self-healing ability, excellent cell compatibility, good adhesion to the surface of various materials, and good hemostatic function in vivo.57 Nitric oxide (NO) is an antimicrobial agent that has the ability to regenerate tissues. However, it exhibits the disadvantages of short half-life and difficult storage. Thus, to overcome these limitations, a new type of hydrogel-forming microneedle (HFMN) was developed, which was combined with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels (extremely biocompatible drug carriers), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (NO-releasing agent) and GO (to increase mechanical strength and photothermal effect) (GO-GNSO-HFMNs), for releasing NO directly into the wound upon exposure to gentle infrared radiation, inhibiting bacterial growth, increasing tissue regeneration and healing the wound in 9 days.58

In another study, chitosan/GO/tannic acid sponges (by double crosslinking chitosan sponge) were synthesized as elastic, biodegradable wound dressings with antibacterial and hemostatic properties. They exhibited a rapid hemostatic effect on a rat liver injury model and full-thickness skin wound, resulting in healing in 14 days. CS and GO were covalently bonded by EDC/NHS to form a complex, and then TA was introduced as a secondary binding agent after removal of chitosan acidity., which was stable in aqueous solution. CS has unique biological properties, and GO (produced by a modified Hummers’ method as the first crosslink) improved the hydrophilicity, cytocompatibility, blood compatibility, mechanical and hemostatic properties. TA was added to the structure to increase the hemostatic and antioxidant properties.59 Prakash et al. reported the synthesis of cellulose/GO/TiO2/curcumin nanofibers, where GO synthesized via the Hummers’ method endowed them with properties such as antibacterial, non-cytotoxicity, high water and exudate absorption, biodegradability, cytocompatibility, and excellent mechanical properties. Also, curcumin, cellulose and TiO2 imparted properties such as reducing inflammation and enhancing cell proliferation, resembling the extracellular matrix of the skin and having high porosity and permeability, and helping in eradicating microbial inversion, respectively, to these nanofibers.31 The study by Ciftci et al. aimed at demonstrating the antibacterial effects of clarithromycin release from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibers incorporated with selenium (Se) and GO to heal diabetic wounds. PLA has the property of renewability and biodegradability, while Se has novel antibiotic chemistry and antioxidant-anti-inflammatory effects, which have a positive effect on diabetes. Clarithromycin has antimicrobial activity. GO (synthesized by Hummers’ method) had a smoothing effect on the PLA fibers, leading to a bead-free morphology. Also, its presence provided a good backbone for combining other functional factors and endowed the nanofiber with good strength. The appropriate dosing with Se improved the cell migration and adhesion. has Additionally, the fibers exhibited a high drug loading capacity, chemical stability and low cytotoxicity.60 In another report, polyvinyl alcohol with an increasing loading of GO and aspirin-adsorbed GO were wet-spun into continuous composite fibers and introduced as wound dressings and wound sutures. The crystalline nature of the GO liquid improved the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties and increased the length of the composite fibers. The use of GO endowed the composite with antimicrobial properties and high loading ability. Aspirin absorption in GO occurs by electronic interactions and the slow release of aspirin, which was studied over a 3-day period, is attributed to the π–π interaction between GO and aspirin. In this composite, the aspirin release time was controlled by changing the GO content. It should be noted that the addition of GO to the composite made it 5-times stronger than PVA alone.61 Xia Li et al. examined an Ag–ZnO@carboxymethyl cellulose/K-carrageenan/GO/konjac glucomannan hydrogel (Ag–ZnO@CGK) as a wound dressing for the treatment of diabetic ulcers in 21 days. The use of GO in the composite structure was to increase its mechanical properties (combination of GO with polymers, due to its hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl functional groups improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel) and biocompatibility. GO can also support cell distinction, growth and adhesion with little or non-cytotoxic effects. The use of ZnO together with Ag increased the antibacterial properties, and the presence of the CGK hydrogel (due to its 3D system and permeable and inflatable structure in fluid media) was used to provide a framework for cell compatibility and drug accumulation.62 In one investigation, researchers synthesized a pH-sensitive dressing with bacterial cellulose-functionalized GO (BC-f-GO), which was crosslinked by TEOS and PVA, and curcumin to treat skin wounds. Bacterial nanocellulose is a biopolymer and polysaccharide that, in addition to having long-term drug delivery properties, can retain biofluid. Curcumin, which is commonly used for the treatment of third-degree burns, was used in this to prevent infection of skin wounds and burns. GO increased the mechanical, hydrophilic and antibacterial properties of the wound dressing. It was found that by increasing the content of GO, anti-cancer activity was exhibited against the U87 cell line.63
Preventing wound infection is one of the first steps in wound healing. Thus, an ideal wound dressing should have antibacterial properties. In this regard, (Cu, N-CDs@GO-CS) hydrogel nanoplatforms were prepared by the covalent bonding of Cu, N-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) with GO nanosheets, which were added to chitosan (CS) hydrogels. Afterwards, they were used for the rapid, low-cost and complete treatment of a bacterial skin wound in 14 days. The CS hydrogels degraded the bacterial cell membranes through electrostatic adsorption. Copper has near-infrared (NIR) adsorption, and thus with the doping of CDs by the N–Cu–N bond coordination mode in the presence of NIR, the CDs could produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat, which kill bacteria. GO nanosheets were loaded with CDs due to their excellent thermal/chemical stability in the NIR region, as well as their high specific surface area, which creates a more pronounced antibacterial synergistic effect.64 The obvious advantage of antibacterial wound dressings is to prevent the overuse of antibiotics and drug resistance. In this regard, Ren et al. evaluated an injectable hyaluronic acid hydrogel with antibacterial, antioxidant and photothermal therapy activity (hydrogel was made by loading GO in a natural polymer network consisting of hyaluronic acid grafted with tyramine (HT) and gelatin grafted with gallic acid (GGA) (HT/GGA/GO)) as a functional dressing for an experimental infectious wound model in 14 days (Fig. 5). HA is a ubiquitous polysaccharide in the body and vital for cellular and tissue functions, and the addition of HT results in excellent stability in vitro and in the body. GGA exhibits antioxidant power and an effective increase in tissue regeneration. GO improved the biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, and antioxidant capacity, created conductivity and increased the swelling ratio in the hydrogel. Increasing the amount of GO increased the antibacterial efficacy against E. coli and S. aureus. Also, the photothermal conversion efficiency depends on the GO ratio, which effectively prevents early infection and accelerates wound healing.65 Zhang et al. reported a green strategy for the in situ biomimetic synthesis of silver nanoparticle@organic framework/GO (Ag@MOF–GO) in sericin/chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel as an antibacterial wound dressing to control wound infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. The presence of GO enhanced the synergistic effects and ameliorated the antibacterial activity compared to the main components. Its biocompatibility is mainly affected by its high surface area and hydrophilicity. Using GO, the amount of Ag@MOF could be effectively reduced without affecting the performance of the hydrogel. Also, the creation of large cavities had a positive effect on the properties of the nanocomposite and increased the diffusion of silver in Ag@MOF-GO in contact with bacteria, and the good antibacterial activity of GO caused the bacterial cells to undergo severe morphological damage. It is known that water retention provides a moister environment for wounds and heals the wound. For this purpose, the CS/SS moisture retention properties increased with the addition of Ag@MOF and GO. This hydrogel worked well as a wound dressing and also had cell adhesion and migration properties and rapid blood coagulation on skin wounds, and the wound was repaired 95% in 14 days.66 In another report, a new cationic polymer, poly(2-(tert-butylaminoethyl) methacrylate) (PTA), was grafted on the surface of GO (synthesized by Hummers’ method) to increase the antimicrobial efficacy of the latter against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In this study, GO-g-PTA powders were successfully synthesized through free radical polymerization (GO-g-PTA-F) and the potential applications of PVA/GO-g-PTA-F composite nanofiber mats for chronic wound care was evaluated for a period of 10 days, which showed strong and long-lasting antimicrobial ability and non-cytotoxicity. The PVA/GO-g-PTA-A composite nanofiber mats showed increased antimicrobial ability against S. aureus in the same percentage of filler volume compared to other studied composite nanofiber mats.67 Chen et al. developed a new type of promising wound dressing by combining polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG)-modified GO (mGO) with the poly(vinyl alcohol)/chitosan (PVA/CS) matrix. GO has good antibacterial properties, which were further improved with the introduction of PHMG, and it also improved the mechanical properties of the composite dressing. In this work, mGO was synthesized by the covalent bonding of PHMG to the surface of GO sheets. In addition, CS is a natural analgesic and hemostatic biomaterial, and PVA is a water-soluble synthetic polymer with exceptional biocompatibility. This dressing healed skin wounds in 9 days. The homogeneous dispersion of mGO in the PVA/CS matrix increased the interaction of PVA and CS and made the structure more orderly, which resulted in improved mechanical properties, good water vapor transfer rate (WVTR), less swelling time and the ability to rapidly absorb exudates, which could provide a humid environment for wound healing.68 As mentioned, sores can occur inside the body. Accordingly, in a study inspired by the antibacterial activity of GO with polycaprolactone (PCL) (to enhance the GO patch), a wound dressing capable of killing bacteria and rescuing cells in the treatment of an open abdomen (OA) wound combined with an intestinal fistula was presented. This patch was sutured and studied on the muscle for 7 days. There was no additional damage and no signs of functional dysfunction in the limb, indicating its non-toxic properties to healthy cells. GO can also reduce the level of inflammation in the gut, which is due to the killing of bacteria and the preservation of cells. However, the GO patch cannot be used alone because the suture needle can cut it and damage its structure, and thus it must be reinforced with other materials such as PCL.69 Liang et al. provided an injectable adhesive hemostatic antioxidant conductive photothermal antibacterial hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid-graft-dopamine (HA-DA) and rGO using an H2O2/HPR (horseradish peroxidase) system as a wound dressing. HA-DA/rGO3/Doxy healed a full-thickness skin wound in 14 days and continuously released drugs to heal the wound. Herein, catechol increased the hemostatic properties, HA enhanced the cell migration, DA elevated the adhesion and reduced GO to rGO, and rGO made the dressing conductive and antibacterial and improved its biocompatibility and mechanical properties. Injectable hydrogels, similar to the extracellular matrix, can bind isolated tissues and also act as a hemostat or sealant to stop bleeding and prevent fluid or gas leakage and protect against infection, which accelerates wound healing.70 After controlling the infection, controlling inflammation and cell proliferation is critical to wound healing. The human skin has a natural internal “battery”, which generates a small electrical current during injury, and wound healing stops when the current is disrupted. In this regard, Tu et al. synthesized a GO-polydopamine/F127-EPL (GDFE) hydrogel, in which GO, due to its excellent electrical conductivity, could stimulate macrophages, which regenerate tissue and promote angiogenesis, and thus play a pivotal role in skin and muscle regeneration. GO has also been reported to be able to interact with growth factors and other proteins through covalent, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding with its abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, which can affect the cellular response and enhance cell differentiation. The synthesized hydrogel was liquid at 4 °C, whereas a gel at 37 °C, which indicates its excellent injectability and self-healing. It could heal a diabetic wound in 21 days.71

Montazeri et al. synthesized a nanocomposite chitosan (CS)–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) scaffold reinforced with GO, which, due to its physical barrier properties and high thermal stability, prevented the scaffold from decomposing with an increase in temperature and changes under body conditions by creating high strength. Also, when combined with chitosan polymer, due to the structure of its interconnected pores and uneven surface, it ensured a suitable culture medium to guide cell adhesion, tissue proliferation and growth and adequate nutrient flow into the cell, which ultimately eliminated cell weakness, improved the cellular response and accelerated the wound healing process. The wound was examined and completely healed within 20 days. The extent of inflammation and the area of the wound were less in the scaffold containing GO than in the sample including the pure polymer scaffold. The high biocompatibility of GO can also be attributed to its functional groups, and PVA and CS also developed properties such as flexibility and antibacterial properties and degradability and the ability to absorb secretions, which were improved by GO.72 In one study, GO was added to improve the antibacterial, mechanical, and incomplete biocompatibility properties of electrospun polyurethane (PU). The structure of the PU/GO wound dressing was porous with a closed fiber diameter, which depended on the amount of GO added. Also, the swelling properties (due to the reduction in the fiber diameter and the creation of a porous structure) and the appropriate hydrophilicity created in the wound dressing were related to the amount of GO. The hydrophilic groups in GO accelerated the fluid uptake in the polymer network and improved the hydrophilicity of the wound-coating surface and cellular responses such as adhesion, proliferation, and cell differentiation. Finally, the GO particles not only enhanced the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the PU wound dressing, but also improved the viability of human skin fibroblast cells.73 In recent years, dispersed graphene nanocomposites have become popular as wound dressings due to their superior physicochemical and biological properties. In one study, the synthesis of fibroin/GO fibers was reported. Fibroin has various properties such as biochemical compatibility. The functional groups in GO also make it a strong substrate for interaction with cells and biological molecules. GO interacts with fibroin chains through electrostatic interactions. Thus, the addition of GO (synthesized by Hummers’ method) with the optimal value of 0.016% w/w created or improved many properties. The creation of strong antibacterial properties can be attributed to two reasons, i.e., the penetration of the sharp edges of GO into the bacterial membrane and the production of reactive oxygen samples. After the addition of GO, the surface hydrophilicity improved, which occurs due to the reduction of the contact angle. GO is a semiconductor and reduces the resulting fiber diameter, therefore providing a higher specific surface area for protein adsorption, which is the reason for the presence of more cell adhesion sites. The intact fibers are relatively smooth and the addition of GO made their surface rougher. This surface roughness plays an important role in improving the cell–substrate interactions and makes the wound dressing more suitable for cell proliferation. In addition, the presence of GO increased the average pore area, which promoted the water swelling, cell adhesion, and WVTR. This wound dressing not only could be used to prevent the formation of bacterial colonies on the wound, but also to regenerate infectious wounds.74 Zhang et al. introduced a quaternized chitosan-cyclodextrin-adamantane/GO (QCS-CDs-AD/GO) supramolecular hydrogel as a self-healing injectable wound dressing through the host–guest interaction between CDs and AD with the combined unique benefits of GO and QCS, which healed the wound in 14 days so that even the hair on the skin grew. In this study, aspects such as the component values and reduction of GO to rGO were among the variables used to assess the improvement in the work process. QCS-CDs-AD/GO4 (0.4 wt% of rGO in the sample) was reported as the best case in the presence of NIR (due to the high GO-CD photoreceptor response), where the inclusion of rGO as a conductive component in hydrogel sealing accelerated the adhesion, proliferation and cell migration. Also, the antibacterial properties of the hydrogel increased within 2 h of contact with 3 different types of bacteria at a temperature of 37 °C, leading to their death. The presence of rGO promoted the effective absorption of wound secretions and the soft physical property allowed the hydrogel to be effectively filled in irregular wound areas using syringes. According to the emphasis in this study, the conductive component is useful for promoting epidermal regeneration.75 Aycan et al. introduced sodium alginate/gelatin/hyaluronic acid/rGO (SAlg/Gel/HA/rGO) electroconductive polymeric films as wound dressings with an anti-inflammatory-analgesic effect (due to the presence of ibuprofen) for the treatment of skin wounds. The integration of rGO in the polymer network created significant advantages. It improved the mechanical properties through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding between the functional groups and the polymer network (strong interfacial bonds). Also, the enhanced elongation of the film can be attributed to the presence of rGO. The polymer network increased the oxygen permeability by providing a suitable space. Its electrostatic properties and the creation of a moist wound healing environment enabled better cell attachment and proliferation. In addition, SAlg is a non-toxic and degradable polysaccharide, HA has good biocompatibility together with other properties, and Gel was added to improve the properties of HA.76 Researchers in a study identified a new nano-hybrid structure of graphene oxide/silver/arginine (GO/Ag/Arg) as a wound dressing, which acted as an angiogenesis promoter and furnished antibacterial properties for improving the wound healing process. It was also shown to be non-toxic to fibroblast cells. After 12 days, the nanocomposite formed a thickened layer of skin on the wound surface. The use of an appropriate concentration of GO (synthesized by Hummers’ method) induced angiogenesis instead of cell death by controlling the formation of ROS. The presence of Ag in the structure endowed it with antibacterial properties, Arg is a binding agent and improved antibacterial and angiogenic properties, and the presence of PCL improved certain properties such as non-toxicity and biodegradability in the composite. GO also increased the hydrophilicity of the PCL sheets. It should be noted that on day 4, the wound size decreased significantly due to the synergistic effects between the angiogenicity of GO and Arg as well as the antibacterial properties of Ag.77 In another study, an Ag/Mg-GO@silk fibroin nanofibrous/PVA film was presented as a wound dressing for healing wounds in 14 days. In the wound healing process, Ag+ was used to prevent infection, Mg2+ was used to promote the migration of fibroblast cells, SF was used for cell adhesion, and GO was used for angiogenesis. GO acted as a potent site for Ag+ and Mg2+ ions. The addition of GO improved the hydrophilicity and adhesion and cell proliferation on the nanofibers, which was consistent with the MTT results.78 Ponrasu et al. introduced rGO-loaded isabgol nanocomposite scaffolds (Isab + rGO) as a wound dressing to enhance angiogenesis and accelerate wound healing in healthy and diabetic rats. rGO had fewer structural defects and good playability due to its green synthesis (rGO was synthesized via the rapid reduction of GO under focused solar radiation). Also, Isab is a natural carbohydrate polymer that, due to its hydrophilic properties, can absorb large amounts of wound secretions. This band treated normal wounds in 16 days and diabetic wounds in 20 days. In diabetic wounds, the initial recovery of the vascular network is critical to prevent wound spread. In the proliferative phase, collagen is synthesized and new blood vessels are formed. In this study, the immunohistochemistry results showed that rGO had strong angiogenic properties and also increased the synthesis of collagen. In addition, due to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, excellent tensile strength and antibacterial properties, it improved the cell proliferation.79 Liang et al. introduced a metformin-releasing hydrogel dressing that responds to both pH and glucose and manifested both adhesion and self-healing properties for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in athletes (sores in frequently movable foot). In the diabetic foot, high levels of glucose led to the rapid growth of bacteria, which created a bedrock for the destruction of healthy cells. The components of this wound dressing include PC (phenyl-boronic acid and benzaldehyde bifunctional polyethylene glycol-co-poly (glycerol sebacic acid)/dihydrocaffeic acid and L-arginine cografted chitosan) together with rGO and metformin (Met). PC has anti-inflammatory and angiogenic properties. Met and RGO have synergistic activity on the properties of PC. RGO was also added to the wound structure to provide conduction and homeostasis. Increased strength and antibacterial properties also emerged due to its presence. Also, L-arginine can increase insulin secretion. In this study, diabetic rat foot ulcers
were treated in 21 days using this bandage.80 Considering all the above, it can be concluded that GO and rGO scaffolds are promising for future biological applications such as wound dressings and tissue engineering. Other GO- and rGO-based nanocomposites with wound dressings applications are listed in Table 1.

2.2. Carbon dots and carbon quantum dots in wound healing
CDs and CQDs are a new generation of carbon nanostructures that have fascinating optical properties,139 tunable excitation/emission,140 low toxicity,10 biocompatibility,141 photostability,140 chemical inertness,140 easy handling,140 eco-friendliness140 and high ability to incorporate different components. Due to their special properties, CDs and CQDs are utilized in different biomedical fields,11 including drug delivery,142 photothermal therapy,143 tissue engineering,28 and wound healing (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Nanocomposites based on CDs and CQDs for wound dressings. 
Efficient wound management is essential and these carbon nanostructures can be effective in various processes of wound healing including inflammation, proliferation, fibroblast migration, angiogenesis and adhesion. Inflammation is an immune barrier against offensive microorganisms, therefore numerous studies have been performed on CD-based hydrogels for preventing the growth of bacteria at the wound site. For instance, Fangchao et al. reported a fluorescent antibacterial hydrogel with high biocompatibility and cell adhesiveness based on cationic CDs, pectin and polyacrylic acid.144 The hydrogel was injectable and composed of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate as a cross-linker and the foregoing polymer chains. CDs play synergistic roles of skeletal adhesion by generating hydrogen bonds in the formation of the hydrogel and antibacterial effects by destroying the bacterial cell membrane. When bacterial cells came in contact with the hydrogel, the dynamic balance of the hydrogen bonds was broken and cationic CDs were released, consequently killing the bacteria. Subcutaneous injection of CD-polyacrylic acid-pectin (CDs-AP) to the wound site annihilated S. aureus, causing the wound to heal after almost 7 days (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Overview of fluorescent, antibacterial and cell-adhesive CD-AP hydrogel, its synthesis and application in wound healing. A: synthesis of cationic CDs from (a) spermidine and o-phenylenediamine, (b) o-phenylenediamine, (c) α-lipoic acid and o-phenylenediamine. B: formation of CD-AP hydrogel from pectin, acrylic acid, CDs, APS, and PEGDA through one-pot method. C: scheme of CD-AP hydrogel applications and its molecular structure (a) cell adhesion and biocompatibility, (b) antibacterial, and (c and d): molecular structure of hydrogel.144 
In another report, Xiang et al. introduced a hybrid hydrogel as a wound dressing.145 This hydrogel, named DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel, was fabricated from folic acid, dopamine, transition metal ions (zn2+), and CQD-decorated ZnO. The first three compounds formed an injectable hydrogel to match the shapes of wounds and CQDs/ZnO could produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon excitation with infrared (IR) light or visible light. These species can oxidize proteins, phospholipids, and DNA/RNA of bacteria. The DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel exhibited obvious epidermal regeneration phenomena and showed a good healing effect after 10 days. Another way to suppress wound infection is to remove the ions and molecules needed by pathogens. Accordingly Chekini et al. developed an antibacterial wound dressing-based hydrogel with the capability of sensing and three-dimensional (3D) printing.146 The nanocolloidal hydrogel could deprive the wound of the Fe3+ ions required by bacteria, which was fabricated from cellulose nanocrystals carrying photoluminescence CDs and gelatin. By the absorption of Fe3+ ions, CDs were quenched and the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was prevented. The hydrogel did not significantly reduce the viability and proliferation activity of human skin fibroblasts after 72 h cell culture. The photoluminescence emission intensity was considerably reduced after 24 h exposure of the hydrogel dressing to the liquid mimicking a body fluid.
In the process of wound healing, the migration of epithelial cells also plays an important role. In the migration process, the epithelial cells transform into mesenchymal-like cells, which is known as the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In 2019, Wang et al. induced the EMT by utilizing CDs in cutaneous wounds.147 The CDs fabricated from ascorbic acid and polyethyleneimine stimulated the EMT process by activating the transforming growth factor TGF-β/p38/snail signaling pathway. According to this result, by stimulation of EMT, the cell–cell junctions are lost, the motility of the cells is enhanced and the process of wound healing is promoted. In this study, the in vivo experiments demonstrated that the area of the cutaneous wounds in the mice was significantly reduced after 12 days and the wounds almost healed after 15 days. Another factor that affects wound healing is the formation of new blood vessels or angiogenesis, which it is not recommended for tumor growth and metastasis. In this regard, Sharma et al. investigated the interaction of CDs with the endothelial cells (ECs) lining the blood vessels.148 ECs play a key role in the regulation of blood vessel function and angiogenesis occurs through the formation of new capillaries from previous ones following EC migration. The CDs synthesized from a combination of citric acid and urea (CDs-urea) caused a proangiogenic response in human vein ECs. The uptake of CD-urea by ECs influenced the reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and gene expression. In this study, the MTT assay exhibited that the CDs-urea significantly increased the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after 48 h. The CEA assay also demonstrated that the capillary networks were considerably enhanced at 12 h duration after CD-urea treatment.
In the wound site, excessive inflammation often occurs to prevent infection, which can lead to the overproduction of ROS. ROS ruin cell proliferation and delay the wound healing process, and therefore utilizing antioxidant agents annihilates ROS and drives wounds from the inflammatory phase to the cell proliferation phase. Recently, Zhang et al. fabricated cerium-doped carbon nanodots (Ce-CNDs) via the hydrothermal method for cutaneous wound healing via wiping or spraying.8 Cerium in this multifunctional nanoplatform acts as an antioxidant agent and CNDs exhibit antibacterial effects under UV radiation. The use of Ce-CNDs in skin wounds accelerated the wound healing function in 15 days and also effective in the angiogenesis and fibroplasia process. In another study, Moniruzzaman et al. developed dual-emissive CQDs that were accommodated in a biocompatible gelatin–methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel.149 The hydrogel provided 3D support for cell growth and proliferation at the wound site and the polyphenol CQDs were effective in reducing the amount of ROS induced by UV light. The aforementioned CQDs incorporated in GelMA promoted wound healing through the proliferation of fibroblasts, enhancing cell migration and reducing inflammation. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the GelMA–CQDs healed 85% of the rat skin wound in 14 days.
CQDs act as an excellent antibacterial agent because of their controlled size and easy functionalization. In this regard, Zhao, et al. fabricated nitrogen-doped CQDs (NCQDs) with a size of 2–5 nm via a simple one-step chemical route.150 NCQDs were synthesized from D(+)-glucose monohybrid and diethylenetriamine via a heat fusion method and the NCQDs could destroy the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. In this work, the antibacterial activity of NCQDs was evaluated in vivo and it was concluded that MRSA-infected skin wounds were healed after 14 days of treatment with NCQDs. The in vitro experiments also exhibited that the NCQs could destroy the cell structure of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, while NCQs did not affect E. coli bacteria. In another study, Zhao, et al. developed quaternized CQDs (qCQDs) with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.151 The qCQDs were synthesized from dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride and glucose via a green one-pot method and had different antibacterial mechanisms. The antibacterial mechanisms revealed that the qCQDs affected the ribosomal proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, while the metabolic proteins were reduced in Gram-negative bacteria. The qCQDs healed wounds exposed to a mixed bacterial suspension including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa after 14 days of treatment. In another example, Geng et al. reported graphitic-N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as a photothermal antibacterial agent for accelerating wound healing.152 When the bacteria contacted the N-GQDs under an NIR-II laser, the surface of them becomes apparently rough and wrinkled. In vivo experiments performed in this research, exhibited that infected skin wounds by MRSA were healed after 12 days of treatment with N-GQDs under 1064 nm laser irradiation.
In recent years, applying various compounds to improve wound dressing properties has attracted increasing attention. For instance, Abolghasemzade et al. reported the preparation of PVA-based nanofibers containing CQDs modified with silica NPs and silk fibroin (PVA–CQDs/Si NP/SF) via the electrospinning method for speeding up wound healing.153 The three-dimensional structure of the nanofibers created widespread space for carrying the CQD/Si NP/SF nanocomposite. The CQD/Si NPs induced an excellent antibacterial property in this nanocomposite and SF also had an effect on the cell growth and viability of fibroblast cells. The PVA–CQD/Si NP/SF nanofibers as a promising wound dressing exhibited the best wound healing effect in a rat skin wound after 14 days. In another study, Praseetha et al. developed Aloe-vera conjugated natural CQDs for enhancing the repair of chronic skin wounds.154 Chronic wounds require multiple antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents for healing, and therefore utilizing new compounds for the substitution of these agents is a considerable issue. In this work, the CQDs were obtained by the microwave method, which exhibited antibacterial properties, tissue biocompatibility, cell necrosis and promoted angiogenesis. The negative charge on the surface of the CQDs enhanced cell penetration and Aloe vera acted as a traditional wound healing agent by increasing the collagen content and improving the cross linking. In this study, the wound of zebra fish was healed after treatment with the CQD-conjugated Aloe-vera for a 10-day duration.
One of the favorable properties of wound dressings is that they should not lose their integrity and do not become sticky, while simultaneously keeping the moisture of the wound at a suitable level. In this regard, Kandra et al. suggested the use of a CD-loaded nanocomposite chitosan film for controlling the absorption of wound exudations.155 When electrostatic bonds are formed between the CDs and the chitosan chains, the film becomes rigid and the absorption of wound exudations is reduced, and therefore the structural integrity of the film is preserved and wound dressing is not torn. The expansion of the film before and after the absorption of gelatin solution in 60 min exhibited that the plain chitosan film expanded by 2.8 fold, whereas the CD-loaded chitosan film expanded by around 1.3 fold. Consequently, by changing the percentage of quantum dots loaded in the film, it is possible to design a convenient wound dressing that does not tear upon contact with the wound, and simultaneously controls the moisture of the wound.
In summary, the unique optical, small size, low toxicity, biocompatibility, surface functionalization and antibacterial properties of CDs and CQDs open the way to novel biomedical applications such as drug delivery, photothermal therapy, tissue engineering and special wound healing. These carbon nanomaterials can improve the wound dressing properties and accelerate wound healing by affecting the inflammation, proliferation, fibroblast migration, angiogenesis and adhesion processes of the wound. Other CD-based nanocomposites with wound dressing applications are listed in Table 2.

2.3. Carbon nanotubes
CNTs, generally known as buckytubes, are carbon-based nanoscale empty tubes.11 These nanotubes are classified as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multiple concentric cylinders, depending on whether they consist of a tubular nanostructure or several concentric cylinders, respectively.172 There are three forms of carbon nanotubes, including SWCNTs and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), which are made up of one or two (concentric) graphene cylinders, while multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are made up of many concentric cylindrical shells of graphene sheets.173 Several studies have been conducted to explore the potential of CNT-based materials in biomedical applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapies, implantable devices such as nanosensors, nanorobotics, and antibacterial, and wound dressings (Fig. 8). CNTs have valuable properties including good tensile strength, good conductivity, light weight and small size with a high aspect ratio.174
 Fig. 8  Application of nanocomposites based on CNTs for wound dressing. 
In the wound-healing process, electro-conductive composites of CNTs and non-conductive polymeric materials have been efficiently utilized. The combination of intelligent hydrogels and CNTs was very effective in wound dressings, antibacterial treatment,6 cell adhesion and proliferation.175 He et al. presented a set of self-healing, adhesive and conductive nanocomposite hydrogels based on N-carboxyethyl chitosan (CEC) and Pluronic F127 CNTs with benzaldehyde (PF127/CNTs) (Fig. 9). The hydrogel networks were formed by combining the Schiff base bond between the –CHO groups from the PF127-CHO polymer and the –NH2 groups from CEC and PF127 micelle physical cross-linking in one system. The in vivo experiment in a model of infected rat thick skin showed that the hydrogels had an excellent therapeutic effect, leading to a significant improvement in wound closure, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis after 7 days.176
 Fig. 9  Schematic representation of CEC/PF/CNT hydrogel preparation: main shape, bending, tensile shape display and adhesion behavior of CEC/PF/CNT hydrogel.176 
In the treatment of large injuries and chronic wounds, Liang et al. reported a multifunctional chitosan-based hydrogel film doped with CNTs and polyacrylamide hydrogels (pAAm) as a wound healing material. A dual lattice hydrogel (DN) was loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The formed DN hydrogel had a high tensile stress and moderate tensile ratio, which improved its mechanical properties. Due to the conductive properties of the CNTs, they increased the interaction between the cells and enhanced cell proliferation. In general, hydrogel layers made from pure chitosan are brittle, and therefore difficult to apply to large wounds. In contrast, the pAAm hydrogel had excellent toughness. Therefore, the combination of chitosan and pAAm hydrogel resulted in integrated hydrogel strength. In the in vivo experiments, the wounded mice were divided into four groups and treated with phosphate buffer solution (PBS), DN hydrogel, DN + CNTs hydrogel and DN + CNTs + VEGF hydrogel. VEGF degrades the extracellular matrix for proliferation and angiogenesis. In the case of the DN + CNTs + VEGF hydrogels, the wound surface size treated by this group was approximately 12% larger than that treated with PBS after 7 days.177 Safaei et al. proposed a one-step method to fabricate optical core–shell microfiber textiles by combining SWCNTs as a sensor layer to monitor oxidative stress and light based on the real-time hydrogen peroxide concentration in in vitro wounds. Hydrogen peroxide as an intracellular ROS messenger stimulates key wound healing stages including angiogenesis. In the electrospun fibers, the SWCNTs were encapsulated in a shell that was soluble in organic solvents, which here was selected as polycaprolactone (PCL). This polymer was used in tissue engineering and wound healing. Raman microscopy showed that the SWCNT nanosensors were enclosed in separate fibers for up to 21 days. This means that the long-term identity of the nanosensor platform was preserved. In addition, microfiber textiles were integrated in a commercial wound bandage without significant degradation in their optical properties, ultimately allowing peroxide measurements to be made on the wound.178 He et al. used a Prussian blue (PB) analog coral-like cobalt cyanide cobalt (CoHCF) to synthesize bamboo-like nanozymes based on nitrogen-coated CNTs encapsulating Co nanomaterials (N-CNTs@Co) via thermal decomposition at high temperatures. This structure prevented the leakage of the CO nanoparticles enclosed inside the hollow CNTs and improved their dispersion and stability because Co nanoparticles act as the active center of oxidase-mimicking nanowires. The obtained N-CNTs@Co could catalyze oxygen to produce a lot of ROS and was used as antibacterial agent in vitro. This structure had a lethal effect on S. aureus and E. coli by destroying the two representative bacterial membranes and causing lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. The antibacterial tests lasted for 20 days.179 Another study by Ravanbakhsh et al. on cnt-glycol chitosan (GC) hydrogels found that CNTs promoted cell migration in hydrogels. CNTs were added to the GC hydrogel matrix to determine the effect of their concentration on cell uptake, cell migration, and cell adhesion. Here, cell migration with different concentrations of COOH-CNTs was examined by modifying a Boyden chamber using flow cytometry. The results showed that low concentrations of CNTs increased the cell migration, thus accelerating wound healing in various organs of the human body compared to when there was insufficient migration in the empty matrix.180 An electric field (EF) in hydrogels increase cell proliferation, and therefore effective in wound healing. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of an electroactive cellulose/polypyrrole/CNT hydrogel (rBC/PPy/CNTs) with excellent thermal stability, mechanical properties, recyclability and good water absorption in aqueous NaOH/urea solution followed by saturation of CNTs and physical and chemical crosslinking method to increase cell proliferation. The addition of CNTs to hydrogels is beneficial for cell adhesion, proliferation and wound healing. The combination of the rBC/PPy/CNT hydrogels with EF significantly increased the cell proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts.175 In another study by Xu et al., multifunctional conductive macroporous nanocomposite hydrogels (MNHs) were synthesized from water-collecting emulsions in water, stabilized by colloidal CNT /GelMA hybrids to differentiate nerve stem cells and heal skin wounds. The MNH hydrogels showed mechanical properties with different concentrations of CNTs in the crosslinking matrices. The macroporous structure of hydrogels plays an important role in cell growth and migration. Here, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), HHC36, was designed according to the neural network structure with 9 amino acids. In in vivo experiments, the release of AMPs showed high S. aureus killing activity, and this hydrogel showed antimicrobial action and wound healing in two weeks.181 Scaffolds for tissue engineering must enable cell binding, proliferation, and differentiation conditions. In this regard, Vedhanayagam et al. reported the preparation of collagen scaffolds of dendrimer functionalized carbon-based nanomaterials, TES-PAMAM-G3, which exhibited anti-inflammatory activity for wound healing. Due to the adhesion of CNTs to collagen, its diameter increases compared to native collagen. The nanocarbon type played an important role in the mechanical properties. The SWCNTs maintained the regulation of the collagen fiber more than native collagen (Fig. 10). The results showed that the synthesized collagen scaffold was effective in tissue regeneration and wound healing due to its mechanical stability. After 21 days of treatment, the recovery in the CBN-TES-PAMAM-G3-treated groups was faster than that of the TES-PAMAM-G3-collagen group.182

Singh et al. reported for the first time the synthesis of hydrogel nanotubes (HNTs) with an ice helix through aqueous copolymerization by free radicals to repair diabetic wounds. Their biocompatibility helped rapid wound formation by simultaneous cell proliferation. These HNTs well-proliferated with fibroblasts. The HNTs showed good mechanical strength. They also supported accelerated angiogenesis, which ensured proper blood flow, keratinocyte migration and collagen deposition in the wound bed, leading to complete cure of diabetic ulcers by day 16 in rats.183 Chen et al. synthesized chitosan/CNT nanoparticles for the slow release of isoniazid (INH/CS/CTN) to heal secondary bone tuberculosis wounds. The in vitro experiments showed that the chitosan/carbon nanotube nanoparticles did not inhibit the biological function of isoniazid, but greatly reduced the cytotoxicity and inflammatory response of INH. The animal experiments showed that tuberculosis was found to be eliminated by transferring INH to the wound site via CTN. CS/CTN could control the release of INH for 7 days. The wound area was reduced by 94.6% and 89.8%, respectively, in contrast to the isoniazid group and the isoniazid/CNT group.184 Liu et al. reported the antimicrobial activity of a nanocomposite composed of carboxylated CNTs (CNTs-COOH) and regenerated cellulose (RC) by lysozyme immobilization via a lysozyme-amide-linked cellulose conjugate, which was electrospun into nonwoven mats. The enzyme activity showed that Lys@CNTs-COOH/RC and Lys@GO/RC were significantly active, which led to the conclusion that due to the presence of CNTs-COOH, the RC nanofibrous mats could be covalently bound with lysozyme for their attachment, which are biocompatible and bioactive materials.185 One of the remaining challenges is the development of injectable antibacterial and memory conductive hemostatic materials with high blood absorption and rapid recovery for the treatment of irregular and uncompressed bleeding. Here, Zhao et al. reported the preparation of cryogels with the same properties based on CNTs and glycidyl methacrylate activated quaternized chitosan as hemostatic dressings for lethal noncompressible hemorrhage hemostasis and wound healing. The cryogels possessed the properties of mechanical strength, fast shape recovery and rapid absorption of blood, and high blood absorption capacity. All the wounds healed completely on the 15th day. The results demonstrated that the these multi-functional hemostatic dressings with multiple functions are excellent candidates as hemostatic dressings for lethal noncompressible hemorrhage and wound dressing applications.186 Li et al. synthesized a conductive self-healing hydrogel composite using SWCNTs, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide) copolymer derivative modified with pyrene and borate functional moieties. The SWCNTs were uniformly dispersed in aqueous solution via p–p accumulating with pyrene groups of P2, constructing conductive channels in the hydrogels simultaneously. In addition, the stiffness of the hydrogels was enhanced by introducing SWCNTs in the systems. The boronate ester bonds formed between the phenylboronic acids groups and PVA endowed the hydrogels with autonomous self-recovery capability without any external stimuli. The hydrogel also showed rapid and reproducible electrical self-healing property (within 10 seconds) and a high recovery efficiency of over 95%.187
Also, Lee et al. employed the antimicrobial properties of lignin-decorated multi-walled CNTs (t-MWNTs) to obtain strong mechanical poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers. Lignin chains adorned the surface of t-MWNTs, and electrospun lignin/t-MWNT/NF PVA was composed of t-MWNTs homogeneous distributed in PVA NFs. The lignin /t-MWNT/PVA composites exhibited increased antimicrobial properties compared to the lignin/PVA composites. This is due to the contribution of the lignin-decorated tMWNTs in increasing the dispersing ability of the PVA matrix. The mechanical properties of the lignin/t-MWNT/PVA NFs were preserved even after PVA heat treatment, which is an essential process for wound healing on the dermal layer.188 MWCNTs with heteroatoms (N, F, P/B) such as NFP-MWCNTs and NFB-MWCNTs maximize the wound healing effectiveness through wound destruction. In this respect, Murugesan et al. synthesized them in a simple, accessible, cost-effective and effective way. The bacterial biofilm is a barrier for wound healing. The surface charge created by heteroatoms, which is caused by their different electronegativity, prevents the formation of biofilms and leads to wound healing together with a heteroatom mineral source for the regeneration and granulation of mouse fibroblasts. After 22 days of therapy, the skin wound of the MWCNT-treated rat doped with heteroatoms almost disappeared.189 In another study, a composite film, BC-MWCNTs, consisting of bacterial cellulose with MWCNTs was designed by Khalid et al. and investigated for its diabetic wound healing applications. This dressing reduced inflammation and healing of the wounds by moist retention. The in vivo studies showed that the antibacterial function of the composite caused the wound to close completely within 14 days of treatment with the BC-MWCNT composite films.16 Zhong et al. synthesized temperature-sensitive nanocomposite (DEA) intelligent hydrogels with (CNTs) and glycidyl methacrylate-functionalized quaternized chitosan (QCGM). In general, the prepared temperature-sensitive nanocomposite hydrogels with improved mechanical properties, high biological safety, and rapid wound healing have remarkable practicability in the field of wound dressings. In the in vivo experiment, the wounds in both the control and hydrogel dressing healed well after 14 days of treatment.190 The design of biofriendly antibacterial materials with sufficient strength to fight bacteria, while improving tissues is challenging. In this regard Zhong, et al. developed a piezoelectrically active antibacterial device that changes ambient O2 and H2O to ROS by piezocatalytic processes. The produced ROS killed bacterial cells and the sterilizing rate for S. aureus and E. coli reached 84.11% and 94.85% after 10 min application, respectively.191 Shei et al. prepared a type of hydrogel by combining poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), oligo (ethylene glycol) methacrylate and 2-(2-methoxy ethoxy) ethyl methacrylate derivatives, with heat storage capacity and thermal conductivity through a one-pot method for burn therapy. The hydrogel was composed of heat-responsive PEG derivatives and CNT-OH performed a function of rapid heat absorption, which further reduced thermal damage and promoted wound healing.192 Other CNT-based nanocomposites with wound dressings applications are listed in Table 3.

2.4. Carbon nanofibers
CNFs have gained significant attention because of their unique properties, such as being economic, flexible and having high surface area, which make them perfect candidates for biomedical applications. CNFs can be used as a valuable component for wound dressing given that they induce mechanical and thermal consistency to antibacterial materials.204 The mechanical properties of CNFs such as strength, stiffness, fracture behavior, and toughness depend on their size, synthesis method and microstructure.205 According to previous studies, CNFs have a tensile strength in the range of 1.5 to 7 GPa and Young's modulus between 228 and 724 GPa.205 In addition, the features of CNFs such as selective adsorption, polymer reinforcement, electrochemical catalysis and hydrogen storage have also led to the use of CNFs in other fields.206 Alginate is known for its remarkable biocompatibility and economic viability. However, its biomedical applications are limited due to its low mechanical strength. Thus, to overcome this issue, Llorens-Gamez et al. added different amounts of CNFs to alginate-based films. The results indicated that these composites show similar biological characteristics as alginate, and therefore no cell adhesion and cytotoxicity were observed, and the mechanical properties of alginate were interestingly elevated with the incorporation of CNFs. This improvement was achieved by using very low amounts of CNFs.207 Diabetic patients with delayed wound healing process are constantly in danger of bacterial infections, and thus designing new dressings for the faster healing of diabetic wounds is a necessity. Bhadauriya et al. synthesized immobilized yeast extract and Cu NPs dispersed in CNFs and used it as a diabetic wound dressing composite. The test results showed no cytotoxicity, remarkable glucose consumption and antibacterial activity for E. coli and S. aureus. The in vivo analysis indicated that this composite enhanced the healing process rate and that it can be used as a safe and effective wound dressing for diabetic wound healing.208P. aeruginosa is a common infection bacterium, which has turned resistant against the common drugs. Ashfaq et al. combined polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and acetate phthalate (CAP) with Cu/Zn NPs dispersed in activated carbon micro/nanofiber (ACF/CNFs) to prepare a wound dressing polymeric nanocomposite. ACF/CNFs reinforced the structure and increased the mechanical and thermal stability, while PVA/CAP helped with the slow release of NPs. Cu/Zn bimetal acted as antibacterial agents and the test results on resistant P. aeruginosa strains showed that the composite inhibited bacteria growth and enhanced wound healing. Fig. 11 shows the preparation steps and biomedical tests. Firstly, ball-milled Cu/Zn-ACF/CNFs were dispersed in CAP aqueous solution, and then mixed with PVA at the beginning of gel formation, and finally biomedical tests were performed on the prepared polymer-metal–carbon nanocomposite (PMC).209
 Fig. 11  Illustration of preparation steps and tests on PMC bio-nanocomposite.209 
2.5. Nanodiamonds
NDs are another group of carbon nanostructures. Researchers have proven that NDs have the highest biocompatibility among the carbon nanoparticles. Moreover, their biocidal property, nanoscale size, availability, low toxicity, facile functionalization and outstanding physicochemical nature make them perfect candidates for biomedical applications such as wound healing.210 One of the features of NDs, i.e., photoluminescence, is due to their structural imperfection. Using this important property, Khalid et al. prepared a hybrid ND-silk membrane through electrospinning. NDs increased the thermal stability of the silk fibers and also fluoresced inside the fibers and acted as a nanothermometer, making it possible to monitor the temperature changes in the case of any infection or inflammation under the dressing. The silk fibers could compensate for the deficiency in extracellular matrix in the wound areas, helping the process of healing. The membrane also exhibited biocompatibility and selective antifouling and biocidal tendency for Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa.211 Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) is a good polymeric candidate for tissue engineering applications. By adding NDs to PLC, Houshyar et al. prepared ND/PCL nanofiber scaffolds. These scaffolds showed better moisture control and thermal stability than PLC and no cytotoxicity.212
2.6. Other carbon-based nanocomposites
The other carbon species used in wound dressings include mesoporous carbon, activated carbon and fullerene. In the study by Torre et al., they prepared a mesoporous carbon dressing decorated with silver particles. Mesoporous carbon is gaining attention for biomedical applications duo to its high mechanical strength, tunable porous structure, biocompatibility and high absorption capacity. Silver is also known for possessing anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. The resulting composite was used as a wound dressing for acute and chronic wounds, showing no cytotoxicity, and it did not cause any short-term inflammation responses.213 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are oxygen-containing reactive molecules and can cause damage to bacterial cells. Zhao et al. designed a copper single-atom catalyst (Cu SAC) using N-doped mesoporous carbon as a biocompatible and porous support. Some metal ions exhibit antibacterial properties but can be toxic in large quantities. The N atom in the nanocarbon structure acts as an anchor to coordinate with metal ions and controls the release. A single copper atom can successfully turn O2 to O2− as antibacterial ROS under ambient conditions. A Cu SAC was tested in vivo and the results showed that this therapeutic catalyst not only had antibacterial activity, it also accelerated the healing process within a 7-day trial.214 The next important nanocarbon is fullerene. Fullerene is known for its chemical stability and antibacterial property and can be used as a phototherapeutic agent.215 Many lives have been saved using antibacterial medicines since their invention. However, the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is making traditional antibiotics lose their efficiency. Therefore, developing new methods to fight bacteria has become a major necessity for public health. In their study, Zhang et al. designed an injectable dipeptide-fullerene hydrogel and used it for photodynamic therapy (PDT) to resist bacteria. PDT destroys bacteria using ROS produced from a photosensitizer and oxygen under light. Duo to the high chemical stability of fullerene, it can act as a photosensitizer to inactive bacteria. Fullerene also increases the mechanical strength of hydrogels. It appears that fullerenes have a tendency to aggregate, which limits their biomedical applications. Accordingly, non-covalent interactions between peptides and fullerene can prevent the aggregation of fullerene, which improves the PDT efficiency compared with untreated fullerene. The hydrogel was tested in vitro and in vivo, and the results showed that the hydrogels exhibited efficient antibacterial activity toward multi-antibiotic resistant S. aureus and an elevated wound healing process.216 Cryosurgery is a treatment method for various types of skin lesions. The benefits of this method include low side effects and high success rate but it leaves the skin wound cold. This issue has been investigated for a long time. To treat cold skin wounds, Vlasov et al. proved that the abdominal cavity injection of a C60 fullerene colloidal solution stimulated multiplication in the epidermis of the areas surrounding the wound, which accelerated the wound cleansing from necrotic tissue, increased the thickness of the epithelial layer and decreased the thickness of the primary and secondary necrosis area.217
Activated carbon (AC), as another carbon nanostructure, is biocompatible, possesses a large active site and is widely used in biomedical applications such as wound healing because of its high adsorption property. One important factor in patients is their physical and mental well-being during the wound healing process, especially in chronic wounds, where malodor control is necessary. Minsart et al. combined methacrylate alginate (AlgMOD) and acrylate-end-capped, urethane-based precursors (AUPs) with AC and prepared hydrogel sheets. AC was used to directly manage the malodor by adsorbing the relevant volatile components. AlgMOD made chemical cross-linking possible, while AUPs were added to tune the swelling capacity and mechanical property. The resulting hydrogel was successfully used as a malodor-adsorbing dressing.218 In a recent study, Probst et al. designed a novel polyacrylate wound dressing with an AC cloth pad and compared its abilities with a standard non-adhesive hydrocellular foam with silver. The results showed faster wound healing and less maceration for the AC-containing dressing.219 Oher carbon nanomaterial-based nanocomposites with wound dressing applications are listed in Table 4.

3. Outlook and perspective
Nowadays, with the increase in environmental and biological hazards, chronic vascular diseases and diabetes, wound treatment has received increasing attention. If wounds are not treated and managed properly, they can cause infection, pain and the need to take large amounts of medicine. The use of dressings is a common method for managing wounds, and various substances such as carbon nanomaterials have been used to make these dressings. Although there are many articles on the use of carbon nanomaterials in wound dressings, there are challenges and opportunities for further research. In this regard, although many nanocomposites containing carbon nanomaterials have been successfully synthesized in the laboratory, their industrial production can still be evaluated. In addition, the long-term cytotoxicity or possible interactions with the biological environment and biomolecules can be considered. For example, the agglomeration of carbon nanomaterials in the biological medium may change the properties of the wound dressing nanocomposite, which can be investigated. Alternatively, the functionalization of carbon nanomaterials should be studied to improve the properties of these nanocomposites.
4. Conclusions
Carbon nanomaterials with properties such as large surface-to-volume ratio, high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, strong mechanical strength, easy functionalization, biocompatibility and biodegradability have been widely used in the biological and medical fields. The use of carbon nanomaterials in the wound healing process is one of the most recent and practical cases. In this regard, various nanocomposites have been synthesized by using carbon nanomaterials together with natural and synthetic polymers, metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, crosslinkers, MOFs, etc. These nanocomposites have been used in healing and protecting wounds caused by accidental or intentional etiology or as a result of a disease process. Herein, we presented a comprehensive study on the latest developments of nanocarbon materials such as GO, rGO, CDs, CQDs, CNTs, CNFs, and NDs in wound dressings.
