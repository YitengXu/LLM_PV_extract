    , Accepted 21st April 2014First published on 22nd April 2014AbstractDithiol-substituted Zn-phthalocyanine derivatives (TAZnPc1, TAZnPc2 and TAZnPc3) were synthesized and functionalized on nanometals (Au and Ag) and nanometal–TiO2 hybrids were harnessed to cover the visible region of the absorption spectrum. Photophysical studies reveal that both H- and J-aggregation were present in the ZnPc-functionalized nanometal, and the extent of J-aggregation is superior on the surface of Ag nanoparticles. On the other hand, no H-aggregation was observed in the nanometal–TiO2 hybrid film, despite the fact that the tetra-anchoring derivative (TAZnPc3) shows lesser J-aggregation on the nanometal–TiO2 hybrid film than that of other two mono-anchoring derivatives (TAZnPc1 and TAZnPc2). Further, the electron injection and recombination processes were investigated by time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. All the derivatives furnish biexponential decay on the nanometal surface. The shorter component is due to electron injection of ZnPc-nanometal particles and the longer component is due to free ZnPc. The rate of electron injection is faster for ZnPc-gold nanoparticles than that of silver nanoparticles, predominantly in TAZnPc1. This is due to the greater aggregation tendency of ZnPc derivatives on Ag nanoparticles than Au nanoparticles. After electron injection, the electron-transfer product (i.e. the radical cation of ZnPc) was observed at 600 nm. Moreover, the fluorescence of ZnPc derivatives on nanometal–TiO2 films was completely quenched due to the shuttling of electrons from ZnPc to TiO2 efficiently by metal nanoparticles.
1. Introduction
The dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a suitable alternative to the conventional silicon-based solar cell to meet the global energy and environmental challenges in a cost-effective and eco-friendly manner. DSSCs have drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community after the report of O'Regan and Grätzel on the relatively high power conversion efficiency (η = 11%)1 by employing Ru-sensitizers. In this connection, many research groups around the world have optimized the DSSC components to improve the power conversion efficiency beyond 11%. To date, a 12.3% efficiency of DSSCs has been achieved by co-sensitization2 of a zinc porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and an organic dye (Y123) in conjunction with the redox couple [Co(II/III)(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, speeding up the research on practical application of DSSCs. Till now, various dyes including metal complexes, porphyrins, phthalocyanines and metal-free organic dyes have been tested for DSSC efficiency. Among them, Ru-complexes and porphyrin derivatives show much improved power conversion efficiency.
Light harvesting3 and interfacial charge separation4 are crucial factors in DSSCs. The sensitizer should possess efficient absorption in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum and be capable of injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 (titanium dioxide). Since the solar photon flux is superior in that region,5 the syntheses of NIR-absorbing dyes have become a more interesting issue. Zn-phthalocyanines are a class of heteroaromatic, extensively π-conjugated metallomacrocycles. The excellent optical and electronic properties6 of these molecular materials has led to their application in the fields of optical storage, photodynamic therapy (PDT), solar cells, catalysis, non-linear optics, etc. Phthalocyanines are characterized by their intense NIR absorption and excellent chemical-, thermal- and photo-stability, which are advantageous for DSSCs.7,8 In addition to these properties, they are attractive sensitizers due to their appropriate redox properties for the sensitization of TiO2. Torres and co-workers reported the conversion efficiency of 3.5% for unsymmetrical amphiphilic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) TT19 having three tert-butyl groups and a carboxylic acid group. The 4.6% power conversion efficiency of ZnPc-based solar cells10 was also reported by Mori and co-workers by introducing bulky substituents into the ZnPc core in order to prevent aggregation. Recently, Grätzel et al. reported the highest power conversion efficiency11 of 6.1% for the ZnPc core bearing carboxyethynyl anchoring ligands. Although ZnPc possesses a higher extinction co-efficient in the NIR region, power conversion efficiencies have still not been impressive7 compared to Ru-complexes and porphyrins. The strong tendency to aggregate on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles12,13 results in intermolecular energy transfer and lack of directionality in the excited state,14–16 which limits the electron-injection efficiency. Moreover, phthalocyanines are insoluble in common organic solvents, which also make them difficult to use in DSSCs.
In this respect, chromophore-functionalized nanomaterials have generated a great deal of interest in recent years due to their application in the field of energy conversion, chemical and biological sensors, targeted drug delivery agents etc. The tunable optical properties of metal nanoparticles,17 in particular gold and silver, depend on their size, shape and surroundings and have allowed them to find application in several fields of modern science and technology. Furthermore, the functionality of the gold and silver nanoparticles can be enhanced by assembling with photoactive chromophores. The broad surface plasmon absorption18 of ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles makes them promising materials for the light-harvesting process in DSSCs. The presence of metal nanoparticles may improve the device efficiency19 due to the enhanced absorption of surface plasmons with high extinction co-efficient, improved charge separation and electron storage effects. For example, Chlorophyll a in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene has demonstrated the tendency of gold nanoparticles to accept and mediate or shuttle electrons20 to fullerene, leading to enhanced charge separation, and the recombination was observed at 42 μs. Kotiaho et al. reported the excitation of phthalocyanines in Pc-AuNPs, resulting electron transfer21 from the phthalocyanine to the gold nanoparticles and faster electron–cation recombination that occurs around 3 ps. A recent report has shown a mesoscopic TiO2 film modified with gold clusters22 deliver a stable photocurrent of 3.96 mA cm−2 with a power conversion efficiency of 2.3%. The electron-injection kinetics and device efficiency were significantly improved for a gold nanoparticle–polythiophene-sensitized TiO2 electrode,23 due to enhanced charge separation in the presence of the gold nanoparticles.
ZnPc-functionalized materials have shown potential application in DSSCs,3 but their aggregation behavior and photoinduced electron-transfer processes have not yet been studied in detail. In this respect, it is necessary to develop a method to prevent the aggregation of metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) on the TiO2 surface, which may yield a higher power conversion efficiency. It is also important to design a system which absorbs the entire visible region for higher light-harvesting efficiency. Understanding of aggregation behavior and electron injection/recombination dynamics of ZnPc on the metal nanoparticle surface is important to improve the device efficiency of ZnPc-based solar cells. In this connection, only very few reports21,24,25 are available for phthalocyanine-functionalized metal nanoparticles. Recently, we took the step in this direction by investigating the aggregation behavior and its influence on the electron injection/recombination process of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ZnPc on a TiO2 surface.26 The extent of H-aggregation controls the electron-injection process, yet at the same time has no influence on the recombination dynamics. In the present work, thioctic acid-substituted symmetrical and unsymmetrical Zn-phthalocyanine (TAZnPc = thiocticamido Zn-phthalocyanine) derivatives were synthesized (Scheme 1) and functionalized on the surface of gold and silver nanoparticles. The dithiol moiety of thioctic acid provides strong anchoring of TAZnPc on the gold/silver nanoparticle surface, resulting in greater stability. Further, the functionalized materials were adsorbed on TiO2 film by employing thioctic acid as linker (Scheme 2). Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements were carried out to gain insights into the aggregation behavior and electron injection/recombination dynamics of the ZnPc-functionalized material in solution and on the TiO2 film.

2. Experimental section
All the solvents were purchased from Fischer Scientific and used as such without further purification, and the materials employed in synthesis were purchased from SRL and Aldrich. For spectroscopic studies, we used HPLC grade solvents.
2.1. Synthesis of TAZnPc derivatives
Thioctic acid (TA)-substituted ZnPc derivatives TAZnPc1, 2 and 3 (Scheme 1) were synthesized and characterized. The TA was coupled with amino derivatives of phthalonitrile by acid–amine coupling using DCC as a coupling agent. Derivatives 1 and 2 are unsymmetrical ZnPcs, whereas the derivative 3 is a symmetrical ZnPc. One TA was directly attached to the ZnPc ring in TAZnPc1. One and four TAs Are attached through the phenoxy group in TAZnPc2 and 3 respectively. 1H NMR and HR-MS spectra of the TAZnPc derivatives are given in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S6). TAZnPc derivatives were synthesized by employing the procedure as reported earlier.26 The hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) acted as nitrogen source, which involves the cyclization of phthalonitriles co-ordinated by zinc metal ion. Generally, regioisomers of phthalocyanines were obtained and it is not possible to separate them by column chromatographic technique. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) of the TAZnPc derivatives shows that alkyl protons are overlapped and the aromatic protons are broadened due to aggregation and are unable to be resolved. The experimental HR-MS values (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†) of the TAZnPc derivatives are in good agreement with the calculated values.

2.2. Synthesis of TAZnPc-functionalized GNP/SNP
One-pot synthesis27 of TAZnPc-functionalized GNP (gold nanoparticles) and SNP (silver nanoparticles) were carried out by reducing both the TAZnPc and HAuCl4/AgNO3 using a strong reducing agent NaBH4 in DMF at room temperature (Fig. S4a, b, ESI†) (Scheme 2a). During the course of the reaction, the dithiol moiety (capping agent) of TAZnPc was reduced to the –SH group and GNP and SNP were formed due to the reduction of HAuCl4/AgNO3. The nucleation and growth of metal nanoparticles and attachment of the –SH group take place near simultaneously. So the further growth of nanoparticles was arrested in functionalized nanoparticles, resulting in smaller spherical nanoparticles. In the absence of stabilizing agents the bare nanoparticles were not stable. The –SH group possesses a strong affinity towards the GNP and SNP surface and is involved in covalent linking and hence it also serves as a stabilizing agent. TAZnPc3 with four thioctic acid groups has the possibility of multiple anchoring on the nanoparticle surface. The presence of dithiol as an anchoring group enables all these molecules to anchor strongly on the metal nanoparticle surface. The dithiol group provides good organization of self-assembled monolayers on the gold surface.28 The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by HR-TEM, IR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. In the HR-TEM images (Fig. S7–S9, ESI†) both GNP and SNP are roughly spherical in shape. Comparatively the functionalized silver nanoparticles are irregular spherical shape as observed from the HR-TEM images (Fig. S7b, S8b and S9b, ESI†). The size of the GNP and SNP are in the range 2–5 nm and 2–7 nm respectively. The size of the nanoparticles is influenced by the size of the ligand during nanoparticle formation.29 It is already known in the literature30 that long-chain thiol groups stabilize smaller gold nanoparticles.
The absence of a peak around 2560 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles (Fig. 1) indicates the absence of the SH group,27 which is a clear indicator of the covalent linkage of all molecules to the surface of the nanoparticles. The IR spectrum of TAZnPc-functionalized nanoparticles does not show major group vibrations in the region of 2000–2900 cm−1 other than the SH group. So it is easy to identify the presence or absence of the SH group in functionalized nanoparticles. However, the bands in the region below 2000 cm−1 are broadened and overlapped due aggregation of TAZnPc on the nanoparticle surface. So it is not possible to completely resolve the IR spectrum. The absorption spectra of TAZnPc-functionalized GNP and SNP show their corresponding surface plasmons around 530 and 490 nm (Fig. 3a and 3b), confirming formation of the nanoparticles.

2.3. Preparation of TAZnPc-functionalized nanometal–TiO2 hybrid film
Preparation of the respective TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles–TiO2 hybrid film was carried out in two steps. Initially the TAZnPc and TA-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles were prepared by (Scheme 2b) reducing TAZnPc, TA and HAuCl4/AgNO3 with NaBH4 in DMF at room temperature. The prepared solution was used for preparation of the TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticle–TiO2 hybrid film (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). A bifunctional molecule such as TA is used to link the TAZnPc-functionalized gold/silver nanoparticles on the TiO2 film. The dithiol end of TA was covalently linked to the Au and Ag nanoparticle surface. The free COOH end of TA was utilized to link the TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles on the TiO2 film (Scheme 2b). The vibrational frequencies for OH (3195, 1385 cm−1) and CO (1592 cm−1) groups were observed for ZnPc/TA-functionalized materials. The absorption spectra (seen later in Fig. 5a and 5b) of the ZnPc/TA-functionalized materials show the TiO2 band edge absorption, surface plasmon absorption and Q-band absorption of ZnPc. The ZnPc-functionalized materials without TA do not adsorb on the TiO2 surface, as evidenced by the absence of the surface plasmon absorption and Q-band absorption of ZnPc. This clearly reveals that the COOH group is essential for adsorption on the TiO2 surface.26
3. Experimental setup
IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific NICOLET iS5 model using iD1 Transmission with KBr pellets. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 300 MHz instrument. HR-MS was carried out using a Micromass Q-Tof micro analyzer with a Q-Tof Lockspray dual electrospray source. HR-TEM images were recorded with an FEI Tecnai G2. The sample was cast on a carbon-coated copper grid by drop coating, dried and then the HR-TEM image recorded. The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-vis diode-array spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectral measurements were carried out using a Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Time-resolved picosecond fluorescence decays were obtained by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R3809U) as the detector and a 635 nm LED was used as the excitation source. The instrument response function for the TCSPC system is <200 ps. Data analysis was carried out by the software provided by IBH (DAS-6), which is based on the deconvolution technique using non-linear least-squares methods. Transient absorption experiments were carried out using nanosecond laser flash photolysis (Applied Photophysics, UK). The third harmonic (355 nm) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, LAB 150, Spectra Physics, USA) with 8 ns pulse width and 150 mJ pulse energy was used to excite the sample. The transients were probed using a 150 W pulsed xenon lamp, a Czerny–Turner monochromator, and s Hamamatsu R-928 photomultiplier tube as the detector. The transient signals were captured using an Agilent Infiniium digital storage oscilloscope and the data were transferred to the computer for analysis. Samples were purged with argon gas for 45 min prior to the laser irradiation. Electrochemical studies were carried out with an Electrochemical Analyzer CHI-620B series using the Cyclic Voltammetry technique. TBAPF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate) was used as the electrolyte. The measurements were carried out in three-electrode systems using platinum as the working electrode, silver/silver chloride as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The measurements were carried out with reference to Fc/Fc+.
3.1. Quantum yield measurements
Fluorescence and triplet quantum yield measurements were carried out by using the following methods.31

3.1.1. Fluorescence quantum yield (Φf). 
The fluorescence quantum yield was recorded by fixing the absorbance at the excitation wavelength (610 nm corresponds to the S0 to S1 transitions) for the reference and sample. Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) was used as reference (Φ0f = 0.20 in DMSO). All the samples are excited at 610 nm and the corrected fluorescence spectrum was measured. The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) was calculated using eqn (1), Φf = FsA0Φ0f/(F0As)(1)where Fs and F0 are the integrated fluorescence intensity of the sample and reference, As and A0 are the absorbance at the excitation wavelength of the sample and reference, and Φ0f is the fluorescence quantum yield of the reference. The calculated values are given in Table 1.

3.1.2. Triplet quantum yield. 
The triplet–triplet absorption co-efficient (εT) values were obtained using eqn (2), εT = εS ΔAT/ΔAs(2)where ΔAS and ΔAT are the absorbance change of the triplet absorption spectrum at the minimum of the bleaching band and the maximum of the positive band respectively, and εS is the ground-state molar absorption co-efficient. The triplet quantum yield (ΦT) was obtained by comparing the ΔAT of the optically matched sample solution at 355 nm to that of the reference ZnPc (ΦT = 0.65) and the values are calculated using eqn (3): ΦT = ΦZnPcTΔAT/ΔAZnPcTεZnPcT/εT.(3)The calculated values are given in Table 1.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Photophysics of TAZnPc in solution
The normalized absorption spectra of all ZnPc dyes in DMF are shown in Fig. 2a. These ZnPc dyes show the characteristic strong, narrow, long-wavelength absorption band typical of ZnPc compounds having an absorption peak around 680, 678 and 679 nm for TAZnPc1, TAZnPc2 and TAZnPc3, respectively. The corresponding emission maximum were observed at 691, 687 and 688 nm and assigned to the S1→S0 transitions, showing only a small Stokes shift. All the dyes studied exhibit very similar spectroscopic features, signifying that the electronic structure of the ZnPc moiety is not perturbed by introduction of the substituent at the peripheral positions. In this respect, TAZnPc1, TAZnPc2 and TAZnPc3 are appropriate models to examine the effect of dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface and electron injection/recombination dynamics, while conserving the electronic properties of the ZnPc ring.

The fluorescence decay (Fig. 2b) of all TAZnPc derivatives fits with single-exponential with a lifetime of around 3 ns. It should be noted here that the condition for an efficient electron-injection process at the dye/TiO2 interface in DSSC is that electron injection should be very fast (0.1–100 ps) relative to the excited-state decay to the ground state (1–20 ns). Hence, the observed excited-state decay for TAZnPc (3 ns) hopefully favours the electron-injection process to the TiO2 surface. Moreover, the excited-state oxidation potential of TAZnPc1, 2 and 3 was found to be −1.06, −1.02 and −1.04 eV respectively, indicating that the excited state of TAZnPc derivatives has enough driving force to inject an electron into the conduction band of TiO2. On the other hand, after the excitation, no photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the dithiol moiety (an electron donor) to the ZnPc ring was observed, revealing no excited-state deactivation by substituents. The transient absorption spectra (Fig. 2c) of the TAZnPc derivatives show the broad absorption from 400 to 600 nm, corresponding to the characteristic triplet–triplet absorption, and decayed with a lifetime of 82, 91 and 107 μs at 500 nm for TAZnPc1, 2 and 3 respectively (Fig. 2d). The tetra-substituted TAZnPc shows a longer triplet lifetime than those of the mono-substituted derivatives. Moreover, the lower singlet quantum yield and higher triplet quantum yield of tetra-substituted TAZnPc is observed. This can be explained by the number of carbonyl groups, which enhances the n–π* character of the TAZnPc absorption, the presence of which in turn increases in intersystem crossing efficiency.32,33 In our earlier report, similar findings were obtained for other ZnPc derivatives.26
4.2. Photophysics of functionalized materials in DMF
In order to understand the aggregation behavior and electron-transfer dynamics of ZnPc molecules on nanoparticle surfaces, detailed photophysical analysis of the functionalized materials was carried out. The aggregation of ZnPc on the metal nanoparticle surface was analyzed from steady-state absorption spectral studies. Fig. 3a and 3b show the absorption spectra of TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles. Comparing the absorption spectra of free TAZnPc with functionalized materials in solution, the functionalized materials show the characteristic surface plasmon absorption (Au, 530 nm; Ag, 490 nm).20,34 The absorption maximum at 679 nm corresponds to the Q-band absorption of TAZnPc, which shifts towards the red region (∼10 nm) when functionalized on Au and Ag nanoparticles. The observed red shift is assigned to J-aggregation of TAZnPc on the nanoparticle surface. Generally, the absorption around 630 nm for ZnPc is assigned to H-aggregation,26 hence the observed 630 nm absorption corresponds to the H-aggregation of TAZnPc on the nanoparticle surface.

The broad surface plasmon absorption of the functionalized materials is due to interaction of the dithiol moiety on the surface of the nanoparticle. In general, the chemical interactions of the ligand with the metal nanoparticle alter the electron density of the nanoparticles, thereby directly affecting the absorption of the surface-bound chromophore and dampening and broadening29,35 of the surface plasmon absorption. Presence of H- and J-aggregation of TAZnPc on the nanoparticle surface indicates the close packing of TAZnPc on the Au and Ag nanoparticle surface. Close packing of the dye molecules on the surface of nanoparticles often results in aggregation.36
The flexible linker (thioctic acid) between the nanoparticle and the ZnPc provides a topographical control37 on the inter-molecular interactions in the three-dimensional array, resulting in the formation of H and J aggregates. The length of the spacer (alkyl chain) between the ZnPc ring and the anchoring group also influences the extent of J-aggregation on the nanoparticle surface. Earlier, we observed a lower J-aggregation on the TiO2 surface for ZnPc26 having no alkyl chain between the ZnPc ring and the anchoring group, which reveals that am increase in the spacer length increases the J-aggregation.
The spectral shift in the Q-band absorption of TAZnPc derivatives is due to the formation of aggregation alone on the nanoparticle surface. Since the use of a long chain as spacer between the chromophore and nanoparticle,29 this denies the possible interaction between the plasmon electrons of the nanoparticle and the π-electron cloud of the TAZnPc core. It is difficult to estimate the extent of H-aggregation, due to the overlapping of broad surface plasmon absorption of metal nanoparticles at 630 nm (Fig. 3a and 3b). It should be noted here that the J-aggregation is observed for all TAZnPc-functionalized metal nanoparticles. In addition, the tendency for J-aggregation of TAZnPc on Ag nanoparticles is higher than with Au nanoparticles, as a result of a large red shift in the Q-band region. The larger extent of J-aggregation on the silver nanoparticle surface is due to the irregular spherical shape of the nanoparticles. The aggregation behavior of ZnPc-functionalized materials in DMF is visualized in Scheme 3a. In summary, from the absorption spectral studies, it is clear that there is a binding of ZnPc on the metal surface and it can be utilized as a light-harvesting antenna in the region of 450–800 nm.

Further fluorescence spectral studies were carried out for understanding the electron/energy transfer process of the functionalized materials. The fluorescence spectra of TAZnPc-functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles (Fig. 3c and 3d) show a maximum at 690 nm and the fluorescence intensity was quenched with respect to TAZnPc in DMF. In general, direct binding of a chromophore to the metal nanoparticle surface often results in the quenching of the excited states. Both energy-transfer and electron-transfer processes are considered major deactivation pathways for excited chromophore-functionalized materials.38 The condition for an efficient energy transfer process is that the emission of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor should overlap.39 But literature available indicates that the surface plasmon of metal nanoparticles acts as an energy acceptor40 in chromophore-functionalized materials; however, in the present case spectral overlap of the TAZnPc emission with the surface plasmon absorption of Au (∼530 nm) and Ag (∼490 nm) nanoparticles is not possible and the probability of energy transfer is neglected.23 Since metallic nanoparticles are more electronegative than bulk metals,20 the electron-transfer process is most preferred. On the other hand, it is well known that the ZnPc derivatives are good electron donors41 and the gold39 and silver42 nanoparticles are acceptors. As we discussed above, in the present system (ZnPc-functionalized materials) excited-state deactivation does not arise from energy transfer. So, the observed fluorescence quenching is ascribed to electron injection from TAZnPc to the Au and Ag nanoparticles.
Involvement of the electron-transfer process can be further verified by using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. The fluorescence of TAZnPc in solution at its emission maximum, on excitation at 635 nm, shows a single-exponential decay. However, ZnPc-functionalized materials show a bi-exponential decay, i.e. short-lived and long-lived components (Fig. 3e and 3f) were observed for all the ZnPc-functionalized materials. The decay constants are given in Table 2. The short-lived component is assigned to the ZnPc-functionalized metal nanoparticles and the long-lived component is assigned to free ZnPc molecules (non-injecting ZnPc molecules). The obtained fluorescence lifetime values for the ZnPc-functionalized materials are shorter when compared with ZnPc in solution. The shorter fluorescence lifetime is entirely due to the electron-injection process.

Moreover, the difference between the excited-state oxidation potential of TAZnPc (ca. −1 eV) is much higher than the Fermi level of Au (ca. 0.5 eV)20 and Ag (ca. 0.45 eV)43 which provides enough driving force for the electron-injection process. The calculated thermodynamic parameters are shown in Table 3. This table clearly reveals that the driving force for electron injection is more spontaneous than electron recombination.

Further, the rate of electron injection can be calculated by using the following expression, ket = 1/τads − 1/τfree(4)The calculated ket values are listed in Table 4. A faster electron-injection rate was observed for TA (thioctic acid) directly connected to the ZnPc core (TAZnPc1) than through the phenoxy-substituted derivatives (TAZnPc2 and 3). This reveals that the presence of the phenoxy group may retard the electron-injection efficiency. An unsymmetrical ZnPc with three tert-butyl and one carboxylic groups that can act as push and pull groups, respectively, has been previously reported.16,17 To enhance the electronic coupling between the ZnPc core and TiO2 surface, the carboxylic group was directly linked to the ZnPc core and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.5%. In the present work, TA was directly attached to the ZnPc core in TAZnPc1, which provides efficient electronic coupling with the metal nanoparticle, resulting in faster electron injection than for the other ZnPc derivatives. Comparatively the rate of electron injection (Table 4) was faster on the gold nanoparticle surface than for the silver nanoparticle. This is due to the greater aggregation tendency of TAZnPc derivatives on the silver nanoparticle than on that of the gold nanoparticle.

We have employed the nanosecond transient absorption technique in order to probe the electron-transfer product. If electron injection takes place from the excited state of ZnPc to the metal nanoparticles, subsequently the radical cation of ZnPc should be detected by using this technique. In order to probe the formation of the radical cation, we have recorded the transient absorption spectra of ZnPc-functionalized materials upon excitation at 355 nm. The transient absorption spectra of all the ZnPc derivatives on metal nanoparticles (Fig. 4a and 4b) show similar absorption features. The absorption maximum observed at 600 nm for TAZnPc-functionalized gold and silver nanoparticles is assigned to the radical cation of TAZnPc. Generally, the radical cation of metallophthalocyanines12,14,17 absorbs between 480 and 840 nm. So, the maximum at 600 nm for TAZnPc-functionalized gold and silver nanoparticles is assigned to the radical cation of TAZnPc.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra of (a) TAZnPc/GNP in DMF and (b) TAZnPc/SNP in DMF at 1 μs, excitation at 355 nm; decay trace at 600 nm for (c) TAZnPc/GNP and (d) TAZnPc/SNP. 
It is important to note that the bleaching corresponding to the surface plasmon absorption of nanoparticles44 was not observed. This is due to the strong and broad radical cation absorption in this spectral region. The contribution of the triplet–triplet absorption of the non-injecting molecule was indistinguishable from the strong radical cation absorption. The transient absorption decay monitored at 600 nm for all three derivatives on gold and silver nanoparticles (Fig. 4c and 4d) and the decay constants are listed in Table 2. Faster electron–cation recombination was observed on gold nanoparticles than on the silver nanoparticles (Table 4). The rate of electron–cation recombination is three orders of magnitude lower than electron injection, which clearly reveals that electron injection is the dominant process in these ZnPc-functionalized materials. Moreover, the calculated ΔGrec values are less negative, meaning that the electron–cation recombination is less spontaneous.
4.3. Photophysics of functionalized materials on TiO2 film
The TA-modified functionalized materials do not not alter the photophysics of the bare functionalized materials, which allows us to compare the photophysics of ZnPc-functionalized materials in DMF and on TiO2 film. The ZnPc-functionalized materials on the TiO2 film show the Q-band absorption, surface plasmon absorption and TiO2 band edge absorption. The Q-band absorption of TAZnPc1, 2 and 3 was observed at 692, 692 and 685 nm and at 692, 693 and 685 nm (Fig. 5a and 5b) for functionalized Au and Ag nanoparticles respectively on the TiO2 film. The peak at 630 nm was not observed for functionalized materials on the TiO2 surface, which indicates the absence of H-aggregation for TAZnPc. Because the presence of TA between the ZnPc molecules on the nanoparticle surface prevents the face-to-face contact, furthermore the covalent linking of functionalized materials on the TiO2 film restricts the free mobility of the functionalized materials. The above experimental observations clearly explain the absence of H-aggregation on the TiO2 film. The only possible communication between the dye molecules is sideways overlap, which leads to J-aggregation. The aggregation behavior of ZnPc-functionalized materials on TiO2 film is visualized in Scheme 3b.
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of (a) TAZnPc/GNP/TiO2 film, and (b) TAZnPc/SNP/TiO2 film; emission spectra of (λex. 620 nm) (c) TAZnPc/GNP in DMF and on TiO2 film, and (d) TAZnPc/SNP in DMF and on TiO2 film; fluorescence decay of (λex. 635 nm) (e) TAZnPc/GNP in DMF and on TiO2 film, and (f) TAZnPc/SNP in DMF and on TiO2 film. 
When comparing TAZnPc3 with TAZnPc1 and 2-functionalized materials on the TiO2 film, the former shows a mild red shift of the Q-band absorption, which means that the TAZnPc3-functionalized material forms lesser J-aggregation on the TiO2 film. Multiple anchoring is the reason for this lower J-aggregation (6 nm red shift) in TAZnPc3. The surface plasmon absorption of the both metal nanoparticles is red shifted on the TiO2 film when compared with solution. The red shift of the surface plasmon is due to the change in dielectric environment of the nanoparticles, when moving from DMF (ε = 36.71) to the TiO2 film (ε = 85). An earlier report shows that an increase in the dielectric constant of the environment shifts the surface plasmon absorption to the lower energy.45
Moreover, the fluorescence of ZnPc-functionalized materials on the TiO2 film is not detected (Fig. 5c and 5d), which is due to the efficient electron injection from the ZnPc-functionalized materials to the TiO2 film. Further, time-resolved fluorescence studies also result in complete fluorescence quenching (Fig. 5e and 5f). This is due to increased acceptor sites (TiO2) and also due to the presence of metal nanoparticles, which mediate or shuttle20 electrons from the ZnPc core to the terminal acceptor TiO2 surface, thus aiding the faster electron injection. In other words, the efficient electron injection from TAZnPc to the TiO2 surface was assisted by metal nanoparticles acting as electron mediators. Here, it is important to compare the electron-transfer process from TAZnPc to TiO2 without metal NPs and to understand the influence of the metal NPs on the overall electron-transfer process. However, it is not possible to covalently link the TAZnPc molecules on the TiO2 surface due the lack of COOH groups. So, we can compare our previously published series of ZnPc molecules on the TiO2 surface26 with TAZnPc. Both TAZnPc and ZnPc molecules have similar singlet lifetimes, since the substituent cannot alter the photophysical properties. Overall, the injection rate of ZnPc26 on TiO2 is 1.0 × 1011 s−1; TAZnPc on the metal surface is 10 × 109 s−1 and on the metal–TiO2 hybrid is very fast – we were not able to detect this with our instrument, since the instrument response function is <200 ps. This clearly indicates that the metal nanoparticle shuttle electrons to the TiO2 surface.
5. Conclusion
In the present work, symmetrical and unsymmetrical dithiol-substituted Zn-phthalocyanine derivatives were synthesized and functionalized on Au and Ag nanoparticles. The absorption spectral studies of TAZnPc-functionalized materials in DMF and on a TiO2 film give a clear picture of ZnPc aggregation. The UV-vis absorption study reveals that both H- and J-aggregation was present on the metal nanoparticle surface, whereas on the TiO2 film no H-aggregation was observed. In addition, the fluorescence of ZnPc-functionalized materials is very weak, due to electron transfer from the ZnPc core to the metal nanoparticle. Faster electron injection was observed for thioctic acid directly attached (TAZnPc1) to the ZnPc core. This electron injection was further confirmed by identifying the ZnPc radical cation in the transient absorption spectral studies. Moreover, complete fluorescence quenching was observed for the functionalized materials on the TiO2 film, due to the metal nanoparticle shuttling electrons from the ZnPc core to the TiO2 surface as a result of efficient electron injection. The present study clarified the aggregation behavior and electron injection/recombination dynamics in newly developed ZnPc materials. The present investigation opens up a new way to develop H-aggregation-free Zn-phthalocyanine-based devices covering the broad spectral region.
