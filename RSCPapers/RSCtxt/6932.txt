    , Accepted 6th April 2022First published on 6th April 2022AbstractSn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great advantages as capable alternatives to poisonous Pb-based PSCs, with impressive certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) beyond 14%. However, their poor stability induced by oxidation has hindered the further development of Sn-based PSCs. Herein, through first-principles calculations, inorganic layered Aurivillius-type Sn-based halide perovskites Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I/Br/Cl) have been designed, in which the [Ba2X2] layer blocks the oxygen in air, enhancing the inoxidizability of the crystals.

Consequently, the optimized single-junction SnO2/Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10]/CuSbS2 shows a record PCE of 27.7% among Sn-based PSCs, beyond the champion PCE of Pb-based PSCs (25.5%). These energetic results provide a new perspective to improve the performance of Sn-based single-junction PSCs and give a potential alternative to bottom/top PSCs in tandem devices.
1 Introduction
Pb-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as the most promising third-generation photovoltaic devices, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 25.5%, which are comparable with those of state-of-the-art silicon solar cells.1,2 In general, the good performance of Pb-based PSCs benefits from the impressive optical and electronic properties, such as the suitable band gap (1.5–1.6 eV), strong visible-light harvesting (∼105 cm−1) and long carrier lifetime, as well as great defect tolerance.3–6 Unfortunately, Pb-based perovskites tend to release the poisonous degradation product PbX2 (X = I, Br, Cl), which is harmful to human nervous and reproductive systems.7 The toxicity of Pb compounds significantly limits the mass production and commercial application of Pb-based PSCs.
To overcome the toxicity of the Pb-based PSCs, Pb-free perovskite materials based on tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), bismuth (Bi), and antimony (Sb) have been proposed and aroused widespread interest. Among them, Sn-based PSCs show the best performance, because of the similar long-pair s valence electrons and ionic radius of Sn2+ to those of Pb2+.8,9 Compared with Pb-based perovskites, Sn-based perovskites have smaller band gaps (∼1.3 eV),10 in the range of the Shockley–Queisser limit (1.10–1.44 eV),11 giving rise to higher ultimate PCEs theoretically. The first reported Pb-free Sn2+-containing PSC was based on CsSnI3 in 2012.12 Hao et al. further optimized the band gaps of MASnI3−xBrx perovskites from 1.30 to 2.15 eV and constructed a state-of-the-art architecture of FTO/TiO2/MASnIBr2/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au with a PCE of 5.7%.10 Recently, Liu et al. used a templated-growth technique to grow crystal FASnI3, significantly improving the efficiency up to 11.23%.13 Shortly afterwards, Yu et al. developed the two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure, and the PSC achieved a champion PCE of 14.03%.14 The relatively high PCEs of Sn-based PSCs indicate a great potential for future applications.
Poor stability is the main factor constraining the development of Sn-based PSCs. The first challenge is that Sn2+ cations in perovskite are easily oxidized to Sn4+ in ambient atmosphere. The defects induced by the oxidation of Sn2+ tend to produce deep defect and trap states, finally leading to a large charge recombination rate and a short carrier lifetime.8,15,16 These defects can form in the interior and on the surface of the perovskite crystal grains. For the former, maintaining a Sn-rich chemical environment with Sn halides (SnX2) is an effective approach to reduce the formation energy of Sn vacancies inside.17–19 When Sn atoms are exposed on the lattice surface, their unsaturated dangling bonds can easily absorb oxygen molecules, which intensifies the oxidation process (Sn2+ → Sn4+) and the formation of Sn vacancy defects. In order to block the oxygen molecules, passivators like Lewis base molecules and ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) can be added in the perovskite synthesis process. For example, Han et al. used SnF2/SnCl2/EDAI2 to passivate Sn-based perovskite films, as well as to establish a Sn triple halide amorphous layer, which effectively blocked the outside moisture and oxygen and enhanced the PSC performance.20 From the aspect of the constituent structure, organic–inorganic Sn-based perovskites also decompose easily upon exposure to light, temperature and humidity for a long time.8 Compared with organic–inorganic perovskites, the inorganic perovskites CsSnX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) have better thermal stability.21,22 CsSnI3 PSCs showed long-term stability for more than 240 h, which was much better than that of MAPbI3 (<72 h),21 and the passivated one even had a prolonged lifetime, with over 90% of the initial PCE remaining after 500 h of continuous illumination.22
Furthermore, synthesizing a layered structure is also an effective way to protect Sn-based perovskites from oxidation and decomposition, improving the stability of PSCs. Liao et al. found that the PEA2SnI4 layered perovskite had a significantly decreased decomposition enthalpy for the oxidation reaction, compared with that of the traditional FASnI3 perovskite.23 Cao et al. used the Ruddlesden–Popper (RP)-type perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 (n = 4) as the absorber in PSCs, in which the PCE was reduced by only 10% in the moisture and the air after one month.24 In addition, layered perovskites have a variety of additional advantages, such as their diverse chemical ratios, widely tunable band gaps and improved defect tolerance.25–27 Generally, the layered perovskites can be divided into five groups, i.e., RP-type , Dion–Jacobson (DJ)-type A′[An−1BnX3n+1], 111-type , 110-type AnBnX3n+2 and Aurivillius (AV)-type .28,29 Here, A′ and A represent 8- and 12-coordinated organic or inorganic cations, respectively, B is the 6-coordinated metal cation with various valence states, and X is the halogen or chalcogen anion. To the best of our knowledge, there have been lots of studies about RP-, DJ-, and 111-type halide PSCs.24,30–32 On the contrary, the investigation into AV-type halide perovskites is tentative and quite limited research on Pb (Sn, Ge)-, Bi-, and In-based halide perovskites in the AV structure has been done.33
In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to design a series of inorganic layered AV-type Sn-based halide perovskites, Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl), with favourable structural stability and enhanced inoxidizability. We focus mainly on the photovoltaic applications of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] and find that they have ideal direct band gaps of 0.84–2.20 eV, satisfying the requirements for single- and multi-junction PSCs. Based on the k·p model, a quantificational relationship between the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect and the conduction band edge in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] is uncovered. Furthermore, as the best candidate of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] exhibits an ideal band gap (1.26 eV), high carrier mobility (135–173 cm2 V−1 s−1), high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and desirable estimated PCE (27.7%), indicating a great potential for photovoltaic applications. Our studies will provide an effective strategy to improve the performance of Sn-based single-junction PSCs and give a potential alternative to bottom/top PSCs in tandem devices.
2 Calculation methods
The main calculations are carried out based on density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).34,35 The electron–ion potential is described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.36 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to approximate the electron exchange and correlation potentials.37 A 11 × 11 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh38 is employed to sample the Brillouin zone for self-consistent calculations. The kinetic energy cutoff is set to 520 eV during all calculations. The convergence tolerances of the energy and force are smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. Considering that the normal DFT-PBE calculations usually seriously underestimate the band gap of semiconductors, we revise the band gap of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl) by using the HSE06 method (a mixture of 0.25 Hartree–Fock exchange and 0.75 PBE exchange functional).39
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and stability
Generally, the Sn-based AV halide perovskites have a common structural formula of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl), in which n is the layer number of perovskite-like sheets. Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites belong to the tetragonal crystal system, with a space group symmetry of I4/mmm and a point group symmetry of D4h. When n = 1, the perovskite-like sheet only consists of corner-sharing [SnX6] octahedra, while for n ≥ 2, Cs cations occupy the space between [SnX6] octahedra (see Fig. 1a). Distinguished from other layered perovskites, AV perovskite has a unique  layer structure, in which A′2+/3+ is a metal cation, like Bi3+ and Pb2+, and X−/2− is an inorganic anion, like O2−, F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−. We note that the Ba derivative Ae2Sb2X4F2 with a similar [Ba2F2] layer structure has been fabricated,40 and we thus select Ba2+ as A′2+ in  structure. For n ≥ 2, [SnX6] is distorted along the c-direction, due to the inconsistency of its environment on both sides. A characteristic angle θ (∠Sn–X–Sn) is defined to reflect this distortion (see Fig. 1b), and the more θ deviates from 180°, the greater the distortion of the octahedron. The lattice parameters a and c (see Fig. 1a) and twist angle θ of Sn-based AV halide perovskites are summarized in Table S1.† The X-ray-diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ba2I2[SnI4] and other AV phases are calculated with the use of VESTA,41 in which the radiation wavelength is chosen to be 1.5418 Å (Cu Kα) (see Fig. 1c and S1–S3†).

Type 1 suggests that the [Ba2I2] layer is exposed to surface, while in the other two cases, the perovskite-like sheet is outside. Type 1 is the most stable morphology under I-rich case. 
To confirm the stability of the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites, we first calculate two empirical parameters, i.e., the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ, which are defined as  and μ = RB/RX, respectively, where RA, RB and RX are the ionic radii of the A, B and X ions, respectively. Generally, a halide perovskite structure can be formed in the range of 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 1.1 and 0.44 ≤ μ ≤ 0.90.42 Our calculated Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor 0.817 ≤ t ≤ 0.831 and octahedral factor 0.523 ≤ μ ≤ 0.635 (see Fig. 1d) clearly indicate that the designed Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites are crystallographically stable. Beyond the classic tolerance factor, some new tolerance factors have been developed to predict the stability of perovskites.43,44 Based on the new tolerance factor (τ) defined in ref. 44, τ < 4.18 indicates that the crystal is perovskite with a high overall accuracy of 92%, and there are a few perovskites existing with τ in the range of 4.18–4.30 as well.44 The calculated τ for the Cl-, Br-, and I-based AV perovskites are 3.86, 3.99, and 4.21, respectively (see Fig. S4a†), within the range τ < 4.30, confirming the stability of the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites again.
To evaluate the thermodynamic stability, we also calculate the formation energies, Ef, of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], and compare them with those of the typical halide perovskite MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) and several other layered materials (see Fig. S4b†). The formation energy is defined as Ef = (EBa2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] − kEBa − lECs − mESn − nEX)/(k + l + m + n), where EBa2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] represents the total energy of the AV halide perovskite, while EBa, ECs, ESn, and EX are the total energies of Ba, Cs, Sn, and X in their single crystal phases, respectively, and k, l, m, and n are the corresponding atom numbers. Hence, the more negative the Ef is, the more stable the compound is. The formation energies of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] are in the range of −1.18 to −0.76, −1.60 to −1.41, and −1.88 to −1.66 eV per atom for X = I, Br and Cl, respectively, which are smaller than those of MAPbI3 (−0.51 eV per atom) and InSe (−0.52 eV per atom), and comparable with those of MoS2 (−1.20 eV per atom)45 and Ga2S3(−1.05 eV per atom). The negative Ef values in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] confirm that the designed Sn-based AV halide perovskites are thermodynamically stable.
Furthermore, we calculate the elastic constants Cij of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (see Table S2†) to study their mechanical stability. Apart from Ba2Cl2[Cs2Sn3Cl10], the elastic constants Cij of the other Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] satisfy the Born stability of C11 > |C12|, 2C132 < C33(C11 + C12), C44 > 0, and C66 > 0. Therefore, except for Ba2Cl2[Cs2Sn3Cl10], the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites are mechanically stable.
Moreover, the oxidation stability (the oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+) is another challenge for Sn-based perovskite films.8 The Sn-oxidation suppression can be enhanced significantly by optimizing the surface structure, which inhibits the contact between Sn2+ and the air.20 Therefore, we take Ba2I2[SnI4] as an example to investigate the different surface morphologies along the c direction.46 Firstly, we model the surfaces of Ba2I2[SnI4] crystal by the “slab” approach, in which a vacuum region (>20 Å) is inserted in the periodic supercell lattice (see Fig. 1e). According to previous reports,47 there are four possible c-axis-oriented surface morphologies for AV perovskites, two of which are perovskite-protected, and the rest are perovskite-exposed. We select three types with relatively low surface energies, as shown in Fig. 1e. For type 1, the surface is dominated by I atoms, thus it is hard to oxidize the inner perovskite-like sheets directly. Meanwhile, the surface of type 2 is terminated by the I and Sn atoms of perovskite octahedra. As Sn2+ is likely oxidized to Sn4+, this surface is not stable in the air. Type 3 is a typical surface morphology of a 3D Sn-based perovskite crystal,8,22 on which I defects are easily formed and further undercoordinated Sn2+ ions are exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere. Then, we calculated the relationship between the surface energies of these three types and the chemical potential of I. In Fig. 1e, the surface energy of type 1 is much lower than those of type 2 and type 3 under the I-rich case, meaning that type 1 is the most stable morphology in the case of rich I ions. This structure could effectively block the outside oxygen and moisture. The protection mechanism has also been reported in Bi2O2[WO4], a typical AV perovskite oxide, where the exposed surface atoms are O atoms from Bi–O groups, especially under the O-rich case.47 We also simulate the surface energy of Ba2Br2[SnBr4] (see Fig. S5a†) and find that AV halide perovskites have a similar dependence between the surface energy and the environmental conditions. To further consider the effect of the perovskite layer number n and distortion, the surface energy of Ba2I2[CsSn2I7] is given in Fig. S5b.† Due to the increase of the perovskite-like sheet n, we consider a new surface morphology, type 4 (see Fig. S5b†). The calculation result shows that the surface energy of type 1 is the lowest under the I-rich case. The type 1 structure of Ba2I2[CsSn2I7] is thus the most stable morphology in the case of rich I ions. Therefore, the [Ba2X2] layer in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites could cover the perovskite-like sheet, preventing Sn2+ cations from contacting external oxygen and enhancing the inoxidizability of the perovskites.
3.2 Electronic structure
We first study the electronic structures of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites in Fig. 2a and S6.†Fig. 2a shows the band structure and the projected density of states (PDOS) of Ba2I2[SnI4]. It shows a desired direct band gap of 0.89 eV, with both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the S (0.5, 0.5, 0) point. The dispersion of the band edge is similar to that of the RP cubic phase (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2SnI4,48 because of the same point group DD4h. More details about the constituents of the band edges can be found in the PDOS. The conduction band edge of Ba2I2[SnI4] is almost dominated by the p orbital of Sn, and the valence band edge originates mainly from the hybridization states of the s orbital of Sn and p orbital of I. The Ba cations almost do not contribute to the band-edge states. These spatial distributions are more evident in the partial charge density isosurfaces for VBM and CBM, shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The spatial atomic orbital contributions of band edges in Ba2I2[SnI4] are very common in halide perovskites, such as MAPbI3 and CsPbI3. We further demonstrate the SOC effect in the band structure of Ba2I2[SnI4] more specifically in the right of Fig. 2a. We find that the SOC effect does not modify the valence bands, but splits the two lowest conduction bands, resulting in a band gap reduction of 0.24 eV. This reduction associated with the Sn atom is much smaller than those in Pb-based AV perovskites (0.90 eV) and Bi-based perovskites (0.75 eV)33,49 because of the lighter atomic mass of Sn compared with those of Pb and Bi. Surprisingly, the induced lower conduction band becomes more dispersive, giving rise to a much small electron effective mass of 0.08 m0 along S–X. This similar SOC effect also appears in other Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] crystals. Therefore, we will include the SOC effect for all the electronic structures in this work (see Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 2  (a) Electronic band structure and corresponding PDOS of Ba2I2[SnI4], in which the band gap is 0.89 eV with the SOC effect. It is shown that the SOC effect enhances the dispersion of the conduction band edge remarkably. The inset in the left panel shows the partial density of CBM and VBM in Ba2I2[SnI4]. (b) Direct band gap values of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl; n = 1, 2, 3), indicating that Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] are suitable for single-junction solar cells and Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] (Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1]) are desirable for the bottom (top) cell of multi-junction solar cells. (c) Variation of the band gaps of Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] with the layer number of perovskite-like sheets n, the in-plane lattice constant a and the twist angle of the octahedron θ. (d) Band alignment of our designed halide perovskite absorbers as well as the selected ETLs and HTLs. Here, the vacuum energy level is chosen as the reference and set to 0 eV. 

Fig. 2b summarizes the band gaps of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1]. First of all, they all show desirable direct band gaps at the S point. The direct band gaps of Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] range from 1.26 to 1.58 eV, which are suitable for single-junction solar cells. In particular, Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] has an optimal band gap (1.26 eV) for single-junction solar cells (∼1.33 eV) according to the SQ limit. Meanwhile, Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] (Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1]) have ideal band gaps of 0.84–0.94 eV (1.75–2.20 eV) for the bottom (top) cell of multi-junction solar cells.50,51 Secondly, as the X site goes from higher p orbitals in Cl to lower p orbitals in I, the VBM state containing the p orbitals is pulled up, leading to the band gap reduction accordingly.52 This band gap reduction for the AV perovskite Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] is around 0.55 eV, slightly higher than the reduction of 0.43 eV for the typical perovskite CsPbX3.52 Thirdly, the band gap also depends on the perovskite-like layer thickness n. For I-and Cl-based perovskites, the band gap in n = 2 is abnormally larger than the value in n = 1, which is related to the octahedral distortion effect and lattice stress effect (see Fig. 2c and S7a†). In Fig. 2c, the relaxed lattice constant a is equal to 6.07 and 6.19 Å for Ba2I2[SnI4] (n = 1) and Ba2I2[CsSn2I7] (n = 2) crystals, respectively (see Table S1†). In addition, θ is the twist angle of the octahedron (see Fig. 1b). The blue arrow represents the influence of the quantum confinement effect for the band gap (see Fig. S7b†), which is counteracted exactly by the lattice stress effect (the red arrow). Meanwhile, the octahedral distortion effect further increases the band gap of Ba2I2[CsSn2I7], eventually beyond that of Ba2I2[SnI4]. Ba2Cl2[CsSn2Cl7] is in a similar situation to Ba2I2[CsSn2I7]. However, the octahedral distortion and lattice stress are relatively small for Br-based perovskites (see Table S1†). This is because of the high matching degree between the perovskite layer and [Ba2Br2] layer due to their close lattice parameters. Therefore, the band gaps of Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] decrease monotonically as the perovskite layer thickens, which is consistent with the quantum confinement effect.
Considering that the architecture of typical PSCs includes a metal electrode, hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite absorption layer, electron transport layer (ETL) and transparent electrode, we further compare the band offset between Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] and the ETL/HTL in Fig. 2d. The band alignments of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] are obtained on the basis of the Anderson rule.53 As the X atom changes from Cl to I, the VBM is pulled up, while the CBM is almost unchanged. This is because the VBM is partially occupied by the p orbital of the halide. Moreover, we match the calculated band edge energy levels with those of the ETLs and HTLs, which are measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM).54–59 In order to make the photo-generated carriers separate efficiently, the VBM (CBM) of the HTL (ETL) should be higher (lower) than that of the AV perovskite layer. On one hand, Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br) perovskites have suitable HTLs, which can extract holes from the perovskite layer quickly, while the VBMs of Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1] are too deep to match the HTLs in Fig. 2d. On the other hand, some of the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites have slightly deeper CBMs (−4.8 to −4.7 eV), which are about 0.15 eV below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the ETLs. Fortunately, we can modify the energy levels of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] by adding SnF2, which can reduce the work function of CsSnBr3 by 0.2 eV.60 It is the strong reducibility of SnF2 that directly leads to the electrons transferring to Sn-based perovskites, which will lift up the energy level of the perovskite layer towards the vacuum level.61 Hence, most of the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites can be adopted as favorable solar cell absorbers by selecting suitable ETLs and HTLs.
3.3 The SOC effect
The SOC effect plays an important role in the electronic structures of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], i.e., reducing the band gaps and sharpening the lowest conduction bands, which significantly enhances the performance of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] in photovoltaic devices. Therefore, it is necessary for us to obtain a deeper understanding of the SOC effect in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1]. Here, we take Ba2I2[SnI4] as an example to analyze the band structure at the high symmetry S point through group theory, as shown in Fig. 3a. Since the space group of Ba2I2[SnI4] is I4/mmm, it is possible to directly analyze the irreducible representations at the S point using the D2h point group, which exhibits lower symmetry than that of the D4h point group at the Γ point. Without the SOC effect, the four considered states are correlated with the irreducible representations S1+, S4−, S3−, and S2−, respectively. The two unoccupied states S4− and S3− are not degenerate in symmetry, although they have close energy eigenvalues. After including the SOC effect, the electronic bands preserve the Kramers degeneracy, as a result of the crystal inversion and time-reversal symmetry in the AV structure. Meanwhile, the four irreducible representations transform into doublets of 2D representations of DD2h with the energy shift, exhibiting a typical p orbital response to the SOC effect. For example, the S4− and S3− transform into S5− (S5−) with down and upward movements of 0.24 and 0.07 eV, respectively, which causes a large SO splitting of 0.31 eV and a band reduction of 0.24 eV. Similarly, a large SO splitting (band gap reduction) is observed in other Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] structures.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagrams depicting the SOC effect on the band structure in bulk Ba2I2[SnI4]. (a) The schematic diagram exhibits the band energy based on point group. All energies are shifted to align the VBM, which is dominated by the Sn s orbital and thus is robust to the SOC effect. Energy dispersion (b) without and (c) with the SOC effect obtained by the k · p method (red solid line) is compared with that from DFT calculations (black dotted line). (d) The change of energies of three conduction bands at the S point (0.5, 0.5, 0) with SOC strength λ. 
Because the conduction band edge originates mainly from the p orbital, and the valence band edge is almost dominated by the s, we could describe the VBM and three conduction band states as the basis electronic states s (|S>), px (|X>), py (|Y>), and pz (|Z>) according to the D2h point group, respectively. The Hamiltonian based on these four basis wavefunctions near the band edge could be given (see eqn (S1) in the ESI†) by the k·p method. The resulting k·p model is given by eqn (S1) and Table S3.† Based on the built k·p model, the calculated band structure near the band edge is shown in Fig. 3b, from which one can see a good match between the k·p model and original DFT spectra. When the spin degrees of freedom are included, the basis wavefunctions will translate to four doublets, and the 8-band Hamiltonian reads as Hfull = H + HSOC, where the block-diagonal matrix HSOC and full Hamiltonian Hfull are given by eqn (S2)–(S4) in the ESI.† The fitting SOC strength, λ = 0.24 (see Table S3†), is similar to that of the 3D perovskite CsSnI3.62 In Fig. 3c, we show the relativistic band structure calculated by the k·p method and DFT with the inclusion of the SOC effect, and find that both methods are in agreement with each other. The main effect of the SOC is on the conduction band at the S point. Therefore, the k·p + SOC model can present the energy level shift of the CBM and the dispersion on the conduction band edge.
The conduction band shift can be quantificationally described by the energy eigenvalues of three conduction band states at the S point. The energy eigenvalues of the three conduction bands are given by eqn (S18) and (S19).†Fig. 3d shows that Ecbm, the energy eigenvalue of CBM, monotonically decreases with λ. Therefore, the stronger the SOC effect is, the larger the band gap reduction is. In order to analyze the influence of the SOC effect on band dispersion, we next give the expression of Ecbm in the neighborhood of the CBM. We only discuss the case along the S–Γ path, in which Ecbm only depends on kx. Ecbm therefore can be expressed as a Taylor series expansion of kx, as in eqn (S20).† As we ignore the higher order of kx (O(kx4)), Ecbm is thus a parabolic function of kx near the band edge, in which the dispersion is positively related to the quadratic coefficient. Because λ is relatively small (∼0.24 eV) compared with the band gap Eg, we could take the first order approximation to the quadratic coefficient as follows, (1)which shows that the SOC effect increases the quadratic coefficient and makes the CBM much more dispersive. Then, a small electron effective mass could be expected. Meanwhile, the band gap also affects the quadratic coefficient in eqn (1), which proves that perovskites with a small band gap tend to have sharp band edges and small carrier effective masses (see Fig. 2b and Table 1).

3.4 Carrier mobility
The transport properties of the carriers are crucial for solar cell devices, and mainly depend on the effective mass and mobility of the absorber materials. We first calculate the electron and hole effective masses of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], shown in Table 1. According to eqn (1), the band dispersion of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] is mainly determined by the band gap and SOC strength λ. With the same λ, the smaller the band gap is, the smaller (more dispersive) the carrier effective mass (band dispersion) is. Thus, among the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], the I-based perovskites have the smallest band gap, and possess the smallest carrier effective mass (0.064–0.128 m0) accordingly, which are comparable with that of the star solar cell material MAPbI3 (0.104 m0).63 As for Br- and Cl-based perovskites, their band edges are less dispersive because of their relatively larger band gaps. However, the carrier effective mass (0.121–0.167 of Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] and 0.173–0.337 of Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1]) are still suitable for solar cells. Because of the small carrier effective mass, high carrier mobility can be expected in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1]. We next calculate the carrier mobility at room temperature (T = 300 K), based on the Feynman formula,64 which takes the phonon scattering mechanism into account. The carrier mobilities, μe, μh, and their decisive parameters, i.e., the effective mass  and , the ionic screening parameter, 1/ε*, and the interaction parameter α, are shown in Table 1. The mobility of MAPbX3 is directly taken from ref. 63, and the calculated mobility of MAPbI3 matches the experimental value (165 cm2 V−1 s−1 for single crystals) very well.65 For Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1], they have high carrier mobility, similar to those of the counterparts of MAPbX3 and MoS2.63,66 In particular, the Ba2I2[SnI4] crystal has impressive carrier mobility, i.e., 554 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 739 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes, resulting from the low strength of the interaction between electrons and phonons. The high carrier mobility contributes to accelerating the charge transport and reducing the charge accumulation in Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] PSC devices.
3.5 Interband optical absorption

Fig. 4 shows the interband optical absorption of Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1]. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] have desired optical absorption properties with an absorption coefficient up to 104–105 cm−1 in the whole visible light region and suitable band edge in the range of 1.26–1.58 eV, which are better than those of MAPbI3.69 Following the method of ref. 70, we calculate the exciton binding energies (∼30 meV) in bulk Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] (see Table S4†), which are similar to that of MAPbI3 (∼44 meV).70 The small exciton effect in practical Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] PSCs can be ignored accordingly. The high absorption coefficient of Sn-based halide perovskites is related to the contribution of Sn long pair s-orbitals, as well as the parity-allowed transitions between band edges. The transitions between band edges of Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] are clearly indicated in Fig. 4b, where a peak moment appears at the S-point. This is beneficial to interband optical absorption. We thus give the orbital characters of the VBM and CBM for Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] in Fig. 4c. The VBM is mainly determined by the Br p orbitals and Sn s orbitals, while the CBM is dominated by Sn p orbitals with a small contribution from the Br s orbitals. According to Fermi’s Golden Rule, a Sn s → p transition, as well as a Br p → s transition, are allowed near the band edge, which effectively enhance the electric dipole transition matrix elements and the optical absorption strength. The high optical absorption and allowed transitions between band edges can be further verified by symmetry analysis. Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites have DD2h symmetry at the S point (see Fig. 3a), and the wavefunctions of the VBM and CBM belong to the basis functions of the 2D irreducible representations S5+ and S5−, respectively. Both S5+ and S5− functions have opposite parity, leading to the non-zero electric dipole transition matrix elements. Therefore, electrons near the band edge are able to make electric dipole transitions by absorbing light. For the same reason, strong light harvesting intensity also appears in Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] and Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1] (see Fig. S8a†). In addition, considering their suitable absorption edges, 0.84–0.94 eV for Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] and 1.75–2.20 eV for Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1], they are suitable for the bottom and top cells of all-perovskite tandem solar cells, respectively.

3.6 Theoretical PCE
Because of the appropriate band gaps, high carrier mobilities, excellent optical properties and relatively small exciton binding energies, Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] could be capable absorbers for solar cell devices. Therefore, we calculate their spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME), which is a popular method to estimate the maximum PCE in solar cells. SLME is more reliable than the SQ limit, because the optical absorption spectrum and the thickness of the absorption layer are considered in the process of calculation. Fig. 5a and S8b† show the relationship between the SLME and the thickness of crystals for Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites, compared with that of MAPbI3 (black line).69 Since Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] crystals have strong visible light harvesting intensity (see Fig. 4a and S8a†), the SLMEs increase more rapidly than those of MAPbI3, meaning that Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] PSC devices are more flexible for their size. Notably, the SLMEs of Ba2Br2[SnBr4], Ba2Br2[CsSn2Br7] and Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] reach 29.1%, 31.9%, and 31.9% at 1 μm, respectively, which are similar to that of MAPbI3 (∼30%). In order to have a better understanding of the SLMEs of Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1], we further investigate their J–V characteristics in Fig. 5b and S8c and d,† where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc represents the short-circuit current density, d is the thickness of the absorber, Pm = Jm × Vm denotes the maximum power density, and FF is the fill factor. It is observed that the high SLME of the Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] crystal (31.9% at a thickness of 1 μm) is derived from the large Jsc (35.9 mA cm−2), Voc (1.00 V) and relatively high FF (88.7%).

The large short-circuit current density Jsc (35.9 mA cm−2) and open-circuit voltage Voc (1.00 V) lead to a high PCE (31.9%). (c) A schematic illustration of an actual Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] PSC with an ETL and HTL of SnO2 and CuSbS2, respectively. (d) The J–V curve and the key parameters of the Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] PSC simulated by applying the wxAMPS code. The inset of (d) shows that Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] has a suitable band alignment with the selected ETL and HTL. 
To study the performance of Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10], the best candidate of the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites, in a more realistic situation, we further use the wxAMPS code to simulate a SnO2/Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10]/CuSbS2 junction, which is the core part of an actual PSC, as shown in Fig. 5c. Among them, the perovskite Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10], SnO2, and CuSbS2 are the solar absorber, ETL, and HTL, respectively, which have a suitable band alignment, and the electrons (holes) can be extracted easily to the ETL (HTL) (see Fig. 5d). Fig. 5d gives the J–V characteristics of the Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] PSC. Strikingly, the estimated PCE of the Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] PSC can reach 27.7%, beyond the champion PCE of Pb-based PSCs (25.5%) (please refer to Table S5† for detailed simulation parameters). The high PCE indicates that the Sn-based AV halide perovskite Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] could play an important role in lead-free PSCs. Although Cl- and I-based perovskites have very desirable band gaps for all-perovskite tandem solar cells, we have not simulated the Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1]–Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] devices, because the VBMs of Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1] are too deep to match the HTLs in Fig. 2d.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a series of inorganic layered AV-type Sn-based halide perovskites Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl), and systemically studied their structural, electronic, transport, and optical properties based on first-principles calculations. The excellent photovoltaic properties of the proposed Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] can be summarized as follows. (1) There are no toxic elements in our materials, which means that the Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] perovskites are environmentally friendly. (2) Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] have good thermal and mechanical stability, and the inoxidizability of Sn2+ has been improved owing to the [Ba2X2] layers in the AV structures. (3) The direct band gaps (0.84–2.20 eV) for Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] can satisfy the requirements for single- and multi-junction solar cells. The spin–orbit coupling effects on the band gap reduction and band edge dispersion have been described quantitatively by an effective model. (4) The carrier effective mass is as low as 0.06 m0, and the carrier mobility is up to 739 cm2 V−1 s−1 accordingly. (5) Their visible-light absorption coefficients are comparable to that of MAPbI3, and reach a maximum of 3 × 105 cm−1. (6) The SLMEs of Ba2Br2[SnBr4], Ba2Br2[CsSn2Br7], and Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10] are 29.1%, 31.9%, and 31.9%, respectively, similar the that of MAPbI3 (∼30%). (7) The theoretical PCE of single-junction SnO2/Ba2Br2[Cs2Sn3Br10]/CuSbS2 is up to 27.7%, beyond the champion PCE of Pb-based PSCs (25.5%). Hence, the layered AV-type Sn-based halide perovskites Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] provide a brand new perspective to design high-performance single-junction PSC absorbers with optimal band gaps and large PCEs, and to give a potential alternative to bottom/top PSCs in tandem devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Atomic structures of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl; n = 1, 2, 3). (b) For n ≥ 2, the [SnX6] octahedron is distorted along the c-direction. (c) Calculated XRD pattern of bulk Ba2I2[SnI4]. The radiation wavelength is 1.5418 Å (Cu Kα), and several important crystal faces are marked in the form of the Miller indices. (d) The calculated tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ for Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites. (e) Surface energy for three possible surface morphologies of Ba2I2[SnI4]. Type 1 suggests that the [Ba2I2] layer is exposed to surface, while in the other two cases, the perovskite-like sheet is outside. Type 1 is the most stable morphology under I-rich case.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Electronic band structure and corresponding PDOS of Ba2I2[SnI4], in which the band gap is 0.89 eV with the SOC effect. It is shown that the SOC effect enhances the dispersion of the conduction band edge remarkably. The inset in the left panel shows the partial density of CBM and VBM in Ba2I2[SnI4]. (b) Direct band gap values of Ba2X2[Csn−1SnnX3n+1] (X = I, Br, Cl; n = 1, 2, 3), indicating that Ba2Br2[Csn−1SnnBr3n+1] are suitable for single-junction solar cells and Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] (Ba2Cl2[Csn−1SnnCl3n+1]) are desirable for the bottom (top) cell of multi-junction solar cells. (c) Variation of the band gaps of Ba2I2[Csn−1SnnI3n+1] with the layer number of perovskite-like sheets n, the in-plane lattice constant a and the twist angle of the octahedron θ. (d) Band alignment of our designed halide perovskite absorbers as well as the selected ETLs and HTLs. Here, the vacuum energy level is chosen as the reference and set to 0 eV.	 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic diagrams depicting the SOC effect on the band structure in bulk Ba2I2[SnI4]. (a) The schematic diagram exhibits the band energy based on point group. All energies are shifted to align the VBM, which is dominated by the Sn s orbital and thus is robust to the SOC effect. Energy dispersion (b) without and (c) with the SOC effect obtained by the k · p method (red solid line) is compared with that from DFT calculations (black dotted line). (d) The change of energies of three conduction bands at the S point (0.5, 0.5, 0) with SOC strength λ.
