    , Accepted 26th January 2023First published on 28th January 2023AbstractPoly(triarylamine) (PTAA) is a promising hole transport polymer for efficient inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is an indispensable dopant for PTAA. However, the interplay between PTAA and F4TCNQ and its effects on the device operation of PSCs are still unknown. Herein, the fundamental interaction between PTAA and F4TCNQ was systematically studied using a combination of extensive theoretical calculations and detailed experimental approaches. The results reveal that the π–π stacking formed between PTAA and F4TCNQ was favorable for improving the spatial configuration of PTAA and the charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ. Meanwhile, a CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and N–H⋯N hydrogen bond could be built between F4TCNQ and perovskites, substantially improving the quality of perovskite films and the interfacial properties between perovskite and PTAA and thus enhancing hot-carrier injection. Consequently, an inverted PSC fabricated with PTAA doped with F4TCNQ yielded a high efficiency of up to 22.5% and demonstrated high electroluminescence with an external quantum efficiency of 4.6%. Meanwhile, PSCs showed good stability under continuous illumination and thermal conditions. This work offers a deeper understanding of the interplay between the dopant and hole transport polymer and highlights the important design criterion of dopants for hole transport polymers toward the higher photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have attracted significant attention as a class of competitive optoelectronic materials for application in high-performance solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1–5 Along with the great efforts made on the composition engineering of perovskites and interface engineering of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as well as a better understanding of the device physics of PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was largely improved where the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of conventional n-i-p and p-i-n inverted PSCs were greatly boosted to be over 25% and 24%, respectively, which is comparable with silicon solar cells.6–9 Even though the photovoltaic performance of p-i-n inverted PSCs to some extent lags behind that of conventional n-i-p PSCs, the inverted devices possess unique advantages, such as low-temperature manufacturability, negligible hysteresis and compatibility with silicon solar cells or PSCs for the construction of tandem solar cells, further improving their photovoltaic performance.10–13 Notably, the hole transport layer (HTL) that was first deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates is of great importance for the crystallization of uniform perovskite layers, thus improving the charge carrier extraction of inverted PSCs, significantly affecting their photovoltaic performance. Therefore, hole transport materials with high conductivity, easy processing at low temperatures, and good wettability of perovskite precursor solutions are extremely desired for efficient inverted PSCs.
Various hole transport materials, such as metal oxides (NiOx),14–16 small organic molecules,17,18 organic polymers (poly(triarylamine) (PTAA),19–21 poly(4-butylphenyl-diphenylamine) (poly-TPD),22 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)),23,24 have been applied for the construction of inverted PSCs. Among these hole transport materials, PTAA possesses excellent stability, easy processibility and suitable energy levels with perovskites, showing high potential for efficient inverted PSCs.25,26 However, due to the complex steric configuration of the triphenylamine backbone of PTAA, the poor π–π stacking (the stacking between backbones in the direction of π-orbitals of conjugated rings) within the PTAA generally results in unsatisfactory charge mobility. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic characteristic of PTAA and the weak interaction of PTAA and perovskites generally lead to low-quality perovskite films deposited on the PTAA layer, resulting in serious charge carrier recombination at the PTAA/perovskite interface.27,28 As such, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is an indispensable dopant for PTAA to improve the conductivity of PTAA layers and enhance the interfacial properties of PTAA/perovskites, which is very necessary for inverted PSCs with PTAA as the HTL.19,25,29–32 However, the detailed interaction between the dopant F4TCNQ and hole transport PTAA was rarely studied, which could offer more insight into the fundamental interplay between F4TCNQ and PTAA and its effect on the device operation of inverted PSCs. Meanwhile, with a deeper understanding of the mechanism of doping PTAA with F4TCNQ, it will provide important design criteria for hole transport materials and dopants for high-performance optoelectronic devices.
Herein, a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies was conducted to rule out the fundamental interaction between the dopant F4TCNQ and hole transport PTAA and its effect on the device operation of efficient inverted PSCs. Extensive characterization techniques were applied for the PTAA layer doped with F4TCNQ, the results of which reveal that F4TCNQ could form strong π–π stacking with PTAA, facilitating the spatial configuration of PTAA and the charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ. Meanwhile, the CN of F4TCNQ could form a CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and N–H⋯N hydrogen bond with the cations of the perovskite, thereby improving the quality of perovskite films and enhancing the charge carrier extraction at the interface of PTAA/perovskites. As a consequence, an impressive PCE of up to 22.5% with negligible hysteresis was achieved in inverted PSCs fabricated with PTAA-HTL doped with F4TCNQ, and the PSCs showed high electroluminescence with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6%. Meanwhile, the PSCs demonstrated good stability under continuous illumination and thermal conditions. The ultrafast spectroscopy results of perovskite films and the charge carrier dynamics of PSC devices were systemically studied, which confirmed that the remarkable performance of inverted PSCs was ascribed to a combination of the improved spatial configuration of PTAA, suppressed interfacial recombination and high-quality perovskite films, as a result of introducing the dopant F4TCNQ into the PTAA-HTL.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Interaction between PTAA and F4TCNQ

Fig. 1a schematically presents the device architecture of an inverted PSC and a cell with a structure of ITO/PTAA (without and with F4TCNQ)/perovskite (PVK)/6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag was studied in this work. F4TCNQ was applied as a dopant of PTAA to enhance the quality of the PTAA layer and the interfacial properties of PTAA/PVK. According to the electrostatic potential distribution (Fig. S1, ESI†) and charge density distribution (Fig. S2, ESI†), the F4TCNQ molecule possesses an extended π system around the whole molecule, which suggests that F4TCNQ could theoretically form an π–π interaction with PTAA. Therefore, the interaction between PTAA and F4TCNQ was first calculated using first-principles density functional theory calculations, in which the dimer of PTAA (d-PTAA) was applied to simplify the calculations as shown in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that after the structural optimization, the distance between the corresponding carbon atoms in d-PTAA and F4TCNQ was determined to be ∼3.43 Å, indicating that a strong π–π stacking interaction could be formed between the biphenyl of PTAA and the extended π system of F4TCNQ.33 Meanwhile, the interaction energy of the d-PTAA/F4TCNQ system was calculated to be −1.249 eV, suggesting that d-PTAA shows strong interaction with F4TCNQ through the π–π stacking.

F4TCNQ may also affect the geometrical configuration of PTAA through the aforementioned π–π stacking between PTAA and F4TCNQ. Therefore, to obtain more details concerning the topological structures of PTAA affected by F4TCNQ, the geometrical configuration of d-PTAA was further studied before and after interacting with F4TCNQ. As shown in Fig. 1c, the dihedral angle of the optimized structure of individual d-PTAA is calculated to be 31.3°. Such poor backbone planarity may negatively affect the stacking order of PTAA in three-dimensional space, probably resulting in low conductivity of PTAA layers. The trimer of PTAA (t-PTAA) was also optimized to further verify the backbone planarity and the dihedral angle of t-PTAA, which shows similar values compared to that of d-PTAA (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, as hypothesized, after interacting with F4TCNQ, the dihedral angle of d-PTAA in the d-PTAA/F4TCNQ system was largely decreased to be 16.6°, which suggests that the strong π–π stacking interaction formed between PTAA and F4TCNQ largely affects the geometrical configuration of PTAA. To further demonstrate the role of F4TCNQ molecules in the stacking of PTAA chains, the sandwiched topological structure of the d-PTAA/F4TCNQ/d-PTAA system was further studied, and the results show that a similar decrease in the dihedral angle of d-PTAA is obtained (Fig. S4, ESI†). Therefore, during the crystallization of PTAA, F4TCNQ could to a great extent affect the geometrical configuration of the PTAA layer. After interplay with F4TCNQ, an improved molecular arrangement in the PTAA layer can be realized through the π–π stacking interaction. The charge density difference model and Bader charge analysis of the d-PTAA/F4TCNQ system were implemented to obtain more insight into the interaction between d-PTAA and F4TCNQ (Fig. 1d), which reveals that 0.616e can be transferred between d-PTAA and F4TCNQ, and d-PTAA and F4TCNQ acted as the donor and acceptor, respectively.
For comparison with the calculated results and verifying the charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ through the π–π stacking, the PTAA layer without and with the dopant F4TCNQ was characterized in detail. Fig. 1e shows the Raman spectra of the PTAA layer without and with F4TCNQ doped. The Raman peak at around 1607 cm−1 marked with dashed lines is associated with the symmetric stretching vibration of the phenyl ring in PTAA, which shifts down by ∼4 cm−1 for the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer. Such a shift in the Raman spectra indicates partial charge transfer from PTAA to F4TCNQ, leading to reduced π-electron density in the PTAA layer.34 Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) was further employed to directly detect the charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ.35 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the phase evolution as a function of applied voltage bias for the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers deposited on microscopy slides. It can be seen that, after doping PTAA with F4TCNQ, the symmetry axis of the fitted parabola marked with dashed lines shifts to the negative direction, which indicates that partial charge is transferred from PTAA to F4TCNQ molecules. Besides, the results of the recorded absorption spectra of d-PTAA, F4TCNQ and d-PTAA/F4TCNQ systems further prove the charge transfer between d-PTAA and F4TCNQ (Fig. S6, ESI†). Therefore, it can be inferred that the strong π–π stacking interaction and charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ could be assigned to the optimization of the backbone planarity of PTAA, leading to improved geometrical configuration of PTAA. Furthermore, the conductivity of PTAA was also increased after doping with F4TCNQ (Fig. S7, ESI†), which may also be attributed to π–π stacking and charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ.
To further study the molecular arrangement of PTAA dominated by F4TCNQ, the molecular-scale microstructure information of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers was probed using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) as shown in Fig. 1f and g. The ring-like scattering feature with a nearly uniform intensity was observed for PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers, suggesting that probably no preferential crystal orientations were formed in these layers. To obtain more details into the microstructures of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers, the out-of-plane (OOP) direction cut profiles of the layers were extracted from the GIWAXS patterns and the (010) peak was fitted using Gaussian distribution (Fig. 1h).36 The results reveal that the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) value of the PTAA layer shows a slight decrease after doping PTAA with F4TCNQ (from 0.52 Å−1 to 0.48 Å−1), suggesting that benefitting from F4TCNQ, enhanced π–π stacking in the face-on direction of the PTAA layer and more orderly arrangement of PTAA were obtained. Meanwhile, after introducing F4TCNQ into PTAA, the peak position of (010) of PTAA was shifted from 1.51 Å−1 to 1.54 Å−1 in the OOP direction, which demonstrates that a smaller π–π stacking distance in the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer than that in the PTAA layer was achieved in the face-on direction. Based on the above analysis, the proposed schematic diagrams of the microstructure and molecular arrangement of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The enhanced π–π stacking in the OOP direction may be attributed to the increased coplanarity caused by the intensive π–π stacking and the charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ. Generally, the charge carrier mobility along the π–π direction is orders of magnitude larger than that along the lamellar direction.37 Therefore, such an enhanced π–π stacking in the OOP direction will significantly improve the charge carrier mobility in the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer.
Besides, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was conducted to determine the energy levels of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers (Fig. S9, ESI†). The results show that the Fermi level (EF) of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers was determined to be −4.52 and −4.90 eV, respectively. Such an EF shift indicates that the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer exhibits a more p-type nature than the PTAA layer. Besides, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers were calculated to be −5.10 and −5.21 eV, respectively. Therefore, according to the above analysis, the energy levels of the PTAA/perovskite interface were summarized in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Compared with the PTAA layer, the HOMO of the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer is closer to the valence band maximum (EV) of the perovskite, which could lead to a more favorable energy level alignment at the PTAA/perovskite interface, thus facilitating more efficient charge extraction at the PTAA/perovskite interface. Based on the results of the above theoretical calculations and experimental studies, it can be concluded that after doping PTAA with F4TCNQ, the properties of the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer, including coplanarity, microstructural molecular arrangement and charge mobility, were substantially improved through intensive π–π stacking between PTAA and F4TCNQ.
2.2 Interaction between F4TCNQ and perovskites
The incorporation of F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer could not only improve the properties of the PTAA layer but it may also interact with perovskites, affecting the interfacial properties of HTL/PVK. Therefore, the interfacial properties of HTL/PVK induced by F4TCNQ in the PTAA-HTL layer were further studied. Fig. 2a and b present the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films deposited on the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers, respectively, and the corresponding grain size distributions of the perovskites are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Compared to the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA layer, the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer exhibits a slightly larger grain size, underlining the potential effect of F4TCNQ on the nucleation and growth of the perovskites. Moreover, the roughness of the perovskite films deposited on the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ layers was further measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Fig. S12, ESI†), which reveals that the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer presents a smoother morphology than that of the film deposited on the PTAA layer. Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PTAA/PVK and PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples. In comparison with the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA layer, the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer possesses a stronger diffraction intensity in the XRD patterns, indicating an enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film being obtained as a result of introducing F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer. Meanwhile, the light absorption intensity of the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA layer is slightly lower than that of the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer, also confirming the higher quality of perovskite films being obtained (Fig. S14, ESI†).

(h) Schematic illustration of the interface between PTAA+F4TCNQ and perovskite. 
To study the role of F4TCNQ in the charge transport at the PTAA/PVK interface, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out for glass/PVK, glass/PTAA/PVK and glass/PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples. The perovskite film deposited on the F4TCNQ+PTAA layer shows a lower PL intensity than the film deposited on the PTAA layer (Fig. 2c), which reveals that the introduction of F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer leads to a more efficient charge extraction from the perovskites. To further evaluate the charge carrier extraction, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed and the TRPL curves were fitted using a biexponential function (Fig. 2d and Table S1, ESI†). The results show that the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK sample presents a much shorter average PL lifetime (94.74 ns) than the PTAA/PVK sample (283.65 ns), confirming a favorable charge extraction with diminished interfacial recombination in the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK sample compared to that of the PTAA/PVK sample.

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectra were further recorded for F4TCNQ and FAI to understand the interactions between F4TCNQ and perovskites (Fig. 2e and S15, ESI†). It can be seen that the signal peak at 8.82 ppm associated with the amino groups of FAI molecules splits into three peaks (8.63, 8.65 and 8.99 ppm) for the mixture of F4TCNQ and FAI. Such a chemical split of the amino groups in the spectra could be attributed to the formation of N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds between the N–H in the amino groups of FAI and the N atom in F4TCNQ molecules,38 which could be responsible for the downshift in the wavenumber of the characteristic peaks of N–H stretching vibration after the introduction of F4TCNQ into FAI (Fig. S16, ESI†).39
To further understand the interaction between F4TCNQ and perovskites, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed on F4TCNQ and the perovskite doped with F4TCNQ, as shown in Fig. 2f and S17† (ESI). The characteristic peak at 2228.0 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of F4TCNQ originates from the stretching vibration of CN in F4TCNQ,40 which is shifted to a lower wavenumber of 2213.6 cm−1 for the perovskite doped with F4TCNQ. Such a shift of the CN characteristic peak indicates that the CN of F4TCNQ may form coordination bonds with the Pb2+ of the perovskites. As such, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on the primary perovskite and the perovskite doped with F4TCNQ, and the core-level Pb 4f spectra and full spectra are shown in Fig. 2g and S18 (ESI†), respectively. The core-level F 1s peak shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†) proves the presence of F4TCNQ in the perovskite film. Compared with the primary perovskite, the core-level Pb 4f peak of the perovskite doped with F4TCNQ shows lower binding energy. These results demonstrate that the coordination bonds between the empty orbital of Pb2+ of the perovskites and the lone pair of the CN of F4TCNQ could be built, which is consistent with the FTIR results. Besides, it is worth noting that the core-level I 3d peak of perovskites is almost unchanged after the introduction of F4TCNQ into the perovskites, suggesting that there is no interaction between the iodine of the perovskite and F4TCNQ (Fig. S20, ESI†).
Based on the above results, Fig. 2h schematically presents the interaction between perovskites and the PTAA doped with F4TCNQ. The N atoms of F4TCNQ could interact with the Pb2+ and N–H of the cations of the perovskite through forming a CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and N–H⋯N hydrogen bond, respectively, benefiting the quality improvement of the perovskites and ameliorating the interfacial properties of PTAA/PVK. Notably, the aforementioned intensive π–π stacking and charge transfer between PTAA and F4TCNQ could further improve the interfacial properties of PTAA/PVK, resulting in good charge transfer at the PTAA/PVK interface.
2.3 Theoretical calculations
To further elucidate the interaction between F4TCNQ and perovskites, extensive theoretical calculations were performed using first-principles density functional theory calculations, and the detailed methods are described in the Experimental section in the ESI.† During the calculations, both PbI2 and FAI terminated perovskites were taken into account to interact with F4TCNQ. Fig. 3a and b present the calculated structure of the PbI2-terminated perovskites (PbI2-PVK) interacting with the monomer of PTAA (m-PTAA) and F4TCNQ, respectively, and Fig. 3c displays the calculated structure of the FAI-terminated perovskite (FAI-PVK) interacting with F4TCNQ. The corresponding binding energies between these interactions are summarized in Fig. S21† (ESI). It can be seen that m-PTAA shows a weak bond with the perovskite with a relatively low binding energy of −1.29 eV for the m-PTAA/PVK system. For the F4TCNQ/PbI2-PVK system, the CN group of F4TCNQ could form a strong CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond with the Pb2+ of the perovskite according to the side view of the F4TCNQ/PbI2-PVK system and the sectional view of the corresponding electron localization function (ELF) results (Fig. 3d and S22, ESI†). Meanwhile, the distance between the Pb2+ in the perovskite and the N in F4TCNQ was determined to be ∼2.6 Å, which further confirms the formation of a strong CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond interaction between the perovskite and F4TCNQ. Thanks to the strong CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bonding, the F4TCNQ/PbI2-PVK system exhibits a higher binding energy of −1.55 eV between them. Besides, in terms of the FAI-terminated perovskite, the N–H⋯N hydrogen bond can be formed between the CN group of F4TCNQ and the N–H of the amino group of the perovskite, as evidenced by the side view of the optimized F4TCNQ/FAI-PVK system and the corresponding ELF results shown in Fig. 3h and S23† (ESI). Attributed to the strong N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds, higher binding energy with a value of −2.77 eV was calculated for the F4TCNQ/FAI-PVK system. In addition, the surface structure of PVK, m-PTAA/PVK, and F4TCNQ/PbI2-PVK systems was analyzed in detail (Fig. S24, ESI†), and the results show that compared with the interaction with m-PTAA, the interaction between perovskite and F4TCNQ forms perovskite having a more perfect crystal structure, which further proves that the introduction of F4TCNQ is beneficial for the crystallization and growth of perovskite films.41 Therefore, to conclude, the strong chemical interaction between the perovskite and F4TCNQ may result in a high-quality perovskite film deposited on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer as discussed in the above section.

(k) Z-axis line profile of the charge density difference model and Bader charge analysis of FAI-PVK interacting with F4TCNQ. 
In addition to the theoretical understanding of the interaction between the perovskite and F4TCNQ, the charge transfer at the HTL/PVK interface was also studied using Bader charge analysis.42,43Fig. 3e–g display the charge density differences of PbI2-PVK interacting with m-PTAA and F4TCNQ, as well as FAI-PVK interacting with F4TCNQ, respectively. The electron depletion and accumulation are represented by blue and yellow isosurfaces, respectively. The corresponding Z-axis line profile of the charge density difference model and Bader charge analysis are presented in Fig. 3i–k. As shown in Fig. 3f and g, the delocalized charge density differences of the Pb2+, N–H atoms of the perovskite and N atom of F4TCNQ further prove the formation of the CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and the N–H⋯N hydrogen bond between the perovskite and F4TCNQ.44 The value of the Bader charge was calculated to be 0.022e for the m-PTAA/PVK system, while such a value is increased to be 0.283 and 0.391e for the F4TCNQ/PbI2-PVK and F4TCNQ/FAI-PVK systems, respectively. The increased Bader charges in these systems are attributed to the strong CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and N–H⋯N hydrogen bond built between F4TCNQ and perovskites. These important results evidence the conclusions of the strong chemical interaction between F4TCNQ and perovskites to improve the charge transfer at the HTL/PVK interface, which is in line with the results of PL and TRPL measurements.
2.4 Charge carrier extraction and recombination
As demonstrated above, F4TCNQ plays an important role in the perovskite formation and the interfacial properties of HTL/PVK, thereby dominating charge carrier extraction and recombination at the HTL/PVK interface. As such, femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements were performed to obtain more details on charge carrier dynamics induced by F4TCNQ. Fig. 4a–c present the contour plots of the fs-TA spectra of PVK, PTAA/PVK and PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples as a function of wavelength and delay time, respectively. A negative photobleaching signal can be observed at ∼760 nm for these samples in the band edge of the perovskite, which could be ascribed to the band filling by photoexcited carriers of perovskites.45,46 The normalized fs-TA spectral profiles from 9 fs to 50 ps of PVK, PTAA/PVK and PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples are plotted in Fig. 4d–f. The nonequilibrium distribution of hot carriers can be clearly observed in the primary perovskites after excitation, which is consistent with the literature.47,48 Compared with the primary perovskite, the broadening of the high-energy tail of the fs-TA spectra is somewhat decreased for the perovskite deposited on the PTAA layer, and the high-energy tail of the fs-TA spectra is further reduced in the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK sample. Therefore, photo-generated hot carriers could be more efficiently extracted from the perovskite into the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer. To quantitatively evaluate the hot carrier extraction, the normalized fs-TA kinetics of PVK, PTAA/PVK and PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples at 695 nm were plotted (Fig. S25, ESI†), and the curves were fitted using a biexponential function (Table S2, ESI†). The results reveal that the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK sample possesses a lower average decay time of 2.72 ps compared with that of the PTAA/PVK sample (3.69 ps), further demonstrating the enhanced extraction/injection of hot carriers at the HTL/PVK interface induced by F4TCNQ.

The TA spectra kinetics on nano- to millisecond time scales are generally used to probe the charge recombination dynamics at the interface of perovskite and charge transport layers.49,50 Therefore, nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectra were further recorded to study the charge carrier recombination at the HTL/PVK interface. Fig. 4g shows the ns-TA spectra kinetics of PVK, PTAA/PVK and PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK samples, and the curves were fitted using a biexponential function (Table S3, ESI†). The PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK sample exhibits the longest average decay lifetime with a value of 6081.15 ns compared with that of the PVK (3597.47 ns) and PTAA/PVK (5049.35 ns) samples, which indicates that the nonradiative recombination is significantly diminished at the HTL/PVK interface after introducing F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer.
According to the results of ultrafast spectroscopy, the schematic illustrations displayed in Fig. 4h and i depict the carrier transfer dynamics at the HTL/PVK interface without and with the dopant F4TCNQ in the PTAA layer. It can be concluded that the introduction of F4TCNQ molecules into PTAA is beneficial to increasing charge carrier extraction and suppressing charge carrier recombination at the HTL/PVK interface. The favorable charge carrier extraction and transport in the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK system may be mainly attributed to the chemical interaction between perovskite and F4TCNQ.
2.5 Photovoltaic performance of PSCs
To investigate the effect of F4TCNQ on the photovoltaic performance of PSC devices, inverted PSCs with a p-i-n device structure were fabricated. Fig. 5a presents the cross-sectional SEM image of the inverted PSC with a device structure of ITO/PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK/PCBM/BCP/Ag. Fig. 5b and c present the photocurrent density-photovoltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs fabricated with PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ as the HTLs, respectively. The J–V curves were recorded under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination with forward and reverse voltage scanning directions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the best PSCs, including Voc, short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE, are summarized in Table 1. The PTAA-based PSC yields impressive PCEs of 20.1% and 20.4% under forward and reverse voltage scanning directions, respectively. As expected, after introducing F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer, the photovoltaic performance of the PSC is greatly improved, reaching high PCEs of up to 22.5% and 22.2% under forward and reverse voltage scanning directions, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of the demonstrated inverted PSCs is among those of the state-of-the-art inverted PSCs with a similar bandgap of perovskites (Table S4, ESI†). Both PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC devices show negligible hysteresis in J–V curves. Obviously, the improved PCE in the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC mainly results from enhanced FF and Voc, which may be due to enhanced charge carrier extraction as a result of the improved interfacial properties of HTL/PVK that will be deeply discussed in the next section.

The stabilized power output of PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC was measured under continuous illumination for 2000 s with a bias voltage of 1.03 V (Fig. 5d), and the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC exhibits a remarkably stabilized PCE of 21.7%. Fig. 5e shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs. The photocurrent density of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC devices was calculated to be 21.6 and 22.1 mA cm−2 from the IPCE spectra, respectively, in agreement with the results of J–V measurements. Additionally, the reproducibility of PSC devices was investigated by counting 20 cells fabricated from different branches. Fig. 5f presents the statistical PCEs of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs, and other photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. S26† (ESI). Both PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs present high reproducibility and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs possess higher average photovoltaic parameters than PTAA-based PSCs. Obviously, compared with other photovoltaic parameters, the Voc values of PSCs are more uniform and greatly increased after the introduction of F4TCNQ, which may be attributed to suppressed interfacial charge recombination and efficient interfacial charge extraction.
The stability of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs under different test conditions was evaluated. The thermal stability of unencapsulated PSCs was conducted at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, and Fig. 5g shows the normalized PCEs of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs as a function of the storage time. It is encouraging that the PCE of PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs decays very slowly and 90.7% of initial efficiency was maintained after aging for 550 h, whereas the PTAA-based PSC preserved 68.8% of initial efficiency after aging for 550 h. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated PSC devices were continuously illuminated in a nitrogen atmosphere under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The results show that the PCE of PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs remained at 84.6% of its original value after continuous illumination for 550 h, while the PCE of PTAA-based PSCs degraded to be 36.2% of its initial value after continuous illumination for 550 h (Fig. 5h). The better stability of PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC devices may be attributed to the improved properties of the PTAA layer, the higher quality of the perovskite film and the improved interfacial properties between PTAA and perovskite after the introduction of F4TCNQ. Therefore, doping PTAA with F4TCNQ is significantly required to realize inverted PSCs with high photovoltaic performance and stability.
2.6 Charge carrier dynamics within the PSCs
To figure out the causes leading to improved photovoltaic performance and understand the effect of F4TCNQ on the charge carrier dynamics within the PSCs, the open-circuit-to-short-circuit (OC-to-SC) PL quenching efficiency (PLQEOC-SC) of PSCs was studied. As shown in Fig. 6a, the PSC device was excited under OC and SC conditions, and the corresponding steady PL spectra were recorded, respectively. The PLQEOC-SC of PSC devices was calculated using the following equation:51,52 (1)where PLOC and PLSC are the steady PL spectra recorded under OC and SC conditions, respectively. In principle, the higher PLQE values of a solar cell generally suggest more efficient charge extraction from the solar cell device.51Fig. 6b and c show the normalized steady PL spectra of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs under OC and SC conditions, respectively. The PLQEOC-SC of the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC is calculated to be 87%, higher than that of the PTAA-based PSC (80%), suggesting improved charge extraction of the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC.

(i) EQEEL of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs operated as LED devices. 
The perovskite film with diminished charge carrier recombination prepared on the PTAA+F4TCNQ layer may show lowered defect density. Therefore, the defect density of perovskite films was evaluated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The dark current–voltage curves of the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PTAA (with and without F4TCNQ)/PVK/PTAA/Ag were recorded to determine the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) of the devices (Fig. 6d). Based on the value of VTFL, the defect density (Nd) in the perovskites was determined using the following equation:53,54 (2)where ε, ε0, e and d are the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, the vacuum permittivity, the elementary charge and the thickness of the perovskite film, respectively. The VTFL was estimated to be 0.19 and 0.09 V for the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based devices, respectively. According to the values of VTFL and the above equation, the calculated Nd values decrease from 1.76 × 1015 to 0.83 × 1015 cm−3 after the introduction of F4TCNQ into the PTAA layer. The lowered defect density in the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based device could be attributed to the improved quality of the perovskite film and the substantially decreased interfacial defects at the PTAA+F4TCNQ/PVK interface. Besides, transient photovoltage (TPV) was also tested to quantify the charge lifetime (or called the charge recombination rate) for evaluating the charge extraction and recombination in the PSC devices. Fig. 6e shows the TPV curves of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs, and the curves were fitted using a biexponential function (Table S5, ESI†). The PTAA-based PSC exhibits a charge lifetime of 0.79 ms, while such a value is extended to be 1.94 ms for the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC, suggesting that nonradiative recombination is substantially suppressed in the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC.
To gain deeper insight into the mechanism of carrier recombination within the PSCs affected by F4TCNQ, Voc as a function of light intensity was tested as shown in Fig. 6f. The curves were fitted using the equation:55 (3)where n, k, T, and I are the diode ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin and light intensity, respectively. In general, the slope of the curve is related to the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the PSCs. The value of the calculated slope of the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC (1.63 kT/e) is smaller than that of the PTAA-based PSC (1.84 kT/e), which indicates suppressed trap-assisted recombination within the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs being obtained, explaining the enhanced Voc and FF in PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs.
The electroluminescence (EL) technique in which the solar cell is operated as a light-emitting diode (LED) under a voltage bias provides a feasible approach to quantitatively evaluate the Voc losses of PSCs caused by nonradiative recombination.56–61 The Voc of the PSCs and radiative recombination emission efficiency usually show a positive correlation according to the following equation:60–62 (4)where Jph and Jem,0 are the photocurrent density of the solar cells under illumination and the current density of re-emitted photons, respectively. The EQE of the EL (EQEEL) was extracted as the current density of the PSC working as an LED is equal to the photocurrent density of the PSCs under illumination.

Fig. 6g and h present the EQEEL and current density curves of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs operated as LEDs as a function of voltage bias, respectively, and the EL emission spectra under different voltages are shown in Fig. S27† (ESI). The results show that both PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs have conspicuous EL emission at 766 nm, whereas the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC device shows a higher EL intensity. Meanwhile, the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC presents a lower turn-on voltage of 1.15 V compared with that of the PTAA-based PSC (1.25 V), suggesting a more balanced carrier injection, smaller leakage current, lower energy losses and reduced nonradiative recombination in the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC device.56,63 The insets of Fig. 6g and h display the EL image of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs operated as LEDs. It can be seen that compared with the PTAA-based PSCs, the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC exhibits a brighter and more uniform EL emission. Fig. 6i shows the EQEEL as a function of the current density of PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs operated as LEDs. According to eqn (4), the Voc of the solar cell device is positively correlated with the EQEEL value when the solar cell device is operated as a LED. Therefore, the Voc variation (ΔVoc) between the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs can be determined by using the following equation:60 (5)where EQEEL PTAA and EQEEL PTAA+F4TCNQ represent the EQEEL value of the PTAA and PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSCs when the injection current of the PSC operated as a LED in the dark is equal to the photocurrent of the PSC under illumination, respectively. The results show that compared with the EQEEL of 0.31% for the PTAA-based PSC, the EQEEL of the PTAA+F4TCNQ-based PSC is largely improved to be 4.6%. Based on the above analysis, the ΔVoc is calculated to be 69 mV, which is in good agreement with the results of J–V measurements. Therefore, considering the above results, F4TCNQ is a critical dopant for hole transport polymer PTAA to realize efficient inverted PSCs with high electroluminescence by substantially diminishing charge carrier recombination in the PSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, the complex influence of dopant F4TCNQ on hole transport polymer PTAA and its dominant effect on the device operation of inverted PSCs have been comprehensively elaborated. The combination of extensive theoretical calculations and detailed experimental studies revealed that F4TCNQ and PTAA could form a strong π–π stacking between them, which was favorable for improving the spatial configuration of PTAA and the charge transfer between them. Meanwhile, a CN⋯Pb2+ coordination bond and N–H⋯N hydrogen bond could be formed between F4TCNQ and perovskites, resulting in improved interfacial properties of HTL/PVK. These chemical interactions between F4TCNQ and perovskites also benefited the crystallization of perovskites to obtain high-quality perovskite films with lowered defect density. As a consequence, an impressive PCE of up to 22.5% was achieved for inverted PSCs with high electroluminescence with an EQE of up to 4.6%. The high photovoltaic and electroluminescence performances were ascribed to a combination of the improved spatial configuration of the PTAA layer, ameliorated interfacial properties of HTL/PVK and high-quality perovskite films, which were overall induced by the dopant F4TCNQ. Moreover, the inverted PSCs also demonstrated good stability under continuous illumination and thermal conditions. This work provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental interplay between the dopant and hole transport polymer or perovskite to facilitate the charge carrier extraction of inverted PSCs. Meanwhile, this work also highlights the important design criterion of dopants for the hole transport polymer and its dominant effect to realize higher performance PSCs or other optoelectronic devices.
