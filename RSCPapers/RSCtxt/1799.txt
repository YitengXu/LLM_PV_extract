    AbstractWe have explored the opto-electronic properties of a new series of hole-transport materials based on main-chain triphenylamine-based poly(azomethine)s. 4,4′-Diaminotriphenylamine (TPA) was polymerized under benign conditions with either terephthalaldehyde (TPA-14Ta), 2,5-thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TPA-25Th) or 1,3-isophthalaldehyde (TPA-13Iso) to yield polymers with an Mn of 5700–16000 g mol−1. Despite the non-linear, or ‘kinked’, backbone geometry, all polymers form lyotropic solutions in chloroform and this liquid crystal (nematic) ordering could be maintained in the solid film after spin casting. All polymers exhibit high glass-transition temperatures (Tg > 250 °C) and display outstanding thermal stabilities, i.e. 5% wt loss in excess of 400 °C under nitrogen. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these polymers were in the range of 5.0–5.3 and 2.4–3.3 eV below the vacuum level, respectively. Introduction of a thiophene heterocycle (TPA-25Th) resulted in a material with a low optical band-gap of approximately 2.0 eV, whereas TPA-14Ta and TPA-13Iso showed optical band gaps of 2.3 and 2.6 eV, respectively. A photovoltaic device based on a TPA-25Th/PCBM blend (1 : 3) showed an EQE of 20% at 500 nm. Under simulated sunlight, the device gives an open-circuit voltage of 0.41 V, a short-circuit current of 1.23 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.24, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 0.12%.
Introduction
The development of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications is attractive because polymer photovoltaics (PVs) offer several significant advantages over their inorganic silicon-based counterparts, i.e. low cost synthesis, and ease of processing via solution-based casting or printing technologies. At present a wide range of conjugated hole-transport materials for opto-electronic applications is available mostly via Suzuki-type aryl–aryl coupling methods or Wittig-type coupling techniques. These chemistries, however, require stringent reaction conditions, i.e. one needs to exclude moisture and oxygen, and expensive monomers, catalysts and salts are required. In addition, care has to be taken during polymer work-up in order to remove all side products and reagents because even low levels of impurities result in poor opto-electronic properties and reduced device lifetime.1
In order to provide reproducible conjugated materials, that can be made from cheap and readily available starting materials, we are currently exploring all-aromatic polyazomethines or poly-Schiff bases built around triphenylamine (TPA) and (heterocyclic) aromatic dialdehydes. The fact that all-aromatic polyazomethines (PAMs) are interesting candidates for opto-electronic applications was indirectly recognized by Morgan et al. in 1987.2 They explored a variety of main-chain all-aromatic backbone architectures, e.g.I, and found that most of their polymers formed either orange or dark red films with excellent mechanical properties.  
They also reported that their polymers could be synthesized using simple room temperature solution-, or even melt-condensation techniques and moreover, catalysts were not required. Their polymers showed excellent thermal (Td5% > 400 °C) and hydrolytic stabilities, and some polymers formed liquid crystalline solutions, i.e. displayed lyotropic behavior in suitable solvents. In addition, they demonstrated the possibility to synthesize a PAM ‘pre-polymer’ or oligomer, which could be polymerized to high molecular weight in a subsequent high-temperature post-treatment step. This would be a convenient technique toward processing otherwise insoluble polymers and make the use of ‘solubilizing’ groups such as alkyl substituents obsolete.
Recently reports have emerged wherein researchers present polyazomethines built around triphenylamine units, and these reports confirm the outstanding thermal properties (Tg > 200 °C, Td5% > 400 °C) and ease of synthesis. Although some optical data and cyclic voltammetry (CV) data were presented, no PV devices were demonstrated.3 Liu et al. used a hybrid density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the geometry and electronic structure of a series of all-aromatic PAMs, and they found that introducing 5-membered heterocycles improves the co-planarity of the polymer backbone and hence improves the overall conjugation and associated opto-electronic properties.4 The latter was confirmed by Skene et al., who synthesized a series of polythiophenoazomethines which exhibit low optical band gaps (1.3–2.0 eV), and all polymers showed excellent thermal properties as well.5,6 In addition, the polymers are claimed to be chemically and photochemically stable. The authors also showed that this class of polymers can be used in both n- and p-type devices. No data were reported on their performance in PV devices.
In order to investigate the usefulness of triphenylamine (TPA)-based hole-transport polymers for PV applications we have synthesized a simple series of TPA-based model compounds where we varied the exocyclic bond angle of the dialdehyde moiety, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of all-aromatic polyazomethines with different conjugated (TPA-14Ta, TPA-25Th) and non-conjugated dialdehydes (TPA-13Iso). 
By varying the exocyclic bond angle we can control the conjugation along the polymer backbone, i.e. conjugation is expected to improve going from 1,4-terephthaldehyde (14Ta) to 2,5-thiophenedialdehyde (25Th) since the steric hindrance between the ring protons and the adjacent azomethine proton is reduced, resulting in a more coplanar structure. The 1,3-isophthalaldehyde (13Iso) is used as non-conjugated reference monomer and any opto-electronic response will be solely due to inter-chain charge transport. In order to investigate the role of the azomethine linkage, see Fig. 2, we prepared a reference polymer (TPA-14PD) where the azomethine is reversed, i.e. 4,4′-diformyltriphenylamine is coupled with 1,4-phenylenediamine.

Results and discussion
All monomers were easy to prepare in acceptable overall yields according to known literature procedures. The TPA-based polyazomethines were prepared using a simple one-step condensation procedure without catalysts and under ambient conditions. No attempts were undertaken to optimize the polymerization conditions or end-cap the polymer chain ends. All polymers showed limited solubility in common solvents such as ethanol (EtOH), tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). Thin films for spectroscopic studies, however, could be cast from chloroform (CHCl3) or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Polymer solutions in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) with 5 mM of LiBr were analyzed using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). All polymers showed unimodal molecular weight distributions with number average molecular weights (Mn) varying from 5700 to 16000 g mol−1. The polydispersity (PD) for most polymers was found to be in the range of 1.74–1.86, and this range is typical for condensation polymers. The GPC traces of all polymers and the molecular weight data are available in the ESI†.
Thermal properties
In order to investigate the thermal stability of our polymers we performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments under an inert (N2) atmosphere using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All polymers showed excellent thermal stabilities under these conditions and decomposition typically takes place above 400 °C. Mass spectroscopy (MS) experiments showed that the weight loss below 400 °C could be attributed to out-gassing of residual monomer species (TPA) and H2O. The latter is thought to be due to a post-polycondensation process, where the polymer amine and aldehyde end groups continue to react and water is expelled. This process results in a polymer with a higher Mn and fewer chain-end functionalities that could act as charge traps.
The phase behavior of the TPA-based polyazomethines was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. All samples were investigated using heating and cooling scans at 10 °C min−1. All polymers showed clear glass-transition temperatures but no melt transitions (Tm) could be observed. Annealing the polymers at different temperatures for several hours, i.e. at 200 °C, 250 °C or 300 °C, did not result in polymer crystallization. All polymers showed Tg values in excess of 250 °C, which is common for all-aromatic main-chain polymers. The highest glass-transition temperatures were measured for the most rigid analogs, i.e.TPA-14Ta (Tg = 310 °C) and TPA-14PD (Tg = 301 °C), but when the backbone becomes less rigid by introducing non-linear monomers such as 2,5-thiophenedialdehyde (TPA-25Th) and isophthalaldehyde (TPA-13Iso), the Tg drops to 263 °C and 251 °C, respectively. The TGA and DSC results are summarized in the ESI† including representative TGA and DSC traces of TPA-25Th.
Optical microscopy
All-aromatic polyazomethines were initially explored for their mechanical properties, i.e. high modulus fibers and films could be spun from lyotropic solutions. Since our polymers deviate significantly from linearity we did not anticipate LC phases. However, we observed that our as cast thin films exhibited an unusual birefringence which is typically only observed in liquid crystal systems. We therefore investigated the phase behavior of our polymers using polarized optical microscopy. Polymer solutions of TPA-14Ta, TPA-25Th and TPA-13Iso were prepared (∼10 to 20 wt% in CHCl3 or DCB) and studied between untreated glass slides at 25 °C. The results were quite unexpected. As can be seen in Fig. 3, all three polymers formed stable nematic lyotropic solutions. The solvent was allowed to slowly evaporate and this resulted in thin polymer films where the nematic order was preserved.
 Fig. 3  Microphotographs (crossed polars, 20×) of the liquid crystalline phases of TPA-14Ta (A), TPA-25Th (B) and TPA-13Iso (C) (∼20 wt% solutions in CHCl3 at 25 °C). 
These results are quite remarkable because the introduction of non-linear moieties into the polymer backbone, such as 1,3-phenylene, 2,5-thiophene and triphenylamine-based monomers, typically reduces mesogenicity or even eliminates liquid crystallinity all together. In the most extreme example, i.e.TPA-13Iso, both 1,3-phenylene and triphenylamine monomers introduce an exocyclic bond angle of ∼120° in the polymer backbone, which deviates significantly from the desired linear, high-aspect-ratio geometry typically observed in lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystal systems.7 Based on our earlier work on all-aromatic liquid crystals, however, we have shown that, in addition to mesogen shape, electronic conjugation and electrostatics are important mesophase stabilizing factors as well.8 Although 4,4′-substituted triphenylamine strongly deviates from linearity, the trigonal planar geometry of this molecule forces the free electron pair on the central nitrogen atom to be either above or below the plane of symmetry and this partially restores the electronic conjugation between the adjacent phenyl rings and the rest of the polymer backbone as is the case for TPA-14Ta and TPA-25Th.9 But the absence of a high-aspect-ratio mesogenic primary structure does not preclude liquid crystallinity. If an extended polymer secondary structure, e.g. a regular helical polymer conformation or a high-aspect-ratio aggregate, is adopted by these non-linear polymers, one could account for liquid crystal formation.
We also allowed the solvent to evaporate and by doing so we observed that the obtained polymer film retained characteristic nematic liquid crystal textures in the solid-state. Increasing the temperature did not have a noticeable effect on the LC texture, which remains unchanged up to the decomposition temperature (>450 °C), i.e. no N–I transition could be observed.
X-Ray diffraction measurements
In order to gain insight into the molecular packing preferences of the liquid crystal phase we prepared thin films cast from either CHCl3 or DCB on an aluminium substrate. As discussed in the previous section, TPA-14Ta, TPA-25Th and TPA-13Iso form liquid crystal phases exhibiting typical nematic textures when cast from CHCl3 solutions, whereas DCB yields only optically isotropic films. All polymer films were investigated at room temperature after the solvent had evaporated. Fig. 4 shows the diffraction patterns of TPA-14Ta as cast from CHCl3 and DCB. TPA-25Th and TPA-13Iso films show similar diffraction patterns.
 Fig. 4  X-Ray diffraction patterns of TPA-14Ta films cast from chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). When cast from chloroform, TPA-14Ta forms supramolecular aggregates on a ∼100 to 250 Å length scale. 
All polymer films cast from CHCl3 display broad wide-angle reflections with a maximum around 2θ = 20.5°, which corresponds to a lateral intermolecular spacing of ∼4.3 Å, and is considered typical for nematic systems. When the samples were investigated in the low angle region, strong and broad reflections were observed with a maximum around 2θ ≈ 0.5°, suggesting the presence of large molecular aggregates, which exist on length scale of ∼180 Å, as can been seen in Fig. 4. When films were cast from DCB, either dilute (<1 wt%) or concentrated (>10 wt%), the formation of aggregates was prevented as became evident by the absence of diffraction peaks in the low angle region. Obviously, DCB effectively disrupts the delicate intermolecular packing preferences needed for self-assembly.
Spectroscopic measurements
Dilute polymer solutions (0.5 wt%) were prepared in CHCl3 and spin cast on quartz slides for UV-vis measurements and the results are shown in Fig. 5. All 4,4′-triphenylamine-based polymers, i.e.TPA-14Ta, TPA-25Th and TPA-13Iso, exhibit two clear absorption peaks in the spectral range shown, which are attributed to the π–π* transitions. Improving conjugation in this series results in a systematic bathochromic shift of λmax, i.e. 407 nm for TPA-13Iso, 453 nm and 500 nm for TPA-14Ta and TPA-25Th, respectively (Fig. 5A).
 Fig. 5  Room temperature solid-state UV-vis normalized absorption spectra of triphenylamine-based poly(azomethine)s: (A) with different conjugated and non-conjugated dialdehydes and (B) the normalized absorption spectra of TPA-14PD and TPA-14Ta (reversed azomethine linkage). Films were spin cast on quartz substrates. 
We also investigated how the azomethine linkage affects the absorption characteristics of this class of polymers. By placing the aldehyde functionality on the triphenylamine moiety, as is the case for 4,4′-diformyltriphenylamine, and coupling this with 1,4-phenylenediamine a similar polymer is obtained but with the azomethine linkage reversed. The consequences are rather pronounced, as shown in Fig. 5B. The UV-vis absorption spectrum now has only one peak at wavelengths longer than 250 nm, and a hypsochromic shift of 35 nm is observed. A similar observation was made by Sek et al.10 Having the diamine functionality on the triphenylamine moiety seems to be preferred since this lowers the band-gap of the resulting polymer.
Photoluminescence measurements
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers were investigated in solution and in the solid-state, i.e. films were spun onto quartz substrates, and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. TPA-14Ta and TPA-13Iso were processed from CHCl3 and TPA-25Th from DCB. A similar red shift in the PL spectra is observed as for the UV-vis experiments, i.e. a systematic red shift is seen when the conjugation length increases, going from TPA-25Th, TPA-14Ta to TPA-13Iso. When comparing the PL behavior in solution to solid-state PL behavior all three polymers show a slight red shift due to better ordering and an increased conjugation of the polymers in the solid-state. In the TPA-25Th solution, and to a weaker extent in the film, a feature can be seen in the tail of the PL spectrum (∼700 nm). This feature may be due to emission from a population of intermolecular excited states. When comparing the PL from TPA-25Th in cyclohexanone, another solvent which allows the formation of a lyotropic nematic phase, and DCB it is seen that this lower energy emission is reduced for the DCB case. It has been observed that TPA-25Th does not form a liquid crystal phase in DCB lending evidence that this emission stems from the formation of supramolecular aggregates.
 Fig. 6  Room temperature normalized PL spectra of our polyazomethine films on quartz (excitation at 410 nm (TPA-13Iso), 470 nm (TPA-14Ta) and 500 nm (TPA-25Th)). 
We also observed that the PL from all the polymers in both film and solution is very weak, which could be attributed to a slow radiative decay rate or a fast non-radiative decay channel. Attempts were made to measure the radiative decay rate using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) but it was found that the decay was so short that it is of the same order as the instrument response. This seems to indicate that there is a fast non-radiative decay channel; this could reduce the efficiency of photovoltaic devices as fewer excitons may reach an interface with the acceptor material before undergoing non-radiative decay.
The absorption maxima of the UV-vis and PL experiments, together with the calculated optical band-gap for each polymer, are summarized in Table 1. The band-gap was calculated from the onset of the UV-vis absorption.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments
The oxidation potentials of our compounds were determined by cyclic voltammetry and the data are presented in Table 1. The HOMO levels were calculated with reference to the energy level of ferrocene (−4.8 eV) according to well-known semi-empirical methods.11 Combining the measurements of the HOMO level with calculated band gaps of the polymers, the LUMO level could be estimated. The LUMO levels estimated by this method do not give an accurate measurement of the electron affinity, but nevertheless allow qualitative trends to be established and provide some information to help select suitable combinations with electron acceptors in photovoltaic devices.
In order to investigate the usefulness of our new polyazomethines as hole-transport materials in organic photovoltaic devices, we prepared blends of our polymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a very efficient electron accepter molecule widely used in OPVs.12 The band-gap alignment with PCBM and our new polyazomethines used in the OPV devices is summarized in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Simple energy level diagram of the HOMO and estimated LUMO levels of our polyazomethine-based OPVs as determined by cyclic voltammetry and absorption measurements. 
From this diagram we may conclude that excitons reaching the interface between the polymer and PCBM should be separated into charge carriers resulting in photovoltaic activity.
Photovoltaic measurements
Simple bulk heterojunction solar cells were prepared using polymers blended with PCBM. Indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass was used as the bottom electrode and coated with 50 nm of PEDOT : PSS. On top of this, the active layer consisting of the polyazomethine polymer and PCBM was spin-coated. Finally a top electrode of aluminium (80 nm) was thermally evaporated. The active layer thickness was approximately 90 nm in each device and no attempts were made to optimize the device dimensions. The optimum performing cells were made from films of a 3 : 1 (w/w) mixture of PCBM : polymer. It is well-known that heat treatment of polymer solar cells improves their efficiency.13,14 Annealing at 200 °C for 30 min under nitrogen was found to work best for our devices. The polymers TPA-13Iso and TPA-14Ta were spun from CHCl3 and the TPA-25Th polymer from DCB.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) measured are displayed in Fig. 8A. Current density–voltage characteristics were taken using simulated sunlight (AM1.5G conditions) and are shown in Fig. 8B. The peaks in all the EQE curves coincide with the peaks in the absorption profiles of the polymers, indicating that excitons created in the polymer are separated into charges at the interface with PCBM.15 A summary of the device performance can be found in Table 2. From this table it can be seen that low open-circuit voltages and low fill factors limit the device performance. The open-circuit voltages of the order of 0.4 V are surprisingly low compared with the 1.4 V maximum, that might be expected from the difference in energy between the polymer HOMO and PCBM LUMO levels shown in Fig. 7. The low fill factors indicate that recombination after separation is limiting the performance.16

From Fig. 8A it can be seen that there is a dramatic increase in the EQE when moving through the polymer series. There are several reasons for this trend in the series. TPA-13Iso is not fully conjugated and we attribute the poor photovoltaic performance to difficulty in charge hopping between monomer units. The conjugation length increases in the TPA-14Ta and TPA-25Th with the TPA-25Th being the most conjugated polymer. This increasing degree of conjugation means that excitons and charges can move through the film much more easily, resulting in enhanced performance.
There are several possibilities limiting the short-circuit current density of the devices. The short-circuit current density could be limited by the low PL efficiency in the pristine films. This indicates that there is a fast non-radiative decay channel open to excitons created in the polymer. If this channel still exists in the blended films then it could result in excitons decaying prior to reaching an interface with the PCBM. This would lead to low current densities.
It is clear that the TPA-25Th material is the most promising for further study due to its high EQEs and red absorption (from the series it has the best overlap with the solar spectrum). An increase in EQE could be obtained if it were to become possible, by the addition of solubilizing units, to spin films from a lower-boiling-point solvent. The high boiling point of DCB means that a high degree of phase separation is expected between the PCBM and polymer. These larger domains will result in fewer excitons reaching an interface and lowering the current density. A lower-boiling-point solvent would allow the creation of smaller domains and a more optimized nanoscale morphology.
Experimental
Materials and methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless stated otherwise. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N-methylpyrolidinone (NMP) were dried over and distilled from CaH2 prior to use. 2,5-Thiophenedicarboxaldehyde was purified by vacuum sublimation and isophthalaldehyde was recrystallized twice from water. Where indicated, monomers or intermediates were purified using column chromatography (Si-gel 60).
The structures of intermediates were confirmed by 1H NMR (Bruker WM400, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (Bruker WM400, 100 MHz). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Bruker AXS D8 Discovery diffractometer, using a Cu-Kα X-ray tube (λ = 1.54 Å) at 40 keV. Infrared spectra were obtained with a Bio-rad FTS-7 spectrometer and UV-vis spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis Spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers were investigated using a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Transition temperatures were determined by using a PerkinElmer Sapphire differential scanning calorimeter, calibrated with indium (99.99%) (mp, 156.5 °C, ΔH = 28.315 J g−1) and tin (99.99%) (mp, 232.0 °C, ΔH = 54.824 J g−1). The second heating (10 °C min−1) as well as the cooling scans (10 °C min−1) were recorded. Mesophases were identified with a Nikon Microphot-FX polarizing microscope equipped with a linkam hot stage. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed in propylene carbonate and films were drop cast on the electrode surface.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on Shimadzu Prominence GPC system equipped with a Shodex LF-804 column. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) with 5mM of LiBr was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 at 60 °C. Data analyses were performed with LabSolutions software from the refractive index detector data. Quantification was made based on PS standard calibration.
Monomer synthesis
All monomers were synthesized using modified literature procedures. 4,4′-Dinitrotriphenylamine (4,4′-DA/TPA) is often reported to be synthesized by the aromatic nucleophilic amination of aniline and 4-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene under nucleophilic displacement conditions using a base such as CsF or K2CO3.17 We found that the yields were low and the work-up was time consuming. We therefore modified the procedure by using NaH, which gave high yields of 4,4′-dinitrotriphenylamine and less mono-substituted side product. Reduction of the dinitro intermediate was carried using 10% Pd/C in THF and resulted in a near quantitative yield of 4,4′-diaminotriphenylamine.
Synthesis of 4,4′-diaminotriphenylamine
A flame-dried 200 mL one-neck flask equipped with magnetic stir bar, reflux condenser and nitrogen inlet was charged with 100 mL dry DMF, NaH (1.77 g, 0.074 mol) and 4-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene (10.12 g, 0.071 mol). This mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 5 min after which aniline (3.26 g, 0.035 mol) was slowly added. The yellow reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C for 15 h under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched in 200 mL ice water. The yellow solids were collected by filtration, washed with water and dried under vacuum at 45 °C for 5 h. The crude product was dissolved in hot ethanol–acetonitrile (90 : 10) and treated with decolorizing carbon for 10 min. After removing the carbon by filtration the hot solution was allowed to cool to 0 °C and 4,4′-dinitrotriphenylamine was obtained as bright yellow crystals. Pure product was obtained after 3 recrystallizations from either glacial acetic acid or ethanol–acetonitrile (90 : 10). Yield: 7.45 g, 64%; TLC (9 : 1 hexane–ethyl acetate) tR = 0.6 (one spot); mp: 201–205 °C (lit.,17 195–196 °C).
A 100 mL one-neck flask was charged with 4,4′-dinitrotriphenylamine (1.5 g, 4.5 mmol), 50 mL dry THF, and 0.1 g 10% Pd/C. The dinitro-compound was reduced under an H2 atmosphere over 8 h at room temperature. The THF solution was filtered and THF was removed by distillation.

Synthesis of 4,4′-diformyltriphenylamine18
A 200 mL one-neck flask equipped with magnetic stir bar, reflux condenser and nitrogen inlet was charged with DMF (7.26 mL, 93.8 mmol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was cooled to 0 °C and phosphorus oxychloride (9.5 mL, 101.9 mmol) was added dropwise keeping the temperature below 2 °C. This reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and allowed to warm-up to 40 °C. Triphenylamine (1.00 g, 4.08 mmol) was added, and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 95 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was quenched into ice water (200 mL) under vigorous stirring. The yellow solids were collected by filtration and washed with excess water, 2 M Na2CO3 and water. The solids were dried at 40 °C under vacuum for 5 h. The solids were dissolved in CH2Cl2 and chromatographed over Si-gel using CH2Cl2 as the eluent. The title compound as obtained as a yellow crystalline material. Yield: 5 g, 55%; TLC (3 : 1 hexane–ethyl acetate) tR = 0.38 (one spot); mp: 145–147 °C (lit.,18 143 °C); 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.10 (d, 4H, J = 9 Hz), 7.19 (t, 1H, J = 8 Hz), 7.32 (t, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.71 (d, 4H, J = 9 Hz), 9.83 (s, 2H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 122.8, 126.2, 127.0, 130.1, 131.3, 145.5, 152.0, 190.5.
Polymer synthesis
All polymers were made using a one-step room temperature condensation technique with anhydrous LiCl as a water scavenger.2 The synthesis of TPA-25Th is given as a representative example:
A flame-dried one-neck flask with a magnetic stir bar was charged with 2,5-thiophenedialdehyde (1.66 mmol, 0.233 g), LiCl (3.5 mmol, 0.15 g) and 5 mL dry NMP. When the dialdehyde was dissolved, 4,4′-triphenylamine (1.66 mmol, 0.457 g) was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 48 h at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The viscous dark red polymer solution was precipitated in methanol–water (50 : 50) and the polymer was collected by filtration. The solids were washed (3×) with hot methanol–water (50 : 50), hot water (3×) and hot acetone (3×). The final dark red polymer was dried overnight under vacuum at 80 °C.
Device testing
EQE was measured as a function of wavelength with currents, at short-circuit, measured by a Keithley 237 source measure unit. The spot size of the monochromatic light was less than the device area. The light was provided by a tungsten filament dispersed through a monochromator. Light intensity was continuously monitored using a beam-splitter and silicon photodiode, and calibrated using a Hamamatsu S8746-01 photodiode. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 273 source measure unit with the device illuminated by an Oriel 81160-1000 solar simulator calibrated using a silicon reference cell. The spectral mismatch of the simulator was calculated by comparing the measured spectrum to the standard AM 1.5 global spectrum, taking into account the action spectra of the device under test and the reference cell. The spectral mismatch factor was used to adjust the intensity of the lamp to provide an intensity equivalent to 100 mW cm−2 for true AM 1.5 global conditions.
Concluding remarks
A new family of hole conducting poly(azomethine)s was synthesized using cheap and readily available monomers using a simple room temperature polymerization procedure. Molecular weights of 16000 g mol−1 (Mn) could be obtained without difficulty and all polymers show excellent thermal stabilities (>400 °C) and high glass-transition temperatures (>250 °C). When 2,5-thiophenedicarboxaldehyde was polymerized with 4,4′-diaminotriphenylamine (TPA-25Th) a low band-gap polymer (Eg = 2.0 eV) was obtained with promising opto-electronic properties. Good band alignment was observed with electron acceptors such as PCBM. Under simulated sunlight (AM1.5G conditions), our PCBM/TPA-25Th devices show the best photovoltaic performance, with Voc = 0.41 V, Jsc = 1.23 mA cm−2, fill factor = 0.24, and a power conversion efficiency of 0.12%. Further device optimization, perhaps combined with removing non-radiative exciton decay pathways, may lead to future improvements in overall device performance. The finding that all-aromatic TPA-based poly(azomethine)s are able to form liquid crystal phases could offer new routes toward more effective hole-transport materials. TPA-based hole-transport polymers are mostly amorphous so introducing liquid crystallinity, and the associated close molecular packing, might promote inter-chain charge transport in TPA-based OPV polymers. We will investigate the role of mesophase formation on PV performance in more detail.
