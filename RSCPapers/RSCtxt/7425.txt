Introduction
ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorod arrays (NRAs), have attracted a great deal of research interest over the past few years due to their unique properties and exciting potential applications in nanogenerators,1 piezotronics,2 UV lasers,3 light emitting diodes,4 solar cells,5 solar water splittings,6 electrochromic displays,7 and sensors.8 To meet their diverse needs of nanodevice structure and function, each of these applications requires a different arrangement, density and morphology of ZnO NRAs. For instance, vertically aligned ZnO NRAs are needed in piezoelectric nanogenerators to provide a high output voltage and drive practical devices.9 Highly uniform ZnO NRAs are needed in near UV/blue light emitting diodes for optical waveguide promotion and light extraction enhancement.10 ZnO NRAs with a high aspect ratio and specific surface area are needed in dye-sensitized solar cells to increase the absorption of the dye and improve the conversion efficiency.11 Furthermore, large-scale highly ordered ZnO NRAs with long-range periodicity are needed for the integration of piezoelectric field effect transistors and self-powered nanosystems with multiple functions.12 Therefore, the ability to produce large-scale highly ordered ZnO NRAs with the desired position, diameter, orientation, arrangement, density and morphology is essential for the integration and optimization of related functional nanodevices and nanosystems.
In this regard, various patterning methods such as optical lithography,13,14 nanosphere lithography,15–17 nanoimprint lithography,18–20 electron beam lithography10,21–24 and laser interference lithography25–29 have been employed to provide templates and bring order to ZnO NRAs, which is called patterned growth. Among them, two-beam laser interference lithography (2BLIL) has proved to be a cost-effective and high-throughput technique for the fabrication of photoresist (PR) hole templates and patterned ZnO NRAs in a large area, usually combined with chemical vapor deposition (CVD)21 or hydrothermal synthesis (HTS).26–29 HTS prefers to be adopted rather than CVD, because it is an economic and low temperature technique with little damage to the template and substrate, which is better for nanodevice and nanosystem integration. Based on Mach–Zehnder interferometer and HTS, Wang's group reported the large-scale preparation of vertically aligned ZnO NRAs, whether grown through the PR holes27 or on the unabated regions of GaN.28 By using Lloyd's mirror interferometer and HTS, Jung's group presented not only the wafer-scale fabrication of single-crystalline ZnO NRAs on ZnO seed layer coated Si, SiO2 and FTO, but also the morphological transformations of the ZnO NRAs by controlling the growth conditions, including solution components, pH, growth temperature and times.29 However, the relationship between the epitaxial growth of large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs and the crystal growth conditions, such as buffer layer, template symmetry and orientation, and growth condition, is still unclear and thus needs to be investigated urgently.
In this work, large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs with tunable arrangement, period and morphology are fabricated via 2BLIL and HTS. The growth behavior, crystal structures and optical properties of patterned ZnO NRAs grown on a single-crystalline GaN film and polycrystalline ZnO seed layer are both studied. Moreover, the interesting relationship between the orientation of the PR template and the morphology of resulting ZnO NRAs is investigated. In addition, the influence of solution pH on the top shape of the nanorod, and the height of patterned ZnO NRAs and space between them as functions of growth time, are also studied. This work will benefit a deeper understanding of the rules of patterned growth of ZnO NRAs, further enhancing the controllability of arrangement, period and morphology of the patterned ZnO NRAs on various substrates, and finally promoting the integration and optimization of related functional nanodevices and nanosystems.
Experimental
Chemicals
AR-N 4340, AR 300-12, AR 300-475 and AR 300-72 (Allresist GmbH); Aquatar (AZ Electronic Materials); acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ammonia solution (28 wt%), diethanolamine (DEA), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), zinc acetate (M = 183.47 g mol−1), zinc nitrate (M = 297.49 g mol−1) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (M = 140.19 g mol−1) (Beijing Chemical Works).
Preparation of substrates
Two kinds of substrates (p-GaN and n-Si wafers) were employed. They were cut into squares by laser scribing, ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, IPA and deionized water each for 15 min, and blow-dried using N2 gas. For heteroepitaxial growth of patterned ZnO NRAs, the c-oriented single-crystalline GaN substrates were used directly. For homoepitaxial growth of patterned ZnO NRAs, a ZnO seed layer was fabricated on Si through a spin-coating and annealing process. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar (0.5 mol L−1) zinc acetate and DEA in EGME, and allowing the mixture to rest at room temperature for 24 h. After spin-coating on the Si substrates (4000 rpm min−1 for 30 s, three times), the wet films were annealed at 550 °C for 30 min to obtain the c-oriented polycrystalline ZnO seed layers.
Fabrication of PR templates via 2BLIL
Negative photoresist AR-N 4340 was diluted with thinner AR 300-12 at a 1:1 weight ratio, and spin-coated on the substrates at 4000 rpm min−1 for 30 s to form PR films with a thickness of ∼400 nm, which was followed by a soft baking process at 85 °C on a hotplate for 2 min. Aquatar was spin-coated on the PR films at 3000 rpm min−1 for 30 s to form top anti-reflective coating (TARC) films with a thickness of ∼56 nm, which could improve the hydrophilicity of the PR surface and reduce the standing wave effect. Then, the PR + TARC coated substrates were exposed by 2BLIL with different incident angles, exposure modes and times. At last, the substrates were postbacked at 95 °C on hotplate for 1 min, developed in AR 300-475 for 30 s, rinsed with deionized water for 30 s and blow-dried using N2 gas to obtain the PR line/hole templates.
Hydrothermal growth of patterned ZnO NRAs
Large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs were synthesized in a 50 mL aqueous solution of equimolar (0.05 mol L−1) zinc nitrate and HMTA, with the templated substrates upside down at 95 °C for 2–8 h. The initial pH value of the aqueous solution could be adjusted by adding different amounts of ammonia solution (from 8 to 10). After the solution was cooled down, the substrates were taken out and cleaned by rinsing with PR remover AR 300-72 for 30 s, deionized water for 1 min, IPA for 1 min and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 10 min.
Characterization
The morphologies of the PR templates and patterned ZnO NRAs were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS ULTRA-55, 10 kV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco instruments, tapping mode). The crystallography of the ZnO NRAs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (TECNAI, F20). The crystal structure and orientation of the ZnO NRAs were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-RB, Cu Kα). The luminescence properties of the ZnO NRAs were investigated by room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Jobin-Yvon, HR 800, @325 nm).
Results and discussion
The fabrication sequence of large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs via 2BLIL and HTS consists of six steps, including substrate preparation, spin coating of PR and TARC, 2BLIL, developing, hydrothermal (HT) growth of ZnO NRAs and removing the PR template (Fig. 1a). More details are provided in the “Experimental” section. The color of the substrates will be changed in each step, especially when the substrates are covered with PR templates (Fig. 1b and c). The bright color caused by light diffraction indicates a uniform PR template over the whole surface, which is essential for fabricating patterned ZnO NRAs on a large area with uniform distribution.

For 2BLIL, a simplified diagram of the optical setup is shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† A He–Cd laser (Kimmon IK5751I-G) with a wavelength of 325 nm and an output intensity of 30 mW was used as the light source. It offers a long coherence length (30 cm) and is at lower cost than other options, such as argon-ion and excimer lasers. A spatial filter allows the high frequency noise to be removed from the laser beam to provide a clean near-Gaussian profile. This diverging beam travels 1.4 m over an optical table to a Lloyd's mirror interferometer. The interferometer, which consists of a dielectric mirror fixed perpendicularly to the substrate, is used to provide two coherence beams: one travels directly to the substrate and the other is reflected onto the substrate by the mirror. Based on the 2BLIL system, three exposure modes (single exposure at 0°, double exposure at 0°/90°, and triple exposure at −60°/0°/60°) will lead to three kinds of intensity distributions (simulated by MATLAB, the MathWorks) (Fig. 2a–c) and PR templates (Fig. 2d–f). These PR templates (1D line, 2D square and hexagonal hole ones) are employed to define the nucleation sites and arrangements of patterned ZnO NRAs later in this study.

These interference patterns can be recorded in AR-N 4340 and transformed into PR templates, such as (d) line template, (e) hole templates with square symmetry and (f) hexagonal symmetry. Insets show the corresponding magnified SEM images, scale bars are 300 nm. 
Besides the definition of arrangement, the far more economical and practical aspect of 2BLIL is that the period of the PR template and resulting ZnO NRAs can be precisely adjusted by simply rotating the two-beam Lloyd's mirror interferometer to change the incident angle θ (Fig. S1, ESI†). The period P is given by: 
(1)with λ being the wavelength of the light source, which was 325 nm in this work. Take the PR line template for example, its period is gradually decreased (from 1048 nm down to 357 nm) when the incident angle becomes larger (from 9° up to 27°) (Fig. S2a–d, ESI†). While the experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical values, the theoretical minimum period in our case is 162.5 nm when the incident angle achieves 90° (Fig. S2e, ESI†). An even smaller period could be achieved by using shorter wavelength laser or immersion 2BLIL.30 Furthermore, the width of the channel and hole in a fixed period can be further adjusted by changing the exposure time TE. Take the hexagonal PR hole template in a period of 774 nm as an example, its hole diameter gets smaller (from 706 nm to 275 nm) and template height becomes higher (from 215 nm to 290 nm) after we increase the exposure time from 45 s to 75 s (Fig. S3, ESI†). A similar trend could be achieved if we increase the post-exposure baking (PEB) time due to the chemical amplified property of AR-N 4340. All these results make it possible for us to design and fabricate the PR template and corresponding ZnO NRAs in a special period and diameter by using the appropriate incident angle and exposure time simultaneously.
The heteroepitaxial growth behavior of patterned ZnO NRAs on single-crystalline p-GaN substrates was investigated first. In order to fabricate large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs with 1D line symmetry on p-GaN, PR line templates were used. GaN has a similar wurtzite crystal structure as ZnO, resulting in very small lattice mismatch (1.9%), which can lead to a perfectly vertically aligned growth of ZnO NRAs.21 For the 2 inch p-GaN wafer adopted in this study, a c-oriented single-crystalline GaN film with a thickness of ∼3 μm was grown on a sapphire wafer by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and the a-axis was perpendicular to the orientation flat (Fig. 3a). Thus, the hexagonal ZnO nanorods epitaxially grown on p-GaN will have the same crystallographic orientation (Fig. 3b). Note that the hexagonal crystallization behavior of the ZnO nanorod exists independently of PR templates, but the morphology of the patterned ZnO NRAs could be influenced by the orientation of the PR templates. If the PR line template is parallel to the a-axis (or any two opposite edges of a nanorod), template restriction will exist in only one direction and wall-like patterned ZnO NRAs with smooth sidewall prefer to be made (Fig. 3c), but if it is perpendicular to the a-axis, a zigzag sidewall pattern tends to be formed (Fig. 3d). To prove this point, a contrast test was performed. The a-axis direction of the p-GaN substrates was marked at the sapphire side beforehand, so that we could separate those two situations out. Based on the PR line templates with two different orientations, large-scale wall-like patterned ZnO NRAs in a period of 774 nm with smooth (Fig. 3e) and zigzag (Fig. 3f) sidewalls were obtained. The results not only met our expectations very well, but also indicate that as long as the growth condition is suitable enough, large-scale patterned ZnO nanowall arrays could be fabricated by using the parallel PR line template.31,32

In order to fabricate large-scale individual patterned ZnO NRAs (a single nanorod in one position) with 2D square and hexagonal symmetries on p-GaN, PR hole templates were adopted. It should be noted that a PR hole template with circular holes, vertical hole sidewalls and no residual PR particles at the bottom of the holes will benefit the fabrication of perfectly hexagonal-faceted ZnO NRAs. Besides, the orientation of the PR hole template will also affect the symmetry of the resulting ZnO NRAs. For instance, a square PR hole template was prepared on p-GaN and the angle between the a-axis and 90° exposure orientation was 8° in design (Fig. 4a). Individual patterned single-crystalline ZnO NRAs in a period of 774 nm with 2D square symmetry were then fabricated. As a result, the arrangement of the ZnO NRAs follows the hole template, including the 8° inclined angle, but the symmetry is broken (Fig. 4c). To realize individual patterned ZnO NRAs with delicate symmetries, it is better to make the 0° exposure orientation perpendicular to the a-axis, which is suitable for both square and hexagonal symmetries (Fig. 4b). By doing so, perfectly individual patterned ZnO NRAs with hexagonal symmetry in the period of 774 nm were obtained (Fig. 4d). What is more, an interesting phenomenon was observed, that the flat-top patterned ZnO NRAs (Fig. 4d) could be turned into rough-top ones (Fig. 4c) after the pH of the initial aqueous solution was changed from 8 to 10 by adding ammonia solution into it. In addition, TEM images of a single rough-top nanorod acquired from the patterned ZnO NRAs (see Fig. 4c) are presented in Fig. 4e and f. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the nanorod shows that the distance between adjacent lattice planes is 0.2598 nm, which indicates that the nanorod is single-crystalline and the growth direction is c-axis [0001] (Fig. 4f).29 Furthermore, the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms that the phase of the nanorod is hexagonal wurtzite structure. The results show that pH = 8 is more suitable for fabricating individual patterned ZnO NRAs with a flat top, which are attractive for a number of applications that aim at integrating ZnO nanodevices and nanosystems, especially piezoelectric nanogenerators, electrically pumped lasers, and light emitting diodes.3,9,10

A single-crystalline GaN film on sapphire has been proved to be suitable for the patterned growth of vertically aligned ZnO NRAs. But for most applications, cost-effective substrates such like Si, glass, steel and polymer are preferred to be adopted, and a buffer layer (ZnO seed layer) is always required in HTS for reducing lattice mismatch and improving adherence between substrate and ZnO NRAs.22,32 Based on the above considerations, the homoepitaxial growth behavior of patterned ZnO NRAs on a polycrystalline ZnO seed layer coated Si substrate was also investigated in this study. Large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs in a period of 1048 nm with 2D square symmetry were fabricated (Fig. 5a and b). The nucleation density for each position is nearly the same due to the fixed hole diameter (∼300 nm). It is obvious that multiple ZnO NRAs (more than seven nanorods) grow out of each hole, mainly because the hole was so wide that lots of small ZnO grains were exposed.21,33 Moreover, the nanorods have relatively small diameters at the root due to the confinement of the PR hole template (Fig. 5c).29 By increasing the growth time from 2 h to 5 h, the height of the bunched ZnO NRAs are increased (from 0.8 μm to 2.1 μm), but the space between them is narrowed considerably (from 400 nm to 100 nm) (Fig. 5d–h), which means that the ZnO NRAs are not perfectly vertically aligned and the growth is no more strictly controlled by the PR hole template after the patterned ZnO NRAs grow out of the holes. This trend is similar to the one shown in ref. 24. Additionally, patterned ZnO NRAs may be broken down by the surface tension of residue water in the drying process.24 In order to realize large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs with uniform distribution, the substrate needs to be supercritically dried.21 These bunched patterned ZnO NRAs, which both cover a high specific surface area and have tunable density and size, could play significant roles in many areas, particularly in solar cells and bio-sensors.34,35

The XRD and PL results of typical ZnO NRAs, such as individual patterned ZnO NRAs with flat-top grown on p-GaN (type I, Fig. 4d) and bunched patterned ZnO NRAs grown on ZnO seed layer coated n-Si (type II, Fig. 5a–c), are presented in Fig. 6. Firstly, the XRD θ–2θ scanning result for type I show only two main peaks at 34.44° and 72.56°, corresponding to the ZnO (002) and (004) planes. This indicates that the individual patterned ZnO NRAs are highly c-axis oriented. However, there are two additional peaks for type II, assigned to diffractions from the (103) plane of ZnO and the (004) plane of Si (Fig. 6a). This is mainly due to the unperfect c-axis orientation of the bunched patterned ZnO NRAs and the large space between them, which leads to the exposure of the ZnO seed layer and Si substrate in the bottom. To give more quantitative investigation, the θ-rocking curves for the two ZnO (002) peaks are presented in the inset of Fig. 6a. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values for type I and II are 0.12 and 0.17, respectively, which means that both of them are highly c-axis oriented because of the small values,17,21 and, comparably, type I has higher epitaxial quality and more perfect vertical alignment due to the use of the single-crystalline GaN film as the substrate. Secondly, the PL spectra show an evident ultraviolet near-band edge emission peak at ∼380 nm (both type I and type II, Fig. 6b), which originates from the excitonic recombination in ZnO NRAs. Besides, there is a broad deep-level emission peak centered at ∼570 nm for type II. This defect peak, which is commonly observed in ZnO NRAs formed via HTS, is reported to originate from oxygen interstitial defects or the presence of OH groups.36 It means that the orientation and luminescence property of patterned ZnO NRAs will be strongly influenced by the buffer layer. For the patterned growth of highly c-axis oriented ZnO NRAs with less defects, a high-quality ZnO seed layer is needed and could be achieved by using radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) or pulsed laser deposition (PLD).22,27

Conclusions
In this work, application-oriented tunable fabrication of large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs has been easily and successfully achieved based on 2BLIL and HTS. By adjusting the substrate, PR template and growth condition, which are the three most important facets among all influencing factors, large-scale patterned ZnO NRAs with tunable arrangement, period and morphology were designed and fabricated. The morphology and symmetry of patterned ZnO NRAs will further be influenced by the orientation of PR template, especially on single crystalline substrate. Moreover, the resulting ZnO NRAs exhibit excellent crystallization and PL characteristics. This combined tunable fabrication method could be widely used in fabricating large-scale patterned semiconductor NRAs for special requirements, which have great potential applications in energy harvesting, solid-state lighting, data storage, system integration and environmental monitoring areas.

 	Fig. 3  Wall-like patterned ZnO NRAs with 1D line symmetries grown on p-GaN by using PR line templates. (a, b) Schematic illustrations of (a) a c-plane (0001) p-GaN wafer and (b) a ZnO nanorod grown on the p-GaN with the same crystallographic orientation. (c, d) Schematic diagrams illustrating the relationship between the orientation of PR line template and the morphology of wall-like patterned ZnO NRAs. (c) The PR line template parallel to the a-axis will lead to a smooth sidewall. (d) A zigzag sidewall will be achieved if the template is perpendicular to the a-axis. (e, f) Top view SEM images of resulting wall-like patterned ZnO NRAs in a period of 774 nm with (e) smooth and (f) zigzag sidewalls. Insets show the corresponding magnified SEM images, scale bars are 300 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  Individual patterned ZnO NRAs with 2D square and hexagonal symmetries fabricated on p-GaN by the use of PR hole templates. (a) Schematic illustration of a square PR hole template prepared on p-GaN, the angle of a-axis to second exposure orientation (90°) was 8° in design. (b) Schematic diagram of a hexagonal PR hole template fabricated on p-GaN, the second exposure orientation (0°) was designed to be perpendicular to the a-axis. (c) 45° tilted view SEM image of the corresponding square patterned ZnO NRAs in a period of 774 nm with rough-top, grown under a pH of 10 for 8 h (inset: the magnified top view SEM image, scale bar: 300 nm). (d) Top view SEM image of the corresponding hexagonal patterned ZnO NRAs in the period of 774 nm with flat-top, grown under pH of 8 for 8 h (inset: the magnified 45° tilted view SEM image, scale bar: 300 nm). (e) TEM and (f) HRTEM images of a c-axis oriented ZnO nanorod acquired from the patterned ZnO NRAs shown in (c). Inset is the corresponding SAED pattern.
