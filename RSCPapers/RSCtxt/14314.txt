    , Accepted 20th December 2011First published on 4th January 2012AbstractNovel nanocomposite films, based on graphene oxide (GO) and TiO2 nanotube arrays, were synthesized by assembling GO on the surface of self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays through a simple impregnation method. The composite films were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical properties of the composite nanotube arrays were investigated under visible light illumination. Remarkably enhanced visible light photoelectrochemical response was observed for the GO decorated TiO2 nanotube composite electrode compared with pristine TiO2 nanotube arrays. The sensitizing effect of GO on the photoelectrochemical response of the TiO2 nanotube arrays was demonstrated and about 15 times enhanced maximum photoconversion efficiency was obtained with the presence of GO. An enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanotube arrays towards the degradation of methyl blue was also demonstrated after modification with GO. The results presented here demonstrate GO to be efficient for the improved utilization of visible light for TiO2 nanotube arrays.
1. Introduction
As a very famous semiconductor, TiO2 has received much attention because of its long-term stability, no toxicity, low cost and broad functionality. Due to its outstanding physical and chemical properties, vertically oriented, highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays have been extensively studied for their application in dye sensitized solar cells,1–4hydrogen generation by water photoelectrolysis1, and so on.
Unfortunately, the wide band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile) makes light absorption occur only in the UV range, which accounts for only 4–5% of the spectrum of solar light. In order to utilize the solar light more efficiently, numerous approaches have been developed to promote the photoresponse of TiO2 in the visible light region. Many researches have demonstrated that TiO2 doped with non-metal elements, such as nitrogen,5,6boron,7fluorine,8 sulphur9 or carbon10,11 and metal elements, such as iron12 or niobium13 show an improved response and higher photocatalytic activity in the visible light region. The coupling of TiO2 to semiconductors has been proved to be another efficient method to enhance its photoresponse under visible light. Several semiconductors, such as CdS,14,15CdTe,16,17CdSe,18,19 PbS,20,21NiO,22 and SrTiO323 have been adopted to improve the utilization of visible light for TiO2 nanotube arrays. However, most of these sensitizers are either highly poisonous or expensive, thus limiting their practical applications. Besides, alternate absorption and rinse processes are often required for quantum dots sensitizers14,21 and high temperature processing is often required for oxide sensitizers.22,23
As one of the most promising precursors of graphene, which has attracted tremendous attention for its unique physicochemical properties,24–28graphene oxide (GO) is environmental friendly and cheap and has been widely studied in recent years. Inorganic materials modified with partially reduced GO have been reported to represent enhanced electrocatalytic29 and photocatalytic properties.30 Nanocomposites based on graphene and TiO2 nanoparticles have been widely investigated and their photocatalytic properties have been demonstrated.31–33 We are highly interested in the photoelectrochemical properties of GO modified TiO2 nanotube arrays, which have not been investigated so far. Herein, GO was assembled onto TiO2 nanotube arrays by simple absorption in an attempt to improve the photoelectrochemical response of the array in the visible light region. The sensitizing effect of GO on the TiO2 nanotubes was first studied by measuring the photoelectrochemical performance of the GO modified TiO2 nanotube arrays under visible light irradiation. Compared with previous strategies, our method presents a combination of advantages, such as a relatively high efficiency, an environmental friendly procedure, a low cost and a facile process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of GO modified TiO2 nanotube arrays

          TiO2
nanotube arrays were fabricated on a Ti substrate by electrochemical anodization. In a typical process, Ti foils were first chemically etched by immersing them in a mixture of 40% HF, HNO3 and deionized water (HF:HNO3:H2O = 1:4:5 in volume) for 30 s and then rinsed with deionized water. The anodic oxidation was performed in a 0.5% HF electrolyte solution in a two-electrode cell with Ti foil as the working electrode and a graphite sheet as the counter electrode in an ice bath under the assistance of magnetic stirring. The Ti foil was subjected to a constant voltage of 20 V for 40 min and the obtained amorphous nanotube arrays were then converted to the anatase phase by annealing at 450 °C for 2 h under ambient conditions.

          Graphene oxide was prepared from purified graphite powders by a modified Hummers method.34,35 The nanocomposite of GO and the TiO2 nanotube arrays was obtained by a simple assembly method. Typically, the obtained TiO2 nanotubes were immersed in a 0.5 mg mL−1 aqueous GO suspension for 5 h and then dried with a nitrogen stream. The modified composite electrode was denoted as GO/TiO2.
2.2 Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) of the TiO2 nanotube arrays was carried out on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer. Raman spectroscopy of the nanocomposite GO/TiO2 nanotube electrode was recorded on a Dilor Labram-1B microspectrometer with 632.8 nm laser excitation. A U-4100 spectrophotometer was used to record the UV–vis absorption spectra of the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell in 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the aqueous electrolyte with a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660A Instruments). TiO2 and GO/TiO2 were used as working electrodes, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. A 500 W xenon lamp with an ultraviolet filter was used as the light source to provide visible light (λ > 420 nm). The working electrodes, with an active area of 0.25 cm2, were subjected to the irradiation of visible light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature.
2.4 Photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue
The obtained samples (1.6 × 2.0 cm2) immersed in 40 mL of methyl blue (MB, 5mg L−1) were first kept in the dark for 2 h to achieve the adsorption equilibrium for MB. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was characterized under the illumination of visible light (λ > 420 nm). The degradation cell was kept at 30 °C with a circulating water system. 2.5 mL of the MB solution was taken out every 30 min to analyze the concentration change of MB with UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (UV2300 spectrophotometer). The solution was put back in the degradation cell after the measurement.
3. Results and discussion
Among all the TiO2 nanostructured materials, highly ordered nanotube arrays have generated considerable scientific interest.36–39 The synthesis process and basic structure of the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays are shown in Fig. 1. The nanocomposite of the GO/TiO2 nanotube arrays were obtained by immersing TiO2 nanotubes in a GO suspension. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of TiO2 and the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), highly ordered, vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays were formed on the Ti substrate, with tubes diameter ranging from 50–70 nm and walls thicknesses ranging from 10–20 nm. After a simple assembly process in the GO suspension, GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays were obtained, with a sheet of GO coating the most surface of the TiO2 nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and 2(d).

XRD was employed to characterize the crystal phase of the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays, as shown in Fig. 3. All the diffraction peaks are ascribed to TiO2 and the Ti substrate. The peak centered at 25.1° indicates that the TiO2 anatase phase is formed after annealing at 450 °C for 2 h. However, no obvious peak for GO was observed in the composite film; this is possibly because of the small amount of assembled GO sheets.

Raman scattering as a local probe is very sensitive to crystallinity and the microstructures of materials and is a powerful tool to determine the quality of carbon materials. Raman spectroscopy was employed to confirm the formation of a TiO2 anatase phase and the existence of GO on the surface of the TiO2 nanotube arrays. The typical Raman spectra of TiO2 and GO/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4. The Raman peaks at 148, 396, 516, 636 cm−1 observed in both samples can be assigned to the Eg, B1g, B1g or A1g, Eg modes of the anatase phase, respectively,40,41 thus confirming the formation of a bulk anatase phase after the annealing treatment. For the GO/TiO2 composite electrode, the two additional prominent peaks centered at 1329 cm−1 and 1607 cm−1 are considered as the characteristic D band and G band of GO, which are ascribed to the breathing mode of the κ-point photons of the A1g symmetry and the first order scattering of the E2g phonon of the sp2 C atoms, respectively.42 Such characteristics demonstrate that the GO sheets were really assembled on the TiO2 nanotube arrays.

Fig. 5 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of TiO2 and the GO/TiO2 composite nanotube arrays. An obvious red shift of the absorption edge is observed for the GO/TiO2 composite compared with the pristine TiO2 electrode. Furthermore, the composite GO/TiO2 nanotube arrays show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region. The red shift of the absorption edge and the improved visible light absorption are potent to explain for the enhanced visible light photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of the GO/TiO2 composite electrode, as described later.

The photoresponse of the TiO2 nanotube array electrode and the GO/TiO2 composite electrode were investigated under the intermittent illumination of visible light with a bias of 0 V (vsAg/AgCl). As shown in Fig. 6, both electrodes show relatively good reproducibility and stability as the illumination was turned on and off. The photocurrent decreased almost to zero instantly as long as the illumination was interrupted and the photocurrent came back close to the original value as the illumination was turned on. It is interesting to note that the GO/TiO2 composite electrode exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.63 μA cm−2, which was about 2.3 times larger than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotube electrode with a photocurrent density of 0.28 μA cm−2. The remarkably enhanced photocurrent may be ascribed to faster electron transport and a more efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons in the GO anchored TiO2 nanotube arrays.

The transient open circuit potential (OCP) of the TiO2 nanotube electrode and the GO/TiO2 composite electrode under the intermittent illumination of visible light are shown in Fig. 7. A photovoltage of about 0.085 V was observed for the GO/TiO2 composite electrode, while it was 0.057 V for the pristine TiO2 electrode. The photovoltage increased about 1.5 times due to the GO modification, thus also demonstrating the sensitizing effects of GO on the photoelectrochemical properties of the TiO2 nanotube arrays.

The representative I–V characteristics of the TiO2 and GO/TiO2 composite nanotube electrodes under visible light illumination are shown in Fig. 8(A). A significantly increased photocurrent was observed for the GO/TiO2 composite electrode throughout the potential region compared with the TiO2 nanotube electrode, which further confirms the positive role of GO in improving the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 nanotube arrays. The corresponding conversion efficiency of light energy to chemical energy as a function of the applied potential is shown in Fig. 8(B), which is calculated according to the following formula, which has been described previously.10  Where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input and I0 is the power density of the incident light (mW cm−2), E0revis the standard reversible potential which is 1.23V vs.NHE, and the applied potential Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vsAg/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vsAg/AgCl) of the same electrode at an open circuit under the same conditions.

A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.0487% was obtained for the GO/TiO2 composite electrode under visible light, while it is only 0.0033% for the pristine TiO2 nanotube electrode. The maximum photoconversion efficiency increased about 15 times as a result of the GO modification, which means that GO is highly efficient in improving the utilization of visible light for TiO2 nanotube arrays.

Fig. 9 shows the GO/TiO2 induced photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB) under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The concentration of MB at different times was determined by the absorption value at 664 nm. As shown in Fig. 9, an enhanced photocatalytic activity was observed for the GO/TiO2 composite throughout the illumination compared with the TiO2 nanotube arrays, whose photocatalytic degradation behavior shown here was consistent with a previous report.21 GO was therefore demonstrated to be able to improve the visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotube arrays.

The observed enhanced visible light absorption may account for the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performance of GO modified TiO2 nanotube arrays. However, further research is necessary to study the detailed mechanism of the sensitizing effect and the influence of the amount of absorbed GO sheets on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of the composite material.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have firstly developed a novel hybrid material composed of graphene oxide network on the surface of TiO2 nanotube arrays. The sensitizing effect of GO on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of the TiO2 nanotube arrays under visible light was demonstrated. About a 15 times increase in the photoconversion efficiency was observed for the GO modified TiO2 nanotube arrays compared with pristine TiO2 under visible light illumination. Given the relatively high sensitizing efficiency, low cost and environmental friendly properties of GO, it is reasonable to conclude that GO anchored to TiO2 nanotube arrays could be a promising style of nanoarchitecture to promote the utilization of visible light under ambient conditions.
