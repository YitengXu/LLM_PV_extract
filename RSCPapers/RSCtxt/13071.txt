E-mail: arnaud.delcorte@uclouvain.beReceived 23rd May 2013, Accepted 28th August 2013First published on 2nd September 2013AbstractWith the recent developments in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), it is now possible to obtain molecular depth profiles and 3D molecular images of organic thin films, i.e. SIMS depth profiles where the molecular information of the mass spectrum is retained through the sputtering of the sample. Several approaches have been proposed for “damageless” profiling, including the sputtering with SF5+ and C60+ clusters, low energy Cs+ ions and, more recently, large noble gas clusters (Ar500–5000+). In this article, we evaluate the merits of these different approaches for the in depth analysis of organic photovoltaic heterojunctions involving poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor. It is demonstrated that the use of 30 keV C603+ and 500 eV Cs+ (500 eV per atom) leads to strong artifacts for layers in which the fullerene derivative PCBM is involved, related to crosslinking and topography development. In comparison, the profiles obtained using 10 keV Ar1700+ (∼6 eV per atom) do not indicate any sign of artifacts and reveal fine compositional details in the blends. However, increasing the energy of the Ar cluster beam beyond that value leads to irreversible damage and failure of the molecular depth profiling. The profile qualities, apparent interface widths and sputtering yields are analyzed in detail. On the grounds of these experiments and recent molecular dynamics simulations, the discussion addresses the issues of damage and crater formation induced by the sputtering and the analysis ions in such radiation-sensitive materials, and their effects on the profile quality and the depth resolution. Solutions are proposed to optimize the depth resolution using either large Ar clusters or low energy cesium projectiles for sputtering and/or analysis.1. IntroductionOrganic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are of scientific and technological interest as they have the potential to become an attractive alternative for low-cost power generation. Instead of requiring high energy processes and high purity silicon, OPV cells are based on organic conductors and semiconductors which can be applied from the gas or the liquid phase. Active photovoltaic multilayers can be obtained from the liquid phase by techniques such as spin coating, spray coating, screen printing or inkjet printing, which are rather cheap and, for the last three, easily scalable into industrial processes for wide device areas. The most widespread device structure is the bulk or planar heterojunction.1–3 The system consisting of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has shown power conversion efficiencies of about 4–5% under standard solar conditions.4–7Precise control of the molecular structure of such complex organic multilayers, e.g. chemical purity,8 layer uniformity, morphology,9 phase separation and interfaces,10,11 diffusion,12,13 and effects of annealing,14,15 is required in order to improve the performance of the devices and the characterization remains a challenge. To address these questions, molecular analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) constitutes a method of choice. Recently, several protocols of molecular depth profiling and 3D imaging by time-of-flight (ToF) SIMS have been proposed, essentially relying on a dual-beam approach where one type of (cluster) ion source is used for “damageless” sputtering and a better focussed beam is used for mass spectral characterization and imaging all along the depth profile experiment. The main combinations involve a liquid metal ion gun (Ga+/Bin+) for analysis and either a low energy (250–500 eV) Cs+ beam or a higher energy (5–40 keV) cluster beam (SF5+/C60n+/Ar500–5000+) for sample sputtering. An alternative approach consists in performing single beam depth profiling, with a continuous primary cluster beam.16,17 This approach, originally developed for biological samples, has specific advantages and drawbacks with respect to the dual beam procedure and will not be considered here. However, it should be mentioned that the problems encountered with certain sputtering beams in the dual beam approach exist as well in the single beam approach.A vast amount of literature exists concerning the sputtering and molecular depth profiling of materials with SF5+ (ref. 18) and especially C60n+ [ref. 19 and 20 and references therein], including materials relevant to organic electronics. In particular, it was shown that OLED materials such as Alq3 could not be satisfactorily profiled with C60n+ ions at room temperature, presumably because of beam-induced cross-linking.21 The same was true for fullerene layers, i.e. molecules often used in OPV devices.22 Low energy Cs+ ions provide interesting results for a series of polymers which are problematic for SF5+ and C60n+ sputtering, such as polystyrene and polycarbonate,23 but crater bottom roughening and probable degradation of fullerenes were reported for P3HT:C60 heterojunction solar cells.15 Large noble gas cluster ions have already proven to deliver better performance than SF5+ and C60n+ when the other beams failed24 and there are some reports concerning organic electronic layers.25 In particular, OLED multilayers including Alq3 and other molecules could be successfully depth profiled with large Ar clusters.26,27This article focusses on the SIMS molecular depth profile analysis of two model OPV samples made of organic bilayers spin cast on indium tin oxide (ITO), P3HT/PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS. The main goal is to compare the respective merits of different sputtering beams (Cs+/C60+/Ar1700+), using the same analysis beam (Bi3+), from both the analytical and the fundamental point of view. Beyond the comparison of the profile qualities, sputtering yields and interface widths, the discussion addresses the limitations of molecular depth profiling, even in the best case scenario of sputtering with Arn clusters, and indicates perspectives towards improving the performance. One of them concerns the optimisation of the analysis beam nature and parameters.2. Experimental sectionMaterials and samplesPhotovoltaic materials of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios™ P VP AI 4083) were used as received. The multilayer films of P3HT/PEDOT:PSS (sample A) and P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS (sample B) were prepared by spin coating using the indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass as a substrate. The ITO-coated glass was first cleaned and then treated with UV-ozone. A layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated to a thickness of 70 nm on the ITO-coated glass at a rotation speed of 1200 rpm, followed by heating for 2 min at 50 °C and then for 6 min at 150 °C. Active layers were spin coated in air. For pure P3HT films, a 20 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene solution was stirred for 24 hours at 70 °C. The solution was then filtered and spin coated (600 rpm) to a thickness of 80 nm on PEDOT:PSS. For the P3HT:PCBM layers, a mixture (20 mg each per ml chlorobenzene) was prepared by stirring at 70 °C for 24 hours, followed by filtration and spin coating (600 rpm, 20 s) to a thickness of 140 nm on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The chemical formulae of the materials and the multilayer structures of the samples are summarized in Fig. 1. The layer thicknesses were obtained by ellipsometric measurements. The organic layer topographies after spin-coating were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM images and linescans indicate a RMS roughness of 5.8 nm, 3.5 nm and 1.1 nm for single P3HT, P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS layers, respectively (Fig. 2).

Molecular depth profilingSIMS depth profiles were obtained using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer TOF-SIMS 5 from IONTOF GmbH (Münster, Germany), operating in the dual beam mode. The instrument was equipped with a Bin-LMIG used as the analysis gun and with two additional columns for sputter ion guns. These columns were initially carrying a Cs and a C60 source (10 kV), which was replaced by an Arn cluster source (20 kV) in the course of this study. The Ar cluster ion gun provides a mass filtered (with a mass resolution of about 3.5) cluster beam with cluster sizes ranging from 500 to 10000 atoms. All the ion columns are mounted at 45° with respect to the sample surface. The time-of-flight mass analyzer is positioned perpendicular to the sample surface. Depth profiles were carried out in the ‘non-interlaced’ mode, consisting of cycles of short pulses of Bi3+ ions for SIMS analysis followed by longer periods of Ar1700+, C603+ or Cs+ ion sputtering, during which the analyzer extraction potential was switched off. In the data reported in this article, the Cs+, C603+, and Ar1700+ ions had impact energies of 500 eV, 30 keV and 10 keV, respectively, which are common energy values for molecular depth profiling. The energies per atom were, therefore, 500 eV for Cs+, 500 eV for C603+ and ∼6 eV for Ar1700+. Beam currents were measured using a Faraday cup on the sample holder both before and after each experiment. For depth profiling, a focussed beam of primary ions was rastered over an area of typically 400 × 400 μm2, 500 × 500 μm2 and 300 × 300 μm2 for C603+, Ar1700+ and Cs+ ions, respectively. For analysis, a pulsed beam of 30 keV Bi3+ ions was rastered on a 150 × 150 μm2 area in the centre of the sputter crater. To avoid the effects of uneven dose at the crater edges, the depth profiles were reconstructed by data processing from a smaller area at the centre of the analyzed region (length ≤ 1/3 of the sputtering crater edge, e.g. 100 μm for Cs+ sputtering). Charge compensation with an electron flood gun was used during the sputtering and analysis cycles. A post-acceleration voltage of 10 kV was applied in front of the detector for improved high mass sensitivity in the analysis stages.3. ResultsDepth profilesThe depth profiles measured for the system P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/ITO (sample A) are displayed in Fig. 3 for the three considered sputtering conditions. In these depth-profiles, the selected ions are In3O3− (m/z 393) for the ITO substrate, C8H7SO3− (m/z 183) for the PEDOT:PSS layer and C4HS− (m/z 81) a marker for P3HT but which, like the other secondary ions of P3HT, can also be produced as a fragmentation of PEDOT:PSS. The ion C8H7SO3−, more sample-specific, represents the intact monomeric unit of PSS. The Ar1700+ profile exhibits almost no transient phase and very stable plateau intensities in the two organic layers, with well-defined interfaces between the layers (Fig. 3a). The C603+ profile bears a general resemblance with the previous one but there is a rather long transient before reaching the steady state in the top P3HT layer and the steady state is never really reached in the PEDOT:PSS bottom layer, as indicated by the continuously decreasing intensity of the PSS monomer ion down to the ITO interface (Fig. 3b). The Cs+ profile also shows three well-separated regions but there are specific features. First, there is an initial transient phase in which all the intensities rise from a very small to a maximum value, mirroring the dynamics of Cs implantation in the surface, because the fragment ionization probabilities are directly connected to the Cs concentration. The steady-state is better defined than in the case of C603+ bombardment, with very flat ion intensity profiles in the different layers of the sample, in a manner that is comparable with the Ar1700+ profile. However, a major difference concerns the C4HS− intensity, which decreases by one order of magnitude at the P3HT/PEDOT:PSS interface in the case of Ar1700+ sputtering and increases significantly in the case of Cs+ sputtering. The latter intensity increase might be due to a different degradation/fragmentation of the two materials by the Cs+ beam, and also to a different ionization probability of the C4HS fragment in the two layers. Indeed, the saturation intensity of the Cs− ion is significantly larger in the PEDOT:PSS bottom layer than in the P3HT top layer, which indicates a larger concentration of Cs in the PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, a larger ionization enhancement by Cs is expected in that layer. Despite the differences, the three profiles provide the same general information, i.e. the formation of two well separated layers and a significant diffusion of indium in the PEDOT:PSS bottom layer. Such a diffusion of In and the related instability of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO interface were first observed using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy by de Jong et al.28 They showed that sample annealing and further exposure to air for a few days can lead to a saturation concentration of 1.2 at.% of In in the PEDOT:PSS layer. The interface instability is explained by the acidity of PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 3  Secondary ion intensity of selected ions as a function of the sputter ion fluence upon dual beam depth profiling of sample A (P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/ITO). Analysis beam: 30 keV Bi3+. Three different sputtering beams: (a) 10 keV Ar1700+; (b) 30 keV C603+; (c) 500 eV Cs+. Fig. 4a shows the Ar1700+ depth profiles measured for the organic bilayer P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO (sample B). Two additional ion profiles are reported, accounting for the evolution of the PCBM distribution in the film, the ion C60− (m/z 720) and the intact molecular ion (C72H14O2−; m/z 910). All these ions provide clear steady states in their respective layers, forming plateaus with intensities in the range 104 to 105 (ion yields in the 10−5 to 10−4 range), except for the molecular ion of PCBM whose signal is one order of magnitude less intense. The interfaces are very well defined. Again, the profile indicates diffusion of indium in the PEDOT:PSS layer. An intensity increase of the PCBM ions occurs at the interface with the PEDOT:PSS layer, which is accompanied by a small decrease of the C4HS− (P3HT), just before the interface (see Fig. 4d with the zoom of the gray area of Fig. 4a). This observation probably indicates some segregation in the blend at the interface with the PEDOT:PSS bottom layer. An enrichment in PCBM at the PEDOT:PSS interface was also reported in other studies of the same system.29 Fig. 4  Secondary ion intensity of selected ions as a function of the sputter ion fluence upon dual beam depth profiling of sample B (P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO). Analysis beam: 30 keV Bi3+. Three different sputtering beams: (a and d) 10 keV Ar1700+; (b) 30 keV C603+; (c) 500 eV Cs+. Inset (d) shows a zoom of the intensity variation of ions C60− and C4HS− in the gray region of (a) (linear scale). In comparison the two other sources give much less useful results (Fig. 4b and c). Depth profiling the PCBM:P3HT layer with 30 keV C603+ fails largely, to the extent that all characteristic signals are quickly lost and the substrate is not reached even with 6–7 × 1015 primary ions (less than 2 × 1014 is needed to reach the interface with sample A). The C603+ depth profile of a thinner P3HT:PCBM single layer (80 nm) cast on ITO also shows that the signals that are the most characteristic of PCBM, such as C60−, decrease by 2 orders of magnitude with a fluence of 0.5 × 1014 ions per cm2 (Fig. 5). In this case, however, the interface with the ITO substrate is reached, as indicated by the signal of In3O3−, even though the rise of the substrate signal is very slow. A similar dependence of the profile quality on the layer thickness (transition between “reasonable profiling” and “no interface reached”) has also been observed for small polystyrene oligomers sputtered by fullerenes.30 Fig. 5  Secondary ion intensity of selected ions as a function of the sputter ion fluence upon dual beam depth profiling of a 80 nm thick P3HT:PCBM blend (single layer) cast on ITO. Analysis beam: 30 keV Bi3+. Sputtering beam: 30 keV C603+. The 500 eV Cs+ profile of sample B is quite peculiar, with pronounced ion intensity variations following the quick increase and stabilization of the Cs+ signal. Surprisingly, the subsequent and slower rise of the Cs+ is accompanied by a decrease of the characteristic signals of P3HT and PCBM. This evolution is difficult to match with the Ar1700+ profile of Fig. 4a, even though a maximum of the PCBM intensities could be seen at the beginning of that profile. With Cs+, the profile of the P3HT:PCBM layer is stretched over a comparatively large ion fluence in comparison with the PEDOT:PSS layer and no real plateau is observed in any of the layers, at odds with the Ar1700+ profile. The Cs+ intensity itself keeps changing along the profile, an indication that there is no steady state and that the measured profile is not fully reliable.The regions of the negative ion mass spectra corresponding to the characteristic ions of PCBM (molecular ion and fullerene fragment), obtained with the 30 keV Bi3+ analysis beam, are presented in Fig. 6, before sputtering (Fig. 6a) and after removal of ∼70 nm of the P3HT:PCBM layer with Ar1700+ (Fig. 6b) and Cs+ (Fig. 6c), respectively. The mass spectra obtained before and after sputtering are practically unchanged in the case of Ar1700+ bombardment, confirming that there is no measurable degradation of the sample by the sputtering beam. In the case of Cs+ etching, however, the characteristic ion intensities are reduced to almost zero, which demonstrates the heavy damage caused in the sample despite the rather low energy of the beam. Fig. 6  Region of interest of the negative secondary ion mass spectrum of sample B showing the molecular ion of PCBM (m/z 910) and the C60− fragment (m/z 720) measured before (a) and after sputtering of ∼70 nm of the P3HT:PCBM layer by (b) 10 keV Ar1700+; (c) 500 eV Cs+. In order to further investigate possible damage induced by the Ar cluster sputtering beam, in addition to 10 keV Ar1700+ (5.9 eV per atom), depth profiling of sample B was also performed with 15 keV and 20 keV Ar1700+, which correspond respectively to 8.8 and 11.8 eV per atom, i.e. energies that are significantly larger than the bond energies in the solid. The evolution of a series of characteristic ions of PCBM and P3HT and of the C− ions obtained in these two experiments is represented in Fig. 7. Clearly, the signal of the characteristic ions of the materials decreases continuously over a fluence of 5 × 1014 ions per cm2 (while it was already stabilized with 1014 ions per cm2 at 10 keV, Fig. 4), demonstrating that the depth profile experiment fails at those higher energies. The intensities of C60− and of the molecular ion of PCBM decay most rapidly and the signal of P3HT (Fig. 7a) also decreases quickly at 20 keV, indicating irreversible damage to both polymers at that energy. At 15 keV, the fragment signal of P3HT tends to stabilize while that of PCBM is lost. The stabilization of the C− signal in both cases shows that artifacts such as charging effects can be excluded (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7  Secondary ion intensity of selected ions as a function of the sputter ion fluence upon dual beam depth profiling of sample B (P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO). Analysis beam: 30 keV Bi3+. Sputtering beams: 15 and 20 keV Ar1700+. Sputter ratesThe sputter rates reported in Table 1 represent an average volume of material removed per incident primary ion (nm3 per ion) and were determined by dividing the film thicknesses (in nm) by the primary ion fluence required to reach the interface, where the interface is defined as the point at which the intensity of polymer signal becomes 50% of its steady-state value.31 The measured yield volumes are very similar for all the analyzed materials in the case of 10 keV Ar1700+ bombardment, i.e. ∼21 nm3 per ion. The yield volumes measured for 30 keV C603+ bombardment are about 4 times larger for P3HT and PEDOT:PSS but they could not be determined for the P3HT:PCBM blend because of the failure of the depth-profiling. The impossibility to reach the substrate in that case indicates a transition to a regime of net deposition, and as a consequence, a decrease of the sputtered material quantity from a value comparable to the other materials to a very small value. In the case of 500 eV Cs+ bombardment, the sputter yield volumes are in the range 0.1–0.2 nm3 per ion, that is, about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than with Ar1700+. However, it is important to note that in the case of Cs+, the dependence of the yield volume on the nature of the material is significant, leading to distortion of the profiles and the impossibility to linearly transform the fluence scale into a depth scale in the case of hybrid or multilayer samples such as those considered in this article.

In comparison with the falling edge, the rising edge is considered to be less influenced by the conditions of primary ion bombardment and should provide a better estimate of the actual interface width.33 It should be noted here that, in contrast to the interface with the ITO substrate, the real width of the interface between the two organic layers is difficult to determine and it could be affected by some interlayer mixing upon spin-coating. However, this could not explain the differences observed between the 3 considered beam conditions (Table 2). The interface width values retrieved from the Ar1700+ profile are in the range of 8–14 nm, depending on the considered sample and the interface. The values obtained for the P3HT layer of sample A sputtered by C603+ are similar to those of Ar1700+, but, interestingly, the apparent width obtained for the second interface with the ITO substrate is significantly larger (20 nm), indicating a continued building up of the roughness induced by the bombardment in the PEDOT:PSS layer. This effect is also observed to some extent in the case of Cs+ bombardment. For Cs+ bombardment, the apparent interface widths measured for single layers of P3HT and PEDOT:PSS cast on ITO were respectively 17 ± 1 nm and 7 ± 1 nm. The first value is very close to the one obtained for the bilayer, which indicates that the apparent broadening of the interfaces in the bilayer is probably dominated by the initial RMS roughness of 5.8 nm and the relatively important topography build up in the P3HT layer. However, the measurement of an apparent interface width of 7 nm of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO interface, despite the very limited initial roughness (1.1 nm), also raises questions that will be considered in more detail in the discussion. In comparison with Ar1700+, Cs+ provides apparent interface widths that are 2–3 times larger for sample B. Again, a strong topography build up upon depth profiling must be advocated.

DiscussionOn all accounts, dual beam profiling with the combination 10 keV Ar1700+/30 keV Bi3+ performs much better than the two other configurations tested in this article for state-of-the-art OPV samples made of the molecules P3HT, PCBM, PEDOT and PSS. This conclusion is in line with recent reports comparing the use of Arn+ clusters to other types of sputtering beams for the molecular depth profiling of other kinds of organic samples.22,34–37 However, our results also demonstrate that increasing the energy beyond 10 keV for Ar1700+ clusters, i.e. beyond ∼6 eV per Ar atom, leads to the degradation of the P3HT:PCBM sample and to the failure of the depth-profiling. Therefore this energy should not be exceeded for such sensitive samples. The cross-linking of fullerite samples upon Arn bombardment was demonstrated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a strong dependence on the energy per atom in the projectile.38 Our experimental results involving PCBM provide an experimental confirmation of this effect. The fact that the signal of P3HT decays upon bombardment indicates that the reactions induced in the solid also affect the other component of the blend and not just PCBM. The situation at 15 keV might indicate an intermediate situation where the crosslinking of PCBM proceeds while P3HT is not dramatically damaged.The best depth resolutions obtained with Arn+ clusters correspond to low beam energies (2.5 keV) and they were never better than 4–5 nm.27,34 The values obtained in this paper for the OPV materials bombarded by 10 keV Ar1700+ fit in the reported trends. Experimentally, a correlation between the depth resolution and the cubic root of the sputtered volume could be found, suggesting a direct relationship between the depth resolution and the impact crater depth.27,34 Indeed, the values of crater depths obtained from MD simulations of Arn cluster bombardment of polyethylene are comparable and the crater volumes increase linearly with the total energy of the cluster.39,40 In order to improve the depth resolution, the crater depths could be reduced either by decreasing the incident energy or increasing the incidence angle with respect to the surface normal. Nevertheless, the extent of the mesoscopic effect, inherent to the cluster–surface interaction, might remain limiting.40The results obtained with C603+ are poor for certain materials, including PCBM, which tend to crosslink heavily under irradiation. The tailing of the organic ion profiles and the slow rise of the substrate signal in Fig. 5 indicate the cross-linking induced roughness in the case of PCBM-containing layers. In terms of beam-induced chemistry, MD simulations demonstrate that C60 is worse than Ar cluster projectiles because it helps the crosslinking process by depositing ∼60 reactive carbon radicals in the surface for each projectile impact.38,41 Even though sample cooling and rotation may improve the situation, it is now widely recognized that fullerenes are not the best for depth profiling a large number of organic samples.20,34Molecular depth profiling with low-energy Cs+ beams essentially relies on the increase of the negative ionization probability of organic fragments and, presumably, on the quenching of the reactive carbon radicals created in the solid, by implanted Cs atoms.23 The small implantation depth of the low-energy Cs should limit the extent of the damaged layer and the nature and energy of the projectile should not lead to cratering but rather to a collision cascade-type process, with a minimal emission depth for polyatomic fragments.42 Therefore, the conditions would seem to be optimal in terms of depth resolution, provided that sufficiently sample-specific ion signals can be followed through the profile. Indeed, depth profiles obtained recently on OLED devices using a 500 eV Cs+ ion source in the single beam, continuous bombardment mode indicate values of interfacial widths in the range of 2–4 nm for an initial layer roughness of ∼1 nm.43 In this respect, the data obtained for the combination 500 eV Cs+/30 keV Bi3+ raise questions, because the depth resolutions are poor and, in particular, they are consistently worse than those calculated for the Ar1700+ depth profiles. A possible explanation relates to the roughness of the bottom of the sputtered zone upon profiling. First, the initial roughness of the P3HT and P3HT:PCBM spin coated layers is significantly larger than the one of the evaporated OLED layers in ref. 43 and this roughness should lead to an equivalent broadening of the interface widths measured in the profile. But this should be largely true for 45° Ar1700+ bombardment too. Then, it is reasonable to think that the 500 eV Cs+ beam induces damage and additional topography in the OPV bilayers, even when PCBM is absent of the formulation. Despite the relatively low energy of the Cs ions, they still carry ∼100 times more energy than the individual Ar atoms of the large noble gas clusters and create atomic displacements in the solid through collision cascades.Another possible cause of interface broadening that is usually not discussed in the ToF-SIMS molecular depth profiling reports using the dual beam approach concerns the analysis beam itself. 10–60 keV Bi3+ ions are often used for analysis in dual beam depth profiling experiments.34 Our recent MD simulations show that Bi3 clusters create craters in polymers that are equivalent in size to those generated by isoenergetic C60 projectiles44 and the volumes of which are roughly proportional to the kinetic energy of the cluster (Fig. 8). The crater depth calculated for a normal impact of 15 keV Bi3 in the amorphous polyethylene sample made of 1.5 kDa oligomers is ∼10 nm (Fig. 8d). Even though the incidence angle is off-normal in most experiments (usually 45°), which should lead to smaller crater depth,39 the energy is often larger and, therefore, the crater and emission depth should not be smaller. With such a crater depth, Bi3 ions should be able to uncover and sputter molecules buried a few nanometers under the surface and their contribution to the depth resolution should not be neglected. The analysis beam could also contribute to explain the differences observed between these results and those of ref. 43, where 500 eV Cs+ is used for both sputtering and analysis. Beside the use of low-energy atomic ions for analysis, a tractable alternative for improved depth-resolution might be the use of large Arn clusters for both analysis and sputtering, in an optimized configuration, i.e. low impact energy and oblique incidence. Thus, our study suggests that sputtering with large Ar clusters at oblique incidence and analysis either with the same beam or with low-energy monoatomic ions should lead to optimized depth-profiles for sensitive organic samples such as OPV layers.

ConclusionThe study of organic heterojunction photovoltaic layers by ToF-SIMS using three different sputtering beams demonstrates that low-energy per atom Arn superclusters perform much better than the other tested beams (Cs, C60) for the molecular depth profiling of the considered OPV materials. Beyond the higher quality of the retained molecular information (e.g. the molecular ion of PCBM) and the better ion signal stability in the steady-states, the measured interface widths are also consistently smaller, which is indicative of lower beam-induced damage and topography. The reduction of experimental artefacts related to the sputtering beam allows us to analyse finer details of the sample structure such as the interfacial segregation of one component of the blend. The data reported in this article therefore extend the range of successful application of molecular depth profiling by Arn clusters to a class of materials important for organic photovoltaic applications. Beyond these observations, our article also investigates the limitations of molecular depth profiling using cluster beams, even in the best case scenario where large Arn clusters are used for sputtering, and considers tractable solutions. First, the energy per atom of the Ar cluster beam should not exceed 6 eV for such sensitive samples, higher energies leading to sample degradation and failure of the depth-profile. Second, the difficulty of reaching depth resolutions better than a few nm with cluster impacts, related to the mesoscopic nature of the interaction (cratering), is pointed out. Possible improvements involve low Arn cluster impact energies and more oblique incidence. Third, on the basis of recent theoretical studies conducted in our group, it is suggested that the influence of the analysis beam (30 keV Bi3+ in this study) on the ultimate depth resolution should not be overlooked and that optimisation should also be conducted at that level.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the European Community via the FP7 project 3D-Nanochemiscope (grant no.
