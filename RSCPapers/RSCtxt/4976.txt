    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 4th October 2018AbstractA Z-scheme heterostructure is a kind of highly efficient photocatalyst that can not only reduce the forbidden band width of the semiconductor but also promote the redox reaction in the photocatalytic system. Herein, calculations on the work function and charge density difference by density functional theory (DFT) methods prove that g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are Z-scheme heterostructures. Compared to g-C3N4, the Z-scheme heterostructures show narrower band gaps, and red-shifted and stronger light absorption with remarkably improved photocatalytic activity. The reaction free energy for each step of the CO2 reduction process was calculated to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2. The products of CO2RR catalyzed by g-C3N4/SnS2 are CH3OH and CH4, which are in good agreement with experiments, and the rate-determining step is CO2 → COOH* with a ΔG of 1.10 eV. For B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the optimal path is CO2 → COOH* → CO* → HCO* → CHOH* → CH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4, and the rate-determining step is CH2* → CH3* with a ΔG of 0.40 eV. The results show that the CO2 reduction activity of B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is better than that of g-C3N4/SnS2. Therefore, the Z-scheme B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure is predicted to be a promising catalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4.
1. Introduction
The rising level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused severe global warming and environmental pollution.1–4 Photocatalytic CO2 conversion into hydrocarbon fuels is a promising technique that can simultaneously lower the atmospheric CO2 level and provide sustainable energy to solve the depletion of fossil resources. Solar energy is abundant, clean and sustainable,5 so that photocatalysis has huge potential to conquer the above problems.6 A large number of single-component visible-light driven semiconductors (such as TiO2) have already been discovered and applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, single-component semiconductor photocatalysts meet various disadvantages, such as low visible-light utilization and fast recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons. Recently, heterostructures formed by constructing two different semiconductors together have been demonstrated to be highly effective for improving photocatalytic efficiency.7 in particular, a new type of semiconductor heterostructure called a Z-scheme system has been constructed in recent days.8,9 As shown in Scheme 1, the Z-scheme photocatalytic process involves two-step photoexcitation. In the first step, the electrons in the valence band (VB) of photosystem II (PS II) are excited to its conduction band (CB) under solar light. Then, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of PS II are transferred to the VB of photosystem I (PS I). Further, the electrons in the VB of PS I are excited to its CB. Finally, the photogenerated electrons and holes are left in the CB of PS I and the VB of PS II, respectively. The photogenerated holes on the VB of PS II have strong oxidation capacity and can oxidize water and organic pollutants, while the electrons on the CB of PS I have strong reduction ability and can produce hydrogen and reduce CO2. As a result, the Z-scheme photocatalytic system not only features the spatial isolation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which inhibits electron–hole recombination, but is also beneficial for the thermodynamic redox reaction, as its CB potential is more negative and its VB potential is more positive. Considering these unique advantages of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system, Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalysts have been widely investigated. For example, the Z-scheme CdS/WO310 photocatalyst shows a higher activity towards photocatalytic CO2 reduction than its single-component photocatalysts, and exceeds the rates observed in single-component WO3 and CdS samples by approximately 100 and ten times, respectively, under the same reaction conditions.

Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with its unique band structure has been widely applied in the field of photocatalysis. In 2009, Wang et al.11 reported that g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst was able to generate hydrogen from water in the visible light region. However g-C3N4 suffers from high recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs that results in lower photocatalytic efficiency. Constructing a g-C3N4-based heterostructure is an efficient way to overcome this disadvantage. Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2,12,13 g-C3N4/Ag3WO414 and g-C3N4/ZnO15 were constructed, showing that these heterostructures restrain the recombination of photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic efficiency. Yu et al.15 synthesized a Z-scheme g-C3N4/ZnO photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH3OH, which exhibited high photocatalytic activity and a high CH3OH production yield for CO2 reduction in comparison with g-C3N4. The CO2 conversion rate of the Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 photocatalyst16 is 57.5 μmol h−1 gcat−1, which is 6.1 times higher than that of g-C3N4. For a Z-scheme heterostructure, g-C3N4 is usually used as PS I because the VB and CB positions of g-C3N4 are relatively high.17
SnS2 is an n-type semiconductor photocatalyst, which has been attracting increasing attention due to its cheapness, abundance, non-toxicity and suitable band gap (about 2.4 eV).18–21 It has been proved experimentally21,22 and theoretically23 that SnS2, as a promising PS II candidate combined with g-C3N4, can efficiently enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. Moreover, the g-C3N4/SnS2 photocatalyst is a typical Z-scheme p–n type heterostructure.22 The advantage of a Z-scheme p–n type heterostructure is the faster transmission of photogenerated holes than by an n–n type heterostructure, which is quite important for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst.24 B-doped g-C3N4 was synthesized and it was confirmed that it is a p-type photocatalyst and its photocatalytic ability is better than that of g-C3N4.25
In the present work, a B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure is designed and the photocatalytic performance on CO2 reduction is explored in comparison with a g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure. An analysis of interfacial properties indicates that B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is a Z-scheme heterostructure. The photocatalytic mechanism of CO2 reduction shows that the CO2 reduction photocatalytic activity of B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is higher than that of g-C3N4/SnS2.
2. Computational details
All the geometric optimizations and single-point energy calculations were performed with the DMol3 code.26,27 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (PBE)28 exchange–correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used. The DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSSP) method was employed to treat the relativistic effect of transition metals by introducing some degree of relativistic correction to replace core electrons by a single effective potential.29 The PBE+D2 method with the Grimme van der Waals (vdW) correction30 was employed to treat the weak interactions between various intermediates and the catalyst. Electron spin-polarization was involved in all the calculations. The criteria for convergence in energy, force and displacement are 1.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively. The Brillouin zone integration was performed with 4 × 4 × 1 k-points for geometry optimization. A conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used to simulate the water solvent environment throughout the whole process, and the dielectric constant was set as 78.54 for H2O solvent.31 The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG)32,33 was defined as: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH + ΔGU(1)where ΔE is the electronic energy difference directly obtained from DFT calculations, ΔEZPE is the change in zero-point energy, T is the temperature (298.15 K), and ΔS is the entropy change. ΔGU = −neU, where n is the number of transferred electrons and U is the electrode potential. ΔGpH is the correction of the H+ free energy by the concentration; ΔGpH = kBT × ln10 × pH, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and the value of pH was set to be zero for acidic conditions. Zero-point energies and total entropies of molecules were computed from the vibrational frequencies. The vibrational modes of the adsorbate were computed explicitly, while the catalyst sheet was fixed (assuming that the vibrations of the substrate were negligible). The adsorption energies (Eads)33 were calculated by the following equation: Eads = EA–S − ES − EA(2)where EA–S, ES, and EA are the total energies of the adsorbate–substrate (A–S) complex, the substrate (S), and the absorbate (A), respectively.
The band structure, partial density of states (PDOS), work function and charge density difference were simulated with the plane-wave ultrasoft (PWUS) pseudopotential method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP)34,35 code by the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)36,37 hybrid functional. The absorption spectra were obtained with the PBE functional in CASTEP.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structures
Before constructing the heterostructures, suitable lattice structures of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2 were selected and calculated. The optimized lattice constants of the g-C3N4 (a = b = 7.14 Å), SnS2 (a = b = 3.70 Å) unit cells, and the B-doped g-C3N4 (a = b = 14.27 Å) supercell were obtained fully consistent with the previous results.38 Considering the lattice match between two components, as shown in Fig. 1d, a 4 × 4 SnS2 supercell was strained by 0.5% and constructed on the bottom of a 2 × 2 monolayer of g-C3N4. Similarly the B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure consists of a B-doped 2 × 2 g-C3N4 supercell and a 4 × 4 SnS2 supercell. The 20 Å vacuum region was set to minimize the interactions between the neighboring periodic units. Previous experimental and theoretical studies38,39 indicated that the bridging C atom coordinating with three N atoms in a C6N7-unit substituted by a B atom was easier (Fig. 1a). The optimized g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are shown in Fig. 1e and g. The calculated minimum distances between g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4 and the SnS2 layer are 3.1 and 3.0 Å, which are close to those of other g-C3N4-based heterostructures.40,41

In terms of the thermodynamic stability and interfacial interaction in g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the interface formation energy (Ef) was evaluated according to the following equations:12 Ef = E(g-C3N4/SnS2) − E(g-C3N4) − E(SnS2)(3) Ef = E(B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2) − E(B-doped g-C3N4) − E(SnS2)(4)where E(g-C3N4/SnS2), E(g-C3N4), E(SnS2), E(B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2), E(B-doped g-C3N4) are the total energies of the g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure, monolayer g-C3N4, SnS2 nanosheet, B-doped g-C3N4 heterostructure, and monolayer B-doped g-C3N4, respectively. The calculated interfacial formation energies for g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are −1.80 eV and −1.62 eV, respectively, so they are easily formed through an exothermic process, indicating that g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are thermodynamically stable.
3.2. Electronic structure
The band structures of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4, SnS2, g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 were calculated by the HSE06 functional and are plotted in Fig. 2, and the band gaps and band edge positions of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2 are collected in Table 1. The computed band gaps of g-C3N4 and SnS2 are 2.81 and 2.60 eV, respectively, which agree well with the experimental values, so they are close to the experimental data.11,21 For B-doped g-C3N4, the electronic states in the spin-down channels are different from those in the spin-up channels as the B atom has an unpaired electron. Compared to g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 with a C atom substituted by a B atom lacks an electron, so it appears as an impurity state in the band structure of the spin-down states (Fig. 2b). The band gaps of the spin-up and spin-down states are 2.45 and 2.55 eV, respectively, which agree well with the experimental value (2.66 eV, Table 1).39 With respect to the values in g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4, the band gaps are decreased to 1.84 and 1.67 eV, respectively, in the g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 composites. In particular, the band gap of B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is lower than that of g-C3N4/SnS2, suggesting an improved forbidden bandwidth in the former.

In order to investigate the interfacial electronic structures of the heterostructures, the PDOS was calculated using the HSE06 hybrid functional and is depicted in Fig. 3 for all systems. In isolated g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4, the VBs are mainly contributed by N atoms, while the CBs are mainly composed of C and N atoms. The VB of SnS2 is contributed by S atoms, whereas the CB is jointly contributed by S and Sn atoms. For both g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the VB is mainly composed of N atoms from g-C3N4, while the CB is composed of S and Sn atoms from SnS2. Moreover, the results show that the energy bands of SnS2 effectively insert into the energy bands of g-C3N4 or B-doped g-C3N4, resulting in the reduced band gaps for g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2.

3.3. Optical properties
To evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the heterostructures, the absorption spectra of g-C3N4, g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 were simulated and are plotted in Fig. 4. For g-C3N4, the strongest absorption peak is near 360 nm, reproducing well the experimental results.11 Compared with g-C3N4, the strong absorption peaks of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are red-shifted by about 30 nm and 70 nm, respectively, indicating that g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 can expand the visible-light response range, and the absorption capacities of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are enhanced compared to that of g-C3N4. In addition, B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 has a maximum overlap with visible light (400–750 nm), predicting that B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 possesses an excellent visible-light absorption capacity and photocatalytic efficiency.

3.4. Work function and charge density difference
The work function of the surface is an important parameter with which to investigate the interface charge transfer. Herein, the work functions of the studied heterostructures were calculated according to the following equation:13 Φ = Evacuum − EF(6)where Evacuum and EF represent the energy of a stationary electron in the vacuum near the surface and the Fermi energy, respectively. In Fig. 5a–c, the work functions of monolayer g-C3N4, monolayer B-doped g-C3N4, and the SnS2 nanosheet were computed to be 5.32, 5.33, and 6.75 eV by the HSE06 functional.
 Fig. 5  The work function of g-C3N4 (a), B-doped g-C3N4 (b), SnS2 (c), g-C3N4/SnS2 (d), and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 (e). The red and blue lines denote the Fermi level, EF, and the vacuum energy level, Evaccum, respectively. 
These results indicate that the Fermi energy of the SnS2 nanosheet is lower than those of the monolayer g-C3N4 and monolayer B-doped g-C3N4. Therefore, when the monolayer g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4 interact with the SnS2 nanosheet to form the heterostructure, the electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4) to SnS2 until they reach the same Fermi level, and the work functions of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are 5.69 eV and 5.76 eV.
The charge density difference (Fig. 6) was further calculated to explore the charge transfer and separation at the g-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4)/SnS2 interfaces. The green and red isosurfaces represent charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. Fig. 6 reveals that the charge densities are redistributed by forming electron- and hole-rich regions within the g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 interfaces. In fact, the charge depletion occurred on the g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4 surfaces, resulting in hole-rich sites. However, strong charge accumulation occurs on the SnS2 surface for forming electron-rich sites. Therefore, the electrons are mainly transferred from g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4 to the SnS2 surface. This proves that a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 interfaces can be formed, and the electric field direction is from the g-C3N4 or B-doped g-C3N4 surface to the SnS2 surface, which can improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.

3.5. Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism in g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2
To explore the charge transfer mechanism of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures, the band edge positions of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2 were calculated using the empirical equations:41 EVB = χ − Ee + 0.5Eg(7) ECB = EVB − Eg(8)where EVB and ECB are the VB and CB potentials, respectively, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (ca. 4.5 eV), χ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor and Eg is the band gap.
The band edge positions of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2 are shown in Fig. 7. The VB potentials of g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2 are 1.74, 1.27 and 2.30 V (vs. NHE), respectively, while the CB potentials are −1.07, −1.18, and −0.30 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The results show that the band edge positions of g-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4) and SnS2 match the conditions of a Z-scheme heterostructure, and g-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4) acts as PS I and SnS2 acts as PS II. Under sunlight irradiation, the electrons absorb energy and then are excited from the VB of g-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4) and SnS2 to their CB; simultaneously, the photoexcited holes are left in the VB. For g-C3N4/SnS2 (Fig. 7a), if the further charge transfer follows the conventional heterostructure mechanism that the electrons accumulate in the CB of g-C3N4 and are excited to the CB of SnS2, the electrons in the CB of SnS2 can reduce CO2. However, the CB potential of SnS2 (−0.30 V) is lower than the CO2/CH3OH potential (−0.39 V, Table 2), so CH3OH will not be a product of CO2RR on g-C3N4/SnS2, which is not consistent with the products from experiments.22 Thus, the conventional heterostructure mechanism is not suitable for the g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure. In Fig. 8a and Table 2, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 can reduce CO2 when the photoinduced electrons in the CB of SnS2 migrate to the VB of the g-C3N4 sheet. Compared to the CO2/CH3OH potential (−0.39 V), the CB potential of the g-C3N4 sheet (−1.07 V) is more negative, so CH3OH can be produced, which is consistent with the experimental result.22 From the interface charge transfer, this proves that g-C3N4/SnS2 is a Z-scheme heterostructure. Under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 7b), the direction of the built-in electric field for B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is from the B-doped g-C3N4 surface to the SnS2 surface, which prevents the photogenerated electrons at the CB of B-doped g-C3N4 moving to the CB of SnS2 and accelerates the photoexcited electron transfer from the CB of SnS2 to the VB of B-doped g-C3N4. Consequently, the photoexcited electrons easily recombine with photoexcited holes at the VB of B-doped g-C3N4. From the method of charge transfer, B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is a Z-scheme heterostructure (Fig. 7b). The CB of B-doped g-C3N4 is 0.11 V above the CB of g-C3N4. Thus, B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is more effective for CO2 reduction than g-C3N4/SnS2 due to its strong reducing ability.

3.6. The CO2RR paths on Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures
According to the situation of charge transfer in g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, we know that CO2RR occurs on g-C3N4 and B-doped g-C3N4, respectively. Yu et al.22 demonstrated that g-C3N4/SnS2 shows superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH and CH4, while HCOOH appeared as an intermediate. Based on experiment, all the possible reaction paths (Scheme 2) were considered and the ΔG of each step was calculated with DMol3 code. The calculated free energy diagrams of CO2 reduction through the above possible reaction paths are summarized in Fig. 8.
 Scheme 2  Proposed reaction paths for CO2 reduction on Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures for producing CH4 and CH3OH.a aThe *symbol shows that the intermediate can be adsorbed on the substrate. 
For CO2RR, the initial step is the formation of a COOH* intermediate. As shown in Fig. 8, the ΔG for CO2 hydrogenation to COOH* on g-C3N4/SnS2 is uphill by 1.10 eV and CO2 → COOH* is the rate-determining step in the whole reaction. Once COOH* is obtained, it can be reduced to CO and HCOOH intermediates through the formation of O–H and C–H bonds, respectively. The ΔG of each step and structures corresponding to the optimal reaction path are shown in Table S1 of ESI† and Fig. S1 of ESI,† respectively. The ΔG for CO and HCOOH formation are −0.52 eV and −0.86 eV, indicating that HCOOH formation is easier than CO formation, so the COOH* → CO step is not considered. Next, the HCOOH absorption is evaluated and the absorption energy (Eads) of HCOOH is −0.27 eV (Table S2, ESI†), suggesting that the HCOOH can desorb from the catalyst or undergo further hydrogenation. According to experiment,22 HCOOH existed as an intermediate. Thus, HCOOH hydrogenation on g-C3N4/SnS2 was considered. The ΔG for HCOOH hydrogenation to HCO* is 0.37 eV. The HCO* hydrogenation proceeds in two possible ways: HCO* → HCHO or HCO* → CHOH*. The ΔG of HCO* → HCHO (−0.20 eV) and HCO* → CHOH* (0.32 eV) are smaller than that of the rate-determining step (1.10 eV), so HCHO and CHOH* can both undergo further hydrogenation. In the next step, the formations of CH* and CH2OH* are exothermic. While, HCHO hydrogenation to CH3O* is not feasible due to the large ΔG (1.52 eV) (Table S1, ESI†). Similarly, the CH2OH* can be hydrogenated to CH3OH and CH2*. The Eads and ΔG of CH3OH formation are −0.27 eV and −0.44 eV, respectively, indicating that the CH3OH can desorb from the catalyst and be one of the products. While, the ΔG of CH2OH* → CH2* (0.24 eV) is smaller than that of the rate-determining step, so it can be further hydrogenated, and the next two steps, CH2* → CH3* → CH4, are exothermic. So CH4 is also one of the products. From Fig. 8, the main product for six-electron CO2 reduction is CH3OH and the main product for eight-electron CO2RR is CH4, which are in good agreement with experiment.22
For B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the ΔG values of all reaction intermediates in Scheme 2 were calculated, and the corresponding free energy plots and structures corresponding to the optimal reaction path are shown in Fig. 9, Table S1 and Fig. S2 of ESI,† respectively. The computational results show that the common first step of CO2 → COOH* is exothermic. The adsorption energy of CO* is −2.17 eV (Table S2, ESI†), indicating that CO prefers to be further reduced due to the strong CO adsorption. COOH* also can be hydrogenated to HCOOH, and the ΔG of COOH* → HCOOH is 0.45 eV, showing that HCOOH formation is more difficult than CO* formation, so HCOOH formation is not considered. The ΔG of CO → HCO* is 0.22 eV, which is similar to that of CO → COH* (0.24 eV); thus HCO* and COH* are possible intermediates. In the fourth step, due to the large ΔG of COH* → C* (1.00 eV) and HCO* → HCHO (0.97 eV) (Table S1, ESI†), COH* → CHOH* and HCO* → CHOH* are exothermic processes, so the formation of CHOH* is easier. The CHOH* is further hydrogenated to CH* or CH2OH*. Next, CH2OH* is hydrogenated, and CH3OH is the main product through the six-electron CO2RR process. The ΔG of the rate-determining step (CHOH* → CH2OH*) for this path is 0.83 eV. Additionally, a lower yield of CH3OH products is proposed due to the large ΔG of the rate-determining step. Once CH* is formed, CH4 can be generated according to the eight-electron CO2RR path. As was shown in Fig. 9, the optimal path is CO2 → COOH* → CO* → HCO* → CHOH* → CH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4. And the ΔG of the rate-determining step (CH2* → CH3*) is 0.40 eV. It should be noted that the free energy is much lower than that of CO2RR on a Cu (111) surface (0.99 eV),43 so the Z-scheme B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure possesses an excellent catalytic activity for CO2RR.

In a comparison of the ΔG of the rate-determining step on g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the CO2RR catalyzed by the latter is more favorable.
3.7. Side reaction analyses
The reduction of CO2 proceeded in aqueous solution and the proton was provided by the solution, so the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)44,45 is of concern as HER affects the photocatalytic efficiency significantly. Therefore, the free energy changes of HER were further investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 10. On g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, DFT calculations suggest that hydrogen atoms prefer to adsorb on the N atom which is 2-fold coordinated with two C atoms in the C6N7-unit. As is shown in Fig. 10, the ΔG of HER on the g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 are −0.98 eV and −1.70 eV, respectively, showing that the HER on the two heterostructures cannot compete with CO2RR, so the influence of the HER side reaction can be ignored.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a new Z-scheme photocatalyst, B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, was designed via first-principles studies. The band gap, PDOS, absorption spectra, work function, and charge density difference of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 were investigated by using DFT calculations. Compared to g-C3N4, B-doped g-C3N4 and SnS2, the band gaps of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures are reduced. The simulated absorption spectra of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures show red-shifted and stronger absorption. The work function and charge density difference of g-C3N4/SnS2 and B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructures indicate that the charge transfer mechanism is a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. Under light illumination, the built-in electric field accelerates the transfer of photoexcited electrons in the CB of SnS2 into the VB of g-C3N4 or B-doped g-C3N4. And the photoexcited electrons and holes gathering in different semiconductor surfaces efficiently prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated carriers and enhance the photocatalytic ability. For Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2, the rate-determining step is CO2 → COOH* with a ΔG of 1.10 eV and the main products are CH3OH and CH4. For B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2, the optimal path is CO2 → COOH* → CO* → HCO* → CHOH* → CH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4. The ΔG of the rate-determining step (CH2* → CH3*) is 0.40 eV. The ΔG of the rate-determining step on Z-scheme B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 is much lower than that of g-C3N4/SnS2, indicating that the Z-scheme B-doped g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure is a highly efficient photocatalyst.
