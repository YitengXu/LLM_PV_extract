    , Accepted 13th December 2012First published on 14th December 2012AbstractA novel composite composed of TiSi2, graphene and RuO2 nanoparticles was fabricated by a one-pot deposition method using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a supporting matrix and RuCl3 as the RuO2 precursor. The resulting RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoelectrical response and electrochemical impedance spectra. The results indicated that the three components in the composite were effectively contacted, thus facilitating the photogenerated charges transfer and separation through multiple routes. By using the composite as a photocatalyst for visible-light water splitting the average hydrogen production rate could reach 97.5 μmol h−1 g−1, which is higher than that from RuO2/TiSi2 and pure TiSi2 systems under the same conditions.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier due to its high energy capacity and environmental friendliness.1 Splitting water to hydrogen and oxygen under irradiation of solar light in the presence of a photocatalyst is the most promising green method for hydrogen generation.2,3 In general, this process is achieved by using a semiconductor to convert solar energy to hydrogen from aqueous solution with or without sacrificial reagents.4–6 However, most of the semiconductors have major drawbacks such as a wide band gap, quick recombination rate, resulting in a low energy conversion efficiency of solar energy.7,8 Many efforts have been made to develop new semiconductors to increase the efficiency of the photosplitting water reaction. One approach is to prepare the semiconductor-based composites to enhance the photocatalytic performance. For example, the loading of a suitable cocatalyst (such as RuO2) can significantly improve the water-splitting rate by providing reaction sites and decreasing the activation energy for gas evolution.9,10
Graphene as a new two-dimensional nanomaterial has attracted a lot of attention. In addition to its outstanding optical, electrical, mechanical and thermal properties,11–13 graphene or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can be functionalized by various species to process novel properties, thus being applied in many fields such as energy storage,14,15 optoelectronic devices16,17 and catalysis.18–21 Semiconductor-functionalized graphene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production have been widely reported.22–30 Graphene can act as an excellent supporting matrix for semiconductors and as the electron acceptor due to its high specific surface area and superior electron mobility, therefore, can effectively suppress the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and promote the photocatalytic activity.20,31 In addition, functionalized graphene by organic sensitizer molecules can promote photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution due to harvesting the light irradiation of the sensitizers.32,33
Titanium disilicide (TiSi2) is an excellent semiconductor material due to its thermodynamic stability, single electron tunneling characteristics,34 and unusual optoelectronic properties. TiSi2 with the bandgap from 1.5 to 3.4 eV, absorbs visible and near-UV range of the solar spectrum. The wide range of absorption suggests that TiSi2 can serve as a basis for the tandem oxidation of water and reduction of protons to form oxygen and hydrogen. Demuth and co-workers have recently reported photocatalytic application of TiSi2 for splitting of water under solar radiation.35 Composite TiO2/TiSi2 has exhibited good photoelectrochemical properties due to the efficient visible light harvesting and good charge separation in the TiO2/TiSi2 system.36,37 However, to the best of our knowledge, the TiSi2 functionalized graphene composite has not been reported in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Since TiSi2 is a semiconductor with broad light absorption and graphene is a valuable substrate with excellent mobility of charge carriers, a TiSi2/graphene composite may combine the unique properties of each component, and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.
In addition, an additional cocatalyst can be used for graphene-based photocatalysis to provide improved photocatalytic activity. For example, Yu’s group has prepared a TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite by a two-step hydrothermal process. This composite exhibited remarkably high H2 production activity due to the synergetic effect between the MoS2 and graphene components in the hybrid cocatalyst.38 Here we report a one-pot approach to synthesize a novel composite photocatalyst based on TiSi2, RGO and RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2/TiSi2/RGO). RuO2 serves as a cocatalyst in the system. Considering that a noble metal such as Pt as a cocatalyst can catalyze the backward reaction of H2 and O2,3 transition metal oxide RuO2 was chosen as a cocatalyst in our case because it does not promote the backward reaction and contributes to the highly efficient overall water splitting.39 Under visible-light irradiation, the RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite demonstrates higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity compared with RuO2/TiSi2 and pure TiSi2. Thus, O2 could be released when reaction suspensions were heated to 100 °C, leading to overall water splitting. The effects of the composition of the composite on the photocatalysis were also systematically investigated.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals including TiSi2 were purchased from the J&K Company and were used without further purification.
2.2 Sample preparation
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from purified natural graphite flakes using a modified Hummers method.40 The RGO suspension was prepared as reported previously.41 The details are described as follows: hydrazine solution (50 μL, 10 wt% in water) was added to 50 mL of GO aqueous colloidal suspension (0.2 mg mL−1), and the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 10 by KOH solution (1 M). The mixture was then stirred at 90 °C for 2 h. The color change of the suspension from yellow-brown to black is clear evidence of the occurrence of reduction. After filtration through glass cotton to remove the precipitate, a stable RGO aqueous suspension is obtained.
RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite was prepared by a one-pot deposition method using RGO as the supporting matrix and RuCl3 as the RuO2 precursor. In detail, an aqueous solution of RuCl3 and RGO was mixed with TiSi2 powder under stirring. Then, 1 M NH4HCO3 aqueous solution was added dropwise into the stirred solution until the pH reached 8.0. The solution was then vigorously stirred at 60 °C for 2 h, resulting in the formation of RuO2 nanoparticles dispersed on TiSi2 and the graphene surface.42 The composition of the composite was adjusted by tuning the weight ratio of RuO2 and RGO from 0 to 2.0 wt%, respectively. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, and the obtained solid was washed with distilled water several times to remove Cl− completely, followed by drying in air at 150 °C for 2 h. Such obtained samples were labeled as RuO2-x/TiSi2/RGO-y, where x and y are the weight percentages of RuO2 and RGO in the sample, respectively. RuO2/TiSi2 composite without RGO and TiSi2/RGO composite without RuO2 were also prepared using the same method.
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a SEM Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Samples were prepared by drop-drying from an aqueous suspension of powder onto Si wafers. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Philips diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as a reference. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken by an AXIS Ultra DLD system (Kratos Analytical Inc.) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The samples for XPS measurements were prepared by compressing dry solid product into flakes (5 × 5 mm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 instrument.
2.4 Photoelectrical response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements
The working electrodes were fabricated as follows. The sample powder was thoroughly mixed with ethanol (100 mg mL−1), and the obtained paste was applied evenly onto a 1 cm2 conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate, resulting in a ca. 4 mm thick film. The photoelectrical behavior was measured on a CHI 660B potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical analyzer by using a three electrode configuration system. All measurements utilized a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and a platinum wire counter electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 7). The working electrode was irradiated with a 150 W xenon lamp during the measurement.
The EIS measurements were carried out using a similar system for the measurement of photoelectrical response except in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The impedance spectra were recorded under a perturbation signal of 5 mV over a frequency range of 1–100 MHz.
2.5 Photocatalytic reaction
The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a 50 mL quartz flask equipped with a flat optical entry window. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg sample was added to 50 mL water. The system was deaerated by bubbling argon into the solution for 30 min before the reaction. The solution was stirred continuously and irradiated by a GY-10 xenon lamp (150 W) at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. Ar was used as a carrier gas. The visible light irradiation was obtained by a 420 nm cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) positioned parallel to the quartz flask. The distance between flask and light was maintained at 20 cm. The gases produced were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (GC102AT) equipped with a TCD detector. For detecting O2 evolution from the heated suspension, the gases evolved were transferred to a pre-vacuumed cell connected to a closed gas-circulating system for detection by gas chromatography.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of the composites
The SEM images of the studied materials are shown in Fig. 1. TiSi2 particles are in the range of 1–4 μm (Fig. 1a) in size and pure RGO demonstrates crumpled sheet-like morphology (Fig. 1b). In RuO2/TiSi2, RuO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 50–100 nm are well-dispersed on the surface of TiSi2 (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows the composite system RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1. RGO is overlaid on the surface of TiSi2 particles and RuO2 nanoparticles are well-dispersed on the RGO/TiSi2 surface. The result indicates that the graphene sheets have very good interaction with TiSi2 and RuO2 particles. This direct physical attachment is beneficial for photoinduced charge transfer and separation due to the excellent mobilitiy of charge carriers at the graphene surface.

The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 2. TiSi2 displays distinct diffraction peaks (2θ) at 39.2, 42.3, 43.2 and 49.8°, corresponding to the (311), (040), (022) and (331) orientations of the orthorhombic structure of TiSi2 (Fig. 2, trace a).43 A few very weak peaks indicate the presence of small amounts of TiSi, Si and Ti. No diffraction peaks representing RuO2 and RGO are observed in the prepared samples (Fig. 2, trace b and c), possibly due to the low content and the high dispersion of RuO2 and RGO. We did not notice any obvious change in diffraction patterns for RuO2/TiSi2/RGO after 25 h reaction as compared to the initial RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite (Fig. 2, trace d), indicating TiSi2 was presented in catalytic state during the reaction process.

XPS spectra provide the information of chemical composition on the surface. All the peaks in the measured high resolution spectra are resolved and assigned as labeled in Fig. 3. Fig. 3A shows the spectra of the C 1s + Ru 3d region for RGO and the RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite. RGO exhibited one main peak located at 284.3 eV corresponding to the CC and two weak peaks at 286.4 and 288.1 eV corresponding to C–O and CO.44 The presence of these two low intensity peaks indicated that the reduction of GO to RGO was not complete. For the RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite, the C 1s peak at 288.1 eV was significantly decreased, indicating RGO has been further reduced during the preparation process of the composite. The results were further verified by FTIR spectra of the GO and RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite as shown in Fig. 3A inset. The band at 1732 cm−1 in GO, which corresponds to CO stretching of COOH groups, almost vanished in the RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite. The result is in accordance with the XPS spectra. Note that a band centered at 1400 cm−1 corresponding to the C–O bond is still observable, thus GO could not be completely reduced to graphene. The electron mobility of RGO can be partly restored by reduction although it is lower than pristine graphene.45 Furthermore, the neighboring TiSi2 and RuO2 particles are within a very short range on the RGO sheet, which allows electrons to transfer from TiSi2 through RGO to RuO2 for hydrogen production. The defects or residual functional groups remaining after reduction on RGO sheets cannot obviously affect such short range electron transfer. RGO as an electron mediator for shuttling electrons between the two composites is also reported in the literature.38,46

In addition, two peaks at 282.0 and 286.2 eV in the XPS spectra of composite corresponding to [Ru4+] 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are higher than the bonding energies of previously reported values (∼281 and ∼285 eV).47 The shifts of [Ru4+] 3d peaks indicate the interaction between RGO and RuO2 species, possibly in the form of C–O–Ru. The integral intensity ratios of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks was approximately 1:2, which shows an obvious deviation from the theoretical value of 3:2 in RuO2.48 This is because the site of C–O species overlap with Ru 3d3/2, leading to the increase of the intensity of the Ru 3d3/2 peak.
The binding energies for Ti and Si in TiSi2 are very close to [0] states.35 However, in Ti high resolution 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3B), the signal is dominated by two peaks at 459.3 and 464.2 eV which correspond to the oxidation states of [Ti4+] 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The Ti 2p signal (weak peak around 454.0 eV) in TiSi2 is very low.49,50 A similar observation is discovered for high resolution Si 2p XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 3C, the peak at 102.7 eV ([Si4+] 2p3/2) is higher than that at 99.6 eV ([Si] 2p3/2 in TiSi2).50 Although it is reasonable to believe that TiSi2 is covered by a very thin oxide layer, in our opinion, the high weight of the oxidative components can be attributed to the interaction of Ti and Si with the RGO component, which may lead to interactions such as C–O–Ti and C–O–Si, as discussed above for Ru.
3.2 Light absorption and photoinduced charge transfer of the composite

Fig. 4 illustrates the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples. TiSi2 demonstrated a strong absorption in the UV-vis range from ca. 300 to 800 nm. The absorption intensity increases in the order of TiSi2, RuO2-1/TiSi2 and RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1. The increased absorption of the RuO2/TiSi2 composite may be attributed to the chemical bonding between TiSi2 and RuO2. The same phenomenon has been observed on RuO2-doped WO3 reported by Maruthamuthu et al.51 Introduction of graphene into RuO2/TiSi2 further enhanced the absorption ability in the visible range, suggesting that graphene could expand the light absorption of the composite. A similar phenomenon has been widely reported in composite systems.52,53

EIS is a powerful technique to determine charge transfer processes at an electrode interface.54,55Fig. 5A shows EIS presented as Nyquist plots of TiSi2, RuO2/TiSi2 and RuO2/TiSi2/RGO electrodes. The semicircles of the electrodes in the plot become increasingly short with the incorporation of RuO2 into TiSi2 and RGO into RuO2/TiSi2, indicating that charge transfer resistance is significantly decreased on the surface.23,55,56 Graphene has excellent conductivity due to its two-dimensional planar structure. Therefore, incorporating graphene into the semiconductor could further increase the electron transport rate and an effective charge separation is subsequently accomplished.57–59Fig. 5B compares the photoresponses of the different work electrodes. Prompt and reproducible current responses during repeating on-off illumination cycles were observed for each electrode. For pure TiSi2, an anodic photocurrent spike was observed at the initial time of irradiation, followed by fast decrease until a constant current was reached. This behavior suggests that charge recombination processes are occurring.28 However, for the other composites, the anodic photocurrent spike was not observed, indicating that the composites have a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes. Notably, all samples generate a low photocurrent density, which may be attributed to the poor adhesion of TiSi2 to the flat ITO surface.60 In our case, the RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite electrode produced a significantly higher current density than the TiSi2, TiSi2/RGO or RuO2/TiSi2 electrode, indicating a good charge separation as well as excellent incident light harvesting of RuO2/TiSi2/RGO. The photogenerated electrons from TiSi2 can be injected into the graphene sheets and/or RuO2 particles and the probability of electron–hole recombination is reduced.38,61–63

The electrolyte was 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 7). The illumination from a 150 W xenon lamp was interrupted every 50 s. 
3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The photocatlytic H2 production activities of the composites were estimated under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) (Fig. 6). RGO or RuO2 alone showed no H2 evolution in our case. The use of TiSi2 alone could form H2. However, the RuO2/TiSi2 and RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composites exhibited higher photocatlytic H2 production activities than TiSi2 alone. The contents of RuO2 and RGO had a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity. For the RuO2/TiSi2 composite, H2 evolution increased when a small amount of RuO2 was deposited on TiSi2. The catalyst activity reached a maximum at around 1 wt% RuO2 loading weight. Further loading of RuO2 on TiSi2 led to a decrease of catalytic efficiency. A small amount of RuO2 nanoparticles deposited on the TiSi2 surface acts as an electron-trap and active sites for H2 evolution,64 leading to remarkable promotion of the photocatalytic activity. Further loading of RuO2 blocks the effective light absorption on TiSi2 and acts as the recombination center for photogenerated charges,65 resulting in lower photocatalytic efficiency. When RGO was introduced into RuO2/TiSi2, a similar relationship between the amount of RGO in the composite and the photocatalytic activity was also observed. The photocatalytic activity increased as the amount of RGO in the composite increased and reached the best efficiency ∼1 wt% RGO loading weight. Additionally, the control experiment with the composite of TiSi2/RGO-1 without RuO2 as the cocatalyst shows lower catalytic activity than RuO2-1/TiSi2 and RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1, but higher than pure TiSi2. The result indicates the excited electrons of TiSi2 can transfer from the conduction band to RGO. Furthermore, the higher photocurrent density of TiSi2/RGO-1 than pure TiSi2 also confirms this conclusion (Fig. 5B). RGO, as an electron acceptor, can effectively suppress the charge recombination, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species for the reduction of H+ on the graphene surface. When the TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite was used as a photocatalyst, a similar phenomenon was also observed and reported in ref. 38. However, too much graphene shields the active sites on the TiSi2 surface, resulting in lower photocatalytic activity.26

Even though the band gap of TiSi2 is suitable for the overall splitting of water, it should be noted that O2 evolution was not detected in our tests. When the reaction suspensions were heated to 100 °C in the dark, O2 can be released upon thermal activation. The finding was in accordance with the literature,35 indicating that the TiSi2-based catalysts have high O2 adsorption capacity in low temperature.
The stability of RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1 photocatalyst was evaluated by performing recycling experiments. For comparison, TiSi2 and RuO2-1/TiSi2 were also tested under the same conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Under 5 h visible light irradiation, RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1 produced ca. 64.2 μmol H2 in the first run, while RuO2-1/TiSi2 produced 45.4 μmol and TiSi2 produced 37.3 μmol. The activities of all catalysts decreased slightly (53.4, 38.4 and 29.0 μmol, respectively) in the second cycle, followed by the good reproducibility of H2 production in the third to the fifth runs. The decrease of catalytic activity in the first and second cycle is mainly due to the surface oxidation of TiSi2.35,66 With the increase of reaction cycle, the catalytic activity drops slowly, indicating the surface of TiSi2 has been passivated by a stable oxide layer that blocks the further harmful oxidation of TiSi2.35 The rates of H2 evolution on RuO2-1/TiSi2/RGO-1, RuO2-1/TiSi2 and TiSi2 were 97.5, 71.9 and 56.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in 25 h, respectively.

The proposed photocatalytic water-splitting mechanism on RuO2/TiSi2/RGO was illustrated in Fig. 8. Under visible-light irradiation, electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TiSi2. Since the quasi Fermi level of electrons at pH 7 of TiSi2 is approximately −0.41 to −0.43 eV,35 and the Fermi energy level of graphene is −4.42 eV,67 the photoexcited electron transfer from TiSi2 to RGO is thermodynamically favorable. The photogenerated electrons on the CB of TiSi2 can likely transfer by different ways with the introduction of graphene and RuO2: some electrons can be injected into the RuO2 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of TiSi2,68 which can act as electron-trap and active sites for H2 evolution;64 some electrons tend to transfer to graphene sheets, resulting in efficient separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The photocatalytic reactions to form H2 can take place not only on the RuO2 nanoparticles deposited on semiconductor catalysts, but also on the graphene sheets and/or on the RuO2 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of graphene, greatly increasing the photocatalytic reaction centers, and improving the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. O2 can be evolved in high temperatures for the oxidation of water by holes in the valence band of TiSi2.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a RuO2/TiSi2/RGO composite as a photocatalyst for water splitting. The composite shows a higher rate of H2 evolution (97.5 μmol h−1 g−1) than that of the composite RuO2/TiSi2 (71.9 μmol h−1 g−1) and pure TiSi2 (56.3 μmol h−1 g−1) under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) when the contents of graphene and RuO2 were both 1 wt%. Incorporation of graphene and RuO2 into TiSi2 diversifies the electron transfer process, increases the H2 evolution active sites and reduces the probability of electron–hole recombination. This work shows that inexpensive, environmentally benign TiSi2–graphene materials have a great potential for clean energy conversion systems.
