Received 4th July 2013, Accepted 8th August 2013First published on 8th August 2013AbstractIn this paper, NaYF4 microcrystals with a variety of morphologies, such as microsphere, hexagonal prism, microtube and octahedron shapes, have been synthesized via a hydrothermal method using sodium poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as a template. The structural and kinetic factors that govern the phase and shape evolution of NaYF4 microcrystals have been systematically studied. And the influence of reaction time, pH values, fluoride sources and reaction temperature on the phase and shape of the as-synthesized NaYF4 was systematically investigated and discussed. It is found that PSS can be employed as a shape modifier, which is responsible for the shape evolution. The possible formation mechanism for the products with various architectures has been presented. The up-conversion (UC) properties of Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped NaYF4 samples were studied. In particular, the luminescence intensity can be markedly enhanced by Li+ doping, the related mechanism has been discussed. Furthermore, a systematic study on the UC emissions of Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped NaYF4 samples with microsphere, hexagonal prism, microtube and octahedron shapes has shown that the optical properties of these phosphors are strongly dependent on their morphologies and sizes. This study would be suggestive for the precisely controlled growth of inorganic crystals, especially for those rare earth fluoride compounds.
1. Introduction
Because the properties of inorganic functional materials highly depend on their shape as well as size and composition, controlling the morphology of materials is an important issue in terms of optimizing their properties and thus can be applied in diverse fields such as display devices, optics, magnetic resonance imaging, bioprobes, catalysis, drug delivery, cell imaging, and sensing.1–6 So many efforts have been devoted to explore excellent synthetic approaches for the fabrication of a variety of inorganic crystals with different morphologies to enhance their performance in existing applications.7,8 However, manipulating the shape of materials is not a straightforward task due to the difficulties involved in controlling the nucleation and complex phenomena of crystal growth during the reaction process. In particular, hollow structured materials, which have low densities and high surface area have attracted much attention. Many methodologies have been developed for the fabrication of micro- and nano-structures with hollow interiors, varying sizes and shapes, most of which are synthesized in the presence of hard templates or involving complex steps and high temperature. For instance, Zhai et al. created a template method for the formation of porous CaWO4:Tb3+ nanocapsules using Fe3O4 as the hard template. In addition, the method involved an etching process and a calcination procedure at high temperature. Li et al. prepared NaYF4 nanocrystals with predictable size, shape and phase using a water–alcohol–oleic acid system.9 These processes have been regarded as novel methods for the fabrication of structures with various morphologies. However, their disadvantages including the addition of organic solvents and templates in the reaction system may result in impurity of the final products. Moreover, considering the necessity of green chemistry, tedious synthetic procedures and environmental pollution caused by the removal of templates using corrosive acid or base greatly hinder their applications. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to establish a suitable reaction system for preparing the high quality inorganic products with controlled-size/shape and manipulat the process using a green, facile, and economic strategy.10,11 Typically, hydrothermal treatment has been proved to be effective and convenient in preparing various inorganic materials with diverse controllable morphologies and architectures owing to the availability of flexible adjustment of the experimental parameters.12–17 We will demonstrate the controlled growth of NaYF4 crystals with controllable phase and shape by a hydrothermal route. And water-soluble polymers (PSS) containing functional sulfonate groups were chosen as structure-directing agents to tune the morphologies and luminescence properties of NaYF4. PSS is used as the “shape modifier” in the process. Especially, an organic additive (PSS) can be employed, together with the cooperative effects of solution parameters such as the pH value, reaction time and temperature to regulate the nucleation, growth, and assembly of the products. It has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for the preparation of NaYF4 crystals due to its superior advantages including mild reaction conditions, simple procedures (one-pot synthesis), and easy removal of the additive by washing at low temperature.
Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the research on rare earth ions doped infrared-to-visible frequency up-conversion (UC) luminescent materials due to their potential applications in compact lasers, luminescence display panels, solar energy conversion and other functional areas based on the electronic, optical, and chemical characteristics arising from the 4f electrons.18–24 The UC phosphors are usually stable, nonfading, and not significantly influenced by their environment.25,26 Among all kinds of host materials for UC particles including oxides, fluorides, oxyfluorides, phosphates, and vanadates,27–35 NaYF4 has been reported as the most efficient host matrix for blue and green UC luminescent material.36–39 NaYF4 has two phases: cubic (α) and hexagonal (β), and the β-phase NaYF4 exhibits superior efficiency and is more thermodynamically stable than the α-phase one.40,41 β-NaYF4 host lattices possess low vibrational energy, long lifetime of the excited states, and a high radiative emission rate, which allow for creating the highest UC luminescence at room temperature.42,43 Like other UC luminescent materials, β-NaYF4 microcrystals with controllable morphologies should have potential applications in light emitting devices,44 lasers,45 and three-dimensional displays,46 and the morphology, dimensionality, and the size and dimension of materials are well known to have a great effect on their physical and chemical properties.47 Besides, shape control of the products is of special significance in understanding the growth behavior and great efforts have been devoted to obtain NaYF4 luminescence materials. Haase et al. synthesized lanthanide doped α-NaYF4 spherical crystals with highly efficient multicolor up-conversion emission.48 Li et al. reported the synthesis of NaYF4 with diverse shapes using EDTA and sodium citrate as templates.42 Hence, it is necessary to explore feasible and easily controllable synthetic approaches to obtain β-NaYF4 and control the phases and morphologies of NaYF4 to optimize the luminescence properties. Moreover, it has also been shown that the incorporation of lithium ions into UC luminescent materials plays a significant role in the enhancement of the emission intensity.49–51 The doped Li+ ions with small ionic diameter can be easily inserted into the NaYF4 lattice to locate the nearby rare-earth (RE) ions. They cannot destroy the local structure around the RE ions, but only modify the local symmetry around the RE ions to make them more suitable for PL.
In this study, via a facile and effective hydrothermal route in pure water medium, we will report on the controlled synthesis of monodisperse NaYF4 microcrystals, with different crystal phases and diverse shapes including microsphere, hexagonal prism, and octahedron shapes. The effects of the PSS amount, the pH value of the initial solution, reaction time and reaction temperature on the crystal phases, structure and morphology have been investigated in detail. The as-synthesized doped NaYF4 microsphere, hexagonal prism, and octahedron shapes display intensive emissions under 980 nm NIR excitations. In particular, the differently sized NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ crystals show interesting UC photoluminescence properties. Moreover, because of their various sizes, phases and morphologies, the intensities of the emissions are different from each other. Furthermore, doping Li+ ions can enhance the UC luminescence intensities of the samples.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reagents and materials
All materials including Y(NO3)3·6H2O, Yb(NO3)3·6H2O, Ho(NO3)3·6H2O, Er(NO3)3·6H2O, Tm(NO3)3·6H2O, NaCl, NH4F, NaF, NaBF4, HCl, LiNO3, and sodium poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) with average molecular weights of 70000 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis
In a typical procedure, 2 mL of Y(NO3)3·6H2O (0.5 M) aqueous solution was added to an aqueous solution of PSS (20 mL, 18 g L−1) and stirred for 10 min. After that, 5 mL of NaCl (0.2 mol L−1) and 10 mL of NH4F (1.2 mol L−1) aqueous solutions were added to the mixture. After additional agitation for 5 min, the resultant solution was transferred to a 50 mL autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. Finally, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol several times. The final product was dried at 60 °C in air overnight. NaYF4 architectures with different morphologies were prepared by a similar process as described above only by changing the pH values, reaction time and the amount of concentration of PSS from 0 g L−1 to 18 g L−1, respectively. NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = 16%Yb3+/1%Ho3+, 16%Yb3+/1%Er3+, and 16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+) and Li+ doped NaYF4:Ln3+ samples were prepared in a similar procedure by adding corresponding Yb(NO3)3, Ho(NO3)3, Er(NO3)3, Tm(NO3)3 and LiNO3 into the precursor mixture.
2.3. Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were inspected using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6480A, Japan Electronics). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs were performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was examined using a Rigaku D/max-TTR-III diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). UC emission spectra were obtained using a 980 nm LD Module (K98D08M-30W, China) as the excitation source and detected using R955 (HAMAMATSU) from 400–900 nm. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology, structure, phase, and textural properties
The typical SEM and TEM images for the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ sample are shown in Fig. 1. The low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1A) of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ hexagonal microtubes reveals that the sample almost entirely consists of microtubes that have cracked ends and with an average size of 3.5 μm in diameter and 10–20 μm in length. The close-up view of one isolated microtube (Fig. 1B) displays the inside hollow characteristics and hexagonal prism morphology. The TEM image will give a better understanding of the morphology and properties of the microtubes. Further close investigation of the TEM image (Fig. 1C) reveals that microtubes have perfectly smooth surfaces. However, the hollow structure of the microtube is not obvious in the TEM image, which may be due to the thick wall of the tube that the electron beam cannot penetrate. In Fig. 1D, EDS shows a characteristic intensity profile of Na, Y, F, and Yb elements. In addition, in Fig. 1E, the measured lattice spacing of about 0.515 nm is well consistent with the d100 spacing of the hexagonal NaYF4 phase (JCPDS No. 16-0334) in the P63/m space group, and the preferential growth direction is determined to be [001]. This is also supported by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 1F), which shows diffraction spots of the {001} planes of NaYF4 and reveals the single crystalline nature of the sample. Moreover, the morphology sketch in Fig. 1G shows the determined growth direction. Based on the high anisotropic structure of β-NaYF4, the growth direction is confined to the [001] direction and it preferentially grows along the longitudinal c axis into the hexagonal microtube. The crystal structure of hexagonal phase NaYF4 consists of an ordered array of F− ions with two types of relatively low-symmetry cation sites selectively occupied by Na+ and Y3+ ions (Fig. 1H), resulting in significant electron cloud distortion of the cations to accommodate the structural change, which is important for the doping of rare earth ions.52 However, because the ion radii of the doped Yb3+ (0.0868 nm) and Tm3+ (0.088 nm) are much similar to that of Y3+ (0.09 nm), the doped ions can perfectly substitute the Y3+ sites in the host, which cannot destroy the local structure or change the morphology of the final products. And the growth process of the crystal has also not been affected, this has been confirmed by the SEM images of NaYF4 and NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

3.2. Factors influencing on the formation process and the proposed mechanism
Influence of reaction time. 
To understand the growth mechanism of the hexagonal NaYF4 architecture, systematic time-dependent experiments were carried out. Because the crystal structure of NaYF4 exhibits two polymorphic forms: cubic (α) and hexagonal (β), the phase transformation process was first investigated by controlling the reaction time at the same hydrothermal temperature (180 °C). Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ samples prepared at different reaction times. It reveals that the samples display distinctively different XRD patterns at different reaction times. As shown, for the sample achieved at 180 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2A), only cubic α-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 06-0342) can be obtained. When the reaction time is increased to 3 h (Fig. 2B), a new β-NaYF4 phase emerges in addition to the α-NaYF4 phase, indicating that the sample transforms partially from the α to the β phase with reaction time prolongation. By increasing the reaction time to 6 h (Fig. 2C), the diffraction peaks of the hexagonal phase dominate on a large scale. With further reaction time, from 6 h to 9 h (Fig. 2D), the fraction of the β phase increases remarkably. A pure β-NaYF4 phase can be successfully obtained when the reaction time is further increased to 12 h (Fig. 2E), the α phase disappears completely and only the β phase exists. All the reflections can be directly indexed to the pure hexagonal β-NaYF4. It is concluded that longer reaction time is favorable for the transformation from the cubic to the hexagonal phase in the solution-based procedure.

The time-dependent SEM images (Fig. 3) demonstrate the morphology evolution with the increase in reaction time. SEM images of the different intermediate samples at different reaction stages at 180 °C clearly reveal the growth process of a hexagonal microrod structure, as shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the five samples with different phases present much different morphologies indicating that not only the phases of the samples experience an α → β transformation process, but also the shapes change accordingly during the reaction. The hydrothermal treatment for 30 min leads to the formation of spherical particles with a mean diameter of 200 nm (Fig. 3A). According to the XRD results above, the product is composed of α-NaYF4, which is unstable and is susceptible to slow phase transformation. A dissolution–renucleation process for nanospheres takes place, and the more stable phase is formed. With further reaction, α-NaYF4 particles would convert to β-NaYF4 gradually. As the reaction time is increased to 3 h, some prismatic microrods with a size of 2 μm in length and 0.3 μm in width are obtained (Fig. 3B), which shows the mixture of predominantly the α-phase and the minor β-phase. When the reaction time is prolonged to 6 h, a large amount of spherical particles is attached on the surfaces of microrods and the size of the particles increased on a large scale (Fig. 3C). Further prolonging the reaction time to 9 h, the microstructures have grown larger in all directions and the morphology uniformity is improved (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the top/bottom facets and six prismatic planes are very smooth. As the reaction proceeds to 12 h, the as-obtained product consists of microtubes and small nanocrystals disappear completely.

In our case, it has been demonstrated that spherical particles with a similar size (200 nm) are actually formed at the initial stage during the process. However, the aggregation seems to play an important role in the formation of hexagonal NaYF4 microtubes. The growth of the microtube seems to occur by the aggregation of the spherical particles and the morphology of the transformation process extends in three dimensions, based on the crystallographic nature of hexagonal NaYF4. With further growth of the microrod, the particles become progressively depleted to produce bigger structures without significant alteration of the particle morphology. It is because larger particles with smaller surface to volume ratios are favored over the energetically less stable smaller particles, the growth of larger particles is achieved. With further growth, the re-crystallization takes place at the exterior surface of the crystals, as a result, the crystallite increases in size slightly without significant alteration of the particle morphology and the hollow structure is observed from the ends of the tubes. During the process, the aggregation in the system reorients themselves, probably with the help of the polymer molecules (PSS), lowering the system energy to form the hollow hexagonal morphology of NaYF4. Similar phenomena have been observed for the formation of other hollow structures and can be understood by the well-known Ostwald-ripening mechanism.53
Influence of pH values. 
The variation of pH obviously influences the morphology of the as-obtained β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ precipitates. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the products obtained under the same conditions but at various pH values. As seen from the SEM images, β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ materials with various morphologies can be obtained by simply adjusting the pH values of the initial solution. At pH = 1.5, the obtained NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ crystals exhibit octahedral-shaped morphology and a smooth surface (Fig. 4A). When the pH is further increased to 3, the morphology of the corresponding product is basically maintained, but the octahedral shape is more clear whereas the size distribution is not very uniform (Fig. 4B). Octahedron and small particles attached on them were obtained by increasing the pH from 3 to 3.5 (Fig. 4C). By increasing the pH from 3 to 3.5, morphology of the products varies greatly. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4C that there are a large quantity of uniform spheres with diameters of about 170 nm and microrods which are 0.5 μm in diameter and 1.5–4 μm in lengths over the entire surface of the substrates (Fig. 4D). Careful observation reveals that these microrods are composed of solid interiors with small spheres attached on them. The increase in pH from 4.5 to 5 could result in the formation of microtubes and irregular aggregates on the surface of the product (Fig. 4E). Hydrothermal treatment of an initial solution with pH 6 also results in the formation of well defined microtubes on a large scale (Fig. 4F). However, compared with samples in Fig. 4E, the hexagonal microtubes have no obvious change in morphology but have extremely smooth surfaces without obvious defects and small particles attached on them. Moreover, the length and diameter of the particles increase remarkably.

Influence of PSS concentrations. 
The formation mechanism of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ structures should depend on a series of chemical and structural transformations. During the process, PSS plays a critical role in controlling the morphology of the final products. PSS not only alters the crystal phases of the products but also influences greatly their morphologies. To investigate the effect of PSS concentration on shape evolution, a series of experiments were carried out using different PSS concentrations, while other parameters are kept identical. Fig. 5 gives the SEM images of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ particles at different PSS concentrations. When no PSS was added, only irregular shaped and aggregated particles with a size ranging from 50 nm to 450 nm are produced (Fig. 5A). The related XRD pattern (Fig. 6A) exhibits β-NaYF4 and α-NaYF4 phases as well as some impure phase. An increase in the amount of PSS (1 g L−1) engulfs the small nucleating centers and promotes crystal growth at the (100) facets, thus preventing the formation of amorphous particles. Predominant crystal growth at the {100} planes is in fact responsible for the appearance of columnar geometries in Fig. 5B. The outline of the prisms is clearly seen in the inset in Fig. 5B. The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 6B) shows that the obtained product consists of β-NaYF4 and α-NaYF4 crystals as well as a little impure phase. However, the intense diffraction peaks indicate the promoted crystallinity. This indicates that a small amount of PSS additive already affects the morphology and phase structure of NaYF4. When PSS concentration in the mixed solution is 3.5 g L−1, most of the irregular shaped and aggregated particles disappear and a large amount of prism aggregates are produced (Fig. 5C). The XRD data (Fig. 6C) clearly show that the product is composed of two phases β-NaYF4 and α-NaYF4, and β-NaYF4 becomes the main phase. Further investigation reveals that, with increasing PSS concentration, the amount of α-NaYF4 and the impure phase decrease steadily, meanwhile the amount of β-NaYF4 increased steadily. At PSS = 5 g L−1, the obtained NaYF4 sample exhibits hexagonal prism morphologies and smooth surfaces (Fig. 5D), which are the typical characteristics of hexagonal NaYF4 crystals. Close observation of the inset in Fig. 5D reveals that the prisms have clear edges and smooth surfaces with a solid interior. The corresponding XRD results (Fig. 6D) show that the crystal has a completely pure β phase. It thus can be inferred from the above results that higher PSS concentration will inhibit the formation of a thermodynamically unstable phase or an impure phase, meanwhile promoting the formation of β-NaYF4. Upon increasing the PSS concentration to 9 g L−1, the obtained NaYF4 crystals exhibit tube-shaped morphology and a magnified SEM image (inset in Fig. 5E) indicates that the tubes have open ends. The XRD pattern in Fig. 6E shows that the product preserves the β phase and has no obvious change with the XRD pattern of the products synthesized at PSS = 7 g L−1. Further increasing the PSS concentration to 18 g L−1 will result in the formation of the well-defined microtubes (Fig. 5F). The inset of Fig. 5F is a magnified SEM image recorded from the tip of the tubes. It clearly indicates that products are composed of large-scale and regular hexagonal microprisms with a uniform average size of 3.5 μm in diameter and 10–20 μm in length. More careful examination of the magnified SEM image (inset in Fig. 5F) shows clearly that the top/bottom of the prisms has cracked ends and hollow interiors.

The above results powerfully demonstrate that the change in PSS concentrations plays a crucial role in determining the phases and morphologies of the products. In low PSS concentration (2–7 g L−1), PSS acts as a “shape modifier” in the process. When the concentration is increased to 10 g L−1 and beyond, PSS demonstrates a soft template effect: as a water soluble anionic polyelectrolyte, it can produce sulfonic groups with a strong ability to interact with electropositive active sites (Y3+, Yb3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+) in the aqueous solution. Then PSS forms large complex micelles in solution, the negatively charged surfaces strongly induce the nucleation process. The excessive positive charge existing on the PSS/Ln3+ (Ln = Y3+, Yb3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+) complex will lead to the immediate reaction when NaCl and NH4F are introduced. Therefore, PSS demonstrates a soft template effect. Notably, a sufficient amount of PSS is necessary to control the crystal growth process and achieve the final microtubes.
Influence of F− sources. 
Besides the factors mentioned above, F− sources also play an important role in controlling the morphology of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ particles. Besides NH4F, we also used NaF and NaBF4 as the fluorine ion sources to carry out contrastive experiments. The SEM images of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ using NH4F, NaF and NaBF4 as the fluorine ion sources are shown in Fig. 7. Different from the microtubes using NH4F as a fluorine source (Fig. 7A and B), large scale hexagonal prisms with closed ends about 2 μm in length are obtained (Fig. 7C and D) when NaF is used as the F− source. However, the shape of the as-obtained product using NaBF4 as the fluorine ion source is an irregular spongy structure. In contrast, when NaBF4 acted as a fluorine ion source, NaBF4 is slowly hydrolyzed to produce BO33− and F− anions.54 Due to the very low F− concentration and the strong interaction between PSS chains and active sites, the particle growth of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ was very slow. As a result, a spongy structure was formed. Therefore, the above results powerfully demonstrate that the use of different F− sources have a tremendous effect on the morphologies of the products. Moreover, the formation of crystals with different shapes is driven kinetically, which is highly dependent on the environment, especially on temperature. In our experiment, as the formation temperature increased from 120 °C to 160 °C and 180 °C the reaction intensity becomes stronger gradually. The higher temperature may induce a higher formation rate of the nucleation and a higher crystal growth rate, which leads to the final product with larger dimension. However, when the reaction temperature was increased to 200 °C, the morphology of the final sample remains unchanged, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

On the basis of the above analysis, it can be inferred that, besides inherent unit cell structures of nucleated seeds, reaction time, pH values, F− sources, the concentrations of the organic additive in the initial solution and reaction temperature are important factors for the phase and morphology evolution of the different products.

3.3. Luminescence properties
NaYF4 is regarded as an efficient host lattice for the luminescence of various optically active lanthanide ions due to the lower phonon energies. Here, we investigate the PL properties of the as-formed NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+) microtubes. The UC emission spectrum of 16%Yb3+/1%Ho3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 (Fig. 8A) exhibits two characteristic Ho3+ transition bands centered at 547 nm (5S2 → 5I8) and 655 nm (5F5 → 5I8).55 The total luminescence appears as a green colour due to a strong green emission from 5S2 → 5I8 transitions. Fig. 8B shows the UC luminescence spectrum of the 16%Yb3+/1%Er3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 microcrystals under a 980 nm NIR laser excitation, which is similar to other Yb3+/Er3+ activated β-NaYF4 crystals and bulks reported previously.56,57 The emission bands centered at 409, 521, 539, and 654 nm can be assigned to the respective 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition, and the green emission at 521 nm is the most prominent one.58–63 In Fig. 8C, the three emission bands of the NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ crystals centered at 450, 476, and 646 nm correspond, respectively, to the 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3H6, and 1G4 → 3F4 transitions of Tm3+, with blue emission at 476 nm as the most prominent one.64–67 The CIE coordinates for the emission spectra of NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Ho3+ NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Er3+, NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ were determined as x = 0.2262, y = 0.699; x = 0.1809, y = 0.756; x = 0.1301, y = 0.0878, respectively. The pump power dependence of the blue, green, and red up-converted emissions in β-NaYF4:16%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+, β-NaYF4:16%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ and β-NaYF4:16%Yb3+, 1%Tm3+ crystals under 980 nm LD excitation is exhibited in Fig. 8D. The number of photons necessary to populate the upper emitting state is obtained from the relation of If ∝ Pn, where If is the fluorescent intensity, P is the pump laser power, and n is the number of photons required to produce the emission (at the lower pump intensity). As shown in Fig. 8D, the slopes of the linear fits of ln(IUC) versus ln(IIR) for the green and red emissions in β-NaYF4:16%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ samples are 1.96 and 1.90, respectively. The results indicate that only a two-photon process is involved to produce the green and red UC emissions, which is consistent with the previous reports of the Yb3+/Ho3+ doped crystals. And, we can see that the blue and red emissions in β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ need three- and two-photon processes, while the green and red emissions in β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ all needs a two-photon energy transfer process, and a three-photon process is needed for the blue UC emission. Based on above results, the proposed UC mechanism in the Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ doped NaYF4 is presented in Fig. 8E. As shown, the green emission of Ho3+ at the 5I6 state is involved in two possible processes as follows: 5I6 + a photon (980 nm) → 5S2, 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 5I6 (Ho3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 5S2 (Ho3+). The 5S2 state of Ho3+ is populated and then the 5S2 state relaxes to the ground state of Ho3+ at 5I8. As a result, the green emission at 547 nm is produced. For the red emission of Ho3+, the 5I6 state can be exited through the energy transfer from the 5I8 state to the 5I6 state. The relaxation of photons from the 5I6 state to the 5I7 state induces a non-radiative process. After that, the process: 5F5/2 (Yb3+) + 5I7 (Ho3+) → 5F7/2 (Yb3+) + 5F5 (Ho3+) populated the 5F5 state. Finally, a radiative process through relaxation from the 5F5 state to the ground state of 5I8 generates the red emission at 655 nm. As shown in Fig. 8E, an initial energy transfer from an Yb3+ ion in the 2F5/2 state to an Er3+ ion populates the 4I11/2 level of Er3+. A second 980 nm photon transferred by the excited Yb3+ ions can populate a higher 4F7/2 energetic state of the Er3+ ions. The subsequent multiphonon relaxation populates the emitting 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states, and the dominant green 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emissions occur. Alternatively, the electron can further relax and populate the 4F9/2 level resulting in the occurrence of red 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission. For blue emission of Tm3+, non-resonant energy transfer occurs from the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ to the 3H5 level of Tm3+ and/or the ground state absorption (GSA) process can be assigned to 3H6 → 3H5 transition. A subsequent 3H5 → 3F4 transition can be induced by non-radiative relaxation. And then, through the excited state absorption (ESA) or energy transfer UC (ETU), the 3F2 state can be excited from the 3F4 state, which can generate the 3H4 state from a non-radiative transition that plays an important role in the generation of blue emission at 475 nm. In addition, the 3H4 state can be populated by cross relaxation (CR) of 1G4 + 3F4 → 3H4 + 3F2 transition. The 3H4 state further excited to the 1G4 state through the ESA or ETU. Finally, the 1G4 → 3H6 transition generates the blue emission centered at 475 nm.

Several factors could influence the intensity of the UC emissions, such as doping levels, morphology, phase and so on. Here, we select Yb3+/Tm3+ as the codoped ions to investigate the UC luminescent properties of the NaYF4 products with various morphologies and phases. Fig. 9A presents the room-temperature UC emission spectra of the resulting NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ crystals obtained after 0.5–12 h reaction time. It can be seen that, in all five samples, the emission spectra are similar in shape, and the bands differ only in their intensities. The results in Fig. 9A indicate that the Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped β-NaYF4 microcrystals obtained after 12 h hydrothermal treatment have the highest emission intensity. Under 980 nm IR laser excitation, the strong blue luminescence can be observed in the sample. However, the spherical particles and the prismatic microrod show the lowest intensity (T = 0.5, 3 h), and the relative intensity of the microcrystals obtained after 12 h is almost 90 times as high as that of the products under 0.5 h and 3 h. We ascribe the difference in luminescence relative intensities to the different phases of the samples. The up-conversion emissions of the NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ particles are greatly enhanced after hydrothermal treatment. As mentioned above, longer reaction time is favorable for the transformation from cubic to hexagonal NaYF4 in the solution-based procedure, the amount of hexagonal phase increases with an increase in the hydrothermal treatment time. The β-NaYF4 has been reported as the most efficient host material for green and blue UC luminescence. During the hydrothermal treatment, cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition of the host occurred, thus the fluorescent intensity of the NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ particles is greatly enhanced.

Fig. 9B presents the room-temperature UC emission spectra of the resulting NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ phosphors obtained at different PSS concentrations. Note that the six samples with different morphologies and phases show much different UC emission intensity. As shown in Fig. 9B, the intensity of fluorescence emitted by NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ increases along with an increase in the PSS concentrations. Similar to the above discussion, the main possible reason could be that the products have relatively different phases. The PSS additive can influence the morphology and phase structure of NaYF4. During the reaction, the PSS binding on the particle surface sufficiently limits particle growth and stabilizes the particles. After the hydrothermal treatment, cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition of the host occurred with an increase in PSS concentration, the amount of α-NaYF4 and the impure phase decrease and the amount of β-NaYF4 increases, thus the fluorescent intensity of the NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ particles is greatly enhanced. It can be concluded from the above results that higher PSS concentration would inhibit the formation of thermodynamically unstable phases or impure phases, meanwhile promoting the formation of β-NaYF4, which is an efficient host material for blue UC.
Fig. 9C shows the UC emission spectra of the NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ samples obtained at different pH values. As shown in Fig. 9C, the intensity of fluorescence emitted by NaYF4:16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ particles increases along with an increase in the pH values. However, the microtubes show stronger UC fluorescence emission compared to octahedron and microrods. The main possible reason could be that the hexagonal microtubes have a relatively larger size and smaller surface area and thus less surface defects, which are usually fluorescence quenchers.
Under identical measurement conditions, the room-temperature UC emission spectra of the samples prepared with different F− sources are presented in Fig. 9D, respectively. The relative intensities of the three samples are different, namely, the hexagonal microtubes (NH4F as F− sources) have the highest relative emission intensity, while the irregular spongy structures (NaBF4 as F− sources) show the lowest intensity, and the relative intensity of the former is almost 23 times as high as that of the latter. We ascribe the difference in luminescence relative intensities to the different morphologies and sizes of the three samples. Although different fluoride sources are used, the three samples are all treated hydrothermally at 180 °C for 12 h. And, PSS concentrations as well as the pH values were fixed the same. After the hydrothermal treatment, all the precipitates have been washed with deionized water and ethanol in sequence by a centrifugation redispersion process. The crystal phase of the three products is the same hexagonal β-NaYF4. On the basis of the above analyses, it is reasonable to believe that the different luminescence properties of the products arise from their morphologies and sizes.
In an effort to enhance the intensity of the UC emission, the NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = 16%Yb3+/1%Ho3+, 16%Yb3+/1%Er3+, and 16%Yb3+/1%Tm3+) were doped with the lithium ion (Li+). To optimize the effect of Li+-doping in order to obtain maximum UC emission, a series of Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+-doped NaYF4 samples doped with different Li+ concentrations (0 mol%, 5 mol%, 15 mol%, 25 mol%, 45 mol%) were prepared under identical experimental conditions, which are shown in Fig. 10A–C. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the shapes of emissions of the samples are not significantly influenced by the doping of Li+ ions. It was observed that the Li+ doped NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+) crystals show a higher UC intensity than the NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+) samples, respectively. All the emission peaks are enhanced and the PL intensity initially increases with Li+ concentration, and reach the maximum at 25 mol% Li+. When the lithium ions were doped, the Li+ ion may diffuse to the interstitial site in the NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+) lattice. So, the local symmetry around Ho3+, Er3+, and Tm3+ is slightly adjusted, which is expected to favor the anti-Stokes luminescence. In addition to the modification of the local crystal field, the Li+ also affects ET and relaxation processes. As a result, the UC luminescence was enhanced by Li+ co-doping.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, NaYF4 nanocrystals with predictable size, shape and phase can be prepared using a hydrothermal route. The phase, morphology, and size of the NaYF4 microstructures can be rationally tuned in a controllable manner by altering the reaction time, PSS concentrations, pH values of the initial solutions, F− sources and reaction temperature. Especially, PSS could serve as an effective shape modifier for the morphological control of NaYF4 samples. Moreover, the influences of fluoride sources and pH values on the shapes of NaYF4 microstructures have been investigated in detail. A variety of external factors account for the ultimate shape evolutions of the products and the possible formation mechanisms for products with various crystal phases and architectures have been presented in detail. In addition, the photoluminescence properties of NaYF4:Ln3+ (Lnz3+ = Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Tm3+) samples have been thoroughly studied. The experimental results indicate that the optical properties of the NaYF4 phosphors with different architectures are strongly dependent on their phase, morphologies and sizes. As a result of their unique luminescence properties and controlled morphology and size, these phosphors may find potential applications in the fields of displays, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and solid-state lasers. Particularly, this method might well be extendable to the synthesis of other inorganic materials.
