    , Accepted 17th May 2013First published on 17th May 2013AbstractA strongly coupled mesoporous SnO2–graphene hybrid has been prepared via direct nucleation, growth, and anchoring of a SnO2 nanocrystal on graphene substrate under microwave irradiation followed by heat-treatment. Investigations reveal that the well-dispersed SnO2 nanocrystals with a uniform particle size of 3–5 nm are homogeneously distributed on the surface of graphene through strong chemical attachment and electrical interaction. The formed structure exhibits a high specific surface area (280.7 m2 g−1) and an ideal synergistic effect, which can provide improved activity and durability for the electrochemical and photocatalytic reaction. Lithium-ion battery performance and photocatalytic activity of the resultant mesoporous SnO2–graphene hybrid are thoroughly investigated. In comparison to bare SnO2 nanoparticles, the hybrid shows substantial enhancement in electrochemical lithium storage properties and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. More strikingly, the as-synthesized SnO2–graphene hybrid anode could deliver initial discharge and charge capacities of 2445.7 and 1329.4 mAh g−1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (54.4%), as well as an excellent cycling stability.
I. Introduction
The growing concerns about energy and environmental problems have stimulated intense research on state-of-the-art photoconversion and electrical energy storage technologies. As an important wide band gap n-type semiconductor, SnO2 has received considerable attention over the past few decades in the mentioned technological applications, such as lithium-ion battery anode, photocatalyst, sensors, and solar cells.1–4 However, its practical application has been constrained by its extraordinary electrochemical behaviours such as low electron transfer velocity, which results in poor rate capability and rapid capacity fading upon prolonged cycling when used as anode for lithium-ion batteries,5,6 as well as a high charge carrier recombination rate that causes the loss in the efficiency of the photocatalytic system.7 Several approaches have been proposed to increase the electrochemical performance and photocatalytic activity of the SnO2 semiconductor. A promising strategy is to develop SnO2 nanomaterials with small size, large surface area and well-developed porous structures.8 For application as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, SnO2 nanomaterials can shorten the ionic and electronic diffusion length, provide more electrochemical active sites for lithium storage, facilitate electrolyte diffusion, as well as alleviate volume changes and mechanical stress during cycling.9 The preparation of SnO2-based hybrids through loading of noble metals or combination with other semiconductors and a conductive matrix is also an efficient means to enhance the electrochemical performance and photocatalytic activity.10,11 Wang et al. prepared antimony-doped SnO2 nanopowders and showed that the charge carrier concentration of SnO2 and thus the conductivity is further increased by extrinsic dopants.12 Niu et al. synthesized a SnO2/Fe2O3 composite photocatalyst, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic abilities mainly owing to the effective electron-hole separation at the SnO2/Fe2O3 interfaces.13 The SnO2 hybrid coupled with a conductive matrix, such as conductive polymer films and carbonaceous materials, also has received great attention; particularly the hybridization of carbonaceous materials can offer a powerful way to obtain many superior properties for application in the field of photocatalyst and energy storage devices.
The superior electronic conductivity, and high surface area, as well as the flexible porous structure of graphene would make it an excellent electron-transport matrix in electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions. Recently, many reports have concentrated on the study of the electrochemical properties of SnO2–graphene composites,14–23 which exhibit an enhanced lithium storage capacity with good cycle stability and high rate capability due to the fact that the conductive graphene phase can also act as a volume buffer to accommodate the volume changes and improve the structural stability of the electrode, increase the electronic conductivity, and ensure better electrochemical properties. It has been also reported that graphene can be used as an electron transfer channel for reducing the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and leading to improved photoconversion efficiency of the graphene-containing photocatalytic systems based on a semiconductor photocatalyst, such as TiO2 and ZnO.24,25 The composites of graphene and metal oxides have been synthesized by many chemical procedures, such as in situ growth and self-assembly method. However, the current methods usually provide limited interactions, leaving a significant portion of the material electrochemically inactive or failing to achieve the optimized activities due to the excessive oxidation of graphene or the absence of strong oxide–carbon coupling.26 Therefore it is still a challenge to explore an efficient strategy to strongly attach metal oxide nanocrystals with a specific exposed crystal facet onto graphene substrate directly.
Reduced graphene oxide with sufficient functional groups and defects is an ideal growth substrate to afford intimate interactions with inorganic materials. After proper treatment, such interactions could be strong enough for providing high structural durability and chemical stability.27 Herein, we report the microwave-assisted synthesis of a strongly coupled mesoporous SnO2–graphene hybrid with a high specific surface area as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries and a photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Compared to conventional methods, microwave-assisted synthesis has been demonstrated to be efficient and environmentally friendly, significantly shortening the reaction time, selectively heating compounds with different microwave-absorbing properties, making it possible to selectively deposit very fine SnO2 nanocrystals on both sides of the graphene substrate that contains surface functional groups acting as favourable nucleation sites for heterogeneous growth.
II. Experimental details
Synthesis of graphene
Graphite oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method.28 Briefly, 2 g natural graphite, 1.6 g NaNO3 (purity 99%) and 100 mL H2SO4 (98%) were added into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask. The mixture was stirred in an ice bath for about 2 h followed by gradually adding 9 g KMnO4 (purity 99%) over about 2 h. The as-formed mixture was allowed to react for five days at room temperature. Afterwards, the resultant brownish product was transferred to 1000 mL glass beaker in a fume hood. Successively, 1000 mL 10% HCl aqueous solution was slowly added to the pasty mixture. After continuously stirring for 2 h, this solution was continuously washed thoroughly with 10% HCl aqueous solution many times, and then the purification procedure was similarly repeated three more times using deionized water. The resultant mixture was dispersed in deionized water and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove ions of oxidant origins. Finally, the resulting solid was dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. To produce graphene, 200 mg graphite oxide was suspended in 200 mL deionized water, and then sonicated at 50 °C for 5 h to form a stable graphene oxide dispersion. Then 5.0 mL hydrazine hydrate (80 wt%) was added, and this solution was reacted at room temperature for 24 h with magnetic stirring. Finally, the stacks of graphene were precipitated out as a black solid in the solution. The resulting black precipitate was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
Synthesis of SnO2–graphene hybrid
In a typical procedure, 16 mg synthetic graphene was first dispersed in 40 mL ethanol by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. 0.70 g SnCl4·5H2O, 0.48 g urea and 120 mL distilled water were added into the graphene suspension with vigorous stirring, forming a transparent solution. The transparent solution was transferred into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and placed in the cavity of a domestic microwave oven. The round-bottomed flask was sealed. The temperature was ramped from room temperature to 90 °C in 10 s, and the resulting mixture was refluxed at this temperature for 20 min. Finally, the resulting suspension was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. After retrieved by centrifugation and washing with several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, the resulting black product was dried in vacuum at 100 °C for 8 h and heated in a furnace at 300 °C for 2 h. The SnO2 nanoparticles were also obtained by the same procedure without adding graphene for comparison.
Characterizations
The crystal structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in a 2θ range from 10° to 80° at room temperature. The morphology and microstructure were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7001F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JSM-2010F, 200 kV), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100(UHR), 200 kV). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas (SBET) and porosity of the samples were evaluated on the basis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms using a NOVA4200e nitrogen adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome Instruments, USA). Thermogravimetrics (TGA) analysis was carried out by ZRY-2P thermal analysis equipment in air with 10 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 560 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The as-synthesized samples were ground with KBr, and pressed into a thin disc. Raman spectra (Renishaw, RM 1000) were measured with excitation from the 514 nm line of an Ar ion laser with a power of about 5 mW. X-ray photoelectron sperctra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI Quanteral II (Japan) with an Al K = 280.00 eV excitation source, where the binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C1s peak to reduce the sample charge effect.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a two-electrode system with the prepared samples as the working electrode and lithium foil as the reference and counter electrodes. The working electrode was constituted by mixing the prepared samples as the active material, Super P carbon as the conducting material, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the binder at a weight ratio of 80:10:10, dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a slurry. The mixture slurry was spread onto Cu foil. After vacuum drying at 80 °C for about 12 h and compressing at 1.0 × 106 Pa for 30 s, the electrode disks were punched and weighed. Then 2016 type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box using a Celgard 2400 membrane as the separator, a electrolyte solution obtained by dissolving 1 M LiPF6 into a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC–DMC,1:1 v/v). Charge-discharge cycles of the half-cells were evaluated between 0.01 and 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ using a CT2001A Land battery testing systems (Hannuo Electronics Co. Ltd., China) at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in the potential range of 0.01–2.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) with a scan rate of 0.1 mVs−1 on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Co. Ltd., China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out by applying an AC voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. All tests were performed at room temperature.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic hydrogen production was performed using a homemade system under UV irradiation.29,30 The light source is a 300 W high-pressure Hg lamp (Nanjing Stonetech. EEC Ltd.). Typically, 0.1 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 430 mL mixed solution of propanoic acid (3 mL) and distilled water (427 mL) by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. The resulting suspension was transferred into the reactor and bubbled with Ar gas for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen. The generated gases were periodically collected, and the hydrogen content was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Lunan, Model SP-2000A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2 m stainless column packed with 5 Å molecular sieve. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1.
III. Results and discussion
Morphology and structure characterizations
The crystal structures of the as-prepared samples are determined by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a, all the diffraction peaks of SnO2 nanoparticles are consistent with a tetragonal rutile structure (JCPDS 41-1445), which belongs to the space group P42/mnm (136), no characteristic peaks of impurities, such as other form of tin oxides, are detected, revealing a high phase purity of SnO2 nanoparticles. However, for SnO2–graphene hybrid, the (002) peak of graphene has almost disappeared, due to the relatively weak intensity compared with SnO2. The broad diffraction peaks of SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid suggest a small crystallite size, which are estimated to be 8.3 nm and 5.9 nm based on the Scherrer equation for SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, respectively. The decrease of particle size of SnO2 is mainly resulted from the confinement of graphene. TGA was employed to determine the amount of graphene present in the SnO2–graphene hybrid, as shown in Fig. 1b, a significant weight loss takes place at 500–600 °C, and the weight fraction of graphene is measured to be 15%. Fig. 1c shows FT-IR spectra of graphene and SnO2–graphene hybrid. It can be clearly found that the hybrid exhibits the similar absorption peaks with that of graphene in the medial and high frequency region (≥1300 cm−1). However, an obvious difference emerges in the low frequency region. The absorption peak in hybrid at 580 cm−1 corresponds to the Sn–O stretching vibration. The broad absorption peak of graphene at about 1213 cm−1 is relevant to C–O covalent bonding arising from defective sites in graphene. However, for the hybrid in the same frequency region, the relative absorption characteristic has changed obviously, exhibiting two sharp absorption peaks combined with another emergent peak at 862 cm−1, suggesting a different bonding state with new chemical surroundings caused by the interaction between the SnO2 nanocrystal and the graphene substrate. Additionally, a red shift is observed in the FT-IR spectra of SnO2–graphene hybrid with respect to that of pristine graphene, which may be attributed to chemical doping, i.e., SnO2 as the acceptor-dopant in hybrid, derived from the electron-donating effect of graphene.17 Then it can be concluded that a stable interface structure between graphene and the SnO2 surface is constructed through oxygen–carbon covalent bonding, which is also proved by a powerful instrument for the analysis of graphite-like material, namely, Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1d, the G band of the SnO2–graphene hybrid (1588 cm−1) exhibits blue shifts by 3 cm−1 compared with graphene, which also reveal the electronic interactions between SnO2 nanocrystal and graphene by the formation of C–O covalent bond from the electron donors (graphene) and electron acceptor (SnO2). This interface structure constructed by electronic interaction can facilitate the electron transformation between SnO2 and graphene, which is desirable for lithium storage and photoelectrochemical reactions. And also, a prominent red shift of the D band by 18 cm−1 compared with graphene is a distinct evidence of the influence over defects dispersion on graphene surface originating from the above-mentioned electronic interaction. As literatures reported that the intensity ratio of ID/IG is related to the extent of π-conjugation and concentration of defects.18 The obtained intensity ratio in almost all published papers shows no or little change after the hybridization with metal oxides.15,16,31 However, in our work, it is found that the intensity ratio of SnO2–graphene hybrid is almost 2.21 times as much as that of graphene, far over the highest value (1.14 times) in previous report,15 indicating that more π-conjugations and defects have been doped into the hybrid due to the strongly coupled SnO2–graphene. Then it is believed that this strongly coupled interface formed by C–O covalent bonds not only improves the structural stability but also makes the hybrid structure more conductive than the semiconducting SnO2.32

XPS analysis is further employed to determine the composition and the surface electronic state of the as-synthesized SnO2–graphene hybrid. The detected elements from the sample are tin (Sn3p, 3d, etc.), carbon (C1s), and oxygen (O1s, KLL). As shown in Fig. 2a, two strong peaks located at 486.5 and 495.1 eV are attributed to Sn3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states, respectively, indicating that tin is in the Sn(IV) state. Meanwhile, the peak of C1s is derived from graphene. The high-resolution C1s spectrum of the as prepared hybrid is shown in Fig. 2b. It can be deconvolved into three peaks corresponding to carbon atoms in different oxygen-containing functional groups. The strong C1s peak (284.8 eV) corresponds to graphitic carbon in graphene. Whereas the weaker ones are related to the oxygenated carbons (carbon in C–O at 285.8 eV; carboxylate carbon, O–C–O, 288.9 eV), which may be originated from the residual oxygen-containing functional groups on graphene and the reconstructed oxygen-containing bonds between C atoms and surface oxygen of SnO2. These results are consistent with the FT-IR and Raman spectrum characterizations.

All the above mentioned experimental data evidently confirm that the SnO2 nanocrystals have been strongly attached on graphene substrate through C–O covalent bonding. These interactions can provide powerful chemical attachment and electrical coupling leading to good synergistic effect for achieving the excellent structural stability and electronic conductivity, which will make the hydride exhibit optimized activities for the electrochemical and photocatalytic reaction. As far as we know, this is the first time that the currently published theoretical research32 is well supported by our experimental findings. Additionally, the construction of the stable interface structure is mainly attributed to our efficient strategy. As reported that a high reaction temperature can be achieved instantaneously under microwave irradiation, though transferring energy selectively to microwave-absorbing polar compounds, and causing no temperature gradient. Thus it can facilitate mass production of ultrafine SnO2 nanocrystals in a short time, resulting in a strong contact between SnO2 and reduced graphene oxide, which is crucial for the configuration of electronic interaction and interelectron transfer at the interface.20
The representative morphology and size of the as-prepared samples are firstly characterized by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 3a, the pristine graphene displays a typical crinkly and rippled structure, in which the ultrathin wrinkled structure represents a curled and corrugated morphology that graphene possesses intrinsically. In the absence of graphene, the bare SnO2 nanoparticles synthesized by the same procedure as the one followed for the preparation of SnO2–graphene hybrid are agglomerated with diameters in the range 50–100 nm. Fig. 3c and 3d reveal the general view of the as-synthesized SnO2–graphene hybrid obtained through the microwave-assisted solvothermal process. The graphene surfaces are uniformly decorated with SnO2 nanocrystals, and all the SnO2 nanocrystals are highly dispersed on graphene, no free-standing ones are found outside of graphene. The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups and defect on graphene can act as heterogeneous nucleation sites to anchor SnO2 nanocrystals on dispersed surface sites for avoiding the agglomeration of these small particles. The deposited SnO2 nanocrystals are quasi-spherical in shape and have a uniform particle size of 3–5 nm, which is much smaller than the bare SnO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the as-prepared SnO2–graphene hybrid has uneven and rough surface features and exhibits a porous structure.

To provide further insight into the nanostructure of SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, detailed TEM investigations were also conducted. The high magnification TEM image (Fig. 4a) clearly exhibits that bare SnO2 nanoparticles are an agglomeration consisting of ultrafine nanocrystals. As the ultrafine nanocrystals show a small nanosized diameter in the range 3–5 nm, they will give a large specific surface area with high surface energy towards metastable state thus resulting in the aggregates with irregular cavity to form the mesoporous structure. The large surface area and tunable surface functional groups of graphene allow it to be a perfect host substrate for the heterogeneous growth of desired active SnO2 nanocrystals. When introduced into the synthetic procedures, graphene will act as heterogeneous nucleation sites to facilitate the formation of small SnO2 nanocrystal grains. As further demonstrated in Fig. 4b, the well-dispersed SnO2 nanocrystals are uniformly distributed on the surface of graphene. The HRTEM (Fig. 4c) also manifests that the SnO2 nanocrystals are well-spread from each other and have a uniform particle size of 3–5 nm. The regular lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.33 nm can be assigned to the (110) plane of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445), which is consistent with the XRD results. The SAED pattern (Fig. 4d) recorded from SnO2 nanocrystals deposited on graphene also reveals ring patterns corresponding to a tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2 nanocrystals, which exhibit a polycrystalline property. It has been proved that the crystal facet structure can significantly influence the electrochemical properties and photocatalytic activity.33,34 As the most stable crystal facet SnO2, the (110) facet can provide a low barrier for lithium ion rapid diffusion.32 Consequently, the strongly coupled SnO2–graphene hybrid with the exposed (110) crystal facet is beneficial for the electrochemical and photocatalytic reaction.

In order to investigate the porous structure and surface area of bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were carried out, as shown in Fig. 5a and 5b. Obvious hysteresis hoops are observed in bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, indicating that both of them are porous, while the SnO2–graphene hybrid possesses a much better porosity than bare SnO2 nanoparticles. The total pore volume of SnO2–graphene hybrid (0.32 cm3 g−1) is much larger than that of the SnO2 nanoparticles (0.23 cm3 g−1). Based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equation, the main pore diameter in SnO2–graphene hybrid is 38.46 nm, larger than that (22.54 nm) in bare SnO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the specific surface area of SnO2–graphene hybrid is 280.7 m2 g−1 compared to 245.4 m2 g−1 of bare SnO2 nanoparticles. So it is believable that the microwave-assisted synthesis can facilitate the formation of monodisperse ultrafine SnO2 nanocrystals on graphene. Thus the hybrid exhibits a large specific surface area, which is much higher than that reported in references that are synthesized by ultrasonic ways (250 m2 g−1) and hydrothermal methods (221 m2 g−1).31,35 The increased pore volume, pore diameter and specific surface area could arise from the close stacking of graphene sheets, which possess a high specific surface area and porous structure. Based on the above mentioned morphology and structure characterizations, it can be concluded that the two individual components strongly combine with each other, exhibiting an ideal synergistic effect first emerging in the field of hybrid material structure. Briefly, surface-functionalized graphene can provide ideal growth substrate to control SnO2 nanocrystals, and to avoid aggregation of these nanoparticles to a certain extent, causing monodisperse ultrafine SnO2 nanocrystals with enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the attachment of ultrafine SnO2 nanocrystals can accommodate excessive surface energy of graphene nanosheets and prevent them from stacking into multilayers, allowing the improved structural stability and flexibility. The strongly coupled SnO2–graphene leads to an interface structure between SnO2 surface and graphene substrate. The synergistic mechanism is believed to be mainly derived from the interaction at the interface.32

Electrochemical performances
The electrochemical reactivity of the SnO2–graphene hybrid electrodes was first evaluated through cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at a scan rate of 0.1 mVs−1 and room temperature. Fig. 6 shows the typical cyclic CV curves for bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid. For both bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, two obvious peaks are observed at 0.78 and 0.13 V in the cathodic process. The peak locating at 0.78 V is attributed to the reduction of SnO2 to Sn, the synchronous product of Li2O (eqn (1)) and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.16 SnO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Li2O + Sn(1)
 Fig. 6  The CV curves of bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid in the potential range 0.01–2.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) with a scan rate of 0.1 mVs−1. 
The peak at 0.13 V corresponds to alloying of Sn with Li and the reversible reaction between lithium and graphene. For SnO2–graphene hybrid, in the anodic process, two oxidation peaks around 0.12 and 0.57 V are relate to the lithium extraction from graphene and de-alloying process between Li and Sn, respectively. Even more important, it is found that one distinguished oxidation peak at 1.25 V appears demonstrating that eqn (1) is partially reversible, which results in the decomposition of Li2O.36 Furthermore, the reversible oxidation peak is still maintained in the subsequent second and third cycles. Accordingly, the reduction peak related to eqn (1) also arises, which is attributed to the formation of Li2O again. The position of the reduction peak shifts to the higher potential direction, approaching the potential of corresponding oxidation peak, which could indicate the higher reversibility of eqn (1).37
As shown in Fig. 7a that, in the employed voltage window, the pure graphene delivers a high specific capacity of 1130.7 mAh g−1 in the first discharge, but a low initial charge capacity of 265.3 mAh g−1 due to the short charging voltage (up to 1.5 V). The initial Coulombic efficiency of pure graphene is only 23.5%, but exhibiting a good cycling stability. Fig. 7b and 7c show the first five discharge–charge curves of bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid, respectively. In the first discharge curves, both of them present an extended/long voltage plateau at about 0.95 V, followed by a sloping curve down to the cutoff voltage of 0.01 V, which are typical characteristics of voltage trends for the SnO2 electrode. The first discharge and charge capacities of SnO2–graphene hybrid are 2445.7 and 1329.4 mAh g−1, respectively, which are much larger than that of bare SnO2 nanoparticles (1384.1 and 619.7 mAh g−1). The results demonstrate that both the SnO2 and graphene contribute to the total capacity. But the high capacity is mainly be derived from SnO2. Because the weight fraction of graphene in hybrid is as low as 15%, and the graphene exhibits low capacity measured under the same voltage window with SnO2. In comparison with bare SnO2 nanoparticles, the SnO2–graphene hybrid exhibits a series of more obvious plateau at around 1.3 V in the charge curves, indicating the eqn (1) indeed becomes partially reversible, which is in agreement with the CV measurement. It can be concluded that this is the reason why the capacity is higher than the theoretical capacity of the SnO2. Such a result can be related to the enhanced surface electrochemical reactivity due to its large specific surface area and ultrafine nanocrystalline nature. As far as we know, these initial capacities are the highest up to now for the related SnO2–graphene hybrid anode materials. Xu reported the relative high initial capacities of ultrathin SnO2 nanorod/nitrogen-doped graphene composite synthesized by hydrothermal strategy measured under the same condition, which are 1996 and 1144.5 mAh g−1 for the first discharging and charging processes,15 but still lower than the present value. Such a high initial lithium storage capacity might be associated with the unique structure of strongly coupled mesoporous SnO2–graphene hybrid with a high specific surface area, which can provide more active sites for Li+ intercalation/de-intercalation and shorten the diffusion length for lithium ions in the solid phase, thus improving kinetic properties. The strong oxide-carbon coupled interface structure can facilitate the electron transformation between SnO2 and graphene, leaving an optimized activity for lithium storage. In more detail, the initial capacity is higher than the theoretical capacity of SnO2 (782 mAh g−1), which is mainly attributed to partially reversible conversion from eqn (1). So it can be concluded that the high specific capacity is derived from high-activity ultrafine SnO2 strongly supported by the ideal graphene conductive network. The initial irreversible capacity loss may be mainly caused by the initial irreversible formation of Li2O, inevitable formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and electrolyte decomposition. Fig. 7d shows the cycling performances of bare SnO2 nanoparticles and SnO2–graphene hybrid at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1. The SnO2–graphene hybrid electrodes exhibit a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (54.4%) than the value (44.8%) for bare SnO2 nanoparticle electrodes under full Li alloying–dealloying. After the first discharge-charge process, the Coulombic efficiency increases to over 91% in the subsequent cycles. After 20 cycles, the SnO2–graphene hybrid electrodes maintain a higher reversible specific capacity of over 618.1 mAh g−1 with relatively stable cyclic performance, whereas the bare SnO2 nanoparticle electrodes show poor cycle performance with an initial reversible capacity of 619.7 mAh g−1, followed by a gradual reduction to 254 mAh g−1. These results indicate that the structural feature of this hybrid leads to good connections between SnO2 nanocrystals and graphene, which favours good electron transfer property and effectively prevents the electrical disconnection of the electrode during the Li alloying/de-alloying process. Moreover, the pores in the hybrid could act as buffering spaces against the volume change of SnO2 nanocrystals, and facilitate lithium ions and electrolyte molecules to access to active sites. SnO2 nanocrystals are tightly attached to the graphene and are highly separated on the graphene layer. Flexible graphene can act as conductive structural confines that can accommodate the volume change and prevent the agglomeration of SnO2 nanocrystals, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode.

The excellent electrochemical performances are related to an efficient electrochemical reaction that consists of charge transfer and mass transfer processes. Fig. 8 compares the Nyquist plots of SnO2–graphene hybrid and bare SnO2 nanoparticles. Both plots are characteristic of one semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight sloping line in the low frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle for SnO2–graphene hybrid is much smaller than that of bare SnO2 nanoparticles, thus suggesting that SnO2–graphene hybrid possesses lower contact and charge-transfer impedances due to the fact that the highly conductive graphene can facilitate electron transfer from anchored SnO2 nanocrystals within the whole electrode and thus decrease resistance. Furthermore, the rapid diffusion of electrolyte and lithium ions through the mesopores of SnO2–graphene hybrid can contribute to the low resistance of the hybrid. Considering that the Faradaic reaction is determined by ion transfer and electron conduction, the SnO2–graphene hybrid can allow for an efficient electrochemical reaction.

Photocatalytic activity
The high electronic conductivity of the graphene network has manifested its superiority in promoting electron transfer for electrochemical reactions. It can be expected that the SnO2–graphene hybrid with a high specific surface area and desirable porous structure can also exhibit superior properties in photocatalytic applications. Fig. 9a and 9b show the comparison of the photocatalytic activity of SnO2–graphene hybrid and bare SnO2 nanoparticles for the hydrogen production by photosplitting of water using 0.7 vol% propanoic acid aqueous solution as a sacrificial reagent. It can be concluded that SnO2–graphene hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a much higher photocatalytic activity than bare SnO2 nanoparticles. The total amount of hydrogen production within 4 h for SnO2–graphene hybrid is detected to be ca. 92.3 mL, which is higher than that of bare SnO2 nanoparticles (60.1 mL). Apparently, the hydrogen production rate is highly enhanced over 2 times in the presence of graphene compared to bare SnO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate of hybrid photocatalyst quickly increases in initial irradiation stage and reaches the highest value at the irradiation time of 90 min, then gradually decreases upon the irradiating, while bare SnO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst maintains a relatively stable hydrogen production rate. It has been demonstrated that the sacrificial reagent can prevent photocatalysts from the photocorrosion by providing sacrificial electron donors to react irreversibly with photogenerated holes.29,30,38 The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is closely related to the concentration of sacrificial reagent. The relatively low sacrificial reagent concentration (0.7 vol%) results into a stable hydrogen production rate for bare SnO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst, while a decrease after 90 min for the hybrid photocatalyst, which can demonstrate an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the hybrid photocatalyst that need consume more sacrificial reagent than bare SnO2 nanoparticles photocatalyst in the same condition. The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the reasons that the highly conductive graphene serves as an acceptor of the electrons generated in the SnO2 semiconductor and effectively decreases the recombination probability of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species.39–42 In addition, the high specific surface area and desirable porous structure of SnO2–graphene hybrid can offer more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centres, causing an enhanced photocatalytic activity.

IV. Conclusions
We have prepared strongly coupled mesoporous SnO2–graphene hybrid through a simple microwave-assisted synthesis. The well-dispersed SnO2 nanocrystals with a uniform particle size of 3–5 nm are homogeneously attached on the surface of graphene. Selectively heating by microwave and graphene substrate can facilitate homogeneous nucleation for SnO2 nanocrystals to form the unique mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area. The high electronic conductivity of the graphene network can allow for an excellent mobility of charge carriers for electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions. When used as anode material for lithium ion batteries and photocatalyst for hydrogen production, the as-synthesized SnO2–graphene hybrid exhibits remarkable electrochemical lithium storage properties and photocatalytic activity. In addition, it can be expected that our findings will promote the potential application of graphene-based materials in the field of energy storage and conversion systems.
