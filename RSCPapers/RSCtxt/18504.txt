    AbstractNanoporous SnO2 containing two types of porous structures has been prepared at the air–water interface by a new photochemical route. This room temperature method is surfactant- and template-free, low-cost, and high-yield. Only SnSO4 and diluted H2SO4 aqueous solution were used as precursors. Under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, Sn2+ absorbs photons to produce metallic tin and stannic ions. The metallic tin reacts immediately with oxygen in the air to form SnO2. Meanwhile, a small amount of tin can also react with H2SO4 and is dissolved in the solution to form one type of nanoporous structure. The stannic ions are converted to insoluble H2SnO3 which dehydrates to form the other type of porous SnO2 structure during the subsequent drying process. The as-prepared porous SnO2 has higher photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25 for degrading methyl orange (MO) solution under the irradation of a xenon lamp.
Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis offers the potential for complete elimination of organic pollutants and toxic water pollutants in the area of environmental remediation.1–3 Various new compounds and materials for photocatalysis have been synthesized and explored in the past few decades.4–7 As a photocatalyst, stability and the ability not to create any second pollution are very important. TiO2 is a successful example,2 whereas some other binary semiconductors, for example, most sulfides and ZnO, can cause secondary pollution as a result of photo-erosion,8–10 limiting their practical use. Tin oxide (SnO2) possesses a band-gap, high stability, and acid- and alkali-resistant properties comparable to TiO2, thus it has the potential to be an ideal photocatalyst. In recent years SnO2 has been applied in the area of photocatalysis; however, in nearly all reports, SnO2 served only as a component of a semiconductor composite photocatalyst, such as SnO2/TiO2,5 SnO2/ZnO,6 SnO2/CuO,7etc. In these studies, when SnO2 alone was directly used as the photocatalyst in the control experiments, the photocatalytic activity was not satisfactory; therefore, the possibility of its use as the single and highly effective photocatalyst was not considered.
Like many porous semiconductor materials ,11–15 nanoporous SnO2 has potential advantages in enhancing photocatalytic activity because such structures have high surface areas, plus providing more efficient transport of the reactant molecules to the active sites. These structures could have been prepared by various techniques, including supramolecular templates-assisted sol–gel16 and sonochemical methods,17 organic metal decomposition methods,18 spray pyrolysis,19etc. However, these methods usually involve more than one step, high-temperatures, surfactants or high-cost raw-materials. The as-prepared porous samples couldn't exhibit photocatalytic properties, or they were not explored, because of the well-known wide band gap (3.6 eV at room temperature) of SnO2 itself. Therefore, the development of cost-effective methods, suitable for the large-scale synthesis of SnO2 nanoporous structures with high photocatalytic activity, represents a critical challenge to their practical applications.
In this paper, we introduce a novel room temperature method, photochemical preparation at an air–water interface, to construct nanoporous SnO2. Although photochemical preparation techniques have emerged as a green20 and effective way to prepare noble metals, sulfide, oxide and selenide semiconductors in solution at room temperature,21–26 surfactants or templates27 are necessary to produce micro/nano-structures. Herein, the introduction of the air–water interface was a breaking change compared with the general photochemical routes. In such methods, once the ultra-violet light irradiated the carefully designed precursor solutions, photochemical reactions and interface-induced chemical reactions would occur on the surface simultaneously.25 For the preparation of SnO2, it involved the production, oxidization, and dissolution of metallic tin. All the reactions were localized at the air–water interface, leading to the formation of nanoporous structures. As a room temperature method, certain beneficial groups can be preserved to enhance the properties. The as-prepared nanoporous SnO2 possessed high surface-area and contained some hydroxyl groups, which resulted in higher photocatalytic activity than P25 in photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under the irradiation of a xenon lamp. Compared to the conventional method to prepare porous SnO2, this method is low-cost, environmentally-friendly, efficient, simple and practical.
Experimental section
Preparation and characterization of porous SnO2

Scheme 1 shows a sketch of the designed device and the synthesis process of nanoporous SnO2. A cone-shaped container was chosen as the reaction device and a circular ordinary glass substrate was horizontally put into the precursor solution just below the surface to more easily collect the products after the reaction was stopped. In a typical synthesis, 2.68 g SnSO4 was dissolved in 250 ml 3 wt% H2SO4 aqueous solution, and transferred into the container. Subsquently, the whole device was placed under a UV tube-like lamp (Philips, 254 nm, 8 W). Turning on the lamp, the photochemical reaction occurs on the surface of the solution (Scheme 1a), and a film composed of SnO2 particles gradually forms on the entire surface. With increasing irradiation time, the film gradually deposits on the glass substrate in the container due to the increasing number of particles (Scheme 1b). After irradiation for 15 h, the resulting precipitate on the substrate (Scheme 1c) was collected, washed repeatedly with deionized water until no SO42− ions were detected in the filtrate, and dried in air at 100 °C (Scheme 1d). During irradiation, no particles were produced in the inner of the solution between the substrate and the bottom of the container; thus, the air–water interface was the only site to produce SnO2. The resulting product was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/max2200, with Cu-Kα radiation) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) using a UV-2501PC spectrometer. The specific surface area and porous structure of the sample were measured on a BET surface analyzer (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics).

Photocatalysis
The photocatalytic degradation of MO was carried out in an aqueous solution at ambient temperature. Briefly, 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed in 200 ml of 25mg L−1 MO aqueous solution, and the mixture was put into a column-like container with magnetic stirring. A 500 W xenon lamp is used for the irradiation light source. Samples were then taken out regularly from the reactor and centrifuged immediately to separate any suspended solid. The transparent solution was analyzed by a UV-vis spectrometer, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 464 nm, corresponding to maximum absorption wavelength of MO.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a gives the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized SnO2. The diffraction patterns are in good agreement with the tetragonal cassiterite structure of SnO2 with lattice constants: a = 4.738 and c = 3.187 (JCPDS No. 21–1250). The significant broadening of the diffraction peaks is ascribed to the very small crystallite size within the SnO2 particles. No other phases can be detected by XRD; thus, pure SnO2 crystallites with tetragonal structure can be directly obtained by the photochemical method without high temperature calcination. Fig. 1b shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore-size distribution (inset) of SnO2. The isotherm is identified as type IV, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the sample is about 159 m2 g−1, calculated from N2 isotherms at −196.6 °C. The single-point total volume of pores at P/P0 = 0.97 was 0.143 cm3 g−1. The extremely high BET surface area and large total pore volume strongly support the fact that the as-prepared SnO2 has a nanoporous structure. Interestingly, the pore-size distribution obtained from the isotherm indicates there should be two types of nanopore in the sample. A series of pores are smaller than 3.0 nm (Type I), plus there are many pores with a narrow size distribution centered at around 3.59 nm (Type II). The two types of nanopore could be formed by different mechanisms.

(b) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution (inset) plot for the synthesized SnO2 sample. (c) TEM and (d) HRTEM and SAED (inset) of the synthesized SnO2 powder. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the products are shown in Fig. 1c and 1d. The resulting product particles are approximately 200 nm in size, composed of numerous smaller SnO2 nanocrystals, which are assembled in a nanoporous structural configuration. A representative HRTEM image in Fig. 1d shows the lattice fringes of nanocrystals in particles with a spacing of 0.344 nm, which corresponds to the interplanar distance of (110) planes of tetragonal SnO2. A selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of SnO2 is presented in the inset of Fig. 1d. The SAED pattern shows a set of concentric rings as a result of the small crystallites. The diffraction rings have been indexed to the (110), (101) and (211) planes of the tragonal SnO2.
An FTIR spectrum of the as-synthesized SnO2 is shown in Fig. 2a. A broad intense band at 603 cm−1 is the characteristic band of SnO2 attributed to the Sn–O vibrations. The absorption bands at around 3404 cm−1 [νOH(Sn–OH)] and 1637 cm−1 [δOH(H2O)] are attributed to the O–H vibrations of the absorbed water in the samples.28 The absorption peak at 3404 cm−1 is broad and high, suggesting that there are many O–H bonds in the sample. The absorption peak at 2400 cm−1 is attributed to the adsorption and interaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with water.29 The bands at 1147, 1047 and 960 cm−1 are assigned to the bending mode of different types of surface hydroxyl groups on SnO2,28 indicating that the surface of the SnO2 particles is terminated with many –OH groups. To obtain more information relative to the surface chemical states of the porous SnO2 nanoparticles, XPS analysis is shown in Fig. 2b and 2c. The binding energies at 487 and 495.4 eV (Fig. 2b) indicate that the chemical state of the element tin in the prepared SnO2 nanoparticles is Sn4+.30 The XPS spectrum of O1s can be deconvoluted into two distinct peaks as shown in Fig. 2c. The peak with binding energy around 530.9 eV corresponds to the Sn–O bonds, and the second weaker peak around 532 eV corresponds to hydroxyl bonds (see Fig. 2c). The oxygen content of OH is as high as 29.8% in total oxygen calculated from XPS integral proportion, which also shows the high content of hydroxyl groups in the nanoporous SnO2.

To discover the growth mechanism, a control experiment was carried out by irradiating the same precursor solution sealed in a quartz tube after purging with nitrogen gas. Unlike the preparations at the air–water interface, lots of metallic tin (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) was contained in the product. Based on the experimental phenomena and the character of the air–water interface, a growth mechanism for nanoporous SnO2 is proposed. In general, crystal nuclei form preferentially on a specific interface, such as the air–water interface, where a suitable concentration of precursors is present.25 When irradiating the acid precursor solution with 254 nm UV light, as shown in Scheme 2a, a series of photochemical reactions and chemical reactions will occur. Sn2+ in the precursor solution absorbs photons to produce Sn4+ and aquated electrons.31,32 Sn2+ + hv → Sn4+ + 2eaq(1)
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the formation of hierarchical porous SnO2 by the UV irradiation and drying process. 
The aquated electron, a powerful reductant,33 can reduce Sn2+ to form metallic tin nuclei at the air–water interface preferentially. Sn2+ + 2eaq → Sn0(2)
Also, according to eqn (1) and (2), the total photochemical reaction can be written as follows. (3)
The Gibbs free energy, △rGmo, of the redox reaction eqn (3) is 55.96 kJ mol−1, calculated according to the oxidation potential of Sn2+(EoSn4+/Sn2+ = +0.15 V vs. SHE) and the reduction potential of Sn2+(EoSn2+/Sn0 = −0.14 V vs. SHE). Obviously, it is a thermodynamically disfavoured reaction. However, as we know, photochemical paths can overcome large activation barriers in a short period of time and allow reactivity otherwise inaccessible by thermal methods.34 The Sn2+ in the precursor solution can absorb UV light (See Fig. S2 in the ESI†), and 1 mol photons can provide about 470 kJ/mol energy, which facilitates the photochemical reactions in our experiments.
Once the Sn4+ and metallic tin were produced, a series of thermodynamic reactions would occur in succession. The freshly formed metallic tin possesses high activity and can immediately react with O2 in the air to produce SnO2 particles at the air–water interface. The gradually resulting particles gather on the surface of the solution to form a film as shown in Scheme 2b and 1a. Sn0 + O2 → SnO2(4)
Meanwhile, in the H2SO4 solution, part of the produced metallic tin can react with H+ to produce H2 and Sn2+. The produced Sn2+ can be recycled. Sn0 + 2H+ → H2↑ + Sn2+(5)
Our control experiment (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) indicates that reaction 5 is much slower than the other three, thus more and more SnO2 crystallites can form and accumulate at the air–water interface until UV irradiation is stopped. However, the oxidation rate is slower than the metallic tin production rate, so there is always some metallic tin to be dissolved (Scheme 2, route I). The dissolved tin or the produced H2 lead to the production of one type of nanoporous structure in the SnO2 film at the air–water interface. Because the dissolution is a random and continuous process, the pore size is variable and these pores correspond to the Type I shown in Fig. 1b.
Sn4+ can immediately hydrolyze to produce insoluble H2SnO3 in certain acid concentrations (diluted H2SO4 aqueous solution). This reaction was also localized at the air–water interface where the Sn4+ was generated by the photochemical reaction (reaction 1). This was substantiated as none was produced in the solution. (6)
During the subsequent drying process, H2SnO3 decomposed to produce H2O and SnO2. The evaporation of H2O created another type of pore in the SnO2 particles (Scheme 2. route II). (7)
Similar to the sol–gel process, the pores produced have a narrow size distribution (Type II pore shown in Fig. 1b) as a result of inter- and intramolecular dehydration between the hydroxyls in the hydroxylate.35 However, in this work, because the drying temperature is low, the removal of hydroxyls is incomplete, leading to a porous structure which still contains many hydroxyls.
Further experiments indicated that the choice of Sn2+ and a suitable acid solution was very important for the preparation of SnO2 by a photochemical route. The Sn2+ here was both electron donor and electron acceptor and it couldn't be replaced with any other ions. In addition to sulfuric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid could also be used in the precursor solution. The conversion rate of this reaction with optimum acid concentration was very high, and the entire Sn2+ source could be transformed into SnO2 in 24 h (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†).
The optical properties of the porous structure differed from those of bulk SnO2. Fig. 3 is a diffuse-reflection spectrum of as-synthesized nanoporous SnO2. The absorption edge for the porous SnO2 is around 516 nm, and the band gap energy derived from this is about 2.3 eV (inset of Fig. 3). The literature value for bulk SnO2 is about 3.6 eV.36 The lower value may be due to the imperfect crystallization of the porous SnO2, as revealed by the XRD measurements,37 plus the hydroxyl groups contained in the sample, as shown by XPS analysis. Higher concentrations of surface hydroxyl groups increase the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor.38–40 The absorption edge of the porous SnO2 is located in the visible light region, making it suitable as an effective photocatalyst for UV and visible light.

To demonstrate the potential applicability of the present nanoporous SnO2 in photocatalysis, we investigated its photocatalytic activity relative to that of a commercial photocatalyst (Degussa P25 titania), with the photocatalytic degradation of MO as the test reaction. The characteristic absorption of MO at 464 nm was chosen as the monitored parameter for the photocatalytic degradation process. Fig. 4a shows the absorption spectrum of an aqueous solution of MO (initial concentration: 25 mg L−1, 200 mL) in the presence of nanoporous SnO2 (0.05 g) under exposure to a 500 W xenon lamp for various durations. The absorption peaks at 464 nm, corresponding to the MO molecule, diminished gradually as the exposure time increased and completely disappeared after 20 min. Fig. 4b indicated that the degradation efficiency has reached 97%. Further comparative experiments were carried out to investigate and evaluate the catalytic activity. When a MO solution without nanoporous SnO2 was irradiated, or a MO solution containing SnO2 was kept in a dark area, almost no MO could be degraded. Also, under identical conditions of exposure to the light from a xenon lamp, the nanoporous SnO2 shows much greater activity than P25 (specific surface area 50 m2 g−1). Obviously, the synthesized SnO2 has high photocatalytic activity. Three possible reasons are: porous SnO2 has an absorption edge of about 516 nm (corresponding to the band gap of 2.3 eV), thus can absorb and fully utilize the visible light coming from xenon lamp to photo-degrade MO; the nanoporous structure and high specific surface area allow more efficient transport for the reactant molecules to the active sites;11,41 the hydroxyl groups decrease the band gap and increase the hydrophilic property of the nanoporous SnO2.

Conclusion
In summary, a simple and robust technique for the production of porous SnO2 with high photocatalytic activity has been developed. The preparation starts by irradiating UV light at the air–water interface of a SnSO4 solution. The resulting nanoporous SnO2 possesses two types of mesoporous structure, a specific surface area in the order of 159 m2 g−1, and a band gap of around 2.3 eV. The efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals leads to substantially higher photocatalytic activities compared to that of P25. The new nanoporous SnO2 material should be useful in photocatalysis, gas-sensors,42,43 batteries,44 and solar cells.45
