The reference polymer (PTB-FQx) was prepared via polymerization between benzodithiophene (BDT) and mono-fluorinated Qx monomers, and the fluorine atom of PTB-FQx was replaced by a CN substituent to create the target polymer PTB-CNQx. In addition, another target polymer PTBF-CNQx was prepared by incorporating additional fluorine atoms on the two thiophene side chains of the BDT unit in PTB-CNQx. The photovoltaic performances of all polymers were comprehensively examined by fabricating both fullerene and nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). Owing to the affirmative contributions of the CN substituent, PSCs based on CN-substituted PTB-CNQx exhibit higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than the corresponding devices with the fluorinated PTB-FQx reference. Moreover, further increases in the PCE of up to 9.2 and 14.0% were achieved for the devices based on PTBF-CNQx with fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study can offer not only the first direct comparison of the photovoltaic properties of the F and CN substituents of conjugated polymers but also the highest PCEs among the reported CN-substituted polymers in both categories of fullerene and nonfullerene PSCs.
Introduction
For the last two decades, the efficient transformation of solar energy into electrical energy has become crucial to decelerate the emerging environment- and energy-related global issues. As a promising green-energy converter, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention because of their unique advantages such as light weight, flexibility, and scalable roll-to-roll processability.1,2 In typical PSCs, the formation of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) network between electron-donors and electron-acceptors is preferred, as it can trigger efficient separation and transport of photo-generated charges in the devices.3 In addition, the intimate and complementary absorption between donors and acceptors in an active layer of the device is required to achieve high-performance PSCs. Generally, the following two types of electron-acceptors are used in PSCs, fullerene- and nonfullerene-type acceptors. Because of the substantial progress in the domain of materials design and device fabrication, the record PCEs of fullerene- and nonfullerene-based single-junction PSCs have reached over 11% and 16%, respectively.4–11 The unique features, such as broad light absorption, tunable energy level, and satisfactory morphology in blend films of nonfullerene acceptors, can contribute to the higher PCEs of nonfullerene-based devices than of fullerene-based ones.4 Apart from n-type acceptors, numerous p-type conjugated polymer donors have been developed to be used as the photoactive light-absorbing components in PSCs.12–17 These polymers usually comprise alternating electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) building blocks along the polymer backbone, resulting in reduced bandgaps through the generation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states. Together with the formation of the D–A type architecture, the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing units into polymer structures is considered one of the promising approaches to improving the photovoltaic performances of PSCs. Under this condition, the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymers can be reduced, enhancing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) as well as the PCE of the devices. The remarkable features of the fluorine atom such as the small size, high electron affinity, and low steric hindrance, enable it to be preferentially used for this purpose.18–22 Although several noticeable breakthroughs toward realizing high-performance PSCs have been achieved by using polymers with fluorine atoms, other polymers that possess similar electron-withdrawing moieties such as sulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, and cyano (CN) also exhibit promising potential in photovoltaic applications.23–25 In particular, CN substituents are gaining increasing attention, as they can not only induce strong dipole moments and balanced charge transport but also fine tune the energy levels of the conjugated polymers.26,27 The CN unit was mainly incorporated into the A building block of D–A type polymers such as benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole, and monocyano-substituted polymers exhibited higher PCE than their dicyano-substituted counterparts.28–31 Notably CN substituents can efficiently reduce the bandgap of polymers by stabilizing their LUMO energy levels while retaining the HOMO energy levels.30 Therefore, the PCEs of the devices that are based on CN-containing polymers can be enhanced by achieving short-circuit current (JSC) without sacrificing VOC. Contrarily, fluorine atoms in polymer structures usually reduce both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the polymers without significant alteration in their band gap.18 However, despite these unique features of CN substituents, the research on the development of CN-containing conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications is still in its infancy. Most previously conducted studies were focused on fullerene-based PSCs, and their PCEs were limited to 8.6%.31
Herein, three quinoxaline (Qx)-based polymers with the typical D–A configuration were synthesized to investigate the effect of CN substituents on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers (see Fig. 1a). The electron-donating benzodithiophene (BDT) monomer was connected to the electron-withdrawing mono-fluorinated Qx monomer via a thiophene bridge to synthesize the reference polymer PTB-FQx. Next, the existing fluorine atom in the Qx unit of the reference polymer was replaced by the stronger electron-withdrawing CN moiety to afford PTB-CNQx. Finally, additional fluorine atoms were incorporated into the 4-position of the two thiophene side chains on the BDT unit to produce another target polymer PTBF-CNQx. In addition, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and an electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring with a benzothiadiazole core (Y6BO) were employed as acceptors in fullerene and nonfullerene PSCs, respectively (see Fig. 1a). After examining their structural, optical and electrochemical features, the photovoltaic properties of the polymers were comprehensively investigated by fabricating both fullerene and nonfullerene PSCs using the inverted-type device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Ag (see Fig. 1b). As depicted in Fig. 1c, the generation of efficient charge separation and charge transport in both the devices was supported by the electronic energy levels of all the device components. Because of the favorable contributions by the CN substituent, the devices based on PTB-CNQx with fullerene (8.0%) and nonfullerene (11.7%) acceptors exhibited higher PCEs than those based on the PTB-FQx reference with fullerene (5.7%) and nonfullerene (7.4%) acceptors, respectively. Notably, this is the first direct comparison of the photovoltaic properties of the polymers with either fluorine or CN substituents at the same position. In addition, the devices with nonfullerene acceptors exhibited higher PCE than those with fullerene acceptors, because of the complementary light absorption of the nonfullerene Y6BO acceptor in the longer wavelength range of 600–900 nm (see Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the best PCEs up to 9.2% and 14.0% were achieved from the devices based on PTBF-CNQx with fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors, respectively, because of the presence of additional fluorine atoms on the two thiophene side chains of the BDT unit. To the best of our knowledge, these values are the highest efficiencies among those reported for all the CN-substituted polymers in both the categories, i.e., fullerene and nonfullerene PSCs, and they demonstrate the strong potential of CN-substituted polymers in photovoltaic applications.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The synthetic routes to PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are summarized in Scheme S1 in the ESI,† and all the detailed synthetic methods are also provided in the Experimental section in the ESI.† To develop D–A type conjugated polymers for realizing high-performance PSCs, the promising electron-donating BDT and electron-withdrawing Qx derivatives were selected as the basic building blocks. The fluorine atom was introduced at the selected position of the Qx monomer to produce the reference polymer of PTB-FQx. Subsequently, structural modifications such as the replacement of the fluorine atom on the Qx unit with the stronger electron-withdrawing CN moiety and the addition of fluorine atoms on the two thiophene side chains on the BDT unit were consecutively performed to produce the target polymers of PTB-CNQx and PTBF-CNQx, respectively. These structural changes can result in significant alterations in the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. In addition, the existence of the branched alkyl and alkoxy chains on the BDT and Qx building blocks, respectively, can be crucial to determining the solubility and morphologies of the polymers. Therefore, the synthetic strategies used in this study might be fairly useful not only to synthesize the promising polymers for PSCs but also to investigate the influence of the CN functionality on the photovoltaic properties of the conjugated polymers. To synthesize the target polymers, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and 1,2-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione were first prepared according to previously reported procedures.32,33 Next, the existing fluorine atom in 1 was substituted by the CN moiety to produce 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5-carbonitrile (2). Dibrominated Qx monomers with F (3) and CN (4) substituents were prepared via the reaction between benzothiadiazole derivatives of 1 and 2, respectively, and 1,2-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione under successive zinc-involved reduction and condensation reaction conditions. The Stille polymerization between the BDT monomer of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane) (5) and Qx monomers with F (3) and CN (4) substituents afforded D–A type polymers PTB-FQx and PTB-CNQx, respectively. Finally, the polymerization between the fluorinated BDT monomer of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (6) and the Qx monomer (4) under the same conditions yielded PTBF-CNQx. The three polymers showed satisfactory solubility in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene. The number average molecular weight of the polymers was measured via gel permeation chromatography with the THF eluent, and the values are 38.4, 59.9, and 26.1 kDa for PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx, respectively. In addition, high thermal stabilities of these polymers were confirmed via thermogravimetric analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere, and their onset decomposition temperatures at 5 wt% loss (Td5%) were greater than 430 °C (see Fig. S1†).
Optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers
The optical properties of the polymers were investigated using UV-Vis absorption spectra in film, and the results are depicted in Fig. S2.† Similar to other D–A type polymers, all the three polymers exhibit two differentiated absorption regions in the high-energy (320–480 nm) and low-energy (520–780 nm) parts of the spectra. The peaks in the shorter-wavelength region are related to the π–π* transition, while those in the longer-wavelength region correspond to the ICT formation of the polymer backbones. The ICT absorption peak of PTB-CNQx is red-shifted to 642 nm with respect to that of PTB-FQx at 619 nm, and this shift is attributed to the stronger ICT formation due to the higher electron-withdrawing ability of the CN moiety than of the fluorine atom. However, the ICT peak of PTBF-CNQx was blue-shifted to 618 nm upon the addition of two fluorine atoms in the BDT unit. This result can be related to the increased bandgap of the polymer due to the reduced HOMO energy level. The absorption coefficient of the polymers in the film were measured, and the values were 6.23, 6.73, and 7.32 × 104 cm−1 for PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx, respectively. The sequential chemical modification of the polymers, i.e., the replacement of the fluorine atom with the CN moiety on the electron-withdrawing Qx unit followed by the addition of two fluorine atoms on the electron-donating BDT unit, can improve the α values of the polymers in a step-by-step manner. In addition, the optical bandgaps of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx measured using absorption edges are 1.72, 1.65, and 1.67 eV, respectively. The trend in the optical bandgap is in good agreement with the change in the maximum ICT peaks of the polymers. The electrochemical oxidation behaviors of the polymers were investigated via cyclic voltammetry measurement to evaluate their HOMO energy levels. As depicted in Fig. S3,† the oxidation onset potentials of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx against a ferrocene (Fc)/ferrocenium (Fc+) external standard are 0.38, 0.53, and 0.68 V, respectively. Considering the energy level of ferrocene as −4.80 eV,34 the HOMO levels of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are estimated to be −5.18, −5.33, and −5.48 eV, respectively. In addition, the LUMO energy levels of the polymers are determined based on the HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps, and their values are −3.46, −3.68, and −3.81 eV for PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx, respectively. The incorporation of the CN substituent can stabilize the LUMO energy level (approximately by 0.22 eV) more than the HOMO energy level (approximately by 0.15 eV) of PTB-CNQx, compared with the energy levels of the fluorinated PTB-FQx reference. Therefore, the band gap of PTB-CNQx (1.65 eV) becomes narrower than that of PTB-FQx (1.72 eV). The change in the electronic structures observed during the transition from PTB-FQx to PTB-CNQx corresponds well with that observed in other CN-substituted polymers. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTBF-CNQx are further reduced to −5.48 and −3.81 eV, respectively, because of the additional two fluorine atoms on the BDT unit. All the optical and electrochemical data of the polymers are summarized in Table S1.† Overall, the incorporation of the electron-withdrawing CN group and fluorine atom on the Qx and BDT units, respectively, can significantly affect the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers.
Theoretical calculation for the polymers
To estimate the optimized geometries and Frontier molecular orbitals of the polymers, density functional simulations on the dimer model units were conducted at the B3LYP/6-31** level of the Gaussian 09 program,35 and the results are depicted in Fig. S4.† All the alkyl and alkoxy chains on the polymer structures were reduced to small methyl and methoxy units, respectively, for ensuring simple simulation. In the optimized geometry, the dihedral angle between the thiophene and Qx units in PTB-FQx is 25°, and thiophene sulfur atoms face the opposite direction with respect to the Qx nitrogen atoms. When the fluorine atom on the Qx unit was replaced with the CN moiety, the dihedral angles increased to 45° in PTB-CNQx and PTBF-CNQx, and the significant steric hindrance induced by the bulky CN group can result in more tilted polymer conformations. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the CN moiety and triple bond, the band gap and the maximum absorption wavelength of PTB-CNQx are red-shifted compared to those of PTB-FQx. The HOMO wave functions of the polymers are delocalized along the polymer backbones. However, the replacement of the fluorine atom by the CN moiety can also induce more concentrated LUMO wave functions on the electron-withdrawing Qx units of PTB-CNQx and PTBF-CNQx, compared with the LUMO wave function of PTB-FQx. Therefore, significant alterations in the LUMO energy levels of the polymers are expected in the presence of the CN substituent. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are −4.76/–2.35, −4.91/–2.54, and −5.05/–2.62 eV, respectively. A comparison between PTB-FQx and PTB-CNQx reveals a noticeable decrease in the LUMO energy level form −2.35 to −2.54 eV with a slightly less prominent reduction in the HOMO energy level from −4.76 to −4.91 eV. Both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PTBF-CNQx decreased further to −5.05 and −2.62 eV, respectively, because of the additional fluorine atoms on the BDT unit. Overall, the trend in the LUMO and HOMO energy levels calculated using theoretical analyses agrees well with that obtained via optical and electrochemical experiments (vide supra).
Photovoltaic properties of fullerene and nonfullerene-based polymer solar cells
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by using an inverted-type PSC with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. To optimize the performance of the device with the PC71BM acceptor, a number of devices with various important parameters, such as the blend ratio between polymer donor and acceptor, type and concentration of the processing additive, and thickness of the active layer, were fabricated and tested (see Table S2†). The optimum blend ratios of polymer:PC71BM were determined to be 3:5 and 3:4 for PTB-FQx and PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx, respectively. In addition, the active-layer thickness was adjusted to 75 nm, and 3.0 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as a processing additive under optimum conditions. The current–density (J–V) vs. voltage curves of the devices with PC71BM under optimum conditions under AM 1.5G illumination are depicted in Fig. 2a, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The PCE of the device based on the mono-fluorinated reference PTB-FQx is limited to 5.7%, while that of the device with the mono CN-substituted PTB-CNQx is increased to 8.0%. This prominently enhanced PCE observed in the device based on PTB-CNQx is attributed to the simultaneous increase in all the device parameters such as JSC, VOC, and fill factor (FF), compared with those of the device based on the PTB-FQx reference. The replacement of the fluorine atom on the Qx unit of PTB-FQx with the stronger electron-withdrawing CN moiety can impose better light absorption ability and low-lying HOMO energy level on PTB-CNQx, thereby enhancing the JSC and VOC values of the related PSCs. Along with the CN substituent, the additional two fluorine atoms on the thiophene side chains of the BDT unit in PTBF-CNQx can induce similar positive effects on the molar absorption coefficient and HOMO energy level of the polymer. Therefore, the highest PCE of 9.2% is obtained from the device based on PTBF-CNQx with the best JSC, VOC, and FF values of 16.0 mA cm−2, 0.91 V, and 63.6%, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves of all the devices exhibit satisfactory photon responses in the range of 300–700 nm with maximum IPCE values of over 70%. The calculated Jsc of the device by using IPCE curves agrees well with the values obtained using the J–V curves (see Table 1).

In addition, we fabricated and tested similar inverted-type PSCs with the nonfullerene acceptor. As a well-known nonfullerene acceptor, Y6BO can improve the photovoltaic performances of PSCs by enhancing both the intermolecular interactions via polymer donors and the complementary optical absorption in the longer wavelength region of 600–900 nm.36 After screening the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs under diverse fabrication conditions, the best device performance was achieved at a blend ratio of 1:1 (w/w) between polymer:Y6BO (see Table S3†). In addition, the active-layer thickness of the optimized devices was controlled to 85–90 nm with 0.5 vol% DIO. The J–V curves of the devices with Y6BO under the best conditions under AM 1.5G illumination are depicted in Fig. 2c, and the related photovoltaic results are summarized in Table 1. Mostly, the PCEs of the devices with Y6BO become significantly higher than those of the corresponding devices with PC71BM. For example, the PCE of the PC71BM-based device with the reference PTB-FQx was 5.7%, but that of the Y6BO-based device increases to 7.4%. In addition, the devices with PTB-CNQx and PTBF-CNQx exhibited similar improvements in their PCEs when PC71BM was replaced by the Y6BO acceptor (see Table 1). This enhancement in the PCEs of the Y6BO-based devices can be mainly attributed to their significant photocurrent generation. The broad complementary light absorption between the polymers and Y6BO in an active layer can significantly increase the JSC values of the devices. As depicted in Fig. 2d, the IPCE curves of all the devices cover broad wavelengths that range from 350 to 900 nm with the maximum values over 80%, increasing the JSC values of all the devices over 23.5 mA cm−2. In addition, similar to the trend in the PCEs of the PC71BM-based devices, the PCEs of the devices with the Y6BO acceptor gradually improved in the following order of PTB-FQx and PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx. Because of the progressive and concomitant increase in the device parameters of JSC, VOC, and FF during the step-by-step structural modifications of the polymers, the highest PCE of 14.0% was achieved for the device based on PTBF-CNQx with a JSC of 27.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.83 V, and FF of 61.2%. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers and their blend films with Y6BO were analyzed to investigate the charge-generation features in the Y6BO-based devices. As depicted in Fig. S5,† all the polymers exhibit broad PL emission in the range of 670–870 nm at an excitation wavelength of 610 nm. However, the PL emissions of all the blend films with Y6BO are almost quenched, indicating efficient charge generation at the interface between the polymers and Y6BO. Overall, all the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs with PC71BM and Y6BO acceptors clearly reveal that the sequential synthetic strategies used in this study, i.e., the substitution of fluorine atoms with the CN moiety on the A block and the addition of fluorine atoms on the D block of D–A type Qx-based polymers are highly beneficial for improving the PCEs of the devices irrespective of the acceptor type.
The charge-transport properties of the devices are investigated by fabricating hole- and electron-only devices with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:acceptor/Au and ITO/ZnO/polymer:acceptor/LiF/Al, respectively. Expectedly, the hole- and electron-only devices with either the PC71BM or Y6BO acceptor exhibit the characteristics of space-charge-limited-current behavior, and the characteristics can be expressed using the famous Mott-Gurney law (Fig. S6a–d†).37,38 The calculated hole/electron mobilities of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx with the PC71BM acceptor are 1.89 × 10−3/1.90 × 10−3, 3.64 × 10−3/3.71 × 10−3, and 4.01 × 10−3/4.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Both the hole and electron mobilities are gradually improved in the order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx simultaneously, showing satisfactory correlation with the trend in JSC and FF of their corresponding photovoltaic devices. The hole/electron mobilities of the polymers with the Y6BO acceptor are also increased in the same order, and the values for PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are 2.92 × 10−3/2.29 × 10−3, 4.19 × 10−3/3.54 × 10−3, and 6.59 × 10−3/6.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole and electron mobilities of the devices with Y6BO than of the devices with PC71BM correspond to trends in their respective JSC values. To gain further insights into the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, the relationship between the photocurrent density (JPh) and effective voltage (Veff) of the devices with the PC71BM acceptor, where JPh = JL (current density under illumination) − JD (current density under dark) and Veff = V0 (voltage at JPh = 0) − Va (applied voltage), was investigated. As depicted in Fig. 3a, the Veff values of the devices in the saturated photocurrent regime (VSat) increased in the following order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx. The smaller VSat indicates faster transition from the space-charge-limited regime to the saturation regime. The VSat values of the devices with the polymers followed similar trends as those of the JSC and PCE values. In addition, the exciton dissociation probability (JPh/JSat) of the devices was calculated, and the values for the devices based on PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are 85.4%, 91.0%, and 91.2%, respectively. This result indicates that the device with PTBF-CNQx had the best charge-extraction behavior. In addition, the maximum exciton generation rate (GMAX) at the JSat of the devices was estimated by using the equation of GMAX = JPh/qL, where q and L denote the electron charge and thickness of the active layer, respectively. The GMAX values under the JSat condition of the devices based on PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are 1.27 × 1028, 1.38 × 1028, and 1.42 × 1028, respectively. The trend in the GMAX of the devices agrees well with the trend in the absorption coefficient of the polymers, because of the strong dependence of GMAX on the light absorption of the active layer.39 In addition, we monitored the relationship between VOC and light intensity, defined by VOC = (nkT/q) × ln (light intensity), where k, T, and q denote the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively (see Fig. 3b).40 The n value becomes close to one when bimolecular recombination is overwhelming, while it reaches two in the case of dominant trap-assisted recombination. The n values of the devices based on PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx were calculated to be 1.97, 1.35, and 1.30, respectively. Therefore, the lowest trap-assisted recombination of the device based on PTBF-CNQx can justify its highest JSC and FF values. Furthermore, the charge-carrier recombination characteristics of the devices were examined using the relationship between Jsc and the light intensity, defined as JSC = (light intensity)α.41 As depicted in Fig. S7a,† the α values of the devices based on PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx were 0.98, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively, representing efficient suppression of the undesirable bimolecular recombination. Overall, most device parameters related to the exciton-generation, charge-extraction, and charge-recombination characteristics of the device with PC71BM are continuously improved by sequentially modifying the polymer structures. These results can strongly support the tendencies observed in JSC, FF and PCE of the PSCs with the PC71BM acceptor.

Other than the studies on the PSCs with the PC71BM acceptor, the charge-generation, charge-extraction and charge-recombination properties of the devices with the Y6BO acceptor were also investigated using the same device structure. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the Veff of the PSCs with Y6BO at VSat is improved in the following order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx with JPh/JSat values of 87.2, 93.7, and 93.3%, respectively. These results can also explain the higher JSC and PCE of the device with CN-substituted polymers than of the device with the fluorinated reference. The GMAX values under the JSat condition of Y6BO-based devices with PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are 1.98 × 1028, 1.99 × 1028, and 2.05 × 1028, respectively. The GMAX data of the devices with Y6BO are proportional to the absorption coefficients of the polymers. The same trend in the GMAX data was also observed for the devices based on PC71BM. In addition, the n values of the Y6BO-based PSCs with PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are estimated to be 1.28, 1.27, and 1.20, respectively, using the relationship between VOC and light intensity (see Fig. 3d). Notably, the n values of the devices with Y6BO are lower than those of the corresponding devices with PC71BM, because of their less trap assisted recombination. Moreover, the devices with Y6BO exhibited a predominant monomolecular recombination process, as α values of the devices calculated using the relationship between JSC and light intensity for PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are 0.89, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively (see Fig. S7b,† SD). Similarly, for the devices with PC71BM, the exciton-generation, charge-extraction, and charge-recombination properties of the devices with the Y6BO acceptor are gradually improved in the order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx.
Morphology of the polymers and their blends
The molecular ordering and crystallinity in the active layer of the devices are crucial to determining the overall photovoltaic performances of PSCs. Therefore, grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted on the neat polymer films and on their blend films with either the PC71BM or Y6BO acceptor, and the resultant images and plots are depicted in Fig. 4. As observed from the GIWAXS patterns (see Fig. 4a–c) and the related scattering profiles of the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions (see Fig. 4j), the intensity of the (100) peak along the IP direction and that of the (010) peak in the OOP direction from the neat polymer films are gradually enhanced in the order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx. Moreover, the π–π stacking diffraction (010) peaks in the neat film of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx are located at 1.65, 1.67, and 1.70 Å−1 along the OOP direction, corresponding to π–π stacking distances of 3.85, 3.80, and 3.69 Å, respectively. These results imply the improved face-on orientation relative to the surface upon the consecutive addition of the electron-withdrawing CN and F moieties on the Qx and BDT units of the polymer structure, respectively. In particular, the larger size of the CN moiety than of the fluorine atom can induce more steric hindrance, and thereby the planarity of the polymer backbone is significantly reduced. Under these conditions, the undesirable aggregations can be efficiently diminished, which can improve the miscibility and orientation of the blend films. The face-on orientation with smaller π–π stacking distances in the crystalline domain facilitates vertical charge transfer in the active layer, which might enhance the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. However, the intensities of the diffraction peak that corresponds to the (010) peak of the blend films with the polymers and PC71BM along the OOP direction became significantly weaker than those of the neat polymer films (see Fig. 4d–f). The peaks at approximately 1.30 Å−1 along the IP and OOP directions (see Fig. 4k) of these blend films originate from the amorphous PC71BM domains.42 Interestingly, the scattering patterns in the lamella and π–π stacking peak along the IP and OOP directions, respectively, were restored for the blend films of the polymers and Y6BO (see Fig. 4g–i). The intensity of the (100) peak along the IP direction and the (010) peak along the OOP direction from the Y6BO-blend polymer films becomes even more prominent than that of the corresponding peaks of the neat polymer films (see Fig. 4l). Although the obvious face-on molecular packing orientation of the Y6BO acceptor can also contribute to these enhanced peak intensities (see Fig. S8†), the strong intermolecular interactions between the polymers and Y6BO can result in the formation of favorable face-on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the charge-transport properties of the devices with the polymers and Y6BO can be significantly facilitated, improving the JSC, FF, and PCE. In addition, these results support the better photovoltaic performances of the devices with the Y6BO acceptor than of the devices with the PC71BM acceptor.

The morphologies of the blend films based on polymer:PC71BM and polymer:Y6BO with the optimum processing conditions were investigated via transmission electron microscopy (see Fig. S9†). In the case of the active layers based on PTB-FQx with either PC71BM or Y6BO, significant phase separation and aggregation were observed. However, the active layer based on PTB-CNQx exhibited better nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks, and that based on PTBF-CNQx showed the best nanoscale phase separated morphology. Therefore, favorable nanoscale phase separation in the active layer can result in a higher PCE of the related PSC via efficient charge-separation and charge-transport. In addition, the size of the phase separation of the active layer based on the polymers and Y6BO blend is slightly bigger than that of the active layer based on the corresponding polymer and PC71BM. This result is coherent with the fact that the FFs of the devices based on Y6BO are lower than the FFs of those based on PC71BM. The devices were kept in a glove box without passivation. After 3000 hours, the PCEs of the devices based on PTB-FQx:PC71BM, PTB-CNQx:PC71BM, PTBF-CNQx:PC71BM, PTB-FQx:Y6BO, PTB-CNQx:Y6BO, and PTBF-CNQx:Y6BO were measured to be 82, 87, 91, 76, 94, and 88% of their initial PCEs. The device based on PTB-FQx exhibited the lowest long-term stability. However, it is worth noting that the long-term stability data give us only information on lowering the PCE of the devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, to elucidate the usefulness of the strong electron-withdrawing CN moiety for developing high-performance polymers for photovoltaic applications, three conjugated polymers that comprised BDT and Qx units as the basic D and A building blocks, respectively, were designed and synthesized. Upon producing the mono-fluorinated reference polymer PTB-FQx, the fluorine atom in the Qx unit of PTB-FQx was substituted by the CN moiety to afford the target polymer, named PTB-CNQx. The replacement of the fluorine atom by the stronger electron-withdrawing CN unit can induce a bathochromic shift in absorption, higher molar extinction coefficient, and low-lying HOMO energy level of the polymer. These favorable changes can simultaneously enhance the JSC, VOC, and PCE values of the PSCs with both PC71BM and Y6BO acceptors. In addition, the charge-generation, charge-transport and charge-recombination characteristics in both the types of PSCs improved upon the addition of the CN substituent. To further optimize the polymer structures, another target polymer of PTBF-CNQx was prepared by adding two fluorine atoms on the thiophene side chains of the BDT unit of PTB-CNQx. This supplemental structural change can also give rise to the affirmative contributions on most of the parameters of the PSCs, i.e., JSC, VOC, and FF. Consequently, the PCEs of the PSCs are gradually increased in the order of PTB-FQx, PTB-CNQx, and PTBF-CNQx irrespective of the acceptor type. In addition, the PCEs of the device with Y6BO are significantly higher than those of the devices with PC71BM, because of the unique features of Y6BO acceptors, such as complementary light absorption at longer wavelengths and preferential face-on orientation. The best PCEs of 9.2% and 14.0% were achieved from the devices based on PTBF-CNQx with PC71BM and Y6BO acceptors, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these values are the highest PCEs among those of all the CN-containing polymers developed so far in both the categories. Therefore, this study can provide not only meaningful structures-properties of the CN-substituted conjugated polymers but also their enormous potential in photovoltaic applications.
