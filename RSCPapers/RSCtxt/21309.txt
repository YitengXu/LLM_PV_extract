    , Accepted 11th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractInfrared light (NIR) accounts for more than 50% of the energy donated by the Sun to the Earth, but most of this type of energy is not utilized in photocatalytic reactions. The up-conversion of infrared light into visible light is a probable strategy to utilize NIR in solar energy storage and conversion into hydrogen. Herein, a cooperative photocatalyst consisting of RGO, CdS and an up-conversion component (NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+) has been identified as an excellent photocatalyst for overall water splitting to hydrogen. By uniting an up-conversion component with a visible light catalyst, a cooperative catalyst has been developed and 980 nm NIR driven water splitting has been achieved. RGO and CN were selected, and their water splitting performances based on their incorporation into combined catalysts were compared. The results indicated that only RGO had a significant promotion effect on photocatalytic water splitting activity due to its good conductivity on its huge net-like 2D structure. A highest hydrogen evolution rate of 4.54 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved.
Introduction
The increasing worldwide consumption of fossil fuels and growing energy demand are resulting in an urgent need for the transition from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources,1–4 such as solar energy, hydrogen and methanol. Solar-driven water splitting is one of the most promising approaches to obtain hydrogen, although it is still challenging due to its low efficiency.5 There are two main obstacles impeding the good performance of photocatalysts; one is that most of the charges produced under light irradiation are not finally used for hydrogen evolution reaction processes due to the poor charge transfer characteristics of many photocatalysts. One can overcome this by fabricating an excellent support with good conductivity on a visible light sensitive photocatalyst. Another obstacle is unsatisfied absorption properties in the near infrared region of solar irradiation because infrared light accounts for more than 50% of the energy donated by the Sun to the Earth, most of which has been wasted in photocatalytic reactions.6–9 It is probable that the second obstacle will be overcome by up-conversion of infrared light into visible light because we can use an available visible light sensitive photocatalyst such as CdS, which has been identified as an excellent photocatalyst under visible light, and combine it with an up-conversion component to form a cooperative assembly catalyst. Then the frequently wasted infrared irradiation can be used to generate hydrogen.10
There are many papers dealing with IR light sensitive photocatalysts, such as conjugated polymer organic semiconductors,11 Z scheme conjugated polymer/CdS hybrids,12 plasmon resonance (LSPR) Au nanorods (NRs)13,14 and Pt-tipped Au nanorods,15 Au@HxK1−xNbO3 nanoscrolls,16 2D hybrids of black phosphorus (BP)/WS2,17 N-doped carbon dots (N-CDs)/CdS,18 Cu2(OH)PO4,19 up-conversion (UC)-semiconductor (Fe3O4–NaYF4–Yb,Tm)@TiO2 photocatalysts,20 YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2 core/shell nanoparticles,21 Au-1.0%-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–CdTe–ZnO PEC22 and ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets with YF3–Yb.23 Among these catalysts, rare earth doped up-conversion materials have attracted much more attention recently because they can emit high-energy photons after the absorption of two or more lower-energy pump photons,24–27 and have been widely utilized in laser devices,28 solar cells,29,30 biological imaging applications31–33 and photocatalysis.21,22,34 NaYF4, with a low phonon energy (∼355 cm−1), low nonradiative decay rates and high radioactive emission rates, has become the most efficient host material for Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ up-conversion components.35–38 NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ is a very efficient NIR-to-visible up-converter due to the near-perfect resonance between a specific crystal-field match of Yb3+ and Er3+. UC (NIR-to-visible light) can take place through a direct (resonant) energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ and no extra phonon-mediated step is required.39 However, during photoelectron transfer in dye-sensitized solar cells, the up-conversion particles may trap the electrons and lead to recombination in this device, which will limit the enhancement in photocurrent caused by the up-conversion.40–42 In order to overcome this problem, core–shell structural β-NaYF4–Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2,40 β-NaYF4–Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2@TiO2,41 and NaGdF4-Yb/Er@NaGdF4@SiO243 have been designed to reduce the recombination by the effective surface passivation of the seed core. Through an improvement in support conductivity, the negative effect of electron capture can be also decreased. Given that, carbon materials such as RGO and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are excellent candidates to solve this problem.
RGO exhibits excellent electronic mobility44–47 and is an efficient catalyst support for a photocatalyst: for instance, RGO–MoS2–NiCo2O4 shows electrocatalytic water splitting activity,48 and an RGO/MoS2/Pd 2D heterostructure exhibits a low overpotential for electrocatalytic overall water splitting with excellent stability.49 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) also show good conductivity and are used as a catalyst support: for example, CNTs@TiO2 nanoribbons,50 g-C3N4/Cobalt@N-doped CNTs,51 porous ZnO nanosheets and CNT hybrids52 have shown improved photocatalytic activities.
In order to improve the conductivity of a photocatalyst and to enhance the absorption in the near infrared region of solar irradiation, we combined an up-conversion component NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+, a visible light semiconductor CdS and good conductive carbon materials, RGO and CNTs, to form a cooperative assembly catalyst to achieve photocatalytic water splitting. RGO and CNTs were selected to be conductive supports and the performances for water splitting of the combined catalysts were compared under 980 nm NIR light irradiation. The results indicated that only RGO had a significant promotion effect on photocatalytic water splitting activity due to its special 2D structure.
Experimental
Synthesis of CdS and RGO
The CdS sample was synthesized via a precipitation method. Typically, 3.70 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water and stirred vigorously for 1 h, 6.68 g of Na2S·9H2O was dissolved in another 80 mL of deionized water to obtain Na2S solution by ultrasonication. Then the Na2S solution was slowly added to the Cd(NO3)2 solution drop-by-drop under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 3 h, the solution was kept overnight at room temperature, then the obtained yellow precipitate was filtrated, washed with deionized water several times, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the products were collected and ground into powder with an agate mortar.
Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared from natural graphite using a modified Hummers method similar to that used in our previous reports.53,54 Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was synthesized through the method of reducing graphene oxide by hydrazine hydrate. Briefly, 250 mg of GO powder was exfoliated in 400 mL of water with ultrasonication for 1 h and then the pH value of the resulting homogeneous dispersion was adjusted to 10 by adding an appropriate amount of ammonia solution. After that, the mixture was heated to 95 °C for 2 h in an oil bath under stirring, and 750 μL of N2H4·H2O (85 wt%) was added to react at this temperature. Then the solution was aged for 12 h, during which the colour of the solution changed from yellow-brown to dark, indicating the completion of the reduction reaction. The obtained RGO was dispersed into a 250 mL volumetric flask and the concentration was 0.3 mg mL−1.
Synthesis of NaYF4-Yb3+/Er3+, CdS/RGO/NYFYE and CdS/CNT/NYFYE
NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was synthesized via a modified one-step solvothermal method.55 Briefly, 1.41 mmol of Y(NO3)3·6H2O, 0.16 mmol of Yb(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.032 mmol of Er(NO3)3·5H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and named solution A. 14.4 mmol of NaF was added to another 20 mL of deionized water forming solution B. Solutions A and B were heated to 60 °C, and then B was added to A drop-by-drop under stirring. The obtained mixture was continuously stirred at 60 °C for another 1 h. The final solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C overnight.
For synthesis of CdS/NYFYE, another portion of solution C was prepared by dispersing 0.2 g of CdS in 20 mL of water and stirring for 1 h. A and B were added in order into solution C dropwise under stirring; 0.5 h of stirring time was needed before adding B. The mixture was continuously stirred for another 1 h and all the operations were carried out at a temperature of 60 °C in a water bath. The subsequent hydrothermal steps were similar to the procedure described above. For preparation of CdS/NYFYE, the percentage of NYFYE was 40 wt%. For synthesis of CdS/RGO/NYFYE, solution C was prepared by dispersing 0.2 g of CdS and different amounts of RGO (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mg, where the corresponding percentages were 0.9 wt%, 1.8 wt%, 2.7 wt%, 3.6 wt% and 4.5 wt%) in 20 mL of water and stirring for 1 h. The subsequent hydrothermal steps were carried out accordingly.
CdS/CNT/NYFYE was synthesised through the same method by replacing RGO with CNTs, and the CNTs were purchased from XFNano. As a comparison, the proportion of CNTs was just the same as the optimal amount of RGO (2.7 wt%).
Synthesis of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE, Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE, CdS/Pt and NYFYE/Pt
Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE was prepared by a typical hydrazine hydrate reduction method. 0.20 g of as-prepared CdS/RGO/NYFYE sample with a calculated amount of K2PtCl6 solution (where the weight ratio of Pt to CdS/RGO/NYFYE was 2 wt%) was stirred for half an hour, then hydrazine hydrate was added to the solution. When the reduction was finished, the products were filtrated, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C to obtain the Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst. The same method was used to synthesize Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE, CdS/Pt and NYFYE/Pt.
Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a sealed Pyrex flask (188 mL), which had a flat window with an irradiation area of about 14 cm2 at room temperature. In a typical reaction, 50 mg of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE was dispersed in 138 mL of distilled water in a sealed Pyrex flask. The mixture was ultrasonically treated for 30 min before bubbling in Ar gas to degas for 30 min. Subsequently the reactor was irradiated under 420 nm, 980 nm and NIR light. During the reduction process, the gas composition and content in the sealed Pyrex flask were monitored by gas chromatography (Agilent 6820, TCD, 13× column, Ar carrier). The light source was a 300-W xenon lamp with a denoted cut-off filter and a 3-W 980 nm laser (NBET-980-3).
Isotope tracer experiments
In order to demonstrate the overall water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously over a Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst, isotope tracer experiments were carried out. The experimental steps in the method described above were followed, except the distilled water was changed to D2O (CAS: 7789-20-0, the purity of D was 99.9 atom%) or H218O (CAS:14314-42-2, the purity of 18O was 90 atom%) for the detection of D2 and 18O2. The formed D2 and 18O2 were measured by GC-MS (TILON-LC-D200M).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
All the photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660E) in a homemade standard three-electrode cell, consisting of an organic glass enclosure with a quartz window and a 1.2 cm diameter opening opposite the window to the clamped work electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by dropping the catalyst sample directly onto the surface of precleaned indium tin oxide glass (ITO glass). The area of the working electrode exposed to the electrolyte was about 1 cm2. Platinum foil was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The current–time curve was obtained under unbiased conditions to investigate the anodic photocurrent. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The excitation source was a 300-W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter, and NIR light bandpass filters. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution.

Characterization of the catalysts
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku B/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtrated Cu Kα radiation, specifically using a position sensitive detector at a step time of 15 s at 40 mA and 40 kV, scan step 0.017°, and a 2θ range of 5–90°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted with a VG Scientific ESCALAB210-XPS photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and HRTEM images were obtained using a Tecnai-G2-F30 field emission transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-6701F cold-field emission scanning electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV. The fluorescence spectra were measured using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 970 nm. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained with a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer in which BaSO4 powder was used as the internal standard to obtain the optical properties of the samples. The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 spectrophotometer. The Raman spectra were taken from a LabRAM HR Evolution microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer.
Results and discussion
A simplified synthesis scheme of the CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalyst is shown in Fig. 1. RGO was synthesized through the method of reducing graphene oxide (GO) by hydrazine hydrate. Then it was mixed with CdS by magnetic stirring to form a CdS/RGO mixture. Finally, CdS/RGO/NYFYE was synthesized through a modified hydrothermal method with NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+. CdS/CNT/NYFYE was synthesized through a similar method by replacing RGO with CNTs. The structures of the CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalysts were exposed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Comparing the results in Fig. 2(a)–(d), it is clear that small CdS particles are anchored on the surface of NYFYE, and both are attached to the RGO. The HRTEM in Fig. 2(e) shows the lattice structure of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE, where an interlayer spacing of 0.336 nm can be ascribed to the (111) plane of cubic CdS. The interlayer spacing of 0.228 nm belongs to the (111) plane of Pt nanoparticles. The interlayer spacing of 0.275 nm is assigned to the (200) plane of NYFYE. The element mapping of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE in Fig. 2(f) illustrates that all the elements are distributed homogeneously. The 2D structured RGO sheets may promote the transfer of the photoexcited charges.56,57 The morphology of the CdS/CNT/NYFYE catalysts was also studied by SEM and TEM (see Fig. 3). The CdS and NYFYE are interspersed in a disorderly manner on the CNTs (Fig. 3a–c). And unlike 2D RGO, the 1D CNTs, with diameters of 10–50 nm, had less support area to bear the CdS and NYFYE than the huge net-like RGO.

To measure the electron transport properties of the pristine Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE, Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE, Pt/CdS/NYFYE, and Pt/CdS, 80 mg of each sample were compressed into a capsule with a diameter of 1 cm at a pressure of 400 MPa for 10 s. I–V curves of the capsules were tested using the two-probe method on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system at room temperature in air. Only samples of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE and Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE could be used to test the current data under voltages from −2 to 2 V (see Fig. 4(a)), and catalysts with RGO had better conductivity than those with CNTs, implying that RGO effectively increases the conductivity of the catalyst. Moreover, Nyquist plots of the Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE, Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE and Pt/CdS/NYFYE electrodes were also tested and are shown in Fig. 4(b). A semicircle at high-to-medium frequency and a straight sloping line at low frequency can be observed in Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE and Pt/CdS/NYFYE. The semicircle represents charge-transfer resistance, whereas the straight sloping line is associated with diffusion resistance through the bulk of the active material. An arc at high to medium frequency and low frequency can be observed in Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE, resulting from the dispersion effect. Obviously, Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE presents the smallest charge-transfer resistance, which is attributed to the higher electronic conductivity of RGO and the synergism between RGO and NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+. Therefore, the catalysts with RGO have a better electron transport property and lower charge-transfer resistance, both of which are beneficial to hydrogen evolution.

Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetimes of CdS, CdS/NYFYE, CdS/CNT/NYFYE and CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalysts were also investigated and are shown in Table 1. They were obtained by fitting the decay profiles with two exponential terms. The average charge lifetimes in the presence of NaYF4-Yb3+/Er3+ increased remarkably. The lifetime of the photoexcited charges over the Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalyst becomes longer than over Pt/CdS/NYFYE, which is evidence for the higher electronic conductivity of RGO. But the Pt/CdS/CNT/NYFYE photocatalyst has a noticeably shorter lifetime (3.759 ns).

The presence of RGO more effectively improves the conductivity of the catalyst and the up-conversion performance of NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+. The cubic crystal structure (Fmm, Z = 4) of NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ is shown in Fig. 5(a); the cation sites are equal and the Na and Y atoms locate in the cationic sublattice,38 and Y3+ can be replaced in any ratio by rare-earth ions (Yb3+/Er3+) for green or blue UC phosphors.58 As an up-conversion component, under an excitation of 980 nm, NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ can emit visible light owing its up-conversion properties due to Er3+ and Yb3+ codopants, which promote the energy transfer process.59 As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), an Yb3+ ion with a single energy level structure (2F5/2 → 2F7/2), as a sensitizer, exhibits strong absorption of NIR light (980 nm) and transfers energy to activate an Er3+ ion via a multiphoton process and generates an efficient up-conversion luminescence. The Er3+ ion, as an activator, can emit an output photon and achieve energy up-conversion.60 Here, the Yb3+ ion is pumped to its 2F5/2 multiple state after absorbing the NIR light by an ETU process (shown by the dashed lines).35,39

The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were studied by UV-visible-NIR absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. According to the results shown in Fig. 6(a), NYFYE exhibits absorption around 975 nm. The combined catalysts (CdS/NYFYE, CdS/RGO/NYFYE) also show NIR absorption in the NIR region and exhibit a better light response in the visible-NIR region than CdS itself. Under an excitation of 980 nm light, blue (peak at 437.6, 449.7 nm) and green (peak at 507.8, 529.8 nm) emissions from NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ were observed (Fig. 6(b)). The green light emission is attributed to excitation routes from the excited states 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 to the ground state 4I15/2 of Er3+ under 980 nm irradiation, and the blue emission belongs to the excitation route from 2H9/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ (as illustrated in Fig. 6(b)). Otherwise, the green emission is higher than the blue emission according to the photons of NYFYE and Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE over 980 nm laser irradiation, from which we can mainly see green light (Fig. 6(b) (I) and (II)). The obvious green light indicates that NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ successfully up-converts NIR light to visible light, which can be further adsorbed by CdS for photocatalytic water splitting.

Photocatalytic overall water splitting activities of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE were evaluated under both NIR and visible light irradiation. CdS/Pt itself cannot generate hydrogen under NIR light irradiation, but Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE generates a significant amount of hydrogen under 980 nm laser irradiation (4.54 μmol g−1 h−1, in Fig. 7(a)), which is 1.3 times higher than that of a Pt/CdS/NYFYE catalyst (3.38 μmol g−1 h−1), indicating that the promoted hydrogen evolution activity over Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE under NIR light is due to RGO's excellent carrier mobility and high specific surface area.61,62 The activity and stability of those combined photocatalysts have been also evaluated under λ ≥ 420 nm light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7(b). Pt/CdS, Pt/CdS/RGO, Pt/CdS/NYFYE and Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE appear to have an increasing hydrogen evolution rate. Due to the excellent electronic mobility of RGO, it improves the separation of electrons and holes effectively in a Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalyst, leading to better charge separation, charge transfer and performance of the Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalyst. In addition, XPS results indicate that the strong interaction between CdS and NYFYE gives rise to an enhancement in charge transfer between CdS and NYFYE, which is supported by the blue shift of Y 3d5/2 and Na 1s and the red shift of S 2p1/2 (Fig. 14b and c). Both the excellent conductivity of RGO and the strong interaction between CdS and NYFYE mean the catalyst exhibits better activity and stability in the reaction (Fig. 7d). Under optimized experimental conditions, the highest H2 evolution rate of 154.76 μmol g−1 h−1 is obtained over a Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst with 40 wt% NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+, 2.7 wt% RGO and 2 wt% Pt (Fig.7(c)).

All photocatalytic performance experiments were carried out in pure water without the addition of any sacrificial reagent. In order to confirm that overall water splitting was achieved over a Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst, isotope tracer experiments were conducted. In the results shown in Fig. 8, D2 and 18O2 are detected when D2O and H218O are used as reactants, respectively.63,64

The chemical states of the catalysts were further investigated by Raman and XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 9 shows the Raman spectra of CdS/RGO/NYFYE, RGO, CdS and CdS/NYFYE. The Raman spectra of RGO showed peaks at 1348 and 1592 cm−1, which were typical D and G bands of RGO.65–68 No significant difference in D and G bands between CdS/RGO/NYFYE and RGO samples was observed. CdS/RGO/NYFYE, CdS and CdS/NYFYE catalysts also showed the typical peaks of CdS at 295 and 593 cm−1. For the CdS/RGO/NYFYE sample (Fig. 10), the main peak at 284.8 eV is assigned to sp2-hybridized graphite-like carbon (C–C sp2), and the peaks centered at 286.5/286.8 and 288.7 eV are ascribed to surface oxygen groups (designated as CO and O–CO, respectively).69,70 The position and intensity of the peaks of C1s in CdS/RGO/NYFYE are similar before and after 15 h of reaction, which is consistent with the Raman results.

The crystal structures and the chemical states of the surface species of CdS, NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+, and Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalysts were also characterized by XRD and XPS techniques. The XRD spectra (Fig. 11) show the typical peaks of cubic CdS (JCPDS #80-0019)71 and cubic NaYF4 (JCPDS #77-2042)39 in the CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst. The peaks located at 26.6, 43.9 and 52.0° correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) crystal planes of CdS, and the peaks at 28.2, 47.1 and 55.7° belong to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (3 1 1) crystal planes of NaYF4. The characteristic peaks of CdS and NaYF4 are similar before and after reaction, demonstrating that the CdS/RGO/NYFYE remains stable during the reaction.

Er and Yb binding energies are shown in Fig. 12a and b, and are identical to the reference data.72,73 Pt is in the metallic state (Fig. 12(c)) and Pt particles expose the high-energy (111) planes in Pt/CdS/NYFYE (Fig. 2(e)). The shifts of Y 3d5/2 and Na 1 s to the high-energy side and of S 2p1/2 to the low-energy side indicate a strong interaction between CdS and NYFYE (Fig. 13b and c), which means a charge density transfer from Na+/Y3+ to S2−, and that the interaction is beneficial in the hole transfer from CdS to NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+. As a result, the photocorrosion of CdS is weakened to some degree and the stability of the Pt/CdS/NYFYE catalyst improves (Fig. 7b). CdS is dispersed uniformly on the surface of NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ (Fig. 2a, b and d). It should be noted that the binding energy of S 2p is close to that of Y 3d, so one can find Y 3d5/2 (159.5 eV) in the S 2p XPS spectra or S 2p1/2 (162.4 eV of PCRN) in the Y 3d XPS spectra. After multiple cycles of photocatalytic experiments (Fig. S1 and S2†), there is no obvious variation in the chemical states of Na, Yb or Pt in the Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE catalyst, although slight binding energy shifts of Cd, S and Er are observed.

The transient photocurrent and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE were further analysed, and the results are shown in Fig. 14a and b. Both CdS/Pt and Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE show an obvious photocurrent under 420 nm light irradiation, but only Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE exhibits a photocurrent under NIR light irradiation, which confirms that incident NIR light is up-converted to visible light by NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ to yield visible light, which is used by CdS to generate electrons and holes. In addition, the LSV tests (Fig. 14(c)) show that Pt/CdS/RGO/NYFYE exhibits the lowest hydrogen evolution potential.

The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. 
Based on the above experiments, characterizations and analysis, the whole reaction process of photocatalytic overall water splitting over a CdS/RGO/NYFYE photocatalyst can be expressed as in Scheme 1. By taking advantage of NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ up-conversion characteristics, NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ captures NIR photons and up-converts NIR into visible light to excite CdS to form electrons and holes. Then the excited electrons transfer to the Pt nanoparticle surface and participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The large network-like RGO decreases the probability of electron and hole recombination. The inner electric field between CdS and NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ forces the holes to transfer to NaYF4–Yb3+/Er3+ and reduces the photocorrosion of CdS. Due to the better conductivity, CdS/RGO/NYFYE showed much better performance for water splitting to hydrogen than CdS/CNT/NYFYE under NIR illumination (980 nm).

Conclusions
In summary, overall water splitting under 980 nm NIR light irradiation has been successfully achieved over a combined CdS/RGO/NaYF4-Yb3+/Er3+ multi-component photocatalyst. RGO and CN were selected and the performances for water splitting of the combined catalysts were compared. The results indicated that only RGO presents a significant promotion effect on the photocatalytic water splitting activity due to its good conductivity on its huge net-like 2D structure. A highest hydrogen evolution rate of 4.54 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved under 980 nm NIR irradiation. The corresponding 980 nm laser energy-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (LTH) was 0.011%. This work will inspire a study into utilizing visible-responsive materials to realize overall water splitting by NIR light irradiation.
