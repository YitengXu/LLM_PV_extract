    , Accepted 5th October 2016First published on 6th October 2016AbstractHighly crystalline and idiomorphic CoTiO3 single crystals with a well-defined polyhedral morphology were grown successfully for the first time by a facile flux method. Herein, the effects of the molten salt type and cobalt precursor on the phase composition, crystallization habit and morphology of the CoTiO3 products were also investigated. Importantly, using the flux-grown CoTiO3 crystal as the visible-light sensitizer due to its narrow band gap to couple with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a direct in situ thermal induced polycondensation route, novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were obtained. The as-synthesized samples were systematically characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM, SAED, HRTEM, FT-IR, XPS, DRS and PL techniques. The results revealed that CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals were closely combined with g-C3N4 nanosheets leading to the formation of a heterojunction structure at the interface between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4. Photocatalytic evaluation showed that the heterostructured CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation than that of individual CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, which could be mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, including the enhanced visible-light harvesting ability and more efficient separation and longer lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the composite photocatalyst showed an excellent stability and reusability during four successive cycles. Finally, a possible mechanism responsible for the charge separation and improved photocatalytic activity was proposed.
1 Introduction
Cobalt titanate (CoTiO3), as a classical ilmenite-type oxide with the corundum-type structure of A2O3 sesquioxides, has been studied extensively owing to its potential applications such as in pigments,1 catalysts,2,3 sensors,4,5 magnetic recorders,6 high-k gate dielectric ceramics,7 adsorbents,8 and even lithium-ion batteries.9 In particular, in recent years, CoTiO3 has received enormous attention in the fields of photocatalysis and photochemistry because of its narrow band gap (∼2.25 eV), suitable electronic band structure, strong visible-light absorption and high stability.10–13 Nevertheless, the low activity caused by the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs prevents the practical application of pure CoTiO3 as an alternative visible-light-driven photocatalyst.14 To overcome such a problem, coupling CoTiO3 with other semiconductors with suitable band edges to construct composite photocatalysts has been carried out, such as the CoTiO3/Ag3VO4 composite, in which the heterostructure was formed leading to an efficient charge separation and thus improved photocatalytic performance.11,12 Unfortunately, so far research focusing on the construction of novel heterostructured composites for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CoTiO3 is still limited. What's more, the common synthetic methods for CoTiO3 including solid-state reaction,15 thermal decomposition,7 modified Pechini,16 sol–gel process,5,17 polyol method18 and co-precipitation,19 always suffer from the need for high-temperature treatment, low efficiency, complex process and inhomogeneous products with abnormal grain growth, agglomerates and poorly defined morphologies. Therefore, developing simple, efficient and cost-effective approaches for the large-scale synthesis of high-quality CoTiO3 and further improving its photocatalytic activity for practical applications remain a great challenge.
The molten salt method, a well-developed and attractive technique, has been proved to be effective in the preparation of idiomorphic crystals with both high crystallinity and well-defined geometrical shapes from the molten fluxes.20–22 Herein, on the one hand, the high crystallinity can increase photocatalytic activity since a low crystallinity and high density of defects will accelerate the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.23,24 On the other hand, the flux-grown semiconductor crystals enclosed by well-developed faceted surfaces can be better supported by the cocatalysts to construct heterostructures,25 thus enhancing their photocatalytic performance. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based heterostructured composites have attracted intense interest for their improved visible-light photocatalytic properties for hydrogen generation, pollutant degradation and carbon dioxide reduction.26 According to the previous reports,10,27 it is obvious that the band edges of CoTiO3 (ECB ∼ 0.11 eV, EVB ∼ 2.39 eV) are well-matched with that of g-C3N4 (ECB ∼ −1.13 eV, EVB ∼ 1.57 eV), indicating a feasible construction of CoTiO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has been focused on the flux growth of high-quality CoTiO3 crystals and the fabrication of novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity.
In this work, well-dispersed CoTiO3 single crystals with a well-defined polyhedral morphology were successfully grown by a facile flux method. Using the CoTiO3 sample as a visible-light sensitizer, the novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were also obtained via the in situ calcination treatment of the mixture of CoTiO3 crystals and melamine powders. The as-synthesized samples were systematically investigated by various characterization techniques including XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM, SAED, HRTEM, FT-IR, DRS and PL. The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by the degradation of MO under visible light irradiation. It was found that the composite photocatalysts exhibited not only an improved photocatalytic activity but also excellent stability and reusability during the photocatalytic process, which can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
All reagents used in this work were analytical grade and were used without further purification. Various cobaltates including cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt monosulfate heptahydrate (CoSO4·7H2O) and chloride salts including lithium chloride (LiCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), melamine (C3H3N6) and methyl orange (MO) were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Titanium dioxide (TiO2, P25) was supplied by Evonik Degussa Corporation (Germany). Deionized water was utilized in all experiments.
2.1 Synthesis of CoTiO3 crystals
In a typical synthesis, a stoichiometric powder mixture of TiO2 and Co(NO3)2·6H2O was mixed homogeneously with NaCl–KCl eutectic salts in a molar ratio of 1:25. The resulting powders were transferred into an 80 cm3 corundum crucible sealed loosely with a lid and placed in an electric furnace. Subsequently, the crucible was subjected to heat treatment at 820 °C in air for 2 h and then cooled down naturally to room temperature in the furnace. In order to remove the residual chloride salts, the products were repeatedly washed with deionized water and separated by using filter paper (Whatman No. 42). The obtained green powders were finally dried at 80 °C overnight. To investigate the effects of the molten salt type on the crystallization habit and morphology of the CoTiO3 products, various samples were also obtained from molten LiCl, NaCl, KCl and CoCl2. Here, a heating temperature of 820 °C is sufficient for the flux growth of CoTiO3 crystals using these salts due to their lower melting points (namely, 610 °C, 801 °C, 771 °C and 726 °C, respectively). At the same time, the effects of different cobalt precursors (including Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, CoSO4·7H2O and CoCl2·6H2O) on the formation of CoTiO3 crystals were also studied.
2.3 Preparation of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites
The construction of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites was achieved by an in situ calcination method, that is, a thermal treatment of the homogeneous mixture consisting of flux-grown CoTiO3 crystals and melamine powders. Typically, a specific amount of melamine and the flux-grown CoTiO3 with different mass contents (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 wt%) were dispersed in 100 ml water by ultrasonication for 1 h and further stirred for about 12 h at room temperature. Then, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 10 min) and dried at 80 °C in an oven overnight. The obtained mixture was transferred into a semi-closed alumina crucible, followed by calcining at 520 °C for 4 h in an electric furnace for the formation of the g-C3N4 phase and close interfacial connections between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4. The as-prepared CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite samples with various CoTiO3 contents of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 wt% were designated as CTO/CN-0.1, CTO/CN-0.5, CTO/CN-1.0 and CTO/CN-3.0, respectively. As a reference, pure g-C3N4 powders were also obtained without the addition of CoTiO3 under the same conditions.
2.4 Characterization
The crystalline phases of the as-synthesized samples were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a diffractometer (Rigaku, D/MAX 2550 VB/PC) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 2θ = 10–80°. The chemical composition was analyzed by an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, EDAX, Genesis XM2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-3400N) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100) were utilized to characterize the morphologies and microstructures of the samples. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image were also recorded on a JEM-2100 microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer using KBr pellets in the region of 400 to 4000 cm−1. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument (Thermo Scientific) using Al Kα radiation. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DSC) were recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary 500) equipped with an integrating sphere accessory, and BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured at room temperature on a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, RF-5301PC) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm.
2.5 Photocatalytic evaluation
The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized samples was evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing) with a 400 nm cutoff filter. A suspension containing 70 mg photocatalyst and 70 mL of aqueous methyl orange solution with an initial concentration of 10 mg L−1 was placed in a self-designed quartz reactor maintained at room temperature by circulating water. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was ultrasonicated for 5 min and magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 h to reach absorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and MO solution. At specific time intervals, about 5 ml suspension was taken with a 0.22 μm syringe filter unit (Millipore) and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst powders. Then, the variations of the characteristic absorption of the MO filtrates at λ = 465 nm were monitored by the Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer to evaluate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Controllable synthesis of the single-crystalline CoTiO3 polyhedral particles
As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, XRD patterns combined with the SEM images of the as-synthesized samples reveal that molten salt systems have a significant effect on the crystal phase composition and morphology of the products. It is obvious that the sample obtained from the molten CoCl2 flux consists of two cubic phases, i.e., Co3O4 (ICDD PDF 43-1003) and Co2TiO4 (ICDD PDF 39-1410), while pure spinel LiCoTiO4 (ICDD PDF 38-0182) crystals with regular octahedron-like geometrical shapes (as shown in Fig. 2a) are grown from the LiCl flux. When NaCl is used as the molten salt medium, a low amount of the rhombohedral phase of CoTiO3 (ICDD PDF 15-0866) was obtained, but it could hardly be separated from the major crystalline phase Co2TiO4 (as shown in Fig. 2b). By comparison, the KCl flux-grown sample was mainly composed of a large amount of CoTiO3 and co-existed with the secondary phase, namely, tetragonal potassium hollandite KTi8O16.5 (ICDD PDF 41-1098) with the space group 14/m(87). It is worth noting that the KTi8O16.5 crystals inserted in the piles of CoTiO3 particles exhibit well-formed rectangular tubular shapes, as shown in Fig. 2c. A more detailed analysis is available in Fig. S1.† According to the previous reports, KTi8O16.5 nanowires could be prepared by the reaction of TiO2 nanoparticles with the KCl flux at 1027 K in the presence of a key nonionic surfactant NP-9.28,29 Hence, it can be easily concluded that the precursor cobalt nitrate hexahydrate plays an important role in the formation of one-dimensional tubular KTi8O16.5 crystals, which provides a new reference for the synthesis of high-quality hollandites with special morphologies for wide industrial applications.

Specifically, when it comes to the sample (labeled as CTO-1) synthesized from the eutectic NaCl–KCl flux, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the rhombohedral phase of CoTiO3 (ICDD PDF 15-0866) with a space group of R(148) and lattice parameters a = 5.068 Å, b = 5.068 Å, c = 13.922 Å, 90° × 90° × 120°. As a derivative of the corundum structure, the ilmenite structure is known to be based on hexagonal closest packed oxygen layers with the cations occupying two-thirds of octahedral sites. In the case of ilmenite CoTiO3, divalent Co2+ and tetravalent Ti4+ ions are present in an octahedral coordination with the alternating layers occupied by Co2+ and Ti4+ alone, as shown in Fig. 3.15,16 Moreover, it can be seen that the strong diffraction peaks corresponding to the (104), (110), (024) and (116) planes belonging to different facets (i.e., {104}, {110}, {012}, {116}), indicate that the ilmenite CoTiO3 crystals may grow along various crystallographic directions and end up with anisotropic and polyhedral shapes, which can be confirmed by the observations in the corresponding SEM images (Fig. 2d and S2†) that the well-dispersed CoTiO3 crystals with an average size of about 500 nm exhibit a well-defined polyhedral morphology and smooth surfaces.

Therefore, such a comparative study on using different molten salt fluxes for the synthesis of ilmenite CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals suggests that the eutectic NaCl–KCl flux has a better crystal growth ability than other aforementioned chloride flux, which can be ascribed to its unique physicochemical properties, such as a lower melting point, higher solubility of the CoTiO3 phase and higher stability.
In consideration of the earlier reports that the precursors always have a significant influence on the molten salt synthesis of crystalline titanates,30,31 the possible effects of the cobalt precursor on the formation of CoTiO3 crystals were further investigated, which will be beneficial for achieving a controllable synthesis of the CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals. It should be noted here that Co(NO3)2·6H2O has been confirmed as a feasible cobalt precursor in terms of the former study. As shown in Fig. 4, the precursors of both CoCl2·6H2O and CoSO4·7H2O cannot result in a pure CoTiO3 phase but a mixture of rutile and CoTiO3, while Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O can be used as an effective cobalt precursor although the obtained CoTiO3 sample (labeled as CTO-2) contains minor phase impurities due to Co3O4. Then, a typical SEM image of the sample CTO-2 in Fig. 5a reveals clearly that the products have an aggregated nature of small particles with typical dimensions of 200–500 nm and undefined edges and corners. Compared with CTO-2, the sample CTO-1 exhibits a larger particle size and well-developed polyhedral morphology, as shown in Fig. 5b (same with Fig. 2d), suggesting an improvement of grain growth and crystallinity, which is also in good agreement with the higher intensities of its diffraction peaks in Fig. 4. In this regard, therefore, Co(NO3)2·6H2O is the optimum cobalt precursor in the flux growth of well-defined CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals.

 Fig. 5  SEM images of the samples CTO-2 (a) and CTO-1 (b). 
The morphology and structure of sample CTO-1 were further determined by TEM and SAED. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, the particle size of the CoTiO3 crystals is estimated to be in the range of approximately 300–600 nm, in accord with the SEM results. Moreover, the particles can be mainly defined as having obtuse rhombohedral shapes based on their clear edges and corners. Besides, the hexagonal particles shown in Fig. 6a and b may also correspond to some octahedral CoTiO3 crystals, as shown in Fig. S3.† Taking into account that no typical rhombohedra CoTiO3 crystals are found in the corresponding SEM images, it is conceivable that the obtained polyhedral morphology of CoTiO3 would be due to the truncated rhombohedrons. Furthermore, the well-developed faceted surfaces of the CoTiO3 polyhedral particles may be attributed to the unconstrained crystal growth, in other words, the crystals can grow in the solution without mechanical or thermal constraints and thus develop facets,25,32 but a more detailed investigation on the growth mechanism of CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals is still needed. In Fig. 6d, the SAED pattern is assigned to the [2–21] zone-axis diffraction spots of rhombohedral CoTiO3, which further indicates the single-crystalline nature of the flux-grown CoTiO3 polyhedral particles. Therefore, we can conclude from the above results that, CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals with well-developed surfaces have been successfully grown from the eutectic NaCl–KCl flux with Co(NO3)2·6H2O and TiO2 as cobalt and titanium sources, respectively, which is expected to support the construction of novel heterostructured CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites with enhanced photocatalytic activity.

3.2 Characterization of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite samples
As shown in Fig. 7, XRD was used to characterize the crystalline phase and composition of pristine g-C3N4 and the various CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite samples. The pristine g-C3N4 sample exhibits two characteristic diffraction peaks at 13.05° and 27.42° corresponding to the (100) and (002) planes, which is due to the interplanar structural packing motif and characteristic interlayer stacking peak of aromatic systems, respectively.33,34 As for the composites, the intensities of the main diffraction peaks for ilmenite CoTiO3 increase dramatically with the increasing CoTiO3 mass content at the expense of g-C3N4 peaks, suggesting a coexistence of both CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 phases and the overwhelming high crystallinity of CoTiO3 relative to g-C3N4. Additionally, such an obvious decrease of the peak intensity of g-C3N4 in the composites indicates that the hybridization process probably has an inhibiting effect on the thermal polycondensation of melamine (the g-C3N4 precursor), i.e., the crystallization of g-C3N4 products.
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of the pristine g-C3N4 (a), CTO/CN-0.1 (b), CTO/CN-0.5 (c), CTO/CN-1.0 (d) and CTO/CN-3.0 (e). 
The morphology and microstructure of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite samples were investigated by SEM, TEM and HRTEM as well as EDS analysis, as shown in Fig. 8. For comparison, the images of pure g-C3N4 were also provided. It can be seen in Fig. 8a that pure g-C3N4 exhibits a typical aggregated sheet-like morphology with a clean surface, and its TEM image (Fig. 8e) further shows a wrinkled lamellar structure. After introducing CoTiO3, as shown in the SEM images of CTO/CN-1.0 (Fig. 8b and c), the CoTiO3 crystals with clear edges and characteristic sizes corresponding to that in Fig. 2d, were found to be anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 and even inserted into the bulks, as confirmed by the EDS analysis (Fig. 8d), which can result in a close interaction between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4. Simultaneously, the TEM images show that the CoTiO3 crystal is indeed firmly attached to the g-C3N4 sheets (Fig. 8f), and especially, the CoTiO3 crystals peeled off from the composites by a long-time ultrasonication treatment are still wrapped by the thin g-C3N4 layer (Fig. 8g and h), suggesting that the interfacial connection between g-C3N4 and CoTiO3 is relatively strong. At the interface of the CoTiO3 particle and g-C3N4 layer, the HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 8h) clearly shows that CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 closely combine with each other, leading to a smooth and intimate interface being formed along their boundaries. The clear crystal lattice fringe with a spacing of about 0.272 nm corresponds to the (104) crystallographic plane of rhombohedral CoTiO3 (ICDD PDF 15-0866), which is also consistent with the XRD result shown in Fig. 1. Although the lattice fringe of g-C3N4 is hard to find, the light area can be identified as the g-C3N4 phase because the electron beam can pass through g-C3N4 more easily due to its thin sheet-like structures and low atomic weight.35 Based on the above results, it is suggested that novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction structures have been constructed via the in situ growth method. Generally, these intimate interfaces in the heterostructures will provide convenient and fast migration channels for photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalytic reactions, which efficiently inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus remarkably enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

The presence of Au peaks in the EDS spectrum originates from the sample preparation for SEM analysis. 
As shown in Fig. 9, the chemical structure and functional groups of the as-synthesized samples were further studied by FT-IR spectra. In the case of pure CoTiO3, weak peaks at 3200–3600 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 correspond to the O–H stretching of the physically absorbed H2O on the surface of CoTiO3 and the O–H bending vibration of water molecules, respectively.16,36 The strong bands around 400–800 cm−1 are attributed to the Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti stretching vibrations, and the band appearing at 1090 cm−1 is associated with the Co–O group linked to Ti, which reveals the formation of CoTiO3.8,15 Pure g-C3N4 shows three typical bands, namely, the characteristic peak at 808 cm−1, a strong band at 1240–1640 cm−1 and a broad peak at 2800–3640 cm−1, which can be assigned to the breathing mode of triazine units, stretching modes of C–N and CN heterocycles and the N–H and O–H stretching vibration modes, respectively.34,36,37 As for the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites, in comparison with pure g-C3N4, an obvious change of the band below 800 cm−1 is considered to be derived from the strong vibrational absorption of CoTiO3 at 400–800 nm, further revealing the coexistence of CoTiO3 and g-C3N4. Furthermore, the disappearance of the slight shoulder at about 3350 cm−1 can be ascribed to some chemical bonding between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, which implies the formation of CoTiO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures.

The surface chemical composition and chemical states of pristine CoTiO3 (CTO-1), g-C3N4, and the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite (CTO/CN-1.0) were also analyzed by XPS measurements. From the survey scan XPS spectra shown in Fig. 10a, the sample CTO/CN-1.0 is composed of CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, as revealed by the typical peaks of C 1s, N 1s, Co 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s, which is also consistent with its chemical composition. Fig. 10b–f show the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Co 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s in order to study the interaction between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4.

As shown in Fig. 10b, the C 1s peak centered at 284.5 eV for all the samples is associated with the surface adventitious reference carbon, and another strong C 1s peak for g-C3N4 and CTO/CN-1.0 at 288.0 eV can be attributed to the sp2-bonded carbon of N–CN groups in g-C3N4.38 In Fig. 10c, the N 1s peak for g-C3N4 at 398.4 eV corresponds to sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CN–C), while the N 1s peak for CTO/CN-1.0 shifts to 398.6 eV due to the introduction of CoTiO3 into g-C3N4. In the high resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s, the weak peaks can arise from the low content of CoTiO3 in the composite sample. As shown in Fig. 10d–f, as for CoTiO3, the peaks at 780.1 eV and 796.2 eV are indicative of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 states respectively, suggesting the presence of Co2+.3 The peaks with binding energies at 458.1 eV and 463.9 eV are characteristic of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states respectively, matching well with the published data for Ti4+ of CoTiO3.17 Meanwhile, two O 1s peaks at 529.5 eV and 532.4 eV can be due to the crystal lattice oxygen in CoTiO3 and chemisorbed water molecules or surface hydroxyl groups, respectively.39 Notably, a slight positive shift happens on the Co 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra of CTO/CN-1.0 compared with that of pure CoTiO3, which can confirm that the CoTiO3 phase is well sustained in the composite and also indicates that certain chemical interactions are possibly formed between tightly contacted phases of CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, as observed in the TEM images.
To investigate the optical absorption and band gap structure of the as-synthesized samples, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 11, the pure CoTiO3 sample exhibits intense absorption bands from the UV light region to visible light region even extending to the near infrared region. The broad absorption band in the range of 280–500 nm (with the absorption edge located at about 532 nm) can be assigned to the metal–ligand charge-transfer transition, namely, O2− → Ti4+. Other characteristic absorption bands centered at around 538 and 607 nm are associated with the Co2+ → Ti4+ charge transfer interaction, owing to the crystal field splitting of CoTiO3.1,10,16 Then, pristine g-C3N4 showed photoabsorption from UV light to visible light with a characteristic absorption edge of 463 nm, which is attributed to the band gap transition of electrons from the valence band consisting of the N 2p orbitals to the conduction band populated mainly by C 2p orbitals.33,40 After the introduction of CoTiO3 into g-C3N4, the composite samples exhibit stronger optical absorption in the region of 500–800 nm with the maximum value at approximately 607 nm (due to the d–d transition of the Co2+ ion in CoTiO3), and with the increasing of the CoTiO3 content, the absorption intensities of these composite samples are strengthened stepwise and a slight red shift of their absorption edges is also found. It well demonstrates that the flux-grown CoTiO3 crystal can act as a sensitizer for enhancing the visible light absorption of g-C3N4 sheets, suggesting that the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite can harvest more light energy and produce more photogenerated charge carriers. Note that such an increased optical absorption is consistent with the distinct color change of the samples (inset in Fig. 11), which reveals that the flux-grown CoTiO3 powder is a potential inorganic pigment with good color property, in consideration of its low content in the composite system. Furthermore, these observations can be associated with the intimate interfacial interactions between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 in the composites, which are essential for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and thus an improved photocatalytic performance.

The optical band gap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor can be estimated by the extrapolation of the absorption edge and the equation Eg = 1240/λg, in which λg corresponds to the wavelength of the absorption edge.31,41 Thus, the band gap energy of pure g-C3N4 was calculated to be about 2.68 eV close to the reported results, while the Eg of pure CoTiO3 was close to 2.33 eV, which is slightly higher than that in previous studies,10,42 presumably due to the different crystallinities, particle sizes and morphologies.12 Nevertheless, a higher Eg can result in a stronger redox capability of the photogenerated charge carriers, which is known to be responsible for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.43
3.3 Photocatalytic evaluation
The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by the degradation of MO under visible light irradiation (>400 nm). As shown in Fig. 12a, as a reference, the self-degradation of MO is almost negligible without the addition of photocatalyst samples. Unfortunately, the photocatalytic activity of pure CoTiO3 is relatively low although it has the strongest visible light absorption among the samples. This result is similar to that of the previous reports, which can be attributed to the high recombination rate of its photogenerated electron–hole pairs and probably the poor oscillator strength of the O2− → Ti4+ charge transfer interaction.11,12,14 However, when CoTiO3 was used as a visible-light sensitizer to combine with g-C3N4, the obtained composites (except CTO/CN-3.0) exhibited a remarkably improved photocatalytic performance in comparison with both pure g-C3N4 and CoTiO3, revealing that a synergistic effect exists between g-C3N4 and CoTiO3. Moreover, the activities of the composite samples were found to firstly increase with the increasing of the CoTiO3 content until up to 1.0 wt% (CTO/CN-1.0), and then decrease at a higher CoTiO3 content, suggesting that the CTO/CN-1.0 composite had the highest photocatalytic activity, with the optimum CoTiO3 content of 1.0 wt%. A comparative study on the temporal evolution of the spectral changes of MO solution over pure CoTiO3, g-C3N4 and CTO/CN-1.0 (in Fig. 12b–d) also revealed the highest activity of the CTO/CN-1.0 composite. Correspondingly, the color of the residual MO solution changed gradually from the initial orange to almost colorless (inset of Fig. 12d).
 Fig. 12  (a) Photocatalytic degradation of MO over the as-synthesized samples under visible light irradiation. (b–e) Temporal evolution of the spectral changes of the MO solution by the sample pure g-C3N4, pure CoTiO3, CTO/CN-1.0 and CTO/CN-3.0 composites. (f) First-order kinetics plots of MO degradation by the as-synthesized samples under visible light irradiation. 
Specifically, the observed decrease in the photocatalytic efficiency of CTO/CN-3.0 with a higher CoTiO3 content could result from the fact that the overloading of CoTiO3 would not only cause the agglomeration of CoTiO3 crystals acting as the recombination centers of photogenerated charge carries but also destruct the formed heterojunction structures, thus inhibiting the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.27 Another reason is that the excess CoTiO3 may cover the surface of g-C3N4 and prevent it from efficient light absorption, thus reducing the yield of photogenerated charge carriers. Therefore, it is crucial to control the proportions of CoTiO3 in the composite photocatalysts to obtain the best activity.
Furthermore, the photodegradation process of MO by the as-synthesized photocatalysts was found to be a pseudo-first-order kinetic reaction owing to the low concentration of the MO aqueous solution and the kinetics was expressed by the formula: −ln(C/C0) = kt, where k is the photodegradation reaction rate constant, and C0 and C are the concentrations of MO at reaction times 0 and t, respectively.27,35,41 As shown in Fig. 12f, the apparent reaction rate constants (k) of different samples can be determined to be about 0.0172, 0.1526, 0.1835, 0.2104, 0.3016 and 0.1274 h−1 for pure CoTiO3, g-C3N4, CTO/CN-0.1, CTO/CN-0.5, CTO/CN-1.0 and CTO/CN-3.0, respectively, revealing that the introduction of CoTiO3 greatly influences the performance of the composite photocatalysts. It is obvious that the CTO/CN-1.0 composite with the largest k value has the highest photocatalytic activity, which is almost 2.0 and 17.0 times as high as those of individual g-C3N4 and CoTiO3, respectively. As a result, the sample CTO/CN-1.0 was selected for the following cycling experiments.
Taking into account that the lifetime of photocatalysts is a crucial parameter to evaluate their practical applications, the stability and reusability of the CTO/CN-1.0 composite were evaluated by performing cycling runs for MO degradation. As displayed in Fig. 13a, it is clear that the photocatalytic efficiency of the CTO/CN-1.0 composite does not show any significant reduction after four cycles (a slight decrease derived from the loss of the photocatalyst during the cycling process), and no obvious difference between the XRD patterns of the composite before and after the cycling experiments (Fig. 13b), indicating that the composite has relatively good stability and can serve as a reusable photocatalyst for environmental remediation.

In order to verify the migration, transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the composite photocatalysts, the PL spectra were recorded since the PL emission of a photocatalyst is mainly derived from the recombination of free charge carriers.44 Generally speaking, the lower the PL intensity, the lower the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is, thus meaning the higher the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 14 shows the PL spectra of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites as well as pure g-C3N4 with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature. As a reference, the pure g-C3N4 sample exhibits a strong emission peak at around 464 nm, corresponding to the band–band PL phenomenon with the energy of light approximately equal to the band gap energy of g-C3N4 (∼2.68 eV), which is in accordance with the UV-vis DRS result. As for the composite samples, the positions of the emission peaks in their PL spectra are similar to that of pure g-C3N4, but the emission peak intensities significantly decreased, indicating that the composites have a much lower recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. In other words, the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is greatly suppressed by the introduction of CoTiO3, which can be ascribed to the charge transfer from photoexcited g-C3N4 to CoTiO3 across the well-developed interfaces. However, sample CTO/CN-3.0 with the lower PL intensity relative to other composite samples exhibited poorer photocatalytic activity, which can be ascribed to the excessive introduction of CoTiO3 resulting in a decrease in the amount of effective photogenerated charges for photocatalytic reactions, as discussed in detail in the second paragraph of this part.

3.4 Possible photocatalytic mechanism
Based on the abovementioned results, the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite samples is mainly due to the enhanced visible light-harvesting ability and effective separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, both owing to the construction of heterojunction structures at the interface between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4. Thus, a possible mechanism responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed and illustrated in Fig. 15.
 Fig. 15  Schematic diagram of electron–hole pair separation at the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction interface and possible photocatalytic mechanism for MO degradation over the heterostructured CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite under visible-light irradiation. 
The conduction band and valence band edge potentials (namely, ECB and EVB) of CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 can be determined by the following equations: EVB = χ − E0 + 1/2Eg(1) ECB = χ−E0 − 1/2Eg(2)where χ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor determined by the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of constituent atoms; E0 is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV). The values of χ for CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 are about 5.76 and 4.73, respectively.42,45 So, the ECB and EVB of CoTiO3 were 0.10 and 2.43 eV vs. NHE, while the ECB and EVB of g-C3N4 were −1.11 and 1.57 eV vs. NHE, indicating that CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 match the band potentials in the staggered band-gap type heterojunctions,46 which is responsible for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
When the semiconductors g-C3N4 and CoTiO3 with well-matching band potentials are closely combined with each other, they will construct the effective CoTiO3/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Moreover, the different chemical potentials between the two components at their interface can create a built-in field, which facilitates the photogenerated electrons and holes to rapidly and efficiently travel in opposite directions.47 Under visible light irradiation (>400 nm), both CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 can be excited and produce photogenerated electrons and holes. Driven by the internal field at the interface between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4, the photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of g-C3N4 will be easily transferred to that of CoTiO3 across the tight interfaces, while the photogenerated holes on the valence band of CoTiO3 can be smoothly injected into that of g-C3N4 in a similar manner. In this way, an efficient spatial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes on different sides of the heterojunction is achieved, providing more long-lived charges to support the photocatalytic reactions for MO degradation, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The process for the efficient photodegradation of MO can be described as follows: (3) (4) O2 + e− → O2˙−(5) O2˙− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2(6) H2O2 + e− → ˙OH + OH−(7) H2O2 + hv → 2˙OH(8) O2˙−, h+, ˙OH + MO → degradation products.(9)
Additionally, it is worth pointing out that, according to the earlier reports,48–50 the exposed facets with different surface energies within a single crystal can form a surface heterojunction due to their well-matched band potentials, which then facilitates the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, in the case of CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composites, the synergistic effects among the facets of CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals as well as the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur under visible light irradiation, which is beneficial for the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, thus improving the photocatalytic performance.
4 Conclusions
In summary, this work is focused on the flux growth of CoTiO3 polyhedral crystals and the fabrication of novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts. Highly crystalline and idiomorphic CoTiO3 single crystals with well-defined polyhedral shapes were prepared via a facile flux method for the first time. Moreover, the molten salt type and cobalt precursor were demonstrated to have a remarkable effect on the phase composition, crystallization habit and morphology of the CoTiO3 products. Then, using the flux-grown CoTiO3 crystal as a visible-light sensitizer due to its narrow band gap (∼2.33 eV) to couple with g-C3N4 by an in situ growth approach, a novel CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite with improved photocatalytic activity was successfully synthesized. It was found that the formation of heterojunction structures between CoTiO3 and g-C3N4 owing to their intimate interfacial interactions resulted in efficient charge separation as well as an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability, which was responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity of the CoTiO3/g-C3N4 composite. Furthermore, the heterostructured composite also exhibited good stability and reusability for the efficient degradation of MO. Overall, the present work provides a new reference not only for the preparation of high-quality ilmenite CoTiO3 single crystals, but also for the design of novel heterostructured composites with high visible-light photocatalytic activity, further promoting both the potential applications of photocatalysis in environmental remediation and solar energy conversion.
