    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 6th September 2022AbstractCesium lead halide (CsPbX3) perovskites, having stood out for solar cell applications, are now garnering attention in the field of photocatalysis as well. With a fundamental challenge in photocatalysis of timely charge carrier extraction before recombination, incorporating ferrocene (Fc)-based functionalities can offer remarkable charge extraction efficiency in lead halide perovskites, given a recent 25% power conversion efficiency in a solar cell developed with a similar approach. Here, we have covalently linked Fc with amino acid residues to design three molecular redox relays differing in the ratio of –COOH to Fc units and employed them to probe the hole transfer dynamics in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) for photocatalytic applications. With Fc forming a part of the hydrophobic tail, the presence of the polar carboxylic acid (–COOH) headgroup endowed the molecule with a surfactant-type nature so that it could bind to the CsPbBr3 NCs' surface in colloidal solution. Interestingly, the enhanced binding in all three cases, as evident by the XPS peak shift, led to the formation of a long-lived charge-separated state when a dipole was created between the electrons in CsPbBr3 and holes in surface-bound Fc derivatives. This was evident in the transient absorption spectra when an unusually sustained bleach of the CsPbBr3 excitonic peak was observed in the presence of Fc derivatives. Such prolonged existence of the charge-separated state undoubtedly reflects upon the utility of molecular systems as cost-effective as Fc derivatives in perovskite NCs to carry out photocatalytic reactions where timely extraction of charge carriers is always a challenge to overcome.
Introduction
It is no recent topic of discussion that solar energy can be harvested to drive photochemical reactions.1,2 Early studies on the subject were mainly focused on binary and ternary semiconductors, metal oxides, and metal chalcogenides; but there has recently been avid interest in metal halide perovskites for fabricating solar energy converters.3–6 The advantage of their facile low-temperature synthesis, resilience to surface defects, wide tunability of the bandgap across the visible region, etc.,6–8 have made their relevance for photovoltaic applications seem propitious, where a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.6% has already been achieved.9 Nevertheless, there remains a lot of ground to cover, given that despite the Shockley–Queisser limit of 33%, careful utilization of hot carriers can lead to an efficiency of ∼66%.10,11 Cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) NCs, specifically CsPbBr3 NCs, are of particular interest in this context because of their high efficiencies enabled by negligible inherent trapping pathways, enabling enhanced transfer of electrons and holes.12 As an instance, in a comparative study of APbBr3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, and CH3(NH2)2+), De et al. obtained the time taken by hot carriers for cooling to be the longest in CsPbBr3, making it expectedly the most relevant candidate for charge transfer studies and related uses.13
Despite their myriad of applications and studies in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices,14–19 perovskite NCs have received somewhat limited attention for their use as photocatalysts,20–24 accounting for their instability in polar solvents and the presence of surfactants with a high energy barrier that also restricts the accessibility of active surface sites for redox relays.25 Charge transfer processes, crucial for any photocatalytic system, can be constrained by charge recombination or product accumulation near the photocatalyst's surface. As such, designing photocatalytic systems based on perovskite NCs requires studies to enhance their stability and a prime focus on optimizing the competitive processes of charge recombination and transfer across the photon absorber and molecular mediator.26 This, in essence, requires understanding the charge transfer dynamics and the associated factors governing the process.
Ferrocene (Fc) is a functional molecular relay for redox reactions and finds application in solar cells and catalysis. It can be employed to understand the charge transfer dynamics across molecular interfaces and materials to build robust systems for various applications.27–29 Past studies have also involved its incorporation with other moieties like thiophene, carboxylate groups, hexafluorophosphate, phosphine groups, etc., to tune the overall redox potential and efficiency of the solar cell or promote catalysis reactions like polymerization of terminal alkynes, asymmetric catalysis, etc.30–35 In this regard, functionalizing perovskite NCs with Fc can offer distinct advantages, including passivation of surface defects and promoting enhanced charge transfer and separation.30,31 Li et al. fabricated a perovskite solar cell functionalized with ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc2) that exhibited a high PCE of 25.0%, attributed to the accelerated charge transfer from perovskite to the Fc units via strong Pb–O binding.31 Charge transfer dynamics in the excited state of the CsPbBr3 NCs have been studied to determine their photocatalytic potential using the Fc redox couple (Fc+/Fc0).36 However, probing the perovskite with Fc+ is challenging and requires dealing with its instability and tendency to undergo rapid reduction in the presence of reducing ligands like oleylamine that is native to CsPbBr3 NCs.36,37
Motivated by the aforementioned studies, we have thus investigated the excited-state dynamics in CsPbBr3 NCs by modifying its surface with the Fc0 group. But given the catch that CsPbBr3 NCs require a non-polar solvent (preferably toluene) and Fc0 being highly soluble in it will not go to the surface of the perovskite, we have introduced polar functional groups on Fc by incorporating different amino acid residues (FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4), differing in the ratio of –COOH to Fc units.38 Such modification leads to a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, forming a ferrocenyl surfactant that allows it to go to the surface and afford binding through the polar –COOH group, which was also reflected in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. As such, we obtained values of the apparent association constant as high as 2.2 × 107 M−1 that eventually promoted efficient hole transfer. Differences in the number of –COOH head groups and Fc in the hydrophobic tail allowed us to compare Fc and the FcS moieties. In support of our argument, while almost no change was observed for Fc, hole transfer to Fe2+ in the case of Fc derivatives resulted in quenching of photoluminescence emission of CsPbBr3 NCs. This was also supported by a significant decrease in the lifetime of CsPbBr3 NCs. A long-lived bleach in the transient absorption (TA) spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs in the presence of FcS moieties indicated the formation of a prolonged charge-separated state with the creation of a dipole between the holes residing in surface-bound Fc units and electrons in CsPbBr3. Such uniqueness of the studied molecule highlights its viability for developing efficient photocatalysts where ameliorated charge extraction can be achieved. Thus, with the help of steady-state analysis and ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy measurements, we have successfully probed interfacial hole transfer between CsPbBr3 NCs and the molecular mediator and established the charge transfer dynamics in CsPbBr3 NCs.
Experimental details
Chemicals
Lead bromide (PbBr2, Sigma Aldrich, ≥98%), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%), oleic acid (OA, Sigma Aldrich, technical grade, 90%), oleylamine (OAm, Sigma Aldrich, technical grade, 70%), 1-octadecene (ODE, Sigma Aldrich, 90%), toluene (Sigma Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%), ferrocene (Fc, Sigma Aldrich, 98%), acetone (Finar), and ethanol (Pharmco-Aaper, HPLC, anhydrous, 200 proof) were commercially obtained and used as received.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs
Colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs were synthesized using the hot-injection method as reported by Protesescu et al., along with certain modifications.39 First, the Cs-oleate precursor was prepared by mixing Cs2CO3 (40.7 mg), OA (0.125 mL), and ODE (2 mL) in a 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask, followed by degassing at 60 °C for one hour. Raising the temperature to 150 °C under an N2 atmosphere resulted in the complete dissolution of Cs2CO3 and Cs-oleate formation. The temperature of the solution was maintained at 100 °C to avoid the precipitation of Cs-oleate out of ODE. Next, CsPbBr3 NCs were prepared as follows: PbBr2 (69 mg), ODE (5 mL), OA (0.5 mL), and OAm (0.5 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask and degassed at 120 °C for 1 h. The temperature was then increased to 160 °C under an N2 atmosphere until complete dissolution, and 0.4 mL of as-prepared Cs-oleate was rapidly injected. After 5 s, the mixture was kept in an ice-water bath. The color of the solution was observed to change from pale yellow to fluorescent green during reaction quenching. NCs were separated from the crude solution by dissolving in acetone and centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 20 min. The collected NCs were then dispersed in toluene, and a stock dispersion was obtained (supernatant) upon repeated centrifugation.
Preparation of Fc, FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 stock solutions
An appropriate amount of Fc, FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 was taken in separate 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with 500 μL ethanol and sonicated until complete dissolution to give 20 mM stock solution. The solution was further diluted to 2 mM in ethanol. Keeping the dilution factor constant, 2 mM was diluted to 0.2 mM and 0.02 mM in toluene. A fresh stock solution of 0.02 mM was similarly prepared by stepwise dilution of 20 mM solution every time before the experiment.
TEM sample preparation
To prepare the TEM sample, we used ∼10 nM CsPbBr3 in toluene with 293 nM Fc, FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 separately in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and allowed it to equilibrate for 10 minutes. The solution was then drop-casted over a TEM grid and allowed to dry at room temperature.
Instrumentation
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a FEI-Tecnai G2 12 Twin 120 kV transmission electron microscope for the morphological characterization of the NCs. All steady-state absorption spectra were recorded using a JASCO V770 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were made on a Horiba Scientific Fluoromax+ spectrofluorometer. The sample was excited at 365 nm, and the step size was set as 1 nm.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out using a Metrohm Autolab voltammeter at room temperature. A three-electrode cell was employed with a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Sample solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 20 mM KH2PO4 and 20 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 7. All the potentials are mentioned here vs. vacuum, obtained by converting the values corresponding to the Ag/AgCl electrode using a factor of −0.44 V.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe-II, FEI Inc., Japan, with a monochromatized Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source. Steady-state photolysis was done to monitor the hole-transfer product using a broadband light source, OSL2 Fiber Illuminator from Thorlabs.
Time-resolved PL decay was recorded using a life spec (II) Edinburgh Instrument time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system, using an excitation source of 375 nm laser. F900 software provided by Edinburgh Instruments was used to analyze decay curves.
Femtosecond TA measurements were performed on a FemtoFrame-II, IB Photonics, Sofia, Bulgaria, spectrometer. The fundamental light at 800 nm was obtained by directing the seed laser output from a Ti-sapphire femtosecond oscillator (MaiTai SP, Spectra-Physics, USA) into a Ti-sapphire regenerative amplifier (SpitfirePro XP, Spectra-Physics, USA), which was then pumped with a 20 W Q-switched Nd:YLF laser (Empower, Spectra-Physics, USA). The fundamental beam was split into two parts: one part was used to generate 400 nm second harmonic light for the pump by passing it through a β-barium borate crystal, and the other part was used to generate a white light continuum probe pulse of 460–750 nm wavelength spread by passing it through a delay stage (1 ns maximum delay time) and focusing it on a sapphire crystal. After the transmission of the probe light through the sample, it was dispersed onto a CCD camera for detection by a polychromator. The pump light power was maintained at 14 μW for all experiments. The pulse width of the fundamental light was 80 fs and the measured instrument response function was 150 fs. Transient absorption measurements were performed using a cuvette with a path length of 1 mm in contrast to all other measurements with a 1 cm path length. So, for TA measurements, we increased the concentration of CsPbBr3 and FcS by ∼20 times, keeping the concentration ratio almost the same.
Results and discussion
The optical characteristics of CsPbBr3 NCs are presented in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra showed a characteristic first excitonic peak at 490 nm, and a well-defined PL peak was obtained at 507 nm. In the inset, TEM images at a 20 nm scale depicted the cubic morphology of CsPbBr3 NCs with appreciable monodispersibility in toluene and highlighted their uniform size distribution. For their charge transfer analysis, we first explored the effect of Fc on the absorption and emission spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs. As evident from Fig. 1b, changes observed in the absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs were negligible after adding Fc. This is attributed to the low molar extinction coefficient of Fc (∼100 M−1 cm−1 at 445 nm)40 that leads to almost no interference with the absorbance of perovskite NCs at the chosen concentrations. A corresponding TEM image has been provided in the inset, showing no structural change upon adding Fc. Furthermore, the size distribution of CsPbBr3 NCs with and without the addition of Fc was evaluated from the TEM images and determined to be 8.82 nm and 9.36 nm, respectively (Fig. S1a and b†). Moreover, negligible quenching of the emission of CsPbBr3 NCs was observed from the PL spectra even after increasing the concentration of Fc up to 293 nM. This concurs with the observation by Kamat and co-workers36 and is reasonably acceptable because Fc0, being highly soluble in non-polar solvents like toluene, is likely to stay away from the NC surface and consequently not quench CsPbBr3 emission.

(b) Normalized absorption and PL spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs with the addition of different concentrations of Fc. Insets show the TEM images of ∼10 nM CsPbBr3 NCs (a) before and (b) after 293 nM Fc addition. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software. 
To overcome this, we modified Fc by covalently linking it with different amino acid residues consisting of polar –COOH headgroups (Fig. 2a), the synthesis of which is presented in the ESI.† Such a structure would allow it to bind to the NC surface and facilitate charge transfer at the interface by forming what we can call a ferrocenyl surfactant (FcS) with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. Moreover, there are high chances of achieving its efficient anchoring to the CsPbBr3 NCs' surface, given that the native oleic acid ligands anchor to the surface of the NCs efficiently via the –COOH groups. So, before moving further, we first analyzed the redox behavior of the as-synthesized surfactant molecules via cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a constant scan rate (Fig. 2b). The study was carried out in water, so the concentration of all three surfactants could not be kept constant and had to be optimized accordingly. The potential at maximum current (Eox) was obtained to be 0.27 V, 0.26 V, and 0.25 V for FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4, respectively, which gave us the corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level.

As highlighted, Fc constitutes the end of the hydrophobic tail, whereas carboxylic acid forms the hydrophilic head. (b) Normalized cyclic voltammogram of FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 at a constant scan rate of 300 mV s−1. (c) Normalized absorption spectra of FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4. (d) Conduction and valence band energy alignment of CsPbBr3 NCs and the different studied ferrocenyl surfactants. The HOMO and LUMO levels have been determined using cyclic voltammetry data and absorption spectra, respectively. 
Furthermore, we recorded the absorption spectra of the individual surfactants in the toluene solvent (Fig. 2c), keeping the concentration of FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 the same, 100 μM. Absorption onsets for FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4 were obtained at 522 nm, 528 nm, and 528 nm, respectively. The addition of energy corresponding to the absorption onset to the thus obtained HOMO levels from CV data helped us estimate the energy of the molecules' lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).41 As such, an energy level alignment diagram of CsPbBr3, Fc,42 and ferrocenyl surfactants could be made, indicating that hole transfer from the HOMO of CsPbBr3 to the surfactants was a possibility (Fig. 2d). Thus, we could now safely probe the charge transfer dynamics in CsPbBr3 NCs by considering three different Fc derivatives that differed in terms of the number of –COOH to Fc units, namely FcS1 (1:1), FcS2 (2:1), and FcS4 (1:2) (collectively referred to as FcS).

Fig. 3a–c show the absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs containing different concentrations of FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4. As expected, the addition of Fc derivatives did not affect CsPbBr3 absorption, indicating that its interaction with CsPbBr3 did not induce any chemical/structural transformation or affect the light harvesting properties of the perovskite NCs. The TEM images in the inset also confirmed no structural change in CsPbBr3 NCs upon adding FcS. The size distribution of CsPbBr3 NCs, as determined from the TEM images with and without FcS addition, also showed little change (Fig. S1c–e†). However, significant emission quenching could be observed upon increasing the concentration of the Fc derivatives, although up to a different extent for each (Fig. 3d–f). In the case of FcS4, emission was quenched up to 92% even at a concentration as low as 293 nM. An intriguing aspect of this observation is that despite the almost similar change in free energy required for hole transfer from the HOMO of CsPbBr3 to FcS and Fc (Fig. 2d), we observed substantial differences in their quenching results. This indicated that the observed results were associated with how strong and efficient the binding was between the two species and not the corresponding energy levels. Hence, the PL quenching was analyzed by considering an equilibrium between the two interacting species (reaction (1)). (1)Here, Kapp represents the apparent association constant between Fc derivatives and CsPbBr3 NCs, which we determined by analyzing the double reciprocal plot of emission quenching data with the help of the Benesi–Hildebrand method43 (see the ESI† for the equation to estimate the association constant). We obtained Kapp values as high as 1.5 × 107 M−1, 3.1 × 106 M−1, and 2.2 × 107 M−1 for FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4, respectively. Such large Kapp values imply strong binding between the molecule and the NCs, indicating substantial accessibility of surface sites by the redox-active FcS species for interaction and charge transfer.44 Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Kapp values for a system similar to ours have not been reported as high as these yet (Table 1),45–52 which adds up to our motivation behind probing the charge transfer dynamics in CsPbBr3 NCs using these Fc derivatives. Nevertheless, we observed a significant difference between the Kapp values for our molecules, following the order of Kapp(FcS4) > Kapp(FcS1) > Kapp(FcS2), and a similar trend was followed by the emission quenching data (Fig. 3d–f) as well. We repeated the experiment several times, but this trend was consistent and is shown with error bars in Fig. S2.†

To evidence if the enhanced PL quenching was associated with the binding of Fc derivatives to the CsPbBr3 surface, we assessed the elemental composition of FcS treated CsPbBr3 NCs via XPS measurements (Fig. 4).53 The deconvolution of the XPS spectrum of untreated CsPbBr3 yielded two prominent Pb peaks at 138.07 eV (4f7/2) and 142.93 eV (4f5/2) that correspond to the Pb2+ oxidation state. Compared to pristine CsPbBr3 NCs, the XPS peak shifted towards higher binding energy for FcS treated CsPbBr3. Similarly, the two peaks corresponding to the Br 3d core level at 67.94 eV (3d5/2) and 68.93 eV (3d3/2) also shifted to higher binding energies. The accuracy in peak position determination was also evaluated and is presented in Table S1.† This indicated enhanced binding of both the surface cations and anions of the perovskite to FcS that eventually gave us the thus observed PL quenching results.

Furthermore, given the favorable alignment of the band energies of the FcS0/FcS+ redox couple for CsPbBr3 and the observed significant binding and emission quenching, we ought to assess the formation of the hole transfer product upon visible light irradiation. We anticipated the interaction between FcS units and CsPbBr3 NCs to deactivate the excited state and lead to hole transfer to Fc0, as shown in reaction (2): [FcS–CsPbBr3] + hν → [FcS–CsPbBr3(h+–e−)] → [FcS(h+)–CsPbBr3(e−)](2)
To confirm the formation of the hole-transfer product, we did a steady-state photolysis experiment of the CsPbBr3 solution containing FcS1. The absorbance of the sample was recorded after regular time intervals with continuous visible light illumination. Because of its low molar extinction coefficient in the visible region, the concentration of FcS1 was increased to 100 μM so that the change in absorbance could be monitored upon the formation of the hole-transfer product. As the direct identification of the hole-transfer product from the absorption spectra was difficult due to the strong overlap caused by CsPbBr3 absorption (Fig. 5a), the changes were thus resolved in difference absorption spectra (Fig. 5b). As seen, the decrease in the absorption peak at around 410 nm intensified remarkably with time. This demonstrates the loss of Fc0 species from the solution. But since this could not confirm if hole transfer to Fc0 was taking place, we examined the spectrum closely. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, a progressive increase in the absorption peak at 650 nm is easily identifiable, corresponding to the formation of Fc+ species and thus, confirms Fc0 oxidation upon visible light irradiation. Similar observations were made in the case of FcS2 and FcS4 as well (Fig. S3†).

(a) Absorption spectra of ∼10 nM CsPbBr3 in toluene containing 100 μM FcS1 before and after 1 min of visible light irradiation. Absorption spectra of only CsPbBr3 and FcS1 are shown for reference. (b) The difference absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 and FcS1 solution were recorded at regular time intervals upon visible light irradiation, indicating the loss of Fc0 species at 410 nm. The inset shows a zoomed version of the same plot, indicating the formation of Fc+ species at 650 nm. The difference in absorbance at 1 and 5 minutes interval has been omitted for clarity. 
In contrast, control measurements were performed with similar parameters in the dark, and no such change in the absorbance could be spotted (Fig. S4†). Similarly, the absorbance did not change when FcS1 was directly illuminated with visible light without adding CsPbBr3 to the solution (Fig. S5†). So, Fc0 mainly accumulated the extracted holes from CsPbBr3 NCs, and the attached –COOH linkers helped achieve the same.
Furthermore, we monitored the PL decay (at λmax = 507 nm) to probe the interaction between FcS and the excited state of CsPbBr3 NCs using time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) (Fig. 6a–c). The sample consisted of different concentrations of Fc and FcS and was excited using a 375 nm diode laser. The kinetic parameters obtained upon tri-exponential fitting of the PL decay profiles have been summarized in Table S2.† As expected, while there was no noticeable change in the average lifetime upon Fc addition (Fig. S6†), a significant decrease was obtained in the cases FcS1, FcS2, and FcS4, with the largest decrease of ∼82% occurring in the case of FcS4. Here, strong perovskite–FcS binding, as supported by the XPS results, allowed efficient charge transfer, because of which we observed a decrease in the lifetime. But due to the difference in the binding strength of the three Fc derivatives to CsPbBr3 surface, the extent of respective charge transfer was also different. As a result, the decrease in lifetime corresponding to the three Fc derivatives also varied. Moreover, it was also evident that the decrease in the lifetime was due to charge transfer because upon increasing the FcS concentration, the lifetime and the corresponding contribution of all the other components decreased, but the contribution of the fast component (τ1), a1, increased. So, taking into account that charge transfer occurs on a faster timescale, it was confirmed that the rapid quenching of the emission of the CsPbBr3 excited state resulted from a fast hole transfer-dominated process.36

Time-resolved PL spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs monitored at λ = 375 nm excitation wavelength is shown with the addition of different concentrations (0 nM, 98 nM, and 293 nM) of (a) FcS1, (b) FcS2, and (c) FcS4. Schematic illustration of the binding of (d) FcS1, (e) FcS2, and (f) FcS4 to the CsPbBr3 NCs' surface. The presence of –COOH groups allows 1 Fc unit to be anchored per 1 adsorption site for FcS1, 1 Fc unit to be anchored per 2 adsorption sites for FcS2, and 2 Fc units to be anchored per 1 adsorption site for FcS4. 
With all the aforementioned spectroscopic analyses and comprehending the PL quenching mechanism, it is now not hard to rationalize the observed trend as we move from FcS1 to FcS4. A straightforward approach to its explanation can be by considering the structural factor and the binding scheme with CsPbBr3 NCs. A molecule of FcS1 has one Fc per –COOH unit, which allows quenching to be a consequence of the –COOH unit occupying a single adsorption site on Pb2+ (Fig. 6d). FcS2, on the other hand, has one Fc per two –COOH unit, which implies that a greater number of adsorption sites on Pb2+ would be required for the same amount of quenching by the Fc unit as FcS1 and hence, an association of FcS2 with CsPbBr3 NCs can be expected to a lesser extent (Fig. 6e). However, a molecule of FcS4 has two Fc per –COOH units, making it simple to infer that the quenching of emission by the Fc unit can take place to a greater magnitude than FcS1 by the occupation of just a single adsorption site on Pb2+ (Fig. 6f).
Furthermore, we performed femtosecond TA measurements with 400 nm laser pulse excitation to gain better insights into the ultrafast hole transfer process. Fig. 7a–d show the TA spectra recorded upon laser excitation of 200 nM CsPbBr3 NCs with and without 6 μM FcS at an early time (0–4 ps). As can be seen, a negative absorbance feature was initially developed around the 496–504 nm range that increased in amplitude with time delay. This corresponds to the loss of the excitonic band of CsPbBr3 due to the separation of electron–hole pairs generated upon bandgap excitation. The positive absorption feature developing adjacent to the bleach signal on the lower energy side could be either due to polaron formation or associated with hot excitons.54,55 Interestingly, a red shift of the bleaching signal occurred for all four samples with increasing delay time, which reflected upon the existence of other relaxation pathways from the excited state, mainly the biexciton effect.56 A biexciton is formed when there is a coulombic interaction of a hot exciton with a band-edge exciton, leading to the excitation of two free excitons. Here, the red shift was observed in the spectrum because the less energy required by the band-edge exciton led to a reduction in the energy of the whole system.57,58 As such, we estimated the biexciton binding energy to be in the range of 10–40 meV for all four cases, indicating that stable excitons could be formed at room temperature.58 Moreover, the bleach formation profile presented in the insets of Fig. 7a–d shows the rise in the bleach occurring at the maximum time delay in CsPbBr3 with FcS4. In that capacity, along with the most potent bleach, an inference of the maximum number of holes being trapped by surface-bound FcS4 at the CsPbBr3 NCs' surface can be drawn.
 Fig. 7  Bleach formation in the TA spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs with and without FcS addition (λex = 400 nm) at different time delays. Early TA spectra up to a time delay of 4 ps shows bleach formation for 200 nM CsPbBr3 with (a) 0 μM FcS, (b) 6 μM FcS1, (c) 6 μM FcS2, and (d) 6 μM FcS4, respectively (time indicated in fs). The yellow and black dotted lines indicate the redshift of the spectra with time. Insets depict the bleach formation profile monitored at a 540 nm probe wavelength. 
On a 10–700 ps timescale, the recorded TA spectra showed bleach recovery with increasing time delay (Fig. 8a–d). In the absence of FcS, the bleach recovery in CsPbBr3 NCs occurred due to charge recombination via a radiative and non-radiative pathway. However, in the presence of FcS, an additional pathway of photogenerated holes being transferred from CsPbBr3 to FcS also competed. As such, recovery in the initial time delay was rapid in the presence of FcS and was observed to be maximum for FcS1 (<15 ps), with which we estimated the rate constant for hole transfer as >1010 s−1. However, it is clear from the insets of Fig. 8a–d that a residual bleach in the case of CsPbBr3 with FcS occurred on the longer timescale, which contrasts with the recovery trend seen in the case of only CsPbBr3 NCs.
 Fig. 8  Bleach recovery in the TA spectra up to 703 ps time delay is shown for 200 nM CsPbBr3 with (a) 0 μM FcS, (b) 6 μM FcS1, (c) 6 μM FcS2, and (d) 6 μM FcS4 (time indicated in ps). Insets depict the transient bleach recovery monitored at a 504 nm probe wavelength. 
The sustained bleach feature at longer times implies a long-lived charge separation with hole transfer to Fc units in FcS, occurring in the bound state of [FcS–CsPbBr3], as shown in reaction (2). This is in accordance with previous studies,46,47,59 and so charge separation with the formation of this residual bleach can thus be attributed to the Stark effect resulting from the development of a dipole between holes residing in surface-bound FcS and electrons residing in CsPbBr3.60 Hence, an increase in the residual bleach (obtained maximum for FcS1) means an increase in the formation of such long-lived dipoles. However, our result on the long-term bleach and prolonged charge separation is in contrast to other analyses of varied NC systems,13,36,61 where charge transfer to the acceptor species resulted in an enhanced bleach recovery rate (faster ground state regeneration). This is because the charge carriers remained as separate entities in such studies. Meanwhile in our case, strong surface interactions of FcS molecular relay with CsPbBr3 allowed the separated charges to remain in a bound state ([FcS(h+)–CsPbBr3(e−)]) and create a dipole that made our system a distinct virtue of extended charge separation.
Nevertheless, upon comparison, we observed that while the rise component of transient bleach was maximum for FcS4, residual bleach, on the other hand, occurred up to the maximum extent for FcS1 (Fig. 9a and b). The formation of the bleach profile with respect to the time delay for different FcS molecules exhibited a similar trend as before. Still, the charge separation efficiency depicted by the recovery profile seemed to show no dependence on the charge transfer or association with CsPbBr3 (Kapp). Here, the residual bleach is directly correlated with back electron transfer (a spontaneous process) from FcS to CsPbBr3 NCs. Hence, it relies not just on binding to the surface but on the other factors, including the orientation and location of Fc units from the NCs' surface.28 So, despite the maximum binding of FcS4 to CsPbBr3, we observed that the efficiency with which charges remained separated was maximum for FcS1.
 Fig. 9  Bleach formation and recovery comparison. (a) Bleach formation profile of CsPbBr3 NCs with and without 6 μM FcS4 up to 10 ps time delay, showing the bleach formation taking a maximum time of 1100 ± 65 fs in the presence of FcS4. (b) Bleach recovery of CsPbBr3 NCs with and without 6 μM FcS1 up to 800 ps time delay shows sustained bleach for longer time in the presence of FcS1. 
Conclusion
In a nutshell, we have explored the interfacial hole transfer dynamics in CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs using a convenient redox relay system based on Fc derivatives. The importance of surface binding could easily be realized when substantial hole transfer was achieved to FcS units, but no compelling results were obtained upon probing charge transfer with Fc0. We successfully established a reasonable comparison between the different FcS moieties based on how their surfactant nature helped in binding with the perovskite that promoted charge transfer across the interface. The enhanced binding and surface interaction gave us residual bleach for longer times in the TA spectra. This implies a long-lived charge-separated state in a bound state. Such prolonged existence of the charge-separated state undoubtedly reflects upon the utility of Fc derivatives in perovskite NCs to carry out photocatalytic reactions, where timely extraction of charge carriers is always a challenge to overcome. With this, we believe that proper acknowledgment and assessment of molecules and their derivatives towards interfacial charge transfer, surface interactions, etc., is crucial to overcoming the present constraints of charge extraction, accessibility of active surface sites, and instability in the polar medium. Besides, not to mention that taken together, our findings and a recent report on an FcTc2-functionalized perovskite solar cell that was able to achieve a PCE of 25% assures us that a careful selection among various functionalities to be engineered with the Fc core holds great potential in the future of perovskite solar cells as well.
