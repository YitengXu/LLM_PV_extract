    , Accepted 10th March 2015First published on 11th March 2015AbstractCdTe/CdSe nanocrystal (NC) solar cells with an inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au) have been successfully fabricated by a simple solution process coupled with layer-by-layer sintering techniques. It was found that the device performance is strongly dependent on the annealing strategy, the thickness of the acceptor layer and on the buffer layer of ZnO when the optimal thickness of CdTe is adopted. Without the ZnO buffer layer, a thin film of the CdSe NCs on an ITO substrate shows a rougher morphology, resulting in device shunting. However, when a 40 nm-thick ZnO buffer layer and 60 nm-thick CdSe were employed, the device shows a much higher PCE of 5.81% under device conditions, post-annealing at 340 °C. This value is the highest efficiency ever reported to date for a CdTe/CdSe NC solar cell. Comparing with CdTe/CdSe NC solar cells with the normal device configuration, this device with an inverted structure simultaneously offers good Ohmic contact for carrier collection and efficient harvesting of solar photons in a wide wavelength.
1. Introduction
Thin film solar cells based on solution-processed semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) offer the potential of low materials consumption, low-cost and easy large area production with good stability.1–3 To date, III–V NCs including PbS,4 PbSe5 and PbSxSe1−x (ref. 6) with a tunable band gap have been well exploited, and promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of ∼7% have been reported in the case of PbS–TiO2 depleted p–n junction solar cells. On the other hand, solar cells based on sintering NCs such as CuInS2,7 CuInSe28 and CdTe9–15 have also been investigated and good device performances have been obtained. Among them, CdTe NC solar cells have attracted much attention since CdTe is a less complex and stable compound, which allows the CdTe devices to be fabricated under ambient conditions. However, due to the defects which exist on the interface, Fermi-level pinning is generally produced in the case of CdTe solar cells with Schottky diode structure, which results in a low open circuit voltage (Voc) and a short device lifetime.16 In order to effectively collect photo-induced carriers in CdTe devices, they have generally been fabricated with the p–n device configuration. In a previous report,17 solar cells based on CdTe NCs with the p–n junction structure of CdTe/ZnO have recently demonstrated a certified PCE of 8.54%, showing a remarkable improvement compared with the first reported results for this type of solar cell.9 Among all kinds of CdTe NC-based p–n heterojunction solar cells, CdTe/CdSe attracts much attention because of its unique and interesting properties. For example, CdTe and CdSe NCs have similar sizes (∼10–15 nm) and structures (zinc-blende or wurtzite) by controlling the experimental parameters, so the lattice mismatch between CdTe and CdSe is very small, which is promising for eliminating CdTe/CdSe interface defects during the sintering process. In 2005, Gur et al. reported for the first time all solution processed CdTe/CdSe NC solar cells with a 2.9% PCE.18 Anderson et al. and Ju et al.19,20 further investigated such devices by using different electrodes and adjusting the thickness of the CdSe film, with the highest PCE values achieved being 2.6% and 3%, respectively. In the above reports, the low device performances originate from two obvious drawbacks. Firstly, the Voc was below 0.5 V, while this value approached 0.8 V in the case of CdTe/CdS thin film solar cells fabricated by a close-spaced sublimation method.21 On the other hand, the series resistance of the devices was large, leading to the fill factor (FF) being below 50%. A key reason is that the CdTe/CdSe films were over-treated to obtain large scale grain growth during the sintering process. This problem can be overcome by using a layer-by-layer sintering approach, which has been confirmed by Macdonald et al.22 and our research group.23 CdTe NC solar cells with the inverted structure have many benefits over the devices with the normal structure reported above. For example, the charge-separating interface is close to the illumination due to the thin ZnO layer, and a high work function metal–metal oxide is used as the hole-collecting electrode to provide good device stability in this case. More recently, Townsend et al.24 adopted this approach to fabricate CdSe/CdTe solar cells with an inverted structure of ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Au, and a PCE as high as 3.8% was obtained. By using a novel inverted heterojunction, Yoon et al.25 obtained a high Voc of 0.62 V in a ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Cr/Au device. However, a low short-circuit current (Jsc) coupled with a low FF led to a low PCE of 2.13% in this case. Although PCE values as high as ∼10% have been obtained in the case of ITO/CdTe/ZnO/Al devices with the normal structure, it is still difficult to obtain high PCE values in the case of CdTe/ZnO (or CdTe/TiO2) devices with the inverted structure (such as ITO/ZnO/CdTe/Au). We suppose that different device techniques existed in this case, resulting in the different device performances. In the case of the ITO/CdTe/ZnO/Al device, a ZnO precursor was deposited on an ITO/CdTe substrate (CdTe NCs films were fabricated by layer-by-layer sintering at ∼350 °C) and annealed at a relatively low temperature of 200 °C (high temperature exclusively makes devices shunting),17 which permitted good adhesion to CdTe film and a low interface defect density. On the contrary, when the inverted structure is applied, i.e. CdTe NCs are deposited on ITO/ZnO by a layer-by-layer sintering process, the subsequent CdCl2 treatment will contaminate the ZnO/CdTe interface, resulting in a high interface defect density and low device performance due to the mismatch of crystalline structure. Compared with CdTe, CdSe has a relatively wide bandgap (∼1.8 eV), which may reduce Jsc due to parasitic absorption. However, by introducing a CdSe layer between the ZnO and CdTe with a structure of ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au, we can avoid the above ZnO/CdTe inverted device problem since CdTe and CdSe have similar sizes and structures, which permit a good junction of CdTe/CdSe and decrease the interface defects. High device performance is then expected in this case. In this paper, we develop a new inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au which possesses many benefits. For example, the charge-separating interface (p–n junction) is close to the illumination, which is conducive to the efficient collection of carriers. The ZnO layer provides better electrical stability by forming a smooth and pin-hole-free pre-layer on which a smooth CdSe NC film can be grown. This eliminates catastrophic shorts which can occur when the upper CdTe NC layer is in direct contact with the ITO, which has been confirmed in our previous work26 with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/CBD-CdS/CdTe/MoOx/Ag. By carefully controlling the sintering conditions and optimizing the thickness of the CdSe layer, this architecture produces the highest PCE value, 5.81%, of all solution processed CdTe/CdSe NCs solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication of CdTe, CdSe NCs and ZnO precursor
CdSe or CdTe NCs were fabricated by a hot thermal method with cadmium carboxylate as the cadmium precursor and tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP)-Se or TOP-Te as the Se or Te precursor. In a typical synthesis procedure, 1.2 mmol of cadmium myristate, 0.5 mmol myristic acid and 2.32 g TOPO were loaded into a three neck bottle which was fitted with a thermometer. Then the mixture was heated to 240 °C at a rate of 8 °C/10 minutes under a N2 flow. A solution of 1 mL TOP-Se with a concentration of 1 mmol mL−1 or 1 mL TOP-Te with a concentration of 1 mmol mL−1 was quickly injected into the reaction flask. The mixture was kept at this temperature for 40 minutes and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the product was washed with methanol and refluxed in pyridine. The total process can be found in our previous reports.23,27 The final CdTe NCs products were dissolved in a hybrid solvent of pyridine and 1-PrOH (with a volume ratio of 1:1), with a concentration of 50 mg mL−1. On the other hand, the final CdSe NC products were dissolved in pyridine with a concentration of 40 mg mL−1. Each NC solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before being used. The ZnO sol–gel precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate hydrate and ethanolamine in a solution of 2-methoxylethanol with a concentration of 0.5 mol L−1.
2.2 Device fabrication
The NC heterojunction solar cells with ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au, ITO/ZnO/CdTe/Au and ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Au structures were fabricated by a layer-by-layer solution process. For example, the fabrication of ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au can be carried out as follows. Firstly, a layer of ZnO thin film with ∼40 nm thickness was prepared by spin-casting ZnO precursor solution on an ITO substrate, following annealing at 200 °C for 10 minutes, as reported before.28 After the substrate was cleaned and dried, several drops of CdSe NC solution was put onto the ITO/ZnO substrate and spin-casted at 3000 rpm for 15 s. Then the substrate was placed on a hotplate and annealed at 300 °C for 5 minutes to remove any organic complex. The thickness of a CdSe NC thin film with one layer is about 30 nm. To obtain CdSe NC thin films with different thicknesses, more layers should be deposited individually by repeating the above process. A CdTe NC thin film was prepared by spin-coating CdTe NC solution onto the ITO/ZnO/CdSe substrate at 1000 rpm for 20 s. The sample was then placed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 3 min to eliminate any organic solvent and ligands. After that it was dipped into a saturated CdCl2 methanol solution for 3 s, rinsed with 1-PrOH and dried under a nitrogen stream. The sample was then sintered on a hot plate at 350 °C for 40 s (the optimal annealing time). This process was repeated 5 times to get a final CdTe thickness of 500 nm. To activate the CdTe/CdSe junction, a further annealing process should be undertaken. The as-prepared samples were put on a hotplate at 300–400 °C for 10 minutes. Au with ∼80 nm thickness was selected as the back contact with the CdTe NC thin film, via thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The active area of the p–n junction solar cells is 0.16 cm2. The fabrication of the ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Au and ITO/ZnO/CdTe/Au devices is similar to that of the ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au device.
2.3 Characterization and measurement
The optical properties of the samples were characterized using a UV spectrophotometer (HP 4583). Surface roughness, elemental content and morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cell devices were measured by a Keithley 2400 meter under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192).
3. Results and discussion
The CdTe–CdSe NC solar cell architecture in our case is ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/CdSe/CdTe (500 nm)/Au (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b depicts the energy diagram of ITO, ZnO, CdSe, CdTe and Au. The thickness of the CdTe film is around 500 nm for absorbing more remaining photons, which was fabricated by depositing 5 layers of CdTe NCs on an ITO/ZnO/CdSe substrate (as shown in Fig. 1a). Fig. 1c shows a cross-section SEM image of a typical ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe film with 60 nm CdSe thickness. The composition of the as-prepared samples was characterized by EDX measurements (Fig. 1d). The atomic and weight percentage composition of Cd, Se and Te is listed in the inset table of Fig. 1d. We note that the atomic ratio of Cd to Se and Te is 1.03:1, which is close to the molar ratio of Cd to Se and Cd to Te for the CdSe and CdTe composites. As CdCl2 methanol solution was deposited on the CdTe NCs thin film and then the sample was sintered at high temperature to increase the grain size, a small quantity of Cl is found to exist in the samples.

For the optical characterization of the CdSe NC thin films, different thicknesses of CdSe NCs were deposited on the ITO/ZnO substrate with one or more layers. Absorbance and transmission spectra for ITO, ITO/ZnO and ITO/ZnO/CdSe with different thicknesses are displayed in Fig. 2a and b. It should be noted that ZnO thin films are transparent from 400 to 900 nm, while significant absorbance from 400 to 700 nm was found in the cases where CdSe films were present, increasing with the increase in thickness from 30 nm to 120 nm. The band gap of CdSe is about 1.77 eV calculated from the absorbance edge (Fig. 2a). With the increase in CdSe thickness, the transmission in the visible wavelength region (400 nm to 700 nm) decreases linearly (Fig. 2b), which is not promising for a CdSe/CdTe heterojunction device as CdTe has a lower band gap of ∼1.45 eV and can transfer more photons to carriers than CdSe. So a more suitable thickness of CdSe film is necessary for achieving high performance CdTe/CdSe heterojunction solar cells.

The ZnO thin film can provide some improvement in CdSe NC solar cells as an interlayer, which has been confirmed in our previous reports on CdTe/CdS heterojunction solar cells with an inverted device structure.26 The AFM images of the as-prepared CdSe NC thin film with or without a ZnO interlayer are shown in Fig. 3. Without a ZnO interlayer, the morphology of ITO/CdSe is very uneven with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.618 nm (Fig. 3a). On the contrary, the CdSe film prepared on ITO/ZnO shows compact and smooth morphology in the whole area with a RMS roughness of 2.246 nm (Fig. 3b). A large leakage current and bad CdSe/CdTe p–n junction are expected in the case of CdSe without ZnO, as the upper CdTe may be in contact with the ITO cathode in the unfilled CdSe area. The device without ZnO exclusively showed a PCE of lower than 2%. Therefore, ZnO was selected as the interlayer to fabricate CdSe/CdTe NCs solar cells with an inverted device structure.

The annealing temperature has a great effect on CdTe-based NC solar cells, demonstrated not only in our previous work26 but also in another research group’s work.9 The ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe film was treated with CdCl2 in methanol and then sintered in air at 300–400 °C to recover the bulk behavior of CdTe and CdSe, and activate the p–n junction of CdTe/CdSe. However, too high a sintering temperature will make the film break down in some place and result in the current shunting in the device. So a moderate annealing temperature of 350 °C was selected for the thin film fabrication by layer-by-layer deposition. To investigate the influence of the CdSe layer thickness on the device performance, CdSe/CdTe solar cells with different thicknesses of CdSe films were fabricated while keeping other conditions unchanged. For comparison, devices with the structures of ITO/ZnO/CdTe/Au and ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Au were also fabricated under the same conditions. Fig. 4a presents the J–V curves of the NCs solar cells with different thicknesses of CdSe film and different device structures under 1000 W m−2 (AM 1.5G), while Fig. 4b presents the dark J–V curves for these devices. It is clear that without CdSe film, the dark current was larger in the case of the ITO/ZnO/CdTe/Au device (Fig. 4b). Although the Jsc was found to remain at a high level (∼18 mA cm−2), a low Voc and FF resulted in a low PCE of 1.86%. On the other hand, without a ZnO interlayer, the PCE of the ITO/CdSe/CdTe/Au device is only 1.07%. We suppose that solvent treatment may damage the CdSe film during the deposition of the CdTe NCs film, leading to the high defect density and low device performance. In the case of the ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au devices, the Jsc is found to drop down linearly from 21.01 mA cm−2 to 12.22 mA cm−2 with the increase in CdSe thickness from 30 nm to 120 nm. During the layer-by-layer deposition of CdSe films, the solvent of pyridine and 1-PrOH may damage the CdSe film prepared, which may affect the compactness of the CdSe film. Also the series resistor of the devices may increase with increasing CdSe film thickness. Furthermore, although the annealing temperature was fixed at 350 °C during the layer-by-layer sintering process, the real temperature of the ITO/ZnO/CdSe may be different (thicker CdSe film may have been at a lower temperature), which led to the different junction (CdSe/CdTe) qualities and quite different Jsc values in this case. Fig. 4c shows the EQE spectra of these devices, which show a decreased response at wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm with increasing CdSe film thickness, implying that CdTe has a better capability to transfer photons to electron–hole pairs than that of CdSe. The Jsc, Voc, FF, PCE and resistance values of the devices are summarized in Table 1. The Voc of the devices can be higher than 0.5 V when the CdSe thickness is above 30 nm. The different Voc values for devices with different thicknesses of CdSe may be explained by the following aspects. Firstly, in the case of the CdSe film with a 30 nm thickness, solvent may have damaged some part of the CdSe film when CdTe NCs solution was deposited on it, which may have resulted in the high leakage current and low Voc. On the other hand, much thicker CdSe film will reduce the light which reaches the CdTe active layer, so a CdSe film with a moderate thickness is expected to maintain high Voc and Jsc values. We should point out that the variation in FF is not consistent with the series resistance (Rs) variation in this case (Table 1). We speculate that the annealing effect on the CdTe and CdSe NC sizes, morphologies and junction qualities is still a very complicated issue, which has a great effect on the device performance, as reported in the case of PbS/ZnO solar cells.29–31 We note that the PCE is 3.5% when the CdSe thickness was above 100 nm, while only 2.71% PCE is obtained when the CdSe thickness was 120 nm. It should be noted that the best device performance was obtained in the case where a 60 nm CdSe thickness was used. The Voc, Jsc and FF values of such a device are 0.57 V, 17.43 mA cm−2 and 48.39% respectively, resulting in a high PCE of 4.86%. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest PCE value reported for a solution processed CdSe/CdTe NC heterojunction solar cell.

A moderate annealing temperature may result in good device performance by increasing Voc while keeping Jsc at a relatively high value.26 To investigate the annealing effects on the performance of CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells in the final step, we adopted different CdCl2 treatment temperatures from 300 °C to 400 °C for 10 minutes to activate the CdSe/CdTe junction while fixing the other fabrication parameters. It is generally believed that CdCl2 treatment at around 400 °C can largely increase the grain size, decrease the defects and activate the p–n junction.32 However, this is not the reality in our case due to the low melting point of the CdTe or CdSe NCs. The light and dark J–V curves of solar cells with the different CdCl2 treatment temperatures are shown in Fig. 5a–c, and the device performance is summarized in Table 2. It is clear that the device Voc and FF drop down to below 0.4 V and 41% when the CdCl2 treatment temperature was up to 360 °C, resulting in a PCE of below 3%. The device shunt resistance (Rsh) is below 100 Ω, implying that a large leakage current exists in this case. The results are different from those previously reported (ref. 9 and 18). We believe that in the case of an all NC junction device, in order to active the CdSe/CdTe junction, too high a post-annealing temperature may cause the interface of CdSe/CdTe to break down in some place, which results in a dramatic deterioration of the device performance. Similar results were also found in our previous report on a CBD-CdS/CdTe heterojunction device with the inverted structure.26 On the contrary, the devices show high Voc values (up to 0.6 V) when the CdCl2 treatment temperature was in the range of 320 °C to 350 °C in conjunction with high FF values of up to 50%, leading to PCE values of up to 4.8%. The Rsh is higher than 400 Ω cm2 in this case, in favor of forming a low leakage current. Typical dark J–V curves of devices annealed from 300 °C to 400 °C are also presented in Fig. 5b. After further optimization of the annealing temperature to 340 °C, we obtained our champion device, which displays a high Voc of 0.65 V, a prospective Jsc of 15.28 mA cm−2, an enhanced FF of 58.5% and a highly efficient PCE of 5.81%. The J–V curve is further simulated by the following formulation:  where J0 is the reverse saturation current density, Rs and Rsh are the series and parallel resistance of the device respectively, A is the device area and n is the diode factor. When we select Rs × A = 5.0 Ω, Rsh × A = 5.0 × 106 Ω, n = 1.45, kT = 0.026 eV, we find that the J–V curve simulated (solid line) from the above formula conforms to our experimental data (open circles) well. The Voc value of our device is the highest value ever reported for a CdTe NC based solar cell.33 This value is 40% higher than those of conventional CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells (ref. 12 and 20) and 5–15% higher than those of inverted CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells (ref. 24 and 25). Furthermore, the PCE value of our devices is almost two-fold higher than those of conventional CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells (ref. 12 and 20) and 50–173% higher than those of inverted CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells (ref. 24 and 25) ever reported (Table 3).

4. Conclusion
We have demonstrated novel CdTe–CdSe NC solar cells with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/CdSe/CdTe/Au fabricated by a solution process method combined with CdCl2 sintering techniques. The ZnO layer is very important to permit CdSe NC film formation with a smooth and compact structure, which eliminates device current shunting effectively. Furthermore, a moderate annealing treatment temperature (320–350 °C) is found to be sufficient enough to obtain high device performances, while over treating (using an annealing treatment temperature higher than 360 °C) exclusively makes the device shunt, resulting in a low device performance. A device with a 60 nm thickness of CdSe is promising to keep Jsc and Voc relatively high. A PCE of 5.81% is obtained in the case of CdCl2 treatment at 340 °C, which is the best result ever reported for a solution processed CdTe/CdSe NC heterojunction solar cell in air. The Voc of such a device is 0.65 V, the highest Voc among CdTe NC based solar cells ever reported. Our results imply that if a CdTe layer, a CdSe layer and their junction undergo more optimized processing and decent heat treatment, the device performance can be further increased. The exploration of this work provides valuable suggestions and solutions for CdTe/CdSe NC based solar cells.
