    , Accepted 6th August 2014First published on 7th August 2014AbstractThe formation process of CaF2 is critical for the improvement of upconversion properties of the CaF2 based upconversion photocatalysts, and for this purpose a near-infrared (NIR) photocatalyst of Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@(TiO2/CaF2)) (ETY-CTC) was synthesized. CaF2 nanocrystals are converted from CaWO4 precursors in a multi-stage process, and the remaining CaWO4 microspheres are wrapped in CaF2 and TiO2 nanocrystals to form the heterostructure of the photocatalyst. CaF2 is found to connect with TiO2 nanocrystals, instead of being coated by TiO2, resulting in a higher upconversion luminescence efficiency of ETY-CTC than that of pure Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@CaF2). ETY-CTC possesses higher photocatalytic activities compared to Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@TiO2) under NIR and UV-vis-NIR light irradiations, since more ˙OH and O2˙− radicals, and higher electron–hole separation efficiency are obtained in the ETY-CTC system. The multi-stage formation of luminescence agents can be an attractive method for the synthesis of NIR photocatalysts with enhanced upconversion properties and photocatalytic activities.
Introduction
Full-spectrum utilization of solar energy in near-infrared (NIR) photocatalysts with the aid of upconversion agents has attracted enormous attention due to their promising applications in water purification and solar cells.1 The NIR driven photocatalytic activities of upconversion photocatalysts are mainly depending on the upconversion emission efficiencies of the luminescence agents, in which fluorides with low phonon energies are commonly used as the host materials for lanthanide ions.2 CaF2 is a promising cost-effective upconversion luminescence agent for the improvement of photocatalytic activities of the NIR photocatalysts,3 while the unfavorably large-sized particles of CaF2 are obtained immediately, when Ca(NO3)2 is used as the calcium source in traditional methods during the fabrication of lanthanide ions (Yb3+, Er3+ or Tm3+) doped CaF2.3,4 Furthermore, the upconversion emission intensities of core–shell NIR photocatalysts, such as Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2),3a NaYF4:Yb, Tm/TiO2,5 NaYF4:Yb, Tm/ZnO,6 NaYF4:Yb, Tm/CdS,7 and YF3:Yb, Tm/TiO2,8 were reduced compared to those of pure fluoride agents owing to the weakened excitation light penetration caused by the semiconductor shells. The lower upconversion efficiencies in NaYF4:Yb, Er@SiO2@TiO2 (ref. 9 and 10) were also observed compared to their bare upconversion phosphors, which limited the development of solar cells with high conversion efficiencies. To solve the issues above, slow formation of upconversion luminescence agents might be one of the credible alternatives to control the particle size, and the light penetration efficiency of the NIR photocatalyst system can also be improved with a multi-stage formation process, such as self-formed upconversion luminescence agents before and after the semiconductor coatings were obtained. To identify a new Ca-containing precursor is the pre-requirement for the highly efficient CaF2 based NIR photocatalyst formation.
CaWO4 is widely used in phosphors,11 microwave dielectrics,12 and scintillators13 owing to its high density and stable physicochemical properties compared to other oxide materials.11b The W6+ ions with a large electric charge and small radius in CaWO4 can also decrease symmetries by their strong polarization.14 Thus, CaWO4 is a good oxide host material for lanthanide ions with high upconversion efficiency.15 Importantly, the low solubility product of CaWO4 (Ksp = 8.7 × 10−9) will control the release rate of Ca2+ ions,16 which provides an opportunity to place CaF2 (Ksp = 2.7 × 10−11) nanocrystals in situ on the CaWO4 microsphere surfaces (CaWO4/CaF2) continuously. The formation of lanthanide ions doped CaWO4/CaF2 will fulfill the requirements of high stability and excellent upconversion properties. Moreover, CaWO4 is a wide-bandgap semiconductor, and its coupling with TiO2 is beneficial for the charge carrier separation due to the formed heterojunction,17 which will enhance photocatalytic performances for the lanthanide ions doped CaWO4/CaF2/TiO2 systems.
In this work, a novel NIR photocatalyst of Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@(TiO2/CaF2)) (ETY-CTC) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method, and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped CaWO4 (ETY-C), Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@TiO2) (ETY-CT), Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ tridoped (CaWO4@CaF2) (ETY-CC), and ETY-CC@TiO2 (ETY-CC@T) were also fabricated simultaneously to compare their upconversion properties. The structures and morphologies of these samples were investigated, and their photocatalytic activities on the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under NIR and Ultraviolet-visible-Near Infrared (UV-vis-NIR) irradiations were tested as well.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Na2WO4·2H2O, Er(NO3)3·5H2O, Tm(NO3)3·5H2O, Yb(NO3)3·5H2O, and titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, 98%) were all purchased from Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (China) with analytical grade and they were used as received.
Preparation of CaWO4 microspheres
5 mmol of Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved into 25 mL distilled water. Then, 25 mL Ca(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.2 M) was added drop by drop into the Na2WO4 solution with continuous stirring for 30 min. The resulting mixture was maintained at room temperature for 1 h. The products were obtained by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of ETY-CTC samples
In a typical synthesis, 2 mmol of TTIP was dissolved in 20 mL absolute ethanol. CaWO4, Er(NO3)3·5H2O, Tm(NO3)3·5H2O, and Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (molar ratio of Ti4+:Ca2+:Yb3+:Er3+:Tm3+ is 1:0.3:0.2:0.02:0.02) were added into 40 mL distilled water and completely dispersed by ultrasonication. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 1 by adding nitric acid, followed by the slow addition of TTIP solution. The obtained mixture was stirred for 30 min, and 0.1 mL of HF (40%) was introduced under continuous stirring for 30 min. Then, the mixture was transferred into a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and heated at 180 °C for 12 h (Fig. 1). The precipitates collected were dried at 60 °C for 12 h after separation and washing. The obtained powders were heated at 500 °C for 4 h to form ETY-CTC samples. For comparison purposes, ETY-CC, ETY-CT, ETY-C, ETY-CC@T, and ETYN@T were also synthesized following the same procedure mentioned above.

Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), and the crystal sizes were determined through the Scherrer formula.3a The morphologies were investigated by a NoVa NanoSEM 230 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with the AZTec X-Max80 energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) instrument, and a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM) instrument. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples were determined on a nitrogen adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, ASAP 2010M + C) by N2 adsorption at 77 K. The surface analysis was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis UltraDLD), and all the binding energies were calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The absorption spectra were performed on the Lambda 750 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, and the band gap energy was calculated referring to Tauc's formula.3 Room temperature upconversion fluorescence spectra and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 980 nm semiconductor solid laser with tunable power (Table S1†). The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at room temperature with an EMX-8 ESR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp.).
Photocatalytic activities
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the decomposition of MO under 980 nm light and the NIR light (λ ≥ 780 nm) irradiations (provided by 1000 W high pressure mercury lamp with a filter). 20 mg of the samples were added in the MO aqueous solutions (20 mg L−1, 20 mL). Before irradiation, the mixtures were kept in the dark with magnetic stirring for 2 h to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Every 30 min intervals, 2.0 mL of the mixtures were collected and centrifuged. The changed absorption peak intensities at 464 nm were detected by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900). Three dimension excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra measurements were conducted using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Emission scans were preformed from 250 to 500 nm with 10 nm steps, with excitation wavelengths from 200 to 350 nm at 10 nm widths. Moreover, the photoactivity tests of ˙OH and O2˙− radicals were similar to the method mentioned for the photodegradation of MO. Terephthalic acid (TA, 4 × 10−4 M in a 2 × 10−3 M NaOH solution) and Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, 1 × 10−3 M) solutions were used to determine the amounts of ˙OH and O2˙− radicals generated from the samples, respectively.3b,18
Results and discussion
Characterization of the samples

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of ETY-CT and ETY-CTC. For ETY-CT, in addition to the detected broad diffraction peak of anatase TiO2 (PDF-#84-1285) at 25.26°, the main diffraction peaks are assigned to CaWO4 (PDF-#72-1624). The crystal phases of ETY-CTC consist of CaWO4, anatase TiO2, (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 (PDF-#87-0976), and YbF3 (PDF-#74-2178). (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 is a complex system containing two components, CaF2 and YbF3, since the Yb3+ ions take the Ca2+ lattice positions in CaF2.3 YbF3 is bound to form immediately once the HF is added into the precursor solution (Fig. 1), owing to the fact that large amount of dissociated Yb3+ ions are presented, while the Ca2+ ions have to be released slowly from CaWO4. Although there are sufficient F− ions in the solution, the complete transformation of CaF2 from CaWO4 needs a long time, i.e., five days at room temperature.16 Thus, parts of CaWO4 are maintained in the final products, which contribute to the charge carrier separation due to the formed CaWO4/TiO2 heterostructure.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of (a) ETY-CT and (b) ETY-CTC. 
According to the Scherrer formula, the average crystal sizes of TiO2, CaWO4, YbF3, and (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 in ETY-CTC are calculated to be 12.35, 45.56, 38.05, and 28.02 nm (Table S2†), respectively, exhibiting no significant difference in comparison with those of ETY-CC (Fig. S1†) and ETY-CT. It was found that the obtained crystal size of (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 was much smaller than those (90–150 nm) fabricated by the direct addition of Ca(NO3)2.3,4 Thus, the (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 nanocrystals are able to be produced in situ on CaWO4 surfaces and the remaining CaWO4 will be wrapped by CaF2 to self-assemble the core–shell structure, and their synergistic effect might provide efficient upconversion emissions.
The morphologies and microstructures of the samples are examined by SEM (Fig. 3) and TEM (Fig. 4). The initial pure CaWO4 shows the perfect solid microsphere morphology (Fig. 3a and b), which is built by many CaWO4 nanocrystals (Fig. S3†). In the case of ETY-CT (Fig. 3c), the CaWO4 microsphere structure is not being destroyed, and the three-dimensional sheet-like surfaces are coated with TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 3d). In Fig. 4a, it can be observed the CaWO4@TiO2 core–shell structure, since the lattice fringe spacings of 0.35 and 0.48 nm meet the (101) planes of TiO2 shell and the (101) planes of CaWO4 core (Fig. 4b), respectively.

With the addition of HF, the surface layers of the CaWO4 microspheres are dissolved gradually, and substituted simultaneously by the in situ formation of CaF2 layers, where ETY-CC is finally obtained (Fig. 3e and S4†). In the ETY-CTC system, most of the CaWO4 microspheres have been etched seriously, resulting in various near-spherical aggregates coated by many nanoparticles making them porous (Fig. 3f and g and Table S1†). These aggregates consist of CaWO4 cores and TiO2/(Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 coatings (Fig. 4c), and present a polycrystalline nature based on the selected-area electron diffraction pattern (top inset of Fig. 4c). A tooth-like nanoparticle (∼28 nm) is presented in Fig. 4d with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.32, which is consistent with the (111) planes of (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2, respectively, and the Fourier transform electron diffraction pattern (inset of Fig. 4d) further confirms the particle is a single crystal. Moreover, a thin sheet-like crystal of (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 is also found in Fig. 4e, where the lattice fringe spacing of 0.27 nm is close to its (200) planes.
The crystal lattices at the bottom of the tooth-like (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 crystal belong to TiO2 with (101) planes, as well as the TiO2 nanosheet overlapped with the sheet-like (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 crystal, indicating that the (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 nanocrystals are generated continuously after the TiO2 coatings formed and are, thus, present in the outermost surfaces. It is reasonable to suppose that the Ca2+ ions in CaWO4 cores can diffuse through the porous TiO2 coatings (Fig. 4c and Table S1†), and thus (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 generated can embed around the TiO2 nanocrystals. These bared (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 nanocrystals will contribute to the high upconversion emission efficiency for ETY-CTC, since there are no TiO2 layers weakening the light penetration to (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2. Furthermore, the combined TiO2 lattice and CaWO4 lattice (Fig. 4f) can also facilitate the charge carrier transmission because of the well-defined heterostructure.
The element components in ETY-CT and ETY-CTC are evaluated by EDS spectra and shown in Fig. S2a and b,† respectively. The Ti, Ca, Yb, Er, Tm, W, F, and O elements are found in ETY-CTC, and the atomic ratio of Ti:Ca:Yb:Er:Tm is 16.08:3.88:2.27:0.17:0.20 (Table S3†), which is close to its nominal atomic ratio of 1:0.3:0.2:0.02:0.02. As shown in Fig. S5a,† the survey-scan XPS spectra further demonstrate that the Ti, Ca, Yb, W, F, and O elements are present in ETY-CTC. Fig. 5a shows two peaks of Ti 2p at 458 and 463.6 eV, which match the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. The Ca 2p peaks at 346.8 and 350.3 eV correspond to Ca 2p2/3 and Ca 2p1/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively. The F 1s peak is detected at 683.9 eV (Fig. 5c), and the Yb 4d peaks at 185.7 and 199.5 eV are assigned to Yb 4d5/2 and Yb 4d3/2 (Fig. S5b†), respectively. The spin–orbit components of W 4f7/2 at 34.9 eV and W 4f5/2 at 36.9 eV are attributed to W atoms with the +6 oxidation state (Fig. 5d).17b The atomic concentration ratio of Ti:Ca:F:W:Yb is calculated to be 33.41:4.06:5.43:9.84:2.57, according to the XPS results. Thus, TiO2 is the predominant component in the outermost layers of ETY-CTC, combined with the present (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 and CaWO4 nanocrystals, which will be helpful for the NIR light harvesting and the electron–hole pair separation.

Upconversion luminescence properties
The upconversion emission spectra of ETY-C, ETY-CC, ETY-CC@T, ETY-CT, and ETY-CTC upon 980 nm light excitation are recorded in Fig. 6. As the output currents increased from 1.0 to 3.0 A, the emission spectra profiles of ETY-CC (Fig. 6a and S6a†) and ETY-CTC (Fig. 6b and S6b†) are almost unchanged, while ETY-CTC possesses higher emission intensities in the visible light wavelength range (400–700 nm) compared to those of ETY-CC (Fig. 6c), and their UV light emissions (365 and 382 nm) remain almost at the same levels. Considering the band gap energy of 2.92 eV for ETY-CTC (Table S2 and Fig. S7†), it can be inferred that the UV light is stronger absorbed by TiO2 compared to the violet light (410 nm). The upconversion luminescence peaks mainly include the red (659 nm), green (554 and 525 nm), violet (410 nm), and UV (382 nm) emissions, which are attributed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, and 4G11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively (Fig. 6c). Moreover, the blue (477 nm) and UV (365 nm) emissions correspond to the 1G4 → 3H6 and 1D2 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Upconversion luminescence spectra of (a) ETY-CC and (b) ETY-CTC under 980 nm NIR excitation with different output currents (1.0–3.0 A). (c) Upconversion luminescence spectra (inset: the UV and violet light emission spectra) of ETY-CC, ETY-CTC, ETY-CT, ETY-C, and ETY-CC@T under 980 nm NIR excitation (output current = 3.0 A). 
It should be pointed out that ETY-CTC exhibits a better upconversion property compared to those of ETY-CT, ETY-C, ETY-CC@T, and even the pure ETY-CC (Fig. 6c and S8†), except for the 365 and 382 nm UV light absorbed by TiO2. Based on the previously reported NIR core–shell photocatalysts,3a,5–10 all of their upconversion emission intensities are lower than those of pure luminescence agents, due to the barriers of the semiconductor shells and the weakened excitation light penetration. There are also some different cases, where the upconversion properties of NIR photocatalysts are not decreased in the emission wavelength of 250–700 nm, in addition to the absorbed parts,19 while in the longer wavelength, such as the 800 nm, the emission intensity of Tm3+ is still unknown. The main reason might be related to the surface morphologies and the thickness of the semiconductor shells. Nevertheless, the semiconductor shells, such as TiO2, ZnO, and CdS, are different from the CaF2 or NaYF4 passivation shells with excellent optical transparency to greatly improve the upconversion emission intensities.20 With increasing the light scattering by the used semiconductor shells, the NIR light penetration to the upconversion luminescence agent cores will be often more or less weakened. To reduce the loss of the excitation light penetration rate, a special structure is formed in the ETY-CTC system, where the (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2.2 nanocrystals located at the outermost surfaces are not fully coated by TiO2 (Fig. 4), resulting in sufficient exciting light harvesting to produce strong upconversion emission intensity. Taking the fabrication process of ETY-CC and ETY-CTC into account, the distribution of Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions has been changed by the additional TiO2 coatings. According to the surface compositions estimated from the XPS analysis (Table S3†), the atomic ratios of Ca:F:W:Yb are 1:1.34:2.42:0.63 for ETY-CTC and 1:1.65:0.27:0.25 for ETY-CC. The increase of Yb3+ content in the surface layer of ETY-CTC can absorb more 980 nm light energy,20b,21 which will transfer more energy to Er3+ and Tm3+ ions to generate higher emission intensity compared to ETY-CC. The Er3+ and Tm3+ quench effect can also be reduced in the outermost layers of ETY-CTC, since they can be well-separated by the TiO2 nanocrystals and the Yb3+ ions in high concentration.4 Moreover, the surface quenching effect may be suppressed in ETY-CTC, due to the modulation through TiO2 coatings.22 Other decisive factors may be related to the suitably increased coating thickness and the changed morphologies.23 On the other hand, owing to the multi-stage formed CaF2 agents, the obtained NIR photocatalyst ETY-CTC still possesses an excellent upconversion property compared to ETY-CC, and it is the guarantee of high NIR light driven photocatalytic activities.
Photocatalytic activities
The photocatalytic activities of ETY-CT and ETY-CTC are tested and compared in MO decomposition experiments under 980 nm and NIR light (λ ≥ 780 nm) irradiations. As shown in Fig. S9,† the maximum absorbance of MO at 464 nm decreased steadily over ETY-CTC as the irradiation time increased to 180 min, and higher degradation rates of 20.29% and 46.57% were obtained using 980 nm and NIR light irradiations (Fig. 7), followed by ETY-CT with 12.69% and 38.23%, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. S10† that there is no MO degradation in the absence of photocatalysts, and neither the pure TiO2 nor CaWO4 has photocatalytic activity under NIR light irradiation. In addition, ETY-CC@T also shows low degradation rates of 9.17% and 33.69% under 980 nm and NIR light driven conditions (Fig. S12†), respectively, due to its large decreased upconversion emission intensity and the inert TiO2 shells without active centers (Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+) compared to those of ETY-CTC.3a
 Fig. 7  
C/C0 conversion plots of MO for ETY-CT and ETY-CTC under (a) 980 nm (output current = 2.0 A) and (b) NIR light (≥780 nm) irradiations. 
In the ETY-CTC system, Yb3+ ions absorb the NIR light and transfer energy to Er3+ and Tm3+ ions to emit UV (365 and 382 nm) and violet (410 nm) light (Fig. 8), which enables the excitation of TiO2 to produce oxidative valance band (VB) holes (h+) and reductive conduction band (CB) electrons (e−). To elucidate the heterostructure between CaWO4 and TiO2, their relative band edge positions are investigated through the following equation: ECB = X − E0 − 0.5Eg.24X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductors (for TiO2, X = 5.81 eV;25 for CaWO4, X = 7.045 eV)17a, E0 is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor (for TiO2, Eg = 2.83 eV;3a for CaWO4, Eg = 4.09 eV).17a The ECB values of TiO2 and CaWO4 are calculated to be −0.105 and 0.5 eV, respectively, and the corresponding EVB values are 2.725 and 4.59 eV for TiO2 and CaWO4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, the generated electron can be transferred from the CB of TiO2 to the lower CB edge of CaWO4, and thus the electron–hole pair separation is promoted. Then, the ˙OH radicals can be generated through the reaction between holes and the surface adsorbed H2O, and electrons can be scavenged by the surface adsorbed O2 to yield O2˙− radicals.26 It was found that the production of both ˙OH and O2˙− radicals increased linearly as the irradiation time extended (Fig. 10a and b, S16 and 17†). ETY-CTC has a stronger ability to produce both ˙OH and O2˙− radicals, and a better decomposition performance is displayed compared to ETY-CT.
 Fig. 8  Schematic electronic band structure and electron–hole pair separation of ETY-CTC under NIR light irradiation. 
In the photocatalytic degradation process, the chromophoric azo group (–NN–) of MO molecules (Fig. S13†) can be attacked and destroyed by the ˙OH and O2˙− radicals, producing aromatic intermediates and further forming various low molecular weight byproducts before mineralizing.27Fig. 9 shows the EEM spectra of MO over ETY-CTC with different NIR light irradiation time. Before irradiation, the MO solution mainly contained one fluorescence peak at excitation/emission wavelengths Ex/Em = 220–250 nm/330–350 nm (Fig. 9a), which represented aromatic-like compounds.28 As the NIR light irradiation time extended, the peak intensity of aromatic-like compounds increased gradually (Fig. 9b–d), and two other fluorescence peaks were displayed clearly at Ex/Em = 230–250/390–440 nm and 290–320/400–430 nm. These new peaks may be attributed to phototransformation intermediates, such as hydroxy derivatives.28a Based on the enhanced fluorescence peaks, it can be inferred that decolorization is the predominant reaction, and the mineralization of MO has not yet occurred during the use of NIR light irradiation time (∼180 min).
 Fig. 9  EEM fluorescence spectra of MO for ETY-CTC under NIR light irradiation: (a) 0 min, (a) 30 min, (a) 120 min, and (a) 180 min. 
The photocatalytic activities are further evaluated under UV-vis-NIR irradiation (Fig. S11 and S12†). In the first irradiation for 30 min, the degradation rates of ETY-CTC, ETY-CT, and ETY-CC@T are 91.69%, 84.77%, and 58.71%, respectively, consistent with the NIR-driven photocatalytic results. A benefit from the incorporation of CaF2 is that the PL emission intensity of ETY-CTC is lower than that of ETY-CT (Fig. 10c), indicating its better electron–hole separation ability, which is responsible for the higher photocatalytic activities compared to ETY-CT. The UV-vis-NIR driven EEM spectra of MO over ETY-CTC are shown in Fig. S14,† and they are very different from those obtained under NIR light irradiation. The complete decolorization and partial mineralization reactions have occurred in the initial irradiation of 30 min (Fig. S14b†), and the purity of the solution obtained after 180 min (Fig. S14d†) is close to the distilled water used in this study (Fig. S15†).
 Fig. 10  Photocatalytic activities for the (a) ˙OH and (b) O2˙− production under 980 nm light irradiation (output current = 2.0 A). (c) PL emission spectra excited at 300 nm at room temperature and (d) ESR spectra for ETY-CT and ETY-CTC. 
The broad PL spectra of the samples include several emission peaks. Accordingly, the 396 nm peak is emitted by CaWO4,11a and the 412 nm peak is attributed to defect levels near the valence band of TiO2.29 The emission peaks at 452, 470, 484, and 494 nm are associated with oxygen defects, representing the different types of charged (F, or F+ centers) oxygen vacancy states.30 Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies of the samples are characterized by ESR spectroscopy (Fig. 10d), and the symmetry ESR signal located at g = 1.9965 is assigned to oxygen vacancy, and no Ti3+ (g = 1.965, 1.938, and 1.916) or O2− (g = 2.02) signals can be measured.31 With the addition of CaF2, the ESR signals of ETY-CTC are stronger than those of ETY-CT, and the increased oxygen vacancies can be considered electron traps to enhance the electron–hole pair separations.32 The oxygen vacancies can also react with the absorbed O2 to generate bridging O2 dimers,33 which contribute to the photocatalytic activity for the NIR photocatalysts.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a heterostructured NIR photocatalyst, ETY-CTC, was synthesized, in which CaF2 nanocrystals were slowly fabricated from CaWO4 precursors and embedded in CaWO4 surfaces, while the remaining CaWO4 microspheres were wrapped in CaF2 and TiO2 nanocrystals to form the heterostructure. Benefitting from this special structure, ETY-CTC exhibits a better upconversion property compared to those of ETY-C, ETY-CT, ETY-CC@T, and even to the pure ETY-CC luminescence agent. Under NIR and UV-vis-NIR light irradiations, ETY-CTC has higher MO degradation rates compared to ETY-CT, owing to the enhanced upconversion property, the increased electron–hole separation efficiency, and the enhanced oxygen vacancy signals in the ETY-CTC system.
