Introduction
Light extraction from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has attracted considerable research interest in recent years.1–17 At a certain luminance level, high efficiency means low power consumption, low driving current and thus long operation lifetime, which is very important for practical applications. However, in a typical OLED, only ∼20% of the internally generated photons can escape from the structure, while the remaining ∼80% photons are trapped and waveguided by the organic/ITO and glass due to the total internal reflection (TIR) at the glass–air and ITO–glass interface.1–8 To extract these waveguide light, the TIR has to be eliminated or reduced. A variety of methods, such as employing a high refractive index substrate,2,3 patterning a microlens array,2–7 and roughening or texturing the glass substrate,8–13 have been proposed to suppress the TIR. Among these methods, scattering the waveguide light by using a diffusing film is one of the simplest and most cost-effective solutions. Conventionally, to make a scattering film, various particles, such as silica or poly-microspheres,11,12 ZrO2 (ref. 13,14 ) or TiO2 (ref. 15), are thoroughly distributed into a host solution like PDMS resin or transparent photoresist, followed by spin-coating the mixture onto the substrate. The multi-step fabrication processes, including (1) mixing the particles with the host solution, (2) spin-coating and (3) curing, may be somewhat complex. Also, it is difficult to distribute the particles uniformly due to the agglomeration of the particles. Furthermore, the wet solution processing limits them for directly serving as an internal or external scattering media for the top-emitting OLEDs.14,16,17 It is thus desirable to develop a one-step and dry processing method for fabricating the scattering films.
Crystallization of organic materials usually results in a rough surface due to the nano-aggregation of the molecules.17–21 Such a change of morphology is detrimental for the reliability of the OLEDs, as it causes film discontinuity, cathode delamination and dark spot formation.18–21 Considerable research efforts have been devoted to synthesizing high glass-transition-temperature (Tg) materials to prevent the crystallization of the organic thin films at low temperature. Although low Tg materials find themselves useless or even harmful when serving as active layers for devices, they are perfect candidates for making scattering films due to their “adverse” effect of nano-aggregation at low temperature. In this work, we have facilely fabricated a scattering film by one-step vacuum sublimation of a low Tg organic material, tetraphenylethene (TPE). The TPE was employed as the building block for constructing novel highly efficient solid emitters with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics, previously.22–28 In this work, we found that the TPE molecules crystallize themselves immediately as soon as they reach the substrate. Closer observation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) finds that the TPE molecules assemble themselves in the form of nanoparticles. These nanoparticles scatter the light effectively. The one-step vacuum sublimation process permits them to directly act as an internal or external scattering media for various optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells or LEDs. Initial attempts show that a 28% efficiency improvement can be obtained by employing the as-deposited TPE nanoparticles as scattering media for blue OLEDs. By further co-evaporating the TPE and its derivative 4-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)-7-(5-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTPETTD) as a color conversion and light scattering layer for blue OLEDs, the blue-to-white photon conversion efficiency of the resultant white OLEDs has been enhanced from 52.7% to 70.1%, representing a 33% improvement.
Experimental
TPE was readily obtained by a one-step McMurry reaction. The synthesis methods for TPE and BTPETTD were reported in ref. 22 and 23, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the molecular structure of the TPE and BTPETTD. The TPE scattering films were prepared on a glass substrate using a thermal evaporator with a base pressure of 5 × 10−7 Torr. The morphology of the TPE scattering films was investigated using a JEOL-JSM-6490 SEM. The haze of the scattering films was determined by measuring the total transmission and specular transmission using a UV-VIS spectrometer and an integrating sphere. TPE or TPE:BTPETTD scattering films were grown on the back side of the glass substrate as the scattering media for the blue OLEDs. The OLEDs were fabricated in a multi-source vacuum chamber at a base pressure of around 5 × 10−7 Torr with structure glass/ITO/NPB (40 nm)/8% BcZVBi:CBP (20 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), (ITO: indium-tin-oxide; NPB: N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine; BCzVBi: 4,4′-bis(9-ethyl-3-carbazovinylene)-1,1′-biphenyl; CBP: 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl; TPBi: 2,2′,2"-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole)). The EL spectra were measured on a PR650 spectrometer. The current density–voltage–luminance characteristics of the devices were measured by a HP4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer and a calibrated UDT PIN-25D silicon photodiode. The luminance and external quantum efficiency of the devices were inferred from the photocurrent of the photodiode.
Results and discussion
A 300 nm TPE thin film was thermally deposited on a glass substrate with a low source heating temperature of 35–40 °C and a deposition rate of 2–3 Å s−1. A 50 nm SiO2 layer was subsequently deposited on top of the TPE to protect the TPE from mechanical, chemical or thermal damage. The SEM image as displayed in Fig. 1a shows that the as-deposited TPE film is composed of numerous particles with the size ranging from hundreds of nanometers to one micron, indicating that the TPE molecules aggregate themselves in the form of particles, probably via π–π and/or van der Waals interactions. Such aggregation occurs immediately, as soon as the TPE molecules reach the substrate, which is mainly due to the low Tg of TPE (the Tg of TPE is not detected, probably due to its low molecular weight). At room temperature, the TPE molecules may acquire enough thermal energy to adjust their position and fit themselves into their crystalline lattice. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for other low Tg materials such as TPD or BCP.17,20,21 The aggregation/crystallization of those low Tg materials often causes device failure, making them useless or even harmful when serving as the active layers. However, on the positive side of view, nano-aggregation of those molecules can induce a scattering effect; thus a scattering film is achievable by simply depositing the low Tg materials. As shown in Fig. 1b, due to the strong light scattering induced by the TPE particles, the as-deposited films exhibit a milky appearance. To characterize the light scattering ability of the films, the total transmission and specular transmission were measured; then the haze that indicates what percentage of light is scattered is calculated by HAZE = (Ttotal − Tspecular)/Ttotal. Fig. 2 shows the total transmission of the TPE films as measured by using an integrating sphere combined with a UV-VIS spectrometer. Thanks to TPE being absorption-free in the visible wavelength region (inset of Fig. 2), the film exhibits a high total transmission of ∼90%. However, the specular transmission is only 45% at 450 nm, remarkably lower than the total transmission. In this case, the calculated haze is 50%, indicating that half of the light is scattered by the TPE particles. Because of the strong wavelength dependence (∼λ−4) of the Rayleigh scattering,29 the blue light is scattered much more than the red light; hence the haze in the short wavelength region is higher than that in the long wavelength region.

Prompted by the strong light scattering ability of the TPE particles, we then explore its possibility of serving as a brightness enhancement layer for OLEDs. A 300 nm TPE film, a 200 nm BTPETTD film, and a 200 nm BTPETTD mixed with 200 nm TPE film were deposited on the back side of a glass substrate as the light scattering and/or color conversion media for the blue OLEDs. The device structures are shown in Fig. 3. Previously, we showed that by capping a 240 nm BTPETTD with a high fluorescent quantum efficiency of 55% on top of the top-emitting blue OLEDs, a part of the blue emission is absorbed and subsequently converted into red emission by BTPETTD via the PL process; the mixing of the unabsorbed blue emission and the converted red emission results in white emission.30 The combination of the blue OLEDs and the color conversion layer offers an easy means to achieve white emission with extremely high color stability.30–32 However, due to the large index mismatching of BTPETTD (n ≈ 1.8) and air (n = 1), most light suffers from TIR and therefore is waveguided by the BTPETTD, leading to a low conversion efficiency. Such waveguided light can be out-coupled to the air if certain scattering media are employed. By introducing the TPE particles into the BTPETTD matrix via co-evaporating, the originally smooth surface becomes rough with the emergence of uniformly distributed TPE particles, as evidenced by the SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d. The mixed TPE:BTPETTD film would thus work simultaneously as a color conversion and a light enhancement layer for the blue OLEDs.
 Fig. 3  Device structures (top) and molecular structures of the TPE and BTPETTD (bottom). A 300 nm TPE scattering film, a 200 nm BTPETTD film, and a 200 nm BTPETTD mixed with a 200 nm TPE film were deposited on the back side of the glass substrate to serve as the light scattering and/or color conversion layer for the blue OLEDs. 
To verify the color conversion ability of the BTPETTD, the electroluminescent (EL) spectra of the devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a good overlap between the absorption spectra of BTPETTD and the EL spectra of BcZVBi, signifying that BTPETTD can effectively absorb the EL emission of BcZVBi and convert it into its own photoluminescent (PL) emission. The mixing of the EL and PL emission can therefore result in a white emission. Indeed, by depositing 200 nm BTPETTD on the back side of the substrate, the original blue emission is converted into white emission, with the CIE coordinates changing from (0.16, 0.25) to (0.30, 0.41). The resultant white spectra exhibit a very high color stability over a wide range of driving voltage since the color conversion process is voltage independent. Very stable spectra at different viewing angle were also observed as the scattering process does not change the angular distribution of the OLED emission.8
 Fig. 4  Absorption, PL spectra of BTPETTD and EL spectra of the blue OLEDs and white OLEDs. A good overlap between the absorption spectra of BTPETTD and the EL spectra of the blue OLEDs indicates an effective color down-conversion process can happen. The mixing of the unconverted blue emission and the converted red emission generates a white emission with very high color stability. 
To evaluate the efficiency enhancement induced by the TPE particles, the current density–voltage–luminance and efficiency–current density characteristics of the devices were tested. As shown in Fig. 5, all devices exhibit identical current density–voltage characteristics since the external substrate modification layer does not alter the electrical characteristics of the devices. However, the devices with TPE particles show a remarkably higher luminance/efficiency than those without the particles, which is attributed to the effective extraction of the substrate waveguide light by the TPE particles. For example, at a driving current density of 10 mA cm−2, the blue OLEDs with TPE particles exhibit a luminance of 1011 cd m−2 and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.28%, substantially higher than 791 cd m−2 and 4.12% for the devices with a bare glass substrate and represent a 28% improvement. Fig. 5b inset shows the photos of the blue OLEDs with and without the TPE particles. Obviously, with the TPE particles, the forward emission is brighter while the edge emission becomes dimmer, indicating the effective conversion of the substrate waveguide light into the forward emission.
 Fig. 5  (a) Current density–voltage–luminance and (b) efficiency–current density characteristics of the devices. Inset of (b): photos of the blue OLEDs with and without the TPE scattering film. With the TPE scattering film, the OLEDs exhibit a higher luminance and efficiency due to the effective extraction of the substrate waveguide light. 
We then evaluate the efficiency enhancement of the devices with the color conversion layer. With a 200 nm BTPETTD color conversion layer, the luminance and EQE at a driving current density of 10 mA cm−2 have been reduced from 791 cd m−2, 4.12% to 516 cd m−2, 2.17%, representing a blue-to-white photon conversion efficiency of 52.7%. The remarkably reduced luminance and efficiency are mainly due to the conversion loss and significant TIR at the interface of BTPETTD–air. By mixing the BTPETTD with TPE particles, the BTPETTD/glass waveguide light is effectively outcoupled, resulting in an enhanced luminance and EQE of 680 cd m−2 and 2.89%, respectively. With the TPE particles, the blue-to-white photon conversion efficiency has been enhanced from 52.7% to 70.1%, representing a 33% improvement. The key performance of the devices is listed in Table 1. The devices with the TPE:BTPETTD exhibit a higher efficiency improvement of 33% compared with 28% for the devices with TPE, which is probably due to the stronger TIR at the BTPETTD–air interface than that at the glass–air interface. The one-step vacuum sublimed TPE particles demonstrated here thus can effectively suppress the TIR and extract the waveguide light for enhancing the luminance and efficiency of the OLEDs.

Conclusions
In summary, TPE scattering films have been easily fabricated by the one-step vacuum sublimation of TPE powder. The TPE molecules aggregate themselves in the form of particles at room temperature, which is probably due to their low Tg. Due to the strong scattering effect induced by the particles, the OLED substrate waveguide light is extracted effectively. Initial attempts show that a maximum efficiency improvement of 33% can be achieved by employing the TPE particles as the scattering media. Our work shows that aggregation/crystallization of low Tg organic materials is not always harmful for the devices. On the contrary, scattering films can be easily obtained by utilizing this property. The one-step vacuum sublimed scattering films can find a wide variety of applications in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and LEDs.
