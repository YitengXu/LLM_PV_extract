    , Accepted 4th July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractIn the present study, an enhanced solar light harvesting strategy based on the wavelength conversion effect is suggested for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Incorporating β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals as a component of the DSSCs enables wavelength conversion from infrared to visible light, which maximizes the absorption of visible light by the C106 organometallic dye and produces excess current, thus enhancing the quantum efficiency. It is demonstrated that the photocurrent density generated is increased by the wavelength conversion effect of the phosphor material. The introduction of up-converting β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals dispersed in an iodide electrolyte and the use of an additional phosphor reflecting film increases the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) from 9.02% of reference DSSCs to 9.48 and 10.76%, respectively. DSSCs with phosphors contained in both the iodide electrolyte solution as well as an additional phosphor reflecting film show a highly enhanced overall efficiency of 10.90%. Herein, a strategy for effective wavelength conversion is investigated for enhanced solar light harvesting, and the results of the study contribute the most viable strategy for achieving maximum utilization of the solar spectrum.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work on electrochemical junction solar cells by the research groups of O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 their strategy for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 films has been recognized as a standard technique.2–5 Systematic components such as dye molecules, semiconductor photoanodes, and electrolytes have an effect on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. DSSCs are now being recognized as prospective photovoltaic energy generation devices in the field of photovoltaic solar cells due to their highly enhanced efficiency in recent reports.6–8 Depending on the components and structure of DSSCs, the photovoltaic performance is affected by the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), charge separation efficiency (ηcs), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc).2–5 These factors are measured in terms of the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), and are used in determining the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η). Since nearly 100% ηcs has already been achieved in DSSCs, ηlh and ηcc are regarded as factors that can be improved to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.2–5 In addition, ηlh is most closely related to Jsc, and determines the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
To increase ηlh in photovoltaics, several approaches such as combining composite materials,9 introducing a light scattering layer,10,11 using dual-functionalized materials,12–15 and panchromatic absorption have been studied.16–18 In addition, ruthenium(II)-based organometallic molecules have been developed for use as dyes to absorb light in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm with high absorption coefficients.19–22 These tremendous efforts have been focused on the enhancement of ηlh in the range of the visible spectrum. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited in their ability to enhance the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) radiation, which constitute over 60% of the solar spectrum.23–26 Strategies for enhancing the absorption of the UV and IR portions of the solar spectrum have received little attention for efficient DSSC performance.
An effective alternate approach is to modify the solar wavelength spectrum available for absorption by the dye molecules, through wavelength conversion, using phosphor materials.23,26 Introducing a phosphor material to modify the solar spectrum to be absorbed by the dye molecules is an outstanding strategy for utilizing the solar photon energy in the UV and NIR range.27–30 The first theoretical study on utilizing a phosphor material for improving the solar cell performance was reported by Trupke et al. and the results of the study indicated that wavelength conversion of the solar spectrum would be a promising solution for improving ηlh of the DSSCs.31–34 Phosphor materials can convert a portion of the solar spectrum into different bands of spectrum via three types of photon luminescence conversion processes, namely up-conversion, down-conversion, and downshifting. The high-energy part of the spectrum can be converted into lower energy wavelength in the down-conversion as well as downshifting process. However, the up-conversion process converts the low-energy part of the solar spectrum into higher energy wavelength.27–30 Combinations of up-conversion materials for photovoltaic applications have attracted attention in solar cell research, because solar light contains over 55% IR radiation. Improved DSSC performances by employing phosphor materials for wavelength conversion have been reported in recent papers.35 Most of the reports so far have demonstrated improved DSSC performance by applying phosphors at a single position. However, the wavelength conversion effect of phosphor materials in DSSCs continues to be controversial, since there is an opinion that the wavelength conversion might be caused by the light scattering effect. Furthermore, most of the studies have been focused on enhancing solar light absorption using a combination of N719 dye and phosphor materials.36–39
In this work, based on our previous report on the successful introduction of downshifting phosphors into DSSCs,26 we suggest a facile strategy to improve solar light harvesting of photovoltaics by combining the wavelength conversion effect exhibited by up-conversion β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals with the C106 organometallic dye, which shows the best light-harvesting performance among new-generation high-absorption-coefficient dyes as shown in Fig. S1 (in the ESI†).40,41 To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first multi-position application of phosphors in DSSCs, including up-conversion phosphors loaded onto TiO2-nanoparticle films, dispersed in an iodide electrolyte and a back-reflecting phosphor film, for achieving the best light-harvesting performance. In DSSCs containing phosphors positioned both in the iodide electrolyte solution and an additional phosphor reflecting film, Jsc values from 18.89 of the reference DSSC to 24.54 mA cm−2 were produced. In this study, advanced DSSCs with β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals have been fabricated and the performances of DSSCs with and without phosphors have been compared. This study is expected to lead to a viable strategy for maximizing solar light harvesting.
Experimental section
Fabrication of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals and back-reflection films
β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were synthesized using the hydrothermal method based on Li's work, with some modifications.42–44 Y(NO3)3·4H2O (1.6 mmol), Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (0.36 mmol), and Er(NO3)3·5H2O (0.04 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water. Following this, 4 mmol of sodium citrate was added to the solution and white precipitates were observed in the solution. Upon vigorous stirring for 30 min, the solution became transparent, after which 26 mmol of NaF was added to produce white precipitates. After further stirring for 30 min, the pH was controlled to achieve acidic conditions by adding 1.0 M HNO3 solution. The solution was transferred into a 100 mL teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, tightly sealed, and maintained at 200 °C for 20 h in an electrical heating-oven. Subsequently, the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature (RT). The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Finally, the product was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h.
Up-conversion phosphor back-reflection (UCBR) films were prepared using a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-induced manual assembly method with minor modifications.45,46 PEI solutions (1.5 mL; 4 wt%) in ethanol were spin-coated on cleaned (2 × 2) cm fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates at a speed of 2000 rpm for 10 s. The β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were then gently rubbed on the PEI-coated FTO glass substrates. The as-prepared films were then heat-treated at 450 °C for 4 h in air. Ethanol phosphor solutions (3.5 mg mL−1) were dispersed by dropping 0.185 mL of the solutions on the phosphor monolayer-coated glass substrates and dried at 70 °C. A cycle of coating consisted of the phosphor dispersion by dropping 0.185 mL of the prepared ethanol solution. In order to remove PEI and any organic impurities, the films were heat-treated at 450 °C for 4 h in an Ar atmosphere. By increasing the number of dispersion cycles (26 cycles), different thicknesses of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ up-converting back-reflection films were obtained.
Assembly of DSSCs with β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals
The assembly of DSSCs was based on Prof. Kang's report.47 To prepare the TiO2-film electrodes, FTO glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC 7) were sequentially cleaned with Hellmanex solution, distilled water, and ethanol for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath. The photoelectrode was fabricated by spin-coating 0.1 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato)-diisopropoxide solution (Aldrich) in 1-butanol (1-BuOH, 99.8%, Aldrich) onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate and heating at 450 °C for 30 min. A TiO2-nanoparticle film layer (nTF, thickness, ∼8 μm) was fabricated on the FTO glass by the doctor blade technique using commercial TiO2 paste with an average 18 nm particle size (JGC C&C, PST-18NR paste). The TiO2 scattering layer (thickness, ∼4 μm) was sequentially loaded using commercial TiO2 paste with an average 400 nm particle size (JGC C&C, PST-400C paste). After sintering the TiO2-coated FTO glass substrate at 450 °C for 30 min, it was treated with a 0.5 mM titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) solution for 20 min at 70 °C, following which an annealing process was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. To prepare the up-conversion phosphor loaded on TiO2 film (UCTF), an aqueous solution of the microcrystal product (2.5 mL, 0.25 wt%) was dropped 5 times directly onto the surface of the TiO2 scattering layer (active layer was 0.16 cm2 in area) and the TiO2 film loaded with the microcrystals was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. Each working electrode was dipped into 0.5 mM of the C106 dye (Dyesol) dissolved in acetonitrile (99.9%, Wako) and tert-butanol (99%, Wako) (v/v, 1:1) for 18 h at RT. The electrodes were washed with acetonitrile to remove residues and were then dried.
Electrolytes composed of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII, ≥ 98%, Aldrich), 0.03 M iodine (I2, ≥ 99.8%, Aldrich), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 96%, Aldrich), 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI, 99.9%, Aldrich), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN, ≥ 97%, Aldrich) were dissolved in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (VN, 99.5%, Aldrich) (v/v, 85:15). To prepare the up-conversion phosphors dispersed in iodide electrolyte solution (UCEL), 0.06 g of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals was dispersed homogeneously at 50 °C for 1 h into 2 mL of the aforementioned electrolyte solution to obtain a 4 wt% solution. The platinum counter electrode was spin-coated with 0.1 M chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 8 wt% in H2O, Aldrich), which was dissolved in 2-propanol (Aldrich), and was calcinated at 450 °C for 30 min. The working and counter electrodes were both assembled using 60 μm of hot-melted Surlyn (Solaronix).
Results and discussion
β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-rod crystals were hydrothermally synthesized using sodium citrate as a chelating agent.42–44 Typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the crystal structure of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor crystals along with the lattice distance calculations are shown in Fig. 1 and S2.† The HRTEM and SAED patterns viewed along the [100] direction show that the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals grew along the [001] direction as the c-axis. A well-defined microcrystal in a representative micro-rod exhibited a length of ∼7.8 μm and a diameter of ∼0.86 μm. The corresponding elemental mapping images indicate that Yb3+ and Er3+ ions were spatially dispersed in the NaYF4 host crystal structure. Based on the relationship between the initial pH and the charge on citrate, it was determined that the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor micro-rod crystals grew at pH 3.13, where crystal growth along the [001] direction is much faster than that in the other directions, which resulted in the formation of [001]-oriented micro-rod crystals.48 This result is also consistent with the dominant peak intensity of the (100) axis observed in the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2 and S3.† In addition to the [001] growth direction, the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals also grew to some extent along six energetically equivalent {100} side facets [(100), (010), (010), (010), (100), and (100)], as shown in the XRD patterns of pristine β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor micro-rod crystals.

Anatase TiO2 (PDF#841285) and β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ (PDF#281192) were used. 
To achieve up-conversion emission, the β-NaYF4 host lattice crystals were doped with a sensitizer (Yb3+) and an activator (Er3+). Since Yb3+ and Er3+ ions were intercalated into the β-NaYF4 host lattice crystals, the peak positions of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals shifted to lower 2θ angles (PDF#281192, space group: P63/m), compared to the values provided in the standard JCPDS card of pristine β-NaYF4 microcrystals without Yb3+ and Er3+ (PDF#160334, space group: P63/m).49 The peak of (100) shows a negligible lattice difference in pure and doped β-NaYF4 of 0.002 nm.
The as-synthesized β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were introduced onto the spherical TiO2 particle layer as a photoanode (UCTF), by dispersing the microcrystals in the electrolyte solution (UCEL). In addition, the microcrystals were cast as a back-reflecting film (UCBR) in the DSSCs. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2-nanoparticle-film electrode (nTF, which was used as a reference electrode), up-conversion phosphor on the TiO2-nanoparticle-film (UCTF) photoanode and up-conversion phosphor film for the back-reflecting (UCBR) plate. The XRD patterns indicate that the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were successfully loaded on the nTF. The {100}-orientated β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ film on the transparent glass was employed as the back-reflection film via the PEI-induced manual assembly technique.45,46 The as-synthesized β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were assembled as UCBR with ∼30 μm film thickness, as shown in Fig. S4.†
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals, UCTF, and the up-conversion phosphor dispersed in the iodide electrolyte solution (UCEL) were compared and results are shown in Fig. 3. Upon excitation in the wavelength range of 900–1050 nm (Fig. S5†), the PL spectra of pristine β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals, UCTF, and UCEL showed two strong luminescence bands at 510–560 nm and 640–675 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), respectively. The top images in Fig. 3(a) are the optical microscopic images of pristine β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals acquired with an exposure time of 0.01 s. Similarly, bright field optical microscopic images (top) and PL spectrum (bottom) of phosphor deposited on TiO2-nanoparticle films are shown in Fig. 3(b).
 Fig. 3  (a) PL spectra of pristine β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals, (b) phosphors on TiO2 nanoparticle films (UCTF), and (c) phosphor microcrystals dispersed in the electrolyte (UCEL). 
In the top image of Fig. 3(c), the emission color of UCEL is compared with that of the pristine electrolyte. As is evident from Fig. 3, no emission was observed from the electrolyte. Since the PL spectra were results of the energy transfer from Yb3+ (sensitizer) to Er3+ (activator) in the NaYF4 host material lattice, the light emitted at both 510–560 nm and 640–675 nm was in the absorption range of the C106 organometallic dye.40,41 From absorption and emission spectra of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals, the quantum efficiency (QE) was calculated to be 2.98% using eqn (1) (Fig. 4).50,51 (1)
 Fig. 4  PL spectra dependence on power density of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals. (a) PL spectra and (b) log(UC intensity) vs. log(power density) graph. 
Here, the number of excited photons was calculated from [(PL area under the curve of excitation spectra)reference × (1/% reflectance)reference × (% reflectance)sample] and the number of emitted photons was calculated from (PL area under the curve of emission spectra)sample. The reference is aluminium foil and the sample is the up-conversion phosphor.
As shown in Fig. 4, the efficiency of the up-conversion process was determined as a dependence on power density. The emission intensity curve increases as the power density increases to around 10 W cm−2. Considering this result, it would be expected that this phosphor microcrystal produces constant QE under indoor application of DSSCs. From the XRD patterns, microscopic images, and PL spectra, it may be concluded that the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were well-incorporated into the DSSC components as UCTF and UCEL. The significantly increased intensity of the 510–560 nm and 640–675 nm luminescence bands in the cases of UCTF and UCEL, respectively, is expected to be a key factor in enhancing solar light harvesting via the wavelength conversion effect. Our hypothesis on UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB (simultaneously applied UCEL and UCBR) was verified for the photovoltaic performance measurements, which are shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the locations of the wavelength conversion phosphor microcrystals on TiO2 film (a, UCTF), phosphor dispersed in the electrolyte (b, UCEL), back-reflecting film (c, UCBR), and phosphors both dispersed in the electrolyte as well as introduced in the back-reflecting film (d, UCEB). 
To determine the ηlh as a result of wavelength conversion, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were introduced into the DSSCs and the optimal positions of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals in the DSSCs are illustrated in Scheme 1. β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were loaded on the TiO2-nanoparticle-film (UCTF, Scheme 1(a)) and dispersed in the iodide electrolyte (UCEL, Scheme 1(b)). A {100}-orientated β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor film was employed as a UCBR, which was an external component, as shown in Scheme 1(c). For achieving an integrated wavelength conversion effect, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were simultaneously dispersed in the iodide electrolyte and used as UCEB, as shown in Scheme 1(d).

Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of nTF, UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB measured under 1-sun and IR range conditions. The Jsc of UCEL was 20.38 mA cm−2, which was distinguishable from the value of 18.89 mA cm−2 obtained for nTF. The Voc values of UCEL and nTF were 0.712 V and 0.726 V, respectively. Interestingly, when the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ film was utilized as UCBR, Jsc increased to 22.73 mA cm−2, which was higher than the corresponding value for nTF. Since the Jsc of the UCBR film increased and the initial value of Voc was retained, this external reflection film is a promising option for enhancing light-harvesting in DSSCs. This finding indicates that the increase in the Jsc value originated predominantly from the reflected illumination and not from wavelength conversion, when β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor was used as an external film on the back side. Unexpectedly, when the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were simultaneously applied as UCEL and UCBR in the DSSCs (UCEB), the photocurrent densities of the DSSCs drastically increased, even as the initial Voc value was retained. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Jsc value of UCEB increased from 18.89 to 24.54 mA cm−2 for nTF, while Voc remained at 0.714 V. There was no significant change in FF. It is interesting to note that the remarkable difference between nTF as a reference DSSC and UCEB was caused by the drastic increase in Jsc, and resulted in enhanced solar light harvesting. The Jsc value of DSSCs containing β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors also increased drastically. However, their Voc value did not decrease. The FF values of UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB remained constant. The β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals are quite suitable for use as components of DSSCs, to achieve high photovoltaic performance. However, when the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were loaded onto the nTF, the photocurrent densities of the DSSCs did not increase significantly, and the presence of the microcrystals caused the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs to be deteriorated. This could be a result of the larger amount of dye molecules adsorbed on nTF compared to the amount on UCTF.52 The amount of adsorbed dye molecules would be lower in UCTF as a result of the decreased contact area between the loaded phosphor microcrystals and nTF.52 Considering that the amount of adsorbed dye molecules is directly related to ηlh, the amount of adsorbed dye molecules plays a key role in improving the photovoltaic performance of UCTF, as well as the up-conversion effect of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals. This result agrees with the results obtained by comparing the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values between nTF and UCTF. A distinguishable difference in the IPCE was observed between β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor-loaded DSSCs and reference DSSCs containing nTF, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The higher IPCE value of nTF compared to that of UCTF was related to the ηlh of the dye molecules. On the other hand, the IPCE values of UCEL and UCBR were higher than that of nTF in the wavelength range of 370–790 nm. Among the various configurations, UCEB exhibited the highest IPCE value (68.8%) at 520 nm. nTF, UCEL, and UCBR exhibited IPCE values of 65.6%, 66.4%, and 67.7%, respectively. However, the photocurrent density of each DSSC does not follow the same order as that of IPCE because of the high photon flux and limited absorption spectrum by the cut-off filter.53 Hence, it is reasonably accepted that photocurrent density is enhanced through the wavelength conversion effect from the phosphor in DSSCs. Especially, I–V curves of each DSSC containing nTF, UCTF, UCEL, UCBR and UCEB were measured and compared in the NIR range using a cut-off filter over 815 nm as shown in Fig. 5(c). As a result of the I–V curves and IPCE values under 1-sun illumination, the Jsc value of UCEB reached 0.83 from 0.31 mA cm−2 for nTF in the NIR range. UCTF, UCEL and UCBR produced Jsc values of 0.27, 0.53 and 0.58 mA cm−2, respectively. This indicates that DSSCs containing phosphors are well-photoactivated in the NIR range and result in the increased photovoltaic performance. A higher IPCE would be expected when phosphors are applied in multiple positions of DSSCs like in the case of UCEB, compared to their introduction at a single position like in the cases of UCEL and UCBR.23–26 This indicates that the use of the UCEB configuration is more favorable for harvesting solar light, compared to the use of the UCEL and UCBR configurations. Impedance values were measured and compared among nTF, UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB and the results are shown in Fig. 5(d). In the Nyquist plots of the samples, the presence of a semicircle at high frequencies, which is related to the impedance at the interface between the redox electrolyte and the platinum counter electrode, indicates low charge-transfer resistance.23–26 Since the second semicircle is derived from the recombination resistance at the interface between the C106 dye/TiO2 layer and electrolyte, the Jsc value decreases in the following order: UCEB > UCBR > UCEL > UCTF under 1-sun illumination. This ordering was also observed in the impedance result in the NIR range as shown in Fig. S6.† Although the phosphor microcrystals are present in the electrolyte in the cases of UCEL and UCEB, they do not affect the charge transfer resistance because the phosphor microcrystals in the electrolyte solution are not chemically bonded with the iodide electrolyte. In this aspect, it indicates that a higher charge transfer rate overcomes the recombination rate at the interface because of enhanced photocurrent from UCEB compared with others.

Among the various configurations, UCEB exhibits the highest ηlh and photovoltaic performance, owing to its low interfacial impedance for charge transfer. In order to assess the up-conversion effects of the β-NaYF4 phosphor microcrystals with and without Yb3+ and Er3+, the JSC values of nTF, UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB with and without Yb3+ and Er3+ were compared and the results are shown in Fig. S7.† The Jsc values of UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB containing Yb3+ and Er3+ as dopants were higher than those of the β-NaYF4 microcrystals without Yb3+ and Er3+ (nUCTF, nUCEL, nUCBR, and nUCEB). In particular, the remarkable difference in Jsc between UCEB (24.54 mA cm−2) and nUCEB (22.85 mA cm−2) is interesting to note. Since Yb3+ and Er3+ played the roles of a sensitizer and an activator in the phosphor microcrystals for harvesting visible light from the NIR wavelength regime by the up-conversion effect, the increase in the Jsc values of UCTF, UCEL, UCBR, and UCEB is remarkable.
According to the PL spectra shown in Fig. 3, the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals absorbed NIR radiation at 980 nm and emitted two strong luminescence bands at 510–560 and 640–675 nm. The peak at 524 nm is assigned to the transition from 2H11/2 to 4I15/2, whereas the peak at 541 nm is assigned to the transition from 4S3/2 to 4I15/2. Further, the peak at 654 nm is assigned to the transition from 4F9/2 to 4I15/2. These PL peaks are located in the absorption wavelength range of the C106 dye, as shown in Scheme 2. The emission wavelength of the up-conversion portions of solar light is required to be absorbed by the C106 dye in order to achieve improvement in the photovoltaic performance. The C106 molecule exhibits λmax absorption at ∼550 nm. Therefore, the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were able to provide a large portion of emitted light at around 550 nm (541, 510–560 nm) by up-conversion of the NIR radiation to support maximum absorption by the C106 dye. The up-conversion of solar light by the prepared β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals is shown in Scheme 2.

Based on careful characterization of the PL spectra and assessment of the photovoltaic performance in DSSCs, it was concluded that the internal incorporation of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals into DSSCs with external loading phosphor films as a reflecting plate was a promising strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S8.† Our findings also support the conclusion that maximum DSSC performance would be obtained from both the external back-reflecting film by scattering and wavelength conversion effect and the internal introduction of phosphors into the electrolyte solution of DSSCs. In the present study, the up-converting β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphor microcrystals were incorporated into the DSSC components both internally and externally to promote solar light harvesting. Considering the proportion of UV and IR radiation in the total solar light, the use of down-conversion and up-conversion processes appears to be a promising approach for increasing the light harvesting efficiency. The effect of applying downshifting t-LaVO4:Dy3+ phosphors26 internally and externally to DSSCs for wavelength conversion from visible to UV regimes, simultaneously with up-conversion phosphors, will be reported in the next study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results of the study suggest that the most viable strategy for maximizing solar light harvesting is by incorporating up-conversion phosphors in the DSSC components. In the present study, the incorporation of up-conversion phosphors provided a straightforward method for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs via wavelength conversion. Additionally, solar light harvesting was improved with the use of a back-reflecting film containing phosphors. This work on the use of phosphors indicates that β-NaYF4:Yb3+ and Er3+ up-converting phosphor microcrystals can be potentially used in the internal and external components of DSSCs. When the phosphor microcrystals were integrated into DSSCs containing the C106 organometallic dye (which has a high IPCE, owing to its large optical absorption coefficient), the photovoltaic performance was enhanced via the wavelength conversion effect. Based on this study, we expect that this methodology can be applied to other wavelength converters, such as UV/NIR/IR-responsive phosphors, to improve light harvesting in DSSCs.
