    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractElectron-collecting interfacial layers play an important role in nonfullerene (NF) organic solar cells (OSCs). ZnO and polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) are the generally used interfacial materials in inverted NF OSCs. However, NF OSCs tend to show poor chemical and photostability in the presence of the two materials. Here, we demonstrate another option that doped fullerene with an n-dopant of 1,3,5-trimethylhexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (TMHT) can be an efficient electron-transport layer (ETL) for efficient NF solar cells. The TMHT doping improves conductivity by three orders of magnitude and shifts the Fermi levels of PCBM by 0.3 eV. As the doping concentration increases, the electron collection properties of the doped layer were significantly enhanced as confirmed by the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices. S-kinks in the J–V characteristics gradually disappear and the fill factor increases from 0.13 to 0.69. The devices with a doped PCBM ETL show better photostability under continuous illumination compared with reference devices with a ZnO ETL.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great attention due to their advantages of low cost, good mechanical flexibility and solution processing for large-scale devices.1–7 Recently, the development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with reduced voltage loss and broad light harvest has significantly increased the efficiency of OSCs compared with fullerene acceptors.8–13 Nowadays, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NF OSCs reaches over 16% (single-junction cells).14,15 In addition to the efficiency, the stability of organic solar cells is also important and is highly related to interfacial layers.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) and polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) have been widely used in NF single-junction and tandem solar cells as the electron-collecting interfacial layers.7,15 However, both materials have issues regarding device stability: (1) NF solar cells with a ZnO ETL show a photo-instability issue due to its photocatalytic properties under UV light below 380 nm and tend to decompose the NFAs;16 (2) PEI or PEIE are chemically active to react with A–D–A type NF acceptors. It could destroy the original intra-molecular charge transfer in the NFAs. S-kinks are observed in the J–V characteristics of the cells.7,17–19 Therefore, it is important to develop another novel interfacial layer for NF OSCs with both high performance and illumination stability.
The electron acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is a widely used electron transport layer (ETL) in high-performance perovskite solar cells, but it is not successfully used as an ETL in NF OSCs. It is due to the poor charge transport between PCBM and metal electrodes and also the lack of orthogonal solvents which allow sequential spin-coating of PCBM and NF active layers. Both limit the application of PCBM as an ETL in inverted NF OSCs. Effective n-doping is a strategy to increase the electrical conductivity of the ETL and tune the Fermi levels to improve the charge collection by the electrode.20,21 Adopting the dry transfer printing method NF active layers can be deposited onto PCBM ETLs.
Herein, we report a new n-dopant 1,3,5-trimethylhexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (TMHT) which can effectively dope PCBM. TMHT contains three tertiary amine units in a six-atom cycle. It is soluble in organic solvents and can mix with PCBM. Upon 10 wt% TMHT doping, the Fermi level of PCBM shifts from 4.7 to 4.4 eV, and the electrical conductivity increases from 2.85 × 10−7 (pristine PCBM film) to 1.12 × 10−4 S cm−1. The TMHT doped PCBM layer can act as an efficient ETL in NF solar cells. The n-doping removes the serious s-kinks in the J–V characteristics and enhances the fill factor (FF). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the NF solar cells with the new ETL is comparable to that of reference devices with ZnO, but with enhanced illumination stability.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PCBM and the dopant (TMHT) are shown Fig. 1. The active layer comprises a PM6 donor and IT-4F NF acceptor. Effective n-doping occurs with strong electron transfer between the dopant and PCBM that will generate a new optical absorption band.22Fig. 2a shows absorbance spectra of films and solutions of the doped and pristine PCBM to verify the doping effect. A new broad absorption band around 700 to 1200 nm of the doped PCBM films is observed.23,24 In solution, the absorption spectrum of doped PCBM shows a peak at 1130 nm which confirms the formation of an organic radical. We further performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to confirm the doping effect. As shown in Fig. 2c, compared with the undoped PCBM film, the 10 wt% TMHT doped PCBM film exhibits a strong paramagnetic signal with a g value of 2.003, which suggested the formation of an organic radical in the doped PCBM film.

The Fermi level shift and electrical conductivity of PCBM are both beneficial to electron collection in NF solar cells.25,26 They can both be achieved via effective doping. We then measured the work function and electrical conductivities of the films with different doping concentrations. As depicted in Fig. 2d, the work function of PCBM measured using a Kelvin probe decreases from 4.70 to 4.40 eV with 5 wt% TMHT doping. To measure the electrical conductivity of PCBM with different doping concentrations, devices with a lateral configuration (Fig. 2e) were fabricated. The conductivity of the pristine PCBM films was low (2.85 × 10−7 S cm−1). It significantly increases to 1.12 × 10−4 S cm−1 upon 10 wt% TMHT doping. Besides, we also measured conductivity changes of the 5 wt% doped PCBM films upon thermal annealing at different temperature to test the thermal stability of the doped PCBM ETLs. As shown in Fig. S1,† the conductivity of the doped PCBM film starts to decrease fast at 70 °C and higher. The up-shifted Fermi level of PCBM films and increased conductivity by the n-doping could improve the electron collection. We further performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to check whether the film morphology of the PCBM films will change upon TMHT doping. As shown in Fig. 2f and g, the pristine PCBM and 5 wt% doped PCBM films have a similar morphology and analogous root-mean-square (RMS) values.
Then, the TMHT doped PCBM was used as an ETL in inverted NF solar cells. Inverted devices with a structure of ITO/pristine or TMHT-doped PCBM/PM6:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a) were fabricated. Since the direct spin-coating of the NF active layer on top of PCBM could dissolve part of the underlayer, we adopted the transfer printing method to deposit the NF active layer. The transfer printing method has been adopted to deposit a fullerene-containing active layer or pure polymer.27–29 Here, we first show that the transfer printing method can also deposit a high-performance nonfullerene active layer. Fig. 3a also shows the energy levels of the devices with the pristine PCBM and doped PCBM with different doping ratios as the ETL.25,26 First, we tried the pristine PCBM as the ETL to obtain the control device. The control device with the pristine PCBM ETL displays an extremely serious s-kink in the J–V characteristics (Fig. 3b). The efficiency of the control devices is 0.12%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 2.06 mA cm−2, and a very low fill factor (FF) of 0.13, which is the signature of poor charge collection at the interface between the ETL and the NF active layer. Next, we tried doped PCBM with different doping concentration as the ETL. The J–V curves and key photovoltaic parameters of VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of NF solar cells with different doping concentration are summarized in Fig. 3b and Table 1, respectively. Excitingly, the s-kink was dramatically mitigated with the increased doping concentration. When the doping concentration increased to the optimal doping ratio 5 wt%, the devices achieve a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 19.83 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.69, which increases the overall PCE from 0.12% to 11.4%. It should be noted that there is no s-shape observed in the devices with doped PCBM as the ETL without UV light triggering. That is different from the other reported devices with ZnO as the ETL that requires UV light soaking for a few minutes to trigger the device to remove s-shapes.30 When the doping ratio further increases to 7 wt% or 10 wt%, the device performance starts to decrease. Though the WF is still energetically favorable, the chemical interaction (between IT-4F and TMHT) is detrimental to the device performance. As shown in Fig. S2,† the mixed solution of 20 wt% doped PCBM and IT-4F reveals a color change which indicates the presence of an interaction, while no such change is observed in the 0 wt% and 5 wt% doped solutions. The chemical interaction is consistent with previous observations on ITIC and amines.7,17–19Fig. 3c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices (0.041 cm2) containing doped PCBM as the ETL with different doping ratios, and the JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra are consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements. Upon the effective doping of PCBM, the increased conductivity (Fig. 2e) and decreased work function (Fig. 2d) lead to more efficient charge transport and charge collection at the interface of the NF active layer and the PCBM ETL. The enhanced JSC can be ascribed to the efficient charge transport of the doped PCBM, while the higher FF validates the favorable tuning of the Fermi level of the doped PCBM films which facilitates electron extraction.

We then compared the photo-stability of the NF solar cells with doped PCBM and ZnO ETLs. Fig. 3d shows the evolution of the J–V characteristics of the reference cells with the ZnO ETL under continuous illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). The performance of the ZnO-based cells degrades fast. After 100 h of illumination, only 22% of their initial PCE is retained. The severe degradation is mainly attributed to the photocatalytic properties of ZnO under UV light below 380 nm, which could induce a ‘‘photo-induced shunt’’ and the photo-degradation of the NF electron acceptors.16 The NF solar cells with the 5 wt% doped PCBM ETL demonstrated better photo-stability with 53% of their initial PCE retained after 100 h of illumination (Fig. 3e). The degradation under illumination of the cells with the doped ETL may be attributed to the aggregation tendency of fullerene molecules PCBM,31 and the instability of the active layer.32 We further studied the photo-stability of the two ETL-based NF solar cells under continuous 78 mW cm−2 white LED illumination under open-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3f and g, both devices display improved stability. The reference device with ZnO displays increased illumination stability with 90% of the initial PCE retained after 100 h of illumination, while 93% of their initial PCEs were retained for devices with doped PCBM as the ETL. Overall, doped PCBM as the ETL delivers better photo-stability of the NF cells than ZnO.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have reported an effective n-doping molecule of TMHT that can effectively dope fullerene which was confirmed by the absorption spectra, work function and conductivity. New absorption in the long wavelength range is observed after TMTH doping in the fullerene. TMHT doping considerably increases the electrical conductivity and up-shifts the Fermi level of PCBM films. In the devices, the TMHT doping into PCBM effectively removes the s-kinks in the J–V characteristics of the NF solar cells and significantly enhances the fill factor and efficiency. The cells with doped PCBM as the ETL show better illumination stability than those with a ZnO ETL. The doped PCBM can be an option as an efficient ETL for nonfullerene solar cells with good photo-stability.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
PM6 (PBDB-T-2F) andIT-4F were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. PCBM (>99%, HPLC) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. TMHT, chlorobenzene, and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Zinc acetate dihydrate, ethanolamine and methoxyethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polydimethylsioxane (PDMS) was a mixture of a base and a cross linker at a weight ratio of 10:1 (PP2-OE41, Gelest Inc.). All chemicals were used without further purification.
4.2 Fabrication of NF OSCs
NF OSCs were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/pristine or TMHT-doped PCBM/PM6:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic baths sequentially with DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (each for 10 min) and treated with air plasma for 5 min. For the PCBM ETL, PCBM was first dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 15 mg mL−1. Then PCBM was doped with TMHT solution by adding different doping weight ratios from 0.1 to 10 wt%. Subsequently, a pristine PCBM or doped PCBM ETL was obtained by spin-coating the solution onto ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 50 s in a glovebox. The PCBM films were annealed at 100 °C for 3 min in a glovebox. The thickness of the pristine and TMHT-doped PCBM was approximately 40 nm, which was determined by using an Atomic Profiler (AMBIOS TECHNOLOGY XP-2). For the ZnO ETL, the ZnO precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.3 g zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.084 g ethanolamine in 3 mL methoxyethanol, followed by continuous stirring overnight. The ZnO ETL was obtained by spin-coating sol–gel precursor solutions onto ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s in air and then annealing on a hot plate at 180 °C for 10 min in air. For the NF active layer, a PM6:IT-4F solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg PM6 and 10 mg IT-4F in 1 mL chlorobenzene and adding 0.5 vol% DIO. The NF active layer was subsequently prepared on top of the ETL by the transfer-printing method. The transfer-printing process includes the following: the NF active layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 2 min onto silicon wafer, followed by annealing on a 100 °C hot plate for 10 min in a glovebox. And then, a slice of PDMS was put onto the NF active layer, and the whole samples were dipped into DI water for 10 s. After that, the PDMS was peeled off with the NF active layer film from the silicon wafer. Subsequently, the PDMS with the PM6:IT-4F film was put onto the NF solar cell samples of ITO/ETL. The sample was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 s. Then PDMS was peeled from the sample and the NF active layer was retained on the ETL. The procedure of the transfer printing method is more complicated than the commonly used spin coating method. But it can allow the sequential deposition of layers from similar solvents (non-orthogonal). After transfer printing, the samples should be thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a glove box. Finally, MoO3 (7 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were evaporated on top of the active layers under a vacuum of 1 × 10−7 Torr by using a thermal evaporator (Mini-Spectros, Kurt J. Lesker). The device effective area was 0.041 cm2.
4.3 Characterization
For UV-vis-NIR measurements, the absorption spectra of the films were recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). To evaluate the conductivity of PCBM films, we fabricated samples with a structure as shown in Fig. 2d. PCBM with different doping concentrations was then spin coated on glass substrates. Subsequently, 70 nm Ag with different channel lengths from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm was evaporated onto the ETL. The AFM morphology of the films was determined by using a Shimadzu SPM9700. The photovoltaic J–V curves of the NF solar cells were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit with a 40 mV s−1 scan rate which was controlled by using the LabVIEW program in a glovebox under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The light intensity is calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed using a 150 W Xenon lamp (Newport) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004). A mask with an area of 0.041 cm2 was attached onto the organic solar cells and a certified monocrystalline Si solar cell (for calibration) during the measurement.
