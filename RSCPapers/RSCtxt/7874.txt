    AbstractWe introduce a version of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), in which the transparent electrode comprises an opened-end TiO2-nanotube (TiNT) film oriented perpendicular to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. This electrode is fabricated using a facile process involving flaking the anodic TiNT film off the Ti-metal substrate to open its closed bottom and strongly adhering it onto FTO glass by a nanocrystalline TiO2 (NP-TiO2) thin underlayer. Apart from the enhanced light-harvesting and electron-collecting efficiencies, the use of opened-end TiNT film allows the redox electrolyte (iodide, I− and triiodide, I3−) easy access to the NP-TiO2 underlayer. As compared to the closed-end TiNT-based DSSC, the opened-end TiNT-based device exhibited an increase in one-sun efficiency from 5.3% to 9.1%, corresponding to 70% enhancement.
Introduction
Since the breakthrough work conducted by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have provided an attractive alternative to silicon-based photovoltaics because of their special features, such as low cost and high energy conversion efficiency (>10%).2–4 The anodes of DSSCs are typically ∼10 μm-thick films of disordered TiO2 nanoparticles (NP-TiO2) which are deposited as a paste and sintered to produce an electrically continuous three-dimensional network. The formed film provides a large surface area (characterized by a roughness factor, defined as the total film area per unit substrate area) for anchoring sufficient dye to yield high light harvesting, thus maximizing the amount of photogenerated electrons. Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of more efficient photoanode materials, including ordered one-dimensional (1-D) arrays (e.g., tubes, rods, and wires) perpendicular to charge-collecting substrates,5–9 for replacing the conventional NP-TiO2. Frank's group had reported that a new generation of DSSCs with oriented TiO2-nanotube arrays directly grown on the Ti substrate (TiNT/Ti) by electrochemical anodic oxidation method demonstrated favorable electron transport properties and superior light-harvesting efficiency compared to those found for DSSCs incorporating NP-TiO2.8 However, the performances of these TiNT-based devices are inferior to those of NP-TiO2-based DSSCs due to the insufficient surface area for dye adsorption.
Recently, TiNT arrays with a large internal surface area had been obtained through anodization of Ti foil in non-aqueous electrolytes.10–12 The solar conversion efficiency (η) of 3.0% was reported in a sandwiched DSSC using the 5.7 μm-TiNT arrays on an opaque Ti foil substrate,8 and 6.9%12 were achieved with longer length of ∼20 μm. In addition, the TiNT arrays with rough tube walls resulted in slightly enhanced efficiency as compared to the smooth TiO2 morphologies.11 Such DSSCs require back-side illumination (i.e., through the semi-transparent Pt counter-electrode due to the opaque Ti substrate) and their efficiencies are normally much lower than front-side illuminated cells because the incident light is partially absorbed by the counter-electrode and the electrolyte.13,14 Accordingly, a new methodology of fabricating a transparent electrode of TiNT arrays for front-side illuminated DSSC is expected to improve photovoltaic performance.
Grimes and co-workers7 demonstrated a transparent TiNT-based photoanode by an anodic oxidation of titanium thin film that was sputtered onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. A resulting low η was due to the limiting thickness of sputtered Ti film. Most recently, Park et al.15 transferred and fixed 35 μm-thick TiNT arrays onto the FTO glass using Ti-isopropoxide as paste. Chen and Xu16 developed a two-step anodization process to fabricate a large-area free-standing TiNT film and then transferred it to the FTO glass via a layer of TiO2 nanoparticle (NP-TiO2) paste. In these cases, the tube-ends at bottom are closed. The closed-end interface between the TiNT arrays and the NP-TiO2 layer might cause near-UV light absorption and front surface light reflection as well as block the diffusion of the redox reagents into the underlayer NP-TiO2 atop the collecting FTO substrate. Removing the caps of the closed bottom is expected to enhance light-harvesting and electron-collecting efficiencies in the photoanode.
Herein we introduce a version of DSSCs, in which the transparent electrode comprises an opened-end TiNT (O-TiNT) film oriented perpendicular to the FTO glass. This electrode was fabricated using a facile process involving flaking the anodic TiNT-array film off a Ti-metal substrate to open its closed bottom and strongly adhering it onto FTO glass by sol–gel processed NP-TiO2 paste and sintering at high temperature. The fabrication process of the transparent photoanode in the DSSC was sketched in Scheme 1. An optimum solar conversion efficiency of 9.1% in the O-TiNT-based DSSC is much higher than those of the closed-end TiNT-based DSSCs obtained in this study (5.3%) and reported to date (e.g. 7.6%15 and 5.5%16).

Experimental
Vertically-oriented, high-aspect-ratio TiNT arrays were grown by an anodic oxidation of Ti foil at 80 V in an electrolyte composed of 0.5 wt% NH4F and 3 wt% concentrated H2O2 solution in ethylene glycol at 20 °C for 12 h, similarly to our previous report.11 The free-standing TiNT film was obtained by immersing the as-prepared TiNT/Ti in 33 wt% H2O2 solution for 20 s. Removal of the closed bottom caps from the TiNT film was carried out by covering the top surface of the open side of the TiNT film with a thin layer of hot-melt adhesive as a protective layer to retain the tubular structure. After immersing in a 0.5 wt% oxalic acid solution at 40 °C for certain period of time, the resulting film was dipped in an acetone solution at 60 °C for 2 h for separation from the protective layer.17 The opened-end TiNT film was then sandwiched in two glass slides during annealing in air at 450 °C for 30 min.
A nanocrystalline TiO2 (NP-TiO2) viscous paste was prepared by use of a popular common sol–gel procedure,18 in which titanium tetraisopropoxide was hydrolyzed in 0.1 M nitric acid followed by autoclaving at 220 °C for 20 h. Then, the sol–gel processed NP-TiO2 was mixed with water and polyethylene glycol. The annealed TiNT film was adhered onto FTO glass using this NP-TiO2 viscous paste which was first printed onto FTO glass by doctor blade technique. Immediately, the TiNT film was fixed on the top of NP-TiO2 paste under a slight pressure by covering with a slide glass followed by annealing in air at 450 °C for 30 min. After immersing in 0.05 M TiCl4 solution and annealing, the excess NP-TiO2 portion uncovered by the TiNT film was shaved off. The electrode was then immersed in a 0.3 mM (Bu4N)2Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2 (N719 dye, Solaronix) solution for 24 h. The N719-sensitized electrode was further sandwiched with the sputtered-Pt FTO glass, separated by a 75 μm-thick-hot-melt spacer. The intervening space was filled with liquid electrolytes of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile.
Photovoltaic measurements were performed using an Oriel AM 1.5 solar simulator. The light intensity was adjusted with a monocrystalline Si reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG-5) for minimizing the mismatch with the AM 1.5 spectrum. The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (650B, CH Instruments). The light source for the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an Oriel 74100 monochromator. The light intensity was measured with an optical power meter (Oriel model 70310) equipped with a calibrated thermopile head (Ophir Optronics 71964). The mask made of 3 mm-thick stainless steel plate with a area of 0.25 cm2 was attached on the outside of the glass having dye-adsorbed TiNT film. An estimate of roughness (defined as the total surface area per unit geometric surface area) was deduced from N719 dye adsorption measurements by dissolving completely from the sensitized films to a 0.2 M sodium hydroxide solution. The concentrations of N719 dye were determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy (U-3410, Hitachi), and a value of 1.6 nm2 per dye molecule19 was used.
Results and discussion
Vertically-oriented TiNT arrays grown by an anodic oxidation of Ti foil were flaked off the underlying Ti foil using H2O2 solution as shown in (Fig. 1a). This simple method offers results well comparable to those obtained by other procedures (e.g., ultrasonication20 and CH3OH/Br2 etching21). The free-standing TiNT film can be obtained with a dimension of 1 cm × 3 cm that is nearly the same size as the whole area of the anodized Ti foil in the electrolyte. Fig. 1b–d show the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images with top, side and bottom views of the free-standing TiNT film. A ∼70 μm tube length with rough walls is presented with an average inner diameter of ∼140 nm and a wall thickness of ∼50 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 1d, the tube-ends are closed at the bottom. This film is denoted as C-TiNT.

We reported a simple and environment-friendly method with oxalic acid solution as etching agent to remove the closed bottom caps of the TiNT film. Fig. 1e shows the FE-SEM image of the nearly fully opened bottom of TiNT film after treatment in oxalic acid solution for 16 h. The FE-SEM images of the evolution of the tube bottom-cap opening with the treatment time are presented as shown in Fig. 2. The tube bottom is nearly fully opened after the treatment for 16 h. Over 20 h, the disorder morphology of TiNT appeared along with the formation of bundles and microcracks (see Fig. 2d). For fabrication of DSSC photoanode, the flat annealed TiNT film of ∼0.25 cm2 was adhered onto FTO glass using sol–gel processed NP-TiO2 paste. As shown in Fig. 1f, this O-TiNT film was measured to be ∼63 μm in length, and a 3 μm thick NP-TiO2 layer formed between the FTO glass and the TiNT film.

The I–V measurements of the DSSCs based on the 63 μm O-TiNT and the 70 μm C-TiNT-array films as well as a 3 μm-thick NP-TiO2 film were carried out. The reproducibility of the I–V measurements obtained using 4–5 different devices has been assessed. For all the measurements, the standard deviations are within 0.5% and the coefficients of variation (i.e., the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) are within 5%. The experiment results are reproducible. The representative I–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 3. The 3 μm-thick NP-TiO2-based DSSC that was fabricated without TiNT film, for comparison, exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.772 V, (Isc) of 3.4 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.65 and η of 1.7%. Adhering a C-TiNT film on top of the NP-TiO2 layer resulted in improved performance, with Isc of 11.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.714 V, FF of 0.63, and η of 5.3%. With the O-TiNT film, the Isc was dramatically increased up to 18.5 mA cm−2, with Voc of 0.770 V, FF of 0.64, and η of 9.1%. The higher Voc is most likely attributable to an increase in electron density in the opened-end TiO2 nanotube arrays, and thus the negative shift of the quasi-Fermi level.18Table 1 summarizes the values of Voc, Isc, FF and η for these two cells. The dye loadings were determined by dye desorption. They were 0.022 μmol cm−2 in the 3 μm-thick NP-TiO2 film, 0.152 μmol cm−2 in the O-TiNT film and 0.159 μmol cm−2 in the C-TiNT film, corresponding to roughness of 200, 1445 and 1541, respectively. Similar dye loadings observed in both the C-TiNT-based and O-TiNT-based DSSCs indicate that dye molecular can diffuse into the NP-TiO2 underlayer through the interpore region during the 24-hour immersing, even though the tube bottoms are closed. As compared to the C-TiNT-film-based DSSC, the O-TiNT-film-based DSSC shows higher values of Voc, Isc and η.

The photocurrent dynamics of DSSCs were recorded according to the responses to switching on and off one-sun irradiation, as shown in Fig. 4. In the front-side-illuminated systems, the initial photocurrent densities (Ii) upon exposure to light were 20.2 and 18 mA cm−2 for the O-TiNT and the C-TiNT films, respectively. As reported in the previous study,17 the presence of the bottom caps of the C-TiNT film has a adverse effect on optical transmittance in the nanotube arrays that not only filtered but also scattered the incident light, leading to a decrease of 2.2 mA cm−2 in Ii as compared with that of the O-TiNT film. The photocurrent of the O-TiNT film only slightly decayed to a steady current (If corresponding to Isc as measured in an I–V experiment) of 18.5 mA cm−2 over a few seconds whereas a significant drop lasted for 15 s to If of 11.7 mA cm−2 in the C-TiNT film (∼65% of Ii). When both the C-TiNT-based and O-TiNT-based DSSCs were illuminated from the back-side, the photocurrent transients exhibit a more ideal rectangular shape (see Fig. 4). These different phenomena are indicative of insufficient mass transport of the redox electrolyte (iodide, I− and triiodide, I3−) within DSSCs.22 Initially the concentration of the electrolyte at NP-TiO2 underlayer is identical to bulk concentration, leading to the initial burst of photocurrent upon light illumination at the front-side-illuminated TiNT-based DSSC. When current passes through the cell, however, a transport limitation of the electrolyte within the underlayer would result in a space-dependent concentration variation23 that would affect the DSSC performance. A significant effect of the bottom caps on mass transport of the electrolyte can be concluded because the C-TiNT-based DSSC initially delivers much higher photocurrents than it can eventually sustain. Additionally, the significant drop in photocurrent almost lasted over a quite long period of time. The photocurrent of the C-TiNT-based DSSCs is thus ultimately limited by the electrolyte transport from NP-TiO2 underlayer to the cathode through the interpore region, resulting in different photocurrent decay phenomena, as observed. On the other hand, the opened-end nanotubes allow the redox electrolyte easy access to the NP-TiO2 underlayer. The electrolyte-access-related photocurrent loss is possibly the predominant factor to the large difference of 6.8 mA cm−2 in Isc between the C-TiNT and the O-TiNT films.

Fig. 5 displays the monochromatic IPCE of both the C-TiNT-based and the O-TiNT-based DSSCs as function of wavelength measured at the short circuit. The integrated photocurrents are also depicted in Fig. 5. The IPCE of a DSSC is determined by the product of the light harvesting, electron injection, and electron collection efficiencies.24 With similar dye loading and TiNT film thickness, the IPCE values in the full spectrum of 350–800 nm are significantly larger in the O-TiNT-based DSSCs as compared to the C-TiNT-film-based DSSC. This could be due to the difference in electron collection efficiencies for the O-TiNT and C-TiNT films. The Isc for both cells under solar illumination were predicted by convolution of the IPCE spectra with the photo flux density distribution for 1 sun as the following equation,25 Isc = ∫qF(λ)IPCE(λ)dλ(1)where q is the electron charge and F(λ) is the incident photon flux density (AM 1.5, ASTM G173) at wavelength λ. In our IPCE measurements, no correction was made for reflection losses from the device. In order to emphasize the light-harvesting efficiency in the longer wavelength, we divided the calculation of Isc into two parts. One was calculated for the wavelength greater than 600 nm (Isc≥600nm), where light absorption of N719 dye being comparatively poor,25 and the other was the wavelength lower than 600 nm (Isc<600nm). The corresponding Isc≥600nm and Isc<600nm values are 3.2 and 7.2 mA cm−2 for the C-TiNT film, and 6.3 and 9.9 mA cm−2 for the O-TiNT film. The total calculated Isc were 10.4 and 16.2 mA cm−2 for the C-TiNT and O-TiNT-array films, respectively. The differences from the experimental results are probably due to the slight spectral mismatch. The increase of 3.1 mA cm−2 in Isc≥600nm accounts for ∼55% of the overall increase in Isc (5.8 mA cm−2) by opening the tube bottom. The increase in photocurrent at the longer wavelength dominated the overall increase in photocurrent by opening the tube bottom, which indicates the O-TiNT film not only efficiently harvests the long-wavelength light but also well collects its photogenerated electrons over the entire length of the tubes. In contrast, the lower amount of photoelectrons generated in the C-TiNT film was resulted by the partial filtration of the incident light due to the presence of the bottom caps of the tube arrays. Moreover, the presence of the bottom caps would prevent I−/I3− electrolyte diffusing into the NP-TiO2 underlayer that limited the dye regeneration in the NP-TiO2 underlayer. The photoexcited electrons that generated by long-wavelength incident light at the upper part of the tubes were then easily recaptured by the oxidized dye while percolating through the NP-TiO2 underlayer to the electron-collecting electrode. After opening the tube bottom to allowing the electrolyte easy access to the NP-TiO2 underlayer, a significant increase in the photocurrent at the longer wavelength was obtained as shown in Fig. 5.

Conclusions
Front-side-illuminated opened-end TiO2-nanotube-based DSSCs were achieved using a transparent electrode of opened-end TiNT film that was strongly interconnected onto FTO glass by a NP-TiO2 underlayer. The well-adherent opened-end TiNT film allows not only sufficient thickness for harvesting the incident light but also efficient direction of electron transport along the nanotubes to FTO glass. As compared to the closed-end TiNT film, the used of opened-end TiNT film exhibited an increase in one-sun efficiency from 5.3% to 9.1% due to its better mass transport as well as enhanced light harvesting and electron collection efficiencies. Furthermore, well adherence of this free-standing TiNT film onto conductive plastic substrates is a highlighted and ongoing challenge for high-efficiency flexible DSSCs.
