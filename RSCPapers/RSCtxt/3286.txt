    , Accepted 11th October 2016First published on 12th October 2016AbstractA new organic–inorganic hybrid material (C15H14N4)BiBr5·H2O with an optical band gap of 2.24 eV, having 1-D chains of bromobismuthate anions in its composition, has been obtained from an aqueous solution and characterized. The partial replacement of Br by I resulted in the formation of a thermally stable (<155 °C) black compound (C15H14N4)BiBrI4·H2O with an optical band gap of 1.70 eV, which can be proposed as a promising light-harvesting material for dye-sensitized solid-state solar cells. Further replacement of Br by I results in the formation of red-orange colored (C15H14N4)BiI5 with a band gap of 2.10 eV.
Introduction
Recently, it was demonstrated1–4 that a number of divalent organic cations, halobismuthates(III), described by a general formula RBiX5 (where R is an organic cation, and X is Cl, Br, or I) contains bi- or polynuclear anions in the crystalline state. The geometry and electronic structure of organic cations are found to be of primary importance for the unusual electronic and optical properties of organic inorganic hybrids. Of all iodobismuthate hybrids, those based on higher dimensional anionic frameworks are promising candidates for semiconducting materials.5 Namely, the presence of a charge separation transition band in the absorption spectra was described for compounds having organic cations and 1-D chains in their composition.6,7 These chains may be polar or nonpolar6 depending on the position of the bridging halogen atoms. If the compound with polar chains is crystallized in the polar space group, it possesses ferroelectric properties. If the compound contains non-polar chains or polar chains, but is crystallized in the centrosymmetric space group, it may have semiconductor properties and unusual optical properties. Due to their unique optical properties and facile synthesis, the halobismuthates were proposed as promising light-harvesting materials for dye-sensitized solid-state solar cells.8 The direct conversion of solar energy into electricity by using photovoltaic cells remains an actual problem for renewable power generation and it gives rise to the search for new materials with higher efficiency. Among the promising photoactive materials the recently obtained hybrid organic–inorganic lead-based materials stand out.9 The solar cells made from these materials have demonstrated highly efficient conversion of solar energy (up to 20%), and further optimization of perovskite solar cells resulted in the rapid growth of this parameter recently. The hybrid bismuth-based material has several advantages such as non-toxicity, ambient stability, and low-temperature solution-processability, which provide a promising alternative light-harvesting material as compared with organolead- and organotin-materials.10 Recently, some halobismuthates8,11–14 have been reported as prospective lead-free light harvesting materials that are stable in humid air and exhibit excited-state lifetimes of the order of nanoseconds. In this paper, we described the optical and thermal properties of hybrid compounds having 1-D halobismuthate anions in their composition, which are formed by the interaction of bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane bromides with potassium halobismuthates in aqueous solutions.
Results
The formal structure of the synthesized precursors and compounds used in this study is presented in Scheme 1. Bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane bromide C15H14N4Br2 was synthesized from 4-pyridinecarbonitrile and 1,3-dibromopropane in acetonitrile (ESI†).
 Scheme 1  1,1′-(1,3-Propanediyl)bis(4-cyanopyridinium) or bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane salts. 
Synthesis of bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane halobismuthates
The interaction of bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane cations with bromobismuthate anions in aqueous solution can occur rapidly with the formation of an unstable milky-white intermediate. A period of 1–2 min is quite sufficient for the full conversion of this product into an orange precipitate. In the presence of excess of potassium bromobismuthate this interaction occurs quantitatively and can be described by the equation:PyC32+ + Br− + BiBr4− + H2O = PyC3BiBr5·H2O↓ (Compound 1)Compound 1 is moderately soluble in DMF, DMSO or boiling water with the formation of light-yellow (DMF or DMSO) or colorless (boiling water) solutions. The crystallization of 1 from aqueous solution provides long, thin, needle-shaped crystals (Fig. S13 in ESI†), in accordance with the 1D structure of this material. The dissolution of 1 in DMF resulted in the formation of yellow glass, containing large orange crystals which are suitable for the single crystal X-ray crystallographic study. The reaction of compound 1 with potassium iodide in aqueous solution is accompanied by a change in the precipitate colour from orange to black through shades of brown. Black precipitate 2 is a mixed salt bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane bromoiodobismuthate, formed according to the equation:PyC3BiBr5·H2O + 4I− = PyC3BiBrI4·H2O↓ (Compound 2) + 4Br−Intermediates 2a–2d were supposed to be a series of solid solutions. However, according to XRD (Fig. S9 in ESI†) and reflectance data, intermediates 2a–2d are constituted of compounds 1 and 2 in different proportions. The dependence of the I content in the solid (N′) on the I content in the initial mixture (N) indicates (Fig. S20 in ESI†) a preferential transfer of Br to the solid product in mixed systems as compared with I. This preferential precipitation of a Br containing product can be ascribed to the lower solubility of compound 1 in water as compared to compound 2. Black precipitate 2 is soluble in DMF or DMSO and is moderately soluble in acetonitrile or boiling water. From the DMF solution of 2 an orange glass was obtained upon drying. Further addition of water to the resulting glass led to the formation of the initial black precipitate. All our attempts to crystallize that black compound from DMF, acetonitrile or water were unsuccessful. The direct interaction of bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane bromide and potassium iodobismuthate led to the formation of red-orange colored bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane iodobismuthate 3A:PyC32+ + I− + BiI4− = PyC3BiI5↓ (Compound 3A)However, product 3A was found to be amorphous and contained occluded water together with potassium iodide and potassium bromide. Further drying in air results in an irreversible transition of 3A to 2 with the formation of a black powder:PyC3BiI5 + H2O + Br− = PyC3BiBrI4·H2O↓ + I−In order to increase the crystallinity of 3A it was heated up to 80 °C in contact with mother liquor, cooled down and left for one week in a closed tube. Thus, the obtained product 3 is stable and resistant to conversion into the black phase at room temperature. The increase of sample crystallinity was approved by XRD data (Fig. S11 in ESI†). Red compound 3 is soluble in DMF or DMSO. The recrystallization of 3 as well as 2 in a hot aqueous solution of KBr and KI (ratio 1:4) led to the formation of a yellow-orange precipitate which was transformed to black compound 2 within 1–2 h.
Structure description
The structure of compound 1 is presented in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Structure of a fragment of 1 (a) and projection of the structure of 1 along the x-axis (b). 
It is formed by cations C15H14N42+ and 1D-chains of {BiBr5}n. The C3H6 chain in C15H14N42+ has a trans-configuration (torsion angles N–C–C–C are 172 and 174°) unlike C15H14N4Br2,15 where the cation has a gauche–gauche conformation (the torsion angle N–C–C–C is 66°). The polar anion chains {BiBr5}n are found in this compound. The lengths of Bi–Br bonds for the bridging atoms are significantly different: 2.7442(7) и 3.0780(7) Å (Table S1 in ESI†).
The bromobismuthate chains have opposite directions6 (Fig. 2) due the centrosymmetric space group of 1.
 Fig. 2  Fragment of anion chains [BiBr5]n2n− in the structure of 1. 
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) technique was used to control the crystalline phase purity (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  The results of refinements for 1. 
The refinements were carried out using TOPAS program.16 The details of the refinement for 1, the crystalline powder isolated from aqueous solution, are as follows: Pbca, a = 11.5563(7), b = 19.468(2), c = 20.415(2); Rexp = 2.36%, Rwp = 6.03%, Rp = 3.95%, GOF = 2.56%. Thus, the structures of single crystals isolated from DMF solutions of 1 and the crystalline powder isolated from the aqueous reaction mixture are the same. The difference in the parameters can be caused by different temperatures of experiments.
Thermal stability
According to the DSC and DSG-TGA results, for both compounds 1 and 2, the first stage of mass loss occurs at 40–110 °C (Fig. 4) and corresponds to the loss of one solvate water molecule.
 Fig. 4  DSC curves in the temperature range of 20–220 °C: 1 (a), 2 (b), and 3 (c). 
DSG-TGA: exp. 1.96% for 1 (Fig. S6 in ESI†), calc. 2.05% for (C15H14N4)BiBr5·H2O, exp. 1.76% for 2 (Fig. S7 in ESI†), calc. 1.69% for (C15H14N4)BiI4Br·H2O. Subsequent heating of sample 2 results in devitrification: tons = 155 ± 1 °C, tinf = 161 ± 1 °C, tend = 163 ± 1 °C, ΔCp = 0.815 ± 0.063 J g−1 K−1. Unlike samples 1 and 2, the heating of sample 3 is not accompanied by any changes (Fig. 4). Sample 3 is anhydrous and contains only adsorbed water (about 1 molecule of water per 9 formula units, Fig. S8 in ESI†). The heating in the range of 20–220 °C for sample 3 results in devitrification: tons = 125 ± 1 °C, tinf = 136 ± 1 °C, tend = 141 ± 1 °C, ΔCp = 0.120 ± 0.013 J g−1 K−1. The DSC curve also has one anomaly after devitrification (an endothermic effect in the temperature range of 160–180 °C). Under thermal cyclic conditions, the DSC curve measured during the initial heating of sample 3A has one addition anomaly in the temperature range of 24–45 °C.
Compounds 1–3 decompose at temperatures above 240 °C (Fig. S6–S8 in ESI†). The first stage of decomposition occurs in the temperature range of 240–260 °C and is accompanied by the loss of mass equivalent to one CN group. In accordance with the XRD data (Fig. S10 in ESI†), the loss of one crystal water molecule in 2 occurs without significant changes in the structure. However, black compound 2 turned into a dark glass when it was heated to 160 °C and kept at this temperature for 6 h. The crushed glass is a brownish-red amorphous compound (Fig. S10 in ESI†).
Reflectance spectra
The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane halobismuthates are shown in Fig. 5a as the Kubelka–Munk function vs. light energy. The Kubelka–Munk equation is expressed as follows:17  Rd is the absolute reflectance of the sample layer. The optical band gap energies (Eg) were estimated from the extrapolation of the linear parts of corresponding curves to F(Rd) = 0.
 Fig. 5  (a) Reflectance spectra of the samples: 1 (1), 2b (2), 2c (3), 2d (4), 2 (5), and 3 (6); (b) the energy band gap extracted from the reflectance measurements depending on the fraction of Br: 1 (1), 2 (2), and 3(3), the hollow points and line correspond to MAPbBr3xI3(1−x).10 
For the lead containing perovskites MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 (MA = methyl ammonium) a linear dependence of the band gap on the Br content was found to be described by equation,18Eg = 1.56 + 0.69 × X, where X is the bromide mole fraction. The energy band gap can be easily tuned by varying the Br/I ratio for perovskites. Compounds 1 and 2 have optical band gaps of 2.24 and 1.70 eV, respectively, which are close to the values for MAPbBr3−xIx (Fig. 5b). Compound 3 has an optical band gap of 2.10 eV. The reflection spectra of solids 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d (Fig. 5a) can be attributed to the mixtures containing phases 1 and 2 at different ratios. This conclusion is consistent with the XRD data for these samples (Fig. S9 in ESI†). For solid 2c, the reflectance spectrum was recalculated into the corresponding absorption spectrum. The Gauss component of this spectrum with a maximum at 16200 cm−1 can be attributed to the charge separation transition with Eg = 1.70 eV19 and the component with a maximum at 20200 cm−1 can be attributed to the charge transfer band (Fig. S12 in ESI†).
PL properties
The PL properties of samples 1 and 3 being obtained following the above-mentioned synthetic approaches were recorded at room temperature using a PE LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer. Intense PL emission bands were observed between 600 and 750 nm, covering a broad region of the red part of the spectrum (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  PL spectra of 1(1) and 3 (2) (λexc = 505 nm) at room temperature. The arrows indicate the peaks of emission bands. 
Most intense emission bands are found in the long-wave region, i.e. shifted to a low-energy region with regard to optical band gaps. The differences are 0.33 and 0.49 eV for 1 and 0.35 eV for 3. The positions of emission bands give reason to believe that these compounds are indirect band gap semiconductors, and this distinguishes the studied materials from the lead containing perovskite, i.e. MAPbI3, which is a direct band gap semiconductor.20 We suppose that the resulting materials should have a greater number of defects, and this might be the source of PL enhancement. Defects likely play a crucial role in the expression of the PL, either when these are created during the synthesis or by means of temperature-controlled structural changes. Based on the positions of the emission bands, their relative intensities and the values of optical band gap, we can make an assumption that the defect levels in the band gap are located below the conduction band minimum (CBM) at 0.07, 0.21, 0.33, and 0.49 eV for 1, and 0.07. 0.19 and 0.35 eV for 3, accordingly. Shallow level defects are characterized by the predominance of non-radiative energy transition processes, while the radiative processes can characterize the deeper level defects. At the present time, the nature of these defects is an open question and requires further research.
Conclusions
Hybrid organic cations, halometallates, have been increasingly attracting attention due to their potential application in solar cells. In this paper, hybrid organic–inorganic materials of the general formula PyC3BiBr5−xIx·mH2O, containing nontoxic bismuth and the thermally stable dicationic bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane group were synthesized and characterized by different methods. The optical band gap of 1.70 eV, estimated from the reflectance spectra of PyC3BiBrI4·H2O, makes it a promising material for tandem solar cell architectures21 where the optimal band gap is expected to be ∼1.75 eV. Bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)butane halobismuthates PyC4BiBr5 and PyC4BiBrI4 are the homologues of compounds 1 and 2 studied in this work. These compounds do not contain crystallization water and can be obtained in a similar way. PyC4BiBr5 and PyC4BiBrI4 have optical band gaps of 2.33 and 1.76 eV, respectively. Thus, taking into account the results of other studies8,11–14 hybrid halobismuthates can be proposed as a new class of stable and non-toxic solution-processed hybrid materials for photovoltaic applications.
Experimental
Analytical methods
The reflectance spectra were measured using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer in the frequency range of 10000–50000 cm−1 at room temperature.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on a LS55 (Perkin-Elmer) spectrometer in the range 200–800 nm at room temperature with a resolution of 0.5 nm; the slit width was varied from 10 to 12 nm. An attachment for luminescence measurements in solids was used.
The thermal behavior of the samples had been studied by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) using an SDT Q600 V8.3 Build 101 Module DSC-TGA thermal analyzer instrument. The samples were heated at 10° min−1 from 25 to 300 °C in Ar atmosphere in an alumina open pan. The thermal behavior of the samples had also been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a stream (20 ml min−1) of argon. The DSC study was carried out on a DSC 204 F1 NETZSCH instrument in aluminum cells at a heating rate of 5–10 °C min−1. Each experiment was carried out at least three times. The data obtained from thermal analysis methods were analyzed according to ISO 11357-1, ISO 11357-2, ISO 11358, and ASTM E 1269-95 standards using the NETZSCH Proteus Thermal Analysis software package.
Single crystal X-ray diffraction investigations were carried out at 150 K using a Bruker SMART APEX2 diffractometer. Absorption taken into account by a semi-empirical method from equivalents using program SADABS.22 The structure was solved by a combination of the direct method and Fourier-synthesis within full-matrix isotropic-anisotropic approximation. All hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically using the riding model. All calculations were performed using SHELXS-2014 and SHELXL-2014 software packages.23
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a horizontal goniometer axis using CuKα radiation in the 2θ range 3–120° at a 2θ step of 0.01–0.02° and a counting time of 0.3–0.5 s per step. Full-profile analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns of crystalline substances was performed using TOPAS 4.2 software. Fourth-order Chebyshev polynomials were used to fit the background. The overall fitting was performed using the fundamental parameter approach.
The chemical composition of powders was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) using a Jeol JSM 6610LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an Oxford Instruments Inca X-max20 detector at 20 kV accelerating voltage in low vacuum mode (P = 50 Pa). Polypropylene tablets were used as a support during EDX measurements.
Elemental analysis was performed by ICP mass-spectrometry on an Elan DRC II Perkin Elmer ICP mass spectrometer for samples dissolved in the aqueous solution (40 mg dm−3) of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate.
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCE-III instrument with an operating frequency of 600.31 MHz at 303 K.

The initially formed white precipitate became orange in 1–2 min during the stirring of the reaction mixture at room temperature (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The solution was filtered under vacuum. The filtered orange precipitate (bis(4-cyano-1-pyridino)propane bromobismuthate, 1) was washed with water and ethanol, and then dried at room temperature.
