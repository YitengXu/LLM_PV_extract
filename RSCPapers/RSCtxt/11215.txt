    , Accepted 23rd April 2018First published on 24th April 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic perovskites have been hailed as promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but their operation remains limited to the visible spectrum. Here, we combine single-wall carbon nanotubes, PbS quantum dots and a perovskite to synthesize hybrid devices suitable for operation in both the visible and near-infrared. The photodetectors thus fabricated show responsivities as high as 0.5 A W−1 and 0.35 A W−1 at 500 nm and at 1300 nm, respectively, with an applied bias of 1 V. Moreover, the incorporation of nanotubes within the perovskite matrix facilitates the carrier extraction, resulting in response time under 250 μs, a gain-bandwidth product of 0.1 MHz and detectivities of 1.4 × 1011 Jones and 0.9 × 1011 Jones at 500 nm and at 1300 nm, respectively. This unique approach opens new pathways for the development of low-cost, high-speed and broadband perovskite-based optoelectronic devices for large-scale manufacturing.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskites have recently generated tremendous interest for low-cost optoelectronic devices thanks to their excellent electrical and optical properties.1–4 A bandgap in the visible range, unusually high photoconversion efficiencies and high carrier mobilities are unique properties that made perovskites ideal materials for solar cells, light emitting diodes and photodetectors.1–6 Another advantage of perovskites is their low-cost synthesis, enabled by their low temperature processing and the abundance of the raw material precursors. This can lead to a dramatic reduction in the price of solar cells and photodetectors, even when compared to crystalline silicon-based cells currently dominating the world's solar energy industry. Within only ten years of R&D, significant efforts have already propelled perovskite-based solar cells to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 22%,7 which is the fastest technological progress in the history of photovoltaics (PVs). The advances brought by perovskite materials in solar cells have motivated research groups to turn towards perovskites to improve the performance of photodetectors, including extending their spectral response and reducing their response time. So far, several broadband photodetectors8–14 involving the use of different 2D materials such as graphene, Bi2Te3-SnSe-Bi2Te3, MoS2, etc. have been developed to obtain very decent responsivities and broadband responses that cover up to the mid-infrared in some cases. Recently, using the pulsed laser deposition process, Yao et al.10 have fabricated an ultra-broadband photodetector based on a Bi2Te3–Si heterostructure that demonstrates photodetection from the ultraviolet (370 nm) to the terahertz (118 μm) and a response time in an order of ten to hundred milliseconds. However, most of these photodetectors require complicated and high cost fabrication processes which limit their commercialization. In contrast, perovskite films can easily be deposited on different types of substrates including flexible ones and efficiently processed for large-scale production.8,9
Besides the stability issues,15,16 one major limitation of organic–inorganic perovskites, in particular organometallic halide perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbA3−xBx, A and B = I, Cl, Br), is their narrow spectral range for photo-conversion.8,9,15,16 In numerous reports, colloidal perovskite nanocrystals have been synthesized with the ability to tune their optical band gap across the visible range.17–19 Unfortunately, solution-based synthesis of such perovskite nanocrystals yields only small volumes of materials and requires the use of organic ligands to properly control their size distribution, which complicates their integration to achieve practical optoelectronic device architectures. Moreover, while perovskite nanocrystals allow the designer to tune the optimal operation to higher bandgaps (shorter wavelengths), it does not necessarily result in broader spectral responses and it fails to provide photo-conversion at lower bandgaps (longer wavelengths). Indeed, near-infrared (NIR) photo-conversion is a much desired feature for a large number of optoelectronic device applications.17–21
To allow a broader spectral response towards the near-infrared region, one possible approach is to hybridize the perovskite with other lower bandgap materials. One of the best candidates for such studies is lead chalcogenide (PbS, PbSe, PbTe, etc.) quantum dots (QDs), due to their high quantum efficiencies and the ability to easily tune their bandgap by controlling their size.22–25 Several research groups have successfully demonstrated the ability to use these QDs in photodetectors.22–25 Moreover, multiple exciton generation (MEG) in lead chalcogenide QDs, due to a large Bohr radius, also offers great promise for the development of highly efficient photodetectors.24–26 A clear example of such a successful combination is demonstrated by Konstantatos et al.27 by using PbS-QD film to enhance the weak photon absorption of graphene based photodetectors. Due to the addition of the PbS-QD layer, their broadband hybrid photodetectors have exhibited a responsivity of ∼107 A W−1, a photoconductive gain as high as 108 and a specific detectivity of 1013 Jones.27 A vertical photodetector structure with alternating layers of PbS-QDs and MAPbI3 as p-type materials has previously shown a clear response in the NIR with a responsivity of 0.13 A W−1 at 900 nm.28 Also, Ning et al.29 recently embedded colloidal PbS-QDs in a perovskite matrix using a solution-based approach. Through transient photoluminescence measurements, they demonstrated charge transfer between the perovskite and PbS-QDs.29 However, no photodetector or PV devices using this hybrid system have evidenced their effectiveness as photocharge generators, given the encapsulation of the QDs by the perovskite that favors recombination in the QDs. As such, they only succeeded in making LEDs.30
In this report, we successfully exploit the co-sensitization of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) decorated with PbS quantum dots and embedded within a perovskite matrix to fabricate ultra-broadband and highly sensitive high-speed photodetectors. In this hybrid system, the photoactive material is a combination of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and PbS-QDs used as light harvesters, while the embedded SWCNT mesh acts as a charge collector. The incorporation of PbS-QDs clearly extends the spectral response to the NIR. Using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements, we show that the presence of the PbS-QDs on the SWCNT prior to the deposition and conversion of the perovskite precursor further promotes the charge transfer from the perovskite to the SWCNT. At a voltage as low as 1 V, we obtain a responsivity as high as 0.5 A W−1 and 0.35 A W−1 at 500 nm and at 1300 nm, respectively. In addition, our hybrid photodetectors exhibit a response time of 250 μs, which is amongst the fastest reported so far in perovskite-based photodetectors. The fast response time combined with the high external photoconductive gain results in a gain-bandwidth product exceeding 0.1 MHz. Our hybrid photodetector also exhibits a maximum detectivity of 1.4 × 1011 Jones at 500 nm and 0.9 × 1011 Jones at 1300 nm. These results demonstrate that simple fabrication can lead to low-cost and ultra-broadband spectral photodetectors using hybridized organometallic halide perovskite-based material systems.
Results and discussion
Our hybrid film architecture using SWCNTs, PbS quantum dots and an organometallic halide perovskite that we term NT/QD/PE is synthesized in three steps. At each step, we characterized the morphology of the film using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). First, the SWCNT mesh is deposited by spray-coating. Fig. 1a shows the typical SEM image of the film of entangled bundles of the SWCNT. Indeed, we have previously described how spray-coating can yield such uniform SWCNT films with controllable electrical resistivity depending on their concentration.31,32 The second step of the synthesis is the deposition the PbS-QDs prepared using a slightly modified version of the method pioneered by Hines and Scholes (see the Experimental section).33 The absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) of the PbS-QDs with different sizes are shown in ESI Fig. S1.† To deposit the film of PbS-QDs atop the SWCNT mesh, we have adopted a layer-by-layer dip-coating approach with ligand-exchange using 1,2-ethanedithiol (see the Experimental details). Fig. 1b shows a typical SEM image of the film of the SWCNT after PbS-QD deposition using 5 dip-coating sequences in a 5 mg ml−1 solution of PbS-QDs with ligand exchange, suggesting that the PbS dots completely fill the porous mesh of the SWCNT. Hereafter, we will demonstrate that varying the number of dips of PbS-QDs can maximize the performance of our hybrid photodetectors. The third and final step of the preparation of the NT/QD/PE hybrid films is the deposition of the perovskite precursor by spin-coating. The solution precursor for the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite is prepared using the one-step approach method reported by Binek et al.34Fig. 1c shows the cross-section of the hybrid structure following thermal conversion to crystalline perovskite. The final thickness of the perovskite film is around 130 nm after spin-coating the precursor at 2500 rpm for 30 s. A lower magnification of the cross-section showing the uniformity of the hybrid structure is illustrated in the ESI Fig. S2.† The formation of high-quality perovskite films is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction patterns (see ESI Fig. S3†).34

The absorption spectra of the hybrid films with and without PbS-QDs are compared in Fig. 2a. In the hybrid film without PbS-QDs, the clear absorption onset around 770 nm corresponds to the bandgap of the perovskite (∼1.61 eV). The contribution of the QDs embedded in the perovskite layer can be further investigated by varying the quantum dot size. The different QDs are labeled using their respective estimated size based on their absorption peak (for example, the PbS-QDs with an absorption peak at 870 nm are labeled as PbS-2.88 nm and the corresponding SWCNT/PbS-QDs/PE hybrid is labeled NT/PbS-2.88 nm/PE). When incorporating PbS-2.88 nm (small quantum dots) using 5 dips between the perovskite and the SWCNT film, we observe an extra peak around 1000 nm, corresponding to the absorption peak of the bare QDs. The clear PbS-QD peak in the absorption spectrum of the NT/QD/PE hybrid following the deposition and conversion of the perovskite precursor suggests little consequences on the optoelectronic properties of the PbS-QDs. In Fig. 2b, we compare the luminescence of the bare perovskite and the pristine PbS-4.95 nm (large quantum dots) to that of the NT/PbS-4.95 nm/PE hybrid. In all the cases, the PL of the hybrid is found to be significantly lower, indicating a possible charge transfer between the different constituents of the hybrid material. The luminescence around 1400 nm also confirms the presence of optoelectronically active quantum dots underneath the perovskite layer. In ESI Fig. S3,† the XRD patterns of the PbS-QDs and the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films (before the hybridization) compared to that of the SWCNT/PbS-QDs/MAPbI3−xClx (after the hybridization) confirm the good crystallinity of the different constituents before and after the hybridization, indicating that the loss of PL does not come from a loss of the crystal quality during the hybridization.

(b) Photoluminescence spectra of the bare MAPbI3−xClx perovskite and bare PbS-QDs compared to SWCNT/QD/MAPbI3−xClx hybrid (PbS-QDs have 4.95 nm-diameter) showing clearly the PL quenching as soon as the SWCNT is added to form the hybrid material. The PbS-QD layers were made with 2 dips. 
The potential of this photoactive SWCNT–QD–perovskite hybrid material system for optoelectronic device integration is investigated using a simple planar photoconductive device architecture.24,31 For comparison, a batch of devices using different PbS quantum dot sizes is produced but control samples without the perovskite overlayer are also kept for reference. For the devices fabricated with pure PE and QD/PE, it is worth mentioning that because of the absence of any charge extractor, no photocurrent could be measured from those devices. On the other hand, for the device with NT/PE, extensive studies on its performance have been reported in our previous work.31Fig. 3(a and b) compare the photocurrent spectra for devices produced using different QD sizes, but with (Fig. 3b) and without (Fig. 3a) the perovskite overlayer. The top-right insets indicate a schematic representation of the devices. Briefly, the planar device consists of a glass substrate with two parallel ITO electrodes on each side of a 300 μm trench, which is bridged by the photoactive material. As shown in Fig. 3a, all control devices made with SWCNT/QD without the perovskite show broadband photocurrent responses ranging from 300 nm to the NIR region. As expected, the photocurrent peak in the NIR shifts to longer wavelengths as the QD size increases, indicating that the charge transfer from the QDs to the SWCNT occurs for all the different QD sizes produced (from 2.88 nm to 4.95 nm). Indeed, the spectral shape of the photocurrent response follows the absorption spectra of the QDs (see Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent spectra of different SWCNT/PbS-QD hybrid devices made with QDs of different sizes (from 2.88 nm to 4.95 nm), showing the responses in the NIR which can be tuned by varying the PbS-QD size. (b) Photocurrent spectra of different SWCNT/PbS-QDs/MAPbI3−xClx hybrid devices made with QDs of different sizes. Similarly, the NIR responses can be tuned even after the addition of the MAPbI3−xClx layer. Top-right insets are the schematic of the device structures. All the measurements were done at 1 V. 
Since the key challenge consists in preserving the co-sensitization of the SWCNTs by both the QDs and the perovskite, Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent spectra for the same devices after the deposition and conversion of the perovskite layer atop the SWCNT/PbS-QDs. Fig. 3b shows the typical photocurrent spectra of the corresponding SWCNT/PbS-QDs/PE hybrids. For the fabrication of the hybrid devices, we use 5 dip-coatings in the quantum dot solution because a prior optimization revealed that layers made with 5 dip-coatings in the quantum dot solution offer the best trade-off between the charge transfer and the photoresponse in the NIR (see the ESI Fig. S4†). In the visible range, the addition of the perovskite results in widening of the spectrum, but also a two-fold increase of the device photoresponse with the perovskite. Moreover, we cannot exclude the re-absorption of the PL from the perovskite by the PbS-QDs, which can certainly also contribute to the photocurrent enhancement. Clearly, these results suggest that the PbS-QDs do not impede the charge transfer from the perovskite to the SWCNT in the visible range, while generating additional photo-carriers in the NIR range (see the inset of Fig. 3b) where the perovskite is transparent. The lower photocurrent generated by the device involving large size PbS QDs (i.e., NT/PbS-4.95 nm device) can be explained in terms of charge transfer efficiency from the QDs to the SWCNT. Thermodynamically, the occurrence of the charge transfer requires the conduction band of the charge generator (i.e., the QDs) to be higher than the charge extractor (the SWCNT). In contrast to smaller size QDs, the reduced bandgap of larger size counterparts results in a conduction band edge closer to that of SWCNTs, thus diminishing the driving force that promotes the charge transfer. In other words, the smaller the QDs, the more the charge transfer is efficient. Moreover, the higher photocurrent obtained for the smaller QDs has also been attributed to multiple exciton generation,24,26 which is previously demonstrated to be more efficient in small QDs.35 On the other hand, in the case of SWCNT/PbS/PE devices as shown in Fig. 3b, the charge generator in the visible range is mainly the PE. As expected, the photocurrent intensities measured for the different devices exhibit a slight change (between 0.8and 0.11 μA) as compared to the SWCNT/PbS/PE devices where more than two-fold increase was observed (i.e., 0.25 μA for NT/PbS-4.35 nm/PE vs. 0.55 μA for NT/PbS-2.88 nm/PE). To further investigate the contribution of the PbS-QDs to the hybrid system, Fig. 4a compares photocurrents obtained from both the SWCNT/QD hybrid and SWCNT/QD/PE hybrid devices (PbS-QD layers are made with 5 dips) using an NIR 980 nm laser at different power densities. At this excitation wavelength, the perovskite is transparent and only the PbS-QDs are active. The photocurrent values shown in Fig. 4a are extracted from the current–voltage characteristics shown in ESI Fig. S5† with and without the perovskite overlayer; the photogenerated current values are very similar and increase linearly, suggesting that the effectiveness of the PbS-QD device is well-preserved underneath the perovskite layer. Under the same 980 nm illumination, the responsivities calculated by dividing the photocurrent by the laser power reach 6 mA W−1 at the minimum excitation power (only 13 μW cm−2). The decrease of the responsivity when increasing the incident optical power is consistent with previous reports on PbS-QDs and perovskite based photodetectors.1,27 This phenomenon is commonly attributed to the low external photoconductive gain (defined as the number of photocharges per incident photon) saturating under high illumination. In other words, the photoconductive gain represents also the ratio between the photocharge recombination lifetime and its transit time (τlifetime/τtransit). The increasing recombination rate (i.e., shorter lifetime) at high incident optical power is due to the reduced availability of the trap states (which are filled by one type of the charge while the other keeps recirculating), and explains the lower responsivity. As expected, Fig. 4b thus shows low excitation powers yielding higher responsivities (R) and higher external photoconductive gains (G) in both visible and NIR regions. Indeed, under 500 nm illumination, R and G reach 0.45 A W−1 and 100, respectively, while they drop to 0.35 and 30 under 1300 nm illumination. Further increase of R and G could always be achieved by reducing the distance between the two electrodes, as previously reported.1,27 Another parameter of great importance in assessing a photodetector is the detectivity (D*). It gives access to the capability of the device to detect a weak illumination. It is defined by , where A is the active area, R is the responsivity, q is the elementary charge and Id is the dark current. We obtained detectivities of 1.4 × 1011 Jones and 0.9 × 1011 Jones at 500 nm and at 1300 nm, respectively (see the ESI† for details). These values compare well with the previously reported values on other broadband photodetectors.36,37

The size of the PbS-QDs used in these measurements is around 3.33 nm. (b) Responsivity and photoconductive gain at 1 V of the SWCNT/PbS-QDs/MAPbI3−xClx hybrid fabricated with PbS-QDs of a 4.95 nm diameter measured with lamp power 10 times lower than the laser power, thereby demonstrating that the responsivity is power-dependent. 
The stability of perovskite based devices is one of the major challenges to be addressed given that perovskite easily deteriorates in the presence of moisture. Thus, our devices were kept in ambient air (22 °C, 40 ± 5%RH) over 20 days and the photocurrent was measured at different times (see ESI Fig. S7†). After 10 days, 70% of the photocurrent was lost, while after 20 days no photocurrent was generated. This clearly indicates that for long-term stability, the devices need to be encapsulated.
To clarify the charge dynamics and the role of the PbS quantum dots within the hybrid system, Fig. 5a shows time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements monitoring the perovskite luminescence peak at 770 nm on the hybrid systems while using different quantum dot sizes. The control sample without PbS quantum dots is also shown for comparison. TRPL is an excellent tool to probe the charge separation process. The data shown in Fig. 5a are fitted using a bi-exponential decay with slow (τs) and fast (τf) decay components. For the bulk perovskite sample deposited on a glass substrate, we obtain τs and τf of 20 ns and 5 ns, respectively. These two lifetimes are assigned to the free photogenerated carriers in the bulk (slow) and at the surface (fast). From Fig. 5a, it can be seen that both lifetimes drop significantly (from 20 ns to 12 ns for τs and from 5 ns to 60 ps for τf) when the SWCNTs are added to the perovskite, to confirm that the free charges are collected more rapidly through the SWCNTs. More interestingly, the quantum dots inserted between the SWCNTs and the perovskite layer lead to an additional and significant decrease of τs, while τf remains similar. These results indicate clearly that the quantum dots also facilitate the charge transfer from the perovskite to the SWCNTs. Furthermore, it is important to note that the bulk (slow) lifetime continuously decreases with the quantum dot size, indicating that the efficiency of charge transfer in the NT/QD/PE hybrid is bandgap-dependent (see inset Fig. 5a). These results are consistent with previous reports on PbS quantum dot-based hybrids.38 For instance, in the case of PbS-QDs/TiO2-nanobelts, the charge transfer properties have been shown to be tunable through the size of the PbS-QDs.38Fig. 5b presents a schematic energy diagram of the conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands of the device architecture based on previously reported values for PbS-QDs and the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite.29,38–40 The fact that the CB and VB of the quantum dots are both below the energy values for the perovskite favors a smooth charge transfer to the SWCNT mesh.

Fig. 6 shows the transient response of our hybrid photodetectors using a 532 nm laser at different duty-cycles. This measurement can provide for an estimate gain-bandwidth product. As shown in ESI Fig. S8,† the photoresponse measurements are highly reproducible. Focusing on a single on–off cycle, Fig. 6a reveals that all the devices containing PbS quantum dots in-between the perovskite and the SWCNTs rise-and-fall more rapidly than the control samples without quantum dots. This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 5a. The rise and fall times of 250 μs and 500 μs, respectively, are determined from a single on–off cycle (Fig. 6b) obtained by chopping the laser at ∼330 Hz. Thus, the typical gain-bandwidth product is estimated to exceed 105 Hz in the visible range and 104 Hz in the NIR range. We attribute these performances to the high mobility of our hybrid films due to the SWCNTs, combined with the added contribution of the PbS-QDs to boost the charge transfer. It is important to note that, very recently, a gain-bandwidth product of 108 Hz was achieved in perovskite-based photodetectors using a much smaller photosensitive area (distance between electrodes of 5 μm). The particularity of these photodetectors is that the perovskite used was made of millimeter size crystals, which have a diffusion length exceeding 5 μm.1 Finally, Table 1 presents the figures-of-merit of our hybrid photoconductive device including the time response and the spectral range showing comparable performance with broadband photodetectors previously reported.10,36,37,41–44

All the measurements were done at 2 V.

Conclusions
In summary, we report on co-sensitized photodetector devices using a unique combination of PbS quantum dots, single-walled nanotubes and an organometallic halide perovskite, allowing an extended spectral photoresponse to the NIR region while not altering the operation in the visible range. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the addition of PbS dots facilitates the charge transfer from the perovskite to the SWCNTs. Our best photodetectors exhibit responsivities as high as 0.5 A W−1 and 0.35 A W−1 and detectivities of 1.4 × 1011 Jones and 0.9 × 1011 in the visible and in the NIR range, respectively. Moreover, the operating speed of our hybrid photodetectors reaches 4 kHz combined with the high gain across the visible and NIR ranges result in the gain-bandwidth product of 105 Hz. Our simple fabrication approach is easily applicable for large-area optoelectronic devices. Most importantly, it demonstrates that the potential use for perovskite-based devices should not be limited to the visible region but it can also yield useful devices for the near-infrared region as well.

Oleic acid (OA, technical grade, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, technical grade, 90%), hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS, synthesis grade, kept under hydrogen atmosphere in a glovebox), hexane (anhydrous, 95%), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, technical grade, ≥90%), and acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%), all purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Acetone (HPLC grade) from EMD Millipore was used as purchased. The COOH-functionalized SWCNTs (purity >95%) were purchased from Nanolab. The perovskite precursors CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbCl2, used at a molar ratio of 3:1, were purchased from Ossila.
PbS-QD synthesis and deposition procedures
The synthesis method followed is a modified version of the procedure reported by Hines and Scholes.33 On a 3-neck flask covered by a heating mantle atop a magnetic stirrer, 0.45 grams of PbO, 2.67 grams of OA and 10 grams of ODE were mixed under continuous stirring and a nitrogen flow at 120 °C for at least 1 hour after the mixture turns transparent at a temperature close to 100 °C. In the glovebox, 210 μl of the sulfur precursor, HMDS, is mixed with 4 g of ODE and deposited on a syringe ready for injection into the 3-neck flask. The proportions utilized in this synthesis follow a 4:2:1 (OA:PbO:HMDS) molar ratio.
To obtain the different sizes of PbS-QDs, the mixture in the 3-neck flash is set to a specific temperature before quickly injecting the sulfur precursor mix. PbS2.88 nm, PbS3.33 nm, PbS3.67 nm reactions were made at 57 °C, 100 °C and 140 °C, respectively. To synthesize larger quantum dots, the molar ratio was altered following the model reported by Zhang et al.45 Both PbS4.35 nm and PbS4.95 nm synthesis took place at 140 °C but the amount of OA was increased to 5.4 g and 8 g, respectively. After injecting the sulfur precursor mix in the 3-neck flask, the solution quickly turns into a dark, thicker mix as a result of the nucleation process of the QDs. The reaction was left under continuous stirring for 5 minutes at the chosen temperature. Once the heating mantle is removed, the 3-neck flask is submerged in cold water to completely quench the reaction.
The QDs were precipitated by adding an excess of acetone and centrifugation of the solution for 10 min. The excess of acetone containing the reaction by-products is carefully disposed of, leaving the dried PbS-QDs attached to the walls of the centrifuge tubes. After drying, the PbS-QDs are dispersed using a small amount of hexane and an additional precipitation of the QDs by a second run of an excess of acetone, 10 min centrifugation and disposal of the acetone + hexane mix. A second dispersion in hexane and collection of the final solution is filtered through 200 nm polytetrafluoroethylene filters.
PbS-QD deposition
Starting from a solution of 5 mg ml−1 of PbS-QDs in hexane, we deposited a stack of layers through ligand exchange with a solution of 0.02 M of 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in anhydrous acetonitrile. The substrate with SWCNTs was first dipped in the PbS-QD solution and left to dry at ambient temperature for 30 s. Afterwards, this substrate was dipped in the EDT solution for 5 s to render the layer of PbS-QDs insoluble to hexane so that a new layer could be added later. This process, representing what we call one dip, is repeated for a given time to form the PbS-QD layers.
MAPbI3−xClx synthesis and deposition
The perovskite precursors, CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbCl2, used at a molar ratio of 3:1 were purchased from Ossilla. To prepare the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite, we have followed the same recipe reported elsewhere.31 The solution of 1.685 g of MAI and 973 mg of PbCl2 in 4 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Sigma–Aldrich) were stirred at 100 °C for 45 min and then filtered using a 0.45 μm pore PVDF syringe filter before spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s on the glass substrates pre-coated with SWCNT/PbS-QDs. The average relative humidity in the laboratory during the solution preparation and deposition was between 25 and 30%. Next, the glass substrates are heated at 120 °C in air for 10 min to convert the precursors to the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite and also remove excess solvent.
Photocurrent spectrum measurements
The setup used to measure the photocurrent spectrum consists of a xenon lamp coupled to a TRIAX320 monochromator, a chopper and a lock-in amplifier. Before exciting the sample, the light from the xenon lamp passes through the monochromator to perform a 10 nm-step scan from 300 nm to 1450 nm. Then, the excitation light is also modulated at 30 Hz prior to the illumination of the sample, which is biased at 1 V and placed right after a circular diaphragm of 0.2 cm diameter. Finally, the photocurrent is measured by means of a lock-in amplifier. To calculate the responsivity, we divided the photocurrent by the power of the incident light illuminating the active area which is estimated to have rectangular shape of area 0.3 × 2 mm2 (0.3 mm and 2 mm are respectively the width and the length of the device). From 200 nm to 900 nm, the incident power is measured with a calibrated silicon detector (Newport 918D-SL-OD3R), while from 900 nm to 1450 nm we used a germanium photodetector (Newport 918D-IR-OD3R). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics used to extract the photocurrent as a function of the laser power are measured with a Keithley-2400 source-measure unit (SMU).

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent spectra of different SWCNT/PbS-QD hybrid devices made with QDs of different sizes (from 2.88 nm to 4.95 nm), showing the responses in the NIR which can be tuned by varying the PbS-QD size. (b) Photocurrent spectra of different SWCNT/PbS-QDs/MAPbI3−xClx hybrid devices made with QDs of different sizes. Similarly, the NIR responses can be tuned even after the addition of the MAPbI3−xClx layer. Top-right insets are the schematic of the device structures. All the measurements were done at 1 V.
