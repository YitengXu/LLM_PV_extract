    , Accepted 30th November 2010First published on 10th January 2011AbstractTransparent thin film electrodes made of vertically aligned nanocolumns of TiO2 with well-controlled oblique angles were grown by physical vapor deposition at glancing incidence (PVD-GLAD). For an electrode thickness of 500 nm, we report a 40% variation on solar cell efficiency (from 0.6% to 1.04%) when the deposition angle was modified between 60° and 85°. Transparent thicker films with higher surface area deposited at the optimal angle of 70° were grown with a zigzag morphology which confers high mechanical strength to the thin films. Using this topology, the application of an electrode thickness of 3 µm in a DSC resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 2.78% maintaining electrode transparency.
1. Introduction
An ideal solar cell should be able to absorb sunlight from the whole solar spectrum, capture as many photons of light as possible, and work independently of the angular position of the sun. New-generation dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1–3 are being designed to take advantage of these features, especially by maximizing light scattering effects to enhance light harvesting.4 However, light scattering reduces the transparency of the cells, a requisite for their incorporation onto glasses or other transparent materials used as substrates when intended for application in building and construction. Conventional DSCs are formed by a porous and high surface area electrode made of TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) which are responsible for the absorption of large amounts of dye molecules accountable for photon collection. To enhance photon collection in these cells, different strategies have been developed consisting of increasing the light scattering or the deposition of an antireflective layer.5 Vertically aligned nanocolumns (nanorods, nanowires, nanotips, etc.) made of semiconductor oxides have been proved to enhance electron transport and reduce the recombination probability in different excitonic solar cells (organic, dye sensitized or hybrid).6–9 Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiencies of these modified solar cells are still far below those obtained with nanoparticle-based electrodes.10 Their lower efficiency has been attributed to the relatively low surface area of nanocolumnar electrodes and some inefficiency of light absorption since some photons fall on the gap between adjacent vertical nanorods.10,11 It is thus expected that the efficiency of this type of solar cells could be enhanced by increasing the thickness if aligned nanocolumnar thin films could be nanostructured to get high surface areas and long nanocolumns. However, when considering the aforementioned applications in building and construction requiring a high transparency, increasing the nanocolumn length can yield an undesired effect: an increase of light scattering and a decrease in the transparency of the DSC devices.
To further investigate around highly efficient though transparent DSCs, we have synthesized transparent TiO2 thin films by the physical vapor deposition at glancing incidence method (PVD-GLAD).12 This method of synthesis furnishes aligned nanocolumnar layers at well-controlled oblique angles. This nanostructure is advantageous for solar collection, as it has already been proved that tilting the nanocolumns improves the light entrapment efficiency. Zigzag and other complex morphologies can be also prepared by this method.13 The resulting thin film electrodes present very open and porous microstructure where nanometre size columns with a high internal porosity are separated by wide pores that extend from the electrode substrate up to the film surface.14 In principle, this nanostructure and porosity are excellent characteristics for the incorporation within the films of different dye molecules and polymers.15–18 Despite these potential benefits provided by the PVD-GLAD technique, little work has been devoted to the development of aligned nanocolumnar electrodes for excitonic solar cells, e.g.dye sensitized solar cells19,20 or hybrid polymer/oxide solar cells.21 Thus, due to the lack of thorough studies on DSCs based on PVD-GLAD thin films and the fact that significant improvements in efficiencies can still be expected, herein we present a careful study of these materials for the development of improved solar cell electrodes. In this line, we carry out a comprehensive study of the electrode morphological factors that may influence the performance of such type of solar cells. Among these factors we consider the effect of electrode thickness, TiO2 crystallinity, topology when arranged into multilayers, the pore structure or the distribution and concentration of dye molecules within the film thickness. We will demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency of DSCs can be enhanced up to 40% by modifying the deposition angle of the TiO2 tilted nanocolumns (for the same electrode thickness). We will also show that the implementation of a zigzag morphology for the TiO2 thin films enhances their mechanical stability and transparency. Our initial results show a 2.78% power conversion efficiency for a DSC based on a 3 µm thick, though still quite transparent TiO2 electrode.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All chemicals were commercial materials used without further purification: methanol (99.8%, Aldrich), ethanol (99.5%, Panreac), and evaporation target TiO (99.99% from International Advanced Materials). Indium-tin oxide (ITO) slides were purchased from pgo-CEC050S (≤50 Ω sq−1). The electrolyte used was Iodolite AN-50 (50 mM tri-iodide in acetonitrile), the dye (Bu4N)2Ru(debpyH)2(NCS) (Ruthenium 535-bisTBA also known as N719), the Pt-paste Pt-catalyst T/SP and a hot melt sealing foil (SX1170) from Solaronix. All the aqueous solutions were prepared using double distilled and ion-exchange water. For comparison purposes, reference cells were prepared with electrodes made of commercial TiO2 nanoparticles from Solaronix.

          TiO2
          electrodes preparation and characterization
Porous TiO2 thin films of variable thickness from 0.5 to 5 µm were prepared at room temperature by the physical vapor deposition at glancing incidence method (PVD-GLAD) in an electron bombardment evaporator reactor. TiO2 was used as a source material and stoichiometric layers of TiO2 were prepared by performing the evaporation in 10−4 torr of O2 during the deposition. Different columnar nanostructures were obtained by placing the flat substrates at a glancing zenithal angle α varying from 60° to 85° with respect to the evaporation source (see Scheme 1). A series of thicker samples were prepared by rotating by 180° around their azimuthal axis (Φ). Each rotation was carried out after a layer of 500 nm was grown and was continued until the desired thickness (from 500 nm up to 5 µm) was obtained with a zigzag topology. The individual layer thickness was controlled by monitoring the evaporation process with a quartz crystal monitor previously calibrated by comparing its response with the thickness of individual films of TiO2. All thin films were prepared with an evaporation rate comprised between 1.0 and 1.5 Å s−1. The as-prepared films used to depict a bluish colour indicating a certain departure from stoichiometry. The films were deposited onto a Si(100) wafer for the SEM characterization. ITO/glass plates were employed as substrates to grow the thin films used as anodes in DSCs. In this case, a thin and compact TiO2 film of approximately 100 nm was deposited at a normal incidence onto the ITO to act as a buffer layer. The as-prepared films were annealed at 440 °C for 6 hours in oxygen flow. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples was carried out in the Bragg–Brentano configuration with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using the Cu Kα line as an excitation source. The microstructure of the films was examined by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), HITACHI S5200, equipped with a field emission gun. Both planar and cross-section views were obtained for TiO2 columnar films deposited on a Si(100) substrate. Cross-section views were obtained by cleaving the sample. UV-visible absorption spectra of the TiO2 electrodes and the dye solutions have been recorded with Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer in transmission or absorption mode. Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling analysis of samples was carried out for the films after the incorporation of the ruthenium dye. It was performed on a TOF-SIMS type ION-TOF IV instrument (IONTOF GmbH, Münster, Germany), equipped with a Bi polyatomic primary ion source, a Cs/electron impact dual source column, and a low-energy electron flood gun (for charge compensation of insulating samples). The incidence angle of both the Bi and Cs ion sources was 45°. The operating analysis conditions were as follows: sputter etching of the surface was accomplished with an electron impact O2+ ion beam of 2 keV (with a target current of 125 nA) rastered over a 300 µm × 300 µm area. A pulsed beam of 25 keV Bi ions, scanned over a 50 µm × 50 µm region centered within the sputtered area, was used to generate secondary ions for analysis in positive polarity. A high current beam of low energy (<20 eV) electrons was employed for charge compensation. The mass resolution (m/Δm) was higher than 6000 and full spectra from 1 to 800 amu were acquired during all the depth profiles.

Owing to the extraordinary small amount of oxide material available in the prepared samples, determination of the porosity of this kind of thin films is not possible by the classical BET methods based on the adsorption of gases (N2, Kr, etc.) at their condensation temperature. To overcome this problem, we have developed a new method based on the use of a quartz crystal monitor (QCM) for the measurement of water adsorption isotherms at room temperature.19–22 Although a full account of the experimental method and the procedure used to extract pore size distributions can be found in previous papers,19–22 it is important to mention here that adsorption isotherms were measured at room temperature by dosing increasing amounts of water vapour in a chamber where a QCM with the TiO2 film deposited on its surface was placed. Prior to the adsorption, the QCM plates were heated under vacuum at ∼120 °C by irradiation with a halogen lamp placed in its vicinity. The possibility of heating the samples prior to the adsorption experiment permits to remove vapors (e.g., water vapor from the atmosphere) irreversibly adsorbed in the samples even after they are kept in vacuum for long periods of time. Once the samples have been heated at 120 °C, they were cooled to room temperature and an adsorption isotherm was measured by following the signal of the QCM as a function of the relative water pressure in the chamber. To get quantitative results, the measured amount of adsorbed water was corrected by the mass thickness of the thin film as determined by both Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and X-ray fluorescence analysis. Pore volumes were estimated under the assumption that once the water vapour saturation pressure was reached, the pores were filled with water. Note that this assumption is only correct for the accessible porosity and that it does not contemplate those pores which are closed or only partially filled with water vapour. The data reported in the paper have been obtained for thin films evaporated at 60, 70, 80 and 85° with a thickness of approximately 300 nm and were normalized to a thickness of 500 nm to make possible the comparison of different film porosities.

          Dye-sensitized solar cells fabrication and characterization

          DSCs were prepared using the TiO2 electrodes and an FTO platinized counter electrode. First, TiO2 electrodes were sensitized with a 0.5 mM solution of (Bu4N)2Ru(debpyH)2(NCS) (N719 dye) for different periods of time (depending on the electrode thickness). Then, the platinized FTO counter electrode with a small hole was hermetically sealed with the TiO2 electrode using a hot melt sealing foil (SX1170, Solaronix) and the electrolyte was introduced using vacuum by capillary forces. A small piece of glass was applied to close the filling hole. The solar simulation was carried out with a KHS Solar Konstant 1200 from Steuernagel Lichttechnik GmBH, Germany. The light intensity was adjusted at 1000 W m−2 with a bolometric Zipp & Konen CM-4 pyranometer. Calibration of the sun simulator was made by several means applying a calibrated S1227-1010BQ photodiode from Hamamatsu and a minispectrophotometer from Ava-Spec 4200. The AM1.5G reference spectrum was according to the ASTM G173 standard. The performance of the DSCs was explored by measuring the I–V curves and IPCE yield of the cells. I–V curve analyses were carried out by sourcing a voltage and measuring the current passing through the device under both illumination of 1 sun and in the dark. I–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2601 multimeter connected to a computer and software. The temperature of the experiments was measured constantly with a digital thermohygrometer (HD2301/01, Afora). Under illumination the intercept with the voltage axis of the I–V curves gives the open circuit voltage (Voc) which is equivalent to the maximum voltage the device can produce. The intercept with the current axis gives the short circuit current (Jsc) which is equivalent to the maximum current the device can produce. The maximum power conversion efficiency that can be extracted from the device during photovoltaic operation is smaller than the product of Voc and Isc by a factor known as the fill factor (FF).

          IPCE, or incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (also called external quantum efficiency, EQE), is the ratio between the number of collected electrons and holes to the number of photons incident to the solar cell. This magnitude is dependent on the wavelength (nm) of the incident light. The estimated IPCE has been represented here as a percentage (%). IPCE analyses were carried out with a QE/IPCE measurement System from Oriel at 10 nm intervals between 300 and 600 nm. The IPCE equipment was calibrated with an S1227-1010BQ photodiode from Hamamatsu before each measurement. The results were not corrected for intensity losses due to light absorption and reflection by the glass support. Desorption of the dye from the TiO2 electrodes was performed after DSC fabrication and characterization. The two electrodes were separated by applying heat and then the sintered TiO2 electrode was immersed in 3 mL of a KOH 1 mM solution for 1 hour. After that time, the solution presented the typical pink colour and the electrode appeared colourless, an indication of the effective desorption of the dye.
3. Results and discussion
The geometry of the physical vapor deposition at glancing incidence method (PVD-GLAD) is represented in Scheme 1. The technique consists of a modification of the classical electron evaporator procedures used by the ophthalmic industry to cover lenses with dense optical coatings, whereby the substrate surface is placed at a glancing geometry with respect to the evaporation source. The evaporation at a glancing angle brings about the formation of a very open and porous microstructure generally formed by continuous (i.e., extending from the substrate up to the surface) tilted columns. The columnar growth in these films results from shadowing effects of the first nuclei deposited on the surface of the substrate. Then, tilted columns of the evaporated material grow in length and leave free a considerable space in the form of pores in-between and inside the columns.20 Tilting angle of the columns (and of the bigger pores) can be varied by turning the substrates around the azimuthal angle Φ (see the scheme).
3.1. Effect of the crystalline structure and the PVD-GLAD deposition angle on solar cell efficiency

Fig. 1 shows a series of SEM micrographs of TiO2 layers obtained by the PVD-GLAD technique at different deposition angles. The tilting angle of the columns, width of the columns and separation between them (i.e. size of the bigger pores) are controlled by the angle formed by the perpendicular to the samples and the evaporation source (α). Tilting angles of 28°, 34°, 44° and 47° were found for the columns of single layer thin films prepared at, respectively, 60°, 70°, 80° and 85° of evaporation angle α. It is apparent in these micrographs the existence of a pore structure consisting of pores that extend from the substrate up to the surface of the films and that the columns increase in width and separation as we move from their bases in contact with the substrate up to their top at the external surface (see insets in Fig. 1). Additional evidence from these micrographs is that the porosity of the films depends on the evaporation angle, the columns appearing more separated for the films prepared at higher evaporation angles.

A comparative assessment of the porosity of the films is possible by the analysis of the water adsorption isotherms recorded for single layer thin films prepared at different evaporation angles. The shape of the adsorption isotherms was similar for all the films and can be categorized as of the type IV, according to the IUPAC terminology (see Fig. 2). This type of isotherms points to the presence in the films of both micropores (i.e., pores smaller than 2 nm of diameter) and mesopores (i.e., pores larger than 2 nm of diameter).22 From the analysis of the isotherms obtained for the thin films prepared at different deposition angles it is possible to estimate their total porosity and the percentage of pore volume that can be attributed to micropores. A summary of the data obtained is reported in Table 1 including the percentage of film volume occupied by the pores and the proportion of empty space attributed to mesopores (i.e.V(meso) = V(total) − V(micro)). The reported data clearly show that both the total pore volume of the films and the proportion of pore volume due to mesopores increase when increasing the evaporation angle.

One of the main interests of analyzing the porosity of TiO2 columnar films intended for DSCs is the accessibility of the pores and the possible occurrence of electrolyte diffusion problems that might entail a decrease of the efficiency of the cell with the illumination time.23 According to the data in Table 1, since the size of mesopores is larger than the molecular size of the N719 dye (i.e., approximately 1 nm), a quite effective sensitization of the thin films can be expected if there are no particular restrictions for diffusion. This is clearly appreciated by looking to the SEM micrographs in Fig. 1, showing that the film surface connects to the film substrate interface through big continuous pores, separating the columns. These big pores and the internal porosity of the columns, the latter likely in the range of small mesopores or micropores, ensure that dye molecules can be distributed through the whole layer thickness.
The as-prepared films were amorphous but their annealing in oxygen at 440 °C renders them crystalline as reported in Fig. 3. Independently of their thickness and deposition angle, the annealed films presented a similar diagram that, by comparison with the pattern of a randomly oriented anatase, do not show any preferential orientation of specific crystallographic planes. Crystal sizes around 89 nm could be calculated by using the Scherrer formula applied to the most intense (101) plane of the diagram. This size is larger than the usual size of crystal domains in the nanoparticles currently utilized for the preparation of titania anodes.24

The potential use of these thin films in photovoltaics was explored by its application in DSC. Assays were carried out by I–V curve analysis, by sourcing a voltage and measuring the current passing through the device under illumination of 1 sun, and also in the dark. Under illumination the intercept with the voltage axis gives the open circuit voltage (Voc) which is equivalent to the maximum voltage the device can produce. The intercept with the current axis gives the short circuit current (Jsc) which is equivalent to the maximum current the device can produce. The maximum power conversion efficiency that can be extracted from the device during photovoltaic operation is smaller than the product of Voc and Isc by a factor known as the fill factor (FF). Moreover, IPCE, or incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (also called external quantum efficiency, EQE), is the ratio of the number of collected electrons and holes to the number of photons incident to the solar cell. It is represented here as a percentage (%), and it is dependent on the wavelength (nm) of the incident light.
An important parameter to control is the dye immersion time for each thin film. We carried out a series of tests with the (Bu4N)2Ru(debpyH)2(NCS) (N719) dye. Four dye sensitized solar cells were prepared applying 500 nm thick TiO2 thin films grown at 60°. Thin films were immersed in the dye solution (0.5 mM in acetonitrile) for different periods of time: 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h. The solar cells were then analyzed by comparing their photovoltaic performances. The power conversion efficiency reported in Fig. 4 shows that an optimum value is already found after 1 h immersion and that the best solar performance is found after 2 h of dye immersion. Since after this loading time the efficiency of the solar cell remained stable, we have established 2 h as the optimal dye loading time for films with 500 nm thicknesses.

Measurements were carried out at 1000 W cm−2 (AM 1.5 G), an active area of 0.2 cm2. 
Optimization of the deposition angle for TiO2 synthesis has been performed by keeping the final electrode thickness at 500 nm. Deposition angles of 60°, 70°, 80° and 85° were studied. The samples were used before and after the application of a thermal treatment (440 °C in O2). Fig. 5 and Table 2 report the results obtained when these thin films are used in DSCs.

As a general trend, solar cells applying the TiO2 columnar thin films without annealing (i.e., amorphous) show low Jsc and Voc values and, as a consequence, lower performances as compared with the devices incorporating the crystalline thin films. Thus, in the first case, power conversion efficiencies were never higher than 0.2%, whereas in the second case efficiencies as high as 1% were obtained. The reason behind this improvement is clearly related to the transition from amorphous to crystalline. Sub-stoichiometric and amorphous oxides are characterized by the presence of high amount of defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies,25 and poor long range order of electronic bands.26Oxygen vacancies (or deep donor states) act as traps for electrons27 and thus, as recombination centers28–30 for electron–hole pairs. As a consequence, a significant reduction of the power conversion efficiency of the device is found. Annealing treatments in oxygen at high temperature induce the removal of oxygen vacancies, defects and other recombination centres,29 and the development of the crystalline anatase structure, all these processes responsible for the observed enhancement of the power conversion efficiency.32 The incorporation of oxygen into the network is also known to modify optical properties of semiconductor oxides affecting their photovoltaic properties.30–33
Comparison of the power conversion efficiency of the DSCs applying only the annealed (crystalline) thin films (same 500 nm thicknesses, single layer) showed a variation from 0.6% up to 1.04% depending on the evaporation angle (see Table 2). The most important difference between crystalline samples referred to the Jsc of the solar cell that was 1.69 mA cm−2 for the sample grown at 85° but doubled up to 3.73 mA cm−2 for the sample grown at 70°.
To understand this behaviour we compared the power conversion efficiency of the DSCs with the dye loading capacity of the TiO2 thin films. To assess the amount of N719 dye incorporated into the films, after its infiltration, the dye was then desorbed as described before.34 Desorption was completed in less than one hour and after this time the solutions presented a pink colour and the thin film a colourless appearance. Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis spectra obtained for the desorbed solutions for each thin film sample, and Table 2 shows the dye concentration obtained after desorption. Samples deposited at 60° and 70° showed a higher dye absorption capacity of about ∼3.5 × 10−6 M cm−2. Meanwhile increasing the deposition angle to 80° and 85° results in a decrease of the dye desorbed, ∼2.45 × 10−6 M cm−2. In principle, the amount of adsorbed dye must be related with the effective surface area and pore volume available for dye adsorption in each sample. Although the values of absorption capacity as a function of the deposition angle might seem contradictory with the fact that the pore volume of the films increases continuously with the deposition angle (cf., Table 1), it must be stressed that part of this pore volume, particularly that of mesopores, should be considered as an empty space not available for the incorporation of dye molecules and therefore lost for light harvesting. Thus, it appears that the compromise between the maximum packing of TiO2 material and the availability of adsorption sites in the micro- and mesopores present in the films is reached for deposition angles around 60–70°. Therefore, in a first approximation, we attribute the maximum cell efficiency found for these thin films to their relatively higher dye loading capacity.

3.2. Effect of TiO2 layer thickness on solar cell efficiency
In an attempt to improve the solar cell performance we synthesized a series of TiO2 nanostructured thin films of different thicknesses at the optimum deposition angle of 70°. In principle, we could grow the TiO2 nanocolumnar thin films by keeping the same azimuthal evaporation angle independently of the film thickness. Yet, we contemplated the possibility of trying of a zigzag nanostructure where layers of different thicknesses were grown by rotating azimuthally the substrate after each 500 nm single layer deposition. The use of this zigzag nanostructure configuration arose because of two main reasons: (a) to improve the mechanical stability of the thin films when increasing the layer thickness and (b) to minimize light dispersion, as discussed next.
An important concern for the preparation of thicker samples by PVD-GLAD is the mechanical stability of the films, a feature that can be critical for the practical manufacturing and use of final DSC cells. Previous analysis by nanoindentation of as-prepared and 440 °C annealed TiO2 columnar films has shown that the crystalline samples present higher hardness and Young's modulus than their amorphous counterparts. Yet, it was found that crystalline samples present a slightly brittle behaviour when subjected to a continuously increased load35 and that the fragility of thicker films could be reduced with the proposed azimuthal rotation after 500 nm single layer deposition. Similarly, we found that while a 5 µm film prepared without rotation induced some scattering of light, an equivalent zigzag film was quite transparent. Fig. 7 shows a cross-section SEM micrograph of an alternate 5 µm TiO2 multilayer consisting of ten zigzag single layers of 500 nm thickness. The ten stacked layers present a topology consisting of tilted columns separated by mesopores quite similar to those in Fig. 1 for a single layer film.

A potential application of DSCs is related to their implementation on glass usable as coloured windows. Even at the expenses of losing some yield, a condition to be fulfilled for this use is that the cell does not scatter the light. A common behaviour in GLAD films as their thickness increases is that some light scattering may occur for wavelengths between the UV and the visible regions of the spectra, in the zone where the utilized dye presents its absorption maxima.17–19 To study this effect in the zigzag films, Fig. 8 shows the UV-visible transmission/absorption spectra recorded for crystalline single and multilayer thin films deposited on quartz with an increased number of zigzag stacked layers. For comparison purposes, the spectrum of a TiO2 thin film layer made of nanoparticles (from Solaronix paste) is also included. The spectra of the PVD-GLAD thin film and multilayers are characterized by a sharp absorption edge and the visible region oscillations typical of transparent films and multilayers possessing a refraction index different from that of the substrate. The shape of the curves reveals that the scattering of light is very small even for a multilayer thickness as high as 5 µm. The transparency of the final cells is also proved by the images of the coloured films (5 µm thickness) obtained after the infiltration of dye which are also reported in the figure. By contrast, the spectrum of the nanoparticle thin film presents a reduced transmission in the visible region which is more intense for λ < 550 nm indicating that in these films there is a considerable scattering of light. PVD-GLAD thin films with a thickness of 5 µm prepared without rotating the substrate (i.e. single layer thick films) presented an even higher scattering of light evidenced by a high loss of transmission in this spectral region (spectra not shown). This loss of transmission, coinciding with the absorption zone of the N719 dye, can be beneficial for enhancing the efficiency of the cell, but will drastically decrease its transparency.

The transmission spectrum of a nanoparticle thin film and the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye solution are included for comparison. The film photographs reported in the top of the figure correspond to a 5 µm zigzag film infiltrated with the dye proving the high transparency of the final cells. 
A correct and homogenous distribution of the dye within the whole TiO2 layer thickness is a requisite for an optimum performance of the cell. To prove that the dye was evenly distributed through the whole layer thickness, we carried out a series of experiments with multilayer zigzag films of increasing thickness. These tests are important as the necks formed between nanocolumns between one layer and the next one could hinder the diffusion of dye through the entire layer. A first type of experiments to check the free diffusion of dye molecules through the pores of the zigzag films consisted of desorption experiments similar to those presented in Fig. 6 for single layer films. These experiments demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of the multilayer zigzag films is directly related to the thin film thickness. This was calculated by multiplying the optimal dye loading time of the 500 nm thin film (i.e. 2 h) by the number of stacked layers. It will be shown below that the absorption capacity grows with the layer thickness except for the thickest films tested (i.e., 5 µm) where a decrease in absorption capacity was observed. To ensure that not only the adsorption capacity was similar in the multilayers but also that the dye is homogeneously distributed through the whole layer thickness, we carried out TOF-SIMS analyses of TiO2 multilayers after dye adsorption. The experiments were carried out on TiO2 crystalline samples grown with a zigzag configuration at 70° deposition angle. The layer thickness was 2 µm (i.e. four stacked layers) and the dye immersion time 8 h. The resulted TOF-SIMS analyses of this glass/ITO/TiO2 thin film infiltrated with the N719 dye are shown in Fig. 9. This figure shows that the Ru signal (from the N719 dye) is quite flat and runs parallel to that of Ti till it reaches the ITO/glass substrate. At this point, the intensities of the Ru and Ti signals decrease sharply and the signal for the In increases, as expected. The silicon signal, very small when the dye loaded TiO2 is being sputtered away, increases sharply in intensity when reaching the glass substrate. This behaviour clearly proves that the dye is homogenously distributed within the entire thickness of the thin film and that an optimized dye loading of the zigzag TiO2 layers is obtained by following the selected infiltration protocol. This result also discards the existence of any diffusion restriction for the dye molecules from one layer to the following one.

Once proved the reliability of the infiltration protocol, we checked the photovoltaic performance of a set of 70° TiO2 electrodes with different thicknesses. For these experiments the film thickness was varied from 500 nm up to 5 µm, the immersion time in the dye solution was 2 h per 500 nm thickness. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 3. In general, an increase in the power conversion efficiency (Fig. 10C) was observed when increasing the electrode thickness, a trend which is in good agreement with that observed for I–V curves and the intensity of IPCE at 530 nm as shown in Fig. 10A and B. In this plot only the behaviour of the 5 µm thick cell represents an exception as it presents a lower efficiency than the 3 µm cell (Fig. 10C). This lower efficiency must be associated with a considerable lower filling factor found for the corresponding DSC (Fig. 10A).

As stated above, a critical parameter controlling the performance of DSCs is the amount of dye that can be incorporated within the TiO2 electrodes. To correlate the efficiency of the solar cells with the amount of infiltrated dye within the TiO2 thin film layers as a function of thickness, desorption of the dye was carried out (as described above). The corresponding UV-vis spectra of the obtained solutions are shown in Fig. 10D. Fig. 10C compares the power conversion efficiency obtained for the DSC for each electrode thickness and the concentration of dye desorbed (in M cm−2) for each thin film. We can observe that the power conversion efficiency and the dye concentration follow similar trends. This correlation clearly proves that the decrease in the power conversion efficiency observed for the 5 µm cell is due to the lower amount of dye incorporated within thin film. This decrease in absorption capacity could probably be an indication of certain limitations imposed by this electrode morphology to the infiltration of a higher amount of dyes. This point will be further investigated by systematically changing the angles and other experimental parameters during the synthesis of the PVD-GLAD zigzag thin films.
To further assess the potentiality of the DSCs based on PVD-GLAD thin films we have compared the previous results with the power conversion efficiency and dye loading capacity of an electrode made of commercially available nanoparticles of TiO2 (from Solaronix). A 2.5 µm thick colloid electrode gave a power conversion efficiency of 3.37% when applied in a DSC, and a dye loading capacity of 4.5 × 10−5 M cm−2. These values, although slightly higher, are close to the 2.26% efficiency and 1.68 × 10−5 M cm2 obtained for a 2.5 µm thick electrode made by the PVD-GLAD method (see Table 3).
There are a few works found in the literature using GLAD thin films as electrodes for DSC or hybrid polymer/oxide solar cells (HSCs).19–21 For example, Kiema et al. apply obliquely deposited single layer TiO2 layers which result in a 3% efficiency.19 Nevertheless, their electrode thickness of 10.3 µm is much higher than that presented in this work (3 µm). The group of Yang et al. reports an efficiency of 2.78% for an electrode thickness of 4 µm, i.e., a similar efficiency to that reported by us.20 Nevertheless, these authors carried out the DSC analyses applying an incident power of 650 W m−2 which yields higher power conversion efficiencies than those obtained at 1 sun or 1000 W m−2. Besides, in these previous works a careful analysis of the optical properties of the films and performance for different film preparation parameters is missing, a feature that precludes their direct use as transparent DSCs and to predict their performance under other working conditions.
Conclusions
Transparent thin film electrodes made of aligned and tilted nanocolumns of TiO2 with well-controlled oblique angles were grown by the physical vapor deposition at glancing incidence method (PVD-GLAD). By using crystalline TiO2 electrodes of 500 nm thickness we were able to demonstrate the existence of an optimum deposition angle of 70º. The application of this thin film resulted in 1.04% power conversion efficiency. This enhancement has been attributed to the increase in the dye loading capacity of the thin films. A zigzag nanostructure of the TiO2 thin films made of stacks of 500 nm layers deposited at the optimum 70° angles was applied to grow thicker films. This configuration ensured good mechanical stability and high transparency for the films. The power conversion efficiency was observed to increase with electrode thickness, reaching a conversion efficiency of 2.78% for 3 µm electrodes of quite good transparency. The high transparency of the obtained cells supports its implementation onto coloured glass and other related applications. Further studies are necessary to clarify the factors controlling the infiltration capacity of films with a thickness higher than 3 µm.
