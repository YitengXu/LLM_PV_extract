    , Accepted 10th November 2021First published on 12th November 2021AbstractThe porphyrin-containing metal- and covalent-organic frameworks, respectively MOFs and COFs, are quite versatile porous nanomaterials for hetero-photocatalysis. Indeed, they are capable of catalysing the photoinduced reduction of CO2 and metal, contaminant degradation, H2 and O2 evolutions, photodynamic therapy, and thermotherapy, and biomimicry. Concurrently, they are also efficient photocatalysts for a large variety of organic reactions. This mini-review presents a comprehensive account of the current state of the art in this area and includes several examples of CO2 transformation for the preparation of plus value chemicals such as methane and cyclic carbonates, formation of peroxides including Juglone, ascaridole and Artemisinin, ketones from benzyl alcohols and N-methylquinolinium salts, and imines from the photooxidative coupling of benzylamines and 2-aminobenzamides, selective oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides, hydroxylation of aromatic boronic acids, various cases of C–C formations from diazo compounds and stable C–H bonds and oxidative Mannich reactions, C–P bond formations from aerobic cross dehydrogenative-coupling reactions with amines, and C–X bond activations (X = H, F, Br), reduction of nitroaromatics, dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinolines, deprotection of aromatic ketones from their corresponding aryloxathiolanes, and asymmetric Strecker reactions. It also includes pertinent details regarding the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of types I and II occurring during photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes within the porous heterogeneous nanocatalysts, which play a major role in the transformation of organic molecules.
1 Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials composed of metallic clusters connected to organic ligands through coordination bonds forming porous 2D- and 3D-networks. Concurrently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are built upon both organic nodes and organic linkers, also generating 2D- and 3D-materials. Among the organic ligands and organic linkers one finds the porphyrin pigments, which are serving as crucial building blocks for the design of functional porous 2D- and 3D-MOFs and COFs, along with their nanosized versions. The historical development of porphyrin-based MOFs has recently been reviewed.1 Concurrently, porphyrin-based COFs have been the subject of a recent review.2 Because of the obvious chromophore properties of these dyes, applications in photosensitization and photocatalysis have been topics of increasing interest.3–5 Indeed, several reviews addressing specific topics were also recently reported, such as photo-induced CO2 reduction,6 contaminant degradation,7 H2 evolution,7 photodynamic therapy and thermotherapy,8 and biomimicry.9 Recent concomitant investigations of parallel applications such as photo-driven O2-evolution,10 and metal reduction also exist.11–13 In fact, the number of research publications focussing on the photocatalytic properties of MOFs and COFs have experienced a quite impressive increase over the past three years or so (Fig. 1). Photocatalytic transformation of organics by porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs is also an important topic of research, and selected studies have been sporadically mentioned in general reviews.1–5 However, a comprehensive review specifically dedicated to this subject has yet to be reported. This mini-review targets these applications and includes the generation of oxygen reactive species (ROS), general structures of MOFs and COFs and their related properties, and the various organic syntheses being performed by porphyrin-based photocatalysis.

2 Structures and properties of MOFs and COFs
The rational design and structures of 2D- and 3D-MOFs14 and COFs15,16 are well documented. Several representative examples are provided in Fig. 2–4. The construction of porphyrin-based MOFS and their metallo-derivatives relies on anchoring arms, notably carboxylates and pyridyls. Their role is to bind metallic nodes or clusters, often called secondary building units. One of the most employed organic ligands is the tetra(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (MTCPP4−; M = 2H). It can form 2D- (Fig. 2)17 and 3D-MOFs (Fig. 3).18

Reproduced from ref. 19 with permission. Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society. 
Concurrently, the construction of 2D- and 3D-COF differs. The 3D-COFs are generally built via a [4+4] condensation of quadrilateral and tetrahedral motifs (Fig. 4a). Examples of quadrilateral and tetrahedral motifs are provided in Fig. 4b and c. In parallel, the design of 2D-COFs concerns the use of quadrilateral building blocks (like porphyrins) only condensed with linear bridges, and leads to the formation of J-aggregates (i.e. slipped cofacial porphyrin arrays). An example is provided in Fig. 4d. The structural characterization of these COFs relies on powder XRD coupled with computer modeling as these materials are often partially amorphous. The key issue in the context of this review is the pore size, perhaps more than the surface area measured by adsorption isotherms of gases using the BET technique. In the two examples provided in Fig. 2 and 3, distances describing the opening of 1.7 and 1.9 nm are depicted. Therefore, these nano-beakers can only accommodate organic molecules of smaller dimensions.
3 Photogeneration of reactive oxygen species and excitation energy migration
There are two major routes for the generation of ROS and consequently these pathways differ as well. These ROS are O2˙−, ˙OH, and ˙O2H for type I, and 1O2 for type II, generated through a photoinduced electron or energy transfer, respectively. Type I ROS are generated from the hole–electron pair, also called charge-separated states, formed within the semiconducting nanomaterial (note that MOFs20–22 and COFs23–25 are semi-conducting materials; conduction band = CB; valence band = VC) or composite (Fig. 5, middle and right) upon irradiation (eqn (1)–(4)). The positions where the holes (h+, sometimes called polarons) and electrons (e−) accumulate are presented in Fig. 5. Evidence of polarons and electrons is provided by the effect of specific scavengers on the rate of photocatalysis (methanol and ethylenediaminetetraacetate for polarons, and silver ions for electrons, are examples). Similarly, evidence for type I ROS, notably hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, can be obtained using scavengers such as thiourea and dimethyl-thiourea common to both ROS, or specific scavengers such as Mannitol and dimethylformamide (DMSO) for ˙OH and 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate for O2˙−. A spin trap such as 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, DMPO, can also be employed and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The latter exhibits specific signatures in the EPR spectra depending on whether there are O2˙− or ˙OH in the medium.26 MOF (or COF) + hν → MOF* (or COF)*(1) MOF* (or COF)* → MOF h+/e− (or COF h+/e−)(2) MOF e− (or COF e−) + O2 → O2˙− + MOF (or COF)(3) MOF h+ (or COF h+) + H2O → ˙OH + H+ + MOF (or COF)(4)Type II ROS are generated via the photosensitization of dioxygen in its ground state (3O2) using porphyrin chromophores (Porph) included in either the MOF27 (Fig. 5, left) or COF19,28 structures. The photophysical processes are presented in eqn (5)–(8) with → and  being radiative and non-radiative processes, respectively: Porph + hν → 1Porph*(5) 1Porph* + 3O2 → Porph + 1O2 + heat(6) 1Porph*  3Porph* + heat(7) 3Porph* + 3O2 → Porph + 1O2 + heat(8)Upon excitation with visible light, Porph in its ground state is promoted to the lowest energy singlet excited state 1Porph*. A portion of these species relaxes to the lowest energy triplet excited state, 3Porph*, through a non-radiative intersystem crossing (isc) process. Both species, 1Porph* and 3Porph*, have enough energy to transfer a part of it to molecular oxygen. Upon gaining energy, molecular oxygen (3O2) becomes singlet oxygen (1O2; reactions (6) and (8)). The particularly longer-lived triplet excited state (3Porph*) generally in the microsecond to millisecond range, which is more prone to efficient energy transfer due to the larger probability of collisions with molecular oxygen in the medium. The excited state lifetime of 1Porph* generally spans from picosecond to nanoseconds depending on the metal center, if any. Evidence of the presence of 1O2 can be obtained using scavengers and spin traps. An example of a 1O2 scavenger is sodium azide, and an example of a spin trap is 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl (TEMP), which reacts with 1O2 to form 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO). The latter exhibits a characteristic triplet EPR signal of equal intensity.29

(b) Drawing showing the photoinduced generation hole–electron pair (h+ and e−) within a MOF (in this example, the TCPP ligand contains Cu(II)) followed by the generation of O2˙− and ˙OH (ROS type II). Note that generation of 1O2 is always possible. (c) Drawing representing a heterojunction composite built upon a semiconducting nanoparticle (NP) and a MOF, which upon excitation generate hole–electron pairs along with the ROS type I. Note the electron transfer process (NP*/MOF → NP+/MOF−; charge separated state), which prevents facile hole–electron recombination. 
The efficiency of ROS generation is generally augmented in porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs, compared to porphyrin pigment alone in the solid state. Absorption of photons is a random process and consequently the formed exciton is not necessarily located near oxygen molecules. In well-structurally organized materials, such as crystals, excitons can migrate efficiently (see blue arrows in Fig. 5; left), in comparison with more amorphous materials. In the latter situation, an immobile exciton would simply relax in a non-radiative fashion, turning the light energy into heat. The main reason for this efficiency is geometry. Well-aligned chromophores are a prerequisite for efficient exciton migration. Indeed, the diffusion lengths of the singlet excitons has been reported to be 16.6 nm in nano-MOFs thin films.30 The corresponding diffusion coefficient is 9.0 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, which is comparable to other excellent organic semiconductors. An even longer diffusion length of 60 nm was also reported for porphyrin-based MOF.31 In the number of porphyrin units, up to 45 porphyrins were also defined as the diffusion limit in another study.32 In relation to photosensitization, triplet excitons were also investigated. Indeed, triplet excitons are also found to be very mobile within MOFs with transfer rates occurring in the order of 1010 s−1.33 Finally, the time scale of the migration of triplet excitons was found to be ultrafast (i.e., ∼1 ps).34 All of these photophysical data point to the conclusion that regardless of the nature of the exciton, singlet or triplet, the excitation energy can rapidly expand well over nano-MOFs of dimensions ranging from 17 to 60 nm. On the COF side, there seems to be no investigation focussing on the exciton migration across the materials. Because of the most plausible formation of J-aggregates, it is reasonably anticipated that similar phenomena (i.e., ultrafast exciton migration and long diffusion lengths) occur, based on the similar experimental results that are described below.
4 Photocatalysis for the transformation of organic molecules
As stated in the Introduction, photocatalysis performed by nanosized MOFs and COFs has been the subject of several reviews,2–7,9 but no review has been devoted to applications in organic chemistry. The only exception to this statement concerns for the photocatalysis of CO2,6 which was originally a topic driven by environmental devotion (CO2 reduction into CO). With time, the preparation of a few plus value chemicals from CO2 became the dominant motivation. In this section, various photocatalytic properties of nano-MOFs and nano-COFs towards the transformation of organic molecules are described.
4.1 Photocatalysis of CO2 into CH4 and cyclic carbonates
The photocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide by MOF-based porphyrins is a subject of current interest.35,36 The section briefly presents several representative examples of the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 relevant to the topic of this review. The conversion of CO2 into methane is clearly attractive and has been exploited several times (Table 1).37–43 The common feature is that the mechanism involves the formation of type I ROS, meaning water, in the liquid state or vapour, is always the co-reactant and used as the sacrificial agent. The coproducts are always CO in amounts that are in the same order of magnitude, which represents a drawback when their separation is required for further use. Occasionally, other products issued from reactions with type I ROS are observed, such as H2O2 and HCOOH, generally found as minor products or traces (not indicated in Table 1). However, this is not always the case. For example, COF-367-Co, where the cobalt atom was incorporated inside the porphyrin, either in the form of Co(II) or Co(III), showed that in fact HCOOH is the major product.43 In other studies, CH4 and CO are not even observed.44–46 Instead, formate was produced with sometime the parallel side products carbonate and hydrogen carbonate as detected by 13C NMR spectroscopy using 13CO2 enriched reactant.44 This drastic difference with the other studies stems from the slower kinetic of the hole–electron pair recombination. In this investigation, the electron is localized on the zirconium cluster (Zr6(μ3-OH)8(OH)8, presumably under the form of Zr(III), and the recombination is found to be very slow due to shallow trap states within PCN-222. In conclusion, the distribution of products seems to depend on the relative quantity of hole–electron pair sites. Formate is also considered a plus chemical, and the optimum conditions for its formation have not been the subject of investigation yet.

The observation of carbonate is not unique and related compounds can lead to other plus chemicals. This is the case for the capture of CO2 by epoxides forming cyclic carbonates. The latter can, in turn, lead to various environmentally friendly polycarbonates,47 many of which also find applications in medicine.48 MOFs and COFs are well-known heterogeneous materials which catalyse the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.49 However, these energy demanding reactions require high pressures (up to 30 bar) and high temperatures (up to 160 °C). Alternatively, sunlight, room temperature and reduced pressure can also be employed with appropriate photocatalysts to perform the same task.50–54Table 2 reports these investigations detailing the nature of the catalysts used and the relevant information concerning them, along with the best experimental conditions to achieve complete conversion of the epoxide into the corresponding cyclic carbonate (based on GC-MS analyses).

In one case, the isolated yield was reported to be 71%.53 In this specific investigation, the photoconversion of styrene oxide into styrene carbonate (Scheme 1) was tested using a mixed-ligand MOF (Th-IHEP-5) consisting of [Th6(COO)20(DMF)4(H2O)2(μ3-O)2] as node and H2TCPP4− and 2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dicarboxylate (Fig. 6, top). The authors correctly proposed the formation of a hole–electron pair formation upon irradiation in the visible spectrum. This photoinduced electron transfer most likely occurs from the electron-rich porphyrin unit to the neighbor thorium(III)-containing node and the proposed mechanism proceeds as shown in Fig. 6 (bottom). This mechanism is reminiscent of that known for the thermal process,49 except that the reactive intermediates are radicals issued from electron and hole transfers from the excited Th-IHEP-5.

Bottom: Proposed mechanism according to ref. 53. Note that the epoxide molecule most likely binds the thorium metal upon substituting a water or DMF molecule for the node, not the N-atom of the porphyrin as suggested by the authors. 
Photocatalytic conversion of alkane epoxides was also investigated. In a recent study, several MOFs (Bi-PCN-224, PCN-224, TCPP4−, Bi-PCN-224, Bi-TCPP4−) were compared for the ability to photocatalyze propylene epoxide (the sacrificial agent tetrabutylammonium bromide, TBAB).52 The reaction conditions were 1 bar of CO2, 300 W xenon lamp, for 6 h, and the conversion rate ranged from 19% (no catalyst) to 99% (Bi-PCN-224). It was demonstrated that the presence of the Zr-cluster played a key role in the mechanism (i.e., in agreement with the mechanism presented in Fig. 6, bottom) as the ligand alone (TCPP4−) provided a conversion of only 20% (i.e. similar to no catalyst). In a parallel study on styrene oxide, uranyl-containing MOFs, IHEP-9 ([(UO2)4K2(MTCPP)3(H2O)10]; M = Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Co), were probed as photocatalysts.50 The structure of IHEP-9 consists of an interwoven 3D-lattice as shown in Fig. 7 (M = Mn), where the pore sizes are 16 and 18 Å, which are large enough for small organic substrates. The photocatalytic efficiency of IHEP-9 (0.1 MPa of CO2, RT, 12 h, 45 W Xe lamp) vary as Mn(II) (∼100%) > Fe(II) (95%) > Zn(II) (85%) > Cu(II) (67%) > Co(II) (47%). Other epoxides were studied and good conversion rates, TON and TOF were obtained (Table 3; the experimental conditions are listed in Table 2). The proposed mechanism follows that shown in Fig. 6 (bottom).

The photocatalytic conversions of other n-alkane epoxides were also performed using a different catalyst ([{Mn(TCPP)0.5(H2O)2}·2H2O]n, MOF-1; Fig. 8) and TBAB.51 Under identical conditions (0.1 MPa of CO2, 24 h of irradiation, 3 lamps of 30 W), the conversion percentage turned out to be proportional to the n-alkane chain length (R-epoxide; R = n-H17C8 (38%) < n-H9C4 (50%) < n-H5C2 (87%) < ClH2C = H3C (100%)) suggesting that the steric parameter influences the conversion rate. Note that the trends of the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) vary in the same direction. By comparison, the conversion of styrene oxide is 60%, consistent with the steric consideration. Interestingly, the photocatalytic conversion of epichlorohidrin (ClH2C-epoxide) turned out to be systematically either equally (to those exhibiting nearly 100% conversion) or more performant than its thermal catalytic conversion using a large variety of MOFs throughout the literature. The proposed mechanism involves the photothermal loss of a water molecule on Mn(II), which is then coordinated by the epoxide. Then, a bromide anion attacks the epoxide group inducing a ring opening. Then this step is followed by a CO2 insertion, ring closure, and elimination of the cyclic carbonate product. This proposal is similar to that presented in Fig. 6 (bottom), but proceeds without and electron transfer from the MnTCPP ligand to the mono-Mn node.

4.2 Photooxidation of organics
Two types of ROS exist. ROS type II involves the photosensitisation of singlet oxygen (eqn (5)–(8)) and the oxidation of organics is the most basic outcome from this reactivity. This section provides several types of photooxidation reactions of simple organic molecules.

4.2.1 Peroxide formation. 
The classical case for this reaction is the photosensitized oxidation of substituted derivatives of 9,10-diphenylanthracene (reaction a, Scheme 2) and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF; reaction b) but does not bear a large synthetic implication in organic synthesis. Instead, these chemicals are used as an indicator for singlet oxygen, monitored via changes in absorption (i.e., colorimetry) and fluorescence spectra, and several examples where porphyrin-based MOFs are used as photosensitizers are known.55–59

However, other examples exist such as ascaridole and Artemisinin. The former is the natural terpenoid product and its complete (100%) photocatalytic synthesis from α-terpinene (Scheme 3) has been achieved using a composite Pt@PCN-224(Zn) where Pt is a nanocrystal.58

The synthesis of Artemisinin, a well-known multitherapeutic agent, can be photochemically achieved from dihydroartemisinic acid using either 2D- (Fig. 9) or 3D-MOFs (PCN-222 in Fig. 3).60,61 For PCN-134-3D and PCN-134-2D, the photocatalytic conversion of dihydroartemisinic acid to Artemisinin in CH2Cl2 (O2 bubbling, LED lamps 150 W, 5–10 °C, 3 h) in 72 and 99% conversion rate, and 37 and 53% yields, respectively. Concurrently, using PCN-222 and its metallated versions PCN-222(M) (M = Ni, Zn. Co), in the presence of a small amount of sulfuric acid, the conversion rates reached 97–98% and ranged of 51 to 71%.

4.2.2 Ketone formation. 
The oxidation of organics may proceed with the formation of ketone functions from alcohols or ethers. An example of the latter case is the ether-containing molecule DPBF (Scheme 2, reaction b), which after forming a peroxide intermediate, prolonged irradiation leads to a diketone product. A classic application of the photocatalytical oxidation of organics is the synthesis of juglone, a natural product found in leaves, roots, husks, fruits, and black walnuts. The reaction proceeds from the oxidation of 1,5-dihydroynaphthalene (hydrojuglone; Scheme 4). This reaction is photosensitized by various 2D- and 3D-MOFs.17,55,59,62

The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl58,63,64 (Scheme 5) and alkyl65 alcohols has also been investigated using various porphyrin-based MOFs and hybrid materials as catalysts (Table 4). The proposed mechanisms are provided in Fig. 10 and involve both type I and II ROS. Evidence for these ROS has been provided using spin traps and EPR spectroscopy.63,65

The catalytic photooxidation of simple alkanes using the porous metallophthalocyanine-based COF (CZJ-30; Scheme 6 and Fig. 11 left) using N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) as co-catalyst, which is oxidized into phthalimide-N-oxy (PINO) radical and H+, has also been reported.66 Note that phthalocyanine belongs to the same pigment category of porphyrins. The conversion of alkanes into valuable alkyketones ranges from 55 to 97% depending on the substrate after 24 h (350 W Xe lamp; λ > 400 nm). At first, the prolonged period of irradiation and the occasionally modest conversion rate (55%) suggests poor efficiency in these cases, however, considering the C–H bond strength of alkanes, even in α-position of an aromatic group, this performance is commendable. The proposed mechanism states a Fenton-type reaction generating type I ROS (Fig. 11 right). The first intermediate is the alcohol, which then photocatalytically oxidizes into the corresponding ketones, presumably through a mechanism resembling that shown in Fig. 10c.

Photocatalytic carbon oxidation has also been performed on substituted N-alkyl(iso)quinolinium salts in air using the composite Pt@PCN-221 (i.e. platinum nanoparticles as a guest species prepared from the rapid photodecomposition of K2PtCl4 placed inside the MOF, Fig. 12, right) and CsCO3 used as catalyst and co-catalyst (Scheme 7).67 The reported yield is ∼93% (i.e., best yield) after 2 h of irradiation for the conversion of N-methyl(iso)quinolinium iodide into 1-methyl-2-quinolinone (reaction on the left hand side of Scheme 7). Note that the yield using PCN-221 alone is 25.6%. The mechanism was elucidated using hole and electron scavengers, EPR spectroscopy to detect porphyrin π–cation (i.e. electron transfer from the excited porphyrin to the Pt nanoparticle) and spin trap of singlet oxygen and fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the emission of 1O2 (Fig. 12, left). The photocatalytic oxidation of various N-methyl(iso)quinolinium salts (13 in total) and the isolated yields range from 70 to 95% for irradiation ranging from 1.5 to 3 h.

The rather standard photocatalytic synthesis of imines from amines using MOFs and COFs as catalysts, which often exhibits quantitative or quasi-quantitative conversion upon short irradiation time, and is also documented (Scheme 8 and Table 5).24,68–70 Again, both type I and II ROS are detected during this oxidative coupling using either MOF or COF photocatalysts. The presence of both types of ROS increases the efficiency of the oxidation processes. The structures of the COFs and MOFs along with the two proposed mechanisms are placed in Fig. 13.

A synthetic application of the photocatalytic coupling of amines is the preparation of quinazolin-4(3H)-ones from 2-aminobenzamide and substituted benzyl using an iron-modified MOF, Fe@PCN-222(Fe) as a photocatalyst in the presence of air, has been reported (Scheme 9).73 The reaction proceeds through a one-pot three-step tandem process (oxidation–cyclisation–oxidation). It is worth noting that the photo-induced one-pot three-step tandem reaction catalyzed by MOF is not particularly common, but has been observed before.68

In this case, iron(III) units were incorporated inside both the metal cluster (see proposed structure in Fig. 14, left) and the porphyrin center as FeCl, based on XPS data. Numerous substrates were investigated permitting one to survey the versatility of the method (Table 6). The proposed mechanism (Fig. 14, right) involves a primary photoinduced electron transfer from the porphyrin chromophore to the bimetallic node, thus reducing Zr4+ in Zr3+ first. Then, an intra-node reaction, Zr3+ + Fe3+ → Zr4+ + Fe2+, takes place, which in turn triggers the Fenton-type reaction, thus forming the superoxide radical anion (type I ROS). Despite the long visible light irradiation time and the rather modest turnover frequencies (0.09 < TOF < 0.15 h−1), the isolated yields are interesting (60–79%) taking into account that a 3-step reaction is involved.

4.3 Photooxidation of sulfides
The facile photocatalytic oxidation of sulfides is the reaction that has been the most investigated (Scheme 10 and Table 7).53,58,62,74–78 It is often used to test the photocatalytic properties of newly designed MOFs or COFs. It is noteworthy that the sulfoxide derivatives are formed as major products (>90%) or almost exclusively (>99%), and that the corresponding sulfodioxides are essentially quasi-inexistent. The proposed detailed mechanism (according to an investigation) is illustrated in Fig. 15,53 and involves the photo-induced generation of both singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anions as ROS. The efficiency can be qualitatively addressed by the TOF or TON when available, but also the amount of time required to have a 100% conversion. However, the nature of the irradiation source, light flux, rate of O2 intake (pure O2 at 1 atm, or in the presence of air, and bubbling vs. no bubbling), the nature of R1 and R2 (in Scheme 10) being different from one investigation to another make reliable comparisons difficult, if not impossible.

4.4 Photohydroxylation of arylboronic acid
The photocatalytic hydroxylation of arylboronic acid (aryl is mainly a substituted phenyl group; examples including biphenyl and 1-naphthyl exits) is also considered a test reaction to assess the photophysical properties of MOFs (Scheme 11 and Table 8).71,82 To the best of our knowledge, this reaction has not been tested using COFs as photocatalysts. These two investigations have proposed a mechanism requiring the use of a base (trialkylamine) acting as a cocatalyst or sacrificial agent. Both catalytic cycles are almost identical and involve the use of superoxide radical anion, which is predictable due to the use of a redox agent (i.e., trialkylamine). These mechanisms are presented in Fig. 16 for convenience. The difference stems from the reuse of the amine cation in the cycle. Moreover, although the triplet state of TCPP4− is invoked to be responsible for the electron abstraction from the base, thermodynamically the singlet state can also perform this reaction based on the larger driving force of this upper state. However, the longer-lived triplet excited state increases the probability of electron transfer. The isolated yields range from 88 (rare) to 100% (mostly quantitative), regardless the nature of the (small) substituent (R), its position, and number (one or two).

4.5 Photo-induced C–C bond formation
The C–C bond formation is often viewed as an important target reaction for the construction of organic molecules. In the context of heterogeneous photocatalysis, this review illustrates that the presence of oxygen may not be beneficial for that purpose. In fact, extensive photooxidation generally leads to the degradation of organics, which turns out to be useful in the area of decontamination of water and air.83 However, obvious exceptions to this tendency exist (for example, the oxidative Mannich reaction described below). Both porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs have demonstrated the ability to photocatalyze reactions forming C–C bonds (Table 9).71,78,84,85

The promotion of C–C bond formation from the photoinduced cleavage of stable C–H bonds is interesting under mild conditions (Scheme 12).84 In one detailed investigation, a large scope of diazo compounds was tested using a semiconducting porphyrin-based MOF, Ni-TCPP(Ir), as a catalyst (Fig. 17). The structure of this MOF is reminiscent of that of PCN-600.87 In Ni-TCPP(Ir), an Ir–Cl group is located in the center of the porphyrin, and the Ni(II) is part of the SBU as Ni3(μ3-OH). The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a carbene intermediate upon interaction between the diazo compounds and the iridium(III) center upon dissociation of the chloride (Fig. 18). It is noteworthy that metal-carbene complexes are generally unstable without the presence of a heteroatom, thus this intermediate is considered highly reactive. Upon excitation with visible light, a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) takes place going from Ir(III) to the coordinated carbene ligand, thus generating an anion radical. Upon interactions with the ethyl diazoacetate compounds, a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction takes place (R-H + IrIV-CH˙-CO2Et → R˙ + IrIV-CH2-CO2Et) followed by a radical oxidation coupling (Cl− + R˙ + IrIV-CH2-CO2Et → R-CH2-CO2Et + IrIII-Cl).

Another example of the formation of a C–C bond is found in the oxidative Mannich reaction using the MOF UNLPF-12 mentioned above (Scheme 13). The resulting yields, evaluated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, range from 83 to 98% for irradiation time going from 7 to 48 h. Based upon spin-trapping experiments using EPR spectroscopy, the presence of hydroxy radicals and super oxide radical anions allowed for the proposal mechanism. After absorption of visible light by the porphyrin chromophore, thus populating its singlet excited state, an electron transfer from the aromatic amine to the porphyrin occurs. Then, the porphyrin radical anion reacts with O2 to generate O2˙−. The exact position of this electron in the MOF on Sn(II) or the cluster node, is unclear, nonetheless the yields are good to excellent (Fig. 19).71

Other heterogeneous photocatalytic C–C bond formations have been reported using porphyrin-based 2D-COFs. For example, a 2D-COF (2D-CPF) was constructed using tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin and tetrakis(4-nitrophenyl)porphyrin (Fig. 20) and was used as a photocatalyst for a selective C–H activation on heteroatom-containing aromatics by diazo compounds (Scheme 14).

 Scheme 14  Photocatalytic C–H bond activation and C–C bond formation using 2D-COF. 
After optimization of the conditions, namely, regarding the solvent (DMSO) and the number of equivalents of heteroaromatic compounds to be employed, both the resulting yields and selectivity turned out to be excellent (Table 10). The proposed mechanism involves a primary electron transfer from the excited porphyrin to the diazo-aromatic compound followed by a radical propagation (Fig. 21).

Another example of a photocatalyzed formation of C–C was recently reported and consists of a defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl aromatics (Scheme 15).86 This reaction is interesting since it involves the activation of a relatively strong bond, C–F, prior to the formation of a C–C bond. The structure of the 3D-photocatalysts, COF-1 (free base porphyrin) and COF-2 (Cu(II)-porphyrin), was modeled using X-ray data (Fig. 22). This 3D-COF structure exhibits different topologies of cavities (indicated in colour). Spin trapping experiments in the presence of oxygen using TEMP and DEMPO, evidence of singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals were provided. The latter species is indicative of radical-type reactivity of the 3D-COF. Using cycloheaxanethiol, CySH as a sacrificial agent, a series of alkenes was investigated (Table 11). The isolated yields turned out to be average, most likely due to a parasite reaction consuming one of the intermediates. The proposed radical-type mechanism is provided in Fig. 23. The primary step consists in a photoinduced electron transfer (SET) from the excited photocatalyst to 1,3-CF3-C6H4-CF3, thus generated the radical anion 1,3-CF3-C6H4-CF3˙−. The latter eliminates fluoride to generate the electrophile radical 1,3-CF3-C6H4-CF3˙ responsible for reacting with the olefin. The role of CySH is to provide the necessary H˙ to complete the cycle, but can also competitively quench 1,3-CF3-C6H4-CF3˙, thus most likely explaining the average isolated yields.

4.6 Special topics
Several other photocatalyzed reactions by porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs are now described. The first case is the bromide elimination from α-bromoacetophenones forming the corresponding arylacetophenones (Scheme 16).88 The square-grid COF photocatalyst (PFT) is synthesized by the reaction between the free base 5,10,15,20-tetra-(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin and bridge 2-vinylbenzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde. In polar solvents (best with MeCN) and Hantzsch ester, PFT photocatalyzes a series of α-bromoacetophenones in quantitative yields (99.9%; see list in the caption of Scheme 16) for irradiation times varying from 1 to 3 h in visible light. Although not specifically investigated, the fact that this photocatalyzed reaction works best in polar solvents suggests the presence of photoinduced electron transfer process, thus forming a charge separated state, which is known to be better stabilized in polar solvents. Consequently, it is plausible that the mechanism may be of a radical type.
 Scheme 16  Photocatalytic bromide elimination form α-bromoacetophenones (R = H, 4-Cl, 3-Cl, 3-OMe, 4-OMe, 4-Br, 4-NO2, 3-NO2, 1-NO2; DIEPA = diethylpropylamine). 
The next case involves the photocatalytic deprotection of oxathiolanes to ketones by a MOF, P-1, formulated as Zn3(TCPP)(bpy)1.5(DMF)3(H2O)4 according to the chemical analysis (Scheme 17).89 In this investigation, clear evidence of the contribution of singlet oxygen only (i.e., there is no formation of type I ROS). For irradiation ranging from 90 to 100 min (under 1 atm of O2, 300 W Xe lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm)), the conversion rate turned out to be 97 to 100%.
 Scheme 17  Photocatalytic deprotection of oxathiolanes (R = Ph, 4-Br-C6H4, 4-Me-C6H4, 4-MeO-C6H4, 4-AcO-C6H4, 4-AcNH-C6H4, for examples). 
The photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatics (Scheme 18) by a 2D-MOF MOF1 (Fig. 24), was also reported.90 MOF1 consists of a coordination polymer of general formula [Ni3(Ni-HTCPP)2(μ2-H2O)2-(H2O)4(DMF)2]·2(DMF) (Fig. 24, left). The X-ray structure reveals the presence of a binuclear node composed of water and DMF molecules. The 2D-MOF stacks into a 3D supramolecular framework where small channels are formed of dimension ∼5.0 × 9.0 Å2. BET N2 isotherm measurements provide the low surface area of 80.4 m2 g−1. The photocatalytic reduction of several representative nitroaromatics (see list in the caption of Scheme 18) is found to be very efficient where full conversion is observed after 1 to 6 h of irradiation The only exception is the α-nitronaphthalene, which has been converted to a level of 36% only after 24 h. This outcome most certainly stems from the small pore size of the cavity, and that the slower reactivity arises more from a surface process than a host–guest phenomenon. For shorter periods, the common nitroso-, azoxy-, azo-intermediates are observed, but are eventually converted with a longer irradiation time. It is noteworthy that the ligand alone, Ni(TCPP)H4, does not photo-catalyze this reaction, which sheds light on the possible mechanism for this reaction, at least for the primary step. The authors intuitively proposed a synergetic electron migration across the 2D-layer π-stacking. However, it seems rather more plausible, based on other investigations described herein that the primary photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the TCPPH4 ligand in its singlet excited state to the nodes where two nickel atoms are in the oxidation state 3+ (i.e. Ni(TCPPH4)*–Ni(III) → Ni(TCPPH4)+–Ni(II)). Moreover, these are linked to labile water and DMF molecules, which can be substituted by nitroaromatics. Upon contact with these generated Ni(II) species, the latter species can then transfer an electron to the nitroaromatics. The TOFs values were found ≤50 h−1, which can be considered rather modest, which is in line with the average conversion rate.

The photocatalytic carbon-phosphorous bond formation using porphyrin-based MOFs has also been reported recently.91 In this case, the visible-light driven processes were performed via aerobic cross dehydrogenative-coupling reactions (Scheme 19), and the tested photocatalyst was PCN-224 metalated with iridium(III) chloride (Ir-PCN-224). This MOF exhibits n-type semiconducting properties, which makes it prone to generate type I ROS upon visible light illumination. The optimization reaction concerns the case where R = Et in Scheme 19 (λ ≥ 420 nm, in CH2Cl2) and the conversion rate reached 93% (based on 1H NMR spectroscopy) after 14 h with good TOF (332 h−1) and TON values (4650). For comparison, PCN-224 (i.e., free base) and Rh-PCN-224 (rhodium equivalent) performed poorly (i.e., after 6 h, conversion rate ≤40%, TON ≤ 40, TOF ≤ 6.7 h−1). The scope of this photocatalytic reaction was tested with Ir-PCN-224 in CH2Cl2 (Scheme 19) and the isolated yields turned out to be average to good (45–83%), explained by the formation of by-products. Spin-trapping experiments demonstrated the formation of the superoxide radical anion and singlet oxygen, and both are suspected to be key intermediates in the mechanism. Indeed, the quenching reaction using benzoquinone confirmed the presence of a superoxide radical anion. The proposed mechanism (shown in Fig. 25) highlights the contribution of a hydroperoxide radical and passes through a P–H bond activation, but no detail was provided for this last step. The presence of by-products was explained by the plausible reactivity of the hydroperoxide radical. However, a reactivity of the ubiquitous singlet oxygen is also possible as well, illustrated with other similar substrates shown in Scheme 7 above.

Note that the chirality of the C*–P carbon was not addressed.

The concept of chirality was alluded to in the above investigations. To address such cases, one has to provide a chiral environment. COF designs can easily be adapted to form homochiral COF (HCCOF). In a recent study, a design was performed to prepare a HCCOF, (R)-CuTAPBN-COF (Fig. 26), from 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrincopper(II) (Cu-TAPP) and 6,6′-dichloro-2,2′-diethoxy-1,1′-binaphthyl-4,4′-dialdehyde ((R)-BINOL-DA).92 This HCCOF can perform the photocatalytic asymmetric Strecker reaction (Fig. 26). The target molecule was (S)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl)acetonitrile ((S)-CIK), which is essential for the synthesis of (S)-clopidogrel. The latter compound is an important antiplatelet and antithrombotic drug. Upon irradiation (300 W xenon with a power density of 2.5 W cm−2; λ = 420 nm) for 3 h in air, and optimized conditions, the conversion rate for the preparation of (S)-CIK was 98% based on 1H NMR spectroscopy, with an enantiomeric excess of 94%. The phototriggered reaction proceeds via a photothermal action where an increase of 25 °C (ΔT) of the HCCOF-containing solution occurred. This photothermal reaction also occurs in sunlight and a temperature up to ∼47 °C was observed. Using a fixed-bed continuous-flow model photoreactor, this reaction could be scaled up to the gram level.

Another application of porphyrin-based MOFs concerns the radical photocatalytic polymerization of polymethylmethacrylate (H2CCMeR → (-CH2-CMeR-)n; RC(O)OMe.93 In this study, the semi-conducting M-MOF-545 (Fig. 27) was used as a photoreducing agent, in which the porphyrin pigment was used as a free base or was metalated with zinc(II). The cocatalysts were N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) and CuBr2, and ethyl α-bromo-isobutyrate, EBiB, as initiator. After optimization of the experimental conditions using 5 h irradiation (420 nm < λ < 800 nm) at room temperature and M = zinc(II), the best conversion rate was 52% with a number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (Mn/Mw) determined by gel permeation chromatography of 14000 and 1.36, respectively. Similar results were obtained for n-butyl methacrylate (conversion = 40%; Mn ∼ 22900; Mn/Mw = 1.22), i-butyl methacrylate (conversion = 34%; Mn ∼ 18940; Mn/Mw = 1.21), methacrylate (conversion = 57%; Mn = 16050; Mn/Mw = 1.33), and tert-butyl acrylate (conversion = 53%; Mn = 19070; Mn/Mw = 1.37). Styrene could not be polymerized using the same initiator (EBiB), suggesting that steric hindrance may be an issue in this photocatalytic reaction. Computer modeling could have confirmed this hypothesis.

Another investigation involving a photocatalytic polymerization process over a MOF was just reported.94 This work involved the design of ultrathin (∼2.7 nm) porphyrin-based 2D MOF using ZnTCPP as ligand and the paddlewheel Zn2(COO)4 unit as node. This MOF material was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and UV-vis spectroscopy. This 2D-material photocatalyzes a fast electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerisation of metacrylate 2-(n-butyltrithiocarbonate)propionic acid (BTPA) as the RAFT agent and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent. The irradiation conditions were violet, λmax = 405 nm; blue, λmax = 470 nm; green, λmax = 565 nm, orange, λmax = 595 nm and red, λmax = 680 nm, at 10 mWcm−2 and the photocatalytic activity decreased according to λviolet ≈ λgreen > λorange > λblue > λred. This trend fits the position of the strongest absorption feature of the 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets and the polymerization was 80% completed in just 18 min. This material also showed tolerance towards singlet oxygen with no impact on the polymerization rate when in the presence of dioxygen.
The last topic concerns the visible-light-driven dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinoline at RT in the absence of acceptors (Fig. 28b).95 In this investigation, the authors demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between the weighted average reciprocal of distance between active sites (D−1) defined by D−1 = (1/N)∑ni(di)−1, where D is the weighed average distance, N is the number of active sites, n is the number of adjacent porphyrin centers of a specific site placed at a given distance d (Fig. 28a). In brief, the TOF value is larger when, in a multistep process, the distance between the active sites is small and the number of neighbor sites is larger. The linear relationship between TOF and D−1 (Fig. 28c) is logical but has never been illustrated in the context of MOFs as a photocatalyst prior to this study. Any data point located on the dotted line means that the efficiency of the photocatalysis is regulated by distance. Above and below this line, the efficiency is found beyond and under distance regulation. The mechanism for this photocatalysis was not addressed, but it is fair to say that the driving force is the gain in the aromaticity of the final product and that the mechanism is of radical type, somewhat reminiscent of Fig. 25.

5 Discussion
This minireview has gathered a large scope of photocatalyzed organic reactions by porphyrin-based nano-sized MOFs and COFs, allowing for the use of visible light as a clean energy source. It has also stressed a number of issues limiting the scope of their applications. These issues include the size of the organic substrates limited by the pore size (see Fig. 28a for some examples of center-to-center distances), the occasional presence of parallel reactions leading to by-products, the ubiquitous presence of two types of ROS when performed in the presence of oxygen, highly heterogeneous experimental conditions used from one investigation to another, scope limitations of aromatic-containing substrates, namely phenyl, and a fine line between the isolation of the target molecules and simple photodegradations. Concurrently, when optimized, the isolated or spectroscopically observed yields can be excellent (≥90% and often even ≥99%) in most cases. Any deviation from this trend stems from the presence of parallel photoreactions such as, for example again, the ubiquitous generation of the two types of ROS (Fig. 25). Furthermore, these reactions are conveniently and exclusively conducted at room temperature, thus avoiding any undesired thermally driven parasite processes. Moreover, several examples included the interesting use of sunlight to address the potential application of photocatalysts outside laboratory conditions. These experiments turned out to be successful. This condition also allows these photocatalytic reactions to be conducted at room temperature, but does not exclude the possibility of taking advantage of a possible and sometimes beneficial concurrent photothermal effects.
On only one occasion, the irradiation condition was set at AM = 1.5 (∼1000 W m−2). This setting is common for the evaluation of the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) and allows for the comparison of a solar cell from one laboratory to another. Ideally, such a set-up would also allow for the comparison of the photocatalytical efficiency, namely, characterized by the evaluation of TOFs and TONs, of one system with another under optimized conditions. Without this standard setting, the reported TOFs and TONs cannot be reliably compared from one investigation to another, consequently, neither can the nature of the MOF or COF as a photocatalyst. Moreover, it is also noteworthy that contrary to the measurements of the specific surface areas obtained from N2 isotherms (BET analysis), which is often reported, the binding constants of the organic reactants and the size of the MOF and COF nanoparticles are generally unknown in these investigations. These two dimensions are known to be key parameters directing the efficiency of the photocatalytical processes in MOFs and COFs. This became evident when the comparison of the efficiencies (TOFs, TONs, and conversion rates) of the MOFs or COFs vs. H2TCPP4− or MTCPP4− were made. The former materials offered systematically better efficiencies, meaning that a larger binding constant provides better catalyst–substrate interaction.
One of the underestimated or perhaps simply not mentioned features in the research papers is the photoinduced degradation of organic substrates. Indeed, the ambivalent use of air or pure oxygen promotes the necessary generation of the superoxide radical anion to trigger the desired reaction, but in some cases this can lead to decomposition. In fact, porphyrin-based MOFs are well known to act as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for the eradication of organic pollutants and toxins.83 This intrinsic property has a double potential effect. First, upon longer irradiation time, significant decomposition may occur. Second, the formation of radical type intermediates and types I and II ROS inside the MOFs and COFs can also cause sensitive damage to these organic-containing materials, which in overall may sensitively decrease the TOF and TON efficiencies. In fact, a very small number of studies included stability tests as part of their characterization.
Even though these nanomaterials are catalysts and consequently are used in minimal amounts, they are likely to be discarded after photoreactions. Knowing that their preparations under solvo-thermal conditions are tedious as often multiple attempts must be made prior to isolating the desired nanomaterials, and require centrifugation for the separation of the nanosized MOFs, the overall cost of these nanocatalysts may be underestimated. The combination of the need for catalyst stability and their cost calls for consideration of the use of a continuous flow photoreactor.
One of the important recurrent features in this review is the systematic use of substrates containing phenyl or small-size aromatic as starting reactants. The reason for this situation is that the aromatic groups, particularly when they are substituted by electron withdrawing groups, are easier to reduce than entirely alkane derivatives. Similarly, the semiconducting properties of these nanomaterials can, upon excitation, form an electron–hole pair (TCPP4−*—metal node → [TCPP4−]˙+—metal node˙−). The hole can then abstract an electron from the organic substrate, which again is easier when the aromatic contains an electron rich group (i.e., an amine). The only exception is the photocatalytic polymerization of methacrylate derivatives. The latter reaction is initiated by ethyl α-bromo-isobutyrate and is co-catalyzed by the redox-active CuBr2.
The ubiquitous formation of types I and II ROS can be convenient for oxidation processes since both types can oxidize organics. However, type I ROS can also trigger radical reactions and the parallel mild oxidation caused by singlet oxygen can lead to parallel undesired by-products. A good example is illustrated in Fig. 25. To remedy this situation, one can try to improve the rate for charge separation (i.e. TCPP4−*—metal node → [TCPP4−]˙+—metal node˙−) so that the relative amount of metal node˙− (responsible for the generation of super oxide radical anion and other type I ROS) drastically surpasses that of TCPP4−* (responsible for the generation of singlet oxygen). This can be achieved by using different metals, namely, a third row redox-active metals such as Fe(II), for example, which is known to generate Fenton-like reactive intermediates, including hydroxy radicals. However, upon generating these highly reactive species, holes˙+ are equally generated and are equally reactive. Indeed, these species are the primary reason for the degradation of organics.83 In conclusion, there is a balance between achieving a target photocatalytic organic reaction and an undesired photoinduced decomposition. The outcome appears to be a kinetic issue.
One of the interesting reactions covered by this review is the photocatalytic tandem reaction. Tandem reactions occurring in MOFs and COFs under thermal conditions have been reported before.96–99 Under photocatalytic conditions, a one-pot three-step tandem process (oxidation–cyclisation–oxidation) has also been reported.73 However, this particularly useful process seems to be under exploited in the context of MOFs and COFs as photocatalysts. It is also interesting to point out that several photocatalytic reactions occurring inside MOFs produce amines,89 and in parallel amines may also be photo-catalytically converted into imines (Table 5). Although on this paper this appears to be possible, the tandem processes are also particularly vulnerable to undesired parallel reactions as the number of intermediates increases.
MOFs and COFs can be viewed as nanorecipients with the particularity that the interior of the pores can be modulated to render the active chiral. This concept has been tested in porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs as well,100,101 and tested with measurements of the host–guest binding constants,102 sensor applications,103 and enantio-selective reactivity.104 The application of chiral MOFs have also been reviewed.105 Because of the particularly mild conditions employed during the photocatalytic reactions (i.e., visible light at RT in the presence of air), the use of homochiral MOFs and COFs as photocatalysts appears to be quite attractive. It is somewhat surprising that only one investigation on the subject has appeared so far.92
A seemingly glaring omission in the reported investigations so far is the design of nano-porous photocatalysts as composites. Composites of porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs are well known to be efficient as photosensitizers and photocatalysts for applications in photodynamic therapy,106 eradication of bacteria and fungi in biological media,107 and degradation of pollutants and toxins in water and in the gas phase.83 One of the reasons is the extra synthetic steps in preparing them, but more importantly, the combination of two semiconducting materials provokes, upon irradiation, the formation of a long-standing electron–hole pair. Prior to recombination, the longer-lived reactive sites generate rapidly and in large quantities both type I and II ROS, and the hole sites are generally responsible for the efficient oxidation of organics. In brief, composites of MOFs and COFs have the unique property of being too reactive for any useful synthetic applications and their absence in this review are normal as stand-alone porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs tend to operate more mildly as photocatalysts.
The comparison between MOFs and COFs as heterogeneous nanosized photocatalysts in organic synthesis is also interesting. Despite the rather small sampling of the COFs materials, the efficiencies of both types of materials makes no doubt; complete conversion of the starting materials is observed in most cases, but not all, often in the time scale of hours or less. Some advantages and disadvantages, or characteristics, have been noticed (Table 12). The smaller sampling of COFs is due to the more recent discovery, or at least exploration, of this type of photocatalytic material relative to the 3D-MOFs. The two most significant differences are first these type are dominated by 3D- and 2D-dimensionality for the MOFs and COFs, respectively, and the possibility of generating larger pore size with 2D-COFs, which appears one limitation in MOFs. For the construction of MOFs, 3D-clusters serving as nodes tend to statistically direct their ligands in the three directions rather than two. For COFs, the 3D-structure is obtained only when a tetrahedral node is employed along with the planar or linear ligands. In brief, this outcome is entirely decided by the investigators. One may also wonder how much is the photocatalytic activity due to interlayer surface interactions relative to those due to the pores. This aspect have seemingly never been addressed. This observation has a direct consequence on the molecular size of the reactants that could be used, relative the more size-limitating pores that one may find in 3D-MOFs. Finally, the type of ROS generated has a direct consequence on photocatalytic outcome and mechanism of transformation is bonded to the presence of a charge separated state. This state is prone when the material is semi-conducting. In this respect, MOFs are more prone to photo-induced electron transfer between the metallic node and the porphyrin ligand and consequently to the generation of the charge separated state (responsible for the formation of type I ROS. In COFs, this situation is less encountered.

6 Conclusion
For the past decade, MOF/COF-based photocatalysis proved important for H2-evolution and photodegradation of some organics in general including networks constructed with porphyrin-based ligands,108,109 but the use of nanosized MOFs and COFs as photosensitizers and photocatalysts for applications in organic synthesis has increased drastically over the past three to four years (Fig. 1). The most attractive feature is the possibility of efficiently operating at room temperature under sunlight. This feature is commendable considering the presence of C–H bond activation during the photoprocesses and often leads to the formation of C–C bonds under mild conditions. In general, the catalytic parameters TON and TOF, when provided, are found to be significantly superior for the MOFs and COFs than that of the stand-alone TCPP-containing ligands. These properties are due to the good binding ability of organic substrates inside the porous materials and the intrinsic formation of valence and conduction bands leading to the photoinduced formation of the electron–hole pair, which is necessary for the generation of type I ROS. The stand-alone chromophore cannot accomplish these two tasks. There are of course some drawbacks. The biggest limitation is the size of the substrate vs. the pores. The second challenge is the presence of side reactions. These parallel reactions occur when simultaneous photogeneration of both types of ROS occur, one type being undesirable. This occurrence stems from their relative kinetic parameters, which can only be changed by a major change in the MOF or COF component. One possible avenue for development, or at least exploration, is the design of porphyrin-based MOF/COF hybrids. To the best of our knowledge, only several examples were reported in the literature,109 but none were applied for the photo-induced transformation of organic molecules (excluding photodegradation). Moreover, the photocatalytic H2-evolution has been known for quite some time using porphyrin-based MOFs, but one wonders whether photo-induced hydrogenation of olefins could be promoted using nano-sized MOFs. All in all, this minireview illustrates the possibilities of these nanomaterials as photocatalysts and future development are clearly anticipated.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Graph representing the number of research articles reporting the photocatalytic properties, including photosensitization, of porphyrin and metalloporphyrin-based MOFs (blue) and COFs (green). This library research was performed with Scifinder (date July 2021).	 

 	Fig. 2  Left: General structure of MTCPP4−. Right: Illustration of a 2D-MOF containing Ni-TCPP and a (Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(OH)6(H2O)6(COO)6) cluster (structure in Fig. 3 left; the cluster-to-cluster distance is 17.143 Å). Reproduced from ref. 17 with permission. Copyright 2018 Wiley-VCH.	 

 	Fig. 3  Structures of MOFs issued from the reactions between H2TCPP4− and zirconium salts (i.e. ZrCl4 or ZrOCl2). The center-to-center distance between the porphyrins is 19.226 Å. Adapted with permission from ref. 18 Copyright (2020) Elsevier.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Classic strategy for the design of 3D-COFs via [4+4] condensation of tetrahedral and quadrilateral building blocks. (b) Typical example of a tetrahedral unit (tetra(p-aminophenyl)methane). (c) Three quadrilateral building blocks for the synthesis of COFs including porphyrin: from left to right, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene, 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-benzaldehyde)porphyrin (metallated or free base), and ethylenetetra(4-benzaldehyde). Reproduced from ref. 16 with permission. Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society. (d) Example of a 2D COF using 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-phenylamino)porphyrin-(metal(II)) (M = 2H, Cu, Pd) and dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde as starting materials. The spacer-to-spacer distance is 2.5 nm.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Scheme showing the exciton migration process (blue arrows) followed by a possible energy transfer to molecular oxygen to generate 1O2 (ROS type II). (b) Drawing showing the photoinduced generation hole–electron pair (h+ and e−) within a MOF (in this example, the TCPP ligand contains Cu(II)) followed by the generation of O2˙− and ˙OH (ROS type II). Note that generation of 1O2 is always possible. (c) Drawing representing a heterojunction composite built upon a semiconducting nanoparticle (NP) and a MOF, which upon excitation generate hole–electron pairs along with the ROS type I. Note the electron transfer process (NP*/MOF → NP+/MOF−; charge separated state), which prevents facile hole–electron recombination.
