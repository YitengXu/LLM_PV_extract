    , Accepted 25th February 2014First published on 25th February 2014AbstractLow-cost and high-yield preparation of CuInSe2 films is the bottleneck for promising CuInSe2-based thin film solar cells. Here, we developed a simple, safe and cost-effective method using thioacetic acid to fabricate the absorber films of CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe). Dissolution of Cu2O and In(OH)3 in thioacetic acid was attributed to the strong coordination ability of S. The adhesive precursor solution can be prepared without any heating, centrifugation and inert gas protection, superior to the previously reported methods. The precursor CISSe layer was easily deposited in air by spin coating to ensure low cost. Uniform and compact CISSe thin films with well-crystallized and pure-phased CISSe grains were obtained after one step annealing. The as-prepared CISSe thin films were successfully applied to solar cells and a energy conversion efficiency of 6.75% was achieved. This facile preparation provides a low-cost and easy method to fabricate Cu-based thin film solar cells.
1. Introduction
Cu-based chalcopyrite is one of the most important light absorber materials for thin film solar cells due to high absorption coefficients, good photo durability and a desired band gap range. These materials include CuInS2 (CIS), CuInSe2 (CISe), CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) with record photovoltaic efficiencies of 12.5% (CIS) and 20.4% (CIGS) in lab.1,2 However, the deposition of Cu-based absorbers by the vacuum-based methods (e.g. sputtering3,4 and co-evaporation5–7) involves highcost and produces a lowyield, which hinders mass-production of large-area solar cells.
Non-vacuum solution-based deposition methods possess the advantages of simplicity, high throughput and inherent low investment requirements. So far, promising conversion efficiencies (>10%) have been achieved.8,9 Solution-based deposition techniques include nanoparticle ink-based techniques,10–12 electrochemical depositions,13–15 pure precursor solution methods,16–18etc. While nanoparticle ink-based techniques usually involve complicated synthesis and purification processes, electrochemical depositions also have significant drawbacks such as bad atomic stoichiometry control because of the wide differences in the standard potentials of Cu, In, Ga and Se.19 In contrast, pure precursor solution methods generally provide a high yield, are simple in the scale-up process, and have precise stoichiometry control at the molecular scale.20,21 The hydrazine-based solution method has been successfully used to fabricate high-efficiency thin film solar cells because of the excellent ability of the solution to dissolve metal chalcogenides such as Cu2S and In2S3,9,22–24 Nevertheless, the highly toxic and explosive hydrazine is a barrier for the mass production of those films. It is essential to develop a facile, green and low-cost method to prepare an air-stable precursor containing Cu, In and S (and/or Se), which is an important direction for the current non-vacuum CISSe-based solar cells.
In this paper, we proposed a thioacetic acid-based solution method to fabricate CISSe thin films. The raw materials copper(I) oxide and indium(III) hydroxide were found for the first time to be dissolved in a thioacetic acid-based solution with the assistance of ammonia. Compared with other metal sources (metal chloride, nitrate, etc.), using Cu2O and In(OH)3 could lead to pure CISSe films without introduction of impurity anions like Cl, N, etc. In addition, thioacetic acid was stable enough to operate without inert gas protection, and it can be easily removed completely by heating (boiling point, 93 °C), leading to no carbon residue. A sulfide raw film was formed before annealing with thioacetic acid as the sulfur source, avoiding the long annealing time25 or usage of explosive H226 which was required in the annealing process for oxide raw films. More importantly, the metal ion and thioacetic acid form stable and soluble metal complexes owing to the strong coordination ability of thioacetic acid. Above all, thioacetic acid was an ideal sulfur source and essential ligand in the precursor. The preparation process of the precursor was simple and secure without heating, centrifugation20 and inert gas shielding.27 All processes could be operated in air using the safe and stable precursor. Small molecule organic solvents (isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, etc.) could be easily evaporated, leading to a low carbon content in the final films. The starting materials were commercially available and cheap, further lowering the cost. Uniform and compact CISSe thin films with good crystallization and large grains can be obtained through this facile solution-based method. The CISSe thin film solar cells were successfully assembled and a conversion efficiency of 6.75% was achieved.
2. Experimental
2.1. Precursor solution preparation
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. 0.8 mM of copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, analytical grade) and 2 mM of indium(III) hydroxide (In(OH)3, 98%) (Cu/In = 0.8) were added to a solvent mixture of 6 mL isopropanol (C3H8O, analytical grade), 1 mL ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, analytical grade) and 1 mL propylene glycol (C3H8O2, analytical grade). After stirring for a few minutes, 2 mL of thioacetic acid (CH3COSH, 93%) was added, and the color of the suspension turned from dark white to black. Then ammonia was added into the suspension under continuous stirring at room temperature until an orange-red, clear precursor solution was obtained. The other two precursor solutions with a Cu/In of 0.9 and 1.0 were also prepared under identical conditions for comparison.
2.2. Deposition of CISSe thin films
The CIS thin films were deposited via a spin-coating method from the as-prepared precursor solution on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conducting glass or molybdenum-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates. Each layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 20 seconds and subsequently dried on a heating plate at 300 °C for 3 minutes to evaporate the organic solvents. Spin-coating and drying processes were performed several times until the desired thickness was obtained. Finally, the CISSe thin films were formed through one step sulfuration and selenization at 500 °C for 30 minutes in a graphite box annealing system with H2S gas and some elemental Se powders.
2.3. Device fabrication
CISSe-based thin film solar cells were fabricated with the structure of glass/Mo/CISSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag. The Mo layer was deposited onto the SLG substrate by direct current (DC) planar magnetron sputtering. The ∼60 nm thick CdS buffer layer was deposited on the CISSe layer by chemical bath deposition (CBD). Then i-ZnO (∼60 nm) and AZO (∼800 nm) layers were deposited by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on top of a CdS layer as the buffer layer and a transparent conduct electrode (TCO). The Ag grid electrodes were deposited by DC planar magnetron sputtering. The solar cell area was then calculated to be 0.4 cm2 by mechanical scribing. Fig. 1 illustrates the whole process including deposition of CISSe thin films and fabrication of CISSe solar cells.

2.4. Characterization
The crystalline and phase identification of the CISSe thin films was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD Bruker D8 Focus) using a monochromatized source of Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) at 1.6 kW (40 kV, 40 mA). Raman spectra were recorded on a Thermal Dispersive Spectrometer using a laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm at a laser power of 10 mW. UV-vis absorbance spectra were recorded from 500 to 2000 nm on a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer with a scanning velocity of 300 nm min−1. Top-view field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were acquired using a FEI Sirion 200 by energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis. Cross-sectional FESEM images were acquired using a Hitachi S-4800 by EDS analysis. The energy conversion efficiency of solar cells was measured using a Keithley Model 2440 source meter under AM 1.5 illumination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Newport QE system equipped with a 300 mW xenon light and a lock-in amplifier.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Dissolution mechanism
A facile thioacetic acid-based solution method to fabricate CISSe thin films was proposed. Thioacetic acid was always used in organic reactions but seldom applied for synthesis of inorganic sulfide.28–30 In this work, thioacetic acid was a special constituent which assisted the dissolution of Cu2O and In(OH)3. The S in thioacetic acid had a strong coordination ability to coordinate with metal ions and form soluble and stable metal complexes. However, a sulfide precipitate rather than a clear and transparent precursor was formed when thioacetic acid was added alone. So addition of alkali (NaOH, ammonia or amines) was necessary to obtain the precursor solution. The alkali can draw off the H of –SH to exhibit the strong coordination ability of S. In our study, ammonia was chosen because it could be eliminated easily. The N in ammonia was not considered as the dominant ligand to coordinate with metal ions because the dissolution could be achieved by adding NaOH instead of ammonia. The dissolution procedure is shown below:  The dissolution process could be finished in five minutes under continuous stirring at room temperature. The precursor could be directly used for spin-coating without any post-treatment and was stable for more than 3 months in air at −4 °C, indicating its long-term stability.
3.2. Structural analysis
XRD analysis was performed to verify the crystallization of the as-prepared CIS and CISSe thin films on FTO glass. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of thin films annealed at different temperatures with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8. The observation of characteristic peaks of CIS with weak intensity and a broad shape indicated the formation of the CIS phase even before annealing.25,26 The crystallization increased slightly after annealing at 300 °C, and without an obvious increase after annealing at 400 °C. The diffraction peaks rarely shifted to a lower theta value, which indicated that Se vapor hardly reacted with the CIS raw film and a few of the Se atoms replaced S atoms in the crystalline lattice of CIS below 400 °C. When the annealing temperature was increased to 500 °C, the intensity of XRD peaks of the CISSe phase increased significantly, indicating the formation of the CISSe thin film with good crystallization. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks systematically shifted to lower theta values compared with CIS since Se substituted for S in adequate amount. The XRD patterns of CISSe films with diverse Cu/In ratios annealed at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 2b. All of the diffraction peaks could be assigned to the CISSe phase without any detection of the impurity peak.

Raman spectroscopy was used to further investigate the composition of CISSe thin films. The Raman spectra of the as-obtained CIS and CISSe thin films annealed at different temperatures with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8 are shown in Fig. 2c. The peak at 300 cm−1 with a shoulder at around 328 cm−1 of the as-obtained CIS thin film could be assigned to the typical molecular vibration of CIS.28 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak was comparatively wide, which was probably caused by the low crystallization of the CIS thin film, consistent with the XRD result.31 After annealing at 300 °C, a relatively weak peak appeared at 194 cm−1 in addition to the vibration of CIS, suggesting the formation of CISSe, as the peak position was located between that of CIS at 300 cm−1 and CISe at 179 cm−1. After annealing at 400 °C, the peak intensity was enhanced with position shifting from 194 cm−1 to 199 cm−1, indicating an increased Se/S ratio in the annealed thin film. When the annealing temperature increased to 500 °C, the typical Raman peak of CISe was found at 179 cm−1 with a shoulder at around 214 cm−1. Additionally, one small peak at 295 cm−1, near the peak at 300 cm−1 of CIS, indicated the formation of CISSe thin films. The high intensity with narrow FWHM of the peak at 179 cm−1 showed the good crystallization of the annealed thin film, consistent with the XRD result as well. Considering the stronger peak intensity of CISe at 179 cm−1 with the weaker peak intensity of CIS at 295 cm−1, the Se content was much more than the S content in the annealed CISSe thin films. Furthermore, a weak peak near 258 cm−1 should come from copper selenide15 at an annealing temperature below 400 °C, suggesting the appearance of copper selenide at low temperature. However, this weak peak disappeared and no other signal of copper sulfides and selenides was detected when the annealing temperature reached 500 °C. As shown in Fig. 2d, copper selenide could still be detected for CISSe thin films deposited with Cu/In ratios of 0.9 and 1.0 solution after annealing at 500 °C, and the peak intensity of copper selenide increased with the increasing Cu/In ratios. As we can see from Fig. S1 (ESI†), copper selenide was formed after the low temperature annealing process, the same as that observed in the case of a Cu/In ratio of 0.8. Therefore, the residual copper selenide phase in CISSe films probably resulted from the copper selenide that arose at an early stage of the annealing process and could not be eliminated to form a single CISSe phase after annealing at 500 °C.
3.3. Composition and optical band gap
EDS was used to measure the content of elements in thin films. Table 1 summarizes the changes in the Cu/In ratios at each processing step with different Cu/In ratios in the precursor solution. However, the Cu/In ratios in CISSe thin films were a little less than that in the precursor solution. Given that the Cu/In ratios in CIS raw thin films were almost the same as that of the annealed CISSe thin films, this loss of Cu might be caused by the formation of volatile Cu-organic species in the precursor solution which were volatilized in the spin-coating process.25 As shown in Fig. 3a, the Cu/In ratios in annealed CISSe thin films could be effectively adjusted by controlling the Cu2O and In(OH)3 components in the precursor solution. As calculated from the UV-vis absorption measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†), the band gap Eg of CISSe thin films annealed at 500 °C could be slightly adjusted by the Cu/In ratios (Fig. 3a). The Eg values of CISSe thin films deposited from the precursor solution with Cu/In ratios of 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 were 1.18 eV, 1.14 eV, and 1.09 eV, respectively.

(b) S/(S + Se) ratio and Eg variation in CISSe thin films (Cu/In = 0.8 in precursor solution) as a function of the annealing temperature. 
Otherwise, the S/(S + Se) ratios in CISSe thin films (Cu/In = 0.8 in the precursor solution) decreased with increasing annealing temperature, as shown in Fig. 3b. When the annealing temperature was below 400 °C, the S content accounted for more than 50% in CISSe thin films. The relatively high Se content (>40%) could be originated from the copper selenide and preliminary formation of the CISSe phase, suggested by the XRD and Raman results. The S content decreased obviously after annealing at 500 °C, which could be attributed to the substitution of Se with S in the crystalline lattice and the formation of the CISSe phase. The band gap Eg of the annealed thin films changed with the annealing temperature, namely the S/(S + Se) ratios. As the annealing temperature increased, the Eg decreased from 1.42 eV to 1.18 eV due to the increasing Se content in thin films (Eg of CuInS2: 1.52 eV, Eg of CuInSe2: 1.04 eV), as shown in Fig. 3b.
3.4. Absorber morphology
The morphology of as-prepared CISSe thin films was studied by FESEM. The top-view FESEM images of CISSe films with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8 annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). No grain was formed and the surface appeared amorphous in the CIS raw film. When the annealing temperature was below 400 °C, small grains were observed with a grain size smaller than 100 nm, leading to the low crystallization of the thin film. A dense and compact film was formed until the annealing temperature reached 500 °C, as shown in Fig. 4a. On the other hand, the grain size increased with increasing Cu/In ratios. However, large rounded grains were formed when the Cu/In ratio was higher than 0.9 (Fig. 4b), even some pores could be found in CISSe films with a Cu/In ratio of 1.0 (Fig. 4c). These rounded grains should be caused due to the low melting point (525 °C)32 of the residual copper selenide in films which acted as a flux agent in the annealing process.33 The cross-sectional FESEM image of the CISSe thin film with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8 annealed at 500 °C is shown in Fig. 4d. The thickness of the CISSe thin film was about 1 μm and relatively large grains were obtained. Quite large grains were observed from cross-sectional images of CISSe films with Cu/In ratios of 0.9 and 1.0, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Based on the elemental profile of the CISSe thin film shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), no gradient distribution of all elements in the depth profile was observed. The carbon content was very low (Fig. S5, ESI†) in CISSe thin films,16,34 which was a benefit of the easy evaporation of all the small molecule solvents. Grain growth was not hampered by such low carbon content therefore a large grain size layer was formed without formation of the residual carbon layer.

3.5. Prototype device
CISSe thin films with diverse Cu/In ratios annealed at 500 °C were chosen to fabricate thin film solar cells. Solar cells were fabricated with the structure of glass/Mo/CISSe/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Ag. The device properties measured under AM 1.5 with different Cu/In ratios are summarized in Table 2, and Fig. 5a shows the typical I–V characteristics of the best device with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8. The I–V characteristics of devices with Cu/In ratios of 0.9 and 1.0 are provided in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The conspicuous decrease of shunt resistances (Rsh) with increasing Cu/In ratios was attributable to the serious shunt paths and short circuit caused by the conductive copper selenide phase in the absorber layer.33 As a result, the open circuit voltage (Voc),35 as well as the fill factor (FF), decreased significantly leading to the low performance of the devices. On the other hand, the Voc of the best device (443 mV) was much lower than that reported by Liu et al.,23 which may be caused by recombination through the interface, the space charge region or the bulk of the absorber layer.36 The relatively small band gap (low S content: 17.8%) may have resulted in lower Voc as well. Composition optimization and Ga incorporation could further improve Voc. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data of the best device (Fig. 5b) showed that the efficiency stayed at around 60% at short to medium wavelengths (510–950 nm) and exceeded 70% in the range of 520–660 nm. A high efficiency loss was found below 500 nm due to the absorption of ZnO and the CdS layer. The steepness of the long-wavelength part of the EQE curve was by virtue of incomplete absorption in the CISSe layer near the CISSe band gap. The thickness of the CISSe layer was only about 1 μm, which was half of the commonly assumed optimal thickness of 2 μm.9 Optimizing the film thickness is an effective way to further improve the device efficiency.

4. Conclusion
A novel and facile thioacetic acid-based solution method was successfully applied to fabricate CISSe thin films through the spin-coating process. No heating, vacuum conditions and centrifugation were needed for the preparation of the solution precursor. It was easy to handle the process with the low cost, stable solution because all the thin films deposition process could be operated in air. Thioacetic acid played an important role in dissolving Cu2O and In(OH)3, thanks to the strong coordination ability of S in –SH. The Cu/In ratio in the CISSe thin films could be effectively adjusted by changing the component of metal sources in the precursor solution. All the small molecule organic solvents could be easily evaporated resulting in a low carbon content in CISSe thin films. Copper selenide was formed at an early stage of the annealing process and could not be eliminated when the Cu/In ratio was higher than 0.8. A conversion efficiency of 6.75% was achieved in CISSe thin film solar cells with a Cu/In ratio of 0.8, while the presence of copper selenide in films resulted in the bad device performance at a Cu/In ratio above 0.9. The device efficiency could be potentially improved by composition optimization, Ga incorporation etc. The optimization of process conditions and relevant work are ongoing.
