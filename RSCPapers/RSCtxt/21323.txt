, Accepted 3rd September 2019First published on 3rd September 2019AbstractLead-free novel n-type ternary nanohybrids were fabricated by blending separately synthesized, diamond like I–III–VI2 and I–V–VI2 (I-Cu, Ag, III-In, V-Sb, VI-Se) nanocrystals (NCs) in a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and polyaniline (PANI) matrix. A thermoelectric study of these nanohybrids was performed at room temperature in order to understand their utility as potential thermoelectric materials for advanced applications. Electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured and the thermoelectric performance was evaluated at room temperature. All ternary nanohybrids revealed an n-type behavior with relatively higher electrical conductivity in the order of 103 S m−1. Among the CuInSe2 (CIS), AgInSe2 (AIS) and CuSbSe2 (CSS)-based hybrids, chalcostilbite (i.e., CSS/MWCNT/PANI) showed a good performance at room temperature with a power factor of 1.16 μW m−1 K−2 and Seebeck coefficient of −23.5 μV K−1. A possible mechanism of the charge transport for the ternary hybrid was also discussed. The present article highlights the potentiality of different lead-free ternary metal selenide NPs in hybrid forms for thermoelectric applications.
Introduction
Increasing energy crisis in the current technological era has to be resolved by adopting environmentally benign, sustainable energy sources as alternatives of fossil fuels.1 The research on converting waste solar and thermal energies to electricity has gained tremendous attention in the recent past. The efficient conversion of energy by converting renewable sources such as wind, water flow, sunlight and waste heat to electricity requires research efforts by establishing new conversion technologies via the use of tailored nanostructured materials in pure or hybrid forms.2 The recent development in the direction of the enhancement of conversion efficiency highlights the utility of various semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), nanocrystals, composites, hybridized or coupled semiconductors, etc.3–5 The use of such materials has proved their effectiveness in various applications such as solar cells, thermoelectric devices, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and power generators.3–5 However, there is still a wide scope to achieve maximum conversion efficiency, especially in the field of thermoelectrics. Thermoelectrical devices/materials are well-known to convert waste heat to electricity and their performance can be evaluated by considering two factors, viz., figure of merit (zT) and power factor. The figure of merit of any material or device is given by the equation zT = S2σT/K (klattice + kelectronic), where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the temperature in Kelvin (K) and K is the thermal conductivity, which comprises two parts: lattice (klattice) and electronic (kelectronic) thermal conductivities.1,6 Electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity are interdependent and their manipulation is important to obtain a high value of zT. However, it is difficult to manage all three components together in a single material to obtain high zT.7
Various attempts have been documented to enhance the thermoelectric performance of materials. Strategies such as a change in electronic states by resonant impurities, band gap engineering, change in density waves, use of liquid-like thermoelectrics, and semiconductor-semiconductor coupling have been reported in the literature.8–13 However, more efforts are required to cross the current zT value by altering material properties. The TE performances of different binary and ternary metal selenide semiconductors such as SnSe, Cu2−xSe, Ag2Se, In2Se3, Cr2+xSe3, CuInSe2, AgInSe2, and CuSbSe2 have been reported in the literature.14–21 Nevertheless, brittleness and poor processability restrict their employment in wearable or printable thermoelectric devices.22 Nowadays, in order to achieve a good performance with easy processability, a strategy based on the combination or hybridization of inorganic materials with organic polymers is being practiced. A recent development in this direction has revealed improvement in the thermoelectric performance. The formation of hybrids comprising conducting polymers such as poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), polypyrole (PPy), polythiophene, and polyaniline (PANI)23–26 and semiconductors as sensitizers can not only help to improve the performance but also make the final hybrid easily processable at the bulk level. Such hybrids can be easily dispersed in a variety of solvents for probable use in flexible thermoelectric devices, which can work well even at room temperature.25b Processability, flexibility and scalability are the advantages of such hybrids, which have given new dimensions to the thermoelectric research in the recent past. Moreover, the use of highly conducting substrates such as graphene, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with sensitizers and conducting polymers helps to enhance the electrical conductivity.27,28 In fact, there are several reports describing the fabrication of semiconductor-sensitized ternary hybrids for the enhancement in the TE performance. Wang et al.29 demonstrated a power factor of 101 μW m−1 K−2 using the ternary nanocomposite of PANI/SWNT/Te and found it to be higher than that of their binary counterparts. Similarly, another hybrid of MWCNT/PANI/Te has been documented recently and has revealed a power factor of 54.4 μW m−1 K−2.30 Erden et al.31 reported the highest power factor among PANI-based ternary hybrids comprising TiO2/CNT/PANI nanocomposites. They revealed 114 μW m−1 K−2 power factor and enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient by the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles. p-Type RGO/CdS/PANI and PDOT:PSS or PVAc/graphene/titanium dioxide nanocomposites have shown enhancement in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient.32,33 These reports are indicative of the enhancement in the TE performance by the incorporation of semiconductor NPs as sensitizers. Moreover, designing nano/microstructures possessing different types of defects helps scatter the phonons, leading to suppressed thermal conductivity and enhanced zT.33b Also, it is well-known that enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient can be achieved by an energy filtering effect mainly by charge carrier scattering at the interfaces.33c Nanometallic inclusions, especially doping with transition metals, have also shown enhancement in the TE performance.33d Nevertheless, there are very few reports on the evaluation of ternary hybrids towards the TE performance. Therefore, it is essential to explore different semiconductor NPs as sensitizers via hybridization with conducting polymers and 1D nanotubes, i.e., CNTs. Ternary metal selenide NPs such as CuInSe2, AgInSe2, CuSbSe2, and Cu3SbSe3 are diamond-like compounds and possess relatively low thermal conductivity and moderate electronic transport properties. Such compounds have been explored previously by different research groups in their pure or unhybridized forms as thermoelectric materials. However, problems like processability have restricted their utility in the commercially viable technology. Moreover, till date, only two n-type diamond-like compounds (AgInSe2 and CuZnFeS2) have been reported and found to possess a poor TE performance.19,34 This gives a new dimension to trigger the search for TE materials possessing diamond-like compounds with an n-type behavior. Owing to the good electronic conductance of CNTs and the ability to construct processable materials using PANI, it was worth to develop the hybrids of ternary metal selenide NPs with MWCNTs and PANI for flexible TE devices.
Therefore, the present study focused on the fabrication of easily processable, lead-free ternary hybrids comprising ternary metal selenide NPs, such as CuInSe2, AgInSe2 and CuSbSe2 NPs, PANI and MWCNTs. The as-prepared ternary hybrids were investigated for their TE performance at room temperature (300 K) for the first time. The ternary hybrids were converted to thick pellets for the TE performance measurement. The Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivities were experimentally measured and the power factor values were estimated to understand their performance at room temperature. The variation in the performance upon change in ternary metal selenide NPs was studied in depth and a possible charge transfer mechanism in the ternary hybrid was proposed.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Oleic acid, silver nitrate (AgNO3), ethanol and methanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Pvt. Ltd India. Indium (III) chloride (InCl3) and Antimony (III) chloride (SbCl3) were procured from TCI chemicals Pvt. Ltd India. Copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O) was purchased from Merck Pvt. Ltd India, while aniline was purchased from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd India. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs Type 5, OD 30–50 μm, length 10–30 μm) were procured from SRL Pvt. Ltd India. All chemicals were of reagent or analytical grade and were used without further purification. Cyclohexeno-1,2,3-selenadiazole (SDZ) was synthesized by a reported method.35 X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out on a Mini Flex Rigaku X-ray diffractometer Cu_Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å). For FESEM and EDS analysis, a Carl Zeiss Scanning electron microscope was used. Raman and Infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using an EZ Raman spectrometer (USA, λEm is 780 nm) and FTIR PerkinElmer spectrum two (USA) in the range from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 at room temperature.
Synthesis of ternary metal selenide NPs
The synthesis of ternary metal selenide NPs was carried out as reported in our previous papers.36 For the synthesis of CuInSe2 and AgInSe2 NPs, copper chloride dihydrate (0.0058 moles)/silver nitrate (0.0058 moles) and indium (III) chloride (0.011 moles) were added in oleic acid (8.0 mL) and the mixture was heated to 90 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 30–35 min to obtain a dark dense liquid. In contrast, for the synthesis of CuSbSe2, SbCl3 (0.0058 moles) was added instead of InCl3. Separately dissolved SDZ (0.0058 moles) in oleic acid (4–5 mL) at room temperature was then swiftly injected into the above reaction mixture. Instant blackening of the reaction mixture was observed, which confirmed the beginning of nanoparticle formation. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h by increasing the temperature to 220 °C. Subsequently, the mixture was allowed to attain room temperature; n-hexane (10 mL) and ethanol (25 mL) were added in the same reaction flask to quench the reaction and precipitate the product, respectively. The reaction mixture was left overnight for aging. The black colored precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 5500 rpm and finally dried in an oven at 50 °C for 3–4 h.
Preparation of ternary hybrid for thermoelectric study
Ternary metal selenide (TMSe) NPs were employed as sensitizers along with commercially procured MWCNTs and freshly synthesized PANI for the preparation of a ternary hybrid. Semiconductor TMSe NPs (1.0 g) were mixed with MWCNTs (0.25 g) and PANI (0.25 g) by using a mortar and pestle to form a homogeneous hybrid. The hybrids obtained were then collected and used for the pellet preparation. Since three different TMSe NPs, namely, CuInSe2, AgInSe2 and CuSbSe2 NPs were employed, the hybrids formed after grinding were named as CISCP, AISCP and CSSCP, respectively. The pellets of 12 mm diameter were prepared by using hydraulic KBr press (pressure: 9 Tons) and used further for thermoelectric measurements.
Thermoelectric measurements
(a) Measurement of Seebeck coefficient. Films of dimensions 8 mm × 3 mm × 1 mm37 were sliced from thick pellets of the ternary hybrid and placed on a thermal insulating fibre glass to measure thermopower as a function of temperature. The films were connected by Peltier cooler and heater on opposite ends. Peltier cooling module possesses thermally conductive and electrically insulating epoxy (2763 Stycast). A piece of copper was used for contact between Peltier cooler and heater. The thermocouples arranged in series by two copper wires were used to measure voltage drops and temperature gradient along the film. Cu films with thermally/electrically conducting silver epoxy (DuPont 4929N) were attached to the sample to ensure the measurement of thermal gradient and the voltage drop at the same place. Voltage wires and thermocouple were attached to these Cu films and connection was completed. The Peltier cooling module was used for the alteration of temperature. The Keithley 2182A nano-voltmeter was used to monitor the thermoelectric voltages with respect to temperature.
(b) Electrical conductivity measurements. The pellets of ternary hybrids having dimensions of 8 mm × 3 mm × 1 mm were prepared to measure electrical conductivity. The smallest possible current was applied to avoid heating of samples at a low temperature. The delta mode four probe method was followed to measure electrical resistivity of the samples using a Keithley 6220 nanovoltmeter. Due to high electrical conductivity, a 100 mA current source was applied and voltage was recorded with the Keithley nano-voltmeter.
Results and discussion
The blending of pre-synthesized TMSe NPs along with MWCNTs and PANI resulted in the formation of homogeneous hybrid composites. As per previous literature reports, the combination of PANI and MWCNTs is known to exhibit π–π interactions and they remain stacked one over the other, forming a percolated network for electron transport. This percolated network helps to enhance the electronic mobility, leading to the enhancement in the electrical conductivity.38 Conjugation in the PANI and π-bonds in MWCNTs interacts to form a channel, which is probably the driving force for enhanced mobility and thus electrical conductivity. Furthermore, after the incorporation of semiconductor NPs (TMSe NPs in the present case), they are considered to occupy the positions between MWCNTs and PANI since the higher surface area of such NPs is known to be beneficial for adsorption. Thus, by considering the possible interaction between the π–π bonds and π-bonds and the semiconductor surface, it can be opined that the combination of these three components will possibly lead to the formation of a hybrid comprising TMSe NPs in between PANI and MWCNTs, as depicted in Scheme 1. However, since the size of NPs is higher than that of the pore size of MWCNTs, their insertion inside MWCNTs is ruled out. Therefore, it can be concluded that semiconductor NPs will act as a bridge between PANI and MWCNTs, which will help in energy filtering.

The formation of hybrids was confirmed from XRD analysis, which revealed the presence of all the expected peaks for the respective components of the hybrid. Five major peaks were observed in case of AISCP due to the diffraction from the (202), (040), (320)/(204), (123)/(203) and (322) crystal planes, confirming the presence of orthorhombic AgInSe2 NPs in the hybrid.39 In case of CISCP, three major diffraction peaks were observed due to the (112), (220)/(204), and (116)/(312) crystal planes of zinc blende CuInSe2.39 Similarly, the presence of CuSbSe2 NPs in hybrids was identified by the presence of major peaks corresponding to the (013), (113), (203), (213), (020), (311) and (216) crystal planes of the orthorhombic phase.36b However, the identification of other two components of the hybrid from the XRD patterns of all the three samples was quite difficult since both PANI and MWCNTs are known to exhibit a major diffraction peak near 2θ = 26°.40 Therefore, it is considered that the broadness at the base of the intense peak in each case is due to the diffraction from PANI and MWCNTs (highlighted in yellow color in Fig. 1). It is therefore understood from the XRD analysis that TMSe NPs are well incorporated in the PANI/MWCNT matrix without a change in the crystal structure/phase.

The morphology of the as-formed ternary nanohybrid was studied by FESEM analysis and elemental analysis was carried out by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) to understand the composition of the hybrid. The FESEM image of CSSCP revealed the formation of a homogeneous hybrid with the deposition of PANI and smaller CuSbSe2 NPs over the surface of MWCNTs. Carbon nanotubes were clearly identifiable, while non-agglomerated smaller deposits of CuSbSe2 NPs and PANI were seen along the tubes. In case of CISCP, deposits of PANI were clearly seen as slight agglomerates, while spherical CuInSe2 NPs were observed over the surface of MWCNTs along their length. Similar observations can be drawn from the FESEM image of AISCP; however, it was observed to be less agglomerated than CISCP.
From the FESEM images, it can be concluded that the π–π interactions between PANI and MWCNTs as well as the interactions between PANI, MWCNTs and surface of TMSe NPs are responsible for the uniform deposition of PANI and TMSe NPs over MWCNTs. The elemental composition of the hybrid was estimated by EDS analysis and the composition was found to be nearly stoichiometric (Fig. 2(d–f)). The carbon percentage was found to be higher in all the samples, suggesting its dominance because of the presence of PANI and MWCNTs. The FTIR analysis of all the three samples showed nearly similar patterns owing to their identical compositions except TMSe NPs. Fig. 3(a) shows the FTIR spectra of CSSCP, CISCP and AISCP. The presence of PANI in the hybrid was confirmed by the stretching vibrations of N–H, CC, and C–H functional groups. The presence of the broad peak near 3448 cm−1 was due to the –N–H vibrational stretching, while the peak at 3100 cm−1 confirmed the –C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretching. The characteristic peaks for PANI are observed at 1618 cm−1 and 1389 cm−1 due to its quinonoid and benzenoid forms, respectively.41 The delocalization of electrons in the quinonoid form of PANI and the π–π interaction between PANI and MWCNTs led to a high-intensity peak at 1618 cm−1 for all samples. The low-intensity peaks observed between 1000 and 1150 cm−1 are indicative of C–O stretching arising due to the presence of oleic acid.

 Fig. 3  (a) FTIR and (b) Raman spectra of CSSCP, CISCP, and AISCP. 
The Raman spectra of all the hybrids revealed different peaks at 1075, 1183, 1231, 1258, 1337, 1548 and 1677 cm−1. The peaks at 1548 cm−1 and 1677 cm−1 were due to the CC quinonoid and benzenoid forms of PANI, which have been identified in Raman spectra similar to that of FTIR. The peak due to C–N+ at 1344 cm−1 further confirmed the presence of a quinonoid ring in PANI.42 However, MWCNTs are known to exhibit peaks at 1340 cm−1 and 1611 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands,43 but these peaks were found to be merged with the quinonoid and benzenoid peaks of PANI. The broadness of peaks could be due to merging of the peaks, as evident from Fig. 3(b).
Overall, the characterization of the as-prepared hybrids suggested their homogeneous formation with the percolated network of MWCNTs containing PANI and TMSe NPs over their surface with π–π interactions. Such hybrids were expected to show good electrical properties and Seebeck coefficient and therefore were tested for their thermoelectric performance.
Thermoelectric performance of ternary nanohybrids
Electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (S), thermal conductivity and power factor (PF) were measured at room temperature (300 K) in order to understand the performance of the as-prepared ternary nanohybrids. The electrical conductivity (Fig. 4a) of all the three samples was found to be in the order of 103, which highlighted their high conducting nature. Among the ternary hybrids, CISCP showed higher electrical conductivity (3826 S m−1), while lower electrical conductivity was exhibited by AISCP (1552 S m−1). Even though AISCP showed lower electrical conductance, the Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 4b) was found to be at a lower negative value (−4.1 μV K−1) than those of CISCP (−6.1 μV K−1) and CSSCP (−23.5 μV K−1). The power factor (Fig. 4c) values estimated from electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient were found to be 1.16, 0.14 and 0.03 μW m−1 K−2 for CSSCP, CISCP and AISCP, respectively. The highest power factor obtained in the case of CSSCP was due to comparatively moderate electrical conductivity and CSS NP-mediated effective energy filtering. As already mentioned, the delocalized π-electrons of PANI and their interaction with MWCNTs and TMSe NP surface can lead to the formation of channels for charge transport, which favors the electrical conductance.38a The thermal conductivity values of CSSCP, CISCP and AISCP were 0.40, 0.40 and 0.37 W m−1 K−1, respectively (Fig. 4d). This suggested that there was not much difference in the thermal conductivities of the nanohybrids and these values nearly matched with our previous results obtained in case of the nanohybrids formed using binary metal selenides as sensitizers.38b As the Seebeck coefficient values of the as-prepared nanohybrids were low, the estimated values of zT were close to zero at room temperature (zT = 0.0008, 0.00010 and 0.00002 for CSSCP, CISCP and AISCP, respectively).

Possible charge transport mechanism
Nanostructured materials are well-known to exhibit more interfaces and grain boundaries as compared to the bulk materials. However, the increased interfaces and grain boundaries adversely affect electrical conductivity due to the scattering of electrons.44 To nullify this effect, the incorporation of conducting fillers such as MWCNTs and PANI possessing strong π–π interactions helps the scattered electrons to flow through the percolated network, leading to the enhancement in electrical conductivity.45Ex situ decorated TMSe NPs over the surface of MWCNTs and PANI can favor phonon scattering, resulting in decreased thermal conductivity, which is the key requirement for a good thermoelectric performance. The transportation of electrons and holes in a ternary hybrid system is considered to be dependent on each component in composite (i.e. TMSe NPs or MWCNT or PANI). Homogeneous composite formation helps re-organize the band positions of each component having unequal band gaps. This situation results in the formation of various interfaces and heterojunctions in such nanocomposites. In the present case, all the samples showed negative values of the Seebeck coefficient, highlighting their n-type behavior. Here, the most influential interface in the samples was assumed to be MWCNT-TMSe-PANI. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PANI were higher in energy than those of the conduction and valence bands of ternary metal selenide NPs (CIS, AIS, and CSS).
This staggered situation is generally termed as a type-II heterojunction system (Fig. 4e). Since MWCNT is a conductor and lies near the Fermi energy level, under the influence of thermal or heat energy, electrons from HOMO may transfer to the LUMO of PANI, resulting in the generation of charge carriers. Since the conduction band (CB) of TMSe is assumed to be at lower energy than LUMO of PANI, electrons can be easily transferred, leading to increased electron density at CB of TMSe. At the same instance, holes from VB of TMSe are transferred to HOMO of PANI. Thus, the increased electron density favors the transfer of electrons from CB of TMSe to the MWCNT surface. This influx of electrons over the MWCNT surface was assumed to be responsible for the n-type behavior and electrical conduction in such nanocomposites. Overall, the ternary hybrids presented here showed high electrical conductivity and n-type semiconducting behavior irrespective of ternary metal selenide NPs.
Conclusion
Ternary metal selenide NP-based novel ternary nanohybrids of MWCNTs and PANI were synthesized and evaluated towards their thermoelectric performance at room temperature. The characterization of the ternary nanohybrids by FESEM suggested the decoration of TMSe NPs between MWCNTs and PANI, while π–π interaction between MWCNTs and PANI was confirmed from the FTIR study. The ternary nanohybrids exhibited electrical conductivity in the order of 103 S m−1, which could be due to the formation of channels driven by π–π stacking for charge transport. The room-temperature thermoelectric performance suggested an n-type behavior of all the nanohybrids with low thermal conductivity and higher power factor of 1.16 μWm−1K−2 in the case of CuSbSe2/MWCNT/PANI, while a lower power factor was obtained in the case of AgInSe2/MWCNT/PANI. This study highlights the importance of ternary nanohybrids in room-temperature thermoelectric applications.
