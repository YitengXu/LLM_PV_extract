    , Accepted 4th October 2013First published on 8th October 2013AbstractThe performance of Ru(II) dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells (DSSCs) is described with newly synthesized multivalent macromolecules, containing excellent optoelectronic acridinedione linked with 1,2,3-triazole units, via a novel and convenient Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne and azide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. These unique macromolecules have proved to be highly suitable for utilizing additives in I−/I3− redox couple electrolytes. Among the various substitutions, the maximum photo-current conversion efficiency of about 6.4% with a Voc of 810 mV was obtained with electron rich substitutions in the nitrogen heteroatom.
Introduction
The largest challenge for our global society is to find ways to replace the slowly but inevitably vanishing fossil fuel supplies by renewable resources and simultaneously avoid negative effects from the current energy system on climate, environment and health. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to the rapidly increasing energy demand worldwide and also their attractive, and environmentally friendly nature, offering high conversion performance. However, capturing solar energy and converting it into electricity or chemical fuels such as hydrogen at low cost and using abundantly available raw materials remain a huge challenge.
Chemistry is expected to make essential contributions to identify environmentally friendly solutions to this energy problem. An area of great promise in this regard is that of solar converters, generally referred to as “organic photovoltaic cells” (OPVs), that employ organic constituents for light harvesting or charge carrier transport. DSSCs have been well developed by Grätzel and Regan and they reported high power conversion efficiency.1a,b A typical DSSC is composed of a photosensitizing dye adsorbed on a mesoporous film of nanocrystalline TiO2 as a photoelectrode, an electrolyte containing triiodide/iodide redox couple, and a platinized counter electrode. The triiodide/iodide redox couple dissolved in an organic solvent is an excellent mediator for the electron regeneration process in DSSCs.
The DSSC using this type of organic liquid electrolyte achieved a quite high power conversion efficiency,2 although there is an inherent drawback of the cell due to the volatility and possible leakage problem of liquid electrolytes during the long-term out-door operation. In order to improve the performance of the DSSCs, extensive research has been carried out using various non-metallic organic dyes,3a,b semiconductor nano-crystalline TiO2 electrodes,4a–c supporting electrolytes5a–c and counter electrodes.6a,b Considering the mechanism of light to electricity conversion, it has been demonstrated that the physical characteristics of solvents in the electrolyte including the donor number, dielectric constants, viscosity, electron diffusion coefficient, etc. become vital. In particular, the injection of electron from the photo-excited state of the sensitized dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is an essential part in the photoelectric performance of DSSCs. By focusing on the investigation of the influence of electron diffusion coefficient in the multilayer absorption on the TiO2 surface, it can be enhanced to stabilize the conductivity of I−/I3− electrolytes.7 This can be achieved by the optimization of I−/I3− concentration by adding a small amount of electric additives. Grätzel et al.1a,b reported the study on such an I−/I3− electrolyte with TBP as an additive8a and also the additives are still showing their novel performance in modern organic photovoltaic devices.8b They found that TBP adsorbs onto the dye-free nanoparticle surface upon addition, and drastically increases the Voc, the fill factor and the solar energy conversion efficiency without altering Jsc, thus playing important roles in determining the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
In this context, organic molecules play a significant role in photovoltaic and light harvesting systems due to their excellent optical and electrical properties.9–11 In particular, N-containing organic molecules are commonly used as additives in electrolytic solutions to improve the performance of DSSCs.12 N-containing heterocycles other than TBP, such as pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazine, have been recently used as additives in DSSCs.13a,b One of the novel N-heterocyclic organic molecules, acridinedione and its derivatives, finds remarkable application in optoelectronic aspects,14a–d with high stability under thermal and light.14b Though there are few reports only in material studies, it is easier to find considerable biological applications because of their resemblance to 1,4-dihydropyridines which are analogs of many of the biologically important co-enzymes, NADH and NADPH.15a,b
To the best of our knowledge, the acridinedione derivatives have never been used for DSSC applications. On these lines, highlighting our ongoing research aimed at the synthesis and potential applications of cycloaddition chemistry,16a–e we are gaining interest for the application of click chemistry methodology that offers the following advantages, namely, novelty based on 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry, high yields, selectivity and versatility.17 In broader terms, despite the availability of numerous click-chemistry based macromolecular studies on 1,2,3-triazole linked Ru(II) complexes, ligands,18a,b porphyrins and fullerene triazoles,19a,b and 1,2,3-triazole dendrimers,20a,b currently there is no report available in the literature for the synthesis of macromolecules having acridinediones with 1,2,3-triazole moieties. To bridge this gap, in the present study, we successfully report for the first time the synthesis and utilities of acridinedione linked 1,2,3-triazole macromolecules for DSSCs.
An interesting future perspective along the aforementioned concept is to extend it for the use of aliphatic and aromatic moieties as core units, thus helping in efficient synthesis protocols. In the current study, mesitylene and pentaerythritol derivatives are used as core units, which allow the attachment of three and four groups that can be either identical or different. Hence, we chose mesitylene and pentaerythritol as core units for the synthesis of acridinedione-based macromolecules using a recently described copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction,17 giving high yields and complete regioselectivity.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
In this context, we have focused on the synthesis of acridinedione derivatives, which have a wide range of fluorescence, biological and pharmaceutical activities. Acridinedione derivatives were synthesized by the procedures reported in the literature.21 4-Hydroxyphenyltetraketone (3) prepared from dimedone underwent cyclization with various amines to yield acridinediones (4a–g). The acridinedione when treated with propargyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 at room temperature yielded O-propargylacridinediones (5a–g), which was utilized as dipolarophiles for the first time (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1 
The 1,3-dipoles, triazide (8) and tetra-azide (12), were synthesized by the reaction of sodium azide with 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (7) and pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (11), respectively. 1,3,5-Tris(bromomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethyl-benzene22 (7) was prepared by the reaction of mesitylene (6) with excess of paraformaldehyde in the presence of HBr in acetic acid. The tribromide (7) on reaction with excess azide in DMF yielded 1,3,5-tris(azidomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene triazide (8) (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2 
The 1,3-diazido-2,2-bis(azidomethyl)propane (12) was prepared by reacting the tetrabromide of pentaerythritol with sodium azide in DMF at 80 °C based on the literature procedure23 (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3 
The first series of click reactions have been performed with mesitylene derivatives functionalized with azide groups. The 1,3,5-tris(azidomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene triazide (8) on reaction with O-propargylacridinediones (5a–g) in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate in THF–H2O (1:1) was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The cycloadducts were obtained in moderate yield (48%) under the above conditions due to low solubility of the starting materials at room temperature and it also required a longer reaction time. To improve the yield of the product, the above reaction was carried out with a catalytic amount of DMF at room temperature. It increases the solubility of the starting material and the time taken for completion of the reaction was also reduced to 12 h, affording the macromolecular cycloadducts in excellent yield (Scheme 4). Furthermore, when the reaction was carried out under reflux conditions and the reaction time was reduced to 6 h, we did not observe much difference in the yield of the product. In order to avoid the wastage of thermal energy, the 1,2,3-triazole fused macromolecules were synthesized at room temperature only. The structures and molecular weight (MALDI-TOF analysis) of all the macromolecules were confirmed by their spectral analysis.†
 Scheme 4 
Having developed an efficient synthetic route for the synthesis of mesitylene core macromolecular cycloadducts, a second series of click reactions have been carried out from pentaerythritol derivatives functionalized with azide groups to increase the number of acridinedione and 1,2,3-triazole units. Various substituted O-propargylacridinediones (5a–g) (4.4 equiv.) and 1,3-diazido-2,2-bis(azidomethyl)propane (12) (1 equiv.) were stirred at room temperature in THF–H2O (1:1) in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate with a catalytic amount of DMF, yielding 1,2,3-triazole linked macromolecular cycloadducts (14a–g) in good yield (Scheme 5). The structures and molecular weight (MALDI-TOF analysis) of all the macromolecules were confirmed by their spectral analysis.†
 Scheme 5 
Absorption and fluorescence spectra of macromolecular cycloadducts 13a–g and 14a–g
The absorption spectrum of 13a–g and 14a–g macromolecules exhibits a λmax around 370–374 nm in DMF. This longest wavelength π–π* absorption band corresponds to a HOMO to LUMO transition and exhibits a intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character i.e., the heterocyclic nitrogen in the HOMO and the carbonyls in the LUMO are playing the role of an electron donor and an electron acceptor of the acridinedione ring, respectively.24a,b No significant change is noticed in the ICT absorption maximum of macromolecules having three or four acridinedione units; this proves that increasing the acridinedione units does not make difference in the absorbance as well. The absorption spectrum of the macromolecules (13a–g and 14a–g) is shown in Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. The absorption maxima obtained for cycloadducts are given in Table 1.

The emission spectra of macromolecules exhibited a maximum around 440 nm when excited at the range from 361 to 381 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF)25a,b of macromolecules in acetonitrile (0.02 M) was found to be in the range of 0.031 to 0.43. N-alkyl substituted products (13a, 14a) showed 0.35 to 0.43 with reference to quinine sulfate. From the results, it was found that N-alkylated acridinediones showed higher quantum yield than that of the corresponding N-arylated derivatives (ϕF) 0.031 to 0.097. Electron donating substituted N-arylated compounds show relatively higher quantum yield than electron withdrawing substitutions at the para position of the aromatic ring, i.e., the –CH3 group ϕF = 0.062 (13c), ϕF = 0.097 (14c) and –OCH3 group ϕF = 0.072 (13d), ϕF = 0.083 (14d) in acetonitrile, due to more availability of acridinedione nitrogen free electrons. It explains the electron rich substitutions, donating electrons to the aryl group and the π electrons of nitrogen atoms freely involving in intramolecular charge transfer to the carbonyl group. Another important observation is that the pentaerythritol core macromolecules show relatively higher quantum yield than mesitylene core compounds. Thus, it seems that the increasing number of acridinedione units favors higher quantum yield. The emission spectra of macromolecular cycloadducts 13a–g and 14a–g are shown in Fig. 3 and 4 respectively. The quantum yields of cycloadducts are given in Table 2.

Electrochemical studies
The redox behavior of synthetic compounds was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) by dissolving in DMF (0.001 M), using TBAP (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at room temperature. All the macromolecules exhibit an electrochemical response, and the cyclic voltammogram is shown in Fig. 5 and 6, with the redox potentials listed in Table 3. All the dyes chosen in the present study undergo irreversible reduction. Macromolecules containing three (13a–g) and four (14a–g) units of various substituted acridinediones showed two peaks under air-equilibrated conditions. There is a difference in the shape of the cyclic voltammograms obtained under air-equilibrated conditions. The first reduction occurs almost at the same potential in the range of −0.78 to −0.87 V with the same current for all the dyes whereas the second reduction, from −2.03 to −2.22 V, is found to be influenced by the electron releasing/withdrawing substituents which can be observed from the difference in current values for the second reduction in Fig. 5 and 6. The reduction is found to be diminished (with lesser reduction current of 50 μA and 80 μA) in the presence of electron releasing substituents on the heterocyclic nitrogen 13b, 13c and 14b, 14c, whereas an enhanced reduction with 155 μA and 175 μA was found to occur in the presence of electron withdrawing and aliphatic substituents.

Dye-sensitized solar cell studies
According to Grätzel's hypothesis,26 light to electricity conversion is a kind of complex mechanism in the DSCCs. As one of the basic components, the electrolyte plays an important role in improving the solar cell performance, in the process of light to electricity conversion in DSSCs. The electrolyte must have long term stability, including chemical, thermal, optical, electrochemical and interfacial stability, which does not cause desorption and degradation of the dye from the oxide surface and helps to maintain the high enough I3− diffusion coefficient, which are the key prerequisites for high DSSC performance. The electron donor–acceptor reaction in organic solvents and redox couple triiodide27 can be explained by considering the following reaction equilibrium in the electrolyte solution, eqn (1). Solvents + I3− → Solvents–I3− ↔ Solvents–I2 + I−(1)
The higher donor number of molecules present in solvents leads to the inclination of reaction equilibrium to the right,28α–c which results in a decrease in the sublimation of iodine and also an increase in Voc according to . (2)
In general, the amine derivatives, used as additives, drastically increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the electron donating properties of the nitrogen lone pair.12,13a,b In the present investigation, the synthesized 1,2,3-triazole linked acridinedione derived macromolecules as additives in I−/I3− electrolyte solution influences ruthenium dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance, and the Voc values are considerably altered. Typically, cells with macromolecules display higher Voc values and the chemical reaction of charge-transfer complexation in the electrolyte solution is given in eqn (3). Macromolecule + I3− → Macromolecule–I2 + I−(3)
Macromolecules bearing triazole and acridinedione effectively form charge transfer complexes with iodine in the redox complexation reaction which results in a decrease in the sublimation of iodine and also reflects the high performance of DSSCs. The DSSCs, with the synthesized molecules as additives, remain highly stable even until a period of 48 hours with an efficiency deviation of only ±0.01%. The photovoltaic performances of the macromolecules (13a–g, 14a–g) at 40 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. (The J–V curves for the compounds 13a–g and 14a–g measured at 100 mW cm−2 for comparison are available in the ESI†.)

Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage response of mesitylene core macromolecules (13a–g). It explains that the electron donating substituted N-arylated molecules show relatively higher photoelectrochemical conversion than the electron withdrawing substitutions at the para position of the aromatic ring, that is, p-OCH3 (13d) gives a Voc of 720 mV and an η value of 3.30% in DSSCs which is comparatively a higher conversion than the electron withdrawing substitutions 13e (η = 1.37), 13f (η = 1.40), and 13g (η = 1.50). In Fig. 8, among the pentaerythritol core macromolecules (14a–g), the maximum photoelectrochemical conversion of compound 14d, the electron donating substitution, shows a Voc of 810 mV and an η value of 6.40%, that also act like mesitylene core derivatives but with a relatively higher efficiency of current conversion due to increasing numbers of 1,2,3-triazole linked acridinedione units. Thus, the highest efficiency exhibited by the compound 14d is attributed to the lowest electronegativity substitutions at the para-position. This explains the increased efficiency of the DSSCs with the increase in the number of triazole and acridinedione units in the macromolecular structures, which is usually referred to as the multivalent effect29a,b in macromolecular chemistry. The p-methoxy substituted additives 13d & 14d drastically enhance the Voc and the solar energy conversion efficiency (η) and hence the better performance in DSSC studies due to the higher number of electron donating units. The photovoltaic performances of the macromolecules are summarized in Table 4.

Conclusions
We have presented an efficient and systematic route towards the syntheses of a series of luminescent tri- and tetra-acridinedione macromolecules built on mesitylene and pentaerythritol cores by using regioselective Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of alkynes to azides. The synthesized macromolecules were successfully demonstrated as additives of standard, cis-dithiocyanato-N,N-bis(2,2-bipyridyl 4,4-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (N3 dye), DSCCs. The synthesized macromolecule containing electrolyte has an appreciable impact on short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) under identical conditions. A maximum current conversion efficiency (η) of about 6.4% was obtained for electron rich substituted macromolecules and the overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs enhances from 1.37 to 6.40% which is relatively quite high. This improvement in the efficiency is attributed to the lower volatility of the 1,2,3-triazole linked acridinedione macromolecule added electrolytic solution. The higher FF is related to the facile charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The enhancement of Voc afforded by the decreased back electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the I3− ions in the electrolyte is supported by strong π–π* intramolecular charge transfer of N-aryl electron rich substitutions. The results motivate us to achieve highly efficient DSSCs by further tuning the molecular structure by increasing the number of acridinedione and triazole units.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Chemicals and solvents (AR quality) were used as received without any further purification. All melting points are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER TENSOR-27 series FT IR instrument. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER 300 MHz instrument in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as a solvent. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Matric-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-light (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager De-Pro mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer CHNS 2400B instrument. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (ACME, 100–200 mesh). Routine monitoring of the reaction was made using thin layer chromatography developed on glass plates coated with silica gel-G (ACME) of 25 mm thickness and visualized with iodine. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 260 spectrophotometer.

Absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluoromax 4P spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quantum yield was determined by exciting the sample at 366 nm with the use of quinine sulfate as the standard (ϕF) 0.546 in 0.1 N H2SO4.
Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a conventional three electrode system on a CHI model 1100A series electrochemical analyzer (CH Instrument, USA). A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as the working electrode with Pt foil (large surface area) and a silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Prior to each electrochemical experiment, this GCE was mechanically polished with 0.05 micron alumina powder and cleaned in an acetone:ethanol (1:1) mixture in an ultrasonic bath to remove impurities, rinsed with water and then dried in air. Then the electrode was cleaned by cycling between the potentials of 0.0 to −2.7 V versus AgCl in 0.1 M of tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in DMF at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for approximately 30 min until reproducible scans were recorded. All the electrochemical experiments were performed in a quiescent solution at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C).
General procedure for preparation of dye-sensitized solar cell and studies
The dye-sensitized solar cells consist of nanostructured TiO2 film photoelectrodes covered with a photosensitizing dye such as cis-dithiocyanato-N,N-bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (N3 dye), a redox electrolyte solution (I−/I3−) and a Pt counter electrode on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) coated conducting glass. The TiO2 photoelectrode was prepared as described earlier.26 The TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a 5 × 10−5 M solution of the sensitized dye cis-dithiocynato-N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (N3 dye) in absolute ethanol for one day. The photoelectrode was washed, dried and immediately used for the measurement of solar cell performance. A sandwich type photoelectrochemical cell was composed of a dye-coated TiO2 photoanode. The counter electrode was a platinum coated flourinated tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass. The electrolyte solution was injected into the space between two electrodes. The electrolyte solution composed of KI is 2.2 × 10−5 M; I2 is 3 × 10−6 M, and acridinedione macromolecules (13a–g and 14a–g) 8.5 × 10−6 M additives in 10 ml DMF solvent. The photoelectrochemical properties were measured under simulated solar light at 40 mW cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2. The photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V curve) was measured using a BAS 100A Electrochemical analyser. The apparent cell area of the TiO2 photoelectrode was 1 cm2 (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm).
