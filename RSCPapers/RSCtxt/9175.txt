    , Accepted 21st December 2016First published on 21st December 2016AbstractSince the birth of solar cells, photovoltaic devices have experienced persistent breakthroughs in either crucial materials or technologies. However, the ability for power generation is only limited under sunlight illumination, i.e., all state-of-the-art solar cells can realize high-efficiency electricity outputs on sunny days. The power conversion efficiencies are zero at nights because of relatively low visible-light intensity. We present here a simple hydrothermal conversion from strawberry powders to carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for all-weather solar cell applications. Using green-emitting long persistence phosphors (LPPs) as light placeholders, the unabsorbed light ranging from visible to infrared light across CQD sensitized mesoscopic titanium dioxide (m-TiO2) can be converted into green fluorescence, allowing for persistent CQD irradiation and therefore electricity generation at nights.
1 Introduction
By illuminating light absorbers, solar cell devices can convert solar energy into electricity through complicated photochemical reactions.1–3 Until now, many types of thin-film photovoltaic devices, featuring light weight,4 colorful vision,5 flexibility,6 fibrous7 or tubular shapes,8 have been successfully invented as complements for commercial planar silicon solar cells. A thing in common for these solar cells is the absorption of photons under sunlight irradiation, meaning that state-of-the-art solar cells can output electricity at high efficiency on sunny days. The meteorological data of China suggest that the total illumination time is around 3000 hours per year, yielding low or zero efficiencies at 65.8% of the total time in dark–light conditions including night, foggy and rainy environments, etc. Therefore, a challenging problem for state-of-the-art solar cells is to realize persistent electricity generation in all weathers.
Previous work in this field has been focused on developing rain and sun triggered solar cells by combining graphene,9,10 graphene tailored conductive coating11 or platinum alloys12 with a traditional solar cell device, yielding a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 10.38% under simulated sunlight illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) as well as a current of several microamperes and voltage of around one hundred microvolts under simulated rain. The corresponding work constructively opens an era of exploring power generation beyond sunny days, which is also honored as next-generation solar cells.13 There are two limitations for such solar cell architectures in practical applications: (i) the graphene, graphene tailored conducting painting, or platinum alloy is always built onto the backward surface of a traditional solar cell without sacrificing photoelectric conversion efficiency on sunny days. In this fashion, the solar panel should be turned so that the rain-sensitive film faces upward on rainy days, adding fussy processes in practice; (ii) the resultant sun and rain triggered solar cells are still unavailable at night and other dark–light conditions. A promising solution to this impasse is to develop all-weather solar cells that can persistently generate electricity without weather limitations.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are graphene materials with lateral size < 20 nm,14,15 high molar extinction coefficient, size-dependent absorption, and multiple exciton generation effects, allowing CQDs to be light absorbers in photovoltaic cells.16,17 Until now, the prestigious bottom-up method for CQD synthesis has involved conversion from polycyclic aromatic molecules18 or other compounds with aromatic structures.19 The synthesis strategy always features complex procedures and low quantum yields. To explore a more facile route for large-scale CQD synthesis, we would like to directly convert strawberry powders into CQDs by a hydrothermal method for all-weather solar cell applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of CQDs
CQDs were prepared according to the following procedures using strawberry powders as raw materials. Under vigorous agitation, 0.5 g of 200-mesh strawberry powders was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water. After 10 min, the reagent solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reaction was maintained at 170 °C for 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 h to obtain CQD aqueous solutions. Subsequently, the CQDs were stored at 5 °C for use. The energy levels of CQDs at a heating time of 9 h were measured by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method using a standard three-electrode system, consisting of a working electrode of platinum foil supported CQDs, a counter electrode of platinum wire, a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl, and a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile. The CV curve was scanned from −1.5 to 1.5 V at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. The LUMO and HOMO levels are calculated according to ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) V and EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) V.
2.2 Preparation of m-TiO2/LPP photoanodes
Colloidal TiO2 films with a thickness of around 10 μm and an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were fabricated by coating TiO2 colloid onto freshly cleaned FTO glass substrates (12 Ω per square) with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 by a doctor-blade method. Subsequently, the FTO glass supported TiO2 films were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The resultant m-TiO2 electrodes were immersed in concentrated CQD aqueous solutions for 20 h to obtain CQD sensitized m-TiO2 photoanodes. Finally, ultrafine green-emitting LPPs (purchased from Shenzhen HuiDuoSheng Luminous Material Co., Ltd.) were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol to obtain a 0.25 g mL−1 solution, which was spin-coated onto a CQD sensitized m-TiO2 film at a rotation speed of 2000 rpm for 20 s to obtain CQD sensitized m-TiO2/LPP photoanodes. The model number for green-emitting LPPs was H-1B in the selling company. As references, CQD sensitized m-TiO2 photoanodes were also prepared according to the same procedures without incorporating LPPs.
2.3 Solar cell assembly
The pyrolyzed platinum electrode on FTO glass was used as a counter electrode. Each solar cell device was built by sandwiching a I−/I3− redox electrolyte between a platinum counter electrode and a CQD sensitized m-TiO2/LPP (or m-TiO2) photoanode and sealed with a Surlyn film (30 μm in thickness). A liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M tetraethylammonium iodide, 0.1 M tetramethylammonium iodide, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, 0.1 M NaI, 0.1 M KI, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.05 M 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in acetonitrile was used.
2.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of all-weather solar cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2 were recorded on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation under irradiation of simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp in ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled to 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask was applied on the surface of the cell device to avoid stray light. The photovoltaic performances have been repeated at least 30 times to eliminate experimental errors. Before measurement of dark J–V curves, the solar cells were illuminated by using a simulated solar light for 1 min. Immediately, the devices were covered to ensure a completely dark condition and the dark J–V curves were recorded on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in air. The fluorescent light intensities of FTO glass supported m-TiO2/LPP films were also recorded by a standard silicon solar cell. Therefore, the dark cell efficiency was obtained according to η = (Pmax/intensity)dark.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the synthesis processes of CQDs from strawberry powders when undergoing a hydrothermal reaction at 170 °C for several hours. A potential reason behind this conversion is that the primary components of strawberry powders are sucrose, glucose and citric acid. During the hydrothermal process, sucrose can divide into glucose and fructose, as shown in Fig. 1b. It has been demonstrated that either glucose or fructose can convert into CQDs through dehydration reactions.20 Moreover, citric acid molecules are also applicable to CQDs decorated with carboxyl groups (Fig. 1c).21 These oxygenic groups including CO, COOH, C–O–C and –OH can form different surface energy levels between π and π* states of CC,22 allowing for changeable photoluminescence performances. Using the same concept, other raw materials such as apple powders, starch, cellulose, etc. can also be utilized to synthesize CQDs.

The as-synthesized CQD solutions are yellowish brown in an atmospheric environment (Fig. 2a); however, the emission color is blue photoluminescence when undergoing excitation with UV illumination (Fig. 2b). There is no obvious change in the emission color at different heating times, but the maximized brightness at a heating time of 9 h suggests an optimized quantum yield. The corresponding CQDs are subjected to TEM characterization, as shown in Fig. 2c, showing good dispersion and a circular shape. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2d suggests an in-plane lattice spacing of 0.226 nm, which is similar to the previous report.23 The counted size distribution obeys a Gaussian mode, as shown in Fig. 2e, and the main size distribution region is 1.5–2.5 nm, suggesting that the hydrothermal method proposed in the current work benefits the mono-dispersed CQDs. Fig. 2f shows the line-profile of the CQDs for 13-interplanar spacing, yielding an average d value of 0.243 nm. This value is very similar to the determined d spacing from the HRTEM image. According to the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2g), the absorption peak at 3415 cm−1 corresponds to O–H vibration, while that at 1664 cm−1 indicates the presence of COOH groups. The absorptions at 2940 cm−1 are ascribed to C–H stretching, and the peak at 1582 cm−1 belongs to CC stretching. The C–O–C, C–O and CH2 groups are also determined in CQDs at absorption peaks of 1405, 1081 and 808 cm−1, respectively. The detection of such oxygenic groups is responsible for the strong hydrophilic nature of the corresponding CQDs. A D band, arising from the imperfection or destruction of sp2 hybridization, is determined at 1325 cm−1 and associated with disordered induce-scattering (Fig. 2h). The detection of the D band is generally ascribed to the conjugated structure destruction by oxygenic groups and the small sp2 cluster size. The G band corresponding to the E2g mode of graphite and vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a 2-D hexagonal lattice is located at 1576 cm−1. By comparing ID/IG (0.783) of the CQDs with 0.1 for graphite, one can find that the hydrothermal method reported here is efficient for CQD synthesis. EDS characterization in Fig. 2i–k indicates that the atomic C/O ratio increases from 54.74/40.36 at a heating time of 3 h to 62.06/31.26 at a heating time of 20 h. The reduced oxygen content is beneficial to form a large conjugated structure.

By plotting absorption against wavelength, as shown in Fig. 3a and S1,† two deep ultraviolet absorption bands centered at 225 and 285 nm are found for all CQDs in diluted solutions, corresponding to π → π* of CC, and n → π* transition of CO bonds, respectively.24 The linear relationships between the maximal absorbance and 1/dilution time for two peaks at 225 and 285 nm without deviation of positions indicate that the distribution of CQDs is independent of concentration. Fig. 3b and S2† show the PL spectra of the corresponding CQD solutions by tuning excitation wavelengths (λex). The PL intensity and maximal emission wavelengths (λem) are highly dependent on λex. There are no emission peaks under excitation at λex < 370 nm, while a broad emission peak centered at λem = 488 nm is determined at λex = 390 nm. By increasing λex from 390 to 530 nm, the peak position of λem has a red shift, and a maximized peak intensity occurs at λex = 470 nm. With further increase to λex > 550 nm, no emission peaks are detected. This result suggests that the corresponding CQDs are sensitive to the incident wavelength in the range of 390–530 nm. The dependence of λem on λex has also been previously observed for carbon QDs,25 corresponding to excitation energy traps of oxygenic (–COOH, –OH, C–O–C, etc.) groups. The absence of emission peaks at excitation wavelengths shorter than 370 nm and higher than 550 nm may attribute to the mismatching energy traps during recombination of excitons and defects.14

(c) The UV-vis absorption spectra by plotting log(absorption) as a function of wavelength. (d) The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum of the CQDs measured at an emission of 466 nm. The heating time for CQDs is 9 h. 
By plotting log(absorption intensity) versus wavelength, as shown in Fig. 3c and its inset, there is absorption in the range of 390–530 nm. From the corresponding PLE spectrum, one can find that the emission peak is located at 520 nm when subjected to an excitation at 466 nm. This result is in agreement with PL emission spectra in Fig. 3b. Due to the photo-excitation characteristics of CQDs, they can be applied in all-weather CQD solar cells as light absorbers, aiming at realizing photoelectric conversion beyond sunny days. The schematic structure of an all-weather CQD solar cell is shown in Fig. 4a, comprising of an FTO glass supported CQD-TiO2/long persistence phosphor (LPP) photoanode, a I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and an FTO glass supported Pt counter electrode. Under illumination of the photoanode by simulated full-spectral sunlight, the CQDs absorb and convert incident light with 390 nm < λ < 530 nm into electrons. These photogenerated electrons subsequently jump to the conduction band of TiO2 and transfer to the FTO layer along percolating mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) pathways. Using CQDs at a heating time of 9 h, as shown in Fig. 4c, the corresponding solar cell with no LPPs yields an optimized Jsc of 0.271 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.465 V according to the matching energy level (inset in Fig. 4c). The photovoltaic performances are relatively lower in comparison to state-of-the-art solar cells,26,27 but they are still larger than those in the previous report for CQD solar cells.28 Undoubtedly, the dark efficiency is zero because the J–V curve passes the origin of the coordinate. By incorporating LPPs onto the m-TiO2 film, the maximized photo efficiency of all-weather solar cell is at a similar level to traditional devices (Fig. 4d). However, the dark J–V curve does not pass through the origin (Fig. 4e), yielding a dark efficiency as high as 14.8% (Jsc = 0.061 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.332 V and FF = 44.0%), as summarized in Table 1. This is a representative sample from over 15 devices constructed with the same parameters (Fig. S6†). Notably, the dark photovoltaic performances are highly dependent on the heating time of CQDs. The Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values are 0.037 mA cm−2, 0.226 V, 37.1% and 5.1% for the solar cell with CQDs at a heating time of 3 h, respectively. All of these data are increased by optimizing the heating time to 9 h and subsequently decline at an elongated heating time. The possible mechanism behind this is the increased conjugated degree of CQDs in the heating time range of 3–9 h, while a large size of CQDs leads to reduction in quantum confinement effects beyond 9 h. From the random distributions of photovoltaic parameters for all-weather solar cells, as shown in Fig. S3–S9,† we infer here that the all-weather solar cells with power generation ability at nights and high reproducibility can be realized using the method reported here. Although the real electricity outputs are still incomparable with photo performances, it still represents a significant step forward, as it is the first time that all-weather solar cells that can harvest energy in the dark has been experimentally realized.

The photoelectric conversion mechanism in dark environments is attributable to storage of solar energy toward unabsorbed incident light and subsequent green emission (Fig. 4b). From optical transmittance spectra in Fig. 4f, one can find that the transparency is zero below 375 nm for the FTO glass supported CQD-TiO2 photoanode, suggesting a complete conversion from UV light into electricity. However, the increased transmission at higher wavelengths refers to light loss and the transparency is 58.5% at λ = 700 nm. Interestingly, the optical transmittance is markedly reduced by incorporating the green-emitting LPP into the photoanode, which signals that partially unabsorbed light has been stored by the LPP for green emission. The CQD-TiO2/LPP photoanode is subjected to PL characterization (Fig. 4g), and typical emission peaks at λem = 510 nm are observed with λex ranging from 450 to 900 nm, which are mainly attributed to the PL emission of LPPs (Fig. S10†). The released fluorescence is reabsorbed by m-TiO2 supported CQDs (Fig. S11†). In this fashion, the LPPs can markedly broaden the absorption spectrum to infrared light.
EIS characterizations are performed to investigate charge-transfer processes in the photoanode/region. Fig. 4h shows the Nyquist EIS plots of all-weather solar cells and the corresponding electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table S1.†Rct2 has a valley value (126 ohm cm2) for the solar cell sensitized with CQDs at a 9 h-heating time, indicating a minimized charge-transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The optimized photo-excitation behaviors of the CQDs at a heating time of 9 h allow for maximized electron density at the conduction band of TiO2 nanocrystallites and therefore voltage drop promoting electron migration along percolating m-TiO2 pathways.29 In contrast, the incomplete honeycomb graphene structure and abundant oxygenic groups at a lower heating time as well as weakened quantum effects at longer heating time reduce electron emission under illumination. Moreover, the peak τ [τ = 1/(2πfmax), fmax is the peak frequency in Fig. S12†] value (94 ms) of the optimized solar cell at a CQD heating time of 9 h suggests that the enhanced charge-transfer process restricts the electron recombination with the redox electrolyte.
The long-term stability of all-weather solar cells has equal significance to photoelectric conversion efficiency.30 The photo-to-electric conversion process is determined by the persistent green fluorescence from LPPs, therefore the photoluminescence images of the CQD-TiO2/LPP photoanode are captured after illuminating for 5 min by using simulated sunlight. As shown in Fig. 5a, the bright external rectangle refers to green-emitting LPPs, whereas the dim inner rectangle refers to the CQD-TiO2/LPP film because of light absorption by CQDs. The green fluorescence intensity abruptly reduces from 59.2 to 1.1 μW cm−2 within 5 min (Fig. 5b), and persistent emission can last for one hour at a relatively low intensity of 0.15 μW cm−2. According to the dark J–V characteristics of all-weather solar cells recorded at various decay times, as shown in Fig. S13,† the initial dark Jsc, Voc and FF, arising from fluorescence illumination at nights, have apparent reductions from 0.054 mA cm−2, 0.332 V and 43.8% to 0.0147 mA cm−2, 0.204 V and 42.1% in first 10 min (Fig. 5c–e). With further elongation of the decay time to 2 h, the photovoltaics yield dark Jsc, Voc and FF of 3.28 μA cm−2, 0.117 V and 35.4%, respectively. When subjected to a decay time of 2.5 h, the corresponding parameters are 2.04 μA cm−2 for dark Jsc, 0.101 V for dark Voc, and 26.8% for dark FF. In fact, the utilized LPPs can persistently release fluorescence for 6 h; however, the yielded photovoltaic parameters are relatively low in all-weather solar cells. Therefore, the high-intensity emission of LPPs for a long time is crucial in increasing power outputs in the dark but it is still a great challenge facing the successful commercialization of all-weather solar cells. A possible mechanism behind the deterioration is energy release from LPPs, and thus it is still susceptible to rapid light attenuation. Future optimization of designing high-efficiency all-weather solar cells may focus on either high optical energy capacity LPPs or energy supplement from ambient environment.

(e) Dark FF decay versus time. (f) The global and (g) magnified on–off switches for an optimized solar cell with or without LPPs. 
Apart from high performance, superior all-weather solar cells should feature rapid start-up under sunlight irradiation and repeated on-off behavior upon changing day and night conditions. As shown in Fig. 5f and g, the photocurrents of solar cells with and without LPPs have abrupt increases under sunlight illumination. When ceasing excitation by wide-spectral sunlight, the current reduces to zero for traditional solar cells with no LPPs, while it is around 0.06 mA cm−2 for all-weather solar cells. This result cross-checks the fact that the all-weather solar cell can persistently generate electricity at days and nights. After multiple start-ups, the solar cell properties remain nearly unchanged, which is an essential prerequisite for practical applications of all-weather solar cells in engines or vehicles.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the successful conversion of strawberry powders into CQDs through a hydrothermal method. By using the featured photoelectron excitation behaviors of CQDs and light storing/emissing performances of LPPs, all-weather solar cells that can persistently generate electricity at days and nights are built, yielding a maximized dark efficiency as high as 14.8% and good long-term stability. All-weather solar cells may find many technologically important applications in photovoltaic power stations, photovoltaic curtains and submarine detection. New fundamental questions on how to further increase dark power outputs and stability are put forth for forwarding commercialization.
