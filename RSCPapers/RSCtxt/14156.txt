The prepared nanocomposites were structurally and morphologically characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The structural studies show the formation of rGO–NiCo2O4 nanocomposites by embedment of porous NiCo2O4 rods on rGO sheets. The effect of the NiCo2O4 content on photochemical water oxidation was investigated. It revealed that the catalysts NiCo2O4–rGO with 1:26 ratio (NCO26) and 1:13 ratio (NCO13) are efficient in generating oxygen under light illumination. It proves that NCO26 works far more effectively as a photocatalyst compared to NCO13. Methanol electro-oxidation of the NCO26 nanocomposite shows a current density of 24 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0.45 V in cyclic voltammetry and maintains the current for 3600 s at 0.45 V in chronoamperometry. An onset potential of 0.344 V was observed for 0.5 M methanol oxidation. The specific capacitance values were found to be 354.75 F g−1 and 375.32 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively, for NCO26 in supercapacitor studies. The charge stored via capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes was determined using Power's law and Trasatti plot.

1. Introduction
The depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing demand for energy storage and energy conversion devices have been impelling researchers to focus on novel materials for the improvement of energy storage ability and energy conversion efficiency.1–3 In the recent era, fuel cells (FCs) and supercapacitors (SCs) have been attractive to meet the future needs in the aspect of energy crisis.4–6 FCs are extensively attractive for energy conversion with more efficiency, low-temperature conversion, and their environment friendly nature.7 Hydrogen and oxygen are used as fuels in some FCs. Hydrogen is not directly available for use in FCs. Light-driven water splitting approaches are used to convert solar energy into chemical energy as H2 and O2. These chemicals can be used for FCs. Methanol is also used as a fuel in place of H2 in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Concurrently, SCs are widely attractive energy storage devices owing to their high power density, good rate capabilities, and long-cycling stability.8,9 SC stores energy via electrical double layer formation at the electrode/electrolyte interface and a faradaic redox reaction in the vicinity of the electrodes. The production cost and low energy density are limiting the widespread usability of SCs.10 The electrochemical performances of energy conversion and storage devices mainly depend on the active materials or catalytic electrodes used in their fabrication.
In earlier times, researchers’ first choice was Ru and Pt metals and their oxides for the SC and FC applications because of their excellent catalytic properties and highly reversible nature.11–13 These Ru and Pt-based materials have environmental toxicity and are of high cost which limited their role in energy storage and conversion applications.14,15 Considering these issues, in recent years, researchers have progressed to spinel-type binary or ternary transition metal oxides such as ZnCo2O4, MgFe2O4, CuCo2O4, MnCo2O4, MgCo2O4, CoFe2O4, NiCo2O4, etc. for the SC, methanol oxidation and water splitting applications due to their high electrochemical reversibility, environmental friendliness and low production cost.16–19
For light-induced water oxidation reactions, few groups are working with these spinel-type binary or ternary transition metal oxides.20–23 In this regard, cobalt is found to be the most extensively used metal. In a recently published journal from our group,24 it was proved that zinc and nickel substituted cobalt oxides generate oxygen from water in the presence of light. It was also evidenced that Zn–Ni–Co oxide worked more efficiently for photochemical water oxidation due to the larger surface area and higher number of active sites.
Harsharaj et al. have prepared urchin-like ZnCo2O4 microspheres and used these microspheres for energy storage as supercapacitors and electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. They observed a specific capacitance (Cs) of 1143 F g−1 at a current density of 1.25 A g−1 in 2 M KOH with good cycling stability for 6000 cycles. Furthermore, ZnCo2O4 maintains a current density of 105 A g−1 in a mixed solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol.16 Jinping et al. have fabricated mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanograss for methanol oxidation and supercapacitor applications. A Cs of 796 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 is reported for CuCo2O4 nanograss with 94.7% retention after 5000 cycles. Also, a current density of 27.6 A g−1 in a mixed electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol is reported for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol.17 Liheng et al. have fabricated mesoporous NiCo2O4 which has an urchin-like morphology and studied its electrochemical behavior for supercapacitor and methanol electro-oxidation applications. The urchin-like NiCo2O4 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 655 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with a retention of 95% after 1000 cycles whereas it delivers a current density of 48.5 A g−1 at 0.65 V with excellent cycling stability.18
However, the performance of these materials is not up to the level of Pt and Ru based oxides and still needs to be improved by employing their conductivity, energy density, cycling stability, and catalytic properties. In recent years, carbon-based materials such as CNTs and rGO have received great interest in energy conversion and storage applications due to their high conductivity and high surface area.25 The rGO provides a matrix for efficient incorporation of metal oxides in it and hence increases the catalytic nature of composites.
This article reports the preparation of the NiCo2O4–rGO nanocomposite (1:13 (NCO13) and 1:26 (NCO26) ratio) by the hydrothermal route and utilized these materials as an electrode in a supercapacitor, as an electrocatalyst in methanol oxidation in a highly alkaline environment and as a photocatalyst for water oxidation in the presence of visible light. For the light-induced water oxidation reaction, it was shown that the catalyst NCO26 works more efficiently than NCO13. The methanol electro-oxidation ability of NCO26 composites was evaluated in a mixed electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol. The composite NCO26 shows a current density of 24 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0.45 V in cyclic voltammetry and maintains the current for 3600 s at 0.45 V in chronoamperometry. An asymmetric supercapacitor device shows a specific capacitance of 122.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and exhibits a retention of 74.3% after 5000 cycles. An energy density of 67.89 W h kg−1 and a power density of 1 kW kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 are found. Based upon the current investigations, it is assumed that non-Pt, Ru-based materials such as the NiCo2O4–rGO composite can find a suitable place in the field of energy storage and energy conversion.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of NiCo2O4–rGO nanocomposites
A facile solvothermal approach was adopted for the fabrication of a nanocomposite based on NiCo2O4–rGO (1:13 weight ratio (NCO13)). Initially, 0.910 g of GO was weighed and ultrasonically dispersed in 30 ml of ethylene glycol for 1 hour. 1 mmol nickel sulphate (0.0762 g), 2 mmol cobalt sulphate (0.1634 g), and 3 mmol oxalic acid (0.774 g) were mixed with 10 ml of deionized (DI) water. Then these sulphate solutions were mixed with dispersed GO solution by using a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. The prepared final solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was placed in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling down, the solution was centrifuged and washed with DI water and ethanol. The prepared precursor was overnight dried at 80 °C and annealed at 350 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace under an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Similarly, the NiCo2O4–rGO (1:26 weight ratio (NCO26)) nanocomposite was also prepared.
2.2 Structural characterization
A Mini-Flex II powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) was utilized to determine the structure and phase purity of the prepared nanocomposite. Raman active modes of the nanocomposites were measured using a Renishaw inVia confocal laser Raman spectrometer. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Technai G2T30) along with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were utilized to visualize the morphological and microstructural features of the prepared nanocomposites. The elemental valence states were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA+ Omicron Nano technology). The BET surface area and pore size distributions were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms using a Nova touch LX2 gas sorption analyser from Quantachrome Instruments.
2.3 Water splitting
The oxygen evolution under visible light was observed by a Clark type oxygraph electrode (Hansatech Instruments). The output signals were monitored using the Oxygraph+ software (Hansatech Instruments). The semipermeable membranes and Ag/AgCl anode comprise the Clark electrode system. Photocatalysts (catalyst 1 and catalyst 2), the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)3(Cl)2, and the sacrificial electron acceptor Na2S2O8 were used. A phosphate buffer of pH 7 (10 mM) was used for all the photocatalytic studies. The stock solutions were prepared in the buffer under dark conditions. The whole solution containing all the ingredients (2 mL) was then shifted to the Clark cell. Prior to each measurement, the cell with the solution was de-aerated by nitrogen to minimize the oxygen concentrations as much as possible. After that, it was kept in the darkroom for a few seconds and then the light source (λ = 420 nm) was switched on. The oxygen generation was recorded until saturation was reached for each experimentation.
2.4 Electrode preparations for electrochemical energy storage and energy conversion
By mixing the annealed nanocomposites as the active material (80 wt%), activated charcoal carbon black (10 wt%) (s d fiNE-CHEM Limited) and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt%) (Alfa Aesar) with N-methyl pyrrolidinone (Loba Chemie) as a dispersing solvent, the electrode slurry was prepared. Furthermore, the prepared slurry was dropcast on a Ni foil having an area of 1 cm2. The weight of the active material was found to be ∼2.0 mg. Before drop-casting, the Ni foil was ultrasonically cleaned in 1 M HCl, acetone, and DI water sequentially. All the electrochemical measurements were done with a Biologic SP-240 potentiostat/galvanostat using the EC-lab software. A platinum rod and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 1 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte for supercapacitor studies. KOH was used as the supporting electrolyte for methanol electro-oxidation investigations.
An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device having the NiCo2O4–rGO (NCO26) nanocomposite as a positive electrode, rGO as a negative electrode, and 1 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte was fabricated for the evaluation of electrochemical performance in real-world applications. The performance of the ASC device critically depends on the mass ratio of the positive and negative electrodes. Hence the mass ratio was calculated by the charge balance theory q+ = q−(1)
The amount of charge an electrode material can hold solely depends on its capacitance (Cs), applied potential (ΔV) and mass of the active material (m), which can be calculated from the following relation q = Cs × ΔV × m(2)
From eqn (1) and (2) m+/m− = (ΔV− × C−)/(ΔV+ × C+)(3)
From eqn (3), a mass ratio of 0.43 was obtained for the present ASC device.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural studies

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the NCO26 nanocomposite in comparison with the diffraction patterns of pristine rGO and spinel-type NiCo2O4. The pristine NiCo2O4 was prepared by the hydrothermal method as described in ref. 26. The XRD peaks of NCO26 were observed at 2θ values 18.33°, 25.63°, 30.18°, 35.59°, 37.86°, 43.23°, 53.74°, 57.24° and 62.86°. Except for the peak at 25.63°, all the above diffraction peaks are associated with Bragg reflections of 111, 220, 311, 222, 400, 422, 511, and 440, respectively, in good agreement with the pristine NiCo2O4 and also the standard cubic spinel structure (JCPDS card no: 22-1086). A broad diffraction peak observed at 25.63° is attributed to the (002) plane of reduced graphene oxide. Furthermore, no other reflections were observed, which shows the formation of a highly pure nanocomposite. A similar diffraction pattern was observed for NCO13 as shown in Fig. S1.† The average crystallite size (Dhkl) of the NiCo2O4 nanomaterials dispersed into the rGO was estimated by using the Debye–Scherrer formula, (4)where hkl, βhkl, θ, k, and λ are the miller indices of the analyzing plane, the FWHM of the high intensity reflection plane (311), Bragg's angle, a constant that depends on the shape of the crystallite, and the wavelength of the X-ray source, respectively. The average crystallite sizes of NiCo2O4 were calculated to be 10 and 8 nm for NCO13 and NCO26, respectively.

Raman spectroscopy was employed for the determination of Raman active modes in the prepared NiCo2O4–rGO nanocomposites in the range of 200–2500 cm−1, as depicted in Fig. 2. The vibration modes at 1352 and 1579 cm−1 are associated with the distinct D-band and G-band specific to rGO, respectively, for all samples.27,28 The D band is concomitant to the disordered and structural imperfections that arise due to the breaking of the symmetry by CC bonds.29 The G-band is associated with the stretching motion of the sp2 carbon pairs in graphene 2D layers.30 Furthermore, some other vibration bands were also observed at low and medium wavenumber regions (shown ↓ in Fig. 2) at positions 178, 469 and 690 cm−1 that correspond to the Raman active modes of F2g, Eg, and A1g, respectively.31,32 Thus, Raman spectroscopy along with the XRD patterns further confirm the establishment of rGO–NiCo2O4 nanocomposites.

Additionally, the surface morphologies of the as-prepared NCO13 and NCO26 were examined by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 3. The SEM image (Fig. 3(a)) of NCO13 shows the formation of lots of rods, whereas the SEM image (Fig. 3(b)) of NCO26 shows structures having agglomerated particles. Furthermore, the weight and atomic ratio of Ni and Co have been investigated by using EDS and it shows that the Ni and Co atomic ratio is 0.54 and 0.51, whereas the weight ratio is 0.51 and 0.55, respectively, in NCO13 and NCO26 (Fig. S2†). The TEM images (Fig. 3(c) and (e)) of NCO13 show clearly the rGO flakes in which bundles of porous NiCo2O4 rods (log-like structures) are embedded randomly. The TEM images (Fig. 3(d) and (f)) of NCO26 also reveal the rGO flakes in which NiCo2O4 porous nanorods are embedded. The size of NiCo2O4 porous nanorods embedded on the NCO26 composite is smaller than that on the NCO13 nanocomposite. Furthermore, the crystallinity of NCO13 and NCO26 was examined by SAED. The SAED patterns reflect the formation of diffraction rings with clear bright spots that show that both composites are nanocrystalline in nature (inset of Fig. 3(e) and (f)). Fig. 3(g) and (h) shows the crystal fringes of NiCo2O4 which also suggest the successful formation of nanocrystalline composites. The d spacing values were calculated to be 0.254 and 0.256 nm which correspond to the (311) plane of NiCo2O4. The TEM and SAED results additionally endorse the materialization of the NiCo2O4–rGO nanocomposites.

Furthermore, the oxidation states of Ni, Co and O and their chemical states in NCO26 were investigated by XPS. Fig. 4(a) presents the survey scan of NCO26 and it exhibits the photoelectron peaks corresponding to C, Ni, Co and O only which suggests the excellent purity of the samples. Furthermore, narrow range XP spectra were recorded for C 1s, O 1s, Ni 2p, and Co 2p and are shown in Fig. 4(b–d). Fig. 4(b) suggests the XP spectra of Ni 2p which has two peaks at binding energies of 854.3 and 871.6 eV which correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. Ni exhibits two satellite peaks at binding energies of 881.3 and 861.6 eV. The multiple oxidation states of Ni were investigated by deconvoluting the XP spectra and fitting the peaks using the Sherly background. The sharp peaks observed at binding energies of 854.1, 856.3, and 871.5 eV correspond to the Ni2+ state while the peaks observed at 857.9 and 875.1 eV are related to the Ni3+ state.33 Similarly, the oxidation states of Co were confirmed by the deconvolution approach and it suggests that the Co3+ XPS peaks are observed at binding energies of 779.1 and 795.2 eV while the Co2+ XPS peaks are observed at 781.4 and 797.5 eV (Fig. 4(c)).34 The satellite peaks related to Co were observed at binding energies of 788.1 and 803.2 eV. The XP spectra of O 1s exhibit broad peaks at binding energies of 529.9 and 532.0 eV which were further deconvoluted to investigate the chemical bonding of oxygen with surrounding species as shown in Fig. 4(d). The sharp peak at a binding energy of 529.9 eV suggests the metal oxygen bonding while the XP peaks at binding energies of 531.4, 532.6, and 533.6 eV correspond to the carboxyl group (CO), the carbonyl group (C–O), and the adsorbed hydroxyl moieties (C–O–H).35Fig. 4(e) exhibits a sharp peak associated with the CC bonding in rGO at a binding energy of 284.5 eV. Careful investigations suggest the multiple embedded peaks along with the peak due to CC bonding. These peaks were positioned at binding energies of 285.3, 286.1, 287.0, and 288.2 eV which are associated with C–C, C–O, CO, and O–CO, respectively, of the rGO.29

Moreover, the physical surface area, pore size and pore volume of NCO26 have been estimated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. Fig. 5 reveals the BET surface area of 132 m2 g−1 from the desorption data. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the pore size distributions of NCO26. The pore volume as well as the pore diameter have been estimated as 0.424 cm3 g−1 and 1.7 nm, respectively, from the BJH analysis. The high surface area and porous nature of NCO26 are beneficial for electrochemical energy storage and energy conversion applications.

The estimations of the band gap energies of NCO13 and NCO26 were done by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as shown in Fig. S3(a).† Both spectra show reflectance peaks in the low wavelength range (259 nm for NCO13 and 267 nm for the NCO26) which are assigned to the π–π* transitions and restoration of the sp2 structure. Furthermore, the band gap energies of NCO13 and NCO26 were estimated as 1.44 and 1.52 eV from Fig. S3(b).† The obtained band gap is lower than those reported earlier for NiCo2O4 composites.36,37
3.2 Water splitting studies
The light-driven water oxidation studies were done systematically in the presence of four components: photocatalyst (NCO13 and NCO26), [Ru(bpy)3]2+, Na2S2O8, and light (λ = 420 nm). Among the few established procedures for photocatalytic water oxidation studies, this four-component system is one of the procedures that is extensively used by researchers working in the field.38,39 In this process, oxygen evolution was monitored in the Clark electrode, where [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 works as a photosensitizer and persulfate works as a sacrificial electron acceptor. In the presence of LED light (λ = 420 nm), the ruthenium to bpy charge transfer (3MLCT) occurred, which led to the excited state of [Ru(bpy)3]2+*. The excited species is quenched by persulfate (S2O82−) and produces [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and SO4˙−. Next, the radical species oxidizes a second [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and reduced to SO42−. This photogenerated [Ru(bpy)3]3+ receives electrons from the catalyst and plays the role of an oxidant in the water oxidation reaction.
Both the catalysts (NCO13 or NCO26) were introduced in the oxygen evolution reaction with the above-mentioned experimental setup. First of all, the produced dissolved oxygen was measured with different amounts of both the catalysts. In Fig. 6, it is clearly demonstrated that with an increasing amount of the two catalysts the rate of oxygen evolution was also enhanced. 2 mL of the buffer solution was taken whereas different quantities of the catalysts were used systematically along with the same amounts of the photosensitizer and electron acceptor (Fig. 6(a) and (b)). It is also evident that for the catalyst NCO26 (Fig. 6(b)), the generation of oxygen is much more compared to the other catalyst, NCO13 (Fig. 6(a)). The varied amounts of the two catalysts were used to evaluate the optimum rate of the produced oxygen.
 Fig. 6  Oxygen evolution studies under an LED source with different amounts of catalysts NCO13 and NCO26 under similar conditions; in the presence of persulfate = 10 mM, Ru[(bpy)3]2+ = 1 mM, and phosphate buffer, pH = 7. 

Fig. 6(a) and (b) revealed that the oxygen evolution started after ∼10–12 s of light illumination. Then the oxygen generation enhanced continuously with time and after another 10–15 s of the lag phase, a very intense rate of oxygen evolution was observed under the light. In Fig. 6(a) it was shown that in the presence of 2 mg of the NCO13 catalyst, the amount of generated oxygen went to a maximum amount of ∼175 nmoles per mL whereas in the case of NCO26, under similar conditions the maximum amount reached up to ∼480 nmoles per mL (Fig. 6(b)). Next, for both the catalysts the curve touched the linear phase following saturation. The saturation or the plateau of the curve was reached because of the dissociation of the sacrificial agent S2O82− to SO4˙− and SO42−. This phenomenon is responsible for the breaking of the catalytic cycle. The whole process was observed for almost 20 min at room temperature under light illumination. Hence, from the first experiment, it was evident that the photocatalytic performance of NCO26 is much better than that of NCO13 as the size of the NiCo2O4 nanorods embedded on the rGO of the NCO26 nanocomposite is smaller than that of the NCO13 nanocomposite.
The next experimental setup was almost similar to the aforementioned experiment, where the only change that was made was monitoring the oxygen evolution under continuous light and dark conditions. The effect of switching on/off the light on monitoring the oxygen evolution is shown in Fig. 7 for both the catalysts. It was confirmed that for both the catalytic cycles, oxygen production, that is the water oxidation reaction, takes place only after light illumination. Under exactly similar conditions, a considerable amount of evaluated oxygen was found under light but the system was not able to produce oxygen when the light was switched off (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). From this study, it was confirmed that the light source is one of the primary requirements for both photocatalysts for sufficient oxygen generation.
 Fig. 7  Effect of an LED light source (λ = 420 nm) on water oxidation (continuous light source “on”/“off” experiment). NCO13 = 3 mg (a) and NCO26 = 2 mg (b), persulfate = 10 mM, Ru[(bpy)3]2+ = 1 mM, and phosphate buffer, pH = 7. 
Similarly, different sets of experiments were performed in which one of the components was absent while the other conditions remained the same. For example, the catalyst and sacrificial electron acceptor were present while the sensitizer was absent; both the sensitizer and electron acceptor were present but the catalyst was absent; and the catalyst and sensitizer were present but the electron acceptor was absent. All these experiments were done under light illumination and in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). But in all these individual experiments, the system was unable to produce oxygen. Therefore, it was proved that all the individual components have specific roles and contributions towards the water oxidation reaction.
In the next experiment, the reusability and the recyclability of the two catalysts were checked. This was done by following a similar procedure reported by our group.24,40 After one catalytic cycle, the heterogeneous catalysts were recovered from the reaction solution. The recovered catalysts were centrifuged to separate them from the reaction solution and air-dried. The recovered and dried catalysts were then reused again in the next catalytic cycle under exactly the same experimental setup. This way the catalysts were recovered and reused for five catalytic cycles. This recycling experiment was checked for five cycles, nevertheless, both the catalysts could be reused even for more catalytic cycles. From Fig. 8(a) and (b), it is confirmed that a substantial amount of oxygen was generated in each cycle. However, in this recyclability study, there is always ∼5–10% of experimental error. After one cycle, it was very difficult to restore the whole amount of the catalysts which were used in the previous cycle. Approximately, 2–4 mg of the catalysts were used in the first run and after each run, we lost around 0.1–0.4 mg of catalysts. Sometimes to accumulate more catalysts, the same cycles were repeated. However, due to the loss of the catalysts after each cycle, a reduction in oxygen formation was noticed. To minimize this issue, the concentration of oxygen was taken as nMoles per mL per mg. For all individual calculations, this parameter was taken into consideration to overcome the weight loss problem. In the bar diagram (Fig. 8), it was found that there was almost no or negligible change in the oxygen generation for each catalytic cycle.

Thus, it was confirmed from the above experiments that both the catalysts, NCO13 and NCO26, work as efficient water oxidation catalysts under light illumination. These photocatalysts were stable even after five (or more) catalytic cycles and could be reused for further reactions. These experiments also suggest that NCO26 is a better photocatalyst than NCO13.
3.3 Methanol oxidation studies
The ability of NCO26, NCO13, and pristine rGO towards methanol electro-oxidation was assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) techniques in a three-electrode system. Fig. 9(a) shows the CV comparison of NCO26, NCO13, and pristine rGO towards 0.50 M methanol in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0–0.45 V. NCO26 produces more current in comparison to NCO13 and pristine rGO, which suggests the good catalytic properties of NCO26. The onset potential for NCO26 was found to be 0.344 V which is lower than the onset potentials of NCO13 (0.401 V) and pristine rGO (0.433 V). The higher electrooxidation performance of NCO26 than those of NCO13 and rGO could be due to the synergetic effect of rGO and spinel NiCo2O4 which are interconnected through the matrix provided by the sheets of rGO. Here, NiCo2O4 particles provide the catalytic sites for the oxidation of methanol and the released electrons are quickly transferred to another electrode by the matrix of rGO. In NCO26, rGO is present in higher amounts than in NCO13; so the matrix is widely spread which prevents the accumulation of charge carriers released from the catalytic reaction of methanol oxidation by NiCo2O4 particles and hence speeds up the electron transfer process.

(b) Chronoamperometry measurements of rGO, NCO13 and NCO26 at a potential of 0.45 V for 3600 s. (c) Cyclic voltammograms of NCO26 at various concentrations of methanol in a 1 M KOH electrolyte.

The commercialization of the device for methanol electro-oxidation requires the prolonged stability of the catalyst. Hence, we have adopted the CA technique and evaluated the catalytic performances of NCO26, NCO13 and pristine rGO towards 0.50 M methanol in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a potential of 0.45 V for 3600 s as shown in Fig. 9(b). The CA of NCO26 shows a higher current in comparison to NCO13 and pristine rGO, suggesting good electrocatalytic performance.

Fig. 9(c and d) shows the electrocatalytic activity of NCO26 towards various concentrations of methanol in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. As can be seen from Fig. 9(c), the current density at 0.45 V increases with the concentration of methanol. The inset demonstrates the linear behavior of peak current with increasing methanol concentrations up to 1 M methanol and later increasing the concentration of methanol does not increase the current linearly, suggesting the saturation state of the NCO26 electrode. Fig. 9(d) shows the CA of NCO26 at various methanol concentrations. At low concentrations, the current density shows obvious stability for 3600 s and it decreases at high concentrations of methanol as seen in Fig. 9(d).
Fig. S4(a)† shows the CV at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 of NCO13 towards various concentrations of methanol in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The current density at 0.45 V shows an increase with an increase in the methanol concentration and becomes saturated at 1.25 M methanol. The CA of NCO13 towards various concentrations of methanol has been evaluated (Fig. S3(b)†). The current density at 0.45 V shows an increase after adding successive concentrations of methanol and becomes saturated at a methanol concentration of 1.25 M.
Fig. S5(a)† shows the CV at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 presenting the electrocatalytic activity of pristine rGO towards various concentrations of methanol. Pristine rGO shows low electrocatalytic performance towards various methanol concentrations. CA has been utilized to evaluate the catalytic performance for 3600 s at various concentrations of methanol (Fig. S4(b)†). Table 1 shows the electrooxidation performance of NCO26 in comparison to the earlier reports. Based on the observation of the electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation, it is concluded that the NCO26 nanocomposite is the best candidate for methanol oxidation even at higher concentrations for longer durations.

3.4 Supercapacitor studies
The energy storage properties of NCO26, NCO13, and pristine rGO as supercapacitors were investigated by CV, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance (EIS) in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 10(a) shows the comparison of CV in the potential range of 0.0 V to 1.0 V (Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 of NCO26, NCO13, and pure rGO. Pristine rGO exhibits typical rectangular behavior and no redox peaks were observed. NCO26 shows an increased redox peak current in comparison to NCO13. It evidences that the area covered by NCO26 is larger than those of NCO13 and rGO which is due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NCO26. It is believed that the dispersed NiCo2O4 porous nanorods over the rGO matrix promote the catalytic process and the rGO matrix provides a fast and efficient conduction path through which the electrocatalytic activity of NCO26 is improved. The specific capacitances calculated from the CV are 354.75, 253.23, and 230 F g−1, respectively, for NCO26, NCO13, and pristine rGO at 1 mV s−1. In addition to CV comparison, the charge–discharge properties of NCO26, NCO13, and pristine rGO were investigated at 1 A g−1 as shown in Fig. 10(b). Pristine rGO exhibits a typical triangular behavior due to the non-faradaic reaction process, while NCO13 and NCO26 exhibit triangular behaviour with a small fraction of plateau region due to the faradaic reaction process. NCO26 exhibits a higher discharge time in comparison to NCO13 and pure rGO in the potential window of 0–1 V. NCO26, NCO13 and pristine rGO exhibit specific capacitances of 375.32, 218.23, and 168.32 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Fig. 10(c) shows the scan rate-dependent behavior of NCO26. At a low scan rate, the CV exhibits redox peaks which is due to the intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions, and at a high scan rate, the redox peaks were not observed clearly. The rectangular behavior with the presence of redox peaks further confirms the pseudocapacitive nature of NCO26 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Upon increasing the scan rate, the anodic and cathodic current increased and the shape of the cyclic voltammogram is maintained which depicts the good rate capability of the NCO26 electrode. Additionally, the gravimetric specific capacitance at numerous scan rates was calculated by the integration of the enclosed area in a cyclic voltammogram. NCO26 exhibits a specific capacitance of 354.75 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 and 114.35 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1. Fig. 10(d) shows the comparison of specific capacitances of pristine rGO, NCO13, and NCO26 calculated from their respective CVs at various scan rates. The power law describes the relationship between current (i) and scan rate (υ) in CV i = aυb(5)where a and b are constants. The value of b can be assessed from the slopes of plots log(i) and log(υ). The value of b should be restricted between 0.5 and 1. A value of 0.5 shows the pure diffusion-controlled process while a value of 1 shows the pure capacitive process. Intermediate values have mixed contributions of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes. Fig. S6(a)† shows the plot of log(i) and log(υ) for NCO26 at various potentials and the corresponding b values are presented in Fig. S6(b).† It is evident from Fig. S6(b)† that b values are in the range of 0.6 to 0.8 in the potential range of 0.5 to 1 V for NCO26 and NCO13.

Furthermore, the approach by Dunn and co-workers45 was adopted to evaluate the amount of charge storage via the capacitive and faradaic processes. Typically, in CV, the current (i) at a fixed potential (V) depends on the scan rate (υ), which is given by the following equation i(υ) = A1υ + A2υ1/2(6)after reshuffling, i(υ)/υ1/2 = A1υ1/2 + A2(7)
where A1υ and A2υ1/2 are the fractions of the total current related to the capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. The values of A1 and A2 can be estimated from the slope and the intercept of the plot of i(υ)/υ1/2 and υ1/2 at fixed potentials. Fig. S7(a) and (b)† shows the capacitive current contribution in the red shaded region and the total current of NCO26 in the black line at 100 and 1 mV s−1. The amount of current generated from the diffusion-controlled process can be calculated by subtracting the capacitive current from the total current. The capacitive and diffusion-controlled process contributions in NCO26 at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 11. At a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution has been calculated to be 25.71% while it increased to 83.85% at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As can be seen from the analysis that the diffusion-controlled process dominates at a lower scan rate while the capacitive process dominates at a higher scan rate due to the limitation of ions reached at the electrode/electrolyte interface at a higher scan rate.
 Fig. 11  Exploration of the capacitive and diffusion-controlled process contributions to the total capacitance of NCO26 at various scan rates. 
The total charge (Qt) accrued at the electrode is the sum of charge accommodated at the outer surface (Qo) and the charge in the interior surface (Qi) is estimated by Trassati's approach. Qt = Qo + Qi(8)
The charge accommodated at the exterior surface is estimated from Fig. S8† as 212.23 C g−1 from the extra plotting of the fitted line of the plot of Q vs. υ−1/2 at υ = ∞. Q = Qo + B1υ−1/2(9)
Accordingly, the total charge was calculated to be 478.46 C g−1 from the plot of 1/Q vs. υ1/2 where υ = 0. 1/Q = 1/Qt + B2υ1/2(10)where B1 and B2 are the constants related to the diffusion-controlled process and the capacitive process. Thus, the inner stored charge was calculated to be 266.23 C g−1 by subtracting the outer surface charge from the total charge accommodated.

Fig. 12(a) displays the GCD behavior of NCO26 at various current densities in 1 M Na2SO4. NCO26 exhibits specific capacitances of 375.32, 310.45, 288.64, 250.23, 217.73, 190.35, 150.78, and 120.75 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 10, 15, and 20 A g−1, respectively. The obtained specific capacitance is higher than those of previously reported carbon-based materials.46–50 Upon increasing the current density, the specific capacitance decreased which is due to the kinetic limitation of ion permeation in the matrix through the electrode/electrolyte interface at higher current densities. Outstanding performance was observed for NCO26 which can maintain a specific capacitance of 120.75 F g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1. All the charge–discharge curves observed are triangular with a small fraction of plateau region confirming the pseudocapacitive process for charge storage. Fig. 12(b) shows the comparison of the specific capacitance calculated for pristine rGO, NCO13, and NCO26 from the GCD plot. At all current densities, NCO26 exhibits higher specific capacitance in comparison to NCO13 and pristine rGO. Furthermore, the cycling stability of the NCO26 electrode in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte was assessed by running continuous charging–discharging cycles of the electrode in the potential window of 0–1 V (Fig. 12(c)). The electrode exhibits remarkable performance with 100% retention of specific capacitance as well as 100% coulombic efficiency after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The inset shows the first and last 10 GCD cycles.

Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate the charge transfer behavior of the NCO26 electrode before and after 10000 GCD cycles. Fig. S9† shows the complex impedance spectra of NCO26 (at OCP condition) before and after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in a frequency region of 200 kHz–20 mHz at an AC perturbation voltage of 5 mV. Furthermore, the Nyquist plots have been fitted with the EC-Lab software using the electrical equivalent circuit model, and certain characteristics such as series resistance, charge transfer resistance, and double layer capacitance were estimated. Before and after cycling, depressed semicircles were observed in high and moderate frequency regions while slant lines were observed at low-frequency regions. Series resistance (Rs) were obtained as 0.7 and 0.8 Ω for before and after 10000 cycles from the intercept where the semicircle touches the real Z-axis. Charge transfer resistances (Rcts) were calculated to be 8.5 and 5.4 Ω before and after 10000 cycles from the diameter of the semi-circle in the high frequency region to the low-frequency region. The double-layer capacitance was estimated as 0.4 × 10−3 F and 0.38 × 10−3 F before and after 5000 cycles, respectively. The decrease in the charge transfer resistance could be due to the activation of the electrode material via increased diffusion of Na+ ions to the NCO–rGO matrix during the cycling process. NCO26 exhibits better electrochemical properties. Furthermore, to utilize the better performance of the NCO26 electrode in practical applications, an asymmetric device was constructed using NCO26 as the positive electrode and rGO as the negative electrode in 1 M Na2SO4.
Fig. S10(a)† shows the CV of NCO26 and rGO at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 in the potential range of 0 to 1 V and 0 to −1 V, respectively. From the enclosed area, the mass ratio of the positive to negative electrode was estimated from the charge balance equation as 0.43. Fig. 13(a) shows the cyclic voltammogram of the ASC device at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in several potential windows. It is observed from the CV that after the 2 V potential window, the oxygen evolution starts taking place. Therefore, we have restricted all the electrochemical measurements to 2 V.

(c) Cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the ASC for 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A g−1. 

Fig. 13(b) shows the scan rate-dependent behavior of the asymmetric device. It is observed that all the CVs exhibit the same shape and do not change with an increase in the scan rate, indicating good stability. The shape of the CV is pseudorectangular, depicting the pseudocapacitive process of charge storage. The specific capacitances were calculated to be 122.5, 115.2, 108.3, 103.7, 97.8, 92.2, 85.6, 76.7, and 69.3 F g−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150 and 200 mV s−1, respectively. Fig. 13(c) shows the GCD of the asymmetric device at various current densities in 1 M Na2SO4 in the potential window of 0–2 V. All the GCD plots are quasi-linear which suggests the pseudo-capacitive charge storage process as evidenced by the CV results. The specific capacitances were calculated to be 122.2, 115.4, 110.2, 106.5, 103.8, 97.4, 88.8, 66.5, and 44.8 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 A g−1 respectively.
Furthermore, the cycling stability of the asymmetric device was evaluated and it was observed that the device can attain the initial specific capacitance after cycling with various current densities as shown in Fig. S10(b).† The cycling stability of the asymmetric device at a constant current density of 30 A g−1 was measured and it shows a retention of 74.3% after 5000 cycles as shown in Fig. 13(d). Moreover, the device shows a coulombic efficiency of 100% throughout the 5000 GCD cycles. The inset shows the first and last 10 GCD cycles of the asymmetric device at a current density of 30 A g−1.
Energy and power densities are more crucial factors for an assembled device. The energy density (Es) and power density (Ps) of the rGO//NCO26 ASC device were calculated at various current densities by the following relation Es = 0.5Cs × V2(11) Ps = Es/t(12)where Cs, V, and t are the specific capacitance, voltage window, and discharge time, respectively. Fig. 14 shows the Ragone plot of the energy and power densities of the assembled asymmetric device. A remarkable energy density of 67.89 W h kg−1 and a power density of 1.0 kW kg−1 were observed at a current density of 1 A g−1. The asymmetric device sustains the energy density and power density to 24.89 W h kg−1 and 29.67 kW kg−1, respectively, at a high current density of 30 A g−1. The achieved energy density and power density values are higher than those in earlier reports.30,52–55Table 2 shows the comparison of the electrochemical performance of an asymmetric device based on AC//NCO with earlier reported Ni and Co-based oxides. Based upon the asymmetric device research outcomes, it is presumed that this device can be a good candidate for next-generation energy storage devices.

4. Conclusions
This work reports the multifunctional properties of NiCo2O4–rGO (1:26) towards water splitting, methanol oxidation, and supercapacitor applications. The photochemical water oxidation reaction was performed with two photocatalysts, NCO13 and NCO26. It was established that both the catalysts are efficient in generating oxygen under light illumination. It is also proved that NCO26 works far more effectively as a photocatalyst compared to the other. The electrocatalyst shows remarkable performance in methanol electro-oxidation via its long-term stability (3600 s) in a mixed electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol as well as producing high current (24 mA cm−2) at 0.45 V in cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, respectively. Apart from this, an asymmetric device based on NiCo2O4–rGO (1:26) exhibits a specific capacitance of 122.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a retention of 74.3% after 5000 cycles. An energy density of 67.89 W h kg−1 and a power density of 1 kW kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 are found. Moreover, the electrochemical and photochemical performances of NCO26 are far better than those of NCO13 which could be due to the high surface area provided by the rGO matrix and excellent electron conduction throughout the nanocomposite. The multifunctional character of NCO26 has made it a smart nanocomposite in the field of materials science and opens new avenues for future research.
