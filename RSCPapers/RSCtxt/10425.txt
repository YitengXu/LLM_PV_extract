    , Accepted 24th April 2020First published on 27th April 2020AbstractLa/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N has been investigated as visible-light-active photocatalysts for water reduction. Unlike previous aliovalent doping that leads to a decrease in light absorption, La/Zr co-doping largely preserves the visible light absorption of SrTaO2N. More importantly, the La/Zr co-doping not only helps to improve surface hydrophilicity and reduce particle sizes but also effectively inhibits defect formation (e.g. Ta4+) in SrTaO2N. These modifications are responsible for significant enhancements in photocatalytic H2 production. AQE as high as 0.84% was achieved at 420 ± 20 nm for Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6), which also showed good durability and stability. Further analysis suggests that La/Zr co-doping negatively shifts the conduction band edge positions of SrTaO2N and contributes to better charge separation conditions.
1. Introduction
The thirst for the clean and secure energy supply of our modern economy has raised strong incentives and enthusiasm for searching and developing green and sustainable energy resources/technologies.1–3 As a flagship example, solar water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen on particulate photocatalysts holds great promises in setting up green and sustainable energy infrastructures.4–8 This is not only because solar insolation is virtually inexhaustible but also because hydrogen is a clean energy vector, whose recycling has no carbon emission.9 Nevertheless, the practical deployment of this tempting technique still awaits tangible advancements on semiconductor photocatalysts, in which efficient solar to hydrogen conversion can be achieved.10,11
Conventional stable semiconductors such as TiO2 and SrTiO3 have intrinsic drawbacks that they are active only to UV photons, which account for less than 4% of the entire solar spectrum.12–14 Other small bandgap semiconductors, e.g. CdS and Fe2O3, either suffer from poor stability under water splitting conditions, sluggish charge mobility, or inappropriate band edge positions that are not suitable for applications in solar water splitting.15,16 Therefore, semiconductors potentially feasible for solar water splitting are rather scarce.
Recently, perovskite oxynitrides with nominal chemical formula AII/IIIMV/IV(O, N)3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba and La; M = Nb, Ta and Ti) have drawn considerable attention as promising photocatalysts in water splitting reactions.17–23 This interest arises mainly from the following considerations24–29: (i) they have small bandgap (1.7–2.6 eV) that can harvest a large portion of solar energy; (ii) they have proper band edge alignments that can drive water redox reactions; (iii) they possess good dielectric properties that enable facile exciton (e–h pair) dissociation; (iv) they generally have good chemical inertness under harsh conditions. Notwithstanding these attractive properties, these perovskite oxynitrides normally exhibit rather poor photocatalytic activities for water splitting.30–35 This has been attributed to various types of defects (Ti3+, Nb4+, Ta4+, etc.) induced during synthesis of materials (high-temperature ammonolysis) that rapidly dissipates most photo-generated charges.35–39 How to control defect concentration within these compounds is critical to improving their photocatalytic performance, and remains a challenge.
Lately, the aliovalent doping of perovskite oxynitrides, e.g. Ca-doped LaTiO2N,40–43 Mg-doped SrNbO2N,44 Na-doped SrTaO2N45,46 and Zr-doped BaTaO2N,47 have exhibited encouraging results on ameliorating their photocatalytic activities. This refers to partially substituting their constituent elements, therefore altering the chemical environment within these compounds that helps to inhibit the formation of defects.48 However, aliovalent doping often results in charge imbalance and degradation of their visible light absorption due to a decreased N/O ratio.23,49 As N 2p orbitals contribute mostly to the top of the valence band, a lower N/O ratio is generally accompanied by an enlarge bandgap. In this regard, a co-doping strategy with proper charge modulation might be helpful to overcome these shortcomings. As an example, we co-doped La/Zr into SrTaO2N in this study and demonstrated the usefulness of this strategy in maintaining light absorption, controlling defect concentrations and more importantly improving the photocatalytic performance in water splitting reactions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
La/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N, i.e. Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) was prepared via the thermal ammonolysis of a proper amorphous oxide precursor. These amorphous oxide precursors were synthesized by a polymerized complex method according to previous reports.25,38 Typically, for the synthesis of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N, 0.5908 g strontium nitrate (Aladdin, 99.5%), 1.0000 g tantalum chloride (Aladdin, 99.99%), 1.8132 g lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (Aladdin, 99.9%), 1.7978 g zirconium nitrate pentahydrate (Aladdin, 99.9%) and 8.0000 g anhydrous citric acid (Aladdin, 99.5%) were dissolved in 10 ml ethylene glycol (Aladdin, GC grade). Continuous magnetic stirring at 373 K was applied to facilitate the dissolution of all chemicals until a clear and transparent solution was formed. The solution was then heated on a hot-plate at 473 K for 2 h and at 573 K for another 3 h to promote polymerization and a brown gel was obtained. This gel was collected and transferred to a crucible and calcined at 823 K for 10 h to burn out organic components. The resultant white amorphous powders were used as precursors for further ammonolysis. Ammonolysis was performed in a tube furnace in which about 0.2 g precursor powders were mounted in the center in an alumina boat. After introducing ultrapure ammonia (Jiaya Chemicals, 99.999%) at a flow rate of 250 mL min−1, the tube furnace was heated to 1323 K at 7 K min−1, maintained at 1323 K for 10 h and cooled naturally. The powders produced were rinsed with dilute hydrochloric acid and then deionized water five times and were dried. Other samples with different stoichiometries were prepared under the same procedures except using different molar ratios of the raw reagents at the initial step.
2.2 Materials characterization
Freshly prepared powdered samples were first investigated via performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Haoyuan DX2700B diffractometer using Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) and Cu Kα2 (λ = 1.5444 Å) as incident radiations. The data collection was performed using a step size of 0.02° and a duration of 0.1 s at each step. For structural analysis, Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was conducted using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software suite. The optical absorption properties of sample powders were analyzed on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO-V750, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere. The spectrophotometer was operated in the diffuse reflectance mode and data collected were analyzed using the JASCO software suite. A Spectralon plate (JASCO) was used as a reference non-absorbing material for baseline correction. Sample powders were also subjected to microscopic analysis using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800) equipped with a Mica energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis system. Their surface state was inspected via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Escalab 250) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The XPS data were adjusted by referring to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.7 eV.50 The XPSPEAKFIT software was also adopted for data fitting and analysis. Gaussian–Lorentzian function (Lorentzian weighting of 20%) and a Shirley-type background were used for the XPS data fit. The surface areas of the sample powders were evaluated by using a Micromeritics instrument TriStar 3000 and were calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. Nitrogen content of sample powders was estimated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (SETRAM, Labsys evo DSC). The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an F-7000 FL Spectrophotometer. UV photons at 250 nm were used as the excitation source. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were recorded on a Horiba FL-1016 spectrophotometer. Decay curves were analyzed at the emission of 375 nm under 260 nm nanosecond pulsed laser excitation. The Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis was performed based on the sample powders deposited on an FTO glass. The deposition procedures were similar to those reported in literature.38,51 The FTO glass deposited with the sample powders were adopted for MS analysis. The MS data were collected based on a three-electrode configuration setup using a Zahner electrochemical workstation. The deposited FTO glass, a Pt foil (10 × 10 mm) and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. K3PO4/K2HPO4 (25 mL, 0.1 M, pH = 12.66) was used as an electrolyte and a buffer. Impedance data at 1000 Hz with 10 mV amplitude in a voltage range from 0.2 V to 1.0 V vs. RHE were used to extract capacitance for the MS analysis.
2.3 Photocatalytic water splitting
Photocatalytic properties of sample powders were accessed by monitoring their hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial agent under visible light illumination. This was done in a top-irradiation-type reactor connected to a gas-closed circulation and evacuation system (Perfect Light, Labsolar-ШAG). Pt was applied as a cocatalyst to facilitate hydrogen production and was deposited onto sample powders by a thermal deposition method: proper amounts of an H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (1 mg mL−1) were added to sample powders to form a slurry. The slurry was heated at 90 °C until dry and calcined at 180 °C for 2 h to convert H2PtCl6 into Pt nanoparticles. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg sample powders deposited with Pt were uniformly dispersed into a 100 mL sodium sulfite aqueous solution (0.05 M) to form suspensions. The suspensions were then transferred into a reactor and were evacuated for 45 min to remove the dissolved air. A water jacket was used to maintain the reactor temperature at around 20 °C. A 300 W Xenon lamp (Perfect Light, PLX-SXE300, China) was used as the light source. Visible light was produced by filtering the light beam of the lamp with a UV-cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). Monochromatic light was used to determine the apparent quantum efficiency of sample powders and was generated by filtering the output of the lamp with a bandpass filter (Perfect Light) at 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm and 600 nm. Photon flux at an individual wavelength was calibrated using a quantum meter (Apogee MP-300, USA). Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was then calculated using the following equation: (1)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The phase composition and crystal structure
The use of amorphous precursors for ammonolysis has been very helpful for synthesizing these multi-component compounds. This is not only because cation ratios can be easily tuned but also because all the ions are homogeneously distributed into the amorphous precursors, which greatly slows down the threshold for the phase formation during ammonolysis.25Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) together with standard patterns for SrTaO2N (JCPDS: 00-040-0662) and La2Zr2O7 (JCPDS: 00-017-0450). Their patterns match closely with the standard ones of SrTaO2N up to x = 0.6, indicating the successful co-doping of La/Zr into the perovskite lattice. Further increasing the La/Zr content to x = 0.8 leads to clear phase segregation. The strong reflections of the impurity phase La2Zr2O7 in the XRD patterns for x = 0.8 implies that La/Zr probably has a doping limit of around 60% in SrTaO2N. Despite the successful co-doping of La/Zr at x ≤ 0.6, their XRD patterns undergo successive shifting toward low angles for all reflections (Fig. 1, right side), implying unit cell expansion. We then performed Rietveld refinement on their XRD patterns. The refinement converges with reasonable goodness-of-fit parameters using I4/mcm as the space group and under constrains that La/Sr, Zr/Ta occupy the same crystallographic positions with equal isotropic temperature factors. Thereby, dopants La/Zr most likely have random distributions in the perovskite lattice. This is also confirmed by the SEM-EDX mapping analysis in which all elements are homogeneously distributed (Fig. S1†). Typical refined patterns for SrTaO2N (x = 0.0) and Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) are displayed in Fig. 2, and the refined unit cell parameters are tabulated in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the unit cell parameters monotonically increase with La/Zr doping levels, being consistent with previous expectations. Apart from the unit cell parameters, La/Zr co-doping also modifies the tilting of Ta(O,N)6 octahedrons. This can be visually inspected by comparing the refined crystal structures of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) to SrTaO2N (x = 0.0) in which the anti-phase tilting of Ta(O,N)6 octahedrons along the [001] direction has been increased. This observation has a strong implication that the Ta–O/N–Ta bond angle is more deviated from 180° after La/Zr co-doping.

3.2. UV-vis absorption spectra
The light absorption of semiconductors is a prerequisite for subsequent photocatalytic reactions. This was evaluated by their UV-Vis absorption spectra. Fig. 3a displays UV-Vis absorption spectra of Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), which are converted from diffuse reflectance spectra. Pristine SrTaO2N (x = 0.0) shows strong absorption in the visible light region and its absorption edge lies close to 600 nm. This is in good accordance with the previous reports.45,46,52,53 However, unlike the aliovalent doping of SrTaO2N that often results in strong recession of its light absorption,45,46,54 La/Zr co-doping largely maintains the visible light absorbance. This can be visually seen from their color (see the digital photograph in Fig. 3a) and is also confirmed from their bandgap values determined by Kubelka–Munk transformations (Fig. 3b and Table 1). All samples have similar bandgap values at around 2.1 eV, indicating good preservation of the light harvesting capability after La/Zr co-doping. This is of high importance for solar water splitting as the bandgap determines the theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.10 The maintenance of light absorption for Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) probably stems from a good charge modulation (i.e.) for cations that help to keep similar N/O ratios among all compounds. This is confirmed by the TGA analysis that showed all compounds having a close N content (Fig. S2†).

3.3. Microstructures
The sample powders of Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) were further studied under an electron microscope. Fig. 4 displays typical field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images for all the sample powders. The powders of pristine SrTaO2N (x = 0.0) are composed of small particles with a particle size of around 100 nm. Nevertheless, La/Zr co-doping considerably reduces the particle size. Particles as small as 10–20 nm have been observed for Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (x = 0.2 and 0.4) (Fig. 4b and c). This is also verified by an increment in the BET surface area after La/Zr co-doping (Table 1). Such an interesting phenomenon can be rationalized by the refractory nature of La/Zr elements that hinder grain growth during ammonolysis.55,56 The rearrangement of La/Zr is probably much slower than that of O/N, therefore leading to the formation of small particles as well as porous microstructures. A smaller particle size is beneficial for photocatalytic reactions as there would be more surface reaction sites as well as shorter charge migration distance from bulk to the surface.

3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
The elemental distribution as well as the surface state of Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) were investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 5 illustrates the XPS data of the core-level electrons in their constituent elements. The O 1s state of all compounds is composed of two overlapping peaks centered at around 529.7 eV and 531.6 eV (Fig. 5a). These peaks can be assigned to the lattice oxygen species (O2−) and surface hydroxyl groups (OH−), respectively. It can be realized that La/Zr co-doping favors the formation of the hydroxyl groups at the surface as the intensity of the peak at around 531.6 eV clearly increases along with the La/Zr content. This suggests that La/Zr helps to increase the surface hydrophilicity of SrTaO2N, which is further confirmed by the water contact angle measurements (Fig. S3†). For the Ta 4f state (Fig. 5b), pristine SrTaO2N shows a large hump that can be fitted by four overlapping peaks centered at 24.2 eV, 26.2 eV, 25.3 eV and 27.2 eV. These four peaks can be assigned to the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 states of Ta4+ species and Ta5+ species, respectively. The presence of the strong peaks for the Ta4+ species indicates that pristine SrTaO2N is rich in defects. These defects are generally detrimental to the photocatalytic activity as they may trap photo-generated charges and promote charge recombination. Quite interestingly, co-doping La/Zr effectively suppresses the formation of the Ta4+ species whose XPS peaks clearly decrease in response to La/Zr co-doping (Ta4+/Ta5+ = 1.08 and 0.96 for x = 0.0 and 0.2, respectively) and eventually disappear at high doping levels (x ≥ 0.4) (Fig. 5b). This might be understood by the inductive effect of Zr.48 Zr has lower electronegativity or has more electron-donating ability than Ta, which helps to increase the level of covalency of neighboring Ta–O/N bonds. A more covalent environment for Ta is beneficial to stabilize Ta at its higher oxidation state. The N 1s state exhibits a single peak at around 395.4 eV (Fig. 5c), which is slightly overlapped with the Ta 4p3/2 state. The nearly constant peak area for the N 1s state in all the samples confirms again that the nitrogen content is maintained within these compounds. This is in contrast to the Sr 3d, Ta 4f, La 3d and Zr 3d states whose peak intensities vary in good accordance with the La/Zr doping content (Fig. 5b and d–f).

3.5. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic properties of Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) were then evaluated by comparing their hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial agent under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420). Control experiments with one of the following parameters missing, i.e., sample powders, light illumination, and Na2SO3 aqueous solution, were performed first. No hydrogen was produced in these control experiments, therefore removing the possibility of any spontaneous reactions for hydrogen production. The temporal hydrogen evolution profiles for Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) are plotted in Fig. 6a. For all the samples, continuous H2 production has been detected, indicating real photocatalytic reactions. Nevertheless, SrTaO2N produces only trivial amounts of H2 and is consistent with the results in the literatures.30,31,57 Quite strikingly, this situation has been largely improved by co-doping La/Zr into SrTaO2N. For instance, more than one order of magnitude higher H2 was produced by Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) than that by SrTaO2N, highlighting the usefulness of this co-doping strategy. The activity of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) has also been investigated by varying the amounts of Pt loaded (Fig. 6b). An optimal loading point at 0.5 wt% has been realized for the Pt cocatalyst, which has been adopted for further action spectrum analysis. The action spectrum of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6), i.e. AQE vs. excitation wavelength, is plotted together with its UV-Vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 6c. The AQE data shows a clear dependence on the excitation wavelength that closely matches with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum, evidently suggesting that the H2 production of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) is a photon-driven process. An AQE as high as 0.84% has been achieved at 420 ± 20 nm for photocatalytic water reduction reactions. This performance is better than or at least comparable to modified SrTaO2N reported in the literatures.45,54,58,59 The durability and stability of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) have also been tested for repeated usage for H2 production. Fig. 6d shows the extended three cycles for H2 production under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420). The activity of Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) has been maintained for these cycles and post-analysis (e.g. XRD) suggests no changes in sample powders, confirming good durability and stability of La/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N (Fig. S4†).

3.6. Band edge positions and photoluminescence (PL) spectra
In order to get a deeper insight into the improved photocatalytic activity of La/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N, the band edge positions of SrTaO2N and Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) have been determined. This can be done via the Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis combined with the XPS valence band scan. Fig. 7a illustrates the MS plot of SrTaO2N and Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6). The linear part in the MS curves is used to determine the flat band potential (i.e. Fermi level) according to MS equations:60,61 (2)where C is the capacitance, Vfb is the flat band potential, εr and ε0 are the relative and vacuum permittivities, respectively, e0 is the charge quantity, k is the Boltzman constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and Nd is the donor concentration. The flat band potential was determined to be −0.08 V and 0.19 V for SrTaO2N and Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6), respectively. A larger positive slope of the MS curves for Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) than that for SrTaO2N also implies reduced defect concentrations in the former compound. On the other hand, the XPS valence band scan (Fig. 7b) suggests that the valence band maximum (VBM) is about 1.6 eV and 1.35 eV more positive than the Fermi levels of SrTaO2N and Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6), respectively. Considering their bandgap values, their band edge positions can be deduced, and are schematically represented in Fig. 7c. It can be seen from the plot that both compounds have a close valence band edge position. This can be rationalized by their similar N/O ratios in the structures as hybridizations of N/O 2p orbitals contribute to VBM. However, for conduction band edges, Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) has a conduction band minimum (CBM) of about 0.1 V more negative than that of pristine SrTaO2N. This may partially explain the improved photocatalytic activity for water reduction reactions as electrons in Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) will have higher reducing power than those in SrTaO2N. Recalling the fact that La/Zr co-doping deviate the Ta–O/N–Ta bond angle away from 180° according to the previous structural analysis, the negative shift of CBM probably results from a decreased overlapping of Ta 5d orbitals that shrinks conduction band dispersions.29 In addition, photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra suggest that Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) has a much lower PL signal than SrTaO2N (Fig. 8a). Their time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra further indicate that photo-generated charges have a much longer charge lifetime in Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6) than in SrTaO2N (Fig. 8b). These results clearly reveal a much-improved charge separation condition in La/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N.

4. Conclusions
La/Zr co-doped SrTaO2N, i.e. Sr1−xLaxTa1−xZrxO2N (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) has been prepared via the ammonolysis of amorphous precursors. La/Zr has a doping level around 60% in the SrTaO2N structure and La2Zr2O7 appears as an impurity phase at higher doping levels. La/Zr co-doping slightly expands the unit cell of SrTaO2N and increases the tilting of Ta(O,N)6 octahedrons. The visible light absorption of SrTaO2N has been largely preserved after co-doping La/Zr as N/O ratios in the structures have been maintained. Introducing La/Zr dopants into SrTaO2N not only decreases particle size and inhibits the formation of Ta4+ defects but also improves surface hydrophilicity. More importantly, La/Zr co-doping results in significant enhancements of the photocatalytic activity of SrTaO2N for water reduction. AQE of as high as 0.84% has been achieved at 420 ± 20 nm for Sr0.4La0.6Ta0.4Zr0.6O2N (x = 0.6), which also shows good durability and stability for photocatalytic water reduction reactions. Mott–Schottky analysis and the XPS valence band scan suggest that La/Zr co-doping has little impact on valence band edge positions but negatively shifts the conduction band edge positions of SrTaO2N. This observation can be explained from the structural changes of SrTaO2N in response to La/Zr co-doping, which in turn modifies the electronic structures. PL and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra further indicate the improved charge separation conditions after co-doping La/Zr into SrTaO2N.
