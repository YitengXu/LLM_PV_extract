Here we demonstrate a graphene/single GaAs nanowire Schottky junction photovoltaic device. The Schottky junction is fabricated by covering a single layer graphene onto an n-doped GaAs nanowire. Under 532 nm laser excitation, the device exhibits a high responsivity of 231 mA W−1 and a short response/recover time of 85/118 μs at zero bias. Under AM 1.5 G solar illumination, the device has an open-circuit voltage of 75.0 mV and a short-circuit current density of 425 mA cm−2, yielding a remarkable conversion efficiency of 8.8%. The excellent photovoltaic performance of the device is attributed to the strong built-in electric field in the Schottky junction as well as the transparent property of graphene. The device is promising for self-powered high-speed photodetectors and low-cost high-efficiency solar cells.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their compelling electrical and optical properties.1,2 To date, NW optoelectronic devices based on p(i)n or Schottky junctions have been developed, including optical sources,3 photodetectors,4–7 and solar cells.8–10 In comparison with the p(i)n junction, the Schottky junction has unique advantages such as low cost, easy fabrication, and low capacitance.4,11 Graphene is an ideal contact material with rather low absorption over a broad wavelength range and high electron mobility, which is promising for NW optoelectronic devices.12,13 Due to the difference in work functions, Schottky junctions can be formed between graphene and some n-type NWs. Recently, graphene/(GaN, ZnO) NW Schottky junctions have been fabricated, showing great potential in ultraviolet photodetectors.14,15 However, graphene/GaAs NW Schottky junctions, which are promising for near-infrared photodetectors and solar cells, have been rarely reported.4
In this work, a graphene/single GaAs NW photovoltaic device is demonstrated. By covering single layer graphene onto an n-type GaAs NW, a Schottky junction is formed with a relatively large junction area. Under 532 nm laser excitation, the device exhibits a high responsivity of 231 mA W−1 and a short response/recover time of 85/118 μs at zero bias. Under AM 1.5 G solar illumination, the device has an open-circuit voltage of 75.0 mV and a short-circuit current density of 425 mA cm−2, yielding a remarkable conversion efficiency of 8.8%. The performance of the device is compared to those of other NW devices and the physical mechanism is also discussed.
2. Experimental details & physical mechanism
The NWs were grown using a Thomas Swan Closed Coupled Shower head (CCS) metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system at a pressure of 100 Torr. The carrier gas was H2. Before the NW growth, a 4 nm Au film was deposited on the n-type GaAs (111) B substrate (n ∼1019 cm3) by magnetron sputtering. The Au-coated substrate was then loaded onto the MOCVD reactor and annealed at 645 °C under ambient arsine (AsH3) for 300 s to form Au–Ga alloyed particles as a catalyst. Trimethylgallium (TMGa) and arsine (AsH3) were used as precursors, with a molar flow of 45.9 μmol min−1 and 2870 μmol min−1, respectively. n-Type doping was achieved by introducing silane (SiH4) with a flow rate of 1786 μmol min−1 during the NW growth. The NWs were grown at 490 °C for 2000 s.
In this work, a monolayer graphene synthesized via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was used.16,17 The graphene film was prepared at 1000 °C by using a mixed gas of CH4 (40 SCCM) and H2 (20 SCCM) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and 25 μm thick Cu foil was employed as the catalytic substrate. After the growth, the graphene film was spin-coated with 5 wt% polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in chlorobenzene, and the underlying Cu foil was removed in Marble's reagent solution (CuSO4:HCl:H2O = 10 g:50 mL:50 mL). To fabricate the NW/graphene-based device, the PMMA-supported graphene was directly transferred onto the device, followed by the removal of PMMA using acetone. A Schottky junction is formed due to the difference in the work functions between the intrinsic graphene and GaAs NW.4
The scheme in Fig. 1(a)–(e) elaborates the detailed procedures for constructing the graphene/single GaAs NW Schottky junction photovoltaic device. First, the GaAs NWs were separated from the substrate in an ethyl alcohol solution by ultrasonication and then transferred onto a silicon substrate covered with 300 nm thick SiO2. Next, the NWs were etched using a H2SO4:H2O2:H2O solution for 5 seconds to remove the surface oxide layer.18 Electrodes (Ti-bottom 80 nm/Pt 50 nm/Au-top 300 nm) were then deposited onto the substrate by ultraviolet (UV) lithography and magnetron sputtering followed by a “lift-off” process. To achieve Ohmic contact between the GaAs NW and the electrode, a rapid annealing process (200 °C – 80 s/420 °C – 15 s/450 °C – 55 s) was adopted.19 Finally, the graphene was transferred onto the substrate followed by UV lithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) process.

To interpret the working mechanism of the device, the band alignment of the graphene/GaAs NW interface under illumination at zero bias is presented in Fig. 1(f). EC, EV, and EF represent the conduction band edge, valence band edge, and the Fermi level of the GaAs NW, respectively. φGraphene, φGaAs and χ represent the work function of graphene, the work function of GaAs NW, and the electron affinity of GaAs NW, respectively. There is a strong built-in electric field in the junction area due to the difference in work functions between graphene and GaAs NW, which promotes the effective and rapid separation of the photogenerated carriers when irradiated.4–6
3. Results and discussion
The as-grown GaAs NWs and the fabricated device were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2(a) shows the side view SEM image of the GaAs NW array. Almost all the NWs are vertical to the substrate, with an average length of 25 μm and the diameter ranging from several tens to several hundreds of nanometers. Fig. 2(b) shows the scanning TEM (STEM) image of a single GaAs NW removed from the substrate. The NW has a length of 25 μm and a diameter decreasing from 620 to 450 nm from the bottom up. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the NW, respectively. The NW exhibits a pure zinc blende crystal structure, without dislocations or twins. Fig. 2(e) shows the SEM image of the graphene/single GaAs NW device. Fig. 2(f) presents the high-magnification SEM image of the junction, from which the effective light absorption area can be obtained (9.8 μm in length and 900 nm in width).

Fig. 3(a) shows the Raman spectroscopy of the graphene/GaAs NW connection area, which was measured using a Renishaw Raman spectrometer at room temperature. From the measured spectrum, two strong peaks can be observed: a 2D peak (2686.8 cm−1) and a G peak (1593.3 cm−1). The D peak at 1345.0 cm−1 is almost negligible, suggesting the high quality of graphene used in this device.20 Moreover, the Raman peak (267.5 cm−1) of the GaAs NW is also observed.21

(d) The photoresponse characteristics of the graphene/single GaAs NW device under different illumination intensities. 
The I–V characteristics were measured using a Keysight B2902A Precision Source/Measure Unit. Before the measurement of the graphene/GaAs NW device, the electrical characteristics of a single GaAs NW with two metal electrodes were determined, as shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be seen that the current increases linearly with voltage in the dark and under illumination, suggesting Ohmic contacts between the NW and electrodes. The I–V characteristics of the graphene/GaAs NW device were then measured by applying a positive voltage on graphene, which was regarded as the forward bias. Fig. 3(c) shows a semi-log I–V curve of the graphene/GaAs NW heterojunction in the dark, which exhibits an obvious rectifying behavior. In view of the fact that Ohmic contact between the GaAs NW and the metal electrode is achieved as shown in Fig. 3(b), while the graphene can form Ohmic contact with metal electrodes due to the lack of a bandgap,22 the observed rectifying effect should be attributed to the graphene/GaAs NW junction.5,18,19 Based on the thermionic-emission theory, the I–V characteristics of a Schottky diode are given by the following equation:23 (1)where J(T, V) is the current density across the graphene/single GaAs NW interface, e is the charge number of an electron, V is the applied voltage, KB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and n is the ideality factor, which can be expressed as (2)
The prefactor, Js(T), is the saturation current density and is expressed by the following equation: (3)where A* is the Richardson constant (for n-GaAs, A* is theoretically estimated to be 7.56 A cm−2 K−2),4,5,24 and φSBH is the zero-bias Schottky barrier height. The inset in Fig. 3(c) shows the fitting of the linear region (from 0.04 to 0.08 V) of the ln(J)–V characteristics. The intercept and slope of the fitted curve are 7.91 and 24.24, respectively. n and φSBH are estimated to be 1.59 and 0.36 eV, respectively. The smaller Schottky barrier height in our device is probably attributed to the surface states and defects at the GaAs NW/graphene interfaces,4,25,26 as well as the shift of the graphene Fermi level induced by the charge carrier transfer.27–29 The Schottky barrier height could be further increased by applying a bias voltage on graphene or using doped graphene.30,31
The photoresponse of the device was investigated under 532 nm laser illumination. As shown in Fig. 3(d), a pronounced photovoltaic behavior can be observed, with an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.05 V, and a short-circuit current of ∼0.1 μA at a light intensity of 0.393 μW. In particular, the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current are continuously increased with an increasing illumination intensity, which has been observed in other semiconductor heterojunctions. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the short-circuit current depends linearly on the light intensity E while the open-circuit voltage depends on illumination as VOC ∼ lnE.32–36 The photoresponse performance of the device can be described by responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*), which are described as follows:5 (4) (5)where Ip and Id are the current under illumination and in the dark, respectively. E is the intensity of the incident light, A is the effective Schottky junction area of the device (length 9.8 μm × width 900 nm), and e is the charge number of an electron. Based on the measured results (Ip = 96.5 nA, Id = 5.76 nA, E = 0.393 μW at zero bias), R and D* are estimated to be 231 mA W−1 and 1.60 × 109 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively, at zero bias. Fig. 4(a) shows the dependence of the responsivity and detectivity of the device on the light intensity. It can be seen that both the responsivity and detectivity decrease with the increase of light intensity nonlinearly, which is probably attributed to the electron trapping saturation and/or limitation of hole mobility in the Schottky junction area.37,38

(f) The waveform within one cycle for estimating the rise time (τr) and fall time (τf). 
The fast “ON–OFF” switching behavior of the device was measured using a high sampling rate oscillograph under 532 nm laser pulse with various modulation frequencies ranging from 50 to 2000 Hz. From Fig. 4(b)–(e), we can see that the device exhibits good stability and reproducibility at all frequencies at zero bias. Fig. 4(f) shows the waveform within one cycle at 2000 Hz. The rise time (τr) and fall time (τf) for the device are estimated to be 85 and 118 μs, respectively.
To evaluate the photoresponse performance of the device, several key parameters of the device and other Schottky junction photodetectors are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that our device exhibits much higher responsivity in comparison with graphene/GaAs NW array photodetectors, which could be attributed to the larger unit junction area, as well as the light-concentrating effect of a single NW.40,41 The response speed of the device is comparable to that of the graphene/GaAs NW array photodetector, while being much faster than graphene/ZnO NW photodetectors. This is probably attributed to the higher carrier mobility of GaAs. The high responsivity and high speed make the device promising in self-powered ultra-fast near infrared photodetectors.

The device is also promising for solar cells. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of the device under AM 1.5 G solar illumination. A solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 94041A) with a calibrated illumination light power density of 100 mW cm−2 was used. The measured current was normalized to the effective light absorption area of the graphene/NW junction. The device exhibits an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 75.0 mV, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 425 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 27.6%, yielding a remarkable conversion efficiency (η) of 8.8%.

In addition, the graphene/GaAs NW solar cell shows excellent environmental stability over a long period (3 months). As shown in Fig. 5, the short-circuit current density (JSC) remains almost unchanged, while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) increases from 75.0 to 99.4 mV during this period. The slight increase of the open-circuit voltage might be attributed to the hole-doping of graphene by the oxygen molecules in air, which is also observed in other semiconductor/graphene heterojunctions.9,42 This phenomenon further suggests that the device performance could be further improved by using doped graphene to increase the Schottky barrier height.

Table 2 summarizes the key parameters of different types of single NW solar cells. It can be seen that the efficiency of our device is much higher than that of a GaAs core–shell p–i–n junction, which was once considered a promising solar cell structure due to the short transit time of photo-generated carriers as well as the large junction area. This is mainly attributed to the transparent property of graphene, which avoids the loss of the incident light induced by the absorption of the p (or n) shell in the core–shell p–i–n junction. The superior performance over other NW materials is attributed to the better match of the GaAs band gap and the solar spectrum.43 However, the low Schottky barrier height in our device dramatically limits the photocarrier separation rate, resulting in lower efficiency in comparison with that of the GaAs NW/Al/Au structure.44 The Schottky barrier height could be further increased by applying a bias voltage on graphene or using doped graphene in future work.30,31 Furthermore, the efficiency of our device is higher than that of an unpassivated GaAsP NW p–i–n solar cell, but lower than that of a passivated one, suggesting that surface passivation can dramatically improve the efficiency of NW solar cells.45 From Table 2 we can also find that the efficiency of a single lying NW solar cell is much lower than that of a single standing NW solar cell, which is attributed to the weak light-concentrating effect.41 Hence a standing single NW/graphene Schottky junction solar cell is believed to exhibit superior performance and requires further research in the future.
