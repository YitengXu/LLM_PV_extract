    , Accepted 3rd October 2019First published on 4th October 2019AbstractCharacterization of the structural and electronic properties of organometal halide perovskite interfaces is fundamental to fully exploit the possibilities of application of this exceptional material. First principles modelling was carried out on the composites of carbon nanostructures and methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 and MAPbI3): graphene/MAPbI3, graphene oxide/MAPbI3, C60/MAPbI3 and C60(OH)24/MAPbI3. The interfacial effects of carbon modifiers on the perovskite electronic properties, dipole moment and work function were investigated in detail to finally elucidate the photoexcitation mechanisms at these heterojunctions. We demonstrated distinct charge reorganization at all interfaces governed by the interplay of Pauli repulsion and van der Waals attraction in the case of graphene and C60, and charge transfer and electronic states hybridization in the case of GO and C60(OH)24. Graphene forms a conductive junction and greatly reduces the work function. GO is shown to behave as an excellent hole collecting material that should effectively reduce charge recombination events. Fullerenol, besides reducing the work function, was shown to be a superior electron collector over fullerene. This work contributes to clarifying the function of carbon materials as interfacial layers in optoelectronic devices based on perovskites.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have demonstrated exceptional properties boosting the photovoltaic industry in the last 10 years.1 The tremendous progress in the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency achieved in perovskite based solar cells has led to considerable interest in this material and its fundamental properties. Halide perovskites are characterized by a high optical absorption coefficient,2 large dielectric constant,3 ambipolar electron and hole transport,4 high charge carrier mobility, ultra-long diffusion lengths,5,6 and ferroelectricity.7 Moreover, compared to standard semiconductors, these superior optical and carrier transport properties are within reach with simple, low-cost, room temperature, solution processing.8 No wonder perovskites found their way to other applications including light-emitting diodes,9 photodetectors,10 phototransistors,11 thermoelectrics,12 and solid-state memories.13
This remarkable material has been used in a variety of device architectures that employed carbon nanomaterials. Graphene/graphite oxide and their modified analogs were successfully used as hole extracting electrodes14–19 and as encapsulation layers that prevented moisture degradation20 in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices. Graphene nanoflakes mixed with titanium dioxide in the electron collection layer provided superior charge-collection at low temperature.21 Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements showed much faster electron extraction in the presence of graphene quantum dots.22 Hybridizing single-layer graphene and a methylammonium lead halide perovskite for a photodetector allowed to dramatically enhance photoresponsivity and effective quantum efficiency over a broad bandwidth from the UV to visible range.23 Most recently, graphene replaced indium-tin-oxide as a transparent electrode in highly efficient and superflexible PSCs.24 Fullerene-based carbon nanomaterials have also been extensively applied in perovskite solar cells. Fullerene derivatives were demonstrated as electron acceptors at the early stage of PSC development.25,26 Not long after, employing a fullerene layer in the device architecture was shown to passivate the charge traps of perovskite thin films and to significantly suppress the undesirable current–voltage hysteresis.27–29
The broad and ongoing interest in the integration of carbon nanomaterials and perovskites in devices has already led to a number of review articles.30–33 Most definitely, employing these materials helped in solving some of the performance issues related to the perovskite-based device stability, efficiency, scalability, flexibility and costs. Regardless of whether carbon nanostructures are used as charge extractors, charge mediators, additional light sensitizers or mechanical supports, understanding the properties and processes of the interface with the perovskite is crucial in addressing the device design deficiencies. In particular, understanding the electronic alignment and, more importantly, the electronic coupling at the interface seems to be the key ingredient. The electronic coupling leads to the developed of the built-in field in the interface region which determines the mechanisms of charge injection and separation. It depends on the atomic structure of the local contact between two materials, and therefore is not easily accessible through experimental measurements. The basic knowledge of the energetic band alignment at these interfaces is already available from a number of studies. However, the mechanistic details with respect to the charge separation, recombination and collection at the interface of the perovskite light absorber and carbon nanostructure remain unresolved.
In this work, the interfaces between methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) and graphene, graphene oxide (GO), fullerene (C60) and fullerenol (C60OH24) were investigated by means of first-principles calculations. The atomic structure of interfaces and the interface formation energies were studied to determine energetically feasible configurations. The electronic properties of the emerging interface structures were analysed in detail. Density of states calculations were performed to characterize the electronic coupling of the composite components. Valence band offsets (VBO) and local band gap changes were determined. Studying Bader charges and charge density difference gave access to the details of the charge reconfiguration upon forming a contact between two materials. Furthermore, changes in the electrostatic potential at an interface were observed to determine the work function changes. Finally, energy band diagrams were constructed to elucidate photoexcitation mechanisms at each of the considered heterojunctions.
Experimental
To study the ground state atomic and electronic properties of hybrid materials, we employ density functional theory (DFT) with D3 dispersion correction,34 as implemented in the VASP package.35 We use the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)35 for the exchange–correlation energy. To describe core-valence interaction, we use Blöchl's projector augmented wave (PAW) method36,37 and a plane-wave basis with a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV. H 1s1, C 2s22p2, N 2s22p3, O2s22p4, I 5s25p5, and Pb 5d106s26p2 valence electron potentials were employed. The spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect was not taken into account in this work, as it was shown to impact mainly the empty states of Pb in the case of apolar MAPbI3 structures.38 Therefore, accurate electron density of the studied systems (provided by the occupied orbitals) could be calculated and interpreted without the inclusion of SOC. The hybrid approach of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)39 was further employed for PBE optimised geometries to improve the band gaps of 3D and 2D materials. A conjugate-gradient algorithm and blocked Davidson iteration scheme were used for ionic relaxations. After meticulous testing, we choose a Gaussian smearing function with a width of 0.1 eV for all materials and interfaces studied in this work to correctly describe electronic occupancies around the Fermi level.
Geometry optimization
The Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh used for the optimization of lattice constants of I4/mcm MAPbI3 bulk was 4 × 4 × 6 (42 irreducible k-points) and for pristine P63/mmc graphene was 14 × 14 × 1 (154 irreducible k-points). For the structural optimization of graphene sheets, a 20 Å thick vacuum layer was added and a dipole correction40 along the surface normal was employed. Electronic convergence was 10−6 eV and forces on the ions were converged to 10−5 eV Å−1. The above settings resulted in the optimized lattice parameters: a = 8.929 Å and c = 12.603 Å for MAPbI3 and a = 2.468 Å for graphene, which is in good agreement with experimental data.41,42
Here, the MAPbI3 surface is modelled by the (001) facet of the tetragonal phase with PbI2-rich flat terminations. We choose this surface, because it was shown to be one of the most stable under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions43 and it maintains the electronic characteristics of the bulk MAPbI3.44,45 The stoichiometric asymmetric slab constructed from 4 Pb layers with a determined surface energy of 12 meV Å−2 with a 4 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh (10 k-points) is adequate to simulate the MAPbI3 surface. A 25 Å thick vacuum layer is added and a dipole correction40 is used to remove artificial dipole–dipole interaction of periodic images.
Composite design
A 4 × 4 lattice expansion of graphene (30 C atoms) (graphene cell shown in blue in Fig. 1b) was used to match 1 × 1 MAPbI3Fig. 1a. The lattice mismatch was approximately 1% with the C–C bond length only marginally affected (1.40 ÷ 1.43 Å compared to 1.42 Å in the pristine graphene46). The GO model was based on the matched graphene lattice expansion with oxide group coverage adapted from Boukhvalov and Katsnelson.47 Two limiting compositions of GO were proposed: C(OH)0.25 and CO0.125(OH)0.5 to explain the experimentally determined GO formula.48,49 The study of chemical composition variations of GO in a 2 × 2 graphene cell revealed a mixed structure of one epoxy and four hydroxyls (75% oxygen coverage) as energetically the most stable configuration. In this study, we use Boukhvalov and Katsnelson's model as a building block of GO. To match the lattice vectors of MAPbI3 (shown in black in Fig. 1b), we use four such building blocks (shown in red in Fig. 1b), in which two of the blocks lack one C atom and one hydroxyl, resulting in 73% O coverage and CO0.13(OH)0.47 composition. All ions of graphene/MAPbI3 and GO/MAPbI3 composites were relaxed with a 4 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh.

GO building block is built on a 2 × 2 graphene cell (blue dashed line). Colour code: Pb in green, I in violet, C in dark grey, N in blue, H in cyan, and O in red. 
The fullerene and fullerenol hybrid structures required 2 × 2 lattice expansion of MAPbI3, a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh and a thicker vacuum layer of 35 Å. Electronic convergence in composite simulations was 10−4 eV, force convergence was 10−3 eV Å−1 and dipole correction40 in the z direction was used.
Electronic properties
For the evaluation of accurate electronic density of states (DOS), 24 × 24 × 1 and 14 × 14 × 1 dense k-point meshes were used for models utilizing 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 MAPbI3 lattice expansions, respectively. Atomic and orbital projection of the wavefunction was performed by projecting onto spherical harmonics that are non-zero within spheres of a radius around each ion. The Wigner–Seitz radii were scanned to adapt an appropriate number of electrons for each ion and finally were 2.15 Å for Pb, 2.1 Å for I, 1.02 Å for C, 1.0 Å for N, 0.7 Å for H, and 1.0 Å for O.
To show how electrons are redistributed upon interface formation, we analysed the optimized charge density of the composite structures. Bader charge analysis50 was performed to estimate the amount of charge that was transferred between the surface perovskite and the modifier. The quantitative results of the charge redistribution are obtained by calculating the charge density difference51 using eqn (1): Δρ(z) = ρ(z)composite − ρ(z)surface − ρ(z)adsorbate,(1)where ρ(z) represents the planar averaged charge densities of the composite system, MAPbI3 surface and MAPbI3 adsorbate, respectively, given by eqn (2): (2)where A is the area of the surface unit cell. The positive regions represent electron accumulation, and the negative regions indicate electron depletion. Alternating charge accumulation and depletion regions imply chemical bonding, while only the charge accumulation (depletion) region implies cation–cation (anion–anion) repulsion across a polar interface. The net charge transfer is then given by eqn (3): (3)
Using Poisson's equation, the dipole moment can also be computed from the charge density difference:52 (4)
The dipole moment as a function of z reflects the subtle electronic charge density reconfiguration at the surface interface and at the adsorbate when both are in contact. The positive value means an inward pointing dipole – an excess of negative charges on the outside and an excess of positive charges on the inside of the surface. In contrast, a negative dipole moment means an outward pointing dipole – from the negatively charged surface to the positively charged modifier. Hence, the interface dipole moment (barrier) is a predictor of the work function changes: the excess of negative (positive) charges on the outside of the surface increases (decreases) the work function.
The static charge configuration at the interface induces an electric field. Thus, the electrostatic potential in the region of an interface is determined by solving the one-dimensional Poisson equation. By integrating the charge density difference twice over the z coordinate, we obtain the change in the electrostatic potential induced by the adsorbate: (5)
Results & discussion
Structural and energetic properties of composites

Fig. 2 depicts the top and the side view of the relaxed hybrid structures. The first observation is that, energetically the most favourable is the adsorption of fullerenol (see Table S1†). We find similar adsorption energies for the remaining carbon modifiers, between −0.8 eV and −1.0 eV. Negative DFT energetics indicate a feasible adsorption process and high structural stability of all studied assemblies. Secondly, GO and C60(OH)24 adsorb with the smallest separation from the surface, around 2.5–2.8 Å. In contrast, the equilibrium adsorption distance increases for graphene, up to 3.8 Å, in agreement with a previous study.53 We do not observe any serious structural changes upon adsorption of graphene: no obvious rotation of methylammonium cations and minor variation of C–C and Pb–I bond lengths (for C–C to 1.44 Å in the hybrid system; for Pb–I from 3.11 ÷ 3.45 in pure MAPbI3 to 3.13 ÷ 3.45 in the hybrid system). In the case of GO/MAPbI3 the equilibrium distance is greatly reduced resulting in geometrical changes in the top surface Pb–I layer. Due to the randomness of the location of OH and epoxy groups at the surface of GO, local distortions are observed: elongation and shortening of the Pb–I bonds in the top surface plane as well as between the PbI and MAI layers, up to 8% of the original value. Following a previous study concerning the interaction of C60 with Zn and Cu complexes,54 the preferable position for C60 is to interact with Pb in the apex configuration via the bridge between the C–C bond connecting two hexagons (6:6 bridge apex). Upon adsorption, the first PbI layer suffers minor deformation. Specifically, the Pb adsorption center with the closest I neighbors is pushed inward towards the surface plane, while indirect I neighbors are pulled outward from the surface plane. For fullerenol, the preferable configuration is the 6:6 bridge apex with the MA channel, allowing the creation of four Pb–OH bridges with a length of around 2.8 Å which fulfill the octahedral geometry of Pb. Major structural deformations are induced at the interface and up to the second PbI layer, in this case. The rotation of MA cations in the first MAI layer and shifts of I atoms from their original positions, up and down the first PbI outermost layer and smaller shifts in the second PbI layer, can be found. The structural analysis of the studied interfaces indicates that the chemical interaction along with creating bonds takes place in the case of the C60(OH)24/MAPbI3 hybrid. The rest of the hybrids are formed upon weak physical interactions. In the next section we will take closer look at the origin of the structural deformations – electronic properties.

Electronic properties of interfaces

Graphene/MAPbI3 interface. 
To investigate the electronic properties of the graphene/MAPbI3 interface, we plot the total and atomic projected density of states (DOS) of the complex system (shown in Fig. 3a). For comparison, the DOS of free-standing components: pure surface and pure graphene are also plotted in Fig. 3b and c. We observe that the band edges of I and Pb display a significant shift towards lower energies by about 0.5 eV, which is in good agreement with a previous study.53 The electron density of the valence band maximum (VBM) delocalizes over the MAPbI3 surface outermost layer and the graphene layer (Fig. S1b†). The Dirac point is slightly shifted 0.18 eV up the Fermi level, and thus graphene becomes p-type doped by the perovskite. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the composite preserves purely, highly dispersed Pb-6p character.45 Comparing the DOS of the composite and pure counterparts, we find inconspicuous changes in the electronic states upon interaction. This suggests weak van der Waals type interaction at the interface and is consistent with the structural analysis. To further investigate the nature of interfacial interaction and possibility of charge transfer, we employed Bader charge analysis. The difference of Bader charges of MAPbI3 and graphene before and after contact points to a negligible charge transfer of ∼0.004 e from the perovskite surface to graphene, confirming the weak nature of this interaction.

(c) Total DOS of pure graphene and graphene-projected DOS of the graphene/MAPbI3 composite. Fermi level is set to 0 eV. 
To gain even deeper insight, we study electron density changes upon formation of this interface. The electron rearrangement is visualized in Fig. 4. The charge accumulation is depicted in black and charge depletion in white. From the planar-averaged charge density difference profile, Δρ(z) (Fig. 4a), we observe considerable charge reorganization. The dominating electron depletion is visible just below the graphene framework, and the electron accumulation near the perovskite top surface layer (Fig. 4b, S2a†). It can be clearly seen that electrons and holes are efficiently separated, with electrons accumulating in channels of the homogeneous hole layer, directly above the Pb atoms. Thus, considering the ionic character of MAPbI3, the Pb2+ ions attract electrons to saturate dangling bonds, while the I− ion repels electrons. More accurate analysis of the Δρ(z) profile shows also sizable electron accumulation just above the graphene framework. It seems that after the contact electron density is pushed up the graphene plane and down, closer to the perovskite surface, with ∼−0.04 e and ∼0.06 e respectively at the maximum of the net charge Q. This can be considered as an example of the so-called push-back effect: an interplay of Pauli repulsion and van der Waals attraction. As a result, a negative interface dipole moment (μ) of −1.42 D is induced and directed from the negative surface towards positive graphene, consistent with Dirac point shift, pointing to doping graphene with the semiconductor holes. Thus, the charge rearrangement (polarization effect) rather than charge transfer is responsible for the formation of this interface dipole moment.

GO/MAPbI3 interface. 
Our calculations reveal that modification of the perovskite surface with graphene oxide leads to a stronger interaction, comparing to the graphene/MAPbI3 case. Forming a contact with GO results in increased band gap energy compared to that of pure MAPbI3 by about 0.3 eV, as predicted by PBE and HSE06 methods (Table S2†). In Fig. 5 one can see that the VBM is dominated now by O-2p and C-2p hybridized states of GO with a very small contribution from I-5p (Fig. S1c†). The calculated valence band edge difference (the VB offset) between MAPbI3 and GO is −0.10 eV (Table S2†). The CBM is slightly shifted to higher energies and preserves the Pb-6p character as in the case of the graphene/MAPbI3 contact. The shape of the DOS of interacting components is altered (Fig. 5b and c), particularly the bonding I-5p and antibonding O-2p and C-2p states. Increased charge transfer is confirmed by Bader analysis suggesting that ∼0.101 e is transferred from MAPbI3 to GO.

Turning to the electron density difference analysis shown in Fig. 6, we observe that the main features of the Δρ(z) profile are rather similar to those of the graphene/MAPbI3. Interestingly, the calculated dipole moment along the z-direction is positive 1.58 D, i.e. opposite to that of the graphene/MAPbI3 complex. A positive value suggests an inward pointing dipole, i.e. from the negative adsorbate to the positive surface and supports conclusion of the population analysis. However, this rather simplistic view is in contrast with the main interface charge displacement (illustrated in Fig. S2b†), i.e. electrons accumulate at the perovskite top surface layer and deplete near the GO interfacial OH chain. From Fig. S2b† we also see that the main charge redistribution occurs along OH chains. The net charge Q shows two maxima: ∼0.06 e at the interface and ∼−0.05 e at the GO plane, showing also substantial electron displacement at the GO.

C60/MAPbI3 interface. 
The calculated results for the C60/MAPbI3 hybrid are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. The adsorption of the fullerene molecule has no significant effect on the electronic states of the perovskite surface. The band gap energy of MAPbI3 remains unchanged. To equalize the Fermi levels of these two components, the band edges of C60 shift towards lower energies by about 0.34 eV, relative to the VBM, while also retaining the same band gap energy. The VBM of this complex structure is surface-localized and mainly composed of I-5p, typical for pure perovskite, although some small charge transfer to C can be observed (Fig. S1d†). The CBM localizes in the bulk MAPbI3 and on the C60 molecule, contributed by Pb-6p and C-2p states. The electronic structure analysis is consistent with structural and energetics section conclusions pointing to a weak physisorption at this interface, sealed with 0.000 e Bader charge transfer.

(b) Charge density difference map of the C60/MAPbI3 interface. Black (white) corresponds to electron charge accumulation (depletion). Computed at the PBE-D3 level of theory. 
Nevertheless, the charge redistribution at this interface does exist and mostly takes place in the interface region. The main electron depletion occurs on the C60 side of the interface, while electrons accumulate at the perovskite surface with 0.075 e net charge Q at the maximum. Looking at the isosurfaces of charge redistribution (Fig. S2c†), electron density polarizes on the C60 molecule, with holes located closer to the interface. On the surface side, the electrons accumulate near adsorbing Pb atoms and attached I atoms and relax down the PbI skeleton. A positive dipole moment of 0.83 D is found, thus confirming the formation of the adsorption induced inward pointing dipole.


C60(OH)24/MAPbI3 interface. 
As mentioned in the previous section, at the C60(OH)24/MAPbI3 interface, Pb atoms are bonded with OH groups of the fullerenol molecule. The chemical interaction is reflected in the electronic structure of this complex system as shown in Fig. 9. The gap energy increases by 0.24 eV relative to the band gap of pristine MAPbI3. Obvious changes in the electronic states of MAPbI3 (Fig. 9b) and C60(OH)24 (Fig. 9c) are visible. The VB edge of the carbon nanostructure shifts to lower energies, as in the previous case, however with a higher offset of 0.72 eV. Therefore, the valence band maximum of this hybrid structure retains entirely the characteristics of pure perovskite (Fig. S1e†). On the other side, the conduction band minimum is again contributed by both components with Pb-6p and C-2p/O-2p states, owing to the small CBO of only −0.24 eV.

Fig. 10 shows alternating charge accumulation and depletion regions along the contact area. The isosurface plots of charge density difference (Fig. S2d†) show the charge transfer along the four Pb–OH bridges and some charge accumulation near surface I atoms connecting Pb atoms that participate in bonding. This implies chemical bonding that enhances interface stability and supports the conclusions of structural analysis. We note the highest Bader charge transfer of 0.201 e from MAPbI3 to the modifier. Thus, it seems that in this case the charge transfer causes the interface dipole with the smallest negative moment of −0.34 D.

Interface electric field. 
The specific charge configuration at each of the described interfaces induces an internal electric field. This electric field determines the carrier dynamics and can make the excitonic behaviour of heterostructures quite different from that of the isolated layers, e.g. it may facilitate the separation of electrons and holes or account for the recombination processes. The computed electrostatic potential energy profiles for the regarded heterostructures are presented in Fig. 11. The adsorption induced step-like electrostatic potential energy change is negative: −0.29 eV and −0.08 eV in the case of graphene/MAPbI3 and C60(OH)24/MAPbI3, respectively. The negative value means that the electron crossing the interface will decrease the potential energy of the system. In other words, the charge rearrangement induced electric field with an outward pointing dipole, so from the negative surface to the positive modifier, promotes electron extraction by the modifier. For GO/MAPbI3 and C60/MAPbI3 heterostructures we find the opposite, i.e. an inward pointing dipole and electrostatic potential energy jump of about 0.31 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively, block electron extraction by the modifier.

Band alignment
In order to establish the photoexcitation mechanisms for heterostructures of interest, it is necessary to determine the electronic band edge position of materials that form the interface. From the projected density of states analysis valence band offsets were obtained, by comparing the energy eigenvalues of valence band maxima of heterostructure components (Table S2†). To determine the ionization energies (IEs), for each slab model the electrostatic (Hartree) potential is computed and averaged along the z direction to define the external vacuum level (Evac). The IE is then obtained by aligning VBM eigenvalues with respect to the corresponding vacuum level: IE = Evac − EVBM.(6)In the same fashion the work functions (φ) were computed – by aligning Fermi level energy to the corresponding vacuum level: φ = Evac − EF.(7)The diagrams of the alignment procedure of work functions along with local electrostatic potentials for all interfaces can be found in Fig. S3.† Computed ionization energies and work functions for pure components and heterostructures are collected in Table S4.†
Obtained from the electrostatic potential analysis vacuum energy shifts (Fig. S3†), and hence IE shifts (Table S4†), are consistent with the sign of the calculated dipole moments (Table S3†). Therefore, it is clear that the main contribution to the band shifts comes from the interface dipoles. And so, negative interface dipoles indicate a decrease of the work function for graphene and C60OH24 heterojunctions and positive dipoles increase the work function in the case of GO and C60. Coating MAPbI3 with 2D materials, such as graphene and GO, leads to significant surface dipoles and therefore substantial changes in the IEs, which is an important factor for the optoelectronic device design. It must be noted, however, that the specific GO structure, which was applied here, possesses an intrinsic dipole moment (see Fig. S3b†), which pointing inward also contributes to the work function increase. Thus, the found IE of 6.4 eV for this heterojunction, which is quite large for solar absorbers, might be overestimated. The work function and IE remain almost unaffected or moderately affected at the here considered low coverages of molecular modifiers C60 and C60OH24. This is a standard situation for such interfaces where significant charge transfer does not occur.55 The situation corresponding to the realistic coverage might be different however due to effects such as geometry relaxation, dielectric screening and a possibility of collective electrostatic effects.55 Therefore, a dedicated study to anticipate the impact of the coverage density on the interface dipole, work function and vacuum potential change is necessary. Nevertheless, presented electronic coupling is valid at the local contact area.
Next, for the construction of band diagrams, electron affinities (EAs) are evaluated using EA = IE + Eg.(8)The last value leads us to the conduction band offsets (CBO) computed as the difference in the EAs of heterostructure components, Table S4.† We use PBE band gap energies in the case of molecules (C60 and C60(OH)24), while HSE06 corrected band gap energies for surface structures (pure MAPbI3 and all heterostructures) and pure 2D materials (GO).

In general, PBE underestimates the band gaps of 3D and 2D structures, but gives good results for 1D molecules. In the case of the bulk MAPbI3, PBE fortuitously delivers band gap energy due to the cancellation between the gap underestimation error and the neglect of SOC.56 The derived Eg for the studied bulk MAPbI3 of 1.74 eV is in agreement with the experimental optical band gap that, depending on reports, varies from 1.5 eV to 1.7 eV.57,58 However, in the case of the surface model, Eg of 0.6 eV is noticeably smaller. Employing the HSE06 functional increases the surface band gap energy and gives an acceptable estimate of around 1.1 eV. Similarly to the case of GO, HSE06 widens the band gap from 2.3 eV to 3.8 eV and good agreement is found with the typically reported 2.3–4.3 eV experimental gap.59,60 The PBE functional reproduces the optical band gap of fullerene which is 1.7–1.9 eV61,62 and gives similar results to other computational studies for the fullerenol molecule.63 We also observe the same trends in the band gaps of heterostructures calculated with PBE and HSE06 (Table S2†). At the PBE level of computations, we find fairly close agreement of the obtained IEs of pure components with existing experimental values, and very good agreement with other reported computations.26,57,64–67
From this analysis, the band offset class will be assigned in the next section, to distinguish between the cases of charge confinement (‘straddling’, type I), charge separation (‘staggered’, type II), or a conductive junction (‘broken gap’, type III). However, we note that the determined band alignment with standard DFT methods, especially the band edges positions of MAPbI3, is not accurate, and thus more demanding calculations would be necessary. Apart from rather qualitative, but still informative, band shifts obtained with the employed DFT, additional inaccuracy is associated with the “plastic” structure of MAPbI368 exhibiting ferroelectricity.7 The polar organic cation (the molecular dipole of MA is 2.3 D7) is able to rotate at room temperature changing the structure of the inorganic framework.69 Thus, although the MA cation does not contribute to the Frontier orbitals, the dynamic structural distortions, caused by random70 or collective71 MA orientation, have been shown to influence the electronic and the optical properties. Quatri et al.38 demonstrated that at room temperature a variety of apolar (antiferroelectric) as well as polar (ferroelectric) MA dipole configurations are accessible, where the latter gives rise to a strong band bending. Therefore, the presented band alignment of heterostructures of representative static apolar MAPbI3 can be potentially different in the case of polarized surface but this is beyond the current scope. Finally, it must be noted that different surface termination, than the investigated PbI2-rich flat termination, as well as different surface orientation, change the interfacial structure and thus the interface dipole and the band shift. Having in mind these considerations, the photoexcitation mechanisms at the heterojunctions are discussed in the next section. The schemes of the energy band edge positions are depicted in Fig. 12.

Photoexcitation mechanisms
The work functions of MAPbI3 and graphene were found to be 5.59 eV and 4.20 eV, respectively (Table S4†). The charge displacement at this heterojunction is generalized, also in a previous study,53 by work function equalization, resulting in a hybrid work function in between its components (4.45 eV). Furthermore, coating MAPbI3 with graphene caused the biggest change in the perovskite work function – its reduction by −1.14 eV. The work function is associated with the quantum efficiency of the photosensitive device.72,73 Low quantum efficiency originates mainly from a too large work function. It is thus expected that graphene coating will lead to the enhancement of the quantum efficiency of MAPbI3-based photosensitive devices. In fact, a recent study showed that a graphene–MAPbI3 hybrid photodetector features high-performance with large photocurrent and ultrahigh quantum efficiency.23 Here, we prove that it can be attributed to the decreased work function and distinct charge reorganization at this interface. The generated electric field, by the outward pointing interface dipole, is favourable for the injection of photo-excited electrons into the graphene conduction band, Fig. 12a. Very efficient electron injection can be achieved, as indicated by the negative electrostatic potential energy change (Fig. 11). Our findings may explain faster electron extraction in perovskite solar cells observed in the presence of graphene quantum dots.22 In addition, due to the direction of the internal electric field, the recombination path from the graphene CB to the perovskite VB is prohibited. Therefore, the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes is achieved, prolonging their lifetime. The formed heterojunction is a type III conductive junction. The beneficial role of the graphene overlayer on MAPbI3, this time in terms of MAPbI3 stability, was elucidated in other work.53
For the GO/MAPbI3 hybrid we note an increase in the work function by 0.35 eV (Table S4†) and in the band gap (Table S2†), due to the chemical as well as the physical interaction. The outstanding charge transport between GO and perovskite was shown earlier in a photoluminescence quenching study16 and is supported by our electronic structure calculations. Graphene oxide induces a positive dipole moment and reverses the electric field at this interface, now directed from the positive surface to the negative modifier, Fig. 12b. The calculated −0.1 eV VBO and an insulating band gap of GO imply a type II ‘staggered’ heterojunction, characteristic of the charge separation structure. Under illumination, electrons are excited to the CB of the perovskite, producing holes in the VB. A favourable VBO, built-in electric field and positive electrostatic energy jump accelerate hole extraction by the GO. At the same time, electrons are rejected back from the VB, thereby reducing the recombination process. Charges were effectively separated owing to the GO hole extraction ability and effective blocking of electrons. It has been shown that efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells can be fabricated using GO as a hole conductor.16,17,19 Although some drawbacks in using GO as a hole transporting layer (HTL) are present, e.g. rather poor electrical conductivity, a high degree of oxygen content on the surface74 or the dependency of device performance on the GO thickness,16 it is a cost-effective alternative to PEDOT:PSS – conventionally used as the HTL.67,74 Besides the advantage of the simple solution and room temperature processing of GO, it facilitates the growth of crystalline MAPbI3 and increases the stability of the device.17 Perovskite devices employing GO also showed no hysteresis in forward and reverse scan directions, implying efficient hole extraction and balanced electron and hole transport.19
Functionalization of MAPbI3 with fullerene and fullerenol causes smaller changes in the work function, compared to graphene and GO. We note a slight increase by 0.09 eV in the case of fullerene and a drop by 0.18 eV in the case of fullerenol, suggesting higher quantum efficiency of the system employing the latter modifier. Another advantage of fullerenol is that it binds strongly with the surface perovskite, securing the interface stability, as mentioned above. The energy diagrams for C60/MAPbI3 and C60(OH)24/MAPbI3 are depicted in Fig. 12c and d. Due to the closely aligned CBs, both heterojunctions are between type I – charge confinement structure and type II – charge separation structure. However, because of the still underestimated band gap of MAPbI3, even though HSE06 corrected, we can conclude type II heterojunctions. Therefore, the optical gap is controlled by the perovskite electronic states on the VB side and mainly by the carbon modifier electronic states on the CB side (Fig. S1d and e†). Upon photon absorption electron–hole pairs are created and thermalize to their respective band edges. The induced electric field at these heterojunctions is of the opposite direction, thus fullerene derivatives function differently. When C60 is employed, photoexcited electrons have very small energy barrier for the injection into the conduction band of MAPbI3. The excess electrons and holes are also prone to recombination events, which is a consequence of the interface dipole moment direction. Though fullerenes were repeatedly reported to passivate traps and to reduce current hysteresis,27–29 a fullerene monolayer in a specific mesoporous structure was found to act as an electron reservoir being able to trap and exchange electrons between own LUMO level and perovskite conduction band.25 This ambivalent functioning can be understood in terms of the dynamics of opposed processes taking place: built in electric field driven electron injection to the perovskite CB vs. electron collection from the C60 LUMO to an electrode. Conversely, when fullerenol is in use, excitons are efficiently separated through spontaneous injection of the photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of C60(OH)24. Fullerenes have been successfully used as electron acceptors in planar heterojunction devices26,75 and their various applications in the perovskite solar cells have been revealed.31,32 Nevertheless, the elucidated advantages of fullerenol hybrids were indicated recently.76 The insertion of a single fullerenol layer was shown to improve the electron transportation and power conversion efficiencies comparing to C60-based solar cells. High crystallinity of the perovskite film and reduced interfacial resistance, but a moderate decrease in hysteresis were observed. The reasons for these enhancements are as follows: increased surface stability, lower work function, and electronic properties of this interface that promote the exciton separation and block the recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the structural and electronic properties of hybrid carbon/perovskite nanomaterials: graphene/MAPbI3, GO/MAPbI3, C60/MAPbI3, and C60(OH)24/MAPbI3 to unravel their interface characteristics. The negative adsorption energies indicate high structural stability of all studied hybrids. The most stable interface is obtained when functionalizing the PbI2-rich MAPbI3 surface with fullerenol. We have observed distinct charge reorganization at all interfaces governed by the interplay of Pauli repulsion and van der Waals attraction in the case of graphene and C60 and charge transfer and electronic state hybridization in the case of GO and C60(OH)24. The density of states analysis provided information on the valence band offsets at heterojunctions and on the band gap widening for interfaces with GO and C60(OH)24. Together with the estimated changes in the electrostatic potential towards the interface, changes of the dipole moment and the work function were used to elucidate the photoexcitation mechanisms at these heterojunctions. We showed that upon contact with a halide perovskite, carbon modifiers form various types of heterojunctions. Graphene forms a conductive junction and greatly reduces the work function. GO is shown to behave as an excellent hole collecting material that should effectively reduce charge recombination events. Fullerenol, besides reducing the work function, was shown to be a superior electron collector over fullerene. This study provides guidelines for optimum interface engineering for optoelectronic devices based on perovskite materials functionalized with carbon nanostructures.
