    , Accepted 4th October 2020First published on 5th October 2020AbstractResearch on alkylbenzene side-chain engineering of acceptors, which can affect the crystallinity of molecules and packing orientations of blend films, has deeply promoted the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this contribution, we developed two novel small-molecule electron acceptors C4 and C6. They exhibit similar optical (an absorption edge reaching 900 nm) and electrochemical properties (narrow band gap, Eg ≈ 1.55 eV), but their photovoltaic properties are quite different. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of C6-based OSCs is 14.54% (VOC = 0.84 V, JSC = 23.82 mA cm−2, and FF = 72.68%), which is much higher than that of the C4-based control device (7.28%). The difference of PCE is because C6 shows excellent compatibility with the polymer donor PM6. The subtle change of the alkylbenzene side chain is found to have a great impact on the blend film morphology. Compared to PM6:C4 blend films, PM6:C6 blend films exhibit a smaller π–π stacking d-spacing (3.61 Å) and larger coherence length (CCL = 17.7 Å), which is beneficial to promote charge transfer, further affecting the PCE of OSCs. Notably, devices based on PM6:C6 can achieve 14.54% efficiency, which is one of the best efficiencies of annealing-free OSCs (AF-OSCs). In reality, AF-OSCs relatively simplify the device manufacturing process compared to annealed cells, manifesting remarkable application potential in the future.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of an electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) are considered an emerging technology for energy-harvesting.1–8 OSCs have some merits such as light weight, flexibility, large-area processing and solution-processability.9–12 As for materials, acceptors have played a vital role in the development of high-efficiency OSCs over the past few years. At the beginning of OSC development, fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM, PC71BM and ICBM) were widely applied in OSCs generating a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11%.13–15 In 2015, Zhan and his co-workers first reported an A–D–A type small-molecular acceptor (SMA) and up to now binary OSCs have yielded a PCE over 14%.10,16–19 In 2019, Zou's group gave an account of an A–DAD–A type SMA achieving 15.7% efficiency.20 So far, OSCs containing A–DAD–A type SMAs and polymer donors have produced over 17% efficiency.21,22 Compared to fullerene derivatives, non-fullerene SMAs have a lot of advantages, such as synthetic flexibility, adjustable energy levels and strong absorption in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra, promoting the achievement of high performance organic solar cells.23–28
With the evolution of non-fullerene acceptors, much effort has been devoted to developing new fused-ring cores, electron-withdrawing end groups, π-bridges and side-chains, which can effectively tune the energy level and absorption of SMAs.16,18,27,29,30 In fact, the modification of side chains has played an important role in the development of OSCs.31–34 In general, a subtle change in a side-chain, such as the length and position of an alkyl chain, and the dimension of the side-chain, can significantly affect molecular packing and orientation, which provides an intuitive approach to examine the relationship between the subtle change of the structure and performance.20,24,34 Before 2019, researchers paid more attention to the modification of the side-chain of an indacenodithiophene (IDT) series acceptor. In 2016, Zhan's group reported two acceptors with different side-chains, and changing the side-chains in IC-1IDT-IC from alkylphenyl to alkyl enhanced the PCE from 7.39% to 9.20%.35,36 In 2019, Yang's group introduced a phenyl to the tail of an alkyl side-chain achieving over 14% efficiency.33 The same year, Zou's group reported a novel electron acceptor Y6 yielding 15.7% efficiency.20,37 Since then, researchers have put more effort on the modification of the Y6 side chain. Yan and his co-workers demonstrated a new compound named N3 as an acceptor achieving 15.98% efficiency.24 Our group designed and synthesized an acceptor BTP-4F-12 showing the best PCE of 16.4% with the polymer donor PM6.34 We know that the steric hindrance, orientation, and position of alkyl chains can have a remarkable influence on the solubility, aggregation, and optical and electronic properties of the small molecules, improving the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) accordingly, thus affecting the photovoltaic performances of OSCs.24,32,38–41
Although these small molecular acceptors have achieved very high efficiency in OSCs, there are still many challenges when applied from a laboratory to industrial applications.42 For example, in order to achieve a suitable morphology, OSCs require extra treatments such as thermal annealing (TA) and/or solvent vapour annealing (SVA).42–45 However, the high temperature of TA might cause oxidation or degradation of the functional layer. Furthermore, SVA is greatly affected by factors such as the device position, solvent usage, evaporation rate, etc., so the reproducibility of devices is poor.43,46,47 Hence, SVA is not good for practical applications. At present, annealing-free OSCs (AF-OSCs) yield efficiencies around 13%;48,49 therefore, it is still crucial to develop novel donor/acceptor (D/A) combinations to realize highly efficient AF-OSCs which are suitable for industrial applications.
In this work, two novel SMAs named C4 and C6 are designed and synthesized, with 4-phenylbutyl and 6-phenylhexyl side-chains attached to the central fused ring dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT), and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the end group. The alkyl group in the side chain can ensure that the molecule has good crystallinity and close molecular stacking, and the longer alkyl chain can also promote the compatibility with the donor. The bulky phenyl in the side-chain can reduce crystallinity and avoid excessive aggregation, increasing the miscibility with donor materials. We compare the photoelectrical properties and device performance of these two SMAs. The two SMAs show wide and strong absorption in the visible-NIR spectra, and C6 exhibits redshifted and stronger absorption and higher electron mobility relative to C4. They have similar lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. When blended with polymer donor PM6, the annealing-free blend films of PM6:C6 exhibit a smaller π–π stacking d-spacing (3.61 Å) and larger crystal coherence lengths (CCL = 17.7 Å), which promote the charge transfer. Hence the OSCs based on blends of C6 and PM6 show a much higher VOC, JSC and FF relative to C4-based devices, which shows that C6-based devices have a higher PCE of 14.54% than C4-based devices (7.28%).
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The C4 and C6 synthesis routes are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and tributyl(6-undecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane were chosen as starting materials. They are catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 to obtain compound 3 through a Stille coupling reaction in a yield of 91%. In the following, compound 3 was dissolved in dry 1,2-dichlorobenzene and reacted with PPh3 under reflux for 48 h. The crude product without further purification was dissolved in DMF and reacted with 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (or 1-bromo-6-phenylhexane), KI, and K2CO3 to obtain compound 4 (or 5). The yield in these two steps is 32%. Then the treatment of compound 4 (or 5) with POCl3 and DMF formed an ammonium intermediate, which was quenched using cold sodium hydroxide solution to produce dialdehyde compound 6 (or 7) in a yield of 76%. The target compound C4 or C6 was obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile and compound 6 (or 7) in a yield of 86%. These compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The visible-NIR absorptions of C4 and C6 at room temperature were examined in both dilute chloroform solution and thin films (Fig. 1b). In film, C4 and C6 exhibit a strong absorption from 600 to 900 nm. But C6 has a wider absorption than C4. The maximum extinction coefficients are calculated to be 1.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 733 nm for C4 and 1.75 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 732 nm for C6. Compared to C4, C6 exhibits a higher εmax value of ca. 19.0%, indicating more efficient intramolecular charge transfer, thus affecting the light absorption ability. We found an obvious red shift of about 75 nm from the solution to the thin film, suggesting that there is strong aggregation of the molecular backbone and π–π interactions in the solid state.50 The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of C4 and C6 was obtained from the absorption edge of the thin film. According to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset, the Eoptg of C4 and C6 is 1.39 eV and 1.37 eV, respectively.

We also conducted theoretical calculations to evaluate frontier molecular orbitals of C4 and C6. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. To simplify calculations, the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S3,† these two acceptors show similar wave function distributions in frontier orbitals. For example, the electron density of the HOMO is mainly localized on the donor segment but the electron density of the LUMO delocalized on the whole backbones, which promotes the charge transfer. The energy levels of the two SMAs were estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 1c). The onset oxidation/reduction potentials (ϕox/ϕred) for C4 and C6 are 0.80 eV/−0.75 eV, 0.78 eV/−0.74 eV versus Fc/Fc+, respectively. According to the formula HOMO = −(ϕox + 4.80) eV and LUMO = −(ϕred + 4.80) eV, the HOMO/LUMO of C4 and C6 are determined to be −5.60 eV/−4.05 eV and −5.58 eV/−4.06 eV, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO levels obtained from CV are in good agreement with the results of theoretical calculations.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic characteristics of the C4-based and C6-based OSCs, PM6 was chosen as the polymer donor owing to the complementary absorption and well-matched energy level. As shown in Fig. 2a, we fabricate OSCs with the structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 4083)/active layer/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. The active layer was spin-coated from the chloroform solution with an optimized D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2 with a total concentration of 16 mg ml−1. Additives were added to obtain the appropriate morphology, and the optimized condition is 0.5% chloronaphthalene (CN) of the solution. The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are presented in Fig. 2c and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices are listed in Table 2. The annealing-free devices based on PM6:C6 yielded the best PCE of 14.54% with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 23.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.68%, which is approximately 100% higher than that of the C4-based control annealing-free devices (a VOC of 0.689 V, a JSC of 15.74 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.01%). The histograms of PCE counts for 10 individual devices based on optimal annealing-free PM6:C6 devices are shown in Fig. S4.† As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1,† the performance of C6-based devices was slightly reduced after low temperature annealing. When the annealing temperature reaches 100 °C, the VOC and FF of the device were significantly decreased, resulting in a low PCE 13.58% with a VOC of 0.804 V, a JSC of 25.11 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.25%. The annealing-free device based on the Y6 acceptor without a benzene unit in the side chain exhibits an efficiency of 14.70% (see Fig. S7†), which may be due to the well-balanced crystallinity and miscibility of the side chain branched structure. Furthermore, the stabilities of optimal PM6:C6 devices without encapsulation were also investigated. The unencapsulated OSCs showed a good stability stored in a glove box, where the PCE still retained about 90% of its original efficiency after 150 h (see in Fig. S6†). According to the formula Eloss = Eg − eVOC, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor and acceptor, and the photon energy loss (Eloss) of the C4-based device is determined to be 0.701 eV which is relatively larger than that of C6-based OSCs (0.530 eV).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out to figure out the difference of JSC between C4-based OSCs and C6-based OSCs. As shown in Fig. 2d, the EQE of C6-based OSCs showed wider and stronger photon responses (over 60% of EQE values across the range 400–830 nm) with a maximum EQE value of 84% at 550 nm, indicating more efficient charge generation and collection in C6-based OSCs. The JSC of C4-based and C6-based OSCs without annealing calculated from the EQE curve is 15.50 mA cm−2 and 23.22 mA cm−2, respectively. The EQE response of C4-based and C6-based OSCs becomes wider after thermal annealing indicating the tighter packing of the blend film, and the calculation results of JSC from the corresponding EQE curve are 15.99 mA cm−2 and 24.50 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the measurement obtained from the J–V curve within 5% error.
To evaluate the charge recombination processes in the binary OSCs, light intensity (P) versus JSC and VOC was plotted. The correlation between JSC and Plight can be described as JSC ∝ Plightα, where α is an indicator of the degree of bimolecular recombination. As the value of α becomes closer to 1, the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible.51Fig. 2e illustrates that the fitted α values for the C6-based OSCs with and without annealing are 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. The α values for annealing-free cells are close to 1, which is consistent with the performances of the devices. In contrast, the C4-based devices without annealing exhibit a relatively low value of 0.86, and the bimolecular recombination was obviously reduced after thermal annealing (α value is 0.93). The results indicate that the C4-based devices have a greater degree of bimolecular recombination, which is due to the stronger crystallinity of the non-fullerene acceptors with shorter alkylbenzene side chains resulting in poor miscibility. Fig. 2f shows the relationship between the light intensity and VOC. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of Plight can reflect the types of charge recombinations in the device.52 Usually, the slope is close to kT/q when bimolecular recombination is dominant in the device, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. But when the monomolecular recombination (trap-assisted recombination) dominates, the slope will be close to 2kT/q.53,54 Monomolecular recombination (trap-assisted recombination) refers to the annihilation of bonding hole–electron pairs, which is attributed to the trap states or recombination centers due to the morphological traps or interfacial defects. Generally, increased monomolecular recombination in a system can lead to a significantly reduced injection and poor device performance. The slope was calculated to be 1.46kT/q and 1.28kT/q for C6-based cells with and without annealing, respectively. This implied that monomolecular recombination originating from traps and defects was very weak in the annealing-free C6-based devices, whereas the bimolecular recombination dominated. In contrast, the C4-based device exhibits a larger slope value, 1.66kT/q for annealing-free cells and 1.88kT/q for annealed cells, indicating that monomolecular recombination dominates C4-based OSCs resulting in poor photovoltaic performance.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWXAS) was performed to explore the crystallinity, molecular packing orientation and microstructure of the pristine and blend films. Fig. 3 and S8† show the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the three pristine and PM6:C4 (annealing-free), PM6:C4 (annealing), PM6:C6 (annealing-free) and PM6:C6 (annealing) blend films, respectively. As shown in Fig. S8,† the PM6 pristine films show a (010) π–π stacking peak predominantly in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, manifesting face-on preferences. The C4 and C6 pristine films exhibit a (010) π–π stacking peak mainly in the in-plane (IP) direction, which corresponds to a preferable edge-on packing orientation. We found that both (010) peaks in IP and (100) peaks in the OOP directions became sharper and intensified for the C4 pristine films, indicating that C4 possesses enhanced crystallinity properties in comparison with C6. As shown in Fig. 3, it was clear that the features of the blends were dominated by the PM6 donor polymer. The annealing-free PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films display a strong diffraction peak in the OOP direction at q = 1.72 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.65 Å) and q = 1.74 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.61 Å), respectively; in the in plane (IP) orientation, both annealing-free PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films exhibit a strong (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1, corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 20.94 Å. This suggests that the annealing-free blend PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 films prefer a face-on packing orientation, which is beneficial to the charge transport in the device. The C4-based blend films exhibit a relatively weak face-on orientation compared with C6-based blend films, which may be due to the stronger edge-on orientation of C4 pristine films. The calculation results of the CCL for annealing-free PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films, according to the Scherrer equation,55,56 are 15.7 Å and 17.7 Å, respectively. Compared to that of annealing-free PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films, the face-on packing orientation of thermally annealed PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films is enhanced, the d-spacing of π–π stacking is 3.61 Å and 3.55 Å, respectively, and the CCL of π–π stacking is 12.9 Å and 20.2 Å, respectively. The results are summarized in Table S2.† Generally, more favourable face-on orientation, and reduced π–π stacking and lamellar stacking with an enlarged coherence length are beneficial for the charge transport and JSC, which are consistent with the results of the J–V curve.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to investigate the surface morphology of PM6:C4 and PM6:C6 blend films. As shown in Fig. 4, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the annealing-free blend film (Rq = 0.79 nm) is slightly lower compared with the 0.86 nm of the annealed PM6:C6 films. The C6-based blend films presented uniform and well distributed film morphologies, indicating good miscibility with the donor (PM6), which are consistent with the performances of the devices. The values of the RMS roughness of PM6:C4 with and without annealing are 1.07 nm and 1.13 nm, respectively, due to the stronger crystallinity of the C4 with shorter alkylbenzene side chains resulting in poor miscibility. All the morphology images exhibit interpenetrating fibre-like networks (see the AFM phase images), which are favourable for hole and electron transport.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two new acceptor materials, C4 and C6, with an alkylbenzene side chain on the TPBT core. They show similar absorption spectra and energy levels. By employing PM6 as the donor, devices based on annealing-free PM6:C6 exhibit the best PCE of 14.54% with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 23.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.68% while devices based on annealing-free PM6:C4 exhibit the best PCE of 7.28% with a VOC of 0.689 V, a JSC of 15.74 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.01%. Benefiting from wider and stronger photon responses, the devices based on PM6:C6 have more efficient charge generation and collection. The crystallinity and miscibility of SMAs are well balanced through the adjustment of alkylbenzene side chains, resulting in PM6:C6-based devices with less molecular reorganization and a better morphology, which provides an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
