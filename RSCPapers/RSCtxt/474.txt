    , Accepted 30th September 2018First published on 1st October 2018AbstractCobalt oxide (Co3O4) has been extensively utilized as a promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst for solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the relationship between its oxygen vacancies and PEC conversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Herein, we demonstrate a rapid and highly efficient strategy for rationally constructing oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 cocatalysts by Ar-plasma treatment, which could significantly enhance the PEC water oxidation reactivity of TiO2-based photoanodes. The photocurrent density could be achieved up to 2.5 mA cm−2 (1.23 VRHE) under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), up to 2 times higher than that of the untreated Co3O4/TiO2 samples. More specifically, the oxygen vacancy formation on Co3O4 cocatalysts not only facilitates the hole trapping ability for promoting interfacial charge separation and migration, but also provides more active sites for water oxidation. The rapid and highly efficient activation of OER cocatalysts by producing oxygen vacancies may be potentially a universal strategy for improving the photo-conversion efficiency of PEC photoanodes now available.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising route for producing clean and renewable hydrogen fuels by utilizing the abundant solar energy.1–3 Transition-metal oxides, in particular TiO2,4,5 Fe2O3,6,7 and WO3,8,9 have been regarded as promising photoanode materials for PEC water splitting owing to their low cost and photo-stability. However, photoanodes usually suffered from the poor charge carrier mobility and sluggish kinetic barriers for surface water oxidation, which greatly limited their photo-conversion efficiencies. During the past few decades, diverse strategies, including doping, nanostructuring, and formation of hetero-junctions, have been extensively employed to alleviate the charge mobility, lifetime and kinetics issues for achieving the improved PEC performances. For instance, the charge separation can be effectively promoted by the construction of WO3/BiVO4 hetero-junctions with matched band-edge positions.10,11 The rational construction of branched Fe2O3 nanoplates with improved charge transport could effectively improve the PEC activity for water oxidation.12 Additionally, the Sn-doping could significantly enhance the higher PEC activity of TiO2 photoanodes.13 Although these approaches could improve the capability of charge separation and transport, the intrinsically sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface barriers is still inherent in the present photoanodes.
Recently, the decoration of oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) cocatalysts, such as Co–Pi, FeOOH, and NiOOH, on the photoanodes has been extensively proved to be an effective approach to accelerate interfacial charge separation and enhance surface water oxidation.14–17 More specifically, the photo-generated holes could be effectively extracted from the photoanodes to the OER cocatalyst for water oxidation by reducing kinetic barriers. For example, Chang et al. demonstrated that the loading of p-Co3O4 particles on BiVO4 photoanodes promoted simultaneous enhancement of surface reaction kinetics and bulk charge separation.18 Chen et al. reported that the modification of CoOx on Ta3N5 photoanodes enhanced the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for water oxidation.19 However, the surface active sites on OER cocatalysts have been rarely concerned until now, which should also be an important consideration to determine the PEC efficiency. Less active sites may hamper the rapid hole trapping and introduce more surface recombination centers that may need an additional driving force for the water oxidation. In the case of electrocatalytic water oxidation, creating oxygen vacancies can significantly improve catalytic reactivity for the OER owing to the greater number of surface active sites.20,21 More specifically, introducing oxygen vacancies into OER catalysts not only decreases the coordination number of neighboring catalytic sites, but also regulates the surface electronic structure, which in turn influences the intrinsic OER activity. Therefore, the construction of oxygen vacancies on OER cocatalysts could induce more active sites and outward driving forces for water oxidation.
Herein, Ar-plasma treatment has been demonstrated to be a rapid and highly efficient strategy for activating Co3O4 cocatalysts with oxygen vacancies, which could significantly improve the PEC water oxidation reactivity of TiO2 photoanodes. After 2 min of treatment, the Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode exhibits an excellent photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte under AM 1.5G solar irradiation, approximately 2-fold higher than that of untreated samples. Moreover, the number of oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 cocatalyst could be rationally modulated by adjusting the reaction time and gas species, and the PEC performances have been correspondingly changed, further confirming the crucial roles of oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 cocatalyst in promoting the PEC water oxidation activity. More importantly, this strategy could also be applied in other photoanodes for enhancing the surface reactivity for water oxidation.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of a rutile TiO2 electrode
TiO2 nanorods on a FTO glass substrate were prepared by a modified hydrothermal process. In brief, 0.4 mL of C16H36O4Ti was added to 30 mL of a HCl aqueous solution (15 mL of hydrochloric acid and 15 mL of deionized water) and continuously stirred for 30 min. Then, the obtained Ti-based solution was transferred into a 50 mL autoclave with a piece of the FTO substrate. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 423 K for 15 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the resulting electrode was washed with DI water and dried with N2. Finally, the electrode was heat treated at 773 K for 60 min.
2.2 Preparation of BiVO4 electrodes
Firstly, BiOI films were deposited on a FTO substrate. In brief, a Bi-based solution was prepared by dissolving 0.98 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in 50 mL of a 0.4 M KI solution after its pH was adjusted to 1.7 by adding HNO3. This solution was added to 20 mL of ethanol containing 0.23 M 1,4-benzoquinone and was stirred for 30 min. The electrodeposition process was carried out in a typical three-electrode cell. A FTO (1 × 1.5 cm2) working electrode, a Pt foil counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) reference electrode were used. Cathodic deposition was performed at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for a few minutes, which was equivalent to passing a total charge of 0.4C. Secondly, BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by placing 0.2 mL of a DMSO solution containing 0.2 M VO(acac)2 on the BiOI films, followed by heating in a muffle furnace at 723 K for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the electrodes were soaked in 1 M NaOH solution for 30 min to remove the excess V2O5 present in the BiVO4 films. The obtained pure BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in ambient air.
2.3 Preparation of Fe2O3 electrodes
Fe2O3 electrodes were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. 20 mL of 0.15 M FeCl3·H2O and 1 M NaNO3 (the pH value was adjusted to 1.25 with HCl) were added to a 50 mL hydrothermal reactor with a piece of FTO, and the reaction is conducted for 4 h at 368 K. Yellow β-FeOOH was attached on FTO. Then, the β-FeOOH was cleaned with deionized water and subsequently annealed at 873 K for 1 h and at 1023 K for 20 min; the Fe2O3 photoanode was obtained.
2.4 Preparation of Co3O4/TiO2 photoanodes
Co3O4 nanoparticles were decorated on TiO2 nanorods by a hydrothermal deposition method. More specifically, 5 mM Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O was dissolved in 30 mL C2H5OH, followed by adding 0.45 mL of NH3·H2O to the above solution under vigorous stirring. The as-prepared TiO2 photoanode was placed in a 50 mL autoclave, and then the Co-based solution was poured into the autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 393 K for 1 h. After the reactor cooled to room temperature naturally, the obtained sample was washed with deionized water and dried with N2, and the precipitate in the autoclave was collected for XRD characterization. For Co3O4/BiVO4 and Co3O4/Fe2O3 electrodes, the Co3O4 nanoparticles were decorated by the same aforementioned hydrothermal deposition method.
2.5 Preparation of Ar-plasma engraved Co3O4/TiO2 and O-plasma filled Ar/Co3O4/TiO2 photoanodes
The sample of Co3O4/TiO2 was horizontally placed in the cavity of a plasma generator (Harrick Plasma, PDC-001 with a power of 30 W) and then treated with Ar plasma for different bombardment times (60 s, 120 s, and 300 s) to get the engraved samples of Ar–Co3O4/TiO2-60 s, Ar–Co3O4/TiO2-120 s, and Ar–Co3O4/TiO2-300 s. The pressure of the cavity is about 300 mTorr. The optimal Ar-plasma treatment time is 120 s. For comparison, pristine TiO2 was also treated under the same Ar-plasma conditions for 120 s. The Ar-plasma engraved sample of Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 was treated with O plasma for different times (120 s, 300 s, and 600 s) under the same pressure. The corresponding samples were named O–Ar/Co3O4/TiO2-120 s, O–Ar/Co3O4/TiO2, and O–Ar/Co3O4/TiO2-600 s, respectively. Ar-plasma treated Co3O4/BiVO4 and Co3O4/Fe2O3 photoanodes were obtained under the same Ar-plasma conditions (300 mTorr, 120 s).
2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements
A standard three-electrode configuration was used to measure the photoelectrochemical properties. Pt foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The as-prepared samples were used as the working electrode (area is 1 cm2). All the PEC performances were determined in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte which was bubbled with N2 for 0.5 h prior to measurement. An optical-fibre light source (FX300, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd) was employed as the illumination source to simulate sunlight, and the spectral range is between 350 nm and 800 nm. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a Dual Channel Bench Power and Energy Meters Console (PM320E, THORLABS) equipped with a standard thermal power probe (S310C, THORLABS). The obtained potentials versus SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by using the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.24 V + 0.0591 × pH. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. An amperometric i–t curve was obtained at a bias voltage of 1.23 VRHE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at 1.23 VRHE in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz under dark conditions. The incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was detected with a full solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600, 300 W Xe arc lamp) equipped with a motorized monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). The values of IPCE were measured at 1.23 VRHE in 0.1 M NaOH by using the above mentioned three-electrode system. The IPCE was calculated using the following equation: IPCE (%) = (1240 × I)/(Plight × λ) × 100 where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and Plight is the measured light power density at this wavelength. The applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated using the following equation: ABPE (%) = Jp × (1.23 − |Vb|)/P where Jp is the photocurrent density at the potential Vb, and P is the simulated solar light intensity (100 mW cm−2).
Hydrogen and oxygen evolution of the photoanode was evaluated in an air-tight cell at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination, and the amount of gas was detected with a GC every 20 min.
3. Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the fabrication process of all samples is shown in Fig. 1A. The TiO2 nanorod arrays were prepared on a FTO conductive substrate by a hydrothermal method reported previously.22 As shown in Fig. 1B, the dense nanorods grow vertically aligned on the conductive substrate, and the film thickness is about 2.3 μm (inset of Fig. 1B). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S1†) indicates that all characteristic peaks could be indexed to the tetragonal TiO2 rutile phase (JCPDS no. 88-1175). The growth of Co3O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 was achieved by a hydrothermal deposition route (the sample is named Co3O4/TiO2), and then the obtained Co3O4/TiO2 sample was engraved by the Ar-plasma treatment approach for 120 s (the sample is named Ar–Co3O4/TiO2). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1C and D) and crystal structure (Fig. S1†) have no apparent changes compared with those of pristine TiO2. Owing to the relatively low amount, high dispersion and small diameters of Co3O4 loaded on the TiO2 nanorods, the diffraction peaks of Co3O4 could not be evidently detected in the XRD patterns. To further confirm the formation of the Co3O4 crystal phase, the precipitate in the hydrothermal solution for preparing Co3O4/TiO2 has been collected and characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. S12,† all diffraction peaks could be indexed to the cubic structure of the Co3O4 phase (JCPDS, no: 78-1969). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were applied to verify the dispersion and size of Co3O4 nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 1E, in the case of pure TiO2 nanorods, the lattice fringe of 0.32 nm (110) is well matched with that of the rutile TiO2 structure. It can be clearly seen from the TEM image of Co3O4/TiO2 (Fig. 1F) that uniform nanoparticles with a diameter of about 5 nm are well-dispersed on the surfaces of TiO2 nanorods, and the lattice spacing of 0.24 nm could be indexed to the (311) plane of the cubic Co3O4 structure. Moreover, the cobalt element can also be detected in whole elemental mapping images of Co3O4/TiO2 (Fig. S2†). Therefore, it was concluded that the Co3O4 nanoparticles have been uniformly dispersed on TiO2 nanorod arrays. After the Ar-plasma treatments, the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1G and inset) of Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 were generally in accordance with those of Co3O4/TiO2, and the uniform dispersion of Ti, O, and Co elements could also be observed by SEM mapping (Fig. S3†), illustrating that the distribution and intrinsic structure of Co3O4 cocatalysts have no evident changes after the Ar-plasma treatments.

Insets of (E, F and G) show the TEM images of pristine TiO2, Co3O4/TiO2 and Ar–Co3O4/TiO2, respectively. 
To investigate that the Ar-plasma treatment could efficiently activate the Co3O4 cocatalyst by construction of oxygen vacancies, the surface electronic state characteristics of all samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the peaks at around 796.3 eV and 780.5 eV could be indexed to the binding energy of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of Co3O4, respectively.23–25 Through XPS-peak-differentiation-imitating analysis, it is clear that the peak area ratio (Co2+/Co3+) of Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 (Fig. 2B) is larger than that of the untreated Co3O4/TiO2 sample (Fig. 2A), indicating that more Co2+ ions are generated by Ar-plasma treatment. Meanwhile, two enhanced satellite peaks of the Co2+ oxidation state centered at about 785.7 eV and 802.1 eV were present in Ar–Co3O4/TiO2, further confirming that a part of Co3+ is reduced to Co2+ with the production of oxygen vacancies.26 Besides, the O 1s fine spectra could further demonstrate the production of oxygen vacancies. It is obviously observed that O 1s contains four oxygen peaks (Fig. 2D and E). O1 at 529.8 eV is the typical metal–oxygen bond.27 O2 (530.6 eV) and O3 (531.5 eV) are attributed to the hydroxyl groups and absorbed water, respectively.28,29 O4 at a higher value of 532.2 eV is associated with the surface oxygen defect species owing to the atomic ratio of O/Co being less than 1.30,31 A strong and apparent O4 peak was observed in the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 sample (Fig. 2E), which clearly illustrates that abundant oxygen vacancies were produced on the surface of Co3O4 after Ar-plasma treatment. For excluding the observed oxygen vacancies derived from TiO2, the pristine TiO2 was also processed under the same Ar-plasma conditions (120 s). It can be clearly seen that no evident valence state changes occurred on Ti and O elements (Fig. S4†), which may be attributed to the insensitivity of the Ti–O bond to the Ar-plasma circumstance. Furthermore, owing to the unpaired electron of Co2+ ions, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can be employed to detect Co2+ for explaining the existence of oxygen vacancies.32,33 Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 exhibits a stronger EPR peak than Co3O4/TiO2 (Fig. S5†), further verifying that more oxygen vacancies existed in the Co3O4 cocatalyst after the Ar-plasma engraving. In addition, the formed oxygen vacancies could be filled by replacing Ar with O2 gas. The corresponding XPS results show both the reduced peak area ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and the O4 peak, confirming that the oxygen vacancies have been evidently decreased after O-plasma treatment. Based on the above discussions, it can be concluded that the Ar-plasma treatment could selectively construct oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4 cocatalysts.

The PEC water oxidation properties of the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode were investigated in 0.1 M NaOH under simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The other photoanodes have also been examined under the same conditions for activity comparison. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves are shown in Fig. 3A, and it can be clearly seen that the Co3O4/TiO2 nanorods exhibit a photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode (0.7 mA cm−2). Interestingly, after the Ar-plasma treatment, the photocurrent density could further reach up to 2.5 mA cm−2. However, the photocurrent value displays a remarkable diminution after the O-plasma treatment (O–Ar/Co3O4/TiO2). The above results indicate that the activated Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies could significantly improve the photocurrent density of the TiO2 photoanode. In addition, the photocurrent densities are shown in Fig. S6† for different treatment times with Ar or O-plasma. However, in the case of pristine TiO2 photoanodes, no evident change in the photocurrent value was observed after Ar-plasma treatment (Fig. S7†), which further confirms that the enhancement of photocurrent is mainly attributed to the activation of Co3O4 cocatalysts. Moreover, the photoelectric conversion capabilities of the as-prepared samples were evaluated using the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) and incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). A maximum ABPE of 1.15% was obtained from the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 sample, while a relatively low value of 0.55% was presented by Co3O4/TiO2 (Fig. 3B). The IPCE results (Fig. 3C) show a similar distribution compared with current–potential characteristics; Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 reaches a high value of 91.5% at 370 nm. In addition, the interfacial water oxidation kinetics could be evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the charge transfer resistance is represented by the arcs in the Nyquist plots.34 From Fig. 3D, it can be seen that Co3O4/TiO2 shows a smaller arc radius than pristine TiO2, indicating that the interfacial charge separation efficiency of TiO2 improved. After the Ar-plasma bombardment, a reduced arc radius was detected, implying that the interfacial separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs could be further accelerated by surface oxygen vacancies of Co3O4. The surface reaction kinetics has also been quantitatively evaluated by the calculation of the surface charge separation efficiency (ηsurface). As shown in Fig. S13,† it can be clearly seen that the ηsurface for pristine TiO2 is only about 42% at 1.23 VRHE, while the ηsurface could be achieved up to 64% after the decoration of Co3O4 cocatalysts. Interestingly, in the case of oxygen vacancy formation on Co3O4 cocatalysts, the ηsurface could be significantly increased up to 90% at 1.23 VRHE. It is obvious that the calculated ηsurface is consistent with the EIS analysis results. To further illustrate that the oxygen vacancies of Co3O4 contribute to the increase of its catalytic reactivity, the dark electrochemical activity of Co3O4/TiO2 and Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 is determined and shown in Fig. S14;† Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 exhibits higher catalytic activity for water oxidation than the Co3O4 /TiO2 samples, which may further confirm the important roles of oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 cocatalyst in promoting the PEC water oxidation activity. Based on the above results, we can conclude that the PEC properties of the Co3O4/TiO2 system could be effectively elevated by activating Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies, and it exhibits an outstanding photoelectric conversion performance.

(F) H2 and O2 evolution from PEC water splitting of the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G light irradiation. 
We all know that the high PEC stability of a photoanode is required for its practical applications. As shown in Fig. 3E, the obtained Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode exhibits a constant photocurrent even within 5.5 h of light irradiation, indicating that it has excellent photoelectric durability and structural stability for PEC water splitting. Moreover, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution from the overall water splitting was also measured in an air-tight cell at 1.23 VRHE under light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), and their amounts were detected with a chromatograph (GC) every 20 min. As shown in Fig. 3F, the H2 volume is 85 μmol, and the O2 volume is 41 μmol after 120 min, indicating that a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 from the water splitting has been obtained, and the faradaic efficiency is about 94.4%. Therefore, the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 exhibits superior PEC stability and high water oxidation capacity. Note that the strategy of activating Co3O4 cocatalysts is also feasible for other photoanode systems. As shown in Fig. S8,† the photocurrent densities of Co3O4-decorated BiVO4 and Fe2O3 could reach 2.5 and 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively. After the Ar-plasma treatment, the photocurrent values can be increased to 3.8 and 1.7 mA cm−2, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that cocatalyst activation will be a universal approach for enhancing the performance of PEC systems.
In order to explain the role of oxygen vacancies in improving PEC performances, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The optimized model of Co3O4 and calculated adsorption energy of H2O on the surface of Co3O4 are shown in Fig. S9.† The adsorption of H2O at the Co sites is energetically favorable, and the adsorption energy of Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies (VO-Co3O4: −1.6 eV) is lower than that of Co3O4 without oxygen vacancies (Co3O4: −1.1 eV). This result confirms that the formation of oxygen vacancies can effectively reduce the thermodynamic overpotential for water adsorption, which is principally feasible for increasing the reactivity of active sites. In addition, the contact angles (Fig. S10†) of Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 and Co3O4/TiO2 are 16° and 30°, respectively, revealing that the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 exhibits advantageous hydrophilic ability. This experimental result is well in agreement with the above calculation of the adsorption energy of H2O. The influence mechanism of oxygen vacancies on the adsorption energy of H2O was investigated by density of states (DOS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the calculated band gap energy for the pristine Co3O4 is 1.8 eV, which is derived from the electronic density of state (DOS) calculated with the Hubbard U correction (GGA+U) within the density functional theory. For VO-Co3O4, new defect states were located in the band gap, resulting in improvement of the conductivity of Co3O4; meanwhile, introducing impurity states due to the unpaired d-electrons of Co can reduce the filling of antibonding states to enhance H2O adsorption. As shown in Fig. 4B, the charge density difference shows that the oxygen vacancies are positively charged, and the electrons transfer to the nearby Co atom, suggesting that part of the neighboring Co3+ is reduced to Co2+ by the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is in good agreement with the above XPS analysis results. More specifically, the electron delocalization degree of Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies is much higher than that of Co3O4 without oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for promoting the charge transfer as well as hole trapping. On the basis of theoretical calculations and experimental results, it was reasonably concluded that the formation of oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 cocatalysts could not only facilitate the water absorption but also accelerate the charge separation and hole trapping for water oxidation.

(C) Schematic illustration of the charge separation and migration of the Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode. The inset of C displays the possible charge transfer in the water oxidation process. 
On the basis of the above results, a possible charge transfer mechanism for the activated Co3O4 cocatalysts (with rich oxygen vacancies) modified on TiO2 photoanodes has been presented in Fig. 4C. Under solar irradiation, the photogenerated electrons and holes have been formed on the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 nanorods. The electrons could be directly transferred from the conduction band of TiO2 to the FTO substrate due to the vertical 1D nanostructure. At the same time, the photogenerated holes have been transferred from the valence band of TiO2 to the Co3O4 cocatalysts. Then, the recombination ratios of photogenerated electrons and holes could be effectively decreased, which could be further confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S11†). The photogenerated holes could be rapidly captured on the Co3O4 surface owing to the facilitated charge migration with oxygen vacancies, and the holes preferentially oxidized the Co2+ to Co3+ due to its high oxidation capacity. Moreover, the theoretical calculations show that the VO-Co3O4 could more easily adsorb water molecules than initial Co3O4 samples. Therefore, the selective construction of surface active sites on OER cocatalysts not only realizes highly efficient adsorption of water, but also accelerates the hole transfer for water oxidation, which could significantly improve the PEC activities. It has been reported that Co3+ atoms under the excitation states could serve as the active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction.35 The produced Co3+ could rapidly oxidize the adsorbed water molecules into oxygen, and then reduce the Co3+ sites into Co2+ sites, which could again accept the holes from TiO2 for the next water oxidation cycle. Thus, the acceptance of holes and evolution of oxygen occur in a loop between Co2+ and Co3+, which ensures the efficient utilization of holes and stabilized water splitting.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile Ar-plasma bombardment for selectively constructing oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 cocatalyst loaded on TiO2 nanorod arrays. The obtained Ar–Co3O4/TiO2 photoanodes exhibited a significant photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination, about 3.5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 and nearly 2 times higher than that of untreated Co3O4/TiO2 photoanodes. The improved PEC activity could be ascribed to the activation of Co3O4 cocatalysts with abundant surface oxygen vacancies. More specifically, the activated Co3O4 could not only effectively capture and transfer holes for reducing the interfacial recombination but also remarkably increase the amount of surface active sites for water oxidation. Additionally, the formation of oxygen vacancies could also promote the H2O adsorption on the Co3O4 surface. This study demonstrates a cost-effective and universal pathway to fabricate a highly efficient PEC water splitting device by modulating the OER cocatalyst with oxygen vacancies.
