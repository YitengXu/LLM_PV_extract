trans-Di(isothiocyanato)-[N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic
 
acid) ruthenium(II) acts as a very efficient charge-transfer sensitizer
 for nanocrystalline TiO2 films. The incident photon-to-electron
 conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the dye-coated TiO2 film exceeded 80% in the wavelength domain between 400 and 600 nm. A sandwich-type regenerative solar cell fabricated from a 10 μm thick TiO2
 film sensitized with this dye generated a short-circuit photocurrent of 19.6 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit photovoltage of 720
 mV in simulated AM1.5 solar light (924 W m−2) with an overall power conversion efficiency of 8.6%.
Much attention has been paid to dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells based on nanocrystalline semiconductor films since the advent of the Grätzel cell.1 With the most outstanding
 photoelectric conversion properties and high stability, cis-di(isothiocyanato)-[N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic
 acid)] ruthenium(II) (cis-Ru) was extensively studied2–6 during the past 10 years. In this period, although many ruthenium polypyridine complexes7–10 have been synthesized for the purpose of obtaining better dyes than cis-Ru in photoelectric conversion, so far few others have been comparable to it. Zakeeruddin et al. reported the synthesis of the isomer of cis-Ru, and prophesied it would be an attractive candidate as a panchromatic
 charge-transfer sensitizer in mesoporous oxide solar cells.11 Herein we report its outstanding charge-transfer properties when anchored to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2
 particles.

  

The absorption spectra for trans-Ru in DMF and nanocrystalline TiO2 film, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1. Three absorption peaks assigned to MLCT appear in the UV-vis spectra for both dye-coated film and dye solution. Compared with the spectrum of cis-Ru, the lowest energy MLCT maximum is red-shifted by about 50 nm.11
 The enhanced red 
absorption of trans-Ru renders it an attractive candidate as a panchromatic charge-transfer sensitizer in liquid junction solar cells based on nanocrystalline oxide. However, while the 590 nm
 peak is more intense than the 530 nm peak for dye solution, the opposite is seen for the dye-coated film. This phenomenon
 may result from the solvent effect.

Corrected IPCEs of trans-Ru are above 80% between 400 and 600 nm (Fig. 1). The close resemblance between the action spectrum and the UV-vis spectrum of the dye-coated film indicates that the dye is responsible for the photocurrent generation. We can see from the action spectrum that the sensitization of TiO2
 film at 590 nm is not as efficient as expected, compared with the sensitization at 530 nm, which is another example of “
band selective” sensitization after the report of Ferrere
 and Gregg.12
A platinized CTO glass, as counter electrode, was placed on
 the dye-coated film and both were clamped together (see Experimental) after introducing the electrolyte into the inter-electrode space. Under irradiation of simulated AM1.5 solar light,2
 the I–V curves for trans-Ru and cis-Ru measured in a 2-electrode system are illustrated in Fig. 2. Under “one sun” 
irradiation (924 W m−2), the cell based on trans-Ru gave 19.6 mA cm−2 of short-circuit photocurrent (Isc), 720 mV of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and 0.56 of fill factor (FF), corresponding to an
 overall power conversion efficiency of 8.6%, while the cell based on cis-Ru had 14.9 mA cm−2Isc, 692 mV Voc and 0.60 FF, corresponding to an overall power conversion efficiency of
 6.7%. Obviously, trans-Ru is more efficient in charge transfer than cis-Ru under the same conditions. No attempt has yet been
 made to optimize the solar cell, so it is of no doubt that the cell based on trans-Ru will be more efficient after optimizing FF.

We also examined the stability of the cell. After photoelectrochemical measurements, the dye-coated film was set in daylight for a week and then measured again. Results showed that the photocurrents remained unchanged within experimental deviation,
 confirming its high stability.
In order to explain the mechanism of photocurrent generation, we measured the HOMO energy level of trans-Ru by synchrotron radiation XPS (SRXPS). A HOMO energy level in vacuum of −5.2 eV, combined with an absorption threshold at 800 nm (1.55 eV) for trans-Ru, gives the first excited state energy level (under visible light excitation) at −3.65 eV, above the conduction band edge (CB) of TiO2 (−4.4 eV). Therefore, an excited dye molecule on a TiO2 particle could inject an electron into the CB of TiO2
[eqn. (1)]. The electron injected into the CB of TiO2
 is subsequently directed to the back contact of the CTO glass and immediately flows to the counter electrode [eqn. (2)] under the photovoltage driving force. The process can be presented as follows:

The HOMO energy level of cis-Ru was also determined to be −5.2 eV by SRXPS, so the excited energy levels for both isomers should be similar under visible light illumination. Therefore, one can predict that the rate constant for electron injection (Kinj) is much larger than the rate constant for back electron transfer (Kb), resulting in very rapid electron transfer from trans-Ru to the CB of TiO2, otherwise, the values of IPCE and η would not be so high. Obviously, trans-Ru should also
 be an excellent sensitizer for TiO2. The study of the 
kinetics of the charge-transfer process of trans-Ru coated films is in progress.
Experimental

cis-Ru was synthesized according to the literature procedure,2 and at the same time its isomer, trans-di(isothiocyanato)-[N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)] ruthenium(II) (trans-Ru) was prepared by following the literature procedure.111H NMR (D2O/NaOD) for trans-Ru: 9.43 (4H, d, 6,6′-bpy); 8.76 (4H, s, 3,3′-bpy); 7.98 (4H, d, 5,5′-bpy); 1H NMR (D2O/NaOD) for cis-Ru: 9.50 (2H, d, 6-bpy), 8.87 (2H, s, 3-bpy), 8.70 (2H, s, 3′-bpy), 8.15 (2H, d, 5-bpy), 7.75 (2H, d, 6′-bpy), 7.44 (2H, d, 5′-bpy).
 TiO2 colloid (100–150 g dm−3, 15–20 nm) was prepared by following the reported method.1 TiO2 films (10 μm thick) were prepared by spreading the colloidal dispersion onto fluorine-doped conducting tin oxide glass (CTO, 20 Ω per square) followed by
 sintering at 450°C for 30 min. The porous TiO2 film was sensitized with trans-Ru by soaking it in the dye solution (in DMF)
 for at least 72 h.
UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer. With 0.3 M LiI+0.03 M I2 in propylene carbonate–ethylene carbonate (1:1 v/v) used as the redox electrolyte, the photocurrent action spectra were measured in a three-electrode system (CH 600 voltammetric analyzer, USA) in which dye-coated film, platinized CTO glass and a saturated calomel electrode were employed as working electrode,
 counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. In order to increase light harvesting and catalyze the reduction of triiodide, the platinized CTO glass was placed on top of
 the dye-coated film and both were clamped tightly.
