    , Accepted 9th August 2018First published on 10th August 2018AbstractWe detail the physical properties and organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance of a tetrachlorinated fused ring non-fullerene acceptor. Introduction of chlorine atoms red-shifts the optical absorption out to 850 nm leading to low energy photocurrent generation in solar cell devices using the donor polymer PBDB-T. Processing films with different volatile solvent additives affects the active layer morphology and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The best solar cells exhibit power conversion efficiencies over 9%.
The best performing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are currently divided into two categories, those based upon perylene diimide (PDI) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT) building blocks.1–3 For single junction OPVs, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 9% for PDI based solar cells4,5 and over 14% for IDT based solar cells.6 For the latter, the most common derivative, ITIC, has become a standard NFA and OPVs have eclipsed 10% PCE with numerous ITIC/donor polymer combinations.7–9
Optimization of the chemical structure has mostly centered on altering the electronic and steric properties of the side chains of the core or the terminal acceptor moiety. For example, using hexylthienyl as side chains instead of phenyl promotes intermolecular interactions through the sulfur atoms.10 Substituting the terminal acceptor of ITIC with methyl groups or modifying it with a N-ethylthiabarbituric moiety leads in both cases to an increased Voc, due to their higher LUMO energy levels.11,12 Moreover, it has been shown that locking an ITIC derivative in its planar conformation broadened its absorption spectra and increased the PCE from 2 to 8%.13
One of the most successful alternations has been the installation of fluorine (F) atoms. The addition of F-atoms red-shifts and increases the intensity of the optical absorption, while improving molecular packing, leading to higher performing OPV devices.14 An emerging trend in the OPV field has been to replace the F-atoms with chlorine (Cl) atoms.15–20 On an aromatic ring, Cl is more electron withdrawing than F and thus renders the indandione terminal unit a better acceptor leading to greater intramolecular charge transfer and stronger low-energy optical absorption. Fig. 1 shows the only reported Cl based IDT type NFAs.21–23 OPVs fabricated with these acceptors all exhibit photocurrent generation in the near-IR and high short-circuit currents. Indeed, OPVs based on the structure in Fig. 1C have very recently been used as the back cell in tandem OPVs with a record PCE of 15%.24 Cl based NFAs are important and more structures must be designed and studied as OPV acceptor materials.

In this contribution, we report on the tetrachlorinated analogue of ITIC, namely ITIC-Cl4.‡25 This H for Cl substitution has the major advantage of stretching out the absorbance wavelength range ∼60 nm further than the one of ITIC (ca. 850 vs. 790 nm) in the solid state, as shown on Fig. 2. For ITIC-Cl4, red-shift in both λmax and λonset upon transitioning from solution to film is significantly larger than that for ITIC and is indicative of stronger intermolecular interactions within the bulk films for ITIC-Cl4vs. ITIC.

Since ITIC-Cl4 absorbs up to the near-IR region, this compound has the potential of generating large photocurrents in OPV devices. However, this advantage comes with a trade-off in the open circuit voltage it can reach. To determine the electronic energy levels cyclic voltammetry was performed. The ionization potential and electron affinity were determined to be 5.5 eV and 3.9 eV, respectively. These values are commonly correlated to the HOMO (ca. −5.5 eV) and LUMO (ca. −3.9 ev) energy levels. Compared to ITIC (ca. HOMO = −5.5 eV and LUMO = −3.8 eV)7 the LUMO energy level is lower in energy for ITIC-Cl4, highlighting the overall electron withdrawing effect of the Cl atoms. Of note the electrochemical characterization revealed that this ITIC-Cl4 compound has a low electrochemical stability as indicated by the irreversible reduction waves as shown in Fig. S5, ESI.† This observation is consistent with other ITIC derivatives,7,11,12 but contrasts with PDI compounds which always exhibit clean reversible reduction waves.26–31 However, it does not seem to have an impact on their solar cell performances, where ITIC based solar cells consistently achieve PCEs beyond 10%.
For the preparation of OPV devices we selected the donor polymer, PBDB-T8 (see Fig. 3A) to be paired with ITIC-Cl4. The energy levels (Fig. 3B) and optical properties (Fig. 3C) are a good match with those of ITIC-Cl4. The inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC-Cl4/MoOx/Ag was used and all solution processed layers were spin-coated in air. Full details on device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† As a first screening, three different solvents were used to cast this blend (1:1 by weight) as an active layer: chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and ortho-dicholorobenzene (o-DCB). While all films were cast under identical conditions, the thickness of each varied with the solvent. As shown in Fig. S7A, ESI,† the absorbance of the additive-free film prepared from CF is almost five times higher than the one prepared using o-DCB. OPV devices with active layers cast from the o-DCB solvent led to an average PCE of 8.3%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 21 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V and fill factor (FF) of 56%, compared to a PCE around 3% for devices prepared from CF and CB (see Table S1, ESI†). A lower short-circuit current (ca. 10 mA cm−2) was the cause of the lower PCE.

Taking into consideration the optical and electrochemical properties of ITIC-Cl4, the values obtained with the devices cast from o-DCB make sense when compared to the ones reported in the literature for the IDT building block. Indeed, the PBDB-T:ITIC donor:acceptor pair used in OPV devices led to a Voc of 0.90 V and a Jsc of 17 mA cm−2.8 The lower Voc and the higher Jsc values obtained herein with the PBDB-T:ITIC-Cl4 system can be explained by the red-shift of the ITIC-Cl4 optical spectrum and its deeper LUMO energy level than ITIC. The results are also consistent when compared to OPV devices prepared with an acceptor presenting a similar optical spectrum and deeper LUMO level. Using PTB7-Th:BT-CIC as the active layer,24 the OPV devices gave a Voc of 0.69 V and Jsc of 22 mA cm−2 which are values close to the ones obtained here.
Use of the volatile solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in the casting solutions (0.5% v/v) changes the optical absorbance profile and further red-shifts the absorbance maximum for the three films (Fig. S7A, ESI†) which led to improved PCE devices with active layers cast from CF, CB, and o-DCB. This change indicates that the addition of DIO increases both the solubility of the individual compounds and their level of organization within the active layer, consistent with the literature findings.32,33 The atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images presented in Fig. S8, ESI† do not reveal major difference in the additive free vs. DIO processed films, but the film root mean square roughness (RMS) increases upon the addition of DIO, supporting the higher level of aggregation that it might trigger.
To further verify the impact of DIO on the organization of ITIC-Cl4, neat films of this compound were spin-coated from o-DCB with DIO concentration ranging from 0 to 5% v/v. As shown in Fig. S6A, ESI,† the same red-shift observed in the blend happens within the neat films at 0.5 and 1% v/v, but not to the same extent when 5% v/v is used. This is probably due to the important aggregation that happens, as revealed by the AFM image in Fig. S6C, ESI.†
The same experiment has been repeated with another solvent additive, 1-chloronaphtalene (CN). It can be observed in Fig. S6B and D, ESI† that this additive also impacts the level of organization of ITIC-Cl4, but in a different way, as revealed by the blue-shift of the wavelength of the absorbance maximum for all the additive concentrations. Fig. 4 directly compares the neat films of ITIC-Cl4 processed from o-DCB with either 0.5% v/v DIO or CN solvent additive, highlighting the different shifts that can be achieved using (or not) these additives. The corresponding AFM height images reveal a difference in their resulting morphology. On the one hand, adding CN leads to a smoother film (RMS = 1.35 nm) and larger features compared to the two other samples. On the other hand, the addition of DIO leads to rougher films than the CN-containing one, with an RMS of 2.22 nm and smaller features. DIO seems to be a solvent additive that promotes the aggregation of ITIC-Cl4, supported by the red-shift of the absorbance maximum of the DIO processed film compared to the solvent only processed film, while the blue shift observed for the CN-processed film supports the hypothesis that CN solvent additive prevents aggregation of ITIC-Cl4. Overall, these two additives affect the organization of ITIC-Cl4 differently, which could impact the morphology of the active layer, and the PCE, Voc and Jsc parameters of OPV devices.

Table S2 in the ESI† shows the OPV device data with active layers processed from o-DCB solutions with 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1 or 5% v/v concentration of DIO or CN. The use of either additive with concentrations from 0.1 up to 1% gives similar results. However, processing the active layers with 5% DIO dramatically decreases the performances of the devices, illustrated by the loss of diode characteristics in the JV curve (see Fig. S9B, ESI†) with a PCE of less than 1%. This decrease is probably due to the DIO-induced over-aggregation, as shown in Fig. S9C, ESI.† Use of 5% CN processing additive also led to a large decrease in performance (PCE 3.5%), but retained diode behavior as seen in the JV curve (Fig. S9E, ESI†) and less aggregation than with DIO was observed in the AFM image in Fig. S9F, ESI.† Clearly the choice of processing additive has a major impact on the evolution of this PBDB-T:ITCl-Cl4 BHJ.

Table 1 and Fig. 5 present the performances of the OPV devices with active layers processed without additive, 0.5% v/v DIO or 0.5% v/v CN. While the PCEs for the three devices stand around 9% (best device: 9.6%) and FF around 60%, there is a slight difference between the Voc and Jsc values. OPVs processed without additive had an average Voc of 0.70 V. Processing with DIO lowers the Voc to an average of 0.64 V while processing with CN increases the Voc to an average of 0.74 V. This overall 0.1 V difference in Voc can be clearly observed in Fig. 5C, where representative JV curves are displayed for each device. For the DIO-processed devices, the Jsc is also larger, which correlates with the red shift observed in the optical spectrum of this blend (see Fig. 5A). For CN-processed devices the Jsc is decreased owing to the lower energy absorption cut-off. The red shift of the absorbance going from CN processed, to no-additive processing, to DIO processed is observed in the optical spectra of the blends (Fig. 5A) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 5D).

Fig. 6 presents the AFM height images of these three samples, where both the size of the features and the RMS are different. The DIO processed film is rougher and presents larger domains than the CN containing one. If processing with DIO increases the organization propensity of the ITIC-Cl4 compound, it could lead to a better phase separation in the blend. By contrast, processing with CN seems to lead to a lower degree of ITIC-Cl4 organization, which could result in a more intermixed system as observed in Fig. 6. This more pronounced phase separation for DIO-processed films can also be observed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 5B). The DIO processed films exhibit less PL quenching than the CN processed films, supporting the notion of lesser mixing of the donor and acceptor.

Interestingly, using both DIO and CN processing additives in a 1:1 ratio at combined concentrations of 0.5% and 1% v/v led to results similar to the ones obtained for the 0.5% v/v DIO processed blend film, with a Voc of ∼ 0.64 V, Jsc of 21 mA/cm2, FF of ∼ 60% and PCE between 8 and 9%. The results are shown in Table S3 in the ESI.† In this case, the DIO seems to drive the aggregation even in the presence of CN. As presented in Fig. S10 in the ESI,† their UV-visible profiles are red-shifted compared to the additive-free blend and their AFM height images show high RMS (2.10 and 6.57 nm, respectively), and well-defined features, which is indicative of aggregation.
To further understand the Voc and Jsc differences, angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were conducted on the additive-free and DIO-containing films.6 Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI† present the atomic concentration of carbon (C), sulfur (S) and Cl atoms. Since the Cl atoms are only present on the ITIC-Cl4 compound, the Cl/C ratio (in percentage) can be used to probe the ITIC-Cl4 presence on the surface of the samples. Results for the no-additive processed films and the DIO processed films were different. The Cl/C ratio of the DIO-processed films is half that of the film processed without it. This means that less ITIC-Cl4 is at the top of the film, leading to the hypothesis that DIO processing impacts the vertical separation driving the acceptor to the bottom. Taking into consideration this result along with the red-shifted optical absorption spectra, lower PL quenching, lower Voc and higher Jsc, the use of DIO processing additive induces phase separation of the PBDB-T and ITIC-Cl4 and forces aggregation of the acceptor.
In summary, we have reported on a tetrachlorinated ITIC-type NFA and probed its utility to deliver high performance organic solar cells. In our laboratory, PBDB-T:ITIC-Cl4 based solar cells reached a maximum power conversion efficiency of 9.6%. The addition of four chlorine atoms to the ITIC acceptor resulted in a significant red-shifting of the optical absorption and enabled solar cell photocurrent generation beyond 850 nm. Moreover, use of processing volatile additives can change the organization of ITIC-Cl4 and influence its phase separation within the blend, giving a certain leverage to tune the parameters of the OPV devices, most notably the open-circuit voltage. Use of DIO additive led to the greatest phase separation and largest currents while processing with CN led to the most intermixed films with the highest voltage.
Overall these results support the small but growing body of literature that demonstrates that strategic substitution of non-fullerene acceptors with chlorine atoms positively influences performances. As future work, an in-depth structural characterization of these compounds in BHJ films as a function of processing conditions, not only focused on PCE, is important to unravel their behavior and tailor the processing conditions more appropriately, leading to higher level advances.
