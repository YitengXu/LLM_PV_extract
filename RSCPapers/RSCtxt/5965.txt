    , Accepted 10th December 2013First published on 10th December 2013AbstractWork-function-adjustable TimSinOx provides an opportunity to optimize the energy-level alignment at the photoactive/cathode interface in the polymer bulk heterojunction solar cell. The work function of TimSinOx is engineered by adjusting the Si mol% during the sol–gel reaction. The controlled work function provides an energetically downhill cascade pathway for electrons from the electron acceptor to the cathode, which contributes to improvement in electron collection at the cathode. The valence band maxima of TimSinOx also become deeper as the Si mol% increases and the hole-blocking ability of TimSinOx is enhanced as a result. Accordingly, polymer solar cells fitted with the optimized TimSinOx exhibit enhanced performance.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential for the fabrication of low-cost, lightweight, mechanically flexible modules. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) needs to be improved if PSCs are to penetrate the solar energy market. For this to be achieved, a harmonic combination of donor polymer properties such as light absorption, charge transport, miscibility and energy-level alignment with a given acceptor is essential. Besides, the interfacial engineering between the photoactive layer and electrodes is also very important because the interlayers lead to selective charge collection at the electrodes when the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is employed as a photoactive layer.1–3 Because of the unique structure of the BHJ, both the donor and acceptor domains can form contacts with both electrodes simultaneously. Therefore, the probability of recombination at both electrodes is so high that it may decrease the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF).4 For recombination suppression, interlayers exhibiting asymmetric charge transport are usually inserted at the BHJ photoactive layer/electrode interfaces.5–8 Asymmetric charge transport has usually been achieved through energy-level alignment between the photoactive material (donor or acceptor) and the interlayer. In particular, for electron-transport enhancement with simultaneous suppression of hole transport, TiOx or ZnO layers have been utilized as a cathode interlayer because their work functions are quite similar to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), while their valence band maxima (VBM) are much deeper than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of typical donor materials.5,6,9–14 The work function of TiOx (or ZnO) must be similar to that of the LUMO of PC71BM for efficient electron collection. The “energetically downhill cascade pathway” for electrons from PC71BM to Al has been suggested to improve the electron collection efficiency.15–19 For tuning of the work function of a given interlayer for such fine energy-level alignment with PC71BM, additional post-treatments have been tested and employed on the surface of TiOx (or ZnO), such as oxygen plasma treatment,20 UV–ozone treatment21 and self-assembled monolayer deposition,22–26 but these incur additional process costs. Furthermore, they hardly change the bandgap of TiOx (or ZnO), so it is impossible to engineer the VBM of TiOx (or ZnO) simultaneously, although a deep VBM of TiOx (or ZnO) is required for more effective hole-blocking in the BHJ solar cell.
In this work, we suggest a novel ternary oxide (TimSinOx, m + n = 1) sol–gel film as a cathode interlayer, which has a work function and bandgap that can be tuned simultaneously by adjusting its composition ratio (m/n) during the sol–gel reaction. The details of the TimSinOx synthesis are provided in the Experimental section with a scheme. The work-function- and bandgap-engineered TimSinOx is tested in a PSC using one of the most promising donor polymers, poly[4,8-bis-substituted-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4-substituted-thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT)-derived polymer,27–30 with PC71BM. The chemical structure and absorption spectrum of the polymer (fluorinated PBDTTT functionalized with a compatibilizing ethoxycarbonyl butyl carboxyl group, PBDTTT-F-ECB) employed in this work are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively, together with those of PC71BM. Details of PBDTTT-F-ECB will be presented elsewhere.

Experimental
Preparation of TimSinOx sol–gel solutions
The solution for the formation of the TimSinOx interlayer was prepared through sol–gel reaction, as illustrated in Scheme 1. A solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 0.013 mol, 2.88 mL) and HCl (37%, 0.13 mmol, 0.013 mL) in methanol (MeOH, 5.00 mL) was stirred at room temperature in a vial. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TIP, 0.013 mol, 4.08 mL) was added to MeOH (5.00 mL). Glacial acetic acid (0.013 mol, 0.761 mL) was then added dropwise at room temperature. After stirring for 30 min, the appropriate portion of TEOS solution was dropped into TIP solution for the target mole ratio of TEOS to TIP. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and stirred for 18 h. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously during the entire reaction. The solution was diluted in MeOH (1:400) before use.

Fabrication of polymer solar cells
Each cell was fabricated on a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with the structure: glass/ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene) sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/TimSinOx/Al. Aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution (Baytron P VP A1 4083, used as purchased) was spin-cast to form a 30 nm film on the ITO glass substrate. The PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO/glass substrate was dried at 120 °C in an air-filled natural convection oven for 1 h and then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The blend solution containing the polymer (PBDTTT-F-ECB):PC71BM mixture in chlorobenzene with 4-vol% 1,8-diiodooctane was then spin-cast on the PEDOT:PSS layer. PC71BM (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as purchased. The active film was dried at room temperature for 30 min. The TimSinOx sol–gel solution diluted in MeOH was then spin-cast on the active layer. The Al cathode electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum with a base pressure of less than 9 × 10−7 torr, and was over 100 nm in thickness.
Measurement and characterization
The work function of TimSinOx was measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (PHI 5000 VersaProbe). The energy bandgap of TimSinOx was obtained from the cutoff wavelength of its absorption spectrum. Total reflection spectra were obtained with a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 35 with a 50 mm integrating sphere) after calibration with a barium reference. The total absorption (A) was obtained from the total reflection (R = 1 − A) including both direct and diffuse reflections measured in the integrating sphere with the inside wall coated with barium sulfate. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 Source-Meter and Oriel xenon lamp with an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter under nitrogen gas in a glove box. The intensity of the simulated light (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a KG-5 filtered standard Si cell. The active area was defined for obtaining Jsc using the measured area of the Al top electrode. The series and shunt resistance (Rs and Rp) were calculated from the inverse slope of the J–V curves at 0 and 1.5 V, respectively.11,12 IPCE measurements of the devices without encapsulation were performed in air within minutes after the J–V measurements (Newport, Model IQE-200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed with an FEI Tecnai-G2 F20. TEM samples were prepared with a focused ion beam. The refractive index of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.).
Results and discussion
To find the best composition ratio of TimSinOx for efficient electron collection and hole-blocking at the cathode, we investigated the work function and bandgap of TimSinOx. The bandgap was estimated from the cutoff wavelength of the absorption spectrum (see ESI, Fig. S1†).31 The VBM was calculated from the sum of the work function and the optical bandgap. Fig. 2(a) shows that the work function of TimSinOx increases with Si mol%. The required work function (between those of PC71BM and Al, i.e., 3.93 eV < Φ < 4.06 eV) to complete the downhill cascade pathway for electrons from PC71BM to Al is obtained at around 50 mol% Si (Ti0.5Si0.5Ox), as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2(a). The bandgap (Eg) of TimSinOx increases slightly with Si mol% (Fig. 2(b)); it becomes saturated at 10% and does not change much by 50%. The Eg value of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox exhibiting the optimum work function is 3.82 eV. It is believed that the increased Eg and the work function of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox would lead to a higher barrier against hole transport to the cathode. The strong hole-blocking ability of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox is expected because of such a higher barrier and it is verified by measuring the leakage current of the device. Fig. 2(c) shows the diode characteristics of the four PSCs with different cathodes: (i) none/Al; (ii) 1 nm LiF/Al; (iii) 20 nm Ca/Al; (iv) 4 nm Ti0.5Si0.5Ox/Al; (v) 4 nm TiOx; and (vi) 4 nm SiOx, without light exposure. The current density at −3 V of the PSC with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox, TiOx or SiOx is much lower than those of other PSCs, confirming the better hole-blocking ability of wide band gap sol–gel TimSinOx. SiOx looks better than other TimSinOx although there are only small differences in leakage current. It is in good agreement with the deeper VBM of the higher Si-content TimSinOx. The reason why the difference in leakage between the three oxides is small is probably that the VBM of the oxides are all deep enough already. The photovoltaic performance of the PBDTTT-F-ECB:PC71BM solar cell using TimSinOx with various Si mol% values was also investigated. Fig. 2(d) shows the J–V characteristics under illumination (1 sun) and the efficiency parameters are summarized in Table 1. The interlayer with 50 mol% Si exhibits the highest efficiency with low Rs and high Rp, which verify its high electron collection efficiency and hole-blocking ability, respectively. The low Si mol% (0, 1, 5, 10%) TimSinOx interlayers also give rise to a considerable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance, albeit less than that of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox. The PSC using the SiOx (100 mol% Si) interlayer exhibits improved Voc and FF values compared with that using no interlayer. This indicates that the SiOx interlayer works as an electron-transport and hole-blocking layer. However, Jsc and FF are lower with higher Rs than those of other TimSinOx-fitted PSCs, which is ascribed to the poorer energy-level alignment with PC71BM.

The effects of the optimized Ti0.5Si0.5Ox interlayer on the photovoltaic performance were simply investigated by comparing the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox/Al with the three different cathodes: (i) none/Al; (ii) LiF/Al; and (iii) Ca/Al, in a solar cell based on the PBDTTT-F-ECB:PC71BM BHJ (weight ratio 1:2). The thickness (4 nm) of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox was verified from the cross-sectional TEM image of the PSC employing the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox interlayer, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The presence of Ti and Si in the cathode interlayer was confirmed by the EDS spectrum (Fig. 3(b)) obtained at the point marked with a red open circle in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 4(a) and Table 2 show the J–V characteristics and efficiency parameters of the four different PSCs, respectively. Notably, Jsc of the PSC fitted with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox is significantly higher than the others, as Voc and FF maintain high values. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSC with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox is higher than the others in the measured wavelength range, except from 400 to 480 nm, where the PSC with no interlayer exhibits higher IPCE (Fig. 4(b)). This result is consistent with the higher Jsc of the PSC with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox. The exception might be related to the electric field redistribution or enhancement with the Al-only cathodes in the short wavelength region (400–480 nm) but it is not clear yet (see ESI, Fig. S2†).

To explain such a high Jsc with high IPCE dominating the higher PCE, we measured the total absorption by the active layers of the PSCs. Fig. 4(c) shows the total absorption in the active layer. The higher absorption of the PSC with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox in most wavelength regions is in good agreement with its higher Jsc compared to the PSC with Ca. However, there is no significant difference between the absorption spectra of the PSC with Ti0.5Si0.5Ox and that with no interlayer. A similar absorption spectrum can be expected because of the very thin thickness of the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox layer (∼4 nm). A transparent interlayer acting as an optical spacer between the active layer and the reflective Al electrode redistributes the light in the active layer, thus changing the total absorption when the interlayer is sufficiently thick.5,32,33 The referred results indicate that both the thickness and refractive index are critical for the effectiveness of the optical spacer.34 Considering the two parameters, the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox interlayer is too thin to redistribute the light significantly. This is confirmed by the absorption spectrum obtained from the PSC fitted with LiF.
Because of its thin thickness (1 nm) and similar refractive index (n = 1.39, k = 0)35 to that of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox (n = 1.54, k = 0), the LiF also shows no optical spacer effect. Only the 20 nm thick Ca (n = 0.66, k = 2.6)36 layer affects the light redistribution significantly, but the high loss component k reduces the light intensity in the active layer. Light redistribution by each interlayer reconfirms this conclusion. The electric field distribution was calculated with the use of complex indices of refraction and layer thickness.37Fig. 5 shows the calculated electric field redistribution of 650 nm light for each interlayer; this is not marked in the devices with thin or no interlayers, i.e. (i) 1 nm LiF and (ii) 4 nm Ti0.5Si0.5Ox, while that in the device with 20 nm Ca is remarkable. We can see that the peak position of the electric field does not change considerably with the LiF or Ti0.5Si0.5Ox device, while the peak shift is obvious for the device with 20 nm Ca. In addition, because of the high k (2.55), the peak intensity decreases greatly for the device with Ca. This result is consistent with the results of the total absorption measurements. The difference in Jsc values between the four PSCs cannot be explained with such similar total light absorptions (except for the Ca device). Therefore, in conclusion, the electron collection efficiency of each PSC at the cathode should be considered as a key factor (as discussed above) because the cathode interlayer is the sole difference in the device structure.
 Fig. 5  Calculated electric field intensity of 650 nm light as a function of position in the solar cells fitted with the four different cathodes. The light grey lines (the electric field intensity plot for the Al-only cathode which is the same as that of the lowest panel) are plotted together in the upper three panels for more convenient comparison. 
For verification of the universal effectiveness of the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox interlayer, BHJ solar cells based on PC71BM and three published donor polymers (PTB1,27 PTB7,30 and PBDTTT-CF28) were additionally tested with three types of cathodes: none/Al, Ca/Al, and Ti0.5Si0.5Ox/Al. Improvement in photovoltaic performance induced by the Ti0.5Si0.5Ox interlayer can be also verified for all the additionally tested polymers in spite of their quite different HOMO and LUMO levels. That is because the energy-level alignment needs to be formed only with the LUMO of the acceptor, PC71BM, regardless of the donor polymer (the J–V characteristics of the PSCs fabricated with the given three polymers are provided in the ESI (Fig. S3†)). Furthermore, since the VBM of Ti0.5Si0.5Ox is much deeper than the HOMO of typical organic donor materials, including the polymers tested in this study, we believe Ti0.5Si0.5Ox will be effective for most organic donor materials in BHJ solar cell applications.
The surface energy of TimSinOx was also changed by adjusting the Si mol% (see ESI, Fig. S4†). The surface energy of the cathode interlayer does not impact much on the performance of a PSC in a normal architecture used in this work. However, it does significantly when a BHJ layer is formed on the cathode interlayer in an inverted architecture.24 We believe that this tunable surface energy of TimSinOx may be useful for inverted PSC applications together with its tunable work function.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated enhanced PCE in a PSC fabricated by using a novel method to control the work function of the cathode interlayer to form a cascade energy-level structure from the PC71BM to the cathode. The method utilizes a composition-adjustable ternary oxide, i.e., solution-processed TimSinOx. The work function of TimSinOx could be engineered by adjusting the Si mol% during the sol–gel reaction. The bandgap and valence band maxima of TimSinOx were changed simultaneously, enhancing the hole-blocking ability of TimSinOx. The PCE enhancement is attributed to the higher electron collection efficiency due to the well-aligned energy-level structure and better hole-blocking ability caused by the deeper VBM. The TimSinOx sol–gel film is expected to be effective for most organic donor materials; this was verified with a few other published donor polymers.
