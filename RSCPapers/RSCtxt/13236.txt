    , Accepted 22nd December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was hybridized by hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 spheres via a solvothermal method by mixing the as-prepared g-C3N4 with the precursor of the TiO2 yolk–shell spheres in dimethylformamide (DMF). The introduction of DMF made the TiO2 yolk–shell spheres to be dispersed well on the surface of g-C3N4, thus improving the specific surface area of the materials. The g-C3N4 has a unique two-dimensional layered structure, which is favorable for hybridizing with TiO2. The sufficient contact interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated charges. Multiple reflections of light within the interior cavities of titania microspheres with a yolk–shell structure can increase their light absorption. The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the as-prepared composite TiO2/g-C3N4 (TCN) showed enhanced photocatalytic activities compared with pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. A suitable combination of g-C3N4 with TiO2 produced the highest photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of TCN with a yolk–shell structure is higher than that of TiO2/g-C3N4 without a yolk–shell structure. Based on our experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism with holes and superoxide radical species as the main active species in photocatalysis was proposed. The TCN photocatalysts prepared in this case, with high photocatalytic activity and high stability, were a promising candidate for possible practical application in industrial production.
1. Introduction
Environmental contamination and the energy crisis have become two key issues for human society and seriously threaten the existence of terrestrial lives.1,2 As a promising strategy for environmental remediation, the photocatalytic degradation technique based on semiconductors has been attracting massive research interest.3–5 Moreover, hydrogen is considered as a clean, renewable and attractive energy source. Since the discovery of photocatalytic splitting of water on a TiO2 electrode by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water by utilizing solar energy has become an area of great research interest because of its promising potential to solve the global energy crisis and environmental pollution. As one of the most important semiconducting oxide materials with a number of advantageous characteristics including low cost, non-toxicity and long-term stability, TiO2 has been widely used in bio-separation, sensing, energy storage, solar energy conversion and catalysis.6–17 Recently, much effort has been focused on the design and manipulation of the morphologies of TiO2 materials including mesoporous thin films, spherical particles and porous networks for promoting the performance of the catalysts in solar energy conversion.18–22 Among various morphologies, the anatase TiO2 hollow structure is particularly attractive for the unique properties of low effective density, high specific surface area, good permeation and widespread potential applications in photocatalysis.23 The hollow structures can accommodate a large number of guest molecules or large objects, resulting in further improvement in their performance. Nevertheless, TiO2 has two main drawbacks: one is the low utilization efficiency for solar energy, which takes up about only ∼4% of sunlight due to the wide bandgap of 3.2 eV, and the other is the high recombination rate of photoinduced electrons and holes.24–27 Therefore, designing highly visible-light active TiO2 based photocatalysts with good photogenerated charge separation will be a worldwide striving direction.28 Over the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to modifying TiO2, including energy modulation by doping with nonmetal and metal elements such as N,25 C,29 S,30 B,26 I,27 F,21 P,31 Fe,32 Cr,33 Co,34 Ni35 and Cu,36 construction of heterojunctions by combining TiO2 with other semiconductors such as AgI/TiO2,37 SnS2/TiO2,38 CdS/TiO2,39 Cu2O/TiO2,40 Ag2O/TiO2,41 Fe2O3/TiO2,42 Ag3PO4/TiO2,43 CuInS2/TiO2,44 and BiOCl/TiO2,45 and deposition with noble nanoparticles such as Ag/TiO2,46–49 Au/TiO2 (ref. 50–54) and Pt/TiO2.55–57 Among them, coupling TiO2 with the other semiconductors is the most hot research topic in the past decade and still continues to be a pivotal one to improve the photocatalytic property of the as-prepared photocatalysts.
Recently, a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer with a graphite-like sp2-bonded C–N structure, which is an organic semiconductor with visible-light absorption and high reduction ability, has been explored as a promising candidate for hydrogen evolution and environment purification under visible light irradiation,58–67 due to its peculiar thermal stability, appropriate electronic structure and low cost preparation. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of the pure g-C3N4 is limited by the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.60 Coupling g-C3N4 with other materials such as ZnWO6,68 TaON,67 ZnO,69 BiPO4,70 Ag3PO4,71 Fe2O3,72 SmVO4,73 and MoS2 (ref. 74) is an effective method to increase the photocatalytic property of the pure g-C3N4 because the electron–hole pairs can be efficiently separated, and charge carriers could transfer across the interface of the heterostructure to restrain the recombination. Among abundant semiconductors, TiO2, as a widely used photocatalyst, preferentially acted as a candidate for constructing g-C3N4 based heterojunctions. For example, recently, Zhao75 and co-workers obtained TiO2/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalysts by a facile hydrolysis approach, accompanied by a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity in degradation of phenol under visible irradiation. Yu's76 group reported direct Z-scheme TiO2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performance for the decomposition of formaldehyde in air. A template-free method was presented to fabricate a network structured mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity by Shen and co-workers.77 Very recently, Li's78 group demonstrated that a hybridization of TiO2 with g-C3N4 was successfully performed via a facile calcination in air, showing an activity superior to the component g-C3N4 or TiO2 in methyl orange (MO) degradation, As3+ oxidation and water splitting for hydrogen generation under visible light. However, in many reported TiO2/g-C3N4 systems,28,79 the specific surface areas of the materials are small which limited the actual industrial application. Therefore, it is necessary to explore TiO2/g-C3N4 composites with high specific surface area and excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity for the practical application.
In this work, based on a facile solvothermal method, a series of g-C3N4 modified TiO2 yolk–shell sphere (TCN) hybrid composites were prepared by mixing the as-prepared g-C3N4 with the precursor of TiO2 yolk–shell spheres in dimethylformamide (DMF). The introduction of DMF made the TiO2 yolk–shell spheres to be dispersed well on the surface of g-C3N4, thus improving the specific surface area of the materials. Additionally, multiple reflections of light within the interior cavities of titania microspheres with a yolk–shell structure can increase their light absorption. Therefore, under light or other electromagnetic irradiations, TiO2 yolk–shell spheres would show improved harvesting properties. The g-C3N4 has a unique two-dimensional layered structure, which is favorable for hybridizing with TiO2. The sufficient contact interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated charges. In this way, the TCN composite catalysts have a large surface area, increasing the contract area for the objective reactants. Photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated by studying the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) dyes, antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) and H2 production. The photocatalytic activities of the mainly reported TiO2/g-C3N4 samples were only evaluated through the degradation of simplex dye. It is not sufficient for potential applications in environmental protection and energy crisis. All of our photocatalytic experimental results indicated that TCN composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency than that of pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. The possible photocatalytic mechanism and photostability of the hybrid composites were also investigated. Our strategy presented here may provide a stepping stone toward the design and practical application of other 3D/2D hybrid photocatalysts (like CeO2/graphene, WO3/BN and C60/g-C3N4) in the photocatalytic degradation/reduction of pollution and hydrogen generation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), absolute ethanol (C2H5OH), dimethylformamide (DMF), rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) are of analytical grade and obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was bought from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals used in the experiments were used without further purification. Deionized water was used for all experiments.
2.2. Preparation of g-C3N4
g-C3N4 was synthesized by thermal treatment of 20 g of urea in a crucible with a cover under ambient pressure in air. The precursor was heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a tube furnace for 4 h in air. The resulting final light yellow powder was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol to remove any residual alkaline species adsorbed on the sample surface, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
2.3. Preparation of g-C3N4 modified TiO2 yolk–shell spheres (TCN)
A typical synthesis of TCN composites is shown in the following steps. Firstly, 0.5 mL of TBOT and acetic acid were added into the mixture of DMF and oxalic acid solution (40 mL) under stirring. Secondly, a stoichiometric amount of g-C3N4 was dispersed into the above solution, and then the mixture was stirred and ultrasonicated for 30 min. After that, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 50 mL. The autoclave was then heated at 180 °C for 10 h and cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, the as-prepared samples were separated from the aqueous solution by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol 6 times and dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 333 K overnight to remove the absolute ethanol for the subsequent use and characterization. The weight ratios of g-C3N4 to TiO2 in the composite photocatalysts were 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, respectively (denoted as TCN-0.5, TCN-1.0, TCN-2.0, TCN-3.0 and TCN-4.0).
2.4. Characterization
The crystal structure and phase purity of the prepared samples were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker axs company, Germany) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), employing a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1 in the 2θ range from 20 to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 II, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV to characterize the morphologies and the compositions of the prepared samples. Furthermore, the morphology and particle size of the products were also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which was recorded on a JEOL-JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. The N2 physical absorption measurements were carried out at 77 K with a NOVA2000e analytical system made by Quantachrome Corporation (USA). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy measurements were performed on a UV-2450 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. Raman scattering was obtained at room temperature by using a Thermo Electron Corporation DXR Raman spectrometer (USA) using a 532 nm laser source. A Nicolet NEXUS470 FTIR spectrometer was applied to obtain Fourier transform infrared spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on an ESCALAB MK X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The excitation light employed in recording the fluorescence spectra was 386 nm. The PL spectra of the samples were obtained by using a QuantaMaster & TimeMaster Spectrofluorometer (QuantaMaster™ 40, USA).
2.5. Photocatalytic activity for degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB)
The photocatalytic activities were first evaluated by the decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The pH value was not adjusted when the reaction was conducted. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C with a circulating water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects. The photocatalytic measurement was carried out in an open thermostatic photoreactor. A 350 W Xenon arc lamp with a UV-cutoff filter (420 nm) was positioned 20 cm away from the reactor. Prior to irradiation, a suspension containing 80 mL of 10 mg L−1 RhB/MB solution and 50 mg of a solid catalyst was sonicated for 10 min and then magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to ensure an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. At certain time intervals, 5 mL of the solution was taken out, and centrifuged for subsequent measurement with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu) at the maximal absorption wavelength of RhB and MB, whose characteristic absorption peaks were 554 nm (λRhB) and 664 nm (λMB), respectively. To establish the stability of the photocatalysts, the used TCN was recycled for testing subsequent photocatalytic activities as follows. After a photocatalytic experiment, the TCN photocatalyst was recovered by washing with distilled water three times, drying at 80 °C for 12 h to remove the residual reactant and reactivate the adsorption and catalytic performance. To investigate the active species generated in the photocatalytic degradation process, the experiments of free radical (hydroxyl radical (OH˙), hole (h+) and superoxide radical (O2˙−)) capture were performed by tert-butanol (t-BuOH), ammonium oxalate (AO) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), respectively.
2.6. Photocatalytic activity for degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP)
Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was selected as the other target compound to further evaluate the visible-light photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared TCN photocatalyst. The degradation process is the same as the degradation of RhB. The initial concentration of CIP is 20 mg L−1. The concentration of CIP during the degradation procedure was determined with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu) at λ = 276 nm.
2.7. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was carried out in a 100 mL three necked Pyrex flask at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, and the outlets of the flask were sealed with silicone rubber septa. Four low power UV-LEDs (3 W, 420 nm) (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co. Ltd. China), which were positioned 1 cm away from the reactor in four different directions, were used as light sources to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. The focused intensity and areas on the flask for each UV-LED were ca. 80.0 mW cm−2 and 1 cm2, respectively. The as-prepared sample (50 mg) was dispersed in 80 mL aqueous solution containing 25 vol% methanol for hydrogen evolution. Prior to irradiation, the suspension of the catalyst was dispersed by using an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, and then bubbled with nitrogen through the reactor for 1 h to completely remove the dissolved oxygen and ensure the reactor was in an anaerobic condition. The reaction temperature was kept at about 293 K. During the whole reaction process, vigorous agitation was performed to ensure the uniform irradiation of the photocatalyst suspension. A 0.4 mL gas was intermittently sampled through the septum, and hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, with nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column).
2.8. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in three-electrode quartz cells. Platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrodes (SCEs) were used as the reference electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared photocatalyst film electrodes on ITO served as the working electrode. Working electrodes were prepared as follows: 4 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst was suspended in 2 mL ethanol to produce a slurry, which was then dip-coated onto a 2 cm × 4 cm indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) was prepared by mixing stock standard solutions of Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4, and adjusting the pH with 0.1 mM NaOH or H3PO4, and was used as the supporting electrolyte throughout the photoelectrochemical measurements. A 500 W Xe arc lamp was utilized as the light source in the photoelectrochemical measurements. All electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD patterns of the as-prepared TCN photocatalysts

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared TCN photocatalysts, as well as TiO2 and g-C3N4 in this work. It is easy to observe that the as-prepared sample displays a good crystallinity. The diffraction peaks of TiO2 were consistent with the values in the standard card (JCPDS, no. 21-1272; a = 3.785 Å and c = 9.513 Å). The diffraction peaks with 2θ values of 25.2°, 37.8°, 47.9°, 53.9° and 62.6° corresponded to the (101), (004), (200), (105) and (204) crystal faces of anatase TiO2. The distinct diffraction peaks at 13.0° and 27.4° in the g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic segments, can be indexed to the (100) and (002) peaks for graphitic materials, respectively. All the TCN samples exhibit diffraction peaks corresponding to both TiO2 and g-C3N4. No other characteristic peaks were found, indicating the high purity of the as-prepared samples.

3.2. SEM/EDS and TEM analysis
The morphology and microstructure of samples were investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A show the SEM and TEM images of the pure g-C3N4 sample synthesized by the polymerization reaction of urea, the smooth and flat layers in the pure g-C3N4 sample could be clearly seen, which was consistent with the reported results.78 The as-synthesized pure TiO2 sample was composed of a large number of hierarchical microspheres with diameters ranging from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 2B). The yolk–shell structure of pure TiO2 with a thin/coarse shell and an inner sphere could be observed from the selected individual single particle of the TEM image (Fig. 3B). In addition, the TEM image of pure TiO2 (Fig. 3B) also clearly indicated that the yolk–shell hollow sphere consists of nanosized TiO2. Moreover, a large number of mesopores with a 3D interconnected framework built by nanosized TiO2 building-block particles could be observed on the yolk–shell spheres, which was beneficial to the light-scattering between the nanosized TiO2 as well as their interior hollows. Fig. 2C and D display the SEM images of the as-synthesized composite of TCN-2.0 at different magnifications. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, sphere-like TiO2 samples were successfully attached to the g-C3N4 uniformly. In order to investigate the morphologies of samples with different g-C3N4 contents, the SEM images are given in Fig. S1.† It could be found from the SEM images that more and more g-C3N4 nanosheets were combined with TiO2 spheres when the contents of g-C3N4 increased. And the TiO2 still remained in a sphere-like structure. To further confirm that TiO2 yolk–shell structures were successfully combined with g-C3N4, TEM images of TCN-2.0 are given in Fig. 3C–E. It could be seen from Fig. 3C–E that TiO2 yolk–shell structures and wrinkled two dimensional structures (g-C3N4) were coupled together tightly, indicating that the intimate interfacial contact between the TiO2 yolk–shell microspheres and g-C3N4 nanosheets was readily obtained by such a simple solvothermal approach. The HRTEM (Fig. 3F) image of the TCN-2.0 composite obtained from the TEM image (Fig. 3E) revealed that the lattice fringe spacing of 0.34 nm corresponded to the (101) crystal plane of TiO2.55,60 The EDS pattern (Fig. 2E) indicated that the TCN-2.0 composite contained C, N, O and Ti elements. In order to further investigate the elemental distribution of the TCN-2.0, the elemental mappings of C, N, Ti and O were also performed by EDS area scanning as shown in Fig. 2F. The maps of C, N, Ti and O are well-defined with sharp contrast. In addition, the profile of Ti is similar to that of C and N, which indicates that the Ti elements are distributed uniformly and densely throughout the whole composite. All these results gave solid evidence that TiO2 yolk–shell spheres were successfully combined with g-C3N4.

3.3. FT-IR spectra analysis
In order to determine the presence of g-C3N4, the composition of TCN composites was further characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectrum of pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 4) showed the feature-distinctive stretch modes of aromatic CN heterocycles at 1200–1700 cm−1 together with the breathing mode of the bending vibration of heptazine rings at 808 cm−1, which was consistent with the reported literature studies.60,71 It could be seen that the absorption peak of pure TiO2 at 600 cm−1 was ascribed to the Ti–O stretching mode. For the TCN composites, it could also be clearly seen that the main characteristic peaks of TiO2 and g-C3N4 appeared in TCN composites, suggesting both TiO2 and g-C3N4 existed in the as-prepared composites.
 Fig. 4  FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared TCN photocatalysts, as well as TiO2 and g-C3N4. 
3.4. Raman analysis
Raman spectroscopy was also applied to confirm the structure of TCN. The Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 5. In the case of pure g-C3N4, several weak characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 at 320, 474, 702, 746, 980 and 1229 cm−1 were observed. For pure TiO2, Raman peaks at 146 cm−1 (Eg), 399 cm−1 (B1g), 516 cm−1 (A1g) and 640 cm−1 (Eg) can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase.25 With regard to the TCN composites, both characteristic peaks of TiO2 and g-C3N4 could be clearly observed. Moreover, the characteristic peak for the g-C3N4 (320 and 474 cm−1) shift after the introduction of TiO2 yolk–shell spheres could be observed, which indicated that there was an interaction between g-C3N4 and TiO2. The sufficient contact interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated charges. The Raman result showed that g-C3N4 and TiO2 were successfully coupled together.

3.5. XPS analysis
XPS was obtained to analyze the surface chemical compositions and chemical states of the resultant crystal of TCN. Fig. 6 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s of the as-prepared TCN-2.0. As shown in Fig. 6A, the peak of C 1s binding energies at 284.8 and 288.2 eV could be attributed to sp2 C–C bonds and sp2-bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN), respectively, which were the major carbon species in the g-C3N4. Fig. 6B shows the XPS of TCN-2.0 in the N 1s binding energy regions, and several binding energies can be separated. The main peaks at 398.3, 398.9 eV and 400.5 eV could be ascribed to C–N–C groups, tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups linking structural motif (C6N7) and N–H groups, respectively. The peak at 404.4 eV could be related to the charging effects.60 In the Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 6C), Ti peaks (Ti 2p3/2, binding energy 458.6 eV and Ti 2p1/2, binding energy 464.3 eV) can be attributed to Ti4+.25 The peak observed at 529.9 and 531.7 eV (Fig. 6D) could be ascribed to O 1s in TiO2.

3.6. N2 adsorption–desorption
The textural property of the as-prepared TCN materials was characterized by nitrogen gas porosimetry measurement. Fig. 7 shows the isotherm of the as-prepared samples, which exhibits a type IV with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the mesoporosity of the composites. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of TiO2 yolk–shell spheres was 157 m2 g−1. After coupling with g-C3N4, the BET surface areas of the TCN composites (Table 1) were decreased with the contents of g-C3N4 being increased because g-C3N4 had a relatively low BET surface area (49 m2 g−1). The pore size distribution of the materials was also estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of the isotherm, as shown in Fig. 7B. The monomodal pore-size distribution indicates the mesoporous nature of the synthesized samples. Almost all of the pores have a size smaller than 10 nm. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution of different samples are summarized in Table 1.

3.7. Optical absorption properties
The optical absorption and energy band feature of the photocatalyst are important in determining its photocatalytic efficiency. The light absorption properties were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Fig. 8A depicts the DRS spectra of pure g-C3N4, TiO2 and TCN hybrids. The g-C3N4 was able to absorb light with a wavelength up to 450 nm. The TiO2 absorbed only ultraviolet light with a wavelength shorter than 400 nm. After coupling with g-C3N4 nanosheets, the composites of TCN displayed efficient visible-light absorption from 400 to 500 nm in comparison with the pure TiO2 (Fig. 8A), which indicated that g-C3N4 could act as a visible light sensitizer to drive a reaction on the surface of the TiO2 yolk–shell spheres. In addition, TCN-2.0 has stronger adsorption in the UV-visible range of 200–500 nm than that of the TiO2 (without yolk–shell)/g-C3N4 composite (Fig. S2†), indicating that the yolk–shell structure TiO2 can enhance light harvesting properties under light irradiation. The band-gap energies of the as-prepared materials were calculated by this equation: αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(1)where α, h, ν, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively. The value of the exponent n denotes the nature of the sample transition and is defined to be 4 for a directly allowed transition. According to the previous report, the n values of g-C3N4 (ref. 68) and TiO2 (ref. 60) were both 4. From the plot of (αhν)1/2versus (hν) in Fig. 8B, the Eg values of g-C3N4 and TiO2 were estimated to be 2.7 and 3.1 eV, respectively, close to the values reported in the literature.25,60,68 The Eg values of TCN composites were between 2.7 and 3.1 eV.

3.8. Photocatalytic study of TCN composites

3.8.1. Photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of RhB and photostability. 
The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation was evaluated. Fig. 9A and B show the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples for photodegradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. The initial concentration of the RhB suspension was measured and used as the initial concentration C0. The Y axis is reported as C/C0, where C is the actual concentration of RhB at the indicated reaction time. According to the adsorption–desorption behavior results of photocatalysts without light irradiation, after 1 h adsorption, there was almost no change in the concentration of dye, which indicated that the adsorption–desorption behavior reached an equilibrium. Under visible light illumination, the color of RhB solution changed from red to light red and then disappeared during the reaction. In Fig. 9A, the blank test confirmed that RhB could not be degraded within 150 min under visible light irradiation without catalysts, indicating that RhB was a stable molecule and the photolysis could be ignored. For comparison, RhB photodegradation using P25, TiO2 (yolk–shell) and g-C3N4 photocatalysts was examined. The results demonstrated that 19.2%, 56.6% and 47.1% RhB can be photodegraded by P25, TiO2 (yolk–shell) and g-C3N4 in 150 min, respectively. Obviously, compared to P25, the yolk–shell structured TiO2 spheres showed higher photocatalytic activity because their large specific surface area could provide more catalytic sites. The P25 and bare yolk–shell TiO2 exhibited decolorization activity because of the photosensitization process. As expected, all of the TiO2/g-C3N4 (TCN) photocatalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the pure TiO2 and g-C3N4 samples under visible light irradiation. This might be caused by the formation of the heterostructure between TiO2 and g-C3N4. The photocatalytic activity first increased from TCN-0.5 to TCN-2.0 and, then, gradually decreased with the further increase of g-C3N4 content. It could be clearly observed that when the mass ratio of TiO2 and g-C3N4 is 1:2, the as-prepared TCN-2 composites exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity, resulting in 99.3% degradation ratio of RhB within 150 min of visible light irradiation. This result proved that too much g-C3N4 in the heterojunction would create an unsuitable ratio between TiO2 and g-C3N4, thus reducing the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction. As the g-C3N4 content increased, the visible light absorption of TCN strengthened and generated more electron–hole pairs, and more TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were formed, contributing to the separation of electron–hole pairs. However, when the g-C3N4 content was above the optimal value, the efficient heterojunction interface would not increase obviously whereas the narrow bandgap g-C3N4 could be acted as the recombination center of electrons and holes. Consequently, the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs decreased and further restrained the photocatalytic activity. In addition, to investigate the role of the yolk–shell structure of TiO2, comparison of photocatalytic activities between TCN-2.0 and TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 composites is listed in the ESI Table S1.† The detailed discussion is performed in the following kinetic study.
 Fig. 9  Photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples for photodegradation of RhB under visible light irradiation (A and B); the possibility of recycling the obtained photocatalyst (C); the influence of various scavengers on the visible-light photocatalytic activity of TCN-2.0 towards the degradation of RhB (D). 
Significant differences in the photocatalytic behaviors were observed, and the photodegradation process was fit to pseudo-first-order kinetics in which the value of rate constant k is equal to the corresponding slope of the fitting line. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model has been widely applied for the analysis of heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation kinetics of pollutants in the aqueous phase: (2)where r0 is the initial reaction rate (mg L−1 min−1), C is the concentration of pollutants (mg L−1), t is the reaction time (min), k is the Langmuir–Hinshelwood reaction rate constant (mg L−1 min−1) and K is the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant (L mg−1). At a dilute concentration of pollutants, the pseudo-first-order kinetics model could be assumed as shown in eqn (3) and (4): (3) (4)where kapp is the apparent rate constant (min−1), and C0 is the initial concentration of pollutants (mg L−1). The pseudo-first-order rate constants over P25, TiO2 yolk–shell spheres, g-C3N4, TCN-0.5, TCN-1.0, TCN-2.0, TCN-3.0 and TCN-4.0 are 0.0015, 0.0057, 0.0041, 0.0173, 0.0244, 0.0335, 0.0271 and 0.0111 min−1, respectively. These results indicated that k values for all heterojunction structures are higher than those of pure substances. In addition, the photoactivity of TCN-2.0 is also higher than that of many reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. Comparison of the results is shown in the ESI (Table S1†). Also, the photocatalytic activity of TCN-2.0 prepared in this case is higher than that of many reported TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 composites (Table S1†). Moreover, in our previous report,67 TiO2 without the yolk–shell structure combined with g-C3N4 was prepared and the RhB photo-degradation rate (0.016 min−1) was lower than that of TCN-2.0 (0.0335 min−1).
It is worth pointing out that stabilizing the photocatalyst is a crucial but difficult task owing to the leakage of the individual components for the photocatalytic applications in aqueous solution. Taking TCN-2.0 as the representative photocatalyst, the regeneration and reusability of TCN-2.0 were investigated. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity even after four consecutive runs (Fig. 9C) suggesting that the as-prepared composites showed high catalytic stability, performing as genuine heterogeneous visible-light-driven photocatalysts for the treatment of organic contaminants in wastewater. The high stability can be attributed to the unique heterogeneous structure formed in 2D g-C3N4 nanosheet/3D TiO2 yolk–shell spheres.


3.8.2. Detection of primary active species during the photocatalytic process. 
In order to further reveal the photocatalytic mechanism of TCN composites, the trapping experiments were performed to determine the main active species in the photocatalytic process. It is generally accepted that the hydroxyl radical (OH˙) and hole (h+) as well as the superoxide radical (O2˙−) are the main reactive oxidative species in photocatalytic degradation reactions. Fig. 9D displays the influence of various scavengers on the visible-light photocatalytic activity of TCN towards the degradation of RhB. The degradation efficiency of RhB was decreased slightly upon the addition of t-BuOH, suggesting that OH˙ is not the main active species for the degradation of RhB. As for the AO-photocatalysis system, the degradation rate was inhibited to some extent, indicating h+ was the active species that was responsible for the degradation of RhB. Importantly, when 1 mmol BQ was added to the reaction system, the degradation of RhB was remarkably prohibited, indicating that O2˙− should be another main active species occurring in the RhB degradation process.


3.8.3. Photodegradation of MB and CIP. 
MB was chosen as a different type of model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the TCN composite. The experimental results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of TCN-2.0 for the photodegradation of MB was also much higher than that of pure substances (Fig. 10A). The photocatalytic decomposition rate of MB over the TCN-2.0 was 5.8 and 1.8 times the activity over TiO2 hollow spheres and g-C3N4 (Fig. 10B). The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 towards the degradation of MB was also investigated. The photocatalytic activity of TCN-2.0 was also higher than that of TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4.
 Fig. 10  Photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples for photodegradation of MB (A and B) and CIP (C and D) under visible light irradiation. 
Antibiotic drug CIP was widely used for treating bacterial infections. It is widely found in aquatic environments, which may pose a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health by inducing proliferation of bacterial drug resistance. Therefore, it is significant for the degradation of CIP. As shown in Fig. 10C, apparently, it could be observed that TCN-2.0 photocatalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure TiO2 hollow spheres and g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. After 150 min of visible light irradiation, the removal efficiency of CIP was 53.5, 19.4 and 97.3% for TiO2 hollow spheres, g-C3N4 and TCN-2.0, respectively. The k value for TCN-2.0 was 0.0192 min−1, which was almost 3.4 and 14.8 times as high as that of pristine TiO2 hollow spheres (0.0056 min−1) and pure g-C3N4 nanosheets (0.0013 min−1), respectively. Likewise, the TCN-2.0 showed higher photodegradation activity than that of TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4, undoubtedly. All these experimental results indicated that both the heterojunctions between TiO2 and g-C3N4 and the unique yolk–shell structure of TiO2 have important influence on the photocatalytic activity of TCN composites. As a result, the dramatic photocatalytic activity of the TCN composite lets the TCN photocatalysts to become a useful photocatalytic composite for potential application in environmental management.


3.8.4. Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. 
H2 is considered as a clean, renewable and attractive energy source to substitute for fossil fuels. To this end, the H2-production experiment was further carried out to investigate the accurate photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples. The H2 evolution experiments were performed by taking 80 mL of a 25 vol% methanol solution and 50 mg of the photocatalyst. Before the actual photocatalytic experiment was performed, reference experiments were performed by taking a pure methanol solution in the absence of either the photocatalyst or irradiation. H2 formation was not observed in the control experiment without light irradiation or the photocatalyst, which indicated that the generation of H2 resulted from the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts, and not from other effects.67 As shown in Fig. 11, the pure g-C3N4 sample only showed a H2 generation rate of 0.18 μmol h−1. This is probably due to the rapid recombination between electrons and holes, and the fast backward reaction. There was no catalytic activity for pure TiO2 yolk–shell hollow spheres because they could not absorb visible light. After loading a little g-C3N4 (TCN-0.5), a small quantity of H2 could be observed. The photocatalytic activity of the TCN composites increased with increasing the g-C3N4 content from 1/3 (TCN-0.5) to 2/3 (TCN-2.0), and decreased when the g-C3N4 content was higher than 2/3 (TCN-2.0). The TCN-2.0 photocatalyst had the highest H2-production activity (5.6 μmol h−1), which was 31.1 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. In addition, the hydrogen production rate of TCN-2.0 was also higher than that of many reported g-C3N4 based catalysts, which is summarized in the ESI (Table S2†). This result was consistent with the RhB/MB degradation experiment results. Additionally, the TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 composite with the same mass ratio to TCN-2.0 was prepared. The H2 production rate of TCN-2.0 (5.6 μmol h−1) was also higher than that of TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 (1.3 μmol h−1). The apparent quantum yield of the TCN-2.0 photocatalyst was determined to be 3.25% at 420 nm. A slight decrease in the H2 production rate for all of the as-prepared photocatalysts in three cycling tests was observed, while showing the similar trend as in the first time, indicating their high stability and photocatalytic activity throughout the testing cycles.

3.9. Photoluminescence spectroscopy
Based on the above experimental results, it could be believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity was partly ascribed to the interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes between g-C3N4 and TiO2, which led to effective charge separation on both components.80 This assumption was supported by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The intensity of the PL spectrum is a direct measurement of the electron–hole recombination rate, because the faster the recombination occurs, the more intense the spectrum is. Herein, the suitable PL measurement for g-C3N4 and TCN composites was performed. Fig. 12 shows that at an excitation wavelength of 386 nm, pure g-C3N4 exhibits a strong emission peak centered at 460 nm, which could be attributed to the band–band PL phenomenon with the energy of light approximately equal to the energy gap of g-C3N4 (2.7 eV). Actually, the band–band PL signal is attributed to excitonic PL, which mainly results from the n–π* electronic transitions involving lone pairs of nitrogen atoms in g-C3N4.80 Obviously, after the formation of TCN composites, the position of the emission peak in the PL spectra of TCN was similar to that of the pure g-C3N4, but the emission intensity significantly decreased, which indicated that the TCN composites had a much lower recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers. This result was consistent with the photocatalytic experiment. To better understand the photophysical behavior of the photoexcited charge carriers, the photoluminescence decay profiles of pure g-C3N4, TiO2 and TCN-2.0 were also recorded. The decay spectra of these three samples are shown in Fig. 12B. These spectra were all well fitted by single-exponential decay models. The average decay time of the bare TiO2, g-C3N4 and TCN-2.0 was detected to be 0.83, 1.92 and 2.42 ns, respectively. Obviously, compared with pure TiO2 and g-C3N4, TCN-2.0 showed a longer lifetime. The prolonged lifetime originated from the formation of TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, which effectively reduced the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.81 This result was consistent with the aforementioned comparison of the rate of degradation of pollutants and generation of H2 among bare TiO2, g-C3N4 and TCN-2.0. All these findings confirmed that the formation of the TiO2/g-C3N4 heterostructure remarkably promoted charge transfer efficiency, thereby favoring the photocatalytic reactions.

3.10. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements are often used to qualitatively study the excitation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in photocatalysis. To understand the photogenerated charge separation and electron transfer performance between TiO2 and g-C3N4, the transient photocurrent responses of the as-prepared material electrodes were recorded for several on–off cycles of light irradiation. Photocurrent over time was detected on visible-light illumination at a bias potential of +0.1 V vs. SCE with the measured solution pH of 7.4. The higher photocurrent intensity often leads to better photocatalytic activity. Fig. 13 compares the I–t curves of TiO2 and TiO2/g-C3N4 samples and a good reproducibility of photocurrent was observed. The photocurrent value of pure TiO2 increased about 2.5 times after combining with g-C3N4, indicating that charge separation in the photo-electrochemical process had been promoted, confirming that more active catalytic sites and reaction centers could improve the photocatalytic activity, which was in accordance with the photocatalytic activity results. In addition, the current was steady within the whole illumination period, further implying that the as-prepared photocatalysts were stable during the photocatalytic process.

3.11. Possible photocatalytic mechanism of the TCN composites
According to our previous study,67 the band gap of g-C3N4 was estimated to be 2.7 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) potentials of g-C3N4 were −1.2 and +1.5 eV, respectively. The g-C3N4 with this electronic structure possesses an excellent photo-response, which could be easily excited and engender the corresponding photogenerated electron–hole pairs under the visible light irradiation. In addition, the layered structure of g-C3N4 is beneficial to the transfer of electrons. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV) were determined at −0.3 and +2.9 eV, respectively. The unique yolk–shell structure of TiO2 resulted in multiple reflections of visible light within the interior cavity, allowing the light source to be used more efficiently. On the basis of related literature work and the above experimental results including physicochemical properties, photocatalytic properties, photoelectrochemical properties as well as the identified active species, a possible visible light mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of TCN was proposed. As shown in Fig. 14, g-C3N4 could produce photogenerated electron–hole pairs, when the TCN composites were irradiated with visible light. The photogenerated electrons of g-C3N4 tend to transfer to the yolk–shell structure of TiO2. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes of g-C3N4 were left in the g-C3N4 due to the more positive VB edge of the TiO2. Thus, this system led to charge separation and effective prolongation of the charge carrier lifetime, which in accordance with the results of the PL (Fig. 12B) and photocurrent analysis (Fig. 13). The separated electrons on the CB of TiO2 could be donated to an electron acceptor such as dissolved oxygen leading to the formation of O2˙−, which was responsible for the degradation and mineralization of organic in aqueous solution (or directly reduce water to H2). The holes left on the VB of g-C3N4 can subsequently oxidize the electron donor (CH3OH for H2 production) and degrade pollutants directly. As such, effective charge separation can be achieved, resulting in a longer lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers and thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance as compared to pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. Moreover, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TCN composites also could be attributed to the unique yolk–shell structure of TiO2 since the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (with yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4 is higher than that of TiO2 (without yolk–shell structure)/g-C3N4. As a result, the improvement of visible light photocatalytic activity of TCN can be ascribed to the following factors:
 Fig. 14  The separation and transfer of photogenerated charges in TCN photocatalysts combined with the possible reaction mechanism. 
(1) The improvement of charge separation derived from the heterojunction between TiO2 and g-C3N4 facilitated the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
(2) Yolk–shell of TiO2 structures with a relatively high surface area can provide abundant active reaction sites. In addition, multiple reflections of light in the interior cavities of the yolk–shell structure TiO2 can enhance light harvesting properties under light irradiation, which is beneficial for the efficient use of the light source and thereby increase the quantity of photogenerated electron–hole pairs available to take part in the photocatalytic reaction.
4. Conclusions
In summary, novel carbon nitride modified hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 sphere photocatalysts were facilely fabricated by a one-step solvothermal process. The as-prepared TCN composite showed tremendous enhancements in the photocatalytic degradation activity of RhB, MB and CIP and H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation due to the synergic effects of their unique yolk–shell structure, good light harvesting properties and low recombination rate of electron–hole pairs at the intimate interface of heterojunctions. Furthermore, the proposed mechanisms for the photocatalytic degradation process were investigated. Both h+ and O2˙− played major roles whereas OH˙ can be negligible. Moreover, the heterojunction depicted a good stability that no apparent deactivation of the photocatalyst was observed after four cycles. This work provided a facile and efficient way to design hierarchical 3D/2D heterostructured photocatalysts.
