    , Accepted 18th November 2014First published on 17th December 2014AbstractThe highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (9.61%) for a quasi-solid-state DSSC (QS-DSSC) based on a low molecular mass organogelator (LMOG) is achieved using N,N′-1,5-pentanediylbis-dodecanamide as a LMOG in conjunction with a TiO2 photoanode of sub-microspheres sensitized with a high-absorptivity Ru complex (C101). The competition of interfacial kinetic processes between the recombination of the dye cations with photoinjected electrons and the regeneration of the dye cations by I− is investigated by transient adsorption measurements. The data revealed that there is an efficient interfacial charge separation at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and the dye is rapidly regenerated, which contributes to the high photocurrent. Furthermore, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and controlled intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), it is determined that the negative shift of TiO2 conduction band edge of the QS-DSSC contributes to the high Voc. Moreover, the QS-DSSC exhibits significantly improved stability during the accelerated thermal and light-soaking test. During the accelerated aging test, there is almost no change in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) in the QS-DSSC, while the Jsc of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC decreases sharply. These results are very important for the application and commercialization of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
As a promising next-generation device and important solution to energy depletion and environmental pollution, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable academic and industrial attention owing to their potential to achieve high photoelectric conversion efficiency and competitive costs.1–3 Recently, the liquid electrolyte based DSSC has achieved the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 13%.4 However, many undesirable properties, such as leaking and evaporation of the liquid electrolyte, significantly affect the long-term stability, which is crucial for the application and commercial production of DSSCs. In order to overcome these drawbacks, tremendous efforts have been devoted to replace the conventional liquid electrolyte with a solid or quasi-solid-state electrolyte using p/n-type inorganic semiconductors,5,6 organic hole transport materials,7,8 or polymer electrolytes.9,10 However, the DSSCs based on these materials still exhibit relatively lower performance compared to liquid electrolyte based DSSCs due to the poor carrier transport or low ion diffusion.11,12 Low molecular mass organogelators (LMOGs) can effectively immobilize a large number of organic solvents with a small weight percent.13 Compared with the solid-state or polymer electrolytes, the gel electrolytes formed from the LMOGs exhibit three dimensional networks and possess higher ionic conductivity, good pore filling and penetration of the mesoporous TiO2 film.14–16 Moreover, the devices assembled by LMOGs exhibit good long-term stability, which is exciting for academia and industry.17,18 As Voss et al. reported, 12-hydroxystearic acid could be used as a LMOG to gelate the ionic liquid 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide.19 In addition, Tan et al. have also used bis(4-octanoylaminophenyl) ether, bis(4-octanoylaminophenyl) methane and 2,4-bis(octanureido) toluene to gelate ionic liquid, and they found that the electrochemical properties of the ionic liquid gels were similar to those of the pure ionic liquid.20 Furthermore, other LMOGs have been developed and successfully applied in DSSCs, and good photoelectric conversion efficiency has been obtained. Examples include 12-hydroxystearic acid (5.36%),21 cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-[4-(3-octadecylureido)phenyl]amide (9.1%),16 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (6.3–7.5%),18 tetradodecylammonium bromide (5.35%)22 and 1,3:2,4-di-O-benzylidene-d-sorbitol derivatives (6.1%).17 Based on these LMOGs, the long-term stability of DSSCs has been improved from 77–91% to 95–100% after the accelerated aging test.
In our previous work,23 we synthesized a series of LMOGs with distinct self-assembly behaviors and applied them in the quasi-solid-state DSSC (QS-DSSC). It is interesting that the molecular structures can influence the self-assembly of the LMOGs, the kinetic processes of electron transport and recombination and the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs. It is found that the QS-DSSCs based on LMOGs, containing odd –CH2– between the two amide carbonyl groups in the molecular structure, achieved better efficiency. Hence, we chose a LMOG, N,N′-1,5-pentanediylbis-dodecanamide, which has a structure optimized to gelate the acetonitrile based liquid electrolyte to obtain an excellent device. Moreover, a Ru sensitizer, (cis-bis(isothiocyanate)) (4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) (4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) sodium (C101) with a high molar extinction coefficient and TiO2 sub-microspheres with dual functions of high dye loading and efficient light-trapping were also introduced into the QS-DSSC. Consequently, the QS-DSSC exhibited a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.61%, which is to date the best reported photoelectric conversion efficiency of the QS-DSSCs based on LMOGs. The kinetic processes of electron transport, electron recombination, ionic diffusion, as well as the photovoltaic performance and light-soaking stability of this QS-DSSC were investigated in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Liquid and gel electrolyte preparation
The LMOG, N,N′-1,5-pentanediylbis-dodecanamide, was synthesized according to the ESI (Fig. S1†). 1,2-Methyl-3-propylimidazoliumiodide (DMPII) was prepared as previously reported.24 The liquid electrolyte for DSSCs was composed of 1 mol L−1 DMPII, 0.08 mol L−1 anhydrous lithium iodide (LiI: 99%, Aldrich), 0.1 mol L−1 iodine (I2: 99%, Aldrich) and 0.9 mol L−1tert-butyl pyridine (TBP: 99%, Aldrich) in acetonitrile (ACN: 99%, Fluka). Gel electrolyte was prepared by adding 5 wt% N,N′-1,5-pentanediylbis-dodecanamide (vs. liquid electrolyte) into the liquid electrolyte and heated with stirring until the gelator melted. Then, it was cooled to room temperature and the gel electrolyte was formed.
2.2. Synthesis of mesoporous titania
TiO2 sub-microspheres were synthesized by a two-step process: hydrolysis and subsequent solvothermal treatment as described in the previous literature.25
2.3. Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The TiO2 sub-microsphere electrodes about 11.5 μm thickness were obtained by screen-printing TiO2 sub-microspheres paste on FTO glass (TEC-8, LOF). After sintering at 450 °C for 30 min in air, and then cooling to 120 °C, the nanoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes were immersed in an ethanol solution of 0.3 mmol L−1 C101 for 14 h. The platinum counter electrodes were obtained by spraying H2PtCl6 solution onto FTO glass followed by heating at 410 °C for 20 min. The DSSCs were assembled by sealing the dyed nanoporous TiO2 photoelectrode and the counter electrode with a thermal adhesive film (Surlyn 1702, Dupont, USA). The liquid electrolyte was injected into the internal space between the two electrodes through a hole on the counter electrode, which was later sealed by a cover glass and thermal adhesive film. The gel electrolyte was heated to 90 °C under stirring until the gel completely transform to liquid. Then, the electrolyte (hot solution) was rapidly injected into the cell and the cell was sealed in the same manner as the liquid electrolyte based DSSC. After cooling to room temperature, a uniform motionless gel layer was formed in the cell.
2.4. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
The gel to solution transition temperature (Tgel) of the gel electrolyte was determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-Q2000, TA, USA). Approximately 5–7 mg of the sample was weighed, sealed in an aluminum pan and heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow from 25 to 110 °C for DSC measurement.
2.5. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6330F, JEOL, Japan) was used to investigate the morphology of the gel. The xerogel sample was prepared by drying the gel (5 wt% gelator in ACN) at ambient temperature.
2.6. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements
Linear sweep voltammograms were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) at 25 °C in a two-electrode system equipped with a 5.0 μm platinum ultramicroelectrode (CHI107, CH Instruments Inc., USA) as the working electrode, a 1 mm radius platinum disk electrode (CHI102, CH Instruments Inc., USA) as the counter electrode and a reference electrode.26 The linear sweep voltammograms were obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
2.7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement
EIS measurements of DSSCs were recorded with an electrochemical analyzer (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland). To measure the impedance, a direct-current bias at 730 mV, and perturbation amplitude of 10 mV within the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 mHz was applied in darkness. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Z-view software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates, USA) in terms of a transmission line equivalent circuit model to interpret the characteristics of DSSCs.27 EIS values measured at different DC biases is illustrated in Fig. S2 in ESI.†
2.8. Controlled intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) measurements
The experimental set-up for IMPS and IMVS measurements has been described elsewhere.28,29 Intensity-modulated measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (IM6e, Zahner, Germany) with light emitting diodes (LED) (λ = 610 nm) driven by a source supply (XPOT, Zahner, Germany). The LED provided both the dc and ac components of the illumination. The small ac component was 10% or less than that of the dc component and the frequency range was 3 kHz to 300 mHz.
2.9. Transient adsorption spectra measurement
Transient adsorption spectra were obtained using a laser flash spectrophotometer (LP920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. Scotland) in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable laser (OPOLette 355II. Opotek, Inc., CA). The probe light from a pulsed xenon arc lamp was passed through various optical elements and a monochromator before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a digital signal analyzer (TDS 3012C, Tektronix, USA).
2.10. Characterization of incidental photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE)
The photocurrent action spectra were recorded on a QE/IPCE measurement kit consisting of a 300 W xenon lamp (69911, Newport, USA), a 1/4 m monochromator (74125 Oriel Cornerstone 260, Newport, USA), a dual channel power meter (2931-C, Newport, USA) and the calibrated UV silicon photodetector (71675, Newport, USA).
2.11. Photovoltaic characterizations and stability tests
The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with an active area of 0.16 cm2 with a black mask were measured by a Keithley 2420 digital source meter (Keithley, USA) and controlled by Test point software under a 450 W xenon lamp (Orial, USA) with a filter (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell before each experiment. Hermetically sealed cells were used for long-term stability tests. The successive one sun light soaking experiment was carried out. DSSCs covered with a UV cutoff filter (up to 394 nm) were irradiated at the open circuit under one sun light soaking (XQ3000, 100 mW cm−2, Shanghai B.R. Science Instrument Co., Ltd, China) and the ambient temperature was set to 50 °C during the light soaking experiment. J–V measurements were carried out at room temperature after allowing these cells to cool down and equilibrate for 30 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of TiO2 sub-microspheres

Fig. 1(a) shows the morphologies of the as-prepared sub-micrometer sized TiO2 beads. As can be seen, the beads were microspheric particles with a diameter around 800 nm. According to previous reports,25,30,31 the TiO2 sub-microspheres have dual functions of a high surface area for dye loading and a rough surface for light multi-scattering, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Moreover, the TiO2 sub-microspheres can increase the length of the electrolyte diffusion path and promote charge transport.33 Therefore, high dye loading, efficient light-trapping and electron transport can contribute to the high photoelectric conversion efficiency of QS-DSSCs.

3.2. Gelation studies of the LMOG based gel electrolyte
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed to characterize the morphology of the gel electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the xerogel exhibits a good network, which was formed by the hydrogen bonds between –NH and CO groups, as well as the van der Waals force among the long hydrocarbon chains of the molecules. This microporous framework indicated that the gel electrolyte has the strong property of imbibing liquid electrolyte and good thermo-stability, which is reflected by the high transition temperature of gel phase to liquid phase (Tgel). As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), the Tgel of the as-prepared gel electrolyte is 80.5 °C. This relatively higher Tgel can make the gel electrolyte maintain a gel state at the DSSC's operating temperature and contribute to the long-term stability of DSSCs.

3.3. The ion diffusion and electron recombination behavior
The diffusion of redox couple (I3− and I−) ions in the electrolyte is an important factor for DSSC performance and can be expressed by the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp).32 In order to investigate the behavior of I3− and I− in the gel electrolyte, linear sweep voltammetric measurement was carried out. As can be seen in Fig. 3, before reaching the steady-state condition, there are differences between both electrolytes. This phenomenon may result from the different capacitances between the liquid and gel electrolytes. When the system reached the steady-state condition, the lower plateau steady-state limiting current (ISS) refers to the electrochemical reduction of I3−, and the upper plateau ISS reflects the electrochemical oxidation of I−. The Dapp of I3− and I− can be calculated from eqn (1), and the values are listed in Table 1: ISS = 4nrcFDapp(1)where n is the electron number in the electrode reaction, F is the Faraday constant, c is the bulk concentration of the redox species, and r is the radius of the Pt ultramicroelectrode. From Table 1, we can see that the Dapp values of I3− and I− in the gel electrolyte are slightly lower than those in the liquid electrolyte, which indicates that the three-dimensional network formed from this LMOG can provide good transport channels for I3−/I− redox coupling, despite the solid nature of the gel electrolyte.

The effect of the gel electrolyte on the kinetic process at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface of DSSCs is investigated by EIS. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots for the gel and liquid electrolytes, and the experimental data were fitted by the equivalent circuits, which are also displayed in Fig. 4. Typically, the intercept on the real axis in the high frequency range is associated with the series resistance (Rs) of the electrolytes and electrical contacts in the DSSCs. The first semi-circle (high frequency, 100–50 kHz) corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (RCE) at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface, and the second semi-circle in the middle frequency (50–1 kHz) is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Moreover, the electron recombination in the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface can also be reflected by the recombination lifetime (τoc) and be calculated by eqn (2): τoc = RctCμ(2)where Cμ is the capacitance of TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.33,34 All of these parameters can be derived from the EIS analysis and are listed in Table 2. As can be seen, the Rs and RCE slightly change after the liquid electrolyte is gelated by the LMOG, whereas the Rct of the gel electrolyte is smaller than that of liquid electrolyte, as well as the τoc, which indicated that a faster electron recombination process between the injected electrons and the I3− in the gel electrolyte occurred. This can be attributed to the different I3− diffusion rates from the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface to the Pt counter electrode, and the difference in electron recombination processes may have a negative influence on the Voc of the QS-DSSC.

3.4. Shift of TiO2 conduction band edge
The TiO2 conduction band edge is undeniably a decisive factor to the open circuit voltage (Voc) and determines the electron injection efficiency (φinj), which is vital for the photocurrent of DSSCs. It is well known that the adsorption of Li+ from the electrolyte on the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 film can result in a positive shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge.35,36 On the other hand, the Li+ can interact with the amide carbonyl groups of the gelators,37,38 which leads to a decrease in the adsorption of Li+ onto the TiO2 surface, causing a negative shift in the TiO2 conduction band edge. As can be seen in Fig. 5, in comparison with the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, an approximately 50 mV upward shift of the conduction band edge is observed in the QS-DSSC based on LMOG. This negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge could lead to an improved Voc and a decreased φinj.36,39

3.5. The electron transport and electron recombination by IMVS/IMPS
In order to further understand the kinetics of electron transport in the photoelectrode and electron recombination at the TiO2 photoelectron/electrolyte interface for the QS-DSSC, IMVS/IMPS measurements have been applied to obtain the electron kinetic plots of both devices (shown in Fig. 6). Generally, Li+ can increase the amount of surface traps of mesoporous TiO2 film and deepen the surface state energy distribution on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 films, which leads to deceleration of the electron transport and charge recombination.40,41 As a result, both the electron transport times (τd) and electron recombination lifetime (τn) of the QS-DSSC are shorter compared to those of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). To estimate the competition between electron transport in the TiO2 photoanode and electron recombination for the DSSCs based on different electrolytes, the electron average diffusion length (Ln) and electron collection efficiencies (ηcoll) were calculated using eqn (3) and (4), respectively:42,43 (3) (4)where d is the TiO2 layer thickness, which is 11.5 μm in this work. As can be seen in Fig. 6(c), Ln values for both the liquid electrolyte based DSSC and QS-DSSC are notably higher compared to the TiO2 layer thickness, which indicates that the effective collection of charge carriers can be achieved in both devices. Moreover, from Fig. 6(d), it can be seen that the ηcoll for the QS-DSSC is comparable to that of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, which will also contribute to the photocurrent.

3.6. Transient adsorption spectra analysis
Transient adsorption spectra were obtained to investigate the recombination between the photo-oxidized dye molecular (S+) and the photoinjected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 (ecb−), and the interception of S+ by iodide in the electrolyte44,45 (Shown in Fig. 7(a)). As can be seen in Fig. 7 (b), a broad negative signal arises in the visible region between 400 and 650 nm of the transient absorption spectrum, which can be allocated to the photobleaching of ground-state dye molecules. In addition, the positive absorption change in the visible region between 650 and 900 nm is allocated to the electronic excitation of S+. Therefore, the excitation wavelength of 540 nm and a probe wavelength of 750 nm were chosen to obtain the decay trace of S+. In the absence of electrolyte, the injected conduction band electrons are recaptured by the S+, and this is reflected by the trace 1 as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). This decay trace can be fitted with the single exponential decay in eqn (5), and the lifetime (τb) was obtained as 3.6 μs. OD(Δt) = A0 + A1e−Δt/τ(5)
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic of the recombination between the S+ and the photoinjected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 (ecb−), and the reduction of S+ by iodide in electrolyte; (b) the transient adsorption change of dyed TiO2 film in ACN; and (c and d) the transient absorbance decay kinetics of the oxidized state of S+ adsorbed on transparent TiO2 nanocrystalline films in (1) ACN, (2) the liquid electrolyte with redox species and (3) the gel electrolyte with redox species. 
In the presence of the electrolyte with redox species (I−/I3−), the S+ can be regenerated by the ecb− or by the I− in the electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d), the absorbance decays of the oxidized dye molecules were accelerated due to the S+ being regenerated by both I− in the electrolytes and the ecb− in the TiO2 conduction band. Moreover, the fitted lifetime (τr) of the S+ in the presence of liquid electrolyte (trace 2) and gel electrolyte (trace 3) are 97 ns and 117 ns, respectively. Although the kinetic process of dye regeneration is dissimilar, the kinetic branch ratios of τb/τr are over 30 for both liquid and gel electrolytes, which implies that for both electrolytes, the charges can be effectively separated at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and the dye can be rapidly regenerated, which contributes to the high photocurrent output.
3.7. Photovoltaic performance of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the DSSCs with different electrolytes are given in Fig. 8. The IPCE is a product of light-harvesting efficiency (ηlh), electron injection efficiency (φinj), and electron collection efficiency (ηcoll), as shown in eqn (6):46 IPCE = ηlhφinjηcoll(6)
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on liquid and gel electrolytes. 
The ηlh is determined by the loading and extinction coefficient of the dye and is regarded to be the same for both DSSCs in this work in consideration of the same adsorption capacity at dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode. With the addition of LMOG into the liquid electrolyte, a slight decrease in IPCE can be observed in Fig. 8, which arises from the decreased φinj.

Fig. 9 shows the typical J–V curves at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) for the DSSCs based on liquid and gel electrolytes. The photovoltaic performances of open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 3. As can be seen, there is almost no change in Voc for the QS-DSSC, which is mainly attributed to the negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge, although electron recombination at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface is slightly increased in comparison with the liquid electrolyte based DSSC.47 The Jsc for the QS-DSSC is also very close to the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, which can be explained by the slightly change in IPCE in comparison with the liquid electrolyte based DSSC.48 Consequently, the QS-DSSC shows an impressive efficiency of 9.61%, which is comparable to that of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC (9.84%).

3.8. Stability of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using LMOGs
The QS-DSSC exhibits excellent stability during the process of accelerated aging test, as well as high performance. Fig. 10 shows the normalized efficiency variation of both DSSCs based on liquid electrolyte and gel electrolyte under successive one sun light soaking with a UV cut-off filter at 50 °C for 1000 h. As can be seen, after the continuous accelerated aging, the efficiency of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC degraded by nearly 30% of its initial efficiency, whereas the QS-DSSC retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of the accelerated aging test. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the degradation of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC mainly results from the reduction of Jsc with nearly constant FF and little decrease in Voc. Especially, the Jsc of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC lost nearly 30% of its initial value, whereas the Jsc of the QS-DSSC showed little change. These accelerated aging results revealed that the QS-DSSC is more stable than the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, which is caused by the improved intrinsic stability of the gel electrolyte formed from the LMOG.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a gel electrolyte with a relatively high Tgel (80.5 °C) was formed by the self-assembly of N,N′-1,5-pentanediylbis-dodecanamide as an efficient LMOG in an acetonitrile based liquid electrolyte. The three-dimensional network formed from this LMOG provides good transport channels for I3−/I− redox coupling. Moreover, the high-absorptivity C101 dye-sensitizer and TiO2 sub-microspheres with dual functions of high dye loading and efficient light-trapping were used in conjunction with this highly ion conductive gel electrolyte to contribute to the high efficiency of the QS-DSSC. Compared with the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, the QS-DSSC exhibits a negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge and a slightly increased electron recombination at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, which lead to almost no change in Voc for the QS-DSSC. On the other hand, the Jsc for the QS-DSSC is also very close to that of the liquid electrolyte based DSSC, which is caused by the similar IPCE in comparison with the liquid electrolyte based DSSC. The transient adsorption spectra reveal that the charges can be effectively separated at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and the oxidized dye can be rapidly regenerated to decrease the electron recombination between the oxidized dye and the photoinjected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 for the QS-DSSC, which contributes to the high photocurrent output of the device. Consequently, the QS-DSSC exhibits an impressive efficiency of 9.61%, which is to date the best reported photoelectric conversion efficiency for a LMOG based QS-DSSC. Importantly, this QS-DSSC exhibit significantly improved long-term stability during the accelerated aging test. These findings are very important to the application and commercialization of DSSCs.
