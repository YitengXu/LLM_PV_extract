    , Accepted 15th September 2015First published on 17th September 2015AbstractA three-dimensional TiO2–carbon–rGO (TCG) composite was fabricated and post-treated with UV irradiation (254 nm) for 0.5 h to obtain TCG-UV. The UV irradiation improved the crystalline properties of TiO2 nanoparticles. Homogeneous UV irradiation improved the degree of disorder of carbon in TCG-UV. The rGO sheets and carbon shells improved the electrical conductivity and structural stability of TCG, and as anode materials of lithium ion batteries, a higher specific discharge capacity up to 191 mA h g−1 was obtained after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.2C.
1. Introduction
The anode materials as components of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are of great importance for the development of portable energy storage devices. Recently, transition metal oxides, such as NiO,1–4 MnO,5–8 Fe3O4,9–12 Co3O413–17 and TiO2,18–21 have been intensively studied as potential anode materials for high-performance LIBs. Anatase phase TiO2 nanostructures have been widely investigated as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high current rate tolerance, low cost, environmental benignity and high safety.22–25 Theoretically, TiO2 nanostructures can achieve a specific capacity of 335 mA h g−1 after embedding a Li+. Actually for intercalated-Li with a coefficient of x = 0.5, the corresponding reversible capacity is 168 mA h g−1.26 When Li+ is embedded in the inner lattice of TiO2 nanostructures, it is difficult to generate an effective electric field on the surface of TiO2, and then Li+ cannot take off effectively.27 Problems still remained with their practical applications, for example, the poor conductivity of TiO2 nanostructures is a significant obstacle for current in LIBs.
Graphene and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have special single atomic layer structures and possess some novel physical properties, such as electron conductivity, superior mechanical rigidity and very high surface area. It has attracted great research interest in various fields, including catalysis, energy storage and conversion.28 It has also been demonstrated that graphene and rGO nanosheets are promising additives for electrode materials of LIBs. If graphene or rGO sheets are used to improve the electron conductivity and structural stability of the anode materials of TiO2, the core–shell structures composed of TiO2 nanostructures and carbon shells may be excellent examples for the multicomponent composite material strategy.29,30 In composite materials, the crystalline properties of inorganic nanostructures and their interface interactions with carbon components both become important factors for the improvement of electrode performances. It is an interesting challenge to explore some effective strategies for a significant enhancement of the crystalline properties of inorganic nanostructures in composites and interface interactions through the construction of linkages through chemical bonds.
As a typical semiconductor, anatase phase TiO2 can effectively absorb ultraviolet light. TiO2 nanostructures have been widely explored as photostable, inexpensive, and nontoxic photocatalysts in the field of solar energy conversion devices.31 Anatase phase TiO2 nanostructures will change significantly when being treated in a UV irradiation environment. Under UV irradiation, some chemical reactions take place and reactive species form in the TiO2, graphene or rGO and air system.32 The photocatalytic reduction of GO will take place due to the co-existence of TiO2.33–35 It is noteworthy that UV irradiation should be considered as an alternative process to treat anatase phase TiO2 nanostructures or composites and to improve the performances of anode materials of LIBs.
In this article, a TiO2–carbon–rGO (TCG) composite material was synthesized and post-treatment with UV irradiation (254 nm) provided an enhanced composite (TCG-UV). The degree of disorder of carbon in TCG-UV and the crystalline properties of TiO2 NPs in the composite were improved. Due to the superior structural stability and electrical conductivity, the anode performances of TCG-UV including specific capacity and recycling stability in LIBs were improved.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of materials
Graphite oxide was synthesized using the modified Hummer's method.36,37 TCG raw powder was synthesized according to the previous report by this group.30 Graphite oxide (200 mg) was dispersed into deionized water (200 mL) to form an aqueous suspension of graphene oxide (GO) in an ultrasonic bath with agitation for 2 h. An ethanol solution (50 mL) of tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT, 15.338 g) was added to the aqueous suspension under stirring and then the mixture was stirred for 1 h. An aqueous solution (20 mL) of glucose (4.504 g) was added drop wise into the dispersion with agitation for another 0.5 h. The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (500 mL) and heated to 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid was separated by filtration, washed with water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. After being heated to 550 °C and kept for 1 h under N2 flow, TCG was obtained as a black powder. The TCG powder (1 g) was spread to a square with an area of 7 × 7 cm2 under a UV resource with a distance of 20 cm. After post-treated with UV irradiation (254 nm) for 0.5 h, TCG-UV was obtained as a black powder (Fig. S1, see ESI†). The TiO2 contents of 81.4 wt% and 81.5 wt% in composite materials were calculated from TG and DSC curves measured in an air atmosphere for TCG and TCG-UV, respectively (Fig. S2, see ESI†).
2.2. Characterization
The phase structure of the as-prepared product (30 mg) was characterized by mixing the Al–Ni alloy (15 mg) as an internal standard in a known constant weight ratio with X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 advance with Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) and a scanning rate of 6° min−1 in the 2 theta range from 10° to 90°. The average crystallite size of TiO2 NPs was estimated using the Scherrer formula: Dh = λ/(βh cosθh). Dh is the domain size of the diffraction line, λ is the wavelength of the Cu Kα source used, βh is the width in radians of the diffraction peak measured full width at half-maximum intensity (fwhm) corrected for instrumental broadening, and θh is the angle of the particular hkl reflection. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral measurements were carried out on a NICOLET 380 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. The morphologies of TCG and TCG-UV were studied by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN electron microscope, operating at 200 kV). The Raman spectrum was recorded on a Renishaw RM-1000 with excitation from the 514 nm line of an Ar-ion laser with a power of about 5 mW. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was recorded on a PHI quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al Kα = 280.00 eV excitation source, where binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) to reduce the sample charge effect. The N2 sorption isotherms were measured on a NOVA 1000e surface area and pore size analyzer (Quantachrome Instrument, USA) at 77 K. From the adsorption branch of isotherm curves in the P/P0 range between 0.05 and 0.35, the specific surface areas (SBET) are calculated by the multi-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution was evaluated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. The total pore volume (Vt) was determined from the amount adsorbed at the relative pressure of about 0.99.
The lithium ion battery performance was determined using CR 2032 type coin cells assembled in an argon-filled glove box. The working electrodes prepared by mixing TCG or TCG-UV and the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) at a weight ratio of 90:10 were pasted on pure Cu foil. Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. Li foil was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte consisted of a solution of LiPF6 (1 M) containing vinylene carbonate (2 wt%) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1:1:1, volume ratio). A galvanostatic cycling test of the assembled cells was carried out on a NEWARE battery test system in the voltage range of 0.001–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a current density of 0.2C, 0.5, 1.0 (207 mA g−1), 2.0, and 5.0C, respectively. The weight of composites in the working electrode was used to estimate the specific discharge capacity of the battery, which was expressed in mA h g−1 of composites.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis route and the proposed mechanism of formation of TCG-UV from TCG are illustrated in Scheme 1. TCG was synthesized from GO, glucose and TBOT through a hydrothermal method. The key approach is UV irradiation treatment on TCG following calcinations. The black powder exhibited no clear change before and after UV irradiation treatment.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis route and the mechanism of formation of TCG-UV from TCG. 
The morphology of the as-prepared TCG and TCG-UV was characterized by TEM images (Fig. 1, and Fig. S2, see ESI†). The morphology of the composites is almost consistent with the rGO sheets in the range of micrometers. The rGO sheets can be observed clearly in TCG-UV and TCG. An amorphous carbon layer was observed clearly around the TiO2 NPs. The TiO2 NPs anchored onto the rGO sheets demonstrate an irregular spherical shape, whereas no isolated NPs can be observed (Fig. 1a–c, and Fig. S3, see ESI†). The lattice fringe of carbon shells and TiO2 can be clearly observed (Fig. 1b, and Fig. S3d, see ESI†). It is important to note that UV irradiation improved the crystalline properties of TiO2 NPs (Fig. 1b, and Fig. S3d, see ESI†), which is consistent with the XRD patterns. In the element mapping images of TCG-UV, the same distributions of C, O and Ti substantially support the composite structure of core–shells on rGO sheets (Fig. 1e–h). In the mapping image of C, the same spheres composed of NPs as those in the mapping images of O and Ti also can be observed clearly.

In XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks at 25.4°, 37.7°, 47.8°, 54.0°, 55.0° and 62.8° corresponding to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) planes are the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272) (Fig. 2).38,39 The mean crystalline sizes of TiO2 NPs in TCG calculated according to the Scherrer formula with the diffraction peaks of the (101), (004) and (200) planes are 6.5 nm, 4.9 nm and 6.7 nm, respectively. The mean crystalline sizes of TiO2 NPs in TCG-UV calculated with the diffraction peaks of the (101), (004) and (200) planes are 6.5 nm, 5.2 nm and 6.9 nm, respectively. The average particle sizes of TiO2 NPs in TCG and TCG-UV are 6.0 nm and 6.2 nm. After post-treatment with UV irradiation, no clear change can be observed for TCG and TCG-UV. By calculating the peak area ratio of TiO2 particles of the (101), (004), (200), (211), (204) crystal planes and internal standard, the peak area ratios of TCG and TCG-UV are 0.8 and 1.4, respectively. It can be attributed to the improvement in the crystalline properties of TiO2 NPs with UV irradiation.

In FT-IR spectra, the bands at 1726 cm−1 and 1053 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of CO and O–C–O in GO (Fig. 3a). The peaks at 1577 cm−1 and 1053 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of CC and C–O in rGO.40 The disappearance of the peak at 1726 cm−1 shows the entire reduction of GO to rGO sheets in TCG and TCG-UV.41 The band at 400–900 cm−1 should be attributed to the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibration modes in TiO2 NPs.42 In the Raman spectra of TCG and TCG-UV, the peaks at 2727, 1587 and 1352 cm−1 should be attributed to the 2D, G and D bands of graphene domains in carbon components, respectively (Fig. 3b).43–45 The G band corresponding to sp2 hybridized carbon and the D band originating from the disordered carbon are observed for rGO.46,47 The decreased intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG = 0.62) indicates the improvement in the quality of rGO compared with GO (ID/IG = 0.83). This is due to the fact that the reduction of graphene is accompanied by the carbonization of glucose. The ratio of the D band to the G band of TCG is larger than that of rGO (ID/IG = 0.32), which is due to the formation of a C–O–C group between the carbon shells and graphene. The appearance of a 2D band at around 2727 cm−1 indicates that the analyzed region is consisted of few-layered graphene. Compared with TCG composite materials, it is quite gently indicated that the production of TiO2 hindered the aggregation of graphene. The value of ID/IG (0.73:1) was calculated for TCG-UV (Fig. 3b); compared with the value of ID/IG for TCG (0.62:1), the ID/IG ratio increases when TCG is post-treated with UV irradiation. This is attributed to the improvement of the degree of disorder of carbon after UV irradiation. The bands located at 157 cm−1 (Eg), 395 cm−1 (B1g), 514 cm−1 (A1g), and 632 cm−1 (Eg) are attributed to the anatase phase TiO2 NPs.48

In the XPS spectra of TCG and TCG-UV, the three C 1s peaks centered at 284.8, 285.2 and 288.1 eV correspond to the carbon atoms in the C–C, C–O and CO groups, respectively (Fig. S4, see ESI†). The intensities of carbon atoms corresponding to C–O, CO, and OC–O are significantly weaker compared with that corresponding to C–C, confirming the high degree of reduction of rGO. The enhanced intensity with the C–C group of TCG-UV (5800) compared with TCG (3800) indicates the improvement of disorder of carbon with UV irradiation (Fig. 4b, and Fig. S4, see ESI†). The peaks of Ti 2p in TCG-UV (458.5 eV) compared to those in TCG (458.9 eV) move to the right (Fig. 4c). The four Ti 2p peaks centered at 457.7, 458.4, 460.8 and 464.3 eV are corresponding to Ti3+2p1/2, Ti4+2p1/2, Ti3+2p3/2 and Ti4+2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 4d).49 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted to identify the presence of Ti3+, g value averaging reduced after being treated with UV irradiation, some titanium atoms changed into a three valent form from a four valent form, evidenced by the ESR spectra of TCG and TCG-UV (Fig. S6, see ESI†).

The surface area and pore structure of TCG and TCG-UV were evaluated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K (Fig. 5). Both isotherm curves of TCG and TCG-UV exhibited type IV hysteresis loops, showing the presence of mesopores (Fig. 5a). From the adsorption branch of isotherm curves, the specific surface areas of TCG and TCG-UV were measured to be about 166 m2 g−1 and 158 m2 g−1, respectively. From the desorption branch of isotherm curves, it is clear that the pore width distributions of TCG and TCG-UV are similar to each other with slight differences and concentrated in the range of a typical mesoporous structure (Fig. 5b). The total pore volumes are 0.19 cm3 g−1 and 0.24 cm3 g−1 for TCG and TCG-UV, respectively. After post-treatment with UV irradiation, the pore volumes of composite materials increased. It can be seen that the UV irradiation increased material's saturated adsorption quantity, which corresponds to the increased pore volume of TCG-UV. These all suggest that UV irradiation improved the graphitization degree of carbon components.

The electrochemical behaviors of TCG were investigated in coin cells with Li foil as the counter electrode. The theoretical capacity (Ctheoretical) of the hypothetical mixture of TCG is calculated as follows:33

C
theoretical = CTiO2 × mass percentage of TiO2 + CGraphene × mass percentage of graphene = 168 × 81% + 744 × 19% = 277 mA h g−1 Li+ + e− ↔ SEI (Li)(1) TGC + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixTiO2–carbon–rGO(2) xLi ↔ xLi+ + xe−(3) At a current rate of 0.2C, the initial capacity obtained is 747 mA h g−1 for TCG, which is higher than the reversible capacity from the second cycle and the theoretical capacity of the hypothetical mixture of TCG (Fig. 6a). The extra irreversible capacity in initial cycles is probably contributed by the reaction of oxygen-containing functional groups on rGO with lithium ions and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer due to the decomposition of the solvent in the electrolyte. A high irreversible capacity and a low Coulombic efficiency, which is a common phenomenon for TiO2-based materials, are attributed to the Li surface storage in nanostructured TiO2 to form conductive LixTiO2 in the solid-solution domain.50,51 The second and third discharge processes also exhibit reversible discharging behavior, with a decrease of discharge capacity. The reversible capacities after 100 cycles are observed to be 191 mA h g−1 and 149 mA h g−1 for TCG-UV and TCG, which is 68% and 53% of the theoretical capacity, respectively (Fig. 6b). After TCG is treated with UV irradiation, the cycling stabilities are improved. For further comparing the performances of TCG-UV and TCG, the rate performance is further tested at current rates of 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C and 5C (Fig. 6c). TCG-UV exhibits reversible capacities of 382, 271, 222, 184, 131 and 73 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1.0C, 2.0C and 5.0C, respectively. After cycles of various current densities, the capacities of TCG-UV can recover from 73 to 331 mA h g−1 when the current rate returns to 0.1C. It might be because the crystalline of TiO2 NPs is increased, and TiO2 NPs are not easy to fall off from the graphene. It can be found that TCG-UV shows great enhancement of the capacity retention in comparison with TCG and pristine TiO2.

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) displayed a smaller half cycle curve in the high frequency range and a lower slope of the straight line in the low frequency range for TCG-UV compared to TCG before and after cycles (Fig. S7 and S8, see ESI†). Before cycles, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of TCG-UV is 20 Ω, while the corresponding Rct of TCG is 50 Ω, suggesting its fast electronic mobility and improved electro-catalysis activity. After cycles at a constant current, the charge transfer resistance values of TCG and TCG-UV increased to 500 Ω and 50 Ω. This should be derived from the improved electron conductivity and ion mobility of TCG-UV by UV irradiation treatment.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, TiO2–carbon–rGO (TCG) was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment following calcinations. After post-treatment with UV irradiation (254 nm), TCG-UV was obtained. The crystalline properties of the TiO2 NPs in TCG-UV were improved by UV irradiation. The UV irradiation also assisted in the improvement of the degree of disorder of carbon in TCG-UV. Some titanium atoms transformed from a four valent form to a three valent form. The UV irradiation improved the specific capacity and recycling stability of the composites to be used as anode materials for LIBs, by tuning the electrical impedance and structural stability of the materials. This UV irradiation strategy may be useful for the development of TiO2- and rGO-based functional composite materials.
