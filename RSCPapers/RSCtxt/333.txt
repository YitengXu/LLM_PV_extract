    , Accepted 4th January 2011First published on 18th January 2011AbstractA new series of stable, unsymmetrical squaraine near-IR sensitizers (JK-216 and JK-217), which are assembled using both thiophenyl pyrrolyl and indolium groups, exhibit a panchromatic light harvesting up to 780 nm. The JK-216 based cell exhibited a record efficiency of 6.29% for near-IR DSSCs. In addition, the JK-217 device showed an excellent stability under a light soaking test at 60 °C for 1000 h.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to the low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1 Several polypyridyl ruthenium sensitizers have achieved power conversion efficiencies over 11% in standard air mass 1.5 sunlight.2 In spite of this, the main disadvantage of ruthenium dye is the lack of absorption and the low molar extinction coefficients in the far-red/near-IR region,3 limiting further improvement in efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of this device, our main focus lies in the exploration of new sensitizers with a good spectral match with the solar emission. Therefore, development of new sensitizers with extended absorption into the infrared region is essential. Among the different class of near-IR dyes, squaraine,4phthalocyanine,5cyanine,6 and croconate7dyes are well documented for their intense absorption bands in the near infrared region. Such near-IR dyes have recently received considerable attention because of their possible applications such as solar cells, photodynamic therapy,8 lasers,9 and optoelectronic device.10 Several groups have utilized near-IR dyes as sensitizers in DSSCs and obtained rather low conversion efficiencies. A major factor for the low conversion efficiency of near-IR dyes is the formation of aggregation and lack of directionality in the excited state. Another disadvantage of near-IR dyes is the low stability under thermal stress and light-soaking test. Therefore, molecular engineering of near-IR dyes with a high photovoltaic performance and an enhanced stability is strongly required. A successful approach was attempted by incorporating the nonplanar dimethylfluoreneaniline and unsymmetrical squaraine unit into the organic framework, which not only suppress aggregation but also stabilize device performance under long-term stability. Herein we report two novel near-IR dyes, coded as JK-216 and JK-217, having a 6.29% efficiency under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions by synthesizing appropriately designed unsymmetrical squaraine compounds. As far as we know, this is the first time such a high efficiency has been obtained with a near-IR dye in DSSCs.

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic protocol of near-IR dyes JK-216 and JK-217. The Stille reaction11 of 1 and 2 with 1.2 equivalents of 1-methyl-2-(trimethylstannyl)pyrrole yields 3 and 4. The semisquaraine derivatives 5 and 6 were prepared via reaction of 3 and 4 with squaryl chloride followed by acid hydrolysis of the semichloride derivatives.12 The condensation reaction of 5 and 6 with 5-carboxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-1-octylindol-ium produced the JK-216 and JK-217dyes.

Fig. 1 shows the UV/vis spectra of sensitizers JK-216 and JK-217 in EtOH and absorbed onto a 5 μm TiO2 film. The absorption spectra of JK-216 and JK-217 exhibit an absorption band at 669 nm (ε = 93400 M cm−1) and 672 nm (ε = 77900 M cm−1), respectively, arising from π → π* transition of the conjugate system. The absorption spectrum of JK-216 on the TiO2 electrode is broadened. Such broadening of the absorption spectrum is due to an interaction between the dye and TiO2 as well as some aggregation between the dyes. The UV/vis spectrum of JK-216 demonstrates a lack of light in the 400–570 nm region, which leads to the reduction of photocurrent.

We performed DFT/TDDFT calculations to gain insight into the nature of the electronic absorption origin. The inset of Fig. 1 shows selected MOs of the ground state and excited state electron density distribution. The calculation shows that throughout the dye, while the HOMO − 1 is localized the HOMO of JK-216 is delocalized over the π-conjugated system with the fluoreneaminophenyl and methylene squaraine unit. The LUMO is a π* orbital delocalized over the π-conjugated system, with a sizable electron density distribution from the squaraine and indolium groups. Excited-state TDDFT calculations illustrate that the lowest transition of JK-216 at 654 nm (f = 1.48) is mainly characterized by a mixture of HOMO − 1 → LUMO (23.4%) and HOMO → LUMO (66.6%) excitations, affording a charge flow from the amino core to the anchoring unit.
To evaluate the effect of high molar extinction coefficient of JK-216 and JK-217 sensitizers on photovoltaic performance, we have fabricated solar cells using the transparent TiO2 film of different thicknesses. Table 1 lists the photovoltaic performances of both devices for various TiO2 film thicknesses and different concentrations of CDCA.

When the thickness of the TiO2 film was increased from 5 μm to 15 μm, the photocurrent rose from 9.61 to 13.75 mA cm−2. The open circuit voltage and fill factor remain almost constant, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 5.99%. Further increase of the TiO2 film thickness to 20 μm ameliorated a power conversion efficiency (η) to 6.29%. At low incident intensity (0.12 sun), 6.73% power conversion efficiency has been achieved. As far as we know, this is a record efficiency for the near-IR dye's DSSCs. Attempts were made to check the influence on the photovoltaic performances by changing the concentration of CDCA as the co-adsorbent to suppress the aggregation of dyes. When the concentration of CDCA was increased from 20 mM to 50 mM for the 5 + 4 μm TiO2 film, a photocurrent density (Jsc) rose from 8.54 to 9.61 mA cm−2. The open circuit and fill factor increased from 0.50 V and 0.70 to 0.62 V and 0.75, respectively. Substantial increase of η is attributable to the suppression of dye aggregation. Under the same condition, the high concentration of CDCA gave good photovoltaic performance.
The replacement of the liquid electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells with a solid-state hole conductor has many advantages such as any sealing and long-term stability problems. Near-IR dyes are a good model for solid-state solar cells (SDSCs) because enhancing the optical absorptivity of the TiO2 film by employing high molar extinction coefficient ones and thin film thickness ensures a high light-harvesting efficiency. These two near-IR dyes JK-216 and JK-217 were evaluated as sensitizers for the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. Fig. 3 shows a photocurrent density–voltage curve for a solid-state cell based on the JK-216 and JK-217dyes and 2,2,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the hole conductor under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions. The JK-216 and JK-217 sensitized cells gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 5.08 and 4.50 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.70 and 0.71 and a fill factor of 0.54 and 0.52, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 1.96 and 1.67%, respectively. The efficiency of 1.96% is the highest ever reported for SDSCs based on near-IR dye: the high performance of two dyes can be attributed to the combination of the efficient light-harvesting capability and suppression of the recombination. The inset to Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent action spectra of JK-216 and JK-217. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of JK-216 exceeds 55% in a broad spectral range from 550 nm to 780 nm, which shows a profound dip at 550 nm. A characteristic response in the red region may represent a broad interest as a possible usage of photovoltaic windows that transmit part of the visible light.13

Since the long-term stability is a critical issue for sustained cell operation of near-IR dyes, we replaced a volatile liquid with an ionic liquid electrolyte. Devices employing JK-216 and JK-217 showed excellent long-term stability, when subjected to an accelerated light soaking test at 60 °C, as shown in Fig. 4. The initial efficiency of 2.40% in the JK-217 sensitized cell increased to 3.01% after 1000 h of light soaking at 60 °C.

After 1000 h of light soaking, the Voc of JK-217 decreased by 85 mV, but the loss was compensated by a large increase in Jsc from 4.99 to 7.68 mA cm−2. The long-term stability of the device is unprecedented because any near-IR dyes have not passed such a severe light-soaking stress by DSSCs. The enhanced long-term stability of JK-217 can be attributed to the substituted hexyloxy group and nonplanar dimethylfluoreneamino units by preventing the approach of acceptors to the TiO2 surface, resulting in prevention of dark current.14 This result represents a significant progress as a possible usage of “photovoltaic windows” such as green house or BIPV.
In conclusion, we have meticulously designed and synthesized highly efficient and abnormally stable near-IR dyes. The JK-216 based cell gave a record efficiency of near-IR DSSCs of 6.29% under standard illumination condition. The sensitizer displayed a high efficiency of 1.96% with light soaking and thermal stability when used in a solid-state cell that exhibits a characteristic response in the red region of the spectrum. Moreover, the JK-217 device exhibited an excellent stability under light soaking at 60 °C for 1000 h. We hope that our finding will motivate many researchers to develop more efficient near-IR dyes and their usage.
