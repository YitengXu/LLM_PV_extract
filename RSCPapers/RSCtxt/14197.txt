    , Accepted 17th March 2019First published on 18th March 2019AbstractIn this work, we prepared ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with exposed active edge sites and high electric conductivity that can sufficiently absorb light in the visible region to enable solar energy conversion. The gold nanocrystal–decorated MoS2 nanosheets facilitate sufficiently enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in the UV–visible region. Different Au nanostructures, such as Au nanoparticles and nanorods, were modified on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets to promote photoelectrochemical water decomposition. By spin-coating a synthetic gold–modified MoS2 hybrid photoanode on a FTO substrate, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water oxidation was significantly enhanced, by 2 times (nanorods) and 3.5 times (nanoparticles) in the visible–infrared region; furthermore, the average optical resistance was reduced by a factor of two compared to the MoS2 photoanode without Au, and the photocurrent increases exponentially when the system bias was greater than 0.7 volts. The Au–MoS2 metal–semiconductor interface plays an important role in studying the surface plasmon interactions, charge transfer mechanism, and electric field amplification. This rational design for such a unique hybrid nanostructure explains the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting. This current contribution provides a new path for using the plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructure to effectively harvest UV–visible light for solar fuel generation.
1. Introduction
In order to solve the collective energy crisis presented by unsustainable fossil fuels and the related environmental pollution problems for the next generation via environmentally friendly and high-energy-density combustion products, photocatalytic water splitting serves not only as a current energy reservoir, but also contributes towards a greener environment.1 Currently, the two typical water splitting methods, electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, are hot topics for developing the research skills and experience needed to design catalysts for hydrogen generation, as a clean and renewable energy resource that holds great promise in terms of carbon-free emissions.1–3 In this regard, PEC water splitting is considered the most effective route to producing cost-effective and eco-friendly hydrogen.4–7 PEC water splitting operates with photoanodes consisting of photocatalysts with a suitable energy band gap to facilitate charge transportation and carrier separation for solar-driven hydrogen production from water.8–10 Developing high-performance electrodes with advanced materials and nanostructures is of great interest for both EC and PEC water splitting.
During the past few years, various potential alternatives have been studied, including metal alloys, enzymes, transition metal inorganic compounds, selenides, sulfides, carbides, borides, phosphides, nitrides, chalcogenides of cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, and tungsten as favorable noble metal-free catalysts.3,11 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), among the two dimensional (2D) layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has received remarkable attention due to its low cost compared to platinum-based catalysts, its earth-abundant composition, and pronounced activity; it has been proved theoretically and experimentally to be a promising catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PEC water splitting, owing to its unique ability to create active sites during the reaction and the optimal H2 affinity for unsaturated sulfur atoms on the edges of the MoS2 nanosheets.3,12,13 The MoS2 nanosheets possess weak interlayer van der Waals forces between the individual sandwiched S–Mo–S layers.14–16 The MoS2 nanosheets’ energy band gap depends on the layer number, varying from 1.9 eV for the monolayer to 1.2 eV for the bulk,17–19 which is considered the best for PEC applications.20,21 The three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the MoS2 nanosheets offers a large surface area and a permeable channel for ion transportation and adsorption.22 Literature reviews23,24 reveal that MoS2 nanosheets have active edge sites for catalytic activity and inert basal surfaces. The unsaturated sulfur atoms on the edges and the electrical conductivity of the catalysts are two important factors that affect the electrical activity; they ensure fast electron transfer during the catalytic process.25 Interestingly, much attention has been paid to these two factors, i.e., towards improving the number of active edge sites and the conductivity of the MoS2 catalyst for PEC water splitting. A double-gyroid MoS2 has been fabricated, using a novel strategy, with exposed edge sites for electrocatalytic activity.26 Jin's group synthesized a catalyst of 1 T MoS2 by chemical exfoliation with low charge resistance for improved electrocatalytic applications.27 MoS2 nanosheets prepared by lithium exfoliation method were decorated with Au nanoparticles, and showed an improved photocurrent density of 790 μA cm−2 for the composite material.28 Recently, Xu et al. synthesized vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets on carbon fiber cloth with a Au layer, which contributed to the electrode performance for PEC water splitting.2 The plasmonic enhancement effect of Au nanorods with MoS2–TiO2 hybrid for PEC water splitting was studied to broaden the light-harvesting region and facilitate charge separation.29 However, to the best of our knowledge, the combined effect of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets via strong plasmonic coupling on the active edge sites and electrical conductivity for PEC water splitting has not been reported. Besides the poor conductivity of MoS2, the active sites with small nanoparticles or nanodomains are prominent in the MoS2, but the overall conductivity is hindered due to the poor interparticle or interdomain electron transport in the nanostructure, which reduces the total electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the plasmonic enhancement effect on such ultrathin MoS2 with exposed active edge sites and high conductivity is used to enhance the visible light photoactivity for PEC water splitting.
Recently, noble metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt), coupled to a semiconductor, have led to hybrid photocatalysts which have attracted tremendous interest; the formation of a composite enhances solar–electric conversion efficiency, reduces charge recombination and further boosts the PEC performance.30–32 Generally, plasmonic metals, such as nanoscale sized Au, not only provide greater specific area and more active sites for the cocatalysts, but also shorten the charge transport pathway in different electrolytes.33 Noble metal nanostructures can act as a photosensitizer and show broad absorption wavelength tuning, from ultraviolet to near-IR, and higher light-harvesting efficiency due to the unique localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect.34 Metal nanoparticles in different sizes, shapes and dielectric media can easily tune the LSPR characteristics, due to which the plasmonic photocatalysts exhibit high performance over the entire solar spectrum.35 Impressively, Au nanocrystals in a plasmonic metal-based semiconductor hybrid system display inherently superior photostability during the photoreaction process. Therefore, gold nanocrystals have been widely used to construct plasmonic hybrid photocatalysts by optimizing the utilization of solar power and accelerating charge transfer, leading to greatly enhanced photoelectrochemical activity.
Herein, we fabricated ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with exposed active edge sites and high conductivity through a facile hydrothermal method for improved PEC water splitting. The ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets were decorated with Au nanoparticles and Au nanorods on the FTO substrate and used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation to investigate the effect of charge carrier recombination under visible light illumination. In this work, the MoS2 nanosheets, decorated with different Au shapes such as nanoparticles and nanorods, led to enhanced photooxidation activity and charge transfer mechanism and are suggested to be the best photostable photoanodes for EC and PEC water splitting.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Reagents and materials
Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, CP) and thiourea (CH4N2S, SP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O, CP), L-cysteine, sodium borohydride (NaBH4, SP), ascorbic acid (AA, SP), and hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, SP) were purchased from Johnson Matthey Corporation. Sodium oleate (NaOL, CP), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38 wt%, CP), absolute alcohol (AR), silver nitrate (AgNO3, CP), methanol (AR) and isopropanol (CP) were all obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, and used without any further treatment. Millipore water of 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity was used for all aqueous solutions. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd.
2.2 Synthesis of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets
Typically, 1 mM ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and 30 mM thiourea (CH4N2S) were dissolved in 40 mL DI water under vigorous stirring to form a homogeneous solution. After stirring for half an hour, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The temperature of the autoclave was maintained at 200 °C for 24 h. After this synthesis, the reaction system was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The obtained black product was centrifuged, washed several times with ethanol and distilled water and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C.
2.3 Preparation of Au nanoparticles on ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets
Au nanoparticles (NPs) were grown on the MoS2 nanosheets following a reported procedure.28 The powder of MoS2 nanosheets (60 mg) was suspended in 20 mL DI water, with the subsequent addition of 5 mL of 0.01 M L-cysteine (aqueous solution). The mixture was sonicated for 30 min, followed by the addition of 5 mL of 3 mM HauCl4 (aqueous solution). After vigorous stirring for a further 30 min, 10 mL of 0.05 mL ascorbic acid (aqueous solution) was quickly added into the solution. Finally, the reaction was stirred rapidly for 3 h, and then the products were separated via centrifugation, repeatedly washed with water several times and dried in an oven under vacuum.
2.4 Fabrication of Au nanorods
The gold nanorods were prepared by a seed-mediated solution method reported elsewhere.36 The gold seed solution was fabricated by adding a total of 5 mL of 0.5 mM HAuCl4 to 5 mL of 0.2 M CTAB solution. Then, 0.6 mL of 0.01 M NaBH4 was diluted to 1 mL using DI water, and the solution was transferred to the Au(III)–CTAB solution under vigorous stirring at 1200 rpm for 3 min. The color of the solution changed from yellow to brownish yellow, and stirring was stopped. The resulting seed solution was aged for more than 30 min at room temperature before further use.
The growth solution was prepared by using 7.0 g of 0.037 M or 9.0 g of 0.047 M CTAB in the final growth solution, mixing with 250 mL of warm water (40 °C) with 1.24 g of NaOL in an Erlenmeyer flask. The solution was cooled to room temperature, and 24 mL of 4 mM AgNO3 solution was added. The solution was kept undisturbed at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 250 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 solution. The solution was stirred for 90 min at 700 rpm, and 3.6 mL of 12.1 M HCl (37 wt% in water) was added to adjust the pH. The mixed solution was subjected to slow stirring (400 rpm) for 15 min, then 1.25 mL of 0.064 M ascorbic acid was introduced as a reducing agent, and the mixture was homogenized by stirring for 30 s. Finally, 0.4 mL of the seed solution was injected into the growth solution by mixing. The resultant solution was left undisturbed at a constant temperature of 30 °C for 14 h for nanorod growth. The as-synthesized Au nanorods were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min to remove any unbound CTAB; the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was then re-dispersed in DI water for further use.
2.5 Decoration of Au nanorods on ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets
The Au nanorods (NRs) were decorated on the MoS2 nanosheets to form AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid nanostructures. AuNRs–MoS2 was synthesized by mixing AuNRs with MoS2 (2 mg mL−1) at a volume ratio of 1:3. Then, the mixture was sonicated for 2 h.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The PEC device was fabricated for the measurements. FTO glass substrates measuring 1 cm × 2 cm were ultrasonicated with acetone, ethanol, and water, then dried under a nitrogen flow. Typically, 2 mg of the pure MoS2 nanosheets and the AuNPs–MoS2 hybrid were separately mixed with 25 μL Nafion solution, then dispersed in 1 mL of a water-isopropanol solution (with a volume ratio of 3:1) and sonicated for 2 h to form two different homogeneous suspensions. Then, 5 μL of the photocatalyst suspension was deposited using a spin coating process. Similarly, 2 mg mL−1 of AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid suspension was added to 25 μL of a Nafion solution and spin coated. The as-deposited pure and hybrid samples were annealed under an Ar atmosphere for 30 min before water splitting. To measure the water splitting, an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) with a three-electrode configuration was used, i.e., the photoanode (FTO/MoS2 and FTO/Au–MoS2) as a working electrode, a Pt electrode as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp, along with a long-wave pass filter of 420 nm cut-on wavelength matched with an AM 1.5 G spectrum, was used to provide visible illumination on the samples. The visible light intensity was 50 mW cm−2, as measured by a radiometer (OPHIR, Littleton, CO). A buffer solution of 0.1 M KH2PO4 (aqueous solution) at pH 7.0 was used for the PEC measurements. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the same chemical workstation at an applied potential of 0.4 V, with a frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 50 kHz and a modulation amplitude of 5 mV.
2.7 Finite element method simulation
We used the commercial COMSOL Multiphysics (version 5.3) software to perform finite element method simulation. The Au nanoparticles or nanorods were decorated on the nanosheets of MoS2 with a thickness of 6 nm. They were placed in water with the normal incident plane wave source at the head. The wavelength of the incident laser ranged from 400–1500 nm, with the polarization direction along the x-axis. The optical data for Au and MoS2 were obtained from the literature.37,38 The simulation was separated into two procedures to check the electric field enhancement. First, the background electric field was calculated without the presence of Au nanoparticles or nanorods, and the x- and y-axes were set to the Bloch boundary conditions. Once the background field had been calculated, the nanoparticles were placed on the nanosheets to calculate the scattering field. Perfectly matching layers were applied to absorb all scattered fields. The electric field intensity was collected at the interface of the nanoparticles or nanorods and the MoS2 nanosheets.
2.8 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a Zeiss Supra 40 scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to study the detailed morphology of the MoS2 nanosheets decorated with Au nanostructures and Au nanorods using a JEOL JEM 1400. The X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a Rigaku D/max diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The elemental contents of the samples were obtained with the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an ESCLAB 250 spectrometer. Raman spectra of all the aqueous samples on the FTO substrate were measured on using a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with laser excitation at 532 nm. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) was measured by a Shimadzu Solid 3700 UV-vis NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO4 as the baseline.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the as-grown ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets was studied through FESEM, as shown in Fig. 1a. The large, ultrathin nanosheets with 3D morphology were uniformly synthesized by the hydrothermal process. In Fig. 1a, it is obvious that the ultrathin nanosheets are exposed vertically rather than aggregated together, offering a mesh-shaped structure with the preferred patulous pores and exposed edges. The 3D morphology of the MoS2 nanosheets for PEC photoanode applications gives some structural advantages: (i) the high resistance to charge transportation in single sheets of the in-plane surface adjacent to the van der Waals–bonded S–Mo–S layers can be avoided, significantly improving the catalysts’ conductivity.39 (ii) The 3D vertically aligned ultrathin nanosheets offer a large surface area and abundant active edge sites to enhance the optoelectronic properties.40 (iii) The facile and cost-effective strategy can be applied to large-scale PEC photoanode fabrication.2 The Fig. 1b represents the TEM image of Au NPs decorated on the MoS2 nanosheets (AuNPs-MoS2) and Fig. 1f shows TEM image of Au nanorods. While Fig. 1c, d and e are the HRTEM images of Au nanocrystals coupled with MoS2 nanosheets which clearly represent different sets of lattices spacings. The reaction process, by manipulating the synthesis temperature, can control the disorder engineering and provide a number of active sites and large interlayer spacings, such as 0.94 nm, shown in the HRTEM Fig. 1c. The high synthesis temperature gives rise to nanodomains with short-range order in the quasi-periodic arrangement of atoms, which leads the basal surface to render fast interdomain electron transportation due to dangling bond active sites, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† which show the XRD analysis. Xie et al. synthesized the MoS2 nanosheets using disorder degree engineering to balance the benefits and the contradictory relations between active sites and conductivity for electrocatalysis.11 Therefore, optimizing the short-range disorder nanodomains of MoS2 nanosheets is considered crucial to combine the electronic and structural properties for improved PEC water splitting. More interestingly, the introduction of Au nanocrystals to MoS2 nanosheets induces variation across the charge transfer properties, which effectively enhances the PEC performance. Furthermore, the Au nanoparticles and Au nanorods are polycrystalline in nature with different orientations. The lattice fringe spacing of the Au nanoparticles is ca. 0.24 nm and that of Au nanorods is ca. 0.27 nm, corresponding to the face-centered cubic structure of Au nanocrystals.41

XPS characterization of the Au–MoS2 hybrid photoanode was carried out to determine the elemental composition and chemical states. In Fig. 2, the high-resolution XPS scan identifies the characteristic two peaks arising from the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 orbital, corresponding to 229.16 and 232.35 eV, respectively, suggesting the dominance of Mo4+ in the products.42,43 Besides, the S 2s peak corresponds to 226.01 eV binding energy in the MoS2. Meanwhile, in the S 2p region, the peaks positioned at 161.35 and 162.41 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, and the 2p3/2 peak shows a single doublet that is consistent with the −2 oxidation state of S.44 The peaks of Mo4+ and S2− ions exhibit the chemical coordination. In Fig. 2d, the two peaks of Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2, located at 87.88 and 84.18 eV, support the insertion of crystallized Au.36

In order to understand the optical behavior of the pristine MoS2, AuNPs–MoS2, and AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid photoanode, UV–visible spectroscopy was performed. Fig. 3 represents the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared samples. The pristine MoS2 nanosheets show wide light absorption in the full spectrum range due to their intrinsic narrow band gap and multilayer nanostructure.45 The pristine MoS2 and Au–MoS2 hybrid exhibit strong absorption in the range below 340 nm for the band-to-band electron transitions. This phenomenon may be attributed to the unique synthesis of the MoS2 nanosheets. However, after the introduction of Au nanocrystals, the absorption of Au–MoS2 becomes strong in the visible light wavelength ranges. In our work, the loading amount of Au nanorods and Au nanoparticles is low in order to avoid the aggregation and plasmonic coupling of the loaded Au nanoparticles and nanorods. The TEM images illustrate that Au nanorods are randomly distributed over the MoS2 nanosheets. Interestingly, the addition of Au nanoparticles enhances light absorption in the visible range. Generally, the peak positioned at 530 nm is attributed to the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mode of Au nanoparticles greater than 13 ± 1 nm in size, and this shift may be due to the variation in the particles’ size and shape.46 The AuNPs–MoS2 hybrid system reveals the red shift of the LSPR, which is due to the refractive index of the ultrathin layered MoS2 nanosheets around Au nanoparticles. Thus, the loading of Au nanocrystals enhanced the light-harvesting capability of the MoS2 hybrid by facilitating the separation of photogenerated exciton pairs, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.47 Moreover, the Au nanorods are loaded at very low levels to prevent aggregation, resulting in improved visible light-harvesting capability of the MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S3†). The inset of Fig. 3 in the UV-vis spectrum clearly exhibits a distinct SPR longitudinal band at 920 nm and a transverse band at 530 nm of the Au nanorods. The spectrum of the AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid displays a similar absorption band of MoS2 and a red-shift in the SPR longitudinal band, which might be due to the electronic interactions of the semiconducting phase between the MoS2 nanosheets and AuNRs.
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis diffuse reflactance spectra of the pristine MoS2 nanosheets, AuNPs–MoS2 and AuNRs–MoS2 hybrids. The inset shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Au nanorods having LSPR wavelength longer than 700 nm and a diameter less than 30 nm, as measured from the TEM images. 
The different photocatalytic performance of the ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets coupled with Au nanocrystals can be revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Optical effects are involved in the photocatalytic processes, in which the photoanodes should absorb enough light to produce a large number of excitons. Plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is considered the best tool to analyze the optical effects of plasmon-enhanced devices.48 The near-field enhancement can be directly evaluated by the Raman intensity of the samples using a laser source with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, as shown in Fig. 4. Raman peaks of the pristine ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets exhibit two active modes, which can be assigned to E12g and A1g modes. The E12g mode corresponds to the in-plane vibrations, and the A1g mode represents the out-of-plane lattice vibration with S atoms moving in the opposite direction.36 The frequency difference of the E12g and A1g peaks is about 27 cm−1, revealing that the pristine MoS2 nanosheets are few-layered.49 However, after the introduction of Au nanoparticles and Au nanorods to the MoS2 nanosheets, the Raman modes of the pristine sample are shifted. The A1g peak of the Au nanoparticles decorated on the MoS2 suffers a huge red shift by 2.22 cm−1, which may be due to the compressive and tensile strain, while the interaction between Au rods and MoS2 stiffens the vertical vibration of S atoms,50 resulting in a blue shift of the A1g mode by 2.60 cm−1. Thus, we can conclude that the near-field enhancement induced by Au NPs plays a crucial role in promoting the light absorption of MoS2 and effectively enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

The photoelectrochemical properties of the pristine MoS2 and Au–MoS2 hybrid photoanodes were studied in three-electrode cells with a Pt sheet as the counter electrode and SCE as a reference electrode. PEC and EIS measurements were used to analyze the charge transport properties and interface band structure. Fig. 5 represents a set of linear sweep voltammograms of the pristine MoS2 and Au–MoS2 hybrid photoanodes under solar light illumination. The onset potentials of the pristine MoS2 thin film, AuNPs–MoS2 and AuNRs–MoS2 photoanodes deposited on the FTO substrate are different from each other, with pronounced photocurrent response in the overall voltage sweep window, as shown in Fig. 5. These onset potential shifts can be interpreted as the difference in interface electron transferability as the laden catalysts remain unchanged. The two different work functions for FTO and MoS2 demonstrate n-type Schottky barrier (SB) formation at the interface of MoS2–FTO to hinder electron transfer from MoS2 to FTO. The introduction of Au nanocrystals to the MoS2–FTO interface changes the Fermi level and decreases the SB height (SBH), resulting in faster current growth and lower onset potential. The Au–MoS2 hybrid photoanode shows enhanced photocurrent density, even at a lower potential, compared to that of the pristine MoS2 photoanode, which implies an interface barrier transition from an n-type to p-type Schottky barrier. The Au NPs loaded on the MoS2 nanosheets have significantly improved photocurrent density under visible light illumination. In detail, the Au nanocrystals work as a reaction sensitizer and enhance the visible light absorption ability of MoS2. Scheme 1 illustrates the loading of Au nanoparticles and nanorods on the MoS2 nanosheets, along with visible light illumination in the PEC cell and the energy coupling mechanism. In the PEC reaction, Au NPs take on several roles: they act as an electron sink to trap the MoS2-photogenerated electrons for water oxidation;51–53 their surface plasmon resonance generates a local electric field to separate charges in MoS2; and they contributes ‘hot’ plasmon-excited electrons for direct water reduction.54–56 The annealing process is very effective in improving PEC performance because it converts the MoS2 metastable metallic phase to the semiconducting phase.18 Furthermore, the annealing of hybrid photoanodes reduces the interface resistance and improves the Au crystal phase.

The PEC performance of the MoS2 nanosheets decorated with Au NPs and Au NRs in the visible region facilitates SPR excitation; this enhancement can be shifted to the other wavelength ranges by tuning the morphology of the Au nanostructure, which changes the SPR absorption wavelength. The SPR of the Au NPs was red-shifted compared to that of the Au NRs, as shown in the previous discussion. The photocurrent density of the Au NRs decorated on MoS2 nanosheets is higher than that of pristine MoS2 photoanodes under illumination, which highlights the role of Au NRs in improving the visible light photocatalytic activity. It is more interesting that in the visible region, both Au NPs and Au NRs improve the PEC performance of the MoS2 nanosheets, but only the AuNPs–MoS2 photoanode shows improved photocurrent density compared to AuNRs–MoS2 photoanodes.
The EI spectra represented by the Nyquist and Bode plots were measured on the same workstation, as shown in Fig. 6. The spectra show the charge transfer resistance kinetics of the photoanodes in the dark, which are limited for the water oxidation process at the electrode interface. Distinguishable curvature regions characterize the Nyquist impedance plot, as given in Fig. 6a. The smallest curvature of the AuNPs–MoS2 hybrid photoanode has the estimated resistance of 61 Ω, which shows effective charge separation among the AuNRs–MoS2 and pristine MoS2 photoanodes. This result shows that Au nanocrystals enhance the electron mobility by suppressing the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes in the AuNPs–MoS2 and AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid photoanodes. The photoanodes with greater curvature represent larger impedance with poor PEC performance, corresponding to a higher charge transfer impedance at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the associated photoelectrodes.57,58 The smaller curvature of the AuNPs–MoS2 photoanode leads to it having higher photoinduced charge density and faster hole transfer kinetics than the others. Thus, such plasmon–exciton coupling accelerates the electron–hole pair separation and results in an efficient charge transfer mechanism. Fig. 6b, showing the Bode plots, indicates that the characteristic maximum frequency peak (fmax) decreases after loading Au nanocrystals on the MoS2 nanosheets. Theoretically, an open circuit potential does not allow the current to pass through the whole circuit, and the conduction band injected electrons arise from the electrode/electrolyte interface during the PEC reactions.59 The electron lifetime for the recombination process is related to a time constant (τn) and maximum frequency (fmax), as given in the following eqn (1).60 (1)

The characteristic frequency peak with lower shift represents less charge recombination than the other photoanodes. This analysis shows that the AuNPs–MoS2 hybrid photoanode efficiently suppresses the charge recombination for a higher PEC current and prolonged lifetime of the photogenerated electrons.
Further, Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were studied to explain the carrier density upon the formation of a Schottky barrier between the electrolytes and the hybrid photoanodes, which further confirms the superior PEC performance of the as-synthesized photoanodes. The Mott–Schottky plots of the pristine MoS2 nanosheets and the Au nanoparticle- and Au nanorod–decorated MoS2 hybrid photoanodes display a positive slope, which indicates an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the majority carriers, as shown in Fig. 7a. Mathematically, the slopes determined from the Mott–Schottky plots are used to estimate the carrier density of the photoanodes via the following eqn (2), Nd = (2/eεε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1,(2)where e is the electronic charge unit (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε represents the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 denotes the permittivity of the vacuum (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), and V is the applied potential at the electrodes. Moreover, the slope of the plasmonic hybrid heterostructure is much smaller in comparison to the pristine MoS2 nanosheets, showing the higher carrier density in the hybrid. This higher carrier density of the Au/MoS2 plasmonic hybrid heterostructure is the main contributor to the pronounced photocurrent density enhancement. Fig. 7b shows the energy band diagram of the prepared Schottky-barrier hybrid heterostructure with a stack of FTO–MoS2–Au. The FTO and MoS2 have different work functions, establishing an n-type Schottky barrier formation at the interface of the two materials, which hinders electron transfer from MoS2 to FTO. The Schottky barrier height was decreased and the Fermi level was changed when the Au nanocrystals were deposited on the surface of the MoS2–FTO, which is also responsible for the lower onset potential and fast current growth. The hybrid photoanode, compared with pristine MoS2 photoanode, has a pronounced current density even at lower potential, which implies the interface barrier transition from n-type to the p-type Schottky barrier. In general, an ideal Schottky barrier can be formed if the work function of the metal is higher than the n-type semiconductor. In our experiments, FTO is a heavily n-type doped transparent conductive oxide that establishes a perfect ohmic contact with the n-type doped MoS2 nanosheets. This heavily doped nature of the FTO results in its Fermi level being above the conduction band. Electron–hole pair recombination can be prevented when the metal particles form an electron sink on the semiconductor surface.61 The metal and semiconductor, in close contact, form the Schottky barrier, where the Schottky barrier height is the difference between the Fermi level and the interfacial conduction band edge. The Schottky barrier height is equal to the energy barrier, which requires electrons to migrate from the metal to the semiconductor at their interface. Thus, the higher work function of the metal compared to the semiconductor at the metal/semiconductor interface will cause electrons to migrate from the metal to the semiconductor and maintain a chemical equilibrium potential. This phenomenon results in the excessive accumulation of negative and positive charges on the metal and semiconductor interface, respectively. In the photocatalytic process, the efficient separation of electron hole pairs is achieved due to a Schottky barrier forming at the metal/semiconductor interface. The MoS2 nanosheets, having an energy bandgap of ∼1.3 eV, effectively absorb photons in the wavelength range of 350 to 950 nm, while the FTO window layer, which is optically more transparent, has a bandgap of ∼3.8 eV and does not absorb photons in the visible region. Therefore, it is expected that the incorporation of Au nanocrystals into the ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets forms a Schottky barrier at their interface, which significantly enhances the semiconductor photoactivity.

To understand the plasmonic-assisted solar water splitting process, the morphology of Au nanostructures was tailored to adjust the hot carrier generation from LSPR. Different Au nanostructures have enhanced the photoactivity of semiconductors, including the generation of hot electrons62,63 and magnification of the local electric field64 and the resonant photon scattering center.54 The SPR of Au spectrally overlaps with the semiconductor absorption, and an improved photoactivity was observed because of both photon scattering effects and electric field magnification. Au nanostructures serve as photosensitizers that generate high-energy hot electrons upon SPR excitation, which inject to the conduction band of the other semiconducting materials. The semiconductors coupled with Au nanostructures have sufficient supply of hot electrons that exhibit significant photoactivity under visible light irradiation. The excited surface plasmons, upon visible light illumination of the Au-decorated material, rapidly decay through a series of energy-transfer processes. These processes consist of the generation of hot electrons, resonance photon scattering, or possibly of plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET). The PRET phenomenon explains the MoS2 interaction with the SPR-induced electric field amplification localized near the Au-decorated material. The enhanced optical absorption of MoS2 is due to the interaction of the promoted photons for absorption of the semiconducting material. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was performed to calculate the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity of the Au-decorated MoS2 nanosheets as a function of incident light wavelength. FEM simulation was performed for Au nanoparticles and nanorods decorated on ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 8, containing ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets of 6 nm, Au NPs with a diameter of 13 nm and Au NRs with a width of 15 nm and length of 100 nm. The plasmon-enhanced solar water splitting process expects that the Au NPs’ LSPR electromagnetic field amplitude should be greater at the corresponding wavelengths. The electric field intensity versus wavelength was calculated, and the incident light travels along the y and the z axes. The Au NPs’ and NRs’ electric field intensities in the visible region were sufficiently increased to correspond to the SPR absorption peaks, consistent with Au plasmon-enhanced electromagnetic field mechanism. The FEM results of the Au-decorated MoS2 nanosheets demonstrate that high LSPR electric field is provided in the entire UV-vis region, which is overlapped with the MoS2 absorption edge, as shown in Fig. 8. The Au-decorated samples illuminated with monochromatic incident light travelling along a specific direction exhibit the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity at the incident light of 570 and 1405 nm and also at different incident light wavelengths, as shown in Fig. S4.† The decorated AuNPs and AuNRs in the visible region significantly increased the electric field and enhance the photoactivity, whereas no spectral overlap was observed between the absorption edge of MoS2 and the amplified electric field. The visible light absorption may be limited due to the defect states that also affect the photoactivity of the MoS2 nanosheets. However, the decoration of Au nanostructures substantially enhanced the electric field in the UV-vis region, and thus the photoactivity and visible absorption of the MoS2 nanosheets. It can be noted that the electric field enhancement of the decorated AuNPs is greater than that of the decorated AuNRs in the UV-vis region. This is because the large size of the decorated AuNRs causes the energy split and the electric field to become small due to the strong coupling of different parts of the AuNRs. The generation of highly energetic hot electrons in the Au nanocrystal can be followed by SPR excitation, which possesses sufficient energy that can be injected into the conduction band of MoS2, leaving an energetic hole at Au that functions in water oxidation.54,65 Therefore, the enhanced photoactivity of Au nanostructure-decorated MoS2 in the visible region is mainly ascribed to hot electron generation upon SPR excitation.

4. Conclusion
In summary, MoS2 nanosheets, with a three-dimensional morphology, have a large surface area with exposed active edge sites and intrinsic electrical conductivity. The nanosheets were prepared using a cost-effective and facile hydrothermal method. This synthesis strategy for the MoS2 nanosheets dramatically enhanced the PEC performance. For efficient plasmonic solar water splitting based on MoS2 nanosheets, we considered both the LSPR-induced absorption and hole transfer to the OER level. The decoration of Au nanostructures on the MoS2 nanosheets resulted in improved photocurrent density with different Au nanostructure shapes. The optical absorption, photovoltage experiments and the charge transfer resistance in the AuNPs–MoS2 hybrid photoanode compared with pristine MoS2 and AuNRs–MoS2 hybrid photoanodes showed improved PEC performance due to effective surface passivation (to decrease the surface states) and electric field amplification. Therefore, the surface plasmonic effect of the Au NPs and Au NRs coupled to the MoS2 nanosheets promotes higher absorption and larger photoactivity in the visible light region due to hot electron generation upon SPR and the effect of electric field amplification compared with the pristine MoS2 photoanode. Thus, the enhancement in the PEC activity of the hybrid photoanodes can be attributed to multiple factors, such as increased reaction sites, faster interfacial charge transfer between plasmonic metal and MoS2, and higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. This tuning ability to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Au-decorated 3D nanostructured ultrathin MoS2 makes it possible to design a unique composite plasmonic semiconductor/metal photoelectrode for solar harvesting.
