    , Accepted 24th June 2011First published on 25th August 2011AbstractHydrogen is a very promising candidate as a future energy carrier. It is attractive to produce hydrogen from solar energy and seawater, the most abundant renewable energy source and the most abundant natural resource on the earth. To date, there is no report on a stable photoelectrode with a high incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) in seawater splitting under irradiation by visible light. Herein, we report an efficient and stable system for seawater splitting based on a multi-metal oxide BiVO4 after modification. The results indicated that modified BiVO4 had a photocurrent density of 2.16 mA cm−2 at 1.0 VRHE in natural seawater under AM 1.5G sunlight (1000 W m−2) and exhibited the highest IPCE at 1.0 VRHE in the visible light region of 440–480 nm among all known oxide photoanodes.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is an attractive method to produce H2 fuel from solar energy and water. To apply this technology, an ideal photoelectrode should have a narrow band gap, high quantum efficiency, good photochemical stability and low cost. To date, only a few oxide photoanodes with narrow band gaps, such as WO3 and Fe2O3, are stable for photoelectrochemical water splitting. It is urgent to explore some other photoelectrodes with high quantum efficiencies and good photostability for practical applications. Herein, we report a stable BiVO4 photoanode with the highest incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) at 1VRHE in the wavelength region 440–480 nm among all known oxide photoanodes.

1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical water splitting using solar energy is considered as a clean and renewable method of hydrogen production following the pioneer work on TiO2 photoanodes by Fujishima and Honda.1–3 However, nearly all the studies of photoelectrochemical water splitting have been carried out in scarce fresh water with some inorganic chemicals, except for very limited work in seawater.4–9 Different from fresh water, plenty of Cl− ions exist in seawater and are oxidized more easily than H2O oxidation, kinetically, due to the lower overpotential. Therefore, solar hydrogen production in a photoelectrochemical cell from seawater splitting is of great interest in solving energy shortage. To apply this technology, a photoelectrode should have a high quantum efficiency, good photochemical stability, low cost and narrow band gap. Some simple oxide semiconductors with narrow band gaps, such as hematite and tungsten trioxide, have attracted intensive attention due to their visible light response, but they only exhibit good photochemical stability in base or acid aqueous solutions, respectively.5–14
Multi-metal oxides can afford more possibilities to adjust the electronic structure and chemical stability in comparison with simple oxides. Recently, due to its high theoretical conversion efficiency of 9.1%,15 monoclinic BiVO4 (band gap ∼ 2.4 eV), a multi-metal oxide, has received high expectations for use as a photoanode for hydrogen production.16–23 However, to date, BiVO4 photoanodes have exhibited poor photocurrent stability and quite low incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) at a low potential of 1 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). On the other hand, the edge of the photoresponse of a BiVO4 electrode is about 480 nm, a 40 nm blue shift from its absorption edge (520 nm), which also limits its solar energy conversion efficiency.16 Herein, to overcome these defects, doping and surface modification were used to improve the photoelectrochemical performance in seawater splitting.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of samples
Pure and 3 at.% Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes were synthesized by a modified metal–organic decomposition method.16 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in glacial acetic acid (0.2 M, 0.9 mL), vanadyl acetylacetonate (0.03 M, 5.82 mL) and molybdenyl acetylacetonate (0.01 M, 0.54 mL) in acetylacetone were mixed with a 1:1 mol ratio of Bi:(V + Mo). The optimum concentration of Mo doping was 3 at.%. The solution was obtained after 20 min of ultrasonication (power, 1.4 KW) at room temperature. The solution was coated on FTO substrates using a spin-coater (500 rpm, 10 s) and dried at 150 °C for 10 min, then calcined at 470 °C for 30 min for one layer. The thickness of the films was controlled by the layers of spin-coating, and 4 layers were deposited in a typical sample and calcined at 470 °C for every layer. A pure BiVO4 thin film was prepared by the same process as a reference.
2.2 Surface modification
The RhO2 loaded Mo-doped BiVO4 electrode was prepared by a simple impregnation method. NaOH aqueous solution (1 M) was added to 3 mL Na3RhCl6·12H2O aqueous solution (0.1g/100mL) until some precipitates were observed. The Mo-doped BiVO4 electrode was immersed in the solution for 30 min at room temperature, washed with distilled water, and then calcined at 350 °C for 10 min to obtain RhO2 modified photoelectrodes. In order to investigate the concentration of small surface modifiers, the modified BiVO4 was dissolved in aqua regia solution and was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Optima-5300DV, PE, USA). The ratio of RhO2 to BiVO4 is about 0.3 wt.%.
2.3 Characterization of samples
The crystal structures of the samples were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Ultima III) with Cu-Kα radiation. UV-Vis transmission spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra were obtained using the Kubelka–Munk method. The morphologies of the samples were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI Co.). The chemical states of Mo ions in doped BiVO4 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250).The binding energy was calibrated by C1s (284.8 eV). The depth analysis of samples was carried out by Ar+ etching. The Raman spectra at room temperature were measured by a Laser Raman spectrophotometer (JY-HR800). Single crystal silicon was used as a standard sample to calibrate the Raman shift. The Mott–Schottky curves were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (Princeton Applied Research, 2273). The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.5). The ac amplitude was 10 mV and the frequency was 1000 Hz.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurement
The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated in a conventional three-electrode cell using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-633C, Shanghai Chenhua, China). The prepared films were used as the working electrode and a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and the reference electrodes, respectively. Natural seawater was obtained after filtration from Jiulongjiang, Fujian province, China (24° 25.836′N, 118° 0.64′E). The salinity of natural seawater is 24–27‰ and the pH is 6. For comparison, simulated seawater was prepared following a published method.10 The chemicals (NaCl, 27.21 g; MgCl2, 3.81 g; MgSO4, 1.66 g; CaSO4, 1.404 g; K2SO4, 0.577 g; K2CO3, 0.2124 g; MgBr2, 0.08 g) were dissolved in 1 L distilled water. A Xe lamp and an AM 1.5G sunlight simulator (Oriel 92251A-1000) were used as the light source. The photocurrent of RhO2 loaded Mo-doped BiVO4 was also measured in 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solution after it was measured in natural seawater. The light intensity of the sunlight simulator was calibrated at 1000 W m−2 (1 Sun) by the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell.
The samples were illuminated from the back side (FTO substrate/semiconductor interface) and the front side (electrolyte/semiconductor interface). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed at a scan speed of 30 mV s−1. the potentials of the working electrodes can be calculated using the formula VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.1976V, where VRHE is a potential vs. a reversible hydrogen potential, VAg/AgCl is a potential vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, and pH is the pH value of electrolyte. The IPCE was obtained under irradiation from light of a different wavelength generated by monochromatic filters with a 10 nm band width. The mask-off irradiated area was 0.28 cm2. The IPCE was calculated as follows: (1) where P and λ are the intensity (μW cm−2) and the wavelength (nm) of incident light, respectively. Iph is the photocurrent density (μA cm−2). The light intensity was measured with a photometer (Newport, 840-C, USA). The typical monochromatic photon power density in the IPCE measurements was 0.7 mW cm−2. The photocurrent density was measured at a constant potential and taken as the difference between the stable photocurrent and dark current.
2.5 Products analysis
High-purity N2 was purged into a closed two-electrode cell for 30 min to remove O2 before the illumination. Evolved H2 and O2 after illumination were analysed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A). The Cl2 and hypochlorite dissolved in the seawater after the photoreaction were measured using the iodometric titration method. KI solution (0.1 M) was added to the seawater after the photoreaction. The iodide was oxidated to iodine by the Cl2 and hypochlorite in the seawater. The iodine was titrated with 0.001 M Na2S2O3 solution and starch was used as the indicator.
2.6 Photostability measurement
A Xe lamp with high light intensity was used to test the photostability of the Mo-doped BiVO4 electrode to reduce the measurement time. The light was illuminated from the back side of the BiVO4 film photoelectrode. Natural seawater was used as the electrolyte. The turnover number can be used to characterize the stability of a photoelectrode, and it was calculated from the ratio of the total charge through the Mo-doped BiVO4 to the total molar amount of Mo-doped BiVO4 in the study. The electrode potential was 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The samples before and after illumination were investigated by XRD.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the samples exhibited sharp peaks, indicating their high crystallinity (Fig. S1†), and these samples can be indexed to monoclinic phase BiVO4. Fig. 1 shows the Raman and XPS spectra of pure and Mo-doped BiVO4. A Raman peak of 829.9 cm−1 in pure BiVO4 is assigned to the symmetric stretching modes of V–O bonds. After doping with Mo, the peak shifts to 817.5 cm−1 and no Raman peak from MoO3 is observed, which shows that Mo is substituted into the lattice of BiVO4 in the place of V.24,25 In the XPS results, the binding energy of Mo on the surface of the Mo-doped BiVO4 film is 232.5 eV, which is assigned to hexavalent Mo (Mo6+). A slightly larger binding energy for Mo6+ of 232.8 eV occurs at a depth of 50 nm, owing to a change in chemical environment. These suggest that Mo cations are mainly present as Mo6+ in Mo-doped BiVO4. A binding energy of 231.2eV (Mo5+) maybe come from the reduction of Mo6+ by Ar+ ions.

Porous structures consisting of wormlike particles with sizes of 50–200 nm are observed by SEM on the surface of the pure BiVO4 and Mo-doped BiVO4 films (Fig. 2a and 2b). The porous structures can allow the electrolyte to easily diffuse within the BiVO4 network, increasing the contact area between the electrolyte and the photoanodes, and shortening the hole diffusion distance.5,8 The cross-section SEM image (Fig. 2c) of a typical Mo-doped BiVO4 sample shows that the thickness of the Mo-doped BiVO4 film is about 1 μm. The photoelectrochemical properties of these as-prepared samples in natural seawater were studied. RhO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2d), which act as cocatalysts, were dispersed onto Mo-doped BiVO4. The presence of the cocatalysts was confirmed by XPS, using reference data of RhO2 and Rh2O3 powder,26 and the amount of the RhO2 was detected to be about 0.3 wt.% of BiVO4 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).

The anodic photocurrent is observed in all of the electrodes, which means that oxidation reactions happen in the electrodes under illumination, as shown in Fig. 3a. The dark currents (not shown here) of the BiVO4, Mo-doped BiVO4, and Mo-doped BiVO4 with RhO2 surface modification samples are all several μA cm−2 and negligible compared with their photocurrents (Fig. 3a). The photocurrent in pure BiVO4 illuminated from the back side is about three times higher than that illuminated from the front side at 1VRHE, while the photocurrent in Mo-doped BiVO4 illuminated from the back side is about half of that illuminated from the front side. The photocurrent is enhanced about 6 times after Mo doping. The photocurrent increases further after RhO2 modification, especially at low potentials. Meanwhile, the photocurrent illuminated from the back side is still lower than that from the front side. Fig. 3b shows action spectra of the samples at 1VRHE in seawater. Obviously, the maximum IPCE of Mo-doped BiVO4 reaches 42% at 365–440 nm, much higher than that of the pure BiVO4 (less than 10% at 400–440 nm). The IPCE (365–440 nm) increases further to about 50% after RhO2 modification. In order to compare the IPCE with other oxide photoanodes in water oxidation, we measured the IPCE of the RhO2/Mo–BiVO4 electrode in 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solution (see Fig. 4a). The IPCE is almost the same in both of the electrolytes. A similar phenomena was also observed for Co3O4 modified BiVO4.17 The highest IPCE (at 440 nm and 1VRHE) of WO3 is about 30% in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous solution,3 and that of Si-doped Fe2O3 (at 440 nm and 1VRHE) is 18% in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution.6 Moreover, the IPCE at 480 nm for RhO2/Mo–BiVO4 reaches about 16%, whereas it is only about 10% for Si-doped Fe2O3 and no photoresponse occurs in WO3 electrodes. Therefore, the IPCE of Mo-doped BiVO4 at 440–480 nm is the highest among the oxide photoanodes at 1VRHE in water splitting. We also measured the solar energy conversion efficiency in a three-electrode cell and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. AM 1.5G simulated sunlight was used as the light source and the light intensity was 1000 W m−2 (1 Sun). The solar energy conversion efficiency can be calculated as follows. η = Jsc × (1.23 − VRHE)/I0(2)where VRHE is the electrode potential and Jsc is photocurrent at VRHE; I0 is the light intensity of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. The solar energy conversion efficiency is 0.6% at a potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE and a photocurrent of 1.72 mA cm−2, which is three times as high as Sayama's value of 0.2%.16

In order to understand the effect of the ion doping on the photoelectrochemical properties, various ions (Mo6+, W6+, Ta5+, Zr4+, Si4+, Ti4+, La3+, Fe3+, Sr2+, Zn2+ and Ag+) were introduced into the sites of V in BiVO4. The results indicated that only Mo6+ or W6+ doping enhanced the photocurrent. The Mott–Schottky method was used to investigate the donor concentration of the Mo-doped BiVO4 (Fig. 5).The carrier concentration can be calculated by the slope of the Mott-Schottky curves. The lower the slope of a Mott-Schottky plot, the higher the carrier concentration. The carrier concentration will increase about 80 times after doping with Mo. When Mo6+ substitutes V5+, it acts as an electron donor in the BiVO4 lattice, which increases the carrier concentration and reduces the resistance. We also observed similar phenomena in Si4+ or Ti4+ doped Fe2O3 electrodes.9 High conductivity can promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the thin film onto the substrate. Moreover, the Mo doping evidently leads to a red shift in the edge of the action spectra. For the undoped BiVO4, the IPCE is negligible at 490 nm, while at the same wavelength it is still about 10% for the Mo-doped BiVO4. The photocurrent response edge of Mo-doped BiVO4 can reach 510 nm, which is close to the light absorption edge of BiVO4 (520 nm). Such a red-shift effect has also been observed for Al-doped TiO2, due to the increase in the hole diffusion length from 1.2 to 4.5 μm in TiO2 by doping with Al.27 The hole diffusion length depends on the effective hole mass. A less effective mass means a longer hole diffusion length, which is beneficial for improving the photocurrent. Therefore, we calculated the effective hole mass using DFT calculations with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) codes.28 The ultrasoft pseudopotential was chosen in the calculations. Exchange and correlation effects were described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation. The effective hole masses for the pure and Mo-doped BiVO4 are 0.41 and 0.34 m0, respectively. Therefore, the improvement in the photocurrent of BiVO4 by Mo doping is mainly caused by the enhanced conductivity, as well as a possible increase in the hole diffusion length.

We also investigated the mechanism of seawater splitting under illumination. Generally, in seawater splitting, two reaction processes happen: Photoanode reaction: 2Cl− + 2h+ → Cl2(3) Cathode reaction: 2H+ + 2e− → H2(4)Obvious gas bubbled on the Pt cathode, while little bubbles were observed on the photoanode surface, even at high photocurrents (∼10 mA). This is because the solubility of Cl2 in seawater is much larger than that of H2. Chloride oxidation is highly pH dependent, and the pH of the electrolyte is close to 6–7 during the illumination. Hydrogen gas collected in a closed photoelectrochemical cell was confirmed by a gas chromatograph. A part of the Cl2 dissolved in the seawater reacts with H2O via Cl2 + H2O → H+ + Cl− + HClO(5)
The hypochlorite and Cl2 dissolved in the seawater after photoelectrolysis were detected by iodometric titration.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of the products from seawater and half of the amount of the electrons through the outer circuit under irradiation of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (1 Sun). The yield of H2 after 120 min of illumination is about 70%, possibly due to reduction of the oxidation products on the Pt electrode. Similar phenomena were also observed in pure water splitting.4 Chlorine was produced from Cl− oxidation by the photo-generated holes. Therefore, seawater photoelectrolysis is also considered as a method to produce cheap disinfectant fluid besides hydrogen production. Oxygen gas was detected in the gas products after half an hour, however no bubbles were observed on the photoanode. This suggested that O2 did not come from the water oxidation by the holes, but from the photodissociation of HClO via HClO → H+ + Cl− + 1/2O2 ↑(6)
 Fig. 6  The time course of products during the photoelectrolysis experiment in a two-electrode system of Mo-doped BiVO4 with RhO2 surface modification (area = 0.8 cm2) and Pt electrode with a bias of 1.2 V, AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, 1000 W m−2 (1 Sun). 
The yields of O2 and dissolved Cl2 (hypochlorite) are about 20% and 25%, respectively. Obviously, the total yields of O2 and dissolved Cl2 (hypochlorite) are lower than the yield of H2 (70%), because some Cl2 and hypochlorite were consumed by side reactions (bio-organic in seawater) or some Cl2 in the gas can not be detected by the gas chromatograph. Moreover, in the photoelectrolysis reaction, some white precipitates were observed on the cathode. From the ICP-AES analysis, the compositions of the white precipitates were confirmed to be Ca2+ and Mg2+ (the ratio of Ca2+ to Mg2+ is 43 wt.%). In NaCl aqueous solution, without Mg2+ and Ca2+, the pH value of the electrolyte should increase after H+ is reduced to H2, which will corrode the BiVO4 electrodes. However, in the seawater splitting, the pH value of the electrolyte near the BiVO4 photoanode changed only from 6 to 7 after the long-term photoelectrolysis of seawater. The pH indeed increased obviously near the Pt cathode. Mg2+ and Ca2+ existing in the seawater can react with OH− to form white precipitates of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2, which kept the pH of seawater near the BiVO4 electrodes neutral and stable.
The photochemical stability of a photoelectrode is another crucial point for a photoelectrochemical cell to produce hydrogen. The photocurrent–time (i–t) curves of Mo-doped BiVO4 with and without RhO2 surface modification in natural seawater are shown in Fig. 7. Before the RhO2 modification, the photocurrent of Mo-doped BiVO4 is initially about 18 mA cm−2 and decreases to about 12 mA cm−2 after 270 min of illumination. After the RhO2 modification, the initial photocurrent is about 20 mA cm−2 and the photocurrent decreases to 18.5 mA cm−2 within the initial several minutes and then photocurrent decreases slowly to 16.7 mA cm−2 within 270 min of illumination. Therefore, the photostability of Mo-doped BiVO4 can be improved by RhO2 loading. The total charge through the Mo-doped BiVO4 with RhO2 modification is calculated to be about 280 C cm−2 (projected areas) from the i–t curve, and the turnover number to BiVO4 is estimated to be over 1600. The photocurrent can be mostly restored when the electrodes are scanned by cyclic voltammetry in the dark. XRD was also used to demonstrate the photostability of the Mo-doped BiVO4 with RhO2 modification in natural seawater after illumination (Fig. S6†). The results suggest that Mo-doped BiVO4 is stable in natural seawater for 270 min. The photocurrent reduction during illumination may come from some oxidized species on the photoelectrode surface or extremely low surface corrosion. In pure water splitting, the photocurrent–time curve shows that the photocurrent under low light intensity decreases to 80% of the initial photocurrent during only 60 min. The total charge of electrons through the BiVO4 electrode is estimated to be lower than 20 C cm−2.16 Compared with H2O, chloride ions can be oxidized by photo-generated holes more quickly, and therefore the photocurrent decay is less in natural seawater. RhO2 is considered to accelerate the photo-generated hole transfer rate and improve the photocurrent stability further.

4. Conclusions
To summarize, an efficient solar hydrogen system was developed based on a porous Mo-doped BiVO4 photoelectrode. The Mo doping can significantly improve the photocurrent due to the enhanced conductivity and a possible increased hole diffusion length. Loading with a RhO2 cocatalyst can further improve the photocurrent of the Mo-doped BiVO4 photoelectrode and the photostability in seawater. Further studies on cheap and effective surface cocatalysts are required to promote the practical application of Mo-doped BiVO4 on solar hydrogen generation.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is an attractive method to produce H2 fuel from solar energy and water. To apply this technology, an ideal photoelectrode should have a narrow band gap, high quantum efficiency, good photochemical stability and low cost. To date, only a few oxide photoanodes with narrow band gaps, such as WO3 and Fe2O3, are stable for photoelectrochemical water splitting. It is urgent to explore some other photoelectrodes with high quantum efficiencies and good photostability for practical applications. Herein, we report a stable BiVO4 photoanode with the highest incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) at 1VRHE in the wavelength region 440–480 nm among all known oxide photoanodes.
