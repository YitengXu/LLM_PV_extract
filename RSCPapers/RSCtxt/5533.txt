    , Accepted 19th February 2013First published on 19th February 2013AbstractElectron lifetime in mesoporous nanostructured rutile TiO2 photoanodes, synthesized via a simple, cost-effective, low temperature (50–55 °C) wet chemical process, annealed at 350 °C for 1 h and not employing any sprayed TiO2 compact layer, was successfully tailored with 0.2 mM TiCl4 surface treatment that resulted in light to electric power conversion efficiency up to 4.4%.
Among all dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) components, the nanostructured metal oxide photoanode is crucial, as its morphology drives many physical processes that control the overall device performance: the light-harvesting properties have strong influence on the amount of interface available for dye grafting; the yield of free charge carriers, especially electrons, is driven by the electronic configuration of the metal oxide; and the collected photocurrent is limited by the ability of photogenerated charge to flow in the percolating nanostructured electrode. Important developments in the nanostructuring of DSSC photoanodes have been reported since the use of a nanocrystalline porous film processed from randomly organized TiO2 nanocrystals. Especially, much work is focused on achieving an ideal inter-digitated structure, by using advances in soft processing techniques of inorganic materials such as TiO2 and ZnO.1 TiO2, a 3d transition metal oxide with different parity of electrons in the valence and conduction bands (hybridization of oxygen 2p states with titanium 3p states in the valence band, and pure 3d states in the conduction band),2 has shown tremendous potential in DSSCs as its electronic configuration reduces the probability of electron–hole recombination, favouring efficient charge collection. For both liquid and solid-state DSSCs, TiO2 photoanodes are usually processed starting from nanocrystals synthesized by hydrothermal methods,3 where particle growth occurs in an autoclave under 70 atm (7.1 MPa), at 200–250 °C for 12 h. Alternative synthesis methods4,5 have been proposed in order to reduce the number of steps involved or to achieve crystal growth at lower temperatures. Although, such considerations are crucial for industrial scale-up at low cost, they are still too expensive from the standpoint of scalability.
Among the three stable TiO2 polymorphs, anatase has been mostly implemented in DSSCs. Rutile TiO2 has attracted much less attention for use as photoanodes in DSSCs, which is attributed to the expectation that the rutile phase may exhibit lower electrochemical performance than anatase due to the difference in electronic structures. Rutile TiO2, however, has some striking advantages over anatase, such as higher chemical stability, higher refractive index, lower production cost, etc.6–8 Out of the very rare reports describing the use of solution processes to grow photoanodes, Aydil and Liu9 used a hydrothermal method to grow rutile TiO2 nanorods that yielded 3% power conversion efficiency (η), post-TiCl4 treatment for N719 sensitized DSSCs. However, their work involved a tedious 20 h long synthesis time and temperatures as high as 150 °C. Practically, a photoanode should be easily preparable, relatively inexpensive, and stable over a period of time under a wide variety of conditions. To the best of our knowledge and experience, there has not been any major success in achieving direct mesoporous and nanocrystalline rutile TiO2 photoanodes using a simple and inexpensive wet chemical method with competitive DSSC performance that can better control the kinetics of charge transfer processes at fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO)–TiO2 and TiO2–dye or electrolyte interfaces, respectively.
In this communication, we present an impressive performance (η ∼ 4.4%) of DSSCs fabricated using nanostructured rutile TiO2 photoanodes synthesized at ambient temperatures using a facile wet chemical route and further treated with TiCl4 for a very short time of only 40 min without employing sprayed compact TiO2 nanoparticle layers. It is noted that the efficiencies of DSSCs in the present study were not as high as those reported by Grätzel et al.1 In their work, high η is a result of the co-operative effect of both anatase and rutile phases coated by a somewhat intricate doctor-blade method, whereas in our work pure (only) rutile photoanodes were directly grown by a simple chemical method. The mesoporous rutile TiO2 photoanodes were obtained on the FTO substrate using our previously reported method10 by the hydrolysis of 2 ml TiCl3 (20–30 wt% in HCl) by H2O2 at 50–55 °C and crystallized at 350 °C for 1 h. The XRD spectrum (Fig. S1a, ESI†) confirms the rutile form of as-synthesized TiO2. The (111) and (002) diffraction peaks are nearly of the same intensity as (101)11 in comparison to the standard rutile TiO2 (JCPDF No. 87-0920), indicating that there is no anisotropic growth in a specific direction, as reported by others.12 The average grain size obtained was 5 nm. The optical bandgap estimated from the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S1b, ESI†) was 3.12 eV which is in accordance with that reported elsewhere.13 The photoelectron peaks for Ti 2p and O 1s in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†) appear clearly at binding energies Eb = 458 and 531 eV, respectively. The microstructures of the untreated and TiCl4 treated TiO2 (Fig. 1) show interesting variations. The TiCl4 treatment made the surface of TiO2 nanoplatelets much rougher as compared to that of untreated TiO2 as shown in Fig. 1b–d. The untreated TiO2 reveals a large portion of nanoplatelets interconnected to each other via edges or corners possibly limiting enough electron pathways. In addition, ultra-fine TiO2 nanoparticles were formed on the surface of TiCl4 treated TiO2 electrodes. An enlarged contact area between the chemically deposited TiO2 and FTO after TiCl4 treatment could serve to provide an efficient electron transport to the FTO for efficient charge collection. Interestingly, XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 2a confirmed that the films even after TiCl4 treatment do not change the observed rutile phase characterized with preferred (101) orientation, with some evidence of (110) and (002) orientations. It is significant to note that with increased TiCl4 treatment time, the XRD peaks appear much sharper than in the case of untreated TiO2 films, giving strong evidence of increased crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity is an important factor in obtaining near-perfect/ideal TiO2. The surface of metal oxides necessarily carries OH− groups which can be free or linked by hydrogen bonds, depending on the hydroxylation/hydration state.14 The TiCl4 treatment incorporates additional OH− groups while increasing the surface roughness resulting in higher anchoring of dye molecules.15 Raman spectra of films treated for different durations along with the untreated TiO2 film (Fig. 2b) show Raman shifts corresponding to the rutile phase of TiO2 and are in accordance with XRD analysis. In the present case, a 610 cm−1 band in the Raman spectra is more intense for TiCl4 treatment for 40 min supporting higher crystallinity of the films. Also the sharpening of bands at A1g mode (610 cm−1)16 may be due to an increase in defect density under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 2b, Raman spectra of the TiCl4-treated TiO2 films compared to those of the untreated film show only a small increase in the overall rutile content, despite the dramatic appearance of the rutile surface emission. A reasonable explanation for this result is that the treatment of TiO2 with TiCl4 results in an ultra-thin layer of rutile on the surface. Alternatively, the treatment could result in more facile electron transport to the pre-existing rutile phase (nanoplatelets), perhaps sequestered in separate nanoparticles from those of pre-existing rutile, where electrons then recombine with hole traps to generate the near-IR emission.

The photovoltaic performance of untreated and TiCl4-treated nanostructured rutile TiO2 photoanodes is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The power conversion efficiency was increased from 2.18% for an untreated TiO2 photoanode to 2.6% within 20 min of TiCl4 treatment. Furthermore, the 40 min TiCl4 treated TiO2 DSSCs exhibited a markedly enhanced conversion efficiency of 4.4%. It is noteworthy that the measured Voc value remained over 0.74 regardless of the treatment with TiCl4 which is a competitive value compared to that of conventional DSSCs (0.76–0.77). This is attributed to the higher bandgap of the indoline based D102 dye.17 Due to an ion-by-ion18 growth process it seems that the few nanometer monolayer of TiO2 is: (a) enhancing the bonding strength between FTO and nanoparticles, (b) blocking the charge recombination across FTO and the I−/I3− redox couple, and (c) promoting the surface roughness factor. Higher roughness results in higher photocurrent, as evidenced from J–V curves (Fig. 3a). Further loading of TiCl4 up to 60 min proved to be detrimental, significantly hampering the current density, perhaps due to the increased recombination centers which increase the overall series resistance of the electrode (Rs = 21.42 and 20.19 Ω for 60 and 40 min TiCl4 treatment, respectively). To corroborate this assumption, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 3b) indicated that the maximum efficiency was at a wavelength of ∼375 nm, the absorption maximum wavelength of rutile TiO2. The broad absorption above 500 nm was attributed to the light absorption of the D102 dye. As the TiCl4 treatment time increased from 0 to 40 min, the IPCE increased from 40% to 56% as a result of increased surface activity and conversion of platelet-like structures to mesoporous nanoparticles. The surface area (Fig. S4a, ESI†) was found to increase to 114.67 m2 g−1 for the TiCl4-treated TiO2 from 99.247 m2 g−1 for the untreated TiO2. Moreover, an optimum average pore volume (Fig. S4b, ESI†) for the TiCl4-treated TiO2 was 0.1324 cm3 g−1, leading to a reduced average path length for electron percolation. A careful UV-vis spectroscopy investigation, as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), revealed a definite quantum confinement by a proportionally higher increase in the optical density at higher wavelengths, strongly indicating increased dye loading after TiCl4 treatment. The acetic-acid functionality of the D102 dye ensures strong attachment of the dye to TiO2 that helps rapid injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.17 The dye loading measurement confirmed an enhancement of almost 34% in sensitizer adsorption after TiCl4-post-treatment for 40 min which might also have accounted for the increased Jsc.

The competition between the electron lifetime (i.e., recombination kinetics of electrons in TiO2 network with oxidizing species in the surrounding electrolyte, e.g., I3− and dye+) and the electron diffusion kinetics to the collecting FTO anode was systematically elucidated using the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The equivalent circuit used for EIS measurements and EIS data with electronic parameters are presented in Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†). The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4a measured under 1 Sun conditions for all DSSCs clearly reveal lower recombination rates for the 40 min TiCl4-treated TiO2 photoanodes. One of the reasons for this is probably the increased electron lifetime in the case of 40 min TiCl4-treated TiO2. The electron lifetime (τn) in all DSSCs was calculated by fitting the photovoltage decay plot obtained from open-circuit voltage decay measurement (Fig. S7, ESI†) and applying an equation developed by Bisquert et al.19Fig. 4b shows the plot of electron lifetime, τn (in a log representation), as a function of Voc. It was found that τn of the 40 min TiCl4-treated TiO2 photoanode was ∼74% longer than that of untreated TiO2, implying a lower charge recombination rate and suggested more efficient electron transfer.19 The improved interparticle connection incorporated by the TiCl4 treatment on the surface and the FTO makes it possible for the photoelectrons in the conduction band to be transferred to the external circuit through the shortest pathway. The shortest pathway for electron transfer considerably boosts the transfer velocity of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band to the external circuit.

In summary, highly efficient DSSCs were fabricated using nanostructured rutile TiO2 based photoanodes prepared by a simple wet-chemical route at ambient temperatures, i.e. 50–55 °C, which is one of the lowest synthesis temperatures, so far, for rutile TiO2. The electron lifetime and transport behavior of rutile DSSCs was optimized to TiCl4 post-treatment time of 40 min, which is possibly the shortest optimized time for TiCl4 loading in TiO2-based DSSCs. The performance of our chemically grown DSSCs is expected to further improve on applying scattering and blocking layers.12
