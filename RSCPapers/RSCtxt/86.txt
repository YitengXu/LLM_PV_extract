    , Accepted 27th June 2019First published on 27th June 2019AbstractA unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Co–Al2O3) was synthesized by a facile method. For photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction with CH4 under focused UV-visible-infrared (UV-vis-IR) irradiation, Co/Co–Al2O3 exhibits high light-to-fuel efficiency (27.1%) and production rates of CO and H2 (43.46 and 39.42 mmol min−1 g−1). Even with λ > 690 nm focused vis-IR irradiation, it still exhibits high light-to-fuel efficiency (23.2%) and production rates of CO and H2 (24.62 and 18.97 mmol min−1 g−1). It is found that supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets significantly improves the photothermocatalytic durability compared to a reference catalyst of Co nanoparticles on Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Al2O3). The improved durability is attributed to the fact that O atoms from Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co–Al2O3 participate in the oxidation of C* species formed by both the complete dissociation of CH4 and the disproportionation of the produced CO as side-reactions of carbon deposition, thus significantly reducing the carbon deposition rate. The high photothermocatalytic activity is attributed to effective light-driven thermocatalysis, substantially boosted by new photoactivation: Co nanoparticles in Co/Co–Al2O3 act as thermocatalytic components. Both Co nanoparticles and Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co–Al2O3 act as light absorbers due to their strong absorption over the entire solar spectral region. Their efficient photothermal conversion together with the IR heating effect of the focused irradiation causes an elevation in the surface temperature of Co/Co–Al2O3, thus triggering the thermocatalytic reaction. The focused irradiation substantially reduces the activation energy for CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3, thus considerably promoting the catalytic activity. The photoactivation also promotes catalyst durability due to the inhibition of carbon deposition by CO disproportionation.

Broader context
Energy shortages and severe environmental issues induced by enormous CO2 discharges are primary global challenges. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is especially attractive, as it can not only actualize solar energy storage, but also tackle global warming induced by CO2. However, low solar-to-fuel efficiencies and low CO2 reduction rates are primary obstacles for actualizing the targets. Photocatalysis for solar fuels is based on the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers on diverse semiconductors. But the majority of the solar energy absorbed by semiconductors is lost in the form of thermal energy through the fast combination of charge carriers. The key to overcoming these obstacles is to search for new photocatalysts and/or new strategies different from photocatalysis that can utilize the lost thermal energy. In this work, we achieve high light-to-fuel efficiency (27.1%) and production rates of CO and H2 (43.46 and 39.42 mmol min−1 g−1) through photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 (the main component of abundant natural gas resources) on a unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets with UV-vis-IR irradiation. This work provides an outstanding approach for tackling the issues of solar energy storage and global warming induced by CO2.

1. Introduction
Energy shortage and the severe environmental issue induced by the enormous discharge of CO2 as a greenhouse gas due to the combustion of fossil fuels are primary challenges in the world. Solar energy is an inexhaustible renewable energy in which UV, visible, and infrared energy account for about 5%, 45%, and 50%, respectively. The efficient conversion and storage of solar energy are important approaches to addressing the energy shortage. Photovoltaics is an efficient approach to convert solar energy to electricity, which has achieved huge commercial applications. Due to the intermittent characteristics of solar light day and night, solar energy storage is urgently needed. Photocatalysis for solar fuels, such as photocatalytic overall water splitting1–12 and CO2 reduction to produce fuels,1,13–35 provides a promising approach for solar energy storage, and is thus attracting extensive interest. Among these techniques, photocatalytic CO2 reduction13–26 is especially attractive as it could not only actualize solar energy storage, but also tackle the global warming induced by CO2. Both photovoltaics and photocatalysis are based on the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers on diverse semiconductors upon solar light absorption. Although a variety of approaches have been developed to improve the separation efficiency of charge carriers, the majority of the solar energy absorbed by semiconductors is lost in the form of thermal energy via the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.2,36,37 Searching for a strategy of efficiently utilizing the lost thermal energy is crucial for considerably improving solar-to-electricity efficiency and solar-to-fuel efficiency. In principle, it is impossible to get high solar-to-fuel efficiency in photocatalysis comparable to solar-to-electricity efficiency in a solar cell because it not only depends on the separation efficiency of the charge carriers in the semiconductor, but also on the efficiency of the transfer of charge carriers from the semiconductor to the reactant molecules. Reducing the band gap of semiconductors is a very important approach to improving solar-to-fuel efficiency, as it is able to extend the absorption region of solar light to visible or even to near-infrared light. However, the band gap reduction causes a decrease in the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band and/or the oxidation ability of photogenerated holes in the valence band. Eventually, photogenerated electrons and holes electrochemically lose the ability to trigger the reaction of photocatalytic fuel production.38,39 The requirement of band gap matching makes it extremely difficult to utilize infrared energy from solar light for photocatalytic fuel production. Actually, up to now, there have been no reports on infrared light-to-fuel conversion by photocatalysis without using a sacrificial reagent. Currently, the insurmountable obstacle for solar fuels is the low solar-to-fuel efficiency, far below the goal of 10% for practical applications.1,2,40 Another obstacle is the low production rate of solar fuels, especially through photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Extensive work has been devoted to leaping over these obstacles.1–35 Up to now, the maximum record for solar-to-fuel efficiency for photocatalytic fuel production is 2%.4 The maximum records of CO2 reduction rate for photocatalytic CO2 reduction using an organic sacrificial reagent29 and without using a sacrificial reagent13 are 2.62 × 104 and 488.4 μmol h−1 g−1 (0.44 and 0.00814 mmol min−1 g−1), respectively. It is highly desirable to design new photocatalysts and/or to develop a new strategy different from photocatalysis to significantly boost solar-to-fuel efficiency and the solar fuel production rate.
Recently, a strategy of light-assisted reduction of CO2 with CH4 (the main component of the abundant natural gas resource) to produce fuels of H2 and CO (CO2 + CH4 = 2CO + 2H2, ΔH298 = 247 kJ mol−1) has been developed by several research groups.41–43 It was reported that the CO2 reduction rate was considerably boosted by light irradiation using several catalysts, such as Pt/TiO2,41 Rh-Au/SBA-15, Ni/Al2O3, Fe/SiO2, and Rh/SiO2.42,43 The strategy is very attractive because the strong endothermic property of the reaction (ΔH298 = 247 kJ mol−1), like photocatalytic overall water splitting (2H2O(l) = 2H2 + O2, ΔH298 = 285.8 kJ mol−1)4 and photocatalytic CO2 reduction13,14 (e.g. CO2 = CO + 0.5O2, ΔH298 = 283.0 kJ mol−1), makes it possible to actualize efficient solar-to-fuel energy storage. Moreover, the products of CO and H2 are not only fuels, but also the feedstocks for synthesizing important chemicals and liquid fuels from natural gas,41 which is an important target in the petrochemical industry. As an additional electric heater was used in the light-assisted reduction of CO2 with CH4, the light-to-fuel efficiency was not reported.41–43 In addition, the reported catalysts experienced obvious deactivation within several hours.41–43 The fast deactivation of the catalyst is mainly ascribed to thermodynamically inevitable carbon deposition side-reactions, such as the complete dissociation of CH4 (CH4 = C + 2H2, ΔH298 = 75 kJ mol−1) and the disproportionation of the produced CO (2CO = C + CO2, ΔH298 = −171 kJ mol−1) at a high reaction temperature.44,45 Addressing the catalyst deactivation problem is greatly challenging and extremely difficult. Very recently, we actualized the highly effective photothermocatalytic reduction of CO2 with CH4 without using any additional heater besides a light source.45–47 A high CO2 reaction rate and light-to-fuel efficiency (up to 12.5%) were simultaneously achieved by designing several nanostructured photothermocatalysts with good durability, such as silica cluster modified Ni nanoparticles and Pt nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous CeO2. Rationally designing an excellent photothermocatalyst for the photothermocatalytic strategy is crucial for further significantly boosting the CO2 reaction rate and light-to-fuel efficiency, and improving catalyst durability by kinetically inhibiting carbon deposition.
Herein, we have designed a unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Co–Al2O3). For photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 under focused UV-vis-IR irradiation, Co/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates a high light-to-fuel efficiency (27.1%) and production rates of CO and H2 (43.46 and 39.42 mmol min−1 g−1). It is found that supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 significantly improves the catalyst durability in comparison with a reference catalyst of Co nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Al2O3). The high photothermocatalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 is ascribed to effective light-driven thermocatalysis that is substantially boosted by a new photoactivation. The new photoactivation also promotes the catalyst durability. On the basis of the experimental evidence, we unveil the origin of the excellent photothermocatalytic performance of Co/Co–Al2O3 and the novel photoactivation.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Characterization
The unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (labeled Co/Co–Al2O3) was prepared by a hydrothermal reaction among Co(NO3)2, Al(NO3)3, and CO(NH2)2 with a Co/(Co + Al) molar ratio of 0.09 at 150 °C, subsequently calcined at 500 °C, and finally pre-reduced at 700 °C in a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar (see Experimental, ESI†). By the same procedure, except for decreasing the Co/(Co + Al) molar ratio to 0.05, Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (labeled Co–Al2O3) were prepared. By the same procedure, except for no addition of Co(NO3)2, pure Al2O3 was obtained. For comparison, a nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 nanosheets (labeled Co/Al2O3) was prepared (see Experimental). ICP-OES analysis demonstrates that the Co/Al molar ratios of Co–Al2O3, Co/Co–Al2O3, and Co/Al2O3 are 0.0386, 0.0751, and 0.0867, respectively. XRD analysis demonstrates that pure Al2O3 has a cubic crystalline structure of γ-Al2O3 (PDF 10-0425) (Fig. 1). Co–Al2O3 has the same XRD patterns as pure Al2O3, and no XRD peaks of any cobalt oxide or metallic cobalt are observed. The observation indicates that Co doping does not alter the cubic crystalline structure of γ-Al2O3, and the pre-treatment at 700 °C in a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar does not lead to the reduction of Co–Al2O3 to metallic cobalt. For Co/Co–Al2O3, XRD peaks of metallic cobalt (PDF 15-0806), besides the XRD peaks of γ-Al2O3, are observed. The result indicates that increasing the Co/(Co + Al) molar ratio from 0.05 (Co–Al2O3) to 0.09 leads to the formation of metallic cobalt besides Co doped Al2O3. The average crystal size of metallic cobalt, estimated in accordance with the Scherrer formula (L = 0.89λ/βcosθ) at the peak of the {111} facet (2θ = 44.22°), is 19.5 nm. Co/Al2O3 has XRD patterns similar to those of Co/Co–Al2O3. Metallic cobalt and γ-Al2O3 are observed. The average crystal size of metallic cobalt in Co/Al2O3 is 24.1 nm.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of Al2O3 (a), Co–Al2O3 (b), Co/Al2O3 (c), and Co/Co–Al2O3 (d). 
The SEM image shows that Co/Co–Al2O3 has the morphology of nanosheets of hundreds of nanometers in length and dozens of nanometers in thickness (Fig. 2A). TEM images show that metallic Co nanoparticles (black dots) with sizes of 8–28 nm are distributed on Co–Al2O3 nanosheets (Fig. 2B and C). The predominant size of the Co nanoparticles is 14–18 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is generally in agreement with the result by XRD. The HRTEM image shows that a metallic cobalt nanocrystal with a lattice spacing of {111} facets is in close contact with γ-Al2O3 with a lattice spacing of {400} facets (Fig. 2D). As can be seen from the HAADF image (Fig. 3A) and the corresponding Co elemental mapping (Fig. 3B), segregated Co nanoparticles are observed, which is in agreement with the result by XRD. Moreover, besides Co nanoparticles, Co is also uniformly distributed on Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 3B). The elemental mappings of Al and O demonstrate that Al and O are uniformly distributed on Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 3C and D). Co/Co–Al2O3 is further characterized by high-resolution HAADF-STEM. Metallic Co nanocrystals with a lattice spacing of 0.206 nm (bright lines) and randomly distributed Co (bright dots) are observed (Fig. 3E and F). The observations together with the results of ICP and XRD clearly demonstrate that Co/Co–Al2O3 has a unique microstructure of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets rather than Co nanocrystals supported on Al2O3 nanosheets.

For Co–Al2O3, the SEM image (Fig. S2A, ESI†) shows that Co–Al2O3 has the morphology of nanosheets. TEM images confirm the nanosheet morphology of Co–Al2O3 (Fig. S2B and C, ESI†). The HRTEM image shows a lattice spacing of {400} facets of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. S2D, ESI†). No lattice spacings of metallic cobalt or cobalt oxides are observed. The HAADF image and the corresponding elemental mappings demonstrate that Co, Al, and O (Fig. S3, ESI†) are all uniformly distributed, and no segregated Co nanoparticles like Co/Co–Al2O3 are observed. High-resolution HAADF-STEM shows that there are randomly distributed Co (bright dots) without metallic Co nanocrystals observed for Co–Al2O3 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The observations together with the results of ICP and XRD clearly demonstrate that Co–Al2O3 has a microstructure of Co uniformly doped Al2O3 nanosheets.
For Co/Al2O3, the SEM image (Fig. S5A, ESI†) shows that Co/Al2O3 has the morphology of nanosheets. TEM images show that metallic nanoparticles (black dots) with sizes of 10–40 nm are distributed on Al2O3 nanosheets (Fig. S5B and C). The predominant size of the Co nanoparticles is 20–22 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is generally in agreement with the result by XRD. The HRTEM image shows that a metallic cobalt nanocrystal with a lattice spacing of {111} facets is in close contact with cubic Al2O3 with a lattice spacing of {400} facets (Fig. S5D, ESI†). As shown in the HAADF image and the corresponding elemental mappings (Fig. S7, ESI†), Al and O are uniformly distributed, but Co is distributed as segregated nanoparticles. This is in striking contrast to the uniform distributions of Co, Al and O for both Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co–Al2O3. The observations together with the results of ICP and XRD clearly demonstrate that Co/Al2O3 has a microstructure of Co nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 nanosheets.
The valence states of the elements in the samples were characterized by XPS (Fig. S8, ESI†). Al and O in Co–Al2O3, Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 exist as Al3+ and O2−, respectively. For Co–Al2O3, only Co2+ is observed. For Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3, most of Co species exist as Co2+. Only a small amount of Co species exists in metallic Co, which is attributed to the surface oxidation of Co nanoparticles due to exposure to air.
The samples were characterized by N2 adsorption (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†). The BET surface areas of Co–Al2O3, Co/Co–Al2O3, and Co/Al2O3 are 199.7, 189.8, and 228.6 m2 g−1, respectively. The BJH adsorption pore volumes of Co–Al2O3, Co/Co–Al2O3, and Co/Al2O3 are 0.56, 0.49, and 0.53 cm3 g−1, respectively.
2.2. Photothermocatalytic activity
The photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on the samples with focused irradiation from a 500 W Xe lamp (note: no any additional heater was used) was conducted in a home-made stainless steel reactor with a quartz window (Experimental, Scheme 1, ESI†).46 A feed stream of 30.0/29.3/40.7 vol% CH4/CO2/Ar constantly flowed at 89.2 mL min−1 into the reactor which contained 0.0200 g of the sample. As can be seen from Fig. 4, pure Al2O3 has no photothermocatalytic activity. Co doping enables Al2O3 to have photothermocatalytic activity. With the focused UV-Vis-IR irradiation, the reaction rates of CH4 (rCH4) and CO2 (rCO2) of Co–Al2O3 are 0.32 and 0.51 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively (Fig. 4A). The production rates of H2 (rH2) and CO (rCO) of Co–Al2O3 are 0.27 and 0.83 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets promotes the photothermocatalytic activity tremendously. Co/Co–Al2O3 has high photothermocatalytic activity with rCH4 and rCO2 values of 20.12 and 22.97 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively. The rH2 and rCO values of Co/Co–Al2O3 are as high as 39.42 and 43.46 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively. This result suggests that Co nanoparticles in Co/Co–Al2O3 as catalytic active sites play a crucial role in the photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4. The rH2/rCO molar ratio being less than the stoichiometric ratio (1:1) of the reaction (CO2 + CH4 = 2CO + 2H2) is attributed to the occurrence of a reverse water–gas shift (H2 + CO2 = H2O + CO) as a side reaction. This is verified by the detection of a small amount of moisture in the effluents with gas chromatography (GC). There are no other products besides H2, CO, and H2O detected by GC.

Note: the photothermocatalytic data from Co/Al2O3 in Fig. 4 are the average data in the initial 20 min as Co/Al2O3 experienced swift deactivation (see Fig. 6A). 
In order to make a comparison, we measured the photothermocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Al2O3). Compared to Co/Co–Al2O3, Co/Al2O3 exhibits lower photothermocatalytic activity. The rCH4 and rCO2 of Co/Al2O3 are 17.87 and 20.46 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively. The rH2 and rCO of Co/Al2O3 are 31.42 and 37.97 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively.
Due to the strong endothermic property of CO2 reduction by CH4 to CO and H2 (ΔH298 = 247 kJ mol−1), the high photothermocatalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-vis-IR irradiation suggests the realization of highly efficient light-to-fuel conversion. Therefore, the light-to-fuel efficiency (η) is calculated according to the following equation (ESI†).46,48


, ΔcH0CO, and  are the standard combustion heats (298.15 K) of CH4, CO, and H2 as fuels, respectively (Note:  is 0). Pirradiation is the irradiation power.
Under focused UV-vis-IR irradiation, Co/Co–Al2O3 has a high η value of 27.1% (Fig. 4C). Compared to Co/Co–Al2O3, Co/Al2O3 has a much lower η value of 18.4%, while Co–Al2O3 has a very low η value of 0.9%.
In spite of the high light-fuel efficiency, the η value of Co/Co–Al2O3 is still far lower than the thermodynamic maximum value (ηmax) of the reaction system (59.8%, ESI†), which is decided by the solar absorption and Carnot efficiencies, in accordance with the following equation:46,48ηmax = [1 − σ × TH4/(IDNI × C)] × [1 − TL/TH]The photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR irradiation was also conducted. Co/Co–Al2O3 has high photothermocatalytic activity with focused vis-IR irradiation (Fig. 5). With λ > 420 nm focused vis-IR irradiation, the rH2 and rCO values of Co/Co–Al2O3 are 34.42 and 38.80 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively. The η value of Co/Co–Al2O3 is 27.4%. Even with λ > 690 nm focused vis-IR irradiation, Co/Co–Al2O3 still shows high rH2 and rCO values of 18.97 and 24.62 mmol min−1 g−1. The η value of Co/Co–Al2O3 is still as high as 23.2%.

2.3. Photothermocatalytic durability
Good catalytic durability is very important for CO2 reduction with CH4, as the catalyst experiences fast deactivation due to thermodynamically inevitable carbon deposition.44,45 To prove whether Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 are photothermocatalytically stable, long-term photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 with focused UV-vis-IR irradiation was conducted. As shown in Fig. 6A, although Co/Al2O3 has good initial photothermocatalytic activity, it is quickly deactivated. After 4 h of reaction, its rCO and rH2 values quickly reduce by 58.4% and 47.1%, respectively. The η value of Co/Al2O3 swiftly decreases from 18.4% (initial 20 min) to 7.3%. In striking contrast, Co/Co–Al2O3 exhibits excellent photothermocatalytic durability. After 70 h of reaction, its rCO and rH2 values remain almost unchanged (Fig. 6B). The η value of Co/Co–Al2O3 is still as high as 23.6%. This result indicates that, compared with Co nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Al2O3), supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Co–Al2O3) dramatically promotes photothermocatalytic durability in spite of the low photothermocatalytic activity of Co–Al2O3.

To reveal the origin of the dramatic improvement in durability, after the photothermocatalytic durability tests, the used samples of Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 were characterized by TG-MS, XRD, and TEM. TG-MS shows that there are 63.14% and 39.7% weight losses for the used samples of Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 due to the combustion of the deposited carbon (Fig. S12, ESI†). Based on the weight loss, the carbon deposition rates (rC) of Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 are calculated to be 0.024 and 0.165 gc gcatalyst−1 h−1, respectively. The rC value of Co/Co–Al2O3 being much less than that of Co/Al2O3 indicates that carbon deposition is dramatically inhibited by supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets. XRD analysis shows that the deposited carbon exists in the form of rhombohedral carbon (PDF 75-2078) in the used samples of Co/Co–Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 (Fig. S13, ESI†). TEM shows that there are a lot of carbon nanofibers in the used samples of Co/Al2O3 (Fig. S14A, ESI†) and Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. S15A, ESI†). To reveal why the carbon deposition quickly deactivates Co/Al2O3, but does not cause Co/Co–Al2O3 to obviously lose photothermocatalytic activity, the used samples were characterized by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. S14B (ESI†), a lattice spacing of {111} facets of carbon is observed around the Co nanoparticle for the used Co/Al2O3 sample, and the surface of the Co nanoparticle becomes obscure. This observation indicates that the surface of the Co nanoparticle is covered by a layer of amorphous carbon, which blocks the adsorption and subsequent reaction of CO2 and CH4 molecules. In striking contrast, although the lattice spacing of carbon is observed around the metallic Co nanoparticle for the used Co/Co–Al2O3 sample, a relatively clear lattice spacing of the metallic Co nanoparticle is still observed (Fig. S15B, ESI†). This observation indicates that carbon deposition on the surface of the Co nanoparticles in Co/Co–Al2O3 is inhibited, resulting in the excellent photothermocatalytic durability. This result further confirms that Co nanoparticles act as catalytically active sites for Co/Al2O3 and Co/Co–Al2O3.
2.4. Origin of the improved photothermocatalytic durability
To gain insight into the origin of the substantial improvement in photothermocatalytic durability of Co/Co–Al2O3, an isotope labeling experiment of photothermocatalytic 12C18O2 reduction by 12CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-vis-IR irradiation was conducted (Experimental). With UV-vis-IR irradiation, accompanying the attenuation of C–H stretching peaks of 12CH4 around 3016 cm−1 and C–O stretching peaks of 12C18O2 at 2324 and 2308 cm−1, there are four peaks at 2169, 2127, 2116, and 2081 cm−1 observed (Fig. 7A). The two peaks at 2169 and 2116 cm−1 are attributed to C–O stretching modes of 12C16O, while the two peaks at 2127 and 2081 cm−1 are attributed to C–O stretching modes of 12C18O.46,49 The formation of 12C16O indicates that O atoms from Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co–Al2O3 participates in the oxidation of C* species formed by both the complete dissociation of CH4 and the disproportionation of the produced CO as side-reactions of carbon deposition. This is favorable for reducing the carbon deposition rate, thus improving the photothermocatalytic durability of Co/Co–Al2O3 compared to Co/Al2O3.

Raman spectra (B) of the fresh Co/Co–Al2O3 sample (a) and the used Co/Co–Al2O3 sample after testing photothermocatalytic 12C18O2 reduction with 12C1H4 (b). Note: in Fig. 7A, a shoulder peak at 2343 cm−1 is attributed to the C–O stretching of 12C18O16O,46 indicating that O atoms from Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co–Al2O3 also participate in the oxidation of C18O. 
The participation of O atoms from Co doped Al2O3 in the oxidation of C* species is further verified by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 7B). The fresh Co/Co–Al2O3 sample has a Raman peak at around 689 cm−1, which is attributed to the Co–16O stretching of Co doped Al2O3,50 as γ-Al2O3 has no Raman peaks due to its very strong fluorescence background.51 The peak of the used Co/Co–Al2O3 sample shifts to 664 cm−1. The obvious isotope shift clearly indicates that Co–16O bonds of Co/Co–Al2O3 transform to Co–18O bonds due to the following reactions: the formed 12C* species are oxidized to 12C16O by 16O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 7A). 12C18O2 molecules adsorbed on the resultant 16O vacancies dissociate to 12C18O and 18O*, resulting in refilling of 16O vacancies in Co–Al2O3 by 18O*.
2.5. Roles of light

2.5.1. Heating: light-driven thermocatalysis. 
In order to unveil why Co/Co–Al2O3 has high photothermocatalytic activity, the absorption spectra of the samples were recorded (Fig. 8A). Co–Al2O3 has two strong absorption bands in the regions of 470–700 nm and 960–1850 nm. Co/Co–Al2O3 has strong absorption over the whole solar spectrum region, which is attributed to the strong surface plasmon absorption of Co nanoparticles overlapping with the absorption of Co–Al2O3.

To confirm whether the strong absorption of Co/Co–Al2O3 causes photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3 with UV-vis-IR irradiation was performed at near room temperature. CO and H2 are not detected by GC (Fig. S16, ESI†). This result suggests that the high photothermocatalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 4) can be ascribed to light-driven thermocatalysis rather than photocatalysis.
Upon the focused irradiation, the surface temperature of Co/Co–Al2O3 is quickly raised to an equilibrium temperature (Teq). When the Teq value exceeds the light-off temperature (Tlight-off: the temperature at which the thermocatalytic reaction starts to proceed) of thermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3, the thermocatalytic reaction is triggered.
The Teq values of the samples with focused irradiation were measured. The Teq values of Co–Al2O3, Co/Co–Al2O3, and Co/Al2O3 with focused UV-vis-IR irradiation are 588, 665, and 697 °C, respectively (Fig. 8B). The Teq values of Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR irradiation of λ > 420, 560, and 690 nm are 612, 554, and 497 °C, respectively (Fig. S17, ESI†). The high Teq values are ascribed to the IR heating effect of the focused irradiation as well as photothermal conversion owing to the strong absorption by the samples (Fig. 8A). The IR heating effect is confirmed by the high Teq value of the sample holder (535 °C).
Thermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 on the samples in the dark was evaluated (Fig. 9). The thermocatalytic activity of Co–Al2O3 is very low. Co/Al2O3 shows higher thermocatalytic activity than Co–Al2O3. Compared to Co/Al2O3, the thermocatalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 is significantly enhanced. This enhancement indicates the presence of a synergetic effect between Co nanoparticles and Co–Al2O3 due to the fact that O atoms from Co–Al2O3 participate in the CO2 reduction with CH4 (as discussed in Section 2.4). The Tlight-off values of Co–Al2O3, Co/Al2O3, and Co/Co–Al2O3 are about 651, 647, and 490 °C, respectively (Fig. 9A and B). They are less than their corresponding Teq values (Fig. 8B). Therefore, light-driven thermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 is able to proceed.

Note: the thermocatalytic data of Co/Al2O3 in A–D are the average data in the initial 20 min as Co/Al2O3 experienced swift deactivation (see Fig. 6A). 


2.5.2. Photoactivation. 
Is the high photothermocatalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 merely accredited to the light-driven thermocatalysis? To address this issue, CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co–Al2O3 at the same temperature was conducted in the dark and with focused irradiation. At the same temperature greater than 490 °C, in comparison with the corresponding values obtained in the dark, the focused UV-vis-IR irradiation substantially raises the values of rCO2, rCH4, rH2, rCO, and the H2/CO molar ratio (Fig. 9A–E). Similar enhancements in the catalytic activity of Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR irradiation of λ > 420 and 560 nm are observed (Fig. S18, ESI†). As Co/Co–Al2O3 has no photocatalytic activity (Fig. S16, ESI†), the result suggests that the substantial catalytic enhancement is caused by a new photoactivation effect. The enhancement in the H2/CO molar ratio is attributed to the fact that the catalytic enhancement for the CO2 reduction by CH4 by focused vis-IR irradiation (Fig. 9C and D) is more pronounced than that for CO2 reduction by H2 as the aforementioned side-reaction (Fig. S19, ESI†).
Graphs of ln(rCH4) vs. 1/T are plotted on the basis of the rCH4 values of Co/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 9B). A good linear relationship between ln(rCH4) and 1/T is observed (Fig. 9E). In accordance with the Arrhenius equation (k = Ae−Ea/RT), the apparent activation energy (Ea,ap) value of Co/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-vis-IR irradiation is calculated to be 42.0 kJ mol−1. This is less than that in the dark (69.8 kJ mol−1). This means that the focused UV-vis-IR irradiation substantially reduces the activation energy, thus considerably improving the catalytic activity.
CO2 reduction by CH4 involves a number of elementary steps, including the decomposition of CO2 to CO* and O*, the step-by-step decompositions of CH4 to CHx* (x = 0–3), the oxidation of CHx by O*, and so on.45,52 Among these steps, the oxidations of C* and CH* are the rate-determining steps due to their higher activation energies.45,52 To gain deep insight into the photoactivation, temperature-programmed reactions of CO2 decomposition (CO2-TPD), CH4 decomposition (CH4-TPD), and oxidation of pre-deposited CHx* species by CO2 (CHx*-TPO) on Co/Co–Al2O3 were conducted in the dark and under irradiation (see Experimental, ESI†). CO2-TPD shows that UV-vis-IR irradiation does not obviously affect CO2 decomposition (Fig. S20, ESI†). CH4-TPD shows that UV-vis-IR irradiation causes a slight shift in the CH4 consumption peak to 653 °C compared to that in the dark (662 °C, Fig. S21, ESI†). This indicates that UV-vis-IR irradiation slightly promotes CH4 decomposition. Interestingly, compared to the CHx-TPO profile in the dark, the UV-vis-IR irradiation significantly promotes the oxidation of pre-deposited CHx* species as a rate-determining step (Fig. S22, ESI†). Similar promotion for the oxidation of pre-deposited CHx* species on Co/Co–Al2O3 with vis-IR irradiation of λ > 420 and 560 nm is observed (Fig. S22, ESI†).
To unveil whether the photoactivation affects carbon deposition, temperature-programmed CO disproportionation (a major side-reaction of carbon deposition) on Co/Co–Al2O3 was conducted in the dark and under irradiation (see Experimental, ESI†). Compared to the profile in the dark, the CO consumption peak around 497 °C due to CO disproportionation is significantly reduced upon UV-vis-IR irradiation (Fig. 10A). The carbon deposition rate (rC) with UV-vis-IR irradiation is calculated to be 3.3 × 10−3 gc gcatalyst−1 h−1, which is 13 times lower than that in the dark (Fig. 10B). Similar inhibition of CO disproportionation on Co/Co–Al2O3 with vis-IR irradiation of λ > 420 and 560 nm is observed (Fig. S23, ESI†). This result indicates that the photoactivation also significantly reduces the carbon deposition rate, thus improving photothermocatalytic durability.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Co–Al2O3) was synthesized. With focused UV-vis-IR irradiation, Co/Co–Al2O3 shows high light-to-fuel efficiency and production rates of CO and H2 for photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4. Compared to the reference Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the formation of the unique Co/Co–Al2O3 nanocomposite significantly promotes catalyst durability. The improved durability is ascribed to the fact that O atoms of Co–Al2O3 at the interface of Co nanoparticles and Co doped Al2O3 accelerate the oxidation of C* species formed by both CH4 dissociation and CO disproportionation as side reactions of carbon deposition. The high photothermocatalytic activity is ascribed to effective light-driven thermocatalysis substantially boosted by new photoactivation: the focused UV-vis-IR irradiation substantially reduces the activation energy, thus considerably improving the catalytic activity. The new photoactivation also significantly inhibits the side reaction of CO disproportionation, thus promoting catalyst durability. This work actualizes extremely effective CO2 reduction to fuels with high light-to-fuel efficiency and excellent catalyst durability, which is very promising for tackling the issues of solar energy storage and global warming induced by CO2.

Broader context
Energy shortages and severe environmental issues induced by enormous CO2 discharges are primary global challenges. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is especially attractive, as it can not only actualize solar energy storage, but also tackle global warming induced by CO2. However, low solar-to-fuel efficiencies and low CO2 reduction rates are primary obstacles for actualizing the targets. Photocatalysis for solar fuels is based on the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers on diverse semiconductors. But the majority of the solar energy absorbed by semiconductors is lost in the form of thermal energy through the fast combination of charge carriers. The key to overcoming these obstacles is to search for new photocatalysts and/or new strategies different from photocatalysis that can utilize the lost thermal energy. In this work, we achieve high light-to-fuel efficiency (27.1%) and production rates of CO and H2 (43.46 and 39.42 mmol min−1 g−1) through photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 (the main component of abundant natural gas resources) on a unique nanocomposite of Co nanoparticles supported on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets with UV-vis-IR irradiation. This work provides an outstanding approach for tackling the issues of solar energy storage and global warming induced by CO2.
