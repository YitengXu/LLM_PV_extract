    , Accepted 4th November 2020First published on 5th November 2020AbstractAsymmetric molecular configuration shows great potential in the design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, NFAs with multi-asymmetric factors are seldom explored and the structure–property relationship between different asymmetric isomers is unrevealed. Herein, two NFAs 2FIFIC and ICIF2F were rationally designed by simultaneously introducing an asymmetric bridge and a terminal group into the A1–D–π–A2 configuration. These two NFAs were synthesized in a one-pot reaction and separated facilely using silica gel column chromatography. Although 2FIFIC and ICIF2F have almost identical absorption profiles and similar energy levels, the diversity of asymmetry endows these two molecules with varied miscibility blending with the donor polymer PM6, leading to different morphology in blend films. The relatively low miscibility between 2FIFIC and PM6 enables their blend film to form a nanoscale fiber-like domain and stronger phase separation. This favorable morphology enhances the electron mobility and restrains charge recombination in PM6:2FIFIC devices, thus delivering a higher short circuit current density (Jsc), eventually providing a better PCE of 11.34% than that of ICIF2F based devices (9.60%). This work demonstrates that introducing multi-asymmetric factors into NFAs is a fruitful way of advancing OSCs, and the results revealed here are helpful in the design of new asymmetric NFAs.
Introduction
As one of the promising clean energy technologies for harvesting solar energy, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted enormous attention due to their advantages of light weight, mechanical flexibility, and semitransparency.1–5 Attributed to the emergence of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are growing explosively and the state-of-the-art OSC has achieved PCEs of 18% in a single junction device.6–8 Among the NFAs, fused-ring electron acceptors with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular configuration are widely investigated and have demonstrated the potential for advancing the PCEs in OSCs.9–14 In A–D–A type NFAs, the molecular configuration is axisymmetric or centrosymmetric, i.e. the symmetric D core is flanked by two same A units.15–20 Generally, electron-donating aromatic fused-rings (D), like indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), are used as the donor core to construct a large conjugation to facilitate good intermolecular packing via strong π–π interactions, and thereby are beneficial for exciton diffusion and charge transport, while strong electron-withdrawing units (A), e.g. 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) and its derivatives, are covalently linked to the core to form a push–pull structure to induce an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and thus achieve a suitable bandgap and energy level to ensure photon absorption and exciton dissociation.21–28 Sometimes π spacers, either electron-rich or electron-deficient aromatic rings, are introduced as a bridge between the D core and the A terminal to form an A–π–D–π–A structure, which is proven to be a successful strategy to further tune the molecular geometry and electron distribution of relevant NFAs.29–31
Notably, NFAs with asymmetric configuration have been recently developed, which retain the advantages of symmetric NFAs, such as chemical structure tunability and excellent optoelectronic properties.32 Moreover, asymmetric counterparts may additionally exhibit a large dipole moment, which is helpful to overcome the Coulomb binding energy to improve the exciton dissociation. In addition, the dipole–dipole force is believed to enhance the intermolecular interaction to increase the packing order.33 These merits allow asymmetric NFAs to surpass their symmetric analogues on device performance in OSCs. To introduce the asymmetry into the molecular structure, chemical modification can be performed on the central donor cores (D), terminal accepting units (A), outstretched side chains and π spacers.34–40 Most of investigations are focused on the modification of D cores and A terminals.41 For example, Yang and co-workers reported the core asymmetric units of IDT6CN and its analogues, wherein the devices based on these asymmetric NFAs exhibit higher FFs compared with their corresponding symmetric ones.42–44 Furthermore, they developed a series of NFAs with asymmetric cores and demonstrated the conformation-tuning effect on the photovoltaic performance.45 Based on extensively asymmetric D cores, over 15% PCEs have been achieved recently by many groups.46,47 The asymmetric strategy based on terminal groups has also been widely studied. Hou et al. reported an asymmetric NFA IT-3F by using difluorinated and monofluorinated IC moieties as terminal groups. The asymmetric IT-3F exhibited higher electron mobility than its symmetric analogues and yielded higher PCE with PBDB-TF as the donor polymer.48 Bo and co-workers have synthesized for the first time an asymmetric acceptor namely a-IT-2OM flanked by one IC group and one dimethoxy-substituted IC group on the IDTT core. Owing to the asymmetric design, the solar cells based on a-IT-2OM delivered a promising PCE of 12.07% with PBDB-T.49 The Tobin group developed two asymmetric acceptors (ITIC-2F and ITIC-3F) with different end groups, which exhibit a significant diversity of device performance.50 Yan et al. further developed asymmetric terminal groups based on BTP-2F-ThCl to boost the PCE by over 17%.51 For the outstretched side chain asymmetry, Bo and co-workers have done pioneering work by simultaneously substituting the side chains on the IDT core with alkyl phenyl and alkyl side chains.52 Compared to symmetric IDT-2O and IDT-2B, the asymmetric IDT-OB exhibited reduced crystallinity and better solubility, leading to favorable phase separation in blend films, consequently delivering high and balanced charge mobility in OSCs. Recently, Sun et al. reported a new NFA namely TTPT-T-2F with an asymmetric π spacer. By employing only one π spacer, the A–D–π–A configuration of TTPT-T-2F endows the blend film with an optimal morphology, and thus better device performance is realized.53 Based on the same strategy, Li et al. reported a new acceptor IDST-4F with an asymmetric π spacer, which achieved over 14% PCE.38
The aforementioned paradigms have demonstrated that using an asymmetric structure is a successful strategy for tuning the molecular geometry to achieve an ideal morphology in OSCs. Notably, only one asymmetric moiety, either the core, terminal group, side chain, or π bridge, is involved in previous reports, which mainly concentrated on comparing the difference between asymmetric and symmetric analogues.32 However, the molecules with multi-asymmetric units are seldom explored, and the difference among asymmetric molecules is not unraveled. Herein, by flank linking two different terminal groups IC and fluorinated IC (2FIC) to the asymmetric core (IF) consisting of IDT and fluorinated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (FTT), two A1–D–π–A2 type NFAs 2FIFIC and ICIF2F with an asymmetric bridge and a terminal group, were synthesized in a one-pot reaction and separated facilely using silica gel column chromatography. More importantly, the chemical structures were successfully identified by 1H NMR. These two NFAs show almost identical absorption band and similar energy levels. However, the diversity of molecular geometry induced by varied asymmetries endows these two NFAs with varied miscibility. Compared to ICIF2F, 2FIFIC is prone to be less miscible with the donor polymer PM6, thus leading to favorable phase separation in blend films, consequently restraining the charge recombination. Eventually, the OSC devices show similar open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) but significantly different short circuit current density (Jsc), allowing the 2FIFIC based device to exhibit a higher PCE of 11.34% than that of the ICIF2F based device (9.60%).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As A1–D–π–A2 type NFAs, the widely used IDT with linear octyl side chains was chosen as the D core, and FTT was selected as the π bridge wherein the orientation of the fluorine atom was manipulated to be adjacent to the IDT core to optimize the molecular geometry as in the previous reports.54 Then IC and 2FIC were introduced as asymmetric terminal groups, consequently providing two asymmetric isomers 2FIFIC and ICIF2F as shown in Scheme 1. Generally, 2FIFIC and ICIF2F could be prepared individually by sequential two-step Knoevenagel reactions, which is tedious. However, by mixing compound 4 and two acceptors (IC and 2FIC) together as shown in Scheme 1, we accomplished the synthesis of these two molecules with decent yields in a one-pot reaction, while only small amounts of ICIFIC and 2FIF2F (Fig. 1) with same terminal groups were found, indicating the excellent chemoselectivity compared to that of the previous studies wherein stepwise reaction was essential,49 or an identical amount of byproduct was found.48 More importantly, these two isomers were facilely separated and purified using silica gel column chromatography. However, 1H NMR and mass spectra of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F could not afford adequate information to distinguish the individually accurate structure of these two isomers, since they have identical molecular weights and the same amount of protons. To address this issue, the chemical structures of ICIFIC and 2FIF2F were firstly identified by mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 1), there are two peaks (Ha and Hb) with the chemical shift of around 9.0–8.8 pm ascribed to the protons of CC bonds between the terminal groups and the IF core. According to the previous reports,10,31,46,54,55 the Ha peak downfield (around 9.0 ppm) is attributed to the proton adjacent to IDT, while the Hb proton (around 8.8 ppm) is next to the FTT unit. Comparing the 1H NMR spectra of ICIFIC and 2FIF2F, it is evident that the terminal group with fluorine make the chemical shifts of both Ha and Hb move to a higher field. Fortunately, protons Ha and Hb of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F show slightly different chemical shifts, wherein the Ha upfield (8.97 ppm) and downfield (8.99 ppm) suggest that the terminal groups adjacent to IDT core are 2FIC and IC, respectively. Based on these facts, the structures of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F are successfully identified.

The optical properties are characterized by absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the two acceptors are found to have similar absorption features in both dilute solution and solid states. The absorption maximum of ICIF2F in solution is located at 760 nm with a extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.72 × 105 M−1 cm−1, while 2FIFIC exhibits a slightly blueshifted maximum peaked at 750 nm with an εmax of 1.67 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The slight blueshift might be related to the reduced ICT effect in 2FIFIC. Compared to solution, the films show obvious aggregation peaks in the absorption spectra, with maxima at 817 nm for 2FIFIC and 823 nm for ICIF2F, respectively, indicating that these two NFAs are able to form excellent J-aggregation in the solid state. In addition, 2FIFIC showed a higher εmax (1.13 × 105 cm−1) in the film than in ICIF2F (0.86 × 105 cm−1), suggesting the higher packing order of 2FIFIC.56 The optical band-gaps (Eg) of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F estimated from the absorption edge of corresponding films are 1.38 eV and 1.36 eV, respectively.

To study the electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted (Fig. S3, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F are estimated from the onset redox potentials to be −5.45/−3.97 eV, −5.45/−4.02 eV, respectively. The corresponding energy level diagram and data are listed in Fig. 2c and Table 1. Based on these data, it is notable that the connection of the terminal groups on the IF core affects the energy levels. The 2FIC group is regarded as an acceptor with a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than the IC group, while FTT is recognized as a weaker acceptor. Therefore, the LUMO will slightly downshift when 2FIC is covalently linked to the FTT unit in ICIF2F. However, the two NFAs featured the same HOMO levels. The energy levels of both 2FIFIC and ICIF2F are comparable with the classical wide-bandgap donor PM6 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, the varied connections of terminal groups also impact the dipole moments. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), 2FIFIC exhibits a bigger dipole moment of 4.68 debye than ICIF2F (4.22 debye) while the directions of the dipole moments are significantly different due to the various electron-withdrawing abilities of terminal groups.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of NFAs, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs were fabricated with the conventional device architecture of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:acceptor/ZnO/Al. The active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution with the optimized weight ratio of PM6:acceptors as 1:1.4, with 0.5% chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive, and thermal annealing (TA) at 110 °C was utilized to further enhance the device performance. The details of device optimization are summarized in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under the optimized conditions and the detailed device parameters are listed in Table 2. The ICIF2F based device shows a decent PCE of 9.60% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 19.61 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.0%, while the isomer 2FIFIC exhibits similar Voc (0.80 V) and FF (62.2%,), but dramatically prompts the Jsc to 22.80 mA cm−2, leading to a higher PCE of 11.34%. To understand the huge difference of Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the devices were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves are 22.10 and 19.22 mA cm−2 for the 2FIFIC and ICIF2F based devices, respectively. All the integrated Jsc values are within about 5% error compared to those values obtained from J–V curves. Compared to devices based on ICIF2F, the 2FIFIC based device shows obviously stronger response in the whole EQE spectra. However, these two blend films exhibit similar absorption spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†); in particular, the PM6:ICIF2F film even has stronger absorption in the range 400–650 nm, which is attributed to the absorption of PM6. This fact suggests these two blend films have different exciton dissociation and charge transport, which will be investigated in the next section.

Charge transport and recombination
Firstly, the charge transport behaviors of the blend films were evaluated for hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:NFAs/MoO3/Al and electron-only devices ITO/ZnO/PM6:NFAs/ZnO/Al using the space–charge limited current (SCLC) method. As displayed in Table 2 and Fig. S7 (ESI†), The hole and electron mobilities for the PM6:2FIFIC film were calculated to be 1.06 × 10−4 and 7.98 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PM6:ICIF2F blend film exhibits a similar hole mobility (1.07 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) but relatively low electron mobility (5.68 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1). The charge carrier recombination was further investigated by measuring the correlationship between Voc or Jsc and light intensity (Plight) as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The values of the slope for the 2FIFIC and ICIF2F based devices are 1.07 and 1.17, respectively, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination is significantly suppressed in the 2FIFIC based device while it occurs partially in the ICIF2F based device. The relationship between Jsc and Plight was further characterized to investigate the bimolecular recombination. The dependence of Jsc with Plight can be described as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where the exponential α approaching 1 indicates suppressed bimolecular recombination. The values of α for the 2FIFIC and ICIF2F based devices are 0.999 and 0.988, respectively, suggesting that the 2FIFIC based device has less bimolecular recombination than the ICIF2F based device. These results demonstrate that the device based on 2FIFIC realized higher electron mobility while charge recombination is significantly suppressed, which rationalizes its higher Jsc. Considering that the electron transport mainly relies on the network of NFAs in blend films, the diversity of electron mobility implies that 2FIFIC and ICIF2F have different packing in blend films.56 The charge recombination behavior is closely related to the interface of PM6 and NFAs, which is determined by the crystallinity and miscibility of the semiconductors. Therefore, the morphology is further studied as shown in the next section.
Morphology characterization
To investigate the effect of different asymmetries on the morphology of films, the morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The neat film of 2FIFIC exhibits a uniform distribution of the crystal domain with a similar size and a relatively small root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.34 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†). For ICIF2F, both small grain and large cloudlike clusters are found, leading to a larger RMS roughness of 0.45 nm. This result demonstrates 2FIFIC has a higher packing order in neat films, which is also verified by its higher extinction coefficient in the absorption spectra. Fig. 4 displays the AFM height and phase images of the blend films. Smooth uniform surfaces are observed in both blend films. For the PM6:2FIFIC blend film, well-distributed nano-fibrillar textures are observed with an RMS of 2.28 nm. In particular, the sharp contrast between the dark and bright regions, i.e. the clear grain boundary, implies a strong phase separation of PM6 and 2FIFIC, which are good for suppressing charge recombination. Meanwhile the individual domains of PM6 and 2FIFIC are connected to each other with the size of around 30–40 nm. This bicontinuous nanoscale network is beneficial for exciton diffusion and dissociation as well as charge transport. In contrast, a relatively amorphous morphology with a smaller RMS roughness of 1.37 nm is observed in the PM6:ICIF2F blend film. Although fiber-like structures are also present, the grain boundary is quite blurred, which might be ascribed to the mixed phase of PM6 and ICIF2F. This result is well consistent with the serious charge recombination of the ICIF2F based device.

The microstructure of the blend films were further studied by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. S9 (ESI†) displays the two dimensional (2D) pattern and corresponding 1D line cutting profiles in out-of-the-plane (OOP) and in-the-plane (IP) directions. Both of the blend films exhibit preferential face-on packing with strong π–π stacking (010) diffraction signals in the OOP direction. However, the PM6:ICIF2F film shows a broad 010 peak corresponding to a large diversity of d-spacings, implying the existence of different π–π stacking modes. As reported in literature studies,57,58PM6 shows a 010 peak around 1.67 A−1 in OOP, which is observed in these two blend films but being overlapped with the signals of NFAs. In addition, ICIF2F exhibits a 010 peak at qxy ≈ 1.79 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.51 Å, with the crystal coherence length (CCL) = 27.0 Å, while 2FIFIC presents a 010 peak at qxy ≈ 1.68 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.73 Å, with CCL = 31.9 Å. Although the packing of ICIF2F is slightly tight, the longer CCL of 2FIFIC suggests that the latter has a better packing order, which is consistent with the fact the PM6:2FIFIC film presents a stronger phase separation and clear grain boundary.
Such appreciable difference of morphology might be resulting from the varied miscibility of PM6 and NFAs. Thus the miscibility of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F is investigated by measuring the surface tension.59 As shown in Fig. 5 and Table S4 (ESI†), the contact angles of two solvents (water and diiodomethane (DIM)) on three neat films were measured. The PM6 film shows the biggest water contact angle (98.2°) while the contact angle of ICIF2F (96.1°) is bigger than that of 2FIFIC (90.9°). The same tendency can be observed for the contact angle of diiodomethane. Based on the data for the contact angle, the surface tensions (γ) calculated using the Wu model are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).60 According to Flory–Huggins theory, the miscibility can be evaluated from the interaction parameter χ based upon the relation . As a result, the χ parameter of the PM6:2FIFIC blend (1.57) is higher than that of PM6:ICIF2F (1.18), indicating that PM6 prefers to be miscible with ICIF2F rather than 2FIFIC.59 The miscibility with suitable intensity is essential for BHJ to form an adequate donor/acceptor interface to facilitate the exciton dissociation; however, excessively strong miscibility in the case of PM6:ICIF2F deteriorates the self-aggregation, and also creates the mixed phase with low crystallinity which locates at the donor/acceptor interface as seen in the AFM image. This amorphous region will aggravate both monomolecular and bimolecular recombination due to the defect and the unfavorable pathway for charge transport. In contrast, 2FIFIC has moderate miscibility with PM6, leading to nanoscale phase separation while the domains of donor and acceptor have a higher packing order. Therefore, the different miscibility of 2FIFIC and ICIF2F elucidate the diversity of morphology in the relevant blend films.

Conclusions
In summary, multi-asymmetric molecular configuration A1–D–π–A2 is firstly introduced into non-fullerene acceptors. By flank linking two different terminal groups IC and 2FIC to the asymmetric IF core, two isomers 2FIFIC and ICIF2F with an asymmetric bridge and terminal group, were synthesized in a one-pot reaction and separated facilely using silica gel column chromatography. The two compounds have the same asymmetric core and the same terminal groups, but different connection ways, leading to their similar physical and chemical properties. Fortunately, the chemical structures of two isomers are successfully identified by 1H NMR and mass spectra. Due to the planar geometry, both of two molecules exhibit strong intermolecular packing in the solid state, demonstrated by the intensive aggregation peaks in the absorption spectra of films. However, the diversity of asymmetry result in 2FIFIC and ICIF2F having varied miscibility with the donor polymer PM6. 2FIFIC is less miscible with the donor polymer PM6, leading to nanoscale domain and favorable phase separation in blend films, while a blurred boundary of the ICIF2F and PM6 phases is observed, which is verified by AFM and GIWAXS. The favourable morphology of PM6:2FIFIC significantly enhances the electron mobility and suppresses charge recombination, consequently boosting the Jsc to 22.80 mA cm−2, eventually allowing the 2FIFIC based device to exhibit a higher PCE of 11.34% than that of ICIF2F based devices (9.60%). This work builds a new avenue to develop NFAs with multi-asymmetric factors, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial for tuning the morphology and achieving high efficiency.
