    , Accepted 28th April 2017First published on 1st May 2017AbstractThe need for NIR absorbing materials has become a focus of organic photovoltaics. We synthesize three benzannulated aza-BODIPY dyes with heterocyclic substituents, namely N-methyl pyrrole, N-methyl indole and 2-trimethylsilyl thiophene. With one fluorine atom in the BF2 moiety replaced by a cyano group, three corresponding derivatives are further synthesized. As NIR absorbers, these dyes present high molar extinction coefficients (65100–104500 L mol−1 cm−1) in solutions with absorption maxima in the range between 762 and 797 nm. In vacuum-deposited thin films, their absorption bands are further bathochromically shifted peaking from 830 to 849 nm and broadened. CV measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the frontier molecular orbital levels of these compounds are suitable as donor materials in solar cells when combined with C60 as the acceptor. We obtain a PCE of 3.0% and a Voc of 0.61 V, which are rather high values for NIR absorbing vacuum processable small molecular donor compounds, with an absorption onset around 950 nm.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has been regarded as a promising technology to supply renewable clean energy and planar/bulk heterojunction (PHJ/BHJ) solar cells have been studied intensively due to their special advantages such as small device weight, abundant functional materials and the possibility of flexible devices.1–5 One drawback of organic solar cells (OSCs) is the lack of solar energy harvesting in the NIR range with wavelengths longer than 760 nm, containing 43% of the total energy flux. While low bandgap polymers have recently started to fill this vacancy for solution-processed devices6–11 and the efficiency of NIR OSCs with ultra-low band gap polymers has reached over 1%,12 small molecule NIR absorbing materials, which possess exact molecular structures and constant batch-to-batch performance, are still rare.13–16 Especially in vacuum processed multi-layer tandem or triple devices, such materials, which can extend the response window to the NIR range, are predicted to significantly increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE), given a sufficiently high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and external quantum efficiency (EQE).17–19
Due to the small molecular volume, excellent stability and high extinction coefficient, aza-boron-dipyrromethene (aza-BODIPY) has been intensively investigated in various fields, such as bio-imaging,20,21 chemosensing22–24 and photodynamic therapy.25,26 As illustrated in Scheme 1, as compared to the conventional aza-BODIPY (A), the benzannulated aza-BODIPY (boron-diisoindolylimine, (B)) has the advantage of longer absorption wavelengths and a more straightforward synthetic route.27–29 For these reasons, aza-BODIPY dyes with structure (B) are potential NIR donor materials for vacuum processed OSCs.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of conventional aza-BODIPY (A), benzannulated aza-BODIPY (B) and an aza-BODIPY derivative with a CN co-ligand (C). 
From a chemistry perspective, both reported structures and synthetic routes for aza-BODIPY are rare. For (B), most R moieties are limited to substituted phenyl rings, such as o/p-methoxyl-phenyl, p-fluoro-phenyl and dimethylamino-phenyl, etc.27 In terms of the synthetic methods, reported routes include (a) heating 1,3-diaryl-4-nitrobutan-1-one or 3-methyl-4-nitro-1-arylbutan-1-one;25,30,31 (b) reacting pyrrole with nitrosopyrrole;32,33 (c) reacting phthalonitrile with tBuOK;34 (d) reacting phthalonitrile with Grignard reagents.27,28 For the synthesis of symmetric benzannulated aza-BODIPY, method (d) seems to be the most straightforward route. However, to date, no other organometallic nucleophiles have been reported to replace Grignard reagents, although they may have a similar reaction mechanism and wider structural manipulation possibilities.
In this work, we extend the structural possibilities of benzannulated aza-BODIPY by introducing various heterocyclic moieties as R groups and successfully synthesize three NIR dyes via a newly developed route with heterocyclic organolithium reagents. These aza-BODIPY dyes are further modified by replacing one of the fluorine atoms with a cyano group that has a stronger electron withdrawing effect and synthesize asymmetric aza-BODIPY derivatives with BF(CN) structures ((C), Scheme 1).35 These dyes can be purified by vacuum sublimation, delivering high quality donor materials for vacuum processed OSCs showing reasonable EQE values of up to 45% under NIR radiation.
Results and discussion
The aza-BODIPY dyes are synthesized using a modified route following former publications in which the reaction mechanisms with phenyl Grignard reagents are described (Scheme 2 and S1†).27 Herein, Grignard reagents are replaced by heterocyclic organolithium reagents characterized by a higher reactivity and easier preparation. The lithiation of N-methyl-pyrrole, N-methyl-indole and 2-trimethylsilyl-thiophene is carried out in anhydrous THF at −78 °C and the reaction system is allowed to reach room temperature in 2 h to guarantee the completeness of the lithiation. The as such formed heterocyclic organolithium reagent (1.2 equiv.) is added dropwise to a THF solution of phthalonitrile at −78 °C. After removing the solvent, formamide is added into the lithium salts of the corresponding 1-heteroarylisoindoylimine and the system is rapidly heated to reflux for several minutes, giving the raw product as a dark solid precipitate. The formed diisoindolylimine precursors 1a–3a are purified by column chromatography. Subsequently, these precursors are treated with DIPEA (10 equiv.) and boron trifluoride etherate (10 equiv.) in dry DCM to provide aza-BODIPY dyes 1b–3b. Aza-BODIPY derivatives 1c–3c are obtained via the reaction of 1b–3b with trimethylsilyl cyanide (10 equiv.) in the presence of aluminum chloride (2 equiv.) in dry DCM. All the aza-BODIPY dyes and their derivatives are fully characterized by 1H/13C/19F NMR and MS. The structures of 1c, 2a, 2b and 3b are further determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements.
 Scheme 2  The molecular structures and synthetic route to aza-BODIPY dyes and their derivatives. 
Single crystals of 1c, 2b and 3b (Fig. 1 and Table S1/S2†) are obtained by slow diffusion of hexane into DCM solutions and all the samples crystallize in a P space group under a triclinic crystal system. The boron atoms adopt a tetrahedral geometry with B–N bond lengths of 1.549 to 1.571 Å and B–F bond lengths of 1.360 to 1.381 Å, which are similar to previous reports.36–381c presents a B–CN bond length of 1.613 Å, even longer than the B–N bonds. The intramolecular F⋯H–C bonds are estimated to be in the range of 2.21 to 2.60 Å, which are smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii for hydrogen and fluorine (2.62 Å).39 This indicates the intramolecular interaction between heterocyclic substituents and fluorine atoms. For 1c and 3b, such interactions are mainly located on one fluorine atom, but for 2b, each fluorine atom presents a hydrogen bond with one N-methyl-indole substituent. The diisoindolylimine main core has a planar structure and the heterocyclic substituents are tilted by different degrees relative to the main core. For 2a (Fig. S4†), these dihedral angles are [25.1, 38.0] degrees and they are [49.7, 58.8], [52.0, 57.0] and [18.2, 30.0] degrees for 1c, 2b and 3b, respectively. According to the packing diagrams (Fig. S5†), 2a and 3b show π–π stacking effects via both the main core and one of the heterocyclic substituents, making the dihedral angle of this substituent quite small. However, for 1c and 2b, such π–π stacking effects are only observed via the main cores of the adjacent molecules. Thus, the relatively free heterocyclic substituents present larger dihedral angles. The geometry of 3b is more like 1c than 2b due to both the F⋯H–C interaction and the π–π stacking effect of the thiophene ring.
 Fig. 1  Top views (i) and side views (ii) of 1c, 2b, 3b X-ray crystal structures with the thermal ellipsoids set at 60% probability (C: black, N: blue, F: green, S: yellow, Si: orange, and B: dark yellow). 
For donor materials in vacuum processed BHJ solar cells, high thermal stability is required as the premise for the sublimation. Thus, TG and DSC investigations (Fig. 2) of aza-BODIPY dyes and their derivatives are performed. According to Fig. 2, if a weight loss of 5% is considered as a reference, 1b–3b present higher decomposition temperatures as compared to 1c–3c. These temperatures are in the range of 280–310 °C for 1b, 1c, 3b and 3c. Although 2b has the highest decomposition temperature around 350 °C, 2c presents a continuous weight loss after 100 °C, making 2c not suitable for sublimation in a large amount. In the DSC plots, a sharp endothermic peak indicates that the melting point is observed for every compound and this temperature is much lower than the decomposition temperature (except 2c), indicating a higher chance of stability during sublimation. Sublimation yields of 1b/1c and 3b/3c are from 44% to 83% when using rather large amounts (1000 mg). Although the yield of 2b is as high as 70% when using a smaller amount (300 mg), this value drastically decreases to 10% when using a large amount.
 Fig. 2  The TGA (i) and DSC (ii) plots of 1b–3b and 1c–3c. 
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra are recorded in DCM (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The profiles of all the compounds are similar with weak absorption bands from 300 to 500 nm and distinctively strong absorption bands from 550 to 850 nm. The precursors 1a–3a present their maximum absorption peaks at 664, 689 and 723 nm. Upon chelation with the BF2 moiety, these strong absorption bands show obvious bathochromic shifts and the peaks of 1b–3b are observed at 762, 777 and 793 nm. Meanwhile, the extinction coefficients of the aza-BODIPY dyes increase by 50% (from 65100 to 89600 M−1 cm−1) and the full width at half maximum values (FWHM) are around 20 nm narrower than for the precursors. In the case of derivatives 1c–3c, these strong absorption bands present further small but appreciable bathochromic shifts of 12, 16 and 4 nm, respectively, and increased extinction coefficients ranging from 68600 to 104500 M−1 cm−1 are observed. Considering the limited backbone length, such strong absorption in the NIR region indicates that the π electron delocalization is quite effective in these molecules. Given that these intensive absorption bands in the long wavelength range are generated by the S0 → S1 electron transition, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps have evidently decreased from precursors to aza-BODIPY dyes and maintain a comparable level after the introduction of a CN group.

Thin films of 1b–3b and 1c–3c with a thickness of 50 nm are fabricated by vacuum deposition and their absorption in the solid state is investigated. The main absorption bands in the NIR range present bathochromic shifts which may stem from J-aggregation, resulting in absorption peaks in the range from 830 to 850 nm. Meanwhile, the bands are broadened obviously covering a wide scale from 650 to 950 nm, which is favorable to harvest more solar photons. Fluorescence spectra (Fig. S6†) are obtained in diluted DCM solutions at room temperature. All the emission bands present a mirror image relationship with the corresponding absorption bands. For 1b/1c, the Stokes shifts are around 30 nm, whereas for 2b/2c and 3b/3c, these values increase to around 50 nm. All these dyes show relatively strong emission in the NIR region peaking from 798 to 849 nm. The fluorescence quantum yields were measured from 0.9% to 4.0% using rhodamine 101 inner salt as the reference.
The frontier molecular orbital properties of all compounds are investigated by both electrochemistry and theoretical calculations (Table 2, Fig. 4 and S8†). According to the cyclic voltammetry measurements, the HOMO energy levels of 1a–3a are from −4.68 to −4.86 eV and the LUMO energy levels range from −3.18 to −3.51 eV. After chelation with a BF2 group, the HOMO energy levels of 1b–3b decrease by around 0.2 eV and the LUMO energy levels decrease by 0.49, 0.39 and 0.30 eV, respectively, making the HOMO–LUMO gaps of aza-BODIPY dyes smaller than those of their precursors. For the derivatives 1c–3c, both HOMO and LUMO levels are further stabilized by a similar degree. Consequently, the energy gaps of 1c–3c are almost the same compared to those of the corresponding aza-BODIPY dyes. These observations reproduce the trends derived from the absorption spectra and explain why the differences of the maximum absorption peaks between aza-BODIPY dyes and their derivatives are marginal. In terms of the DFT calculation results, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are derived from the geometry optimization results. We find that the calculated HOMOs are around 0.1 eV higher and the LUMOs are about 0.7 eV higher than the experimental results. Despite that, the trends are well reproduced both qualitatively and quantitatively.

EHOMO = −(Eox − EFc/Fc+) − 4.78 eV, ELUMO = −(Ered − EFc/Fc+) − 4.78 eV; for aza-BODIPY precursors, ferrocene is used as an external standard to avoid overlap and for aza-BODIPY dyes and their derivatives ferrocene is used as an internal standard.
c The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO is calculated as ΔEH–L = ELUMO − EHOMO.

 Fig. 4  The HOMO/LUMO energy levels measured by CV for 1a–1c, 2a–2c, 3a–3c (black) and the corresponding DFT simulation results (gray). 
The hole mobilities are measured in organic field-effect transistors (OFET). For 1b–3b, we obtain 9.2 × 10−6, 6.6 × 10−6 and 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. For the N-methyl pyrrole compound, the exchange of F by CN gives a slightly higher hole mobility (1.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), while for the 2-trimethylsilyl thiophene compound it is reduced to 4.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. These relatively low mobilities may originate from the lack of efficient π–π stacking in the solid state. PHJ devices with n–i–p architecture are fabricated by vacuum deposition of 1b–3b as well as 1c–3c as the donor and C60 as the acceptor (devices 1Bp–3Bp and 1Cp–3Cp). The device structure with the sequence of ITO/C60:W2(hpp)4 (5 nm, 3 wt%)/C60 (15 nm)/donor (6 nm)/BF-DPB (5 nm)/BF-DPB:NDP9 (50 nm, 10 wt%)/NDP9 (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) is employed. The n-doped C60 and p-doped triarylamine BF-DPB layer serve as electron and hole transport layers. The J–V curves and the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 5 (data summarizes in Table 3). The highest efficiencies are obtained for 2b and 3b due to the highest FFs of 63% and 67%, respectively. As recombination occurs mainly at the planar interface between the donor and acceptor, differences in the FF are related to different hole mobilities of the donor compounds. Comparing the FFs obtained in devices with the measured hole mobilities, we find a positive correlation of increasing FF with increasing hole mobility separately for compounds 1b/1c and 3b/3c, whereas we do not find such a correlation for the different heterocyclic substituents (1–3). For compound 2b, we obtain a very high FF despite its low hole mobility. It is furthermore worth noting that the cyanation leads to an increase of the mobility for the N-methyl pyrrole compound, whereas the mobility is decreased for the BODIPY with 2-trimethylsilyl thiophene substitution. For the BF2 compounds, Voc directly follows the trend of the HOMO levels. The substitution of one fluorine atom by an electron withdrawing cyano group was expected to increase the Voc due to the fact that a lower lying HOMO energy level is only observed for the compounds with the N-methylpyrrole substituent 1 (devices 1Bp and 1Cp). The photocurrents are overall low with peak EQE values lower than 25%. We can estimate the lower limit of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by taking the peak absorption of the respective BODIPY material measured in the full device (neglecting parasitic absorption in other layers). For compound 2b with the highest photocurrent, we obtain a value of 36%. Compound 3b gives a much lower IQE of only 22%. Considering the high hole mobility and FF of 3b, we can attribute the low IQE to a shorter exciton diffusion length. The absorption measurements furthermore underline the strong extinction of those compounds, absorbing up to 40% of the light despite the fact that the thickness of the donor layer is only 6 nm.

BHJ devices with n–i–p architecture are further fabricated by vacuum deposition of 1b, 2b, 3b, 1c and 3c as the donor and C60 as the acceptor (devices 1Bb–3Bb and 1Cb–3Cb). The commonly used device structure with the sequence of ITO/MH250:W2(hpp)4 (5 nm, 7 wt%)/C60 (15 nm)/donor:C60 (1:3 v/v, 20 nm, 100 °C)/BF-DPB (5 nm)/BF-DPB:NDP9 (40 nm, 90:10 w/w)/NDP9 (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) is employed. In all devices, the temperature of the substrate is controlled to 100 °C during the deposition of the active layer to improve the morphology of the blend layer. The naphthalene–tetracarboxylicdiimide derivative MH250 replaces C60 as the electron transport material. The J–V curves and the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6 (data summarizes in Table 4). Similar to the PHJ devices, Voc still follows the trend of the HOMO energies, although being around 100 mV higher. The increase of Voc in BHJ devices compared to PHJ analogues was previously observed for BODIPY derivatives and other compounds and is generally attributed to a reduced crystallinity in the blend, and is most prominent for larger fullerene content.40,41 All devices exhibit similar, moderate fill factors (FF) ranging from 47% to 59%, which are lower compared to those of the PHJ devices, most likely caused by the low mobilities of the donors in the blend, and increased recombination in the active layers as well as a still non-ideal percolation network of donor and acceptor materials increasing the series resistance of the BHJ. In contrast to the PHJ devices, compound 3b (device 3Bb) yields the highest JSC. The high photocurrent is, however, not a result of strong absorption. In contrast to measurements in solution, where 3b showed the strongest absorption, the optical density in thin films is lowest for 3b as shown in Fig. 3(iv) this finding is also confirmed when the absorption is measured directly in the device (Fig. S11†). The estimation of the IQE reveals values around 40% for 1b and 2b, while it is nearly double the value for 3b (70%). The higher IQE for 3b is attributed to improved transport paths in the blend induced by the substrate heating process. As for the PHJ devices, the substitution of one fluorine atom with the cyano group leads to a strong reduction in the FF in the BHJ devices.

Overall, device 3Bb based on 3b returns the best results in this series of NIR absorber materials with the highest FF of 58% and a PCE of 2.2%. As the FF is only moderate despite the small layer thickness, we further optimize the substrate temperature and blend layer thickness. We obtain the best results at an increased substrate temperature of 120 °C and an increased active layer thickness of 50 nm (device 3Bb-opt). The increased absorption yields a 50% increase in JSC,100 to 9.3 mA cm−2 and a maximum EQE of 0.45 at 842 nm. Finally, we obtain the highest PCE of 3.0% using 3b as the donor material. Regarding the maximum absorption wavelength around 850 nm, this value is the highest efficiency ever obtained for vacuum-deposited small-molecule based solar cells with spectral sensitivity beyond 800 nm.
Conclusions
Three benzannulated aza-BODIPY dyes with heterocyclic substituents 1b–3b are synthesized via a newly developed route using heterocyclic organolithium reagents. This approach extends the scope of possible molecular structures of aza-BODIPY dyes. Distinctive absorption spectra with high extinction coefficients from 65100 to 89600 L mol−1 cm−1 and absorption maxima from 762 to 793 nm are observed in these dyes. Furthermore, asymmetric aza-BODIPY derivatives 1c–3c with BF(CN) structure by replacing one fluorine atom by a cyano group are synthesized. These derivatives also present outstanding absorption properties in the NIR range peaking from 774 to 797 nm with even higher extinction coefficients from 68600 to 104500 L mol−1 cm−1. Aza-BODIPY precursors, aza-BODIPYs and derivatives show different dihedral angles between the heterocyclic rings and the diisoindolylimine framework, which is caused by both the interaction of F–H hydrogen bonds and stacking effects. The frontier molecular orbitals are investigated by both CV measurements and DFT theoretical calculations. We find that by replacing the fluorine atom with the cyano group, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels in aza-BODIPY derivatives are stabilized simultaneously according to the TG and DSC studies, all the aza-BODIPY dyes and derivatives (except 2c) have high thermal stabilities, which is favorable for vacuum processed devices. With primary optimizations, the BHJ solar cells employing these dyes as donors and C60 as acceptor show PCEs from 1.4% to 2.6%. Based on 3b, further optimization yields a PCE around 3.0% with a Voc of 0.61 V. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is the highest value ever obtained for vacuum-deposited small-molecule based solar cells with spectral sensitivity beyond 800 nm, which is an encouraging step towards performance improvements of NIR sensitive small-molecule donor materials. Still, there is some work to do to increase the hole mobility, which is expected to be one of the main reasons for the moderate FFs obtained in the BHJ devices. Another issue is the non-optimal HOMO level, which limits the Voc. The energy levels should be shifted down to reduce the energy losses upon charge transfer. Finally, the implementation of these dyes in tandem or triple devices is an effective means to harvest sunlight with low losses.
