    , Accepted 21st July 2014First published on 21st July 2014AbstractThe performance of hybrid (organic–inorganic) photovoltaic devices is critically dependent on the thin film morphology. This work studies the film formation process using the in situ thermal decomposition of a soluble precursor to form a well-distributed network of CdS nanoparticles within a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) polymer matrix. Resonant Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the formation of the inorganic nanoparticles and the corresponding changes in the molecular order of the polymer. We find that the CdS precursor decomposes rapidly upon heating to 160 °C, but that this has a disruptive effect on the P3HT. The extent of this disruption can be controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature, and nanowire aggregates of P3HT are found to have increased susceptibility. Atomic force microscopy reveals that at high temperatures (>200 °C), cracks form in the film, resulting in a ‘plateau’-like microstructure. In order to retain the preferable ‘granular’ microstructure and to control the molecular disruption, low decomposition temperatures are needed. This work identifies a particular problem for optimising the hybrid thin film morphology and shows how it can be partially overcome.
Introduction
Hybrid (organic–inorganic) thin film photovoltaic devices seek to exploit the complementary attractive processability and optoelectronic properties of both organic and inorganic semiconductor materials.1 One promising approach to hybrid photoactive layers makes use of a soluble precursor for the inorganic material, which can be blended with an organic semiconductor in solution prior to deposition, and is then thermally decomposed to produce a three-dimensional inorganic semiconducting network within an organic thin film.2,3 One particular advantage of this approach is that it obviates the need for solubilising ligands, which can compromise device performance.4 The cadmium xanthate precursor has been designed to thermally decompose controllably at temperatures of approximately 150 °C to form cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles along with volatile side-products which are not expected to be retained in the polymer film. Moreover, solar cells comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and CdS produced in this way offer an improved exciton dissociation probability and higher overall device efficiency than comparable devices using simple blends of P3HT with CdS quantum dots.4
The performance of hybrid photovoltaic devices depends strongly on the nanoscale morphology of the thin film, ideally seeking a large interfacial area between continuous domains of organic and inorganic components. The morphology of experimental devices is found to be strongly dependent on the film deposition and processing conditions.5 In the case studied here, the formation of the CdS aggregate network shows a strong dependence on the thermal conditions of the decomposition process, and the weight ratio of the two components has been found to affect the P3HT morphology.6,7 Here, we investigate the evolution of the hybrid film morphology during thermal annealing using in situ resonant Raman spectroscopy to simultaneously monitor the formation of CdS nanoparticles and changes in the molecular order of the P3HT matrix. We find that the chemical decomposition of a cadmium xanthate precursor occurs very rapidly, reaching completion within 2 minutes of heating to 160 °C (previously reported as the optimum temperature for producing efficient solar cells),6 while the P3HT shows a corresponding disruption in its molecular order, which counteracts the increase in molecular order observed for thermal annealing of neat P3HT. Considering temperatures from 140 to 240 °C, we find that the lowest temperature is preferable for maintaining highly ordered P3HT. Furthermore, we test the pre-formation of P3HT nanowires in solution as a means to enhance the polymer molecular order, and find that the nanowire morphology shows increased susceptibility to disruption during the thermal decomposition of the CdS precursor. The increased disruption of the P3HT molecular order correlates with the formation of an increasingly intimate P3HT/CdS mixed phase, and ultimately leads to the development of a ‘plateau’-like film morphology with a high density of undesirable ‘cracks’ leading to a low device efficiency.
Experimental methods
P3HT was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich with regioregularity 90.0%, Mn = 22.3 kg mol−1 and PDI = 1.9. A regioregularity of 90–93% appears to be the optimum for well-controlled nanowire formation since lower regioregularity P3HT does not form ordered aggregates but higher regioregularity P3HT aggregation is difficult to control.8 Nanowire aggregates were prepared by temperature-controlled precipitation from xylene solution using a method described previously.9 The cadmium xanthate (Cd(S2COEt)2(C5H5N)2) precursor solution was prepared as described elsewhere in a dichlorobenzene solution.3 Solutions were blended to give a 50:50 solvent system and an 80:20 CdS:P3HT ratio by weight (after thermal annealing).
Devices were prepared in an inverted structure:7 ITO/TiO2/CdS/P3HT:CdS/PEDOT:PSS/Au. TiO2 was deposited by spin coating (4000 rpm) from a precursor solution (0.1 M titanium isopropoxide and acetylacetone in ethanol) followed by heating to 450 °C for 1 hour.10 A CdS interface layer was deposited from the precursor solution (4000 rpm), followed by annealing at 160 °C for 30 minutes. The active layer was then deposited on top (1000 rpm) before adding a PEDOT:PSS (Ossila AI 4083) layer (4000 rpm). Gold electrodes (100 nm) were then added by thermal evaporation at 5 × 10−6 mbar. Samples for the spectroscopic and microscopic studies were prepared on glass substrates.
UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was performed using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Resonant Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer coupled through a Leica DM2500M microscope. Emission at 457 nm from an argon ion laser was used as the excitation source, with a beam power of 100 μW and a 30 second exposure time. All Raman spectra were measured in a nitrogen environment and the laser excitation was defocussed to a 10 μm spot in order to minimise photodegradation of the sample. In situ Raman measurements during thermal annealing were performed with the sample in a Linkam THMS600 hot–cold cell. Atomic force microscopy was carried out using a Park NX10 instrument in the non-contact mode. The photovoltaic device performance was measured using a ScienceTech SS150W solar simulator with IR (Water Filter) and AM 1.5 (ScienceTech) filters, and a Keithley 2400 source measure unit.
Results and discussion

In situ measurements of hybrid film formation
The absorption spectra of the P3HT:CdS blend film before and after thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 1 alongside the spectra for the neat P3HT and CdS films. The absorption is measured from a transmittance measurement which does not distinguish scattering effects from true absorption, resulting in a sub-energy gap ‘absorption’ tail at long wavelengths (650–700 nm), which we attribute to light scattering in the neat P3HT film. CdS has an absorption onset at around 500 nm, whereas P3HT absorbs strongly between 450 and 650 nm. As a result the separate contributions from the two materials are readily distinguishable in the blend films. Before thermal annealing the absorption spectrum of the blend shows no contribution from CdS, but following thermal annealing there is strong absorption below 450 nm, showing that the CdS phase has formed. There is also a significant reduction in the strength of the P3HT absorption between 500 and 650 nm, suggesting a disruption of the polymer molecules, which we confirm below with Raman spectroscopy. The ratio of absorbances for the first and second absorption peaks (A0–0/A0–1) is a useful measure of intramolecular order, relating strongly to charge mobility.11 For the P3HT:CdS precursor blend film, this ratio decreases from 0.75 to 0.70 ± 0.01 during thermal annealing, corresponding with a reduction in the degree of intramolecular order. These conformational changes and their impact on device performance are considered in more detail below.

Resonant Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for elucidating the morphology of conjugated polymer samples, and is particularly useful as an in situ structural probe for morphological changes in thin film devices since it is fast, non-destructive, and compatible with other optical, electrical and physical characterisation techniques.9,12–18

Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra measured for the P3HT:CdS blend film before, during and after the thermal annealing at 160 °C. The 457 nm excitation laser is used to match the absorption bands of both materials, resulting in comparable resonant enhancements, so that the Raman scattering from each component can be measured simultaneously. This is shown in Fig. 2a where the main CdS peak (303 cm−1) is clearly visible alongside the main P3HT peaks (1350–1600 cm−1). The development of the CdS Raman peak is shown more clearly in Fig. 2b. The spectrum measured at room temperature before the thermal annealing shows no contribution from the CdS component, but when the heat is applied, the main 303 cm−1 peak appears along with a weaker overtone at 605 cm−1. These features appear within two minutes of annealing at 160 °C and remain unchanged up to 30 minutes, suggesting that the chemical decomposition is already complete within two minutes. However, upon quenching to room temperature, the CdS Raman peaks show a strong increase in intensity, though there is no change in their relative intensities. Shiang et al. associate this effect with an increase in the lifetime of the resonantly excited electronic state at lower temperature with no change in the size of the CdS nanocrystal domains.19 The same measurement on a neat film of the CdS precursor showed the same trend, indicating that the presence of P3HT does not significantly affect the CdS thermal decomposition process. The development of the CdS nanoparticles is represented in Fig. 3a where the 303 cm−1 peak intensity is plotted over time.

Arrows indicate the change in the overall degree of P3HT molecular order. 

Fig. 2a also shows a clear increase in the fluorescence background in the range 1000–1800 cm−1 for spectra measured at 160 °C compared with those measured at room temperature. This increased P3HT fluorescence at high temperatures is indicative of a reduction of intermolecular interactions in the P3HT, but a more detailed analysis can be made from the shapes of the Raman peaks shown in Fig. 2c. There are two main P3HT Raman modes centred around 1380 and 1450 cm−1, usually described as intra-ring C–C and CC symmetric backbone stretches respectively. The position, width (FWHM) and relative intensities of these peaks are known to be sensitive to the degree of molecular order in P3HT.14 Here the fluorescence background has been subtracted and the spectra are normalised for ease of comparison. During annealing (2 minutes and 30 minutes at 160 °C), the measured spectra show a small shift of both the C–C and CC peaks towards lower frequency and a broadening of the CC peak towards higher energy (FWHM increases from 37 to 42 ± 1 cm−1). We attribute the increase in peak width (which is preserved in the measurements after cooling to 20 °C) to a broadening of the distribution of molecular conformations in the sample. Comparing the spectra measured at 20 °C before and after annealing, the broadening is clearly due to an increase in the Raman scattering intensity on the high energy side of the CC peak (1450–1500 cm−1), which indicates a decrease in the molecular order of the P3HT in the blend.14 The small peak shift towards lower frequency (which is not preserved after cooling) is assigned to anharmonicity of the vibrational modes.20 At room temperature the polymer molecules are mostly in the ground vibrational state, but at elevated temperatures a higher proportion will be in vibrationally excited states. The energy spacings of all the vibrational levels of a particular normal mode are equal in harmonic potentials but deviations from harmonicity lead to reduced spacings for higher-lying vibrational transitions. Hence, at elevated temperatures the vibrational modes tend to shift towards lower energies in anharmonic potentials.
The disruption of P3HT molecular order observed here for the P3HT:CdS blend is the opposite trend to that observed for neat P3HT—the change in the CC peak FWHM against annealing time is shown in Fig. 3b for both of these samples. Since the changes in peak width occur only on the high energy part of the peak, this provides a good measure of the overall degree of P3HT molecular order. We find that the neat P3HT film shows increasing order (FWHM reduces from 36 to 33 ± 1 cm−1) during the thermal annealing, reaching completion in 5–10 minutes. By contrast, the P3HT:CdS blend shows a rapid disruption of polymer ordering (increasing from 37 to 42 ± 1 cm−1) within the first 2 minutes and shows no further change. This effect corresponds with the thermal decomposition of the CdS precursor which is observed simultaneously. These results give clear evidence that the thermal decomposition process, by which the CdS nanoparticles form, causes a simultaneous disruption of the molecular order in the P3HT polymer matrix. The disordered phase of P3HT has low hole mobility and blue-shifted absorption, which means that it is typically detrimental to solar cell performance. Therefore, this molecular disruption during film formation needs to be controlled and reduced. Below, we consider the use of different thermal annealing temperatures and the formation of P3HT nanowires as possible routes to minimise the disruptive interaction.
Decomposition temperature and nanowire P3HT
The cadmium xanthate precursor is designed to decompose at around 150 °C, so we consider temperatures over the range 140–240 °C and their impact on the film morphology. In each case we observe no difference in the rapid formation of the CdS component, but the effects on the P3HT Raman spectra are compared in Fig. 4a. In this case, as the temperature increases, the main CC peak broadens and then shifts to higher energy, while the C–C peak shifts to slightly lower energy and the relative intensity is reduced. These changes are typical characteristics of P3HT being more disordered, and hence demonstrate clearly that the P3HT molecular disordering effect caused by thermal decomposition of the CdS precursor is more pronounced at higher temperatures, with the maximum peak shift observed at the highest temperature, 240 °C.

We also consider the preparation of P3HT nanowire aggregates in solution, which has previously been reported as a technique for counteracting morphological disruption in blend films, and so it was hypothesised that P3HT nanowires would also either improve or maintain the molecular order of P3HT in blends with CdS upon thermal decomposition.9,21–24 The distinctive nanowire P3HT morphology can be seen as bright streaks in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height map of the nwP3HT:CdS blend film before thermal annealing (Fig. 5). Fig. 4b compares the P3HT Raman peaks of the nwP3HT:CdS films formed at different temperatures, which show the same disordering effect as that observed without the nanowires. In this case the disruption also increases with temperature but reaches a maximum at 160 °C, showing no further increase up to 240 °C. This suggests that the nanowires have increased susceptibility to the molecular disorder induced by the CdS nanoparticle formation process.

Molecular order is known to be a critical parameter for charge carrier mobility and other optoelectronic properties. There is some evidence that disordered polymer is active in photocurrent generation but the poor hole mobility is associated with high levels of bimolecular recombination, so disordered P3HT has typically been identified as having a detrimental effect on solar cell performance.9,11,21,24–30 We therefore suggest that low temperature thermal decomposition is preferable for producing an optimised morphology.
The precise nature of the mechanism by which the thermal decomposition of the cadmium xanthate to produce CdS nanoparticles disrupts the molecular conformation of the P3HT matrix is not clear. Some evidence has been reported which suggests that the polymer acts as a capping agent on the CdS nanoparticles.3 Such an interaction between the CdS nanoparticle and the P3HT matrix might be expected to result in disruption of the P3HT molecular order as the polymer chains conform to the CdS surface, and would also lead to increased solubility of the inorganic nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. Alternatively, the decomposition process itself may cause localised damage as the volatile products are evolved and pass through the polymer film. In either case, some amount of polymer disorder would be intrinsic to this method of forming a hybrid blend film and so gives cause to consider alternative chemical routes.
The increased disruption caused at higher temperatures suggests that the P3HT is more susceptible to damage under these conditions, as might be expected since the polymer chains will show increased mobility. The increased susceptibility of the P3HT nanowires to disruption suggests that the aggregated polymer structures provide a preferential site for decomposition of the CdS precursor molecules. The linear features in the AFM images (Fig. 5) would also be consistent with some kind of templating effect of the nanowires on CdS nanoparticle formation.
The morphological changes probed by resonant Raman spectroscopy relate directly to conformational changes on the molecular scale, whereas AFM images provide a complementary probe for the physical structure of materials at the nanometre scale. The images shown in Fig. 5 for the P3HT:CdS and nwP3HT:CdS precursor films before and after annealing at different temperatures show clear morphological differences. After annealing at 140 °C, both films show similar ‘granular’ surface morphologies with mean grain diameters of 150 ± 60 nm and 160 ± 60 nm for P3HT:CdS and nwP3HT:CdS respectively. In the opposite extreme case, after annealing at 240 °C the morphology is ‘plateau’-like, comprising large flat regions (400 ± 300 nm across) with deep localised ‘cracks’ and holes (40 ± 20 nm deep) between them. The depth of these ‘cracks’ is likely to be underestimated by this measurement due to the dimensions of the AFM tip, so they could extend throughout the thickness of the film. Both the P3HT:CdS and nwP3HT:CdS films annealed at 240 °C show similar morphological features, though the density of ‘cracks’ appears higher for nwP3HT:CdS and they tend to be long and more linear. For the intermediate case of films annealed at 200 °C, the nwP3HT:CdS film clearly displays the ‘plateau’ morphology and looks very similar to the nwP3HT:CdS film annealed at 240 °C. By contrast, the P3HT:CdS film appears to show a transitional state between the ‘granular’ and ‘plateau’ morphologies.
Photovoltaic device performance
Photovoltaic devices were prepared using the P3HT:CdS and nwP3HT:CdS blend films as active layers in order to relate the thin film morphology with the solar cell performance. Fig. 6 shows the measured power conversion efficiencies (PCE) for blend films formed at different temperatures. The device efficiencies measured here are comparable with, but a little lower than, other reports based on this same film formation approach (up to 2.1%).3,7 The overall PCEs for the P3HT:CdS and nwP3HT:CdS devices are similar (1.2%) in the lowest temperature case (140 °C), and in both cases show a sharp drop (to around 0.7%) as the temperature increases; however this drop occurs at a much lower temperature for the nwP3HT:CdS (140–160 °C) than for the P3HT:CdS (220–240 °C).
 Fig. 6  Solar cell power conversion efficiency plotted against annealing temperature for the (a) P3HT:CdS and (b) nwP3HT:CdS devices. Arrows mark sharp drops in performance with increasing temperature. 
Comparing these PCEs with the morphological analyses above, there is a good correlation between the sharp drop in device efficiency and the formation of the ‘plateau’ microstructure, which is suspected to result in shunt connections through the ‘cracks’ across the active layer. The highest efficiencies correspond with the ‘granular’ morphology observed for film formation at 140 °C, and the poor performance corresponds with the ‘plateau’ morphology seen for the 240 °C case. It was noted above that the formation of the ‘plateau’ microstructure occurs at lower temperatures (140–200 °C) for the nwP3HT:CdS blend, and this correlates well with the sharp drop in efficiency which is measured within the same range (140–160 °C). Aside from this drop in performance which we relate to the microstructure of the film, we observe minimal variation in device efficiency as a function of the annealing temperature. This suggests that the different degrees of molecular disorder in the polymer measured over this temperature range do not affect the overall solar cell efficiency. We do note, however, that all of the samples show a strong component of disordered polymer and so it is quite probable that the device efficiency could be improved if the molecular disruption could be fully overcome.
Conclusions
The results presented here reveal the morphological evolution of a P3HT:CdS blend film formed by the thermal decomposition of a CdS precursor. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the chemical decomposition is complete within two minutes of applying heat (160 °C) to the sample, and that this process causes disruption to the molecular order of the P3HT polymer matrix, attributed to interactions between the CdS nanoparticles and the polymer. It is also found that higher temperature processing (up to 240 °C) leads to an increased magnitude of morphological disruption to the P3HT. The formation of P3HT nanowires as a means of mitigating against this disruption was found to be counter-productive, instead resulting in increased susceptibility to disruption at lower temperatures (140–160 °C). AFM images reveal two distinct film microstructures described as ‘granular’ and ‘plateau’. The ‘plateau’ structure is identified as a compromised morphology comprising an intimate blend of CdS nanoparticles within a highly disordered P3HT matrix, with a high density of ‘cracks’. The optimum device performance is achieved by minimising the thermal decomposition temperature to produce the ‘granular’ microstructure. This also minimises the disruption of the polymer molecular order, though some level of disorder is intrinsic to hybrid blend films formed in this way, which we identify as the key challenge to be overcome for this route to hybrid film formation to attain state of the art efficiencies.24 We suggest that alternative chemical routes should be explored in order to achieve this.

 	Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of thin films of P3HT and CdS, and the P3HT:CdS precursor blend films before and after thermal decomposition.	 

 	Fig. 2  Resonant Raman spectra of the P3HT:CdS precursor blend films before, during (at 2 and 30 minutes) and after (bottom to top) thermal annealing at 160 °C, followed by quenching to 20 °C; (a) raw spectra separated by vertical offset, (b) main CdS Raman peaks after background correction separated by vertical offsets, and (c) main P3HT Raman peaks normalised after background correction.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Peak intensity of the main CdS Raman peak at 303 cm−1 as a function of annealing time for the neat CdS precursor and the P3HT:CdS precursor blend films, normalised to the final intensity after quenching to room temperature. (b) FWHM of the main P3HT Raman peak around 1450 cm−1 as a function of the annealing time for the neat P3HT and P3HT:CdS precursor blend films. Arrows indicate the change in the overall degree of P3HT molecular order.	 

 	Fig. 4  The main P3HT resonant Raman peak measured at 20 °C after background correction and normalisation, comparing (a) P3HT:CdS blend films before and after annealing at temperatures from 140 to 240 °C, and (b) nwP3HT:CdS blend films before and after annealing at temperatures from 140 to 240 °C.	 

 	Fig. 5  AFM height images of the P3HT:CdS (left) and nwP3HT:CdS (right) blend films, before and after thermal annealing at 140, 200 and 240 °C (top to bottom).	 

 	Fig. 6  Solar cell power conversion efficiency plotted against annealing temperature for the (a) P3HT:CdS and (b) nwP3HT:CdS devices. Arrows mark sharp drops in performance with increasing temperature.
