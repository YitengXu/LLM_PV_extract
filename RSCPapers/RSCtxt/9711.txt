    , Accepted 11th April 2019First published on 11th April 2019AbstractConformal hydrolysis of MOF precursors is a promising strategy to prepare hierarchical metal hydroxide electrode materials on a large scale with low cost and high efficiency. However, a complete transformation is challenging due to the normal “outside-in” conversion process. After studying the hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74, which has regular 1D channels, we suggest that the transformation to Ni(OH)2 can occur simultaneously outside and within the precursor depending on the treatment temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a higher temperature weakens the steric effects of OH− ions and facilitates the diffusion in the regular channels, and therefore, a complete transformation from Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 is achieved. It is for the first time demonstrated that the 1D channels of MOFs are utilized for the complete conformal hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 electrode materials. Meanwhile, we also perform pioneering work illustrating that the complete conformal hydrolysis is the key to the improved supercapacitor performances of the MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 electrodes. The prepared Ni(OH)2 electrode under the optimized conditions has a specific capacity of 713.2 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is at least 28% larger than those of the Ni(OH)2 prepared at other temperatures. The detailed analyses based on CV and EIS of the obtained Ni(OH)2 electrodes indicate that the residual MOFs within electrodes due to incomplete hydrolysis significantly influence the diffusion length and diffusion efficiency of OH−, drastically lowering the supercapacitor performances.
1. Introduction
Rapid developments of electric vehicles and portable devices require energy storage technologies with a large capacity and fast charging/discharging rates.1,2 Moreover, energy storage technologies are of significance to clean energy harvesting, including solar, wind, and tide, of which the electric energy is usually stored before merging into the grids. Batteries and supercapacitors are commonly used electrochemical energy storage devices.3–6 Although batteries, especially lithium ion batteries, exhibit a large energy density, they suffer from small power density and safety issues.7 Supercapacitors, however, present large power densities, high safety, and long cycle lives, and have been extensively studied in the past few decades.8–10 The electrodes of commercialized supercapacitors are usually porous conductive carbon based materials, and the energy storage mechanism is based on the electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC), which enables fast energy delivery and extremely long cycle lives.11,12 However, the low energy densities of EDLC electrodes hinder their further applications.1 Many methods have been utilized to improve the energy storage of supercapacitor devices, and fabricating an asymmetric supercapacitor device with an EDLC material as one electrode and a pseudocapacitive/battery-type material as the other one is a promising solution.13–17 Pseudocapacitive/battery-type materials store electric energies depending on the fast redox reactions, which drastically improve energy storage compared with EDLC materials.18–20 Numerous pseudocapacitive/battery-type electrodes have been reported, including transition metal oxides/hydroxides, transition metal sulfides, transition metal phosphides and composite materials.21–26 Among them, nickel hydroxide is attractive to researchers for its easy synthesis, low cost, and environmental friendliness.27
Generally, a perfect Ni(OH)2 electrode material requires a large specific surface area for abundant active sites, an appropriate pore structure for easy ion migration, and high crystallinity for fast electron transportation.28 Ni(OH)2-based electrodes with varied morphologies have been extensively reported. For instance, Ji et al. reported a novel hydrothermal reaction to synthesize a nanoporous Ni(OH)2 thin film on the surface of ultrathin-graphite foam, resulting in a novel Ni(OH)2-based electrode with high conductivity and remarkable capacitance.29 In addition, it was also reported that Ni(OH)2 nanosheets grown on nickel foam showed a high specific electrical capacity as well as excellent long cycle life. The Ni(OH)2 nanosheets provided large electrochemically active surface areas for pseudocapacitive reactions, contributing to outstanding electrochemical performances.30
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have a 3D periodic porous structure and are constructed by bridging metal centers with organic ligands. They are widely utilized as precursors to prepare porous carbon-based or metal-based materials due to their large porosities, adjustable pore structures, and regulated morphologies. However, a commonly used method is thermolysis during which the organic ligands are completely consumed, leading to elevated costs and hampering their wide applications. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain metal hydroxides through heating treatments. Conformal hydrolysis of MOFs, meaning that the morphology remains unchanged during hydrolysis, is an attractive strategy to prepare metal hydroxides using MOF precursors. In 2013, Miles et al. reported that Co-MOF-71 can be transformed to porous Co(OH)2 in NaOH aqueous solution, and the macro-morphology of the MOF precursor can be maintained.31 In our previous work, we have also successfully prepared porous metal hydroxides using MOF precursors. For instance, porous Co(OH)2 was obtained by conformal hydrolysis of UPC-9 in KOH aqueous solution.21 Porous Ni(OH)2 materials were also prepared by conformal transformation of MCF-35 and Ni-BTC-MOFs.32,33 Moreover, these prepared materials exhibit remarkable supercapacitance performances. It is worth mentioning that conformal transformation is necessary for promising supercapacitor performances.
Until now, the reported conformal hydrolysis routes of MOFs were all “outside-in” processes, and there are usually MOF residuals within the obtained metal hydroxides. Also, the conformal transformation can only be achieved under carefully-controlled conditions. Inspired by the regular pore structure of MOFs, if we can inject the OH− ions into the pores, it is expected that the complete conformal transformation can be easily achieved. Ni-MOF-74 is therefore selected as the study case to illustrate our assumption. Ni-MOF-74, Ni2(dhtp)(H2O)2·8H2O, was firstly reported by Dietzel et al. in 2006. The structure of Ni-MOF-74 is honeycomb-like, which has 1D pores with a diameter around 11–12 Å.34 This pore size is larger than both the hydrate ions of K+ (around 6.6 Å) and OH− (around 6.0 Å), and it is expected that the ease-entrance of OH− makes the hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74 simultaneously occur outside and within the precursors, benefiting the complete conformal transformation.35,36 However, our initial experiments illustrated that the precursor did not transform to Ni(OH)2 at ambient temperature except the outside. It is highly likely due to the slow diffusion of OH− into the pores of MOF-74 at lower temperatures. Molecular dynamics simulations were therefore employed to illustrate the diffusion capability of OH− and K+ in the pores at 298 K and 363 K, and the diffusion coefficient of OH− at 363 K is over 3 times higher than that at 298 K. The hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74 was therefore performed at 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C, and boiling point, respectively, and the experiments indicated that the complete conformal hydrolysis was achieved at 75 °C. All MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 present porous hierarchical structures, although only the one prepared at 75 °C has no organic impurities. Electrochemical measurements further demonstrated that the Ni(OH)2 prepared at 75 °C exhibited superior performances. It showed a specific capacity of 713.2 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and it remained 414.8 C g−1 (58.2%) at 25 A g−1, implying its promising applications as a new generation supercapacitor electrode material. We suggest that the improved performances are correlated to the least organics present in it compared with its counterparts. Detailed analyses on the impedance spectra of all MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 materials illustrate that the organics increase the diffusion paths and diffusion resistances of OH− and cause reduced capacity. An all-solid asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using Ni(OH)2 and active carbon as the electrodes, and the device exhibited an energy density of 36.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 436.1 W kg−1.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Transformation and characterization of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2
The hydrolysis process of Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 is illustrated in Fig. 1a, and the morphological features of the produced Ni(OH)2 materials are shown in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1a, b and S2–S5†). The obtained Ni(OH)2 materials under 30 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C and boiling point are named MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD, respectively. Ni-MOF-74 is in the rod shape with a smooth surface (Fig. S2 and S3†). After hydrolyzing treatments at different temperatures, the rod shape of MOF-74 remained unchanged during the hydrolyzing treatments for all samples. However, the morphological features, especially on the outside, are quite different (Fig. S4†). MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D is partly covered with Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes, and the underneath of the Ni(OH)2 is still MOF-74 (Fig. S4a†). One possible reason is that OH− ions cannot enter the pores of Ni-MOF-74 easily, and only the outside of the Ni-MOF-74 was hydrolyzed, and the outer Ni(OH)2 shells prevent the further hydrolysis. Considering that the pore size of Ni-MOF-74 is around 11 Å, which is larger than the hydrate ions of OH−, it is possible that the water molecules adsorbed to OH− due to hydrogen bonds strengthen the steric effects.37,38 Since the hydrogen bonds, as well as the steric effects, weaken at higher temperatures, we suggested that the higher treatment temperature facilitates the entrance of OH− ions into the pores and that complete transformation would be achieved. Thus, Ni-MOF-74 was immersed into 6 M KOH aqueous solutions at 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C, and boiling point, respectively, to examine the transformation levels. As expected, higher temperatures benefit the hydrolysis process. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D is composed of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes with rough surfaces, although some fractions are covered with smooth thin tablets, which is the residual MOF-74 (Fig. S4b†). There are no covers on MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, and its porous structure can be clearly observed (Fig. 1b and S4d–f†), indicating the complete hydrolysis. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D also presents a hierarchical feature, although some slices with irregular shapes insert into the surfaces (Fig. S4c†). We suggest that these slices are also associated with MOF residuals. TEM images shown in Fig. S5† give similar results. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D presents a thin outer Ni(OH)2 shell, and the inside is still MOF-74. For MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, they are all composed of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes, which are benefited from the easy entrance of OH− ions at higher temperatures. The HRTEM, EDS mapping, STEM, and SAED of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D are shown in Fig. 1b and S5d, e.† The EDS mapping illustrates that there is no carbon element present in MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, further confirming the complete transformation of Ni-MOF-74 to hierarchical Ni(OH)2. The SAED image shows typical polycrystalline rings, indicating the homogeneous distribution of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes. The lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. S4e†) present a distance of 0.23 nm, which coincides with the plane distance of the (101) planes of Ni(OH)2.

The transformation of Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 was examined using the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 2a and S6.† When treated at 30 °C, the material has strong Ni-MOF-74 PXRD peaks and weak Ni(OH)2 peaks, indicating that only small portions of the precursor were converted. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD show strong Ni(OH)2 features, indicating that most fraction of the precursors was transformed to Ni(OH)2 at elevated temperatures. Interestingly, the transformation level is temperature dependent. As is shown, the peaks related to residual MOFs are still observed in the XRD patterns of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D and absent for MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, of which the pattern presents pure Ni(OH)2 peaks. However, MOF peaks appear again around the 2 − θ degree of 31° in the patterns of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD. The FT-IR results shown in Fig. 2b further confirm the hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74 at different temperatures. From 30 to 75 °C, the growing O–H stretch and Ni–O stretch peaks at 3643 and 510 cm−1 and the weakening MOF peaks from 1300 to 1700 cm−1 indicate the transformation of Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2. The MOF residuals within MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 at higher temperatures were also confirmed in the FT-IR spectra. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD presents an increasing band from 1300 to 1700 cm−1 compared with MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, indicating that an over-high temperature does not benefit the hydrolysis. XPS measurements were further performed to study the compositional changes in the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 2c and S7,† the survey spectra of the obtained materials confirm the presence of Ni, O, and C elements. The Ni 2p band is observed in all spectra of the samples and is reasonably decomposed into four peaks. The binding energy peak at 873.6 eV and its satellite peak at 880.0 eV are attributed to Ni 2p1/2, and the binding energy peak at 855.9 eV and its satellite peak are attributed to the Ni 2p3/2 level. However, the intensities of C 1s peaks for different samples clearly vary. The strong C 1s peak in MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D is associated with the residual precursor, demonstrating the incomplete hydrolysis. The C 1s peak of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D is nearly negligible, suggesting the complete transformation. Nevertheless, the C 1s peak of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD becomes evident again. The TGA result of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D shown in Fig. 2d illustrates the weight loss of 20.7%. Although this value is slightly larger than the theoretical value of 19.4% due to dehydration, we believe that the gradual removal of the adsorbed water below 150 °C contributes to the slightly larger weight loss.

The porous structures of all MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 materials were studied using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 2e and f, and the BET surfaces and pore size distributions were calculated based on them. Ni-MOF-74 and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D show similar BET surfaces of 6.643 m2 g−1 and 0.081 m2 g−1, implying that MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D is mostly composed of Ni-MOF-74. The largest BET surface area is 166.529 m2 g−1 for MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, which is consistent with the porous structure shown in the SEM and TEM images. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD show significantly reduced surface areas of 135.158, 106.620, and 123.594 m2 g−1, respectively, possibly related to the MOF residuals within them. The pore size distributions of Ni(OH)2 materials indicate their hierarchical structures, of which the pore sizes are from 1 to 100 nm, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D presents the largest pore volume compared with its counterparts.
We suggest that the easy entrance of OH− ions into the pores of MOF-74 at higher temperatures is the main reason for the complete hydrolysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were therefore employed to calculate the diffusion coefficient of OH− and K+ to confirm the assumption. The animations included in the ESI (Video S1 and S2†) indicate that the entrance of KOH aqueous solution into the pores of Ni-MOF-74 is more rapid at 363 K compared with 298 K. The MSD curves of K+ and OH− shown in Fig. 3 and the calculated diffusion coefficients based on the MSD curves listed in Table 1 demonstrate the temperature effects on their diffusive capabilities. It is obvious that K+ preferentially enters the pores compared with OH− at both the lower and higher temperatures. However, the changes of their diffusion coefficient within the temperature are not the same. The diffusion coefficient of OH− at 373 K (6.117 × 10−6 cm2 ns−1) is over 3 times higher than that at 298 K (2.017 × 10−6 cm2 ns−1), indicating that the elevated temperature facilitates the entrance of OH− ions into the pores. For K+, its diffusion coefficient only varies from 8.745 × 10−6 cm2 ns−1 (298 K) to 10.617 × 10−6 cm2 ns−1 (363 K).

Due to the fact that the diffusion of ions within the nanopores is mainly affected by the steric effects associated with the adsorbed water molecules around ions, the binding energies between K+ or OH− and water molecules at the lower and higher temperatures were calculated (listed in Table 1). The results illustrate that both K+ and OH− show reduced binding energies to water molecules at the elevated temperature. Therefore, based on the simulation results, it is concluded that the following reasons contribute to the faster diffusion of OH− at higher temperature. The preferred entrance of K+ within the pores hinders the entrance of OH− ions due to the steric effects, which become dominant at lower temperature due to the stronger bindings of OH− (K+) to water molecules. At higher temperature, the steric effects are drastically weakened due to the smaller binding energies, and the diffusion of OH− in Ni-MOF-74 becomes easier. Thus, the hydrolysis occurs both within and outside the precursors, favoring both the rapid hydrolysis process and guaranteeing the complete conformal transformation, which is supported by the aforementioned experimental results.
2.2 Electrochemical investigation of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2
Although all MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 materials transformed above 60 °C exhibit hierarchical structures, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD still have residual MOF-74 within them. It is therefore expected that MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D exhibits the best electrochemical performances since it presents the pure Ni(OH)2 phase. Electrochemical measurements were therefore carried out to study and compare the electrochemical performances of all MOF-derived Ni(OH)2, and the results are presented in Fig. 4, S8 and S9.†

(b) Capacity of the as-prepared MOF-74-Ni(OH)2 as a function of current densities. (c) Nyquist plots of the as-prepared MOF-74-Ni(OH)2 and equivalent circuit (inset). (d) Cycling performances of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D at 5 A g−1. 
The Ni(OH)2 electrode reactions are generally acknowledged as follows:39Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−
The oxide of Ni2+ to Ni3+ for all Ni(OH)2 electrodes is associated with the peak presented in the CV curves (shown in Fig. 4a and S6†) at 0.47 eV with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Meanwhile, all electrode materials show symmetric redox peaks, implying a good columbic efficiency. GCD tests were carried out on the MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 materials to examine their charge storage capability. As shown in Fig. S7,† the flat steps at the charging and discharging sides are associated with the redox reactions. The calculated specific capacities at different charge/discharge currents for all Ni(OH)2 electrodes are presented in Fig. 4b. It is worth mentioning that the unit of specific capacity was used rather than specific capacitance due to the battery-type behavior of Ni(OH)2. As expected, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D presents a surpassed charge storage capability compared with its counterparts. The specific capacity reaches 713.2 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintains 58.2% (414.8 C g−1) of the original capacity at a current density of 25 A g−1. For further investigating the charge storage behavior of our MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 materials, the oxide peak currents in CV vs. scan rates were fitted using the equation:40i = k1v1/2 + k2vherein, i and v stand for the peak current density and scan rate, respectively. Generally, k1v1/2 and k2v are associated with the diffusion contribution (faradaic current) and the EDLC contribution of the peak current density, respectively. The fitted results are presented in Fig. S10† and Table 2, and the small reduced chi-square values indicate the reliable fitting results. The faradic current dominates the contributions to the total currents for all samples (Fig. S11†), indicating the battery-type behaviors of our Ni(OH)2 electrodes. From the fitted results, it is concluded that the main reason contributing to the improved charge storage of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D is due to the elevated diffusion contribution rather than EDLC. More precise descriptions of diffusion and EDLC contributions are the following equations:41idiff = k1v1/2 = nFAdiffC0(πD0σ)1/2χ(σt) ∝ AdiffD1/20, σ = nFv/RTiEDLC = k2v = AEDLCCdv ∝ AEDLCwhere n and F are the electron number during the reaction, which is equal to 1 in this case, and the faradaic constant, respectively. Adiff and C0 are the electrochemical active surface area and reactant concentration, respectively. D0 is the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and χ is a dimensionless number. AEDLC and Cd are the area for the double layer capacitance and the specific capacitance of the double layer with the unit of F cm−2, respectively. In our scenario, all CV measurements were conducted under the same conditions. Therefore, idiff and iEDLC are expected to be proportional to AdiffD1/20 and AEDLC.

Considering that MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D presents the largest BET surface area and pore volume calculated from the N2 desorption/adsorption isotherms, it is reasonable to correlate its largest idiff with its largest BET surface area (Fig. S12†). However, the largest BET surface of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D does not contribute to the largest iEDLC. Actually, the EDLC contributions of all samples are similar within uncertainties, implying the different natures of Adiff and AEDLC.
EIS measurements were employed to investigate the interfacial process between the interfaces of electrodes and electrolytes as well as charge/ion transportation behaviors within the MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 electrode materials. The frequency range is from 0.01 Hz to 106 Hz with a bias of 5 mV. The Nyquist plots for all Ni(OH)2 electrodes are presented in Fig. 4c, and it is obvious that each of them is composed of a high-frequency depressed semi-circle and a low-frequency straight line, although the radius of the semi-circles and Warburg diffusion regions, which is the transition zone from the semi-circle to the straight line, are different within samples. The equivalent circuit to fit the EIS spectra is presented as the insert in Fig. 4c. Rs (shown as R1 in Fig. 4c) represents the equivalent electrolyte resistance. Rct (shown as R2 in Fig. 4c) is the faradaic resistance, which is associated with the diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region, illustrating the interfacial charge-transfer resistance at the interfaces between the electrode and electrolyte as well as the inherent charge-transfer resistance of the porous Ni(OH)2 electrode.42,43 Since all Nyquist plots have depressed semi-circle regions, which are associated with the inhomogeneous surface and current leakage, CPE was therefore used in the equivalent circuit rather than the capacitor. Wo is the Warburg element, which reveals the diffusion capability of OH− within the electrodes. Herein, we have the Warburg element parallel to the CPE due to the different charge/discharge areas for the faradaic reaction and double layer capacitance. The fitted results are listed in Table 3.

As listed, all electrodes have similar Rs values because of the same electrolytes. The CPE-T values, which represent the EDLCs, are also close for different samples, consistent with the fitted results of i vs. v. Although all electrodes have similar CPE-T values, their CPE-P values are different, and the CPE-P of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D (0.83) is close to 1, implying the homogeneous double layer capacitance surface and little current leakage. Furthermore, the significantly reduced Rct and W–R of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D indicate its smallest faradaic resistance and the most rapid diffusion of OH− compared with other Ni(OH)2 electrodes. MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D also presents the lowest W–T values. It is reported that W–T equals to L2/D, where L and D are the diffusion length and diffusion coefficient, respectively,44 and thus, the lowest W–T of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D electrode further demonstrates a short diffusion path and a large diffusion coefficient. W–P is a dimensionless value implying the slope of the straight line in the low-frequency region, and the value of 0.5 indicates the vertical line. It is generally acknowledged that a more slopped straight line is associated with higher coulombic efficiency.21 Since MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D has a W–P value of 0.46, which is more close to 0.5 compared with other samples, its improved coulombic efficiency is expected.
The fitted results based on the EIS measurements further illustrate the superior electrochemical performances of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, and we suggest that the least organic impurity present in it is the main reason. Considering that MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD present evident organic impurities, it is reasonable to imagine that the organic impurities will cover the Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes, leading to an elevated faradaic resistance and difficulties in the diffusion of OH− ions to active sites. Therefore, we can conclude that an optimized temperature is necessary for hydrolysis treatments of Ni-MOF-74 in alkaline aqueous solution to obtain promising Ni(OH)2 supercapacitor electrodes, and in this case, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D presents superior performances. Moreover, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D also exhibits higher specific capacity than many other reported Ni-based electrodes, for instance Ni-based MOFs (583.1 C g−1 at 1 A g−1),45 MOF derived NiCo2O4/β-NixCo1−x(OH)2/α-NixCo1−x(OH)2 (658.4 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 628.8 C g−1 at 1 A g−1),25 and Ni(OH)2 nano-sheets (604.0 C g−1 at 1.5 A g−1).46 The cyclic performances of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D are also investigated as shown in Fig. 4d. As expected, the coulombic efficiency maintains 100% during 4500 cycles. The capacitance drops to around 65% at the initial 400 cycles, and remained almost unchanged subsequently. The initial drop might be due to the volume effects of Ni(OH)2 during charging/discharging, and a small fraction of the materials fell off from the current collector became inactive. However, benefitting from the stable hierarchical structure from the conformal transformation of MOF-74, most electrode materials can remain active during cycling, contributing to a considerably long cycle life.
2.3 Electrochemical performance of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device
In order to illustrate the potential applications of MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC, a hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated with activated carbon (AC) as the cathode and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC as the anode. The mass ratio of positive and negative electrodes was optimized (as shown in Fig. S13†), and the ratio of 1:2.83 showed the best electrochemical performance. Fig. S14† shows the CV curves of the optimized MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device at different voltage windows and different scan rates. The shapes of the CV curves of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC device didn't show a distinct change as the scan rates increased, indicating the extremely outstanding rate capability. GCD curves of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC device at a series of current densities and the capacitance of the supercapacitor as a function of current density are described in Fig. 5a and b. The calculated capacitances are 98.0, 85.2, 76.5, 72.2, 69.6 and 68.3 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 A g−1, respectively, which gradually decrease with the increasing charge–discharge current.

(b) Specific capacitance of the as-prepared MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC device as a function of current densities. (c) Ragone plot of the as-prepared MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC device compared with the previously reported results. (d) Cycling performances of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC device at 1 A g−1 and the image of an electric fan powered by the as-prepared cell (insert). 
There are two main parameters, energy density (E) and power density (P), which are commonly utilized to reveal the electrochemical performances of a full cell. E and P can be described using the following equations:    where I is the charge/discharge current, m is the mass of the electrode materials contained in positive and negative electrodes, V is the device operation potential, and Δt is the time taken by the process of discharging. The MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits an extremely high energy density of 36.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 436.1 W kg−1. In order to illustrate the good specific energy and power densities of our device more clearly, a Ragone plot (Fig. 5c) presenting energy density versus power density for a series of asymmetric supercapacitors was constructed. It can be obviously observed that our hybrid supercapacitor devices have better performance when compared with Y-doped Ni(OH)2//AC (22.0 W h kg−1 at 754.56 W kg−1),47 nano-Ni(OH)2/graphite electrode//AC (19.0 W h kg−1 at 3000.0 W kg−1),48 Ni–Mn LDH/MnO2//AC (15.0 W h kg−1 at 1500.0 W kg−1),49 MOF-derived NixCo1−x(OH)2//AC (21.9 W h kg−1 at 348.9 W kg−1),50 Ni/Ni(OH)2//AC (23.45 W h kg−1 at 530.0 W kg−1),51 and LDH/NG-5//AC (31.2 W h kg−1 at 354 W kg−1)52 and the cycling performances of such devices were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5d, the capacitance retained 75.3% after 7000 cycles, which is quite excellent based on the current reports. Also, it can be found that an electric fan can be powered by this cell (Video S3† and Fig. 5d insert), which is firstly tested and reported as we know. The electric fan, mentioned above, rotated over 1 minute when the mass of the positive electrode was just 2.5 mg (with the mass of the negative electrode being 7.1 mg), representing the great promising application prospect of the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device.
3. Experimental section
3.1 Synthesis of Ni-MOF-74 crystals
The synthesis process is based on a previous report with slight adjustment.53 All raw materials were commercial reagents from Aladdin Reagent Company without any further purification. Initially, nickel acetate tetrahydrate (1.120 g, 4.5 mmol) was dissolved in 45 mL deionized water (DIW), and 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHTA, 0.891 g, 4.5 mmol) was dissolved in 45 mL THF. The THF solution prepared above was then added into the DIW solution. Subsequently, the mixed solution was stirred for 10 min, and then sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless container. Maintained at 110 °C for 24 h, the solution was air cooled to room temperature, and the yellow precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed using THF and DIW. After extracting using MeOH at 120 °C for 48 h, Ni-MOF-74 crystals were kept at 60 °C to completely remove the residual MeOH.
3.2 Synthesis of hierarchical porous Ni(OH)2
0.10 g Ni-MOF-74 crystals were immersed in a 50 mL aqueous solution of 6 M KOH for 6 hours with stirring at different temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C, and boiling point). After being air cooled, the hierarchical porous Ni(OH)2 crystals were collected by centrifugation, followed by several times of rinse with DIW and EtOH and dried at 60 °C for 10 hours. Herein, Ni-MOF-74 derived porous Ni(OH)2 with different alkaline hydrolysis temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C, and boiling point) are denoted as MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-30D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-60D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D, MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-90D, and MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-BD, respectively.
3.3 Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the prepared samples were acquired using a PANalytical X'pert PRO (Holland) diffractometer. To investigate the morphology and structures of the prepared samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs were collected by using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 (America) transmission electron microscope and a ZEISS Gemini SEM 500 (Germany) scanning electron microscope, respectively. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was utilized to examine the specific surface area of the prepared samples, and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were employed by using a surface area analyzer ASAP-2020 H88. FT-IR spectra were recorded by using a PerkinElmer Frontier FT-IR Spectrometer ranging from 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1. XPS patterns were collected by using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi (America) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were implemented by using a Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) TGA instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the range of 40 °C to 900 °C under a N2 atmosphere.
3.4 Electrochemical characterization
In order to examine the electrochemical performances of hierarchical porous Ni(OH)2 materials, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) tests (a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 106 Hz and perturbation potential of 5 mV were applied) were carried out by employing the CHI 760E electrochemical workstation under ambient conditions. 6 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte in a three-electrode system, in which a platinum net (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg2Cl2) was used as the reference electrode.
As for the working electrode, a homogenous slurry containing hierarchical Ni(OH)2, high purity carbon black and polytetra-fluoroethylene (the weight ratio used is 8:1:1, dissolved in EtOH) was prepared and heated at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h. Then, approximately 2.5 mg of the mixture mentioned above was painted on one piece of nickel foam (1 cm × 2 cm), and another piece of nickel foam was pressed face to the painted foam under the pressure of 1.0 MPa. The accurate mass loading was determined by the mass increment after active materials were loaded.
For the hybrid supercapacitor, Ni(OH)2 and active carbon (AC) were utilized as the electrode materials. Ni(OH)2 was used as the positive electrode, while the AC electrode was the negative electrode. Similar to the preparation of the Ni(OH)2 electrode, the AC electrode was prepared by mixing AC and polytetra-fluoroethylene in EtOH with a weight ratio of 9:1, followed by dispersion between two pieces of nickel foam with the optimized mass. Then, the two pieces of nickel foams were pressed face to face under 1.0 MPa, after which the negative electrode was fabricated. All electrochemical performances (CV and GCD) of the hybrid supercapacitor were measured in 6 M KOH aqueous solution by using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation.
As for the all-solid hybrid supercapacitor, KOH/PVA gel was used as the solid electrode, which was prepared by mixing PVA (2.0 g) with DIW (80 ml). The mixture mentioned was heated at 80 °C and stirred until it became clear, after which solid KOH (2.0 g) was added into the solution. Then, after moderate stirring and natural volatilization, the solid electrolyte could be acquired. To fabricate the hybrid supercapacitor device, which was made as the button cell device, nickel foams with Ni(OH)2 and AC were, respectively, used as the positive electrode and negative electrode, KOH/PVA gel obtained as above was used as the electrode, and 2025-type coin cells were assembled to test their practicability by powering an electric fan.
3.5 Computational simulation
To study the diffusion of KOH in Ni-MOF-74, the model system was constructed as shown in Fig. S1.† The length of the MOF we built is 41 Å (measured in the experiment). Two temperatures of 298 K and 363 K were studied to unravel the influence of temperature on the diffusion performance. A 1 mol L−1 KOH reservoir was placed on the right side as the feed chamber. A pure water reservoir on the other side was used as the permeate chamber. The built box has dimensions of 51.57 Å × 44.66 Å × 240 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were used in all three directions. To prevent the ion diffusion between the feed and permeate side, two rigid graphene sheets were placed at the right and left sides of the system. During simulation, the graphene sheets and MOF remained frozen.
Then, molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to further investigate the diffusion behaviors of KOH in Ni-MOF-74 crystals. All the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out with the LAMMPS package. During the simulation, the non-polarizable all-atom OPLS-AA force field was used for potassium hydroxide and graphene sheets.54 The Lennard-Jones parameters for Ni-MOF-74 were obtained from A. K. Rappes’ work.55 The partial atomic charges of MOF-74 were obtained by quantum calculation using the DMol3 module of Materials Studio software. The Perdue–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function with an atomic cutoff radius of 3.5 Å was employed, and the exchange–correlation potential was described by the general gradient approximation (GGA). The TIP3P water model was used for water molecules.56 Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules were used to obtain the missing heteronuclear parameters. The cutoff distance for all the short-range vdW interactions was set as 12 Å. The long-range electrostatic interactions were computed by using the particle–particle particle–mesh (PPPM) algorithm. All of the data reported in this work were averaged over a set of 5 simulations from various initial velocity distributions. For each system, the simulation was conducted in a canonical ensemble (NVT) at 298 K or 363 K controlled by the Nose–Hoover thermostat method. The time step was set as 1 fs, and the data were collected every 1 ps. The total simulation time of each model was 5 ns.
4. Conclusions
The hydrolysis of MOF precursors is a promising and efficient strategy for the large-scale preparation of transition metal hydroxides with low costs. However, there are usually MOF residuals within the products due to the incomplete transformation, which is associated with the “outside-in” reaction process. Herein, we provide an “outside & in” strategy for complete hydrolysis, illustrated by hydrolyzing the Ni-MOF-74 precursor, which has regular 1D channels, in KOH aqueous solution at an appropriate temperature. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that K+ ions preferentially enter the pores and hinder the entrance of OH− due to the steric effects. However, the steric effect is mainly associated with the adsorbed water molecules, and the reduced adsorb energy at higher temperatures benefits the fast diffusion of OH− within Ni-MOF-74 and complete transformation. By fitting the peak current vs. scanning voltage rate and electrochemical impedance spectra of the obtained Ni(OH)2 electrodes, it is concluded that the complete transformation is the key to the improved battery-type supercapacitance behavior, due to that the organics within Ni(OH)2 electrodes hinder the diffusion of OH− and increase the diffusion lengths.
Moreover, the MOF-74-Ni(OH)2-75D//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device showed promising potential for electrochemical energy storage performance with a high energy density of 36.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 436.1 W kg−1, as well as an outstanding capacitance of 98.0 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Additionally, the firstly-reported interesting experiment with an electric fan perfectly represented the great application prospect of this device.
Our results provide an effective strategy for selecting appropriate MOF precursors and reaction conditions for hydrolysis treatments, and are of significance to the supercapacitor electrode industry.
