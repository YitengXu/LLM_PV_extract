    , Accepted 23rd July 2018First published on 2nd August 2018AbstractHydrogen (H) plays critical roles in the electrical properties of semiconductor materials and devices. In this work, we report multiple states and roles of H in SnS by H plasma treatment and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as-deposited SnS films include impurity H at 2.3 × 1019 cm−3, four orders of magnitude larger than the hole density. The DFT calculations reveal that H exists in multiple states at the equilibrium mainly at the interstitial and the Sn-substitutional sites, which have formation enthalpies lower than those for the intrinsic defects. These H states work as donors and acceptors, respectively, and strongly pin the Fermi level in the p-type region. The native p-type conduction in the actual SnS semiconductors is caused mainly by the H-on-Sn (HSn) acceptors, rather than the previously reported Sn vacancies (VSn) for pure SnS. It is also confirmed that even stronger H doping with larger H chemical potentials cannot convert SnS to an n-type conductor because it reduces SnS to Sn metal.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H) plays critical roles in the properties of semiconductor materials and devices, because H is easily incorporated into films unintentionally from the vacuum deposition system (e.g., H2O and H2) or intentionally from the source gases.1 Such incorporated H plays in some cases critical roles in the electrical properties of semiconductors. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is a typical example, where H passivates Si-dangling bonds, leading to the desirable semiconductor properties for applications such as thin-film solar cells and transistors.2–4 The roles of H in oxide semiconductors have also been intensively investigated. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have revealed that native non-stoichiometry defects such as oxygen vacancies (VO) in crystalline oxide semiconductors such as ZnO and SnO2 cannot be the source of residual electron carriers, but the unintentionally incorporated H-related impurities act as shallow donors that can be responsible for natural n-type doping in these oxides,5–7 which is confirmed also by the experimental observations that intentional H incorporation increases the electron concentration in ZnO and SnO2.8–11 The roles of H in amorphous oxide semiconductors represented by amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO) have also been extensively studied.12 For example, it has been found that a-IGZO includes high-density impurity H in the form of hydroxyl groups –OH13 and H−,14 and some of the H passivates the defects.15 However, there has been few reports on the roles of H in chalcogenide semiconductors such as SnS.
Tin monosulfide (SnS) is a native p-type semiconductor, which is expected for an earth-abundant nontoxic photovoltaic absorber material due to its suitable bandgap of ∼1.08 eV, moderate carrier concentration (1015–1018 cm−3), and high optical absorption coefficients.16–19 SnS absorber layers are generally fabricated by vacuum technologies, such as pulsed laser deposition (PLD), radio frequency sputtering, and atomic layer deposition (ALD),16–19 where H2S gas is often employed during the deposition and/or post-annealing processes to enhance electrical conductivity and suppress the significant formation of S vacancies (VS), which create deep states in the bandgap.20–23 The introduced H2S gas as well as the presence of H2O/H2 in the chamber should introduce H into the SnS films. However, the H states and their roles in electrical and photovoltaic properties have not been studied yet. On the other hand, the highest energy conversion efficiency (η) of SnS-based solar cells reported to date is limited to 4.4%,19 which is much lower than the theoretically predicted value of 24%.24 The low η values would be caused by unfavorable band offsets and/or trap states near the heterojunction interfaces.25 A possible approach to solve this issue is to construct solar cells with an n-SnS/p-SnS homojunction structure. We have achieved n-type SnS by the geometrical doping route using isovalent Pb ions as dopants, which, however, is toxic and inadequate for solar cells.22,23 Thus, we expect that H doping forms shallow donors and realize n-type conductivity in SnS, like the oxide cases such as ZnO and SnO2.
In this work, we first examined undoped (i.e., unintentionally H doped in the as-deposited state) and intentionally H-doped SnS films. It is found that the undoped SnS films contained high-density impurity H at ∼1019 cm−3, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the hole density. Furthermore, H plasma treatment did not convert SnS to an n-type conductor, but reduced SnS to Sn metal. DFT calculations indicate that the H exists at the interstitial sites and the Sn-site substitution sites, which have rather low formation enthalpies. That is, the intrinsic p-type conduction in H-containing SnS films is attributed to the H-on-Sn (HSn) shallow acceptors, rather than the already-proposed Sn vacancies (VSn). Moreover, it is consistently explained that SnS is reduced to Sn metal before H generates electron carriers and converts SnS to an n-type semiconductor.
2. Experimental details
SnS films of ∼150 nm in thickness were grown on SiO2 glass substrates by PLD using a KrF excimer laser (248 nm wavelength, 3 J cm−2 laser energy density, and 10 Hz repetition rate) with SnS polycrystalline targets in a H2S gas flow to control the S stoichiometry. The base pressure of the growth chamber was 1 × 10−5 Pa. The substrate temperature and pressure of an Ar/H2S mixing gas (80/20%) were 400 °C and 10 Pa, respectively, which are the optimum fabrication parameters for our SnS films.16 Then, the obtained SnS film was exposed to H plasma at room temperature for 10, 50 and 200 s. The base pressure of the H plasma chamber is 1 × 10−5 Pa. The working pressure of H2 gas and the working power of the H plasma treatment were 8 Pa and 50 W, respectively.
The crystalline phases and structures of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα) using a synchronous 2θ/θ scan. The electrical properties of the SnS films were estimated by Hall effect measurements using the van der Pauw configuration with an AC magnetic modulation. The H densities (nH) in the SnS films were estimated by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The optical properties of the films were obtained by measuring the transmittance (Tr) and reflectance (R) spectra, where optical absorption coefficients (α) were estimated by α = ln[(1 − R)/Tr]/d (d is the film thickness).
Defect calculations were performed in the framework of DFT using the projector-augmented plane-wave (PAW) method and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)26 functional as implemented in the VASP code.27 The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 350.0 eV. A 400-atom supercell (5 × 5 × 2 unit cells, see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) was used to model the intrinsic point defects and H-related impurities. The lattice parameters were fixed at the lattice parameters obtained for an ideal crystal with the GGA-PBE functional, and the internal atom positions were relaxed, where the total force on each ion was converged to <0.01 eV Å−1. For each defect, in particular for interstitial defects, a sufficient number of possible initial models were examined, and the lowest total energy model for each defect was employed as the most probable defect structure. All possible charge states were calculated for all the defect models. The methods for the determination of the formation enthalpy (ΔHf) and the posterior corrections were the same as those described in our previous work on SnS.23 Here, the chemical potential of H was taken from H2S and H2 molecules for the S-rich and S-poor conditions, respectively. The concentrations of intrinsic defects and H-related impurities and the equilibrium Fermi level (EF,e) were estimated with the methodology described in our previous work.23
3. Results and discussion
SnS films were prepared by PLD with an H2S gas flow, followed by H plasma treatment at room temperature for some films. Hall measurements confirmed that both the as-deposited and H plasma-treated SnS thin films exhibited p-type conduction; that is, the H plasma treatment did not convert the SnS films to n-type conductors. Fig. 1(a and b) show the measured hole densities (Nh) and mobilities (μh) as a function of the plasma treatment time (tplas). The as-deposited film exhibited an Nh of 3.5 × 1015 cm−3 and a μh of 5.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. The 10 s H plasma treatment dramatically decreased Nh to 1.0 × 1015 cm−3 along with the improvement of μh to 8.0 V−1 s−1. Then, the 50 s plasma treatment further decreased the Nh to 7.0 × 1014 cm−3, with a slightly decreased μh of 7.4 V−1 s−1. Fig. 1(c) shows the nH in the SnS films, which was determined from the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) spectra (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†), as a function of tplas. Interestingly, even the as-deposited (i.e., intentionally undoped) SnS film exhibited a high nH = 2.3 × 1019 cm−3 of H2 desorption, which is approximately four orders of magnitude larger than the above Nh. The 10 s H plasma treatment significantly increased the nH to 9.1 × 1019 cm−3. However, for the tplas ≥ 50 s films, the nH recovered almost to the initial value of the as-deposited film. XRD measurements indicate that a trace of the metallic Sn phase is segregated in the tplas ≥ 50 s films (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†), which simultaneously generated extra-optical absorption in the subgap region (<1.3 eV as seen in Fig. S4 of the ESI†). These results indicate that the short-time H plasma treatment dopes H into the SnS films to suppress the p-type conduction, but the longer-time H plasma treatment does not convert the SnS films to n-type conductors but reduces SnS to Sn metal.

Fig. 2(a and b) show temperature dependences of Nh and μh, respectively, for the as-deposited and the 10 s plasma-treated SnS films. Nh exhibited a thermally activated behavior for both films (Fig. 2(a)). The activation energies (Ea) were estimated to be 0.20 and 0.23 eV for the as-deposited and the 10 s plasma-treated SnS films, respectively. In a p-type semiconductor, Ea is the energy difference between the Fermi level (EF) and the valence band maximum (VBM). The increased Ea for the 10 s plasma-treated SnS film indicates that H incorporation slightly pushed up the EF, which is consistent with the decreased Nh (see Fig. 1(a)). As seen in Fig. 2(b), for both films, μh decreased with decreasing temperature. The ln(μhT1/2)–T−1 plots are linear in the whole temperature range, suggesting that the hole transport in these films was dominated by grain boundary scattering as proposed by Seto et al.,28 where hole transport is disturbed by potential barriers formed at the grain boundaries, due to the holes trapped by donor-type defects. The grain boundary barrier potential height (Eb) of the as-deposited and the 10 s H plasma-treated SnS films were estimated to be 0.073 and 0.068 eV, respectively, from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots of Seto's model. The decreased Eb by 0.005 eV for the 10 s H plasma-treated SnS film leads to the enhancement of μh by 1.2 times, based on the expression μ0 = μHallexp(EB/kT), which partially contribute to the observed μh enhancement.

To identify the H states in SnS and reveal their roles, we have performed defect calculations for SnS in the framework of DFT. We have considered three kinds of H-related impurity states: interstitials, substitutions on Sn sites, and substitutions on S sites. Fig. 3 shows the DFT-relaxed local structures around the H-related impurities in SnS. Fig. 4 shows the calculated charge transition levels of the H-related impurities along with those of the VSn and VS. For H interstitials (Hi), the positively charged H+i and the neutral H0i states form –S–H bonds, with nearly equal bond lengths (1.360 and 1.361 Å, respectively, which are close to the calculated S–H bond length of 1.35 Å for the H2S molecule), as shown in Fig. 3(a and b), respectively, while the negatively charged H−i is located between two Sn atoms, forming a Sn2+–H−–Sn2+ structure with the Sn–H bond length being 1.95 Å, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The (0/1+) transition (i.e., the donor level) for Hi is located at 0.13 eV above the conduction band minimum (CBM), the (1+/1−) one at 0.12 eV below the CBM, and the (0/1−) one (the acceptor levels) at 0.38 eV below the CBM, showing a negative U behavior29 (i.e., the electron-accepted level is lower than the electron-released level).

VSn is a shallow acceptor with the (0/1−) transition at slightly below the VBM, and the (1–/2–) one at 0.17 eV above the VBM. Fig. 3(d–f) show the most stable charge state structures for the substitutions of one, two, and three H atoms per Sn site (i.e., [nH]Sn, n = 1, 2, and 3), respectively. It is important to note that the original Sn position is not stable for all the HSn atoms, and the H atoms are off-shifted to the nearest S atom; i.e., the H atoms singly bonded with the nearest S atoms as –S–H (around 1.36 Å), behaving like the stable positively charged H+i in Fig. 3(a) with a VSn. HSn is ionized to the 1− charge state when EF is higher than 0.03 eV above the VBM and acts as a shallow acceptor. The negatively charged H−Sn can be viewed as a defect complex derived from H+i and V2−Sn. [2H]Sn remains neutral in the whole bandgap, resulting from the charge compensation between two H+i and one V2−Sn. [3H]Sn is always ionized to the 1+ charge state, behaving as a shallow donor, as its (0/1+) transition level is above the CBM.
The substitution of one H atom for one S atom (HS) is always ionized in the 1+ charge state, indicating that H is in the 1− formal charge state, which is supported by the observed Sn2+–H− bond (1.89 Å, comparable to the value of 1.95 Å for H−i), as shown in Fig. 3(g). The substitution of two H atoms for one S atom ([2H]S) forms a H2 dimer with the H–H bond length being 0.756 Å (see Fig. 3(h)), which is close to the calculated value for the H2 molecule (0.751 Å). Just like the VS, which exhibits a (0/2+) transition level deep in the bandgap (i.e., 0.48 eV below the CBM), the [2H]S shows the (0/2+) transition level deep in the bandgap (i.e., 0.39 eV below the CBM), suggesting that the H2 dimer is in the neutral formal charge state. Interestingly, the substitution of three H atoms for one S atom ([3H]S) stabilizes a linear H3 trimer between two Sn2+ ions (see Fig. 3(i)) although a linear H3 neutral molecule is not stabilized as known in the fundamental quantum chemistry. Like the HS, the [3H]S is always ionized in the 1+ charge state, suggesting that the linear H3 trimer is stabilized in the formal charge state of 1−. Such a linear H−3 species was reported also in rubidium and sodium polyhydrides under pressure.30,31
Experimentally, high quality and stoichiometric SnS films are deposited under H2S supply, which generally forms an S-rich condition that enhances the p-type conductivity and suppresses the formation of deep VS. Fig. 5(a) shows the calculated defect formation enthalpies (ΔH) of the dominant intrinsic defects VSn and VS under the S-rich/Sn-poor condition, where the equilibrium EF (EF,0) is pinned at 0.21 eV above the VBM by the crossover of VS and VSn, which explains the native p-type conduction, consistent with the previous experimental and theoretical studies.20–23 When the H-related impurities are considered, as shown in Fig. 5(b), Hi, HSn, [2H]Sn, and [3H]Sn become the dominant defects as they have lower ΔHs than VSn and VS. We confirmed that the S-site substitutions HS, [2H]S and [3H]S have too high ΔH to form and are excluded from Fig. 5(b) (see Table S1 in the ESI†). The equilibrium EF (EF,H) is shifted to a lower energy of 0.35 eV above the VBM, as a result of the compensation between the H+i and [3H]+Sn donors and the H−Sn acceptors (the neutral [2H]0Sn does not contribute to the carrier transport). At the EF,H, the densities of H+i, H−Sn, [2H]0Sn, and [3H]+Sn are estimated to be about 4.4 × 1016, 3.3 × 1017, 1.8 × 1019, and 3.3 × 1017 cm−3 (total nH = 3.7 × 1019 cm−3), respectively, while the hole density is reduced to as low as Nh = 3.4 × 1013 cm−3. These results semi-quantitatively explain the large difference between the total nH and Nh for the SnS films. That is, the incorporated H works more as a donor and shifts the EF away from the VBM; while, as the incorporated H works both as a donor and an acceptor, it cannot convert SnS to an n-type semiconductor and only reduces the Nh under the Sn-poor/S-rich condition.
 Fig. 5  Calculated formation enthalpies (ΔH) of dominant defects as a function of the Fermi level (EF) under (a and b) Sn-poor/S-rich and (c and d) Sn-rich/S-poor conditions, (a and c) without and (b and d) with H-related defects. The vertical dashed lines indicate the equilibrium EF. In (d), the horizontal blue lines show the reaction enthalpy for H to reduce SnS to Sn metal, which is smaller than the ΔH of H+i at EF > 0.28 eV. 
Even if we consider the Sn-rich/S-poor condition (Fig. 5(c)), it is unlikely to convert pure SnS to n-type, because there is no effective n-type source, although the formation of VSn acceptors is largely suppressed. Here we assess the viability of n-type conversion by H doping, which is expected to provide effective donors. Fig. 5(d) shows the calculated ΔH under the Sn-rich/S-poor condition. It is seen that H exists mainly as an H+i donor and an H−Sn acceptor. As a result of their balance, the EF,H is pushed up further to 0.68 eV above the VBM, giving rise to a weak n-type conduction. However, it should be noted that besides the possibility of effective H doping, the H sources work as chemical reductants and may reduce SnS to Sn metal. At EF > 0.28 eV (see the cross point of the orange and the blue lines in Fig. 5(d)), the calculated reaction enthalpy for H2 + SnS → H2S + Sn (ΔHr = 0.38 eV per H atom) becomes smaller than that for the H+i donors, which indicates that the H sources prefer to reduce SnS to Sn, rather than to stabilize the H+i donors. Note that even if we employ more reactive H atoms and radicals with larger H chemical potentials e.g. by H plasma to further decrease the ΔH for H+i and ΔHr, it would be rather difficult to realize n-type conduction because it also enhances the reduction reaction. Experimentally, our plasma exposure treatment (tplas ≥ 50 s) actually reduced SnS to Sn metal and therefore n-type doping was not achieved.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the H states in SnS by a combined experimental and DFT study. The density of impurity H in the as-deposited SnS film was in the order of 1019 cm−3, four orders of magnitude larger than the hole density, 3.5 × 1015 cm−3. DFT calculations revealed that H exists at the interstitial and the Sn-substitutional sites in SnS, which have lower formation enthalpies than the intrinsic defects, VS and VSn, and dominate the electrical properties of the real SnS films with impurity H. The intrinsic p-type conduction was caused mainly by the H-on-Sn (HSn) acceptors, rather than the Sn vacancies (VSn) as reported in the literature.16–23 Furthermore, it is found that the H plasma treatment cannot convert SnS to an n-type conductor, but reduced SnS to Sn metal, which is supported by the DFT results and also by our experiments. The present results emphasize the importance of multiple states and roles of H, which will be important insights to design and develop new chalcogenide semiconductors unintentionally and/or intentionally doped with H.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Hole density (Nh), (b) hole mobility (μh), and (c) hydrogen density (nH) in SnS films as a function of H plasma exposure time (tplas).	 

 	Fig. 2  Temperature (T) dependences of (a) hole densities (Nh) and (b) hole mobilities (μh) of the as-deposited and H plasma treated (tplas = 10 s) SnS films.	 

 	Fig. 3  DFT-relaxed local structures around H-related impurities in SnS. (a) H+i, (b) H0i, (c) H−i, (d) H−Sn (H+ on Sn2+), (e) [2H]0Sn (2H+ on Sn2+), (f) [3H]+Sn (3H+ on Sn2+), (g) H+S (H− on S2−), (h) [2H]2+S (H02 on S2−), and (i) [3H]+S (H3− on S2−). The violet, yellow, and red spheres indicate Sn, S, and H atoms, respectively. The H atoms are represented by red spheres and their atomic charges are indicated on the red spheres. The H–S, H–Sn, and H–H bond lengths are indicated by blue, green, and red numbers, respectively, in each panel.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated charge transition levels of H-related impurities along with those of the vacancies in SnS, VSn and VS.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated formation enthalpies (ΔH) of dominant defects as a function of the Fermi level (EF) under (a and b) Sn-poor/S-rich and (c and d) Sn-rich/S-poor conditions, (a and c) without and (b and d) with H-related defects. The vertical dashed lines indicate the equilibrium EF. In (d), the horizontal blue lines show the reaction enthalpy for H to reduce SnS to Sn metal, which is smaller than the ΔH of H+i at EF > 0.28 eV.
