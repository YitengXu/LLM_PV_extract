    , Accepted 22nd April 2020First published on 24th April 2020AbstractIn this study, the photoelectrochemical performance of Cu2O-based photoanodes is evaluated in terms of photoactivity and stability. The electrodes are based on the p–n junction consisting of Cu2O/Ga2O3, on which an Au layer is deposited, followed by the formation of Ni-based co-catalysts. The Au layer increases the light absorption in the entire wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm and leads to upward band bending at the Cu2O/Au interface; thus, more photogenerated hole charges are transported to the electrolytes. The electrodeposited FeNiOx thin layer significantly decreases the overpotential and increases the photoactivity; thus, the photoelectrochemical cell consisting of the Cu2O-based photoanode and platinum yields a photocurrent density of about 5.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with a small dark current density of 16 μA cm−2.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen gases offers the ability to convert solar energy directly into chemical energy since it produces a high purity fuel that can be stored and used on demand without generating unfavourable byproducts.1,2 For decades, many strategies to maximize solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency have been intensively investigated, including increasing light absorption, enhancing charge separation and transport, and improving redox ability.1,3–7 In general, high light absorption was obtained by lowering the bandgap by introducing various impurity elements into photocatalytic materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2).8–10 Various types of heterojunctions (type-II and Z-scheme) have also been suggested to increase charge separation efficiency as well as light absorption.11–13 The development of highly selective and efficient co-catalysts was also essential in improving photooxidation–reduction reactions as well as enhancing chemical stability, thereby, increasing the photocatalytic performance of photoelectrochemical cells.14–17
Among promising candidates for photoelectrodes, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was attractive due to its high light absorption with a small bandgap (∼2.1 eV), tunable bandgap, excellent photoactivity, and high earth abundance.18–20 These advantages allowed the fabrication of the material into many photocathodes, consisting of the common p–n junction and co-catalysts, that showed quite high photocatalytic performance.18–20 On the other hand, Cu2O is a p-type material and it has been thought that it was not suitable as a photoanode because the valence band maximum (Ev) level of Cu2O was higher than the ECuO/Cu2O redox level.21,28 This creates a CuO layer at the surface when Cu2O comes into contact with basic electrolytes, the process being named photocorrosion. This prohibits the hole transport toward the electrolyte, limiting the operating conditions such as a very narrow pH range and a low bias for stable operation.20–22 Therefore, the photocurrent density promptly decreases with the light illumination time, and the Cu2O layer is easily detached from the substrate. So far, there have been a few papers on photoanodes based on the p–n junction, in which the p-type materials such as NiO, Co3O4, and even Cu2O were in direct contact with electrolytes.23–27 The Ev levels of NiO and Co3O4 materials were higher than the EO2/H2O redox level without corrosion redox levels inside the forbidden bandgap. Thus, there were no such photocorrosion processes occurring at the surface. Cu2O was also decorated onto n-type materials in the form of nanoparticles, promoting hole transport toward the electrolytes. However, it was believed that CuO was still formed at the surface of Cu2O from X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, affecting the stability of the cells. Thus, the key for improving the stability and the photoactivity of Cu2O upon light illumination is the kinetic control of photo-generated holes so that they cannot access the photocorrosion redox level.
In this work, we demonstrate the possibility of using Cu2O for the fabrication of photoanodes with enhanced stability and photoactivity, based on the electrical tuning of the band alignment using the Au interlayer and the introduction of Ni-based co-catalysts. The photoanode mainly consists of an n-Ga2O3/p-Cu2O heterojunction, in which Au nanoparticles are coated on the n-Ga2O3 layer to enhance the electrodeposition of the Cu2O. The Au layer deposited on the Cu2O enhances the hole transport toward the electrolytes by the upward band bending in the Cu2O layer, increasing the photocurrent density to 4.28 mA cm−2 with the Ni layer. Additionally, FeNiOx was deposited and a photocurrent density of 5.15 mA cm−2 was obtained with a small dark current density of 16 μA cm−2, ascribed to the high photoactivity of the co-catalysts.
Results and discussion
The schematic diagrams of the photoanode fabrication processes are shown in Fig. 1a and detailed information is given in the Experimental section and the ESI.† The photoelectrode is composed of three layers: (i) the ITO electrode layer; (ii) the n-type gallium oxide/p-type copper oxide layer; and (iii) the Au/Ni passivation layer. The ITO electrode (150 nm, 20 Ω □−1) was deposited on double polished r-cut sapphire. Fig. S1† shows that the ITO/sapphire layer is highly transparent with a transmittance of over 80% in visible light, enough for light propagation through the bottom layer. On the ITO/sapphire layer, a 100 nm-thick gallium oxide layer was grown at 600 °C, followed by the dispersion of Au nanoparticles to provide nucleation sites for the growth of the copper oxide layer.29 To investigate the role of the Au nanoparticles in the growth of the copper oxide layer, the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the copper oxide growth was measured on the Ga2O3 and the Au NPs/gallium oxide electrodes immersed in an alkaline copper(II)–lactate solution, plotted in Fig. 1b. On the gallium oxide layer, at a pH of 11, there were three representative peaks at each step, at −0.15, 0.47, and 1.18 V, corresponding to the reduction of Cu2O to Cu, the reduction of CuO to Cu2O, and Cu oxidation, respectively. The peak corresponding to the reaction of Cu to Cu2O was not observed. When the Au nanoparticles were coated on the layer, the anodic peak of the reaction of Cu to Cu2O was clearly observed at about 0.5 V. This indicates that the electrodeposition of copper oxide, believed to be Cu2O, was favorable for the Au nanoparticles coated on the gallium oxide layer. Furthermore, as the pH of the electrolyte decreased from 11 to 8, the peaks disappeared, indicating that the oxidation–reduction potential of the Cu species was significantly dependent on the pH. Based on the results, the pH of the electrolyte was fixed at 11. The electrical properties of electrodeposited p-type Cu2O are shown in Table S1.† Finally, the Au/Ni passivation layer was formed on the copper oxide layer without delay in air. The real image of the photoelectrode is also shown in Fig. 1a.

Fig. 2a shows the SEM images of the photoelectrodes. The cross-sectional SEM image clearly illustrates that both the gallium oxide layer and copper oxide layer were well defined without any intermediate layer. The 100 nm-thick gallium oxide thin film grown at 600 °C reveals many grains approximately 0.5 μm in size with clear facets, reflecting the high crystallinity of the material. Before the deposition of the copper oxide layer, Au nanoparticles approximately 50 nm in average size were coated and it can be clearly seen that they were well-dispersed on the gallium oxide layer. The 1.2 μm-thick copper oxide layer had quite a dense columnar structure without the formation of any pits, terminated by a four-sided pyramid that was partially truncated on the surface. This shows that the Au nanoparticles acted as seeds in depositing a high-quality copper oxide layer, consistent with Fig. 1b. On the copper oxide layer, an Au/Ni passivation layer was deposited, as shown in Fig. 2a.

To identify the phases of the gallium oxide and copper oxide, XRD was employed and the patterns are plotted in Fig. 2b. The XRD spectra of ITO/r-Al2O3 showed that all the peaks corresponded to ITO, as is commonly observed in previous reports.30 When gallium oxide was grown on the ITO layer, four representative peaks at 35.6, 43.0, 60.9, and 76.2 were observed, which were indexed to the (111), (112), (020), and (603) planes. This shows that the oxide had a monoclinic β-Ga2O3 structure with lattice parameters of a = 12.23 Å, b = 3.04 Å, and c = 5.80 Å. After the electrodeposition of copper oxide, various peaks were also observed, in which three peaks at 36.5, 42.5, and 61.6 were indexed to (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic cuprous oxide (Cu2O) phase; two peaks at 38.1 and 64.8 corresponded to Au. No other crystalline phases such as CuO or Cu metal were detected. For further structural investigation of the surface of Cu2O, XPS measurements were carried out. The XPS spectra of Cu 2p and O 1s core levels were measured, as plotted in Fig. 2c. The peaks corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 are observed at around 932.7 and 952.7 eV, which match well with the literature values for Cu0 and Cu2O. However, the presence of metallic Cu clusters may be ruled out by considering the strong symmetry with a narrow full-width half-maximum value of about 1.13 eV and the lack of evidence of metallic Cu in the XRD spectra. The O 1s core level was also deconvoluted to 529.62 eV and 530.95 eV, corresponding to CuO and Cu2O, respectively. By considering the area of each peak, it can be clearly seen that the amount of Cu2O is larger than that of CuO. However, it can also be thought that the surface of the Cu2O layer is not stable, as it oxidizes in an air environment. Thus, a passivation layer to prevent oxidation must be formed before the Cu2O is exposed to air.
The optical absorption of the three Ga2O3, Cu2O/Ga2O3, and Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3 layers on the ITO/Al2O3 substrate were measured by subtracting the total reflection and transmission from the initially arrived light on the surface of the film through the ITO/Al2O3 substrate over a wavelength range of 300 nm to 800 nm (plotted in Fig. 3a). The Ga2O3 layer showed a low absorption of ∼10% in visible light, indicating that the layer is quite transparent, as shown in Fig. S1.† As Cu2O was grown on the Ga2O3 layer, the absorption remarkably increased to about 70% at 400 nm and to 50% at wavelengths larger than 600 nm. The increase of the absorption in the entire wavelength range is due to the small bandgap (∼2.1 eV) of Cu2O. When the Au/Ni film was then deposited on the Cu2O film, there was an additional increase of about 5% in the optical absorption over the entire UV-visible region. The increase in the absorption may be ascribed to the increase of the light propagation length between the Au nanoparticles and the Au/Ni layer that served as a back reflector; thus, the Cu2O layer can absorb more photons.31,32 The separation and transport of the photogenerated charges were evaluated by current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the photovoltaic device consisting of Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3/ITO which were carried out under dark conditions and 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Under dark conditions, the J–V characteristic showed the typical nonlinear Schottky-like transport behavior from the p–n junction although the reverse current was quite large. Under illumination, the device exhibited a short circuit current of about 1.2 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of about 0.2 V.

The PEC performance of the Cu2O-based photoelectrodes was examined in a three-electrode configuration with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Fig. 4a shows the photocurrent–potential characteristics of the p-Cu2O/n-Ga2O3-based photoelectrodes recorded in a 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 14.0) under vigorous stirring. AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was applied using a portable solar simulator through the bottom substrate. For the pristine p-Cu2O/n-Ga2O3 film-based electrode, a dark scan recorded at potentials ranging between 0.0 and 1.5 V versus RHE revealed quite a large background current of ∼1.38 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V. Upon illumination with white light, the electrode showed a photocurrent density of 1.10 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE. The large background current may originate from the oxidation of Cu2O to CuO, which is attributed to the accumulation of the holes generated by the incident light at the electrolyte/Cu2O interface.33,34 A broad distinct peak observed at about 0.7 V is a prominent feature of photooxidation.20 Finally, the Cu2O layer was peeled off from the Ga2O3 layer after a few scans of the photocurrent measurement, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4a.

(d) Energy band diagrams at the surface of Cu2O and at the interface of Au and Cu2O in contact with the electrolyte. 
To enhance the photoactivity of the electrode, Au was deposited on the Cu2O layer; then, Ni was deposited on the Au, forming an Au/Ni layer. As expected, the photocurrent density increased to 4.28 mA cm−2 with a dark current density of ∼0.65 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4a. The increase of the photocurrent was found in the IPCE spectra, in which the Au/Ni passivation significantly increased the IPCE from 7.3% to 19.1% at 390 nm, an enhancement of 2.62 times, compared with that of the p-Cu2O/n-Ga2O3 film. The increase of the photocurrent can be explained as follows: (i) the increase of the light absorption due to the Au back reflector (Fig. 3a); (ii) the enhanced hole transport at the interface of Au and Cu2O; and (iii) the improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity at the surface of Ni-based co-catalyst. The hole transport at the interface of Au and Cu2O was investigated with the modification of the interfacial band structures; thus, UPS was employed and the band bending at the Au/Cu2O interface was studied by using the valence band maximum (EVBM) and work function (Φ = 21.2 − ΔE) collected in the measurement. The band bending potential (Ebb) can be calculated from Ebb = EBVBM − ESVBM with respect to the Fermi level. For the measurement, a 20 nm-thick Au layer was deposited on the Cu2O layer and was introduced into the UPS chamber immediately. The UPS spectra were collected by measuring the sputtering time of Ar ions. Up to 400 s, no Cu 2p core level was observed and the Au 4f core level was not observed at 1400 s (Fig. S2†), meaning that the Au layer was fully sputtered away. As the sputtering time increased from 600 s to 1200 s, the secondary cut-off energy shifted toward a lower binding energy, from 0.44 eV to 0.16 eV. This indicates that the band at the interface of Au and Cu2O bent upward, by 0.16 eV with respect to the potential at the surface of p-Cu2O. Thus, the hole transport to Au (i.e., to the electrolytes) was enhanced; thereby, the oxygen evolution efficiency was increased by means of the decreased photocorrosion rate.
The Ni layer on Au, as a co-catalyst, can be also considered as one of the factors enhancing the photocatalytic performance. In general, Ni turns into partially reduced nickel oxide (NiO1−x) and nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) after several anodic scans, and NiOOH is a well-known highly active oxygen evolution co-catalyst.17,35 However, despite the enhanced photocatalytic performance, a dark current of ∼0.65 mA cm−2 was measured due to the oxidation of the Ni layer.36 In Fig. 4a, the peak at around 1.2 V, ascribed to the hole accumulation at the Ni metallic surface, was also observed in the Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3 based electrode. Here, as an effective catalyst for stable oxygen evolution, iron nickel oxide (FeNiOx) was electrodeposited on the Au/Ni film, in which equimolar amounts (0.01 M) of iron(III) nitrate and nickel(II) nitrate were used as precursors, and the pH of the solution was fixed at 7.3, as described in the Experimental section. In the SEM images of Fig. S3a,† it was seen that the FeNiOx grew in the form of a very thin film, the thickness of which is in the nanometer range. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra in Fig. S3b† show that Ni and Fe are the principal elemental components with an atomic ratio of Ni:Fe = 13:1 on the surface. However, in the XRD spectrum (Fig. S3c†), there were no peaks corresponding to the phases of FeNiOx and Ni-based hydroxides such as NiOOH and β-Ni(OH). It was proposed that the incorporation of Fe2+ could facilitate the formation of high oxidation-state Ni3+ and phase transformation of γ-NiOOH to β-Ni(OH)2, which is needed for the high activity in the water oxidation reaction.37,38 Under dark conditions, the current was measured to be 16 μA cm−2, negligible compared with the photocurrent densities of all photoelectrodes. Upon illumination, the current was significantly increased to 5.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, the largest photocurrent among all the samples. In Fig. 4b, there was no prominent difference in both IPCE spectra from the FeNiOx/Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3 and Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3, indicating higher activity than Ni.
For further investigation of the effect of the band bending at the interface of the Au and Cu2O layer on the hole transport toward the electrolyte, Al was deposited on the Cu2O layer, followed by the deposition of Au to prevent the oxidation of Al. Fig. S6a† shows that the secondary cut-off energy shifted toward a higher binding energy, from 0.44 eV to 0.50 eV. This implies that the band bent downward by 0.06 eV, with respect to the potential at the surface of p-Cu2O, indicating that the holes were accumulated at the interface of Cu2O and Au, as shown in Fig. S6b.† This is evident from the increase of the onset potential of the OER by about 0.5 V, compared with that of the FeNiOx/Ni/Au-deposited Cu2O-based photoanode. The photocurrent at 1.23 V also decreased to 3.85 mA cm−2, decreased by 1.35 mA cm−2, compared with that of the FeNiOx/Ni/Au-deposited Cu2O-based photoanode (Fig. S6c†). These results clearly show that the photocorrosion that occurred at the Cu2O layer can be reduced by designing a metallic layer between the Cu2O and co-catalysts.
To investigate the stability of the FeNiOx/Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3-based photoelectrode, the transient photocurrent density was measured as a function of voltages vs. RHE. The electrode exhibited swift photo-current responses when the light was turned on and off, and the response was quite stable with the voltage and a photocurrent density of 4.92 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V was obtained, as shown in Fig. 5a. This implies that the accumulation of photogenerated holes, causing the Cu2O photocorrosion, was significantly reduced. Fig. 5b also shows that the stable photocurrent density response is a function of measuring time until 2.5 h, compared with that of Cu2O/Ga2O3. Initially, a photocurrent density of 3.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V was measured and there was a slight decrease to about 1.67 mA cm−2 after 2.5 h. However, in the Cu2O/Ga2O3 sample, the photocurrent density significantly decreased to almost 0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V within a few seconds, as shown in Fig. S4.† The photos in Fig. S5† also show good stability of the photoelectrode. This shows that not only is the photocurrent density increased but photostability is also significantly improved for this photoanode compared to those of p-Cu2O/Ga2O3. The hydrogen and oxygen gas evolution test using the Pt counter electrode was carried out along with the 2 h stability test by gas chromatography, plotted in Fig. 5b. The initial rate of gas evolution was 51.3 μmol hour−1 for H2 and 24.8 μmol hour−1 for O2, respectively, in accordance with the ideal ratio of 2:1. Based on the results, the faradaic efficiency was calculated, by using the number of the electrons needed for O2 and H2 evolution, the moles of the gas evolved, and the total charge in Coulomb passed across the electrode during the test, to be about 89%.
 Fig. 5  (a) The transient photocurrent measurement, and (b) the stability and gas evolution test of FeNiOx/Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3. The amounts of oxygen and hydrogen evolved from the test were determined by gas chromatography. Both experiments were carried out at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. 
For further investigation of the stability, the chemical composition change of the Cu2O in the FeNiOx/Ni/Au/Cu2O/Ga2O3 photoanode after 2.5 h was studied by using XPS measurement, as shown in Fig. S7.† Here, the Au layer was peeled off. It was observed that there were three representative peaks in the Cu 2p core level spectrum, corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of Cu2O, and the characteristic satellite peaks (940.79 eV and 943.31 eV) of Cu 2p3/2 of CuO.39 In the O 1s core level spectrum, the intensity of the CuO peak increased. This means that some Cu2O was still converted to CuO during the measurement.
Experimental
Fabrication of photoelectrodes
As a substrate, r-cut sapphire was used; it was cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water. A 600 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer was deposited on the substrate using a radio-frequency magnetron sputter at 350 °C with a power of 110 W. The operating pressure was fixed at 1 mTorr controlled by an Ar gas flow rate of 20 sccm. The gallium oxide layer was directly deposited on the ITO layer via quartz tube-type metal organic chemical vapor deposition, as shown in Fig. S8,† at a temperature of 600 °C without any additional layer or surface treatment. As a precursor, trimethylgallium (TMGa) with N2 (20 sccm) was introduced as the carrier gas into a thermal reactor in flowing air (2000 sccm) during the growth period. The thickness of the gallium oxide layer was controlled by the growth time, ranging from 3 to 15 min. The operating pressure was maintained at 15 torr. Before the growth of the copper oxide layer, 70 nm spherical Au nanoparticles were purchased from BBI solutions and were coated onto the gallium oxide layer at a speed of 500 rpm for 5 min. Copper oxide was then electrodeposited using a lactic acid bath at 80 °C in the pH range of 8 to 11. Finally, high purity Ni-based metallic (Au/Ni and Al/Ni) layers were deposited on the copper oxide layer using an e-beam evaporator. Initially, the deposition rate was kept low (∼0.1 Å s−1) in order to get as uniform an interface as possible. To enhance the photoactivity of the photoelectrode, a Ni-based metal-oxide (FeNiOx) layer was electrodeposited on the metallic surfaces by using 16 mM nickel(II) acetate and 5 mM iron(III) sulfate Fe2(SO4)3, without pH adjustment.17
Materials characterization
All the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a FEI NOVA nanoSEM 200 operated at 5 kV. The XRD diffraction patterns were recorded on a normal X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The optical data were collected using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer system (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA), operated within the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Absorption spectra were calculated by 1 − R, in which R is the total reflection spectra obtained from the near normal incidence condition (8 °C off the normal surface). The measurement scheme is shown in Fig. S9.† X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were obtained for freshly prepared Ni/Au/p-Cu2O and Ni/Al/p-Cu2O using an ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) that used Al Kα radiation and ultraviolet He I respectively.
PEC characterization
A Cu clip was directly attached to the electrode with indium soldering. Epoxy paste was used to define the active area and to prevent unwanted contact between the Cu clip and the electrolyte. The electrodes were connected to an electrochemical analyzer (Iviumstat, IVIUM Tech., Netherlands) with a Cu lead wire. The measurements were conducted using a portable solar simulator (PEC-L01, PECCell, Japan) with an AM 1.5G filter employing a Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electrolyte used to obtain the photocurrent density was an NaOH aqueous solution (0.5 M, pH = 13.6) The wavelength-dependent incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was calculated according to the following equation:  J is the photocurrent density, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and I is the incident power density. The bias was 1.23 V vs. RHE.
Conclusions
In summary, we reported the photocatalytic performance of Cu2O-based photoanodes with enhanced photoactivity and stability. The photoanodes were composed of an n-Ga2O3/p-Cu2O junction, Au layer, and Ni-based passivation layer. On the ITO layer, the n-Ga2O3 layer was thermally grown at 600 °C, at which there was no significant change in the conductivity of ITO. Au nanoparticles were then decorated on the n-Ga2O3 layer to enhance the Cu2O deposition, forming a Schottky junction. The deposition of the Au/Ni layer on the Cu2O layer increased the light absorption to 80% at wavelengths less than 500 nm, with an increase of 5–10% in the entire wavelength range. The UPS spectra showed that the band at the interface of Au and Cu2O bent upward by 0.16 eV with respect to the potential at the surface of p-Cu2O. This indicates that more photogenerated charges were generated and transported to the electrolyte, compared to the photoanode without the Au/Ni layer. When Au was replaced by Al, the band at the interface of Al and Cu2O bent downward, and the photocurrent density decreased and the onset potential increased, confirming the effect of the band alignment on the photoactivity. Finally, as an efficient co-catalyst, FeNiOx was deposited and the photocurrent density significantly increased to 5.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with a small dark current density of 16 μA cm−2. The electrode also exhibited swift photo-current responses when the light was turned on and off, and a photocurrent density of 1.67 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V was measured after 2.5 h. These results clearly show that the photocorrosion that occurred at the Cu2O layer can be reduced by designing a metallic layer between the Cu2O and the co-catalysts, enhancing the photoactivity and stability.
