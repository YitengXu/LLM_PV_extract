    , Accepted 22nd May 2023First published on 23rd May 2023AbstractOrganic semiconducting polymers (OSPs) are the most promising candidates for future electronics due to their light weight, simplicity of synthesis, designability of molecular structures, remarkable chemical and thermal stability, tunability of properties, and innate flexibility. The appealing properties of OSPs can lead to their utilization for the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with high environmental stability. Herein, for the first time, we present a carbazole-based triarylamine (MAP1-18) organic semiconducting polymer for fabricating TENGs. The MAP1-18/PTFE-based TENG generates a high output electrical performance with a voltage of 796 V, current of 46 μA, and maximum power density of 148 μW cm−2 at a uniform 10 Hz frequency. Moreover, the MAP1-18-based TENG exhibits an extremely stable performance under high-temperature conditions of <120 °C, demonstrating its stability under extreme environmental conditions due to its high thermal stability indicated by its high glass transition temperature (Tg). The TENG device is further utilized to charge numerous commercial capacitors, drive up light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and run low-powered electronic devices. These results demonstrate that the fabrication of the MAP1-18-based TENG is a significant step towards the utilization of carbazole-based p-type organic semiconducting polymers for the fabrication of highly stable TENGs for use in harsh environmental conditions.
1. Introduction
The continuous development of wireless and wearable electronic devices for healthcare/medical monitoring, environmental sensing, and the internet of things (IoT) drives the demand for portable electrical power sources.1–3 A common example of tiny portable electronics is the mobile phone, which accounts for a significant portion of global power usage.4 The replacement of portable battery-powered devices with low-power wearable devices is expected to become a development trend for flexible electronics during the next few decades.2,5 The emerging technology as a self-powered source that can harness energy from the environment constitutes the burgeoning field of nano-energy, which is about the application of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies for collecting energy to power nano- or micro-devices.6 Mechanical energy is said to be the most readily available and specialized energy resource in the world among the numerous energy sources that are now available.7 Various kinds of nanogenerators, such as triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and thermoelectric, have been developed to convert mechanical, solar, and thermal energy into electrical energy.8–10
A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) generates electrical energy from mechanical energy via coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.11 It has attracted interest for the last few years due to its high energy conversion efficiency, excellent output performance, and simplistic structural properties.12,13 Hence, TENGs are a promising energy harnessing technology owing to their simple device structure and operation mechanism.13 They can produce electrical energy from various sources in contact-separation mode, with no material restrictions.14 Recently, various methods have been used to improve the electrical performance of TENGs in different working environments such as temperature and humidity, via selection of appropriate tribomaterials, optimization of the device structure, and the utilization of power management circuits.15,16 Choosing appropriate tribomaterials is an efficient way to enhance the electrical performance of TENGs under harsh environmental conditions for wearable and practical applications. Various kinds of materials such as 2D materials,17 biomaterials, etc., have been used as triboelectric materials.18–20 Moreover, a large number of polymers, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET),21 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),22 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),23 fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP),24 polyimide (PI),25 and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) have been widely employed in the development of TENGs. All these polymers are electrically insulating substances.
Organic semiconducting polymers (OSPs) are a unique class of polymers and are considered the most suitable materials for flexible electronics due to their high specific capacitance, light weight,26,27 simplicity of synthesis, designability of molecular structures, remarkable chemical and thermal stability,28,29 transparency,30 tunability of properties,31 and innate flexibility.32 Electrical and optical properties of these polymers result from conjugated carbon chains consisting of alternating single and double bonds resulting in highly delocalized π-electrons. The charge (electrons or holes) conduction properties of OSPs could help raise the performance of TENGs when these materials are employed as tribopositive or tribonegative materials. Due to the above-mentioned properties, OSPs have been recognized as one of the most favourable materials for TENG applications.33–35 Typical OSPs include polyaniline (PANI),36 polypyrrole (PPy),37 polyacetylene (PA),38 poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV),39 (PEDOT: PSS)40etc. A number of studies have been carried out on the use of the above mentioned OSPs for TENGs.41,42 Wang et al. first demonstrated that PPy can be used to make electrodes and triboelectric layers.43 Carbazole and triarylamines are the most extensively used units for constructing organic semiconducting polymers based on their excellent electrical and thermal properties.44,45 Carbazole-based triarylamines are a promising class of polymers having excellent thermal and chemical stability, light weight, low cost, and simplicity of synthesis.44
Herein, we present the synthesis of a carbazole-based triarylamine semiconducting polymer (MAP1-18) and its use as a tribopositive material for fabricating TENGs with high electrical performance. MAP1-18 contains a large number of electron-donating methoxy and methyl groups and has a low oxidation potential (HOMO = −4.8 eV). MAP1-18 and PTFE are employed as triboelectric layers for the fabrication of the TENG device. Our proposed device based on MAP1-18/PTFE demonstrates a very high stable output performance (796 V, 46 μA, and 148 μW cm−2) at a uniform 10 Hz frequency. Moreover, the MAP1-18-based TENG exhibits an extremely stable performance under high-temperature conditions of <120 °C. Furthermore, the MAP1-18/PTFE TENG was also used to drive 170 LEDs, to charge multiple commercial capacitors and to operate low-powered electronic devices. From these results, it can be demonstrated that the use of carbazole-based OSPs as tribopositive materials in TENG devices is a significant step and viable route towards achieving high performance and stable triboelectric nanogenerators.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. 2,7 Dibromocarbazole and sodium tert-butoxide were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). 1-Bromohexane, tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, 4-bromoanisole, and tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Tri-tert-butylphosphine was bought from Wako Chemicals, Japan.
2.2. Synthesis of MAP1-18
The synthesis scheme of carbazole-based triarylamine MAP1-18 is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The synthesis of MAP1-18 requires two steps.46 Initially, MA1-16 was synthesized using 2,7-dibromocarbazole and NaOH. For the synthesis of MA1-16, 2,7-dibromocarbazole (1.625 g, 5.00 mmol), powdered NaOH (1.20 g, 30.00 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) (0.161 g, 0.50 mmol) were dispersed in 20 mL acetone and then at the room temperature and the resultant solution was stirred for 10 min. After this, in the resulting solution, bromohexane (2.486 g, 7.50 mmol) was added dropwise, and the resultant mixture was heated under reflux for 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and added to 50 mL water. 50 mL ethyl acetate was used to extract the product, which was then concentrated after being dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Pure MA1-16 (1.70 g, 83.3%) was obtained by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate and n-hexane (1:10)) as colourless viscous oil, which crystallized to a white solid upon allowing it to stand. Furthermore, for the synthesis of MAP1-18, we used a 100 mL two-neck round bottom flask in which a mixture of MA1-16 (1.025 g, 2.500 mmol), 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (0.338 g, 2.500 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (0.059 g, 0.063 mmol), (tert-Bu)3P (0.025 g, 0.125 mmol), and tert-BuONa (0.481 g, 5.000 mmol) in toluene (15 mL) was degassed/refilled three times with argon and heated under reflux for 40 hours. After this, 4-bromoanisole (2.5 mmol) was added as a capping agent and the solution was refluxed for 4 hours. The solution was filtered through a Celite plug after cooling at ambient temperature, and the plug was thoroughly cleaned with dichloromethane. The concentrated solution was added dropwise to 200 mL of vigorously stirred methanol after the solvents had been vacuum-drained to a minimum of 3 mL, precipitating the polymer as short, greenish-brown fibres that were filtered and thoroughly washed with methanol. The polymer was suspended in chloroform (3.0 mL) and reprecipitated into well stirred methanol (200 mL). The polymer was filtered and washed well with methanol, followed by vacuum drying to get a greenish powder (68% yield).

2.3. Device fabrication
The TENG device was fabricated using MAP1-18 and PTFE as triboelectric layers in a vertical contact-separation mode. The schematic illustration of the proposed TENG is depicted in Fig. 2a. MAP1-18 acts as a tribopositive layer while PTFE acts as a tribonegative layer in the proposed TENG. The adhesive conductive copper (Cu) and aluminium (Al) tapes served as electrodes, while a PET sheet (flexible) served as a support for both the electrodes under a pressing force of 58 N with 10 Hz frequency. Due to the PET's exceptional flexibility and elasticity, full contact-separation between the two triboelectric layers was achieved. The MAP1-18 powder was uniformly attached to Al tape (adhesive side), while the PTFE sheet was directly fixed to the Cu tape. Apart from this, Cu outer wires were attached to the backsides of the Cu and Al tapes for external connections, and the size of the device was 5.5 × 5.5 cm2 as depicted in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The distance between the electronegative and electropositive layers was 8 mm as depicted in Fig. S1d (ESI†). Apart from this, the pictorial image of the pressing and front views of the fabricated TENG is illustrated in Fig. S1b and c (ESI†).

2.4. Characterization and measurements

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker 300 MHz instrument in deuterated chloroform. FT-IR spectra of MAP1-18 were measured utilizing an ALPHA II Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer. The molecular weight of MAP1-18 was measured using an RI detector (1260) and an Agilent 1260 Infinity II GPC system and by utilizing polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as an eluent. The surface morphology and elemental mapping were studied using a scanning electron microscope (MIRA-3 TESCAN, FESEM) with an EDS Oxford detector. XRD patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer at 1.5046 Å with a Cu target. UV-vis (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectra of MAP1-18 were measured in dichloromethane on an Agilent single-beam UV-vis absorption spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed utilizing an electrochemical analyser (CH Instruments). The electrical behaviour of the MAP1-18/PTFE TENG was characterized utilizing a SHINYEONG MECHATRONICS C32B 16-50 pneumatic air cylinder. The stability and output voltage of the MAP1-18/PTFE TENG were investigated using an oscilloscope (probe impedance is 100 MΩ, Agilent Tech). The output current of the device was explored utilizing an SMU (source measurement unit, B2902A). The output power (density) was measured using P = I2R/A. Here, R demonstrates the load resistance and A shows the area of the device while I indicates the current.
3. Results and discussion
The structure and synthesis route for MAP1-18 are shown in Fig. 1a. It was synthesized in two steps starting from commercially available 2,7-dibromocarbazole, which was N-alkylated via reaction with 1-bromohexane in the presence of NaOH in acetone followed by the well-established Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction between the N-alkylated dibromocarbazole (MA1-16) and commercially available 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.46–49 Structurally, MAP1-18 is a co-polymer of N-alkylcarbazole (through 2,7-positions of carbazole) and 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. In organic semiconductors, the bandgap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) determines how easy it would be for a material to lose electrons to get a positive charge. The band gap of MAP1-18 was determined from the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†) which indicates that it is a low bandgap material. The nitrogen atoms in its structure play the essential role of easily losing electrons to make this material suitable to be used as a tribopositive material.50 MAP1-18 is a polymer having triarylamine units where a nitrogen atom is covalently bonded to three aromatic rings. The triarylamines are well-known electron-donating materials used as hole-transporting materials in organic electronic devices including organic solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes. MAP1-18 acts as a strongly tribopositive material i.e., it loses electrons easily to acquire a positive charge because of its low oxidation potential (characterized by its shallow HOMO level of 4.8 eV). Because of the conjugated nature of the material (characterized by the alternating C–C single and double bonds), the generated positive charges are distributed over the entire polymer chains through the process of resonance adding to the stability of the charged state. In addition, the CV of MAP1-18 is depicted in Fig. S2b (ESI†). The supporting electrolyte was acetonitrile containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF4, the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl, and the counter and working electrodes were platinum wires. The ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was utilized as an internal standard. All CV measurements were conducted at a 50 mV s−1 scan rate. The chemical structure of MAP1-18 was characterized through 1HNMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2c, ESI†). Additionally, the most important feature that impacts the device's capacity to transmit charge during triboelectrification is the tribopositive layer's surface morphology. The FE-SEM images of MAP1-18 with a magnification level of 1 μm are shown in Fig. 1b, which confirms its round pellet-like structure. The cross-sectional (SEM) view of the MAP1-18 film is depicted in Fig. 1c which ensures the thickness of the tribopositive film of ∼20 μm. The elemental analysis of MAP1-18 was performed through EDS mapping and is shown in Fig. 1d, which confirms the existence of C, Na, Ca, and S peaks in MAP1-18. Moreover, the figure (inset) illustrates the wt% of C, Na, Ca, and S as 98.69, 0.14, 0.40, and 0.77%. However, the C k series, Ca k series, Na k series, and S k series of the EDS analysis are presented in Fig. 1e–h. The chemical composition of MAP1-18 was checked by FT-IR spectroscopy and is depicted in Fig. 1i. The peaks at around 1475 cm−1 were assigned to the tertiary-amine system's C–N stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1459 cm−1 and 1601 cm−1 were ascribed to the C–N stretching and C–C stretching vibrations of the carbazole system. The peaks at 2856 cm−1 and 2927 cm−1 were caused by the C–H stretching vibrations of the methoxy and methyl groups. Furthermore, the XRD analysis of MAP1-18 was also performed and is shown in Fig. 1j. The molecular weight (Mw = 3021 g mol−1, Mn = 2042 g mol−1, polydispersity index = 1.48) of MAP1-18 was estimated via gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene standards.
The structure of the TENGs using MAP1-18/PTFE is depicted in Fig. 2a. The device works on the contact-separation working mechanism depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As the external force was applied to the device, both the triboelectric layers came close, as depicted in Fig. S3i (ESI†). The positive and negative charges occurred on both the triboelectric layers (MAP1-18 and PTFE). Electrostatic induction causes an induced charge at the bottom/top electrodes opposite the triboelectric layers during the releasing process as illustrated in Fig. S3ii (ESI†), producing a potential difference, and electrons flow between electrodes. An equilibrium state is reached when both the triboelectric layers (top/bottom) separate completely, as depicted in Fig. S3iii (ESI†), and the current will disappear in this equilibrium state. After this, when both the triboelectric layers come close again, a potential difference is developed, and the current flows in the opposite direction as depicted in Fig. S3iv (ESI†). Hence, the cycle occurs continuously, and a current (alternating) will be produced under the uniformly applied force.
To examine the electrical performance of the TENG device, the device's voltage and current were measured under an excitation force of 58 N at 10 Hz frequency under ambient conditions. The photograph of the experimental setup used for the electrical characterization of the TENG device is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The electrical output performance of the TENG is demonstrated in Fig. 2b and c, and the obtained results (output voltage and current) are presented here. The TENG generates an output voltage of 796 V and a current of 46 μA. Multiple experiments were performed to assess the repeatability of the TENG device, producing the same maximum values of 796 V and 46 μA. Moreover, a TENG device without MAP1-18 (tribopositive layer) was fabricated, yielding an output voltage of 20 V and 2 μA as depicted in Fig. 2b and c. These results indicate that MAP1-18 is a good tribopositive material and is an excellent candidate for the fabrication of high-performance triboelectric nanogenerators. The important factor in the characterization of the TENG is its capability of power. The maximum power density of the MAP1-18/PTFE TENG was determined by changing the load resistance from 100 Ω to 50 MΩ. The device's current decreases when the resistance (100 Ω to 50 MΩ) increases. The MAP1-18/PTFE TENG achieved a maximum power density of 148 μW cm−2 at 20 MΩ resistance as illustrated in Fig. 2d. Hence, the output performances of the device such as 796 V, 46 μA, and 148 μW cm−2 clarifies that MAP1-18 is a good tribopositive material for the TENG's device fabrication. Additionally, the output behaviour of the triboelectric nanogenerator relies upon various device conditions including frequency, force, device area, and separation distance among the triboelectric pairs. Fig. 2e and f illustrate the output performance (voltage and current) of the device with various device sizes (3.5 × 3.5 cm2, 4.5 × 4.5 cm2, and 5.5 × 5.5 cm2) while the tribo-layer's distance was sustained at 8 mm. The voltage and the current increase from 596 V to 796 V and 15 μA to 46 μA, respectively, when the device area increases from 3.5 × 3.5 cm2 to 5.5 × 5.5 cm2. When the effective surface area increased between the electropositive (MAP1-18) and electronegative (PTFE) layers, a greater number of charges were transferred during the contact separation process due to which electrical performance of the device increased. The increase in the contact surface area will lead to enhancement in the surface charge density and is an essential parameter to improve the electrical performance of the TENG device. Similarly, the friction layer's distance plays an important aspect in the TENG device's electrical performance. The output performance (voltage and current) of the proposed device with an area of 5.5 × 5.5 cm2 was measured when the separation distance was assumed to be variable. The voltage and current enhanced from 275 V to 796 V and 36 μA to 46 μA respectively as shown in Fig. 2g and h when the distance was changed from 4 mm to 8 mm. The flow of electrons increases between the external circuits at larger separation distances owing to the enhancement of the electrostatic induction between the triboelectric layers. Overall, the performance (output) of the proposed device increases while enhancing the separation distance. In addition, the output performance of the TENG also depends upon the electron donating or accepting ability of the triboelectric materials. Hence, we have demonstrated the output performance of MAP1-18 (tribopositive material) with various electronegative layers including PTFE, PET, PDMS, Al, and cellulose. The TENG device fabricated using PTFE (electronegative layer) and MAP1-18 (electropositive layer) generated a maximum output performance of 796 V because PTFE has an excellent ability to attract the electrons from a tribopositive layer (MAP1-18) as shown in Fig. 2i. Apart from this, the TENG device fabricated using PET (electronegative), and MAP1-18 (electropositive) layers generated a voltage of 200 V due to the moderate electron accepting abilities of PET. Moreover, the TENG fabricated using cellulose and MAP1-18 generated a very low voltage. These results clarify that MAP1-18 has an excellent ability to donate electrons during triboelectrification. Apart from this, energy conversion efficiency of the MAP1-18/PTFE based TENG device is shown in Note S1 of the ESI.† The obtained η of the TENG device is 14.06% at 20 MΩ load resistance.
The device stability was also measured by applying constant force to investigate the durability of the device, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. 3a, the device's output performance (voltage) did not show any degradation within 40000 cycles. Furthermore, the proposed device's long-term durability was also measured as depicted in Fig. 3b, which shows the durability of the device for 20 days. Herein, we have also investigated the thermal behavior of MAP1-18 and the output performance of the MAP1-18/PTFE TENG device, in the temperature range of 30–120 °C. Glass transition temperature (Tg) is an essential parameter for investigating the thermal stability of a material. To evaluate the thermal behaviour of MAP1-18, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was performed as depicted in Fig. 3c. MAP1-18 has a high value of Tg of 159 °C, obtained from the DSC experiment's second heating scan. From the DSC experiment, it can be concluded that MAP1-18 retains its structural integrity at high temperatures. Due to the high thermal stability of MAP1-18, the output voltage of the TENG (MAP1-18/PTFE) using slight hand tapping was investigated while varying the temperature from 30 °C to 120 °C. The TENG was placed on a hot plate and the temperature was changed. Magic gloves were utilized to apply the hand excitation force at high temperatures. Fig. 3d shows that due to the excellent thermal stability of MAP1-18, the electrical behaviour of the TENG device is stable in the temperature range of 30 °C to below 120 °C. Moreover, temperature dependent current curves are shown in ESI Fig. S5.† Thus, the fabrication of the MAP1-18/PTFE-based TENG is a significant and viable route toward high-performance and highly stable energy harvesting applications. The detailed comparison is described in Table S1.† Moreover, voltage of the proposed TENG was rectified using a bridge rectifier to run low-power devices. The TENG device was also used to charge multiple capacitors (4.7 μF, 10 μF, 47 μF, and 100 μF) as depicted in Fig. 3e. These commercial capacitors charged quickly up to 16 V, 13.1 V, 2.8 V, and 1.3 V, respectively. In a similar way, for the 10 μF capacitor, the charging and discharging behaviour is depicted in Fig. 3f. Fig. 3f demonstrates that the proposed TENG device can efficiently charge and discharge the 10 μF capacitor, thus having good capability to run low-power devices.

To investigate the self-powered ability of the MAP1-18/PTFE based TENG, 170 commercial LEDs were connected in series through a bridge (full-wave) rectifier as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The schematic circuit diagram to drive the 170 LEDs and pictorial image of the connections of the TENG with LEDs are illustrated in Fig. 4a and S6 (ESI†), respectively. The TENG (MAP1-18/PTFE) can easily drive the LEDs as shown in Fig. 4b and the movie for the 170 LEDs is shown in ESI Movie S1.† The TENG was connected to an electronic calculator as shown in Fig. 4c. The realized image of the circuit diagram of the TENG device with an electronic calculator through a 4.7 μF capacitor and a rectifier is shown in ESI Fig. S7.† The proposed TENG device can easily drive the calculator, as depicted in Fig. 4d, and this operating movie is shown in ESI Movie S2.† Finally, the TENG device based on MAP1-18/PTFE was utilized to harvest the biomechanical energy from palm tapping, finger tapping, and slight hand tapping. The voltages of the finger tapping (one finger, two fingers, and three fingers), palm tapping, and slight hand tapping are shown in Fig. 4e and f.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have explored the potential of a carbazole triphenylamine (MAP1-18)-based tribopositive organic semiconducting polymer to fabricate a triboelectric nanogenerator. MAP1-18 and PTFE were employed as triboelectric layers in the TENG device. The MAP1-18/PTFE-based TENG with a device size of 5.5 × 5.5 cm2 generated an excellent output performance such as voltage (796 V), current (46 μA), and a maximum power density of 148 μW cm−2. Moreover, MAP-18 shows an extremely good thermal stability and a glass transition temperature (Tg) value of 159 °C. Thus, the fabricated TENG device showed excellent stable output performance in a wide temperature range of 30 °C to below 120 °C. The proposed TENG device also demonstrated high stable performance for 40000 cycles under continuous stepping of a pneumatic air cylinder and long-term working stability of more than 20 days. Moreover, the TENG (MAP1-18/PTFE) device was utilized to charge different dielectric capacitors, drive 170 LEDs, and run low-power devices (calculator). This paper demonstrates that MAP1-18 has excellent potential for the fabrication of high-performance and stable triboelectric nanogenerators.
