Here, we employ cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) to resolve the landscape of Y6 packing in neat films (unlike single crystals) in relation to device performance, and reveal how processing with carbon disulfide and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) influences its molecular packing, prominently the backbone ordering.

Our results suggest an effective molecular packing structure in solid films, and the prominent role of backbone ordering in photoelectric conversion processes, which will outline the future development of OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive research efforts for being a flexible, semi-transparent, easily solution processable, and eco-friendly energy source.1–4 Impressive development of organic semiconductors and innovative device engineering have led to a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs, employing polymeric donors and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).5–15 Most notable of NFAs is the famous 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)6 with the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structural framework. It was reported that the π–π stacking between the terminal groups in ITIC derivatives promotes efficient π-orbital transport properties.2,3,16,17 Meanwhile, terminal interaction facilitated backbone ordering has also been proven to be favourable for transport and photoelectric performance.18,19 These reports suggested the importance of molecular structure ordering in solid films in governing efficient charge-transport properties towards impressive performance of OSCs.
The emergence of Y6, where 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), pyrrole and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) comprise a D–A–D central core, with end blocking of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) units,20 has led to a rapid increase of PCEs.21–26 For instance, layer-by-layer processed ternary OSCs achieved a high PCE of 18.16%;27 the development of Y6 derivatives endowed binary OSCs with an efficiency exceeding 18%.28 In addition, derivatives of Y6 have also been reported to demonstrate their single-crystals and reveal one unique structural paradigm employing both H aggregation of central cores and J aggregation of terminal groups.29–32 Taking Y6 as an example, it has been confirmed that (i) the π–π interaction between end-groups (J aggregation), and (ii) the face-to-face π-core interaction between BT moieties (H aggregation) enable a monoclinic unit-cell of Y6.33 Therefore, a cross-plane backbone network is present with the formation of a 2D channel perpendicular to the π–π direction and yields a 3D network in a Y6 single crystal. Such special molecular packing structures are different from those in ITIC single crystals and are considered as one of the structural explanations of the remarkable dominance of Y6 and its derivatives for OSCs.
Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the molecular packing structures in NFA based films are different from those of their respective single crystal, due to the suppressed capability of molecular assembly from solution processing.34,35 For example, in ITIC films the molecules prefer intermolecular π–π stacking between terminal groups, which is different from the 1D edge-to-face stacking structure in its single crystal.16 Hence, for the unique molecular packing in Y6 crystals, it is important to explore the molecular packing structures in Y6 solid films in relation to their photoelectric conversion process. Recently, H- and J-aggregation of Y6 derivatives – BTIC-CF3-m – were controlled by solvent additive mediated intermolecular interactions, hinting at their significant role in relation to the respective photoelectric process.36 However, due to the lack of investigations of Y6 solid films and insights into their molecular packing structures, there is a need for a clear morphological understanding of the complex polymer:Y6 blends.
In this study, we investigated these significant prospects by conducting a comprehensive structure study on Y6 and PM6:Y6 films, and evaluated its impact on their electronic and optoelectronic properties. First, molecular packing of Y6 in pure films was studied via grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM), crystallography analysis, and atomic molecular dynamics simulations. The landscape of the molecular mesoscopic structure in Y6 films was present as a face-on dominant molecular packing structure with in-plane long-range backbone packing and out-of-plane π–π stacking. Afterwards, the influence of packing structures, particularly backbone ordering was correlated with the optoelectronic properties of films, while we used carbon disulfide (CS2) and fullerene to improve the crystallinity of Y6. In addition to the enhanced optical absorption, we confirm that long-range backbone ordering offers reduced energetic disorder with respect to the electron transport level and yields enhanced electron mobility and free carrier lifetimes. Furthermore, the refined heterojunction morphology suppresses the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination and improves the overall charge transport properties in realizing a high PCE of 16.8%.
Results and discussion
Molecular packing of Y6 based solid films
The Y6 packing structures on the molecular level were investigated by GIWAXS,37 as shown in Fig. 1. The calculated powder pattern of Y6 single crystal acts as a reference to mark the scattering peaks in GIWAXS line cuts (detailed in the ESI†). According to the literature, the Y6 single crystal is assigned to triclinic system with a = 13.73 Å, b = 19.66 Å, and c = 29.71 Å (Fig. 1c),33 and hence the miller index (hkl) based on this coordinate was utilized to connect the scattering peaks with molecular packing (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 1a, the as-cast Y6 film exhibits a face-on dominated orientation with a prominent π–π stacking peak located at 1.75 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a broad in-plane (IP) scattering peak at 0.42 Å−1. Processing a pure Y6 film utilizing solvent vapor annealing of CS2, we note new scattering peaks at 0.22 Å−1, 0.33 Å−1 and 0.66 Å−1 along the IP direction and distinct OOP scattering signals between 0.5 and 0.6 Å−1 ranges. The three former scattering peaks resulted from the (001), (010), and (003) lattice planes and the latter scattering peaks are assigned to the {101} and {111} lattice planes (Note S1†). Such scattering peaks indicate that the Y6 film exhibits a periodic molecular packing structure along the b- and c-crystal axes in the IP direction, and an ordered molecular packing along the a-axis in the OOP. The changes in molecular packing structures suggest an appropriate swelling capacity of CS2 to reduce the molecular motion barrier, enabling enhanced self-assembly capability of Y6.38,39 Considering the banana-like shape as well as the end-group and core linked stacking of Y6, here we referred the molecular packing along the b- and c-axes as backbone packing, and the packing structure along the a-axis as π–π stacking. The dominant face-on orientation in all three films suggests that the b- and c-axes are approximately parallel to the substrate and the a-axis is presumably perpendicular to the base. Though the loading of PC71BM exhibits similar packing structures, a larger coherence length value (LA) was calculated from the (001) peak in the Y6:PC71BM SVA film (52.2 nm) as compared to the Y6 SVA film (34.7 nm, Fig. S2†). This suggests improved backbone packing indicating the use of efficient three-dimensional structural motifs for charge transport.

(c) Molecular packing in the Y6 unit-cell. The lattice planes of the (001), (002), (003), and (010) calculated using the Mercury software are highlighted to attract attention. 
To further elaborate the packing structures of Y6 based films in real space, we used Cryo-TEM40 and their reciprocal space image transformed by fast Fourier transform (FFT), as illustrated in Fig. 2a–c. The pure Y6 film exhibits few crystal regions in real space and its reciprocal space image shows two isotropy circles with radii of 0.44 and 0.70 nm−1, which indicates relatively disordered molecular packing consistent with the X-ray scattering results. However, the Y6 SVA film exhibits more crystal regions and the FFT image details three rings with radii of 0.36, 0.57, and 0.71 nm−1. Such evolution of Y6 packing distances and structures imply the effect of SVA on enabling improved self-assemble capability of Y6 molecules. Moreover, combined with SVA and PC71BM, long-range backbone ordering near the 100 nm scale is observed in the Y6:PC71BM SVA film. This suggests the synergistic effect of CS2 and PC71BM in promoting assembly capability and enhancing Y6 skeleton packing. The FFT pattern shows an extra ring with a radius of 1.05 nm−1, consistent with the 0.67 Å−1 peak in the IP direction (from the X-ray scattering), confirming our earlier assessment of long-range backbone packing. Importantly, the discontinuous FFT pattern in the Y6:PC71BM SVA film (Fig. 2d) suggests the crystalline Y6 domains as we observed a local single-crystal-like molecular structure. Such observation confirms the strengthened Y6 backbone orders as shown in Fig. 2b and c (white arrows). Meanwhile, we draw four groups of orthogonal lines to extract the packing distance, as shown in Fig. 2e. The average distances along lines (1–4) of 1.95 nm and lines (5–8) of 2.85 nm were revealed, respectively, via calculating the intensity periodicity. These values are close to the b- and c-crystal axis values of the Y6 single crystal, further confirming the presence of a long-range single crystal like structure in such a film. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image showing the Y6 crystal structure in solid films.

(e) The profiles along the lines in the Y6:PC71BM SVA film. Average distances along lines (1–4) of 1.96 nm and lines (5–8) of 2.85 nm were revealed, respectively. These values are close to the b and c crystal axis values of the Y6 single crystal. 
To gain an insight into how the intermolecular interaction between Y6 and PC71BM facilitates Y6 backbone packing, atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Here PC71BM was represented by its fullerene analog of PC61BM due to the structural and computational similarity. The geometric structures of Y6 and fullerene are optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The computational details can be referenced in the ESI,† and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. S3c,† fullerene tends to form the continuous molecular stacking in the Y6:fullerene bulk. Fig. S3d† indicates that fullerene slightly reduces the interaction probability of BT–BT and TT–TT but has limited impact on the packing distance between the Y6 molecular dimer. Importantly, fullerene prefers to locate close to the 2FIC end group of Y6 (Fig. S3e†), suggesting a stronger interaction between the fullerene and 2FIC. This indicates that the use of fullerene improves the 2FIC interaction between Y6 molecules, and ultimately enhances the backbone ordering of Y6 with the aid of enhanced self-assemble capability by CS2.
Structure analysis of PM6:Y6 based solid films
PM6:Y6 based films41 were prepared using chloroform (CF) based solutions with 0.5% of 1-chloronaphthalen (CN) and were characterized using GIWAXS, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. Scattering peaks at ∼0.22 Å−1 and ∼0.42 Å−1 were chosen to assess the Y6 packing structure evolution as the overlapped signal of PM6 and Y6 at ∼0.3 Å−1 would compromise the intended analysis. Notably, the (001) scattering peak only exists in the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA film, and the LA values is about 58.6 nm, suggesting the role of CS2 and PC71BM in promoting Y6 towards long-range backbone packing in the PM6:Y6 blend. Meanwhile, the crystallinity of Y6 gradually increased in PM6:Y6 SVA and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA films, as calculated from peaks at ∼0.42 Å−1 and 1.74 Å−1 (Fig. S4†). Moreover, the three blends are characterized via Cryo-TEM and the related images are shown in Fig. S5.† The ordered Y6 packing structures are absent in the PM6:Y6 blend but present in PM6:Y6 SVA and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blends. Importantly, the FFT points corresponding to the (001) scattering peak disappear in the PM6:Y6 SVA film but are highlighted by white arrows in the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA film. This confirms the increased backbone packing in the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA film. Furthermore, the Heman's parameters S were −0.31, −0.31, and −0.29, for PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA, respectively (Fig. S6†),42,43,72 indicating slightly enhanced population of edge-on crystallites due to the sphere-like structure of PC71BM. The above structure analysis concludes enhanced long-range Y6 backbone packing in the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blend and three-dimensional structural motif, which shows potential for efficient charge transport.

To study the nano-scale phase separation in these blends, we employed TEM and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS).44,73 The homogeneous TEM images of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA films (Fig. S7†) indicate a similar phase distribution and the well mixed feature of PM6 and Y6. A quantitative phase distribution scale was determined using 285 eV X-ray for optimal material contrast (Fig. 3e). The scattering signal at a low-q position of 0.02 nm−1 originating from the mass thickness couldn't represent real phase separation. The scattering peaks at ∼0.16 nm−1 in these three blends indicate an almost unchanged domain size of around 20 nm, implying the limited impact of SVA and PC71BM on the phase distribution scale.
On the other hand, the PM6:Y6 SVA film exhibits a higher domain purity of 1.08 than the PM6:Y6 blend (we referenced the domain purity of the PM6:Y6 blend to be 1.00), suggesting that the enhanced self-assembly capability of Y6 using CS2 favors of domain purity. For the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA film, however, due to the different material contrast values between PM6/Y6, PM6/PC71BM, and Y6/PC71BM (Fig. S8†), we are unable to observe the influence of PC71BM on domain purity directly. To focus on PC71BM traces and their influence on the phase distribution scale, we utilized 284.2 eV X-ray and characterized the PM6:Y6 blends with different loading ratios of PC71BM. With a larger PC71BM ratio exceeding 0.5, we observed bimodal domain sizes of ∼24 and ∼11 nm (Fig. S9†); the former value is close to the domain size in the PM6:Y6 blend and the latter value is close to the domain size in the PM6:PC71BM film. As we note that PC71BM dominant phases only appear in PM6:Y6:PC71BM blends when the PC71BM ratio exceeds 0.5, therefore with 0.25 loading ratio, fullerene prefers to dissolve in PM6 and Y6 dominant phases and exhibits faint effects on domain purity. Conclusively, optimal PC71BM incorporation of 0.25 and SVA treatment of films have marginal influence on the phase distribution scale, but improve the molecular packing particularly long-range backbone ordering of Y6, and thus show potential for efficient charge transport in OSCs.
Photoelectric properties of a PM6:Y6 based device
To establish a comprehensive structure–property relationship in Y6 based devices, we optically characterized the blends based on their photoelectric properties. As shown in Fig. 4a, UV-vis absorption of blends reveal two distinct peaks at ∼628 nm and ∼808 nm assigned to PM6 and Y6, respectively. The main absorption peak of Y6 showed a red-shift from 808 to 814 nm, and finally reached 818 nm for the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blend. The blend absorption tail moves to a higher wavelength region with SVA and the incorporation of PC71BM, resulting in a broader absorption range. We attribute this to improved molecular packing, particularly the enhanced long range ordering of Y6 in PM6:Y6 blends.45,46

To further evaluate the prospect of influential Y6 packing and long range ordering in improving the optoelectronic properties of blends. We fabricated corresponding conventional devices. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the champion devices are plotted in Fig. 4b. The control device shows a moderate PCE of 15.78% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.847 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.68 mA cm−2, and FF of 72.50%, which is comparable to the previous report.20 Devices with SVA processing exhibit enhanced Jsc and FF of 26.09 mA cm−2 and 74.65%, respectively, sacrificing the reduction of Voc to 0.833 V. These contribute to a higher PCE of 16.26%, and indicate the significance of Y6 crystallinity and domain purity in promoting photovoltaic performance. Afterwards, the combination of CS2 and PC71BM yields the highest PCE of 16.82% and average PCE of 16.53%, with a Voc of 0.834 V, Jsc of 26.36 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.07%, which underlines the importance of backbone ordering in device performance. We also confirmed the earlier suggested optimal ratio of PC71BM to be 0.25, as illustrated in Fig. S10 and Table S1.†

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted to determine Jsc. As shown in Fig. 4c, the EQE response shoulder of SVA and PC71BM processed devices shifts from 800 to 820 and 830 nm, respectively, indicating an improved photoelectric conversation capability of Y6, which matches well with the red-shifted UV-vis absorption spectra. Besides, we note that the reduced charge recombination loss for PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA is responsible for Voc being similar to that of PM6:Y6 SVA, even with the reduced bandgap (Fig. S11, S12 and Table S2†). Improved photoelectric properties, most significantly the device FF, has confirmed the influence of improved molecular packing of Y6, particularly its long range ordering on the charge transport properties of respective devices.
Blend carrier dynamics in PM6:Y6 blends
To further analyze the significant improvement of charge transport properties due to the improved molecular packing of Y6, we scale the devices for the energetic disorder with respect to their electron transport level. The Gaussian disorder model is used to calculate the energetic disorder (σ),47–49 where temperature-dependent charge mobility is calculated via the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S13†).50 The relation between σ and carrier mobility is,48,51 (1)where μ0 is the zero-field mobility, μ∞ is the mobility pre-factor, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 4d shows the electron mobility as a function of 1/T2 and relative σ values. The energetic disorder of the electron transport level decreases with SVA treatment and PC71BM incorporation. This indicates that the long-range Y6 backbone ordering narrows down the density of state (DOS) near the electron transport level, thus yielding favorable transport via suppressed carrier relaxation into their tail states.48,51 We also confirmed the improved electron mobility in PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA devices. (Table 1 and Fig. S14†).
To further investigate the charge transport and recombination properties, the charge carrier lifetimes (τ) of devices were measured by transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements.52,53 As shown in Fig. 4e, the carrier lifetime of the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA device at 0.5 V corrected photovoltage was estimated to be 8.87 μs, while that of PM6:Y6 SVA and PM6:Y6 is 5.51 μs and 2.13 μs, respectively. The increased carrier lifetime suggests reduced charge trap channels leading to higher FF values of the optimal device.
The light intensity dependent Voc is employed to study the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. As shown in Fig. 4f, the ideality factors (n) of 1.13, 1.12, and 1.05 were recorded for the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA devices, respectively, where SRH recombination (n = 2) or bimolecular recombination (n = 1) is the dominant mechanism.54,55 Considering the similar bimolecular recombination rate suggested by the Jsc ∝ Plightα model (Fig. S15a†), it is reasonable to deduce that the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA device exhibits less non-geminate recombination (originating from bimolecular and SRH) compared to other two counterparts.56 Besides, the charge dissociation and collection probabilities (P(E, T)),57 obtained from the profiles of photocurrent density at the saturated current density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff), were calculated to be 96.29%, 96.69%, and 98.15% for the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA devices, respectively (Fig. S12b†). These results indicate that the SVA and PC71BM processed devices with modified backbone ordering show suppressed SRH recombination and improved charge extraction efficiency, leading to a higher device FF.
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was adopted to further investigate the impact of Y6 packing on charge carrier dynamics in donor and acceptor phases. 708 nm excitation wavelengths were selected to excite a large portion of Y6 phases (Fig. S16a–c†). The exciton-to-charge conversion dynamics with 708 nm excitation in blends are compared in Fig. 5a, where the plots are obtained via a global decomposition of the TA spectra using excitons and charges from the relevant films as the reference. Considering the efficient exciton diffusion of Y6,58 our TA analysis suggests acceptor excitons to be dissociated within 5 ps. We also note the development of free charge carriers at similar scale peaking close to 100 ps, consistent with earlier reports of Y6 based blends.59,60 Rise time of free charges were quantified to be 15.8 ps, 10.6 ps, and 8.6 ps for the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blends, respectively. Because of the similar domain size, this observation suggests that the improved long range ordering of the Y6 backbone facilitates the hole-transfer rates. Recently, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the electrostatic interfacial field plays a central role in assisting free charge generation.61–65 In the PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA sample, the long range backbone ordering of Y6 facilitates a shaper molecular concentration gradient near the D/A interface, which is the driving force that creates the electrical potential bias to enable efficient and barrierless free charge generation.

(b) The neat PM6 film and blend decay dynamics at 550–600 nm, pumped at 600 nm for preferential PM6 excitation. 
To elaborate the influence of PC71BM incorporation on polymer exciton dynamics, we excited the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA samples using a 600 nm laser (Fig. S17†). As the excited species includes the excitons and the polarons in the donor and acceptor phases, it is challenging for TA spectral analysis to resolve the exciton and polaron dynamics due to the complexity of the system. Here, we focus on the ground state bleaching (GSB) signals of PM6, the positive signatures between 550 and 650 nm. Both excitons and hole polarons contribute to the GSB; however, we extracted hole kinetics (Fig. 5b) from delayed time GSB signals after 50 ps (the exciton decay time of neat PM6 is only ∼20 ps). The data presented in Fig. 5b show no decay of the PM6 GSB from 50 ps to 3 ns in the ternary blends, and suggest no significant bimolecular recombination in these timescales. In contrast, the PM6 GSB signal grows over this timescale, which we attribute to hole-transfer from Y6. This explains the high performance of the ternary devices, confirming that PC71BM does not form notable carrier traps in PM6 domains. We suggest that long-range energy transfer66,67 from PM6 to Y6 can be the key mechanism for the donor excitons to bypass PC71BM trap centers and transfer directly near the PM6/Y6 interfaces. We calculate a Förster energy transfer radius of 5.1 nm from PM6 and Y6 (Fig. S18†), which is in agreement with other NFA systems67,68 due to strong resonant overlap. Moreover, the effective energy transfer distance from PM6 to Y6 in films will be even longer, since it will benefit from the more favorable scaling of point-to-surface type transfer.69 Considering that the highly mixed donor and acceptor domains of PM6:Y6 blends are small enough (<3 nm),70,71 we expect efficient energy transfer from PM6 to Y6 phases. Therefore, the trap centers that PC71BM may be expected to introduce in PM6 can be avoided by rapid energy transfer to the Y6 phase. Fast charge development contributed largely by the acceptor phase due to its influential Y6 packing from SVA and PC71BM incorporation can account for the improved ternary device performance.
We summarized the structure-photoelectric correlation in Fig. 6, revealing that long range backbone ordering of Y6 molecules via SVA and PC71BM incorporation has improved the charge development rate and their lifetime, while the energetic disorder and ideality factor were reduced. In this work, we have outlined the importance of the Y6 backbone packing length in reducing the non-geminate recombination while facilitating an efficient charge transport process to enable high device PCEs from PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blends.

Conclusion
The landscape of Y6 molecular packing in thin films was carefully investigated by combining X-ray and electron scattering, crystallography analysis, and numerical simulation. The face-on dominant molecular packing structure with in-plane packing of the conjugate backbone and out-of-plane π–π stacking is observed in Y6 solid films. In addition, SVA treatment using CS2 and fullerene (PC71BM) incorporation improved the self-assembly capability of Y6 molecules, and helped to achieve a long-range backbone ordering structure in Y6 based films. Optical and photoelectric characterization studies indicate that the improved molecular packing results in broadened film absorption and reduces the energetic disorder near the electron transport level, thus yielding increased electron mobility and charge carrier lifetimes. We show that charge trapping in isolated PC71BM clusters (a potential risk of ternary blends) is avoided by resonant energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Thus, the enhanced molecular packing and blend morphology contribute to the improved charge generation, transport and extraction, and ultimately a high power conversion efficiency of 16.8%. Our findings would inspire improved material design and morphological optimization, targeting long-range backbone ordering of NFAs for enhanced photovoltaic performance.

 	Fig. 1  X-ray characterization of Y6 molecular packing in solid films. (a) GIWAXS line-curves and (b) 2D scattering patterns of Y6, Y6 SVA and Y6:PC71BM SVA films. (c) Molecular packing in the Y6 unit-cell. The lattice planes of the (001), (002), (003), and (010) calculated using the Mercury software are highlighted to attract attention.	 

 	Fig. 2  Real-space characterization of Y6 molecular packing in solid films. (a–c) Cryo-TEM images of Y6, Y6 SVA, and Y6:PC71BM SVA films. The inset reciprocal space images were processed using fast Fourier transform (FFT). (d) The FFT pattern of the real-space inputs in the (c) image of the Y6:PC71BM SVA film. (e) The profiles along the lines in the Y6:PC71BM SVA film. Average distances along lines (1–4) of 1.96 nm and lines (5–8) of 2.85 nm were revealed, respectively. These values are close to the b and c crystal axis values of the Y6 single crystal.	 

 	Fig. 3  Molecular packing and morphology characterization in PM6:Y6 based blends. (a) GIWAXS line cuts, (b–d) 2D patterns, and (e) RSoXS profiles of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA films.	 

 	Fig. 4  Photoelectric characterization of PM6:Y6 based devices. (a) Normalized absorption spectra, (b) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic and (c) EQE response curves and integrated Jsc, of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6 SVA, and PM6:Y6:PC71BM SVA blends under standard measurements. (d) Zero-field electron mobility as a function of 1/T2, (e) charge carrier lifetimes (τ) at varied bias photovoltages and (f) Voc plotted against the light intensity of related devices.
