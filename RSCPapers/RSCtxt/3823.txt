Reverse osmosis (RO), the most common technology for desalination today, uses much less energy than thermal processes. Several modifications and improvements have been made to RO during the last four decades in order to minimize energy consumption, and the process is now near thermodynamic limits. To further reduce energy requirements for desalination, other approaches are needed. A microbial desalination cell (MDC) is a recent technology that could be used as an alternative to RO. An MDC uses electrical current, produced by electrochemically active bacteria, to concurrently generate bioenergy, treat wastewater, and desalinate water. In an attempt to answer the question of whether this emerging technology has the ability to stand alone as an efficient replacement for RO, or it is best if used as an RO pre-treatment setup, this review addresses the recent approaches and limitations of both MDC and RO technologies in order to highlight the near-future application of MDC integration with RO operation.Ahmed ElMekawyDr Ahmed ElMekawy received his Bachelor’s degree (1996) at Alexandria University, Egypt and PhD degree (2011) at Menufiya University, Egypt.

1. Global fresh water crisis
Fresh water constitutes a very small percentage of the total water on earth, accounting for only 3% with the remaining amount in the form of saline-based water and oceans. Moreover, only 1% of fresh water is easily reachable, with the majority of it locked in snowfields and glaciers difficult to obtain due to the need for laborious efforts or lack of significant financial resources. Although desalination technologies are commonly used for producing clean water from the sea and brackish water around the world (Fig. 1), most of these technologies require significant capital and energy resources.1 Shortage of fresh water (salinity <0.5 g L−1) has become one of the major challenges for societies all over the world.1 All of these technologies still require electrical or thermal energy, with today's reverse osmosis (RO) desalination units consuming 3–5 kW h m−3.1 Therefore, developing desalination technologies sustained by renewable energy, i.e. wind and solar generated electricity, is being seriously considered.2 Alternatively, novel membrane technology is being developed for use with forward osmosis (FO) as a pre-treatment step,3 which reduces the requirement for high water pressure, and hence energy. In the next two decades, it is predicted that the average amount of fresh water per person will decrease by one-third,4 with two thirds of the world's inhabitants living under fresh water-stressed conditions.5 Water for agriculture and irrigation accounts for approximately 70% of fresh water use, and may reach 90% in some industrialized nations. Approximately 276 cross-border river basins cover the earth (25% in Europe, 23% in Africa, 22% in Asia, 17% in North America and 13% in South America). Due to the topography, weather, engineering, and other reasons, some areas have ample fresh water, while others face the prospects of drought or polluted water sources. In most of the developing countries, the desalination capability is estimated to increase from 44 × 106 to 98 × 106 m3 per day of water in 2015,6,7 with energy consumption accounting for 40% of the desalination operating cost. The leading desalination technologies presently used are distillation, RO, and electrodialysis (ED). Progress in the development of desalination processes and equipment, mainly between 1990 and 2000, rendered these technologies more reliable with diminished capital cost. However, the relatively high energy cost continues to be a major concern.8 The present review highlights the potential near-future integration of microbial desalination cells (MDCs) with RO systems, as one of the novel technologies for economic water desalination in terms of energy consumption.

2. Technological principles of MDCs and RO
The emerging bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), i.e. MDC, have been considered as promising technologies for clean water and energy production.46–55 MDC technology is a derivative of the microbial fuel cell (MFC), in which electrons are generated from the catabolism of microorganisms, which are then passed to an anode across the cell membrane.56–58 Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode, through a connected external circuit, due to the existence of a redox potential difference between anolyte and catholyte solutions,49 in which electron acceptors are reduced. Once an additional chamber is introduced, between the anode and cathode chambers (which are separated by a couple of ion exchange (IE) membranes), the desalination process may occur. In such a configuration, the MFC is transformed into the MDC mode, offering a new method for desalination. The growing bacterial cells on the anode oxidize the organic substrate and trigger electron flow, which deploys the migration of anions and cations from the middle chamber towards the anode and cathode chambers, respectively, while simultaneously producing electric current.9,11,13,27,59 The migration of ions to the middle chamber is powered by the difference in potential between the anode and cathode, in which anions (i.e. chlorine) move to the anode chamber through an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and cations (i.e. sodium) move to the cathode chamber through a cation exchange membrane (CEM).60 Hydrogen ions are consumed in the cathode chamber as they react with oxygen and electrons to form water, with the charge being equalized by the transient cations (Na+) from the desalination chamber across the CEM towards the cathode chamber. This process can reach a desalination level up to 99% while, concurrently, producing energy. That is why MDC technology could be considered a promising approach for concurrent desalination and energy generation.9,13
While MDC uses electromotive force produced by the bacteria to desalinate water, RO uses an external energy source to pressurize the salt water to be desalinated. Normally, the RO membrane is fabricated from a polymer material with a layered network structure. It permits filtration by pore flow, as positive hydrostatic pressure is applied on the fluid to be forced through the membrane. Therefore, the filtered water follows a twisted pathway across the membrane to pass to the permeate side. The fluid flow is influenced by the membrane permeability, the portion of the membrane volume containing a void gap which can hold the liquid, and the ratio between the distance travelled by the liquid across the membrane to the membrane thickness.61 While monovalent ions and the tiniest contaminants could be rejected by the RO membrane, additional nanofiltration (NF), microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes are usually utilized to block larger size contaminants.
Fluid transport across the RO membrane is controlled by a mechanism called “solution-diffusion”, in which the open channels used for pore flow are absent.62 Hydrostatic pressure, higher than the osmotic one of the solution, is required to operate the RO membrane. The positive pressure difference develops a transverse chemical concentration gradient through the membrane that pushes the liquid across the membrane in a direction opposite to the natural osmosis, i.e. the migration of water molecules from a high-concentrated area to a low-concentrated area. In the meantime, salts are rejected and concentrated on the membrane inflow surface.63 The power required to pump the water influent represents the main energy consumed by RO systems and is directly affected by the flow rate and feed pressure.37 Hydrostatic pressure up to 7 MPa is required for the high salt content of seawater. The greater the salt content, the higher the pressure required to generate a preferred permeate flux.
3. Desalination setups
The first small-scale setup of MDC was presented in 2009 by Cao et al., who used a salt water chamber with a volume of 3 mL, later increased to 1 L in a larger scale MDC created by Jacobson et al.9–11 Since then, the MDC technology has evolved on several fronts including reactor design, process, and productivity (Fig. 2A).12 In most lab-scale MDC setups, the anolyte contains a synthetic substrate solution, i.e. acetate, while the catholyte contains efficient ferricyanide or the applicable dissolved oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, and NaCl is used as a salt solution.13 Contrary to the infancy of MDC technology, RO was introduced almost 40 years ago. Remarkable advancements in fabrication and materials of RO membranes, over the last four decades, positioned RO technology as the main option for new desalination plants (Fig. 2B). Seawater distillation facilities were initially established in the 1950s, with the first application on the industrial level launched in Kuwait in the 1960s. After these initial trials, membranes started to be commercially available with the first RO facilities running brackish water feed in the late 1960s.14 Membrane materials were further improved in the following decade, to increase product permeability, and as a result, RO membranes were then used for seawater desalination.15 Nowadays, more than 15000 desalination facilities are operating around the world, with about half of them applying RO technology. Approximately half of the world's desalination capacity is located in the Middle-East, which has been the pioneer in industrial-scale seawater desalination. In 2005, two seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants were commenced by the United Arab Emirates and Israel, with production capacities of 454 × 103 and 330 × 103 m3 per day of fresh water, respectively.16,17 The key milestones along the evolution path of both MDC and RO technologies are summarized in Fig. 2. The main configurations of both MDC and RO technologies are schematized in Fig. 3 and 4, and reviewed in the following sections.

3.1. MDC configurations
The microbial electrodialysis cell (MEDC) and MDC are among the bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) developed recently for saltwater desalination at reduced energy consumption (Fig. 3). After the invention of MDC by Cao et al.,11 it has been demonstrated that 93% of used 35 g L−1 NaCl solution could be removed via the MDC, which was later successively improved by incorporating an air cathode.13 MEDC was combined with each of the MDC and microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) to reject 68% of 20 g L−1 NaCl and 99% of 10 g L−1 NaCl, respectively.18,19 Furthermore, in order to improve the desalination rate of MEDC, Chen et al.20,21 proposed the microbial electrolysis desalination and chemical-production cell (MEDCC). Results obtained from all these experiments confirmed the potential for high desalination efficiency of MDC, and its suitability for being utilized as either a stand-alone technology, or pre-treatment process for the conventional desalination technologies.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the various types of MDC configurations based on the unique features of their middle chamber. The design at the centre represents the classic three-chamber setup, with focus on the middle chamber of the other four designs. The green and red arrows indicate the increment and decrement trends of salinity removal and energy production, respectively, for different MDC types. 
The configuration of an MDC setup has improved through the use of stacked cells to enhance the effectiveness of charge transfer,22–24 or by applying up-flow tubular reactors for potential scale-up.9,10 Such stacked or up-flow MDC types were built to enhance the desalination rate.9,22,23 It was found that the desalination capabilities of the MEDCC and stacked MDC (SMDC) are around 1.4 times that of the classical three-chamber desalination reactor.20,22 Also, MDCs connected in series can remove up to 44% salinity of 60 mL synthetic seawater using only 120 mL of the anolyte.23 MEDCC is one of the multi-chamber designs used to improve the desalination rate of the MDC coupled with the production of some byproducts. This could be accomplished by assembling four chambers, in which an acid-production compartment is inserted between the anode compartment and the AEM, and equipped with a bipolar membrane (BPM), which has the ability to split water into OH− and H+, to simultaneously produce hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and desalinate saltwater.21,25,26
Several trials were conducted to recirculate the electrolyte between the cathode and the anode for the pH buffering, in order to diminish the operating cost of the catholyte buffer solution.27,28 In order to achieve this, novel strategies were followed, such as incorporating a BPM to generate alkali and acid,21,29–31 or using an external voltage to generate hydrogen gas in the cathode compartment.18,19 It was observed that the recirculation could effectively overcome large deviations in pH. However, with recirculation, the capacity of desalination was limited by the mandate to operate the MDC as a single cell in fed-batch running mode. Although continuous mode of operation has been applied to enhance the productivity of MDCs, the cathode or anode solutions were recirculated only within the same electrode compartment during previous trials.10,23 Also, the increase of the anode solution volume11 and the addition of bases or acids22 are among other options used to reduce the negative consequences of pH on electrode productivity.
Further improvement of desalination performance was attained by replacing the AEM with a FO membrane to achieve water dilution, resulting from water drawn out from wastewater, along with desalination powered by electric potential.32–34 Within the same context, low-salinized water was also treated using an MDC equipped with ion-exchange resins.35,36
3.2. RO configurations
The RO process set-up has quite a simple design comprising the feed water input, feed pre-treatment unit, high pressure pump, modules of the RO membrane and, in some configurations, post-treatment stages. The four different types of RO membrane modules that are used for desalination processes are the spiral, hollow fiber, tubular, and plate and frame modules (Fig. 4).37
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram overviewing the various types of RO membrane modules and their main features.136 
Plate-and-frame is an old RO module made up of layers of supported plane sheet membranes, with a spacer between each support and membrane in order to drive the feed through each membrane while the permeate flows outside the module (Fig. 4A).38–40 Although this type of module is fouling resistant, it has a low packing density which places a lot of demand on space requirements, making it a high cost option. Another RO desalination configuration is the tubular membrane unit, which comprises membrane tubes wrapped around punctured stainless steel cylinders (Fig. 4B). The feed runs across the tubes and the permeate flows out from the membrane and support.38,41 The tubular modules share the same advantages and disadvantages of the plate-and-frame one, and as a result they are both used mainly for extreme foul feeds. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the above types, hollow-fiber modules were invented with a large packing density, in which multiple fine hollow fiber membranes are laid in a pressure vessel, and the feed runs outside the membranes (Fig. 4C).38,39,41 While these units have high productivity per module, they are highly susceptible to fouling and thus not practical for use in some applications.
One of the most widely used modules, nowadays, is the spiral-wound one. A spiral-wound module contains plane layers of the membrane parted from each other by spacers wrapped around a punctured collection tube (Fig. 4D). The feed flows across these wrapped membrane layers while the permeate flows through the membrane to the collection tube.38,41 This type of module has a high packing density along with reasonable fouling resistance. Moreover, this is the cheapest module setup to be produced from a flat sheet thin film composite (TFC) membrane.42,43
In addition to the development of the spiral wound module several decades ago, progress in materials, manufacturing techniques, feed channels and the size of vessels and spacers has contributed to better adjustment of the internal fittings between module elements and liquid transport features, thus reducing both pressure drop shortfalls and fouling. The sales of spiral wound modules made from polyamide (PA) membranes are currently leading the RO/NF market (91%), followed by the hollow fiber modules made from asymmetric cellulose acetate (CA) membranes.44 Although the PA membrane has a high salt rejection and efficient energy consumption, the CA membrane is superior in chlorine resistance, allowing it to inhibit the growth of microorganisms by chlorine disinfection.45
4. Limitations and challenges
In spite of its advantages of lower energy and chemical consumption, and the added value of wastewater treatment, the MDC technology currently suffers from a number of limitations. One of such limitations is the inability to produce huge amounts of concentrated acid or salt solutions by the IE process, for strong or weak acid cation exchange resins, respectively. Moreover, prolonged time is typically needed for the MDC process due to the decelerated anodic biological metabolism.64 Also, competitive ions, other than those representing hardness, consume electrons and consequently reduce desalination capacity. Another key challenge with the MDC process is the gradual increase in salt concentration in the anode and cathode compartments upon the removal of these salts from the middle compartment, which leads to highly salted anolyte and catholyte.60 Nevertheless, the accumulation of these ions can be suitable for wastewater treatment as it promotes conductivity.59,65 It is worth mentioning that RO membranes suffer from the same limitation due to the accumulation of chlorine ions on the membrane (i.e. commercial PA) resulting in the degradation of the membrane.66 Power generation from complex wastewater is considerably lower than that from simple substrates, because of the low conductivity, buffer capacity and biodegradability of wastewater.59
Throughout the desalination process by MDC, ohmic resistance considerably increases as water conductivity and salinity decrease, limiting electricity production and desalination speed, particularly for low saline waters.11,13,22 The different ions existing in water influence the efficiency of MDC productivity in several ways. For instance, soluble cations, i.e. Mg2+ and Ca2+, may deposit on the surface of the membrane causing the scaling phenomenon, in which the flow of ions through the membrane is hindered and the electrical resistance of MDC is substantially amplified. In addition, a possible reaction between these ions and the natural organic matter in water may develop compressed fouling layers on the surface of an operating membrane.67,68 Furthermore, anions, i.e. SO42− and NO3−, that moved from the salt water to the anolyte, may affect the functionality of the anode as the electron accepting electrode, which eventually leads to electron loss and decreases system output.69 Additionally, the molecular size and ionic strength of various ions may differ considerably, which influence their transfer activity in salt water. It was noticed that the MDC productivity was reduced by 22% when synthetic seawater was fed into the desalination compartment to substitute pure NaCl solution.10
In the same context, membrane fouling is one of the main obstacles for an efficient (SWRO) desalination process.70 Biofouling is an important phenomenon that occurs as a result of a microbial adhesion or absorption on the surface of the membrane, developing a gluey polymeric layer of a biofilm (transparent exopolymer particles (TEP)).71 Such a polymeric biofilm is hard to regulate and eradicate, leading to a reduced flux and overall decline in productivity.70 Biofouling depends on many factors including the existence of organics and microbes in water, oxygen accessibility and temperature.72 Therefore, biofouling in membrane-based desalination techniques is very difficult to control compared to other fouling types, which could be overcome by appropriate physical or chemical procedures.
Another major challenge is the scale-up of the MDC system, where the liquid volume in the real practical applications of MDCs can range from hundreds to thousands of cubic meters.64 Regardless of the MDC configuration, i.e. tubular or stacked, the MDCs are commonly constructed out of three compartments enclosed in a reactor: salt, anode, and cathode. Altering the liquid volume or replacing any of the separate chambers, while carrying out maintenance or responding to operational problems, would require the disassembly of the whole setup. This lack of sub-modular assembly of an MDC is a real practical obstacle towards the fulfilment of the vision for large-scale MDC setups comprising several MDC modules.73 One of the concepts introduced to overcome such scale-up obstacles suggests the insertion of multiple chambers between the same electrodes. However, pH imbalance may occur between the anode and cathode compartments. A pronounced decline in anode pH below 6, as a result of the discharged protons, will hinder microbial metabolism and can limit the interval of the desalination cycle.11,18 Protons are then consumed in the cathode chamber leading to pH increase and a subsequent potential loss of 95 mV for each pH unit, which considerably reduces the reactor productivity.18,27,74–76 A similar effect of pH was also observed on the RO membrane. However, such an effect depends on the molecular size as well as ionic charge. Fluctuations in the feed pH may change the charge of the membrane surface, which may consequently influence the membrane productivity.77 On the other hand, although RO for seawater desalination has been commercially scaled-up for several decades, it still suffers from the major problem of high capital investment as well as increased operating costs, which must be reduced in order to be affordable by developing countries. Energy, chemicals and labor contribute to around 87% of the entire RO costs.78
5. Evaluation of the desalination process: MDC versus RO
5.1. Membrane efficiency
As MDC uses AEM and CEM between the desalination compartment and the anode and the cathode compartments, respectively, it is mainly considered as a membrane-reliant technique, where the features of the membrane are vital to its productivity. It was observed that the desalination performance of MDC can be improved by 50% to 63% by increasing the capacities of the IE membranes.13 Nevertheless, assessment of permanence and reliability of the membranes used in MDCs after prolonged operation is still blurry and does need more focus and research. Membrane scaling and biofouling are among the main reasons for low productivity in conventional electrodialysis desalination technologies, as they elevate the internal resistance and decrease both the permeable membrane selectivity and current.79 The AEM in MDC is more prone to biological and organic fouling compared to the CEM due to microbial attack and wastewater in the anode compartment. The extracellular production of polymeric materials by the biofilm, as an interconnected and adhesive matrix, may lead to membrane fouling.80,81 Alternatively, surface scaling of the CEM may also occur as a result of inorganic precipitations, i.e. magnesium and calcium hydroxide82 and phosphate, when ferricyanide is applied as the cathode solution.83 This was confirmed after an eight month long operation of the MDC, in which membrane biofouling on the AEM was identified as the main reason leading to degradation in performance due to associated ion transfer inhibition and enhanced internal resistance. It was also observed that the current density, desalination rate and Columbic efficiency were reduced by 47%, 27% and 46%, respectively, whereas the organic matter removal remained constant. The CEM was entirely concealed by crystalline sphere-shaped aggregates with a rough texture, while a smooth layer was noticed on the other side of the membrane fronting the middle chamber of the cell. On the other hand, sparingly crystalline flakes were distributed on the used AEM surface facing the desalination chamber.82 Moreover, the increase in anolyte acidity (i.e. pH drop from 7 to 5.4) and catholyte alkalinity (i.e. pH increase from 7 to 9.5) negatively affect the MFC performance,84 in terms of electrode potential, voltage and power density.85 Accordingly, BPM was suggested to work as a separator in the MFC in order to maintain neutral pH in the cathodic and anodic compartments.86,87
The BPM is an alternative type of electro-filtration membranes, in which a functionalized membrane composite containing interchangeable anion exchange and cation exchange layers can separate water into H+ and OH− concurrently between both layers under an electrical field.88,89 Therefore, the BPM can generate alkali and acid in situ, i.e. NaOH and H2SO4 from Na2SO4, thus considerably decreases the cost of alkali and acid.90,91 Nevertheless, neutral pH was not strictly maintained due to low water ionization efficiency of BPM.86,92 The large polarization resistance of BPM is an additional disadvantage, which could lead to a drop in the MFC voltage and power density.93
On the other hand, FO membranes could be utilized in bioreactors to recover water during wastewater treatment.94–96 The FO pressure gradient between solutions of high and low water chemical potentials is employed to power the flow of water through the semi-permeable FO membrane.3 Under such conditions, water naturally flows, without the need for hydraulic pressure, resulting in a process with less consumed energy, as compared to RO.97,98 The low tendency for membrane fouling represents an additional advantage of the FO technology,99 with an improved removal of wastewater derived impurities upon the use of wastewater as the feed solution.100 FO is less prone to fouling compared to RO due to the difference in the desalination driving force, i.e. osmotic versus hydraulic pressure, respectively.3 Alternatively, the low rate of water flux and the leakage of some solutes (e.g. NaCl) through commercial FO membranes are among the main disadvantages of the FO process.101 The FO membrane has been employed in a microbial osmotic fuel cell (MOFC) between the electrodes to recover desalinated water while generating power. Previous setups applied aeration at the cathode compartment, counterbalancing the gains in power production by its consumption for cathodic aeration.32
In contrast to electro-filtration membranes in MDC, osmotic size-exclusion filtration membranes are commonly used in RO plants. RO membranes range from cellulosic and aromatic PA to TFC membranes. Cellulosic membranes are fabricated from thin materials with dense pores in the form of hollow fibers or sheets. On the other side, aromatic PA membranes are relatively similar to cellulosics with an improved reaction towards organic substances and high durability. The TFC membranes are fabricated from a thin dense membrane with high salt rejection capability, which is then placed on the surface of a porous material.102
Based on the aforementioned discussion, the two major membrane options for MDC and RO to produce desalinated water are IE and RO membranes, respectively. Both IE and RO membranes are well developed with progressive levels of improvement. Although both membranes are pre-treated to eliminate suspended solids to circumvent fouling, the IE membrane is more resistant to suspended solids.103 Also, membranes are exposed to scaling by the feed water hardness, which needs either to be softened, as a part of the feed solution pre-treatment process, or to be eliminated by the utilization of anti-scaling chemicals. However, both membranes could suffer from fouling by organic materials present in the feed solution. Nevertheless, IE membranes could be easily cleaned, compared to RO membranes.104 Other than its main utilization in the desalination process, IE is also employed as a post-treatment method for eliminating boron in some desalination factories. Commonly, the exclusion of boron with RO is achieved at pH 9. At this pH, boron has a partial negative charge and the rejection efficiency can reach 90% with SWRO. However, further RO processing of the first permeate is required, i.e. by a complete or partial dual pass scheme, in order to obtain less than the target 0.5 mg L−1 boron concentration in the permeate, and the pH, in this case, needs to be adjusted before the second pass. Post treatment with the IE membrane could be a good replacement for this process.105 The same process could be also applied to selectively eliminate several heavy metals, e.g. arsenic, after the RO process. Although the IE membrane has innate characteristics that render its performance effective at eliminating ions with lower molecular weights from a feed solution, it is not efficient in removing immobile high molecular weight or non-charged ionic components. This could be a drawback when fresh water is generated from a feed solution with heavy suspended solids or microorganisms. In such cases, pre-treatment is required before the desalination process.106
5.2. Desalination capacity
Desalination in the various three-chamber configurations of MDCs may exceed 90% from the initial concentration107 of 30–35 g L−1 of NaCl solution, which is the typical concentration of seawater (Table 1). Unfortunately, a high desalination rate requires a huge volume of fresh water, for the anolyte as well as the catholyte, accounting for 55 to 133 times the capacity of desalinated water.12

The desalination capacity of MDCs can be improved by loading several membrane pairs between the cathode and anode.13,18,19,22,23,27,33,59 However, in previous versions of SMDC, as that demonstrated by Chen et al.22 in which they introduced dual cell pairs between the air cathode and anode, the desalination productivity was reduced due to the internal resistance developed by wide desalination compartments (∼1 cm). Kim and Logan suggested some novel approaches to overcome complications related to SMDCs, including the use of the seawater catholyte to exclude chemical buffers, the integration of an effective water flow setup across the stack and the decrease of ohmic resistance by minimizing the thickness of the utilized stack. Accordingly, a novel flow setup was evaluated, where the dilute and concentrated solutions ran in series inside each desalination cell in the stacked setup, which led to an improved desalination rate and efficiency.23 Another reported problem with SMDCs is the migration of the diluted water to the concentrate as a result of osmosis. This phenomenon can be diminished by decreasing the hydraulic retention time or the membrane area. In this context, a reliable method to improve the desalination performance is to connect seawater flows to several MDCs in series, rather than adding multiple stacks in a single MDC unit.23
Furthermore, the use of SMDCs may decrease the requirement for huge volumes of salt-free electrolytes. Desalination efficiencies up to 98% may be obtained from the NaCl feed with 35 g L−1 employing five cell pairs of SMDCs. In such a configuration, the ratio between the consumed anolyte to the resulting desalinated water was 13:1.23. Luo et al.18 achieved desalination efficiency of 99% from 10 g L−1 NaCl with the ratio of the salt-free electrolyte to desalinated water being around 14. These findings demonstrated the effect of the initial percentage of water salinity on the required volume of wastewater in MDCs.
Salt permeation is influenced by the amount of both divalent ions and total dissolved solids (TDS) in solution, as a result of reactions between the membrane surface and the ions.37 The total surface charge on the RO membrane is negative, which allows the repelling of negatively charged molecules or ions,108 and the presence of more cations in the vicinity of the membrane surface, resulting in an electric potential known as the Donnan potential phenomenon.109,110 Although this phenomenon facilitates the repelling of ions from the membrane, its influence diminishes with high divalent ions or salinity content. The extent of salt removal of a particular membrane depends on the composition of water and the strength of the membrane charge. Bartels et al.109 observed increase in salt permeation, using a number of RO membranes for brackish water, from around 0.4% to 2.6% upon an increase from 1 to 10 g L−1 NaCl.
By any standard of judgment, the MDC technology today is in its infancy in spite of the progress made over the past five years. Accordingly, it is conceivable that MDCs are only partially integrated in the existing desalination technology of seawater, rather than being considered as a replacement for RO technology. With such a mindset, one may think of MDC technology as a pre-treatment step for the RO process. Since the RO process efficiency largely depends on feed water salinity, in which salt permeation through the membrane increases proportionally with the salt concentration of the feed water, pre-treatment of the feed water with MDC will reduce its salinity and, hence, contributes to RO process efficiency.
5.3. Energy consumption
The sustainable recovery of fresh water by desalination of saltwater has considerably improved in the last century. However, the process is still challenged by high energy consumption.60 As mentioned earlier, it is expected that the global capacity of desalination will escalate to 140% in 2015 with 40% of the overall desalinated water cost115 attributed to energy consumption during the process. The focused efforts on reducing concentration polarization and fouling, along with increasing energy recovery and permeate flux, have diminished the energy usage from 12 to 3.7 kW h m−3 over the period from the 1970s to 2006, respectively.78
The developing MDC technology is considered as an energy saving, cost-effective and eco-friendly desalination method. MDC operates under neutral pH, pressure and temperature conditions,116 and utilizes the produced bioelectricity to achieve desalination. It is predicted that around 1.8 kW h of bioelectricity can be produced from MDCs from the handling of 1 m3 of wastewater.107 This emphasizes the ability of MDC technology to concurrently treat wastewater and generate energy in the form of hydrogen gas or electricity.10,11,18,23,59,82 The power densities generated by the MDC were comparable to those generated by the single chamber MFC without a desalination compartment (Table 1). The recently obtained efficiency of 86% corresponds to the splitting of 4.3 pairs of sodium and chloride ions for each electron travelling through the circuit. Studies reported an increase in H2 energy production of 180–231%, compared to the input energy, upon desalination of 5–20 g L−1 NaCl solutions.13,18 Another study estimated that liter-sized MDCs can generate up to 58% of the electrical energy required for the operation of a RO system.10 Also, the power density was enhanced by 33% by utilizing recirculated MDCs.27
6. RO and MDC: reality and prospects
The concurrent consideration of water recycling and desalination is a strategy for developing the available sources of fresh water,1 and therefore is indeed relevant for fulfilling the escalating universal demand for fresh water. Thermodynamically, the required energy to retrieve 50% of fresh water, from a 35 g L−1 TDS simulated seawater solution by RO, is 1.06 kW h m−3.117 At the maximum efficiency of SWRO configuration, an energy consumption of 1.8 kW h m−3 was reported,118 not counting the energy required for the pre-treatment of feed solution and pumping. However, this value increases to 3–4 kW h m−3 once the energy consumption of the entire system is considered.117 Such significant reduction in energy consumption is a direct result of the focused attention RO technology has attracted over the last five decades, as evident from the number of publications on this technology. Fig. 5 shows that searching ‘ScienceDirect’, using the keyword “reverse osmosis”, reveals an almost 65% growth in the total number of scientific publications over the last two decades (1995–2014). Also, the reported consumed energy by the RO process tremendously decreased over the recent years, with notable increase in flux and salt rejection. Further reduction in energy consumption for seawater desalination will require novel approaches and strategies. On the other hand, ‘ScienceDirect’ search with keywords “microbial desalination cell” returns only 32 articles published over five years (2009–2014) (Fig. 5). In addition to the obvious need for more work to understand the fundamentals of the MDC, scale-up, engineering, reliability and performance challenges are yet to be investigated at a reasonable level.

The energy required for RO decreases with the decrease in the salinity of the feed water. Accordingly, decreasing the conductivity of the salt water by 60% or more would significantly help in reducing the overall amount of energy consumed by the RO modules. This suggests that MDCs may be advantageous as a pre-treatment process for water desalination by RO. Also, the importance of MDC is magnified, due to the production of more than 82% of the total desalination volume (441 × 105 m3 day−1) from saline water (63% from seawater, 19% from brackish water and 5% from wastewater sources).7 The ability to remarkably decrease the saline content of the feed water without any external energy source may be considered a promising approach to cut-off energy expenditures for water desalination. Thus, the MDC is proposed as a preceding partial desalination step for RO.13
Recently, a configuration termed as the upflow MDC (UMDC), was proposed by Jacobson et al.10 to examine the durability of the scaled-up 2.7 L MDC. It was observed that the UMDC could generate 58% of the theoretical electrical energy required for the RO process. In a setup that uses the UMDC as a preceding desalination step for the RO process, if the UMDC removes 30% of TDS in saline water, the energy requirement for the RO process will then drop from 3.7 to 3.5 kW h m−3 due to reduced salinity. Also, the bioelectricity generated in the UMDC can additionally decrease the energy consumption to 2.9 kW h m−3, restoring about 22% of the overall energy cost of an RO system without the UMDC.
The UMDC configuration of Fig. 6 was proposed as an example of a scale-up integrated loop for efficient and economic utilization of MDC as a pre-treatment technology for RO. The integrated loop includes the initial treatment of municipal wastewater in an anaerobic reactor to produce biogas, and in the meantime using the effluent of the reactor as a fuel for the UMDC, which is used to desalinate seawater partially (70%), before it is fully processed by the RO membrane modules. However, industrial scale integration between MDC and RO systems requires innovative scale-up designs and integration schemes.

7. Concluding remarks
In spite of the prospective advantages, there are several endeavours before the real practical application of MDCs is realized. This is partly due to the increased capital investment accompanied by the bioelectrochemical technologies, as well as the low water productivity of MDCs. The MDC needs a longer retention time than the RO process, in order to obtain comparable water production, which may be balanced by the great volume of the reactor, irrespective of the high capital costs. An MDC reactor could have a complex assembly that may require more consideration on maintenance and operation,64 which includes developing an effective method to reduce or clean membrane fouling. Scaling up of MDC from the lab to an applied scale requires step-wise increments of the desalination bioreactor volume from milliliters to several liters, and then to the industrial scale cubic meters, while at the same time performing research to recognize the main limiting aspects at the larger scale. The whole desalination efficiency could be improved by installing stacks of IE membranes between the working electrodes to develop the exchange of charge per electron shuttled to the circuit, and by running the saline water across multiple MDCs, connected in series, to improve the desalination degree.22,23 The advantages of wastewater treatment in MDC must also be considered, since MDCs are a combined method of both water desalination and wastewater treatment. It is most appropriate to construct this system in a location near wastewater and saline water sources.119
To recapitulate, MDC technology has promising potential as a sustainable process for water desalination, compared to more conventional technologies of desalination, i.e. RO. MDCs could be either employed as a stand-alone technology for distributed water treatment and recycling or integrated with the traditional membrane-based RO to decrease salinity of the feed water and subsequently reduce energy requirements. The latter approach seems to be more appropriate in the near future, until the efficiency and durability problems of MDCs are fully explored.
