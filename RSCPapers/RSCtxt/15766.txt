    , Accepted 13th August 2018First published on 18th August 2018AbstractDeveloping a biocompatible nanotheranostic platform integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions is a great prospect for cancer treatment. However, it is still a great challenge to synthesize nanotheranostic agents using an ultra-facile method. In the research reported here, ultrasmall polyethylenimine-protected silver bismuth sulfide (PEI-AgBiS2) nanodots were successfully synthesized using an ultra-facile and environmentally friendly strategy (1 min only at room temperature), which could be described as a “rookie method”. PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots show good monodispersity and biocompatibility. For the first time, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were reported as a powerful and safe nanotheranostic agent for cancer treatment. PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots exhibit excellent computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) dual-modal imaging ability, which could effectively guide photothermal cancer therapy. Furthermore, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 35.2%). The photothermal therapy (PTT) results demonstrated a highly efficient tumor ablation ability. More importantly, the blood biochemistry and histology analyses verify that the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots have negligible long-term toxicity. This work highlights that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots produced using this extremely effective method are a high-performance and safe PTT agent. These findings open a new gateway for synthesizing nanotheranostic agents by using this ultra-facile method in the future.
Introduction
Cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases that threaten the survival of people throughout the world, and a large amount of people die from various kinds of cancers every year.1,2 Enormous efforts have been made by scientists to develop highly efficient cancer treatment methods in the past decades. However, traditional cancer treatment methods (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) often suffer from critical barriers, such as nonspecificity, multidrug resistance, and excessive radiation.3–5 As an emerging method for cancer treatment, near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted tremendous attention, which could effectively overcome the obstacles of conventional approaches because of its great advantages of high specificity to tumor tissue, minimal invasiveness, and minimization of side effects to the patient.6–11 NIR light is commonly considered to be a safe light source that possesses the advantages of deep penetration and little damage to healthy tissues, when compared with ultraviolet or visible light.12–16 During the PTT process, photoabsorbing agents can strongly absorb NIR light energy and convert it into local hyperthermia, leading to cancer cell death in minutes.17–19 Futhermore, a sufficient accumulation of photothermal agent at the tumor site could achieve an accurate and efficient cancer therapy without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. In addition, the simple synthesis method is also critical for future clinical applications of photothermal agents. Therefore, it is imperative to explore any PTT agent with high photothermal conversion efficiency, targetable tumor accumulation, and good biocompatibility prepared using an ultra-facile strategy.
Recently, many types of NIR-absorbing PTT agents have been explored and these include noble metal nanomaterials (e.g., palladium nanosheets, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, gold (Au) nanorods, and so on),20–22 organic dyes,23 polymer nanomaterials,24 carbon-based nanomaterials,25,26 metal oxides,27 metal sulfides,28,29 and metal selenides.30,31 Among them, tremendous progress has been made in the past years with bismuth-based metal sulfides [such as bismuth (Bi), bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) and copper bismuth sulfide (Cu3BiS3)],32–35 and these show great potential for cancer treatment in PTT because of their unique physiochemical properties. To achieve precise diagnosis and efficient therapy, multimodal image-guided anticancer theranostic strategies, which integrate diagnostic functions and therapeutic abilities into a single platform, show significant promise in cancer theranostics.36 Bismuth possesses a high K-edge value and good X-ray attenuation properties (Bi: 5.74 cm2 g−1 at 100 keV), which provides greater contrast than iodine (iodine: 1.94 cm2 g−1 at 100 keV) per unit weight.37,38 Previous reports have demonstrated that Bi containing nanomaterials have huge potential to be used as computed tomography (CT) contrast agents.39,40 It is worth noting that Bi is relatively inexpensive,41,42 which further expands its application prospects in CT imaging. Despite many achievements, the development of novel Bi-based metal sulfides is still urgently required.
Silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2) is a typical member of the I–V–VI2 ternary metal chalcogenides, which have received considerable interest because of their potential applications in linear, nonlinear, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric devices, as well as in optical recording media.43–46 Furthermore, AgBiS2 can also be used as catalytic and solar cell materials.47,48 Importantly, AgBiS2 is a non-toxic and earth-abundant material, which makes it interesting for possible future applications.49 As far as is known, there is still no report on the synthesis of AgBiS2 as nanotheranostic agent for imaging guided PTT so far.
Various methods including a solid-state reaction method,50 solvothermal method,51–55 microwave method,56–58 hot-injection method,47,48 sonochemical method,43 and polyol route59,60 have been developed for the synthesis of AgBiS2. These classic methods have been widely used, but they have some drawbacks. The traditional solid-state reaction method gave a high product yield, but the morphology of the materials was poor. The solvothermal and microwave methods are relatively simple, but the whole reaction process is difficult to control. The hot-injection method could be applied to synthesize high-quality AgBiS2. The research groups of Gerasimos Konstantatos and Changhui Ye reported excellent work using the hot-injection method,47,48 but the high temperature and strict experimental process limited their development. The sonochemical method is easy to handle, but the process consumes a great amount of energy. The polyol method has been proved to be attractive for preparing the nanomaterials. However, it often requires special high pressure. Therefore, it is important to develop simple, mild, convenient, and environmentally friendly methods to synthesize AgBiS2 nanodots that could be used for imaging guide PTT.
In this research, an ultra-facile and environmentally friendly strategy (1 min only at room temperature) was developed for synthesizing ultrasmall polyethylenimine-protected AgBiS2 (PEI-AgBiS2) nanodots, which could be described as a “rookie method”. It is worth noting that AgBiS2 nanodots were reported for the first time as a powerful nanotheranostic agent for imaging guided PTT. The CT/photoacoustic (PA) dual-modal imaging has been realized because of good X-ray attenuation ability and strong NIR absorbance of AgBiS2 nanodots, which could effectively guide the PTT for cancer treatment. More importantly, the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots prolonged blood circulation, had an effective cellular uptake, obvious tumor accumulation, and highly efficient tumor ablation ability in vivo without damaging the normal tissue upon 808 nm laser irradiation. PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots also exhibit low long-term toxicity according to the blood biochemistry and histology analyses. This work highlights that this is an extremely effective method for the synthesis of multifunctional AgBiS2 nanodots, which could be used as high-performance theranostic agents for imaging guided PTT. These findings open the way for synthesizing nanotheranostic agents by using a very simple method in the future.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots
The synthetic process for creating the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots and the applications for the dual-modal imaging guide PTT are illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis technology reported in this work is ultra-facile and robust, which is described as a “rookie method”. The as-prepared nanodots can be directly applied for bioapplications because of their good biocompatibility.61–63 A representative transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shows that the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots have a uniform spherical shape with an average diameter of about 3.02 nm (Fig. 1a and b). No uniformly shaped nanodots were observed under the same synthesis conditions without the addition of either PEI, (Bi3+ + Ag+) or thioacetamide (C2H5NS) (Fig. S1, ESI†). The clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.284 nm can be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, which corresponded to the (200) planes of the cubic AgBiS2 nanodots. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern revealed that the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were highly crystalline (Fig. S2, ESI†). X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of the cubic phase of AgBiS2 nanodots (JCPDS card no. 89-3672, Fig. S3, ESI†). The successful modification of PEI molecules on the nanodots’ surface was further confirmed using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (Fig. 1c and S4, ESI†).64,65 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the chemical states of the elements in AgBiS2 nanodots. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the survey spectrum of the synthesized nanodots confirmed the presence of Bi, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), silver (Ag) and sulfur (S) elements. Furthermore, high-resolution XPS spectra of Ag 3d, Bi 4f and S 2p were measured to identify the oxidation states of the constituent elements. The two peaks centered at 367 eV and 373 eV belong to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of the Ag+ ions, respectively, (Fig. 1d). The spectrum of Bi 4f overlapping with the S 2p is shown in Fig. 1e. The two strong peaks at 157.1 eV and 162.5 eV were attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of the Bi3+ ions, respectively. The small peaks located at 159.85 eV and 161.1 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, which is consistent with the reported values of S2−.66–68 Dynamic light scattering measurements of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots show a hydrodynamic size of 23.3 nm (Fig. 1f) with a zeta potential of +24.9 mV (25 °C). Furthermore, the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots at 37 °C and 50 °C were almost the same at 25 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†). It is worth noting that the value for hydrodynamic size was larger than that measured using TEM, which may be because of the PEI coating layer on the surface the of the nanodots. Furthermore, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots have good dispersity in various solutions, including water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), sodium chloride, and cell medium (Fig. S7, ESI†).

In vitro photothermal performance of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots
The absorption spectrum of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots shows a broad absorption (Fig. 2a). It can be observed that the absorption intensity of PEI-AgBiS2 was enhanced and there was a color change from colorless to deep brown with increasing concentrations (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Fig. S8 and S10 (ESI†) show a good linear relationship of the absorbance at 808 nm versus concentration, suggesting that the nanodots have good dispersibility both in water and PBS solution. Then, the photothermal performance of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were investigated, and the temperature of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodot solution exhibited obvious concentration-dependent and irradiation time-dependent characteristics (Fig. 2b). Notably, the temperature of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodot solution at a concentration of 200 μg mL−1 rapidly increase by about 46.7 °C, whereas the pure water temperature increased by only 4.6 °C (Fig. 2c). The photothermal response of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodot solution is shown in Fig. 2d. The temperature increase varies with the excitation power density when the concentration of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots was 200 μg mL−1 (Fig. 2e). Even at a low power density of 0.4 W cm−2, the temperature can also be increased by 14.8 °C (Fig. 2f). A rapid temperature increase indicates that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots could speedily and efficiently convert NIR energy into heat.

The detailed calculation of photothermal conversion efficiency (η) is presented in ESI,† and the τs was determined to be 184.2 s (Fig. 2g), so the η value was calculated to be 35.2%,69,70 which was higher than that of most of the reported PTT agents, such as Au nanorods (21%), silver sulfide (Ag2S) nanodots (28.7%), Bi2S3 nanorods (28.1%), Bi2S3 nanodots (21%), p-type copper sulfide (Cu9S5; 25.7%), bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) nanoscale spherical sponge (31.1%) and Cu2−xSe (22%).30,33,71–74 The high photothermal conversion efficiency is helpful for reducing the dose of PTT agents during the cancer treatment process. The photostability of the nanodots is critical for their future applications, the temperature of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots can still reach the same level after six cycles (Fig. 2h). Furthermore, the absorbance and color of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots did not change significantly under NIR laser irradiation for 60 min (Fig. S11, ESI†). Furthermore, the long-term stability of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots was also studied. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the hydrodynamic size of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots did not change significantly over time, verifying that the nanodots have good stability in both aqueous solution and PBS solution. In addition, the absorption of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots at 808 nm has only a slight decrease after 42 days, suggesting that the nanodots have good long-term stability (Fig. S13, ESI†). The infrared (IR) thermal images of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots with time are displayed in Fig. 2i. The temperature of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots increased quickly with irradiation time, but the temperature of pure water increased slowly. These results indicate that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots have great potential as PTT reagents.

In vitro and in vivo X-ray CT and PA imaging of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots
The efficient cellular uptake (Fig. S14, ESI†) and low cytotoxicity (Fig. 3a) of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots demonstrated that their safety was favorable for application in animal experiments. Because of the advantages of easy manipulation, deep tissue penetration and high resolution, X-ray CT imaging plays an important role for disease diagnosis in clinical applications.75,76 It was speculated that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots would have good CT imaging capabilities.67,77 For in vitro CT imaging, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots exhibit much better CT contrast than iobitridol at the same concentrations (Fig. 3b and c). The slope of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots curve was steeper than that of iobitridol, suggesting that the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were a highly effective CT contrast agent. The CT contrast agents with high efficiency could reduce the dose requirement during imaging, perhaps lowering potential adverse side effects in clinical applications. For in vivo CT imaging, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were firstly injected intratumorally into the tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 3d, the CT signal at the tumor site could be effectively enhanced after injection. Furthermore, the time-dependent in vivo CT imaging was studied after intravenous injection of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots. The CT signal in the tumor site gradually increased from 0 h to 24 h post-injection (Fig. S15, ESI†). The result demonstrates that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots could passively accumulate in the tumor site because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR), and confirmed the nanodots as a high performance CT contrast agent.

(i) In vitro cell viabilities of HepG2 cells incubated with various concentrations of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots with/without 808 nm NIR laser irradiation (1.2 W cm−2, 6 min). 
As an emerging and noninvasive bioimaging modality, PA imaging has superior spatial resolution and imaging depth.78 PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots could be applied for PA imaging because of its strong NIR absorbance. The in vitro PA imaging performance of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots was evaluated first. As expected, the PA signals could be observed even at a very low concentration and PA signal values were enhanced linearly with an increase in the nanodots’ concentrations (Fig. 3e), indicating the potential PA imaging ability of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots. To further assess their potential for in vivo PA imaging, tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously with PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots. As shown in Fig. 3f, the signal at the tumor site was very weak before injection. In contrast, PA signal intensity in the tumor site was enhanced remarkably over time and reached a peak signal at 24 h post injection, which was in agreement with the CT imaging result. The previous results not only suggest the effective targeting of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots to the tumor, but also prove that the nanodots could be promising PA imaging reagents.

In vivo blood circulation and biodistribution
The pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of nanodots needs to be carefully studied before they are further applied to the treatment. Fig. 3g shows the pharmacokinetics of a blood circulation curve. The fitted curve presents a classical two-compartment model with the first and second phase blood circulation half-lives at 0.104 ± 0.056 and 5.055 ± 0.960 h, respectively. The Bi in the blood samples remained at a relatively stable level even at 24 h after injection, which was beneficial for transferring the nanodots to the tumor site. After intravenous injection of nanodots in tumor-bearing mice, the in vivo biodistribution of the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3h, nanodots were accumulated in the reticuloendothelial system organs such as liver and spleen, which is a classical behavior of nanoparticles in vivo. It is well known that circulation and enrichment of nanoparticles in living animals could lead to significant uptake in the lung, so a realatively high level of Bi could be observed in the lung.79 Furthermore, the low concentration of Bi in the kidney revealed that it was likely that nanodots could partially pass through the glomerulus and be excreted via the renal pathway.80,81 The content of Bi in the tumor gradually increased within 24 h to be consistent with the in vivo CT/PA imaging results. This is likely to be because of the EPR effect and the long circulation time. Because of the stepwise clearance of nanodots from mice, the amount of Bi decreased gradually in all organs. After 14 d of injection, the Bi concentration was very low in all the organs tested, suggesting that the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots could be almost excreted completely from the mice after a prolonged time. Furthermore, after 24 h of intravenous injection of nanodots in tumor-bearing mice, the feces of mice were collected. As illustrated in Fig. S16 (ESI†), PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots maintain their original shape and size in feces, indicating that the clearance of nanodots was possibly through fecal excretion.82
Photothermal ablation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo
Prior to the use of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots for imaging guided PTT in vivo, the in vitro cytotoxicity of nanodots under 808 nm laser irradiation was first investigated. The high killing ability of nanodots to cancer cells are shown in Fig. 3i. The PTT ability of nanodots in vitro was also investigated using co-staining with calcein acetoxymethyl ester and propidium iodide on HepG2 (human liver carcinoma) cells with or without 808 nm laser exposure (Fig. S17, ESI†). Then, the photothermal ablation of cancer cells was studied in vivo. Tumor-bearing Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups: (1) PBS, (2) PBS + NIR laser, (3) PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots, (4) PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots + NIR laser. In view of the fact that the CT and PA signal of the tumor site (treated with PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots) reached the maximum at 24 h, the tumors (Groups 2 and 4) were exposed to the NIR laser after 24 h of intravenous injection, but Groups 1 and 3 were without irradiation. The whole PTT process was under the control of the IR thermal camera. The temperature of tumors (Group 4) was high enough to kill the cancer cells, but the tumors’ temperature (Group 2) were barely changed (Fig. 4a and c). The representative mouse photographs in each group are displayed in Fig. 4b. It can be observed that Group 4 mice showed a marked tumor inhibition and the tumor was completely eliminated without recurrence. In marked contrast, tumors in the other groups grew quickly and showed indistinguishable growth rates, indicating that NIR laser irradiation or PEI-AgBiS2 nanodot injection alone failed to inhibit tumor growth. Fig. 4d and g show the change of tumor volume and body weight of each group as a function of time. The tumors were excised at the end of the PTT treatment, the average weights of tumors are shown in Fig. 4e. Because of the good effects of PTT treatment in mice of Group 4 and the death of some mice in Groups 1, 2, and 3, four representative tumor photographs were selected from each group and presented in Fig. 4f. The H&E stained images confirmed that all the organs were normal after treatment (Fig. S18, ESI†), suggesting that there was no noticeable systemic toxicity from the PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots. Furthermore, H&E staining of histologic sections of tumors of all groups were performed after the PTT treatment. As displayed in Fig. 4h, the tumor from Group 4 was damaged remarkably, whereas the tumor tissues in Group 1, 2 and 3 did not show any significant damage, verifying that the effective therapeutic effect is attributed to the combination of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots and NIR laser irradiation. These encouraging results revealed that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots could be a powerful and safe PTT agent for future cancer treatments.

The long-term toxicity of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots in vivo
The potential long-term toxicity of nanomedicine is an essential concern for biomedical applications. A series of experiments were conducted in vivo, including blood biochemistry analysis, complete blood panel measurement, and histology examination. As shown in Fig. 5a–d, the serum parameters of treated mice including liver function markers [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] and kidney function indicators [uric acid (UA) and creatinine (CREA)] are consistent with those of the control groups. Furthermore, all parameters (Fig. 5e–l) of the complete blood panel analysis in mice treated with PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots at each time point after administration also showed no obvious difference when compared with untreated mice, verifying the nontoxicity of the nanodots. In addition, the main organs of mice were collected after 30 days of intravenous injection and stained with H&E, and no visible inflammation lesion or tissue damage were observed in all the major organs compared with those of untreated mice (Fig. 5m). Furthermore, no obvious abnormal behavior of treated mice were found. All the results suggested that PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots are a high performance nanotheranostic agent with negligible long-term toxicity, which hold huge potential for in vivo biomedical applications.

Animal experiments: Kunming mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Jilin University (Changchun, China). All the mice experiments were performed in compliance with the National Regulation of China for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all mice were handled under the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jilin University. To develop the tumor models, H22 cells (mouse hepatocellular carcinoma) were subcutaneously injected into the left axilla of each mouse. The mice were used for in vivo experiments when the size of the tumors reached 100 mm3.
Conclusions
In summary, ultrasmall PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots were successfully synthesized using an ultra-facile and environmentally friendly strategy (1 min only at room temperature). The method is very simple, which could be described as a “rookie method”. This paper is the first report of PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots being used as a powerful and safe nanotheranostic agent. Excellent CT and PA dual-modal imaging have been realized, which could effectively guide photothermal cancer therapy. Highly efficient tumor ablation ability in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated. Furthermore, PEI-AgBiS2 nanodots exhibit negligible long-term toxicity as shown by the blood biochemistry and histology analyses. This work may open a new avenue for synthesizing nanotheranostic agents by using an extremely simple method in the future.
