    , Accepted 8th April 2018First published on 11th April 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted intensive attention due to their outstanding photophysical properties and high performance in optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the quality of perovskite films plays an important role in the performance of perovskite devices. The use of additives has been previously suggested as the simplest and effective method to improve the quality of perovskite films. However, only the cations or anions in most additives are capable of functioning as active species in improving the quality of perovskite films. Herein, we report that ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) as an additive (contains NH4+ and SCN− ions) can significantly improve the quality of perovskite films as compared to NH4I and Pb(SCN)2 as additives containing the single active species of NH4+ and SCN−, respectively. The synergistic effect between the ions in NH4SCN is favorable for controlling the nucleation and growth speed of the crystal grains, which evidently increases the grain size and markedly improves the film stability. Finally, the efficiency of the device based on NH4SCN (16.47%) is significantly enhanced without a hysteresis effect as compared to that of the devices with single ions as the active species, e.g., NH4+ in NH4I (13.97%) and SCN− in Pb(SCN)2 (12.88%). Our findings suggest that the synergistic effect of anions and cations in additives is an effective strategy for realizing efficient and stable perovskites.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are one of the most attractive materials due to their merits of solution processability, high extinction coefficient, wide absorption range, long carrier diffusion length, and low exciton binding energy.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) unprecedentedly increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.7% in 2017 in just a few years5,6. Additionally, PCEs are able to compete with traditional commercialized polycrystalline-silicon solar cells and inorganic thin-film solar cells such as amorphous silicon, CZTS, and CdTe thin-film solar cells7–9. In particular, in recent years, perovskite solar cells have made a breakthrough in the field of lead-free perovskite and low-dimensional perovskite.10,11 Together with the advantages of simple preparation and low cost as compared to the complex processes and high cost of traditional solar cells, PSCs have great potential in future commercial applications.12
It has been demonstrated that the quality of perovskite films has a huge impact on the performance of PSCs because poor film quality often results in short-circuiting, and inferior charge dissociation and transport dissociation.13,14 Thus, improving the quality of perovskite films has become a key issue in the enhancement of the performance of PSCs. To prepare films with full coverage, no pin-holes, and smooth surfaces, many approaches such as one-step/two-step methods, solvent engineering, vacuum co-evaporation, layer-by-layer growth, and vacuum-assisted solution processing have been developed.8,15–21 Overall, these methods mainly focus on controlling the crystal growth to prevent defects in films by governing nucleation and optimizing the crystal growth kinetics in perovskite films. However, the problem that the solubility of methylammonium iodide (MAI) is higher than lead iodide (PbI2) is challenging,22 which results in faster PbI2 precipitation,23 and hence reduced film quality.24 Additives have been used as an effective method to solve this essential problem by reacting with PbI2 to retard the perovskite growth rate for large crystal formation.7,25 Therefore, various types of additives have been reported to improve perovskite film quality with respect to compactness and full coverage, such as polymers,22,23 fullerenes,26 small molecules, metal halide salt s,27 inorganic acids,28 solvents,29,30 organic halide salts,31 and nanoparticles,32 by slowing down the grain growth rate and enlarging the grain size,28 or by reacting with PbI2 to form intermediates and increase the crystallinity of perovskites. However, only cations or anions in most additives are capable of functioning as active species in improving the quality of perovskite films. Two representative examples are shown below. Si et al. incorporated NH4I additive into the precursor solution and observed the preferential formation of NH4PbI3 by NH4+ diffusion into the [PbI6]4− octahedral layer, which slowed the crystal growth and thus improved the perovskite quality with low defects.22 Tai et al. demonstrated that Pb(SCN)2 as an additive could significantly improve the stability of the device by introducing SCN− into the perovskite crystal lattice.33 However, very little theory is known about how the combination of cations and anions as active species in one additive, e.g., NH4+ and SCN−, might affect the overall quality of perovskite films and thus the device performance.
Herein, ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) is employed as an additive to form high quality perovskite films with no pinholes and large grains via the synergistic effect of NH4+ and SCN−. On one hand, the smaller NH4+ anions can easily and quickly diffuse into the octahedral crystal lattice of [PbI6]4−, forming NH4PbI3 in the early stage, which induces less defects in the perovskite film due to heterogeneous nucleation. This chemical process can slow down the rate of crystallization, leading to a high quality film. On the other hand, the pseudo-halogen anion SCN− has similar chemical properties and radius with the I− anion, which can be incorporated in the lattice structure of perovskite. The resulting perovskites exhibit a low trap density and good intrinsic stability due to the linear shape of the SCN− ions and strong coordination with Pb2+ ions. The PCEs of the device based on NH4SCN (16.47%) are significantly enhancement compared to the devices with a single ion as the active species, e.g., NH4+ in NH4I (13.97%) and SCN− in Pb(SCN)2 (12.88%). The findings suggest that the synergistic effect of anions and cations in additives is an effective strategy for realizing efficient and stable perovskites.
Experimental

All the materials and chemicals in our work were used as received without further purification, including PEDOT:PSS (Clevious PVP. AL 4083, Heraeus, 1 g mL−1), methylamine iodide (MAI, 99.5% Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd.), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%, TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd.), ammonium rhodanate (NH4SCN, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium iodide (NH4I), lead rhodanide (Pb(SCN)2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), PC61BM, lithium fluoride (LiF, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich), and chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich).
Photovoltaic device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with Hellmanex III detergent in DI water, DI water, acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, respectively, and dried in an oven overnight. Before use, the ITO substrates were cleaned with UV-O3 for 15 min and PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered with a 0.45 μm nylon filter. Then, 50 μL PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 50 s and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min in air atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 mmol PbI2 (461 mg) and 0.1 mmol (159 mg) in 1 mL DMSO and DMF mixed solvent (VDMSO:VDMF = 1:4), and stirring at 60 °C for 1 h. For additive doping, NH4SCN was added to the perovskite precursor solution at a concentration of 2% (1.52 mg), 5% (3.80 mg), 10% (7.60 mg), 13% (9.88 mg), 15% (11.40 mg), 17% (12.92 mg) and 20% (15.20 mg) (molar ratio, the proportion of all additives is mole ratio). The perovskite precursor solution was coated onto the PEDOT:PSS substrate via spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, in the second spin-coating process, 250 μL chlorobenzene (CB) was used to wash the perovskite thin film after 10 s. After the end of the spin-coating, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of 20 mg mL−1 PCBM dissolved in CB was spin-coated onto the perovskite thin films at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, 1 nm LiF and 80 nm aluminum layers were evaporated under 3 × 10−4 Pa at a rate of about 0.01 Å s−1 and 1 Å s−1, respectively.
Characterization
UV-vis absorption was measured on a Shimadzu UV-1750 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-4600 spectrofluorometer and Edinburgh FS5-TCSPC, respectively. All AFM images were obtained with a Park XE-70 with an area of 5 μm × 5 μm. Top-view SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800. XRD patterns were collected with an X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab 3 kW). The device characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G illumination using an Enlitech SS-F5-3A solar simulator, and the J–V characteristics were measured using the J–V sweep software developed by Enlitech Ltd. and a Keithley 2400 source/meter unit. Current–voltage curves were measured in the forward scan range of −0.1 to 1.1 V and the reverse scan from 1.1 to −0.1 V. For stability testing, the films and devices were placed in air with humidity of around 70%.
Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of the NH4SCN additive on film morphology, we systematically conducted top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) on the perovskite films with and without additives, as shown in Fig. 1a. The NH4I and Pb(SCN)2 additive-based films are also shown for comparison. The crystal size of the perovskite films became larger when Pb(SCN)2, NH4I, and NH4SCN additives were introduced, compared to that of the film without additive, corresponding to previous reports.22,33,34 Under the optimized conditions, the NH4SCN-based films exhibited the maximum crystal size (500 nm average) with respect to that of the Pb(SCN)2 (200 nm average) and NH4I (300 nm average) based films (Fig. 1b), demonstrating the highly effective functionality of the NH4SCN additive. These results were further confirmed by the AFM images (Fig. 1c). The SEM images of the perovskite films with different amounts of additives were collected carefully (Fig. S1, ESI†). When the concentration of NH4SCN was only 5%, the crystalline grain increased markedly. When the concentration of NH4SCN increased to 15%, the grain size achieved the maximum value; however, the grain size decreased when the concentration of NH4SCN was higher than 17%. This may be due to the excess NH4+.22 A similar grain size evaluation can be found in the NH4I-based perovskites. However, no crystal grains are observed in the 15% NH4I-based film and pinholes appeared (Fig. S1, ESI†). In contrast with the NH4SCN and NH4I additives, the 5% Pb(SCN)2 based films showed a significant change in morphology with the appearance of PbI2, consistent with a previous report.35 These results prove that the perovskite exhibited a larger grain size with the addition of the NH4SCN additive. Additionally, the results indicate that the synergistic effect of NH4+ and SCN− in the NH4SCN additive can significantly improve the film quality compared to single NH4+ or SCN− in the NH4I and Pb(SCN)2 additives, respectively.

Improved crystallinity and grain size were further revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. 2a). All the films exhibited the same (110), (220), and (330) diffractions at 14.15°, 28.39°, and 43.28°, respectively, which are the characteristic peaks of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Furthermore, the detailed XRD peak evaluation with different concentrations of NH4SCN additive proves again that the grain size and crystallinity were significantly enhanced (Fig. S2, ESI†), which corresponds to the SEM and AFM analysis. All three 5% Pb(SCN)2, 5% NH4I, and 15% NH4SCN films gave higher intensity peaks than the pure perovskite film, demonstrating the effectiveness of the additives. In addition, the full width at half height (FWHH) of the (110) diffraction peaks of the different additives was gradually reduced with the additives, again demonstrating the increased crystal grain size (Fig. S3, ESI†). With the crystallinity enhancement and grain size enlargement, the reflection can be reduced,36 which was proven by UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2b. The UV-vis spectra of the films with 0%, 5% Pb(SCN)2, 5% NH4I, and 15% NH4SCN were compared. The perovskite film with 15% NH4SCN additive exhibited the strongest absorption intensity compared to that with 5% NH4I or 5% Pb(SCN)2 additive or the pure perovskite film, which could lead to high photocurrent density. In general, defects on perovskite will reduce the device performance.13,14 In Fig. 2c, the emission properties of the films were investigated via steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The perovskite films with 15% NH4SCN additive gave the strongest the emission peak at 757 nm without typical Stokes shifts, and the narrowest half peak width. At the same time, the films with 5% NH4I or 5% Pb(SCN)2 had a stronger radiation peak and narrower half peak width than pure perovskite. All these results indicate that adding 15% NH4SCN as additive to the perovskite precursor solution can significantly improve film quality, decrease defects, and reduce the loss of nonradioactive compliance. Moreover, Fig. 2d shows the corresponding time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay spectra. By fitting the TRPL curves with biexponential decay, two time components were observed for the four perovskite films.28 Generally, the fast decay component (τ1) is attributed to surface recombination,40,41 while the long decay component (τ2) is due to recombination in the bulk.42,43 The calculated average charge carrier lifetime of the pristine film (1.566 ns) was prolonged to 9.696 ns in the 5% Pb(SCN)2-based perovskite film, 19.269 ns in the 5% NH4SCN-based perovskite film, and 30.608 ns in the 15% NH4SCN-based perovskite film, demonstrating the reduction in defects and recombination in the additive-based perovskite films.

Having demonstrated the improved crystallinity and grain size of the perovskite films with additives, we move on to the fabrication of a planar device with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 40 nm)/perovskites (with or without additive, 300 nm)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 80 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm), as shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). All three additive-based devices exhibited higher performances than the pure perovskite-based device. The best PCE of 16.47% was achieved in the 15% NH4SCN additive-based device with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) of 23.31 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 73.84%. However, the device with 5% NH4I and 5% Pb(SCN)2 additive gave PCEs of 13.97% and 12.88%, respectively (Table 1). The effect of the concentration of the NH4SCN additive on device performance is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI).† The maximum PCE of the 15% NH4SCN additive-based device is 32.18% higher than the device without additive. The optimized concentration of NH4I and Pb(SCN)2 was fixed at 5% (Fig. S5 and S6, respectively, ESI†), corresponding to the previous reports.22,33,37,38 The improvement in efficiency is mainly attributed to the improvement in current density, which can be also clearly seen in Fig. 3d. To further demonstrate the enhancement of Jsc, we fabricated electron-only and hole-only devices. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI),† the device with 15% NH4SCN additive perovskite exhibited a higher current density in both the electron-only and hole-only devices than the device without additive, indicating the improved charge transport and enhanced current density in the 15% NH4SCN additive perovskite. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement results further confirm this fact, where the 15% NH4SCN-based device showed an EQE of mostly over 80%, which is obviously higher than that for the device without additive (Fig. 3e). Moreover, the device with NH4SCN additive exhibited no hysteresis compared to the device without additive (Fig. 3d), demonstrating the reliability of the device with NH4SCN additive. This may be attributed to the fact that NH4SCN contains the NH4+ cation and SCN− anion, which could react with [PbI6]4− or Pb2+, reducing the migration of ions in perovskite and thus improving the hysteresis.38 From the J–V curves with forward and reverse scans, hysteresis-free behavior was also achieved in both devices with Pb(SCN)2 and NH4I additive (Fig. 3d), demonstrating again that the substitution of I− by SCN− suppress I− migration which reduces hysteresis. Due to the fact that very small hysteresis is very common for PSCs using PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as charge selective layers,21 we fabricated perovskite solar cells employing SnO2 and spiro-OMeTAD as charge selective layers to further demonstrate that our additives reduce hysteresis. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI),† the hysteresis effect was significantly reduced in our additive-based devices compared to the device without additive, indicating that the additives, e.g., NH4SCN, can really help reduce hysteresis. Moreover, the device stability was enhanced when 15% NH4SCN additive was used (Fig. 3f). Firstly, the NH4SCN involved perovskite film exhibited a more uniform, compact, and large crystalline grain, which reduced the grain interface between grains and led to better stability (Fig. S9, ESI†).39 Secondly, it has been reported that the perovskite lattice slightly tilts the crystal lattice with the addition of SCN− anion and the structure of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x tends to form a pseudo-orthorhombic structure.33 Thirdly, the SCN− anion interacts with CH3NH3+ by hydrogen bonds and reacts strongly with Pb2+, which greatly increases the device stability.33,37,38 The S element was confirmed by element mapping in the 15% NH4SCN-based perovskite films (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). The uniform distribution of S element can be clearly seen in the perovskite film surface, further demonstrating our hypothesis. However, the EDS peak of the S element is overlapped with that of Pb. To further prove the presence of the S element, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed and the concentration of S was determined to be 0.2496 mg mL−1, demonstrating the presence of S in the NH4SCN-based perovskite films. Moreover, the presence of SCN− was proven by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)35 (Fig. S12, ESI†). It should be noted that no peak for NH4+ was observed. Obviously, SCN− was involved in the perovskite lattice.44

A schematic diagram of the perovskite film formation process is shown in Fig. 4. The presence of the S element was proven in the perovskite films with NH4SCN additive. However, NH4+ decomposed and volatilized in the annealing process, as demonstrated in previous reports.22,38 Therefore, we propose that since the ionic radius of the NH4+ (1.43 Å) ion is less than that of the MA+ (1.80 Å) ion, NH4+ preferentially combines with PbI2 to form a perovskite intermediate phase since the formation enthalpy (ΔHf) of NH4PbI3 (−1.30 eV) is lower than that of MAPbI3 (−1.20 eV) (Table S1, ESI†), and reaction (1) took place. NH4SCN + PbI2 → NH4PbI3−xSCNx(1)
 Fig. 4  Schematic of the perovskite film formation process. 
To demonstrate the intermediate phase, NH4PbI(3−x)SCNx, in the perovskite film formation, we carefully investigated the XRD patterns of the NH4SCN-based perovskite films before and after annealing, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI).† The pristine NH4PbI3−xSCNx sample is also shown for comparison, which was fabricated from NH4SCN and PbI2 with a mole ratio of 1:1. Its XRD pattern is consistent with the previous report.45 For the XRD pattern of the NH4SCN-based perovskite before annealing, we can clearly see that some of its peaks are associated with the NH4PbI3−xSCNx sample, in addition to the characteristic peaks identified for MAPbI3, which confirms the existence of the intermediate phase NH4PbI(3−x)SCNx. Therefore, together with the FTIR observation, we confirm that MAPbI3−xSCNx was formed. After annealing treatment, it is obvious that the NH4PbI3−xSCNx phase was completely transformed to MAPbI3−xSCNx. However, the intermediate phase was unstable, and it decomposed with the gradual increase in the annealing temperature due to the evaporation of NH4+. In this case, MA+ inserted into the lattice of NH4PbI3−xSCNx to produce relatively stable perovskites, which is reaction (2): NH4PbI3−xSCNx + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3−xSCNx + NH3↑ + HI(2)
Finally, the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xSCNx was formed by evaporation of NH3 and HI.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time the synergistic effect of the anion and cation in an additive to simultaneously improve PCEs and stability. With addition of NH4SCN additive with the dual function species ions NH4+ and SCN−, large grains with uniform and smooth perovskite films were achieved. The heterogeneous nucleation and slow grain growth rate caused by the synergistic effect of the two ions are responsible for the performance enhancement. We have confidence that this synergistic effect in additives can be used to optimize perovskite crystal growth and open new avenues for the fabrication of high performance and stable PSCs.
