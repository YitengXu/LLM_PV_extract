    , Accepted 27th July 2016First published on 27th July 2016AbstractHematite (α-Fe2O3), with a bandgap suitable for absorption of the solar spectrum, is ideally suited for use as a photoanode material in photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of solar light into hydrogen fuel via water splitting. However, low hole mobility, short hole lifetime, high density of surface states, and slow kinetics for oxygen evolution at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface have limited the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes to date. Along with numerous reports on doping and nanostructuring of α-Fe2O3, increased attention has been paid to α-Fe2O3 heterostructure design for improved PEC performance. This review article provides an overview of four main approaches to rational heterostructure design: coupling α-Fe2O3 with (1) an n- or p-type semiconductor for promoting charge separation; (2) a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection; (3) a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination; (4) a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. The achievements to date demonstrate that high PEC performance may be accessed with these designs. In addition, we review time-resolved laser techniques used to probe the charge carrier dynamics of these heterostructures. Dynamic studies have provided insight into the mechanisms responsible for the improved PEC performance in these materials and helped to guide continued design of α-Fe2O3 heterostructures for further enhancement of PEC water splitting. As summarized in this review article, rational heterostructure design is a promising strategy to push forward the application of α-Fe2O3 for potential low cost and high efficiency solar hydrogen conversion. A better fundamental understanding of the charge carrier dynamics in these structures in turn helps to guide and improve the heterostructure design.

Broader context
Hematite is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar hydrogen generation via water splitting as its bandgap is well-suited for absorption of the solar spectrum. However, inherent issues like poor charge transport, extensive surface charge recombination, and slow charge transfer kinetics have limited its practical application as a PEC photoanode. For this reason, in recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on hematite heterostructures which incorporate a second material to overcome some of the inherent material limitations. This review highlights four main approaches to rational heterostructure design, including coupling hematite with: (1) an n- or p-type semiconductor for promoting charge separation, (2) a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection, (3) a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination, or (4) a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. Much improved PEC activities have been achieved with these hematite heterostructure-based photoanodes than with their single-component counterparts. Furthermore, studies of charge carrier dynamics at the heterostructure interfaces during PEC reactions provide deeper mechanistic understanding that helps to guide the rational design of future hematite heterostructures for potential low cost and high efficiency solar hydrogen conversion.

1. Introduction
A hydrogen-based zero emission energy system that harvests solar energy to produce clean hydrogen fuel via water splitting has been considered to be one of the ultimate solutions to energy shortage and environmental pollution.1–5 Since the pioneering demonstration of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by Fujishima and Honda,6 growing attention and intensive efforts have been paid to the search for semiconducting photoelectrode materials for solar water splitting.7–12 These photoelectrode materials include oxides, sulfides, (oxy)nitrides, and III–V compounds, all of which have shown promise for PEC water splitting. Important breakthroughs in photoelectrode material design have been summarized in Table 1. For practical solar hydrogen generation applications, photoelectrode materials have to satisfy a number of requirements, including bandgap and band structure suitable for solar light absorption and water redox reactions, good electrochemical and photochemical stability, nontoxicity, and affordability. Despite the successes achieved to date, there is not yet a single system that offers the combination of high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, affordability, and durability necessary for practical solar-hydrogen generation, especially with high performance and long-term stability.8,13

Given that four-electron water oxidation is the rate-limiting step in the overall water splitting reaction, the development of high-efficiency photoanodes for O2 evolution has captured extensive attention. Early studies focused on TiO2 photoanode materials for PEC water oxidation and provided systematic investigation of the intrinsic physicochemical properties and fundamental PEC mechanisms.27–37 However, due to a large bandgap of 3.0–3.2 eV, TiO2 can only absorb light in the ultraviolet (UV) region. As UV light accounts for only 4% of solar energy, the theoretical STH efficiency of TiO2 photoanodes can only reach ∼2% under solar irradiation, even when assuming 100% absorbed-photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.38–40 Similar bandgap-STH efficiency limitations apply to other wide-bandgap semiconductor photoanodes like ZnO, Ta2O5, and WO3.38–42 Thus, it is necessary to develop semiconductors with optical absorption extending into the visible light region that constitutes ∼43% of incoming solar energy.
Hematite (α-Fe2O3), which has a narrow bandgap of ∼1.9–2.2 eV and allows ∼16.0% of STH efficiency for PEC water splitting, has been considered to be one of the most promising photoanode candidates.38,39,43 Moreover, compared to other narrow bandgap semiconductors, α-Fe2O3 offers a number of additional advantages, including excellent stability in alkaline solution, earth abundance, and nontoxicity (see Table 1).43–47 However, α-Fe2O3 has extremely poor electrical conductivity, with a hole diffusion length of 2–4 nm,44 and extensive charge carrier recombination in the bulk and at the surface. Thus, it traditionally exhibits very low PEC performance. Furthermore, a high density of surface states and slow kinetics for oxygen evolution at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface have limited the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes to date and necessitated modifications for improved PEC performance. In our previous review article, we provided an overview of the synthesis, modification, and characterization of nanostructured α-Fe2O3, with an emphasis on charge carrier dynamics and PEC properties.48 However, the future success of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in PEC water splitting remains in question, as α-Fe2O3 itself can hardly achieve high enough PEC efficiency for possible practical use. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have focused on α-Fe2O3 heterostructures which incorporate a second material to promote charge separation, charge collection, and surface catalysis. Indeed, much higher PEC activities have been achieved with such α-Fe2O3 heterostructure-based photoanodes than with their single-component counterparts. In this review, starting with an introduction into the structural and optical properties of α-Fe2O3 as well as the advantages and disadvantages of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for PEC solar water splitting, the necessity for α-Fe2O3-based heterostructures for further improvement of PEC performance is critically discussed, along with examples of the most promising rationally designed architectures to date.
2. Properties of hematite
2.1 Crystal structure
Iron oxide is a naturally occurring compound which has found use in a number of applications, including catalysis, steel manufacturing, gas sensing, and optoelectronics, largely due to its widespread abundance and stability.49 It exists as amorphous Fe2O3 as well as four crystalline polymorphs (α, β, γ, and ε), the structures of which have been extensively studied and reported in detail.50 α-Fe2O3, also called hematite, is the most common naturally-occurring Fe2O3 polymorph. It crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice system of the corundum type, with O2− atoms arranged in a hexagonally close-packed lattice along the [001] direction and Fe3+ atoms occupying octahedral interstices in the (001) basal planes.51 It belongs to the space group Rc, with six formula units per unit cell, and lattice parameters of a = 5.0356 Å and c = 13.7489 Å.52 The unit cell is shown in Fig. 1. Pairs of FeO6 octahedra form Fe2O9 dimers, sharing edges inside the basal (001) plane and one face along the [001] c-axis.51 These dimers form chain-like structures along the c-axis. Notably, Fe3+ occupies only two-thirds of the available octahedral interstitial sites. As illustrated in detail in Fig. 1, due to electrostatic repulsion between the Fe3+ cations, the Fe–O bonds exist in two different lengths, the longer of which stretch to the O atoms on the shared face of the octahedral dimer.
 Fig. 1  The unit cell (left) of α-Fe2O3 shows the octahedral face-sharing Fe2O9 dimers forming chains in the c direction. A detailed view (right) of one Fe2O9 dimer shows how the electrostatic repulsion of the Fe3+ cations produce long (yellow) and short (brown) Fe–O bonds.

Among the four crystalline iron oxide polymorphs, α-Fe2O3 is one of the most stable and versatile, and can form diverse nanostructures, many of which are being developed as cost-effective materials for photocatalysis owing to their stability and favorable optical properties.
2.2 Optical properties
α-Fe2O3 exhibits transmission from orange to infrared wavelengths, manifesting in a characteristic red color, and absorption from ultraviolet to yellow wavelengths. Fig. 2 shows a typical absorption spectrum of an α-Fe2O3 film deposited on a F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering.53 The strong absorption ∼400 nm (3.1 eV) corresponds to direct transitions from below-valence band nonbonding O 2p orbitals to empty conduction band Fe3+ d orbitals, involving charge transfer. The weaker absorption ∼590 nm (2.1 eV) has been attributed to indirect transitions from valence band edge Fe3+ 3d orbitals to empty conduction band Fe3+ d orbitals.54 While it has been traditionally accepted that this absorption is weak because it involves spin-forbidden d–d transitions, theoretical and experimental studies have indicated that the valence band is strongly hybridized and may be mostly O 2p in character.55,56

Fabrication method may affect bandgap energy due to differences in crystallinity of the resultant material, with higher degree of crystallinity and less disorder generally correlated with smaller bandgap energy.57 For a given semiconductor, the absorption coefficient is dependent upon the energy of incident light, according to the following relationship: (αhν)n = B(hν − Eg)(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, B is a material-dependent constant, hν is the incident light energy, Eg is the optical bandgap energy, and the constant n = 1/2, 2 for indirect and direct transitions, respectively.57 The bandgap energy may be determined by plotting (αhν)n against hν. For α-Fe2O3, reported indirect bandgaps have ranged from ∼1.9–2.2 eV.
Because its bandgap is well-suited for absorption of the solar spectrum, α-Fe2O3 has been extensively studied as a promising material for PEC water splitting. In fact, studies have shown that it can theoretically produce a possible photocurrent density of 12 mA cm−2 under the AM 1.5 solar spectrum.47 However, other constraints have limited its success to date and this theoretical performance has not been achieved. Ultimately, a given material is only able to absorb a fraction of incident photons, dependent upon material parameters according to the following relationship: f = 1 − e−αl (neglecting reflectance)(2)where f is the fraction of real photon absorption, α is the absorption coefficient, and l is the optical path length.47 In the case of α-Fe2O3, a small absorption coefficient necessitates long optical path length (thick film) for α-Fe2O3 to absorb a substantial fraction of incident photons.
2.3 Electronic properties
The electronic properties of α-Fe2O3 including conductivity and charge carrier lifetime are of great importance to PEC performance. α-Fe2O3 has been shown to have very low conductivity on the order of 10−14–10−6 Ω−1 cm−1.58,59 Moreover, a high degree of anisotropy exists in the direction of charge carrier mobility; studies have shown that conductivity within the iron bilayers along the (001) basal plane is substantially favored (by 3–4 orders of magnitude) over mobility across basal oxygen planes in the [001] direction.60,61 This anisotropy has been classically explained by spin considerations as a migrating electron is only allowed to pair with an electron of opposite spin. However, subsequent ab initio calculations have demonstrated that anisotropy is present for both electron and hole mobilities and is largely explained by differences in electronic coupling and, to a lesser extent, reorganization energy.61 The electron transfer has been proposed to occur between neighboring Fe atoms through Fe2+/3+ valence alternation, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The extra electron is initially associated with the donor site in reactant configuration qA. After receiving adequate activation energy, the system enters through a crossing point configuration qC to a final product configuration qB where the electron has transferred to the donor atom.62 Thermal fluctuations in the crystal lattice provide the activation energy needed for this transition. Because the extra electron converts an Fe3+ atom to an Fe2+ atom, it effectively increases the ionic radius of the iron site. This induces a distortion and polarization of the local lattice that migrates with the migrating charge. The polarized local structure, termed a polaron, exhibits a higher effective mass than the free electron itself. Because of this, the electron experiences a lower mobility.

In addition to poor conductivity, the overall charge carrier decay for α-Fe2O3 is extremely fast (dominated by an ultrafast decay of less than 1 ps), as will be discussed in detail in Section 4 “Charge carrier dynamics in hematite and hematite heterostructures”. Ultimately, low carrier mobility and a high degree of charge carrier recombination manifest in the traditionally low efficiencies of α-Fe2O3 PEC photoanodes.
2.4 Surface energetics
In PEC water splitting, photogenerated charges must be efficiently separated and extracted to solution in order to participate in their respective oxidation and reduction reactions. The energetics and kinetics at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface are critical to this process. It has been established that differences in Fermi levels relative to the band edges at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface may induce band bending which serves to separate charges and drive them in opposite directions.63 However, for α-Fe2O3, low charge carrier mobilities and fast recombination have resulted in minority carrier diffusion lengths of just 2–4 nm.44 A diffusion length of 20 nm has also been calculated.64 These lengths are extremely short in comparison to light penetration depths of hundreds of nanometers. Indeed, photogenerated charge carriers may extensively recombine in the bulk before reaching the interface.65 Many reports have emerged on nanostructuring hematite photoanode materials in attempts to match the material dimensions with the short diffusion length to prevent premature recombination losses.43,66 However, even when the charge carriers reach the interface, a high density of defects (surface traps) can result in additional recombination losses, as depicted in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the faradaic rate constant for water oxidation over α-Fe2O3 is small, leading to slow oxygen evolution kinetics.64 In all, low minority carrier concentrations at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, high density of surface traps, and slow kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction have greatly restricted the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.

2.5 Modifications to hematite
In order to address some of the limitations of α-Fe2O3 for PEC applications, significant research efforts over the past decade have focused on improving the charge separation and transfer in this material, and encouraging results have been achieved. Foreign ion doping is a general and effective approach to improve the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3 by increasing electron donor density for promoted charge transfer ability.45,67,68 Nanostructures, e.g., one-dimensional nanorods, nanotubes, etc., favoring efficient charge collection have also resulted in improved α-Fe2O3-based PEC water splitting activity.45,69,70 However, both of these approaches focus on a single aspect of modification, either doping or altering the nanostructure morphology of α-Fe2O3 itself, and improvements have been limited. Alternatively, α-Fe2O3-based heterostructures may be designed by coupling α-Fe2O3 with a second n- or p-type semiconductor for promoted charge separation, a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection, a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination, or a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. These structures may be designed in a rational way by comprehensively considering the aspects and outcomes of each modification. Indeed, in recent years, significant advances in PEC water splitting performance have been achieved with α-Fe2O3-based heterostructures, as summarized in Section 3 “Hematite heterostructure design”.
When developing new PEC materials, and when employing materials in new combinations for heterostructure design, it is increasingly imperative to establish a growing understanding of the fundamental optoelectronic properties and photophysical processes governing performance in the water oxidation reaction. While electrochemical techniques such as photocurrent and impedance measurements are traditionally employed to gauge the performance of photoanode materials in PEC water splitting,44,71–75 these techniques are limited as they only monitor extraction of the photogenerated electrons travelling from the photoanode to the external circuit. In contrast, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), a technique that monitors the absorption and thereby concentration of photogenerated charge carriers over time, is unique in that it can provide insight into the fates of both photogenerated carriers, the electron and the hole. The latter is especially important in assessing the performance of PEC materials as it is the photogenerated holes that are ultimately responsible for water oxidation. As such, TAS has been employed in a number of works to investigate the recombination dynamics and thus lifetimes of both photoexcited charge carriers in α-Fe2O3 materials from thin films to nanostructures.48,76–78
Early TAS studies focused on ultrafast timescales (fs to ns)48,56,78,79 and reported very fast decay dynamics attributed to charge carrier recombination, with only a small percentage of initial photogenerated carrier absorption remaining at the end of the time window studied. Interestingly, this significant and swift recombination has proven to be largely independent of nanostructure shape. For instance, Fan et al. showed that the excited-state lifetime of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and nanorings is essentially the same.80 This conclusion was supported in an additional study by Fitzmorris et al. that investigated four α-Fe2O3 structures, including nanocubes, nanorhombohedra, nanorice, and spheroidal nanoparticles. Although the transient absorption spectral profiles varied among the structures, the extracted charge carrier lifetimes were very similar for all shapes studied.81 Along with nanostructure modification, foreign ion doping has been shown to increase PEC performance,45,67,68,73,82 but the ultrafast dynamics of doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have been found to be largely unchanged from their pristine counterparts.83–85 For these studies, it is believed that the improved PEC performance is attributed to increased conductivity, which improves the collection of separated electrons and holes, and not to any increase in exciton lifetime. Thus, from the TAS perspective, it is again clear that nanostructuring and doping alone are not enough to significantly alter the charge carrier recombination dynamics in α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials. Indeed, alternative approaches like creation of α-Fe2O3 heterostructures are warranted for continued efforts toward improved PEC performance.
Furthermore, TAS investigation of ultrafast carrier dynamics has enabled deeper understanding of the α-Fe2O3 band structure. Although analysis of TAS signals in these materials is often hindered by the convoluted α-Fe2O3 bandgap, one benefit of TAS is that it can easily be combined with other methods, like electrochemistry, to provide complementary information.76 It is thus becoming standard to subject the films to an applied bias during TAS measurement, which mimics the environment of a working α-Fe2O3 photoanode PEC cell.71,86–88 It is also becoming standard to probe out to the ms to s timescale,76,86–88 a time frame more suited to relevant PEC kinetics.89 Indeed, the short-lived carriers which recombine on the ultrafast ps to ns timescale are not likely to be involved in the relatively slow water oxidation reaction. These application-mindful data collection parameters have enabled assignment of spectral signals to photogenerated charge carriers of α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials, information which is not only fundamentally important but also may be used to direct rational heterostructure design for continued PEC enhancement. These findings will be discussed in Section 4 “Charge carrier dynamics in hematite and hematite heterostructures”.
3. Hematite heterostructure design
Other approaches have also been developed to address the limitations of α-Fe2O3, e.g., modification of its structure at the nanoscale.45–47 In particular, forming nanoscaled heterostructures is attractive as it allows band structure engineering to manipulate surface/interface charge transfer/separation and thereby enhance surface water redox reactions.90 In this review, four routes to forming α-Fe2O3-based heterostructures are discussed: (1) semiconducting α-Fe2O3 heterojunctions for promoted charge separation, (2) α-Fe2O3 nanostructures on textured conductive substrates for improved charge collection, (3) surface- and interface-passivated α-Fe2O3 nanostructures for reduced surface/interface charge recombination, and (4) surface catalyzed α-Fe2O3 nanostructures for accelerated water oxidation reaction kinetics. The limitations and proposed modifications are shown in Fig. 5. Related progress and achievements will be reviewed successively in the following sections.

3.1 Semiconducting hematite heterojunctions
Semiconducting heterojunctions formed by coupling a semiconducting light absorber with a second semiconductor are frequently constructed in order to improve the light absorption and/or charge separation abilities of the original material. This strategy has been widely applied to α-Fe2O3-based PEC photoanode materials.90 As shown in Fig. 6, a variety of energy band diagrams has been proposed for these semiconducting heterojunctions with α-Fe2O3 as either the underlayer or the overlayer. In either case, the charge transfer processes are heavily dependent upon the band alignment between α-Fe2O3 and the second semiconductor. Thus, the band structure of the second semiconductor must be taken into consideration during heterostructure design. Additionally, given that the second semiconductor could be either n-type or p-type, the band bending at the interfaces of semiconductor/substrate, semiconductor/semiconductor, and semiconductor/electrolyte is worthy of additional consideration for interfacial charge transfer in the designed heterojunctions. In this section, the important achievements in some typical α-Fe2O3-based semiconducting heterojunctions (see Table 2) will be reviewed from the viewpoints of promoted charge transfer and separation as well as enhanced optical absorption.

As a typical semiconducting heterostructure system, WO3/α-Fe2O3 films with designed architectures have been investigated by many groups as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.91–93 For example, Luo et al. prepared a heterostructure of WO3/α-Fe2O3 on FTO substrate by a sol–gel method and found its PEC performance to be much higher than that of WO3 or α-Fe2O3 alone, attributed to effective separation of electrons and holes in WO3/α-Fe2O3.94 Sivula et al. demonstrated a host–guest concept using a nanostructured WO3 scaffold to support a thin layer of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.95 They observed a 20% increase in photocurrent for the WO3/α-Fe2O3 host/guest photoanodes as compared to α-Fe2O3 alone, which was attributed to a greater fraction of light absorbed closer to the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface. Boudoire et al. cast a nanometer-sized α-Fe2O3 overlayer onto WO3 microspheroid arrays, by which a significant contribution of α-Fe2O3 to the photocurrent was recorded, due to the junction formed with WO3 and light trapping effects.96 An α-Fe2O3/WO3 core/shell heterostructure array was designed by Kronawitter et al. to combine the functionality of the constituent phases and enable efficient PEC water splitting.78 The performance enhancement could be associated with increased optical absorption, efficient charge separation across heterojunctions, faster kinetics, and unique interfacial electronic structures.
As another example, after forming an ultrathin (few nm) α-Fe2O3 layer on ZnO nanowire arrays, the resulting ZnO@α-Fe2O3 core/shell nanoelectrode showed an excellent PEC response to water oxidation, with IPCE reaching ∼20% at 400 nm at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and also benefited from a negative shift of onset potential because of an n/n heterojunction structure.97 Dhanasekaran et al. reported a γ′-Fe4N/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite showing water splitting photocatalytic activity many times higher than γ′-Fe4N.98 It was suggested that the proximity of the valence band potential of the constituent components promoted the preferential transfer/entrapment of photoexcited holes, and the defect/impurity-induced inter-bandgap energy states assisted the intercomponent hole transfer, which enables better utilization of electrons. Hou et al. designed a novel heterojunction array of α-Fe2O3/Gr/BiV1−xMoxO4 (Gr: graphene) core/shell nanorods for PEC water splitting.99 The improved PEC properties of this Gr-mediated core/shell heterojunction benefited from enhanced light absorption and improved separation of photogenerated carriers at the α-Fe2O3 nanorod/Gr/BiV1−xMoxO4 interfaces with Gr behaving as an electron conductor.
Similarly, Si has also been used in α-Fe2O3 heterostructure design. Mayer et al. fabricated a Si/α-Fe2O3 dual-absorber system by depositing an α-Fe2O3 overlayer on Si nanowires in a conformal fashion. Compared with pristine α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes, those with Si nanowires exhibited greatly enhanced PEC water splitting performance, with a photocurrent onset potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE as one of the lowest achieved for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The PEC improvement was believed to be due to the combination of improved light absorption and forward charge flow in the formed “Z scheme” (Fig. 7a and b).100 In such a Si/α-Fe2O3 core/shell nanowire heterojunction, Qi et al. found that the energy band edge positions of the n-Si were closely related to the thickness of the α-Fe2O3 shell. The α-Fe2O3 shell with optimized thickness positioned the energy bands of the n-Si at relatively high levels and maximized the charge collection in α-Fe2O3, thereby achieving low photocurrent onset potential and high photocurrent.101 Furthermore, after being decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles, the Si/α-Fe2O3 system showed solar water splitting efficiency enhancement up to 6.0%, with no external bias and integrated photovoltaic devices. This is because the Si/α-Fe2O3 core/shell nanowire array configuration integrates the advantages of enhanced light absorption and rapid carrier collection, as well as enhanced visible light absorption in the near-surface region of the α-Fe2O3 shell due to the plasmonic Au nanoparticles and shortened distance required for the photogenerated holes to reach the electrolyte.102 Later, Ramadurgam et al. introduced Al, an excellent alternative plasmonic material, into the Si/α-Fe2O3 core/shell nanowire to increase optical absorption and minimize charge recombination. By tuning the thickness of the Al shell, the Si/Al/Fe2O3 core–multishell nanowire was found to reach an ideal photocurrent density of ∼11.81 mA cm−2 which corresponded to a STH efficiency of 14.5% (Fig. 7c and d).103

Likewise, heterostructures formed between α-Fe2O3 and ferrites with narrow bandgaps have been found to exhibit much higher PEC water splitting activities than their single component counterparts. For instance, ZnFe2O4/α-Fe2O3 heterojunctions have exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent responses compared to the bare α-Fe2O3 electrode, because the Type II band alignment enables efficient separation of electron–hole pairs at the α-Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4 interface and/or ZnFe2O4 acts as a catalyst to accelerate the surface water oxidation reaction.104–106 Spinel MgFe2O4 with moderate bandgap (2.0 eV) and suitable bandedge positions was demonstrated to match well in energy levels with α-Fe2O3 in a three-dimensional, branched, co-doped α-Fe2O3/MgFe2O4 heterojunction.107 In this heterostructure system, the excellent charge transfer, enhanced light-harvesting ability, and large contact area were crucial for enhanced PEC activity. Recently, Ahmed et al. created a p-CaFe2O4/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction for use in PEC water splitting, showing 100% higher photocurrent response than that obtained using a bare α-Fe2O3 electrode. The improvement was attributed to enhanced charge carrier separation and reduced resistance of the charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface (Fig. 8a).108

Reprinted with permission from ref. 109, copyright (2012) American Chemical Society. 
Finally, a thin p-type Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 layer deposited on n-type α-Fe2O3 was found to create a built-in field by forming a p–n homojunction, which could drive charge separation and produce additional photovoltage for PEC water splitting.109 As shown in Fig. 8b, a nominal 200 mV cathodic shift in turn-on voltage was measured, providing one of the lowest turn-on voltage values for α-Fe2O3 synthesized by vapor phase chemistry, comparable to those measured using water oxidation catalysts. Li et al. and Rajendran et al. successively fabricated a p–n junction photoanode by depositing p-type NiO nanoparticles on the n-type α-Fe2O3 nanostructured film. This system showed greatly enhanced PEC performances and reduced overpotential for water oxidation, which was attributed to enhanced charge separation in the p–n junction as well as the water oxidation electrocatalysis effect of NiO nanoparticles.110,111 Similarly, Zhang et al. rationally designed a p–n junction based on a NiO–ZnO nanowires@α-Fe2O3 sandwich structure for solar water splitting. The achieved enhancement in PEC performance was ascribed to the p–n junction efficiently preventing electron–hole recombination.112 Increased PEC activity was also observed for the p–n heterojunction of Cu2O/Ti:Fe2O3 (Ti-doped α-Fe2O3) when compared to the single material counterpart. This was attributed to efficient charge separation at the Cu2O/Ti:Fe2O3 interface and enhanced light absorption by both semiconductors.113
3.2 Hematite nanostructures on textured conductive substrates
When used as a photoanode, the photoinduced electrons in α-Fe2O3 are collected by a surface-flat transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass and transported to a counter cathode.70,114 To increase the charge carrier collection efficiency, an effective strategy is to modify α-Fe2O3 with conductive scaffolds (or textured conductive substrates) to facilitate charge carrier transport. These conductive scaffolds mainly include nanotextured TCO, nanocarbon materials, and a few other unique conductive nanostructures, which will be discussed. Representative α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with textured conductive substrates and their associated properties are listed in Table 3.

The wide bandgap semiconductor SnO2 is a good conductor, especially after being doped with F, In, or Sb. As such, it is frequently used as a conductive substrate for charge transport and collection.115–117 Han et al. introduced a photoanode architecture composed of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as light absorbers and a SnO2 nanostructured film, with a large surface area and open channels, as a scaffold.118 This α-Fe2O3–SnO2 nanostructured architecture showed a reasonable increase in photocurrent density compared with the flat photoanode architecture, due to improved charge collection properties; the larger surface area allowed a greater portion of the photogenerated holes to transfer to the electrode/electrolyte interface. FTO and In-doped SnO2 (ITO) have been widely used as conductive substrates for photoelectrode deposition.7,119–122 However, these flat substrates have relatively small surface area for photon absorption and charge transfer, which limits their PEC performances. Yang et al. successfully demonstrated an ITO@α-Fe2O3 core–shell nanowire array electrode with nearly twice the performance as that of α-Fe2O3 on planar ITO substrates. This improvement was attributed to more efficient charge collection and greater loading of α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals in the core–shell structure.123 By patterning the FTO substrate in three dimensions for α-Fe2O3 deposition, the resultant α-Fe2O3 photoanode photocurrent density increased by 1.7 times over that of α-Fe2O3 on flat FTO, due to light scattering and rapid transfer of excited electrons.120 Wang et al. proposed a photon management strategy to eliminate the trade-off between optical absorption and carrier collection, with an ITO nanocone layer for electron collection and α-Fe2O3 conformal deposition.121 In the designed ITO/α-Fe2O3 nanocone photoanodes, nearly total above-bandgap solar absorption can be achieved, corresponding to a photocurrent density of 12.5 mA cm−2 under assumed AM 1.5 solar light irradiation. Riha et al. used the ITO inverse opal frameworks as scaffolds for fabrication of large area α-Fe2O3 structures for PEC water oxidation.122 The frameworks offered high transparency to visible light, robust conductivity, and spatially-distributed electron collection from ultrathin α-Fe2O3 coatings, resulting in a 3-fold increase in the efficiency of water oxidation compared to an optimized flat electrode.
Given the superior conductivity of Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO), well-designed ATO nanostructures (Fig. 9a–c), including nanoparticles,124,125 nanorods,126 nanobelts,127 and macroporous structures128–131 have been frequently utilized as conductive scaffolds. Without exception, α-Fe2O3 films with these conductive ATO substrates exhibited greatly improved PEC water oxidation compared to α-Fe2O3 grown on flat conductive substrates. The improvement should be related to enhanced charge separation and charge injection efficiencies and/or increased light absorption from trapped photons within the structure. Similarly, Stefik et al. reported the first 3D porous Nb-doped SnO2 (NTO) electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) that were subsequently coated with α-Fe2O3 for PEC water splitting (Fig. 9d).132 Upon illumination, this host–guest architecture with optical absorption decoupled from charge transfer showed a significant photocurrent plateau of 2.26 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V vs. RHE, whereas the control samples had very small photocurrent. Likewise, Lin et al. designed an α-Fe2O3-based heterostructure containing vertically aligned transparent AZO (Al-doped ZnO) conductive nanotubes serving as charge transporters with the advantage of minimum or no competition in light absorption, which was expected to result in reduced charge recombination and increased PEC water splitting activity.133

Certain carbon-based nanomaterials can also be used as charge conductors to improve α-Fe2O3 PEC or photocatalytic activities. For example, the photocatalytic activity of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was greatly enhanced after coupling with carbon quantum dots (CQDs) or graphene (Gr), because these materials facilitate photogenerated electron transfer and separation from holes.134,135 Rai et al. reported α-Fe2O3 photoanodes modified with Gr nanoplates (GNP) as conducting scaffolds for PEC water splitting, with a STH efficiency of 1.8%.136 The enhanced photoresponse for composite α-Fe2O3–GNP thin films was mainly attributed to efficient charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte junction and a red shift in optical absorption, as compared to the pristine α-Fe2O3 sample. Graphene oxide (GO) with controlled degree of oxidation was used by Zhang et al. to modify α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, resulting in considerably better PEC performance than α-Fe2O3 nanorods.137 The improvement was attributed to efficient hole transfer and injection into water speeding up oxygen evolution. As good hole collectors and transporters in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes,138 reduced GO (rGO) nanosheets have also been shown to extract the photogenerated electrons from α-Fe2O3 to rGO, suppressing charge recombination and enhancing photocatalytic and PEC activities toward oxygen evolution.139–141 In other studies, the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into either pristine or Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films resulted in better absorption in the visible region as well as improved charge transfer and retarded charge recombination, leading to enhanced PEC properties.142,143 A composite conducting scaffold of Gr–CNT was also used to modify α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for efficient charge transfer from the α-Fe2O3 particles to the FTO substrate.144 A photocurrent increase of 530% compared to the bare α-Fe2O3 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved for this α-Fe2O3/Gr–CNT photoanode and attributed to synergistic effects induced by the formation of a 3D-like conducting architecture of 1D CNT and 2D Gr.
Several other unique conductive substrates with rationally-engineered architectures have displayed efficient charge collection as well as light trapping. For example, Qiu et al. designed a novel PEC device structure comprising an ultrathin α-Fe2O3 film deposited on a three-dimensional nanophotonic structure of conductive Al nanospikes (Fig. 10a). In this fashion, the nanophotonic structure provides substantially improved light absorption, increased electrode surface area, and increased carrier collection efficiency for efficient PEC water splitting.145 Finally, Lin et al. introduced TiSi2 nanonets serving a dual role as a structural support and an efficient charge collector, which allowed for a record-high photocurrent of 2.7 mA cm−2 and IPCE of 46% at λ = 400 nm obtained on undoped α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 10b). This design provided a dedicated charge transport pathway, alleviating the reliance on the intrinsically poor charge diffusion in α-Fe2O3.146

3.3 Surface- and interface-passivated hematite nanostructures
It has been determined that the water oxidation reaction at the surface of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes (the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface) involves hole transfer through surface states rather than the valence band.75,147,148 Consequently, hole accumulation at these surface states is vital for water oxidation whereas charge carrier recombination at the surface states is the main limiting factor to PEC performance.48,149 An effective approach to improve charge separation at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface is to introduce a surface passivation layer in order to reduce the surface trapping states.66 Additionally, for electron collection at the counter electrode, photoinduced electrons in α-Fe2O3 are required to transfer through the substrate/α-Fe2O3 interface (e.g., the FTO/α-Fe2O3 interface), however, an increased electron–hole recombination rate at the substrate/α-Fe2O3 interface induced by the formation of the dead layer would account for the poor PEC activities reported.150 Thus, the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte and substrate/α-Fe2O3 interfaces (i.e., the α-Fe2O3 surface and undersurface), through which charge carriers (electrons and holes) travel for charge collection and surface water redox reaction, must be effectively passivated to eliminate these negative effects. Effective passivation would promote charge transfer and reduce charge recombination, enabling high efficiency PEC water splitting. Representative surface- and interface-passivated α-Fe2O3 nanostructures are listed in Table 4.

Some wide bandgap metal oxides have stood out as surface-passivation layers, effectively reducing surface states of α-Fe2O3. A very thin ZnO overlayer deposited on the surface of an α-Fe2O3 film was found to increase the photocurrent by more than 40% and reduce the onset potential by 170 mV, as compared to untreated α-Fe2O3. This improvement resulted from the altered flat band potential and reduced surface defects.151 Likewise, it was reported that an ultrathin ALD-grown TiO2 overlayer on the α-Fe2O3 surface contributed to an obvious improvement in PEC water oxidation performance by cathodically shifting the turn-on potential up to 100 mV (Fig. 11a),152 with photocurrent density reaching 2.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under solar light.153,154 With electrocatalytic or bulk doping effects ruled out, this PEC improvement was attributed to better charge separation, less surface charge recombination, and hence greater photovoltage induced by the TiO2 overlayer. A greater cathodic shift of 190 mV in turn-on potential was achieved over α-Fe2O3 photoanodes with surface passivated by a TiO2 overlayer via a water-based solution method.155 The surface states of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes could also be passivated by coating with a thin α-Fe2O3 shell layer.156 As proposed in Fig. 11b, in such core–shell α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, the majority of holes transfer through the valence band rather than the surface states, leading to reduced charge recombination and hence enhanced PEC performance.

Similarly, a thin group 13 oxide (Al2O3, Ga2O3, or In2O3) overlayer was suggested to effectively passivate surface states and reduce the kinetics of surface charge recombination for solar water oxidation with photoanodes.157,158 The coating of nanostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanodes with a very thin (0.1 to 2 nm) Al2O3 overlayer by ALD resulted in a significant decrease in the overpotential, due to the passivation of surface trapping states eliminating surface charge recombination (Fig. 12).159,160 A first-principles study also found a decrease of 0.13 V in overpotential for water oxidation over α-Fe2O3 partially covered with Al2O3, due to the passivation of surface defects,161 which was in good agreement with the experimental results.159 It was further confirmed that an Al2O3, Ga2O3, or In2O3 engineered overlayer created by facile chemical bath deposition can improve the onset potential of PEC water oxidation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.158 These corundum-type overlayers were expected to release lattice strain of the ultrathin α-Fe2O3 layer, reducing the surface state density. In particular, a Ga2O3 overlayer exhibited an enhanced photocurrent for water splitting near the onset potential that was cathodically shifted by up to 200 mV. As revealed by transient absorption studies under applied bias, such cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset, accompanied by a similar cathodic shift of the appearance of long-lived photoholes, was due to slower electron/hole recombination and primarily attributed to enhanced electron depletion in α-Fe2O3.88 Surface doping to create a doped overlayer has been evidenced as an alternative approach to effectively passivate the surface states of α-Fe2O3, leading to enhanced PEC performances.162–164 It has been demonstrated that surface-engineered α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with metal ion doping (e.g., Ni3+/4+, Al3+, Sn4+, etc.) exhibited considerably increased photocurrent densities and/or cathodically shifted onset potentials, compared to pristine α-Fe2O3 film photoanodes. The reason for the PEC performance improvement for these surface-doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructures was surface passivation through the formation of a very thin doped α-Fe2O3 overlayer that reduces electron–hole recombination at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface and increases the charge injection efficiency.

To alleviate electron–hole recombination at the substrate/α-Fe2O3 interface, the interface passivation strategy to mitigate the dead layer effect has been implemented primarily by modifying the transparent conductive substrate (e.g., FTO) with metal oxide underlayers. For instance, by introducing a thin insulating SiO2 underlayer by pretreating the FTO substrate with tetraethoxysilicate (TEOS) for α-Fe2O3 film deposition, a much higher photocurrent could be achieved.72 This PEC enhancement was attributed to the thin insulating layer improving energy level alignment at the FTO/α-Fe2O3 interface and thereby improving interfacial charge transfer.165 Formal et al. further investigated in detail the beneficial effects of the SiOx monolayer formed on FTO substrates, which increased the α-Fe2O3 crystallinity by changing the nucleation and growth mechanism and also reduced the density of surface trap states. To date, this structure demonstrated the best reported PEC water splitting performance for ultrathin α-Fe2O3 films.166 In a similar study, Hisatomi et al. reported that the photocurrent onset potential for ultrathin α-Fe2O3 photoanodes could be improved by ALD-depositing a 2 nm thick Ga2O3 underlayer on the conductive substrates. The function of the Ga2O3 underlayer was to improve the crystallinity and uniformity of ultrathin α-Fe2O3 films as an isostructural (corundum-type) template.167 They also demonstrated that Nb2O5 and TiO2 underlayers could effectively boost the photoconversion efficiency of ultrathin α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes. Importantly, a 2.0 nm thick Nb2O5 or a 1.0 nm thick TiO2 underlayer deposited by ALD provided much higher photocurrents than the conventional SiOx underlayer and better stability than the amphoteric Ga2O3 underlayer that is subject to corrosion.168 Unlike the beneficial roles of SiOx and Ga2O3 underlayers enabling conformal nucleation of α-Fe2O3 on the substrates, the Nb2O5 or TiO2 underlayer was intended to suppress back electron injection and charge recombination near the α-Fe2O3/substrate interface. Similarly, a solution-deposited TiO2 underlayer on a conductive substrate was also reported to significantly enhance the PEC water splitting performance of α-Fe2O3 thin film photoanodes by functioning as an intermediary to alleviate the dead layer effect and suppress the back transfer of electrons from FTO to the α-Fe2O3 film.169,170 A mesoporous α-Fe2O3 electrode with a thin α-Fe2O3 underlayer was recently demonstrated to exhibit a four-fold improvement in photoactivity over the α-Fe2O3 porous film. This improvement was attributed to greater selectivity of the interfaces toward both electron collection at the back contact and hole transfer to the electrolyte.171 Zandi et al. systematically investigated the effects of different metal oxide underlayers, including Ga2O3, Nb2O5, ITO, and WO3, on the PEC water oxidation performance of ALD-deposited α-Fe2O3 thin films. It was found that the underlayers increased the film crystallinity compared to that of α-Fe2O3 deposited on bare FTO, resulting in improved hole mobility and hence higher charge collection efficiency; particularly, a dramatic enhancement in water oxidation activity was achieved with a Ga2O3 underlayer for the thinnest α-Fe2O3 films (Fig. 13).150

Steier et al. designed a new α-Fe2O3 thin film photoanode by combining Nb2O5 and/or SiOx underlayers with a Ga2O3 overlayer. This heterostructure reached an onset potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE without any water oxidation catalyst, while maintaining a high photocurrent plateau.172 In this design, both the Nb2O5 and the SiOx underlayers generated an increase in electron density in the α-Fe2O3 film, in addition to influencing film growth and suppressing electron–hole recombination at the FTO/α-Fe2O3 interface, contributing to an increase in the photocurrent plateaus. The favorable shift in photocurrent onset potential in the presence of a Ga2O3 overlayer could be explained by the negative shift of the energetic position of trap states together with the passivation of surface states, enabling a greater photovoltage from α-Fe2O3.
3.4 Surface-catalyzed hematite nanostructures
Surface-functionalized catalysis can improve water photo-oxidation reaction kinetics by reducing the water oxidation overpotential required by metal oxide photoanodes.173–176 As its PEC efficiency is limited by sluggish four-electron water oxidation kinetics, α-Fe2O3 has been frequently integrated with electrocatalysts to reduce the required overpotential and ultimately enhance PEC water splitting performance.177 Different electrocatalysts have been decorated onto the surface of α-Fe2O3 by various methods for efficient PEC water splitting, as listed in Table 5.

Several water oxidation electrocatalysts have been developed to modify the α-Fe2O3 photoanode surface. For example, IrO2 may serve as a water oxidation electrocatalyst178–180 and has been found to significantly increase the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, generating a photocurrent density larger than 3 mA cm−2 with bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light.74 It was reasoned that IrO2 has a lower kinetic barrier for interfacial charge transfer, thereby lowering the overpotential required for water oxidation. An electrodeposited IrOx layer, serving as a highly capacitive layer, was further reported to catalyze water oxidation by enhancing charge separation and storing photogenerated holes in α-Fe2O3. This gave rise to a cathodic shift of 300 mV at 0.2 mA cm−2 photocurrent density.181 Later, Li et al. demonstrated that a heterogeneous multilayer of IrOx, photoelectrodeposited from a Ir molecular precatalyst, could readily shift the onset potential by as much as 250 mV for stable PEC water oxidation over α-Fe2O3, even in acidic conditions.182 Similarly, Warwick et al. functionalized α-Fe2O3 with oxidized Pt species, yielding greatly enhanced photocurrent density for water splitting, mainly because of improved charge transfer and retarded carrier recombination, related to the presence of Pt(IV) species.183 RuO2 was also reported as a good oxygen evolution catalyst for PEC water splitting, reducing the onset potential of the α-Fe2O3 film by 120 mV but not increasing the limiting photocurrent density.184 Likewise, Chen et al. and Fan et al. presented a new type of photoanode featuring the combination of molecular Ru catalysts and α-Fe2O3, achieving a remarkable increase in photocurrent (up to 2-fold) over pristine α-Fe2O3.185,186 In this assembly, the semiconductor/molecule interface was not only efficient for light-induced charge separation but also highly catalytic toward the water oxidation reaction. Zhang et al. used Rh(OH)x as the oxygen evolution catalyst to modify α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, which resulted in a significant decrease in the overpotential required for water oxidation due to efficient hole transfer from α-Fe2O3 to Rh(OH)x.187
As alternatives to noble metal (e.g., Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt)-based electrocatalysts, some earth-abundant element (e.g., Ni, Co)-containing oxides and derivatives were developed to catalyze the water oxidation reaction at α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. For example, p-type NiO combined with an α-Fe2O3 photoanode not only promoted charge separation by creating a p–n junction but also efficiently catalyzed the water oxidation reaction, leading to reduced overpotential and increased PEC performance.110,111 Ni(OH)2, hydrothermally- or ALD-deposited, was reported to result in a considerable reduction of the photocurrent onset potential for water oxidation and a two-fold improvement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was effective for both undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.188,189 A mechanistic investigation on the catalytic effects of Ni(OH)2 revealed that the catalytic process proceeded with sequential oxidation of Ni2+ → Ni3+ → Ni4+, while the slow formation of Ni4+ as the active catalytic species for water oxidation limited the catalytic effect of the Ni(II) catalyst.190 Interestingly, Bora et al. developed a NiO/α-Ni(OH)2-modified α-Fe2O3 photoanode that exhibited the dual functionality of water splitting and charge storage.191 It was noted that water splitting as a dark reaction was parasitic to the electric charge storage process during PEC operation. Importantly, Fe3+ in the active layer of NiO/α-Ni(OH)2 counterparts helped in both the catalysis of oxygen evolution and the charging process. Loading conjugated Ni(OH)2/IrO2 cocatalyst on the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 electrode could also facilitate water oxidation and negatively shift the onset potential by about 200 mV, attributed to a synergistic effect between Ni(OH)2 and IrO2, where Ni(OH)2 worked as a hole storage layer and IrO2 served as both the catalyst driving the stored holes to water and as the protector against oxidization of Ni(OH)2.192 Amorphous NiOOH, photoelectrodeposited on α-Fe2O3 in a 1–2 nm thick layer could effectively serve as an electrocatalyst, reducing the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface and resulting in a 50% increase in photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a 150 mV cathodic shift in the current onset potential.193 By coupling FeNiOOH with a Pt-modified α-Fe2O3 photoanode, an even greater cathodic shift of the onset potential (up to 190 mV) was achieved, with a high photocurrent of 2.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, due to improved oxygen evolution kinetics.194 Du et al. demonstrated that NiFeOx decoration by the photochemical metal–organic deposition method induced an increased photovoltage and then a significant cathodic shift in α-Fe2O3-based PEC water splitting reactions, owing to the minimized surface Fermi level pinning effect.195 A comparative study on the electrocatalytic activities of NiFe binary oxides prepared from different precursors showed that the electrocatalyst deposited from the Ni(II)Fe(III) precursor rather than the Ni(II)Fe(II) precursors could significantly improve the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by reducing the water oxidation overpotential.196 By doping Ni into the near-surface region of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, a ∼280% enhancement of the photoconversion efficiency was observed for Ni-doped α-Fe2O3 as compared to the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanotube film. The resultant NixFe2−xO3 overlayer could effectively promote the migration of photogenerated charges to the surface (Fig. 14), accelerating surface oxygen evolution and avoiding the recombination of low-energy photoexcited holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface.164 Recently, Youn et al. developed a NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/rGO composite for water oxidation electrocatalyst by a simple solvothermal method, with synergistic effect between active NiFe LDH nanoplates and rGO layers possessing high electrical conductivity and large surface area; the photocurrent of the NiFe LDH/rGO modified α-Fe2O3 photoanode more than doubled with negatively shifted onset potential.197 A novel water oxidation catalyst of Ni(II)–borate complexes (Ni–Bi) operating at modest overpotential was first prepared by Dincă et al. using an electrodeposition method198 and then found to cathodically shift the onset potential of the photocurrent, giving rise to a 9.5-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density achieved with the Ni–Bi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode at 0.86 V vs. RHE as compared to the parent α-Fe2O3 photoanode.199

Co-based oxides and derivatives, similar to other low-cost water oxidation catalysts, have been applied to various photoanodes for efficient PEC water splitting.200–203 For instance, by modifying the α-Fe2O3 surface with a catalytic Co2+ monolayer, surface charge recombination may be suppressed, leading to greatly improved hole transfer efficiency204 and an 80 mV cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential.72 Additionally, it was reported that Co3O4 nanoparticles could be activated for water splitting with size controlled under 5 nm.205,206 Through in situ hydrothermal growth or drop casting, Co3O4 nanoparticles were successfully deposited onto α-Fe2O3 nanorod and mesoporous photoanodes. A striking photocurrent increase and a considerable cathodic shift in onset potential were demonstrated, due to the efficient charge transfer from α-Fe2O3 to Co3O4, significantly increasing the lifetime of the photogenerated holes.207,208 It should be noted that Co(OH)2 alone did not show any electrocatalytic effect on PEC water splitting over α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.72 However, when combined with Co3O4, the ALD-deposited Co(OH)2/Co3O4 ultrathin layer significantly enhanced the PEC water oxidation performance.209 The observed 100–200 mV cathodic shift in the photocurrent onset potential was correlated to a significant reduction in the resistance for charge transfer at the α-Fe2O3/H2O interface. ZnCo LDH was also shown to effectively catalyze water oxidation over α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, by reducing electron–hole recombination at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface and enhancing hole transfer, ultimately giving rise to a 36% improvement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE.210 Additionally, CoF3 was used by Hu et al. to modify Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes to negatively shift the flat-band potential, allowing unbiased reduction of water to hydrogen by photogenerated electrons.211 A unique modification of an α-Fe2O3 photoanode with perfluorinated Co-phthalocyanine (CoFPc) by strong binding associated with hydrophobic interaction was demonstrated by Joya et al. and showed a significant onset shift and high stability for PEC water oxidation reaction. The great PEC improvement of the CoFPc/α-Fe2O3 photoanode was attributed to enhanced hole transfer from α-Fe2O3 to CoPc inhibiting charge recombination.212
Cobalt–phosphate complexes (Co–Pi), the “superstars” of water oxidation catalysis originally developed by Kanan et al.,213 have been coupled with various photoanodes for effective PEC water splitting.214–217 Zhang et al. demonstrated that Co–Pi modification could reduce the bias voltage required by α-Fe2O3 for PEC water oxidation by >350 mV, as Co–Pi excelled at trapping photoinduced holes for water oxidation (Fig. 15).218 Further investigation identified the kinetic bottleneck limiting the performance of Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes, which could be largely overcome by more sparse or thinner electrodeposition of Co–Pi onto α-Fe2O3.219 Although Co–Pi may be deposited by various methods and has been shown to enhance photoanodic water oxidation,214,220,221 the enhancement has been shown to be greatly dependent on deposition method and layer thickness.219 For instance, Zhang et al. demonstrated that photo-assisted electrodeposition provided a more uniform distribution of Co–Pi on α-Fe2O3 than that obtained by electrodeposition, yielding higher photocurrent density and greater cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential.222 It was further revealed by Klahr et al. that the kinetic bottleneck occurred for thick Co–Pi layers electrodeposited on α-Fe2O3219 and could be eliminated by photo-assisted electrodeposition.223 They found that, relative to the ALD-coated Co–Pi layer, the thicker Co–Pi layer prepared by photo-assisted electrodeposition could even produce increased water oxidation efficiencies, due to the superior charge separation and increased surface area of the porous catalytic layer. Recently, Carroll et al. revealed that, contrary to expectations, Co–Pi deposition on α-Fe2O3 actually slowed the water oxidation kinetics. Interestingly, the charge recombination slowed to an even greater extent, providing a net enhancement of PEC water-oxidation efficiency. It is therefore important to optimize Co–Pi thickness for charge recombination to compete against the slower water oxidation kinetics for the lowest photocurrent onset potential.224 By photo-assisted electrodeposition of Co–Pi on Pt-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, Kim et al. obtained a stable, record-breaking performance of 4.32 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated 1-sun irradiation.15 This photocurrent corresponded to ∼34% of the theoretical STH efficiency limit expected for α-Fe2O3 with a band gap of 2.1 eV.

Several other metal oxides have been used as effective water oxidation catalysts to promote PEC performances for water splitting over α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. For instance, Yu et al. decorated α-Fe2O3 with FeOOH by photoelectrodeposition, leading to a 140 mV decrease in the applied potential required to drive PEC water oxidation as well as a great increase in photocurrent density.225 This can be mainly ascribed to the high electrocatalytic activity of FeOOH, which increased the amount of photogenerated holes involved in the water oxidation reaction and accelerated the kinetics of water splitting. Similarly, Shen et al. created an AgxFe2−xO3 overlayer along α-Fe2O3 nanorods by surface doping of Ag ions, and revealed that the Ag-doped overlayer not only increased the carrier density in the near-surface region but also accelerated the surface oxidation reaction kinetics (Fig. 16), synergistically contributing to the improved PEC performances.226 Nanosized MnOx was evidenced as an effective catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation, proving to increase charge-transfer kinetics.227,228 Interestingly, when applied to α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, MnOx modification exhibited a significant anodic shift in onset potential but greatly suppressed photocurrent, due to a substantial reduction in photovoltage originating from the significant Fermi-level pinning effect induced by MnOx.229 Thus, it is important to balance photovoltage generation and charge-transfer enhancement with the band-edge pinning maintained for catalyst-decorated PEC water splitting.66 MoSx, another efficient electrocatalyst, was used by Ahn et al. to modify Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, successfully addressing the electron–hole transfer problem of α-Fe2O3 and achieving a 240% increased photocurrent density (3.03 mA cm−2) over pristine α-Fe2O3 at 1.5 V vs. RHE.230

4. Charge carrier dynamics in hematite and hematite heterostructures
As mentioned, many limitations α-Fe2O3 faces in use as a PEC photoanode arise from the electronic structure of the material. α-Fe2O3 suffers from a high density of mid bandgap trap states arising from closely-spaced d levels that result in optical transitions spanning the visible and into the near-ultraviolet regions. This leads to low carrier mobilities and short hole lifetimes.44 TAS has been employed as a useful tool to directly probe charge carrier dynamics to help gain deeper insight into the mechanisms of photogenerated electron–hole recombination and their relation to PEC performance.
TAS is commonly performed in a pump–probe configuration, where the pump pulse used to photoexcite the material is followed by a probe pulse used to interrogate the charge carriers after a given time delay. Excitation with a pulse energy in excess of the bandgap (λ < 620 nm in the case of α-Fe2O3) generates an exciton comprising a promoted conduction band (CB) electron and corresponding valence band (VB) hole. The absorption, and thereby concentration, of both charge carriers are monitored over time from visible to near infrared (NIR) probe wavelengths. In this way, TAS directly measures the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Before discussing charge carrier dynamics of α-Fe2O3 heterostructures, an understanding of charge carrier dynamics in α-Fe2O3 itself is necessary.
Several TAS studies of α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials have reported significant and fast electron–hole recombination occurring on the ultrafast timescale.65,76,83,84 A representative, three-dimensional TAS difference absorption (dA) spectrum for α-Fe2O3 nanostructured films is shown in Fig. 17.83 The spectrum reveals a dA feature centered ∼580 nm with a slight tail extending into the NIR. The ultrafast recombination of charge carriers is apparent as the majority of the dA signal decays within a few ps across the spectral range probed. To extract charge carrier lifetime, the signal decay is usually fit to a double or triple exponential decay function. A variety of nanostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials have exhibited ultrafast decays with time constants <1 ps and <100 ps,65,81–83 attributed to relaxation of hot electrons to the CB edge and their subsequent recombination with holes and trap states, respectively.77 These time constants are similar to those found for bulk α-Fe2O3,77 confirming that the ultrafast recombination characteristic of these nanostructures is intrinsic to the α-Fe2O3 material itself. This is also the case for doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructures,83,84 as seen for the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 film in Fig. 17b. Thus, significant electron–hole recombination occurs on the picosecond timescale for bulk, nanostructured, and doped α-Fe2O3 materials alike. Furthermore, the decays are found to be independent of pump power, with little to no dependence upon probe wavelength.65 Although the fate of the majority of charge carriers in α-Fe2O3 is ultrafast recombination, it should be noted that for nanostructured α-Fe2O3 an appreciable fraction persists and is subject to a slower decay. These trapped carriers lie below the bandgap with absorption usually centered ∼580 nm. This can be observed in Fig. 17, where ∼25% of the initial signal at 580 nm is still present 1000 ps after excitation. Signal extrapolation during fitting procedures estimates that this persistent offset is governed by a time constant >1000 ps83,84 and is attributed to trapped electrons relaxing to the ground state.77

To investigate this long-lived signal, several recent studies have probed out to the μs to ms time scale, a time frame that not only spans the complete charge carrier decay but also is more suited to the relatively slow water oxidation kinetics.89 In fact, the presence of long-lived charge carriers has been shown to be strongly correlated with PEC enhancement, as discussed in the sections to follow. Additionally, since an external bias is typically required for solar water splitting with α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, the incorporation of other methods, like electrochemistry, during TAS measurement has been pursued to more closely mimic the environment of a working PEC cell.88 Because the CB band edge of α-Fe2O3 lies below the proton reduction potential,71 a positive bias is applied in order to increase the energy of cathode electrons to allow proton reduction. It has also been shown that the applied bias partially depletes the electrons in the α-Fe2O3 photoanode film, which serves to increase the lifetime of the photogenerated holes as less electrons are available for recombination.88 The use of applied bias during TAS data collection has emerged as a way to study the material under working conditions and has also enabled assignment of spectral signals to photogenerated charge carriers of α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials, as discussed in Section 4.1.
4.1 Incorporation of applied bias, hole scavengers, and spectral assignment of charge carriers
The Durrant group performed a thorough TA investigation of nanoporous α-Fe2O3 films on the μs to s timescale as a function of hole scavengers and applied bias.86 As shown in the inset of Fig. 18a, the TA spectrum is consistent with previous works, showing a strong absorption peak at 580 nm and a tail extending into the NIR. In contrast to what is observed for TiO2 photoanodes,231 the presence of hole scavengers alone do not alter the recombination dynamics of α-Fe2O3 films; the transient decays of the α-Fe2O3 film in common hole scavenging solutions like methanol and iodide are unchanged from that of the film in an Ar environment. For these various solvent environments, the TA signal probed at 580 nm undergoes nearly identical electron–hole recombination, the charge carriers completely recombining within ∼100 ms. Under an applied potential of +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (equivalent to ∼+1.35 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), however, the lifetime of charge carriers is greatly increased, with TA signal extending well beyond 2 s for the 580 nm probe, as shown in Fig. 18c (black curve). Not surprisingly, the application of this bias also corresponds to increased photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 18b. The applied bias decreases electron density in the photoanode, allowing preservation of charge separation. As such, longer-lived holes may reach the surface and be involved in water oxidation. Because this extended lifetime is then reduced in the presence of a methanol hole scavenger in Fig. 18c (red curve), the TAS long-lived absorption signal at 580 nm was assigned to surface-active holes. Also, it was confirmed that a positive bias is necessary to generate the long-lived holes necessary for α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials to oxidize water (Fig. 18b). Without this bias, the holes simply do not live long enough to oxidize their chemical environments. However, it should be noted that even under applied bias, the vast majority of charge carriers are still prone to ultrafast electron–hole recombination, evident from the relative amplitude of the long-lived holes as compared to the initial signal. The assignment of photogenerated hole absorption at 580 nm and correlation of long-lived holes with photocurrent generation has been supported in subsequent works.76,87

The total charge carrier recombination in nanostructured α-Fe2O3 is considered to be bimolecular as it involves both electron and hole densities. The fast decay phase, similar to that of bulk α-Fe2O3, is attributed to electron–hole recombination while the slow decay phase is attributed to long-lived, surface-active holes which have not so immediately recombined with electrons and are available for water oxidation. Furthermore, the charge carrier dynamics are strongly dependent upon applied potential.
Using a similar spectroelectrochemical approach, the Lian group was also able to assign spectral features to photoexcited charge carriers by examining α-Fe2O3 under water oxidation conditions over large spectral and temporal ranges, probing visible to mid-infrared wavelengths on the fs to ms timescale.76 Although absorbed-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency increased as applied bias was increased from 0.90 to 1.43 V vs. RHE, the charge carrier recombination decay profiles were independent of applied potential for time delays up to 6 μs. This led the Lian group to conclude that holes with lifetimes in excess of 6 μs direct the catalytic activity of the α-Fe2O3 photoelectrode. As more than 98% of charge carriers decayed within 6 μs, this work echoed the finding that the vast majority of charge carriers are prone to ultrafast recombination while a very small fraction of long-lived holes are responsible for PEC activity.
With the spectral assignment of photogenerated α-Fe2O3 charge carriers as a basis, TAS has been used to investigate the charge carrier dynamics of α-Fe2O3 heterostructures in all four aforementioned categories, examples of which will be discussed herein.
4.2 TAS investigations of hematite heterostructures
The effect of semiconducting α-Fe2O3 heterojunction formation on charge carrier dynamics has been investigated using TAS. For the previously mentioned α-Fe2O3/WO3 core/shell heterostructure designed by Kronawitter et al.,78 TAS investigation revealed that the ultrafast component of the transient decay is independent of surface modification. However, at longer timescales, the absorption signal ∼579 nm decays at a faster rate upon creation of the α-Fe2O3/WO3 interface. Based on previous work by the Durrant group, it was proposed that the faster decay of the signal at ∼579 nm corresponds to faster removal of surface-trapped holes from the probed α-Fe2O3 system. It should be noted that the accelerated decay upon interface creation was only present for probe energies near the bandgap of the material; probe pulse of lower energy did not show accelerated decay. Overall, it was found that creation of the α-Fe2O3/WO3 interface encouraged removal of surface-trapped holes on the ps timescale. In this way, the interface promoted charge separation for improved α-Fe2O3 photoanode performance.
In the case of conductive substrate heterostructures, rGO, an electron acceptor, has been expected to serve as a pathway for charge carrier transport due to its high electron mobility.232 To gather the first direct experimental evidence of this proposed pathway, Meng et al. used TAS in combination with the closely related time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to analyze charge transport in α-Fe2O3/rGO composites.139 Based on the increase in relative transmission, a measurement proportional to the number of photogenerated charge carriers, the authors concluded that electrons were indeed being transferred from α-Fe2O3 to rGO. Additional analysis with infrared probe wavelengths sensitive to GO and OH resonances confirmed that the composite retains the electronic structure of bare rGO. Thus, any difference in recombination was confidently attributed to charge transfer, as opposed to any structural alteration, upon interface formation. Ultimately, TAS investigation of charge carrier dynamics provided an understanding of the mechanism behind graphene-enhanced PEC water oxidation. It was determined that photoexcited electrons transfer from α-Fe2O3 to rGO where they are subsequently trapped, leading to reduced charge recombination and longer lived holes available for water oxidation, as depicted in Fig. 19.

To investigate charge carrier dynamics in surface-modified α-Fe2O3 heterostructures, the Durrant group performed a spectroelectric TAS investigation of α-Fe2O3 before and after surface treatment with CoOx and Ga2O3,88 overlayers known to exhibit surface passivation and catalytic properties, respectively. Although it was previously shown that creation of these overlayers could indeed enhance PEC performance,233 the mechanism behind the enhancement remained elusive. In this study, the CoOx surface treatment itself resulted in a significant increase in the lifetime of photogenerated holes (by three orders of magnitude) but Ga2O3 surface treatment resulted in no appreciable change. In the case of CoOx, the enhanced carrier lifetime was attributed to depletion of electron density in α-Fe2O3 upon overlayer addition. The CoOx overlayer was said to produce an oxidizing environment, depleting α-Fe2O3 electrons. The Ga2O3 layer, on the other hand, is not redox active and was thus unable to have the same effect. The application of applied bias furthered the understanding of the charge carriers in these systems.
As seen in Fig. 20, creation of the oxide overlayers cathodically shifts the photocurrent onset to lower applied potential. Interestingly, although the overlayers resulted in different recombination kinetics in absence of applied bias, they had a similar effect on the charge carrier dynamics of α-Fe2O3 when a potential was applied. This was attributed to surface passivation of trap states serving as recombination centers. Passivation leads to increased electron depletion within α-Fe2O3 under a given applied bias, manifesting as a cathodic shift in the photocurrent onset. This shift was correlated with a similar cathodic shift in TAS signal in the case of each overlayer. As the dA signal probed arises from long-lived photogenerated holes, this phenomenon was attributed to slower electron–hole recombination kinetics due to electron depletion in the α-Fe2O3 photoanode upon overlayer addition. In this way, the reason for the decrease in applied potential necessary for photocurrent generation upon overlayer addition was revealed. When a positive potential was applied, enhanced depletion of electrons in the photoelectrode decreased the number of electrons available for recombination with holes, ultimately reducing losses due to recombination and increasing both dA signal from photogenerated holes and photocurrent density for a given potential. Surface treatments are thus important considerations in heterostructure design as they allow passivation of surface traps and/or electron depletion of the photoanode material, both contributing to longer-lived holes and thus higher photocurrent densities.

5. Summary and perspective
In this article, we have reviewed recent progress on α-Fe2O3-based heterostructures as promising photoanodes for solar water splitting. As an indirect semiconductor, α-Fe2O3 is a weak light absorber. Thick films are required for sufficient absorption of incident light, especially at longer wavelengths. However, thick samples will impair charge carrier collection due to the short transport length of photoexcited holes in α-Fe2O3. Thus, pristine α-Fe2O3 generally faces several limitations as a photoanode, including poor charge transfer and separation ability, accumulation of photoinduced holes at surface states, and slow water oxidation kinetics. The use of rationally designed heterostructures has emerged as a promising route to overcome these limitations.
More specifically, we covered four types of heterostructures that have shown striking improvement in PEC water splitting performance. First, forming heterojunctions at the nanoscale by coupling α-Fe2O3 to a second semiconductor has been evidenced as an effective way to engineer band structure for enhanced optical absorption and promoted charge separation. Second, depositing α-Fe2O3 on nanotextured conducting substrates enables photoexcited charge carriers to be efficiently collected and transported to the external circuit. Third, modifying the surface and/or interface with passivation layers has been shown to reduce charge recombination at surface trapping states. Finally, decorating the surface with water oxidation catalysts accelerates water oxidation kinetics. All these recent studies have demonstrated that α-Fe2O3 with rational heterostructure design could be a promising photoelectrode material for applications in solar hydrogen conversion. In addition, understanding the charge carrier dynamics at the various heterostructure interfaces provides important guidance to the design and improvement of the intricate architecture of the heterostructures.
Despite the significant improvements achieved with α-Fe2O3 heterostructures for PEC water splitting, the highest STH efficiencies (Tables 2–5) are still far from the theoretical value of 15.3%. Substantial improvements in both photocurrent densities and onset potentials are needed for α-Fe2O3 to become a viable photoanode for practical water oxidation applications. It is clear that a single and isolated modification approach is far from enough to meet the rigorous demands of high efficiency PEC water oxidation. We suggest that combining different modification strategies (e.g., coupling of doping and heterostructure design, or coupling of substrate texturing, surface passivation and catalyzation, etc.) may help to generate strong synergistic effects for further improvement. Meanwhile, computational screening together with combinatorial experimental verification is required for successful and fast identification of novel, durable, and low cost electrocatalysts with high activities for catalyzing water oxidation over α-Fe2O3. Given the low photovoltage of α-Fe2O3 as a photoanode, further consideration should be given to PEC tandem cells for bias-unassisted solar water splitting by combing n-type α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for oxygen evolution with p-type photocathodes for hydrogen evolution. Until now, limited success has been achieved over such α-Fe2O3-based PEC tandem cells.234 To be competitive with the simple and brute “photovoltaic + electrolyzer” solar water splitting strategy, band structure match between the α-Fe2O3 photoanode and the selected p-type photocathode is essential for PEC tandem cells to approach the theoretical STH value of ∼16% for bias-unassisted solar water splitting.235
Moving forward, another possible approach to enhanced PEC performance is to design α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with surface-textured conductive substrates for improving light harvesting as well as efficient charge collection.8 To this end, surface texturing techniques enabling efficient light management should be developed. Theoretical simulation methods of profile-dependent light absorption could help to guide the surface texturing and overall nanostructure design. In addition, engineering of electronic band structure and surface/interface for efficient charge carrier separation and transport should be exploited. For instance, chemical doping can be an effective method for altering the electronic structure and improving the electric conductivity for charge transport in α-Fe2O3.67,68 Theoretical calculations as well as novel in situ electrical conductivity measurements and ex situ/in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies could provide important new insights into the mechanistic aspects of such doped α-Fe2O3 systems. For the α-Fe2O3 heterostructure photoanodes emphasized in this review article, the heterostructure interfaces are found to possess emergent functionalities including charge transfer, electron collection, and hole-involved surface catalysis. Understanding the substrate/semiconductor, semiconductor/semiconductor, and semiconductor/electrocatalyst interfaces is important for optimizing the interfacial charge transfer processes and thus the PEC water oxidation performance. It is especially desirable to obtain an understanding of which process controls the rate of transfer of holes from α-Fe2O3 to water.
A detailed mechanistic understanding of the α-Fe2O3-based water oxidation to oxygen is arguably key to attaining major improvement in PEC performances. Systematic investigations into the PEC reaction, from light absorption and photon excitation to charge carrier transport and surface catalysis, are necessary to reach this goal. To gain a better understanding of the fundamental properties of α-Fe2O3 and its heterostructures, TAS has been used to probe charge carrier dynamics. When coupled with electrochemical investigations, TAS has allowed spectral assignment of photogenerated charge carriers and long-lived holes have been shown to be correlated with improved PEC performance. Strategies to increase the yield of these long-lived holes through heterostructure design should be aimed at increasing the extraction of electrons or slowing the recombination of electron and hole by improved charge separation or electron depletion in α-Fe2O3 itself. The determination of charge transport and recombination dynamics has helped to reveal the mechanism behind PEC water oxidation enhancement in many of these composite structures. This mechanistic understanding may guide rational design of future α-Fe2O3 heterostructures for more efficient photoanode materials. Moreover, it is important to realize that even when efficient water oxidation by α-Fe2O3 heterostructures becomes possible, this is only the first step toward implementation of α-Fe2O3 in PEC water splitting. Cost-effective fabrication processes such as inkjet printing and sol–gel processing must also be developed for large-scale fabrication of α-Fe2O3 heterostructures.

Hematite is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar hydrogen generation via water splitting as its bandgap is well-suited for absorption of the solar spectrum. However, inherent issues like poor charge transport, extensive surface charge recombination, and slow charge transfer kinetics have limited its practical application as a PEC photoanode. For this reason, in recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on hematite heterostructures which incorporate a second material to overcome some of the inherent material limitations. This review highlights four main approaches to rational heterostructure design, including coupling hematite with: (1) an n- or p-type semiconductor for promoting charge separation, (2) a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection, (3) a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination, or (4) a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. Much improved PEC activities have been achieved with these hematite heterostructure-based photoanodes than with their single-component counterparts. Furthermore, studies of charge carrier dynamics at the heterostructure interfaces during PEC reactions provide deeper mechanistic understanding that helps to guide the rational design of future hematite heterostructures for potential low cost and high efficiency solar hydrogen conversion.

Reprinted with permission from ref. 152, copyright (2014) American Chemical Society. (b) In a core–shell α-Fe2O3 photoanode, the majority of the hole transfer process occurred through the valence band rather than the surface states, as induced by passivating the α-Fe2O3 core with an α-Fe2O3 shell layer leading to better charge transfer and hence superior PEC properties.
