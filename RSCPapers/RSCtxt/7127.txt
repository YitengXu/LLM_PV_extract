    , Accepted 14th February 2022First published on 14th February 2022AbstractFluorination is a common strategy for improving the electronic properties of π-conjugated materials. This has shown to be important for applications in organic electronics, especially for the fabrication of organic field-effect transistors or organic photovoltaics. Despite being an efficient tool to generate high-performing materials, fluorination of conjugated materials and its effect on thermal transitions and mechanical properties are not fully understood. Evaluated through multiple techniques, this work investigates the glass transition temperatures and mechanical properties of a series of differentially fluorinated and/or alkylated benzothiadiazole-based polymers. In addition to the evaluation of these properties, their electronic properties under strain were measured through the fabrication of organic field-effect transistors. The crack onset strains of the prepared polymers ranged from as low as 10% for the polymer containing only a fluorinated backbone to as high as 30% elongation for the polymer containing an alkoxy appended backbone. Ultimately, fluorination embrittles conjugated polymer thin films, whereas alkylation softens them. Furthermore, the crack onset strains, and electronic properties of the synthesized polymers have an inversely proportional relationship; similarly, the electronic properties under strain increase with decreasing elastic moduli. These results show the importance of molecular design on the mechanical properties of conjugated polymers and in the development of stretchable conjugated polymer semiconductors.
1. Introduction
Electronic devices are increasingly being incorporated into more complex topographies and shapes that require tolerance to multiple types of strain.1 This is particularly critical for bio-related applications where the human skin can be used as a soft substrate.2 To achieve “mechanical invisibility,” where electronic devices can be integrated seamlessly and unobtrusively with the human body, new materials that are not only stretchable, but also as soft as the human skin need to be designed and prepared.3 There are many ways in which electronic devices (and the materials used in their fabrication) can be designed to accommodate these new form factors. Significant research efforts have generated various strategies for producing stretchable conductors and dielectrics,4–6 however, for semiconductors, the workhorse and central component of electronic devices, the process has been more challenging due to the intrinsically brittle nature of typical semiconductors.7–9 To circumvent this limitation, and access soft electronics, organic conjugated polymers have been developed for use in stretchable electronics over inorganic silicon due to their better tolerance to mechanical deformation, chemical versatility, and ease of processing at ambient conditions.10,11 However, π-conjugated polymers often have lower ability to transport charges as they are not as crystalline as their vacuum-deposited inorganic or small molecule counterparts.12
Through the years, many strategies have been developed for improving and fine-tuning the electronic properties of semiconducting polymers. Among others, the development of sophisticated techniques for the solution deposition of conjugated materials has shown to be promising in achieving enhanced charge transport in the solid state. For example, solution shearing is a technique that deposits films that are highly aligned due to the movement and guidance of a blade across a substrate that is fixed at a particular temperature. The enhanced film alignment and contracted π-stacking distance between the polymer backbones have been shown to enhance charge transport to a significant extent.13–15 In particular, Diao et al. demonstrated the solution coating of TIPS–Pentacene small molecules to produce highly aligned and single-crystalline domains in thin films possessing unprecedented hole mobilities of up to 11 cm2 V−1 s−1.16
To improve the electronic properties of conjugated polymers, rational modification of the molecular structure through precise chemical design and synthesis has also been a popular approach to design semiconducting polymers with improved charge transport.17 Either by using side-chain engineering to incorporate functional sidechains or bulky substituents, or through backbone engineering with different units. This approach has the advantage for being entirely customizable, allowing access to materials having well-defined charge transport, and good optoelectronic properties, solubility, and mechanical robustness. Among the design strategies developed, fluorination of conjugated polymers has been employed to great effect. As a backbone modification, it has been shown to affect the nanomorphology and optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers, resulting in closer packing in the solid state and enhanced electronic performance in devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).18–20 Mueller et al. showed the influence of the degree of fluorination on the charge-carrier mobility and film morphology in diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers, and observed that fluorination increases the d-spacing of alkyl lamella, but reduces the π-stacking distance.21 Fluorination has been utilized thoroughly to modify high-performance semiconducting polymers, and its effect was shown to be particularly pronounced for benzothiadiazole (BT)-based conjugated polymers.22–24 For example, Zhou et al. fluorinated the backbone of BT-based polymers resulting in solar cells with modified frontier molecular energy levels, while maintaining the small bandgap of its nonfluorinated counterpart.25 Bulk heterojunction OPVs made from these materials exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.2%, compared to just 5% for the non-fluorinated analogue. Another example is reported by Baumgarten and co-workers demonstrating the effect of fluorination to elicit the ambipolarity in BT-based conjugated polymers, showing high and balanced hole and electron mobilities.26
Typically, high-performance conjugated polymers for organic electronics show high Young's moduli (from hundreds of MPa to tens of GPa) and low crack-onset strains, which is inversely correlated to the electronic properties. This dual relationship between charge transport and mechanical robustness is due to the antagonistic relationship between the film morphology and mechanical properties: the film morphology often most conducive to charge transport (highly ordered and crystalline) opposes the morphology most tolerant to strain (disordered and amorphous), and vice versa.27 Interestingly, the burgeoning field of stretchable organic electronics has produced numerous strategies for modulating the mechanical and thermal properties of conjugated polymers.28–31 One such method which affects the properties of conjugated polymers is through the addition of soft alkyl chains.32 Specifically, increasing the solubilizing side chain density of conjugated polymers reported by Zhang et al. has shown to significantly reduce both the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the elastic modulus.33 Moreover, Chen and co-workers showed the positive effect of incorporating long oligomeric side chains into isoindigo-bithiophene conjugated polymers. The resulting polymers exhibited low glass transition temperatures, low elastic modulus, high crack onset strains, and high charge carrier mobilities in field-effect transistors (higher than 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1).34 Despite being an important strategy to improve the performance of semiconducting polymers for organic electronics, the impact of backbone fluorination on glass transition temperatures and softness of semiconducting polymers is still unclear. The incorporation of fluorine atoms can be advantageous since it can potentially allow for strain dissipation upon stress through non-covalent H–F bonds.35,36 On the other ends, fluorination can result in the π-conjugated backbone to become more planar, thus increasing crystallinity and the rigidity of the macromolecule.
Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of BT-based conjugated polymers with different degree of fluorination and alkylation, and the evaluation of their thermal and mechanical properties in the solid-state. Through the precise control of backbone design and fluorination, this work demonstrates the relationship between backbone fluorination/alkylation and the solid-state properties of π-conjugated polymers. The properties were probed by various techniques, including film-on-elastomer tensile strain measurements, dynamic mechanical analysis, and organic field-effect transistor fabrications. The addition of fluorine increases the mobility, while resulting in brittle thin films. To counterbalance the mechanical impact of fluorine addition, alkyl chains were introduced to the chemical structure. Through our investigation, we found the elastic moduli of the materials, their strain at failure, and their glass transition temperatures were intimately correlated. This work highlights the importance of chemical design for the development of stretchable materials for organic electronics. Moreover, it provides a synthetic toolbox to access materials with tunable charge transport and mechanical robustness.
2. Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All commercially available solvents, reagents, and chemicals were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated. Anhydrous solvent tetrahydrofuran was distilled from sodium under argon. 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 2-decyltetradecan-1-ol, sodium tert-butoxide, N-bromosuccinimide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Unless otherwise stated all operations and reactions were carried out under argon using standard Schlenk line techniques. 1H, 19F and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz), using the residual solvent resonance of CDCl3 or TMS as an internal reference and are given in ppm. Number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) were determined by Agilent Technologies 1200 series GPC running in chlorobenzene at 85 °C, using two PL mixed B columns in series, and calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a UV-1601 Shimadzu UV-vis spectrometer. Flash chromatography (FC) was performed on silica gel (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 230–400 mesh) unless otherwise indicated. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck aluminum-backed plates pre-coated with silica (0.2 mm, 60 F254). Microwave experiments were performed in a Biotage initiator V 2.3. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of polymers films were performed under argon atmosphere using a CHI760E Voltammetry analyzer with 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. A platinum disk working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire reference electrode were employed, and the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal reference for all measurements. The scanning rate was 50 mV s−1. Polymer films were drop-casted from chlorobenzene solutions on a Pt working electrode (2 mm in diameter). The surface structure of polymer film was obtained using a Multimode atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments) operated in the tapping mode at room temperature. Images were collected using Nanoscope 6 software and processed using Gwyddion software.
Theoretical methods
DFT was used to optimize molecular geometries, identify vibrational modes and scan their conformational spaces with B3LYP-D3 as the functional and 6-31G(d,p) as the basis set. Calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 environment. Energies taken from the output files were converted from Hartrees to kJ mol−1.
Buckling metrology
Elastic moduli measurements were conducted by buckling-based metrology following previously reported protocols.37 Polymers P1 to P3 were dissolved in chlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) and spincoated onto silicon wafers functionalized with a n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer at 500, 1000, and 1500 RPM to produce films of varying thicknesses.38 Rectangular slabs of PDMS (base:crosslinker, 10:1, cured for 72 h at room temperature) were strained to 10% on a handheld microvice. Films were then transferred to the pre-strained PDMS, and buckling instability was produced upon release of the strain, forming wrinkles in the films. Each film was visualized under an optical microscope and the number of wrinkles were counted for at least 3 separate locations. To determine the buckling wavelength, λ, the width of the image was divided by the average number of wrinkles. The elastic modulus of the PDMS was determined through DMA in stress–strain mode. Finally, the thickness of the films was measured through AFM, and the elastic modulus of the films was determined through fitting to the equation Ef/(1 − vf2) = (3Es/1 − vs2)(λ/2πhf)3.
Crack onset strain measurement
Crack onset strain measurements were conducted by tensile pull testing of thin films supported on elastomer.39 Conjugated polymers P1 to P3 were dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene at a concentration of 7 mg mL−1 and then spincoated onto OTS-modified wafers. As cast wafers were then brought into a N2-filled glovebox and annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 minutes. Following thermal annealing, thin films were transferred onto rectangular PDMS slabs (base:crosslinker, 20:1, crosslinked at 70 °C overnight) and stretched to strains ranging from 0–30% elongation. Following the application of strain, the stretched films were transfer-printed onto a receiving wafer and then visualized under an optical microscope.
Dynamic mechanical analysis
Samples for DMA were prepared by drop casting the dissolved polymers (10 mg mL−1) onto a glass fiber support (supplied by Hexcel) until uniform coverage was achieved and were then dried in air overnight. The glass fibers were first cut at a 45° angle to prevent continuous fibers along the length of the sample which could confound the DMA response. DMA measurements were performed on a TA Q850 in oscillation mode at a frequency of 1 Hz. All samples were measured under a continuous flow of N2 at 60 mm min−1 with a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1. All samples underwent an initial dry run up to 150 °C to remove any remaining solvent, followed by another run from −50 °C to 250 °C. Based on previous reports, sidechain Tg was assigned with peaks in the loss modulus, while the backbone is done through assigning peaks in tan delta.33 Data from the second run were used for all samples.40
Organic field-effect transistor fabrication
Bottom gate–bottom contact devices were fabricated on highly-doped silicon wafer with 300 nm SiO2 insulator and silicon was used as gate electrode. 30 nm gold (Au) and titanium (Ti) layers were thermally evaporated onto the substrate using a shadow mask to form the source and drain contacts. The channel length (L) and channel width (W) were 5 and 1400 μm, respectively. The substrate was thoroughly cleaned by placing it in piranha solution. After removing the piranha solution and rinsing the substrate with deionized water three times, the substrate was sonicated with deionized water, toluene, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 5 minutes, respectively. Drying the substrate with nitrogen, UV-ozone (UV/O3) treatment was done for 15 min, and then baked at 90 °C for 0.5 h at 0.1 Pa in a vacuum oven. OTS treatment was performed as described previously, and the OTS-treated substrate was ultrasonically treated with n-hexane, chloroform, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 5 minutes, and then blow dried. Polymer solutions in chloroform at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 were prepared and heated using the hot platform at 60 °C for 10 min, respectively. In N2 glovebox, the formed polymer solution was spin-coated on the processed substrate at 2000 rpm for 60 s, then annealed at different heat treatment temperature on a hotplate for 15 min. The devices were characterized using Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer in the nitrogen environment after the samples cooled down to the room temperature. The threshold voltage (Vth) and field-effect mobility (μ) in the saturation region were determined from μsat = 2L/CW (δ(ID)1/2/δVG)2, where W and L are the channel width and length, respectively. Ci is the capacitance of the insulator.
Transfer-printed organic field-effect transistor fabrication
Conjugated polymer semiconductor films were transfer printed for OFET fabrication according to the method described by Bao and co-workers.39 First, the polymer inks were spincoated onto OTS-modified silicon wafers and annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen filled glovebox with <0.5 ppm of both O2 and H2O. Next, the annealed films were transferred onto a rectangular slab of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer (base: crosslinker ratio = 20:1 w/w, crosslinked overnight at 70 °C in an oven). Each transferred film was stretched to a particular strain between 0–30% and subsequently transferred back to an p-doped 300 nm SiO2 OTS-modified wafer. Following film transfer, 50 nm of top contact Au source and drain electrodes were evaporated onto the wafers through a shadow mask with 100 μm channel length and 1000 μm channel width oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the strain direction. The completed devices were then brought into the glovebox for testing with a Keithley 4200-SCS analyzer. The field-effect mobility was estimated by taking the slope of the linear region of the square root of drain current vs gate voltage in the saturation regime using the equation μsat = 2L/CW (δ(ID)1/2/δVG)2.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis of monomers M1, M2 and M3 is depicted in Scheme 1. 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) was reacted with sodium tert-butoxide in THF solution and further addition of either one or two equivalent of 2-decyl-1-tetradecanol afforded products 2 or 3, respectively. The Stille cross-coupling reaction of compounds 1, 2 and 3 with tributyl(selenophen-2-yl)stannane in chlorobenzene using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst afforded intermediates 4, 5 and 6 in good yields ranging from 82–87%. Subsequently, dibromination with NBS in DMF afforded the desired target monomers M1–M3.

The impact of backbone design and fluorination on backbone planarity was first investigated by theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT), and the detailed procedure is described in the Experimental Section. As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), dihedral scans of the angle between the selenophene and central BT unit of monomers M1–M3 were conducted to determine the influence of the different backbone substitutions on the rotational barrier height. Monomers M1–M3 were truncated to monomers containing only a single selenophene and the alkoxy substituent in M2 and M3 was truncated to methyl caps to reduce computational cost. The potential energy scans of the dihedral angle of interest showed that the F–H interaction along the backbone results in a global energy minimum, whereas the N–H interaction that occurs when the selenophene is rotated 180° results in a local minimum. More specifically, M1 shows that the F–H interaction between the selenophene and the fluorinated BT unit is approximately 2.5 kJ mol−1 more stable than the N–H interaction when the selenophene unit is rotated 180° about the dihedral axis. Conversely, when the F–H interaction is replaced by an alkoxy–H interaction, as in M2 and M3, the N–H interaction instead is more stabilizing by approximately 10 kJ mol−1. Therefore, the H–F pseudo hydrogen-bond is more stable than the alkoxy–H interaction. Moreover, to examine the effect of fluorination on the polymer backbone planarity, we performed geometry optimizations on truncated trimers of P1 to P3. The optimized structures are shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†) with the corresponding dihedral angles averaged over the three repeat units. P1 shows the greatest planarity with an average optimized dihedral angle of 0.0961° ± 0.0674 between the BT unit and selenophene. When one of the fluorine substituents is replaced with alkoxy, as in P2, the average dihedral angle widens significantly to 7.75° ± 0.502 on the alkoxy side and 1.04° ± 0.429 on the fluorinated side of the BT unit. When both these substituents are replaced with alkoxy sidechains, as in P3, the average dihedral angle becomes 8.16° ± 0.811 on both sides of the BT unit.
The optical properties of the copolymers P1–P3 are summarized in Table 1, and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra of P1–P3 in chlorobenzene solution and as thin film are depicted in Fig. 1a–c. In solution, all copolymers exhibited an intramolecular charge transfer transition with absorption maxima (λmax) at 574 nm for P1, 609 nm for P2 and 577 nm for P3 nm, as well as, pronounced shoulder suggesting strong intramolecular interactions due to aggregation in solution.41,42 In comparison, both P1 and P3 display a bathochromic shift (18–36 nm) in their film absorption spectra, with absorption maxima at 610 nm for P1 and 595 for P3. However, P2 (bearing both fluorine and alkyl side chain) does not show a significant shift, which can be attributed to the structural asymmetry impacting solid-state packing. All copolymers exhibited a pronounced vibronic shoulder suggesting a strong interchain π–π stacking interaction that promotes regular packing of the polymer backbone in the solid state. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) were calculated from the onsets of the absorption spectra in the thin films and were found to be in the range of 1.61–1.67 eV for P1–P3. Interestingly, exchanging one of the fluoro-substituent in P1 to the 2-decyl-1-tetradecyl branch alkoxy chain resulting in P2 resulted in a blue shift of only 3 nm for the absorption maxima in the thin film. While exchanging both fluoro atoms with the alkoxy groups to afford P3, increases the hypsochromic shift to 15 nm. This can be attributed to the exchange of conformation in the copolymer backbone, due to the possible non-covalent interactions taking place between the heterocycle chalcogen Se atom and the benzothiadiazole substituent in P1 (selenium–fluoro interaction) and P2 (selenium–fluoro and selenium–oxygen (alkoxy) interaction).43–45 This effect is not as pronounced in P3, which only can generate Se–oxygen interactions.

The oxidation and reduction potentials of copolymers P1–P3 were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) as an internal standard as shown in Fig. 1d. All copolymers exhibited a strong donor character with pronounced oxidation bands with onset oxidation potentials (Eox) at 0.62, 0.60 and 0.58 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The HOMO energy levels were calculated based on the onset of the first Eox potentials in comparison to the ferrocene oxidation potential under vacuum of −4.8 eV and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between Eoptg and HOMO energy level as summarized in Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 1e, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1–P3 were estimated to be −4.96/−3.35 (P1), −4.94/−3.29 (P2) and −4.92/−3.25 eV (P3). These results confirm that by increasing the number of fluorine substituents on benzothiadiazole have a clear effect on the electrochemical properties for the copolymers. This is demonstrated by the stabilized HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which agreed with the reduction of alkoxy side chains along the polymer backbone.
To gain insight on the nanoscale morphology of semiconducting polymer films, and to evaluate the effect of backbone fluorination, thin films of P1, P2 and P3 were visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The microstructure observed for the different materials are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S21 (ESI†). AFM height images show relatively smooth films at the nanoscale for all polymers. This morphology is typically observed for similar conjugated polymers, which confirm that the incorporation of fluorine atoms onto the π-conjugated backbone does not significantly impact the solid-state morphology. The impact on surface roughness of the film is also minimal, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.49 and 1.62 nm for P1 and P2 respectively. The RMS roughness is slightly more important for P3, showing an RMS roughness of 3.52 nm.

As previously reported for other high-performance semiconducting polymers, the incorporation of additional side chains onto the polymer backbone typically results in lower values of elastic modulus due to the amorphous nature of these flexible side chains and a higher degree of freedom.33 However, the impact of backbone fluorination is less clear. Therefore, to determine the effect of fluorination on the mechanical properties, we measured and compared their elastic moduli through the buckling metrology, a method pioneered by Bowden et al.46 and applied to conjugated polymers by Stafford and co-workers.37 The results are shown in Fig. S22–S24 (ESI†). As expected, P1, bearing two fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole block, showed the highest tensile modulus by an order of magnitude of 4.14 GPa. This value is significantly higher than previously reported moduli for semicrystalline polymers, which clearly indicates that backbone fluorination, while helping to increase π-conjugation and backbone rigidity, is detrimental to the softness of the material. Simply replacing one fluorine substituent for an alkoxy chain is enough to significantly reduce the elastic modulus of P2 to 905 MPa. Expectedly, P3 bearing soft, branched alkyl side chains has a low tensile modulus of 127 MPa. This can be attributed to the direct presence of the side chains. Interestingly, the Young's modulus for P3 is quite low for a conjugated polymer as semicrystalline polymers typically have moduli in the range of 300 to 700 MPa. Overall, fluorination has the effect of increasing the elastic modulus of conjugated polymers when incorporated into the backbone, while alkylation with soft pendant side chains has the opposite effect.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) is another important parameter to control when designing electroactive materials for mechanically robust electronics. Typically, lower Tg values correspond to increased ductility when processed into thin films, especially for values that are at or below room temperature.47 To get insight on the effect of backbone fluorination on Tg, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed on all three materials.40 A detailed procedure can be found in the experimental section, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3. P1 (Fig. 3a) possesses a side chain Tg of 6.33 °C and a high backbone Tg of 149.3 °C. This is a significant increase compared to other conjugated polymers of similar structure measured through the same method, for example PCDTBT with a measured Tg of 126 °C.40 The high Tg for the backbone can be attributed to an improved packing of the conjugated polymer in the solid state, again due to backbone fluorination. Furthermore, P2 shows a similar side chain Tg of 4.43 °C and a backbone Tg of 159.3 °C (Fig. 3b). The slightly lower side chain Tg for P2 can be attributed to the asymmetry of the monofluorinated monomer causing poorer side chain crystallization in the solid state. Finally, P3, which has alkoxy groups substituted instead of fluorine groups, shows a transition for the side chains at 10.4 °C and a backbone Tg of 92.0 °C, as shown in Fig. 3c. The presence of such a low Tg is indicative of P3's more rubbery nature, and can be directly attributed to the presence of the long branched alkyl chains as observed for other semicrystalline conjugated polymers.48

The crack onset strain is a qualitative assessment of the mechanical durability of a thin film under tensile strain.49 To investigate the effect of the π-conjugated backbone design on the mechanical properties of the novel conjugated polymers, the crack-onset strain of P1 to P3 was determined. This analysis was performed through soft-contact lamination onto a PDMS stamp, followed by the application of tensile strains ranging from 0–30%, subsequent transfer to a silicon wafer, and visualization under an optical microscope to confirm the presence of micron scale cracks.39 It is important to mention that PDMS was chosen over commonly used water support for specific reasons. Firstly, the presence of water may have a direct influence on the measured properties due to its potential impact on the formation of non-covalent interactions triggered by the presence of the fluorine atoms, preventing from getting a clear understanding of the influence of these dynamic backbone interactions on the mechanical properties. Secondly, considering the potential application of these materials in stretchable and wearable electronics, PDMS was selected as the support given its biocompatibility and previous application in these areas. The crack onset strains of each polymer is shown in Fig. 4. P1 has poor stretchability as shown by the wide microscale cracks which appear when stretched to only 10% strain. Likewise, P2 has a similar crack onset strain of just 10% with thin and long micro cracks as shown by optical microscopy. Finally, P3 has a much-improved tolerance to mechanical deformation, showing a 3-fold increase in crack onset strain to 30% elongation. This improvement in performance is supported by the lower Tg and lower elastic modulus as measured through DMA and the buckling metrology, respectively. The ability to stretch to 30% elongation is significant, especially for wearable applications, since the human body experiences strains not exceeding 30% making P3 the best performing candidate when purely considering mechanical properties.50

Following the synthesis, optoelectronic, and mechanical characterizations, polymers P1–P3 were dissolved and solution casted into bottom-gate, bottom-contact organic field effect transistors. The complete method for device fabrication is detailed in the experimental section and the results are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the differences in film morphology derived from the fluorination along the conjugated backbone has a remarkable influence on the electronic properties. Polymers P1, P2, and P3 all showed typical transfer and output characteristics in organic field-effect transistors (Fig. S25, ESI†). P1, which has two fluorine atoms appended to the benzothiadiazole unit, shows the highest charge carrier mobility between the three materials, exhibiting a maximum hole mobility of 0.056 cm2 V−1 s−1, a low threshold voltage of −6.1 V, and good ION/OFF ratio of 107, when annealed at 150 °C. When one of the fluorine substituents is replaced with a branched alkoxy chain, as in P2, the maximum hole mobility is reduced by an order of magnitude to 0.0010 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the optimal annealing temperature is also reduced to 120 °C. Moreover, the threshold voltage increases to −17.3 V and the ION/OFF ratio decreases slightly to 106. Finally, when both substituents are branched alkoxy chains as in P3, the maximum mobility drops by an additional 2 orders of magnitude to 6.7 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an as-cast annealing temperature. The low mobility values can be attributed to the amorphous nature and self-assembly of the polymer, and the incorporation of the alkoxy side chains which are insulating. Moreover, the threshold voltage decreases slightly to −12.3 V with an accompanying ION/OFF ratio of 106.

While the impact of backbone fluorination is significant on the mechanical and electronic properties of P1 to P3, its impact on the electronic properties upon mechanical strain is also particularly intriguing. Therefore, to determine the substitution effect (with fluorine or alkoxy side chains) on electronic property, thin films were stretched under various strains, and directly used for the fabrication of OFET devices.49 The complete procedure to fabricate and evaluate OFETs from stretched films is detailed in the experimental section, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5, Fig. S26 and S27 (ESI†). Notably, when cracks propagate in a thin film under strain, they appear in the direction perpendicular to the applied strain. For this reason, the charge transport properties are anisotropic and typically suffer more from strain when devices are evaluated parallel to the applied strain as compared to perpendicular. Accordingly, the charge transport for all polymers perpendicular to strain (Fig. 5b) is higher than parallel (Fig. 5a), having mobility values that do not decrease by more than an order of magnitude. Comparing the mobility retention parallel to the applied strain for each polymer individually, P1 shows the greatest decrease in performance at every measured strain value compared to its initial value, which directly correlates with its low crack onset strain. At just 10% strain, the mobility value drops to 3.2% of its initial value (Table S1, ESI†) and decreases even further to 1.8% at 30% strain. Meanwhile, P2 shows improvement in mobility retention, having a moderate drop in its electronic properties to 35% of its initial value at 10% strain, but 8.7% of its initial value at 30% strain. We attribute this improvement to its greater ability to dissipate strain induced by the incorporation of the alkoxy side chain. P3, which performs the best, follows this same trend as it has a higher density of alkoxy chains appended along the backbone. As a result, the hole mobility of P3 retains 49% of its initial value at up to 30% strain. Combined with its low elastic modulus, P3 is the softest polymer that exhibits the best tolerance to strain.

4. Conclusion
In summary, new semiconducting polymers were synthesized that compare the effect of alkylation and fluorination along benzothiadiazole-based conjugated polymers. Through a series of characterizations to evaluate the optoelectronic, mechanical, and thermal transition properties, we confirmed that fluorination results in mechanically brittle materials, but superior field-effect mobility, and conversely alkylation to introduce alkoxy substituents on the polymer chain results in softer, and more compliant materials but with low mobility. Specifically, exchanging one of the fluoro-substituents with a branched alkoxy chain led to a blue shift of 3 nm, while replacing both fluoro atoms further shifts it by 15 nm. Importantly, fluorination increases the elastic modulus of conjugated polymers when incorporated into the backbone, while alkylation softens it. When processed into devices, P1 shows the highest charge carrier mobility of the three materials under study, showing a high hole mobility of 0.056 cm2 V−1 s−1, a low threshold voltage of −6.1 V, and a high ION/OFF of 107. On the other hand, P3 can stretch to 30% elongation, which is 3-fold the extensibility of P1. Consequently, the hole mobility of P3 only drops to 49% its initial value at 30% strain, whereas P1 drops to as low as 1.8%. Altogether, P1 exhibits the best electronic properties for pristine films, and the worst mechanical properties under strain, while P2 shows an improvement in the mechanical character, but diminishing ability to transport charge. P3 is the softest of the three polymers under study and exhibits mechanical and electronic properties with the best tolerance to strain.
While being an efficient strategy to improve the electronic and solid-state properties of semiconducting polymers, backbone fluorination can be detrimental to the mechanical properties of the materials. The results discussed in this work demonstrate the importance and effect of molecular design when considering the use of conjugated polymers for mechanically robust and wearable electronics. More importantly, this work introduces a new structure–property relationship for synthetic materials chemists to consider when utilizing backbone fluorination of semiconducting polymers. Ultimately, the new materials reported in this work offer new tunable alternatives to current semiconducting polymers for the fabrication of emerging soft electronics.
