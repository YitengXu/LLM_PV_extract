    , Accepted 16th February 2016First published on 16th February 2016AbstractThe barium peroxide-based redox cycle was proposed in the late 1970s as a thermochemical energy storage system. Since then, very little attention has been paid to such redox couples. In this paper, we have revisited the use of reduction–oxidation reactions of the BaO2/BaO system for thermochemical heat storage at high temperatures. Using thermogravimetric analysis, reduction and oxidation reactions were studied in order to find the main limitations associated with each process. Furthermore, the system was evaluated through several charge–discharge stages in order to analyse its possible degradation after repeated cycling. Through differential scanning calorimetry the heat stored and released were also determined. Oxidation reaction, which was found to be slower than reduction, was studied in more detail using isothermal tests. It was observed that the rate-controlling step of BaO oxidation follows zero-order kinetics, although at high temperatures a deviation from Arrhenius behaviour was observed probably due to hindrances to anionic oxygen diffusion caused by the formation of an external layer of BaO2. This redox couple was able to withstand several redox cycles without deactivation, showing reaction conversions close to 100% provided that impurities are previously eliminated through thermal pre-treatment, demonstrating the feasibility of this system for solar thermochemical heat storage.
Introduction
Thermal energy storage (TES) systems have been attracting high interest in recent years because with their implementation the problem of intermittence inherently associated with concentrated solar power (CSP) plants could be solved, allowing round-the-clock electricity production.1 According to the mechanism through which solar energy is stored, three types of TES are defined: sensible, latent and thermochemical heat storage (TCS).2 TCS systems store and release heat through reversible endo–exo reactions and present several advantages with respect to the other two types:3,4 higher energy storage densities, the possibility of storage at ambient temperature and for longer storage periods since no heat loss is expected. On the other hand, such technology is less mature and TCS systems present higher complexity than the sensible or even latent ones.
Another advantage of TCS is the wide variety of existing reversible chemical reactions, which allows choosing the most appropriate one for a specific application. Depending on the chemical nature of the reactants, several types of TCS systems can be found: carbonates, hydrides, hydroxides, etc.3,4 Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of TCS based on reduction–oxidation reactions. These processes present the attractive feature of working as an open system in which air is used both as a heat transfer fluid and a reactant. This avoids the need of reactant gas storage as in the case of carbonate or hydroxide-based cycles. TCS based on redox reactions stores and releases heat through the next reactions: Charge MOx + ΔH → MOx−y + y/2 O2(g)(1) Discharge MOx−y + y/2 O2(g) → MOx + ΔH(2) The use of redox systems was first proposed in the late 1970s.5,6 The BaO2/BaO redox couple was the first one investigated for such a purpose.6,7 However, in the following decades few additional studies were reported, until recently, when the interest in redox systems for TCS purposes emerged again. Besides the barium-based oxides, research efforts have been specially focused on the Mn2O3/Mn3O48–10 and Co3O4/CoO8,11–17 redox couples. To a lesser extent the CuO/Cu2O18,19 couple has been studied and, more recently, TCS based on redox reactions of perovskite oxides has also been proposed.20
For this particular application, the main drawback that redox metal oxides present is the degradation caused by the high temperatures used for the charge–discharge cycles. Namely, particle sintering causes severe deactivation resulting in a cycle-to-cycle decrease of the oxidation rate. Although several approaches have succeeded in stabilizing the activity over prolonged cycling, working under less severe conditions would be beneficial for the redox materials since sintering increases exponentially with temperature. In addition, diminishing the reduction temperature can be positive from an operational point of view when directly irradiated reactor configurations are used, since this would imply a decrease in radiation heat loss and, consequently, the use of more conventional reactor types and materials could be explored. In that specific case, the charge step in which solar heat is stored is directly performed by impinging the solar radiation onto the material in order to carry out the reduction, through which heat is captured in the chemical bonds of the reaction products. When energy is needed in off-sun periods, the reduced material reacts with air in the discharge step, releasing the energy stored due to the exothermic nature of such process. In this respect, the BaO2/BaO redox cycle presents more moderate charging conditions compared with Mn2O3/Mn3O4 and Co3O4/CoO systems, which are the two most investigated TCS candidates to date. Barium based redox pair presents equilibrium temperatures lower than the other two pairs as shown in Fig. 1. Besides, its reaction enthalpy, which is the magnitude that defines the energy storage density, is 474 kJ kg−1. This value doubles the heat storage capacity of the Mn-based oxide couple (202 kJ kg−1), although it is about half of the Co-based ones (844 kJ kg−1). Finally, barium-based ones are more abundant than Co ones and they present lower toxicity. All these facts are of importance when selecting the right candidate for TCS applications. Nevertheless, the key property of a chosen material is the durability during long-term cycling. In the case of BaO2/BaO, Fahim and Ford7 analysed the redox reversibility during 20 cycles observing a remarkable decay in the activity associated with incomplete redox reactions. Namely, full conversion was only achieved on the first cycle. Later, Wong et al.21 reported BaO oxidation conversion of just 20%. More recently, these mixed barium oxides have been studied for O2 separation cycles (the Brin process). For this application the authors have reported stable oxygenation–deoxygenation cycles that were improved by Mg–Sr co-doping.22–25 In view of these recent results, we have revisited the redox reversibility of the BaO2/BaO redox couple in order to ascertain the factors limiting long term solar TCS performance. With this aim, charge–discharge cycles were monitored by thermogravimetry. An initial kinetic analysis of the results was performed. In addition, an extensive characterization of both the fresh and cycled materials was carried out to correlate the variations in the physicochemical characteristics with redox performance of the BaO2/BaO system.

Experimental section
Materials
BaO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 95% purity) was used without further treatment unless otherwise specified in the text.
Thermodynamic calculations
Thermodynamic simulations were performed using the software package HSC Chemistry 6.1 from Outotec Research Oy. In order to obtain the equilibrium composition of the reactions minimization of Gibbs free energy was employed.
Redox cycles
The stability of redox cycles was monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a SDT Q-600 from TA Instruments connected to a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omnistar). In a typical experiment, 25–30 mg of sample were placed into a 90 μl alumina crucible and subjected to several charge–discharge cycles. Various temperature programs were analysed. As an example, a cycle consisted of a heating step from 500 °C to 900 °C and a cooling step from 900 °C to 500 °C, both at 5 °C min−1, under a constant air (Praxair, 99.999%) flow of 100 ml min−1. With TGA, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also simultaneously carried out in order to study the heat effects during reduction and oxidation reactions. DSC was calibrated using the melting temperatures of several metals along the temperature range utilized for redox cycling.
Kinetic analysis
For the oxidation kinetic analyses, a small amount (in order to avoid diffusional constraints) of BaO2, ca. 20 mg, was placed in an alumina crucible. First, a reduction step was carried out to obtain in situ the reduced form (BaO). This was done by heating the sample up to 1000 °C under a constant Ar flow of 100 ml min−1. That temperature was maintained for 30 min and then quickly cooled down to the desired temperature at which oxidation was isothermally carried out for 4 h under an air flow of 100 ml min−1. The cooling step was performed under an Ar atmosphere in order to avoid the oxidation to start before reaching the isotherm stage. Furthermore, the first 10 minutes of isotherm test were performed under Ar. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows an example of such tests.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out employing a Philips PW 3040/00 X'Pert MPD/MRD diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at a scanning rate of 0.2° s−1. The crystallite size was determined from the most intense reflection, according to the Scherrer formula. Tetragonal lattice parameters were determined by applying the Bragg law and equation 1/d2 = (h2 + k2/a2) + (l2/c2), where h, k and l are the Miller indices of the Bragg plane, a and c are the cell parameters and d the interplanar spacing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a Hitachi TM-100 microscope without any previous treatment of the samples. The chemical composition of the commercial material was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3300 DV equipment. Samples were previously digested in acid media in an Anton Paar Multi-wave 3000 microwave.
Results and discussion
BaO2/BaO system thermodynamics
A thermodynamic analysis of the BaO2/BaO redox reaction was performed utilizing the software HSC Chemistry 6.1 in order to assess the theoretical feasibility of this process. This redox couple stores and releases heat through the reversible reaction shown in eqn (3). Fig. 1 depicts a comparison of four different redox reactions proposed for this application. It can be observed that, in the case of the BaO2/BaO system, the forward reaction became thermodynamically favoured at temperatures over 885 °C (equilibrium temperature). This temperature is lower than for the other three redox couples, which is one of the advantages when considering the overall process. Fig. 2 shows the influence of total pressure on the reaction calculated using the same software. As expected, by performing the reaction at lower pressures the operational temperatures decreased. Working under vacuum conditions and using an inert gas carrier (low oxygen partial pressure)26 are the two main approaches for diminishing the reduction reaction temperatures. The results depicted in Fig. 2 also indicates that oxygen release should occur up to 900 °C so as to obtain full conversion. 2BaO2 ↔ 2BaO + O2 ΔH = 72.5 kJ mol BaO2−1(3)

Initial redox behaviour assessment
Commercially available BaO2 without further treatment was used for the preliminary evaluation of the redox behaviour. In this section we intended to analyse the capacity of these materials to withstand several charge–discharge cycles and the optimum conditions for such process. These initial experiments were carried out using a thermobalance as described in the Experimental section. This technique allows an accurate monitoring of these types of processes since reduction and oxidation reactions imply a weight variation, related to the release and uptake of oxygen, respectively. Based on the stoichiometry of the reversible reaction (eqn (3)), the theoretical weight loss/gain of this redox couple is 9.45%. However, as the commercial material used for this work possesses a purity of 95%, there is a certain amount of sample that might not be redox active. ICP-OES analyses further confirmed the presence of impurities. Namely, 2.42 wt% of Sr was detected (Table 1). X-Ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†) showed that the fresh BaO2 sample was formed only by the tetragonal BaO2 crystal phase (ICDD: 01-073-2175, space group I4/mmm). Sr2+ has smaller ionic radius27 than Ba2+, and it has been generally used as a dopant for improving oxygenation–deoxygenation reactions of BaO.22–25 In order to confirm if Sr cations were incorporated in the tetragonal BaO2 lattice, lattice parameters were determined (Table 1). The results for both a and c were slightly higher than the theoretical ones (3.8070 and 6.8410 Å, respectively). Thus, it is presumed that Sr2+ is not substituting Ba2+ since this should imply a decrease in either a or the c axis of the lattice. This could mean that Sr species might be present in the form of Sr carbonate, hydroxide, peroxide, etc., undetectable by XRD analyses due to its low concentration.

Based on the purity provided by the BaO2 supplier, the expected weight loss/gain for a total reduction and oxidation conversion might be lower than 9.45%. On a first basis, we will assume it to be 8.98%, since the initial purity is 95%.

Fig. 3 depicts five redox cycles performed with the BaO2 commercial sample. In this first case, each cycle consisted of heating up to 900 °C (Tmax) and cooling down to 500 °C (Tmin). Heating and cooling rates were 5 °C min−1 under air flow. In the first reduction step, after an initial weight change, ascribed to water desorption, the weight loss attained (9.40%) was larger than the theoretical one (8.98%). That means a second process besides the BaO2 thermal decomposition must have occurred. This will be discussed in more detail later. In the next oxidation step only 77% of BaO was re-oxidized (weight gain of 6.94%). Owing to incomplete re-oxidation, in the next cycle, neither reduction reaches a full conversion since only the previously formed BaO2 was available for thermal reduction. Therefore, oxidation is the slowest reaction and the one limiting step for the whole process. Interestingly, in the next cycles an increase in the oxidation conversion was observed. Namely, in the fourth cycle 86% oxidation conversion was attained. This unexpected behaviour must be related to either structural or morphological changes caused by the thermal cycling that eventually ease the oxidation reaction. Analysing the oxidation reaction in more detail, it was deduced that, under these conditions, it happened in two consecutive steps since two different shoulders could be clearly distinguished in the weight gain curve (see magnification of the first cycle curve and its derivative in Fig. S3, ESI†). Regarding the reduction reaction, two steps were also clearly visible in the first cycle, (Fig. S3a, ESI†). According to Mayorova et al., the intermediate step prior to BaO formation is the appearance of a metastable “BaOx” phase.28

Nevertheless, in this case it might be related to an initial “curing” process that acted only during the first cycle thermal reduction, since this two-step weight loss was not observed in the next cycles (Fig. S3, ESI†). To get further insight into the thermal decomposition of BaO2, such reaction was also analysed by means of mass spectrometry, varying the heating ramp (Fig. S4, ESI†). It was observed that the faster the heating rate, the faster the oxygen release. Thus, the thermal reduction of BaO2 to form BaO seems to be controlled by heat-transfer. Such behaviour was reported in the literature for reduction of other metal oxides.10,29,30
Influence of the cooling rate on redox reversibility
After this first set of experiments it was concluded that oxidation is the limiting step and that reduction can be performed at faster heating rates and lower Tmax. In order to improve the oxidation conversion, the effect that the cooling rate has on the oxygen uptake was studied. For this purpose three independent runs of ten charge–discharge cycles were carried out on the fresh BaO2 sample. The results of these experiments are depicted in Fig. 4. For these cycling tests the reduction was carried out at 10 °C min−1, instead of 5 °C min−1, since we found that the reduction reaction was faster when using higher heating rates. Tmax was lowered to 850 °C since it ensured that the reduction reached completion. Furthermore, Tmin was lowered to 400 °C, since a higher temperature drop might help the re-oxidation reaction. Fig. 4a–c reveals that performing the discharge step at low cooling rates enhanced its conversion. Interestingly, in every case cyclability showed a cycle-to-cycle improvement. As aforementioned, microstructural stabilization or the elimination of volatile impurities after several cycles can be responsible for this better activity. XRD analyses (Fig. S5, ESI†) showed that after ten cycles the predominant crystal phase was BaO2 with a negligible contribution of an unidentified phase, evidencing the high oxidation conversion obtained in the last cycle in each of these tests. Lattice parameters were determined for the cycled material after each assay. Values depicted in Table 2 indicated that, after cycling, BaO2 suffered a shrinking in the a-axis. This could be caused by the incorporation of Sr cations of smaller ionic radius in the BaO2 lattice due to diffusion phenomena driven by the high temperatures reached while cycling. This fact could also explain why in each assay the reaction extent was improved after the first cycle. Therefore, it is hypothesized that Sr cations, present as impurities in the fresh commercial sample (Table 1), migrated towards the BaO2 or BaO lattice, its incorporation being helpful in the BaO oxidation. The benefits of Sr-doping in BaO oxygenation–deoxygenation cycles have been reported recently in the literature.22–25

Fig. 4d shows the hysteresis loop for the BaO2/BaO system, typical for reversible redox reactions. From an energy efficiency point of view, it is important that the difference between reduction and oxidation temperatures is as small as possible, since it means that charge and discharge can take place at a similar temperature. Reduction and oxidation onset temperatures (5th cycle) were 714 and 704 °C, respectively, which is only a 10 °C difference between both values. However, reduction was completed at 790 °C whereas oxidation reached its maximum conversion just at the end of the cooling step, evidencing that reduction is a much faster process than oxidation. This can be appreciated in Fig. 5a, where both reaction rates are plotted for each cycle. Reaction rate values were determined as the maximum of the peak corresponding to the derivative curve of the weight versus time. Reduction is a fourfold faster reaction than oxidation. Regarding the influence of the cooling rate on the oxidation rate a similar trend was observed as that of reduction: the faster the cooling rate the faster the oxidation. As depicted in Fig. 5b, after certain stabilization, when oxidation is carried out at 10 °C min−1 the reaction in the 10th cycle is 2.5 times faster than when the cooling step is performed at a rate of 2 °C min−1. This result was quite unexpected since the opposite trend was observed for Mn3O4 oxidation10 used for the same application, unveiling a very different kinetic mechanism. Nevertheless, this fact positively affects the overall performance, since the oxidation rate can be increased just by adjusting the operating conditions. In more detail, Fig. 5c shows a comparison of the oxidation extent for the 10th cycle for different cooling rates used. In the case of using a 2 °C min−1 rate, 90% conversion is reached after 50 min, whereas at 10 °C min−1 it took just 20 min.

Fig. 6 depicts the SEM micrographs recorded for the BaO2 samples before and after cycling. The fresh material is formed by aggregates of irregular particles of small size, and larger ones with prismatic-like shape. After cycling a certain degree of sintering is observed regardless of the operation conditions employed, as higher agglomeration becomes apparent. Nevertheless, the sintering extent increased when using slower cooling rates. This is explained by the direct relationship of sintering with time spent at high temperatures. In contrast to the Mn2O3/Mn3O4 couple,9 for the BaO2/BaO system, it was observed that sintering did not add kinetic hurdles to the oxidation reaction since redox rates exhibited high cycle-to-cycle stability.

Heat stored/released analyses
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed simultaneously with TGA, and with this technique it was possible to evaluate the heat associated with the endothermic and exothermic processes of, respectively, BaO2 reduction and BaO oxidation. By integration of DSC peaks, the enthalpy associated with the process can be measured. Fig. 7 shows the heat flow signal for a charge–discharge cycle performed on BaO2. Reduction exhibited a peak with an enthalpy value of 390 kJ kg−1, which represents the heat that is being stored by this system. On the other hand, the heat release was related to the exothermic oxidation with a measured enthalpy value of 387.9 kJ kg−1. The heat released/stored ratio is close to 1. These values are 18% lower than the theoretical one. However, it should be noted that the sample was not 100% pure, the reaction did not reach full conversion and the measurements were carried out in alumina (poor heat conductor) open crucibles, therefore, some heat loss was expected, as they have been found in other systems. Considering these aspects, a reasonable agreement in the enthalpy values with previous reports is found, which confirms the interest in this material for heat storage.

Influence of thermal pre-treatment on the cyclability
The effect that thermal pre-treatment has on the redox reversibility was studied based on the work reported by Mayorova et al.28 and Jorda and Jondo,31 who found the presence of BaCO3 in commercial samples used in their studies. This compound is quite stable at high temperatures since its decomposition starts at 825 °C and it is not totally transformed into BaO until reaching 1130 °C (see Fig. S6, ESI† for a detailed thermodynamic simulation). In the XRD analysis of the commercial BaO2 sample the presence of any phase related to BaCO3 was not inferred. However, it could be present as an “amorphous” phase or a thin layer and most likely in low quantities, therefore being undetectable to the XRD analysis. In order to check the presence of such a phase, the commercial BaO2 sample was heated up to 1100 °C in an Ar atmosphere in a thermobalance, monitoring the gas evolution using mass spectrometry (MS). TGA-MS results of such assay are depicted in Fig. 8. It can be observed that after BaO2 reduction (O2 release), the material released CO2 accompanied by a weight loss of 0.45%. These results are consistent with BaCO3 decomposition, which takes place rapidly generating a CO2 peak between 800 and 1000 °C. A lower but continuous CO2 release was also observed in the isothermal stage, which stopped during the cooling since BaCO3 decomposition was no longer thermodynamically favoured.
 Fig. 8  Mass spectrometry signal for O2 and CO2versus time and temperature during BaO2 reduction under an Ar atmosphere. The release of CO2 is attributed to BaCO3 decomposition. 
According to this, the commercial sample was calcined in a tubular furnace at 1000 °C for one hour under an Ar flow of 100 ml min−1 in order to remove the carbonate species. After the isotherm measurement the resulting white powder was placed into a vial and immediately stored in a desiccator/decarbonator. Such sample should be mainly composed of BaO since both BaO2 and BaCO3 were transformed into such phase, although, small traces of the latter could be still present since the temperature for full carbonate decomposition (1130 °C) was not reached. However, when such sample was analysed by XRD, the results mainly showed reflections from barium hydroxide species. This indicates that BaO, the reduced form, was quite unstable under ambient conditions if it is not properly stored. This is caused by the high hygroscopicity exhibited by BaO.32 In this case, BaO reacted with the moisture of the atmospheric air that fills the XRD chamber. This was confirmed by the XRD analyses (Fig. S7, ESI†) performed on a BaO sample after two weeks of exposure to ambient moisture. These results showed that BaO was completely transformed into orthorhombic Ba(OH)2(H2O) (barium dihydroxide hydrate). This fact is of major importance for the up-scaling of this process. Operation in moisture-isolated systems will be necessary, since humid air will cause the transformation of BaO into barium hydroxide species. This fact can be a serious issue considering the melting temperatures of such compounds, for instance, for Ba(OH)2 it is 408 °C, while for Ba(OH)2·8H2O it is lowered down to 78 °C.33 Nevertheless, with careful sample-handling and utilizing a moisture-free system, like the thermobalance used in this study, it is possible to work during prolonged cycling with high stability as demonstrated in the results depicted in Fig. 9.

(b) 30-redox cycles carried out on the pre-calcined BaO2 sample using Tmax of 850 °C and Tmin of 400 °C under an air flow of 100 ml min−1. Heating and cooling rates of 10 and 5 °C min−1 respectively. 

Fig. 9a shows a comparison of several redox cycles performed on the sample without and with thermal pre-treatment. It can be observed that redox conversions increased for the pre-calcined sample. Namely, the extension of weight gain/loss was 9.18% higher. Although an accurate value for the conversion cannot be given since the purity of this calcined sample is unknown, we estimate that the conversion will be ca. 99%. The beneficial influence of the pre-treatment was further confirmed by running a 30-redox cycle analysis (Fig. 9b). This material was able to withstand 30 cycles without loss of reversibility, showing after the first two cycles, stable oxidation and reduction reactions. These results showed that elimination of carbonate-based impurities contained in the commercial sample was possible by a thermal pre-treatment, resulting in a material that presented high redox reversibility over prolonged cycling.
Oxidation kinetics
In order to obtain further insight into BaO oxidation, a kinetic analysis was performed based on isothermal TGA experiments. To avoid the undesired formation of barium hydroxides, BaO was synthesized in situ (see the Experimental section for more details). The rate of a gas–solid reaction is generally described as: (4)where α is the conversion fraction, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the apparent activation energy, R is the gas constant and f(α) is the equation describing the dependence of rate on α. The most representative models for solid-state reactions are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).34 As TGA is used to study the reaction, α is defined as: (5)where m0 is the initial weight, mt is the weight at time t and mf is the final weight.
Isothermal or dynamic methods are usually used to extract kinetic data (variation of α with time and temperature), and their advantages and disadvantages have been compared in the literature.35 In this case, isothermal methods were chosen to study the oxidation reaction in isothermal runs by varying the oxidation temperature from 350 to 650 °C. This will also ease the determination of f(α) by using the so-called Master Plots.36 Once the kinetic model was obtained, it was possible to determine the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the oxidation reaction, by taking natural logarithms on both sides of eqn (4), and the following equation is obtained: (6) Thus, by plotting the left term of eqn (6)vs. 1/T the Ea can be determined from the slope of the curve.

Fig. 10 depicts the α–time plots for the BaO oxidation at various temperatures and it shows that BaO oxidation presents Arrhenius behaviour for T ≤ 450 °C. In this range, the higher the temperature, the faster the reaction is. In addition, the progressive acceleration accounts for the entire extent of reaction. For T < 375 °C the reaction did not reach full conversion in the 3 h assay. Interestingly, these α–t plots did not exhibit a sigmoidal shape, which is described by an induction period at the reaction beginning, followed by an acceleratory stage and ending with a deceleratory phase close to full conversion.37 Sigmoidal shapes are usually related to nucleation and growth mechanisms. In this case, for BaO oxidation at T ≤ 450 °C, the reaction rate remained almost constant indicative of a linear kinetic model.34
 Fig. 10  Conversion versus time plots for BaO oxidation (a) isothermal runs at T = 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425 and 450 °C and at (b) T = 450, 500, 550, 650 °C. 
Conversely, for T > 450 °C, the reaction experienced a decrease in the rate. As observed in Fig. 10b, at 500 °C, the reaction reached full conversion after 200 min, whereas at 450 °C, BaO oxidation took only 30 min. A further increase in the temperature (550 and 600 °C) produced an incomplete conversion in the time assayed. Curiously, the rate decrease observed for T > 450 °C had little effect for α < 0.4. It could be expected that the deceleration accounts for the whole extent of reaction, but oxidation just became very slow in the last half of the assay. Anyhow, the decrease of the oxidation rate with temperature indicated that at T > 450 °C such reaction followed a non-Arrhenius behaviour. Several reports of non-Arrhenius behaviour have been found in the literature,38,39 especially in the case of kinetics of gas–solid reversible reactions at high temperatures.40,41 Those studies observed that an increase in the temperature of the assays caused a decrease in the backward reaction rate. This matches well the BaO oxidation with air. For reversible redox reactions, the high-temperature oxidation deceleration has been attributed to the influence of the reverse reaction,7,40,41 or to external-mass transfer hurdles.40 The use of the Arrhenius equation for modelling the temperature dependence in gas–solid reactions has been the subject of discussion in the scientific community.42 In this case, the aforementioned effects produced a remarkable deceleration, namely by just increasing T from 450 to 500 °C the reaction showed an almost six-fold slower rate.
From the data extracted from these isothermal tests it was possible to determine the kinetic model that the oxidation follows by utilizing a set of theoretical kinetic curves of the Master Plot36 (Fig. S10; construction of master plots is detailed in the ESI†). By representing the experimental data from these isothermal runs it is possible to discern in a very simple way which mechanism (or mechanisms) fits better to a specific reaction. Fig. 11a shows a master plot based on the integrated form of the rate equation (see ESI† for more details) and the normalized experimental data extracted from the isothermal test at 375 °C. It can be observed that experimental data fits well with the zero-order model (F0), confirming the linear model trend (this applies well for the other assayed temperatures). However, for α > 0.8, the experimental data progressively moved away from the F0 theoretical curve, which suggests that a second mechanism could take place at high conversions. This is consistent with two consecutive oxygen uptakes observed when performing oxidation under dynamic instead of isothermal conditions. However, with this preliminary kinetic analysis it was not possible at this point to determine which mechanism follows BaO oxidation during the last part of the reaction. The linear model nature of the BaO oxidation agrees well with results reported in Fig. 5b and c. There it was observed that faster cooling rates produced faster oxidation reactions. The F0 model states that the oxidation rate remains constant, with no acceleratory and deceleratory events.

In addition, knowledge of the kinetic model could also help in explaining the reaction rate decay observed at high temperatures. As explained above, oxidation seems to be well-described by a reaction-order model in which BaO2 formation progressed constantly with time. This implies that oxidation starts at the surface of the BaO particle and a BaO2 layer is being progressively created growing towards the particle core until the particle is totally transformed into BaO2. It is suggested that at high temperatures the external layer of the recently formed BaO2 impedes a fast diffusion of oxygen anions through the bulk of the particle, likely because the backward diffusion from the core shell to the gas phase becomes more relevant under these conditions. This could explain why at low conversions (for α < 0.4, Fig. 10b) the reaction exhibited the same rate for the formation of BaO2 at 450 and 650 °C. However, when more than 40% (for α ≥ 0.4) of the particles have been transformed into BaO2, such layer started to act as a barrier that hampered the oxidation reaction.
Finally, an Arrhenius plot was built in order to determine the apparent activation energy. Building an Arrhenius plot from data extracted at high temperatures (T > 450 °C) will result in a positive slope curve, that is, a negative Ea. Therefore, the plot was done for T ≤ 450 °C and for 0.1 ≤ α ≤ 0.8, as it is the zone that fits well with the aforementioned model. Ea calculated from the Arrhenius plots, such as the one depicted in Fig. 11b, exhibited a value of 96.2 ± 5 kJ mol−1. Fahim and Ford7 reported 52 kJ mol−1 for this reaction, which is almost half of the value obtained in this work.
Conclusions
In this paper the feasibility of using the BaO2–BaO redox couple for thermochemical heat storage applications was revisited. It was demonstrated that the oxidation conversion can be enhanced by thermal pre-treatment of the sample at high temperatures, improving the overall performance due to elimination of carbonate impurities accumulated in the fresh sample. This indicates that high-purity BaO2 materials could show even better performance. This work has proven that this redox couple is a good candidate for thermochemical heat storage applications since commercially available BaO2 showed redox reversibility over long-term tests (30 cycles) with stable reduction and oxidation rate values and working at more moderate temperatures than other redox pairs proposed for this application. Furthermore, the energy density of this system (390 kJ kg−1) is quite attractive for TCS applications. Finally, this work reflects that there is still room for further improvement by applying morphological or chemical modifications that could ultimately enhance the TCS performance of this system.
