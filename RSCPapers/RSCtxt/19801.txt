    , Accepted 14th August 2018First published on 17th August 2018AbstractThis work reported that novel highly oriented and vertically aligned stoichiometric copper- and zinc-based ferrites, i.e., Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 quantum dots (QDs) anchored with TiO2 nanotube array electrode (NAE) composites, with n–n nano-heterojunctions and highly effective simulated solar light harvesting could be successfully achieved via electrochemical anodization followed by a vacuum-assisted impregnation strategy. It has been observed that Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites exhibit distinctly enhanced visible light photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance toward the degradation of typical pollutants including sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and methylene blue (MB) as compared to that of pristine TiO2 NAEs, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of heterostructures with strong interfacial interaction and abundant 1D nanotube array structures to facilitate efficient spatial charge separation and interfacial transfers. The cocatalyst-anchoring of ternary oxides with derived spinel crystal structures onto nanotube arrays forming novel nanocomposites have obviously achieved remarkably enhanced photoelectrochemical (PE) conversion efficiencies, up to a dedicated value of 3.75%, under visible light irradiation as compared to that of 0.88% for aligned standalone TiO2 NAEs. Transient absorption spectroscopy quantitatively indicated long-lived photo-holes with lifetimes exceeding 72.23 μs generated among Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE nanocomposites. Electron spinning resonance (ESR) demonstrated that more ˙O2− species derived from molecular uptake played the predominant role in the PEC oxidations of SMX and MB species. Moreover, the binding energy of the onset edge (Evf) and Fermi level (Ef) of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs indicated that Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs modification could considerably enhance the visible light harvesting and adsorption properties of TiO2 NTs. Furthermore, Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs achieved up to 50% PEC degradation efficiency and 52.4% COD removal with regard to practical textile wastewater when irradiated by simulated sunlight. This work has provided new insights into the molecular tailing and coupling of multiple spinels with TiO2 NTs possessing remarkable visible light harvesting and sensitization characteristics, which would offer a prospective strategy toward designing highly efficient and easily recyclable photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation and solar energy utilizations and conversions both simultaneously and standalone.
1. Introduction
It has been well recognized that increasingly serious energy and environmental crises are being encountered all over the world nowadays.1 The utility of renewable energy has currently received increased attention across all countries.2,3 Currently, highly effective utilization of solar energy for environmental eliminations and green energy conversion are the critical challenges, and one of the best countermeasures is to rationally design efficient solar light harvesting nanomaterials with excellent activity, stability, and recyclability.4,5 Novel 1D6 nanostructures of self-ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays7 have fomented considerable scientific interest with their outstanding properties such as impressive photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PE) performances since they were first reported in 1999.8 They have a wide range of applications in photocatalysis,9–11 solar cells,12 water splitting for the generation of hydrogen,13 Li-ion batteries,14,15 supercapacitors,16 and antibacterial devices.17 As compared to TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 NTs are more efficient toward solar energy conversion and photodegradation because of their precisely oriented nature, high surface area, and strong mechanical strength, which are more suitable for electrocatalytic fields on account of better electronic conductivity.18 TiO2 NTs can be fabricated by sol–gel synthesis,19 chemical treatments,20 and electrodeposition techniques.21 Among them, the simple in situ anodization method has been verified as one of the best methods to construct self-organized highly ordered TiO2 NTs.22
However, there are two major obstacles to restrict future applications of TiO2 in terms of highly effective solar energy harvesting and complete utilization.23 (1) Because of the wide bandgap (3.2 eV), it is only excited by ultraviolet light,24 which forms only about 4–5% of the solar spectrum. (2) Photogenerated electron–hole pairs can easily recombine, ultimately leading to poor quantum efficiency.25 Although considerable work has been expended on techniques such as dye sensitization,26 metal deposition,27 and nonmetal atoms doping18 to improve the range of excited light, a few disadvantages also exist (e.g., thermal instability). Recently, a well-defined combination of TiO2 with narrow-bandgap semiconductor oxides has been considered as a promising strategy in tremendously enhancing simulated sunlight-induced activity, stability, and recyclability, as well as increasing the interfacial charge separation efficiency, both simultaneously and standalone.9,13
Spinel is an important class of narrow-bandgap mixed-metal oxides and has two different structures: normal spinel and inverse spinel. They possess two different crystal lattice sites, namely, tetrahedral (A-) sites and octahedral (B-) sites, coordinated with four and six oxygen anions, respectively. The full occupation of the A-sites by divalent metallic cations and B-sites by Fe3+ ions could induce a normal spinel structure rather than an inverted one.28 The general chemical composition formula of AB2O4 with either normal and/or inverted spinel structures has been reported to have novel characteristics such as better catalytic and electrochemical performances and magnetic properties.29 It has now been well recognized that a well-defined combination of TiO2 NTs with ferrites in position of the spinel structure, including MFe2O4-modified TiO2 (M = Ni, Co, Zn, Fe, and Sr),30,31 could form multiple heterostructures, followed by tremendously enhancing simulated sunlight-induced PE and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activities, stability, and recyclability, as well as improving the spatial charge separation efficiency, both simultaneously and standalone. The nano-heterojunctions between TiO2 NTs and dual ferrites have been identified to play a significant role in the highly effective harvesting and utilization of solar energy.32
Recently, the molecular tailing of the ferrite family, including the partial doping of M2+ (M = Mg, Cu, etc.) onto tetrahedral Zn2+ occupation site of spinel-structured ZnFe2O4 with the outcomes of incurring ternary oxides, has drawn considerable attention due to its novel physicochemical properties such as improved catalytic properties and PE performance arising from its diverse structures (e.g., specific spinel structure, microstructure, nano-heterojunction, and interfacial electronic structures).33 In 2015, we reported that Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 quantum dots (QDs)/TiO2 nanotube array electrodes (NAEs) synthesized by ultrasound-assisted impregnation could effectively enhance the photoconversion efficiency,34 and similar composites including Zn0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4@TiO2 NAEs prepared by an ultrasonically assisted electrodeposition strategy could also effectively harvest and utilize solar energy.35 Among other spinel ferrites, recent reports have revealed that doping Cu2+ onto partially substituted tetrahedral Zn2+ sites of ZnFe2O4 could considerably broaden the absorption spectrum, followed by enhancing the intensity of the emission spectrum due to different electronegativity and radius values as compared to Zn2+ (Cu2+ (0.72 Å), Zn2+ (0.74 Å)), as well as partial crystal derivations of the spinel structure in ternary ferrites.36 Moreover, when compared with nonstoichiometric Cu1−xZnxFe2O4 ternary ferrites, Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 has much higher specific saturation magnetizations and better catalytic properties due to the specifically derived crystal structures,37 which could further reduce the symmetry of the crystal field followed by inducing Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 to harvest a larger portion of the visible light from the entire solar spectrum.38,39 Therefore, as a more promising material, Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 has now been recognized to act as an important antenna molecule sensitive to visible light. On the whole, by referring to the specially derived structure and multiple spatial spinel structures of ternary Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite composites, the well-confined molecular tailing and coupling of TiO2 NAEs with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanomaterials (including QDs) can be regarded as a pioneer approach in tremendously enhancing simulated sunlight-induced energy utilization and conversion activity, as well as improving the interfacial charge separation efficiency, both simultaneously and standalone. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have been published so far regarding the use of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites and their novel PE and PEC characteristics in terms of highly effective harvesting of solar energy for green solar energy conversion and environmental eliminations.
In the present paper, we report the rational design, synthesis, characterization, and sunlight-derived PE and PEC properties of a novel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composite by using a vacuum-assisted impregnation approach. The morphology and the structural, optical, electrical, PE, and PEC properties of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites and the photoinduced redox reactions (including interfacial charge carrier behaviors) have been systematically elucidated and investigated. It can be observed that novel composites with n–n nanojunctions exhibit fairly enhanced PE conversion efficiency up to a dedicated value of 3.75% under visible light irradiation as compared to 0.88% for aligned standalone TiO2 NTs. Various modern physical techniques have now been employed to elucidate photoinduced interfacial redox processes over Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites. Transient absorption spectroscopy quantitatively determined the long-lived photo-holes with lifetimes exceeding 72.23 μs generated among Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites. Electron spinning resonance (ESR) demonstrated that more ˙O2− species played the predominant role in the PE oxidation of typical pollutants, including sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and methylene blue (MB) species, at the laboratory level. Moreover, the binding energy of the onset edge (Evf) and Fermi level (Ef) of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs indicated that the modification of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs can considerably enhance the visible light harvesting and adsorption properties of TiO2 NTs. In particular, novel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites have been successfully utilized for practical wastewater eliminations, and our results clearly indicate that up to 50% PEC degradation efficiency and 52.4% COD removal of textile wastewater were achieved when irradiated by simulated sunlight. This work has provided a brand new insight into molecular tailing including the anchoring of multiple spinels with TiO2 NTs possessing excellent visible light harvesting and sensitization characteristics, which would offer a prospective strategy toward designing highly efficient and easily recyclable PEC materials for environmental remediation and solar energy utilization and conversions, both simultaneously and standalone.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites
All the chemicals were analytical-grade reagents that were used without further treatment and their solutions were prepared with ultrapure water. Self-organized TiO2 NAEs were first fabricated by the anodization of Ti foil in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with titanium foil as the working electrode and platinum foil as the counter-electrode as previously described by our group.40
The Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites were designed and prepared by a novel vacuum-assisted impregnation approach (Scheme 1). The 0.1 M precursor included stoichiometric amounts of zinc nitrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O], cuprous nitrate [Cu(NO3)2·6H2O], and ferric nitrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O] (ratio: 1:1:4) dissolved in a volume of a mixture solution (100 mL) containing citric acid (1:1.2, molar ratio of the total metal nitrates and citric acid in the solution) as the coordinate agent and ethylene glycol as the solvent agent (1:4, molar ratio of the total metal nitrates and ethylene glycol). The pH value of the precursor was adjusted by adding ammonia solution dropwise to 9. The chemical reaction was maintained at a temperature of 80 °C for 2 h under continuous stirring until the sol formed. Subsequently, TiO2 NAEs were vertically immersed in the precursor for 10 min under 1 × 10−3 Pa in a vacuum. As soon as the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites were taken out, they were dried immediately at 110 °C for 10 min. This procedure was repeated 5 times. Finally, after the reaction was completed, the sample was annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites.

2.2. Characterization
A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (HITACHI UHR FE-SEM SU8000 Series, SU8010) was used to characterize the morphology of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) (FESEM, Nova Nano SEM 450, USA) were employed to characterize the dopant concentration and to determine the elemental distribution on the catalyst granules. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)41 and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai F30 at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the crystallinity of the sample was carried out with a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (D/Max 2400, Japan Science Co., Ltd). The diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range from 20° to 60° at a scan speed of 2° min−1. The ultraviolet-visible diffusion reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) were recorded by a UV-vis spectrometer (JASCO, UV-550) in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm to measure the absorption property. A Hitachi F-4500 (excited at λ = 325 nm) fluorescence spectrophotometer was utilized to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the electrode surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) (PHI 5600 mode) examined the surface properties and composition of the sample. All the binding energies were calibrated by using carbon (C 1s, 284.6 eV) as the reference. A surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system was used to test the separation characteristics of the photogenerated charge carriers, which consisted of a monochromator (model Omni-λ 3005) and a lock-in amplifier (model SR830-DSP) with an optical chopper (model SR540) running at a frequency of 20 Hz. A transient photovoltage (TPV) curve was recorded by using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix) and excited with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength: 355 nm; pulse width: 5 ns; power: about 50 μJ) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Q-smart 450 Compact Q-switched Nd:YAG laser). Transient formation and subsequent decay of the photogenerated electrons and holes over the as-prepared samples were characterized using a laser flash photolysis spectrometer (LP920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, UK). The excitation and probing light sources of the nanosecond LFP spectrometer were Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and 450 W continuous/pulse xenon lamp (ozone-free), respectively. The PL spectra of the electrodes were collected using a Hitachi F-4500 (excited at λ = 325 nm) fluorescence spectrophotometer in air at room temperature. The optical absorption spectra were determined upon different light exposure durations using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Mikropack DH-2000 with USB4000 detector from Ocean Optics) in order to monitor the rate of degradation by recording the reduction in the absorption intensity of MB at the maximum wavelength (λmax = 615 nm).
Chromatographic experiments with the LCMS-2010A system were used for the acquisition of the LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) data. The mobile phase consisted of two solutions. Solution A was methyl alcohol, whereas solution B was made from 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution. Separations were performed using Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column 21 × 100 mm at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min−1. The detection system was a diode array detector (Agilent, USA) with a detection range between 200 and 780 nm. The gradient HPLC separation was coupled with an ion-trap mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies), while the mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization source and operated in positive polarity. The mass spectrometer settings for MS analyses were a capillary voltage of 2.8 kV, extraction voltage of 4.0 V, cone voltage of 40 V, source temperature of 90 °C, deionization temperature of 150 °C, and drying gas flow of 200 L h−1. The mass spectra were recorded over a scan range of 40–800 m/z. Electron spinning resonance (ESR) signals of the radicals, spin-trapped by the spin-trap reagent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), were recorded with ECS106 X-band spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The light source was supported by a 500 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter. The typical parameters were set as follows: the center field is 3400 G, sweep width is 300 G, frequency is 9.865 GHz, temperature is 25 °C, modulation amplitude is 1.00 G, and microwave power is 20 mW. The same quartz capillary tube was used to minimize the measurement errors. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature of 25 ± 2 °C.
2.3. PEC performance tests
PEC measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode cell configuration with a flat quartz window to facilitate the illumination of the photoelectrode surface in the galvanostatic mode. The Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites served as the photoanode, Pt foil functioned as the counter-electrode, while saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was the reference electrode.42 A 0.1 M Na2SO4 (80 mL) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A 500 W Xe lamp (Phillips 500 W) served as the simulated sunlight source. The light was passed through a glass filter that allowed wavelengths between 450 and 550 nm to be incident on the photoanode at a measured intensity of 33 mW cm−2. A 6 cm2 region of the photoelectrode surface was illuminated. SMX and MB (C16H18N3SCl, MB) solutions were chosen as the ionic materials. Fig. S1† shows the standard curve of the SMX and MB solutions. The practical textile wastewater used in this study was collected daily during a 1-week period in the summer from the equalization storage tank of a personal textile manufacturer (Shandong Sunflower Textile Manufactures Co., Ltd). The textile wastewater had a chemical oxygen demand of 515 mg L−1, pH of 7.37, and turbidity of 60 NTU. Every experiment was repeated 3 times for ensuring reliability.43
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure
To characterize the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples, the SEM, EDS, and EDS mapping of Ti, Zn, Cu, and Cu were performed. A typical SEM image of pure TiO2 NAEs is shown in Fig. 1a. Highly ordered NAEs are evident with a wall thickness of about 20 nm. The average inner diameter of pristine self-organized TiO2 NTs was about 80 nm and the outer diameter was about 100 nm. The cross-sectional view indicated that the arrays were composed of highly oriented and well-aligned NTs. In contrast, from the top and cross-sectional (Fig. 1b and c) views of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, the deposited QDs were mainly surrounding the entrance of the top tubes without clogging. The corresponding elemental mapping images of Cu, Fe, Zn, and Ti of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites clearly indicated that the TiO2 NTs were uniformly decorated with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs (approximate diameter: 10 nm, inset).
 Fig. 1  (a) Top-view SEM image of TiO2 NAEs (inset: cross-sectional image of TiO2 NAEs); (b), (c) top and cross-sectional images of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs; (d) EDS spectrum of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (inset: table with the weight and atomic percentage of each element) and corresponding elemental mapping images of Cu, Fe, Zn, and Ti of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. 
EDS and EDS mappings confirmed the Zn, Cu, and Fe contents as 1.66%, 1.81%, and 7.31%, respectively. Obviously, the metal ions are uniformly distributed onto the surface of TiO2 NAEs and the stoichiometric molar ratios of Cu, Fe, and Zn are determined as 1:1:4, which further confirms the formation of spinel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4.
Additionally, we have also investigated the effect of different working conditions including the substrate's initial concentration, solution pH, and the number of repeating cycles on the morphology of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites. Fig. S2† shows the SEM images of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs caused by different concentrations of the mixture solutions (0.00 CZF (pure TiO2), 0.06 CZF (0.03 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.03 M Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.12 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), 0.1 CZF (0.05 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.05 M Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.2 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), 0.14 CZF (0.07 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.07 M Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and 0.28 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O)). The SEM images indicated that with increasing concentrations of the mixture solutions, more Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs could preferentially be loaded onto the top tubes. However, it is evident that a higher concentration of the precursor (above 0.1 M) will definitely block the nanotubes. Evidently, while the precursor concentration reached up to 0.14 M, TiO2 NTs were almost being blocked. Therefore, we performed the following experiments with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs at a concentration of 0.1 M. It is well known that the surface of TiO2 is amphoteric, and consequently, the charge of the surface is pH-dependent. The effect of pH over the charge of the surface is shown in Fig. S3.† Obviously, a low pH value would lead to lower crystallinity. At pH = 2, the wall of the tubes become thicker and no QDs can be observed. With an increase in the pH value, Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs obviously get uniformly coated onto the top of the tubes. Furthermore, the SEM images at pH = 9 and 11 reveal only minor differences. Fig. S4† showed the outcomes of different number of cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). It can be seen that as the deposition cycles approach more than 5 repetitions, TiO2 NTs get completely blocked; conversely, implementing less than 5 repetitions could yield partial Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs highly dispersed into the internal and external sides of TiO2 NTs. Therefore, according to the SEM images, the optimal concentration, pH, and cycle numbers for the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites were 0.1 M, 9, and 5 repetitions, respectively.
The TEM images (Fig. 2) of the sample species powder-scraped from the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, which were self-assembled on the Ti substrate, reveal that the as-prepared composite electrodes consist of highly oriented well-defined NTs, and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs were uniformly deposited on the inner tubes. The corresponding HRTEM image of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs loaded onto TiO2 NAEs from the selected area (Fig. 2d) demonstrate that the lattice spacing is about 0.35 nm, which can be ascribed to the preferred oriented (101) planes of anatase TiO2. The lattice fringes of 0.206 nm and 0.296 nm correspond to the reflections from the (400) and (220) planes of spinel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 77-0012), respectively. Meanwhile, it can be observed from the HRTEM images (Fig. 2(d)) that the overlapping and derivations of the oriented crystal faces could form mutual cross-sections and incur n–n heterojunctions between ferrite QDs and titania NTs among Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites, which would favor an increase in the interfacial charge transfers and retarding the spatial recombinations of photogenerated charge carriers, both extremely and simultaneously. The Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs exhibited a narrow size distribution with an average crystallite size of about 10 nm, which were uniformly deposited on the internal and external sides of the TiO2 tubes; this is in good agreement with the SEM analysis. It is, therefore, concluded that Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs have been successfully loaded onto the tube arrays, and the deposition of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs onto TiO2 NAEs would be very beneficial for further enhancing the segregation of charge carriers, followed by remarkably increasing the quantum efficiency of the photoinduced redox process over the composites.
 Fig. 2  TEM (a, b, c), HRTEM (d), (e), and XRD (f) images of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites. Inset of (e) shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image. 
From Fig. 2e, it is evident that the lattice fringes of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites were obviously distorted, tending to be disordered. Moreover, the highlighted ring pattern of the SAED image (inset of Fig. 2e) showed obvious polycrystallization. The TEM analysis clearly indicated that the surface lattice distortion of the as-prepared samples can be formed when Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs coupled with TiO2. It was reported that the thin disordered layer on the TiO2 surface can induce an upshift in the VB edge.44–46 Therefore, it is anticipated that the surface lattice distortion and polycrystallization would cause an upshift in the VB edge, which may result in remarkably reducing its optical bandgap, as revealed by the XPS analysis of the VB.
The XRD patterns of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs have been studied in comparison with that of pristine TiO2 (Fig. 2f). The diffraction peaks of Ti were in good agreement with the standard diffraction pattern of Ti sheet (JCPDS card no. 05-0682). However, the diffraction peak of pure TiO2 NTs (2θ = 25.3° and 48.1°) possess the crystal structure of (101) and (220) planes, demonstrating that the TiO2 NTs have a perfect anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1272). Obviously, for Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, all the peaks corresponding to Ti, TiO2, and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 could be observed; the five broadened diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.1°, 35.5°, 47.2°, 53.5°, and 57.0° can be indexed to the (220), (311), (331), (422), and (511) crystallographic planes of spinel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 77-0012), respectively. From earlier reports,47,48 it can be inferred that specific spectral variations including peak shifting, broadening, and splitting of the XRD patterns of the composites were mainly induced by crystal distortions as derived from the partial substitution of the tetrahedral ion sites of the spinel structures and quantum size effect, which further confirmed the small size of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs.49,50
The XRD diffraction peak near 35° and the sharp peak near 53° were attributed to the overlapping and accumulation of the Ti sheet (35.3°), and the two XRD peaks centered at 35.4° and 53.4° can be assigned to spinel ferrite; however, the XRD peak at 53.1° can be dedicated to the Ti sheet. All the XRD diffraction peaks were well indexed to Ti, TiO2, or Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4, which clearly indicated Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 has been successfully loaded onto pristine TiO2 NTs via semiconductor surface derivations. Meanwhile, there were some overlaps of the crystal faces to form cross-sections and heterojunctions between ferrite QDs and titania NTs, which will be very beneficial for interfacial charge transfers and photoinduced redox processes over the composites.
Furthermore, the surface composition and chemical valence states of the composite NT arrays were probed by XPS (Fig. S5†). The XPS spectrum of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs reveals the presence of Fe 2p, Zn 2p, Cu 2p, and Ti 2p elements in the composites. The peaks in the C 1s spectrum are mainly due to the adventitious adsorbed or bonded carbon from the sample fabrication and/or the XPS instrument itself. More specifically, as revealed by the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p (Fig. S5b†), the characteristic peaks located at the binding energies of 464.5 and 458.8 eV were assigned to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, respectively,21 which are attributable to Ti4+ ions. The accompanying satellite peaks centered around 711.1 and 725.1 eV are indicative of the presence of Fe3+ cations, which were attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 (Fig. S5c†), respectively. However, no Fe2+ peak has been observed and identified. Three main peaks at 933.9, 942.3, and 953.8 eV (Fig. S5d†) corresponded to the Cu 2p3/2, Cu satellite, and Cu 2d1/2 binding energies, respectively. This indicates that Cu exists in the Cu2+ oxidation state in the composite electrode. In addition, 1044.4 and 1021.5 eV correspond to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. S5e†).51 Furthermore, the peak for O 1s in the composites was obviously asymmetric (Fig. S5f†) and can be deconvoluted into three small peaks at 532.7, 531.0, and 531.4 eV after fitting with the Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes, which were attributed to the adsorbed oxygen, O element in TiO2, and oxygen vacancies, respectively.9,52 Consequently, the corresponding composition by XPS analysis revealed the atomic ratio as Fe:Zn:Cu = 15.2:3.71:4.37, indicating that a large amount of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs were successfully obtained.
3.2. Optical properties
UV-vis DRS of TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs are shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption peak at about 385 nm was clearly observed, which was in good agreement with the intrinsic bandgap absorption of anatase TiO2. In addition, TiO2 NAEs showed much higher absorption in the ultraviolet region than P25. After coating with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs, the samples exhibited increased absorption in 200–700 nm and the band edges were shifted toward the visible light region (red-shift), which suggested that the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QDs-tailed NT arrays exhibited higher visible light harvesting and response than those of the non-doped TiO2 NAEs. The slight absorption of TiO2 NTs in the visible light region can be explained by the light scattering caused by pores or cracks in the NT arrays.53 Further, the two characteristic absorption peaks of pure TiO2 NTs at about 430 nm and 540 nm corresponded to the absorption of the trapped holes and electrons, respectively, which result from the sub-bandgap of the surface defects on TiO2 NTs.54,55 Therefore, by combining the characterization results of XRD and XPS, a better PE capability of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs under visible light was assumed. As observed from the SEM images, the red-shift band-edge comparison between Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs and TiO2 NAEs can be attributed to the electronic interactions among TiO2 NTs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4, as well as the rearrangement of the energy levels of TiO2.56

(b) Corresponding plots of (αhν)0.5vs. νs. hν and (αhν)2vs. hν for the estimation of the optical bandgaps of P25, TiO2 NAEs, and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. (c) VB XPS spectra of TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. (d) Mott–Schottky plots for TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QD/TiO2 NAE electrodes. Counter-electrode: Pt. Reference electrode: SCE. Electrolyte: 0.01 M Na2SO4. Frequency: 10 Hz. 
The Tauc formula was used to calculate the bandgap of the samples: (αhν)n = k(hν − Eg)(1)where α, Eg, hν, and k represent the absorption coefficient, bandgap of the material, photon energy, and Planck's constant, respectively. Further, n is 2 or 1/2 depending on the indirect or direct transition for the material, respectively.57 Obviously, the bandgaps of P25, TiO2, and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs were evaluated to be about 3.18, 3.08, and 2.38 eV, respectively, from the intercepts (Fig. 3b). These data provided more quantitative information about their photo-absorption performance.
XPS is a commonly used technique to determine the valence band maximum (VBM) of a semiconductor.45 The VB plots are shown in Fig. 3c. The VBM of the prepared samples were determined by the linear extrapolation method and found to be 2.56 and 1.34 eV for TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, respectively. The positions of the conduction band minimum (CBM) could be determined on the basis of the results of the bandgap energy and VBM. In Fig. 3c, the VBM of TiO2 was found to be 2.56 eV, which is in good agreement with the reported value.44 This shows an upward shift to 1.34 eV, which may be attributed to the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs doping in TiO2 NAEs, which would induce additional molecular orbitals above the VBM and below the CBM by narrowing the bandgap. Consequently, the remarkable bandgap narrowing of the modified samples (3.08 vs. 2.38 eV) was caused by the substantial shifts in the VB tails, and the values would decrease further due to the predicted CB tailing.
When the semiconductors were in contact with the electrolyte because of differences in their electronic chemical potentials, the contact area of the solid–liquid phase is bound to cause a redistribution of the charge, resulting in extra charge near the surface area to form a space charge layer. Because the Helmholtz and diffusion layer capacitance values are considerably high, the total electrode capacitance was, therefore, mainly dependent on the space charge capacitance.58 By applying an external voltage, the voltage drop is mainly occurring in the space charge area of the oxidation film. After adjusting the applied voltage to concentrate the space charge carriers in the depletion state, the relationship of the space charge region capacitance (Csc) and applied voltage (E) can be calculated from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plots according to the below equation:59 (2)where C is the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, Nd is the donor concentration, and ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1). Further, A is the contact area, V is the applied potential, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), T is the temperature, e is the fundamental charge constant (1.602 × 10−19 C), and VFB is about 25 mV under room temperature (which can be usually ignored). The capacitance measurements on the electrode/electrolyte were conducted at 1 kHz.
It should be noted that the slopes of the linear sections of the curves in the Mott–Schottky plots were positive (Fig. 3c), implying that the samples were n-type semiconductors. The flat-band potential (VFB) values were determined as −0.28 V and 0.10 V (vs. SCE) for TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, respectively. Because the SCE potential is 0.245 V relative to that of NHE at 25 °C, the EFB value of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs increased up to 0.345 V. Importantly, the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs showed substantially smaller slopes of the Mott–Schottky plot as compared to that of TiO2 NAEs, suggesting an increase in the donor densities. The enhanced donor density was due to the increased oxygen vacancies, which were known to be an electron donor for TiO2. The increased donor density improved the charge carrier transport in TiO2, as well as the electron transfer at the interface between the semiconductor and the Ti substrate. Moreover, it is known that a negative shift is indicative of an upward shift in CB, and vice versa.60 A downward shift in CB facilitates charge separation at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface by increasing the degree of band-bending at the TiO2 surface. The enhanced charge separation and transportation were believed to be the major reasons for the observed PEC enhancement in the UV region.58 The positive shift in VFB indicated that the carrier interfacial transfer of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs with n–n nano-heterojunctions was faster than that of TiO2 NAEs, leading to superior PE and PEC performances of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. Further, it can be inferred from previous reports that both the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 crystal distortions as derived from partial ion site substitutions and n–n nano-heterojunctions between Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs and TiO2 NTs may synergistically contribute toward the improved charge carrier generation and segregation in an efficient manner.47,61
As a result, the nano-heterojunction derived from the molecular tailing of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs towards TiO2 NAEs promised a remarkable charge carrier separation efficiency and marvelous PE and PEC performances.
3.3. Kinetic behaviors
The SPV, TPV, and surface PL can reveal the kinetic behaviors of the photogenerated charge carriers in the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs and TiO2 NAE samples.62,63 The SPV spectra (Fig. 4a) demonstrated a wide, active spectral range of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs doped onto TiO2 NAEs. In this figure, TiO2 NAEs emit a photoelectric signal between 300 nm and 380 nm, which was ascribed to the electron transition from the VB to the CB of TiO2 (O 2p/Ti 3d).21 As compared to TiO2 NAEs, the SPV signals were more distinguished and their performances were evidently higher between 300 nm and 380 nm after loading with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs, as well as that in the visible area. The SPV signal can be attributed to the variations in the surface potential barriers during light irradiation, which can identify the light-responsive wavelength range and the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pairs in the photocatalytic materials.64,65 Hence, excellent PE and PEC performances can be expected for the composites with n–n nano-heterojunctions.
 Fig. 4  SPV (a), TPV (b), and PL spectra of TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (excitation wavelength: 325 nm for the samples). 
By using TPV measurements, after top illumination under the laser pulse at 355 nm, we found that the TPV curves of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE samples were more positive as compared to those of TiO2 NAEs (Fig. 4b), which indicated that photogenerated electrons were transferred toward the bottom electrode.64,65 Further, the intensity of the photovoltage of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs was higher than that of pure TiO2 NAEs, contributing toward the faster separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over the nano-heterojunction of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE interface. Typically, the decay of the surface photovoltage intensity of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE sample was significantly slower than that of the TiO2 NAE sample, indicating that the carrier lifetimes in the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE sample was dedicatedly increased. The TPV response curves for both the samples exhibit peaks at 10−6 s, which indicate fast charge separation and accumulation of photogenerated holes. This observation was in good agreement with the large magnitude of efficient charge separation and SPV integration results.
The PL spectra further verified the enhanced photoexcited charge separation efficiency (Fig. 4c). Two weak peaks around 400 nm and 466 nm can be observed, which can be ascribed to TiO2 NAEs with edges of free and bound excitons, respectively. These PL signals were mainly attributed to oxygen vacancies and defects generated on the nanoparticle surface.34,56 It is generally believed that the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NAE's band alignment in the heterostructures can enable reduced charge carrier recombinations, resulting in the quenching effect of PL intensity.10 An abrupt emission quenching was notably observed in the spectra of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites, indicating that the electrons are transferred from excited Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs to TiO2 NAEs.
3.4. PE measurements
The electrochemical properties of TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs were measured in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt foil (counter-electrode) and SCE (reference electrode)42 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under visible light and simulated solar irradiation. Fig. 5a and c show the photocurrent densities vs. voltage (I–V) curves of the TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QD-modified TiO2 NAEs under visible light and simulated solar irradiation, respectively. The photocurrent densities of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs significantly increased under light irradiation. Moreover, under light irradiation, the photocurrent densities increased at first and subsequently decreased. This can be attributed to the internal electrostatic field in the heterojunction region, promoting separation and reducing the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. This enables more charge carriers to participate in the reactions. Fig. 5b and d depicted the photoconversion efficiency images of the TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QD-modified TiO2 NAEs, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent density vs. applied potential (νs. SCE) of TiO2 NAEs (black curve), Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (red curve) under visible light (a), and simulated sunlight irradiation (c), respectively. The corresponding curves of photoconversion efficiency under visible light (b) and simulated sunlight irradiation (d), respectively. 
The photoconversion efficiency could be calculated according to the following formula obtained from the literature:66 (3)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2),  is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of incident light (mW cm−2). Further,  is the standard state-reversible potential (which is 1.23 V νs. NHE for the water-splitting reaction when the pH value reaches 0) and the applied potential is Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (νs. SCE) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (νs. SCE) of the same working electrode. Here, |Eapp| is the absolute value of the applied potential Eapp. It is indicated that after loading Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs, the maximum photoconversion efficiencies of 3.42% and 3.75% were observed at an applied potential of about 0 V νs. SCE for the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QD-loaded TiO2 NT array sample, while they were 0.1% and 0.88% for TiO2/Ti NAEs at −0.2 V νs. SCE under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiations, respectively. The PE conversion efficiency of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QD-loaded TiO2 NAEs was much higher than that of the other composites: the simulated solar photoconversion efficiency of Mg0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NAEs is 2.23%, whereas it is 2.25% for Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NAEs.34,35 It may be due to the fact that both electronegativity and radius are different for Zn2+ (0.74 Å) and Cu2+ (0.72 Å), as well as the catalytic activity of Cu2+ differs. The I–V curve further confirmed that after Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs were loaded, the photoconversion property of the electrode was remarkably enhanced.
Furthermore, the optimal conditions for the preparation of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-QD-loaded TiO2 NAEs were identified in terms of concentration, pH, and number of repeating cycles (Fig. S6–S8,† with the same conditions as described in the SEM characteristics). The results implied that the optimized concentration of the mixture solution is about 0.1 CZF, which reached the highest photocurrent density of about 1.09 eV. When the pH was about 11, the photocurrent density reached the highest value of approximately 1.12 eV. Further, it is evident that the data of the photocurrent density for pH values of 9 and 11 have no glaring differences, which is in good agreement with the SEM characteristics. It was clearly indicated that the repetition of 5 cycles yielded the highest photocurrent density. Therefore, the optimal concentration, pH, and cycle numbers for the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composite were 0.1 M, 9, and 5 repetitions, respectively.
To further investigate the photo-response of the samples, the transient photocurrents of TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs were measured at a fixed bias potential of 0.6 V via several on–off cycles of visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation, respectively (Fig. 6a and b). It is generally recognized that a photocurrent is induced due to the diffusion of photogenerated electrons to the back contact; meanwhile, photogenerated holes are captured by the electron donors in the electrolyte.67 As compared to TiO2 NAEs (0.2 μA cm−2 and 0.15 mA cm−2), the transient photocurrent densities were more than 4 μA cm−2 and 0.65 mA cm−2 for Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation, respectively. This enhanced transient photocurrent density can be attributed to the fact that the nano-heterostructures were successfully built, and the internal confined electrostatic field excellently promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers.13 The superior photocurrent density of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE nano-heterostructure over TiO2 NAEs suggested a longer lifetime of photoexcited electron–hole charge carriers over Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photocurrent density vs. time for Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs measured at 0.6 V vs. SCE for repeated on–off cycles of visible light irradiation (I0 = 30 mW cm−2) and (b) under continuous simulated sunlight irradiation (I0 = 33 mW cm−2). (c) EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 NAEs (black color) and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (blue color) in the dark and TiO2 NAEs (red color) and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (pink color) under visible light under both applied bias and irradiation (0.6 V νs. SCE, I0 = 33 mW cm−2). 
The PE response of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites and TiO2 NAEs were also investigated using EIS to gain a deeper insight into the charge transport behaviors over the nano-heterojunction system (Fig. 6c). Upon irradiation, a semicircle appears in the Nyquist diagram,68 suggesting that the charge transfer resistance controls the kinetics at the electrode interface. Obviously, the impedance of the radius of the TiO2 NAE electrode decreased sharply after Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs loading either in the dark or under light illumination. Due to the increased electron conductivity under irradiation, the arc radii were smaller under light irradiations than that when processing in the dark. The introduction of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs caused a significant decrease in the arc radius, suggesting an increased electron transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode, which indicated that the electro-oxidation rate on Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs was much faster than that of pure TiO2 NAEs.
Overall, the enhanced PEC properties of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE nano-heterojunction were the direct consequence of the synergistic effects of enhanced visible light absorption via Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs sensitization and the band alignment through the electronic structure modification of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs, which was in good agreement with our hypothesis.
3.5. PEC performance
In order to evaluate the PEC activities of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites, we compared the efficiency of SMX and MB degradation using different modified electrodes under the same working conditions.69 The electrochemical process (EP), direct photolysis (DP), photocatalysis (PC), and PEC characteristics of SMX and MB (20 mg L−1) degradation under visible and simulated sunlight irradiations were employed to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of these functionalized catalytic materials. It is known that the synergistic effect between the EC and PC processes results in the improved PEC performance, in which the applied bias potential inhibits the effective recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and prolongs the life of the photogenerated carriers.70 The uptake of SMX and MB was relatively rapid, and it reached equilibrium within 30 min. Fig. 7a, 8a, 7b, and 8b depicted different processes of SMX and MB degradations under visible and simulated sunlight irradiation with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE catalyst. SMX and MB were stable and experience almost no decomposition in the dark. After 120 min visible light irradiation, SMX and MB concentrations in DP, PC, and PEC were reduced by about 15%, 30%, and 70% for SMX and about 14%, 29%, and 66% for MB, respectively. Meanwhile, the reductions in the SMX concentrations were about 25%, 65%, and 75% and MB concentrations were about 18%, 24%, and 72%, respectively, under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photocatalytic activities of the catalyst under visible light can be categorized as follows: PEC > PC > DC > EC, which indicates that there was a synergistic effect between the EC and PC processes.
 Fig. 7  Concentration vs. time plotted for the PEC degradation of SMX by TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs for different processes under visible light irradiation (a), (c) (I0 = 30 mW cm−2, 0.6 V νs. SCE, C0 = 20 mg L−1) and simulated sunlight irradiation (b), (d) (I0 = 33 mW cm−2, 0.6 V νs. SCE, C0 = 20 mg L−1). 
 Fig. 8  Normalized time traces of TiO2 NAEs (a) and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs (b) recorded at a probe wavelength of 550 nm after laser flash photolysis at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm in air. The time-resolved decay curves were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares method with a multicomponent decay law (red line). (c) ESR spectra of radical adducts trapped by DMPO obtained from Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QD/TiO2 NAE DMPO-˙OH formed in irradiated aqueous dispersions; (d) DMPO-˙O2− formed in irradiated methanol dispersions. All the spectra were recorded after 1 min of irradiation with visible light (I0 = 30 mW cm−2). 
As a comparison, ZnFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs and CuFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs were also prepared using the same method, and the PEC degradation of SMX and MB species was tested under the same working conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S9,† after irradiation for 120 min, the concentrations of SMX and MB in pure TiO2 NAEs, ZnFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, CuFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs were reduced by about (63%, 65%, and 70%) and (54%, 52%, and 66%) under visible irradiations and about (70%, 73%, and 75%) and (65%, 63%, and 72%) under simulated sunlight irradiation, respectively. The PEC activities of the catalysts under visible light follow the tendency order, namely, TiO2 NAEs < CuFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs < ZnFe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs < Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs, which indicated that there exist critical electronic interactions between the loaded spinel materials and TiO2 substrates. In particular, at a bias potential of 0.6 V (vs. SCE), Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs exhibited the highest PEC activity. This significant enhancement could be ascribed to the doping of Cu2+ to replace Zn2+ in ZnFe2O4 for a broadened scope of absorption spectrum and enhanced intensity emission spectrum. It is worth noting that only one side of the prepared electrode was exposed to light irradiation, which demonstrates that the prepared sample has a high visible light photocatalytic performance.
3.6. PEC performance mechanism for Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs
In order to reveal the photoinduced reaction mechanism, the kinetics and mechanisms of charge carrier transfer processes were investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy.71 The normalized time traces of the samples were recorded at a probe wavelength of 550 nm after laser flash photolysis at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm in air. The time-resolved emission spectra and decay curves were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares method with a multicomponent decay law, and the respective distribution of the weighted residuals is shown in the bottom panel of the decay curve of each sample. By comparing the normalized time traces of TiO2 NAEs and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs in Fig. 8a and b, the photogenerated holes in Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs displayed a much longer lifetime (72.23 μs) than that of pure TiO2 NAEs (51.49 μs). This demonstrated that Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs modification could effectively prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers, leading to a higher photocurrent for Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites.
From the results of DRS and XPS VB spectrum, we found that the VB of TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 were 2.56 and 1.34 eV, respectively; the respective bandgaps were 3.08 and 2.38 eV. According to the format ECB = Eg − EVB, the CB values of TiO2 and Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 were −0.52 and −1.04 eV, respectively. Further, from Fig. S10,† it is evident that the redox position of H2O/˙OH, 1O2/O2, and O2/˙O2− were 2.2, 1.88, and −0.2 eV, respectively.50 We can suppose that ˙O2− is the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this system. Therefore, in order to detect the active species, such as ROS including hydroxyl ˙OH and superoxide radical ˙O2− species, room-temperature ESR in conjunction with DMPO spin-trap technique was employed to verify the presence of ROS species formed on the electrode with visible light illumination for 1 min. As shown in Fig. 8c and d, there is no characteristic ESR signal in the dark. In Fig. 8c, four weak characteristic peaks (1:2:2:1) of DMPO-˙OH after irradiation with visible light on Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs can be observed, which can be attributed to the exit of the TiO2 NT substrate. From Fig. 9d, six characteristic peaks of the DMPO-˙O2− adducts were also detected.72,73 Furthermore, the peak intensity of DMPO-˙O2− adducts is much higher than that of DMPO-˙OH, which confirms the speculation that a higher amount of ˙O2− reactive species plays an essential role in PEC degradation reactions.

The intermediates of MB degradation during the PEC process (2 h) were monitored by HPLC-MS-MS to gain further insights into the degradation mechanism of MB species. The degradation of the dye may possibly be captured by the qualitative analysis of the samples studied by HPLC after PEC degradation. Fig. S11† shows the total ion chromatogram74 of the MB solution at different reaction times. It could also be found that the intensity of the MB peak decreased gradually. Further analysis of the product formation is shown in Fig. S12.† Many peaks at different intensities were observed, which indicated the variations in the composition and concentration of the degradation products. It was found that there was good agreement in their masses with those of the formed intermediates. The signals at m/z = 284.1, 270.1, 256.1, 242.1, and 227.0 suggested demethylation. Further, these species can be consecutively oxidized to form species with m/z = 102.4.75 On the other hand, MB was oxidized to the compound at m/z = 301.1 and then form species with m/z = 164.9 and 149.0. The mechanism of MB degradation is shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Schematic reaction pathways of MB degradation over Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs. 
Based on the HPLC-MS-MS analysis and the Kohn–Sham molecular orbitals (MOs) theory,61 the synergistic mechanism for MB degradation over the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs was then proposed (Scheme 3).66–76 While light energy strikes Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs at a bias potential of 0.6 V, the excited electrons (e−) quickly transfer from the CB of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 to the CB of TiO2 and holes (h+) accumulate in the VB of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 to form a brand new nano-heterostructure, as confirmed by the experimental results from HRTEM, EIS, etc.77 Due to the formation of a new heterostructure, the photogenerated electrons transport could be considerably accelerated and the rate of electron–hole recombination could be accordingly reduced effectively. Firstly, electrons transferred to the bottom-conductive Ti foil from TiO2 NTs; then, the electrons flowed to the counter-electrode, producing a photocurrent. This facilitated the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, electrons accumulated in the CB of TiO2 NTs could react with O2 to generate ˙O2−; holes accumulated in the VB of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 could react with OH− or H2O to form ˙OH, which could help mineralize the contaminants.78

It was imperative to evaluate the feasibility of the molecular design of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAEs for the effective elimination of practical wastewater in terms of future potential technical applications.50 The procedure for the PEC degradation measurement of wastewater was similar to the degradation of SMX and MB species. The Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites served as a photoanode, Pt foil as the counter-electrode, and SCE as the reference electrode. Na2SO4 (0.1 M) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The samples with different degradation times (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min) were withdrawn at room temperature to monitor the rate of degradation by recording the reduction in the COD intensity of textile wastewater, which were determined according to standard procedures. It has already been reported that different functional groups of dyes influence the degradation mechanisms, and the simulated solar degradation efficiency of wastewater (∼50%) was lower than that of individual SMX (75%) and MB (∼72%) degradations, which can be attributed to the complicated physicochemical characteristics of the mixtures of dyes in practical textile wastewater (Fig. 9a). Furthermore, the five repetitions for textile wastewater PEC degradation with Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites showed that the as-prepared Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites have excellent stability performance. The complete characterizations of textile wastewater before and after PEC processing are listed in Table 1. Evidently, more than 50% COD and 90% turbidity of wastewater can be reduced after only 2 h of simulated sunlight irradiations under mild conditions.

4. Conclusions
In summary, highly oriented and vertically aligned stoichiometric copper- and zinc-based ferrites, i.e., Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs anchored with TiO2 NAE composites, have been successfully prepared via electrochemical anodization followed by a novel vacuum-assisted impregnation strategy. The Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites with double n–n nano-heterojunctions achieved remarkable enhancement of PE conversion and PEC performance under simulated sunlight conditions. It was found that the molecular tailing of Cu species through the partial substitution of tetrahedral Zn occupation sites in ternary metal oxides could considerably enhance the photoconversion efficiency, up to a maximum of 3.75%, under simulated solar irradiation. The transient absorption spectroscopy quantitatively elucidated the long-lived photo-holes (72.23 μs) generated within the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites. Furthermore, the ESR spin-trapping experimental outcomes firmly confirmed that more ˙O2− active species can be generated over Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE nanocomposites, which played a significant role in the PEC oxidation of toxic SMX and MB species. The enhanced catalytic activity could be attributed to more efficient harvesting of the visible light and the effective spatial separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers over the heterostructures within the nanocomposites, which could extremely retard the recombination of electrons and holes, as well as extending the response of TiO2 NAE into the visible region. Moreover, the novel Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 QDs/TiO2 NAE composites with excellent stability and recyclability have been successfully utilized for practical wastewater eliminations, and almost 50% degradation efficiency and 52.4% COD removal could be achieved under the most optimum simulated sunlight irradiations and working conditions. This current contribution has definitely provided novel and comprehensive insights into the molecular tailing of multiple spinels with TiO2 NTs possessing remarkable visible light harvesting and utilization characteristics, which would offer a prospective strategy to design highly efficient and easily recyclable photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation and solar energy conversions, respectively.
