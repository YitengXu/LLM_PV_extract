    , Accepted 1st October 2021First published on 5th October 2021AbstractDespite the boom in atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) techniques used to deal with the challenge of clean water shortage, few studies focus on hygroscopic materials that can indicate a moisture change in real time. Here, a moisture-indicating hygroscopic aerogel working in a broad range of relative humidities (RHs) and with fast sorption kinetics is designed for solar driven sorption-based AWH by integrating ethanolamine-decorated CoCl2 (E-CoCl2), microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and LiCl-decorated polypyrrole (Cl-ppy). The specimen can visually indicate the sorption process in real time while harvesting moisture, achieving a flexible response to changes in environmental humidity and solar radiation. Fabricating an open, unordered, interconnected skeleton in E-CoCl2 using MFC can effectively enhance its sorption kinetics and also prevent the leakage of liquefied salt solution. The specimen has water sorption capacities of 0.39–2.05 kg kg−1 under RH 25–85% within 3.5 h and can quickly desorb within 1.5 h under 1 sun. An AWH device can conduct 3 sorption/desorption cycles within 9 h during one day outdoors and produces 2.81 kgwater kgsorbent−1. This strategy is a promising approach to enable sustainable water delivery without geographical and hydrological limitations, especially for the landlocked communities and arid areas.
1 Introduction
Water scarcity has become an urgent global challenge intertwined with energy crisis and environment deterioration for a sustainable society.1–3 Many attempts including seawater desalination4,5 and wastewater reuse6,7 are being engaged to solve this problem. However, these methods are limited to coastal areas or complex processing equipment. According to a report,8 about 1021 L of water exists in the atmosphere constantly. Therefore, AWH is considered as a feasible strategy to address the problem of water scarcity, especially in areas which are far from ocean or have limited infrastructure.9–11
AWH includes two processes of moisture collection and moisture production, which can be classified into two categories according to its working principles.8 Refrigeration-based AWH consumes electricity to make water vapor liquefy into water droplets when it comes into contact with a cold source.12,13 Complex equipment and high energy consumption hinder its promotion. Sorption-based AWH employs water sorbents to harvest moisture from the atmosphere without electricity consumption, which works even for dry regions.14 For sorption-based AWH, the desiccant and water must be separated by heat to obtain fresh water and then the desiccant is regenerated for reuse.15,16 Among varieties of energy used for heating, solar energy is a prospective and sustainable resource. Consequently, using free solar energy to power the regeneration of desiccant has been proposed as an ideal, simple and affordable fresh water production way to solve the growing problem of clean water scarcity.
Generally, the desiccant can be divided into two main categories: solid sorbents and liquid desiccants.17 The continuously developed solid sorbents for use in AWH such as molecular sieves, silica gels, zeolites and metal–organic framework materials only undergo one phase change, which suffer from the disadvantage of low saturated water sorption capacity.8,18 In contrast, liquid desiccants (CoCl2, CuCl2, LiCl, etc.) consist of three phase changes: from water vapor to liquid salt, to saturated water vapor, to re-condensed and low-salt liquid water.19 Liquid desiccants can capture large water volumes by reacting with water vapor to produce the saturated salt solution. Nevertheless, pure saturated salt solution requires a higher energy for desorption of water because of the low light-absorption coefficient.20 And the leakage problem caused by their liquid nature after deliquescence also brings difficulty to disposal.
To solve the above problems, supporting materials such as hollow carbon spheres, metal–organic frameworks, cellulose aerogels and polymer gels have been investigated to hold liquid desiccants and improve the photothermal conversion efficiency.21–24 Among them, cellulose aerogels have unique advantages of being renewable and having abundant resources, an interconnected network and good hydrophilicity, which are conducive to water retention and rapid water delivery and also in line with the concept of green development.25–31 For example, Wang et al. prepared a cellulose-based aerogel with graphene and LiCl that can harvest water in natural sunlight of 0.10–0.56 kW m2.23 Knapczyk-Korczak et al. successfully fabricated a fog collection system with Janus structure by regulating hydrophobic polystyrene and hydrophilic cellulose acetate.32 However, in real life, humidity and solar radiation change all the time. Sometimes high humidity will accelerate the saturation sorption process, and sometimes humidity is too low to achieve water sorption equilibrium. Furthermore, the lack of sunlight on a certain day cannot finish the desorption process on time as usual. AWH without the ability to indicate moisture change can only fix the sorption/desorption duration. It may prolong the sorption/desorption duration due to oversaturation/over-desorption or lead to redundant desorption operations because of the unsaturated state, resulting in a low energy and operation utilization. If the moisture sorption process is visible, it can indicate whether desorption can be started/finished, thereby making the AWH system more flexible and efficient.
In order to flexibly respond to humidity and sunlight changes in the actual environment, a moisture-indicating and solar-driven cellulose aerogel (SMCA) for AWH was designed based on the integration of Cl-ppy, MFC and E-CoCl2. The SMCA consisted of a thin Cl-ppy based solar-to-thermal conversion layer and an MFC-based composite functional layer. The MFC-based composite functional layer included a cellulose aerogel-based support and an E-CoCl2 dominated hygroscopic agent and simultaneous humidity indicator. The structure of the cellulose aerogel effectively shortens the diffusion length of moist air from the aerogel surface to the bulk and increases the number of accessible moisture-capturing sites leading to a faster sorption kinetics. Furthermore, its hydrophilicity and porous skeleton provide water storage room and prevent the leakage of salt solution. The SMCA possesses moisture-sensitive discoloration properties along with fast sorption kinetics, great photothermal conversion and a broad working range under RH. It achieves visible real-time monitoring of moisture change and makes it possible to realize multiple sorption/desorption cycles on a random sunny day. This kind of moisture-indicating device provides a new direction for flexible and efficient AWH.
2 Experimental
2.1. Materials and characterization
Shanghai Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., China provides acetic acid, NaClO2, anhydrous LiCl, CoCl2, (NH4)2S2O8 and pyrrole. Details regarding the preparation of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), LiCl-decorated poly-pyrrole solution (Cl-ppy) and ethanolamine-decorated CoCl2 (E-CoCl2) used in this work and characterization are provided in the ESI.†
2.2. Preparation of the moisture-indicating cellulose aerogel (MCA)
25 ml of 0.8 wt% MFC was put into a container. E-CoCl2 was subsequently added into MFC with different addition amounts of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 g. After stirring for 5 minutes, the specimens were transferred to a refrigerator for freezing. The MCA was obtained after drying with a freeze dryer. The obtained MCA was named MCA-x, therein, x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively.
2.3. Preparation of the solar-driven and moisture-indicating cellulose aerogel (SMCA)
25 ml of 0.8 wt% MFC was put into a container with appropriate size. 0.4 g of E-CoCl2 was subsequently added into MFC. Stirring was stopped after 5 minutes, and the Cl-ppy suspension was carefully dropped onto the surface of the hybrid suspension. After standing for 5 minutes, the specimen was transferred to a refrigerator for freezing. The SMCA was obtained after drying with a freeze dryer. The weight of Cl-ppy added onto SMCA was calculated by the weight difference. Furthermore, pure cellulose aerogel (CA) was prepared for blank samples by freeze drying of 25 ml of MFC.
2.4. Atmospheric water sorption
The moisture sorption performances of CA, MCA-5, SMCA and E-CoCl2 were tested in a constant temperature and humidity chamber (YNK/TH-408; Suzhou Unique Environmental Test Equipment Co. Ltd., China) at 25 °C and a relative humidity (RH) of 25%, 45%, 65% and 85%, respectively, for 8 h. The mass change of each specimen was detected every 30 min. The water uptake was calculated by eqn (1): (1)where mv denotes the mass after moisture sorption at various times, and m0 is the initial mass before sorption.

2.4.1 Solar-powered vapor evaporation. 
Before the desorption test begins, the MCA and SMCA were subjected to harvesting water under RH 65% (25 °C) for 8 h. A xenon light source was adjusted to a certain light strength of 1 sun (100 W cm−2) according to an optical power meter as simulated sunlight. The temperature and mass change of samples were recorded using an IR camera and electronic balance (the photo of the device is shown in Fig. S1†). After the test starts, the temperature and the mass of samples were obtained every 1 min. The evaporation rate and evaporation efficiency were obtained by eqn (2) and (3): (2) (3)where Δm is the total mass of desorbed water during a certain time span. ms is the mass of the sorbent, and T is the time span of radiation. mt is the total mass of absorbed water by the sorbent.

2.5. Outdoor experiment
A piece of SMCA (a diameter of 9.5 cm and a height of 1.1 cm) was placed in a self-made simple device to conduct outdoor experiments. This device consisted of a transparent glass container as a water container, a glass dish to separate the SMCA and condensed water, a lid with a tilt angle for condensation and a sealing tape to ensure air tightness (details are given in part 3.4).
The water was harvested outside at the Northeast Forestry University (NEFU) campus in the city of Harbin on random sunny days in June, in 2021. The device was opened overnight to enable the SMCA to absorb moisture. Subsequently, the device was sealed and subjected to solar radiation. Due to the fast sorption of the SMCA and the ability of working under a low RH, it can perform the sorption/desorption process many times on a sunny day.
3 Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization

Fig. 1a illustrates the two-step synthetic process of the SMCA, involving careful dropping of Cl-ppy on the top of the mixture of MFC and E-CoCl2 to generate a bilayer structure, followed by freeze-drying. This mixture can support Cl-ppy well (Fig. S2†). The prepared SMCA can be used all day for AWH. First, E-CoCl2 supported by CA captures moisture in the atmosphere. Because of the hydrophilicity and interconnected network of CA, the captured moisture is quickly transferred and stored in the SMCA, which prevents the leakage of liquefied salt after harvesting moisture (Fig. S3†). At the same time, due to the moisture-sensitive properties of E-CoCl2, the color of the SMCA will change with the amount of stored water. Subsequently, the desorption process is accelerated by the light-absorbing layer under solar radiation. Finally, the water is obtained through the collection device.

(h) and (i) The light-absorbing layer. (j) Mapping of the SMCA on C, O, N and Co. 
SEM images in Fig. 1b and c confirm that CA has an open, unordered, 3D and interconnected network. The flaky skeleton was formed by the combination of MFC (a diameter of 40–80 nm, Fig. 1d) through hydrogen bonding. As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the SMCA also has an interconnected 3D framework with an open-cell geometry. The surface of the flaky wall contains embedded E-CoCl2 particles rather than the freestanding sphere-like particles,33 revealing the successful integration of E-CoCl2 into the framework. This tight connection can facilitate the rapid transfer of water from E-CoCl2 to CA. The mapping image (Fig. 1j) also demonstrates that Co is homogeneously distributed in the SMCA. Additionally, the upper part of the red line in Fig. 1e is the light-absorbing layer formed by the penetration of Cl-ppy into MFC. Although Cl-ppy is dropped on the surface of the mixture of cellulose microfibrils and E-CoCl2, it will sink slowly and be entangled with cellulose microfibrils. Fig. 1h proves that Cl-ppy and MFC are entangled rather than split. Therefore, except for a small amount of floating powder on the surface, the bilayer cannot be easily separated. To further verify this point, a piece of SMCA was sonicated in water for 10 min. As shown in Fig. S5,† the bilayer structure was well retained. Furthermore, the cellulose skeleton extends from the water capture/storage layer to the light-absorbing layer, which helps the uninterrupted transmission of water during the desorption process (Fig. 2i).

(h) The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of specimens. (i) The comparison of the MCA and SMCA in terms of absorption percentage. 
As revealed in Fig. 2e, elements Co 2p, O 1s, N 1s, C 1s, and Cl 2p located at around 781.0, 531.0, 401.0, 284.0, and 198.0 eV in MCA indicate the successful introduction of E-CoCl2.34–36 The peak intensities of N 1s and C 1s of the SMCA significantly increase compared with those of MCA, implying the doping of Cl-ppy. The O 1s spectra (Fig. 2a) can be divided into two peaks at 532.7 and 531.2 eV, assigned to the C–O bond and CO bond, respectively.37–39 The binding energy values for O 1s have negative shifts continuously, which is ascribed to that O constantly attracts the electrons of introduced Cl and N, resulting in an increase in electron cloud density. In the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2b), the peak at 401.4 eV corresponds to –NH+– (N-Q), whereas the peak at 399.2 eV is assigned to N–H/C–N (N-5).22,40–42 More details can be found in the ESI.† Furthermore, the hydrophilicity of CA is excellent (Fig. 2g). The introduced N, O, and Cl-containing groups can help the SMCA still maintain this superiority, which contributes to efficient water harvesting (Videos S1 and S2†).
FTIR spectra further confirm the XPS analysis. The spectrum of Cl-ppy exhibits an absorption peak at 1119 cm−1 corresponding to the C–N bonds in the pyrrole rings43,44 and the peak at 1055 cm−1 is attributed to the C–H deformation of ppy43 (Fig. 2c). The coordination of CoCl2 and ethanolamine is presented in Fig. S6.† All the characteristic peaks of E-CoCl2 and Cl-ppy can be found in the FTIR spectrum of the SMCA (Fig. 2c and d), confirming that the chemical structures of E-CoCl2 and Cl-ppy within the SMCA are well maintained.35 Furthermore, the storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G′′) values of the E-CoCl2/cellulose gel and pure cellulose gel can illustrate the interaction between E-CoCl2 and cellulose (Fig. 2f). Both the specimens have higher storage moduli (G′) than loss moduli (G′′) throughout the whole frequency scanning range, indicating a standard elastomer behavior and the formation of cross-linked polymeric skeletons.22 The G′ and G′′ values of E-CoCl2 are significantly higher than that of CA, indicating a stronger skeleton. This increase may be attributed to hydrogen bonds or coordination between E-CoCl2 and the abundant O of cellulose networks.
A strong optical absorption characteristic is a prerequisite for achieving high solar thermal conversion efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4h, compared with the CA and MCA, the SMCA shows favorable light absorption over the full solar spectrum range (200–2500 nm), in both the dry and wet states. In addition, the color of the Cl-ppy became darker after wetting while the absorbance increased. This is because wetted surfaces effectively reduced surface scattering. The optical absorption can be calculated as 100% − R% − T%.45 According to the calculation, the pristine CA displays good light absorbance in the wavenumber range of 2000–2500 nm and poor light absorbance in the wavenumber range of 250–1500 nm. After the addition of Cl-ppy, the light absorption of the SMCA enhances and exhibits 97% absorption within the full solar spectrum range (Fig. 4i).
3.2. Atmospheric water sorption assessment
The annual average humidity in Harbin, China is about 65%. Therefore, water sorption experiments of MCA-x were carried out simultaneously at 65% RH for 8 h to select the most suitable doping amount of E-CoCl2 in Harbin. MCA-x presented an interesting color change upon capturing moisture from the atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 3a, the color of MCA-x gradually turned from blue to purple and finally pink, functioning as an indicator of the stored water. This color transition is ascribed to the reaction between the unsaturated coordination compound of cobalt and water molecules in air.46 This process changed the outer electronic shell (d shell) structure of cobalt, resulting in a color change of the coordination compounds.48Fig. 3b reveals that the amount of water uptake increases with the increase of doping amount. The efficiency of sorbent addition is defined as the ratio of the increase of water uptake to the weight difference of the moisture absorbent. From MCA-5 to MCA-6, the water uptake increased little but the efficiency of sorbent addition dropped sharply. This was because environmental restrictions including sorption duration, environmental humidity, and the contact surface area between aerogels and moisture prevented the excess sorbent from being able to maximize its effectiveness, resulting in a decrease in efficiency. Therefore, MCA-5 was chosen in the following experiment to achieve high utilization efficiency and was abbreviated as MCA.

Fig. 4a–d show the sorption kinetics of E-CoCl2, MCA, SMCA and CA respectively at different RH. In general, the water uptake capacity increased and the sorption inflection point prolonged with the increase of RH. The water uptake of the SMCA reached 0.49, 0.69, 1.07 and 2.38 g g−1 at RH of 25%, 45%, 65% and 85%, respectively. This result is close to the data recorded by the water sorption/desorption isotherm (Fig. 4n), demonstrating a broad working range of the SMCA and the suitability for all-weather AWH applications. Other water sorption/desorption isotherms can be checked in Fig. S7.†Fig. 4e–h demonstrate the sorption kinetics of the specimens at RH 25%, RH 45%, RH 65% and RH 85%, respectively. The water uptake of the SMCA is similar to that of the MCA under all RH (Fig. 4e–h), confirming that the light-absorbing layer has little influence on moisture capture. Although the moisture capture ability of CA was bad (Fig. 4d) and E-CoCl2 suffered from very slow sorption kinetics (Fig. 4a), the combination of CA and E-CoCl2 delivered a superior water uptake capacity along with the enhanced sorption kinetics. These two superiorities can be summarized as follows. First, compositing with CA can increase the sorption capacity of E-CoCl2 under low RH. For example, after combining E-CoCl2 with CA, the water uptake of the MCA was 6.4 times more than that of pure E-CoCl2 at RH 25% (Fig. 4e). Second, transforming E-CoCl2 into an aerogel can significantly improve its sorption kinetics. Specifically, pure E-CoCl2 suffered from sluggish sorption kinetics (Fig. 4e–g) and its time to reach water sorption equilibrium was much longer than that of the MCA or SMCA. In contrast, the sorption kinetics of the SMCA was much faster than that of pure E-CoCl2.

(l) and (m) Schematics of the moisture sorption process of the SMCA. (n) Water sorption/desorption isotherms of the SMCA at 25 °C. 
These phenomena can be explained by the structure of hygroscopic materials. For a water sorption process, the kinetics is mainly controlled by the diffusion of sorbate molecules from the surface to the bulk.47Fig. 4i simulates the stacked E-CoCl2 particles, in which only the superficial particles can come into contact with the moist air. During the early stage of deliquescence, an agglomerated layer forms and causes a reduced contact surface area with air. E-CoCl2·xH2O liquefies slowly via slow molecular diffusion through the agglomerated layer, so that the internal water sorbent gradually starts to work. This slow liquefaction process is particularly obvious under low RH, and therefore, pure E-CoCl2 suffers from extremely sluggish sorption kinetics. In contrast, fabricating a highly porous structure in E-CoCl2 using MFC can improve its water uptake kinetics from two aspects. First, the open and macroporous structure effectively shortens the diffusion length from the aerogel surface to the bulk (Fig. 4l). Second, the interconnected cellulose network improves the dispersion of E-CoCl2 and increases the number of accessible water-capturing sites, which can make all the E-CoCl2 particles work at the same time (Fig. 4m). The fast kinetics lays the foundation for multiple water uptake–release cycles in a given time, thereby extracting more water from the surrounding atmosphere.47 Compared with the morphology of aggregated E-CoCl2, the 3D, open and porous framework of the SMCA enhances the moisture capture ability (Fig. 4j and k), making it have high moisture sorption kinetics and good sorption capacity under low RH.
3.3. Photothermal assisted water release
Before the desorption test under one sun illumination begins, the MCA and SMCA were subjected to harvesting water under RH 65% (25 °C) for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, after turning on the simulated light source, the surface temperature rose sharped accompanied by color transitions because of the quick water evaporation. Until the desorption process is over, only about 3.02% of the stored water for the SMCA was left. Meanwhile, 8.36% of the stored water cannot be released for the MCA. In addition to residual water, the SMCA also achieved a higher temperature increase and a higher rate of solar-driven water release. After desorption for 1, 20, 40 and 90 min, the average surface temperatures of the SMCA were 6.0, 8.1, 12.6 and 17.6 °C higher than that of the MCA (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, most of the stored water by the MCA (i.e. >90%) was released within 84 min, while the SMCA only took 62 min to release 90% of the stored water. After desorption for 1 h under 1 sun illumination, the MCA exhibited a vaporization rate of ∼0.8675 g g−1 h−1 (1.195 kg m−2 h−1) and a water recovery ratio of 77.22%; the SMCA possessed a vaporization rate of ∼0.9550 g g−1 h−1 (1.391 kg m−2 h−1) and a water recovery ratio of 87.64% (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that the Cl-ppy derived light-absorption layer improved the desorption performance effectively.

(c) Changing process of water recovery ratio and vaporization rate during desorption. (d) Infrared (IR) images of the MCA and SMCA after exposure to irradiation under one sun illumination for 1, 20, 40 and 90 min. (e) Water sorption of the SMCA in 15 consecutive uptake–release cycles. 
The cycling stability of the hygroscopic material is another important factor to be considered for practical use. As shown in Fig. 5e, 15 regeneration cycles exhibited no obvious degradation of the sorption capacities and an increase of residual water, which captured moisture at 65% RH (25 °C) and produced water under one sun illumination, demonstrating the excellent stability of the SMCA. The dimensional stability of the SMCA is also excellent. The size of the SMCA only shrunk slightly after the first water absorption and still kept stable after 15 cycles of sorption/desorption (Fig. S8†). Also, the microstructure remained porous after the cycling test (Fig. S9†). All of the above results demonstrate the possibility of using natural sunlight for regeneration, guaranteeing that the SMCA is an energy-efficient and sustainable moisture sorbent.
3.4. AWH device and its outdoor experiment
Indoor experiments have already proved that the open, unordered and 3D interconnected porous structure enables the SMCA to absorb water in a low RH environment and can quickly complete the sorption/desorption process, which makes it possible for the SMCA to complete multiple sorption/desorption cycles during one day outdoors. Fig. 6a shows the schematic of outdoor multiple water harvesting cycles in one day. A piece of SMCA is placed in a self-made simple device. This device is composed of a transparent glass container as a water container, a glass dish to separate the SMCA and condensed water, a lid with a tilt angle for condensation and a sealing tape to ensure air tightness. First, the SMCA is exposed to the environment to fully capture water at night. When the sun rises, the desorption process can be carried out. Under the sunlight, as water vapor continues to evaporate, the SMCA gradually changes from pink to blue because of the moisture indicator effect and the evaporated vapor is condensed at the bottom of the container. Once the SMCA turns blue, the lid was removed, the condensed water was taken out and the device was sheltered from the sun to keep the SMCA harvesting water during the daytime. After harvesting enough water, the SMCA can perform the desorption experiment again, and repeat it in this way.

(e) Digital photograph of 18.05 g of liquid water harvested using the AWH device. (f) Quality assessment of the collected water. 
The outdoor experiment under natural sunlight was conducted to examine the ability of harvesting and producing water under practical conditions. The device with 6.43 g of pre-dried SMCA was first kept outdoors overnight at the NEFU campus in Harbin, China (20:00 June 7, 2021 to 8:00, June 8, 2021, with an average temperature of 19 °C and an average RH of 60–80%). The first solar-powered desorption process was started on June 8, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. The evaporation rate was very fast, and the inner wall of the device began to mist after only two minutes. After 20 minutes of desorption, there were large water droplets on the lid, and a layer of condensed water can be identified at the bottom of the container (Fig. 6b). When the SMCA turns from pink to blue completely, the first desorption is over and around 10.88 g of water was collected within 106 min (8:00–9:46 a.m.). The lid was removed and a sun umbrella was used to block the sunlight for the SMCA to enable the second water-harvesting. The device was then subjected to two more sorption–desorption cycles (details can be found in Table 1 and ESI†). The 2nd and 3rd cycles produced 4.87 and 2.32 g of fresh water (Fig. 6d). In the end, the device collected an accumulative amount of ∼18.05 g fresh water (Fig. 6e), which is 2.81 times the weight of the dry sorbent. In addition, the SMCA was also used repeatedly, and the collected water during a consecutive test was recorded in Table S2,† illustrating that the SMCA had an effective water-collection ability outdoors. The collected water was analyzed by ICP-OES and the results are summarized in Fig. 6f to make a comparison with the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines for drinking water quality.47,48 All the cation concentrations (Fe3+, Ni+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mo6+, Ba2+, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Al3+) detected in collected water were fully compliant with the WHO standards.

The RH, temperature, and solar radiation all affect the efficiency of water collection. For water-harvesting in the daytime, a shelter was chosen to assist the sorption process. As shown in Fig. S10,† even at noon, the RH, temperature and light intensity under the umbrella reached 42%, 27 °C and 0.7 mW cm−2, which was enough for the SMCA to harvest moisture. For the water vapor desorption process, the time scale is flexible according to the moisture indication effect of the SMCA. The mass of the water collected in the second cycle became less due to multiple reasons. As shown in Fig. 6c and S11,† during the second sorption process, the RH decreased from 60–80% to 42–45%, and the sorption duration was only 124 min. The further decrease of the mass of water collected in the third cycle might be attributed to the weakening of light strength. Although the collected water in the last two cycles is much less, compared to a device that can only collect water once a day,10,19,23 this device pumping water three cycles a day is still very excellent. Furthermore, Harbin is in high northern latitude (44°04′–46°40′), and the climatic conditions including RH, temperature and light intensity for AWH are not very good.23 Nevertheless, the outdoor experiment confirms the feasibility in AWH with the SMCA under relatively severe environments and shows that this device has an excellent water production yield of 2.81 gwater gsorbent−1 within one day although it still needs improvement.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, a moisture-indicating and solar-driven sorption-based AWH aerogel working across a wide range of RH with fast sorption kinetics and stable cycling was rationally designed. After compounding the light-absorbing layer, the specimen showed 97% light absorption within the full solar spectrum range and exhibited a vaporization rate of ∼0.9550 g g−1 h−1 and a water recovery ratio of 87.64% after desorption for 1 h under 1 sun illumination. The sorption capacity under low RH and the vapor sorption kinetics were largely enhanced by fabricating a highly porous structure in E-CoCl2 using MFC because this open, unordered and 3D interconnected skeleton effectively shortened the diffusion length from the aerogel surface to the bulk and increased the number of accessible water-capturing sites. Furthermore, the hydrophilic network of MFC can store the liquefied salt solution to avoid leakage. More importantly, this hygroscopic aerogel can indicate the sorption/desorption process in real time through the visible color change, which can avoid wasting sorption/desorption time due to oversaturation/over-desorption or performing redundant desorption operations because of the unsaturated state, thereby achieving a higher efficiency than traditional sorbents. By utilizing this hygroscopic aerogel, we have also demonstrated the possibility of multiple water-harvesting cycles outdoors within one day and the water yield is about 2.81 gwater gsorbent−1 in one day. This hygroscopic aerogel synthesized from sustainable cellulose can be made into a large scale, low energy-consumption and portable AWH device providing an alternative method for producing fresh water in water-scarce regions.
