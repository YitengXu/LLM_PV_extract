Identifying and developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly water remediation technologies are crucial for water reclamation. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) relying on oxidation by reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), O3, H2O2, HClO, etc., have been recognized as an appealing and promising decentralized approach for on-site treatment of water containing a wide range of organic contaminants. Recent advances in nanotechnology have stimulated extensive research on investigating efficient, durable and energy-saving electrocatalysts/electrodes for EAOP applications. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent progress in wastewater treatment using electrochemical technologies with a particular focus on EAOPs that have demonstrated high efficiency in the removal of various types of recalcitrant organics from contaminated water. The state-of-the-art electrocatalysts based on different systems of EAOPs were critically evaluated and summarized, and the impacts on catalytic activity, removal efficiency, performance stability, and product selectivity were systematically discussed. Challenges and opportunities that arise at the intersection of materials science and treatment process engineering were proposed, as future research would aim to enhance catalyst properties while considering the primary roadblocks such as the expense and sustainability of practical EAOP implementation in water decontamination.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical technologies have emerged as novel and effective water treatment strategies for the disinfection and purification of effluents containing a broad-range of organic contaminants.1,2 Recent years have seen an upsurge of interest in the development and implementation of electrochemical treatments as alternatives to traditional physicochemical and biological techniques for environmental remediation. Around 31000 research articles, books and critical reviews have been published in the field of environmental electrochemistry over the last 20 years (Fig. 1). The majority of research has intensively focused on the area of electrochemical transformation of specific contaminants in water.3 The extensive research has brought in various alternative solutions for tackling most environmental problems in the processes of electrocoagulation (EC),4 electrodialysis (ED),5 electroreduction (ER),6 electrochemical oxidation (EO) and indirect electro-oxidation (IEO) by in situ generation of active oxidants (chlorine, ozone, hydrogen peroxide etc.). Among these, EO and IEO, namely electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), which generate highly reactive species notably for the direct mineralization of organic substances,7 or suitable depuration of highly toxic biorefractory contaminants,8 have raised pronounced attention and emerged as useful and practical technological alternatives to the existing ones.9
 Fig. 1  Summary of the number of publications on electrochemical treatments for environmental applications in the last 20 years (search date: April, 2022). 
EAOPs proceed by applying an electric potential across an anode and a cathode in an electrochemical reactor, where influent water serves as the electrolyte. Organics can be degraded by (1) directly transferring charge at the electrode surface; and (2) indirect or mediated reactions with electrochemically generated reactive oxidants.10 Both pathways could take place simultaneously during the EAOPs. For anodic processes, an electron transfer occurs from the water discharge to produce active oxygen (i.e., hydroxyl radicals (˙OH); hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3)) or from ions in the solution to generate other strong oxidizing species, such as active chlorine, S2O82−, C2O62− and ˙CO32−,11 which have been identified by different techniques such as spin-trap electron paramagnetic spectrometry, chromatographic analysis, and scavenging techniques.12,13 For the cathodic processes, H2O2 can also be generated via a two-electron reduction of O2 or bubbled air in acidic/neutral media. The most popular technology in cathodic processes is the electro-Fenton (EF) technology, in which Fe2+ activates H2O2 to generate powerful ˙OH via the Fenton reaction. EF technology has some outstanding advantages, such as in situ and continuous electro-generating H2O2 at the cathode fed with air, and cathodic reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ with consequent continuous production of Fenton's reagent. These benefits have promoted rapid development and extensive research for real applications.14
Traditional AOPs such as Fenton catalysis, Fenton-like catalysis, photochemistry, ozonation and their coupled systems have already stood out as feasible approaches for water remediation.15 Being a counterpart for AOPs, EAOPs have their own special merits by directly translating energy input to contaminant oxidation. Specifically, electrons are clean reagents which can generate versatile, efficient reactive species (˙OH, ˙O2−, HClO, etc.) to significantly enhance the pollutant removal efficiency, making EAOPs an environmentally compatible approach. Besides, the operation of EAOPs is also cheaper under certain operating conditions, especially when this technology is powered by renewable energy such as nuclear, wind and solar sources.16 Other compelling advantages of EAOPs are related to their operational safety and amenability of automation by conveniently adjusting current/voltage, which is advantageous to the treatment of diverse synthetic wastewater containing dyes, fluorinated compounds, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and some low molecular weight organics, as well as a wide variety of real wastewaters such as textile effluents,17 landfill leachates,18 or urban wastewaters after secondary treatment from water treatment plants (WTPs).19 Electrochemical devices based on EAOPs have been commercialized for the purification and disinfection of sewage.20
Even though EAOP technology has achieved remarkable advancements and is evolving fast, some challenges still need to be overcome for its industrial implementation: (1) the performance, including current efficiency, stability, removal and mineralization rates, which involve the generation of undesired and toxic halogenated organic by-products during the EAOPs; (2) instable treatment activities due to unpredictable fluctuation in pH, temperature, conductivity, and chemical composition in wastewater; and (3) configuration of an electrochemical reactor involving the arrangement of the electrode and the distribution of wastewater, mass transport limitations, and cost of cell capital and operational expenditures. To date, the literature has discussed the applicability of different EAOP approaches including the practical problems in the remediation of different kinds of synthetic and real wastewater, and provided comprehensive analyses on the effect of main operating parameters and reactor design on the removal performance, which is particularly critical to the practical use.20,21 However, with the rapid development of nanotechnology, especially in fabricating various electrode materials in the field of electrocatalysis in recent years,22 only a few reviews have connected the emerging catalysts in electrochemical catalysis with the water treatment processes.23,24 A wide range of emerging nanomaterials is deemed an unprecedented opportunity for all electrochemical water treatment processes.
Herein, this review mainly focuses on the very recent advances in the emerging electrocatalysts for EAOPs towards the electro-oxidation of refractory organic pollutants in the environment. We start with the introduction of the primary reactions of EAOPs for the abatement of organic pollutants and discuss the fundamental mechanisms of oxidation by different reactive species involved in different systems. Subsequently, various material-based processes such as AO, EF and coupled processes for the remediation of diversified synthetic and real wastewaters, mainly published in the past decade, are briefly reviewed and summarized with various wastewater composition, applied processes, and electrode characteristics. Then, different types of electrocatalysts for each reaction in terms of their impact on catalytic activity, performance stability, and product selectivity are rigorously evaluated and summarized in detail. Electro-produced reactive species, including ˙OH, O3, Cl2, H2O2etc., are believed to play an essential role in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and create an incentive for developing effective anode materials. We strive to identify the individual contribution of different reactive species though usually blended and provide insightful information that helps in better understanding the fundamental catalysis by nanomaterials and state-of-the-art electrochemical mechanisms. Finally, we present the current status of promising electrodes, which focuses on implementing organic pollutant degradation in a commercially viable way rather than pure material research and further provides perspectives into current challenges and opportunities so as to guide materials design in this field.
2. EAOPs for the abatement of organic water pollutants
2.1. Primary reactions of EAOPs

2.1.1. Anodic oxidation (AO). 
AO is one of the most popular electrochemical pathways among the EAOPs for wastewater remediation and features rapid degradation of pollutants, elevated removal efficiency, and easy operation in a wide range of solution pH values. Typically, AO includes direct electrochemical oxidation and indirect oxidation.
(1) Direct electrochemical oxidation (DO). 
In the DO process, electron exchange occurs directly between organic pollutants (R) and the electrocatalytic anode surface without the involvement of other substances (eqn (1)). R → (R˙)+ + e−(1)
The straightforward oxidation process of DO makes it a critical approach in the oxidation of refractory organic pollutants, which are hydrophobic and unreactive to ˙OH as well as recalcitrant to most bio-chemical treatments (e.g., fluorinated organics).25 This unique character promises that AO will become one of the only few technologies that can destroy these compounds. However, a single DO procedure yields poor decontamination. Hence, it has been intensively used in combination with other indirect oxidation procedures, especially with ˙OH oxidation, which is commenced via the one-electron water discharge on the anode surface (M), as shown in eqn (2).
(2) Hydroxyl radicals. 
Hydroxyl radical (˙OH), a strong and non-selective oxidant with high redox potentials (2.7 V vs. NHE), is widely used to break down a variety of organics and high molecular weight compounds. M + H2O → M (˙OH) + H+ + e−E0 = 2.38 V(2) M (˙OH) + R → M + RO + H+ + e−(3)
Studies have found that the ˙OH oxidation mechanism exhibited two distinct outcomes: (i) partial and selective oxidation of organic pollutants into low molecular weight compounds or some more refractory products; and (ii) total mineralization and complete combustion into CO2, H2O and ions. The mechanism behind such electrochemical transformation was revealed by Comninellis et al. and later on widely accepted and further modified.26 They attributed these two distinct results to the anode material's nature involving simultaneous oxygen evolution. According to the interaction between anodes and ˙OH, or their ability to form free ˙OH, the electrodes can be classified as “active” and “nonactive” anodes.
For an “active” anode, the adsorbed ˙OH produced on its surface after the first step of water discharge may interact with the anode, leading to the formation of higher state oxides (MOx+1) or superoxides (MO) viaeqn (4). The organic compounds (R) are then selectively oxidized via an oxygen transfer reaction, and the surface site restores to its original oxidation state (MOx) simultaneously. In this scenario, the formation of ˙OH on active anodes is relatively low. Besides, it is the surface redox couple MOx+1/MOx rather than the ˙OH that acts as a mediator in the decomposing of organics on the “active” electrodes. Hence, these kinds of radicals are sometimes called chemisorbed “active oxygen”. Comninellis used N,N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline (RNO) as a spin trap for the detection and identification of ˙OH radicals in the electrolysis of phenol and salicylic acid over Pt and IrO2, and found that RNO was electrochemically inactive on their surfaces.30 In addition, the higher oxide, MOx+1, was formed on the anodes, suggesting that Pt and IrO2 anodes favour partial and selective oxidation because the ˙OH concentration is almost zero. MOx (˙OH) → MOx+1 + H+ + e−(4) MOx+1 + R → MOx + RO(5)
For the “non-active” anode, the oxidation state of the atoms in the anode will not change during the reaction. Meanwhile, ˙OH, which is generated and weakly physisorbed on the anode surface, facilitates the nonselective oxidation of organic compounds, leading to large or complete mineralization. MOx (˙OH) + R → MOx + CO2 + H2O + H+ + e−(6)
Radical-specific ESR identification has been determined as direct evidence for electro-generated ˙OH by You et al.,27 and can be utilized as a strategy to screen the appropriate anode materials, optimize the design of the electrolytic reactor and make the operating mode suitable for a practical EAOP (Fig. 2A). One of the general mechanisms involved in the anodic oxidation reaction was revealed by Vogel et al., who revealed that the corona of a surface bubble adhering to an electrode promotes the production of ˙OH by accumulating hydroxide anions.31 However, it should be noted that not all electrodes can be divided into this category, and some electrodes have exhibited mixed behaviours. The mechanism of generating ˙OH still needs more investigation. In addition, such an anodic oxidation process can also be defined as the direct EAOPs due to the degradation of the organic pollutants occurring mainly by the adsorbed ˙OH on the anodes with high O2 overvoltage.

(3) Hydrogen peroxide. 
In addition to the one-electron oxidation reaction for producing ˙OH, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is another important reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be on-site electrochemically synthesized via two-electron oxidation of water (2e− WOR) on the anode (eqn (7)): 2H2O → H2O2 + 2(H+ + e−) E0 = 1.77 V vs. NHE(7)
The electrochemical generation of H2O2 provides a straightforward way for on-site production and application for water treatment without transportation. Most importantly, the 2e− WOR constitutes a coveted procedure as it enables the electro-generation of H2O2 solely from water.32 However, one of the critical challenges for both the one-electron and two-electron water oxidation lies in the competition with the undesirable four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (eqn (8)), which is more favoured by thermodynamics.33 Therefore, current developments in H2O2 generation from electrochemical water oxidation suffer from a compromise between selectivity and generation rate (Fig. 2B). 2H2O → O2 + 4(H+ + e−) E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE(8)
Another attractive and mature route for the electrochemical production of H2O2 is the reduction of oxygen on the cathode, with a wide range of applications in water remediation, which will be introduced in the following section. Both processes generate H2O2in situ that is environmentally friendly and offer advantages over the industrial anthraquinone process in terms of higher chemical stability, ease of production/storage/transportation and lower safety risks.34
(4) Ozone (O3). 
Ozone is a strong oxidant with a redox potential of 2.07 V, ranked only after fluoride (2.87 V). Due to its simplicity and no harmful by-products, electrochemical ozone production (EOP) from water electrolysis has been regarded as another promising remediation technique for the oxidation of recalcitrant organics and disinfection of drinking water.35 3H2O → O3 + 6(H+ + e−) E0 = 1.51 V vs. NHE(9)
Similar to the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, the four-electron oxygen evolution reaction is also the primary rival reaction to EOP thermodynamically. Besides, the polar O3 molecule is much more soluble but unstable than O2 in water, which can be decomposed into O2 in a range of seconds to hours depending on the electrolyte properties, essentially restricting its practical application in water treatment. To overcome this challenge, Shi and coworkers provided a capillary effect-enabled electrolysis strategy to effectively suppress the competitive OER and improve gaseous ozone escape by employing an unusual partially submersed mode of the porous anode.29 As shown in Fig. 2C, the 3D-interconnected porous network composed of a β-PbO2 cuboid-loaded bulk porous Pb achieved significantly enhanced electrocatalytic gaseous ozone production compared to the solid Pb counterpart. Besides, a capillary pressure-induced “molecular oxygen-locking effect” in the electrolyte fully filled in the porous structure of the electrode surface above the electrolyte pool level leads to a largely suppressed OER and a brand new and highly efficient ˙O3− intermediate-involved EOP pathway.
(5) Reactive chlorine species (RCS). 
The uses of H2O2 and O3, along with the rapid production of oxidative radicals, are particularly applicable for water treatments. However, H2O2 and O3 perform with low sporicidal activity compared with reactive chlorine species with higher steady-state concentration, limiting their application in large-scale water treatment and disinfection.36 In addition, the reactivity of RCS is more selective than those of H2O2 and O3.37 For these reasons, chlorination has been regarded as an appropriate and energy-saving approach to achieve high oxidation efficiency and microbicidal activity in wastewater treatment, especially for real wastewater with high sodium chloride concentrations. The chlorine-mediated electrolysis is based on the direct electrochemical oxidation of chloride ions at the anode to produce active chlorine, which is in the form of gaseous chlorine (Cl2), hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite ions (HClO/ClO−) depending on pH through eqn (10)–(12). 2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE(10) Cl2 (aq.) + H2O → HClO + H+ + Cl−(11) HClO ↔ H+ + ClO−(12)
(6) Peroxo-compounds. 
Sulphate, carbonate and phosphate ions in the effluents or natural water can be oxidized into persulfate, percarbonate and perphosphate on the anode eqn (13)–(15) at high overpotential.38 2SO42− → S2O82− + 2e−(13) 2CO32− → C2O62− + 2e−(14) 2PO43− → P2O84− + 2e−(15)
These electrochemically generated peroxo-compounds, including persulfate, percarbonate, perphosphate and hydrogen peroxide, are relatively stable and exist at high concentrations in the electrolyte, avoiding the limitation of mass transfer on the anode surface and increasing the process efficiency.39 Compared to active chlorine, these oxidants are more environmentally friendly because they are non-toxic, biodegradable, and can induce reactive radical generation, such as sulfate radicals in the presence of catalysts, cathodic reduction or supplying energy (heat, UV, etc.) to (eqn (16)).40 S2O82− + hv → 2˙SO4−E0 (SO42−/˙SO4−) = 2.4 V vs. NHE(16)


2.1.2. Cathodic processes. 
In aqueous media, the anodic oxidation process is usually coupled with a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eqn (17)) at the cathode for the generation of valuable H2 fuel as well as simultaneous decontamination of organic pollutants on the anode in a single/divided electrochemical device using only water as a raw material. Actually, in addition to the energy recovery from capturing H2 energy, the cathodic process can also be used for destructing pollutants by directly reducing organics or metal ions, as well as mediated oxidation by the cathodically generated H2O2. 2H+ + 2e− → H2E0 = 0.0 V vs. NHE(17)
(1) Direct reduction. 
Electroreduction on the cathode has been used as an effective approach for the detoxification and partial degradation of pollutants. For example, nitrate can be selectively reduced to ammonium, nitrite, nitrogen, etc., by electrochemical reduction.6 Notably, the most famous application of electroreduction is in the dehalogenation of non-biodegradable organic halo-compounds, which has been considered to be faster and more efficient than the AO process under mild conditions. However, the cathodic reduction is a partial degradation strategy, which would bring about more toxic and refractory byproduct accumulation. Sometimes, poor decontamination would promote polymerization reactions, which progressively form fouling on the cathode and decrease the removal efficiency due to irreversible passivation.
(2) Cathodic electrogeneration of H2O2. 
Recently, intensive efforts have been put into the cathodic electrogeneration of H2O2, which is also called electroperoxidation due to its relatively high efficiency and selectivity. H2O2 can be in situ and continuously generated in bulk by the cathodic reduction of oxygen (pure oxygen or bubbled air) both in acidic and alkaline media (eqn (18) and (19)). O2(g) + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2E0 = 0.67 V vs. RHE(18) O2(g) + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH−(19)
Actually, the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) transforming O2 to H2O2 has become a hot topic and is undergoing extensive research within the field of fuel cells (Fig. 3A and B).41 Modin et al. have used microbial electrochemical cells for the treatment of wastewater on the anode whilst producing H2O2 at the cathode.42 However, when the anodes were fed with real wastewater, only 84 mg L−1 of H2O2 was produced at a current of 0.1 mA mL−1 (Fig. 3C). The scale-up application in water treatment has been impeded by several major limitations, including the low solubility of oxygen in the electrolyte, slow electron transfer and mass transport, low current efficiency and H2O2 stability in water, which involves the cell configuration and operational conditions. To solve these problems, Cui and co-workers built a feasible small-scale pilot wastewater treatment system containing a H2O2 electrolysis reactor and a Fenton filter (Fig. 3D).43 The system is highly effective for degrading synthetic wastewater (100% mineralization rate in 100 h) by activating H2O2 into ˙OH at pH 7. The total cost of the electrolysis reactor with an H2O2 production rate of 10 g L−1 is US$4.66 m−3, which is lower than the market price, the transportation and storage of every cubic metre of H2O2.

Among all the common reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g., H2O2, O3, ˙OH and ˙O, whose chemical reactivity originated from the oxygen molecule's unpaired electron, H2O2 possesses a relatively weaker reactivity according to the redox potential shown in Fig. 4. However, it can be activated to generate highly reactive radicals to enhance removal efficiency when coupled with other reactions.

2.1.3. Coupled processes. 
(1) Electro-Fenton and related Fenton-based processes. 
H2O2/Fe2+ is the typical Fenton reagent, which involves the catalytic activation of H2O2 to produce powerful homogeneous ˙OH with the dissolved Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair, as shown in eqn (20). H2O2 + Fe2+ → ˙OH + Fe3+ + OH−(20)
One of the main drawbacks of the conventional Fenton process in practical implementation is the use of the chemical Fenton reagent and the accumulation of iron sludge, whereas the EF process provides a straightforward strategy for on-site production of H2O2 and solves the issues associated with the inherently slow rate of Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle.44 H2O2 can be in situ electrogenerated by cathodic reduction of O2, and Fe3+ can be reduced to Fe2+ by the excess H2O2viaeqn (21) or the electrons on cathode viaeqn (22), maintaining the catalytic cycle (Fig. 5A).45 Apart from the continuous cathodic regeneration, a sacrificial iron anode could also supply Fe2+ simultaneously in an undivided cell, according to eqn (23).46 Both the anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction contribute to the efficiency of the EF process by generating amounts of ROS on the surface of the electrode and in bulk solution. The initial supply of Fe2+ can be reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that of the traditional Fenton method by running the process. In addition, the generated H2O2 can work as a weak acid and buffering agent, ensuring the acidic or neutral solution pH and reducing the formation of iron precipitation. H2O2 + Fe3+→ ˙HO2 + Fe2+ + H+(21) Fe3+ + e− → Fe2+(22) Fe → Fe2+ + 2e−(23)

The EF process is effective even in degrading the most persistent organic pollutants. However, H2O2 can also be oxidized to oxygen at the anode viaeqn (24) and (25) in an undivided cell, diminishing the acumination of H2O2 and decreasing the removal efficiency by generating weaker hydroperoxyl radicals (˙HO2). Besides, the reduction of efficiency is also related to iron precipitation, such as Fe(OH)3 on the cathode surface, due to the high pH value. According to the Fenton reaction, the production of ˙OH is efficient only below pH 4, which means some efforts need to be made to minimize the demand for acidification in the EF process and extend the working pH range to circumneutral values, thus, promoting the practical implementation of the EF process. H2O2 → ˙HO2 + H+ + e−(24) ˙HO2 → O2 + H+ + e−(25)
(2) Artificial and solar photoelectro-Fenton processes. 
The photoelectro-Fenton process (PEF) is based on the generation of ˙OH in the presence of artificial UV irradiation or natural sunlight by direct photolysis of H2O2 according to eqn (26).47 Besides, more ˙OH is produced during the Fe2+ recovery reaction by the photo-reduction of photoactive Fe(III)–hydroxy complexes at acidic pH according to eqn (27) in the photo-assisted process. During the EAOP treatment, the refractory organics may interact with metal ions, forming some refractory complexes, which can be directly photo-decarboxylated into weak oxidizing species such as superoxide anion radical and carbon dioxide anion radical along with the regeneration of Fe2+ (eqn (28)), thus accelerate the degradation of pollutant. H2O2 + hv (<280 nm) → 2˙OH(26) FeOH2+ + hv → ˙OH + Fe2+(27) Fe3+ (R)n + hv → ˙Rox + Fe2+(L)n−1(28)
Furthermore, the light irradiation of other species can lead to the production of other oxidating agents.48 For instance, persulfate can lead to the production of sulfate radical (SO4˙−) and ClO− can contribute to Cl˙ and ˙OH. The high efficiency of the PEF process involves factors like appropriate pH range, irradiation source (artificial or solar), wavelength and light intensity and radiation time, which makes it a complex system.
(3) Other integrated processes. 
Recently, the integration of ultrasound techniques with electrochemical processes such as electrocoagulation, EF, and electrooxidation has received significant attention, and been considered as a clean and advanced strategy for environmental remediation.49,50 The synergy between ultrasound irradiation and the electrochemical process is related to the sonolysis complex oxidation mechanism and the cavitation bubble potential to improve mass transfer at the solution/electrode interface and contribute to the peeling and cleaning of the electrode surface.51 Davide Clematis and co-workers compared the oxidation performance of sonoelectrochemical and electrochemical processes in degrading Allura Red AC and Erythrosine B.52 Under the optimal parameters, a great enhancement was observed in the sonoelectrochemical process with a Ti/PbO2 anode and a stainless-steel cathode, suggesting that ultrasound amplitude significantly increases the degradation efficiency.
To further improve the removal efficiency, Lee et al. have explored a two-stage system which sequentially combined EF process and electrochemical chlorination process for the treatment of nonbiodegradable organics and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+–N) at high concentrations in real anaerobically digested food wastewater (ADFW) (Fig. 5B).55 The results showed that the EF process acted as a pretreatment step which contributed to a significant TOC loss with ca. 25% of NH4+ decomposition by generating a great amount of ˙OH and the subsequent chlorination process with a DSA anode achieved almost complete NH4+ degradation and major conversion into N2 by the production of HOCl and OCl− without an external supply of chloride in real ADFW. The EF-chlorination system achieved high efficiency and low energy consumption. Wang et al. further brought up a self-powered electrochemical system (SPECS) combining the Fenton reaction on the cathode and active chlorine generation on the anode for the removal of contaminants.56 They used a rotary triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG) as an electric power source driven by mechanical energy or wind flow, with an electrochemical cell containing modified graphite felt cathode for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) along with ˙OH generation reaction and a platinum sheet anode for active chlorine generation (Fig. 5C). The integrated R-TENG provided 3.5 times the electric power for the function of the electrochemical cell, which efficiently degraded RhB and MB under neutral conditions without any O2 aeration. Bio-degradation processes can also be integrated with electrochemical processes as illustrated by Lei et al.,53 who studied a two-stage bioreactor capable of simultaneous adsorption and ion exchange in combination with electrochemical oxidation to treat leachate. In order to generate more oxidants for environmental use, Jin and coworkers have presented a strategy to achieve modular electrochemical synthesis (ModES) of strong oxidants including H2O2 and Na2S2O8 or active chlorine by decoupling and pairing the oxidative and reductive half-reactions with a heterogeneous redox reservoir (RR).57 As shown in Fig. 5D, anodic and cathodic processes can be carried out independently to generate H2O2 and S2O82− without a membrane in the modular ModES system, enabled by the use of sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate (Na–NiHCF) serving as a robust and reversible RR that stores and releases electrons/ions to pair up sequentially in two separate cells. This ModES system was demonstrated by continuous operation for over 100 cycles (∼36 h) to produce H2O2 and Na2S2O8 with high voltage efficiency.

2.2. Organic pollutant removal by EAOPs
With all the recent advances in generating these strong chemical oxidants including hydroxyl radicals (OH˙), sulfate radicals (˙SO4−), ozone (O3), chlorine (Cl2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by electrocatalysis, EAOPs have been proved to be effective at the removal and mineralization of a wide range of recalcitrant pollutants in simulated wastewater and real wastewater. These effluents include but are not limited to phenolic compounds, per-fluorinated organics, chlorinated organics, and disinfection by-products, landfill leachates, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, human waste, and various industrial waste streams.
Some critical research has found that different oxidants could show preferred reaction pathways and kinetics towards different compounds. For example, Pan et al. compared the selectivity of different oxidants towards a variety of organic compounds.58 As demonstrated in Fig. 6, OH˙ exhibits similar selectivity toward most pollutants and would be the first choice for degrading effluents mainly containing aliphatic compounds. Almost all the oxidants, especially for O3, show high reactivity toward phenols and aromatic amines featuring unsaturated CC bonds, phenolic hydroxylic groups, and electron-rich amino groups, while the order of selectivity for aliphatic amines follows the trend of HClO > HO˙ > ˙CO3− > ˙SO4− > O3 > 1O2. For these wastewaters containing refractory pollutants such as benzenes bearing –NO2, –COOR, –CH(CH3)2, –OCH2COOH, –NH–C(O)–NR2, and halogen groups, most of the oxidants show low selectivity except for OH˙ and ˙SO4−. According to the unique properties of each oxidant and selective oxidation strategy, we should choose specific electrochemical techniques for wastewater decontamination including anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton, as well as photoelectro-Fenton and solar photoelectron-Fenton techniques. In addition, techniques such as peroxide flocculation, electrochemical peroxidation, and ultrasonic electric Fenton have also been applied in water treatment.59 Recent information on the electrochemical technical degradation of organic pollutants is shown in Table 1.

3. Emerging electrocatalysts for EAOPs
3.1. Electrocatalysts for hydroxyl radicals
As has been discussed in Section 2.1.1, two typical behaviours have been observed in oxidizing pollutants with EAOPs. Nonactive anode materials, such as BDD, SnO2 and PbO2, do not participate in the process to a great extent and their roles are involved with the promotion of radical formation.10 Normally, nonactive anodes have large O2 evolution overpotential, and the radicals generated are physisorbed, which means that the force of interaction is weak and radicals are barely attached to the electrode.104 In contrast, the “active” anodes with low O2 evolution overpotential are restricted to the generation of free radicals and often produce soft and partial oxidation of organics, leading to the formation of polymers and refractory species as final products. Examples of common active anode materials are Pt, Ru and Ir oxides and graphite.105 Generally, removal efficiency has been observed to be strictly related to selected electrode materials and the characteristics of common anode materials for environmental remediation are summarized in Table 2.

3.1.1. Noble metal electrodes. 
One of the most common noble metal electrodes, the Pt anode, has been used for a long time in electrochemical processes due to its good conductivity, corrosion resistance and long service time even in intensely aggressive media.106 On the one hand, noble metal electrodes can directly oxidize pollutants at high potentials through direct electron transfer between the adsorbed organic pollutant and the anode. On the other hand, at low electrode potentials, the noble metal anode generates chemisorbed ˙OH and permits only selective conversion of organics for mineralization. For example, Li and co-workers have investigated the performance and the degradation mechanism of phenol at three different types of anodes, Pt, Ti/RuO2 and Ti/SnO2–Sb.107 They found that the degradation rates over noble metal catalysts of Ti/RuO2 and Pt anodes were much faster than that over Ti/SnO2–Sb. However, intermediates including benzoquinone and organic acids were accumulated at the surfaces of Ti/RuO2 and Pt. Results showed that phenols with electron-donor groups (e.g., OH− and NH2−) are more easily oxidized than those with electron-withdrawing groups, but even when all parent compounds were degraded and the process occurred under the best conditions, no total conversion to CO2 could be obtained. The indirect mineralization pathway of phenol consisted of forming hydroquinone and benzoquinone with their subsequent conversions into maleic and succinic or oxalic acids, which are persistent in furthering electro-oxidation.108 To enhance their mineralization activity, noble metal electrodes can be mixed with other metals forming metal alloys such as Pt–Au, Ru–Pd and Au–Pd.109 However, metal alloys are rarely applied in water remediation due to the high price and limited supply.


3.1.2. Metal oxides: PbO2. 
PbO2 is another common nonactive metal oxide anode used in water remediation attributed to the merits of high overpotential for oxygen evolution, strong oxidation ability, chemical stability, facile preparation, good electrical conductivity and low cost.110 The removal of nitrobenzene and total organic carbon (TOC) from the treated wastewater (50 mg L−1) reached 89.35% and 74.23%, respectively, when hydrophobic PbO2 anodes were modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. A higher generation rate of active ˙OH (k[˙OH] = 28.59 min−1) on the surface of this hydrophobic PbO2 has been confirmed by various techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV absorbance spectrometry.111 However, the effects of physiochemical properties on the mechanism for ˙OH generation and its electrochemical reactions with organics are still far from well understood. The research focused on the behaviour of PbO2 electrodes postulated that the electrochemical reactions take place in the light of the gel–crystal structure of PbO2 and ˙OH formation occurs in a hydrated lead oxide gel layer (eqn (29)–(31)).112 PbO2 + H2O → Pb*O(OH)2 → H2PbO3(29) Pb*O(OH)2 → Pb*O(OH)+(OH)˙ + e−(30) Pb*O(OH)+(OH)˙ + H2O → Pb*O(OH)2…(OH)˙ + H+(31)
However, the undesirable OER still occurred on the PbO2 electrode, with the produced active oxygen diffusing to the surface of the matrix to form an oxide insulator, undermining the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of PbO2 based electrodes, some modification strategies such as element doping, introducing functional layers or nano-architecture into their coating are attempted. For instance, a nano-diamond doped PbO2 anode with reduced Ti nanotubes as the interlayer has exhibited average current efficiency of 30%, 1.5 times higher than that of a non-doped PbO2 anode, due to its higher OER overpotential, larger active area and smaller charge transfer resistance.113 Actually, various dopants, including metal elements (Ni, Co, Bi, Al, Cu and Ce),114 non-metal elements (F, P, graphite, and nano-diamond)113–115 and metal oxides have been regarded as prominent dopants for modifying the electrochemical properties of PbO2 electrode due to their unique characteristics. Niu and co-workers prepared a multi-wall carbon nanotube-modified nanocrystalline PbO2 anode, whose OER and effective area were 1.5- and 3.7-fold higher than those of the traditional PbO2 electrode, boosting the pyridine decay rate (93.8%) and mineralization (84.6%) at an energy consumption of 78.8 W h L−1 order−1).116 Tang et al. have further introduced graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and multi-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) with Ti/PbO2 electrode, achieving high degradation efficiency of acetaminophen (83.2%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency (76.3%) by effective suppression of oxygen evolution and enhancing electron transfer.117 One of the main influences of these strategies on electrochemical performance would be reducing the microcrystal grain size, which correlated to a higher electroactive surface area, more active sites, and lower charge transfer resistance with more active oxygen species. Nevertheless, there is a risk of Pb ion leaching from the electrodes during the electrolysis, which has limited the wide use of these electrodes in industrial water treatment applications.


3.1.3. Mixed metal oxide electrodes. 
Dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs), which consist of a Ti substrate coated with a thin conducting layer of metal oxide or mixed metal oxide (MMO) (Ti, Ru, Ir, Sn, and Sb) have been widely explored in finding suitable coatings for electrochemical applications.118 Decades of research investigating and applying catalysts in the process of chlor-alkali electrolysis have led to the development of anodes with RuO2 as the electroactive surfaces, mixed with nearly 70% of rutile TiO2 and deposited on a Ti substrate (DSA-Cl2, Ti/TiO2RuO2), while anodes coated with IrO2 have been commercially used for promoting the OER (DSA-O2, Ti/Ta2O5–IrO2) in acidic media for electrochemical processes.119 The MMO anodes have high corrosion-resistant properties and are resistant to dissolution, which have been found effective in the degradation of a wide range of organics. However, Ganzoury et al. found that even IrO2–RuO2 exhibited high removal efficiency (97%) of methyl orange (MO) in model solutions, moderate decreases (13% reduction in TOC, 96% reduction in Fe and 30% reduction in arsenic) were observed after 1 h of treatment, suggesting that degradation of mixed industrial wastewater in practice is more challenging.120 In addition, precious-metal-based MMO still suffers from high costs and limited supply.
Another typical MMO-based electrode is SnO2–PbO2-based coating that is relatively economical with high overpotential for the OER. Ti/SnO2 electrodes are more effective for wastewater treatment due to the significant accumulation of ˙OH at the “nonactive” surface, but they still suffer from limited service life and poor conductivity due to the presence of multiple cracks on the surface during thermal deposition preparation. Nevertheless, the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity can be improved by adding dopants like B, Bi, F, and, in particular, Sb in electrochemical applications.121 For example, the oxide fine-mesh electrodes composed of Sb-doped SnO2 provided 68% mineralization of the 30 mg L−1 textile azo dye to CO2 at 30 mA cm−2 in a solid polymer electrolyte filter-press reactor.122 Inserting an intermediate layer such as Pt, TiO2, IrO2 and graphene is a universal strategy to strengthen the bonding between the active electrode layer and the matrix, avoid the shedding of the active layer, improve the activity and prolong the electrode service life.121 Mameda et al. demonstrated that inserting the mixed C and N interlayers between the Ti substrate and Sb–SnO2 catalyst could extend the lifetime 25 times longer than that of the Ti/Sb–SnO2 electrode.123 However, Sb is a toxic substance with an EPA drinking water limit of 6 μg L−1. To overcome the problem of Sb leaching, researchers have focused on exploring new catalysts or strategies. Hoffmann and co-workers reported a heterojunction anode which used an Sb–SnO2 oxide layer as an ohmic contact and a nickel-doped Sb–SnO2 layer (NAT) with a substantially lower Sb content as an outer catalytic layer (NAT/AT).124 The two-layer NAT/AT anode has significantly longer operational lifetimes, lower Sb leaching potential, and higher activities for free radical generation and ozone production (Fig. 7).

3.1.4. Carbon-based electrodes: boron-doped diamond (BDD). 
The boron-doped diamond electrode is currently regarded as the most promising and state-of-the-art anode material for the production of physisorbed ˙OH in EAOPs, because it has a wide potential window for water discharge, high OER overpotential, weak species adsorption, good stability, and corrosion-resistance.125 As a nonactive electrode, the large potential range of BDD is from −1.25 to 2.3 VNHE, which minimizes the generation of oxygen and/or hydrogen. This allows for high yields of weakly adsorbed ˙OH on its inert surface, leading to high mineralization compared to other anodes. Yang et al. have systematically compared different anode materials in the oxidation of the anti-cancer drug imatinib (IMA) in the processes EF and AO-H2O2.126 They found that the oxidation/mineralization power of different anodes is ranked as BDD > Ti4O7 > Pt > DSA (Fig. 8A).

(B) Surface functional groups present on hydrogenated and oxidized BDD film electrodes. Reproduced with permission from ref. 135. Copyright 2018 Elsevier. 
Compared with traditional electrodes, BDD has the ideal properties as an anode material for electrochemical degradation due to the greater mineralization, current efficiency and stability under almost all experimental conditions. One of the commercially available BDD, DiaChem® electrode (Condias, Germany),127 consisting of metal-based materials (e.g. Si, Nb, Ti, and W) coated with conductive polycrystalline diamond film by hot-filament chemical vapour deposition, has exhibited a high OER overpotential and excellent chemical inertness with extended service life. The high yields of free ˙OH can unselectively and completely mineralize diverse organic pollutants, especially in real wastewater systems, including those toxic refractory persistent organics. Panizza and co-workers have applied BDD anodes in the electro-oxidation of real wastewaters including paper mill wastewater128 and landfill leachate129 and found that BDD enables complete COD, color and ammonium removal, greater current efficiency along with a lower energy cost compared to those of TiRuSnO2 and PbO2.
The level of boron doping, morphology roughness, specific surface area, surface termination and defects, BDD layer thickness and sp2/sp3 ratio would greatly influence the electrochemical properties and corrosion resistance over BDD electrodes. The diamond sp3-hybridised orbital structure guarantees weak adsorption ability towards intermediates and corrosion resistance during long-term cycling from hydrogen to oxygen evolution even in strongly acidic media, indicating that high content of sp3 carbon favoured greater TOC and COD decomposition by electrochemical mineralization with hydroxyl radicals. In addition, by incorporating graphite sp2 carbon impurities in BDD, the potential window tends to narrow, achieving similar voltammetric features to the glassy carbon (GC) electrode.130 By using an elevated temperature oxidation etching method, the content of sp2 phase on the surface of Si/BDD electrode was reduced along with an increased surface area by 3.9 times. The removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride was increased by 1.57 times, and TOC removal was increased by 1.74 times compared with BDD.131 The surface functional groups such as the oxygenated-functional groups (i.e., hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl) have also shown significant effects on charge transfer and compound oxidation at the BDD surface, which is related to the combination of hydrophobic, dipole, and catalytic interactions (Fig. 8B).132 DFT calculations confirmed experimental findings showing that the electrode potential for generation of ˙OH decreased from 2.74 VNHE to 2.29 VNHE when incorporating oxygenated functional groups (carbonyl and hydroxyl sites).133 Moreover, Gomez-Ruiz and co-workers revealed that a higher sp3/sp2 ratio of carbon content, lower B- and H-terminated carbon content benefited the PFOA degradation rate and efficiency.134
Although laboratory and pilot tests of BDD electrodes have shown high mineralization rates with pollutants, the upscale industrial application of diamond electrodes is still greatly limited by the relatively high cost ($7000 m−2) of diamond and boron dopant contents and the synthesis procedure, complex geometries, and other implementation constraints such as equipment and appropriate substrate.


3.1.5. Doped- and sub-stoichiometric TiO2. 
Recently, new sub-stoichiometric titanium oxide (Ti4O7) has received significant attention as a new cost-effective electrode ($0.36 m−2 for laboratory-scale synthesis) in the fields of rechargeable Li-ion batteries,136 fuel cells and electrocatalysis137 and water treatment.126 It exhibited better performance than that of the classical anode Pt and DSA, with similar oxidation capability with BDD at a relatively low current density for the electro-oxidation of pollutants. Ti4O7 belongs to the sub-stoichiometric titanium oxide (TinO2n−1, 3 < n < 10) with a conductive Magnéli phase generated by the reduction of TiO2 at elevated temperatures. By creating oxygen deficiencies in the lattice structure, Ti4O7 has good corrosion resistance and electrochemical stability with an electrical conductivity of 166 Ω−1 cm−1, much higher than TiO2 with 10−9 Ω−1 cm−1.138 When operated in a flow-through mode, porous Ti4O7 anodes achieve higher mass transport rates compared to traditional parallel plate electrochemical cells (e.g., BDD) with high surface area. Chaplin and co-workers139 used Magnéli phase Ti4O7 ceramic anodes in a reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) system for the removal of PFOA and PFOS (Fig. 9A). The system achieved 5-log removal of both PFOA and PFOS with residence times of ∼11 s and the energy consumption (per log removal) was an order of magnitude lower than those of other AOPs such as ultrasonication, photocatalysis, vacuum ultraviolet photolysis etc. The commercially available Ti4O7 is called Ebonex®, which has been used in various lab-scale applications.140 In order to further enable the generation of ˙OH concentration and improve the degradation efficiency, Xie et al. developed a flow anode system (Fig. 9C) with 4–16 μm TixO2x−1 particles as the anode material at 1.5 V in the anode tank.141 They found that by using the polarized flow anode with a steady generation of ˙OH (5.4 ×10−12 mol m−2), the oxidation performance with pollutants (tetracycline and orange II) was significantly increased and the energy cost of removal per order of contaminants is 1.5−6.7 Wh m−3, which is 1−4 orders of magnitude lower than those of photocatalysis and EF techniques.

Copyright 2021 Elsevier. 
However, Ti4O7 cannot be merely classified into active and nonactive categories. It was found that the ˙OH species produced on Ebonex® are less abundant but more reactive than those formed on BDD, which means the oxidation mechanism over Ti4O7 would be different from that of BDD. El-Sherif and co-workers have reported that the passivation on Ti4O7 (Ebonex) electrodes was reversible upon cathodic polarization and the periodic polarity reversed during the oxidation of sulfide was able to prevent electrode passivation, indicating that Ti4O7 may exhibit characteristics of both active and nonactive electrodes.142 More in-depth mechanistic studies on the reactivation of the Ti4O7 passivation layer and the role of the active oxygens (M(˙OH) and MOx+1) in the electro-oxidation are needed. Besides, the cost and feasibility of large-scale production of Ti4O7 anodes have not been determined given that their manufacture involves reduction at temperatures >1000 °C.
Over-reduction of TiO2 creates a structure that is brittle and less conductive, lessening its service life. Doping or loading TiO2 with other elements such as C, Fe, B, Ce and Pd may also alter the electrochemical properties of electrodes, accelerating interfacial charge transfer, enhancing conductivity and durability, thus, improving the EAOP performance.144,145 For instance, Xie et al. found that the introduction of a small amount of carbon materials (0.1–2 wt %) in Ti4O7 could significantly facilitate the charge transfer process and decrease the OER potential.144 The enhancement of interfacial electron transfer is closely related to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon material surface, while the further transformation to carboxyl groups in long-term operation has retarded the electron transfer and oxidation of contaminants.
The merits and demerits of common anode materials discussed above are listed in Table 3. For RuO2-based and IrO2-based anodes, they are more suitable for specific contaminants using CER reaction. While for BDD and Ti4O7, if more efforts are put on decreasing its synthesis costs, they could have a wider application in water treatment.

3.2. Electrocatalysts for ozone
The decomposition of ozone in water mainly forms hydroxyl radicals that are highly active towards water remediation. In the electrolysis method, ozone is produced by water decomposition. Electrode materials usually capable of producing ozone include Pt, BDD, PbO2 and Ni/Sb–SnO2. The catalysts used for producing ozone reported in recent years are summarized and shown in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Electrode materials used for electrochemical ozone production.146–157 
The PbO2 is a typical inert electrode that is used for in situ electrochemical production of ozone. The degradation of contaminants relies on the oxidation of both ozone and ˙OH generated on the PbO2 electrode. In addition, ozone decomposition in water also generates ˙OH.150 The Ni–Sb–SnO2 is also capable of effectively producing ozone, which outperforms commercial anodes for treating pharmaceutical compounds and pathogens in electrolyte solutions and latrine wastewater.124 In addition to the non-precious metal electrodes, the precious metal Pt-doped materials exhibited outstanding ozone production performance. Pt-doped BNC electrode was designed for the degradation of pesticides and antibiotics through in situ ozone production by Gu et al.157 Pt atoms and B sites demonstrated synergistic effects, i.e., B sites can adsorb molecular oxygen intermediates effectively, while Pt atoms can stably adsorb hydroxide, thus promoting water decomposition. Pt-SAs/BNC showed beneficial ozone-producing properties, with a Faraday efficiency of 21%. Meanwhile, the generated ozone with this electrode can almost completely remove carbendazim, chloramphenicol and tetracycline from water. In addition, BDD electrodes also exhibit excellent activity towards electrochemical ozone production.147
3.3. Electrocatalysts for chlorine
Chlorine-mediated approach has been instrumental in oxidizing a diversity of organics but particularly suitable for the treatment of real wastewater with high sodium chloride concentrations.128 Besides, electrochemical disinfection with chlorine was found to be more efficient than traditional chemical disinfection.
The most common electrode materials for in situ generation of active chlorine are based on MMO or BDD, which have good electrocatalytic properties for chlorine evolution and selectivity and stability. In particular, DSA-Cl2, as presented in Section 3.1.3, has already become one of the most striking technological breakthroughs and has been widely employed for chlorine evolution in the chlor-alkali industries for over 50 years.158 However, when DSA-Cl2 anode was applied for the treatment of ship ballast water or real wastewater, the anodic corrosion and dissolution of RuO2 still remained a fundamental challenge to address. In order to enhance the anodic corrosion resistance of DSA, Lee et al. have fabricated ultrafine RuO2 (1.7 nm) nanoparticles dispersed onto a highly conductive Nb-doped TiO2 support.159 They confirmed that Nb doping not only enhanced the electronic conductivity and suppressed the OER reactivity of TiO2 support, but also enabled thermal diffusion of Ti atoms into the RuO2 lattice, forming ultrafine solid-solution nanoparticles with TiO2 surface as a protective layer. The passivation layer inhibited the dissolution of Ru active sites, leading to a superior activity and selectivity toward active chlorine generation (10 mA cm−2 at 22 mV overpotential with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.3% in 0.6 M NaCl) with a small loading amount of 1.1 at. % Ru, surpassing that of commercial DSA (Fig. 11A). However, using MMOs induces another issue, i.e., the concomitant oxygen generation during the CER, especially for low Cl− concentrations and a neutral environment. Kwak et al. reported atomically dispersed Pt–N4 sites doped on a carbon nanotube (Pt1/CNT) for CER with excellent activity and near 100% selectivity at low Cl− concentrations (0.1 M) in both acidic and neutral media, whereas the MMO catalyst shows substantially lower CER selectivity (Fig. 11B).160 The excellent selectivity of atomically dispersed catalysts under a wide range of Cl− concentrations and pH values envisions their promising applicability in wastewater treatments. Wang and co-workers later discovered that regulating the tip effect on single-atom and cluster catalysts could further enhance their CER efficiency.161 They brought up the oxidized sub-nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide (Ir = 0.40 wt%) for chlorine generation and found that the sub-nano catalysts with appropriate tip effect and electronic structure of the coordinated unsaturated O atom exhibit much higher efficiency (∼20% decrease of the electricity, ∼98% selectivity and high durability of over 350 h) than those of the Ir SACs and state-of-art DSA. This can be ascribed to the modification of lowering the excessively strong electronic metal–support interaction of the single-atom and realizing the appropriate adsorption process and low energy barrier (Fig. 11C). This cluster catalyst displays great potential for practical applications.

The use of noble metals (RuO2 or IrO2 with TiO2) would limit global scalability and increase the operating costs of such electrochemical processes. For this reason, Lewis and co-workers illustrated that crystalline transition-metal antimonates (TMAs), such as NiSb2Ox, CoSb2Ox, and MnSb2Ox, are moderately active and stable catalysts for CER (Fig. 11D).162 Among them, CoSb2Ox exhibited the highest stability and selectivity with a galvanostatic potential of 1.804 V vs. NHE at 100 mA cm−2 in 4.0 M NaCl (aq.) and less than 1 nm of metals was lost after 250 h of operation, which was lower than that of dimensionally stable RuTiOx.
Active chlorine is found to be more efficient than ˙OH in destroying aromatic molecules.163 But for real effluents containing chloride, the disinfection for EAOPs did not solely rely on active chlorine levels and would result in the accumulation of persistent DBPs and perchlorates, which have documented health risks.164 Chaplin's group has shown that the fluorination of the BDD surface could significantly decrease the formation of ClO4− from rates of 0.28 ± 0.01 mmol m−2 min−1 on a bare BDD electrode to below detectable levels (<0.12 μM m−2 min−1), achieving 0.06% selectivity for ClO4− during 10 mM NaCl oxidation.165 The long fluorinated chains created a blocking layer on the BDD surface that inhibited charge transfer via steric hindrance and hydrophobic effects. In addition to BDD, other carbonaceous materials are also proven to be capable of generating RCS under more practical conditions. Elimelech and co-workers have fabricated a hybridized carbon nanotube (CNT)-functionalized ceramic membrane (h-CNT/CM) used for membrane self-cleaning by in situ generating RCS.166 The high hydrophilic, permeable, and conductive membrane under electrolysis could produce a high concentration of localized reactive chlorine, resulting in rapid and complete degradation of carbamazepine and an organic foulant (sodium alginate), achieving near complete water flux recovery after a short (1 min) self-cleaning.
3.4. Electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide
As mentioned above, there are two promising routes for electrochemical generation of H2O2, which are two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e− WOR) at anodes and two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) at cathodes (Fig. 12). We have summarized the latest electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in Table 4. Generally, the research on ORR towards H2O2 is further ahead and has been covered extensively in the literature compared to the 2e− WOR due to the thermodynamic unfavorability of the pathway and the limited performance between selectivity and current efficiencies of suitable materials.167 Therefore, 2e− WOR is less commonly used in the application of water treatment by hardly maintaining excellent selectivity when working at high current densities, whereas a number of representative research and excellent reviews are available for detailed insights into material development in laboratory-scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.168

3.4.1. Electrocatalysts for WOR. 
Wide band-gap metal oxides such as BiVO4, CaSnO3, TiO2, ZnO and WO3 have been found kinetically favourable for H2O2 in the 2 e− WOR due to the weak interactions of *O, *OH, and *OOH with the electrode material.170 BiVO4 has been modified with WO3 and Al2O3, Gd and Mo to achieve a higher FE, H2O2 yield at higher currents and stability.28 According to Table 4, CaSnO3 has been reported as the most stable metal oxide, while ZnO has recorded the lowest overpotential of 40 mV, with a peak %FE of 81% at 3.0 V vs. RHE. Even though most metal oxides achieve remarkable selectivity of water oxidation towards H2O2 at lower electrode potentials, their respective partial current densities are well below 100 mA cm−2.
Carbonaceous materials with high quality, such as BDD, are also found to catalyze H2O2 evolution via 2 e− WOR under acidic conditions.171,172 However, the production rate of H2O2 evolution was poor, as most of them were derived from the recombination of the generated ˙OH. In order to enhance the electrochemical water oxidation towards H2O2 over BDD, Mavrikis et al. have tailored the boron doping level, coating thickness, and crystal size of BDD microfilms.173 The modulated BDD films supported on niobium (Nb) achieved a peak FE of 87% and H2O2 production rate of 76.4 μmol cm−2 min−1, with stability for 10 h at 200 mA cm−2 and electrode potentials below 3 V vs. RHE in K2CO3/KHCO3 solutions. The results indicate that BDD/Nb is an appealing prospective anode candidate for in situ synthesis of H2O2 towards on-site disinfection and water treatment. Apart from BDD, Xia and co-workers have employed modified glassy carbon (GC) and three-dimensional porous carbon fibre paper (CFP) with hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the anode to confine O2 in the way of weakening HO* binding energy and facilitating 2e− WOR.174 After depositing hydrophobic polymers on carbon catalysts, the PTFE-CFP achieved a significant increase of H2O2 FE by six fold to 66% at an overpotential of 640 mV and a record-high H2O2 production rate of 23.4 μmol min−1 cm−2. However, long-term stability still stands in the way of industrial applications for wastewater treatment.


3.4.2. Electrocatalysts for the ORR. 
Alternatively, H2O2 can also be produced by partially reducing O2 at cathodes. As one of the most commonly used H2O2 based EAOPs, EF can promote the formation of ˙OH through activation of H2O2 electrogenerated by the 2e− ORR to efficiently degrade organic pollutants. Since the 1930s, lots of researchers started to focus on the partial electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2 and some authorized reviews have given detailed summaries about the recent advances regarding the electrosynthesis of H2O2 through the 2e− ORR and the emerging electrocatalysts.175,176 These prospective catalysts include noble metals and their alloys, single atom Pt-based catalysts, Co–N/C, Mn–N/C, meso N-doped C etc. Among them, carbon-based materials such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibre, and carbon black, are the most frequently used cathode catalysts in attempted applications that achieved high rates and faradaic efficiencies.177
Hydrophobic modifications, nitrogen/oxygen functionalization or metal oxide modification can enhance 2e− ORR reduction properties.178 For instance, Kuang et al. developed a 2-ethylanthraquinone (EAQ)-modified graphite felt cathode for EF oxidation coupled with a PbO2 anode towards the treatment of livestock wastewater.179 After the electrolysis oxidation, the BOD5/CODCr ratio was increased from 0.084 to 0.42 with 71.5% CODCr removal efficiency at the low Fe2+ concentration of 0.3 mM. In addition, Cui and co-workers developed an effective and general approach to improve the H2O2 performance of various carbon materials by means of surface oxidation treatment.180 Oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) got an enhanced selectivity of up to ≈90% in both basic and neutral electrolytes at a decreased overpotential (≈130 mV at 0.2 mA). The annealed few-layered mild reduction of graphene oxide at 600 °C (F-mrGO (600)) was also found to exhibit outstanding electrochemical HO2− production in terms of activity (<10 mV overpotential), selectivity (≈100%), and stability (over 15 h at 0.45 V) in alkaline media.181
Catalyst selectivity, oxygen mass transfer, and electron transfer at the cathodic reaction interface are essential factors for efficient H2O2 production. By offering a rapid, gas-phase O2 transport to the catalyst, the ORR is further accelerated by gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with enhanced selectivity. As shown by Moreira et al., GDE obtained 8.9 mg h−1 cm−2 of H2O2 and 17.87% of current efficiency at a current density of 75 mA cm−2 with an energy consumption of 118.0 kW h kg−1.182 However, a significant energy loss inevitably occurs when scaling up the H2O2-based EAOPs with GDEs.183
Recently, Zhang et al. designed a superhydrophobic natural air diffusion electrode (NADE) that allows O2 to naturally diffuse to the ORR interface without pumping oxygen/air.184 The NADE greatly enhanced the oxygen diffusion coefficient at the cathode by 4.7 times higher than that of the normal GDE system and recorded 101.67 mg h−1 cm−2 H2O2 production with a high oxygen utilization efficiency (44.5%–64.9%). They applied the NADE in the EF process to oxidize organic contaminants and achieve 100% removal efficiency within 90 min. The TOC removals of 2,4-D, phenol, MB, TC, and SMT at 2 h were 51.1%, 55.1%, 62%, 57.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, at lower energy consumption (36.6–91.7 kW h kg TOC−1).

3.5. Electrocatalysts for other reactive substances
Sulfate radical (˙SO4−, E0 = 2.44 V/NHE) is a strong oxidant and can be more effective than ˙OH due to its electrophilic nature and longer lifetime (˙SO4− = 30–40 μs; ˙OH = 20 ns), which has been widely investigated and applied in environmental remediation.209 BDD anode has been found to be efficient in yielding peroxydisulfate (PDS) in an electrolyte containing SO42− and the electro-oxidation rates can be 10–15 times higher for some contaminants compared to the rates of nitrate anolyte,210 which indicates that anodic oxidation would proceed parallel to the formation of the sulfate radical precursor as illustrated in eqn (32) and (33).211 BDD (˙OH) + SO42− → BDD (˙SO4−) + OH −(32) BDD (˙SO4−) + SO42− → BDD + S2O82− + e−(33)
Where the surface site BDD (˙SO4−) is not as oxidative as ˙SO4− but is sufficient for the generation of PDS, it means PDS and sulfate need to be activated to generate free ˙SO4− through multiple ways such as heat, UV light or cathodic reduction.40,212 Kim and co-workers fabricated carbon-coated TiC nanoarrays (C@TiC NAs) as efficient three-dimensional (3D) electroactive supports and deposited BDD on this 3D support (BDD@TiC NAs) for the electrogeneration of sulfate radicals (Fig. 13B and C).213 Results showed that BDD@TiC NAs exhibited 1.9-fold higher efficiency for benzoic acid degradation and 4.4-fold higher PDS generation than the conventional plate-type BDD electrode. In addition to BDD, nonactive anodes such as PbO2 and SnO2-based electrodes also showed good capability in producing reactive ˙SO4−.214 However, the in situ generation of ˙SO4− by electro-oxidation of sulfate in wastewater is often limited and more persulfates need to be added into the system for highly efficient oxidation of organics. Besides, the mechanism of producing and activating PDS needs in-depth understanding by identifying and confirming the reactive species including ˙SO4− and ˙OH.

Other reactive substances, such as non-radical derivatives of oxygen, the meta-stable singlet oxygen (1O2), can be produced by electrocatalysis as well. Elimelech and co-workers have fabricated a Janus electrocatalytic flow-through membrane, which features double-sided reactive surface sputtering by Pd and Pt nanoparticles on each side of a ceramic membrane (CM) substrate for the generation of highly efficient 1O2 for water decontamination.215 They brought up a superoxide-mediated chain reaction for highly efficient 1O2 generation, which was initiated by electrocatalytic oxygen reduction on the cathodic membrane side and subsequently terminated by H2O2 oxidation on the anodic membrane side. The automated and sustainable flow-through electro-filtration process coupled with the Janus electrocatalytic membrane has achieved efficient 1O2 production (6.9 mmol per m3 of permeate) and low energy consumption (13.3 W h per m3 of permeate), which is highly beneficial for environmental remediation.
4. Perspectives and outlook
EAOPs can be applied as decentralized water treatments and distributed point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatments due to their multiple technical merits, including storage/transportation-free operation, a compact and modular reactor design, and the remotely controllable operation compared to those of the conventional chemical and biological processes. However, there are still some challenges to implementation and upscaling the effective EAOP strategies regarding environmental remediation, especially in developing efficient and robust catalysts.
As illustrated in this review, metal oxides such as PbO2 and SnO2-based electrodes, carbonaceous materials and BDD are extensively applied in water treatment due to their outstanding performance in the production of free reactive species (e.g. ˙OH and RCS). Nevertheless, their industrial and environmental applications on a commercial scale are still limited by the urgent demand to reduce energy consumption and cost. This may be improved by designing suitable reactors, such as flow-through reactors and desirable electrode materials with outstanding electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability. By identifying the structure–performance relationship of materials, more innovative electrocatalysts with specific characteristics have been developed at the bench-scale in the fields of electrocatalysis, such as 2e− ORR and WOR reaction. Furthermore, with the development in materials science and nanotechnology, the nanostructuring, compositing, component regulation (doping and alloying), inserting a robust interlayer, and surface modification of these electrocatalysts can be designed to overcome some intrinsic limitations related to the practical application of the current EAOP treatment, lowering the cost of materials and making the process economically competitive with other conventional technologies in the near future.216
The different properties of reactive species suggest that an optimal removal efficiency to a specific target contaminant can be achieved by matching the oxidants responsible for its degradation based on the contaminant's structure. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the redox potentials of radicals are higher than those of corresponding oxidants such as H2O2, O3, HOCl and OCl−, which means they are more promising in EAOPs. However, the radical chemistry is complicated, and the reaction kinetics and the mechanisms for these reactive species with contaminants are variable, affecting their oxidation efficiencies and transformation pathways. Fang and co-workers have summarized second-order rate constants (k) values for ˙OH and RCS with aromatic and aliphatic compounds containing different functional groups.37 The reactivities of ˙OH toward aromatics are similar at k values varied from 109 to 1010 M−1 s−1, and those of RCS are more selective and dependent on the structures of contaminants (Fig. 14A). For these reasons, to achieve selective and well-controlled transformations of pollutants, the design and selection of different electrochemical processes and their corresponding electrodes can be rationally oriented towards removing specific functional groups or organics in real wastewater. This is especially true for those pre-treatments that aim to improve biodegradability rather than achieve the total mineralization of non-biodegradable species. Coupling processes involving electrochemical reduction and oxidation open up a potentially useful, selective and well-controlled strategy for the remediation of biorecalcitrant compounds.8

Developing novel hybrid technologies is another alternative approach to enhance the electrochemical degradation performance and simultaneously decrease high energy demand in some way. Peng and co-workers proposed a novel sequential dual-cathode electrocatalysis process, which converts oxygen or air to H2O2 and then ˙OH by reagent-free electro-Fenton reaction (Fig. 14B).217 The dual-cathode system demonstrates efficient removal efficiency, high reusability, no iron leaching, and low installation and operation costs by only using air and electricity, which provide a more sustainable route and can be commercially applied to pollution control for real effluents.
Most contaminants present in real water are at low concentrations, which means research on EAOP systems should consider the actual conditions such as the suitable reactor, the operational parameters, the electrolyte composition and the concentrations of contaminants that are lower than those of dissolved salts and organic matter, whose electrochemical reactivity is involved with mass transfer limitations.218 Evaluating electrochemical treatment systems is crucial and critical to minimizing energy consumption of low-concentration chemicals and facilitating further research. Recent research has focused on integrating membrane processes that are compact and easier to adjust to variations in influent water composition and would become a safe and sustainable strategy in the future for water treatment. Electrified membranes (EMs) with different filtration configurations have the potential to tackle practical problems in actual water treatment. By fabricating tailored catalysts or nanomaterials incorporated into the highly electrically conductive and porous material layer, such as carbonaceous materials, metals, metal oxides, and polymers (Fig. 14C),219 EMs can provide a scalable platform for rapid and selective degradation of target contaminants and fouling control in complex water matrices with the merits of enhancements in mass transfer, conversion efficiency and stability. However, commonly used EM materials, such as CNTs and Magnéli phase Ti4O7, still suffer from corrosion, passivation, and membrane fouling and high cost of synthesis. Further efforts are needed to overcome the fundamental obstacles that have so far limited the practical use and find cost-effective, highly efficient and stable materials for EMs during long-term operation for full-scale wastewater treatment.
In addition to the catalyst materials used, one must also consider the form and geometry of the electrodes and the type of reactor in order to strike a balance between properties. The future EAOPs must focus on the design of complete and efficient systems, in which the complementary properties of the catalysts and the reactor lead to optimal selectivity and efficiency.
