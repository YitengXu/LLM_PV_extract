1 Introduction
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a pivotal cathodic process of various electrochemical systems for sustainable energy conversion and chemical synthesis, holds promise for widespread clean technological applications such as fuel cells, metal–air batteries and electrolyzers.1–6 In typical polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), fuels, such as hydrogen or methanol, are electrochemically oxidized at the anode to release electrons while oxygen molecules are reduced to H2O by receiving the electrons coming from the external circuit through the ORR at the cathode.7,8 As large current density can maximize the energy conversion efficiencies, the cathodic ORR studies over the past few decades have been focused on a direct 4e− pathway (eqn (1) and (2)) or a stepwise 2e−/2e− two-step pathway involving hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an intermediate (eqn (3)–(6)). By contrast, the electrochemical oxygen reduction via a selective 2e− transfer pathway for H2O2 generation has long been treated as the side reaction until a recent surge of interest. Remarkably, the newly emerging on-site H2O2 production through an ambient electrosynthesis process offers an attractive cost-effective and energy efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art industrial anthraquinone oxidation–reduction step.3,4,9–14 On the other hand, both ORR-based fuel cells and electrolytic cells prefer a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) stack, which calls for acidic medium ORR catalysis to effectively mitigate the frequently encountered tradeoff between current density (high ionic conductivity), mechanical properties and stability in an alkaline environment, and therefore the inherent sluggish reaction kinetics and accelerated catalyst degradation problems also significantly arose.15 To date, ORR electrocatalysis is indeed making its way into unprecedented combinations of activity, selectivity and stability, yet rational catalyst design and synthesis remain great challenges even though a vast wealth of fundamental understanding has been accumulated through the past efforts.
The 4e− pathway in an alkaline medium is represented as the following: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−, E° = 0.40 V(1)and in an acidic medium as the following: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O, E° = 1.23 V(2)
The 2e− pathway in an alkaline medium is represented as the following: O2 + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH−, E° = 0.06 V(3)which is reduced by the further 2e− process: HO2− + H2O + 2e− → 3OH−, E° = 0.86 V(4)In an acidic medium, O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2, E° = 0.70 V(5)which is reduced by the further 2e− process: H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O, E° = 1.76 V(6)The elementary reaction steps for the 4e− pathway are as follows: (7) (8) O* + H+ + e− → HO*(9) HO* + H+ + e− → H2O*(10) H2O* → * + H2O(11)The elementary reaction steps for the 2e− pathway are as follows: (12) (13) (14)Dissociation of OOH: (15) (16) HOO* + * → O* + HO*(17) O* + H+ + e− → HO*(18) HO* + H+ + e− → H2O + *(19)Dissociation of HOOH: (20) (21) HOO* + H+ + e− → HOOH*(22) HOOH* → 2HO*(23) HO* + H+ + e− → H2O + *(24)
Since the pioneering work of Zhang, Li, Liu and co-workers which demonstrated the feasibility to fabricate the stable and efficient single-atom Pt1/FeOx catalyst, single-atom catalysts (SACs), in particular carbon-based SACs (C-SACs) featuring high electrical conductivity and superior electrochemical stability, have been extensively studied for ORR applications, which demonstrated fascinating properties compared with Pt/C benchmark catalysts.16 The underlying reaction mechanism of the 4e− pathway is adsorption and dissociation of O2 molecules and can be expressed using eqn (7)–(11), where * is the catalyst active site. In the case of the 2e− pathway, the only intermediate HOO* is involved, as shown in eqn (12)–(14). However, the direct cleavage of the O–O bond on the active site requires a high activation energy, so the researchers reported two additional possible pathways for the ORR, namely dissociation of OOH (eqn (15)–(19)) and dissociation of HOOH (eqn (20)–(24)) which were usually considered as the reaction processes in DFT calculations. Regardless of the reaction mechanism, the ORR is typically theoretically interpreted with multiple concerted proton–electron transfer (CPET) processes, and the adsorption energies of oxygenated intermediates HOO*, O* and HO* are identified with the universal linear relation ΔGHOO* − ΔGHO* = 3.2 ± 0.2 eV (0 V RHE, * denotes active sites).17 In terms of C-SACs, the sophisticated descriptor-based approach for deciphering the overall free energy pathway and rational catalyst design also holds true.18,19 First, as for the reaction selectivity, whether the reaction takes a 2e− or 4e− reduction, selectivity towards H2O2 or H2O primarily depends on ΔGHOO*, the binding strength of the key reaction intermediate HOO*, and its derived propensity to break the O–O bond. Second, ΔGHOO* or ΔGHO* can be regarded as a universal descriptor to predict the ORR activity, since HOO* formation or HO* reduction mostly acts as the potential-determining step. Notably, C-SACs with well-defined and uniform single-atom dispersion enable fairly simple and straightforward electronic and structural feature extraction to evaluate this characteristic “bond strength” between the relevant intermediates and the catalysts, providing a unique platform for defining structure-to-performance correlation investigation. Meanwhile, the prevailing characteristics of flexible local structural regulations also point to potential theory-driven structural optimization of SACs compared with other nanostructured counterparts. To date, a number of excellent reviews thoroughly summarized the advances of supported SACs,20–22 but are mainly restricted to an overview of local structural engineering and electrochemical applications, and few reports have specified the C-SAC synthesis and highlighted their ORR electrocatalysis.
In this review, we focus on recent advances in thriving C-SACs for ORR electrocatalysis, emphasizing the experimental efforts towards targeted catalysts with tailored selectivity, activity and the derived progressive guidelines for catalyst design. We first introduce the basics of versatile synthetic methodologies of carbon-based SACs including the fundamentals and merits in some detail. Then we will present a key overview of structure-dependent catalytic selectivity and activity properties. As a prototype, microenvironment modulation on a single-atom active site is systematically revealed on a typical M–N–C moiety (atomic transition metal embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene) from the aspects of regulating the central metal atoms, coordination environment and support properties. Besides, the dual active site enabled synergistic catalysis for breaking conventional adsorption-energy scaling relation is also highlighted. Finally, the current remaining challenges in carbon-based SACs for the ORR are pointed out and the developments toward industrialization in the future are proposed as well.
2 Synthetic methodologies of C-SACs for the ORR
Among all the carbon supports, 2D graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) represent the most investigated candidates for ORR electrocatalysis, benefiting from their facile chemical modifications, excellent electrical conductivity, and large specific surface area.23–30 Besides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are also emerging as self-sacrificing templates for different carbon structures, taking advantage of the unique hierarchical porous structure for spatial confinement.31 Taking pristine graphene as an example, directly loading single metal atoms onto the surface is rather difficult and they are susceptible to migration or agglomeration due to the weak interaction between metal atoms and carbon. Therefore, the synthetic strategies for carbon-based SACs put much emphasis on establishing an enhanced metal–support interaction. While reviewing the recent progress, it can be concluded that typical flexible-tailored carbon nanostructures by introducing intrinsic defects, heteroatom dopants, and functional groups serving as “traps” or “paws” to confine or bind individual separated metal centers have mainly provided the versatile synthesis of various C-SACs (Fig. 1). Furthermore, these tailored atomic configurations are not limited to the stabilizing effect, but also to the fine-tuned electronic structure for optimal chemisorption of key intermediates (HOO*, HO*), which significantly boosts the ORR catalytic activity. Conclusively, the exploration and development of synthetic methodologies for these targeted nanostructures have significantly advanced the C-SACs and their promising applications in the ORR. In the following section, we present a detailed discussion on the experimental details, in particular, the advantages/limitations (Table 1) are also specified.

2.1 Wet chemistry strategy
Wet chemistry methods are now widely used for C-SAC preparation due to simple operating steps, mild operating conditions and great potential for large-scale production. This strategy mainly includes two consecutive steps of impregnation (coprecipitation or deposition–precipitation) and calcination or reduction.16,32 The first step is used to anchor targeted metal atoms by the strong interactions between the functional groups on the support and the metal ions. The second step can further strengthen the metal–support interactions and fully activate the metal species.33 Therefore, low surface density of metal loading and introduction of an appropriate functional group are two essential requirements for the preparation of carbon-based SACs. The former can avoid the aggregation of metal atoms into NPs and the latter can stabilize metal atoms absorbed by functional groups.
Mai et al. successfully synthesized the Co@NCB catalyst (cobalt decorated nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) bowls) through an impregnation method that mixed cobalt acetate with pre-prepared resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) hollow bowls and subsequent pyrolysis at 800 °C under NH3 flow.34 Various characterization studies proved the coexistence of atomically dispersed CoN4 sites and Co NPs in Co@NCB. The obtained catalyst outperformed commercial Pt/C for the ORR in terms of half-wave potential (E1/2) and stability. When applied in zinc–air batteries, a high open circuit voltage of 1.4 V, excellent power density of 275 mW cm−2 and satisfactory stability were achieved. Li et al. prepared the Fe1/N, S-PC (single-atom site Fe/N and S-codoped porous carbon) electrocatalyst by a wet chemistry method in which o-phenylenediamine (oPD) polymerization was performed in a solution containing K3[Fe(CN)6] and (NH4)2S2O8 and the obtained composites were pyrolyzed under H2/Ar flow.34 The as-obtained Fe1/N, S-PC exhibited superior ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.904 V, which was better than that of commercial Pt/C (0.86 V) and single-atom site Fe/N-doped hierarchical porous carbon without S-doping (0.85 V). The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Fe1/N, S-PC was attributed to the synergistic effects of Fe–N4 active sites, N, S co-doping and the hierarchical porous structure in the carbon materials. (The potentials mentioned in this review are all relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) unless otherwise stated.)
2.2 Thermal pyrolysis strategy
By confining single metal atoms in cages existing in the host, the spatial confinement strategy can effectively reduce the migration and aggregation of metal atoms. The spatial confinement strategy generally requires two steps: encapsulating suitable metal precursors into the molecular-scale cages of the host and the post-treatment process to remove the ligands of metal precursors. The most attractive advantage of this strategy is the designability that the anchoring sites, location and configuration of the single metal sites can be controlled at a molecular level. Thence, high loading of metal atoms becomes possible by fine regulation of the anchoring sites. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are most frequently used as host materials to confine metal atoms due to their well-defined structures, high specific surface areas, and tunable morphologies and compositions, by which numerous SACs have been fabricated.
Li et al. successfully synthesized Co SACs with a high metal loading of over 4 wt% by a pyrolysis process involving predesigned bimetallic Zn/Co metal–organic frameworks (BMOFs).36 As shown in Fig. 2a, the Zn/Co BMOF was gradually transformed into NC as the temperature increased. The intentional addition of Zn2+ can not only expand the adjacent distance of Co atoms and then avoid the formation of Co–Co bonds but also greatly increase the specific surface area of the catalyst. The Zn atoms with a low boiling point can be evaporated away at high temperatures over 800 °C and Co nodes were reduced in situ by carbonization of the organic linker. The metal loading can be adjusted just by altering the Zn/Co molar ratio of BMOF. High angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) characterization confirmed the formation of single atoms with the Co–N4 structure (800 °C) and Co–N2 (900 °C) structure, respectively. Interestingly, the catalyst thus obtained exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity to Pt/C (Fig. 2b and c). Similar strategies can be found in ref. 37 and 38.

2.3 Template-assisted pyrolysis strategy
Molding the microstructure of a material through a template is an effective method to improve the activity of a catalyst. SiO2 is the most commonly used hard template. Tang et al. elaborately designed an efficient SiO2-templated strategy to fabricate atomically dispersed Fe atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanospheres.39 As shown in Fig. 2d, the overall synthesis process essentially involved the following steps: (1)uniform coating of histidine and Fe3+ on the SiO2 template, (2) pyrolysis of the resultant nanospheres at high temperature, and (3) etching the SiO2 template and unstable species using hydrofluoric acid (HF). The formed SAC retained the hollow nanosphere structure which was believed to facilitate the effective mass diffusion during the electrocatalytic process. By virtue of the numerous atomically dispersed Fe–N4 moieties and unique spherical hollow architectures, the as-fabricated SAC exhibited excellent ORR performance in an alkaline medium (Fig. 2e and f). A similar strategy can be seen in ref. 40.
Besides SiO2, of course, some other types of templates are also used for the preparation of SACs. As shown in Fig. 2g and h, Shi et al. successfully prepared an Fe SAC and Co SAC by a melt-salt-assisted strategy in which a water-soluble molten salt acted as the template.41 Adenine was gradually carbonized into NC in the molten salt environment during which free metal atoms were trapped by N atoms which arrived from the carbon skeleton. The molten salt was not only a template but its strong polar force greatly prevented the aggregation of metal atoms. Simultaneously, the melt-salt-assisted strategy can directly transform the solid oxide into atomically dispersed FeN4 sites due to the super strong polar force of the molten salt that was enough to break the ionic bonds in the metal oxide. The Fe-based SAC prepared by this method exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity in both alkaline and acid media (Fig. 2i).
2.4 Photochemical reduction strategy
The photochemical reduction strategy has been widely applied for the syntheses of nanocrystals, especially for noble metals.42,43 This strategy involves the absorption of photons and electronically excited states, and the nanocrystal growth strongly relies on the diffusion of the ions and atoms in the solution. Wang et al. fabricated well-defined isolated Pt atoms on NC and the loading of Pt was up to 3.8 wt% in this strategy without post-physical or chemical treatment processes.44 Excitingly, SACs obtained can be used as bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior performance for the HER and ORR in acidic or alkaline solutions.
2.5 Other synthetic strategies
With the continuous efforts of researchers, some intelligently designed synthesis strategies have emerged in the field of SACs. Chen et al. first produced a hollow nitrogen-doped carbon cage (HCN) by pyrolyzing and etching ZIF-8 and then reflowed the HCN with palladium(II) acetate to obtain atomically dispersed Pd sites on the surface of the HCN (Fig. 3a).45 The obtained Pd SAC exhibited an ORR activity markedly higher than that of metallic Pd nanoparticles, commercial Pt/C and relevant Pd-based catalysts reported in the literature. Li et al. successfully prepared an Fe SAC by electrospinning technology which is a simple and low-cost method to produce self-supporting nanofibers.46 As shown in Fig. 3b, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers containing a small amount of hemin obtained by electrospinning first were preoxidized and then pyrolyzed to obtain the desired catalyst. Hemin was uniformly distributed in nanofibers and PAN prevented hemin from agglomeration during this strategy. The catalyst obtained exhibited Pt-like ORR catalyst activity whether in an acidic or alkaline solution due to the high specific surface area, fast mass transfer and electron conduction and Fe–N4 moieties. Wang et al. synthesized single-atom Fe/N-doped short-range ordered carbon loaded on 2D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) via a hierarchical assembly of small N-doped nanographene molecules and single Fe atoms which exhibited high ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.84 V in acidic media (Fig. 3c).47 Yang et al. synthesized non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) electrocatalysts with outstanding ORR activity using Cd as the sacrificial metal instead of Zn in ZIF.48

3 Carbon-based SACs for the ORR with the 4e− pathway
From the viewpoint of coordination chemistry, supports not only serve as ligands to stabilize single atoms, but also help to tune the electronic and/or geometric structures of atomically dispersed metal species. As is known the high activity of metal sites largely originates from their unsaturated d orbitals and various metal centers can exhibit obvious active differences. For a specific metal center, since the single central metal atom has reached the adjustable limit in terms of composition, shape and size, the unique electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the active center, in fact, originate from the corresponding coordination environment and the properties of the support. Different coordination configurations inevitably make active centers have different electronic structures which play an essential role in the catalytic performance.
For the ORR with the 4e− pathway, SACs with the M–N–C coordination afford the state-of-the-art performance where M represents the metal atom, particularly the transition metal atom (TM). In this chapter, we review the recent major developments of SACs from the elemental levels, including the central catalytic atom and introduced heteroatoms, and non-elemental levels as well as the relationship between these configurations and 4e− ORR performance. Table 2 summarizes partial typical configurations of carbon-based SACs and their performances in the ORR.

3.1 TM–N–C structure
The Fe–N–C structure is the most studied configuration due to excellent catalytic activity coming from the ability of Fe sites to directly adsorb O2 and then break the O–O bond.49,50 According to different synthesis conditions, the Fe atom in the Fe–N–C structure is coordinated by the pyridine/pyrrole nitrogen or carbon atoms.51 The different coordination environments naturally make metal atoms have different electronic structures which seriously affects the catalytic performance.
The FeN4 configuration similar to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) seems to be the most stable and easily formed structure. For example, Jiang et al. pyrolyzed a porphyrinic MOF based on a novel mixed-ligand strategy to prepare single-atom iron-implanted NC with the FeN4 structure.52 As shown in Fig. 4a–e, the optimized Fe SAC exhibited excellent oxygen reduction activity in both alkaline and more challenging acidic media via the 4e− pathway. The negligible decay of activity after stability tests demonstrated its excellent durability. In addition to FeN4, the structures with other N coordination numbers are also well studied. Through direct pyrolysis of glucosamine in the presence of bimodal templates, Lin et al. developed an FeN2 structure which exhibited excellent activity and stability for the ORR.53–56 Researchers found that FeN2 outperformed FeN4 due to its lower interaction with *O2 and *OH intermediates and enhanced electron transport (Fig. 4f and g). From both experimental and theoretical points of view, Zhuang et al. revealed systematically the structure–activity relationship of different active sites on FeNx/C which is in the order of Fe–N4/2–C > Fe4–N–C > N–C ≫ Fe4–C ≥ C (Fig. 4h).57 Chen et al. reported a host–guest chemistry strategy to construct different types of Fe–Nx sites with two- to five-coordinated configurations on the porous carbon matrix, and electrochemical tests revealed that the five-coordinated Fe–Nx sites can significantly promote the reaction rate in acid media.58 Hanack and Rein proposed the FeN6 configuration as early as 1988.59 Recently, as shown in Fig. 4i, Su et al. found that the six-coordinated FeN6 complex with tetrapyrrolic N and two pyridinic N atoms may be more durable than FeN4 in acid solution.60

In addition, the changes of active sites in Fe–N–C catalysts during the ORR have been deeply researched. Through in situ XAS studies, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, Mukerjee et al. found three catalysts that exhibited similar trends in which the Fe K-edge shifted toward higher energy with increasing potential, accompanied by the increase in Fe–N/O scattering peak intensity, indicating that the active sites in these catalysts all undergo an Fe2+/Fe3+ redox transition. The Fe2+/Fe3+ redox transition was associated with the oxygen species adsorption (eqn (25) and (26)) and was controlled by the redox potential of the site under aqueous conditions.61 These phenomena can be explained by the models in Fig. 5e. Fe2+–N4 + H2O ↔ OHads–Fe3+–N4 + H+ + e−(25) (26)The structural models of FeTPP-300-C, FeTPP-800-C, and PANI-Fe-C were labeled D2, D1 and D3, respectively. At 0.1 V, D2 possessed a square-planar configuration similar to the porphyrin macrocycle while the active sites in D1 and D3 were located out of the N4-plane. The difference between D1 and D3 lies in that D3 is axially connected to an unknown ligand. The corresponding increases in the Fe-centered coordination number (Fig. 5c) and bond distance (Fig. 5d) caused by O(H)ads with increasing potential were confirmed by EXAFS fitting. The active site was axially connected to O(H)ads when potential increased. The Fe–N bond distance (RFe–N) of D2 (Fe2+–N4) continued to increase with the potential to form OHads–Fe3+–N4. However, the RFe–N in D1 and D3 continued to decrease when the active site moved back to the N4-plane upon the formation of axially bound O(H)ads, contrary to the Fe–N switching behavior observed in FeTPP-300-C. This opposite switching behavior accounted primarily for the exceptional inherent ORR activity of D1 and D3 sites that far exceeded that of D2 sites. Given that FeTPP-800 contained D1 and D2 sites while PANI-Fe-C contained D1 and D3 sites, the superior inherent activity of PANI-Fe-C to that of FeTPP-800 was likely attributed to D3 sites. The result is consistent with the observation of Dodelet et al. that among all FeN4-like species, only D1 sites, assigned to FeN4/C, and D3 sites, assigned to N–FeN2+2/C, were active for the ORR.62–64

(b) The corresponding FT-EXAFS of FeTPP-300-C, FeTPP-800-C, and PANI-Fe-C as a function of applied potentials versus RHE. XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc), iron(III) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin chloride (FeTPPCl), and bulk iron (top) were included as Fe-based standards for comparison. The spectra of FeTPP-800-C and PANI-Fe-C were collected in the N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte; however, the spectra of FeTPP-300-C collected in the N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte are displayed here to fully capture the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox transition. The Fe–N/O (N and O cannot be distinguished by XAS as surrounding atoms) coordination numbers (c) and bond distances (d) of FeTPP-300-C, FeTPP-800-C, and PANI-Fe-C at 0.1 and 0.9 V were obtained by EXAFS fitting, and the derived Fe–N switching behavior is illustrated by using three structural models (Fe–N4–Cx) labeled D2, D1, and D3, respectively, with/without axially bound O(H)ads (e). The atom labeled X represented the fifth ligand with its identity unknown. Reproduced with permission.61 Copyright 2015, American Chemical Society. 
Co is another commonly used TM which can be incorporated into the TM–N–C structure for catalyzing the ORR 4e− pathway. Homogeneous and heterogeneous cobalt-based materials are widely used in various energy conversion applications due to their rich redox chemistry, low cost, high relative abundance and high stability under different conditions.65–67 Compared with other Co-based materials, Co-based SACs exhibit unique catalytic properties by virtue of their facile modular design, synthesis and the easily adjustable coordination environment of the active Co sites. Similar to Fe-based SACs, among all Co-based SACs, the most studied is the CoN4 configuration which has excellent ORR activity.68–70 For instance, Peng et al. obtained a Co catalyst with isolated single atomic sites anchored on hollow N-doped carbon spheres by a template-assisted pyrolysis method. The catalyst exhibited an excellent activity for the ORR with an E1/2 of 0.838 V in alkaline media because of the features of CoN4 sites and the hollow substrate.69 Apart from the traditional CoN4 structure, Wu et al. prepared new atomically dispersed CoN2+2 sites which were active and thermodynamically favorable for the 4e− ORR pathway.71 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the OOH dissociation reaction must overcome an activation energy of 0.69 eV on the CoN2+2 sites and 1.11 eV on the CoN4 sites, showing that CoN2+2 sites had greater potential to catalyze the 4e− pathway (Fig. 6a–c). Based on the pyrolysis process of predesigned bimetallic Zn/Co metal–organic frameworks, Li et al. prepared the CoN2+2 sites (800 °C) and CoN2 sites (900 °C) at the edge of the support.36 Both electrochemical tests and DFT calculations suggested that the CoN2 sites promoted the 4e− reduction process of the ORR because the CoN2 species showed a stronger interaction with peroxide than CoN4. Yao et al. systematically investigated the activity of Co–N4−xCx with a tunable coordination environment as the active sites for ORR catalysis (Fig. 6d–l).72 They proposed that carbon deficiency was the origin of the enhancement of ORR activity, and more defects can trap more N species, further anchoring more Co species to generate active CoN4 coordination configurations more efficiently. Their results demonstrated that the ORR reactivity increased in the order of CoN4 > CoN2C2-3 > CoN3C > CoC4 > CoN2C2-2 > CoN2C2-1 > CoN1C3. Although showing an acceptable catalytic performance, traditional Co–N–C SACs exhibit inferior ORR electrocatalytic activity, higher H2O2 selectivity and less stability compared to Fe–N–C SACs which need to be improved.71,73–77

In addition to Fe and Co, many other TMs are also used in the TM–N–C structure showing satisfactory catalytic performance. By performing pyrolysis and acid leaching of Mn-doped ZIF-8, Wu et al. first obtained a NC with low density of Mn.78 Then the low density NC was immersed in a solution containing Mn(II) chloride and nitrogen precursors followed by a thermal annealing at 1100 °C under a N2 atmosphere. A Mn SAC with a loading of 3.03 wt% and a MnN4 structure was finally obtained. The Mn–N–C catalyst exhibited an E1/2 approaching that of Fe–N–C catalysts (0.80 V), along with significantly enhanced stability in acidic media. The encouraging performance of the Mn–N–C catalyst as the cathode was demonstrated in fuel cell tests with an open circuit voltage of 0.95 V and power density of 0.46 W cm−2. First-principles calculations further supported that the MnN4 sites are the origin of the ORR activity via the 4e− pathway in acidic media. Via direct atom emission from bulk metals and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia, Li et al. successfully prepared a Cu–N–C SAC.79 Specifically, the ammonia first coordinated with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH3)x species during which the surface copper atoms were hauled out and then the Cu(NH3)x species were trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support to form isolated copper sites. Various characterization studies proved that Cu existed in the form of CuN4 and the oxidation state of Cu was identified to be between Cu0 and Cu2+. The resultant Cu SAC was endowed with superior ORR performance with an onset potential (Eonset) of 0.97 V and an E1/2 of 0.81 V in 0.1 M KOH as well as exceptional electrochemical and thermal stability. A similar coordination structure was reported by Xiang et al. where Cu atoms were anchored on the support in the form of CuN4.80 Baek and Yao et al. constructed an electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Cu atoms in which the active centers were composed of a mixture of CuN2 and CuN4 moieties.81,82 DTF calculations revealed that CuN2 had greater potential for the ORR than CuN4 and the Cu SAC exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity due to the favorable O2 and OOH adsorption energies on Cu active sites, and improved O–O bond stretching (Fig. 7a–c). Chen et al. reported a three dimensional nanoporous graphene (np-graphene) doped with both N and Ni single atoms/clusters.83 The resulting N and Ni co-doped np-graphene exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and OER in alkaline aqueous solutions. DFT calculations identified that the most energetically stable N,Ni co-doped configuration was the one in which the N and Ni dopants were in close proximity and formed one N–Ni bond, which was the NiN1C3 structure. This configuration was consistent with the characterization results, and the synergetic effects of this configuration facilitated the electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 7d–f). Anchoring a single Zn atom on the NC to catalyze the ORR is very interesting as the Zn atom has a fully filled 3d band rather than an unsaturated d orbital. Gu et al. reported for the first time a Zn SAC demonstrating high catalytic activity and remarkable durability for the ORR.84 Both experimental and theoretical calculations suggested that the atomically dispersed ZnN4 sites were the most active component and the rate-limiting step was O adsorption on the ZnN4 substrate with a low overpotential of 1.70 V. By simply adopting a very low annealing rate of 1° min−1, Wei et al. successfully prepared an ultrahigh-loading Zn SAC with a loading of up to 9.33 wt%.85 Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the ZnN4 catalyst exhibited not only a comparable ORR activity with the FeN4 catalyst, but also better durability in both acidic and alkaline media as well as being less susceptible to protonation than the Fe–N–C catalyst in the acidic medium.

Generally, only 3d transition metals have often been good choices for the metal elements in such M–N–C catalysts for the ORR and other non-3d transition metal-based catalysts usually afford much inferior ORR activities. However, Zhao et al. prepared a series of tungsten (W, 5d metal) SACs with different W–N coordination numbers.86 The W SACs showed coordination number-sensitive ORR catalytic ability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes instead of being considered to be almost inactive. The WN5 sites exhibited markedly high ORR catalytic activity which even surpassed and was nearly comparable to that of commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO4, respectively. In contrast, WN3 and WN4 exhibited relatively poor ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The DFT calculations suggested that the ORR activity can be attributed to the moderate interaction between OH– and the single W atoms, which was probably caused by the optimal dz2–pz orbital hybridization and redistribution of the charges.
In addition to sub-group elements, main group metals have also been introduced into the M–N–C structure to catalyze the ORR. Through theory calculations, Chen et al. first found that the Mg atom coordinated to two nitrogen atoms had the near-optimal adsorption strength with intermediate oxygen species due to the rise of the p-band center position compared to other coordination environments.87 Then they experimentally demonstrated an MgN2 SAC with a super high ORR activity surpassing that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte and being comparable to that under acidic conditions. This study turns an s/p-band metal into a highly active electrocatalyst and changes our common knowledge of catalytic properties of main group metal-based materials.
3.2 Modified M–N–C structure by non-nitrogen heteroatoms
The center metal atoms, whose electronic structure can be adjusted by surrounding atoms, are usually regarded as the actual ORR active sites. After unremitting exploration and research, the M–N–N configurations currently occupy the dominant position in the ORR field. In these catalysts, except the inherent differences caused by the types of metal atoms, the electronic structure of the catalytic site is mainly regulated by the coordinated N and C atoms. Different coordination numbers and different configurations make the electronic structure of central atoms varied, and thus show diverse catalytic activities. Actually, during the development of SACs, not only N has been applied to anchor and adjust the electronic structure of metal atoms but also the categories of heteroatoms have been expanded to S, P, B, O, Cl etc., which further improved the catalytic performance of SACs. These SACs can be divided into two types according to the coordination structure of the central atom: (1) heteroatoms directly coordinated to the center metal atoms; (2) heteroatoms indirectly bonded to the center metal atoms. Although the heteroatoms in the latter type are not directly bonded to the metal centers, heteroatom doping in carbon skeletons will modulate the electronic structure of M–N–C sites through long-range delocalization.

3.2.1 Heteroatoms directly coordinated to center metal atoms. 
Scherf et al. developed carbon nanosheets decorated by N and P dual-coordinated iron and confirmed FeN3P active sites using cutting edge techniques (Fig. 8c).88 As can be seen from Fig. 8a and b, the free energies of O2 molecules caught by FeN4 and FeN3P were −1.19 and −1.01 eV, respectively, which indicated that the O2 molecules can easily adsorb and strongly bond on FeN3P active sites. The last electron transfer step, the rate-determining step of the ORR, where *OH detached into OH-, was endothermic by 1.02 eV for FeN4, which was much higher than that for FeN3P (0.85 eV), suggesting that the FeN3P ORR catalytic activity was more efficient than that of FeN4. As N and P dual-coordinated iron sites were favorable for oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption, such new catalysts with rich FeN3P active sites displayed a superior ORR performance with an Eonset of 0.941 V and an E1/2 of 0.867 V in 0.1 M KOH, which outperformed those of the Pt/C benchmark (Fig. 8d). Zhu et al. innovatively synthesized porous S-doped Fe–N–C nanosheets using a scalable FeCl3-encapsulated-porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy.89 Diverse characterization technologies verified that the FeN3S active sites which exhibited ultrahigh ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.84 V and power density of 225.1 mW cm−2 in Zn–air batteries outperform the FeN4 active sites. Intensive investigation disclosed that S-doping could optimize charge and spin distribution of Fe–N–C materials to produce superior ORR activity. Mu et al. prepared B-doped Co–N–C active sites confined in hierarchical porous carbon sheets by the soft template self-assembly pyrolysis method.90 Significantly, the electron transfer around the Co–N–C sites can be activated by electron deficient sites caused by the introduced B element. As a result, the interaction between oxygenated species and Co active centers strengthened and thus accelerated the reaction kinetics in the 4e− processed ORR. The catalyst showed Pt-like ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.83 V and high durability than the Pt/C catalyst in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, as well as an open circuit potential of 1.4 V and a peak power density of 100.4 mW cm−2 in Zn–air batteries. Chen et al. constructed atomically dispersed O and N atom coordinated Mn active sites incorporated within graphene frameworks to emulate both the structure and function of Mn cofactors in the heme-copper oxidase superfamily.91 The energy level of the Mn d-electrons can be tuned to a reasonable state due to the coordination effect of electronic interaction between O, N, and Mn atoms in the catalysts. Particularly, in the MnN3O1 configuration, the downshifted position of the d-band center and adjacent position of the first peak relative to the Fermi level were beneficial for desorption and formation of intermediates, enabling the catalyst to exhibit superior performance for the ORR and zinc–air batteries under alkaline conditions, which was even better than that of commercial Pt/C. Notably, O coordination is not feasible for other non-precious metals which can lead to a significant 2e− pathway (the role of O coordination in the 2e− ORR pathway is described in detail later).

3.2.2 Heteroatoms indirectly bonded to center metal atoms. 
In addition to direct coordination with metal atoms, indirectly coordinated heteroatoms can also affect the catalytic activity of the metal site through long-range delocalization. Among various dopant atoms, S is undoubtedly the most universal. Since Sun et al. introduced S in the Fe–N–C SAC by using Fe(SCN)3 as the iron source to improve ORR activity, a series of studies related to S doping have been reported.35,92–98 For instance, Xie et al. achieved atomic dispersion of FeNx species on N and S co-decorated hierarchical carbon layers, resulting in the formation of a single-atom bifunctional OER/ORR catalyst under alkaline conditions and superior performance in rechargeable Zn–air batteries.92 The author ascribed the superior bifunctional activity to the N and S co-decoration effects and itinerant Fe 3d-electrons largely improved the electrical conductivity of the whole material system, and electron transfer was largely expedited during electrochemical OER and ORR processes. A novel pyrrole–thiophene copolymer pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Fe-isolated single atoms on S and N-codoped carbon with controllable S,N doping was rationally designed by Li et al. and these catalysts showed a volcano-type curve with the increase in sulfur doping.94 The optimized catalyst exhibited a more positive E1/2 value than Fe-isolated single atoms on NC, commercial Pt/C, and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. XAFS analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the incorporated S enriched the charge on N atoms surrounding the Fe reactive center and facilitated the rate-limiting reductive release of OH*, therefore improving the overall ORR efficiency. Li et al. proposed an atomic interface strategy to construct a single atom Cu catalyst whose ORR activity greatly surpassed that of the S-free Cu-based electrocatalyst in alkaline media.98 Further research found that the isolated Cu (+1)-N4-C8S2 atomic interface moiety served as an active site during the ORR process, and the synergistic mechanism between the Cu species and the carbon matrix at the atomic interface played a critical role in boosting the ORR efficiency, by adjusting the reaction free energy of intermediate adsorption. Amusingly, Wang et al. found an identical synthesis method that can result in distinguished structural differences between different metal centers because of the different trends of each metal ion in forming a complex with the N, S-containing precursor during the initial synthesis process.99 The S atoms in the Co SAC and Ni SAC formed metal-S bonds resulting in CoN3S1 and NiN3S1 central sites while the Fe SAC mainly consisted of well-dispersed FeN4S2 central sites which exhibited the highest ORR performance among all due to the highest charge density, and the lowest energy barriers of the intermediates and products involved.
The engineering of indirect coordination atoms is also employed to modify the charge distribution of the M–N–C configuration with other heteroatoms. Zeng et al. reported a B-doping strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of the MnN4 catalyst toward the ORR and OER.100 DFT calculation results showed that the MnN4B5 catalyst entailed both relatively high Eonset for the ORR and relatively low overpotential for the OER due to which the B dopant can lower the charge density corresponding to the d-orbital of the Mn atom, thereby weakening the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates (O/OH/OOH) on the active Mn site. Other research studies related to B doping can be found in the studies of Scherf, Yan and Huang et al.101–103
The electronic structure of the M–N–C active sites can also be synergistically optimized by introducing more than one heteroatom. Li et al. reported an atomically dispersed Fe–N–C catalyst by controlling the electronic structure of the central metal with coordinated S and Cl (FeCl1N4/CNS).104 The E1/2 of FeCl1N4/CNS far exceeded that of FeN4/CN and commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution. Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the near-range interaction with Cl and the long-range interaction with S of Fe modulated the electronic structure of the active sites, thus resulting in a great improvement of the ORR activity. A similar study was also executed by the same group in which the P, S co-doped Fe–N–C SAC exhibited a superior ORR performance than the SACs with no dopant or a single dopant due to the donation of electrons to the Fe centers from their surrounding S and P atoms.105

3.3 Noble metal-based SACs
As the O–O bonds are usually cleaved on noble metal ensemble sites, in other words the isolated single noble metal sites would not be able to dissociate the O–O bonds, noble metal-based SACs prefer to catalyze the 2e− pathway. However, by optimizing neighboring sites and coordination structures of active centers, some noble metal-based SACs catalyzing the 4e− pathway have also been reported.
Xu et al. reported a carbon-supported defect-anchored Pt SAC in which single Pt atoms anchored by four carbon atoms in carbon divacancies (Pt–C4 sites) were the main active sites for the observed highly efficient ORR process.106 An acidic H2/O2 single cell with this Pt SAC as the cathode delivered a maximum power density of 520 mW cm−2 at 80 °C, corresponding to a super-high platinum utilization of 0.09 gPt kW−1. By pyrolysis of urea, chloroplatinic acid and carbon black, Sun et al. prepared an efficient catalyst that contained single Pt atoms as the major component and also a few small Ptx clusters or NPs.107 The acidic single-cell with such a catalyst as the cathode delivered high performance with a power density of up to 680 mW cm−2 at 80 °C. The loading of platinum was as low as 0.09 mgPt cm−2, corresponding to a platinum utilization of 0.13 gPt kW−1 in the fuel cell. Wang et al. proposed a photochemical solid-phase reduction method to fabricate well-defined isolated Pt atoms on NC with a Pt loading of up to 3.8 wt%.44 The catalyst displayed an ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity for the HER and ORR, which is ascribed to the favorable chemical and electronic structure of the PtN4 coordination obtained by strong electron transfer from the isolated Pt atoms to the coordinated N atoms. Chen et al. developed an Ir–N–C SAC which mimicked homogeneous Ir porphyrins for high-efficiency ORR catalysis.108 The as-developed Ir SAC exhibited several orders of magnitude higher ORR activity than Ir NPs and commercial Pt/C, which is attributed to the moderate adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the mononuclear Ir ion coordinated with four N atom sites. Shui et al. compared a series of precious metal-based SACs and found that Ir1–N/C and Rh1–N/C exhibited much higher ORR activities than NP catalysts Ir/C and Rh/C, while the activities of Pd1–N/C and Pt1–N/C were considerably lower than those of Pd/C and Pt/C.109 DFT calculations revealed that the ORR activity of precious metal-based SACs depended on the match between the OH* adsorption on metal atoms and the electronegativity of coordinating anions, and the stronger the OH* adsorption, the higher the electronegativity needed for the coordinating anions. PEMFC tests confirmed the active-site coordination principle and showed the extremely high atomic efficiency of Ir1–N/C with a peak power density of 870 mW cm−2. Through NH3 atmosphere annealing of a graphene oxide (GO) precursor containing trace amounts of Ru, Tour et al. synthesized atomically dispersed Ru on NC that exhibited excellent 4e− ORR activity.110 The DFT study of the ORR mechanism suggested that a Ru-oxo-N4 structure appeared to be responsible for the ORR catalytic activity in an acidic medium. All these findings provide a way for the design of efficient noble metal-based ORR SACs.
3.4 Dual metal site SACs
Synergistic catalysis by dual metal sites has emerged as an efficient approach to modulate the electronic structure of catalytic sites for enhanced ORR performance. Dual metal site catalysts can be divided into two types according to whether the two metal atoms introduced form a bond.
The Fe–Co dual metal site SAC was obtained by pyrolysis of metalloporphyrinic MOFs with an adjustable molar ratio of FeII/CoII.38 The optimized Fe–Co dual metal sites exhibited better electrocatalytic performance for the ORR in both alkaline and acidic solutions than Pt/C and the corresponding monometallic catalysts due to the synergetic effect between highly dispersed FeNx and CoNx active sites. Li et al. developed a host–guest strategy to construct a novel electrocatalyst with Fe–Co dual sites embedded on NC.37 The synthesis process, in which a type of Zn/Co bimetallic MOF (BMOF) comprising similar sodalite coordination of Co2+ and Zn2+ nodes with 2-methylimidazole (ZIF-8 structure) was used as the host to encapsulate the FeCl3 molecules within the cavities, was mainly based on the precise control over the bonding between the Co nodes (host) and adsorbed Fe ions (guest) within the confined space of the MOF. AC HAADF-STEM, Mössbauer spectroscopy, XAFS and DFT analysis confirmed the existence of atomically dispersed dual Fe/Co sites, where the coordination numbers of Fe–N, Co–N and Fe–Co were about 3, 3 and 1 (Fig. 9a and b). The resultant dual metal site catalyst exhibited a superior ORR performance compared to commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M HClO4 solution and outperformed most of the reported Pt-free catalysts both in H2/O2 and H2/air fuel cell tests. The DFT calculations revealed that the dual sites were favored for the activation of O–O, which was crucial for the 4e− ORR process.

In addition to non-precious metals, precious metal atoms have also been used to prepare diatomic site catalysts. When using Pt as the counter electrode for electrochemical activation of the pre-prepared Co–NC, a carbon-based catalyst decorated by Co–Pt dual metal sites was synthesized by Yao et al.111 The resulting catalyst showed extremely high ORR activity with a mass activity as high as 267 times that of the commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution due to the specific coordination structure (Co–Pt)@N8V4, where N8 represented the number of nitrogen atoms and V4 indicated the number of vacant carbon atoms.
Except heteronuclear atoms, homonuclear atoms can also form diatomic sites to boost the ORR performance by precisely tuning the coordination environment. Through precisely tuning the number of Fe atoms in clusters anchored on NC, Xiong et al. reported an Fe–Fe diatomic site catalyst displaying excellent acidic ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.78 V and remarkable durability with only a −20 mV shift after 20000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.112 The excellent activity was mainly due to the capability of altering O2 adsorption from a superoxo-like to a peroxo-like configuration. Other similar dual metal site catalysts, such as Co–Ni and Fe–Ni, have also been reported for promoting ORR activity.113–117
It is worth noting that although the dual metal site SACs may have higher catalytic activity, this is mainly due to the elongated O–O bond as the co-coordination of bimetallic atoms with N benefits the first proton–electron pair attack in the following ORR process. In addition, compared to the superoxo-like O2 adsorption on single metal site SACs, a peroxo-like O2 adsorption may occur on the dual metal site SACs which facilitates O–O breakage. The origin of high activity cannot be simply attributed to the differences of the ORR reaction pathways or mechanisms, as these complex mechanisms and reaction pathways may occur on both single metal site SACs and dual metal site SACs. There is still a long way to go in defining the reaction pathway.
3.5 Synergistic catalysis between single atom sites and NPs
Synergistic catalysis between single atom sites and NPs can further improve the ORR activity of single metal sites. A catalyst consisting of Co–Nx–Cy sites and Pt3Co/Pt core/shell NPs was reported by Liu et al.118 During thermal activation of a Co-ZIF, a fraction of Co2+ was reduced to metallic nanocrystallites, whereas other Co ions were converted to atomically dispersed Co–Nx–Cy sites situated nearby. The Co nanocrystallites could serve as the seeds to amalgamate with subsequently added Pt to form alloy NPs with a core–shell structure. The resulting catalyst exhibited an excellent ORR catalytic performance with an E1/2 of 0.96 V, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. Excellent membrane electrode assembly performances by the catalyst were also observed both in H2–O2 and H2–air cells. DFT calculation results indicated the synergistic catalysis in which the Pt–Co alloy facilitated reduction of H2O2 generated from nearby Co–Nx–Cy sites led to nearly 4e− transfer and then improved catalyst activity. By embedding atomic clusters in an atomically dispersed Fe–N–C matrix, Zeng et al. fabricated an ORR electrocatalyst with an E1/2 of 0.912 V, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C (0.897 V), Fe SAC (0.844 V), and the E1/2 of most reported non-platinum-group metal catalysts (Fig. 9c–f).119 Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations confirmed that the ORR activity of the designed catalyst stemmed from single-atom active centers but was markedly enhanced by the presence of Fe nanoclusters. Other similar strategies for further improving ORR activity can be found in ref. 120–124.
3.6 Other strategies for improving catalytic activity
In addition to the types of chemical elements, some other strategies have been applied to further improve the catalytic activity. Significantly, catalysts even having the same coordination number may show varied catalytic behavior due to the morphological differences and the differences in the number of surrounding carbon atoms. Xu et al. engineered morphologies of catalysts to facilitate mass transport through catalyst layers, thus increasing the utilization of each active site.125 An overhang–eave structure decorated with FeN4 sites exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ORR in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes while showed remarkable performance in Zn–air batteries as air electrode catalysts, achieving a high capacity of 807.5 mA h gZn−1, an ultrahigh peak power density of 186.8 mW cm−2 and a spectacular energy density (962.7 W h kgZn−1). Such excellent electrocatalytic performances are closely related to the overhang–eave morphology, exhibiting an edge-rich structure with more three-phase boundaries for fast accessibility for mass transport of reactants to catalytically active Fe sites, achieving ultrahigh utilization of each active metal site. Wang et al. observed in both theoretical and corresponding experimental verification that FeN4C8 had the highest intrinsic catalytic activity for the ORR, then FeN4C10, and finally FeN4C12.61,63,64 Notably, not all Fe–Nx moieties can be regarded as active sites due to their location within the catalyst.126 Lopes et al. found that the utilization of Fe–Nx moieties compared with the total iron content was only 4.5%.127 Generally, Fe–Nx moieties near the external surface of the catalysts are better able to participate in the ORR, whereas those buried in the carbon support stay inactive.128,129 From this perspective, the author believes that increasing the specific surface area of the support seems to be an effective way to expose more active sites.
4 Carbon-based SACs for the ORR with the 2e− pathway
H2O2 is widely used in many fields due to its unique oxidizability and non-toxicity, and the industrial demand for H2O2 increases rapidly every year. Currently, the industrial production of H2O2 is heavily dependent on the AO process, which has high energy consumption, high cost and waste accumulation.130 H2O2 production via the 2e− oxygen electroreduction pathway offers an attractive route for on-site production of H2O2 under ambient conditions. Unfortunately, previous studies on ORR electrocatalysts, particularly M–N–C catalysts, mainly focus on the 4e− pathway for H2O production for fuel cell applications, whereas the 2e− pathway for H2O2 production which is usually regarded as an adverse reaction is rarely studied in detail. Similar to SACs for the 4e− pathway, the most studied SACs for the 2e− pathway are also carbon-based SACs due to their unique surface and structural properties. This chapter briefly summarizes some SACs used in the 2e− ORR pathway and the influencing factors for H2O2 production.
4.1 TM-based SACs with O coordination
Unlike the 4e− pathway catalysts, an ideal 2e− pathway catalyst for H2O2 synthesis should minimize the kinetic barriers to provide high activity while maximizing the barrier for *OOH dissociation or reduction to *O and *OH (the intermediates of the 4e− pathway for H2O production) and then to H2O to achieve high selectivity. As shown in Fig. 10a and b, Liu et al. systematically studied the relation between a series of TM SACs anchored on NC and the catalytic performance of H2O2 synthesis via the ORR.131 Markedly, the Co SAC with an optimal binding energy of 3.54 eV is positioned nearly at the vertex of the activity-volcano map, suggesting that the Co SAC would be highly active for the 2e− pathway. This also explains from a theoretical level why the current TM-based SACs used for the 2e− pathway are mostly focused on Co–N–C structures. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the introduction of suitable heteroatoms into TM-based SACs can enhance the ORR performance of fuel cells with reduced overpotentials and inhibited 2e− pathway. However, if the introduced heteroatoms are O atoms, the catalytic pathway will change significantly. Similar to traditional carbon materials, the oxygen functional groups such as C–O–C and CO play a vital role in an ideal selective SAC for H2O2 synthesis where one can adjust ΔGHOO* by attaching functional groups near the M–N–C moiety to infinitely close to the optimal value for H2O2 production.

Guided by first-principles calculations, Hyeon et al. found that the catalytic properties of the Co–N4 moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes.132 Using this principle, they then designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprised an optimized Co–N4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for the 2e− ORR pathway with a selectivity to H2O2 as high as 82%. The study found that the reason for the high H2O2 selectivity was that the modified electronic structure of the Co–N4 sites by nearby C–O–C epoxides was unable to break the O–O bond. As shown in Fig. 11a, nanocarbon modified by oxygen functional groups prominently promotes the selectivity for the 2e− ORR pathway to generate H2O2 while oxygen functional groups exhibit limited capability to improve the kinetics for the ORR with high overpotential.133 Concurrently, Co–Nx–C sites lack the selectivity for H2O2 generation so oxygen feedstocks are usually reduced to water through the 4e− pathway instead of desired H2O2. The combination of atomic Co–Nx–C sites and oxygen functional groups affords a feasible strategy to endow noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with high reactivity and high selectivity for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Atomic Co–Nx–C sites serve as active sites for oxygen reduction and oxygen functional groups promote the selectivity of the 2e− pathway. Accordingly, a synergistic strategy was proposed by Zhang et al. for the preparation of H2O2 electrocatalysts composed of Co–Nx–C sites and oxygen functional groups. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis in O2-saturated 0.10 M KOH with a high selectivity of over 80% and very high ORR reactivity with a potential at 1 mA cm−2 of 0.79 V (Fig. 11b and c). Further mechanism study identified that the Co–Nx–C sites and oxygen functional groups contributed to the reactivity and selectivity for H2O2 electrogeneration, respectively. Recently, Lu et al. developed a highly active and selective oxygen reduction process for H2O2 production by modulating the oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed cobalt sites with suitable electrochemical/chemical treatments, showing a negligible amount of onset overpotential and nearly 100% selectivity within a wide range of applied potentials.134

Currently, although SACs related to Co atoms exhibit the highest activity and selectivity for H2O2 production during the ORR, there are also some other TM-related SACs that show great promise. Bian et al. reported a graphene-supported Ni SAC which was synthesized by a simple surfactant-free reduction process.135 This catalyst exhibited enhanced H2O2 selectivity (>94%) with a considerable mass activity (2.11 A mgNi−1 at 0.60 V), owing to the presence of oxygen functional groups and isolated Ni sites. Qiao et al. reported a new kind of Mo SAC with a unique O, S coordination for a highly selective 2e− ORR to produce H2O2.136 Combining electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations, the Mo single-atom site was identified as the activity origin of the highly selective 2e− ORR pathway, and the specific local coordination (such as Mo–S4–C and Mo–O3S–C) was revealed to influence the adsorption behavior and reaction pathway significantly, resulting in high activity and selectivity.
Wang et al. synthesized a series of SACs by anchoring different transition metal atoms on carbon nanotubes (CNTs).137 As shown in Fig. 11d and e, HAADF-STEM and Fourier transformed extended XAFS spectra showed that all four types of TM-CNT samples, including Fe, Pd, Co, and Mn, have similar structures which indicated that only M–C or M–O bonds were present in the four catalysts. However, their selectivities to H2O2 were very different. As can be seen from Fig. 11f and g, the Fe SAC presented the best H2O2 generation with a maximal H2O2 selectivity of more than 95% and a high potential of 0.822 V to deliver a 0.1 mA cm−2 H2O2 onset current. By switching the metal dopants from Fe to Pd, Co, and Mn, the H2O2 selectivity changed to 90.3, 74.8, and 39.8%, respectively, suggesting a wide range tuning of electron transfer numbers from 2.09 to 3.20. DFT calculations indicated that the Fe–C–O motifs, in a sharp contrast to the well-known Fe–C–N for the 4e−pathway, were responsible for the H2O2 pathway. Similar structures and conclusions were also proposed by Liu and Bian et al.131,138
4.2 Noble metal-based SACs
Unlike conventional noble metal nanoparticles or alloy catalysts, the well-dispersed noble metal sites lack adjacent noble metal atoms, which tend to result in a 2e− pathway for the ORR. Bian et al. discussed the effects of particle size on the ORR pathway through comparison of H2O2 selectivities of different graphene-supported Pt species (nanoparticles, clusters, and single-atoms).139 Study found that H2O2 selectivity was inversely proportional to particle size so isolated Pt sites will follow a 2e− pathway to generate H2O2 (95% selectivity) due to the absence of adjacent sites for O–O breakage, while graphene-supported Pt nanoparticles preferred to favor a complete reduction to form H2O. The Pt species size has been found to affect the ORR pathway because changes in the morphology and crystal structure of the Pt species significantly affected the capacity to break O–O bonds. Lee et al. immobilized Pt or Pd atoms on thin layers of graphitic carbon nitride with carbon black to produce a Pt SAC or Pd SAC.140 The lack of ensemble sites in these SACs resulted in the 2e− pathway for the ORR. Particularly, the Pd SAC showed a very high activity (8.5 A mgPd−1 at 0.2 V) and high selectivity of up to 94% for H2O2 production. DFT calculations showed that single atomic Pd on the support had weaker binding energy of O2 than single atomic Pt, resulting in enhanced activity. The atomically dispersed Pt catalyst with the PtS4 configuration was synthesized via a simple wet-impregnation method on zeolite-templated carbon containing an extra-large amount of S (up to 17 wt%) by Choi et al.141 In the ORR in an acidic environment, the catalyst did not follow the typical 4e− pathway producing H2O, but predominantly produced H2O2via the 2e− pathway (96% selectivity) without promoting consecutive H2O2 decomposition reactions. Through the “trapping-and immobilizing” method, five atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts (Os, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Pt) were obtained by Joo et al.142 The atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts generally showed higher selectivity for H2O2 production and lower ORR activities than their NP counterparts, which is attributed to their weak O binding energies and their unique geometric arrangements. Among the atomically dispersed catalysts, the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst showed the highest H2O2 selectivity and the atomically dispersed Rh catalyst showed the best activity in terms of 2e− ORR activity. Combining the experimental results and DFT calculations, it was found that the selectivity trend of atomically dispersed catalysts could be correlated with the binding energy difference between the *OOH and *O species. The oxidation state of the central metal atom also played a crucial role in the selectivity to H2O2. Lee prepared a series of TiC supported Pt ASCs with different Pt oxidation states by changing reduction temperatures.143 The Pt/TiC reduced at 300 °C had Pt single atoms with a more reduced Pt(II) state, unlike the Pt/TiC reduced at low or high temperatures, which resulted in the weak adsorption of the OOH* species and high activity for H2O2 formation. Although TiC is not a carbon support, this work has certain enlightening significance for the design of carbon-based SACs for the 2e− ORR pathway in the future.
5 Summary and outlook
As emerging electrocatalysts with high performance in the past few years, SACs have exhibited great potential for next-generation clean energy systems, particularly carbon-based SACs for the ORR have attracted intensive attention. In this review, all the important synthetic strategies related to carbon-based SACs for the ORR have been included and discussed in detail, including the wet chemistry strategy, spatial confinement strategy, template-assisted pyrolysis strategy, photochemical reduction strategy and other intelligently designed synthesis strategies. Since the single central metal atom has reached the limits of adjustment in terms of composition, shape, and size, the unique electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the active center, in fact, originate from the corresponding coordination environment. Then, SACs with different metal centers and configurations for the 4e− ORR pathway have been introduced. Finally, the key roles of O coordination in TM-based SACs for the 2e− ORR pathway and noble metal-based SACs for H2O2 production via the ORR have been highlighted. Despite the initial success, many challenges remain in the field of SACs for the electrochemical ORR.
(i) A mild and uncomplicated method is highly desired. Although the preparation of SACs has been extensively explored, the involved methods inevitably undergo high-temperature pyrolysis which promotes the agglomeration of metal atoms. Most of the existing methods for preparing SACs are complicated and SACs cannot be produced on a large scale, which limits the industrialization of SACs.
(ii) Advanced characterization techniques are not available. Currently, most characterization methods are performed under ex situ conditions, which may not reflect the real information during the reaction. In situ characterization techniques which are unavailable to most research groups are beneficial to investigate the real structure–activity relationship, thus paving the way for rational design of high-performance SACs. Noteworthily, the application of XAFS characterization technology can only provide average information about the local atomic structure and electronic properties of the target metal atom. It is necessary to develop new advanced characterization technologies to understand the accurate information of each site.
(iii) The metal loading of SACs is generally low. As is known, the catalytic performance is directly proportional to the number of real active sites on the surface of the support; however, increasing the number of active sites can easily lead to agglomeration. Increasing the metal loading while overcoming this seemingly contradictory problem is a major difficulty.
(iv) The activity and stability of SACs used in acid media need to be further improved. Although SACs exhibit Pt-like or even better activity than Pt toward the ORR in an alkaline medium, the performance in an acidic medium is not satisfactory and there is still a long way to go for real commercial production.
(v) Insufficient research on the production of H2O2 through the ORR. The insufficiency mainly includes two aspects: (a) most of the catalysts catalyze the 4e− pathway, and catalysts for the 2e− pathway are relatively scarce. (b) Due to the different testing methodologies such as RRDE tests or H-cell tests, H2O2 selectivity comparison currently in the field has not been standardized. To avoid any confusion in the future and to make literature comparison easy, Wang et al. recommended that it would be more meaningful to directly report faradaic efficiency as H2O2 selectivity, instead of the molar fraction, no matter what experimental setup is used. But the academic circle has not yet reached a unified conclusion.
(vi) Limited support material. Due to the unique structure and conductivity, the carbonaceous material is most probably the only support of SACs for the ORR. Therefore, more efforts should be devoted to finding new, more conductive and robust support materials. For example, Sun et al. immobilized Cu single atoms on Ti2CO2 which exhibited excellent ORR activity with much lower overpotential (0.25 V) than that of Pt/C (0.4 V), high selectivity for 4e− oxygen reduction, excellent stability and acid-resistance, and are quite promising ORR catalysts for PEMFCs.144

 	Fig. 5  (a) XANES at the Fe K-edge with concomitant first derivatives (insets). (b) The corresponding FT-EXAFS of FeTPP-300-C, FeTPP-800-C, and PANI-Fe-C as a function of applied potentials versus RHE. XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc), iron(III) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin chloride (FeTPPCl), and bulk iron (top) were included as Fe-based standards for comparison. The spectra of FeTPP-800-C and PANI-Fe-C were collected in the N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte; however, the spectra of FeTPP-300-C collected in the N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte are displayed here to fully capture the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox transition. The Fe–N/O (N and O cannot be distinguished by XAS as surrounding atoms) coordination numbers (c) and bond distances (d) of FeTPP-300-C, FeTPP-800-C, and PANI-Fe-C at 0.1 and 0.9 V were obtained by EXAFS fitting, and the derived Fe–N switching behavior is illustrated by using three structural models (Fe–N4–Cx) labeled D2, D1, and D3, respectively, with/without axially bound O(H)ads (e). The atom labeled X represented the fifth ligand with its identity unknown. Reproduced with permission.61 Copyright 2015, American Chemical Society.
