    , Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 3rd October 2016AbstractThe combination of advanced materials and defined surface design with complex proteins from natural photosynthesis is currently one of the major topics in the development of biohybrid systems and biophotovoltaic devices. In this study transparent mesoporous indium tin oxide (μITO) electrodes have been used in combination with the trimeric supercomplex photosystem I (PSI) from Thermosynechococcus elongatus and the small redox protein cytochrome c (cyt c) from horse heart to fabricate advanced and efficient photobiocathodes. The preparation of the μITO via spin coating allows easy scalability and ensures a defined increase in the electrochemically active surface area with accessibility for both proteins. Using these 3D electrodes up to 40 μm thickness, the immobilization of cyt c and PSI with full monolayer coverage and their electrical communication to the electrode can be achieved. Significant improvement can be made when the heterogenous electron transfer rate constant of cyt c with the electrode is increased by an appropriate surface treatment. The photocurrent follows linearly the thickness of the μITO and current densities of up to 150 μA cm−2 can be obtained without indications of a limitation. The internal quantum efficiency is determined to be 39% which demonstrates that the wiring of PSI via cyt c can be advantageously used in a system with high protein loading and efficient electron pathways inside 3D transparent conducting oxides.
Introduction
The construction and development of photobiohybrid electrodes incorporating key components of natural photosynthesis – mainly solar-to-charge carrier converting complexes – have been strongly emerging over the past few years.1,2 These biohybrid electrodes are suitable for potential future applications such as photo-switchable biosensors, and solar-to-chemical3 or solar-to-electrical energy converting systems and establish the basis for a biobased renewable economy.4–9
Learning from nature, light-to-charge carrier converting proteins from oxygenic photosynthesis of plants and cyanobacteria are of high interest for the construction of new functional devices.10 One of the most promising light-converting complexes is photosystem I (PSI), because of a very high quantum efficiency (∼100%), fast and stable charge separation, and an appropriate spectral overlap with the sun.10,11 In the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (T. elongatus) PSI is a trimeric pigment-protein super-complex, consisting of 12 different protein subunits, harboring 96 chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 22 carotenoids – per monomeric subunit. Most Chls serve as light-harvesting antenna pigments and 6 Chls form an electron transport chain.12 In PSI charge separation occurs at the luminal pigment dimer, Chl a/Chl a′ (P700), finally leading to a reduction of the stromally located terminal iron–sulfur-cluster (FB).13,14 Light-induced electron–hole pairs are restocked via cytochrome c6 (cyt c6), which reduces P700, whereas the oxidation of PSI takes place at the FB cluster, which is done by the redox protein ferredoxin (Fdx).15
The effective electrical wiring of PSI to various electrode structures and materials is of fundamental importance for functional photobiohybrid devices generating higher photocurrent densities.16 A vast number of strategies have been published applying different surface designs and chemistry.17–24 A strong improvement in electrode performance can be seen if electrical signal chains with electron shuttling systems or conducting junctions have been used.25–29
In order to overcome the limitations of 2D arrangements and to generate higher photocurrents per geometrical electrode area, various strategies have been explored, which can be divided mainly into three groups: multilayer architectures,30–35 3D polymer gels36–41 and 3D electrode surfaces.42–44 Particularly in the latter group application potential can be seen since limitations of electron transport in PSI multilayer architectures due to long electron transfer pathways can be circumvented. Light induced charge carriers can be injected directly into a high conductive material without being restricted to a planar surface dimension. Hence, photoactive PSI-containing 3D electrodes have been developed – often using semiconductor materials, such as ZnO/TiO2 nanowires45 or nanostructured TiO2 columns.46
In addition, porous structures such as silica nanopores show the possibility of PSI integration, but lack electrical connection to an electrode.47 Moreover, other light-harvesting components like the bacterial reaction center, light harvesting complex 1 (RC-LH1), could be connected to mesoporous silver electrodes.48
In this study, we exploit the features of a mesoporous indium tin oxide (μITO) electrode. Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) provide the advantage of high transparency with reasonable conductance. So far, understanding the direct electrochemistry of large proteins with TCOs is often rather difficult. Different reasons can be given for this such as inappropriate surface groups, low intrinsic charge carrier density and low electron tunneling rates. However by surface modification efficient functional systems with enzymes have been demonstrated.49–51 In addition photosystem II (PSII) has been functionally attached to such surfaces.52,53
Here, we use cytochrome c (cyt c) as a wiring agent for PSI molecules, which has been previously investigated in mono- and multilayer architectures by us.29,31 The small redox protein cyt c is oxidized by the photo-excited PSI and subsequently reduced at the electrode. Furthermore, cyt c adsorbs and exhibits reasonable heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (ks) on planar,54,55 meso-56,57 and nanostructured58 ITO. As an obvious consequence, we combine the cyt c–PSI system with a mesoporous indium tin oxide electrode (μITO) to construct a tunable photobiocathode. We characterize the (photo-) electrochemical properties in terms of efficiency as well as scalability and demonstrate ways to improve the light-to-current conversion performance.
Results and discussion
In this study we exploit the transparency and conductivity of ITO with the possibility of 3D structure preparation and combine it with PSI and cyt c to develop a functional photocathode system.
In Scheme 1 electrode design and electron transfer pathways are displayed. To produce a μITO electrode, a mixture of ITO nanoparticles (ITONP) and latex beads (LBs) has been spin coated onto an ITO slide in various deposition steps (see the Experimental section). The sintering process at high temperatures is performed only once after the layers have been deposited on the surface. This forms an inverse opal mesoporous structure, because of the thermal decomposition of LBs. The generated hollow structure is then first incubated with PSI, followed by incubation with cyt c, yielding a greenish-coloured electrode (see the Experimental methods). After light exposure a cathodic photocurrent is obtained verifying that electrons are transported from the planar ITO electrode towards the deposited porous ITO structure, reducing the bound cyt c and also the assembled PSI. At the stromal side of PSI, electrons can be finally transferred to an acceptor in solution (here oxygen, see Scheme 1). The signal chain is switched on and off by the light excitation of PSI.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of a μITO electrode with integrated photosystem I (PSI) and cytochrome c (cyt c). The μITO structure displays an inverse opal mesoporous structure with nanoparticle surface roughness. Cyt c binds to the surface and allows the electrical connection of PSI to the μITO electrode surface. After light excitation, electrons flow from the base ITO electrode in the μITO structure consisting of sintered ITO nanoparticles (ITO NPs) further to cyt c, which subsequently reduces PSI. The photo-excited electron within PSI can be transferred to molecular oxygen. The light blue arrows display intrinsic electron transfer in ITO, the dark blue arrow indicates the heterogeneous electron transfer, the yellow arrows show the protein–protein electron transfer and the red arrows display the PSI intramolecular electron transfer cascade. 
First of all, the prepared μITO electrodes have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) to verify the successful and reproducible construction of these basic electrodes. SEM measurements show a regular structure with circle shaped holes comprising interconnections to the next layer of removed latex particles (Fig. 1). Highly uniform holes with a diameter of 640 ± 10 nm (n = 20) are observed. In comparison with the used LB diameter (∼800 nm) in the deposition mixture, the produced holes are shrunken by about 160 nm in diameter during the baking step. Interconnections are of different sizes and range from 200 to 400 nm. This may ensure access to deeper layers of the μITO even for large proteins like PSI. The μITO electrodes can be prepared with various numbers of spin coating steps allowing a defined adjustment of the thickness of the electrode structure. The individual preparation steps can also be seen in Fig. 1. The average layer thickness for one spin coating step is 5.2 ± 0.4 μm. The increase in the electroactive surface area can be verified by CV measurements. Since the double layer capacity scales with the electrode area in electrolyte contact, the electroactive area is calculated from the charging current of flat ITO and the different μITOs (for procedure details see the ESI,† Section A). This results in a linear function with the number of layers (R2 = 0.999) with a slope of 5.5 ± 0.01 cm2 per layer. The results taken from CV and SEM measurements indicate that the surface area and height of μITO electrodes can be directly controlled via the number of deposited layers. Here, no saturation behaviour has been observed. Moreover, structural properties like hole diameters, interconnections and uniformity are highly conserved within all produced electrodes.

Photoelectrochemical properties of μITO–PSI–cyt c electrodes
In this section the focus is on the construction of a photobiohybrid system using the above described μITO electrodes. Here different strategies for combining PSI and cyt c with the 3D electrode have been studied. The current behaviour of these electrodes after illumination has been used as the success criterion. Besides the approaches of solution incubation and drop casting, the order of protein contacts and protein concentration have been varied.
The highest photocurrent density can be achieved, when the following preparation procedure is used: first, a highly concentrated PSI solution (>20 μM) is drop-cast and the electrode is incubated for several minutes, and then the electrode is washed with phosphate buffer. Second, a 1 mM cyt c solution is drop-cast afterwards and incubated for several minutes, followed by washing with phosphate buffer prior to any photoelectrochemical measurement (see Experimental section). After the incubation steps the greenish colour of the electrode already indicates the binding of PSI to the μITO surface. The second incubation step with cyt c ensures the binding of the redox protein to PSI and the μITO surface, which results in the connection of PSI with the electrode. To clarify the electron transfer mechanism of such a μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode, CV experiments have been performed. They reveal the direct electrochemistry of cyt c incorporated into the μITO electrode (see Fig. S1†), which is in accordance with results obtained at other porous ITO electrodes.56 Clear oxidation/reduction peaks are visible with a peak-to-peak separation of 80 mV and a full peak width at half maximum of 93 mV indicating a quasi-reversible heterogeneous electron transfer of the redox protein with the electrode.59 It has to be noted here that the electrochemistry of cyt c is not disturbed by the presence of PSI in the 3D electrode structure (see Fig. S1†). Under illumination a distinct solely cathodic catalytic current is detected starting at around 70 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (see Fig. S2†). This indicates that cyt c is reduced by the electrode to further inject electrons into PSI, as previously proven by us at modified gold.29,31 The open circuit potential of this electrode is in the range of −50 to −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl.

Fig. 2 displays the photocurrent density of a μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode under constant illumination at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. A peak cathodic photocurrent density of 103 ± 8 μA cm−2 as well as a steady-state photocurrent of 35 ± 2 μA cm−2 (n = 4) is measured. The fast decay in photocurrent over time can be attributed to the diffusion limitation of the final electron acceptor (oxygen). When diffusion has been accelerated by constant stirring, the decay can be drastically reduced and a rather stable photocurrent output is obtained. The small drop observed even under stirring can be attributed to the transport limitation of oxygen within the 3D μITO structure, which cannot be influenced by external stirring. During the photo-excitation process dissolved oxygen is consumed by PSI, and thus has to diffuse from the bulk of the solution to the surface-fixed proteins. Due to the mesoporous nature of the electrode, the diffusion of reactants is slowed down, consequently becoming a rate limiting step. At this point it should be added that the photocurrent can be further enhanced when the electron transfer from the FB cluster is enhanced by addition of methyl viologen (by 45%).
 Fig. 2  Photocurrent response of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode. Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light (20 mW cm−2, 3 min) at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with constant stirring (dotted) or without (solid). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2. 
The incorporation of cyt c into this assembly is essential for the functioning of the photocathode, since without cyt c only minor photocurrents of about 1 μA cm−2 are detected (with PSI alone, Fig. S3†). This means that only a few PSI molecules can directly exchange electrons with the electrode. Furthermore the μITO and the μITO–cyt c electrode do not show any detectable photocurrent, indicating the necessity of the presence of the photoactive enzyme (see Fig. S3†).
Operation of the photobiohybrid cathode is based on the strong interaction of cyt c with the ITO surface on the one hand and with PSI on the other. This view is supported by experiments on such an electrode in a buffer of higher ionic concentration (100 mM). Here much smaller photocurrents have been found (reduction of about 70%) which can be attributed to the lowering of interaction forces between the essential components of the system and the electrostatic nature of this interaction (see Fig. S4†).
For a better understanding of the limitations within such a complex structure, two different preparation procedures for the μITO electrode have been investigated. The μITO electrodes have been sintered either under standard air conditions (Pair) or under an argon atmosphere (Pargon). This strategy has been chosen, since oxygen vacancies in ITO are supposed to improve conductivity and electron mobility.60
In Fig. 3 a comparison of different electrodes prepared according to both procedures (Pair and Pargon) is displayed. Here the photocurrent densities of μITO–PSI–cyt c electrodes are plotted against the number of μITO layers used during electrode preparation. From 2 to 8 layers a linear increase in the photocurrent output is achieved. The procedure under argon (Pargon) results in the highest overall photocurrents. They increase linearly with a slope of 17.5 ± 0.4 μA per cm2 per layer (R2 = 0.992, n = 4). Sintering under air atmosphere (Pair) also gives defined photocurrents, but with a significantly lower current output (7.7 ± 0.2 μA per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.989). A comparison between Pargon and Pair in terms of electroactive surface area (for a given number of μITO layers) reveals no significant difference (see Fig. S5†). Furthermore the protein concentration in the structure, either cyt c or PSI, is very similar (in the limits of error, see the discussion below), and thus cannot be the reason for the drastic change in the photocurrent magnitude. Therefore, we focus on the heterogeneous electron transfer rate (ks) of cyt c to the μITO electrode being possibly the reason for a higher current density of the photobiohybrid system when prepared under an argon atmosphere. By using the method of Laviron61 a ks of 1.1 ± 0.1 s−1 for Pargon and 0.54 ± 0.03 s−1 for Pair can be derived (see Fig. S6†). The values compare well with other findings on porous TCO materials. Oxygen vacancies, conductivity, surface roughness, and protein orientation have been elucidated as key factors for the heterogeneous electron transfer rate between cyt c and the TCO material.56,58,62 Thermal treatment of ITO under air leads to a higher concentration of oxygen in the material, thus lowering the carrier density. This seems to be the reason for the higher ks using Pargon, since all other parameters (e.g. sintering temperature and time) have been kept constant. When all the other electron transfer steps (cyt c–cyt c, cyt c–PSI, and PSI–oxygen) are faster than the heterogeneous electron transfer of cyt c on ITO, the overall current flow through the system is limited not only by acceptor diffusion but also by the rate of cyt c reduction. These experiments show that analysing limiting steps in complex systems can help to improve the performance. As a consequence, in the following experiments we use sintering under argon for the μITO preparation.
 Fig. 3  Photocurrent density dependence on the number of applied μITO layers of a μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode and different sintering procedures (Pair = sintering under air = circles, Pargon = sintering under argon = squares). A linear relationship between photocurrent and the number of layers can be found (Pargon: 17.5 ± 0.4 μA per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.992; Pair: 7.7 ± 0.2 μA per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.989). Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light (20 mW cm−2) at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (n = 4). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2. 
In the next set of experiments, the focus is on the protein amount that can be integrated into the μITO structure for different layers. The concentration of cyt c has been analysed via CV by evaluating the charge of the redox reaction, whereas the PSI concentration can be determined by UV/Vis absorption measurements evaluating the chlorophyll concentration extracted from the electrode (see the Experimental section). Fig. 4 displays the determined protein concentrations related to the geometrical surface. Here, a linear relationship of both the cyt c and PSI concentration with the number of μITO layers deposited during the preparation of the base electrode is found. An increase in concentration related to the geometrical area of 4.5 ± 0.2 pmol per cm2 per layer (R2 = 0.997, n = 5) can be detected for PSI, whereas the value for cyt c is 0.46 ± 0.01 nmol per cm2 per layer (R2 = 0.998, n = 5).
 Fig. 4  Protein concentration (top) and turnover number (bottom) dependence on the number of μITO layers. A linear relationship between the protein amount and the number of layers can be found (PSI: 4.5 ± 0.2 pmol per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.997; cyt c: 0.46 ± 0.01 nmol per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.998; n = 4). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2. 
Related to the electroactive surface area (see Fig. 1) a surface coverage of 0.2 ± 0.01 pmol cm−2 for PSI is calculated, which is close to an entire monolayer coverage. The same is observed for cyt c, which assembles also in a monolayer coverage of 15.5 ± 0.4 pmol cm−2. These values indicate that both proteins can penetrate the whole 3D structure and we can make use of the full electroactive surface of the electrode.
In order to describe the electron transfer efficiency per molecule, the turnover number (Te) has been calculated. Te is the number of electrons, which are processed by each individual protein per second. The result of this analysis is shown in Fig. 4. At a minimum of 4× μITO layers Te for both proteins become constant at a value of 0.42 ± 0.01 e− cyt c−1 s−1 and 35 ± 3 e− PSI−1 s−1. The Te for μITO–PSI–cyt c with respect to PSI is two orders of magnitude higher than that without cyt c (μITO–PSI, 0.3 ± 0.1 e− PSI−1 s−1). This clearly explains the strong effect on performance, when cyt c is added to the system. A comparison of the Te value of cyt c to the determined ks shows that not all of the cyt c molecules contribute to the reduction of PSI, but are connected to the electrode.
Photophysical features of μITO–PSI–cyt c electrodes
In this section, we characterize the photo-physical features of the μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode demonstrating its potential as an efficient, biohybrid and transparent photocathode.
In Fig. 5 the photocurrent density of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode is plotted against the incident light power. The Michaelis–Menten equation can be applied to fit the experimental data, since photons can be considered as a substrate for PSI. The light intensity at the half maximum (KM) is determined to be 2.6 ± 0.2 mW cm−2 with a maximum photocurrent (Jmax) of 148 ± 2 μA cm−2. The cooperativity (n) of this behaviour is calculated to be 1.0 ± 0.1. This means that PSI excitation by photons can be seen as multiple parallel single events, taking place independently. The KM value derived from these experiments is very similar to our findings of a cyt c/PSI monolayer system29 and more than a factor of 2 higher than in a multilayer setup31 on planar gold electrodes. The nature of light absorption here seems to be more similar to that of a monolayer system as compared to that of a complex multilayer environment with additional assembled components. In addition, this behaviour also corresponds to the determined monolayer coverage of the proteins within the 3D structure.
 Fig. 5  Relationship of photocurrent density of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode with illumination intensity. Data have been fitted with the Michaelis–Menten equation (KM = 2.6 ± 0.2 mW cm−2, Jmax = 148 ± 2 μA cm−2, n = 1.0 ± 0.1, and R2 = 0.998). Inset: Lineweaver–Burk plot of the same data. Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (n = 3). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2. 
As a next experiment for characterization, a photoaction spectrum has been recorded and compared with the absorption spectrum of PSI in solution as well as immobilized in the μITO structure. Fig. 6 displays the spectra normalized to the peak at 680 nm. The photoaction spectrum follows the overall wavelength distribution of PSI in solution and with the spectrum measured for a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode. Peaks are observed at 680, 620 and 440 nm corresponding to the Qy, the Qx and the Soret band of chlorophyll a.63 Due to scattering and the heterogeneity of surface confined proteins the absorption of the μITO–PSI–cyt c in the typical green gap is higher compared with that of PSI in solution. For shorter wavelengths the photoaction spectrum decreases as expected from the absorption behaviour. Due to the other assembled component cyt c and the high protein loading the Soret absorption at 410 nm (ferric) and 416 nm (ferrous) lowers the effective photon-to-charge carrier conversion of PSI.56 From the transmission spectra of ITO and μITO a decrease in transmission over the visible light spectrum going to shorter wavelengths is recognizable. If both spectra are compared, the transmission at 680 nm reduces from 86% to 24% for the 3D electrode (see Fig. S7†). This points to an increased scattering effect in the μITO. During the construction of the 3D electrodes ITO nanoparticles are used as the starting material. Due to their much smaller diameter than the incident light wavelength higher Rayleigh scattering can be expected (more pronounced at shorter wavelengths).
 Fig. 6  (Top) Photoaction spectrum of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode in comparison to the absorption spectrum of PSI in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) and to the absorption spectrum of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c, all normalized to the peak at 680 nm. Photoaction spectrum has been obtained with monochromatic light (bandwidth 15 nm, intensities <10 mW cm−2) in aerobic phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). Spectra are the averages of 3 independent measurements. (Bottom) External (EQE) and internal (IQE) quantum efficiencies of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode calculated for different light intensities. 
The quantum efficiency has also been calculated for various light intensities of the μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode, whereas the incident light-to-current efficiency is referred to as external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, a peak value of about 11% (6.6% at the apparent KM) is determined. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) represents the ratio of the number of absorbed photons to the number of produced charge carriers in a given time. For this reason the absorption spectrum of a μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode is taken and the number of photons absorbed by the electrode can be calculated from the light source spectrum (see Fig. S8†).
The calculation does not take into account the fact that due to the light scattering nature of the mesoporous structure the real absorption of the electrode will be lower. A plot of the IQE against the light power displays also a peak value at low light intensities of about 30% (and 18% at the apparent KM). These values represent one of the highest efficiencies of PSI electrodes to date.6,26,31,36,37,64 If we assume that only PSI contributes to the photocurrent, which can even be seen from the photoaction spectra, the IQE can also be calculated from the absorption spectra of PSI in solution corrected for the respective PSI concentration in a 6× layer μITO electrode. Here, an IQE of even 39% (and 23% at the apparent KM) is achieved. This value clearly demonstrates that either scattering/reflectivity effects or the additional cyt c absorption influences the efficiency of the electrode. Nevertheless this system has already provided very good performances at low intensities, in contrast to approaches which need more than one order of magnitude higher light intensities.48
Conclusions
In this study a mesoporous scalable 3D electrode structure has been successfully combined with PSI, which is electrically wired by means of the redox protein cyt c resulting in a highly efficient photocathode. The experiments suggest a linear scalability of the photocurrent output over various layer thicknesses of the μITO electrode without boundaries (at least up to 40 μm). The thickness of the μITO can be easily adjusted during the preparation of the electrode by controlling the number of spin coating steps. The electroactive area follows the thickness of the 3D structure linearly. Due to the fast and easy preparation procedure of μITO, the electrode production speed can be significantly enhanced compared to other preparation protocols. Additionally the study of different fabrication procedures allows a deeper understanding of the functionality and limiting steps of the photo-biohybrid structure. PSI and cyt c can be well integrated into the 3D electrode structure. Remarkably the entire inner electrode surface can be used for protein immobilisation and photocurrent generation. On this basis it is possible to generate high cathodic photocurrents, which are scalable with the number of μITO layers used during electrode preparation. The system shows high quantum efficiencies and follows the spectral properties of PSI. The biohybrid approach enables the construction of more complex light-to-current converting devices, like the integration of enzymes or nanomaterials for light-to-chemical energy conversion. The study demonstrates that the cyt c–PSI wiring system can be applied to a variety of materials and surfaces, and allows photocurrent densities of more than 150 μA cm−2. Thus, it has shown its potential for further developments and applications.
Experimental methods
Isolation of photosystem I from T. elongatus
The growth of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 and extraction of membrane proteins from thylakoids were performed according to the method reported by Kern et al. in 2005.65 For the purification of PSI two chromatography steps were used. The first column was packed with Toyo Pearl DEAE 650 S (GE Healthcare) and pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 20 mM CaCl2, 0.02% β-DM, and 5% glycerol). After sample loading and washing the column with buffer A, PSI was separated from PSII using a linear gradient with buffer B (20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 20 mM CaCl2, 0.02% β-DM, 5% glycerol, and 100 mM MgSO4). PSI eluted at 80–90 mM MgSO4 was pooled and diluted with the same volume of buffer C (5 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, and 0.02% β-DM). The second column was packed with Q-SepharoseTM Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and pre-equilibrated with buffer D (5 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.02% β-DM, and 60 mM MgSO4). The PSI trimer was separated from the remaining PSI monomer by a linear gradient with buffer E (5 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.02% β-DM, and 150 mM MgSO4). The PSI trimer eluted at 150 mM MgSO4. The fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon stirring cell using a Biomax 100 membrane (Millipore). Finally, the PSI trimer was crystallised by dilution with buffer C at 4 °C until a concentration of 5 mM MgSO4 was reached. The crystals were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C, 4000g), washed with buffer C, re-solubilized by adding buffer F (5 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, and 30 mM MgSO4) and re-crystallised as described above. For the assembly experiments the crystals were dissolved in 10 mM tricine, 50 mM MgSO4, 0.02% β-DM, pH 8.
Preparation of μITO electrodes
ITO slides (20 Ω sq.−1, Sigma) have been cut into rectangles with dimensions of 0.5 and 1.5 cm. The slides have been cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol for 30 min each in an ultrasonication bath and stored in an oven at 150 °C prior to use. The cleaned ITO slides have been allowed to cool down to RT and placed on a spin-coater (SCC-200, KLM). Slides have been covered with parafilm to result in a free area of 0.2 cm2. A mixture of 800 nm diameter latex beads (LB, Sigma) and 50 nm ITO nanoparticles (ITONP, Sigma) has been produced according to Mersch et al.53 35 mg of ITONP has been suspended in 300 μL (6:1 methanol/water) and ultrasonicated for at least 1 h. 1 mL of a 2.5% LB methanol suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 25000g. After the removal of the supernatant the LB precipitate was resuspended with 300 μL ITONP solution and thoroughly vortexed. The mixture was then ultrasonicated in an ice bath for at least 5 min. Afterwards 4 μL of the ITONP/LB suspension was spin coated at 60 rps for each layer onto a geometrical area of 0.2 cm2. Between each layer there was a waiting time of 5 s after the next layer was drop-cast. The as-deposited μITO electrodes have been sintered for 2 h at 500 °C in a custom-made chamber under either an air or argon atmosphere. The air sintered μITO electrodes have been cleaned with air plasma for 5 min at 50% power (Diener electronic).
Preparation of μITO–PSI–cyt c electrodes
A volume of 2 μL of a 20 μM PSI solution (10 mM tricine, 50 mM MgSO4, 0.02% β-DM, pH 8) has been drop-cast onto the μITO electrode and incubated for 2 min. The unbound protein was removed by repeated washing in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). Afterwards the electrodes have been drop-cast with 10 μL of 1 mM cyt c (horse heart, Sigma) in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) and incubated for 2 min. Unbound cyt c was washed away by dipping into solution containing phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). This procedure appeared to be optimal, because changing the incubation order or protein concentrations yields less photocurrent.
Protein concentration determination
For PSI protein concentration determination, chlorophyll a has been extracted by incubating the electrode in 80% acetone for 2 h at RT followed by measuring the extinction at 664 nm using an extinction coefficient of 76.79 L mmol−1 cm−1.63
The cyt c surface concentration has been determined by cyclic voltammetry at 100 mV s−1 in a potential range of −300 to 400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The electro-active protein amount was calculated from the peak area and using Faraday's law.66
Electrochemical experiments
Electrochemical measurements have been performed using a potentiostat CHI660E (CHI) and a custom-made electrochemical cell containing 1 mL of phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7), a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetric measurements have been performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 or 10 mV s−1 if not otherwise stated and in a potential range from +400 to −300 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (ks) has been determined according to the method of Laviron.61 Experiments have been performed with scan rates of 5 to 3000 mV s−1 under ohmic drop compensation in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7).
Photoelectrochemical experiments
Photoelectrochemical measurements have been performed using an integrated system (CIMPS, Zahner) containing a white LED light source (4300 K, Zahner) with adjustable intensity (max. 100 mW cm−2), an electrochemical cell and a photodiode with feedback control to the light source via a potentiostat (PP211, Zahner). Electrochemical investigations have been carried out through a coupled potentiostat (Zennium, Zahner). In all experiments a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode have been used in an aqueous solution containing phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). Experiments have been performed under air saturation of the solutions. Photochronoamperometric experiments have been performed at RT and −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, while using an illumination time of 6 min and a light power of 20 mW cm−2 (for the white light source spectrum see Fig. S8†). Light power dependent photocurrent experiments have been done at −100 mV using a power range of 0.5–60 mW cm−2 of white light. Photoaction spectra have been achieved at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in aerobic phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using a monochromator (Polychrome V, Till Photonics) with a bandwidth of 20 nm.
Scanning electron microscopy
6× layer μITO electrodes have been prepared, according to the previously described procedure in this study. For the visualization of the morphology of the prepared electrodes, scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6510, JEOL) has been employed. The acceleration voltage was 10 kV. A working distance of 10 mm and a magnification of 12000 fold were chosen. Images have been recorded from the top and at an approximate angle of 45° relative to the surface normal.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representation of a μITO electrode with integrated photosystem I (PSI) and cytochrome c (cyt c). The μITO structure displays an inverse opal mesoporous structure with nanoparticle surface roughness. Cyt c binds to the surface and allows the electrical connection of PSI to the μITO electrode surface. After light excitation, electrons flow from the base ITO electrode in the μITO structure consisting of sintered ITO nanoparticles (ITO NPs) further to cyt c, which subsequently reduces PSI. The photo-excited electron within PSI can be transferred to molecular oxygen. The light blue arrows display intrinsic electron transfer in ITO, the dark blue arrow indicates the heterogeneous electron transfer, the yellow arrows show the protein–protein electron transfer and the red arrows display the PSI intramolecular electron transfer cascade.	 

 	Fig. 1  Scanning electron microscopy images of sintered μITO electrodes, prepared by 6 spin coating steps (6× μITO). Bottom left: top view of the 6× μITO electrode. After thermal removal of latex beads, the hole diameter can be determined to be 640 ± 10 nm (n = 20). Right: side view of the 6× μITO electrode. Defined separation between the successively added spin-coated layers with a height of 5.2 ± 0.4 μm per layer is visible. Top left: electroactive surface area increase dependence on the number of applied layers. Surface increases by 5.5 ± 0.01 cm2 per layer (R2 = 0.999, n = 4).	 

 	Fig. 2  Photocurrent response of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode. Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light (20 mW cm−2, 3 min) at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with constant stirring (dotted) or without (solid). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photocurrent density dependence on the number of applied μITO layers of a μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode and different sintering procedures (Pair = sintering under air = circles, Pargon = sintering under argon = squares). A linear relationship between photocurrent and the number of layers can be found (Pargon: 17.5 ± 0.4 μA per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.992; Pair: 7.7 ± 0.2 μA per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.989). Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light (20 mW cm−2) at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (n = 4). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2.	 

 	Fig. 4  Protein concentration (top) and turnover number (bottom) dependence on the number of μITO layers. A linear relationship between the protein amount and the number of layers can be found (PSI: 4.5 ± 0.2 pmol per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.997; cyt c: 0.46 ± 0.01 nmol per cm2 per layer, R2 = 0.998; n = 4). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2.	 

 	Fig. 5  Relationship of photocurrent density of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode with illumination intensity. Data have been fitted with the Michaelis–Menten equation (KM = 2.6 ± 0.2 mW cm−2, Jmax = 148 ± 2 μA cm−2, n = 1.0 ± 0.1, and R2 = 0.998). Inset: Lineweaver–Burk plot of the same data. Experiments have been performed at RT in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) using white light at a potential of −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (n = 3). Geometrical electrode area: 0.2 cm2.	 

 	Fig. 6  (Top) Photoaction spectrum of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode in comparison to the absorption spectrum of PSI in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) and to the absorption spectrum of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c, all normalized to the peak at 680 nm. Photoaction spectrum has been obtained with monochromatic light (bandwidth 15 nm, intensities <10 mW cm−2) in aerobic phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). Spectra are the averages of 3 independent measurements. (Bottom) External (EQE) and internal (IQE) quantum efficiencies of a 6× μITO–PSI–cyt c electrode calculated for different light intensities.
