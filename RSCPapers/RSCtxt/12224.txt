    , Accepted 7th December 2018First published on 7th December 2018AbstractAiming to circumvent the pre-defined obstacles in the journey of gene transportation, we attempt to compile a number of functional components into a tandem tri-copolymeric material. Herein, a β-cyclodextrin-functionalized poly(glycerol methacrylate) (PG) segment and a quaternary amine-functionalized poly[(2-acryloyl)-ethyl-(p-boronic acid pinacol ester benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (BP) segment are attached to complex DNA to formulate a nanoscaled delivery system based on electrostatic interactions. The formulated polyplex is strengthened by a hydrophobic poly[2-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yloxy)ethyl acrylate] (PDM) segment, affording improved complex stability. To retrieve the polyplex from entrapment by acidic and digestive endo/lysosomes, light-stimulated ROS-producing 4,4′-(1,2-diphenylethene-1,2-diyl)bis(1,4-phenylene)diboronic acid (TPE) is installed in the cavities of cyclodextrin. Upon light irradiation, TPE is triggered to produce abundant ROS, not only committing disruption of the endo/lysosome membrane for polyplex escape from the entrapment but also inducing the transformation of the positively charged BP to become negatively charged. This charge conversion behavior, together with the transformation of PDM to be hydrophilic and responsive to an acidic endosome pH gradient (pH 5.0) is envisioned to induce the dissociation of the electrostatically-assembled polyplex, thereby facilitating the release of the DNA payload for the subsequent transcription machinery. This strategically-tailored and easily synthesized tandem tri-copolymer exhibits excellent gene expression activity and provides a facile response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli for active gene expression.
Introduction
The unprecedented development in molecular biology and genomic science has led to appreciation of gene therapy as an intriguing approach for treatment of intractable diseases.1–4 Nevertheless, the task of transducing therapeutic proteins in the targeted cells requires manufacture of appropriate delivery vehicles, affording multiple functionalities to enable transportation of inherently fragile DNA in the harsh physiological milieu to the pathological sites and ultimate translocalization into the targeted cell nuclei for expression of the DNA payload.5–9 Pertaining to the cell transfection, for gene delivery vehicles, a number of pre-defined barriers are required to be overcome, including substantial protection of DNA payload in the extracellular milieu,10–12 facilitated endocytosis into the cells,13–15 appropriate facilities to retrieve DNA payload from the digestive endo/lysosome entrapment,16–18 trafficking to the nucleus,19,20 liberation of the DNA payload for transcription machinery,21,22etc. To overcome these obstacles, a variety of natural (cationic lipids, chitosan)23 and synthetic materials (amino-functionalized polymer)24–29 have been developed for the pursuit of improved gene transfection efficiency, wherein the cationic compounds could neutralize the negative charge of DNA and induce its condensation into a favorable nanoscaled formation. Aiming to promote the colloidal stability of the aforementioned electrostatics-based self-assembly, diverse strategies (e.g. introducing hydrophobic moieties) were proposed to strengthen the self-assembled structure and seek improved retention in the extracellular milieu.30,31 These design strategies have encouraged an appreciable cell internalization activity. However, the strategies in promoting the complete release of DNA from the complexed form to restore its biological activity during intracellular trafficking were rarely specified despite their crucial importance. Pertinent to the DNA release, the majority of delivery systems anticipated the presumable hydrolysis of delivery materials or that destabilization of the self-assembled delivery systems was supposed to occur in the complicated biological environment.
Aiming to accomplish complete liberation of DNA from the delivery system, we strived for a dual-responsive polycationic gene delivery vehicle. The nanoscaled delivery system was self-assembled by electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions of poly[2-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yloxy)ethyl acrylate] (PDM).32,33 Note that PDM was characterized to be hydrophobic at physiological pH, but become highly aqueous soluble (hydrophilic) when transferred to an acidic pH environment (e.g. endosome pH: ∼5). Moreover, the polycationic segment of poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid pinacol ester benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (BP) was subjected to charge conversion from positive to negative in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS).34,35 Consequently, the proposed dual-responsive functionalities could afford a tempting release profile of negatively charged DNA in ROS-abundant acidic environments. Given that the nanoscaled structure was documented to be internalized into the cells through an acidic endocytosis pathway, our proposed dual-responsive delivery system required supplementary ROS to enable the DNA release activity. To this end, we utilized an additional cyclodextrin-functional poly(glycerol mathecrylate) segment (PG),36 where light-stimulated ROS-producing 4,4′-(1,2-diphenylethene-1,2-diyl)bis(1,4-phenylene)diboronic acid (TPE)37,38 was installed at the cavity of cyclodextrin based on guest/host reaction.
Herein, a polycationic tandem material comprising multiple functional components was created for construction of a gene delivery system according to Scheme 1 and 2b, including: (1) BP: characterized to be a ROS-responsive charge reversable segment, whose molecular structure was designed to be able to transform from positively-charged (due to quaternary amino moieties) to negatively-charged (due to the yielded carboxyl groups) in response to ROS; (2) PDM: characterized to be a pH-responsive polymeric segment that converts from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in response to a pH gradient. (3) PG: characterized to be a linear polyamine segment, chemically tethered to cyclodextrin at the side chain to accommodate aggregation-induced emissive TPE [capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon convenient daylight impetus].

BP–PDM–PG(TPE) and pDNA are electrostatically complexed to formulate a delivery vehicle. Subsequent to cellular uptake, the ROS production due to TPE upon daylight enabled appreciable endosome escape activities and charge conversion of the positive-charged components (BP). Together with the hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition of PDM, as a result of acidic endosome entrapment, it synergistically contributed to the rapid liberation of DNA for transcription machinery. 
Experimental section
Synthesis of BP–PDM–PG
PD–PDM–PG was synthesized by ATRP reaction first. Briefly, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) (0.51 g, 3.6 mmol), 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl acrylate (DEAEA) (1.33 g, 7.2 mmol) and 2-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl)ethyl acrylate (DMDEA) (0.83 g, 3.6 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL of distilled DMF in a three-necked flask. Then, bipyridyl (0.03 g, 0.2 mmol), 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (0.02 g, 0.1 mmol) and CuBr (0.02 g, 0.1 mmol) were sequentially added into the reaction system. The reaction proceeded at 80 °C for 24 h under dry nitrogen. The reaction was subsequently quenched with an ice bath and diluted with tetrahydrofuran (THF). The reaction suspension was purified through a neutral Al2O3 column using THF as an eluent. The solvent was evaporated and the product was obtained by precipitating twice in cold n-hexane.
(6-(2-Aminoethyl)amino-6-deoxy)-β-cyclodextrin (CDen) was prepared according to our previously reported procedures.39,40 PD–PDM–PG (0.20 g) and CDen (1.66 g) were dissolved in distilled DMF (30 mL) and reacted at 70 °C for 24 h. Consequently, ethylenediamine was added (10 mL) to the flask and stirred at 70 °C for another 24 h with the aim of complete ring-opening reaction of the epoxide groups of PG. After the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, 4-bromomethylphenylboronic acid pinacol ester (0.80 g) was added into the solution and stirred at 25 °C for 24 h. The resulting crude product of PG–BP–PDM was purified by dialysis (Spectra/Por RC, cut-off 12000) against deionized water for 3 days and lyophilized to obtain BP–PDM–PG (0.28 g, yield: 85%).
Preparation of polyplexes
The host/guest complex of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) was obtained by mixing solutions of BP–PDM–PG and TPE at an equal molar ratio of CD moiety and TPE, followed by overnight incubation. In brief, BP–PDM–PG was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 3 mg mL−1. 60 μL of TPE solution (10 mM)41 was slowly titrated into the BP–PDM–PG solution. After overnight incubation, the obtained BP–PDM–PG(TPE) was diluted to a variety of concentrations to complex with pDNA solution for the preparation of polyplexes at varying N/P ratios (defined as the molar ratio of the total amino groups of the polymers to the phosphate groups of DNA).
Fluorescence emission of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)
TPE (20 μM, 1 mL) in carbonate buffer (0.2 M, pH 10.5)24 was mixed with BP–PDM–PG aqueous solution (1 mL) at various concentrations (0–2 mg mL−1). The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was investigated after incubation overnight.
Agarose gel electrophoresis
The binding potency of polymers to pDNA was estimated by agarose gel retardation assay. In brief, 5 μL of polyplex solution in PBS (pH 7.4 or 5.0) was mixed with 2 μL of 40% glycerol and 1 μL of loading-buffer. The mixture was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel at 100 V for 30 min. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide (EB) under a UV illuminator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). By referring to a similar protocol, the resistance of the polyplexes against the exchange reaction of anionic heparin was also evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Note that polyplexes (N/P ratio was 13) were incubated at a variety of heparin concentrations for 2 h at room temperature.
Gel retardation assay was also employed to detect DNA-release from polyplexes under oxidative treatment. BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/pDNA (N/P ratio was 13) was exposed to white light irradiation for different time intervals at a power density of 10 mW cm−2 (all the light irradiation experiments were performed under this power density) and the solutions were transferred to the gel electrophoresis unit as described above.
Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
The ROS-responsive BP–PDM–PG in the presence of H2O2 was determined by LC-MS. Herein, BP–PDM–PG was dissolved in 100 mM H2O2 at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 at 37 °C. At timed intervals, 250 μL of the solution was sampled and subjected to LC-MS analysis. A Waters LC-MS system (Waters Acquity UPLC Class I/Xevo G2Q-Tof) was used to monitor the 2-(diethylamino)ethanol release (injection volume: 5 μL, mobile phase: water/acetonitrile (9:1, v/v), 0.3 mL min−1. Source of ion: ESI, polarity: ES+).

In vitro transfection assays
Cells were seeded onto 24-well plates (1 × 104 cells, 0.4 mL per well) and incubated in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U mL−1 penicillin and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin overnight at 37 °C. The culture medium was exchanged with a fresh one and 50 μL of polyplex solution was added at a dose of 1 μg of CAG-Luc pDNA (reporter gene) per well. After incubation for another 48 h, the cell medium in each well was replaced with 100 μL of cell culture lysis reagent for 30 min incubation. Luciferase activity was measured by a luciferin substrate (Promega Co. Cergy, France) in a luminometer (FLX800, BioTek) and the protein concentration per well was calculated by a protein assay kit (Pierce). The results of gene expression were presented as a mean and standard error of the measurement from four samples.
Pertaining to gene transfection activities of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) upon daylight irradiation, HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates for 24 h and polyplex solutions (N/P ratio was 13, 50 μL) were then added into each well. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS 3 times and exposed to white light irradiation for 5 min. The cells were further incubated for 42 h at 37 °C after irradiation. The results are presented as a mean and standard error (n = 4).
Cell viability
Cytotoxicity of diverse polyplexes was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) kit. HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells per well) with 100 μL of 10% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was exchanged with fresh medium and various concentrations of polyplex solutions were added. After incubation for 6 h, the group of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) + Light was washed with PBS buffer 3 times and then exposed to light irradiation for 5 min, and incubated for an additional 42 h, while the other groups without light treatment were incubated for 48 h upon addition of polyplexes. The medium in each well was replaced with fresh medium, followed by addition of CCK-8 (10 μL) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of the reaction solution was measured at 450 nm on a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek). The cell viability relative to the control group was calculated according to the following equation:Cell viability (%) = OD450 (sample)/OD450 (control) × 100where the sample and the control represented the cells treated with and without polyplexes, respectively. The results are presented as a mean and standard error obtained from eight individual experiments.
Cell imaging
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was utilized to explore the intracellular distribution of polyplexes. HeLa cells were seeded in a 20 mm glass bottom dish (8 × 104 cells, 1 mL per well) and incubated in RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10% FBS overnight. Once the cell confluence approached approximately 70%, 100 μL of polyplexes solution of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) (100 μg mL−1)/Cy5-labeled DNA (ex: 633 nm, em: 670–690 nm) was added to the cells. After another 6 h incubation, LysoTracker Green DND-26 (ex: 488 nm, em: 520–560 nm) was added at a concentration of 100 nM and incubated for 90 min with the aim of staining endosome/lysosomes. Ultimately, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS for CLSM observation. In a parallel experiment, the cells were subjected to daylight exposure for 5 min post the aforementioned 6 h of incubation.
Intracellular ROS detection
Intracellular ROS production under daylight irradiation was detected with the aid of the fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). HeLa cells were seeded in 20 mm glass-bottom dishes at a concentration of 8 × 104 per dish for 24 h. The sample of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA (2.5 μg mL−1 DNA, N/P ratio 13) polyplexe was added to the cells, followed by 6 h incubation in dark. Prior to daylight irradiation, DCFH-DA was supplemented to the cells for 15 min incubation. The intracellular ROS was characterized by CLSM measurement (ex: 488 nm, em: 500–530 nm). Note that vitamin C (50 mM) was utilized as a ROS scavenger in the control experiment.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Significant differences in gene transfection and cytotoxicity between any two groups were evaluated using Student t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a level of P < 0.05.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characteristics of tri-copolymer and polyplexes
The synthetic procedure of the tri-copolymer BP–PDM–PG is illustrated in Scheme 2a. The precursor poly[(2-N,N-diethyl)aminoethyl acrylate]–poly[2-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl)ethyl acrylate]–poly(glycidylmethacrylate) (PD–PDM–PG) was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction and sequentially attached with the functional moieties of 4-bromomethylphenylboronic acid pinacol ester and (6-(2-aminoethyl)amino-6-deoxy)-β-cyclodextrin (CDen). The chemical structure of the yielded polymer BP–PDM–PG was confirmed by 1H NMR measurement (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and the molar ratio of the three polymer segments is approximately 1.25:1:2, which was obtained by calculating the integral area of the characteristic peaks of each segment (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Furthermore, TPE was attempted to be introduced to the yielded BP–PDM–PG based on the guest and host interaction between the hydrophobic TPE and cyclodextrin moieties of PG segments.42,43 As shown in Fig. 1a, a consistent rise in the fluorescence intensity of TPE was observed for the solution of TPE supplemented with a growing concentration of BP–PDM–PG. A plausible reason for this rise is believed to be as a consequence of the aggregation-induced emission character of TPE, where the restricted motion of TPE due to host–guest interaction (TPE captured into the cavity of cyclodextrin) caused a pronounced jump in the fluorescence emission. This result indicated the feasibility of utilizing cyclodextrin for absorption of TPE into the tandem polymeric system.

The yielded BP–PDM–PG(TPE) was utilized to complex with DNA to formulate the gene delivery system. The self-assembled formation was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. DLS measurement presented BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA as 167 nm in average diameter with a unimodal distribution (Fig. 1b). Consistent with the DLS measurement, SEM measurement captured BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA as spherical structures with a diameter of approximately 140 ± 15 nm (Fig. 1c). These results indicated that we have successfully manufactured a gene delivery system with nanoscaled structure and multifunctional components.
Enhanced colloidal stability
Adequate colloidal stability is the prerequisite for cellular uptake. The self-assembly of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) and DNA was based on electrostatic interactions of the amino groups of BP and PG(TPE) segments with the phosphate groups of DNA, as well as hydrophobic interactions of the pH responsive PDM segments. To test the functional role of the PDM segments, we evaluated the resistance of BP/DNA and BP–PDM/DNA against an exchange reaction with anionic heparin (note that glycosaminoglycan is abundant in diverse biological structures, including cell membranes, particularly glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of kidney, which has been determined to be the leading cause for poor retention of the electrostatically assembled complex systems). Here, BP/DNA and BP–PDM/DNA were incubated with heparin at varying concentrations, and the dissociation behaviors of BP/DNA and BP–PDM/DNA to release pDNA through polyion exchange reaction were determined by gel electrophoresis of the reaction solution. Apparent dissociation to release DNA was observed to start from a heparin concentration of 20 μg mL−1 for the sample of BP/DNA. Yet, BP–PDM showed markedly improved resistance to dissociation from heparin even at concentrations as high as 40 μg mL−1 (Fig. 1d). This result proved the functional role of the hydrophobic PDM segment in strengthening the colloidal stabilities of the electrostatics based complex.
Intracellular ROS generation
To accomplish gene expression, it is imperative for a polyplex to afford adequate facilities to end the endosome entrapment. To resolve this goal, the functional TPE was designed to enable ROS production for disruption of the endosome. Indeed, our previous study verified the appreciable efficiency of TPE in ROS production upon daylight.39 Herein, the intracellular ROS production was affirmed by visualization of ROS inside the cells [treated with BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA in the absence/presence of white light irradiation, 10 mW cm−2]. As shown in Fig. 2, remarkable ROS production was observed in the cells with 5 min treatment of daylight, whereas no ROS production was observed for the cells pre-treated with Vc (a scavenger of ROS). These results indicated the functional role of TPE in producing ROS. The ROS is assumed to disrupt the structure of the endosome and consequently facilitate the release of polyplex from entrapment.

The scale bar is 10 μm. 
Dual responsiveness of tri-copolymer
As aforementioned, the PDM segment could enhance the colloidal stability of the complexes due to its hydrophobicity, while its hypersensitivity to an acidic pH gradient (pH 5.0) is supposed to result in the transformation from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As shown in Fig. 3a, in the agarose gel electrophoresis experiment, the stability of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA appeared to be substantially lowered once incubated at pH 5.0, as apparently evidenced by the DNA release starting from a heparin concentration of 60 μg mL−1 contrary to the heparin concentration of 100 μg mL−1 at pH 7.4. Meanwhile, the reduced colloidal stability of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) at pH 5.0 was also suggested by observation of the rise in the DLS size from 167 nm to 489 nm (Fig. 3b). The drop in colloidal stability of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) at acidic pH 5.0 was conjectured as a consequence of PDM being susceptible to acidic hydrolysis. Indeed, 1H NMR spectra of BP–PDM–PG at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4) confirmed the hydrolysis behavior of the pendent ortho ester yielding the hydrolysis products, as evidenced by the rising emergence of the peaks at a, b and c. Hence, the pH-responsive PDM segment is confirmed to be subjected to a transformation from hydrophobic to hydrophilic upon a pH change to 5.0, thereby losing the function in strengthening the complex structure. Therefore, PDM can be employed as a facile component to regulate the structural stabilities of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA. The adequate BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA formation at physiological pH is envisioned to become susceptible upon entering the acidic endosome, where this is apparently favorable in pursuit of complete intracellular DNA release.

The produced ROS from TPE was anticipated to spur the charge conversion of BP segments. Note that BP was positively charged due to its quaternary amino groups. However, upon oxidation of the boronic acid pinacol ester group by ROS (e.g., H2O2), the quaternary ammonium becomes a tertiary amine, which consequently undergoes a self-catalytic process to experience rapid hydrolysis of the ester group to yield poly(acrylic acid) and 2-(diethylamino)ethanol (DAE). To test our speculations, we attempted a LC-MS measurement for the product of BP–PDM–PG in the presence of 100 mM H2O2 for varied periods. As shown in Fig. 3c, a consistent rise in the production of DAE was confirmed by the LC spectra. Moreover, MS measurement confirmed its molecular weight to be 117.1236, affirming the production of DAE. Consistently, zeta potential measurement also observed a progressive drop in zeta potential of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) from +17.20 mV to −5.36 mV upon daylight (Fig. 3d), affirming the charge conversion behavior of the functional BP segment. This conversion, together with the aforementioned pH-responsive PDM (becoming hydrophilic upon acidic entrapment), is envisioned to facilitate the complete release of the negatively-charged DNA payload. Electrophoresis of acidic BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA showed that daylight alone, without the aid of competing charged species, could result in clear DNA release, resembling naked DNA, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† validating our strategy of a dual-responsive material-design toward an endogenous pH gradient and exogenous daylight impetus for the disassembly of an electrostatically and hydrophobically formulated stable nanostructure and liberation of the encapsulated DNA for the subsequent gene transcription and translation process.
Endosome escape activity of polyplexes
The endosome escape activity of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA in the presence and absence of daylight was characterized by CLSM observations (Fig. 5). Endosome escape capacity of BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA was studied in terms of quantifying colocalization degrees of pDNA (red) and late-endo/lysosome (green), thus a lower colocalization degree represented a higher endosome escape capacity. As shown in the cells treated with BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA and no daylight, the majority of yellow (colocalization of endo/lysosome and DNA) was confirmed. On the contrary, remarkable red (release from endo/lysosome) was observed upon light irradiation, suggesting the possibility of daylight-mediated ROS production in provoking destabilization of endo/lysosome to attain endosome escape function. Noteworthily, we also found that as the incubation time increased to 18 h, we could capture more Cy5 signals in the nucleus, suggesting the ready endosome escape behaviors (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). To this end, we have confirmed the double benefits of ROS from TPE, which could not only steer the change of the charge of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) from positive to negative but also assist BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA to escape from digestive endo/lysosome.

Gene transfection and cytotoxicity assessment in vitro
In respect to the appreciable stimuli-responsive properties of the proposed BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA constructs, we attempted to evaluate their in vitro transfection activities. Gene expression activity evaluation verified the impact of the facilitated DNA release on gene expression activity. Negligible cytotoxicity, but adequate ROS expression for endosome escape of the proposed BP–PDM–PG(TPE)-based complex was validated by 5 min daylight irradiation (Fig. 2 and 6b). Accordingly, the transfection study was performed under 5 min daylight irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6a, markedly improved gene expression levels were confirmed upon daylight irradiation. Hence, we could conclude that ROS is not likely to interfere in the biological activity of the encapsulated gene under our experimental conditions. Actually, utilization of daylight as a stimulation is an appealing prospect if the pathological sites are located at the external layer (e.g. cutaneum carcinoma, dermatosis) or vaccination, wherein selective gene expression could be attainable at daylight-approachable skin (non-specific gene expression could be possibly minimized), which should be favorable in the pursuit of targeted therapeutics. Moreover, a significantly higher level of gene expression was also confirmed from tri-copolymer BP–PDM–PG(TPE)/DNA than di-copolymer BP–PDM/DNA. These results validated our well-tailored tandem tri-copolymer being capable of circumventing the obstacles presented in the journey of gene delivery, affording remarkable gene expression at the affected cells. Note, the cytotoxicity of BP–PDM–PG(TPE) in HeLa cells was determined to be negligible relative to the commercial polyethyleneimine (PEI), verifying the excellent biocompatibility of the proposed BP–PDM–PG(TPE) and its feasibility of being utilized in the manufacture of gene delivery systems (Fig. 6b).

Conclusions
To this end, we have demonstrated a well-defined tandem tri-copolymeric material, which enables synchronization of endogenous and exogenous stimuli to accomplish complete release of DNA. Particularly, the wide availability of daylight impetus is favorable to promote the practical translation of our elaborate material into a broad application. We believe that these results are crucially important for the design and development of nucleic acid delivery systems, particularly for the transportation of fragile single-strand mRNA and Crispr/Cas 9, which are susceptible to degradation in the biological milieu (even in the cell interior), and our carefully elaborated material characterized with by a fast and complete release capacity could fulfil its biological activities before premature degradation.

 	Scheme 1  Illustration of multifunctional BP–PDM–PG(TPE) copolymer in self-assembly with pDNA for promoted gene expression at the targeted cells. BP–PDM–PG(TPE) and pDNA are electrostatically complexed to formulate a delivery vehicle. Subsequent to cellular uptake, the ROS production due to TPE upon daylight enabled appreciable endosome escape activities and charge conversion of the positive-charged components (BP). Together with the hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition of PDM, as a result of acidic endosome entrapment, it synergistically contributed to the rapid liberation of DNA for transcription machinery.
