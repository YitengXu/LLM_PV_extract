    , Accepted 21st September 2019First published on 23rd September 2019AbstractHerein, a water-soluble molecular copper complex was investigated as a catalyst for O2 reduction in both water and an organic solvent. Although the quasi-stoichiometric oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for the formation of H2O2 was conducted in an organic solvent and revealed mechanistic insights into the ORR, the electrocatalytic production of H2O2 was achieved in an aqueous medium.
The rising standards of living in an increasing world population have made the scientific search for viable carbon-free sources of renewable energy important; hydrogen peroxide, relatively less explored as compared to hydrogen fuel, holds great potential for being an environmentally benign chemical oxidant, which is used in the pulp industry and water treatment, and is also a latent energy carrier with the standard Gibbs free energy of formation ΔG0f = −120 kJ mol−1 when H2O2 is produced from hydrogen (H2) and molecular oxygen (O2).1 When combined with sporadic renewable power sources including solar and wind, hydrogen peroxide may provide an alternative route to store energy in chemical bonds.2 Thus, hydrogen peroxide can be considered as an ideal fuel to reduce mankind's dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels.
At the current stage, hydrogen peroxide is produced in a centralized reactor on a very large scale by adopting the anthraquinone process, which is a batch method consisting of consecutive hydrogenation and oxidation of anthraquinone molecules; it is an energy-intensive, complex and precarious multistep method.3 Because of the unmet challenge posed by the high-energy-consuming two-step anthraquinone process, extensive efforts have been conducted to attain a synthetic breakthrough in the field of material chemistry, which involve the development of a selective and efficient system to produce hydrogen peroxide.4 This has also been undertaken by mimicking metalloenzymes since the catalytic reduction of O2 is essential for diverse biological processes including respiration, biosynthesis of several hormones, and breakdown of food.5 For example, cytochrome c oxidase, the so-called heme-copper oxidase found in mitochondria, catalyses the four-electron/four-proton reduction of molecular oxygen within the membrane to engender the proton gradient by producing H2O.6 To date, numerous efforts have been made to establish a reversible conversion between O2 and peroxide (O22−) by employing synthetic copper(I) complexes; the peroxide ligand bridging dinuclear copper(II) complexes have been discovered and proposed as functional models of hemocyanin.7 Herein, we described a combined stoichiometric–electrocatalytic approach for the production of hydrogen peroxide using a water-soluble molecular copper complex in both organic and aqueous media.
A molecular copper(II) complex, [Cu(HN3O2)(H2O)]2+ (1), bearing a pyridine-based ligand with an ethoxyethanol chain (HN3O2) was prepared according to a method reported in the literature (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†).8 The ethoxyethanol chain is expected to play an important role in (i) the solubility of the copper(II) complex by modulating the polarity of the copper(II) complex and (ii) the stability of the dimeric copper(II)-peroxo intermediate by creating a hydrogen bonding interaction with the peroxide ligand. In an effort to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electron transfer (ET) reaction between 1 and ferrocene derivatives was investigated. However, 1 did not react with 1,1′-dimethylferrocene (0.26 V vs. SCE), but reacted with octamethylferrocene (Me8Fc, Eox = −0.04 V vs. SCE) (Fig. 1). The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 exhibits a nearly reversible CuII/CuI couple with the E1/2(CuII/I) value of 0.08 V vs. SCE under aerobic conditions in CH3CN (Fig. S2, ESI†). Based on the redox behaviour of 1, the reduction of 1 was reasonably performed with Me8Fc in CH3CN at 20 °C (Fig. 1). However, the stoichiometry in the reaction of 1 and Me8Fc was approximately 1:2 based on the concentration of the octamethylferrocenium ion (Me8Fc+) in the final reaction solution; this indicated that the reduction of copper(II) was not catalytic (vide infra). The concentration of H2O2 produced in the final reaction mixture was determined by iodometric titration.9 The detected amount of H2O2 was consistent with the fact that the ORR proceeded with nearly complete selectivity for H2O2 (over 75%) (Fig. S3, ESI;† see Experimental section for details). Therefore, we proposed that the use of Me8Fc as a chemical reductant allowed the ORR in eqn (1), where the ORR rate was presumably dependent on the concentrations of O2, HClO4 and Me8Fc. (1)

Inset shows the time course monitored at 750 nm due to the formation of Me8Fc+. (b) Plot of kobs against the concentrations of Me8Fc to determine k1 in the reduction reaction of 1 (0.25 mM) by Me8Fc in CH3CN at 20 °C. 
To provide mechanistic insight into the ORR, we synthesized different species involved in each step of the proposed reaction and determined the second-order rate constants (k2) for each step (Scheme 1). The ET reaction between 1 and Me8Fc was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 750 nm due to the formation of Me8Fc+ under stopped-flow kinetic conditions at 20 °C (Fig. 1a). In the absence of HClO4, the formation rate of Me8Fc+ increased proportionally with an increase in the Me8Fc concentration, and the second-order rate constant (k1) of 1.5 × 104 M−1 s−1 was determined in CH3CN at 20 °C (Fig. 1b). Independently, a Cu(I) complex, [Cu(HN3O2)]+ (2), bearing the HN3O2 ligand was synthesized to directly investigate the reaction between the Cu(I) complex and O2 (Fig. S4 and Experimental section, ESI†). When a N2-saturated CH3CN solution of 2 was exposed to air at 20 °C, the yellow solution changed to green. The intermediate, denoted as 3, was relatively stable (t1/2 ∼ 10 h). However, single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were not obtained. The UV-vis spectrum of 3 displayed a broad absorption band at 320 nm (ε = 1700 M−1 cm−1) and 650 nm (ε = 150 M−1 cm−1), which had a great similarity to that of the dicopper(II) complex bridged with the peroxide ligand (Fig. S5, ESI†).10 Although several attempts of growing single crystals were unsuccessful, the DFT-optimized structure of 3 and its simulated UV-vis spectrum matched well with the above mentioned experimental results (Fig. S6, ESI†). Interestingly, the rate of formation of 3 from 2 revealed a rate law with a first-order dependence on the concentration of O2, and a k2 value of 2.4 M−1 s−1 at 20 °C was determined (Fig. S7, ESI†). rateoverall = kcat[O2](2)

Then, the rate of the protonation of the peroxide ligand within 3 was investigated by adding HClO4 at different concentrations to the CH3CN-solution of 3 at 20 °C under stopped-flow kinetic conditions; a k3 value of 3.4 × 102 M−1 s−1 was obtained (Fig. S6, ESI†). Therefore, the overall reaction rate of the ORR by 1 was dependent only on the concentration of O2 (eqn (2)).
However, efforts to catalytically reduce O2 by 1 (with a chemical oxidant) were unsuccessful due to the demetallation of copper(II) ion imposed by the presence of acid (Fig. S8, ESI†). This led us to consider the electrocatalytic ORR and possible oxygen evolution reaction by 1 in aqueous media for selective H2O2 formation (see ESI† for details and Fig. S9). Alkaline pH ranges were chosen to prevent the proton-induced demetallation of copper.
Oxygen reduction electrocatalysis involving 1 was evaluated using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup at pH 10 (see ESI† for details). As seen in Fig. 2, the oxygen diffusion limited steady-state current was achieved at 0.40 V (vs. RHE, 900 mV overpotential), 300 mV anodic as compared to that of a bare glassy carbon electrode. By varying the rotation rates of the RDE, the Koutecky–Levich analysis (see ESI† for details and Fig. S10) was performed to determine the electron transfer number. The number of electrons transferred during the electrolysis event was determined to be 2.9, suggesting that the selectivity for H2O2 was ca. 55% (only two possible pathways: (1) H2O2 production (n = 2) and (2) water production (n = 4)). Although not as high as that observed for chemical H2O2 production, compound 1 exhibited relatively good selectivity in electrocatalytic application. Unfortunately, at the reducing potentials where 1 catalysed the ORR, the bare carbon electrode further reduced H2O2 to water (Fig. S11, ESI†); therefore, H2O2 accumulation was not possible in an ORR environment.

To investigate the possibilities for the production and accumulation of H2O2 employing 1 as an electrocatalyst, an oxidation condition was applied, in which H2O2 would evolve as a product during water oxidation. In the pH range of 10–13, 1 exhibited electrocatalysis over bare carbon. The overpotential for the reaction was lowered by 200 mV at pH 12 (Fig. 3). The accumulation of H2O2 was inefficient at pH 10 and 13 (Fig. S11, ESI†), whereas appreciable synthesis and accumulation were feasible at pH 11 and 12 (Fig. S12, ESI†). The faradaic selectivity towards H2O2 was a function of the applied voltage, and optimum selectivity (51%) was observed at 1.8 V (vs. RHE; 570 mV overpotential) in a pH-12 solution. There have been several reports in the literature on the synthesis and accumulation of H2O2 from water;11 however, all these studies have employed metal oxide anodes. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on electrocatalytic H2O2 production during water oxidation with appreciable selectivity by a discrete coordination complex. The accumulation of H2O2 by the electrolysis of a 0.20 mM solution of 1 (pH 12) was conducted in an H-type cell, and the produced H2O2 was quantified by iodometric titration. As shown in Fig. 3, the H2O2 accumulation of up to ca. 0.35 mM (0.95 C, faradaic efficiency 30%, and turnover number 1.75) was achieved, comparable to the literature reported examples employing metal oxide anodes.11 No H2O2 production was observed in the absence of 1, indicating that the catalytic contribution from bare carbon was negligible. Moreover, we experimentally confirmed that the total faradaic yield of the system was unity; that is, the excess charge not included in the H2O2 production resulted in the formation of O2 (oxygen quantified by gas chromatography, see the ESI† for details). For example, in a typical set of experiments, the H2O2 yield was 22 ± 4% and the O2 yield was 76 ± 9% (ca. 0.9C total accumulated charge). Furthermore, a rinse test was performed to evaluate the electrochemical stability of 1 in an alkaline OER (Fig. S14, ESI†). After a few thousand seconds of operation, the electrode exhibited only the signs of slight compound physisorption, and no significant degradation of 1 was observed.

Compound 1 exhibited electrocatalysis for water oxidation by lowering the overpotential by ca. 200 mV at pH 10–13 as compared to the case of glassy carbon. The bottom panel displays the amount of accumulated H2O2 during water oxidation as a function of charge. Faradaic efficiencies are displayed in red dots. 
In summary, we presented the chemical and electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide by a water-soluble mononuclear copper(II) complex. Systematic investigations on the oxygen reduction reaction were carried out in organic media, and it was found that the rate-limiting step was dependent on the concentration of O2. Although several attempts towards the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction were not successful in organic media, electrocatalytic water oxidation by 1 yielded reasonable production of H2O2 at pH above 10. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports a rare example of electrocatalytic H2O2 production during water oxidation with appreciable selectivity.
