We demonstrate that the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of GO become closer to each other upon reduction. GO and rGO were blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to form composite films and their optoelectronic properties were evaluated. It was found that both electrons and holes from photoexcited P3HT can transfer to rGO leading mostly to recombination while only electrons transfer to GO.
Introduction
Graphene is a novel two-dimensional material with excellent physical and electrical properties with tremendous application potential in areas ranging from electronic devices to biosensors.1–3 The graphene sheets used today are mainly produced by oxidation–exfoliation–reduction methods from bulk graphite owing to the high efficiency, low cost and the solution processibility.4 When graphite is oxidized to graphite oxide,5 it can be easily exfoliated into graphene oxide (GO) in polar solvents and be further reduced to graphene. Thus, GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), regarded as functionalized graphene, are widely used as the alternatives of graphene in many applications.6
In 2008, Liu et al. reported that GO can be used as the acceptor material in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.4%.7 Subsequently, organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) with GO as the acceptor material have been widely studied with the aim to improve their PCEs to a level comparable to fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).8,9 Unlike PCBM, the energy band positions, i.e. the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), of GO is uncertain due to its non-stoichiometric nature. For expediency, the Fermi-level of graphene, 4.5 eV, is adopted for GO when designing the device structure of GO based OPVs in most of these studies.7 It has already been widely accepted that GO possesses a tunable bandgap which is related to the ratio of sp2/sp3 bonded carbon atoms and can approach zero after reduction.10,11 Thus, the LUMO of GO is not located at 4.5 V unless it is completely reduced to graphene. To date, very few studies have depicted the difference between GO and rGO in the optoelectronic properties at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces when blended with conjugated polymers. Therefore, gaining insight into the energy band position of GO and rGO is essential to fully investigate the mechanism of photo-induced charge transfer process at the D/A interfaces when blended with conjugated polymers.
In this work, purified dispersions of GO and rGO in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were obtained by iterative liquid phase extraction and solvothermal reduction as we have previously described.12 The LUMO and HOMO (LUMO/HOMO) of GO and rGO were estimated by UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The optoelectronic properties of P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO composites were investigated to further understand the charge transfer process at the D/A interface relevant to the applications of these composites in OPVs, photo-detectors and other optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials and methods
Preparation of GO and rGO. 1 mg ml−1 GO aqueous stock solution was prepared by dissolving graphite oxide powder (XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd.) in deionized water followed by water-bath ultrasound sonication (100 W) for 6 hours. GO was phase transferred to DCB with the assistance of didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) by iterative liquid phase extraction followed by a purification process to achieve 5 mg ml−1 purified dispersion of DDAB–GO (simplified to GO later) in DCB as we previous described.12 A portion of this GO dispersion in DCB was solvo-thermally reduced by DMF in a 120 °C oil bath for 5 hours to obtain a 5 mg ml−1 dispersion of rGO in DCB.
Fabrication of composites. 10 mg ml−1 regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) DCB solutions were mixed with the 5 mg ml−1 GO and rGO DCB dispersions in the volume ratio of 1:1 to form P3HT:GO (2:1) and P3HT:rGO composites solutions. Film samples of these composites were prepared by spin-casting at 1000 rpm on various substrates.
Characterization
General characterization. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images of GO, rGO sheets deposited on SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates were obtained using a Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope (NanoScope-IIIA, Veeco Metrology Group) in the tapping mode. Raman spectra of GO and rGO were obtained by a confocal Raman microscope (LabRam HR800) with a laser excitation of 633 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of GO and rGO were carried out by a X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (Escalab-250, Thermo Electron Co.). 200 μL of 1 mg ml−1 GO and rGO DCB dispersions were drop-casted onto 2 cm × 2 cm quartz slides and dried in a 40 °C drying oven to form uniform films. The UV-vis spectra of these film samples were measured by a UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer (TU-1900, PG Instruments Co., Ltd.).
Electrochemical measurements. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of GO and rGO were measured by a MPI-A ECL analyzer (Xi'an Remex Analytical Instruments Co. Ltd. China) using a three-electrode system with a glassy carbon (GC) disc (5 mm) as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, KCl saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.2) as the supporting electrolyte. 1.5 μL of GO and rGO DCB dispersions (1 mg ml−1) were drop-casted onto the abraded GC electrode and dried under ambient condition. The bare and GO/rGO film coated GC electrode were swept between 0 V and −1.5 V at the scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The CV of K3Fe(CN)6 (5 mM) dissolved in a 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution was also recorded as an external standard.
Time resolved photoluminescence measurements. The time resolved photoluminescence decay profiles of the composite thin films were obtained by the fluorescence up-conversion technique. A femtosecond pulse laser (80 MHz) (Mai Tai-HP, Spectra-Physics Ltd) combined with a frequency doubler (Inspire Blue) was used to provide 800 nm laser pulses as the probe and 400 nm laser pulses as the excitation. Film samples of P3HT, P3HT:GO, P3HT:rGO wee spin-casted onto glass slides and encapsulated with epoxy resin to minimize the oxidation induced degradation. Fluorescence decay curves were obtained by a time-resolved fluorescence measurement system (Halcyone, Ultrafast Systems Inc.) in the up-conversion mode.
Photoconductivity measurements. Simple devices with the structure of ITO/composite films/Al were fabricated to measure the photoconductivity of P3HT, P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO films. The Al electrode with thickness of 80 nm was deposited on the spin-casted film by thermal evaporation. The dark current and photocurrent of the composites films under 100 W white light illumination were collected by a programmable voltage–current sourcemeter (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA).
Results and discussion
General properties of GO and rGO
The AFM images of GO and rGO from DCB dispersions are shown in Fig. 1a. Sheets with micrometer lateral size and nanometer thickness (1–2 nm) can be seen in both images, indicating that both GO and rGO are mono-layered sheets dispersed in DCB. Raman spectra of GO and rGO (Fig. 1b) show two main peaks at ∼1325 cm−1 (D band) and ∼1598 cm−1 (G band). An increase of the ID/IG intensity ratio of rGO compared to GO was observed due to the decrease of average sp2 conjugation domain size or increase of amorphization.13 A substantial deoxygenation from GO to rGO was verified by the XPS measurement (Fig. 1c). The oxygen related peaks corresponding to C–O bonded carbons from both epoxyl and hydroxyl groups (286.7 eV), CO bonded carbons from carbonyl and carboxyl groups (288.2 eV) in the C1s spectrum of rGO were dramatically decreased compared to those peaks of GO. These observations are consistent with previous reports about the reduction of GO, indicating that rGO sheets dispersed in DCB were effectively reduced in our work.

Energy levels of GO and rGO
Energy gap. The UV-vis absorption spectra of GO and rGO films are depicted in Fig. 2a. An obvious red shift of the π–π* transition peak of CC bonds from 220 nm to 260 nm can be ascribed to the restoration of sp2 conjugation in the GO sheets during reduction.10 The n–π* transition peak at 300 nm attributed to CO bonds in the absorption spectra of GO disappeared in rGO, further confirming the oxygen reduction process. Based on these absorption data, the optical gap (Eopt) of GO and rGO can be estimated by Tauc plots using the equation (αhν)2 ∝ (hν − Eopt), in which α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy.14 The values of Eopt are equal to the intercept on the abscissa by the best fitting of the Tauc equation (αhν)2 ∼ hν plots. In this work, α is replaced by the normalized absorption value for simplification, giving the Eopt of GO and rGO to be 4.2 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively.

Being aware of band broadening in GO and rGO resulting from the sp2 clusters induced localized states, the existence of a band tail between the Eopt can be inferred. The width of the band tail is related to the Urbach tail (Eu) which obeys  in the low energy tail of the absorption spectra.15 Fig. 2c presents the lnα ∼ hν plots of GO and rGO films and gives their Eu as the reciprocal of the slope of the linear fitting curve,16 which are 1.2 eV and 2.7 eV respectively. Eg = Eopt − Eu is adopted to estimate the energy gap between the LUMO/HOMO of GO and rGO. Therefore, the energy gap of GO and rGO can be estimated to be 3.0 eV and 0.8 eV respectively. The decrease of Eg for GO upon reduction is consistent with literature reports.11

LUMO/HOMO positions. Notable reduction peaks can be observed in the CV of GO and rGO as shown in Fig. 3a. The reduction peak of GO centered at ∼−1.2 V has already been reported in previous work and was attributed to the electrochemical reduction of oxygen groups in GO.17 The intensity of the reduction peak dramatically decreased from GO to rGO due to the deoxygenation upon reduction. Simultaneously, the peak onset of GO also moves toward a lower value after reduction, which might be assigned to the increase of its electron affinity. Analogous to PCBM,18 the LUMO of GO and rGO can be deduced from the onset of the reduction peak according to the equation: . Considering the relation: EHOMO = ELUMO + Eg, the LUMO/HOMO positions of GO and rGO (GO/rGO) can all be determined as depicted in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that the LUMO/HOMO of GO become closer to each other and approach the Fermi level of graphene, 4.5 eV, upon reduction.

Photoluminescence properties
Steady state photoluminescence. Three peaks assigned to the 0–0, 0–1, 0–2 transition can be seen in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of P3HT, P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO films under 400 nm excitation as shown in Fig. 4a. In accordance with the literature, the 0–0 peak in the PL spectra of the conjugated polymer is associated with the recombination of excitons from intra-chain states while the 0–1 and 0–2 peaks are attributed to the inter-chain states.19–22 The PL spectra of the films are normalized to 1 at the 0–1 peak position in this work. An enhancement of the 0–0 transition peak and decrease of the 0–1 and 0–2 peak after the addition of GO/rGO to pristine P3HT is observed. These observations can be attributed to the weakening of interchain interactions of the P3HT polymer chains due to the embedding of GO/rGO sheets, implying the existence of a large hetero-interface in the P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO composites.

Time resolved photoluminescence. The time resolved photoluminescence decays of P3HT, P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO films detected at a fluorescence wavelength of 650 nm using 400 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 4b. The photoemission decay curves of the three samples required multi-exponential components for adequate fitting. Four major time constants can be extracted from the fits, labeled as τ1, τ2, τ3, τ4 and given in Table 1, which is consistent with literature reports about the time-resolved emission decays of P3HT thin films.23 The average emission lifetime of P3HT, P3HT:GO, P3HT:rGO films (determined as ) are 95.4 ps, 50.2 ps, and 39.4 ps respectively. The shortened lifetime of P3HT after the addition of GO/rGO can be seen as evidence of an electron transfer process from the photo-excited P3HT chains to GO/rGO sheets.24 The electron transfer is feasible in the P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO system as the estimated LUMO of GO/rGO is lower than that of P3HT (3.3 eV from the literature25). The shorter emission decay lifetime of P3HT:rGO film than that of P3HT:GO indicates that a faster electron transfer process occurs at the P3HT:rGO interface than the P3HT:GO. This can be explained by the larger free energy driving force (the energy difference between the LUMO of donor and acceptor) for the electron transfer process in P3HT:rGO leading to a higher electron transfer rate than that of P3HT:GO, which is similar to the electron transfer behavior in the GO–Au nanocomposite.26

Photoconductivity
Fig. 5a shows the photoconductivity behavior of three composite films including their current–voltage curves in the dark and under light illumination. The neat P3HT film shows little photocurrent while P3HT:GO and P3HT:rGO films display good photoconductivity. This fact indicates both GO and rGO sheets blended in the P3HT matrix provide pathways for the transportation of electrons from the dissociation of photoinduced excitons, thus the photocurrent of the composite films is effectively enhanced. Although the electrical conductivity of GO increased after reduction,27 the photocurrent enhancement of P3HT by rGO is less effective than GO. This result is also verified in the photoresponse profiles of these composite films. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the dark current of the P3HT:rGO film is much higher than both P3HT and P3HT:GO films, which is consistent with the fact that rGO is more electron conductive than GO. Furthermore, the photocurrent of P3HT:rGO increases much more rapidly from the light-off to light-on state compared to P3HT:GO, suggesting better charge carrier transport and current collection rates for P3HT:rGO film. However, the current increment (Ilight − Idark) upon illumination for P3HT:rGO (0.05 mA) is much less than that of P3HT:GO (0.45 mA). Considering the above results, a disparity arises due to the fact that rGO is able to accept and transport electrons more effectively while showing a relatively weaker photoconductivity enhancement in the P3HT film compared to GO.

The HOMO of P3HT (5.2 eV (ref. 25)) is higher than GO (6.6 eV) but lower than rGO (4.8 eV) based on our estimation. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the photo-excited holes in the HOMO of P3HT can also be injected to rGO sheets together with the electron transfer in the P3HT:rGO composite which is quite different to P3HT:GO. The localized states with low band gap, approaching zero, in rGO may be acting as recombination sites for the transferred electrons and holes. Consequently, many charge carriers in photo-excited P3HT:rGO film recombine in rGO by either radiative or non-radiative pathways before they travel to the electrodes under the external electrical field to produce a photocurrent, leading to the weak photoconductivity for the composite film.

Conclusions
The energy level of GO and rGO are estimated experimentally in this work. It is revealed that the LUMO and HOMO of GO approach the Fermi level of pristine graphene after reduction. When blended with P3HT, both GO and rGO can accept electrons from photo-excited P3HT and enhance the photocurrent of the composite films. Due to the low band gap, rGO can accept both electrons and holes from P3HT and serve as a platform for their recombination, which is not conducive to exciton dissociation and the transport of charge carriers. This finding suggests that GO is more appropriate to be an electron acceptor than rGO or even pristine graphene (which has zero band gap) in the various applications for conjugated polymer composites.
