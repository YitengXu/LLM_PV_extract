Herein, Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 were prepared and both exhibited high Fenton-like photocatalytic activities for the degradation of organic contaminants. Removal efficiencies of 85% and 92% were achieved for Congo red (CR) and Rhodamine B (Rh B), respectively. It is found from active species trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis that ˙O2−/h+ and ˙O2−/˙OH played key roles in the oxidation reaction of these two pollutants, respectively. The mechanisms were discussed on the basis of the cycles of Cu+/Cu2+.
Introduction
Digenite Cu9S5 (Cu1.8S) has received increased attention due to its excellent properties such as electrical conductivity, substantial copper-ion mobility, and electrochemical, photochemical and plasmonic properties.1 These properties open up potential applications in the fields of solar cells, photothermal conversion, sensors, superionic materials and photothermal therapy.2–6 To the best of our knowledge, there are a number of vacancies present in Cu9S5 owing to the escape of a small amount of copper from the crystalline lattice.7 Deficient sites can act as active sites for the substrate adsorption and activation in catalysis.8,9 One may reasonably assume that the catalytic activity of Cu9S5 would be correlated with their deficient vacancies. However, the photocatalytic properties of Cu9S5 have rarely been explored. Fenton-like photocatalysis is a subject of great recent interest due to its important role in the degradation of organic contaminants.10 The photocatalytic activity depends strongly on the electron and charge transfer at interfaces.11 Free hole-rich digenite Cu9S5 may provide a new opportunity to develop novel Fenton-like photocatalysts.12 Motivated by this, we selected Cu-deficient Cu9S5 as an efficient photocatalyst for the Fenton-like reaction.
Hybrid materials consist of at least two different components, providing a powerful approach to achieve novel properties.13 For example, Cu9S5–MnWO4 composites were applied in the photocatalysis of oxidative homocoupling of alkynes and amines.14 Cu9S5@C composites in which Cu9S5 embedded in the carbon framework have significantly enhanced the conductivity of the material.15 Park reported electrochemical NH3 production using Cu9S5/NC composites as the electrocatalyst.16 MOFs with high surface areas can not only avoid the aggregation of semiconductor nanoparticles, but also provide more reaction centres as well as catalytic active sites. UiO-66-NH2 exhibits semiconductor-like properties in the photocatalytic process because of their appropriate organic ligands acting as visible-light-harvesting centers and activating metalcluster nodes during the photoexcited process.17,18 Cu2O@Cu@UiO-66-NH2 boosted the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 upon visible-light illumination.19 ZnIn2S4@UiO-66-NH2 exhibits high photocatalytic activity for dye degradation and hydrogen evolution under visible light.20 It can be expected that the combination of Cu9S5 with UiO-66-NH2 and their composites would exhibit different catalytic activities.
Herein, we demonstrate that both Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites serve as highly active Fenton-like photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants. Active species trapping experiments and ESR analysis proved that superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and photogenerated holes (h+) were the two main active species in the degradation of CR over Cu9S5. The major reactive substances leading to the Rh B degradation in the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 system were confirmed to be ˙OH and ˙O2−. Presumably, the enhanced absorption capacity made the composites absorb more H2O2 to form hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−), which further promoted the redox cycles of Cu2+/Cu+. Furthermore, not only high photo-catalytic activity but also good recyclability and stability were observed for both catalysts. We anticipate that our work will arouse more interest towards Cu9S5 materials for application in photo-Fenton reactions.
Experimental
Materials
Reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received. 2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMTD) was obtained from Bailingwei Chemical Reagent. ZrCl4 and 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd, AR). K2S2O8, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-2Na), p-benzoquinone (BQ) and tert-butanol (TB) were purchased from the Tianjin Chemicals Company. CuCl2·2H2O, NH3·H2O, DMF (AR grade), Rhodamine B (RhB) and Congo red (CR) were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. Water was deionized and bidistilled.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a Nicolet iZ10 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Co., USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a German Brooke XRD-D8 Advance D8 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, voltage 40 kV, and current 40 mA). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra experiments were performed on a Hitachi UV-vis 3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd Tokyo, Japan). The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Ltd Tokyo, Japan) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Hitachi Ltd Tokyo, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientifific, EscaLab 250Xi spectrometer, America) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used to analyze the elements (hv = 1486.6 eV, power 150 W, beam spot 650 μm, voltage 14.8 kV, current 1.6 A and testing software is avantange). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed in absorption mode in the range of 200–800 nm using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer (Shimadzu Ltd Japan). The generated radical species were detected by employing an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer (EMX-8, Bruker, Germany) with DMPO.
Synthesis of UiO-66-NH2
UiO-66-NH2 was prepared according to a procedure described in the literature.21 ZrCl4 (9 mmol L−1) and 2-aminoterephthalic acid (8 mmol L−1) were separately dissolved in 5 mL of DMF with stirring. Then, the binary solutions were assorted in a glass bottle with the addition of 1.2 mL of acetic acid and ultimately stirred for 30 min. Finally, the solution was kept at 120 °C for 12 h to yield UiO-66-NH2. The solid brown product was obtained by centrifugation and washed thrice with DMF, H2O and ethanol individually to remove the surfactant and excess reactants. To eliminate the solvent, the obtained UiO-66-NH2 was activated immediately at 50 °C.
Synthesis of Cu9S5
Cu9S5 was prepared according to our previous work.4 A DMF solution of DMTD (30.2 mg, 0.2 mmol, and 1 mL) was added to aqueous solution of CuCl2·2H2O (17.0 mg, 0.1 mmol, 1 mL), and a brown precipitate was formed. Subsequently, NH3·H2O (12 mol L−1, 150 μL) was added dropwise. The brown slurry changed to pale yellow. The product was separated by centrifugation, washed with methanol and diethylether and dried at 50 °C for 8 h to constant weight for further studies. The colloidal solution of Cu9S5 (100 mg L−1) was prepared as follows: 10.0 mg of Cu9S5 solid powder was dispersed in 100 mL of distilled water with ultrasound.
Synthesis of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2
In a typical synthesis, 50 mg of UiO-66-NH2 was ultrasonically dispersed in 10 mL of DMF solution. Subsequently, 8.5 mL of deionized water, 0.4 mL of 0.25 mol L−1 CuCl2·2H2O, and 0.1 mL DMF of DMTD solution were successively injected into the as-obtained UiO-66-NH2 solution under rigorous stirring. After 5 min, 1 mL of NH3·H2O solution was added dropwise to form a colloidal solution, which was kept at room temperature for the synthesis of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites. After 5 h, the product precipitated at the bottom of the tube was obtained by removing the clear top solution and subsequently, the product was well washed with water and dried at 70 °C to yield Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 for characterization and catalytic evaluation.
According to the above-prescribed procedure, Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites with various Cu9S5 contents were rationally synthesized by merely changing the concentration of CuCl2 and DMTD in the initial precursors.
Photocatalytic degradation of organic polluents
The photocatalytic degradation of the organic dye was carried out at room temperature under visible light. The details are as follows: Cu9S5 or Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites (12.5 mg) were dispersed in aqueous solution of CR or Rh B (55 mg L−1, 15 mL), respectively. Under dark conditions, the suspension was stirred for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium. The experiment was conducted by irradiating the suspension with a 300 W xenon lamp coupled with a UV cut-off filter (λ > 400 nm) while stirring. Every 30 min, the samples (1 mL) were withdrawn from the reactor; the powder was suspended by centrifugation and analyzed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The efficiency of dye degradation was obtained by C/C0, where C is the concentration of undecomposed CR and Rh B and C0 is the initial concentration of CR and Rh B. The cycle tests of photocatalytic degradation were carried out by the centrifugation of the reaction solution, and the catalysts were reused four times.
Additives that could scavenge different active radicals were utilized in comparative trials to illuminate the degradation process of dyes. K2S2O8 (1 mmol L−1), disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-2Na, 1 mmol L−1), p-benzoquinone (BQ, 1 mmol L−1) and tert-butanol (TBA, t-BuOH, 1 mmol L−1) were introduced into the reaction system to capture electrons (e−), holes (h+), superoxide anion free radicals (˙O2−) and hydroxyl free radicals (˙OH), respectively. These tests were performed following the photocatalytic degradation process mentioned above.
Fenton-like reaction
Degradation experiments were carried out at room temperature (approximately 25 °C). The solution pH was adjusted by HCl (0.1 mol L−1) or NaOH (0.1 mol L−1). In each experiment, 100 mg of the catalyst was added into CR or Rh B aqueous solution (10 mg L−1, 100 mL) followed by the addition of 1 mL of H2O2 (30%) into the solution to initiate the Fenton-like reaction. Before illumination, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the catalyst and dye molecules. The sampling analysis was conducted in 10 min interval and 3 mL suspension was sampled and centrifuged to remove the catalyst particles. The degradation efficiency (η) was calculated by η(%) = (1 − Ct/C0) × 100%, where C0 and Ct are CR or Rh B concentrations at the initial time and at time t, respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2
Cu9S5 was synthesized according to the literature.4 The preparation procedures of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 are illustrated in Scheme 1. UiO-66-NH2 was first accomplished hydrothermally by employing zirconium chloride and 2-aminoterephthalic acid in DMF. Then, NH3·H2O was dropped into the mixture of UiO-66-NH2, DMTD, CuCl2 and DMF/H2O(1:1) to form Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites.

Characterization of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2
The morphologies of UiO-66-NH2, Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Cu9S5 nanosheets aggregated to form flower architectures with diameters of 6–8 μm (Fig. 1a).4Fig. 1b clearly illustrates that UiO-66-NH2 possessed octahedral shape, uniform size, and smooth surface with an average size of 70–80 nm.22 The image of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 shows the well-dispersed nature of UiO-66-NH2 on the surface of Cu9S5 (Fig. 1c). The structure component of the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites was further confirmed by EDS analysis (Fig. 1d).

XRD was employed to determine the phase and purity of the obtained products (Fig. 2a). It demonstrated that Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 exhibited all the characteristic peaks for UiO-66-NH2 (JCPDS#00-065-2870) and Cu9S5 (JCPDS#26–0476). FT-IR was used to investigate the functional groups in the composites. Fig. 2b shows the distinctive absorption peaks of Cu9S5, UiO-66-NH2 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, respectively. The double peaks at 3477 cm−1 and 3340 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of the amine groups in UiO-66-NH2, respectively.22 The bands at 1642 cm−1 and 1244 cm−1 stand for the N-H bending vibration and C-N stretching of aromatic amines, respectively. The small vibrational mode at 1510 cm−1 signifies the vibration of the CC moiety of the benzene ring,23 whereas, the peaks at 487, 667, and 760 cm−1 are associated with Zr–(O–C) asymmetric stretching, OCO bending and CC stretching, respectively. The FT-IR results show good correlation with the previously reported results.24 The bands at 1385, 1358, 1082 and 1050 cm−1 are assigned to the vibrations of ν(C–N) and ν(N–N) in AMTD, and the ligand protected Cu9S5.4 Therefore, the heterojunction of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 with a slight shift of the Cu–S bond in comparison to parent Cu9S5 which proves good integration of the pristine MOF and Cu9S5 leading to the formation of intimate interacted p–n heterojunctions. The corresponding elemental mapping images revealed that Cu, Zr, C, O, and N were uniformly distributed on Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 further verifying the wrapping of UiO-66-NH2 on the surface of Cu9S5 to form a heterogeneous structure (Fig. 3a–f).

N2-adsorption/desorption isotherms of Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites are shown in Fig. 4a. Cu9S5 has a BET surface area of 42.1845 m2 g−1, while the BET surface area of UiO-66-NH2 is up to 364.1380 m2 g−1 that shows a steep nitrogen gas uptake at low relative pressure, exhibiting an abundant micropore framework. After the introduction of UiO-66-NH2, the BET surface area of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites, 228.3523 m2 g−1, is obviously increased compared with that of Cu9S5, and the type of micropore structure can be observed clearly, indicating that UiO-66-NH2 with a high surface area is successfully coated on the surface of Cu9S5.25 The pore size distribution curve indicated a wide diameter distribution ranging from 2 to 150 nm (Fig. 4b).5

The optical absorption properties of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2 are shown in Fig. 5a. Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2 displayed solar energy absorbance and their band edges approximately at 420 nm. The observation indicated that the absorption range of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was slightly wider than that of Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2. The band gap energies (Eg) of the direct transition semiconductor can be calculated according to the plot of (ahv)2versus photonenergy (hv).26 As shown in Fig. 5b, the Eg of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was estimated to be 2.51 eV, which was narrower than that of Cu9S5 (2.68 eV) and UiO-66-NH2 (2.84 eV). Furthermore, we proposed that the higher photodegradation activity of RhB over Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 than that of CR might be attributed to the efficient RhB-photosensitization effect.27,28

The composition and valence state of the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites were confirmed by XPS. The survey spectrum indicates the presence of Cu, Zr, S, C, N, and O, corresponding to the above EDS results. The Cu 2p XPS spectrum showed two prominent peaks centered at 932.3 and 951.9 eV from the Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, indicating the existence of Cu(0) or Cu(I) in Cu9S5.4 In the Cu 2p spectrum of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, two couple of peaks located at 932.9, 952.6 eV and 933.4, 953.2 eV originated from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of univalent copper (Cu+) and zero copper (Cu0) respectively (Fig. 6a).29,30 The Zr 3d spectrum exhibits two main peaks at 183.0 and 185.3 eV which are assigned to the presence of Zr4+ (Fig. 6b).31 The deconvoluted N 1s spectrum demonstrated two sharp peaks at binding energies of 399.6 and 400.4 eV corresponding to –NH2+ and –NH3 linkages, respectively.32 The main peak at 532.1 eV obtained in the O 1s spectrum is assigned to –COOH groups in Zr-MOFs (Fig. 6d).33Fig. 6e shows the XPS spectrum of the S2p region, which can be fitted with two main peaks at 164.1 eV and 162.8 eV, that is S 2p3/2 and S2p1/2 for S2− and another two side peaks at 165.3 and 168.6 eV for SO42− rooted in the oxidation of S2− by O2 in the aqueous solution.6,34 The C1s spectrum was fitted into three separate peaks which was located at 284.6 eV, 286.0 eV and 288.9 eV, corresponding to C–C, C–O and CO, respectively (Fig. 6f).35,36 These results showed that UiO-66-NH2 was successfully loaded on Cu9S5, which is fully consistent with those results obtained from various characterization methods.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) beneficial results were inspected to describe the charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 7a). The Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites displayed little bit smaller diameter of impedance curve, bring to light charge transfer resistance in contrast with simple Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2. The photocurrent analysis of the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 samples was carried out to further investigate the photoelectric performance. The transient photocurrent response is considered as a qualitative measurement to evaluate the separation efficiency and mobility of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Fig. 7b shows the transient photocurrent versus irradiation time for Cu9S5, UiO-66-NH2 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 photoelectrodes. When the light is switched-off and switched-on, the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 generates a significantly enhanced photocurrent under visiblelight irradiation compared with pristine Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2. The average photocurrent density of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 is about 3.5 times as high as that of pure UiO-66-NH2, and 0.7 times than that of the bare Cu9S5. Hence, the photocurrent improvement of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 can be ascribed to the suppressed recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, corresponding to the above discussion and photocatalytic performance.

Photocatalytic performances
The photocatalytic performances of the prepared catalysts were examined towards photodegradation of two model dyes, Congo red (CR) and Rhodamine B (RhB). The photodegradation results of CR and RhB are presented in Fig. 8 and 9, respectively. The dyes CR and Rh B were only slightly degraded in the blank reaction, indicating that they are stable molecules under visible light. It can be observed that the removal of dyes was affected by the adsorption and photodegradation processes. Approximately, 50% of CR and 30% of Rh B could be removed by adsorption in 60 min dark experiments, and then continuously removed by the photodegradation process. The best CR and Rh B removal efficiency of 85% and 92% could be achieved over Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, respectively (Fig. 8a and 9a). Cu9S5 shows the degradation performance that could be correlated with the fast recombination rate of photogenerated holes and electrons. UiO-66-NH2 exhibits a little photocatalytic activity. UiO-66-NH2 does not exhibit visible-light activity, but it can occur due to the weak physical absorption after the equilibrium and indirect dye photosensitization.

(c) CR degradation by Cu9S5 with different initial pH and (d) different H2O2 concentrations. 
The kinetic curves obtained for all samples were linear following the first-order kinetic model described in Fig. 8b and 9b. For the photocatalytic degradation of CR, by comparing the reaction rate constrains, it is noticeable that the photocatalytic activity of Cu9S5 displays a faster degradation rate than Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. 8b). It can be seen that the constant rate of Cu9S5 is 0.1143 min−1, which is 2.97 times higher than in the case of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 (0.0384 min−1), and 20.4 times than in the case of UiO-66-NH2 (0.0056 min−1). However, the photodegradation rate of RhB over Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was faster than that of Cu9S5 and UiO-66-NH2. The constant rate of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 is 0.0845 min−1, which is 6.45 times higher than Cu9S5 in the case of (0.0131 min−1), and 7.35 times than in the case of UiO-66-NH2 (0.0115 min−1) (Fig. 9b).

(c) Rh B degradation by Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 with different initial pH and (d) different H2O2 concentrations. 
The effects of initial pH on dye degradation in these Fenton-like systems were investigated. Several experiments were conducted by varying the solution pH from 2 to 10 to evaluate the pH effect on the degradation of CR and Rh B. As shown in Fig. 8c, the highest degradation efficiency of CR was achieved at pH = 6.5 in the initial 30 min, and the efficiencies decreased in the order of pH(6.5) > pH(8.5) > pH(4.5) ≈ pH(10.5). The highest degradation efficiency of Rh B was achieved at pH = 5.8 in the initial 30 min, and the efficiencies decreased in the order of pH(5.6) > pH(7.3) > pH(9.3) > pH(2.8) (Fig. 9c).
H2O2, as a precursor of ˙O2− and ˙OH, was employed to induce CR and Rh B degradation in the presence of Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites, respectively, after the two systems reached the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Different concentrations of H2O2 were added to evaluate the effect of H2O2. The degradation rates of CR and Rh B were detected with the H2O2 concentration increased from 30 to 300 mM. 54 mmol L−1 and 190 mmol L−1 were found to be the optimum concentration for the photo-Fenton-like degradation of CR (Fig. 8d) and Rh B (Fig. 9d), respectively. First, the dye degradation efficiency evidently enhanced as the H2O2 concentration increased. This states the fact that a higher H2O2 concentration leads to sufficient reactive oxidative species such as ˙O2−, and ˙OH for attacking dye molecules. However, on keeping the H2O2 concentration continuously increased, the degradation rate oppositely declined, as a very high H2O2 concentration was more prone to H2O2 decomposition.37,38 This is because the redundant H2O2 can be a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and an inhibitor of copper-based catalyst corrosion.
Moreover, it has been found that the photocatalytic activity of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was affected by the content of Cu9S5 in the composites. It enhanced with the increasing amount of Cu9S5 (0–33%) and decreased when that of Cu9S5 was over 33% (Fig. 10).

Active radical identification
As is known, the oxidative species generated by the separation of electron–hole pairs on the semiconductor photocatalysts plays a pivotal role in the process of photodegradation and mineralization of organics. Tert-Butylalcohol (TBA), p-benzoquinone (BQ), ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA-2Na) and K2S2O8 were employed as the scavengers of hydroxylradicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals (˙O2−), photo-holes (h+) and photo-electrons (e−), respectively. The experiment showed that the hydroxyl radical (˙O2−) and photogenerated holes (h+) were the two main active species in the degradation of CR over Cu9S5 (Fig. 11a). However, hydroxylradicals (˙OH) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) were the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB over Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. 11b).

Possible degradation mechanism
The plausible photodegradation mechanism of CR over Cu9S5 is presented in Scheme 2. First, a fraction of CR in solutions can be absorbed in Cu9S5. When illuminated under visible light, Cu9S5 can absorb energy and produce photogenerated e− and h+ on its conduction band, then the photogenerated e− combines with O2 (eqn (1)) to form active radicals ˙O2− (eqn (2)).39 Cu2+ was reduced by H2O2 to generate Cu+ and simultaneously produced HO2• (eqn (3)).40 Undoubtedly, electrons play an important role in improving the efficiency of Fenton reactions by accelerating the Cu2+ to Cu+ process, which promotes the regeneration of Cu2+ reaction centers. ˙O2− and h+ on the composite surface diffused to the solutions and broke CR down to small molecules, and even mineralized into CO2 and H2O (eqn (4)). Cu9S5 + hv → e− + h+(1) Cu+ + O2 → Cu2++ ˙O2−(2) Cu2++ H2O2 → Cu+ + HO2˙ + H+ (major)(3) ˙O2−/h+ + CR → degradation products(4)
 Scheme 2  Proposed mechanism of photocatalytic Fenton-like degradation of CR over Cu9S5. 
Based on active species trapping experiments, a possible reaction mechanism for the interaction on the surface of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was proposed in the Fenton-like photocatalytic degradation of Rh B, and is shown in Scheme 3. The absorption capacity of the as-synthesized composites has been enhanced when UiO-66-NH2 combined with Cu9S5. This hybrid material could absorb more substances such as O2 in the air, H2O2 and dye molecules in the degradation reaction process. Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 absorbs energy and produces photogenerated e− and h+ on its conduction band (eqn (5)). O2 as an electron acceptor triggered the reaction for Rh B degradation over Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 (eqn (6)).39 Copper undergoes a Fenton-like system reaction with H2O2 to achieve mutual conversion between Cu+ and Cu2+ and produce ˙OH and ˙O2−, respectively, as shown in eqn (7)40 and eqn (8).40–42 Rh B and its intermediate products chelating with Cu2+ on the surface of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 promoted the generation of ˙O2− and enhanced the cycle of Cu2+/Cu+.43 ˙O2− and ˙OH diffused to the solutions and broke Rh B down to small molecules, and even mineralized into CO2 and H2O (eqn (9)). Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 + hv → e− + h+(5) Cu+ + O2 → Cu2+ + ˙O2−(6) Cu+ + H2O2 → Cu2+ + OH− + ˙OH(7) Cu2+ + H2O2 → Cu+ + H+ + HO2˙(8) ˙O2−/˙OH + Rh B → degradation products(9)
 Scheme 3  Proposed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of RhB over Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2. 
Therefore, the excellent catalytic ability of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 for Rh B could be attributed to the high absorption ability of this composite. RhB dye is categorized by its cationic nature, which increases its adsorption capability on the Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 surface, thus resulting in good catalytic activity.44
To further ascertain the reaction mechanism, ESR spectra were recorded to analyze the reactive oxygen radicals generated in different systems in the presence of H2O2. In blank experiments, no signals were observed for the suspensions of Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, respectively. There were weak ˙OH radical peaks (Fig. 12a) and ˙O2− radical peaks (Fig. 12b) in Cu9S5 dispersions. Four strong characteristic peaks of DMPO-˙OH radicals (Fig. 12c) and sextet peaks of ˙O2− radicals (Fig. 12d) were observed in Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 suspensions. These results indicate that H2O2 was predominantly reduced to ˙OH radicals by Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2, while being converted to ˙O2− radicals by Cu9S5.

Four cycle runs of Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 and Cu9S5 were performed to test their reusability. It has been found that the removal efficiency after 4 cycles is still up to 90% and 89% for Rh B and CR, respectively (Fig. 13a and c), manifesting the relatively stability of these two catalysts. Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 and Cu9S5 still retain the same structure before and after the reaction, as observed from their spectra and XRD pattern shown in Fig. 13b and d.

Conclusions
In summary, Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 was successfully prepared, in which UiO-66-NH2 was located on the surface of Cu9S5 to form a hybrid material. The experimental results have shown that Cu9S5 and Cu9S5@UiO-66-NH2 composites exhibited excellent Fenton-like photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic pollutants, Congo red and Rhodamine B, respectively, with the assistance of H2O2. This research provides a foundation for the use of Cu nanoclusters and their composites in the Fenton reaction.
