        β-In2S3 is a nontoxic window layer material usually used in a thin-film solar cell. Transition metal (TM)-incorporated In2S3 has been proposed to promote conversion efficiency in In2S3 because multi-photon absorption by an intermediate band (IB) would happen in the sulfide. In this paper, band-edge and photoelectric-conversion properties of Nb-substituted In2S3 have been probed by thermoreflectance (TR), photoconductivity (PC), and photo–voltage–current (Photo V–I) measurements. The crystals of niobium-incorporated In2S3 with different Nb contents of In1.99S3:Nb0.01, In1.995S3:Nb0.005, and undoped In2S3 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using ICl3 as a transport agent. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the as-grown In2S3:Nb compounds are β-phase crystals with tetragonal structure. Lattice constants of the β-In2S3:Nb show shrinkage with the increase of the Nb content in the In2S3. Experimental TR spectra reveal four transition features including direct gap (E0), valence band to donor (EVS), valence band to IB (EIB), and acceptor to IB [Ed(IB)] transitions detected in the Nb-substituted In2S3 compounds. The band gap (E0) shows a reduction and the crystal color changes from fresh red, to red, to dark red with increasing Nb content in the undoped β-In2S3, β-In1.995S3:Nb0.005, and β-In1.99S3:Nb0.01. The PC and Photo V–I measurements verified that high photoelectric-conversion efficiency occurred in the β-In2S3 with higher niobium content. The intermediate band (IB) was formed by Nb substitution with indium in the β-In2S3 [i.e. detected by EIB≈1.52 eV and Ed(IB) ≈ 1.42 eV]. The IB state should mainly dominate the multi-photon absorption capacity and enhance the photoelectric-conversion yield in the indium sulfide.
1. Introduction
Recently the demands on environment-friendly and high-efficiency solar energy materials have been raised significantly for the purpose of green power and power conservation. In2S3 (Eg ≈ 1.935 eV) is an important material for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications,1,2 and is also a promising candidate for many technological applications due to its stability, nontoxicity, as well as its superior photoconductive behavior.3,4 For the development of Cd-free solar cells, the use of β-In2S3 as a buffer layer was combined with ABX2 (A = Cu, B = In, Ga, Al, and X = S, Se) to replace CdS, and a thin-film solar-cell module (large area, 30 × 30 cm2) with a high conversion efficiency of up to 12.9% was obtained.5,6 On the other hand, for the improvement of the photons' absorption yield, an advanced manner was used to increase the solar cell's efficiency by introducing an impurity energy level or intermediate band (IB) in the semiconductor band gap that absorbs additional lower-energy photons.7,8,29 Alloys contain high-density deep levels to form multi-photon absorption through IB may potentially be a good way to enhance the efficiencies of solar cells.9,29 Thus a larger number of photogenerated charge carriers are available for producing electric current, and the sunlight spectrum is more scrupulously and efficiently used.
Transition metal (TM) incorporated indium sulfide including Ag-10 or V-doped11In2S3 had been proposed to be photosensitive,10 and more effective in the improvement of photovoltaic efficiency.11 According to previous theoretical12 and experimental results,10,11 a tetrahedral semiconductor containing different TM dopants will become a valid IB material with distinct deep-level energies. However, for a silver-doped thin film,10 the dark resistivity and band gap decreased with the increasing silver content in the In2S3. The electrical behavior of the Ag-doped In2S3 thin film10 was therefore more likely to be a shallow impurity rather than a really deep-level effect to present a high resistivity. Besides, for the vanadium-doped In2S3,11 an induced IB by V could be detected in the reflectance spectrum by presenting an absorption step from ∼0.7 eV to ∼1.1 eV.11 The IB near the middle gap of In2S3 mainly consisted of V 3d orbitals and the multi-photon absorption was centered at ∼1 eV. Nevertheless, the solar spectrum (on earth) is just a blackbody radiation with stronger visible and near-infrared (NIR) emissions. The spectrum will then decay its intensity gradually toward lower energy portions of MIR and FIR. Therefore, for the use of an IB induced In2S3, it is better to enhance the multi-photon absorption close to visible-NIR region so that a high photoelectric-conversion yield can be achieved.
In this paper, the first attempt was made to grow Nb-substituted β-In2S3 and characterize the optical, electrical, and photoelectric-conversion behaviors of IB-induced chalcogenides including undoped β-In2S3, β-In1.995S3:Nb0.005, and β-In1.99S3:Nb0.01 (for simplicity, the notations in this article are denoted as β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 hereafter). Thermoreflectance (TR) measurements showed that the band gaps of Nb-substituted β-In2S3 gradually decrease with increasing Nb content in the In2S3 compounds. Temperature-dependent TR spectra of the β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 from 30 to 320 K revealed that an IB related deep-level center existed in the semiconductor band gap with energy of ∼1.52 eV above the valence-band edge (EV). The dark resistivity of the Nb-incorporated β-In2S3 presented a high value in the higher Nb-containing compound of β-In2S3:Nb0.01. It verifies the normal deep-level effect in semiconductors. Photoconductivity (PC) and photo V–I measurements showed that the highest photosensitivity as well as the largest photoelectric-conversion yield occurred in the indium sulfide with highest niobium content, especially for the NIR region. The IB formed by Nb 4d electrons could mainly dominate the photoelectric conversion in the Nb-substituted β-In2S3.
2. Experimental section
The single crystals of Nb-incorporated In2S3 with different niobium contents of undoped In2S3, In1.995S3:Nb0.005, and In0.99S3:Nb0.01 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) method13,14 using ICl3 as a transport agent. The compounds of the crystals were prepared from the elements (In: 99.9999% pure, Nb: 99.999%, and S: 99.999%) by reaction at 820 °C for 2 days in evacuated quartz ampoules. To improve stoichiometry, sulfur with 1 mol% excess was added with respect to the stoichiometric mixture of the constituent elements. About 10 g of the elements together with an appropriate amount of transport agent (ICl3 about 10 mg cm−3) were introduced into a quartz ampoule (22 mm OD, 17 mm ID, 20 cm length), which was cooled with liquid nitrogen, evacuated to 10−6 Torr and sealed. The mixture was slowly heated to 820 °C. This slow heating is necessary to avoid any explosions due to the strongly exothermic reaction between the elements. For crystal growth, the chemical transport was achieved by adding the appropriate amount of synthesized material together with the transport agent placed inside a quartz tube. The growth temperature was set as 820 °C (heating zone) → 680 °C (growth zone) with a gradient of −7 °C cm−1. The reaction produced single crystals after 288 h. After the growth period, the synthetic In2S3:Nb crystals formed essentially with a red color and possessed apparent crystalline surfaces. With increasing Nb content, the color changed from fresh red, red, to dark red in the undoped In2S3, In1.995S3:Nb0.005, and In1.99S3:Nb0.01, respectively. Electron probe microanalysis showed a slight chalcogen deficiency in the crystals. The stoichiometric composition for the crystals approximately matches the original stoichiometry within a reasonable standard error. For simplicity, the stoichiometry of the crystals is defined as the nominal composition of the starting material.
For X-ray measurements, several small crystals from each composition of the Nb-incorporated In2S3 were finely ground and the X-ray powder patterns were taken and recorded by means of a slow moving radiation detector. The copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) was employed in the X-ray diffraction measurements and a silicon standard was used for experimental calibration. The lattice constant of each Nb-incorporated In2S3 compound with reasonable standard error was determined by least-square fits of a tetragonal equation15 using Jandel SigmaPlot mathematical software.16
The TR experiments were carried out in the energy range of 1.25 to 2.4 eV. A 150 W tungsten halogen lamp filtered by a PTI 0.2 m monochromator provided the monochromatic light. A HUV2000B silicon photodiode was used for optical detection. The reflected light of the sample was detected by the HUV2000B photodiode and the signal was recorded via an EG&G model 7265 dual phase lock-in amplifier. For thermal perturbation of the sample, a quartz plate acted as the heat sink. The quartz plate was coated with a winding path of golden tracks for the heating element. The shape of the golden path was formed by a copper mask.17,18 The heating path consists of two wide tracks at the end sections and one narrow track lying in between them. The narrow track in the middle section is designed to act as the heat generation source when electrical current passes through the heater. The function of the wide track at the end sections is to speed up the heat dissipation when electrical power is off. Each thin sample of the Nb-incorporated In2S3 with a relevant as-grown face was closely attached on the narrow track of the Au path by silicone grease. Thermal modulations of the samples were achieved by the indirect heating manner of supplying current pulses to the Au heating element periodically. Heating pulses of low frequency and long duty cycle seem to be more efficient in the enhancement of spectral amplitude of the transition feature. Heat generation and dissipation from all the Au tracks and quartz substrate must be well balanced to avoid any increase of temperature in the sample (i.e. weak heating disturbance). A 4 Hz square wave with a duty cycle of 50% was employed in the TR experiments. An RMC model 22 closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a model 4075 digital thermometer controller facilitates the implementation of temperature-dependent measurements.
DC photoconductivity (PC) and photo–current–voltage (Photo I–V) measurements of the Nb-incorporated β-In2S3 were carried out using two different white-light sources as the solar emulator. One is the commercialized InGaN-based phosphorus white-light light emitting diode array (denoted as white LED) and the other is a tungsten halogen lamp (denoted halogen lamp). The white LED covered a wide spectral range from visible to IR with two hump peaks centered at ∼450 nm and ∼560 nm, respectively. The emission spectrum of the halogen lamp is a broadband blackbody radiation with a main hump peak located near ∼650 nm. The light intensity of the halogen lamp spectrum decays gradually from the hump peak toward the long wavelength region of IR. For sample preparation of the PC and Photo V–I measurements, each specimen of the Nb-incorporated In2S3 was cut and polished into a rectangular shape with dimensions of about 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.02 cm3. The two ends of each specimen were coated with Au/In as the ohmic-contact electrodes by sputtering. For optical measurements, the ohmic-contact electrodes on each sample were shielded with light. The average power densities for the white LED and halogen lamp were adjusted and maintained at about 5 mW cm−2via the monitoring of an OPHIR optical power meter equipped with a broadband high-sensitivity thermal sensor (0.15–6 μm). The Photo V–I measurement was performed via the auxiliary of a semiconductor parameter analyzer. The voltage scanning range was set at −30 to 30 V. The PC and Photo V–I measurements were carried out at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the Nb-incorporated indium sulfides of undoped In2S3, In2S3:Nb0.005, and In2S3:Nb0.01 in the angular range between 20° and 58°. Several peak features respectively indexed to the tetragonal (β) or cubic-like (α) phase for the as-grown In2S3:Nb are shown. The crystallography of In2S3 is naturally a defect semiconductor. Its crystalline state relates to a spinel lattice with the cation vacancies randomly located on either octahedral sites only or on both octahedral and tetrahedral sites.19 In general, the β-phase In2S320 possesses the same structure as that of α-In2S3 except that the cation vacancies of α-In2S3 are disordered in its lattice.11 The peak features of the Nb-incorporated In2S3 in Fig. 1 are hence designated with two different Miller indices for the β- and α- phases. As shown in Fig. 1, the peak positions in the X-ray pattern for the undoped In2S3 are quite similar to those of the previous β-phase In2S3 thin films obtained by different deposition methods.5,20 The X-ray peaks for each of the undoped In2S3, In2S3:Nb0.005, and In2S3:Nb0.01 also show comparable numbers and styles in Fig. 1. This result indicates that the three sulfide compounds are isostructural and possess the same crystalline phase β. For simplicity, they are hence denoted as undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. Observing in detail in Fig. 1, the peak position of each feature shows a slight shift to higher diffraction angles with respect to the increasing Nb content in the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01. The inset in Fig. 1 shows an enlarged viewing of the (1015)-β peak for clear inspection of the angle shift in the three samples. For a tetragonal lattice of β-In2S3:Nb, the substitution of In (atomic size ≈ 1.55 Å) by Nb (atomic size ≈ 1.45 Å) reduces the unit cell size and increases the diffracted angle in the higher Nb-incorporated indium sulfide compounds. As shown in Fig. 1, the interplanar distance dhkl for each of the β-In2S3:Nb samples can be calculated from some selective X-ray peaks. The lattice constants can be analyzed by a tetragonal equation of 1/dhkl2= (h2 + k2)/a2 + (l2/c2) using Jandel SigmaPlot mathematical software.16 The obtained values are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The lattice constants a and c show shrinkage with respect to the increase of the Nb content in the indium sulfides. This result is dissimilar to that of the Ag (atomic size ≈ 1.60 Å) doped In2S3,10 where the unit cell size is larger than that of undoped one. Also shown in Fig. 1, the relative intensity of each peak feature for the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 does not show a trend with different Nb content owing to the non-uniformity of particle size ground for the powder X-ray measurement in different composition batches of crystals. The similar X-ray patterns of Fig. 1 also verify the same structural phase with no preferred growth direction for the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 crystals.

Modulation spectroscopy such as thermoreflectance (TR) has been proven to be a very powerful tool for evaluation of optical transitions below and above the band edge.18,21 The derivative spectral line shape of the transition feature enhances the ability to determine the exact energy location in semiconductors. Shown in Fig. 2 are the temperature-dependent TR spectra of (a) β-In2S3:Nb0.01, (b) β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and (c) undoped β-In2S3 in the temperature range between 25 and 320 K. The dashed lines are the experimental data, and solid curves are least-square fits of the experimental data to a first derivative Lorentzian line-shape function appropriate for the transition features expressed as:22,23 (1)where i is the respective transition, Ai and ϕi are the amplitude and phase of the line shape, and Ei and Γi are energy and broadening parameter of the transitions in the Nb-doped β-In2S3. The fits yield transition energies indicated with arrows in Fig. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) and their variation traces (from 25 to 320 K) are indicated with dotted lines in each figure for comparison. There are only two transition features denoted as EVS and E0 that can be observed in undoped β-In2S3 in Fig. 2(c) while at least four transition features denoted as Ed(IB), EIB, EVS, and E0 can be detected in each of the Nb-incorporated compounds of β-In2S3:Nb0.01 and β-In2S3:Nb0.005 shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b). Two additional features of Ed(IB) and EIB are detected for β-In2S3:Nb0.01 and β-In2S3:Nb0.005 at each temperature. The features are even enhanced and more prominent at lower temperatures down to 25 K. This result indicates that Ed(IB) and EIB transitions are coming from a specific band existing in the band gap of β-In2S3:Nb0.01 and β-In2S3:Nb0.005, i.e. an intermediate band (IB) induced by Nb. Furthermore, the E0 and EVS features are simultaneously detected in the three samples of undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01. The E0 and EVS must be the original transitions occurring in both the Nb-doped and undoped β-In2S3. The β-In2S3 is a well-known defect semiconductor. The ordered modification of the β-In2S3 was a quasi-ternary compound consisting of In atoms, S atoms, and a lot of vacancies comprised in a unit cell.19 The E0 and EVS features in each compound in Fig. 2 are hence assigned to be the direct band gap and a defect transition originating from EV to the defect series states caused by S vacancies (VS). The Ed(IB) and EIB features are present only in the Nb-incorporated samples of β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01, which can be assigned as the transitions of In vacancies (VIn) → IB and EV → IB, respectively. The IB is inferred to be the deep-level center induced by Nb substitution in the β-In2S3. As shown in Fig. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), the temperature–energy shift of the E0 feature is faster than those of the other features from 25 to 320 K owing to its band-to-band character of the direct-gap transition. The variation traces for the temperature-dependent energy shift of EIB and EVS are comparable but slower than that of E0 in Fig. 2. This result verifies that EIB and EVS are coming from the valence band to an imperfection state existing in the band gap. Band-to-band transitions should be more sensitive to the thermal expansion of the lattice when the temperature is changed, while an imperfection state such as a defect or impurity is insensitive to the variation of temperatures. This result can be evident from the Ed(IB) transition shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), where the energy position of Ed(IB) is nearly invariant at a value of ∼1.42 eV from 25 to 320 K. The Ed(IB) feature is assigned to be a defect transition from In vacancies (VIn) to the intermediate band (IB) in the band gap. The TR results in Fig. 2 clearly show that the β-In2S3:Nb is an IB-related solar energy material and the TR measurements are sensitive to the detection of band-to-band and IB related transitions in In2S3. As shown in Fig. 2, the TR measurements at 320 K were also carried out to get more realistic energy values for the Ed(IB), EIB, EVS, and E0 transitions when β-In2S3:Nb is operated under sunshine at a temperature higher than 300 K.

The dashed lines are the experimental data and solid lines are the least-square fits to eqn (1). The obtained transition energies for Ed(IB), EIB, EVS, and E0 features are indicated by arrows. 

Fig. 3 shows the room-temperature TR spectra of undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. The dashed lines are experimental data and solid curves are the least square fits using eqn (1) with the obtained transition energies indicated by arrows. The values of Ed(IB) and EIB are 1.42 and 1.522 eV for β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and 1.42 eV and 1.511 eV for β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. The Ed(IB) and EIB transitions are caused by IB and are not detected in undoped β-In2S3. As shown in Fig. 3, the direct band gap E0 shows energy red-shift behavior with the increasing Nb content in the β-In2S3. The determined values of the band gap E0 are 1.935, 1.923, and 1.901 eV for the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. They correspond to the red-light portion of the crystal colors. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the thin-slab β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 crystals show fresh red, red to dark-red colors with the increasing Nb content. This result verifies the band-gap reduction behavior in the highly Nb-incorporated In2S3 compounds. The values of the band gaps of the β-In2S3:Nb samples are listed in Table 1 for comparison together with the lattice constants a and c. It is noticed that the lattice constant and band gap show simultaneous reduction with increasing Nb content in the β-In2S3. This situation is dissimilar to the behavior of general semiconductors such as Si and Ge which show a decreasing lattice constant but an increasing band gap. The reason why band-gap reduction occurred with decreasing lattice constants in β-In2S3:Nb is due to the electronic character of the small amount Nb [(Kr)4d45s1] that substitutes for the indium in the β-In2S3. The more stable phase of niobium sulfide is NbS2. The NbS2 crystallizes in a hexagonal layer structure with metallic electronic properties (i.e. no band gap).24 The incorporation of small amounts of Nb 0.5% and 1% in β-In2S3 therefore tends to render a redshift in band gap such as those found in Fig. 3. However, according to a previous theoretical study on Nb-doped MoS2, the MoS2 semiconductor will undergo a semiconductor-metal transition when the doping of Nb is up to 25%.25 It is not necessary to include too much Nb dopant in the β-In2S3:Nb in order to avoid such a semiconductor-metal transition in In2S3. However, the optimum content of Nb in the β-In2S3 needs to be further evaluated by studying a complete series of Nb-doped In2S3 crystals. Also shown in Fig. 3, the intensity of the TR spectra (ΔR/R) for the E0 feature in the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 increased with increasing Nb content in the β-In2S3. It is about fifteen times larger for β-In2S3:Nb0.01 with respect to that of the undoped β-In2S3. The enhanced amplitudes in β-In2S3:Nb can also be evident from the temperature-dependent TR spectra with different amplitude scales (Y-axis) shown in Fig. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c). This result verifies that the photon's absorption yield increases with increasing Nb content owing to the raising of the IB states and the reduction of the band gap in the high Nb-content β-In2S3 compounds.

Based on the experimental analyses of TR, a representative band scheme together with the defect states and intermediate band (IB) below the band edge of β-In2S3:Nb is proposed and depicted in Fig. 4. For the above band-edge portion of undoped β-In2S3, it is known that the defect nature of existing S vacancies in β-In2S3 allows it to easily form the surface oxidation state of β-In2S3−3xO3x on its surface.3,4 The β-In2S3−3xO3x may dominate the photoconduction range from 1.935 eV in In2S3 to above 3.0 eV in transparent In2O3.26,27 For the below-band-edge optical absorptions shown in Fig. 4, the energy value of Ed(IB) determined by TR was 1.42 eV for both β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01, which may come from the acceptor level VIn to IB. The values of EIB are 1.522 eV for β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and 1.511 eV for β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. The EIB is related to the electronic transition from valence band to IB. The values of EVS are about 1.833, 1.826, and 1.815 eV for undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 at 300 K. The photon's absorption by EVS is correlated with the electronic transition from the valence band to a series of defect states caused by sulfur vacancies (VS) that naturally exist inside the doped and undoped β-In2S3. The In 5s and S 2p orbitals mainly construct the conduction band and valence band of the β-In2S3.11 The 4d levels of the Nb substituent provide one or two states to the IB, leaving it partially occupied as expected. The photons' absorption yield in the red to NIR portion is therefore enhanced with increasing doping of Nb. The deep-level location of the IB band is determined to be ∼0.4 eV below the conduction band edge.

Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of transition energies of Ed(IB), EIB, EVS, and E0 features determined by the spectral analysis of the TR spectra displayed in Fig. 2. The solid lines are fitted to a Varshni empirical relationship Ei(T) = Ei(0) − αi·T2/(T + βi),28 where Ei(0) is the transition energy at 0 K, and αi and βi are constants referred to as Varshni coefficients. The constant αi is related to the electron–phonon interaction and βi is closely related to the Debye temperature. The values obtained for Ei(0), αi and βi for the E0, EVS, and EIB transitions of β-In2S3:Nb are listed in Table 2 together with the band gap E0 of the undoped β-In2S3 measured by optical absorption for comparison.13 The values of αi for the temperature-energy shift of EVS and EIB transitions are about one half of the value of the E0 transition. This result indicates a reasonable distinction between a transition from band to band and a transition from valence band to defect state. The band-to-band transition shows a much faster red shift than that of the defect transitions when the temperature is changed.

To evaluate the photoelectric conversion behavior of the IB related compounds, PC measurements of the β-In2S3:Nb using two different white-light sources of a white LED array and a halogen lamp were respectively carried out at 300 K. Fig. 6 shows the photo-resistivities measured from the photoconductors of undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01. The solid squares in Fig. 6 are the dark resistivity, and the hollow circles and hollow triangles are the photo-resistivities with the white LED and halogen lamp. The dark resistivities of the sulfides increase with increasing Nb content. The dark resistivity increases from ∼105 Ω cm for the undoped β-In2S3, ∼106 Ω cm for the β-In2S3:Nb0.005 to a high value of ∼1 × 107 Ω cm for the β-In2S3:Nb0.01 due to high-density available states of IB that result in a stronger deep-level trapping effect of the electron inside the β-In2S3:Nb (also see Fig. 4). The carrier conduction type of undoped β-In2S3 is weakly n type, verified by Hall-effect measurement because of the stronger contribution of sulfur vacancy donors. For the Nb-doped samples, the deep-level IB was formed and the density of sulfur vacancies decreased. The decrease in sulfur vacancies was evident from the reduction of the EVS amplitudes of β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 as compared to that of the undoped β-In2S3 shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Both the increase in IB states and the decrease in sulfur vacancies render the highest value of dark resistivity in the β-In2S3:Nb0.01. Also shown in Fig. 6, the white LED may dominate the illumination spectrum in the visible range of green to blue while the halogen lamp employs the emission in the visible to NIR range. The change in photo-resistivity by using the halogen lamp is larger than that for the white LED in both β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 The inset in Fig. 6 shows an enhanced change between the white LED and halogen lamp occurring in the heavily Nb doped sample of β-In2S3:Nb0.01, i.e. an improvement in photosensitivity in the NIR region.

In order to study the current–voltage characteristics of the IB related to β-In2S3:Nb, photo V–I measurements of a β-In2S3:Nb0.01 photoconductor were carried out at 300 K. Fig. 7 shows the photo V–I curves for the β-In2S3:Nb0.01 under different light sources' illuminations. The scanning voltage range is from −30 to 30 V. A nearly linear relationship for the V–I curves can be obtained. The solid lines are the least square fits of the V–I data to an expression of I = I0 + G·V, where G is the photoconductance (A V−1). The power densities of the white LED and halogen lamp were maintained at 5 mW cm−12. The obtained values of photoconductance are G = 7.1 × 10−8 (A V−1) with the halogen lamp, G = 1.2 × 10−8 (A V−1) with the white LED, and G = 1.4 × 10−9 (A V−1) under the dark conditions, respectively. It identifies that the enhanced photoelectric-conversion yield may occur in the visible–NIR region for the β-In2S3:Nb0.01 with the existing high-density intermediate band.

Conclusion
This paper characterizes a new IB induced solar-energy material β-In2S3:Nb using different techniques of X-ray diffraction, thermoreflectance, photoconductivity, and photo–voltage–current measurements. The lattice constants a and c for the tetragonal β-In2S3:Nb decreased with increasing Nb content in the sulfide compounds while the direct band gaps of the β-In2S3:Nb decrease with the increasing niobium content in the undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and β-In2S3:Nb0.01. The bandgap reduction in the higher Nb-doped In2S3 is due to the fact that the niobium sulfide is essentially metallic which contributes a little bit to the electronic state of the indium sulfide, lowering the band gap. The TR technique was shown to be sensitive for the detection of intermediate-band related transitions EIB and Ed(IB), they are especially enhanced in the low-temperature TR spectra. Based on the TR results, a representative band scheme for the multi-photon absorption in β-In2S3:Nb was thus constructed. The Nb induced IB was about 0.4 eV below the conduction band edge in β-In2S3. The IB state promotes the photons' absorption yield, increases photosensitivity and dark resistivity, as well as improving the photoelectric-conversion yield of β-In2S3 in the visible to NIR region.
