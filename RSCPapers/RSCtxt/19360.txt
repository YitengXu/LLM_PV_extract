    , Accepted 14th May 2018First published on 19th May 2018AbstractNanoscale surface engineering of electroactive architectures is of paramount importance in high-performance supercapacitor applications based on surface-controlled charge storage mechanisms. Herein, we exploit Co(OH)2 quantum dots (CoQDs) as a surface modifier and report a simple and effective strategy for anchoring CoQDs on ultrathin interlaced Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Impressively, the 2D/0D heterostructure of CoQD-interspersed Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (Ni(OH)2-CoQD) exhibits greatly enhanced capacitive behavior compared with pristine Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, exhibiting a higher capacitance (3244 F g−1vs. 2124 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2), superior rate capability and better cycling stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the accumulation of additional electrons and reduced adsorption energy of OH− at the Ni(OH)2-CoQD interphase, which are the primary reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance. An asymmetric full cell with Ni(OH)2-CoQD as the positive electrode has been fabricated, achieving a maximum energy density of 46 W h kg−1 at 141 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability, where 84.1% of the initial capacitance is retained over 5000 cycles. This work brings a new opportunity to pseudoactive electrode material design by employing semiconductive quantum dots for surface modification.
1. Introduction
In order to tackle the problem of global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels, much effort has been made to utilize renewable energy resources, such as solar,1,2 wind,3 thermal4 and mechanical energy.5–7 Due to the intermittent nature of these energy sources, it is essential to develop environmentally friendly and low-cost nanostructure-based energy storage devices.8,9 Supercapacitors have drawn remarkable attention in recent years due to their unambiguously advantageous properties, including high power density, fast charge/discharge rate and long lifespan. Of the two well-known types of supercapacitors, pseudocapacitors, employing an interfacial reversible faradaic reaction to store energy,8,10 deliver a much higher electrochemical capacitance and energy density than traditional carbon-based double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).
Transition metal oxides and hydroxides (NiO, Co3O4, Fe3O4, MnO2, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, and Fe(OH)3) are among the most promising pseudocapacitor electrode materials due to their various oxidation states, high electrochemical activity and natural abundance.11 However, the intrinsically poor electronic conductivity and slow ion transfer rates hinder the single metal oxides/hydroxides from achieving satisfactory performance. To tackle this problem, the construction of heterostructures with two different metal oxides/hydroxides has become a widely adopted method,12–15 which can take advantage of both components and offer unique properties through their reinforcement or modification of each other.16 However, in hybrid structure construction, a dense second outer-layer phase coating could hinder the redox reactions between the core material and electrolyte, as well as increase the total mass of active material considerably, impairing the full utilization of the electrochemical activity of the core phase and sometimes leading to a decrease in the gravimetric capacitance of the whole electrode. For example, Lin et al.13 synthesized a core–shell structure of ZnCo2O4 nanowires (NWs)@MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) on carbon cloth. After shell phase (MnO2 NSs) deposition, the gravimetric capacitance of the electrode dropped from the original 3500 F g−1 to 2571 F g−1, despite an increase in the areal capacitance (3.6 F cm−2vs. 2.1 F cm−2). What's more, it is usually quite tricky to control the heterogrowth process of a second phase because of structural mismatch. Meanwhile, the second phase deposition is often a time and energy consuming procedure.13,14,17,18
Quantum dots (QDs), with tunable size and unique physical and chemical properties, have always been a hot topic in fundamental research. So far, the application of QDs in pseudocapacitors has been focused on two primary directions. One is the use of conductive QDs (e.g. carbon QDs,9,19–23 graphene QDs24,25 and metal QDs8,26) mainly as a conductivity additive to the pseudoactive materials, forming a pseudoactive nanostructure/conductive QD composite; the other is the use of semiconductive QDs directly as the pseudoactive material,27,28 forming a thin mesoporous film on a conductive skeleton, such as graphene sheets (graphene nanosheets/semiconductive QD composite), to shorten the effective charge transport routes and achieve high specific capacitances. However, the decoration of a pseudoactive material such as Ni(OH)2 with semiconductive QDs, forming a pseudoactive nanostructure/semiconductive QD composite, has seldom been studied, especially considering surface modification from a theoretical view.
In this work, semiconductive CoQDs were anchored on Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (Ni(OH)2-CoQD) through a convenient room temperature (RT) dipping method. Compared to pristine Ni(OH)2, Ni(OH)2-CoQD exhibits a substantially higher specific capacitance (3244 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2), much enhanced rate capability and better cycling stability. First-principles calculations were carried out to elucidate the mechanism, where additional electrons transferring to the surface of the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets after CoQD decoration and the surface modification promoting the OH− absorption process are believed to be the determining factors for the capacitive performance enhancement of the hybrid. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated based on Ni(OH)2-CoQD, which delivers a high energy density of 46 W h kg−1 at 141 W kg−1, as well as long-term stability (84.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterization of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD composite and CoQDs

Fig. 1 depicts the preparation procedure of Ni(OH)2-CoQD. First, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were grown on Ni Foam (NF) through a facile hydrothermal procedure and CoQDs were fabricated following a facile method reported in the literature.27 The decoration of the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with the CoQDs, forming a Ni(OH)2-CoQD heterostructure, was accomplished by dipping the Ni(OH)2/NF into the CoQD suspension for 1 min under ultrasonication at RT. The Co(OH)2 QD deposition method developed in this study is much more convenient and energy efficient than the commonly reported nanosheet or nanoflake second phase growth procedures reported, such as hydrothermal methods29 and electrodeposition.30
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of Ni(OH)2-CoQD on NF. 
The morphologies of the as-synthesized samples were first characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As seen in Fig. 2a, the pristine Ni(OH)2 film on NF is mainly composed of interconnected sheet-like 2D structures with a thickness down to the nanoscale, the geometric architecture of which may be particularly favorable for supercapacitor electrode applications owing to the large surface area, high porosity and high exposure to electrolyte ions. After the decoration of CoQDs, the Ni(OH)2-CoQD composite film (Fig. 2b) well inherits the interlaced flaky morphology of the pure Ni(OH)2, where the CoQDs are invisible due to the ultrafine granularity of the CoQDs and the limited resolution of SEM.27 From the cross-sectional elemental maps, as shown in Fig. 2c, a uniform distribution of the Co signal is observed for the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet film. Importantly, the Co signal not only exists over the surface of the nanosheet film, but also spreads to the bottom of the nanosheet film, which indicates the effective decoration of the CoQDs upon the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets by using our simple ultrasonication-assisted dipping method.

Initially, we tried to use X-ray diffraction (XRD) to acquire structural information on the as-synthesized CoQDs, as well as the pristine and CoQD-decorated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. However, the XRD signals from the particulate CoQDs and Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are both too weak to show any discernible peaks (see Fig. S1†), which may be due to the limited amount and ultrafine grains of the CoQDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was then employed to acquire further morphology and composition information on the as-prepared samples.
CoQDs, with a grain size ranging from 3 nm to 6 nm, are observed in the TEM images for the powdered CoQD samples (Fig. 3a & Fig. S2,† at different magnifications). The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the CoQDs (Fig. 3a) shows the lattice fringes, with interplanar distances of 2.04 and 2.47 Å, in accordance with the lattice spacings of α-Co(OH)2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3a′) of the CoQDs displays rings corresponding to d-spacings of 2.8, 2.47, 2.1, 1.53 and 1.45 Å, which can be assigned to α-Co(OH)2 (JCPDS 02-0925).

A foldaway silk-like morphology with a high electron transparency is observed for both the pristine and CoQD-interspersed Ni(OH)2 sample in the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. S3a†), in agreement with the SEM observation. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b), lattice spacings of 2.08 and 2.39 Å, corresponding to the (103) and (300) planes of α-Ni(OH)2, are observed. The SAED pattern (Fig. 2b′) of the pristine nanosheets shows rings correlated to d-spacings of 2.41, 207 and 1.46 Å, which can be indexed to the (111), (103) and (300) planes of α-Ni(OH)2 (3Ni(OH)2·2H2O, JCPDS 22-0444), respectively.
The Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample exhibits a similar morphology to the pristine Ni(OH)2 sample in the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. S3b†), in accordance with the SEM observation. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c), Moiré fringes are observed (as circled with a white line), the sizes of which are similar to that of the CoQDs shown in Fig. 3a (as circled with a white line). It is well known that Moiré fringes can appear in the TEM image when there is overlapping of two crystals that have slightly different lattice spacings in the same orientation. The appearance of grain-like regions of Moiré fringes (Fig. 3c), in contrast to the pristine Ni(OH)2 sample where Moiré fringes are scarce, confirms the existence of CoQDs on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets for the Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample. Furthermore, the plane spacing of 2.48 Å observed in the HRTEM image of the Ni(OH)2-CoQDs (Fig. 3c) is ascribed to α-Co(OH)2. The plane spacing of 2.12 Å in Fig. 3c could correspond to either α-Co(OH)2 or α-Ni(OH)2 due to the similarity in such planes of the two phases. The SAED pattern of the Ni(OH)2-CoQDs (Fig. 3c′) is similar to that of the pristine Ni(OH)2, which is due to the fact that Ni(OH)2 exists as the main phase in the heterostructure and the amount of CoQDs is too small to generate a strong enough signal in the SAED pattern.
The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps in Fig. 3d unambiguously prove the coexistence of O, Ni and Co elements in the Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample. The homogeneous distribution of the Co element along with the Ni element indicates a uniform coating of CoQDs on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets.
The composition information of the samples was further examined by utilizing Raman characterization. The Raman spectrum of the QD powder in Fig. 4a is indicative of Co(OH)2.31–33 The intense peak at 679 cm−1 corresponds to the CoO (A1g) symmetric stretching mode and the other peaks at 473 and 512 cm−1 are attributed to the Eg and F2g mode of Co(OH)2, respectively.31,32 In the Raman spectra of Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2-CoQD on NF (Fig. 4b), the peaks centered at 472 and 1057 cm−1 are characteristic of α-Ni(OH)2,34,35 and can be attributed to the lattice mode (Ni–O) and second-order lattice mode, respectively.36 The peak at 981 cm−1 corresponds to sulphate anions that come from the nickel sulphate precursor and incorporate into the interlayer region of α-Ni(OH)2.36 By comparison of the Raman curves of Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2-CoQD in Fig. 4b, an additional peak at 526 cm−1 is observed for the hybrid sample, which can be attributed to the F2g mode of Co(OH)2. The disappearance of the peak corresponding to the A1g mode of Co(OH)2 in the hybrid sample (the Eg mode peak of Co(OH)2 might overlap with that of Ni(OH)2 here) is possibly due to the fact that the intensity of the peak at 680 cm−1 is significantly reduced at low cobalt concentrations according to the literature.37 The right shift of the F2g peak of Co(OH)2 in Ni(OH)2-CoQD compared to that of the Co(OH)2 powder might arise from the substrate effect, as reported in the literature.33,36

To further confirm the composition of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample, XPS measurement was employed (Fig. S6†). The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S6a†) demonstrates the coexistence of Ni, Co, O and C in the hybrid structure. In the Ni 2p region (Fig. S6b†), the sample exhibits spectra with two main peaks centered at 855.7 eV and 873.4 eV, characteristic of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 for Ni(OH)2.38,39 The existence of Co(OH)2 in the Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample can be certified by high resolution XPS analysis of Co 2p (Fig. S6c†), where the spectrum is deconvoluted into two major peaks at 797.2 and 781.7 eV, respectively, and two satellites at 786 and 802.8 eV, respectively, which are characteristic of Co2+ in Co(OH)2.40,41 The O 1s spectrum (Fig. S6d†) is composed of two peaks at 531.1 and 532.7 eV, corresponding to metal–hydroxyl binding (M–OH) and chemisorbed/structural water (H–O–H), respectively.42
2.2 Electrochemical performance of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode and mechanism analysis

2.2.1 Three-electrode configuration test. 
To evaluate the influence of CoQD decoration on the supercapacitor performance of the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, an electrochemical test with a three-electrode configuration was carried out for both the pristine Ni(OH)2 electrode and the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode. Fig. 5a displays a comparison of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Ni(OH)2 electrode and Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode tested in a potential window of 0–0.5 V at 5 mV s−1. A pair of well-defined redox peaks indicative of strong pseudocapacitive behavior is observed for both samples. The redox reaction occurring at the Ni(OH)2 electrode can be interpreted as eqn (1). In addition to the reversible conversion between Ni(II) and Ni(III) (eqn (1)), the conversion between different cobalt oxidation states also contributes to the charge storage of Ni(OH)2-CoQD (eqn (2) and (3)). The XPS characterization results of the charged Ni(OH)2-CoQD sample (see Fig. S7†) suggest that the oxidized phases are NiOOH and CoO4. Compared to the pristine Ni(OH)2 electrode, the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode exhibits an evidently larger CV curve area, indicative of a higher capacitance. The corresponding gravimetric (areal) capacitances are calculated to be 1589 F g−1 (1.99 F cm−2) for the pristine Ni(OH)2 electrode and 2506 F g−1 (3.63 F cm−2) for the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode, where a 57.7% increase in gravimetric capacitance and an 82.4% increase in areal capacitance are achieved for the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode. The huge capacitance increase derived from the decoration of CoQDs on Ni(OH)2 is of significant importance from the viewpoint of both applications and science. Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−(1) Co(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(2) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(3)

(f) Comparison of the Nyquist plots of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD and Ni(OH)2 electrodes. 
To confirm the strong CoQD decoration effect on the capacitance increment, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (Fig. 5b and c) at various current densities were further carried out for the Ni(OH)2 electrode and Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode. The charge/discharge plateaus observed for both electrodes associated with redox reactions further confirm the pseudocapacitive nature of the samples, as expected. The gravimetric capacitances of both samples as a function of current density are shown in Fig. 5d, the calculation of which is based on the following equation: C = (I × Δt)/(ΔV × m)(4)where C (F g−1) is the gravimetric capacitance, I (mA cm−2) is the discharging current density, Δt (s) is the total discharging time, ΔV (V) is the discharging potential range and m (g) is the mass loading of active material. In this paper, m is taken as the mass gain after the growth of the active material on the substrate.
Based on our computed results shown in Fig. 5d, the Ni(OH)2 electrode delivers gravimetric (areal) capacitances of 2124 (2.66), 1901 (2.38), 1662 (2.08), 1466 (1.83) and 1199 F g−1 (1.5 F cm−2) at current densities of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The gravimetric (areal) capacitances of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode are 3244 (4.7), 2928 (4.26), 2649 (3.84), 2434 (3.53) and 2047 F g−1 (2.97 F cm−2) at current densities of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. We noticed that the experimentally obtained high capacitance of 3244 F g−1 at a small current density of 5 mA cm−2 for the Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode exceeds the theoretical capacitance value of 2600–2700 F g−1 that is calculated based on eqn (1)–(3) and the ratio of Ni(OH)2 to CoQDs (estimated from the XPS characterization in Fig. S6† and the mass loadings in the Experimental section). This phenomenon of a higher experimental capacitance than the theoretical one for a pseudocapacitor has also been observed in quite a few other publications.43–48 Contributions from additional electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC)43–46,49 and oxidation of the NF substrate after hydrothermal reaction could both be reasons for the higher experimental capacitance than the theoretical one. Compared to pristine Ni(OH)2, Ni(OH)2-CoQD exhibits gravimetric (areal) capacitance increases of 54% (79%), 59.4% (84.6%), 66% (93%) and 70.7% (98%) at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The performance of the CoQDs is also investigated (deposited on NF using the same method as for decoration), but they only deliver an areal capacitance of 0.36 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. S4†). The above results give clear evidence that CoQD decoration on Ni(OH)2 greatly enhances the capacitance of the electrode material, which mainly originates from the synergistic effect of the two phases. Furthermore, we notice that the capacitance increase from Ni(OH)2-CoQD becomes greater at higher discharge currents, suggesting that the CoQD decoration also enhances the electrode's rate capability, which is beneficial for high power density applications.
The cycling stabilities of the two electrodes (Fig. 5e) were evaluated through galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at 15 mA cm−2 for 1000 cycles. A light capacitance increase process is observed for both samples within the first 200 cycles, attributed to an activation process. Then, both electrodes undergo a capacitance decay, which is mainly due to the phase change from the initial α-Ni(OH)2 to β-Ni(OH)2 as identified in our previous work.50 The Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode exhibits a better cycling stability, with 90.9% of the original capacitance retained after 1000 cycles, while that for the Ni(OH)2 electrode is only 82.7%. These results suggest that the incorporation of CoQDs into Ni(OH)2 strengthens the stability of the electrode structure as a whole.
EIS (Fig. 5f) was performed to provide further insight into the reaction kinetics of the electrodes. Both electrodes display a typical Nyquist impedance plot consisting of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region, where the intercept with the real axis (Z′) represents the internal resistance (composed of the electronic resistance of the electrode materials, the contact resistance at the interfaces, and the ionic resistance of the electrolyte), the semicircle illustrates the charge-transfer resistance and the slope line corresponds to the diffusion resistance.9 The major difference between the two electrodes lies in the charge-transfer resistance indicated by different semicircles sizes, which arises from the faradaic reactions on the grain surface of the active materials.51 The Ni(OH)2-CoQD electrode generates a much smaller semicircle compared to the Ni(OH)2 electrode, demonstrating that the QD modified electrode possesses a lower charge transfer resistance and faster charge storage kinetics,52,53 which helps to explain its higher capacitance, especially at high charge/discharge rates.


2.2.2 Theoretical calculation and mechanism analysis. 
Our experimental results show that the decoration of Co(OH)2 QDs plays a crucial role in the capacitive activity enhancement in the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. To further rationalize the experimental findings, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the adsorption free energy of OH− on the Ni(OH)2 surface. As a benchmark, we also calculated the OH− adsorption energy on the pristine Ni(OH)2 (110) surface with the decoration of CoQDs. The adsorption energies were calculated from DFT simulations based on: ΔEOH* = E(OH*) − E(*) − (EH2O − 1/2EH2)(5)where E(OH*), E(H*) and E(*) are the ground state energies of models with the adsorbed intermediates of OH* and the pristine surface or the CoQD-attached surface obtained from DFT calculations, respectively. EH2O and EH2 are the computed DFT energies of H2O and H2 molecules in the gas phase. For the adsorption energy calculations, corrections resulting from the zero point energy (ZPE) and entropy are considered in our study. Therefore, we can calculate the adsorption free energies based on the calculated adsorption energies using the following equation: ΔGads = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS(6)where T is the temperature and ΔS is the entropy change. It should be noted that we only considered the standard molar vibrational entropy at room temperature in our study. The correction values are shown in the ESI (Table S1†). The calculated adsorption free energies of OH− on the pristine and CoQD-adsorbed Ni(OH)2 (110) surface are shown in Fig. 6a. We find that the OH− adsorption free energy is 1.03 eV on the pristine Ni(OH)2 (110) surface, and the adsorption free energy decreases to 0.78 eV when the surface is partially covered by CoQDs. The reduced adsorption energy of OH− may arise from the charge transfer between the CoQDs and Ni(OH)2 (110) surface, as shown in Fig. 6a.

(b) The isosurfaces of the charge density difference for the CoQD-attached Ni(OH)2 (110) surface. (c) The total and partial density of states of the CoQD-attached Ni(OH)2 (110) surface (only the spin-up results are shown in this figure). The isosurface is taken as 0.001 e Å−3. The yellow (purple) shows charge depletion (accumulation). The light pink, red, light blue, and blue balls represent H, O, Ni, and Co atoms, respectively. 
We further calculated electrical properties to obtain fundamental insight into the mechanisms responsible for the reduced adsorption free energy of OH− on the Ni(OH)2 surface with CoQDs attached. The charge transfer between the CoQDs and Ni(OH)2 (111) surface was investigated by using the Bader charge method. The Bader charge results show that the CoQDs lost 0.495 electrons, while Ni(OH)2 gains 0.495 electrons, which reveals that each CoQD would transfer 0.495 electrons to Ni(OH)2 (Table S2†). Therefore, a total of 0.495 electrons are injected into the Ni(OH)2 from the CoQDs based on our calculated Bader charge. The results show that Ni(OH)2 would gain additional electrons from the attached CoQDs, and the additional electrons may enhance OH− adsorption and further improve the capacitive performance.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the electrical properties of the CoQD-covered Ni(OH)2 (110) surface and the reduction of the OH− adsorption free energy, we further calculated the charge density difference for the CoQD-attached Ni(OH)2 (110) surface using the formula Δρ = ρQDs+surface − (ρQDs + ρsurface), where ρQDs+surface, ρQDs and ρsurface represent the charge density of the CoQD-adsorbed surface, QDs and pristine surface, respectively. Our computed results are shown in Fig. 6b, in which the yellow and purple show charge depletion and accumulation, corresponding to anti-bonding and bonding states, respectively. Based on our DFT results, it can be seen that more electrons would be accumulated between the interface of the CoQDs and the Ni(OH)2 (110) surface. The results show that the attached CoQDs would donate electrons to the Ni(OH)2 (110) surface, which is consistent with the Bader charge results. The calculated total and partial density states as shown in Fig. 6c reveal that Co 3d orbitals, denoted with blue lines, contribute to the conduction band maximum (CBM), and lead to the enhancement of the density of states near the Fermi level, which facilitates OH binding. Based on our calculated density difference as shown in Fig. 6a and the Bader charge analysis, we consider that Co atoms from the CoQDs primarily provide the additional electrons to the Ni(OH)2 slab. It is concluded that the reduction adsorption free energy of OH− is due to the modified electrical properties of the Ni(OH)2 (110) surface and the additional electrons donated by the attached CoQDs.
Based on the results mentioned above, we consider that the decoration of CoQDs upon the surface of Ni(OH)2 effectively enhances the capacitive performances of Ni(OH)2 in terms of both the areal capacitance and the gravimetric capacitance, especially at high charging/discharging rates. The enhancement of the capacitive performances can be mainly credited to the hetero-interfacial effect between the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and CoQDs. First, the addition of CoQDs to the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets contributes extra charges to the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet surface, boosting the fast charge migration and benefiting the redox reaction kinetics. Second, the surface modification with the incorporation of CoQDs enables reduced OH− absorption free energy, resulting in a more favorable redox reaction on the surface of the heterostructure electrode. What's more, in the advanced hybrid architecture of Ni(OH)2-CoQD, the outer layer CoQDs are ultra-small in size, providing the Ni(OH)2 core with sufficient exposure to the electrolyte, and thus making efficient utilization of the electrochemical activity of the Ni(OH)2 phase possible.

2.3 Asymmetric supercapacitor application
To evaluate the as-prepared Ni(OH)2-CoQD material for practical applications, a two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) prototype was fabricated by using Ni(OH)2-CoQD as the positive electrode and RGO as the negative electrode (Ni(OH)2-CoQD//RGO ASC). Fig. 7a exhibits the CV curves of the ASC at various scan rates between 0 and 1.45 V. The redox peaks from the CV curves indicate the pseudocapacitance contribution from the positive electrode. No obvious distortion of the CV curves with increased scan rates is observed, demonstrating the fast charge/discharge characteristic of the ASC.9 The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves acquired at various current densities are illustrated in Fig. 7b. The small IR drop even at high current densities reveals the low internal resistance of the ASC.41 The specific capacitances of the ASC at various current densities were calculated, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 7c. From Fig. 7c, we can see that the capacitance is as high as 171 F g−1 at a small current density of 2 mA cm−2. At high current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm−2, the capacitances can still remain at high values of 111 and 80 F g−1, respectively, indicating a superior rate capability. The capacitance decreases with an increase in current density may stem from an incomplete redox reaction due to the inaccessibility of part of the electrodes at high rates. The long-term cycling stability of the as-prepared ASC prototype was evaluated by repeating the charge–discharge tests at 10 mA cm−2 for 5000 cycles. As displayed in Fig. 7d, an apparent capacitance decay is observed for the ASC during the first 500 cycles, which is possibly due to the phase transformation of Ni(OH)2 from α-Ni(OH)2 to β-Ni(OH)2.50 After 500 cycles, the capacitance of the ASC stabilizes and the capacitance retains about 84.1% of the initial capacitance. What is more, a high coulombic efficiency of 96.7% can be derived from the almost symmetric charge/discharge curves approaching 5000 cycles (see the inset of Fig. 7d). Such results show that the Ni(OH)2-CoQD//RGO ASC possesses a high electrochemical reversibility and good cycling stability.

(c) The corresponding specific capacitances of the Ni(OH)2-Cu//RGO ASC as a function of current density. (d) Cycling performance of the Ni(OH)2-CoQD//RGO ASC at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 5000 cycles (the inset is the charge/discharge curves for the last 7 cycles). 
Power density and energy density are important parameters to characterize the performance and predict the application of a supercapacitor. The specific energy density and power density are calculated using the equations below: (7) P = (E·3600)/Δt(8)where E (W h kg−1) is the energy density, I (A) is the discharge current, V(t) (V) is the potential, dt (s) is the time differential, m (kg) is the mass loading of active material, P (W kg−1) is the power density and Δt (s) is the discharge time. The ASC delivers an energy density of 46 W h kg−1 at a power density of 141 W kg−1, and the energy density remains at 20.6 W h kg−1 when the power density is further increased to 3443.8 W kg−1. The decreasing trend of the energy density with increasing power is possibly due to insufficient faradaic redox reaction at higher currents as a result of inadequate time for the electrolyte to diffuse into the inner pores of the electrode material and the increase in IR drop, which is proportional to the discharge current.54–57 The results shown in Fig. 8 suggest that the Ni(OH)2-CoQD//RGO ASC demonstrated in this work outperforms most recently reported full cell devices based on conductive QD decoration, as well as heterostructures composed of two metal oxides or hydroxides, such as Ag QD-embedded Co3O4//activated carbon (AC),8 CQD-decorated NiCo2O4//hierarchical porous carbon (HPC),9 TiO2@MnO2-C//AC,58 Co3O4@MnO2//AC,59 FeCo2O4@MnO2//FeCo2O4@MnO2,60 and Co–Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@NiO//AC.61

3. Conclusions
In summary, a simple strategy has been demonstrated for fabricating integrated hybrid architectures of CoQDs anchored on ultrathin interlaced Ni(OH)2. DFT calculations indicate that additional electrons accumulate at the 2D/0D heterostructure interphase and the OH− absorption free energy decreases. Benefiting from the surface modification effect from the attachment of CoQDs, Ni(OH)2-CoQD delivers significantly higher specific capacitances, superior rate capability and better cycling stability compared to Ni(OH)2. The ASC assembled with Ni(OH)2-CoQD and RGO exhibits a high energy density of 46 W h kg−1 at a power density of 141 W kg−1, and a good long-term cycling stability (84.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Our results in this study not only illustrate the enormous potential of the as-fabricated Ni(OH)2-CoQD composite in high-performance supercapacitor applications, but also open new pathways for heterostructure pseudocapacitor electrode design with decoration of semiconductive hydroxide/oxide QDs.
