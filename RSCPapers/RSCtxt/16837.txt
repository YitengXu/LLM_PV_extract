    , Accepted 20th February 2017First published on 20th February 2017AbstractThere is an urgent need but it is still a huge challenge to integrate high energy and power density with high safety in a single energy storage device. Addressing this issue largely depends on design of new energy storage systems with novel electrode architectures. Herein, a novel electrochemical energy storage device called a quasi-solid-state Na-ion capacitor (QSS-NIC) is designed based on a 3D self-supported Na2Ti3O7 nanoribbon array/graphene foam (NTO/GF) anode and graphene foam (GF) cathode, and a Na-ion conducting gel polymer as the electrolyte and separator, without any binders, conducting additives or metal current collectors. Benefiting from the unique 3D self-supported cathode and anode, the GF//NTO/GF configuration achieves a high energy density of 70.6 W h kg−1 and high power density of 4000 W kg−1 on the basis of the mass of both electrodes, and a prominent cycling stability over 5000 cycles (capacitance retention ∼73.2%). This work successfully demonstrates a proof of concept of QSS-NIC as a high performance energy storage device based on two self-supported electrodes, which could provide a feasible approach to bridge the performance gap between capacitors and Na-ion batteries.
Introduction
Owing to the excessive consumption of non-renewable resources and global warming threats, there is a desperate need for a breakthrough in conventional secondary battery and/or supercapacitor (SC) science and technology to meet the future needs of a sustainable energy and low-carbon economy.1,2 Supercapacitors are being considered as a viable solution for hybrid electric vehicles and high-efficiency energy storage systems for sustainable energy, such as solar and wind energy, owing to their rapid charge/discharge property and long lifetime. Nevertheless, they store charge only through the surface reactions of electro-active materials, which significantly limits the energy density of supercapacitors.3,4 Alternatively, secondary batteries, specifically Li-ion batteries (LIBs), can provide much larger energy density through cation insertion reactions. However, the insertion/de-insertion within the crystalline framework of electro-active materials is controlled by the bulk diffusion, which restricts the power density and cycle life.5,6 As a result, various efforts have been made to develop advanced energy storage devices, combining the complementary features of excellent energy–power characteristics and long lifetime.7–9
Li-ion capacitors (LICs) have attracted enormous research interest owing to their high energy and high power since their first introduction by Amatucci et al. in 2001.10 LICs couple two different energy storage mechanisms in a single configuration, wherein the non-faradaic capacitor-type cathode endures fast charge–discharge reactions, and the faradaic Li-insertion anode stores large charges.11,12 The trade-off between the SCs and LIBs of LICs provides a practicable strategy to satisfy the needs of high-efficiency power systems. Yet for all that, the rapid consumption of Li resources driven by the tremendous demand in electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage may eventually render Li resources unaffordable since Li reserves are limited and its distribution is geopolitically restricted. Accordingly, pursuing sustainable energy storage devices, such as replacing Li with Na to construct analogous Na-ion capacitors (NICs), is becoming increasingly important. In the past several years, the technologies of NICs have gained great advances.13,14 As is well-known, for this hybrid energy storage device, the Na+ insertion/de-insertion process in the bulk of the anodes is more sluggish than the anion adsorption/desorption mechanism on the surface of the cathodes. Therefore, the main challenge to fabricate NICs is to engineer and integrate reliable electrode materials, especially the anode materials, with excellent rates and superb long-term cyclability.15
As a promising intercalation-type material, layered sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7, NTO) has been investigated as an attractive candidate anode material owing to its low cost, low toxicity, and low Na-intercalation potential.16 Nevertheless, the NTO suffers from sluggish Na intercalation kinetics owing to low electronic conductivity, which drastically hinders its application in NICs.13 Various efforts have been focused on avoiding the above drawback of NTO to date. The most commonly used approaches are reducing the electro-active material to nano-size, coating conductive layers and doping with appropriate elements.16,17 The low-dimensional nano-materials are very effective in enhancing power capability as they tremendously shorten the transport pathway for electrons and ions. In this context, various types of NTO nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanorods, microspheres, and the formation of nano-composites with carbon, have been designed and their electrochemical performance has been investigated.17–19 Unfortunately, the common slurry-coating technique needs to be mixed with a conductive agent and polymeric binder, and further pressed on the metal current collector. These assembly processes are complex and inevitably sacrifice the energy and power density of the device.20 Actually, the ideal electrode architecture for a high-efficiency power device consisting of a 3D highly conductive network coated with nano-sized electro-active material would provide efficient electron and ion transport pathways.21,22 For example, Li et al. developed a high-performance NIC configuration, utilizing self-supported niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) nanosheets and peanut shell-derived carbon as the anode and cathode electro-active materials in a 1 mol L−1 ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte.23 The NIC configuration exhibited a high energy density of 43.2 W h kg−1 and high power density of 5760 W kg−1, and a long cycle life of over 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of ∼80%. Nevertheless, the inherent disadvantages of organic-liquid electrolytes for NIC easily lead to concerns about safety issues owing to their volatility, flammability, environmental pollution, and hazards from leakage. In this regard, a feasible solution to avoid these severe risks is constructing solid-state energy storage devices using solid-state or quasi-solid-state electrolytes.24 However, to the best of our knowledge, few reports are available on solid-state or quasi-solid-state NIC.
Herein, we construct a quasi-solid-state NIC by integration of 3D self-supported electrodes of Na2Ti3O7 nanoribbon array/graphene foam (NTO/GF) as the Na-insertion anode with graphene foam (GF) as the capacitor-style cathode. An Na-ion conducting gel co-polymer using the poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoro propylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) film as the matrix was employed as the electrolyte and separator. The advanced 3D self-supported electrode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability and enhanced cycling performance. The fabricated NIC integrated the advantages of both SCs and Na-ion batteries (NIBs), pushing the power density, energy density and safety to new levels.
Experimental section
Synthesis of self-supported graphene foam (GF)
The preparation of GF is based on the literature reported by Tang's group with minor modifications.25 Typically, a piece of cleaned Ni foam was dipped into graphene oxide (GO) dispersion liquid (5 mg mL−1) and centrifuged for 15 min at 500 rpm, and then dried under vacuum at room temperature to remove the water. This process was repeated several times to increase the GO loading mass. After that, the GO@Ni foam was transferred to hydroiodic acid solution (HI, 45%) for 2 hours at room temperature and then held at 100 °C for 70 min, washed with large amounts of distilled water until a pH value of 7, and then dried under vacuum at room temperature. The mass of the GF can be controlled by the number of repeats.
Synthesis of Na2Ti3O7 nanoribbon array/graphene foam (NTO/GF)
A mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.83 g), 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 0.43 mL), titanium tetraisopropoxide [Ti-(OC3H7)4, TIP] (0.22 mL) and distilled water (20 mL) was stirred for 1 h. A piece of GF was immersed in the above solution, which was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) at 140 °C for 18 h. After hydrothermal growth, the NTO/GF precursor was washed with a large amount of distilled water and ethanol until the pH reached 8. After being dried at 60 °C, the as-prepared sample was calcined at 400 °C for 5 h in Ar gas to get well-defined NTO nanoribbons on GF. Typically, 1.2 mg of NTO nanoribbons is grown per 1 cm2 of GF (about 70 wt% of NTO in NTO/GF). The reference NTO powder was prepared under the same conditions except without the addition of GF. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effects of hydrothermal time on the structures of the as-prepared self-supported electrodes, other samples were prepared under the same conditions, except the hydrothermal time.
Synthesis of P(VDF-HFP) membrane
The method of synthesis for the P(VDF-HFP) membrane is based on Wu's previous work with minor modifications.24 Briefly, P(VDF–HFP) was dissolved into a mixture of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and distilled water with a weight ratio of 15:85:3 at 80 °C. After that, the sol-like solution was transferred onto a glass sheet, and then immersed in a water bath at 80 °C, yielding a homogeneous white membrane. Then the white membrane was dried under vacuum overnight at 100 °C.
Materials characterization
The crystal structures of the obtained samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 advance) with Cu Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The micro-morphologies were measured by employing field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). Thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimeter (TG/DSC) analysis was carried out on a NETZSCH (STA 409 PC) thermal analyzer under air atmosphere at a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI 550 spectrometer with Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The surface area was characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K on an ASAP-2020 surface area analyzer. Raman spectra were collected using a Jobin Yvon JY HR800 Raman spectrometer with an argon ion laser (514.5 nm).
Electrochemical measurement
All the half-cell tests were carried out in CR2032-type coin cells and used Na foils as the counter electrodes. The free-standing NTO/GF and GF were directly used as the working electrodes without metal foil current collectors or any ancillary additives. The reference NTO electrode was prepared by mixing urchin-like NTO power, acetylene black (AB) and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and then casting the slurry on Al foil. After that, the electrode was dried under vacuum at 110 °C overnight. All the cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (Mikrouna, O2, H2O < 0.1 ppm) with sodium ion conducting gel polymers as the electrolyte. All the charge/discharge measurements were performed at various current densities at room temperature.
The Na-ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte was prepared by soaking P(VDF-HFP) membrane in an organic electrolyte (1 mol L−1 NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC = 1:1, vol/vol) as an electrolyte additive) for 12 h in an Ar-filled glove box.
For the half-cell, the current densities and capacities were calculated based on the whole anode or cathode (for the NTO reference electrode, these values were calculated based on the active material). For the NIC, the current densities and capacities were normalized by the total mass of both electrodes. The optimized mass ratio between the NTO/GF anode and GF cathode in the NIC configuration is 1:2.2.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural analysis
A simple graphical sketch of the assembly processes and the resulting self-supported electrodes designed in this work is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the well-defined NTO nanoribbon precursors can be easily grown on the graphene skeletons by one-pot hydrothermal technology. After a short annealing treatment in 400 °C, NTO nanoribbon arrays are successfully well-anchored on the graphene skeletons. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows a digital photograph of GF and NTO/GF. For comparison, nanoribbon self-assembled urchin-like microspheres with an average diameter of about 2 μm are prepared under similar synthesis conditions except for the absence of the GF template.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of Na2Ti3O7 nanoribbon array/graphene foam electrodes. 
Before detecting the electrochemical properties of Na-ion storage, the as-prepared specimen was first characterized by SEM. From Fig. S2a and b (ESI†), we can find that the graphene foam has a 3D netlike structure with crimped surface, which is conducive to increasing the surface area, accelerating the penetration of electrolyte, preventing the stacking of graphene sheets and promoting the growth of NTO. The low-magnification SEM image of NTO/GF can be found in Fig. S2c and d (ESI†) and 2a, which clearly demonstrates the well-organized network structure of the NTO grown on GF to form a large-scale conformal coating. The SEM image in Fig. S3† demonstrates that NTO/GF consists of crimped NTO nanoribbons on a graphene surface. Fig. 2b is a typical high-magnification SEM image of NTO nanoribbons grown on GF through simple one-pot hydrothermal process. The carbon network is completely coated by ultrathin NTO nanoribbons on its surface. Crimped nanoribbon-like NTO uniformly anchor on the carbon microfiber with random orientation to shape NTO nanoribbon array/GF composites. This unique structure could promote the infiltration of the electrolyte and the transmission of Na-ions/electrons, which may be conducive to the improvement of Na-ion storage performance. Typically, NTO nanoribbons have uniform length up to about 1 μm, width of about 100 nm and thickness of several nanometers. Moreover, we also investigated the effects of hydrothermal time on the structures of the as-prepared self-supported electrodes. If the hydrothermal time is reduced by half (9 h), the surface of the GF will partially grow on the NTO (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Conversely, if the time is doubled (36 h), the NTO will overgrow on the surface of GF, which will reduce the adhesion of the NTO to the graphene (Fig. S4b, ESI†). For comparison, only nanoribbon self-assembled urchin-like microspheres with an average diameter of about 2 μm will be formed under similar synthesis conditions except for the absence of the GF template (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†). Then TEM was employed to further elucidate the micro-morphology and structure of the NTO nanoribbons. Fig. 2c shows the low-magnification TEM image of NTO nanoribbon array/graphene foam, which clearly reveals crimped nanoribbons directly grown on the graphene surface. This unparalleled structure characteristic could promote the permeation of the electrolyte and the transfer of Na-ions/electrons, which may be conducive to the enrichment of Na-ion storage. The lattice spacing of 0.84 nm was observed in Fig. 3d, in good agreement with the (001) plane spacing of the NTO. Fig. S5† shows the SEM images of the P(VDF-HFP) membrane, which is the matrix of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte before gelling. There are abundant pores in the membrane with diameter of about 2 μm, which is beneficial to absorb and retain the organic electrolyte.

In order to determine the crystallographic structures of the different as-prepared products, XRD was employed. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, all of the diffraction peaks of the urchin-like microspheres could be well-indexed to the monoclinic Na2Ti3O7 (JCPDS card no. 31-1329).18,26 The weak and broad peaks imply that the crystallite size of the as-prepared specimen is small. The XRD pattern of Ni–GO displays typical metal nickel reflections at 2θ of about 44.5°, 51.9° and 76.5° (Fig. S6a, ESI†).27 After the treatment by hydroiodic acid (HI), the interlayer distance of the GF is decreased to 3.81 Å (2θ = 23.3°) from 8.75 Å (2θ = 10.1°) for the original GO (Fig. S6a inset and b, ESI†), and metal nickel reflections are not detected. Except for the reflections owning to GFs, all diffraction peaks in Fig. 2b could be well-indexed to NTO. The Raman spectra were further used for examining the ordered and disordered crystal structures of the GF. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the D and G bands occur at 1363 and 1589 cm−1 for GO. After the HI acid treatment, the intensity of the D band (at 1353 cm−1) is obviously increased, the G band shifts to 1581 cm−1, and the ID/IG intensity ratios increased obviously, implying the existence of more defects/disorders in the graphene sheet. The intensity of the 2D peaks (∼2689 cm−1) is obviously increased, suggesting the restoration of sp2 carbon in the GF.28,29 The surface chemical bonding state of the NTO/GF was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS survey spectra of NTO/GF are shown in Fig. S8a.† Fig. S8b–d† illustrate the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively. The Ti 2p doublets (Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2) at 464.8 and 459.0 eV are observed clearly, confirming that the main species is Ti(IV) in the NTO/GF.30 The peaks that occur at 289.2, 287.5, 285.9 and 284.8 eV (Fig. S8c†) are associated with the carbon species from grapheme or the atmosphere. Besides, the strong peak at 283.5 eV suggests the existence of C–O–Ti bonds in the NTO/GF, which is also revealed by the O 1s peak at 530.7 eV for C–O–Ti bonds.31 In a word, the above results demonstrate the existence of the chemical bonds between the graphene and NTO nanoribbons. As determined by N2 adsorption–desorption tests (shown in Fig. S9†), the prepared GF, NTO and NTO/GF possess high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of 206.7, 89.6 and 121.3 m2 g−1, respectively. The weight fraction of NTO in the NTO/GF was determined by TG/DSC, with the results shown in Fig. S10.† The as-prepared sample shows a large weight loss at about 400 °C, which is attributed to the combustion of the GF. After reaching 700 °C, the NTO/GF shows a total weight loss of about 29 wt%. The results indicate that the novel electrode is composed of about 71 wt% NTO.
Na-ion battery performance
The Na-ion storage performance of NTO nanoribbon array/GF as a self-supported anode was evaluated using a CR2032-type coin cell, and the results were compared with an urchin-like NTO electrode prepared by the common slurry-coating technique. The galvanostatic discharge/charge voltage curves are exhibited in Fig. 4a and b at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with the voltage window of 0.01 to 2.5 V (vs. Na/Na+). For the additive-enriched NTO electrode, the first discharge and charge capacities are 345.2 and 202.6 mA h g−1, respectively (only based on the mass of the active material, the same as below). By comparison, the discharge capacity of the self-supported NTO/GF electrode is comparable to that of the NTO electrode even based on the mass of the whole electrode (the same as below) at a current density of 100 mA g−1, demonstrating significant enhancement of the Na-ion storage property of NTO by the introduction of GF (Fig. 4b). For example, the initial discharge capacity is 401.7 mA h g−1 with a Coulomb efficiency of 50.1%. The low Coulomb efficiency is mainly owing to the irreversible interfacial reaction between the electrode and the electrolyte, leading to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Besides, Na-ion storage in GF is also impressive with a large capacity of about 100 mA h g−1 and admirable cycle stability (Fig. S11†). More importantly, the rate capability of the whole NTO/GF electrode is better than that of NTO (only based on active material). Fig. 4c exhibits the rate capabilities of the two different types of electrode structures at various current densities. The discharge capacities of the NTO electrode decrease significantly from 200 to 4000 mA g−1, whereas the whole NTO/GF electrode decreases much more slowly at the same rate range. It is very noteworthy that the discharge capacity of the self-supported NTO/GF electrode is over three times higher than that for the additive-enriched NTO electrode at the ultrahigh current density of 4000 mA g−1. Moreover, the NTO/GF electrode possesses better cyclic performance than the NTO electrode. Fig. 4d displays the discharge capacity vs. cycle number at 2000 mA g−1. After 2000 cycles, the discharge capacity of the NTO electrode is only about 50.6 mA h g−1 with 45.9% capacity loss. But for the NTO/GFs electrode, the corresponding values are 98.8 mA h g−1 and only 22.8% (corresponding to a very low capacity fading rate of about 0.0114% per cycle), respectively, indicating that the self-supported 3D electrode structure enhanced Na-ion storage capacity effectively and improved diffusion kinetics.

Na-ion capacitor performance
A QSS-NIC is designed based on the NTO/GF as a self-supported anode and GF as a self-supported cathode using an Na-ion conducting gel polymer as the electrolyte, without metal current collectors, conducting additive or binders (Fig. 5a). Before fabricating the NIC, we also tested the electrochemical property of the GF with a voltage window of 2.5–4.2 V (vs. Na/Na+) at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. A typical galvanostatic charge–discharge curve is shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†) with a high discharge capacity of ∼64.3 mA h g−1. The linear variation between voltage and capacity suggests the reversible adsorption/desorption behavior of ClO4− with the electrode/electrolyte interface. In addition, the discharge capacity does not obviously decay during long-term cycles with high coulombic efficiency of about 100% (Fig. S12b, ESI†).

(b) Galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of NIC at various current densities. (c) Long-term cycle property at 0.5 A g−1. (d) Ragone plots based on the total mass of both electrodes. 
As shown in Fig. 5b–d, the electrochemical performance of QSS-NIC was further investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements with a voltage window between 1.0 and 3.0 V at various current densities from 0.05 to 2 A g−1 (based on both the GF electrode and the NTO/GF anode). Typical charge–discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 5b, delivering non-linear triangular curves, unlike the EDLCs, because they experience the battery-type Na-ion intercalation in the anode. This phenomenon validates that the energy storage in the hybrid NIC system combines the battery-type and capacitor-type mechanisms, simultaneously. Additionally, the tiny IR drops demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity, which is owing to the perfectly conductive networks engaged in both the self-supported cathode (GF electrode) and anode (NTO/GF electrode). Moreover, the QSS-NIC shows superb long-term cyclability over 5000 cycles (capacitance retention of 73.2%) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 5c). This cycling stability even outperforms many conventional NICs in terms of stability, such as Na2Fe2(SO4)3//Ti2CTx (83% after only 100 cycles),32 HC//V2CTx (70% after 300 cycles),33 AC//V2O5/CNT (80% after 900 cycles),34 and AC//Na-TNT (80% after 1000 cycles).26
For the sake of evaluating the practical properties of the QSS-NIC configuration, a typical Ragone plot (Fig. 5d) is presented from the galvanostatic tests in Fig. 5b. The specific energy densities (E, W h kg−1) and specific power densities (P, W kg−1) of the NIC device can be evaluated as follows:35,36 (1) P = E/Δt(2) Δt = t2 − t1(3)where I is the current density based on the total mass in both electrodes (A g−1), t1 and t2 are the start and end times during the discharge process (h), respectively, and V is the voltage (V). The Ragone plot demonstrates that the GF//NTO/GF configuration delivers high energy density and power density among the similar energy storage devices. The excellent energy density of this QSS-NIC is about 70.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 100 W kg−1. Even at an ultrahigh power density of 4000 W kg−1, the GF//NTO/GF still delivers an impressive energy density of about 28.2 W h kg−1. We also compared this QSS-NIC with other conventional NICs and LICs in liquid electrolytes and the results are exhibited in Fig. 5d. Clearly, this novel GF//NTO/GF configuration is superior to those of conventional NICs and LICs in terms of energy/power characteristics, such as AC//Na-TNT,26 AC//V2O5/CNT,34 graphite//Na-TNT,37 AC//LTO,38 AC/CNT//CNT-threaded TiO2.39
The impressive energy and power characteristics of the designed QSS-NIC can be ascribed to the following points. For conventional binder-enriched electrode, it fails to provide efficient electron transfer and increase additional undesirable interparticle resistance. The unique 3D self-supported NTO/GF electrode architecture consists of crimped NTO nanoribbons directly grown onto a highly conductive 3D carbon foam (current collector), which ensures every NTO nanoribbon partakes in the fast electrochemical reaction. The highly electronic conductive 3D carbon networks provide an expressway for charge transmission. The loose-porous carbon networks and open spaces expose more active material to the electrolyte, which promotes the fast diffusion of Na-ions. The nano-sized active materials shorten the diffusion pathways of electrons and Na-ions, avoiding the use of any inactive agent in this unparalleled electrode architecture. Regarding the GF cathode, the 3D porous-netlike structure with crimped surface can increase the surface area, prevent the stacking of graphene sheets and accelerate the penetration of the electrolyte, which delivers both enhanced energy density and excellent rate capability. In addition, for the quasi-solid-state Na-ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte, this electrolyte has less resistance than that of a liquid electrolyte with glass fiber separator,40 and avoids the severe risks of flammability, environmental pollution, and leakage. All of these characteristics ensure the efficient transmission of electrons and Na-ions into and out of the 3D-self-supported electrode structure, enabling high safety, terrific energy density, rate performance and long-term cyclability.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed a novel self-supported NIC by integration of a self-supported NTO/GF anode and a GF cathode using an Na-ion conducting gel polymer as electrolyte, without any binders, conducting additives or metal current collectors, which narrows the gap between conventional NIBs and SCs. The novel GF//NTO/GF configuration has shown high energy density, good power density, and long-term cycling stability. The energy density (70.6 W h kg−1, based on the mass of both electrodes) of the novel hybrid device is one of the highest values among the hybrid-ion capacitor configurations. Such an excellent performance could be attributed to the synergistic effects of the strongly coupled self-supported NTO/GF anode with a GF cathode. This work successfully constitutes the demonstration of designing QSS-NICs as a high performance power device, which could provide a scalable route to assemble a battery of non-liquid configuration.
