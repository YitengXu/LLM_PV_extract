    , Accepted 12th April 2017First published on 12th April 2017AbstractEfficient fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated with a polymer donor PBDB-T1 and a non-fullerene acceptor ITTIC. With the incorporation of one thiophene bridge between the indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) terminal, the new acceptor ITTIC exhibits a higher lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and a narrower bandgap than the pristine ITIC acceptor. The resultant PSCs with PBDB-T1:ITTIC blends exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 9.12%, with an increased open circuit voltage (VOC) and broader photoresponse, compared with the PBDB-T1:ITIC based devices. Interestingly, it is shown that the charge transfer remains effective at a diminished highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) difference of 0.02 eV between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC, leading to a mitigated energy loss of 0.54 eV in PBDB-T1:ITTIC based devices. Overall, this work provides new insights into further improvement of fullerene-free PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of a conjugated polymer electron donor and an electron acceptor have attracted tremendous interest in the last few decades.1–9 Among them, the emerging non-fullerene (NF) electron acceptors show additional advantages over the conventional fullerene electron acceptors, [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM), such as tunable energy levels and strong absorption in the visible and near infrared range.10–24 Through the elaborative molecular design of NFs and the related BHJ and device optimization, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9% have been realized for fullerene-free PSCs25–34 and the highest value is currently boosted to 12%,35 surpassing those of fullerene based PSCs.
One appealing feature among most of the efficient NF acceptors is to employ conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) blocks.36–42 Through choosing different donor and acceptor units, the energy levels and absorption properties of resultant NFs can be subtly tuned. For example, IEIC43 was first designed by Lin and Zhan et al., with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor core and a 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) acceptor end group, giving the highest occupied molecular orbital level (EHOMO) of −5.42 eV and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (ELUMO) of −3.82 eV. A PCE of 6.31% was achieved with donor polymer PTB7-Th. Then ITIC37 and IDT-BR15,44 were developed by introducing different donor or acceptor units. Both molecules show broad absorption up to 800 nm and give high efficiencies with medium-bandgap donor polymers. In order to give a new NF with a narrow bandgap, Yao and Hou et al. introduced electron-donating 3-alkoxy thiophene into IEIC, giving the molecule IEICO a broad absorption over 900 nm.45 The resulting device shows an improved short circuit current density JSC (and PCE) from 11.7 mA cm−2 (4.9%) to 17.7 mA cm−2 (8.4%). To obtain a high open circuit voltage VOC in fullerene-free PSCs, Li et al. raised the LUMO level of ITIC from −4.02 eV to −3.93 eV by introducing electron-donating methyl onto the terminal IC group. As a result, the VOC was increased from 0.90 V to 0.94 V and an excellent efficiency of 12.05% was obtained.35
Another advantage for NF acceptor based BHJ PSCs is that the energetics to drive efficient charge dissociation46–48 is proposed to be less than 0.3 eV, which is beneficial for mitigating the energy loss (Eloss = bandgap − eVOC) in PSCs.25,49,50 Bin et al.51 demonstrated a trialkylsilyl substituted donor polymer J71 and fabricated PSCs with ITIC as the acceptor. Efficient hole transfer was achieved with a ΔEHOMO = Edonor HOMO − Eacceptor HOMO of only 0.11 eV and a high PCE of 11.41% was obtained, with an Eloss of 0.63 eV. Zhang et al. designed a novel polythiophene derivative donor PDCBT-2F with a low EHOMO of −5.6 eV. With a methyl-end-capped ITIC derivative as the acceptor, it can give a PCE of 6.6%, with a superior Eloss of only 0.46 eV.52 However, there are only a limited number of successful polymer-NF combinations that can achieve a high PCE (>9%) with a low Eloss (<0.55 eV) in one photovoltaic device.53
In this paper, we develop a new NF acceptor ITTIC by incorporating a thiophene ring between the IDTT core and the IC end group of the ITIC molecule. The ITTIC film exhibits a red-shifted absorption with a narrower optical bandgap of 1.46 eV, compared to 1.55 eV of ITIC. Meanwhile, due to the electron-donating property of thiophene, the LUMO level is raised up from −4.00 eV (ITIC) to −3.82 eV (ITTIC). The blended film with polymer donor PBDB-T1 shows a more complementary and broader absorption extending to 850 nm. The photovoltaic device based on PBDB-T1:ITTIC gives an excellent efficiency of 9.12% from simple fabrication without any additives. More interestingly, it is revealed that a low Eloss of 0.54 eV is achieved in such efficient devices with a diminished ΔEHOMO of 0.02 eV. This work provides new insights into NF acceptor design and shows a possibility for further improvement of fullerene-free PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The chemical structures of PBDB-T1, ITIC and ITTIC are shown in Fig. 1a. ITTIC was synthesized by simple two-step reactions (Scheme S1†) and PBDB-T1 with a linear side chain was synthesized by Stille coupling of a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit and a 3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione unit (Scheme S2†). The synthetic details are given in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDB-T1 is measured to be 66.4 kDa, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.55. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) heating trace (Fig. S1†) of ITTIC exhibits no obvious melting or crystalline peaks. ITTIC shows good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature over 350 °C, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shown in Fig. S1a.†

Theoretical calculations
To study the influence of inserting a thiophene ring into the molecular backbone on the energy levels and geometries, the frontier orbitals and molecular conformation of ITIC and ITTIC are calculated by density functional theory (DFT). As shown in Fig. S2,† the insertion of a thiophene ring between IDTT and IC doesn't change the molecular planarity. Both ITIC and ITTIC remain planar backbones. In the meantime, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ITTIC are both raised from −5.49 eV to −5.22 eV and from −3.37 eV to −3.29 eV, leading to a narrower bandgap of 1.93 eV for ITTIC, compared with 2.12 eV for ITIC. The theoretical results fit well with our design purpose that inserting thiophene could raise the LUMO level, and narrow the bandgap of ITTIC, which would provide a large VOC and broaden the solar spectrum coverage in the derived PSCs.
Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDB-T1, ITIC and ITTIC in dilute solution (Fig. S3†) and thin films (Fig. 1b) were measured and compared. The maximum extinction coefficients of ITIC and ITTIC are measured to be 1.42 and 1.13 × 105 M−1 cm−1, in 10−5 M chloroform solution. It is found that ITTIC shows a strong absorption peak in the 550–800 nm area in solution. An obvious red-shift of 40 nm is observed in the thin film absorption, compared with that in solution. The strong shoulder peak in film absorption suggested strong π–π stacking in the solid state,54 which is beneficial for charge transport. The absorption spectrum of ITTIC shows an obvious red-shift compared to that of ITIC in both solution and solid state. So ITTIC can extend the absorption to 850 nm and be better complementary to PBDB-T1 which shows an absorption range from 500 to 700 nm. The optical bandgap of ITTIC is calculated to be 1.46 eV, narrower than that of ITIC (1.55 eV), as expected.
Electrochemical properties and energy levels
The electrochemical properties of PBDB-T1, ITIC and ITTIC are first investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S4†) and the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1c. The HOMO energy levels estimated from the onset oxidation are −5.26 eV, −5.55 eV and −5.28 eV for PBDB-T1, ITIC and ITTIC. And the LUMO energy levels are calculated to be −3.46 eV, −4.00 eV and −3.82 eV respectively, according to their optical bandgaps. The LUMO level of ITTIC is raised by 0.18 eV, favoring a high VOC in the device, compared to ITIC. Interestingly, the ΔEHOMO between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC is only 0.02 eV from CV measurements, compared to the large ΔEHOMO of 0.29 eV between PBDB-T1 and ITIC. To ensure the reliability of the small ΔEHOMO, we further measured the energy levels of three materials by using synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES). The corresponding spectrum and the calculated data are shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO levels of PBDB-T1, ITIC and ITTIC are calculated to be −4.39 eV, −4.59 eV and −4.48 eV, respectively. This shows that ΔEHOMO between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC is still only 0.09 eV, while the ΔEHOMO is 0.20 eV between PBDB-T1 and ITIC. Although the absolute values varied from those reported by different characterization and estimation methods, the exceptionally small ΔEHOMO between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC is verified.

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T1:ITTIC (or ITIC)/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to test the photovoltaic properties. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs are shown in Fig. 3 and all the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The blended film with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2 gives the best performances for both PBDB-T1:ITIC and PBDBD-T1:ITTIC. The thickness of the active layer is around 90 nm for both devices. The PBDB-T1:ITIC device shows a best PCE of 9.05%, with a VOC of 0.87 V, JSC of 16.11 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.64 without any post treatment. Both thermal annealing and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives decrease the device performance. In the meantime, the as-cast PBDB-T1:ITTIC device gives a PCE of 8.43%, with a larger VOC of 0.92 V, JSC of 14.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.62. After thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, the efficiency can be further improved to 9.12%, with a VOC of 0.92 V, JSC of 15.93 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.62. The improved performance is mainly ascribed to the increased JSC after annealing. Also the DIO additive shows no improvement for the PBDB-T1:ITTIC device. The EQE spectrum of the PBDB-T1:ITTIC device from 300 to 850 nm corresponds to the absorption spectra of PBDB-T1 and ITTIC, indicating that charge transfer from ITTIC to PBDB-T1 occurs and ITTIC also contributes to photocurrent even it occupies such a close EHOMO to the polymer donor. Overall, as we expected, ITTIC gives a larger VOC than ITIC as an acceptor with PBDB-T1 due to its high-lying LUMO level. It also shows a broader EQE response from 300 to 850 nm. However, the larger VOC and broader EQE do not lead to a much higher PCE, which can be ascribed to the decreased EQE. Interestingly, such an efficiency over 9% is achieved with a small energy loss of 0.54 eV at a negligible ΔEHOMO (0.02 eV), indicating that the performance ceilings of fullerene-free PSCs may still have plenty of room for further exploration.

PL quenching
To prove that the charge transfer can be realized with such a small energetic difference, we carried out photoluminescence (PL) measurements on the pristine and blended films with PBDB-T1 for ITIC and ITTIC (Fig. 4). To avoid the interference of the donor polymer, we selected an excitation wavelength of 680 nm to only excite the acceptors. In the emission spectrum, the ITIC pristine film shows a strong emission peak from 700 to 830 nm, while the ITTIC film gives a red-shifted emission from 725 to 850 nm. After being blended with PBDB-T1, the PL intensity is sufficiently quenched for both ITIC and ITTIC (>90%). The quenched PL intensity proves that charge transfer can be achieved efficiently from both of the two small molecule acceptors to the polymer donor. However, the PL quenching of the PBDB-T1:ITTIC blended film is not as sufficient as the PBDB-T1:ITIC film, which might be responsible for its lower EQE in the long wavelength area.

Charge mobilities
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blended films were determined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. As shown in Fig. S5† and Table 2, the as-cast PBDB-T1:ITIC blended film shows a μh of 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the PBDB-T1:ITTIC blended film shows slightly lower mobilities of 0.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) and 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe). However, after thermal annealing the hole and electron mobilities of the PBDB-T1:ITIC film decreased to 0.87 and 2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the μh and μe enhanced to 1.14 and 1.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDB-T1:ITTIC film. It might be ascribed to the morphology change of the blended film after annealing, which will be discussed in the morphology section. The different effects of thermal annealing on the carrier mobilities of PBDB-T1:ITIC and PBDB-T1:ITTIC blended films might be responsible for why annealing can improve the device performance for ITTIC but decrease it for ITIC.

Morphology
To gain insight into the effect of annealing on film morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to characterize two blended films as cast and after annealing. As shown in Fig. 5, both PBDBD-T1:ITIC and PBDB-T1:ITTIC blended films show good miscibility. After thermal annealing, it is observed that nanofibrillar structures are formed in the PBDB-T1:ITTIC film, while it shows no big influence on the PBDB-T1:ITIC film. The nanofibrillar structures are beneficial for charge transport in the active layer and could be responsible for the higher mobilities and JSC of the PBDB-T1:ITTIC film after annealing. We further carried out grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to study the molecular ordering in neat and blended films. As shown in Fig. 6 and S6,† both the π–π stacking (010) peaks of ITTIC and ITIC in the neat film appear in the out-of-plane direction (q ≈ 1.76 Å−1, d ≈ 3.57 Å and q ≈ 1.50 Å−1, d ≈ 4.19 Å), implying a preferential face-on oriented packing of ITTIC and ITIC. In contrast, the out-of-plane π–π stacking peak of ITIC is barely observable in the PBDB-T1:ITIC blend while the π–π peak of ITTIC remains obvious in the PBDB-T1:ITTIC film, indicating its strong face-on stacking. We ascribed the relatively stronger and tighter molecular packing of ITTIC to its extended π-conjugation structure and planar backbone.

Conclusions
In summary, a new non-fullerene acceptor ITTIC was designed and synthesized by inserting a thiophene ring between the IDTT core and the IC terminal groups of ITIC. As we expected, ITTIC shows a narrower bandgap of 1.46 eV and a red-shifted absorption compared with ITIC. Moreover, the LUMO level of ITTIC is raised from −4.00 eV to −3.82 eV due to the electron-donating property of thiophene. Hence, a larger VOC of 0.92 V and a broader photoresponse in the solar spectrum are obtained for the photovoltaic devices based on ITTIC and polymer donor PBDB-T1. Interestingly, the optimized devices give a best efficiency of 9.12% with a small energy loss of 0.54 eV at a negligible ΔEHOMO of 0.02 eV. Sufficient PL quenching confirmed that charge transfer can be efficiently achieved with such a small ΔEHOMO. We demonstrated a strategy to simultaneously manipulate the energy levels and absorption of non-fullerene acceptors via simple structural alteration, which positively impacts on enlarging the device VOC and broadening the spectral response in the derived PSCs. Moreover, it has been revealed that negligible ΔEHOMO and small energy loss can be reached in efficient devices, which sheds light on the performance ceilings of fullerene-free PSCs that may be so far untouched.
