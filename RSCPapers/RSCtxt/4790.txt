    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 22nd March 2019AbstractHighly (00.1)-textured polycrystalline WSe2 films are developed as hydrogen evolving photoelectrodes and improved through deposition of a thin ammonium thiomolybdate (NH4)2Mo3S13 catalyst film. This semiconducting thiomolybdate forms a heterojunction with the p-type WSe2 film passivating recombination centers of excited electron–hole pairs at the edges of the (00.1) textured WSe2 nanoflakes. In addition, thiomolybdate acts as a photoelectrocatalyst at the electrode – aqueous electrolyte interface during light-driven hydrogen evolution. Whereas the photoelectrochemical activity of pure WSe2 is dominated by charge carrier recombination processes at edge states of the hexagonal nanoflakes, we obtain homogeneous charge transfer across the van der Waals planes concomitant with the passivation of these edge states. A photocurrent density of up to 5.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE is obtained with the proposed homogeneously distributed (NH4)2Mo3S13/WSe2 heterojunction system under AM 1.5 illumination in the 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. We conclude that homogeneously distributed semiconducting catalysts on the van der Waals planes of WSe2 nano-crystallites are a feasible strategy towards solar hydrogen evolution with large-area photoelectrocathodes.
Introduction
Due to the severe consequences of climate change caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, the energy system of mankind has to be transformed into a renewable one.1,2 The expedient way is the generation of renewable energy from sunlight, wind, water, waves, and biomass. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like sunlight, wind, and waves, the storage of electrical or chemical energy is needed.3,4 An obvious way is, to generate hydrogen by electrolysis or photoelectrolysis of water and to store it. For a prospective industrial implementation of photoelectrolysis of water large area photoelectrode materials have to be developed.
A suitable photoelectrode material must have a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency as well as good long-term stability in concentrated electrolytes. Efficient photoelectrolytic hydrogen evolution was recently demonstrated using p-InP and p-Si single crystal wafers,5,6 but these materials were not stable in alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively.2 Furthermore, single crystalline materials are much more expensive in comparison to thin films.
Previously, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) were studied as prospective candidates for photoelectrodes with efficiencies of up to 17% upon illumination in acidic solutions using n-type single crystals.7,8 The high potential of such layer-type semiconductors (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2) is caused by their suitable band gap energy in the range of 1–2 eV, a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), and long-term stability in an acidic electrolyte.7,9–11 TMDCs are strongly anisotropic materials which can be mechanically exfoliated into atomically thin X–Me–X slabs (where X = S, Se and Me = Mo, W).12,13 The strong crystallographic anisotropy manifests itself in anisotropic electrical transport properties since the electrical and thermal conductivity along the van der Waals (vdW) planes are by a factor of up to 100 higher compared to the transport perpendicular to the vdW planes.14 So far, it has not been possible to transfer the results from small (mm2) single crystal electrodes to large area (m2) electrodes composed of polycrystalline, but highly oriented layers.
The TMDC layers can be grown and crystallized with the c-axis of the crystallites parallel or perpendicular to the substrate normal, depending on the application.15 For photoelectrocatalytic applications, the perpendicular orientation of the c-axis is favorable, since this configuration ensures exposure of the edge sites to the contacting electrolyte, allowing efficient charge transfer to the electrolyte.16 However, the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs happens at the prismatic sites of hexagonal crystallites (edge sites), i.e. at (hk.0)-planes. Thus, a significant improvement of the TMDCs can be achieved by reducing the steps and dislocations (recombination centers) at the vdW planes, which limit the quantum efficiency of photoelectrochemical cells.7 This requires either single crystals with perfect (00.1) electrode surfaces, or a method to passivate surface states of a polycrystalline TMDC film. In earlier studies, the charge transfer kinetics through the semiconductor/electrolyte interface could significantly be improved by photoetching of the defects,7 or by electrochemical17 or photoelectrochemical18,19 deposition of platinum nanoparticles, respectively.
Catalysts are decisive for the reduction of overpotentials at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, since they significantly improve the charge carrier transport across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface (SEI). Platinum is the catalyst mostly used for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because it has moderate binding and absorption energies for protons and hydrogen, respectively, which leads to a high turnover frequency in the HER.20 However, the high cost of Pt limits its widespread application. In order to reduce the costs, expensive noble metal catalysts must be replaced by cheap, environmentally friendly and earth abundant catalysts. MoSx-type catalysts belong to this group of materials. It was shown for hexagonal MoS2 that the sulfur atoms at edge sites of (00.1)-facets act as active centers for the HER, their catalytic efficiency being comparable to that of platinum.21 As the vdW basal planes are catalytically inert, nanoparticles are of interest for increasing the number of active sites at the edges of the hexagonal planes.25 Recently, it was reported that ammonium thiomolybdate (NH4)2Mo3S13 nanoclusters showed an even better performance in the HER in comparison to MoS2 nanoparticles.22 This catalyst is characterized by a high number of catalytically active [S2]2− sites.
In our previous work, highly (00.1)-textured, photoactive WSe2 films were prepared by a sequential amorphous solid–liquid-crystalline solid process (aSLcS).23–25 The pristine WSe2 films exhibit high photoactivity in the bulk, derived from time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements, but only very low photocatalytical activity upon illumination in an electrolyte. This was explained by the low charge carrier transfer rate via the (00.1) van der Waals planes to the SEI. Even, when evaporating a thin Pt film as a HER catalyst homogeneously onto the WSe2 van der Waals planes, no significant photocurrent can be observed. However, when depositing photochemically Pt nanoislands preferentially at the crystallite edges,25 the transfer from the edge sites of WSe2 crystallites to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface can be significantly improved. This clearly shows that Pt acts as a HER catalyst only at the edges of (00.1)-oriented WSe2 crystallites.
In this paper, we investigate another strategy to enhance the charge transfer from the WSe2 photoelectrode to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface: by forming a heterojunction between two semiconductors, an electrical field is generated which drives the excited electrons to the surface, thus enabling the reduction of the adsorbed protons to hydrogen molecules. This is done by depositing ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) (mentioned above) films on top of the WSe2 electrodes, thus creating a homogeneous heterojunction on the vdW planes along with the passivation of the edge states of WSe2.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The structural and morphological properties of WSe2 films, prepared by the aSLcS process, have already been reported in detail previously.24 The WSe2 films contain PdSex particles on the surface after crystallization, so it is further mentioned as the WSe2 film for simplicity. The WSe2 film exhibits a hexagonal structure with the lattice parameters a = 3.29 Å and c = 12.98 Å that are close to the values of standard diffraction patterns (WSe2: JCDPS no. 38-1388). Here, an optimization of the WSe2 films with respect to the crystallographic properties was carried out by variation of the thickness ratio of the WSe2 and the Pd-promoter layers, respectively. The XRD patterns of the films, shown in Fig. 1a, indicate the presence of the main phase – WSe2 and of a promoter phase – PdSex. First, we optimized the WSe2 film thickness at a constant Pd promoter thickness of 10 nm. Increasing the WSe2 thickness from 40 nm to 100 nm leads to an improvement of the crystal quality and the enhancement of the coherently diffracting domain sizes (often called crystallite size), which is obvious from the increasing intensities of the (00.2l)-peaks (l = 1–5) by about 7 times and from considerable narrowing of their full widths at half maximum (FWHM), see Fig. 1b. Moreover, increasing the Pd-promoter thickness to 20 nm and the WSe2 film thickness to 300 nm, respectively, significantly improved the structure of the films resulting in an increase of the thickness d of the hexagonal WSe2 crystallites from 60 nm to 100 nm. With increasing film thickness, the crystallite thickness d also increases (Fig. 1b), which means that the formed PdSex effectively promotes the formation of large WSe2 crystallites. The orientation of the crystallites of the WSe2 films with respect to the substrate normal was studied by rocking curve measurements (Fig. 1c). Here, the highest intensities and narrowest FWHM (0.04°) were observed for the 300 nm thick WSe2 film, which proves the high texture of this type of film close to that of an epitaxial film (Fig. 2d).26 The maximum lateral sizes of the platelets for the best crystallized WSe2 films amounts to 2–6 μm as revealed from the SEM pictures (see ESI Fig. 1a†).

The first and second numbers correspond to the WSe2 and Pd thicknesses, respectively. The pronounced (00.2l) (l = 1–5) diffraction peaks indicate the strong (00.1) texture of the films.

The “thinned” ATM films were photoelectrochemically treated in 0.5 M H2SO4, see the ESI Fig. 2a.† 
Surface characterization
The chemical composition and electronic structure of the surfaces of pristine WSe2 and ATM coated WSe2 films were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), see Fig. 2a and b. For the pristine WSe2 film, the W and Se peaks match with those known from single crystals.27 The peaks at binding energies of 36 and 38 eV are attributed to the presence of a small amount of oxidized tungsten.28 The intensities of the elements W and Se almost disappear after coating the WSe2 film with an ATM layer, since the ATM layer prevents the escape of photoelectrons from the surface of the WSe2 film. After the photoelectrochemical treatment, the ATM layer becomes thinner (ESI Fig. 2a†), leading to a shift of weak W and Se signals by 0.2 eV to lower energies (Fig. 2a and b), indicating a band bending at the WSe2/ATM interface.
The ATM layer itself shows the doublet peaks 3d3/2/3d5/2 (232.65 eV and 229.45 eV), which corresponds to molybdenum in oxidation state Mo4+ (Fig. 2c).22 Near the Mo 3d5/2 peak a broad sulfur 2s peak is detected, which is attributed to the different chemical states of sulfur in the Mo3S13 cluster. The detailed analysis of the S 2p region shows the presence of two 2p3/2/2p1/2 doublets (Fig. 2d). Following the interpretation given by Müller et al.,29 the first doublet at 162.1 eV and 163.5 eV can be assigned to the terminal S2− and S22− ligands while the second doublet at 163.5 eV and 164.8 eV can be addressed as bridging S22− of the Mo3S13 cluster. Our results are in agreement with the structure of (NH4)2Mo3S13, described in detail by Kibsgaard et al.22 and by Müller et al.29 After photoelectrochemical thinning (see ESI Fig. 2a†) of the ATM layer, the intensities of the Mo 3d and S 2p peaks are decreased as expected (Fig. 2c and d).
Surface photovoltage (SPV) analysis
The effect of an ATM catalyst layer deposited on WSe2 films was studied by surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements.30 In Fig. 3a, the SPV amplitude is displayed on a logarithmic scale as a function of the photon energy. For photon energies below about 1.3. eV, i.e. in the band gap of the WSe2 absorber, the SPV signal shows a plateau, presumably caused by defects in the band gap. The maximum SPV value appears at a photon energy of about 1.6 eV, which correlates with the excitonic A transition in WSe2 caused by a direct transition of electrons from the split valence band to the conduction band.9 This is also in accordance with the optical absorption spectrum, published recently by us.24 In the sub-band gap region (Eph < 1.3 eV), the SPV signal for ATM-coated WSe2 is lower than that of bare WSe2, which indicates an electronic passivation of recombination centers in the WSe2 crystallites by the ATM layer. The bare WSe2 film has a maximum SPV signal of 60 μV, whereas the ATM-coated WSe2 film exhibits a three times larger SPV value of 180 μV. Obviously, the ATM-coating improves the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, which we attribute to the formation of an ATM/WSe2 heterojunction, which creates a built-in potential that induces a fast separation of electron–hole pairs (Fig. 4a). For comparison, the SPV spectrum of a TiN:O layer, which is used as the back contact, is shown in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that the back contact is not photoactive at all. The additional description of the SPV signals is shown in the ESI Fig. 3.†

(b) PV amplitudes normalized to the photon flux of the ATM-WSe2/TiN:O, WSe2/TiN:O and Pt–WSe2/TiN:O. The black and blue lines are fits to the exponential tails below the excitonic A transition for ATM-WSe2/TiN:O and WSe2/TiN:O, respectively.

(b) Fermi level (FL) alignment diagram of the pristine WSe2, Pt/WSe2 and ATM/WSe2, Pt/ATM/WSe2 junctions, where EF is the FL of the pristine WSe2 and ΔΦ is the FL of WSe2 after coating with Pt, ATM and Pt/ATM. 
The PV amplitude is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared in-phase and phase-shifted by 90° signals. The spectra of the PV amplitudes normalized to the photon flux for ATM-WSe2/TiN:O, WSe2/TiN:O and Pt–WSe2/TiN:O are shown in Fig. 3b. The energy of the exponential tails (Et) below the excitonic A transition amounted to 46 and 65 meV for ATM-WSe2/TiN:O and WSe2/TiN:O, respectively. As a remark, for Pt–WSe2/TiN:O, the value of Et was also about 65 meV. Therefore, the degree of disorder in WSe2 was strongly reduced for ATM-WSe2/TiN:O. This can be interpreted in terms of very efficient homogenization of the overall surface of WSe2 platelets by the homogeneous coverage with ATM. The reduced disorder caused a strong reduction of recombination losses.
Band alignment
The optical properties of a single, thick (690 nm) ATM layer were determined by transmittance and reflectance measurements (ESI Fig. 2c†). From the Tauc plot of the absorption coefficient, a band gap of 1.9 eV was derived (ESI Fig. 2d†). This means, ammonium thiomolybdate itself is a semiconductor and can absorb solar light and contribute to the water splitting process. However, due to the very thin (10 nm or below according to XPS probe depth) ATM catalyst films on the WSe2 absorber, the contribution to the measured photocurrent is negligible.
To determine the band alignment of the ATM/WSe2 junction, we analyzed the valence band positions of both films by XPS (ESI Fig. 4†). Here, the valence band position of the ATM (EATMV = 0.37 eV) is considerably shifted to about  with respect to the valence band edge of WSe2. The difference noted as WSe2-ATM in the superscript depicts the potential step when moving from WSe2 to ATM. This shift is close to the valence band offset value of  for a MoS2/WSe2 heterojunction reported by Chiu et al.,31 who demonstrated that the electronic structures of different transition metal chalcogenide layers (MoS2/WSe2) retain their individual layers due to a weak interlayer coupling. From the XPS data and from the measured optical band gaps a band diagram of the ATM/WSe2 layer stack was constructed (Fig. 4a). The conduction band offset between WSe2 and ATM of about 0.25 eV improves the electron transfer to the ATM surface where the electrons can reduce the adsorbed protons to H2. WSe2 exhibits two prominent peaks at W4f7/2 32.25 eV and W4f5/2 34.4 eV, respectively.25 The position of the valence band for WSe2 from the W4f core level is calculated as the difference of the W4f7/2 peak position at 32.25 eV and valence band maximum measured at 1.07 eV (see ESI Fig. 4a and b†) with respect to the Fermi level (32.25 eV to 1.07 eV), i.e. it is 31.18 eV. The position of the valence band for ATM is similarly determined as the distance between the Mo3d core level and valence band maximum (229.45 eV to 0.37 eV), i.e. it is 229.08 eV (ESI Fig. 4b†).
We found that the conductivity behavior of WSe2 depends on the crystal phase of PdSex promoter particles present on the surface, which can be metallic, semimetal or semiconducting: Pd4Se, Pd17S15 and PdSe2, which are difficult to control.24,32 These particles are mainly concentrated at the surface. In general, the WSe2 film behaves as a p-type semiconductor also taking into account its bulk. We suggest that the n-type behavior of the WSe2 surface (a closer position of the WSe2 Fermi level (Ef) to the conduction band), can be due to the presence of the metallic Pd4Se and Pd17Se15 phases, since XPS is sensitive up to 10 nm depth. The transfer from n-type to p-type in Fig. 4b can be due to passivation of the PdSex particles by the ATM layer. Additionally, in our recent report,32 the PdSex particles were etched from the surface of WSe2, which led to the improvement of the semiconducting properties of WSe2, i.e. a prominent p-type character was observed.
The work function (WF) of WSe2 was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)33 using a He I source. The measured WF of 5.5 eV vs. vacuum is consistent with the reported work functions for WSe2 (5.2–5.6 eV vs. vacuum).34 The Fermi level (Ef) is considered to be in the range of 0.7–1.1 V vs. RHE. The band diagram in Fig. 4a is built taking into account that the work function of WSe2 is located at 1 V vs. RHE (5.5 eV vs. vacuum, ESI Fig. 4c†), assuming that it is equal to Ef, and the optical band gaps of WSe2 and ATM are 1.45 eV and 1.92 eV (ESI Fig. 2d and e†).
The Pt coated WSe2 film shows an almost identical SPV curve (Fig. 3a), compared with the pristine WSe2 film, which proves that the charge carrier separation is not improved by the Pt/WSe2 Schottky contact (in contrast to the ATM/WSe2 contact). From the XPS analysis of these different samples, it is found that the deposition of Pt on WSe2 leads to a Fermi level shift (FLS) of 0.26 eV, i.e. to the change of the FL position from 1.07 to 0.81 eV with respect to the VBM (Fig. 4b). The Fermi level shift for Pt/WSe2 is in agreement with the results of Smyth et al. for the Au/WSe2 contact.35 The ATM/WSe2 sample exhibits a larger FLS of 0.7 eV. This means, Pt on WSe2 forms a Schottky junction with the weaker FLS, whereas the ATM catalyst forms a stronger heterojunction accompanied by a better charger carrier separation. This explains the higher photoactivity of the ATM/WSe2 contact compared to that of Pt/WSe2.
Raman spectra
In order to study whether chemical bonds between WSe2 and ATM are formed, Raman spectroscopy of the ATM/WSe2 double layer and the separate films was performed (Fig. 5). The Raman spectrum of the ATM/WSe2 heterojunction shows a clear combination of separate ATM and WSe2 layers, where no considerable change in chemical bonding was observed indicating a van der Waals bonding type, similar to the combination of a MoS2 and WS2 heterojunction.13 The WSe2 film exhibits the main in-plane E12g vibration mode slightly merged with the A1g out-of-plane mode at 250 cm−1 as the main peak.36 The ATM Raman spectra are characteristic for its terminal, bridging and apical chemical bonds, which are similar to the Raman spectra of ATM reported previously.22 However, the positions of the Raman peaks for ATM on WSe2 are shifted in comparison to a pristine ATM film, which means that a bonding on WSe2 is formed. The Mo–Mo, Mo–S and Mo3–Sa bonds in ATM are strong and not significantly changed after combination with WSe2. The peaks at 362.7 and 384.3 cm−1 for ATM/WSe2 appear due to the overlay of the Mo–S peaks at 352.6 and 378.6 cm−1 with 3L(AM) and E′(M)LO2 + LA(M) peaks at 371.28 and 392.63 cm−1.37 However, the ν(S–S)t and ν(S–S)br modes at 507.72 and 543.3 cm−1 for ATM are considerably shifted to higher vibration modes at 520 and 553.11 cm−1 for ATM/WSe2, i.e. by about 12.3 and 10 cm−1 (difference in the Raman shift of 2.3 cm−1 indicates the weaker terminal bond than that of the bridging bond). This significant shift can be explained by the weaker S–S bond compared to the Mo–Mo and Mo–S bonds, which can be easily changed by adjacent in-phase vibrations of A1g and/or E12g modes of WSe2.38 In addition to this, the ATM layer also influences the vibration modes of WSe2, resulting in the shift of the A1g and E12g modes to higher vibration frequencies. This means, that the adjacent Se atomic layer of the WSe2 forms the vdW bonding with the S layer in ATM. However, it is not excluded that the S atoms in ATM can create chemical bonds at the edge steps of the Se-deficient site of WSe2, i.e. it forms Mo–S–W bonds. On the other hand the Se atoms of the vdW planes of WSe2 can also create a chemical bonding at the S-deficient site of ATM changing its vibration modes, i.e. forming W–Se–Mo bonds.

Photoelectrochemical performance
A pristine 120 nm thick WSe2 film on TiN:O exhibits only very weak photoactivity; the measured photocurrent density under AM 1.5 illumination was less than 0.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE due to prevailing vdW planes exposed to the electrolyte (Fig. 6a), where the electron transfer is hindered. Also a thin ATM film on TiN:O is only weakly photoactive upon illumination, exhibiting a negative photocurrent density upon chopped light (ESI Fig. 5a†), which has an onset potential starting from 0.7 V vs. RHE similar to WSe2 indicating a p-type behavior. On the other hand, the combination of the ATM and WSe2 film results in a significant increase of the photocurrent density up to 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which is in agreement with the observed increased SPV signal when depositing an ATM layer onto WSe2 (Fig. 3a). Increasing the WSe2 film thickness to 350 nm leads to further enhancement of the photocurrent density to a maximum of 5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 6a and c). The highest measured photocurrent density for the ATM/WSe2 film at 0 V vs. RHE is 5.6 mA cm−2 (ESI Fig. 5b†). Fig. 6b shows the photocurrent density versus time upon chopped illumination at a fixed potential of 0 V vs. RHE for 70 s. Herein, the values of the photocurrent density for different thick films are similar to the photocurrent density values for the films measured at 0 V vs. RHE in Fig. 6a.

(d) Optical absorption spectra, incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) for ATM/WSe2 photocathodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 at −0.1 V vs. RHE. 
The increase of the photocurrent density with increasing WSe2 thickness (up to about 350 nm) can be explained by the larger number of absorbed photons and hence generated electron–hole pairs. For even larger thicknesses the photocurrent decrease is caused by the limited carrier diffusion length in the order of 400 nm (Fig. 6c). This value is much smaller than the diffusion length of 1–2 μm, evaluated recently by us from time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements.25 This, however, can be explained by the strong anisotropy of the carrier transport in these layer-type materials; the mobility along the c-axis, i.e. towards the SEI, is one to two orders of magnitude less than the conductivity perpendicular to the c-axis due to the weak vdW bonding between the S–W–S layers.14
The thickness dependence was fitted with an analytical model taking into account the increased absorption with increasing thickness and the decreasing carrier collection if the absorber is thicker than the diffusion length.39 Based on an old model of Hecht40 for the carrier collection efficiency in AgCl single crystals, Abeyweera et al.39 derived a simple analytical formula for the carrier collection efficiency of thick films, where a carrier generation depth profile exists which can be expressed as: (1)where, Iphoto_max is the maximum current density, α is the absorption coefficient (taken as a mean value over the solar spectrum), d is the film thickness, LD is the diffusion length and ds is a dead layer thickness at the contacts with a high recombination velocity. Fitting the Iphoto(d) curve (Fig. 6c) with eqn (1), yields a diffusion length of LD = 320 nm, a dead layer thickness of 60 nm and an absorption coefficient of 6 × 104 cm−1. This value of LD is significantly smaller (about a factor of 6) compared to the diffusion length derived from time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements (TRMC).25 This can be explained by the anisotropy of WSe2 while in a PEC experiment, the transport along the c-axis of the (0001)-oriented WSe2 crystallites (i.e. perpendicular to the van der Waals planes) governs the transport, in the TRMC measurement the diffusion length in the van der Waals planes is measured, which is much higher.14
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) for an ATM/WSe2 photocathode was measured in the photon energy range from 1.2 eV to 3.7 eV, where its behavior is similar to the absorption spectrum of the ATM/WSe2 photocathode (Fig. 6d). The peak at 1.6 eV corresponds to the excitonic absorption (A exciton) of WSe2, a characteristic for TMDCs, which was also observed in the SPV measurement (Fig. 3a). The APCE reaches a maximum of 34% at a photon energy of 2.7 eV. The decrease of the APCE spectrum for Eph > 2.7 eV points to recombination losses at the photocathode/electrolyte interface, since the theoretical APCE value reaches 80% (see the absorption spectrum). The absorption of light at energies lower than 1.5 eV is due to trap states in the band gap, which were also observed in the SPV spectra of the ATM/WSe2 film (Fig. 3a). The AM 1.5-spectrum integrated photocurrent density of the ATM/WSe2 photocathode from the IPCE curve is 3.1 mA cm−2, which has been shown in our previous report,25 and is close to the measured photocurrent density of 4 mA cm−2 under standard illumination (AM 1.5) at 0 V vs. RHE.
The highest reported photocurrent density for a WSe2 single crystal under simulated AM 1.5 illumination is about 25 mA cm−2 under short circuit conditions (0 V vs. RHE) in an acidic solution.19 Such a high photocurrent density is comparable with that of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction, which demonstrated a hydrogen evolution reaction at a photocurrent density of 24.6 mA cm2 (0 V vs. RHE).41 However, for large scale applications, WSe2 single crystals cannot be used due to their high costs. Recently, for WSe2 polycrystalline films a photocurrent density of about 4 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE was demonstrated.42 In this case, the highest photocurrent density was reached due to the passivation of the edge sites of the WSe2 crystallites with the Pt/Cu catalyst. Comparison of the photocurrents for the WSe2 thin films from the literature are shown in Table 1.

Photoelectrochemical stability
The long-term operation (stability) of a photocathode is crucial for a continuous HER. A bare WSe2 photocathode is known to be stable in alkaline and acidic solutions.7,12 Due to d–d band transitions of excited electrons, the ATM and WSe2 should be highly stable against photocorrosion similar to MoS2.43 Recently, Kibsgaard et al.22 tested the stability of bare ATM films of about 200 nm thickness, cycled 1000 times in the dark up to current densities of 25 mA cm−2. The total duration of cycling was about 2.8 hours. Though Kibsgaard et al. claimed a high catalytic activity even after 1000 cycles, the current density at a fixed voltage (≈−0.2 V vs. RHE) after 1000 cycles decreased from 25 to 15 mA cm−2, i.e. a degradation of 40% took place. McKone et al.,19 on the other hand, reported only a slight decrease in the photocurrent density during 2 hours for a p-type WSe2 single crystal, coated with a Pt/Ru catalyst under alkaline and acidic conditions. Yu et al.42 showed a good stability for about 2 h at a constant photocurrent density at about 1.5 mA cm−2 for polycrystalline WSe2 thin films coated with a Pt/Cu catalyst in sulfuric acid. In our case, the stability of the ATM/WSe2 (200 nm thick) photoelectrode was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 (∼0 pH) under AM 1.5 illumination. Comparable to the literature, we also observed only a slight reduction of the photocurrent under acidic condition. The cathodic current density of 3.7 mA cm−2 measured at the beginning was reduced within 1 h to 1.7 mA cm−2, however the removal of the collected H2 bubbles from the ATM/WSe2 surface led to the recovery of the photocurrent density to 4 mA cm−2. The decrease in the photocurrent density can be explained by a gradual increase in the H2 amount, which prevents the light absorption and charge transfer at the SEI (Fig. 7). The long term stability test over 3 h is shown in the ESI Fig. 7.†
 Fig. 7  Chopped photocurrent density versus time (light/dark times were 10 s each) of a 200 nm thick ATM-WSe2 photocathode at 0 VRHE in 0.5 M H2SO4, illumination AM 1.5. 
As soon as the as-prepared WSe2 film is taken from the chamber (vacuum) to the air, the surface of the WSe2 film is oxidized at the points, where the dangling bonds (bare W sites) are exposed. The ATM can also have dangling bonds at Mo sites (lack of sulfur sites). Since the ATM layer is attached to the WSe2 film, the holes coming from ATM can oxidize the surface leading to formation of molybdenum oxide. Another possible case is that after testing in the PEC cell, the ATM/WSe2 is taken from the electrolyte to the air, where reduced species on the ATM surface are oxidized.
By analyzing a photoelectrochemically treated ATM/WSe2 photocathode by XPS, we determined whether the ATM catalyst exhibits photocorrosion. The XPS spectrum for the Mo region shows an oxidation state of Mo6+ corresponding to the MoO3 phase, which is obvious from the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks at 232.6 eV and 235.8 eV44 (ESI Fig. 7†). The sulfur 2p peaks are significantly changed after testing, confirming the formation of sulfates (oxidation state S4+) at 166.5 eV and amorphous MoS3.75 with the attributed S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks at 162.8 eV and 160.9 eV,45i.e. to the break of the terminal, apical and the bridging ligands of [Mo3S13]2− clusters.
Charge transfer across the SEI
In order to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the charge transfer sites on the ATM surface, Pt islands were photochemically deposited onto the ATM/WSe2 film for 540 s at an open circuit potential in 0.1 M HCl solution under AM 1.5 illumination (see Fig. 8a and section Methods). The SEM image and the EDX mapping pictures display the homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoislands on the whole ATM surface, which proves the homogeneous charge transfer over the WSe2 vdW planes to the ATM surface, where the electrons can react with the Pt ions from the solution (ESI Fig. 8†). In the Pt photodeposition process, electrons excited in the WSe2 film, are transported to the ATM surface passing the ATM/WSe2 heterojunction, and reducing the Pt ions on the ATM surface, leading to the precipitation of Pt nanoislands with diameters of 20 to 50 nm. The homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoislands shows clearly that the charge transfer from the absorber film takes place over the whole area of the van der Waals planes of the WSe2 crystallites. This is strongly different from the photodeposition of platinum on bare WSe2 films, which leads to the decoration of grain boundaries/edge steps and local defects (Fig. 8b).25
 Fig. 8  SEM pictures of photodeposited Pt islands on (a) an ATM/WSe2 heterostructure and (b) an as-grown WSe2 film. The films were photochemically coated by Pt nanoislands for 540 s and 180 s, respectively, under open circuit potential conditions in 0.1 M HCl solution (scale bar lengths: 500 nm). 
For WSe2 films of the same thickness (120 nm), coated with Pt or ATM, respectively, photocurrent densities of 1.4 mA cm−225 and 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE were obtained, i.e. the charge transfer for the ATM catalyst is 2 times higher compared to that of the Pt catalyst (see ESI Fig. 9†). However, taking into account the surface coverage (4% coverage by Pt islands;25 100% coverage of the ATM layer), the charge transfer efficiency of the Pt catalyst is higher by a factor of more than ten compared to that of the ATM catalyst (see ESI Fig. 1b†). ATM/WSe2 shows a higher photocurrent density at lower voltages starting from 0.1 V than that of Pt/WSe2. However, the latter exhibits higher activity at higher voltages, which is important with respect to the efficiency of the photocathode. Consequently, Pt-photodeposition on top of ATM/WSe2 leads to an enhancement of the photocurrent density at higher voltages, since the Pt catalyst on top of ATM additionally improves the charge transfer for the HER.
The Pt deposition leads to the Fermi level shift (FLS) for the pristine WSe2 as well as for the ATM films, where FLSs of Pt/WSe2 and Pt/ATM are similar, being about 0.3 eV (Fig. 4b). This actually proves that an additional deposition of Pt on top of the semiconductors improves the charge transfer to the electrolyte decreasing the barrier at the SEI. Hence, this metal–semiconductor Schottky barrier at the ATM/WSe2 heterojunction is an additional benchmark.
The photochemical deposition of Pt on both WSe2 and ATM/WSe2 photoelectrodes significantly reduces overvoltage similar to platinized single crystalline n-type WSe211 and MoS2 nanosheets.46 This behavior can be explained by Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by gap-states (defects) at the catalyst/semiconductor interface provided by Pt.34,35 Here, the W d-band dispersion curves are superimposed with the Pt d-band curves, i.e. hybridization takes place. For MoS2 or WS2 the FLP occurs near the conduction or valence band minimum, i.e. depending on where the majority of density of states is concentrated.
Solar hydrogen evolution
The hydrogen evolution at the ATM/WSe2 photoelectrode was quantitatively determined with a two-pipette set-up, allowing both the measurement of the evolved H2 at the cathode as well as the O2 generated at the anode.47 The Faradaic efficiency of 82% proves a high reaction rate of electrons with the H+ ions to form hydrogen H2. Fig. 9a shows hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the photoelectrode, formed during illumination with simulated solar light (AM 1.5). The evolved H2 gas was collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. It can be seen from Fig. 9b that it contains only H2. The sharp peak of the H2 curve was induced after a strong pressing of the syringe piston. The absence of an H2Se signal proves that the WSe2 electrode was not corroded during the hydrogen evolution process. The evolved gas volumes of H2 and O2 show a linear dependence on the gas evolution time for a constant photocurrent.25 The ratio of the evolved gas volumes vH2/vO2 is equal to 2.2, which confirms, within the measurement accuracy of about 10%, the expected ratio 2. This ratio is due to the fact that H2 formation is a two-electron process, while O2 evolution is a four-electron process.1 The amount of hydrogen gas evolved after 2 h of testing was 0.9 mL cm−2.25

Conclusions
As-prepared highly (00.1)-textured WSe2 films are only weakly photoactive, presumably at the few edge steps/grain boundaries of the WSe2 crystallites. To achieve an efficient hydrogen evolution, the number of catalytically active sites must be increased. This can be done by Pt deposition,19,25 which activates the grain boundaries or by chemical/electronic activation of the (00.1) vdW surfaces. The Mo3S13 clusters in ATM exhibit a higher number of S-active sites compared to that of MoS2 nanoparticles.21,22
There are two possible charge transfer mechanisms at the ATM/WSe2 interface: the charge transfer through the ATM/WSe2 junction, i.e. parallel to the c-axis (normal to vdW planes) as well as across the WSe2 edges/steps, i.e. perpendicular to the c-axis (along vdW planes), where ATM chemically passivates WSe2. The diffusion length along the c-axis is one to two orders of magnitude less than the diffusion length perpendicular to the c-axis caused by the strongly anisotropic structure of the transition metal chalcogenides.14 The bonding in these materials within the van der Waals (vdW) planes is ionic-covalent, i.e. strong, while it is weak between the vdW planes. Both of these charge transfer mechanisms contribute to the overall photocurrent density at the SEI.
In conclusion, photocurrent densities up to 5.6 mA cm−2 were obtained at 0 V vs. RHE in sulfuric acid (pH ∼ 0), the highest reported value for a polycrystalline WSe2 thin film photocathode. The high photocurrent density could be achieved by optimizing the thickness of the WSe2 film as a function of the Pd-promoter layer thickness, crystallization temperature, i.e. the deposition conditions.24,25 We have demonstrated that (NH4)2Mo3S13 (ATM) is not only an effective and earth abundant electrocatalyst for the HER, but also a compound semiconductor, which after deposition on a polycrystalline and highly textured WSe2 film passivates surface states and forms a buried junction with the absorber layer, leading to a remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic activity as a photoelectrode for the HER.
Experimental
WSe2 film deposition
The X-ray amorphous WSe2+x thin films were prepared by DC reactive magnetron sputtering of a tungsten target at a power of 55 W in an Ar:H2Se (1:4) atmosphere at a pressure of 1.25 Pa onto quartz glass (QG) and TiN:O back contact substrates at room temperature. The purity of the W target, Ar and H2Se gases were 99.99%, 99.999% and 99.9%, respectively. The thickness of the films was changed by varying the deposition time. Afterwards, the WSe2+x amorphous films were crystallized at 550–600 °C for 10 minutes by the amorphous solid–liquid-crystalline solid (aSLcS) process24 with a Pd promoter (10–20 nm) at an H2Se gas pressure of 10 Pa under static conditions (turbo pump valve closed).
ATM synthesis and spin coating
Ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) films were prepared similar to that of the procedure reported by Müller et al.29 4 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water. A solution of ammonium polysulfide (NH4)2S3 (120 mL, 8%, Fisher Scientific) was added and the mixture was heated under reflux overnight (90 °C). The dark-red precipitate (NH4)2Mo3S13 was filtered and washed with ethanol and water. Subsequently, the powder was heated at 80 °C in 50 mL toluene three times for about 2 h. After filtering and drying, the thiomoybdate precursor material (5.2 g, 93% yield) was obtained as a dark red powder (ESI Fig. 1c†).
10–20 nm thick ATM layers were prepared by spin coating (10–20 cycles) of a 10 mM solution of ATM, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent, onto the WSe2 photocathodes. Because of the high boiling point of DMSO (189 °C), the electrodes were dried in an evacuated desiccator at room temperature for 30 min. After drying, the electrodes were kept at 100 °C in an oven for 2 h. The ATM-coated WSe2 films display a brownish color, see the ESI Fig. 1b.†
Photochemical Pt precipitation
In order to deposit Pt on top of the photocathodes, 1 mM K2PtCl4 (99.99%) was dissolved in a 0.1 M HCl solution. Pt-photodeposition was carried out at an open circuit potential under light exposure (AM 1.5) for 540 s.
Characterization techniques
The structure, phase composition and rocking curves of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical XPert MPD diffractometer (CuKα = 0.15408 nm). The morphology and the chemical element distribution of the films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis (EDX) with a LEO GEMINI 1530 system.
The composition of the film surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (EAl Kα = 1486.74 eV) and a hemispherical XPS analyzer (SPECS Phoibos 100). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed via a He I source (E = 21.218 eV).
The morphology was studied using an optical microscope (Leica DM 6000 M). Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Solver Spectrum NT-MDT system with a 532 nm laser excitation wavelength.
Surface photovoltage measurements
Surface photovoltage (SPV)48 detects the light-induced change of the contact potential difference between a sample surface and a transparent reference electrode (SnO2:F). SPV signals are proportional to the amount of charge separated in the space and to the distance between the centers of positive and negative charges.49 The illumination was performed with a halogen lamp and a quartz prism monochromator (intensity 0.8 mW cm−2 at 830 nm).30,50
The SPV signals were coupled with a fixed capacitor and a high impedance buffer in modulated SPV spectroscopy.51 Modulated SPV spectra contain in-phase and phase-shifted by 90° signals. The in-phase signals are fast in relation to the modulation period (8 Hz for the given experiments), i.e. the charge separation and the relaxation are much faster than half of the modulation period. In contrast, the phase-shifted by 90° signals are slow in relation to the modulation period. Therefore, the analysis of in-phase and phase-shifted by 90° signals allows for some conclusions about the dynamics of charge carriers separated in the space (ESI Fig. 3†).
PEC measurements
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of the cathodes was performed in a cell with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl and AgCl solution) reference electrode using a potentiostat (EG&G Princeton Applied Research, model 273A). The illumination of the photocathode was performed by using a solar simulator (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, WACOM, model WXS-505-5H). The WSe2 films TiN:O back contact was connected to a metallic wire using an adhesive Ag metal sheet with an In–Ga liquid eutectic added. The linear line scans were measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, whereas the illumination was periodically chopped for 2 s (dark/light) in sulfuric acid 0.5 M H2SO4 (99.99%).
We tested different regions of the 8 samples (120 nm thick films), where each sample has an area of 3 cm2. 25% of the 120 nm thick films have shown the photocurrent densities higher than 2.4 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, where the maximum photocurrent reached was 3 mA cm−2. We tested four regions of the 2 samples of 200 nm thickness, where all regions exhibited a photocurrent density of about 4 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE. Six regions of 4 samples with 350 nm thickness have shown an average photocurrent density of 4.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.
For the assessment of the catalytic activity of the ATM/WSe2 photocathode, a carbon (C) counter electrode is used instead of a Pt counter electrode, since in acidic electrolyte Pt particles could be oxidatively etched from the Pt counter electrode and reductively deposited on the working electrode. From the beginning, we checked 8 IV cycles using the C counter electrode and further 2 IV cycles using the Pt counter electrode. However, the performance of the ATM/WSe2 photocathode remains almost similar to that of the Pt and C counter electrodes, which proves that there is no influence of Pt particles on the working electrode that could increase the photocurrent density (ESI Fig. 2b†).
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a LOT (LSH302) lamp and Acton Research monochromator (SP2150). The IPCE values were calculated as follows:  here, Jp(λ) is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2) induced using the ATM/WSe2 photocathode and Iλ(λ) is the incident light power density (mW cm−2) for each wavelength, where λ is measured in nm. The Iλ(λ) was measured for front side illumination through the sulfuric acid electrolyte at the quartz glass surface. The APCE was determined as the relation of the IPCE to the absorption spectrum:APCE = IPCE/absorption

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of WSe2 films on quartz glass, crystallized in the presence of a Pd-promoter layer. The first and second numbers correspond to the WSe2 and Pd thicknesses, respectively. The pronounced (00.2l) (l = 1–5) diffraction peaks indicate the strong (00.1) texture of the films. The bar diagram at the bottom displays the powder diffraction pattern of WSe2 (JCDPS 38-1388). (b) The intensity and FWHM values of the (00.2) peak and the coherently diffracting domain sizes (crystallite thicknesses) d as a function of the WSe2 film thickness. (c) The rocking curves of the (00.2) diffraction peak for the WSe2/Pd films. (d) The intensity and FWHM of the rocking curves as a function of the WSe2 film thickness. All samples were crystallized at a temperature of 550 °C and at a pressure of 10 Pa in an H2Se atmosphere.	 

 	Fig. 2  XPS spectra of pristine WSe2 and ATM/WSe2 films for (a) tungsten 4f, (b) selenium 3d, and (c) molybdenum 3d regions. (d) XPS spectra of the sulfur 2p region showing the presence of two 2p3/2/2p1/2 doublets: first doublet (pink) corresponds to terminal ligands S22− and apical ligand S2− and second doublet (violet) arises from the bridging ligands S22− of [Mo3S13]2− clusters. The “thinned” ATM films were photoelectrochemically treated in 0.5 M H2SO4, see the ESI Fig. 2a.†	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Surface photovoltage (SPV) as a function of the photon energy of the TiN:O back contact, pristine WSe2, Pt/WSe2 and ATM/WSe2 thin films (120 nm thick film). (b) PV amplitudes normalized to the photon flux of the ATM-WSe2/TiN:O, WSe2/TiN:O and Pt–WSe2/TiN:O. The black and blue lines are fits to the exponential tails below the excitonic A transition for ATM-WSe2/TiN:O and WSe2/TiN:O, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Energy band diagram of the ATM/WSe2 junction in relation to the redox potentials for 2H+/H2 and 4H+, O2/2H2O. The work function for ATM/WSe2 is plotted at 1 V vs. RHE. (b) Fermi level (FL) alignment diagram of the pristine WSe2, Pt/WSe2 and ATM/WSe2, Pt/ATM/WSe2 junctions, where EF is the FL of the pristine WSe2 and ΔΦ is the FL of WSe2 after coating with Pt, ATM and Pt/ATM.	 

 	Fig. 5  Raman spectra of a WSe2 film, ATM crystallites (exfoliated from an ATM film), and ATM/WSe2 heterojunction crystals (exfoliated from an ATM/WSe2 film) for a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Chopped linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves for ATM, WSe2 and ATM/WSe2 on a TiN:O back contact in 0.5 M H2SO4 upon illumination (AM 1.5). (b) Chopped photocurrent density versus time (light/dark times were 10 s each) of the ATM/WSe2 photocathodes as a function of the WSe2 thickness at 0 VRHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 upon AM 1.5 illumination. (c) Dependence of the photocurrent density at 0 VRHE on the thickness of the WSe2 film upon AM 1.5 illumination. (d) Optical absorption spectra, incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) for ATM/WSe2 photocathodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 at −0.1 V vs. RHE.
