    , Accepted 5th May 2020First published on 5th May 2020AbstractInorganic hybrid materials have promising applications in absorbers and for the photon harvesting of solar irradiation, such as in DSSC photoanodes. Moreover, investigation of the interactions between the photoanode constituent materials is extremely important, since it is known that the properties of the materials are strongly dependent on the nucleation and growth process. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to synthesize a system consisting of a synergic combination of two inorganic hosts, BaTiO3 and CaF2, synthesized together through a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, which allows single-phase materials to be obtained after short synthesis times and at low temperatures. The increase in optical activity was investigated after the insertion of Eu ions. From the structural results, it was possible to observe that the method used to obtain the system was efficient, even using temperatures as low as 140 °C and a reaction time of one minute. The optical properties (emission and excitation) were evaluated in the visible and VUV region from 2.5 to 10.5 eV. The XANES Eu LIII edge differences associated with the XEOL results indicate that the synthesis method incorporated Eu3+ in the hosts and the surface of the two compounds, BaTiO3 and CaF2. Therefore, the combination between the Eu3+ activators and the F centers of the host increased the range for photon harvesting, making these systems a promising material for future applications in photoanodes for DSSCs.
1 Introduction
In the last few decades, the changeover of energy sources from fossil fuels to renewable resources has increased due to environmental concerns. Solar cells appear to be a natural solution for this because sunlight is abundantly available at the Earth's surface. However, the low photoelectric conversion efficiency (15%–17%) represents a challenge for large scale commercial use.1,2 This low efficiency occurs because more than 90% of commercial solar cells are based on crystalline silicon and have low sensitivity in the ultraviolet wavelength region.1 Moreover, Si-based solar cells have a high production cost and rigidity, which are major disadvantages.2 Recent efforts in materials science have pointed to a new kind of cell, Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs), but the low power conversion efficiency is still a barrier.2
New materials, such as BaTiO3 and other alkaline earth perovskites, have been tested in DSSCs in order to increase their efficiency. They can be used as photoanode compounds to enhance the photovoltaic response, mainly the Voc of these cells.3–9 The photoanode consists of an oxide, which provides a surface area for dye absorption. The efficiency of DSSCs is strongly linked to the structural and optical characteristics of this component. Recently, an interesting aspect that has been discussed in the literature is the introduction of double-layer fluorides on the photoanode in order to improve efficiency. Such materials act as a barriers for electronic recombination in the photoanode and, as a consequence, the energy conversion efficiency in DSSCs is increased.10–14 Among the fluorides used are NaYF4, LaF3, YF3 and CaF2, which are wide band gap materials.15,16 Among them, CaF2 is a compound widely investigated due to its optical properties that can be enhanced by the insertion of dopant ions, such as lanthanide elements.17
Eu-doped CaF2 has been well explored for applications as scintillators, detectors and wavelength converters in solar cells.11,18 The typical emission transitions of Eu2+ and Eu3+ upon UV radiation comprise a wide range in the visible spectrum.19,20 Such characteristics can be combined with BaTiO3 through a coating system to enhance the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The synergy of compounds can produce the best conditions for a photoanode, improving absorption in the UV region as well as blocking electronic recombination. However, a consistent study of the optical and structural properties is necessary before any direct applications in DSSCs. The main aspect that should be investigated is that divalent (Eu2+) and trivalent (Eu3+) states are strongly influenced by the synthesis parameters used to obtain the compound.21
Eu-doped CaF2 synthesis is already well established in the literature using different chemical routes: sol–gel,22,23 precipitation,24 hydrothermal,25 and microwave.26 Among these methods, the microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MAH) route presents some advantages, such as avoiding the use of toxic solvents, as used in the sol–gel route, and a small quantity of absorbed water, which avoids pyrohydrolysis.27,28 Furthermore, this route allows rapid nucleation and growth of fluoride materials in a short time (5 min) and at low temperature (140 °C).28–30 Depending on the applicability, the MAH method is used to obtain different nanomaterial architectures: core–shell, nanotubes, nanosheets, quantum dots, nanowires, nanorods, and nanorings,31 among others. As an example, Ferhi and co-authors obtained composites with Eu doping using a conventional hydrothermal method in which the coating process (core–shell) was performed for 24 hours in an autoclave.1
In this work, a system of BaTiO3 decorated with Eu-doped CaF2 (BaTiO3@CaF2) is proposed in order to improve the applicability in DSSCs. It is expected that the Eu-doped fluoride matrix will increase the region for the photon harvesting of solar irradiation. For this proposal, the decoration of BaTiO3 nanoparticles was done during the synthesis of CaF2 using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. Besides the already mentioned advantages of the MAH method, it is also possible to control the composition of both phases in the system. Structural and optical analyses were carried out for undoped and Eu-doped BaTiO3@CaF2 systems. For the sake of comparison, Eu-doped BaTiO3 and Eu-doped CaF2 were also synthesized and characterized.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of BaTiO3 particles
BaTiO3 particles were synthesized using 0.01 mol of barium chloride (BaCl2·8H2O, 99%, Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water. Then, the same proportion (0.01 mol) of titanium isopropoxide (Ti[OH(CH3)2]4, 97%, Sigma Aldrich) was added dropwise to the barium solution. After mixing these two precursors, 6 M of potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85%, Synth), previously dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water, was added. The solution was transferred to a reaction cell after homogenization. This cell was coupled to a microwave oven adapted to hydrothermal synthesis and heated up to 140 °C for 20 minutes. The hydrothermal reaction was stabilized at a pressure of 0.4 MPa. After that, the precipitate powders were washed repeatedly with deionized water until the pH reached 7.0, in order to eliminate reaction residues. This washing procedure has been demonstrated to eliminate residues satisfactorily, as pointed out through analysis of the chemical composition of BaTiO3 in previous work.32 The solution was dried on a hot plate at 80 °C for approximately 12 hours, and a white BaTiO3 powder was obtained. The next step was the decoration of BaTiO3 powders with the CaF2 precursor solution (undoped and Eu-doped). Eu-doped CaF2 was synthesized using the same precursor solution used to decorate the BaTiO3 particles as a comparison for optical characterization.
2.2 CaF2 precursor solution preparation
The preparation of the CaF2 solutions followed the procedures developed by Bezerra and Valerio.28 For the undoped CaF2 solution, calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 99.9%, Neon) was dissolved in 25 ml of distilled water. An ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 99.9%, Neon) solution was also prepared with the same amount of distilled water in a separate container. For the Eu-doped solution, 0.03 mol of europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3, 99.99%, Sigma Aldrich) was added to the calcium solution, decreasing the stoichiometric amount of the Ca nitrate precursor. After completion of these steps, the ammonium fluoride solution was added into the solution containing the calcium source and homogenized for approximately 20 minutes. The decoration of BaTiO3 powder was performed during the process of CaF2 synthesis in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, as will be discussed below. For the synthesis of Eu-doped CaF2, the microwave hydrothermal reaction was performed at 140 °C for 1 min; under these conditions the self-generated pressure inside the vessel reached 0.3 MPa.
2.3 Synthesis of CaF2 decorated BaTiO3 (BaTiO3@CaF2)
For the synthesis of the system consisting of BaTiO3 decorated with CaF2, a 1:1 molar ratio of BaTiO3 to CaF2 was used. First, the desired amount of BaTiO3 was dispersed in distilled water by using an ultrasonic bath for about 5 minutes. After that, the undoped or Eu-doped CaF2 precursor solution was added to the BaTiO3 suspension under stirring in order to form BaTiO3@CaF2 or BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu, respectively. The hydrothermal reaction used the parameters described in section 2.2. For comparison, a synthesis was conducted with the dispersion of BaTiO3 particles, following the same steps described above in the presence of a solution containing only Eu ions. For this, 0.03 mol of europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3, 99.99%, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in distilled water. This solution was added to the BaTiO3 solution and subjected to hydrothermal reaction in a microwave oven with the same parameters utilized for the previous samples.
2.4 Characterization
The crystallographic phases of the powders were identified by X-ray diffraction techniques using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKλ tube, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, in a 2θ range of 15 to 75° with a pitch of 0.02°. Crystallographic standards obtained from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), accessed via CAPES Periodicals Portal, were utilized to identify the XRD patterns. A short-range structural analysis was performed via Raman spectroscopy with a Renishaw inVia micro-Raman spectrometer at room temperature with an excitation laser of 535 nm in a facility installed in the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory. The scan was performed in the range of 150 to 900 cm−1. The shape and particle size were characterized with a transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV and a current of 108 μA, using ST and diffraction mode. The electron microscopy analysis was performed with JEM 2100, JEOL at LNNano/CNPEM, under proposal number 24421. The prepared samples were made by dispersing powder in isopropyl alcohol solution in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes. A small drop of the suspension was collected and it was deposited in a TEM grid with an ultrathin holey carbon support film.
XANES and XEOL spectra measurements were carried out at the X-ray Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy beamline (XAFS2) at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS/CNPEM) under proposal 20171047.33 BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu and CaF2:Eu samples were analyzed with X-ray excitation energies around the LIII edge of europium (absorption edge in 6977 eV) at room temperature. A special sample dark chamber was developed that is equipped with an optical fiber connected to a QE65000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics) that was used to record the XEOL signal while XANES measurements were performed using fluorescence mode. The XEOL emission of the dopant-free BaTiO3@CaF2 was performed in the SXS beamline (LNLS/CNPEM) under proposal 20170442. The photoluminescence spectra of the samples were investigated in the excitation range from 5.6 to 11 eV in the TGM beamline (LNLS/CNPEM) at room temperature under proposals 20190133 and 20180002.34 The sample was kept inside a vacuum chamber that allows the recording of the emission spectra using an optical fiber vacuum feedthrough attached to an Ocean Optics QE65000 spectrometer. As the excitation scans the above-mentioned energy range, a MgF2 thin filter (200 μm in thickness) was used to cut out the higher harmonics of the beamline monochromator and was also used to check the energy calibration of the excitation monochromator.35 The absorption of an Al sheet, registered in Total Electron Yield (TEY) mode, was used to normalize the intensity of the samples, correcting for the variation of the excitation beam intensity.35 Additionally, excitation spectra were measured in the visible light region (190 to 500 nm, or 2.5 to 6.5 eV). For the Eu-doped samples, the excitation spectra were obtained by fixing the emission wavelength at 615 nm, which corresponds to an emission line of Eu3+. These measurements were performed using a tabletop ISS PCI spectrofluorimeter with a 550 nm SCHOTT high-pass optical filter in the emission detection. The excitation spectra were captured by a HAMAMATSU R928 photomultiplier tube coupled to the electronic detection system.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern for the Eu-doped BaTiO3@CaF2 system. All diffraction peaks were identified to the BaTiO3 or CaF2 cubic phases when compared to the standard ICSD cc99-736 and cc35-816, respectively. No amorphous band or secondary phase was identified, suggesting that the Eu ions are completely incorporated in the host matrix. In addition, no XRD peak due to the BaCO3 pattern is visualized. This is quite a common phase that appears in many barium titanate synthesis routes36 and that is undesirable for the purpose of the present work.

These results indicate that the sample synthesis route was able to crystallize the two desirable phases, despite the short time and reasonably simple synthesis route. This fact may lead to distortions in the local structure that may cause changes in the luminescence characteristics of the Eu ions. Therefore, a detailed structural investigation becomes necessary to answer the questions: where are the Eu ions located in the BaTiO3@CaF2 system and how may their luminescence features be used for applications in DSSCs? These two questions cannot be answered by the XRD technique alone.
In general, materials with cubic symmetry have no active Raman vibrational modes. Thus, the presence of Raman vibrational modes indicates distortions in the lattice structure and, in this sense, Raman is very useful for detecting local distortions in the lattice. Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 2; some peaks are clearly resolved, indicating that at least one of the two cubic phases, previously identified by XRD, present local distortions. In this case, these modes are typical of the tetragonal structure of barium titanate and can be explained by internal distortions in the crystalline structure36 mainly caused by the Ti ions moving off-centre in the TiO6 octahedra. This behaviour is an important characteristic of the cubic to tetragonal phase transition of BaTiO3 and can only be detected by techniques that investigate short-range order. As discussed in the literature, the most intense modes at 304 (P3) and 716 (P5) cm−1 are related to the TiO6 elongation for the longitudinal modes B1 (LO + TO) and A1 (LO), respectively,37 while modes 184 (P1) and 514 (P4) cm−1 are predicted as transverse modes of symmetry, A1 (TO).38

No Raman modes could be assigned to CaF2, meaning that CaF2 in the BaTiO3@CaF2 system preserves its original cubic structure even at short range. The red line in Fig. 2 represents the BaTiO3@CaF2 system without Eu doping and shows no additional modes (when compared to the Raman spectrum of just BaTiO3) due to the CaF2 decoration. It can also be seen that upon decoration with CaF2, there is a slight increase in the relative intensity of the Raman modes, indicating that the interaction of BaTiO3 with CaF2 can enhance the BaTiO3 distortion due to lattice mismatch. Nevertheless, for the Eu-doped system, an increase in the intensity of the vibrational modes can be seen (green line in Fig. 2) and this increase could be associated with possible interactions of the Eu ions with BaTiO3, either in the bulk or on the surface of the BaTiO3 particles.

Fig. 3 shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples. As expected, the system consists of two compounds with different shapes and sizes. Fig. 3(a) displays a set of agglomerates on the order of hundreds of nanometers consisting of several smaller particles and another type of particle with an oval shape a few tenths of a nanometer in size. These two types of particles are more evident in Fig. 3(b), where it is possible to see small particles organized in spheres with nanometric size, some smaller than 10 nm, and oval shaped particles with sizes ranging from 50–200 nm. These bigger particles also present a crystalline organization and some crystalline planes can be seen. An analysis of these planes demonstrated an average distance between planes of 3.19 Å, consistent with the (1 1 1) crystalline plane of CaF2 (see inset in Fig. 3(b)). Furthermore, the presence of CaF2 is evidenced by particles of a lighter gray color (less contrast) than those of BaTiO3; this could be expected since the effective atomic number of BaTiO3 is bigger than the effective Z of CaF2. Fig. 3(c) shows one example of a TEM micrograph of CaF2 synthesized following the same procedure used for the BaTiO3@CaF2 sample. It is remarkable that the size of the CaF2 particles decreased considerably in the presence of BaTiO3, compared to the sample containing only CaF2. It is worth noting that the crystalline CaF2 and BaTiO3 samples were produced in a much shorter time than reported in the literature.28

For rigorous analysis of these different kinds of particles, electron diffraction (ED) was carried out on the BaTiO3@CaF2 system (see Fig. 3(d)). In order to be able to identify the diffraction peaks, firstly ED was realized for the isolated compounds, BaTiO3 and CaF2, to quantify the lattice spacing values for each compound. As discussed previously, the (1 1 1) plane of CaF2 is identified at a distance of 3.1 Å, whereas the (1 1 1) plane of BaTiO3 has a lattice spacing value of 2.3 Å. Thus, the distances of these corresponding planes are indicated in Fig. 3(d), confirming that the BaTiO3@CaF2 system consists of the two compounds. As the Eu content is very low (0.03 mol), it is not possible to visualize differences in BaTiO3 and/or CaF2 morphology. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the interaction of Eu ions with the system through other characterization techniques. Firstly, we performed Eu ion valence analyses, in order to verify whether differences occur between the system and the isolated compounds.

Fig. 4 shows the first derivative of the XANES spectrum around the LIII edge of europium for the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu and CaF2:Eu samples synthesized under the same conditions. There is a predominance of the Eu3+ species, with an absorption edge located around 6981 eV, for both samples. A small shoulder located at 6974 eV can be seen in the CaF2:Eu sample that can be assigned to the presence of the Eu2+ species. It has been reported that divalent Eu emission is dominant for lower Eu concentrations, whereas trivalent emission becomes dominant with increased Eu doping levels of CaF2.39 Teixeira and co-authors also reported this behaviour for Eu-doped LiAl5O3.40 In order to estimate the amount of Eu2+ and Eu3+ in the samples, XANES profile fitting was done using Athena software for X-ray absorption analysis.41 The absorption jump was modelled with an arctan function taking into account the maximum position of the Eu2+ and Eu3+ peaks. From the fitting it is possible to estimate that 95.4% of the Eu content is in the Eu3+ form and 4.6% is found as Eu2+.
 Fig. 4  Derivative curves of the XANES of BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu and CaF2:Eu around the Eu-LIII edge. 
These differences between the two compounds are more evident in the XEOL emission spectra when X-ray photon energies are around the Eu-LIII edge (absorption edge at 6980 eV). A representation of the XEOL emission is shown in Fig. 5(a) by an International Commission on Illumination (CIE) chromaticity coordinate diagram. The coordinates (0.208, 0.072) and (0.407, 0.241) correspond to CaF2:Eu and BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu, respectively.

We can see that the predominance of violet color for the CaF2:Eu sample is mainly caused by the 4f65d1 → 4f7 transitions of Eu2+,19 also visualized and identified in the Fig. 5(b). This emission band is more intense than the 4f → 4f emissions of Eu3+ in the range of 580–700 nm20,42 because they are allowed transitions, while the 4f → 4f transitions in Eu3+ are partially forbidden due to the Laporte rule, which means that the probability of a 5d to 4f transition is much higher than a 4f to 4f transition.20 This result indicates that the CaF2 matrix favors the +2 oxidation state instead of the +3 oxidation state of europium in the host system. This assertion is supported by the emissions observed for the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu system, visualized in Fig. 5 as a purplish pink color curve. The predominant emission is now due to the trivalent Eu species, and this also means that when CaF2:Eu is synthesized in the presence of BaTiO3 particles, Eu in the trivalent form is preferable, meaning that Eu not only interacts with the CaF2 host but may also interact with the BaTiO3 surface. This feature represents a great advantage for solar cell applications because the Eu3+ 4f → 4f reddish emission covers the region of the maximum absorption spectral response of the N-3 dye (500 to 700 nm) used in DSSCs. The N-3 dye is mainly responsible for the absorption of photons with subsequent energy conversion into the conduction band of the photoanode of the solar cell. If BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu is the photoanode, then a self-excitation process can be originated. The presence of defects and/or synergetic interactions between the two compounds can also promote an alignment of the bands, leading to the improvement of the Voc in cells. This is already discussed in studies involving heterojunctions in cells, since Voc is directly related to the Fermi level of the photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte.9

Fig. 5(b) shows a band located between 250 and 320 nm, which is not related to the presence of Eu. Therefore, the XEOL emission spectra for the dopant-free BaTiO3@CaF2 system were also measured around the K edge of Ca (Fig. 5(c)). Two bands were observed centered at 287 and 427 nm. These two main bands have already been identified by Bezerra et al. in the investigation of CaF2 particles produced by a microwave hydrothermal method.28 The first emission band is in the range mentioned in Fig. 5(b) and is ascribed to the STE luminescence of the CaF2 host matrix.43 The band at 427 nm is associated with F centres, commonly found in a fluoride-based matrix.28,43 These results indicate that the defects present in the CaF2 host also contribute to the luminescence signals of the samples.

Fig. 6 shows the excitation spectra of BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu (black line), CaF2:Eu (red line) and BaTiO3:Eu (blue line) with emission fixed at 615 nm, monitoring the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+. The two main peaks centered at 394 nm (3.1 eV) and 467 nm (2.65 eV) are assigned to the 4f–4f transitions: 7F0 → 5L6 and 7F0 → 5D2, respectively. The 7F0 → 5D2 transition was identified by Hernandez and co-authors44 for samples of Eu3+-doped BaTiO3 synthesized through a hydrothermal method. The 7F0 → 5L6 transition is typically found in fluoride-based hosts, while the 7F0 → 5D2 transition is not common in this type of compound.45 These two peaks also appear in the Eu-doped BaTiO3 sample (blue line). Also, in Fig. 6, the band centered at around 4.2 eV (295 nm) is typically assigned to the Eu–O charge transfer band (CTB) in many works.46,47 This assignment was not possible since the BaTiO3 band gap is 3.4 eV,48 that is 0.8 eV lower than the peak value of this band, and CTBs in crystalline hosts must necessarily be within the host band gap. The results clearly indicate that the related band is only characteristic of Eu-doped BaTiO3. This means that the Eu ions interact with the BaTiO3 crystals, forming a BaTiO3 doped system during the synthesis of the system. This is possible if BaTiO3 crystals are considered to be solubilized and subsequently recrystallized during the hydrothermal process.49 Another possible reason for observing this excitation band at around 4.2 eV in the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu system is the presence of oxygen groups (either as O2− ions or as OH− species) in small amounts in the CaF2 host, as was previously reported in fluorides produced by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method,28 but the fact that the same band is not seen in the CaF2:Eu spectrum (see red line in Fig. 6) makes this latter hypothesis impossible. A detailed spectroscopic study in the near-UV to VUV spectral region was carried out to elucidate the influence of the Eu dopant on the BaTiO3@CaF2 system, allowing a better understanding of the presence of Eu2+ and Eu3+ in the compound. In Fig. 7 the excitation spectrum shows the tracked lines monitoring the main emissions for Eu2+ and Eu3+ at 430 and 615 nm, respectively. The Eu3+ emission, in the range between 4.5 and 7.0 eV (see Fig. 7a), has three different excitation bands. The first two bands centered at 5.0 eV and 6.0 eV were also observed by Kamenskikh and co-workers50 for an Eu-doped BaTiO3 sample. They were attributed to electron–hole radiationless channels due the presence of intrinsic defects that are also responsible for the phosphorescence emission in Eu-doped BaTiO3. The third band is centered at 7.0 eV and is observed as an excitation broad band that has been identified in Eu-doped fluoride materials and attributed to the CTB between F and Eu3+.51–53 Unlike the earlier discussion of Fig. 6, in this case, the presence of CTB in CaF2–Eu3+ is highly plausible since the bandgap of CaF2 is around 11.8 eV. These results indicate that a small amount of Eu3+ was formed in CaF2, even considering that most of the Eu dopant was incorporated as a divalent species in the CaF2 matrix, as indicated by the result in Fig. 5. As for Eu2+ emission at 430 nm, the excitation spectrum shows two broad bands between 5.0–7.0 eV and 7.5–9.5 eV (see Fig. 7b). According to work based on fluoride hosts, the band between 7.5 and 9.5 eV can be assigned to 4f–5d transitions of Eu2+.54 This transition is parity allowed and is due to the promotion of one electron from the 7F0 ground state of the 4f6 configuration to the excited 4f55d1 state, as discussed in Fig. 5. An excitation band is observed at around 10.0 eV that is just observable for 430 nm emission. This excitation band is attributed to the excitonic absorption, as reported in the literature,28,43 and this result can be explained by the superposition of the Eu2+ emission with the intrinsic emission of CaF2 at around 428 nm.28 Therefore, the excitation band observed between 5.0–7.0 eV may be related to intrinsic defects in the CaF2 host.

 Fig. 7  Excitation spectra of Eu-doped BaTiO3@CaF2 in the range from 4.5 to 10.5 eV with the emission fixed at 615 nm (a) and 430 nm (b). 
To corroborate these assumptions, Fig. 8 shows the emission spectra for the undoped BaTiO3@CaF2 system monitored at three different excitation energies, 5.8, 7.0 and 8.5 eV. As can be seen, the band with the maximum at 440 nm, due to the F centre, has the highest intensity with the excitation energy at 5.8 eV, which decreases as the energy increases. The same behavior is shown for the band at 316 nm assigned to the STE of the CaF2 host.

In Fig. 9a, the emission with a maximum around 424 nm is assigned to the allowed electron dipole transition from the excited state of the 4f65d1 configuration to the 4f7 ground state55,56 of Eu2+. However, the broad band between 400–500 nm may also have a contribution from F centres, as discussed earlier. This may explain the small difference between the behavior of this band for the Eu-doped BaTiO3@CaF2 system and for the CaF2:Eu sample. In Fig. 9b it is possible to visualize the presence of the Eu3+ and Eu2+ transitions of CaF2:Eu, consistent with the XANES spectra results around the Eu LIII edge, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5.
 Fig. 9  Emission spectra of BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu (a) and CaF2:Eu (b) with excitation energy at 5.9 eV. 
The main lines exhibited in the emission spectra are associated with the transitions from the 5D0 excited state to the ground levels 7FJ (J = 1–4)22 for both samples, Eu-doped BaTiO3@CaF2 and Eu-doped CaF2. The peak located at 613 nm is assigned to the electric dipole 5D0 → 7F2 transition, which is strongly related to the local symmetry where Eu3+ ions are located. The 5D0 → 7F1 transition that appears at 591 nm is attributed to the magnetic dipole transition. In the literature, it is common to use the intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions39,57,58 as a qualitative evaluation of the local symmetry site around Eu ions. In this case, the 5D0 → 7F2 transition is dominant, meaning that the Eu3+ ions are located in a site symmetry without an inversion center for the CaF2:Eu and BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu systems. A small emission line is observed at 653 nm, related to the 5D0 → 7F3 transition of Eu3+. Generally, the 5D0 → 7F3 transition has a very weak intensity due to the forbidden electric dipole transition. The 5D0 → 7F4 transition located around 691 nm has characteristics similar to 5D0 → 7F2; however, with a weaker intensity and no hypersensitivity.20
It is important to highlight that the Eu3+ transitions are dominant for the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu system across the whole excitation energy range. At the same time, the (5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F1) intensity ratio increased up to 2.54. These results allowed the conclusion that Eu ions occupy sites with lower symmetry in BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu than those observed for CaF2:Eu, including the possibility that part of the Eu content could be located at the surfaces of the particles. This could be due to two factors: the decrease of the grain size of CaF2 particles, or the influence of BaTiO3 particles on the local environment of the Eu3+ ions. It is known that the increase of particles could increase the intensity of the 5D0 → 7F1 transition, and therefore reduce the population of non-inversion symmetry Eu3+ sites.59 However, there is also the possibility that the hydrothermal reaction may promote the interaction of the Eu ions with the two compounds, BaTiO3 and CaF2, as has already been discussed throughout this work. Thus, there is a non-negligible probability that the PL emission of the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu sample could directly excite N-3 dye, becoming a photoanode in the solar cell with a single deposition step. In conclusion, the decoration of BaTiO3 with CaF2:Eu shows an interesting synergic effect that can increase the efficiency of DSSCs by improving the photon harvesting of solar irradiation.
4 Conclusions
In summary, it was noted that the methodology employed influenced the luminescence properties of Eu-doped materials. The microwave-assisted hydrothermal method ensured that the system was obtained within quite a short synthesis time and at low temperature. This was observed by XRD patterns that showed only the BaTiO3 and CaF2 phases. The Raman spectroscopy results indicated structural disorder of BaTiO3 with Raman active vibrational modes. The intensity of these modes was increased with Eu doping. Structural investigation following the Raman results indicated that Eu ions may be interacting with BaTiO3 and taking part in the distortion. TEM images showed nanometer-sized particles with morphologies that indicate interactions between the two parts of the system and demonstrate that the CaF2 particles are more ordered than BaTiO3. XANES analyses around the absorption edge of Eu indicated the predominance of the Eu3+ species in the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu system and CaF2:Eu sample. The presence of Eu2+ was only detected for the CaF2 sample and induced a change in the XEOL emission spectra. This difference in luminescence behavior became more evident in the emission and excitation spectra in the visible and VUV range. The results demonstrated that Eu3+ transitions are more intense in BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu than in the CaF2:Eu samples, again indicating an interaction between the two parts of the system. From these results, we concluded that the combination of the two compounds forming the BaTiO3@CaF2:Eu system broadens the range for the photon harvesting of solar irradiation, making this system a good candidate for future applications in DSSCs without the need to add a wavelength converter.
