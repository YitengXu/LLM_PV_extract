    , Accepted 4th November 2019First published on 4th November 2019AbstractSolar steam generation appears as an emerging green strategy due to its potential applications in water desalination, power generation and chemical purification. Although a variety of efforts have been devoted to developing high-efficiency solar steam generation devices, a number of challenges remain, including the relatively low thermal efficiency, the complicated process, the high cost, and the difficulty in cycling. Herein, inspired by the natural water transportation in plants, a cheap carrot-inspired solar thermal evaporator (ethanol-treated-carrot biochar, ECB) has been reported by utilizing its inherent structure, which achieves a record high evaporation rate of 2.04 kg m−2 h−1 and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 127.8% under one-sun illumination. The inherent structure not only enables sufficient water transportation, but also offers a high light-to-heat conversion efficiency originating from the carbonized surface. Furthermore, the excellent durability and environmental stability of the biochar allow for convenient recycling programs and practical applications.
Introduction
Clean water shortage, a serious worldwide issue, has goaded people to produce clean water from various measures. Among them, solar-driven water evaporation has gained enormous attention due to its environmentally friendly characteristics and can be used for seawater desalination and purification. In order to improve the photothermal conversion efficiency for practical applications, tremendous attempts have been focused on three main aspects, including increasing the photothermal conversion efficiency,1–10 producing the hydrophilic and porous self-floating substrates11–20 and reducing the heat conduction loss.17,18,21,22 Previous studies on high efficiency solar steam generation generally include complicated structures and fabrication processes. For typical photothermal devices, the light absorber and the water transporter are separated. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the thermal efficiency while very limited work has been reported to optimize the water transporter at the same time. Also, chemicals used in traditional absorbers may have uncertain environmental risks. Therefore, an efficient, environment-friendly, low-cost, and all-in-one solar thermal evaporator is potentially interesting from both theoretical and practical points of view.
Scientists have tried to use some biological materials as efficient water transportation devices by taking advantage of their intrinsic characteristics. In nature, plants have an inherent ability to transport water from the ground to the leaf blade surface and to absorb light to germinate. For example, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the transpiration efficiency can be enhanced or suppressed through engineering the solar absorber–leaf interface, by covering the leaf surface with carbon black or polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber materials.23 They also presented that the carbonized mushrooms as an efficient solar steam generation reached a conversion efficiency of 78% under one-sun illumination due to their umbrella-shaped black pileus, porous context, and fibrous stipe with a small cross section.24 Hu et al. reported a cost-effective and scalable yet still highly efficient absorber made up of traditional wood, where the carbonized surface can utilize almost all the incident sunlight.25 The aforementioned results prove that biochar is important in photothermal water desalination and purification and is more economical and environment-friendly as compared to conventional photothermal materials. However, the water evaporation rates of the reported materials, typically lower than 1.5 kg m−2 h−1, should be further improved for practical applications, which require fine selection and modification of biological materials.
As for natural carrots, their inner body has plenty of plant cells which can transport water and nutrients for growth. The cytoderm is an important part of carrots which maintains the high hardness and protects the cells. Herein, we have developed ethanol-treated-carrot biochar (ECB), for the first time, as an all-in-one self-floating photothermal device to realize high-efficiency solar water evaporation. The water transportation occurs through the internal longitudinal channels and then the water is taken up to the surface of the carrot, where the evaporation takes place. The ECB solar thermal evaporator possesses a high water evaporation rate of 2.04 kg m−2 h−1 and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of ∼127.8% with a net efficiency close to 100% under one-sun illumination. In this way, several square meters of the ECB evaporator will provide a daily water supply for a dozen of people (2–3 L for one person per day). Our ECB solar thermal evaporator presents excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and low-cost, easy-to-produce, high durable and environment-friendly features and shows great potential in this emerging green technology.
Experimental
Materials fabrication
Carrots used in the experiment were purchased from a local market. These carrots were first cut into pieces along the growth direction, with a thickness of approximately 1 cm. The carrots were soaked in ethanol solution for 2 days to be dehydrated, which in the meantime removed the β-carotene and lignin from the carrot to widely open the internal channel. After the treatment, the carrots were dried in a drying oven at 50 °C for 12 h. Finally, these carrots were all put together in a tube furnace and heated at 550 °C in argon for 30 min with the rate of 5 °C min−1. The ECB-550 was obtained after the pyrolysis.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the carbonized carrots were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a Carl Zeiss MERLIN compact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X spectrometer, using monochromic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray as the light source. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope by using a Renishaw HPNIR 785 nm semiconductor laser. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrometer, using BaSO4 as the background over a range of 300–2500 nm. The water contact angle was measured using a commercial contact angle system (Biolin optical contact angle measuring instrument, Theta) at ambient temperature using a 10 μL droplet as the indicator. Once the light was on, the mass change was immediately tracked using a high-accuracy balance (Sartorius, GL323-1SCN, 0.1 mg in accuracy) and then communicated in real-time to a computer (with RS 232C serial ports) for calculating the evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency of solar steam generation. Infrared (IR) images and surface temperature fluctuations were recorded using an IR camera (CEM, DT-980). The contents of Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+ and Ni2+ were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using a PerkinElmer Nexion 300.
Experimental setup for solar steam generation
The carrot-based structure can float on the surface of the water without any support, making contact with the bulk water from the bottom side of the carrot. All experiments were conducted at an ambient temperature of ∼25 °C and a humidity of 41%. The whole photothermal experiments were carried out in the homemade system with an optical simulator, an electronic balance and a condensation device. In the process, the fresh water was generated from the interface of the carrot and the seawater, and then the water steam rose above the cold chamber of the condenser (a clean and transparent acrylic board) and condensed. Finally, the fresh water fell into the condenser tube and was collected using a container. The mass change caused by the water evaporation was recorded immediately using an electronic balance and the data were collected by the connected computer. The water evaporation rate was obtained by subtracting the evaporation rate in the dark from the measured rate under one-sun illumination, aiming to calculate the accurate conversion efficiency.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1† shows the detailed process to prepare ECB. The carrot slice was cut perpendicular to the growth direction (approximately 1 cm), acting as both the light absorber and the water transporter at the same time after the pyrolysis. To maintain the structure during the pyrolysis process, the carrot slice needed to be dehydrated first. During the course of soaking in the ethanol solution for preconditioning, the carrot slice gradually lost its original orange colour and changed into white (Fig. S2†). This is due to the fact that the chromogenic substance of β-carotene in carrot was removed from cells by the ethanol (as confirmed by the Raman spectra in Fig. S3†), and at the same time the internal bio-oil was removed, preventing the carrot structure from clogging the capillary channels after the pyrolysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S4† show evidence that the morphology and channel arrangement of biochar are improved after the ethanol treatment. The pyrolysis process was carried out in a tube furnace (the photos of carrots at different pyrolysis temperatures are shown in Fig. S5†). After the pyrolysis, the diameter of the carrot decreases from approximately 5 cm to 3 cm (Fig. S6a†). Obviously, the size of the carrot shrinks by approximately 20% after carbonization. The structure of the natural carrot observed using an optical microscope is shown in Fig. S6b.† The highly porous structures of the carrots after carbonization can be clearly observed by SEM. Fig. 1a presents the porous structures of the ECB, which has an average pore size of ∼37 μm (statistical results are shown in Fig. S7†). The internal structure has shrunken without collapse during the pyrolysis process. These pores serve as microchannels for sufficient water transport and vapour escape.26 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that water and organic matter are completely volatilized in the temperature range of 400–550 °C, and the mass remains almost unchanged after 550 °C (Fig. S8†). According to the structure, we illustrate that the existence of the numerous pores can guarantee good connection between two contiguous cells, which can realize the sufficient water transport from the bulk water to the ECB surface (Fig. 1b) and the steam generation under sun illumination.7,27,28 We have performed X-ray computed tomography (XCT) for reconstructing the ECB structure, as shown in Fig. S9†. The results show that many large holes are distributed on the edge of the sample, while the pores in the central part have a compact connection, both beneficial for good water transport.

To improve the photothermal conversion efficiency, we should focus on the utilization rate of the sunlight. The absorption spectra in the solar spectrum (from 250 to 2500 nm) are shown in Fig. 2a. After the pyrolysis, the ECB-300 (ECB treated at 300 °C) has an overall solar energy absorption of 70.9%, with an absorption of 42.9% in the ultraviolet and visible regions (300–780 nm) and an absorption of 28% in the near-infrared region (780–2500 nm). As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the ECB-550 possesses a higher overall absorption of 85.4%, with an absorption of 40.9% in the ultraviolet and visible regions, and a relatively high absorption of 85.4% in the near-infrared region. These results suggest that the high utilization of sunlight of the ECB is due to the pyrolysis and the surface roughening.24 The biochar substrate with the rough surface can produce multiscattering of the incident solar light, yielding high absorptions of the incident light.28 With further increasing the pyrolysis temperature, we find that the ECB-600 does have a high overall absorption of 88.3% (42.7% in the ultraviolet and visible regions and 45.6% in the near-infrared region). However, a higher solar absorption does not lead to a higher light-to-heat conversion efficiency, which will be discussed later.

The hydrophilic surface is an important characteristic for the water flowing to the heated surface.29 The surface chemical compositions and functional groups of the carbonized carrots have been examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition to C 1s and O 1s, the N 1s signal is also observed in Fig. 2b. The deconvoluted N 1s spectra of carbonized carrots show a strong peak at ∼399.4 eV, corresponding to C–N/N–H. The peaks in FTIR spectra (Fig. 2c) of the carrots are observed at ∼3346 and 1078 cm−1, 3390 and 1111 cm−1, further confirming the existence of the hydrophilic group C–N/N–H. The water contact angle is estimated to be 44.83° (far less than the critical angle of 90°), proving the hydrophilic surface of the ECB, as shown in Fig. 2d. In addition to these advantages, ECB is ultralight with a low density, as demonstrated by a piece of ECB standing on the tip of the grass, without bending or deforming the grass stem (Fig. 2e). The block of ECB has an all-in-one structure which can float on the water without the help of the upholder that is typically required by the traditional thermal materials (Fig. 2f).
We have demonstrated a home-made design to measure the water evaporation rate of the ECB under one-sun illumination. The carbonization of the carrot surface with a large surface area ensures a strong water evaporation. Meanwhile, the heat energy is more easily stored, which decreases the irradiation to the environment and the heat convection loss.24 The vapour generation device was placed in a black optical chamber, lying on the electronic balance which was linked to the computer to record the mass change. Fig. 3a shows the mass change during the water transportation process under one-sun illumination, and the mass change of ECB is as high as 2.04 kg m−2. After 12 h of illumination, the condenser wall was covered with the water droplets (Fig. S10†). We find that the heating rate of the ECB plays a critical role in the evaporation performance. The mass change with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute is only 1.63 kg m−2 h−1 (0.41 kg m−2 h−1 lower than that of ECB with the heating rate of 5 °C per minutes, Fig. S11†), which suggests that a relatively lower heating speed allows the organic compounds inside the carrot to fully volatilize, restraining the formation of an organic oily film on the carrot surface to ensure the continuous water transportation. Fig. 3b shows the stable water evaporation rate of the carrot-based structure over time. A direct comparison is shown in Fig. 3c, demonstrating that the water evaporation of ECB-550 is 5.5 times higher than that of pure water under one-sun illumination. On the other hand, the evaporation performance is not positively related to the overall absorption (the pyrolysis temperature). As we indicated, the ECB-600 possesses a higher light absorption than ECB-550, but a much lower evaporation rate. This result might be attributed to the fact that the cellular structure collapses at a high pyrolysis temperature, disrupting the steadily water transport (Fig. S12†).

To systematically assess the performance of the carrot-inspired solar thermal evaporator, the photothermal conversion efficiency is calculated as23–26 η = mhLV/Coptqin(1)where m is the net evaporation rate of steam generation, Copt is the optical concentration, and qin is the solar irradiation on the surface, and hLV stands for liquid–vapour phase change enthalpy, which can be estimated as hLV = λLV + CpΔT(2)where λLV is the latent heat of water evaporation under the standard atmospheric pressure (2.257 MJ kg−1), Cp represents the specific heat capacity of bulk water (4.2 kJ kg−1 K−1), and ΔT is the temperature variation during the evaporation process. Therefore, the apparent conversion efficiency of ECB can be calculated from the above formula to be 127.8% under one-sun illumination, which is much higher than ECB prepared at other pyrolysis temperatures (ECB-300: 56.1% and ECB-600: 84.3%). This high apparent efficiency ensures the best use of the sunlight and the continuous water transport to yield fresh water. In Fig. 3d we compare our results with those of graphite materials,4,17,18,20,30–32 biological materials19,24,33–36 and some other materials.37,38 ECB-550 shows the highest evaporation rate among the biological materials and the second highest evaporation rate among all materials. Although the graphene foam has a higher water evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m−2 h−1,17 our ECB still shows advantages in terms of the low-cost, easy-to-produce, and environment-friendly features. We also summarized the properties of other photothermal materials reported in recent years (Table S1†). In addition, we switch off the light to mimic the thermal performance under evening conditions. The water evaporation rate decreases to 0.238 kg m−2 h−1 and but remains stable for 4.7 hours (Fig. S13†). This phenomenon proves that the ECB has a good capability of storing energy. Based on this, solar steam generation can still work at the night with the energy that was absorbed during the day.
To better understand the mechanism for the high-efficiency solar-driven water evaporation, the temperature distribution was recorded using an infrared (IR) camera (Fig. 4a). The IR images reveal that the surface temperature of the ECB increases to 97.2 °C after 3600 seconds under one-sun illumination. When being placed on the water surface, the surface temperature of the ECB-550 quickly reaches to 39.5 °C within 30 seconds and then steadily increases to 48.7 °C after 3600 seconds. During the process, the temperature change of the bulk water beneath the ECB-550 is relatively small, i.e. from 25.3 to 29.6 °C. These data indicate that the light-to-heat energy is focused on the top surface of the ECB due to its carbonized cover. The maximum temperatures are plotted in Fig. 4b as a function of the illumination time. COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to simulate the temperature distribution and the water transport in ECB during the water evaporation process (detailed description in the ESI†). In Fig. 4c, the vertical cross section of the micro-channel is simulated as a rectangle (blue, 37.5 μm in width), and the space between the rectangles represents the thin channel walls (gray, 1 μm in thickness), in which the channel curvature is ignored. Next, a simple heat-transfer model is used to describe the temperature distribution in Fig. 4d. The simulation results of the steady-state temperature distribution predict that the maximum temperature in the ECB can be 46.85 °C (320 K) at the top surface, which is in good agreement with our experimental value and therefore confirms that the heat confinement occurs in the ECB. In addition, we use this model to simulate the water transport in the ECB (Fig. 4e). The 2D mapping of the water velocity distribution indicates a fast water transport through the internal microchannels against the surface water loss. The calculated water transport rate from the bottom to the surface was 0.6 μm s−1, which is mainly supported by the microchannels.

It should be noted that the apparent conversion efficiency is as high as 127.8%, which seems to be against the rules of energy conservation. First, the uneven interfacial temperature across the entire carrot-based structure would cause some spatial discrepancies in latent and sensible heat. Considering that the energy efficiency is estimated with the spatially averaged surface temperature across the uneven surface of devices, this calculation may cause the overestimation.24,39,40 Second, the energy recovery mechanism may be reflected in the relatively enclosed environment.39 The temperature of the inner condenser is significantly higher than that of the outer condenser, with a ∼7 °C temperature gradient when the carrot-based structure is exposed to simulated sunlight, despite the thickness of the condenser wall being thinner than 2 mm. The interior is relatively closed and receives the energy generated by the diffuse reflected light and irradiation, and the temperature of the condenser wall slowly increases. With the inner ambient temperature rises, this energy, in turn, reheats the seawater and accelerates the water evaporation. The temperature difference between the inner and the outer and the energy recycling fully prove the energy recovery mechanism. We therefore believe that the high conversion efficiency of 127.8% is just based on the calculation formula and can still be used to compare the conversion efficiencies of different photothermal materials even though it is over 100%.
Four main metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) have been chosen in the saline water to characterize the desalination performance of the ECB evaporator and one heavy metal ion (Ni2+) has been chosen to characterize the purification performance. To systematically estimate the effect of desalination and purification, a sample taken from Shenzhen Bay has been adopted and analysed by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP-MS). After the desalination process, the concentrations of the metal ions in the water sample are all decreased (∼4 orders of magnitude) as compared with those of the untreated water as shown in Fig. 5a. The initial concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ are as high as 7110, 811, 223 and 203 mg L−1 (higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking-water standards of 50, 100, 10, and 100 mg L−1). On the other hand, the concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ in the evaporated water are 6.017, 7.3, 4.16 and 1.624 mg L−1, respectively, which meet the WHO drinking-water standards. Meanwhile, the concentration of heavy metal ion Ni2+ decreases by 3 orders of magnitude (8.84 mg L−1 to 2.051 μg L−1) after the evaporation. The stable water generation performance of the carrot-based device over 20 cycles (1 hour for each cycle) has been taken, as shown in Fig. 5b. The cycle error of the efficiency is within ±10%, which suggests that the carrot-based generation device is a stable, efficient and reusable evaporator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ECB evaporator can work well under the rigorous conditions, such as acid/alkali, viscous solutions and cold weather. The evaporation rates of the devices before (original) and after the treatment under the extreme conditions, including HCl (12 M) and NaOH (10 M), freezing treatment (−18 °C) and viscous solution (N-methyl pyrrolidone, AR), are shown in Fig. 5c. After the different treatments, the ECB evaporator still maintains the high and stable evaporation rates, indicating its excellent environmental endurance for practical applications. The outdoor experiment of the carrot-inspired solar thermal evaporator in the natural sunlight has also been carried out in Shenzhen Bay from 09:00 to 17:00 with an average solar heat flux of 0.524 kW m−2. The fast water generation is clearly observed in several minutes (Fig. S14†).

Conclusion
Carrot-inspired biochar has been demonstrated as an efficient solar steam evaporator, thanks to the synergy of a high absorption and the presence of microchannels. The water transport can be regulated by the abundant microchannels in the ECB evaporator, expediting seawater transport from the bottom to the carrot surface. These microchannels enable the continuous water supplement, the rapid vapour evacuation, and the suppressed heat loss. Our carrot-inspired solar thermal evaporator possesses a high evaporation rate of 2.04 kg m−2 h−1 with an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 127.8% under one-sun illumination. The ECB evaporator can not only produce fresh drinking water directly from the contaminated sea water but also work well under the rigorous conditions. This carrot-inspired solar steam generation exhibits a development tendency in solar-driven interfacial evaporation where all-in-one natural materials are utilized, which can be adapted to various water desalination and purification systems.
