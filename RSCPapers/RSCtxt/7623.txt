Introduction
The task of obtaining effective nanoelectronic devices requires a deeper study of new materials whose functional properties provide high characteristics in terms of resolution, sensitivity, contrast, speed, electrical conductivity, photoconductivity, etc.1 Porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives are very interesting materials that form condensed phases.2 They combine properties necessary for their effective application in photovoltaic devices,3 organic light emitting diodes (OLED)4 and other organic electronic devices.5 Due to π–π interactions, disk-shaped molecules with a macroheterocyclic core have a strong tendency toward association and formation of columnar aggregates. Among phthalocyanine derivatives, the most interesting compounds are naphthalocyanine derivatives due to their ability to absorb light in the near infrared region.6 Such absorption should help to increase the conversion efficiency of solar energy into electrical energy. However, to develop new highly effective functional materials based on nanoscale thin films, it is necessary to control their structure, including a uniformity assessment of the films.7 Therefore, to obtain floating layers, we applied the Langmuir method, which allows the formation of structured one-component layers with molecular control of their thickness.8 In addition, previous studies have shown that organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on Langmuir–Blodgett films have better performance characteristics than OLEDs obtained by other methods.9 At the same time, the study of floating layers of phthalocyanine derivatives is necessary, since the structure and properties of the resulting thin-film materials usually depend on the supramolecular organization of the floating layers.10 However, as far as we know, there isn’t any data on the effect of supramolecular organization of naphthalocyanine derivatives in thin films on the floating layer structure. Therefore, our study is relevant and represents the first stage of versatile work on the development of low molecular weight organic materials with one-dimensional conductivity. Such materials may be promising for highly efficient photovoltaic devices.
Thus, the aim of this work was a comprehensive study of the supramolecular organization of 3,4,12,13,21,22,30,31-octa-phenyl-2,3-naphthalocyaninato zinc (product of reaction depicted in Scheme 1) in floating layers for the subsequent production of effective thin-film materials that could be used in solar cells.

The presence of peripheral phenyl groups results in high solubility of the target complex in common organic solvents and bathochromic shift of the main absorption maximum − Q band (up to 772 nm in THF solution, Fig. 1) in comparison with unsubstituted analogues. For instance, unsubstituted 2,3-naphthalocyaninate dilithium possesses a Q band at 736 nm in acetone solution.11 As it was demonstrated earlier additional edge-to-face π–π stacking interactions between the phenyl groups of neighboring macroheterocycles can occur.12

Materials and methods
Models of the naphthalocyanine molecule and its monomolecular layer formed on the water surface, as well as the calculation of their geometric characteristics, were performed using HyperChem 8.0 software (MM+ method). These data were used to determine the type of molecular packing in the floating layers.
Floating layers were formed from a chloroform solution (C = 0.0067 wt%, where C is the mass fraction of the dissolved naphthalocyanine). The layers were obtained with the use of a Nima 601A, KSV mini trough or KSV 5000 (Finland) troughs. The compression rate was 6 cm2 min−1. Water (with resistivity ρ = 18.2 MΩ cm) used as a subphase was purified by Millipore Simplicity 185 system. The initial coverage degree (c) of the water surface with naphthalocyanine molecules was calculated according to the method published in the literature.13
Layer formation at the air/water interface was studied in situ by the Brewster angle microscopy method (BAM Optrel 3000 microscope, KSV Instruments, Finland). A HeNe laser with a radiation wavelength of 633 nm and a power of 10 mW was used as a light source in this setup. The goniometer of the microscope sets the angle of the laser incidence beam in the range from 45 to 75° with an accuracy of 0.01°. To obtain polarized light and contrast images, high-precision polarizers with a polarization ratio of 10−8 were used. The image was enlarged using interchangeable lenses (×5, ×10, ×20) and recorded by a computer-controlled high-quality camera with a resolution of 768 × 72 pixels; the spatial resolution was 2 μm.
Structural organization of floating layers was studied by the grazing incidence diffraction method (GID). GID experiments were carried out on the “Langmuir” beamline at the Kurchatov synchrotron radiation source. Synchrotron radiation with an energy of 13 keV was used for the experiments. A pair of X-ray mirrors was used to incline the beam to the water surface and the incidence angle was 0.8 of the critical angle of the total external reflection for water. The data were collected by 0D scintillator detector Radicon SCSD4 and 1D detector Mythen 2 1kX. For horizontal collimation of the diffracted beam, the Soller slits with an angular aperture of 2 mrad were used. To reduce scattering in air, as well as evaporation of liquid from the Langmuir trough, all measurements were carried out in a humid helium atmosphere. Since at room temperature monolayers are actually 2D-“powder”, i.e. superposition of two-dimensional crystallites randomly oriented on the water surface, the diffraction pattern was scanned only at an angle of 2θ in the film plane (qxy − scanning). The qualitative analysis of the diffraction pattern was carried out according to the standard (three-dimensional) powder diffraction scheme, when the angular positions of the Bragg peaks 2θhk, corresponding to the vectors of the two-dimensional reciprocal lattice, determine the distances between the chains of molecules dhk.
Thin films were obtained by the consecutive transfer of layers of the studied compound from the water surface to glass substrates at room temperature (293–295 K), with surface pressure π = 16.3 mN m−1. The transfer of layers from the water surface on solid substrates was made using the Langmuir–Schaefer method (horizontal lift) for n = 25 layers.
The electronic absorption spectra of thin films of the studied compound was registered at room temperature in the range of 300–1100 nm on a UV-1800 Shimadzu (Germany) spectrophotometer.
Synthesis of 3,4,12,13,21,22,30,31-octa-phenyl-2,3-naphthalocyaninato zinc
Novel zinc naphthalocyaninate was synthesized starting from 6,7-diphenylnaphthalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile and zinc acetate by a template method. In contrast to the previously described protocol14 the employment of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a base instead of MeOLi leads to increase in the yield of zinc complex from 41% to 99%.
A mixture of 6,7-diphenylnaphthalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile (300 mg, 0.91 mmol), Zn(OAc)2 × 2H2O (116 mg, 0.53 mmol) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) was refluxed in i-AmOH (3 mL) for 5 h (TLC-control: Al2O3, C6H6). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and a MeOH:H2O (10:1 V/V) mixture was added. The precipitate was filtered and washed with water and MeOH. This yielded the target complex (313 mg, 99%). UV-Vis λmax (THF)/nm 341 (lgε 5.04), 691 (4.46), 735 (4.43) and 772 (5.30). MS (MALDI-TOF) m/z 1232 (M-2Ph, 27%), 1308 (M-Ph, 76%) 1384 (M, 100%). MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF): m/z Found: 1384.3933 [M]; molecular formula C96H56N8Zn requires 1384.3919 [M].
Results and discussion
Modelling of the floating layers
On modelling of the floating layers, naphthalocyanine molecules were located in one plane in two variations of the molecule arrangement: face-on and edge-on, both corresponding to a monolayer packaging. Then, the monolayer was placed on the surface of the previously simulated water volume. After optimization by the method of molecular mechanics, a model of a monomolecular layer on the water surface was obtained (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Edge-on model of monolayer packing of octa-phenyl-2,3-naphthalocyaninato zinc at the water surface (side view). 
Using the obtained data, the model area of a repeating unit cell was calculated. For the studied compound, the area per one molecule (Amol) in the densest face-on monomolecular packing is 3.96 nm2, and the edge-on monomolecular packing is 1.06 nm2. The calculated area size was then compared with the areas obtained in the experiment, and on the basis of the results obtained, a conclusion was made about the structure of the layer.
Supramolecular organization of the floating layers
During formation of a floating layer, images were recorded using the CCD camera of a Brewster microscope with a period of 5 seconds. Fig. 3 presents four images of the floating layer, which correspond to different points (a − d) of the compression isotherm (Fig. 4).

After applying a solution of the studied compound to the water surface and evaporating the solvent, naphthalocyanine molecules form a monolayer at Amol = 1.90 nm2 (Fig. 3a). Taking into account the simulation data, it can be shown that a monolayer is formed and naphthalocyanine molecules are tilted at an angle to the surface of the water. It is known that the intensity of BAM images depends on the film thickness and the surface density of molecules.15 According to that, within the area of surface pressure rise, Brewster microscopy demonstrates the local formation of 3D aggregates in a monolayer (Fig. 3b).
As visual observation shows, the movement speed of 3D aggregates when the barrier approaches is small, which indicates the formation of a fairly stable monolayer.
Compression of the layer to an area per one molecule of 0.97 nm2, leads to an increase in the thickness of the monolayer with the preservation of an imperceptible number of 3D aggregates (Fig. 3c).
Based on the simulation data, we can assume that in this case a dense edge-on monolayer is formed. The decrease of the area per one molecule, compared with the model area in the densest edge-on monolayer packing, is associated with the local formation of 3D aggregates.
Further compression of the monolayer (Fig. 3d) leads to its collapse and gradual transition to a bilayer state occurs. As shown by the X-ray data, naphthalocyanine molecules form amorphous layers (Fig. 5).

Optical characteristics of the Langmuir–Schaefer film
Comparison of UV-Vis spectra of a naphthalocyanine complex shows a 6 nm hypsochromic shift of the B band and a more pronounced 22 nm bathochromic shift of the Q band going from THF solution to Langmuir–Schaefer film (Fig. 1). Additionally, the appearance of a broad absorption band at 713 nm was observed. The presented data resulted from stronger aggregation of a naphthalocyanine complex in the Langmuir–Schaefer film compared to diluted solution (c = 5 × 10−6 M). This can be attributed to the formation of both types of aggregates, H type (blue shifted band) and J type (red shifted band), as a result of exciton interactions. It's typical for phthalocyanines and other dyes.16 The combination of absorption bands indicates a disordered arrangement of aggregates in the film.
Conclusions
In the present study, models of the molecule 3,4,12,13,21,22,30,31-octa-phenyl-2,3-naphthalocyaninato zinc and its monomolecular layers were built. The geometric characteristics of the monomolecular layers were calculated: in the densest face-on monomolecular packing Amol is equal to 3.96 nm2, and in the densest edge-on monomolecular packing Amol is equal to 1.06 nm2. As a result of the comprehensive study of the supramolecular organization of this naphthalocyanine derivative, it was found for the first time that amorphous bilayers with edge-on molecule packing in the layer are formed at the air/water interface. In this case, imperceptible inclusions of 3D aggregates are observed in the formed bilayers. Due to the fact that we have determined the optimal conditions for the production of thin-film materials with minimal defects, the data obtained in this work open the possibility of efficient use of thin-film materials formed on the basis of the studied floating layers in devices of organic nanoelectronics, including organic photovoltaics.
