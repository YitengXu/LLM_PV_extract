    , Accepted 30th October 2016First published on 31st October 2016AbstractPartially replacing Pb with Sn in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites has been proven as a promising approach to reduce environmental toxicity and develop low bandgap (as low as 1.20 eV) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) beneficial for constructing perovskite-based tandem solar cells. In this work, we demonstrated that partially replacing MA+ or FA+ with Cs+ in a Pb–Sn binary perovskite system can effectively retard the associated crystallization rate to facilitate homogenous film formation, subsequently resulting in enhanced device performance and stability, especially for high Sn-containing compositions. The representative MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSC with a low Eg of 1.28 eV not only achieves an improved efficiency up to 10.07% but also possesses much improved thermal and ambient stability as compared to the pristine MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSC showing poorer efficiency (6.36%) and stability. Similarly, when Cs was introduced into FAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskite, enhanced performance was observed, affirming its general applicability and beneficial role in mediating the crystal growth and film formation of Pb–Sn binary perovskites.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (APbX3, A = CH3NH3+ (MA+)/HC(NH)NH2+ (FA+) and X = Cl−/Br−/I−) have attracted worldwide attention due to their superior photovoltaic performance.1–4 Impressively high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 22% have been accomplished in the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) and thus they represent one of the most promising transformative photovoltaic technologies.5–8
To facilitate commercialization of PVSCs, it is very important to reduce environmental toxicity by eliminating Pb in the perovskite composition without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance.9,10 Among several investigated approaches, partial substitution or complete replacement of Pb with relatively less toxic tin (Sn) is an evident choice due to the similarity in their ionic radii (Sn2+: 0.93 Å vs. Pb2+: 1.20 Å) and electronic configurations,11 which could potentially preserve the exceptional semiconducting properties of APbX3.9 Besides, the development of Sn-based perovskites facilitates the realization of lower bandgap (Eg) perovskites compared to their pristine Pb-based counterparts.12–14 Pb–Sn binary perovskites have been reported to possess bandgaps around 1.2–1.3 eV,13 which are ideal low Eg materials for constructing perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells that could potentially surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit.15 In this regard, numerous recent efforts have been dedicated to develop efficient Sn-based low Eg PVSCs.9,10,13 However, there are still several existing issues that impede the progress of Sn-based PVSCs.
As manifested in our studies and other related studies,10,13,14,16 forming high quality Sn-based perovskite films is more challenging than forming Pb-based perovskites due to the fast crystallization between SnI2 and MAI.17 Poor quality perovskite films can cause device shorting, inefficient charge transport/collection, and severe charge recombination, resulting in inferior device performance. Furthermore, the propensity for the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ owing to relatively weak inert pair effects compared to Pb is problematic and deteriorates photovoltaic properties. Hence, rational modulation of nucleation and growth kinetics coupled with controlled processing is required to improve the performance of Sn-based PVSCs.
Recently, we have successfully adopted a solvent-washing approach utilizing a GBL/DMSO co-solvent coupled with toluene quenching to effectively improve the quality of Sn-based perovskite films.16 By systematically integrating the compositional and interfacial engineering, high-performance (PCE: 14.19%) low Eg (1.33 eV) Pb–Sn binary MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 based PVSCs were successfully realized. However, as the Sn content in the perovskite composition exceeded 25%, film formation was adversely impacted with apparent pinholes and subsequently poor photovoltaic performance. Therefore, further process engineering is imperatively required for realization of Pb–Sn perovskite alloys with the Sn content beyond 25%.10,16
Several recent studies have revealed that introduction of Cs cations in small quantities can effectively alter the crystalline lattice, modulate the thermodynamic phase stability, and control the film formation of hybrid perovskites.15,18–20 For example, Park et al. have manifested that Cs incorporation into FAPbI3 can contract the lattice to enhance the stability of the black phase compared to the yellow phase.18 Likewise, Snaith et al. have demonstrated that the phase instability of FAPbIyBr3−y (y > 20%) can be addressed by partially replacing FA with Cs.15 Besides, Grätzel et al. have also found that the photostability and thermal stability of PVSCs can be effectively improved by incorporating Cs cations.19 Thus, these demonstrations portraying versatile beneficial roles of Cs in PVSCs inspired us to investigate introduction of Cs as a strategy to modulate the film formation and photovoltaic properties of Pb–Sn binary alloy perovskite systems.
In this work, we have successfully demonstrated the beneficial role of Cs incorporation in further improving the performance of Pb–Sn binary alloy based PVSCs compared to our previous study.16 We found that the introduction of Cs effectively modulates the film formation of Pb–Sn perovskites and thus results in improved film quality for high Sn-containing compositions. This is attributed to the reduced crystallization rate in the presence of Cs cations. As a result, both MAPb1−xSnxI3 and FAPb1−xSnxI3 PVSCs with high Sn substitution ratios can deliver enhanced PCE and stability with an appropriate amount of Cs incorporation. For instance with 50% Sn, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 and FA0.8Cs0.2Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskites possess a low Eg of 1.26–1.28 eV and afford high PCEs of 10.07% and 11.63%, respectively, outperforming the performance of the PVSCs without Cs. More importantly, the MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 based device can maintain ∼75% of its initial PCE after being annealed at 85 °C under inert conditions for 12 days and ∼76% of its initial PCE after being stored in an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 35 ± 5% for 20 days.
2. Results and discussion
A homogeneous and pinhole free MAPbI3 film can be obtained by an anti-solvent washing method by forming an MAI–PbI2–DMSO intermediate state.21 However, the different nature of the intermediate (SnI2·3DMSO) coupled with a faster reaction between MAI and SnI2 complicates the fabrication of Sn-based perovskite films.22 This complexity is apparent in the fabrication of MAPb1−xSnxI3 films, where the anti-solvent washing method cannot be directly adapted to realize homogenous film formation when the Sn content >25%. As reported in our previous work,16 we found that the morphology of MAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskites worsens as the incorporated Sn content exceeds 25% which can be attributed to their associated rapid crystallization. Therefore, further film optimization to effectively slow down the crystallization rate is required to improve the film quality. In our study, films formed from MAI and SnI2 precursors turned black immediately after anti-solvent dripping, whereas a semitransparent state was observed even after anti-solvent dripping in the case of CsI and SnI2 precursors (Fig. S1†). Thus, based on this evolution of CsSnI3 and MASnI3 films, we rationalize that the crystallization of the perovskite phase from CsI and SnI2 is much slower compared to that from MAI and SnI2. Accordingly, partial replacement of MAI with CsI in the precursor solution would certainly influence the crystallization rate and film formation of MAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskites. To identify and assess this influence, we replaced 0–30 mol% of MAI with CsI in the precursor solution for the formation of MA1−yCsyPb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskites.

Fig. 1a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the pristine MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film, where a non-ideal morphology with inhomogeneous coverage is evident. However, after incorporating 10–20 mol% Cs into MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite, a homogenous morphology with uniform crystal domains can be obtained as presented in Fig. 1b and c. This is clearly a consequence of the reduced crystallization rate induced by the addition of Cs. However, the film morphology becomes poor again when the Cs content reaches 30 mol%, possibly due to phase separation resulting from immiscibility (Fig. 1d).23,24

Their corresponding (e) UV-vis and PL and (f) zoomed-in region in Fig. S2† (refined XRD spectra). (g) J–V curves (reverse scan) of the derived inverted PVSCs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Bis-C60/Ag) measured under AM 1.5 illumination and dark conditions. 
As shown in the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 1e), introduction of Cs (10–30 mol%) does not significantly affect the resulting Eg of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured to understand the phase purity and impact on the crystal structure after Cs incorporation (Fig. S2† and 1f). All MA1−xCsxPb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskites possess a tetragonal phase and the lattice volume gradually decreased from 981.4 Å3 to 968.6 Å3 as the incorporated content of Cs increased from 10 mol% to 30 mol% (Table S1†). The contraction of the crystal lattice is as expected, because MA+ cations are partially substituted with smaller Cs+ cations.
To determine the consequence of the improved morphology, inverted thin-film PVSCs with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Bis-C60/Ag were fabricated as reported in our previous work.16 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under AM 1.5 illumination are shown in Fig. 1g and the corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table S2.† Consistent with the morphological trends discussed above, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSCs delivered the highest PCEAVG of 10.07%, clearly outperforming the performance (6.36%) of the pristine MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSCs. A significantly increased VOC (0.70 vs. 0.62 V), JSC (23.2 vs. 18.4 mA cm−2), and FF (0.62 vs. 0.55) were observed. The champion MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 device showed an impressively high PCE of 12.7% (Fig. S3†), which is among the highest PCEs for Pb–Sn binary perovskite with 50% Sn reported so far.16
As the incorporated content of Cs gradually increased from 10 mol% to 20 and 30 mol%, the obtained PCEAVG decreased to 7.25% and 2.91%, respectively, reflecting the impact of the adverse morphology shown in Fig. 1c and d. Fig. S4† depicts the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these fabricated MA1−yCsyPb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSCs, in which the integrated photocurrent densities (17.4 mA cm−2 for MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3, 22.5 mA cm−2 for MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, 19.5 mA cm−2 for MA0.8Cs0.2Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, and 13.9 mA cm−2 for MA0.7Cs0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3) match well with the JSC obtained from J–V curves (Fig. 1g). Thus, the above results clearly confirm the efficacy of adding Cs to further optimize the performance of Sn-based perovskites. We subsequently chose 10 mol% Cs substitution to analyze the general applicability of this approach to improve the performance of the MAPb1−xSnxI3 system.
Based on the UV-vis absorption (Tauc-plot analysis in Fig. S5†) and PL spectra (Fig. 2a), for MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 to 1), we observe a red-shift in Eg compared to that of MA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 as expected. The estimated Eg for MA0.9Cs0.1PbI3, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.75Sn0.25I3, and MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 is 1.61, 1.39 and 1.28 eV, respectively. As the incorporated amount of Sn exceeds 50 mol%, the Eg of thin films cannot be easily evaluated from absorption spectra due to the softened band edge, possibly arising from the presence of sub-Eg states and/or scattering caused by the inhomogeneous morphology.25 Hence, the corresponding steady-state PL spectra were measured to better define the Eg. Accordingly, the Eg of MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.25Sn0.75I3 and MA0.9Cs0.1SnI3 is ∼1.26 and ∼1.41 eV respectively. The non-linear trend in the Eg of MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 perovskites is in accordance with our previous study and the literature.12,13,16 To accurately estimate the content of Cs, Pb, and Sn in the MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed as shown in Fig. S6.† The element content estimated from XPS is close to the stoichiometry ratio. For convenience, stoichiometry ratios were used in this study.

(d) Performance comparison of MAPb1−xSnxI3 and MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) PVSCs. 
The XRD of MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 films is shown in Fig. S7.† All films possess two distinct peaks corresponding to (110) and (220) crystal planes of the tetragonal phase, and the absence of any additional peaks affirms the crystallinity and quality of the MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 perovskite films. The photovoltaic performance of MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 PVSCs is shown in Fig. 2b and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. The VOC decreased from 1.00 to 0.20 eV as the Sn content increased from 0 to 100 mol%, while the JSC increased from 18.57 to 23.32 mA cm−2 as the Sn content increased from 0 to 50 mol% and then decreased to 4.53 mA cm−2 with further increase in the Sn content to 100 mol%. Among them, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 with a bandgap of 1.39 eV showed the highest PCE of 14.55%. The corresponding EQE spectra of these devices are presented in Fig. 2c and the band edges correlate well with the above Egs discussed for MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 perovskites. It is apparent that the photo-response in the infrared region gradually increased as the amount of Sn substitution in the perovskite composition increases. The good agreement in current density obtained from the integrated EQE spectrum (17.9, 22.3, 22.5, 21.5, and 4.3 mA cm−2 for MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1I3, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.75Sn0.25I3, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.25Sn0.75I3, and MA0.9Cs0.1SnI3, respectively) and J–V curve affirms the accuracy of results presented herein.

Compared to the photovoltaic performance of MAPb1−xSnxI3 PVSCs reported in our previous work16 the PCEAVG of MA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 and MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 PVSCs does not improve significantly, due to the minimal influence on the morphology with Cs incorporation (Fig. 2d), whereas for the MAPb1−xSnxI3 compositions with the Sn content above 50 mol%, the resultant photovoltaic performance is significantly improved. The PCEAVG of MAPb0.50Sn0.50I3 and MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 PVSCs is enhanced from 6.36% and 2.63–% to 10.07% and 6.34% respectively after Cs incorporation, demonstrating the beneficial role of Cs in improving film formation of Sn-based perovskites. It is important to note that further PCE improvements of MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.25Sn0.75I3 and MA0.9Cs0.1SnI3 devices could be expected with continued optimization of the amount of Cs substitution.
As portrayed in our previous work,16 one key device-level challenge for developing high-performance Sn-based PVSCs is the interlayer selection to minimize energy losses. The mismatch in energy levels between the employed charge-transporting layers (CTLs) and perovskite layer incurs additional potential loss to deteriorate the resultant performance. In principle, Cs incorporation into MAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskites should not largely affect the resultant energy levels based on the understanding that Cs cations do not actively participate in determining frontier energy levels.24 To examine this, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to estimate the energy levels of freshly prepared MA0.9CS0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 films (Fig. S8†). Compared to MAPb1−xSnxI3 reported in our previous work,16 we found that the valence band maximum (VBM) of MA0.9CS0.1Pb1−xSnxI3 is slightly downshifted, especially in the case of x = 0.25 to 0.75, which can enable better energy level alignment with the employed PEDOT:PSS hole-transporting layer (HTL) and thus contribute to the enhanced performance as observed.
As mentioned above, another critical issue for Sn-based PVSCs is the problematic oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and the associated instability in an ambient environment.26,27 Previously, Cs incorporation has been found to improve the thermal and ambient-stability of perovskites.19 To understand the impact of Cs incorporation on the stability of Sn based perovskites, we first compared the stability of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 films after being stored in an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 35 ± 5%. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, a new peak corresponding to MA2SnI6 (due to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+) appeared in the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film after 1 day, whereas no such peak could be observed for MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 even after 3 days. This illustrates that Cs incorporation can effectively slow down the Sn2+ oxidation in an ambient environment, potentially due to the contraction of the crystal lattice and the denser morphology of perovskite films.

Subsequently, the photo- and thermal-stabilities of derived devices based on MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 compositions were investigated. Fig. 3b shows that both devices are stable under illumination in an inert atmosphere. No hysteresis was observed in the current–voltage characteristics, consistent with MAPbI3 PVSCs employing similar CTLs.28 As shown in Fig. 3c, we find an improvement in thermal stability (annealing at 85 °C) under an inert atmosphere with Cs incorporation. The MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 device can still maintain 75% of its initial PCE after 12 days, while the PCE of pristine MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 degraded to 30% of its initial value. More encouragingly, the MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 device can retain 76% of its initial PCE after being kept in an ambient environment with a humidity of 35 ± 5% for 20 days (Fig. 3d).
Finally, we extended this approach to the FAPb1−xSnxI3 system to verify the general applicability and beneficial role of Cs incorporation in Sn-based perovskites. For the FAPb1−xSnxI3 system, 20 mol% Cs substitution was chosen based on our preliminary optimization. The corresponding UV-vis spectra and XRD of the prepared FA0.8Cs0.2Pb1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 to 1) films are shown in Fig. S9.† Similar to MA0.9Cs0.1Pb1−xSnxI3, all films possess good phase purity and red-shifted Eg as the incorporated Sn amount increased. The J–V curves and EQE of FAPb1−xSnxI3 and FA0.8Cs0.2Pb1−xSnxI3 devices are compared in Fig. 4a and S10† and their detailed performances are summarized in Table S3.† As can be seen, all parameters, especially the VOC and JSC, were largely improved after Cs incorporation. The final PCE enhancement is summarized in Fig. 4b. It can be clearly observed that for the entire series of FAPb1−xSnxI3 alloys, PCEs are significantly improved after Cs incorporation. This further confirms the efficacy of our approach to enhance the performance of Pb–Sn binary perovskite systems.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have unveiled that partially replacing MA+ or FA+ with Cs+ in a Pb–Sn binary perovskite system can effectively decrease the crystallization rate and optimize the associated film morphology, resulting in enhanced device performance and stability, especially for high Sn-containing compositions. As a result, both MAPb1−xSnxI3 and FAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskites with high Sn substitution ratios can deliver enhanced PCE and stability after incorporating an appropriate amount of Cs. More importantly, the representative MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 PVSCs can maintain ∼75% of their initial PCE after being annealed at 85 °C in an inert atmosphere for 12 days and preserve ∼76% of their initial PCE after being stored in an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 35 ± 5% for 20 days, outperforming the pristine MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 device. This study clearly demonstrates Cs incorporation as an effective strategy to improve the Pb–Sn binary perovskites, paving the way for future development of low Eg Sn-based PVSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 General methods
All chemicals (like lead iodide, tin iodide, cesium iodide) and the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. MAI, FAI, and Bis-C60 were synthesized according to the procedures in our previous reports.29–31 All solutions were filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter prior to use.
4.2 Solar cell fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned via ultrasonication (10 min for each step) in the sequence of detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol. Then, the substrates were dried by nitrogen flow and treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 10 min before the deposition of PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS (Al 4083) solution was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO glass at 5000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, MAI, FAI, CsI, PbI2, and SnI2 with different molar ratios were dissolved in γ-butyrolactone and DMSO (a volume ratio of 7:3) with a total concentration of 1 M. Afterward, the perovskite films were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 500 rpm for 5 s, 1000 rpm for 15 s, and 4000 rpm for 40 s in the glove box. Toluene with different volumes (500, 400, 300, 200, and 100 μL for Sn concentrations of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, in perovskites) was in situ dripped onto the substrate during the last 15–20 s of the 3rd spin-coating step. Afterward, the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. PCBM solution (15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was then spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 1500 rpm for 60 s, followed by the deposition of the Bis-C60 layer (2 mg mL−1 in isopropyl alcohol, spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s). Finally, the Ag electrode with a thickness of 150 nm was evaporated under high vacuum (<2 × 10−6 Torr), a shadow mask of 16 mm2 holes was used to define the area of the Ag electrode, and the solar cells were measured by applying a covering shadow mask with an aperture area of 10 mm2.
4.3 Characterization
XRD was carried out by using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker F8 Focus Powder for regular XRD and Bruker D8 Discover 2-D XRD for refined XRD). SEM was carried out by using a FEI Sirion operated at 5 kV. The absorption spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrometer. The UPS was carried out by using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD photoelectron spectrometer. The J–V curves were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 Source measurement unit, a 450 W xenon lamp was used to produce light, and the light intensity of (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated by using a standard Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 filter (for pure Pb-based perovskite) and KG-1 filter (for Pb–Sn alloy perovskite), which can be traced back to the standard of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The light intensity was tuned by a mismatch factor to measure the low Eg Sn-based PVSCs. The EQE spectra were measured by using a joint system of a monochromated 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) and a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400), which was calculated by a calibrated Si photodiode (OSI-Optoelectronics), and all solar cells were studied without any encapsulation in the stability test.
