    , Accepted 26th April 2017First published on 26th April 2017AbstractCobalt corroles with different acid/base pendants, LBr–Co, LCOOH–Co, LPO(OH)2–Co, and LCH2PO(OH)2–Co (L = 5,15-bis-(pentafluorophenyl)-10-(4-dibenzofuran)corrole), were synthesized and examined as catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution from neutral aqueous solutions. Co corroles with phosphonic acid pendants showed improved activities in both processes, highlighting the importance of the secondary coordination sphere in catalyst design.
An attractive way to meet the growing global energy demand is to convert solar energy to chemical fuels.1,2 Water splitting is an ideal protocol for this solar-to-fuel strategy.3,4 However, its two half reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), are kinetically slow.3,4 Therefore, designing cheap and efficient OER4,5 and HER6,7 catalysts has attracted extensive attention. A variety of molecular catalysts of Mn,8–10 Fe,11–13 Co,14–26 Ni,27–31 and Cu32–35 have been identified as OER and/or HER catalysts. Particular emphases have been placed on providing new insights into catalyst design to reveal the structure–function relationship.
Metallocorroles have been shown to be highly active for OER3,9,14,15,17 and HER.3,22,23,32 Trianionic corrole ligands can afford a stable square-planar coordination mode and are very effective in stabilizing high-valent metal ions, which are usually involved in OER.3 Consequently, corrole ligands can offer low-valent metal ions large reducing powers. All these features make metal corroles attractive for OER and HER catalysis.
In addition, the second coordination sphere of metal ions has a substantial effect on catalysis.36 For example, DuBois and co-workers demonstrated that pendant amines proximate to the metal ion can significantly improve the catalytic efficiency of Ni-based HER catalysts.29,30 Protonated amine groups can function as intramolecular proton relays to facilitate proton transfer processes. Nocera and co-workers designed hangman metalloporphyrins as HER catalysts and showed that the hanging carboxyl acid group is able to assist HER by mediating proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps.11,21 These authors further revealed that the rate of HER catalysis is affected by the proton-donating ability of the hanging group. For OER, Nocera and co-workers showed that the hanging carboxyl group can increase the catalytic activity of Co corroles.17 Theoretical studies by Cramer37 and us38 suggested that the carboxyl group in the second coordination sphere of the Co ion can act as an intramolecular base to assist the rate-limiting O–O bond formation through a concerted oxygen atom-proton transfer mechanism.33,39 However, due to synthetic challenges to introduce functional groups into the second coordination sphere of metal ions, few examples have been reported to compare the effects of different acid/base pendants on OER and HER catalysis.
It is known that the increase of the proton-accepting ability of the base will increase the O–O bond formation rate.3 We are thus interested in attaching phosphonic acid groups to the second coordination sphere of Co corroles. As the pKa2 of phosphonic acid groups is larger than the pKa of carboxyl acid groups, Co corroles with phosphonic acid pendants are considered to have improved OER activities as compared to analogues without such groups. In addition, because of the different proton-donating abilities of phosphonic and carboxyl acid groups, it is intriguing to study the HER activity of Co corroles with phosphonic acid pendants. Herein we report the syntheses and characterization of four Co corroles appended with different acid/base groups. Complexes LBr–Co, LCOOH–Co, LPO(OH)2–Co, and LCH2PO(OH)2–Co all have an active Co corrole site attached to the 4-position of the dibenzofuran unit and have different pendants at its 6-position (Scheme 1). All these complexes are active for OER and HER from neutral aqueous solutions. Our results show that appended groups at the 6-position of dibenzofuran play crucial roles in both processes. Complex LCH2PO(OH)2–Co outperforms others in both OER and HER. This work therefore highlights the importance of the secondary coordination sphere in catalyst design.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of Co corroles. Pyridine groups bound to the axial positions of Co are omitted for clarity. 
The synthetic routes of the four Co corroles are depicted in Scheme 2. For LCH2PO(OH)2–Co, the introduction of two formyl groups at 4- and 6-positions of dibenzofuran was realized by treating it with n-BuLi followed by reaction with dimethylformamide (DMF, route A). Details of synthesis and characterization are given in the ESI.† One of the formyl groups was converted to –CH2PO(OEt)2, and the other one was converted to a corrole unit containing two pentafluorophenyl units at its 5- and 15-positions. The subsequent hydrolysis and reaction with Co(OAc)2 gave LCH2PO(OH)2–Co. Its identity and purity were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S46 and S47, ESI†) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, Fig. S48, ESI†). Attempts to grow crystals of LCH2PO(OH)2–Co for X-ray analysis were not successful. Instead, we synthesized its ester form LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co for structural studies (1H NMR, Fig. S49; HRMS, Fig. S50, ESI†).
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes of LCH2PO(OH)2–Co (route A), LPO(OH)2–Co (route B), LCOOH–Co (route C), and LBr–Co (route D). 
Complex LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P21212 (cell parameters in Table S1, ESI†). The Co ion is coordinated by the four N atoms of the corrole unit, which define an equatorial plane (Fig. 1a). Two additional pyridine groups are bound to the axial positions of Co. The resulting octahedral coordination environment and short Co–N bond distances are indicative of a d6 CoIII electronic configuration,15 which is consistent with the diamagnetism of LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co as established by 1H NMR. Because LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co and LCH2PO(OH)2–Co should have very similar structural aspects except that the –CH2PO(OEt)2 moiety is converted to –CH2PO(OH)2 in the latter complex, the place and orientation and also the distance of the –CH2PO(OH)2 unit to Co can be estimated based on the X-ray structure of LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co. Structural analysis showed that the distance of the phosphonic oxygen atoms to Co is about 6.6 Å, indicating that they are close enough to Co to potentially act as an intramolecular base to facilitate the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to a Co-oxo unit for O–O bond formation.33,39
 Fig. 1  Thermal ellipsoid plot (50% probability) of the X-ray structures of (a) LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co, (b) LPO(OEt)2, (c) LCOOMe, and (d) LBr–Co–PPh3. 
Co corrole LPO(OH)2–Co was synthesized following route B (Scheme 2). Complex 4,6-dibromodibenzofuran was treated with one equiv. of PhLi followed by reaction with DMF to give 4-formyl-6-bromodibenzofuran. The subsequent conversion of –Br to –PO(OEt)2 and conversion of –CHO to corrole were realized. The resulting LPO(OEt)2 was structurally characterized (cell parameters in Table S1, ESI†), showing an appended –PO(OEt)2 group proximate to a corrole unit (Fig. 1b). The corresponding LPO(OH)2–Co was characterized by NMR (Fig. S31 and S32, ESI†) and HRMS (Fig. S33, ESI†). Starting from 4-formyl-6-bromodibenzofuran, –Br could be converted to –COOMe (route C). LCOOMe was structurally characterized (Fig. 1c, cell parameters in Table S1, ESI†). The corresponding LCOOH–Co was also carefully characterized (Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†). Additionally, LBr–Co was synthesized as an analogue lacking acid/base pendants (route D, 1H NMR, Fig. S7; HRMS, Fig. S8, ESI†). In order to grow crystals of LBr–Co, one equiv. of PPh3 was added. The resulting LBr–Co–PPh3 crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Pbca (Fig. 1d, cell parameters in Table S1, ESI†). The Co ion has a square pyramidal coordination environment with the four N atoms of corrole defining the equatorial plane and PPh3 occupying the axial position.
On the basis of structural studies of LCH2PO(OEt)2–Co, LPO(OEt)2, LCOOMe, and LBr–Co–PPh3, we can conclude that four complexes contain different acid/base pendants proximate to corrole units. The dibenzofuran unit is therefore valuable to make functional groups at the second coordination sphere of metal centers. It is worth noting that the two meso-C6F5 substituents have strong electron-withdrawing features. The use of meso-C6F5 substituents is aimed to (1) decrease the electron density of the corrole ring and thus increase its stability during OER and (2) shift the redox events of corroles to the anodic direction to reduce the overpotential for HER.
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Co corroles were recorded in acetonitrile (0.1 M Bu4NPF6). Due to the very low solubility of LPO(OH)2–Co and LCH2PO(OH)2–Co, their ester forms were used for CV measurements. In general, these Co corroles each showed four redox events (Fig. S55–S58, data summarized in Table S3, ESI†). As can be seen from these data, the redox potentials of these Co corroles are almost identical. These results demonstrate that pendants at the second coordination sphere of Co ions have small influence on the redox potentials. It is worth noting that the second reduction wave of LCOOH–Co is irreversible. This result indicates the reduction of the acid protons. A similar observation was reported by Nocera and co-workers on hangman metalloporphyrins.21
Catalytic OER was performed in 0.1 M pH 7 phosphate buffers using catalyst-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) working electrodes. The amount of catalysts loaded on FTO is intended to be 20 nmol cm−2. Fig. 2a shows that the OER activity has the order of LCH2PO(OH)2–Co > LPO(OH)2–Co > LCOOH–Co > LBr–Co. The onset potential of the catalytic wave with LCH2PO(OH)2–Co is 1.27 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, all potentials reported are vs. NHE unless otherwise noted), corresponding to an onset overpotential of 450 mV. This value is smaller than those of other Co corrole OER catalysts reported in the literature.15,17 The appended base group is considered to be able to act as an intramolecular base to assist the O–O bond formation through a concerted oxygen atom-proton transfer mechanism. Because ArCH2PO32− (pKa2 of ArCH2PO3H2ca. 8.4) is more basic than others in this series (pKa2 of ArPO3H2ca. 7.1, pKa of ArCOOH ca. 4.2), it is more effective in facilitating the O–O bond formation. Fig. 2b shows the plot of potential (measured at 0.52 mA cm−2) vs. pKa of appended groups (for –PO(OH)2 and –CH2PO(OH)2, pKa2 are used). The slope is the −55 mV per pKa unit. A similar observation was reported by Groves and Wang: plotting the potential at a fixed current vs. pKa of the buffer anion gave a slope of −54 mV per pKa.16 These results indicate that the OER mechanism involves a rate-determining PCET step (i.e., O–O bond formation), in which the electron transfer process becomes more favorable because of the improved proton transfer process as facilitated by a stronger basic group.16,17,39 Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) studies were then carried out to examine the stability of these Co corroles during OER (Fig. S59–S62, ESI†). During 5 h CPE, currents remained relatively stable. The Faradaic efficiencies of all four Co corroles for O2 evolution were measured to be more than 90% (Fig. S69–S72, ESI†). In addition, the washed FTO electrodes after electrolysis exhibited no catalytic OER activities, and no heterogeneous particles were formed on the washed electrodes as examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. S67, ESI†). All these results suggest the molecular nature of these Co corroles for OER catalysis.

(b) The plot of potential at 0.52 mA cm−2vs. pKa of appended groups. (c) LSV of HER using blank and catalyst-coated (70 nmol cm−2) GC electrodes in 0.1 M pH 7 phosphate buffers. 
Catalytic HER with these Co corroles was also examined using catalyst-coated glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in 0.1 M pH 7 phosphate buffers. The amount of catalysts loaded on GC is intended to be 70 nmol cm−2. Our results give an activity order of LCH2PO(OH)2–Co > PO(OH)2–Co > LCOOH–Co>Br–Co (Fig. 2c). This trend is likely due to the higher protonation level of –CH2PO32− in neutral aqueous solutions, which leads to an effectively higher local proton concentration.11 Similarly, their stabilities for HER were examined by CPE studies, which gave almost stable current profiles (Fig. S63–S66, ESI†). The Faradaic efficiencies for H2 evolution were determined to be larger than 80% (i.e., for LCH2PO(OH)2–Co, it is 94%, Fig. S73–S76, ESI†). The washed GC electrodes after electrolysis were not active for HER and showed no heterogeneous phases in SEM and EDX analyses (Fig. S68, ESI†). All these results suggest that these Co corroles are real catalysts for HER. It is necessary to note that Co corroles have been verified to be robust for both OER and HER in previous reports by others17,22 and us.14,15
In summary, four Co corroles with different acid/base pendants were synthesized and characterized. Catalytic OER and HER studies from neutral aqueous solutions showed that LCH2PO(OH)2–Co is the most active one in this series of complexes. The –CH2PO(OH)2 group can act as an intramolecular base to assist the O–O bond formation in OER and can act as a proton pond to increase the effective local proton concentration in HER. Our results therefore highlight the importance of the secondary coordination sphere in catalyst design.
