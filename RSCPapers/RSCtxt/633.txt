    , Accepted 11th April 2013First published on 12th April 2013AbstractA highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film composed of a bottom single crystal nanosheet layer with ca. 1.5 μm thickness and a top microsphere layer with ca. 18.5 μm thickness has been successfully fabricated on a FTO conducting substrate through a facile and one-pot hydrothermal method. The top Nb3O7F microspheres with 2–5 μm diameter consist of transparent single crystal nanosheets with 10–40 nm thickness. Without the need for further calcination, the as-synthesised Nb3O7F nanostructured films possess excellent crystallinity and high mechanical stability, which can be directly used as photoanodes for CdS quantum dot-sensitised solar cells (QDSSCs) and dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). The transparent single crystal nanosheets constituting top Nb3O7F microspheres possess exposed (100) and (010) surfaces, which can play an important role in sensitiser loading. The photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that the CdS quantum dot-sensitised Nb3O7F nanostructured photoanode with seven chemical bath deposition (CBD) cycles (NbCdS-7) shows the best performance under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) due to higher carrier concentration and longer electron lifetime in NbCdS-7. QDSSCs made of NbCdS-7 photoanodes show an overall light conversion efficiency of 1.68%, which is almost 1.4 and 1.9 times of the NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes, respectively. DSSC measurement indicates that an overall light conversion efficiency of 2.78% can be achieved for the Nb3O7F nanostructured photoanode. This work demonstrates the possibility of direct growth of a highly crystalline metal oxide-based nanostructured film on a FTO conducting substrate as a photoanode material without the need for further calcination for solar energy conversion applications.
1 Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been the most widely investigated semiconductor material due to its excellent properties and extensive applications in photocatalysis, water splitting for the generation of hydrogen, sensing, biomedicine, lithium-ion batteries, and solar energy conversion.1–11 Even so, considerable efforts have also been made to develop other alternative materials such as ZnO, WO3, SnO2, and niobium-containing nanostructures for more extensive applications.12–17 Amongst them, there is increasing interest in niobium-containing materials owing to their structural diversity and attractive applications for photocatalysis, gas sensing, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.15,16,18–21 To date, Nb2O5 with a wide bandgap of about 3.4 eV has been the most widely studied niobium-containing material because of its unique properties and extensive applications.15,19,20,22 Various synthetic methods have been employed to fabricate Nb2O5 nanostructures with different morphologies, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanobelts and nanoforests, which have exhibited promising applications in different fields.15,19,20,22–24 However, only a few studies on other forms of niobium-containing materials have been reported to date in the literature.16,21,25–28 Very recently, our group developed a facile hydrothermal method to directly grow a Nb3O7(OH) single crystal nanorod film on a FTO substrate.16 The fabricated Nb3O7(OH) single crystal nanorods possess high crystallinity and large surface area, which can be directly used as photoanodes for dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) without the need for further calcination to achieve an impressive overall light conversion efficiency of 6.77%.16 This concept may be extended to fabricate a highly crystalline metal oxide-based nanostructured film on a flexible substrate for flexible solar cells because the fabricated film does not need further calcination, thus avoiding the flexible substrate damage.
Several early reports have indicated that Nb3O7F is a class of important niobium-containing material with high crystallinity, which can be readily transformed into Nb2O5 with different crystal phases through thermal conversion.25–31 In their studies, the Nb3O7F structures are usually obtained under the conditions of high temperature and high pressure.25–31 In 1964, Andersson reported the synthesis of Nb3O7F by the reaction of Nb2O5 and NbO2F under the conditions of high temperature and high pressure.25 His work confirmed that the Nb3O7F structure consists of blocks of the ReO3-structure type which are fused together by means of octahedra sharing edges, with the unit-cell dimensions of a = 20.67 Å, b = 3.833 Å, and c = 3.927 Å.25 Permer reported the synthesis of Nb3O7F structures by thermal decomposition of NbO2F under high temperature and high pressure.26,31 In their studies, lithium ion insertion into the Nb3O7F structure and its thermal decomposition products were investigated in detail by using various characterisation techniques.26,31 Their studies demonstrated that the one set of crystallographic shear planes in Nb3O7F can obviously slow down the Li-insertion reaction and stabilise the structure.31 The study on thermal decomposition of the Li-inserted sample of Li3xNb3O7F (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.4) resulted in various thermal decomposition products, such as LiF, NbO2, LiNb3O8, and LiNbO3.26 Recently, Zhu et al. reported the template free synthesis of 3D Nb3O7F hierarchical nanostructures.21 The resulting product as a photocatalyst showed good photocatalytic activity toward photocatalytic degradation of different dyes under UV irradiation.21 To the best of our knowledge, the synthesised Nb3O7F structures in all reports to date are exclusively in powder form, which have not been investigated as photoanode materials for photosensitisation.
Herein, we report for the first time a facile and one-pot hydrothermal method to directly grow highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films on FTO conducting substrates. The obtained Nb3O7F nanostructured film consists of a bottom single crystal nanosheet layer and a top microsphere layer. The top microspheres are composed of transparent Nb3O7F single crystal nanosheets. The formation process of the as-synthesised Nb3O7F nanostructured film has been investigated and discussed in this work. The as-synthesised Nb3O7F nanostructured films possess excellent crystallinity and high mechanical stability, which can be directly used as photoanodes for solar cells (CdS quantum dot-sensitised and dye-sensitised solar cells) without the need for further calcination, displaying great potential as promising photoanode materials for solar energy conversion applications.
2 Experimental section
Fabrication of Nb3O7F nanostructured films
In a typical synthesis, 0.5403 g of niobium(V) chloride (NbCl5, Aldrich) was dissolved in 40 mL of 1.0% (v/v) hydrofluoric acid (HF, 48%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution. After ultrasonic treatment for 1 min, the resultant solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 100 mL. Subsequently, a piece of pre-treated FTO conducting glass (15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) with the conductive side facing up was immersed in the above solution. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 200 °C for 3 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and then the FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed adequately with deionised water and allowed to dry in a nitrogen stream for further characterisation and measurement. The Nb2O5 nanostructured films were obtained by thermal treatment of highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films at 550 °C for 2 h.
CdS quantum dot sensitisation
CdS particles were deposited on the highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films by the sequential chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.32,33 Typically, the Nb3O7F film was successively immersed in four different beakers for about 30 s in each beaker. One beaker contained 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 solution, another contained 0.05 M Na2S, and the other two contained distilled water to rinse the samples from the excess of each precursor solution. Such an immersion cycle was repeated 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 times, and the obtained samples were denoted as NbCdS-1, NbCdS-3, NbCdS-5, NbCdS-7, and NbCdS-10, respectively. The resultant samples were tested in photoelectrochemical experiments and solar cells. For comparison, the Nb2O5 nanostructured films were also sensitised by CdS quantum dots with 7 CBD cycles as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical measurement.
Characterisation
SEM (JSM-7001F), TEM (Philips F20), and XRD (Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer) were employed for characterisation the fabricated samples. The chemical compositions of the samples were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis ULTRA, incorporating a 165 mm hemispherical electron energy analyzer). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were recorded using a Varian Cary 5E UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, US). The photoluminescent (PL) spectra of CdS quantum dot-sensitised samples were recorded on a F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were obtained on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 surface area and pore size analyser.
Measurements
The photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out at 23 °C in a photoelectrochemical cell with a quartz window for illumination.34 It consisted of a nanostructured photoanode, a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a platinum mesh counter electrode. A voltammograph (CV-27, BAS) was used for the application of potential bias. Potential and current signals were recorded using a Macintosh (AD Instruments). The illuminated area of the photoanode was 0.785 cm2. In photoelectrochemical experiments, 0.5 M Na2S solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. Illumination was carried out using a 150 W Xe lamp (TrustTech, China). The wavelengths of the incident light were greater than 400 nm through a UV-400 filter. The intensity of the incident light was 100 mW cm−2. For solar cell measurements, a series of cells were fabricated with a traditional sandwich type configuration by using a CdS quantum dot-sensitised nanostructured film (or a dye sensitised nanostructured film) and a platinum counter electrode. A mask with a window area of 0.15 cm2 was applied on the photoanode film side to define the active area of the cells. A 500 W Xe lamp (Trusttech Co., Beijing) with an AM 1.5G filter (Sciencetech, Canada) was used as the light source. The light intensity was measured using a radiant power meter (Newport, 70260) coupled with a broadband probe (Newport, 70268). The photovoltaic measurements of solar cells were performed using a scanning potentiostat (Model 362, Princeton Applied Research, US). The electrolyte for CdS quantum dot-sensitised solar cell measurement contained 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl. For dye-sensitised solar cell measurement, the electrolyte was a DYESOL high efficiency electrolyte (EL-HPE). The IPCE as a function of wavelength was measured with a QE/IPCE measurement kit (NewSpec). Impedance measurements were performed with a computer-controlled potentiostat (PAR2273, US). The frequency range is 0.1 Hz to 1 M Hz. The applied bias voltage and the magnitude of the modulation signal were set at an open-circuit voltage of solar cells and 10 mV, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
Structural characteristics

Fig. 1A shows the XRD pattern of the as-synthesised sample, which can be indexed to an orthorhombic Nb3O7F structure with lattice parameters of a = 20.67 Å, b = 3.833 Å and c = 3.927 Å (JCPDS no. 74-2363).21,25,28Fig. 1B shows the surface SEM image of the as-synthesised sample, displaying a uniform microsphere film with microsphere sizes of 2–5 μm diameter. A high magnification SEM image indicates that the obtained microsphere is composed of nanosheets with 10–40 nm thickness (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the cross-sectional SEM image reveals that the formed Nb3O7F nanostructured film consists of a bottom nanosheet layer with 1.5 μm thickness and a top microsphere layer with 18.5 μm thickness, as shown in Fig. 1D and E. The thickness of the whole film is about 20 μm. For solar energy conversion applications, the bottom Nb3O7F nanosheet layer may play an important role in prohibiting electron leakage at the interfaces between FTO and the microsphere layer, thus improving conversion efficiency.35,36 The diffuse reflectance spectra of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film (Fig. SI-1, ESI†) show a higher reflectance in the wavelength range between 400 and 800 nm due to its large microsphere size, which can effectively improve the sunlight utilisation efficiency of the photoanode, and thus the solar cell performance.37 From this point of view, the fabricated Nb3O7F nanostructured film may have potential as a promising photoanode candidate for solar energy conversion applications. A TEM image of an individual Nb3O7F nanosheet from an ultrasound treated sample is shown in Fig. 1F. The SAED pattern (top inset in Fig. 1F) and the HRTEM image (bottom inset in Fig. 1F) reveal a good single crystalline nature of the Nb3O7F nanosheets. Moreover, the nanosheets are transparent. The SAED data confirm a preferred growth along the [010] direction, while the HRTEM image confirms the fringe spacings of 0.393 nm and 0.383 nm, which are consistent with the d values of the (001) and (010) planes of the orthorhombic Nb3O7F, respectively.25 Our experiments also demonstrate that the nanosheets originating from the bottom layer and top microspheres have the same crystal structure. Fig. 1G schematically shows the atomic configuration of the (100) and (010) planes of the Nb3O7F nanosheet. In a previous study reported by another group, the oxygen and fluorine atoms are assumed to substitute each other in a random way in the Nb3O7F crystal structure.25 The structure of Nb3O7F consists of blocks of the ReO3-structure type which are fused together by means of octahedra having edges in common (Fig. 1G).25 Based on the above results, the Nb3O7F nanosheets originating from the top microspheres have (100) and (010) exposed planes, as shown in Fig. 1H. These exposed crystal planes could be advantageous for further sensitiser loading (e.g., CdS quantum dots).

In this work, the effect of different hydrothermal conditions on the resultant Nb3O7F morphology has been investigated. As shown in Fig. SI-2 (ESI†), when the concentration of HF solution was set at 0.5% (v/v), only dispersed nanosheets were observed on the FTO substrate (Fig. SI-2A, ESI†). Moreover, the formed nanosheet film possesses weak mechanical stability and is easy to peel off from the FTO substrate. When the concentration of HF solution was increased to 3.0% (v/v), particle-shaped structures with an average diameter of 100 nm were observed on the FTO substrate (Fig. SI-2B, ESI†), which could be due to the etching role of high concentration HF.38 Similarly, the formed film has weak mechanical stability. Our experiments indicate that an optimum concentration of HF solution is 1.0% (v/v) for direct growth of a highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film on a FTO substrate. Keeping other reaction conditions constant, the experiments on the influence of NbCl5 concentration indicate that the Nb3O7F nanostructured film can be formed on a FTO substrate in the concentration range of 0.03–0.06 M. Either too low or too high concentration of NbCl5 is not favorable for the formation of a stable Nb3O7F nanostructured film (Fig. SI-3A and B, ESI†). Further investigation demonstrates that a highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film can be firmly formed on a FTO substrate at hydrothermal reaction temperature higher than 180 °C (Fig. SI-4B, ESI†). While at a low hydrothermal reaction temperature (e.g., 150 °C), only Nb3O7F microspheres assembled with nanorods can be observed (Fig. SI-4A, ESI†). Compared to the Nb3O7F films formed at higher reaction temperature (≥180 °C), the microsphere film obtained at 150 °C is not very firm and is easy to peel off from the FTO substrate. To investigate the formation process of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film obtained at 200 °C, the effect of the hydrothermal reaction time was investigated in this work. When the hydrothermal reaction time was set at 0.5 h, the Nb3O7F nanoparticle film (Fig. 2A) started to form on the FTO substrate due to the hydrolysis of the NbCl5 precursor in HF solution to form Nb3O7F based on the following equations:21 (1) (2) (3)
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the growth process of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film on the FTO substrate. 
With increasing hydrothermal reaction time, the Nb3O7F concentration in reaction solution was further enhanced, which resulted in the formation of sphere-shaped structures on the FTO substrate (Fig. 2B). The formed Nb3O7F sphere-shaped structure is composed of nanoparticles (Fig. 2B). When the hydrothermal reaction time was set at 1.5 h, it was found that the size of the sphere-shaped structures was further increased (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the surface of the sphere-shaped structure started to form interlaced connected streak structures at this reaction stage (Fig. 2C). Based on the foregoing TEM analysis, the exposed crystal planes of the interlaced connected streak structures should be (010) planes, which are favored for further growth of Nb3O7F nanosheets with a preferred growth along the [010] direction. Further increasing the reaction time to 2 h, nanosheet structures on the Nb3O7F microsphere surface were obviously observed, as shown in Fig. 2D, indicating the growth of Nb3O7F nanosheets. Accompanying the growth of the top Nb3O7F microspheres, the bottom nanosheet layer also formed. A highly crystalline Nb3O7F hierarchically structured film was firmly grown on the FTO substrate at a hydrothermal reaction time of 3 h (Fig. 1B–E).
CdS quantum dot sensitisation
Quantum dot-sensitised solar cells (QDSSCs) have attracted much attention because of their efficient charge separation, transport, and potential performance.39,40 To date, most studies on QDSSCs mainly focus on the use of TiO2 as a photoanode material.39–41 Without doubt, exploration of more alternative materials is highly desired to develop high performance QDSSCs. Recently, Kang et al. investigated a Nb2O5 nanowire photoanode sensitised by a composition-tuned CdSxSe1−x shell for photoelectrochemical cells.42 In comparison with the TiO2–CdSxSe1−x nanowire photoanode, the Nb2O5–CdSxSe1−x nanowire photoanode exhibits excellent photoconversion efficiency.42
In this work, a directly grown highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film on a FTO substrate was sensitised with CdS quantum dots by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.32,33 During sensitisation, the CBD process was repeated up to N times (N = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10), and the corresponding electrodes are denoted as “NbCdS-N”. The CdS quantum dot-sensitised Nb3O7F nanostructured films as photoanodes were subsequently investigated in QDSSCs.

Fig. 3 shows the surface SEM images of CdS quantum dot-sensitised Nb3O7F films with different CBD cycles. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that some CdS crystallites begin to deposit on the nanosheets during initial cycles (e.g., NbCdS-1, Fig. 3B). With further increasing CBD cycles, CdS crystallites form into aggregates of quantum dots, and more and more aggregates were observed on the surface of Nb3O7F nanosheets (Fig. 3C–E). After 10 CBD cycles, the whole Nb3O7F microsphere was almost completely covered by aggregates (NbCdS-10, Fig. 3F). Some studies have indicated that more CBD cycles can result in the increase of particle sizes of CdS aggregates, which can be disadvantageous to improve the resultant solar cell performance.43–45 From Fig. 3, it was also observed that CdS quantum dots are preferentially deposited on the top exposed (010) crystal planes of nanosheets within initial CBD cycles. With increasing CBD cycles, CdS particles appear on the (100) planes of Nb3O7F nanosheets. Fig. 3G shows a TEM image of the Nb3O7F nanosheet after depositing CdS quantum dots with 7 CBD cycles. Obviously, the exposed surface including (010) and (100) surfaces of the nanosheet was uniformly covered by CdS particles, which can be beneficial to improve the resulting solar cell efficiency. HRTEM analysis (Fig. 3H) indicates that the observed 0.335 nm and 0.393 nm fringes correspond to the (111) plane of the cubic phase of CdS (JCPDS no. 65-2887) and the (001) plane of the orthorhombic Nb3O7F, respectively. The insets in Fig. 3A–F show the corresponding photographs of CdS quantum dot-sensitised Nb3O7F samples with different CBD cycles. It can be seen that there was an obvious change in the colour of the sample surface from white for the Nb3O7F sample without CdS sensitisation to light yellow, deep yellow, and orange yellow with increasing CBD cycles, suggesting an increase in the deposition amount of CdS quantum dots.43

(G) TEM image of the Nb3O7F nanosheet after CdS sensitisation with 7 CBD cycles. (H) HRTEM image of the Nb3O7F nanosheet after CdS sensitisation with 7 CBD cycles. The insets are their corresponding photographs. 
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CdS quantum dot-sensitised samples show that the absorption edge of the samples appears to be red shifted with successive CBD cycles, which is mainly due to the increase of the CdS particle size with increasing CBD cycles (Fig. SI-5, ESI†).43 In this work, we also performed energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for the samples before and after CdS sensitisation (Fig. SI-6, ESI†). Obviously, compared to the Nb3O7F sample (Fig. SI-6A, ESI†), Cd and S elements appear in the EDS spectra after CdS deposition (take NbCdS-7 as an example) (Fig. SI-6B, ESI†). Moreover, the molar ratio of Cd to S in the NbCdS-7 sample is approximately 1:1, confirming stoichiometric formation of CdS.
Prior to evaluation of solar cell performance using NbCdS series photoanodes, the photoelectrochemical activity of the fabricated CdS-sensitised Nb3O7F nanostructured films as photoanodes was first measured in a 0.5 M Na2S supporting electrolyte under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm, light intensity = 100 mW cm−2).43Fig. 4A shows the voltammograms of the photoanodes made of Nb3O7F and NbCdS-7 films in a 0.5 M Na2S supporting electrolyte. Apparently, no photocurrent response was observed for the Nb3O7F photoanode under visible light irradiation. For the NbCdS-7 photoanode without visible light irradiation, only a negligible dark current was observed. Under visible light illumination, the NbCdS-7 photoanode shows good visible light response. Fig. 4B shows the transient photocurrent responses of the NbCdS series photoanodes obtained at −0.60 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) applied potential. Obviously, the NbCdS-7 photoanode was found to show the best photoelectrocatalytic activity in all investigated photoanodes. The increase in photocurrent response for NbCdS series photoanodes from NbCdS-1 to NbCdS-7 is mainly ascribed to the increase of the CdS deposition amount with CBD cycles. Further increasing CBD cycles can result in further growth and formation of additional CdS particles to form a thicker CdS particle film (e.g., NbCdS-10). Although a thicker CdS particle film may be beneficial to visible light utilisation, the recombination of photoelectrons and holes occurs more easily, and thus decreases photocurrent response.43 This has been further confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. Many studies have indicated that PL analysis can be used to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes of photocatalysts.46,47 As shown in Fig. SI-7 (ESI†), NbCdS-10 shows a stronger PL intensity than that of NbCdS-7, indicating an improved recombination of photoelectrons and holes of NbCdS-10, and thus decreasing photocurrent response. The above results demonstrate that the photoanode with an appropriate CdS deposition amount can cause the photoelectrons produced by CdS sites to be injected more effectively into the Nb3O7F, thus improving visible light activity of the photoanode. This can be highly advantageous for photoelectrocatalytic and photovoltaic applications. For comparison, we also performed photoelectrochemical experiments using the photoanode made from Nb2O5/CdS-7 (7 CBD cycles). The Nb2O5 film was first obtained by thermal treatment of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film at 550 °C for 2 h. After calcination, the XRD pattern of the calcined sample can be indexed to Nb2O5, suggesting a structural transformation from orthorhombic Nb3O7F to monoclinic Nb2O5 (JCPDS no. 43-1042) (Fig. SI-8A, ESI†). Compared to the XRD result obtained from the as-synthesised Nb3O7F sample, the calcined sample seems to have poor crystallinity owing to the rearrangement of the crystal structure during calcination.48 The SEM image of the calcined sample demonstrates that no obvious change in morphology has occurred after annealing, indicating a high thermal stability of the nanosheet assembled microsphere structure (Fig. SI-8B, ESI†). XPS data (survey spectrum) demonstrate that after annealing at 550 °C, the fluorine element completely disappears, further indicating the structural transformation from orthorhombic Nb3O7F to monoclinic Nb2O5 (Fig. SI-9, ESI†). Fig. SI-10 (ESI†) shows the transient photocurrent responses of NbCdS-7 and Nb2O5/CdS-7 photoanodes at an applied potential of −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Obviously, the photocurrent response of the NbCdS-7 photoanode is higher than that of the Nb2O5/CdS-7 photoanode. This can be attributed to the decrease in crystallinity and surface area of Nb2O5 nanostructures after calcination.

Fig. 5 shows Mott–Schottky plots of NbCdS series photoanodes under visible light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The slope of the tangent line in a Mott–Schottky plot is proportional to 1/ND (ND is the number of donors).49 For NbCdS series photoanodes, the slope order is: NbCdS-7 < NbCdS-5 < NbCdS-10 < NbCdS-3 < NbCdS-1. This indicates that the order of the carrier concentration in NbCdS series photoanode films is NbCdS-7 > NbCdS-5 > NbCdS-10 > NbCdS-3 > NbCdS-1. Higher carrier concentration means that more photoelectrons can be effectively transferred to an external circuit in a photoelectrocatalytic reaction, leading to a higher photocurrent response. The above results are consistent with the results of photoelectrocatalytic experiments of NbCdS series photoanodes. Based on Mott–Schottky plots, the flat band potential of NbCdS-N photoanodes is approximately −0.87 V for NbCdS-7, −0.84 V for NbCdS-5, −0.79 V for NbCdS-10, −0.78 V for NbCdS-3, and −0.76 V for NbCdS-1, respectively (Fig. 5). Obviously, compared to other NbCdS photoanodes, a negative shift occurs in the flat band potential of NbCdS-7, which can result in an increase in the open-circuit voltage of solar cells.43

In this work, we performed QDSSC evaluation using NbCdS-5, NbCdS-7 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes as examples under the standard AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 6A shows typical photocurrent density–photovoltage curves (J–V curves) of the resulting QDSSCs. Apparently, the NbCdS-7 photoanode possesses the highest short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.91 mA cm−2 that is almost 1.3 and 1.6 times of the NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes, respectively. The high photocurrent density of the NbCdS-7 photoanode can be due to the higher carrier concentration generated in the NbCdS-7 photoanode film in comparison with those in NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanode films. An open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 511 mV was obtained from the NbCdS-7 photoanode, which is 20 mV and 28 mV greater than those obtained from the NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes. Compared to the NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes, the higher Voc of the NbCdS-7 photoanode is mainly ascribed to an apt CdS deposition amount of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film causing the negative shift of the flat band potential, and thus resulting in Voc improvement.43 As a result, the NbCdS-7 photoanode exhibits an overall light conversion efficiency of 1.68% that is almost 1.4 and 1.9 times of the NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes, respectively. The key characteristics of these photoanodes are summarised in Table 1. Fig. 6B shows the IPCE spectra of NbCdS-5, NbCdS-7 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 6B, the NbCdS-7 photoanode displays the highest IPCE amongst all photoanodes, further confirming the significant role of an apt CdS deposition amount in the Nb3O7F nanostructured film.

The electron transport inside the photoanode has an important influence on the resultant solar cell performance, which can be investigated by an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique.16,33,50Fig. 7A shows the Nyquist plots of the QDSSCs assembled by the NbCdS-5, NbCdS-7 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes. As shown, a small and a large semicircle within high-frequency and middle-frequency regions were observed for all photoanodes, which is due to the electron transfer at the Pt–electrolyte interface (redox reaction of S2−/Sx2−) and the Nb3O7F–CdS–electrolyte interfaces, respectively. Obviously, Nyquist plots of all photoanodes indicate that the charge transfer resistance order is NbCdS-7 < NbCdS-5 < NbCdS-10. The electron lifetime (τn) in the CdS sensitised Nb3O7F nanostructured films can be estimated using τn = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle-frequency peak.16 As shown in Fig. 7B, the fmax values are 8.3 Hz for NbCdS-7, 22.9 Hz for NbCdS-5, and 35.1 Hz for NbCdS-10, respectively. Correspondingly, the electron lifetime (τn) is calculated to be 19.2, 7.0 and 4.5 ms for the cells assembled by the NbCdS-7, NbCdS-5 and NbCdS-10 photoanodes, respectively. The above results further demonstrate that an apt CdS deposition amount of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film can result in higher carrier concentration and longer electron lifetime, thus improving solar energy conversion efficiency.

Dye sensitisation
In our previous report, a single crystal Nb3O7(OH) nanorod film was directly grown on a FTO substrate by a facile hydrothermal method.16 Without the need for further calcination, the single crystal Nb3O7(OH) nanorod film can be directly used as a photoanode, showing an impressive solar energy conversion efficiency (η = 6.77%) owing to the high crystallinity and large surface area of nanorods.16 In this work, a highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film was also investigated in DSSCs. Without the need for further calcination, the Nb3O7F nanostructured film as a photoanode material was first sensitised with N719 dye (3 × 10−4 mol L−1) for 24 h before DSSC measurement. For comparison, the Nb2O5 nanostructured film obtained by thermal treatment of the Nb3O7F nanostructured film at 550 °C was also sensitised with N719 dye to investigate its DSSC performance. After calcination, the formed Nb2O5 nanostructured film possesses a thickness of ca. 18.6 μm. The decrease in film thickness compared to the Nb3O7F film (ca. 20 μm) can be ascribed to the film structure collapse during high temperature calcination. This concurrently results in the decrease in the surface area of the calcined sample (BET = 26.1 m2 g−1) compared to that of the Nb3O7F sample (BET = 35.7 m2 g−1). This may not be beneficial to high dye loading for the Nb3O7F film. Fig. SI-11 (ESI†) shows the current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs assembled with the Nb3O7F and Nb2O5 photoanodes. As shown, the DSSCs assembled with the Nb3O7F photoanodes display a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.02 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 697 mV, a fill factor (FF) of 66.2% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 2.78%, whereas DSSCs assembled with Nb2O5 photoanodes possess a Jsc of 5.54 mA cm−2, an Voc of 686 mV, a FF of 55.3% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 2.10%. Compared with Nb2O5 photoanodes, a 32.4% improvement in the overall conversion efficiency was achieved by using Nb3O7F photoanodes. Such a significant increase in the overall conversion efficiency could be due to the high crystallinity and relatively large surface area of Nb3O7F nanostructures in comparison with Nb2O5 nanostructures. The above results demonstrate that the highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured film can become a promising candidate as a photoanode material to further improve the DSSC performance.
It is well known that the matching of the conduction band energies between the photoanode material and the sensitiser plays a key role in the construction of high performance photovoltaics.43 For this, we performed an X-ray photoelectron valence-band (VB) spectra experiment with the as-synthesised Nb3O7F nanostructured film. Based on the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-synthesised Nb3O7F nanostructured film (Fig. 8A), a band gap of 3.12 eV can be obtained for the Nb3O7F nanostructured film. The X-ray photoelectron valence band (VB) spectra reveal a VB maximum of ca. 1.94 eV for Nb3O7F, which is very close to the VB value of TiO2 (Fig. 8B).51,52 Due to similar values of the band gap and the valence band with TiO2, the as-synthesised Nb3O7F should be suitable as a promising candidate for CdS quantum dot (dye)-sensitised solar cells from the point of view of the matching of the conduction band energies (Fig. 8C).

4 Conclusions
In summary, the highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films have been successfully fabricated on FTO substrates through a facile and one-pot hydrothermal method. Without the need for further calcination, the highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films can be directly sensitised with CdS quantum dots by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The resultant CdS quantum dot-sensitised Nb3O7F films with optimised CBD cycles (7 CBD cycles in our case) show excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. An overall light conversion efficiency of 1.68% can be achieved from a quantum dot-sensitised solar cell (QDSSC) assembled with the NbCdS-7 photoanode. An appropriate CdS deposition amount on Nb3O7F nanostructures can produce high carrier concentration and long electron lifetime, thus resulting in excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity and relatively high QDSSC efficiency. Without the need for further calcination, the highly crystalline Nb3O7F nanostructured films have also been investigated in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs), exhibiting an overall light conversion efficiency of 2.78%. This study indicates the feasibility of developing alternative photoanode materials for solar energy conversion applications.
