    , Accepted 18th April 2016First published on 19th April 2016AbstractThere has been fast recent progress in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) towards low cost photovoltaic technology. Organometal mixed halide (MAPbX or FAPbX) perovskites are the most promising light absorbing material sandwiched between the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). These two layers play a critical role in boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and maintaining air stability. However, the device stability is a serious issue in regular as well as p-i-n inverted type perovskite solar cells. This mini-review briefly outlines the state-of-art of p-i-n/n-i-p type planar hybrid perovskite solar cells using MAPbX/FAPbX perovskite absorbing layers. Later, we will focus on recent trends, progress and further opportunities in exploring the air stable hybrid planar structure PSCs.Sawanta S. MaliDr Sawanta S.

1. Introduction
In the last few years perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have started ‘once again’1 as red-hot and promising light harvesting materials in photovoltaic technology applications. Initially, PSCs showed 3.81% power conversion efficiency (PCE)2 using methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI3) perovskites in 2009. After two years, N. G. Park et al. synthesized methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) quantum dots (QDs) and reported a 6.5% PCE using an iodine-based redox electrolyte in 2011.3 However, the stability of these cells was improved by Gratzel et al.4 using solid state hole transporting materials (HTMs) and demonstrated a breakthrough 13% stable conversion efficiency. After this breakthrough efficiency in 2013, a variety of processing technologies such as in situ synthesis,5ex situ synthesis,6 temperature dependant spin coating,7 solvent engineering,8 compositional engineering,9 dual source thermal processing,10 moisture assisted growth,11 additives12 and intramolecular exchange processes (IEPs)13 have been used in order to push the PCE up to 22.1%.67 The life-cycle assessment and rapid energy payback time (EPBT) are the most promising aspects in order to commercialize the red-hot perovskite photovoltaic technology. Recently, You et al. discussed and compared parameters such as the EPBT, device stability, life cycle environmental impact and an endpoint evaluation by following the Eco-indicator 99 methodology in detail.14
To date, methylammonium mixed halide (MAPbX) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbX) have achieved 16.2%9 and 20.1%13 PCEs respectively. Moreover, negligible hysteresis via optimization of the each layer, an extremely uniform and dense structure via toluene dripping, tuning of the band gap via composition variation, a long diffusion length (∼100 nm for polycrystalline MAPbI3,15,16 >175 μm for MAPbI3 single crystals,17 >1 μm for MAPbI3−xClx15) and a high absorption coefficient are key features of perovskite materials. However, polymer-based HTLs suffer from low energy and relatively low charge mobility compared to p-type metal oxides. Moreover, the optimization of each layer while maintaining their charge mobility, electron balance and optical transmittance becomes a typically necessary step in the fabrication of efficient n-i-p (regular planar) and p-i-n (inverted planar) hybrid PSC structures. There are two device configurations used for metal oxide ETLs in planar hybrid structures. Firstly there is the p-type metal oxide ETL and C60 or PCBM as the HTL (p-i-n), while the second type contains p-type metal oxide as the HTL and n-type metal oxide as the ETL for inverted type PSCs (p-i-n). Scheme 1 shows the various types of PSCs depending on their ETL and HTL positions. In this review, we focus on the current research trends in PSCs towards air stability using p-type HTLs, n-type ETLs and organometal halide perovskite absorbing layers. In addition, we have also discussed the merits and demerits of metal oxide (MO)-based HTLs for PSCs, and proposed the possible future device configuration for efficient air stable PSCs.

2. Regular mesoporous and planar structures of PSCs
PSCs are mainly divided into two categories: regular, and planar (either n-i-p (regular planar) or p-i-n (inverted planar)-type PSCs). For the regular type, PSCs are again divided into two types, planar and heterostructured (mesoporous) PSCs, which demonstrate the original idea of solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs). The regular-type PSCs consist of an n-type metal oxide blocking layer (BL), with or without (planar or heterostructured/mesoporous) a metal oxide scaffold (mp-TiO2,18 Zn2SnO4,19–21 ZnO,22 Y:TiO2,23 SnO2,24 BaSnO3,25 Al2O3,26 SiO2@Al2O3,27 Au@TiO228etc.) sensitized with perovskite material, with or without an organometallic halide perovskite over-layer, hole transport materials (HTMs) like 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-pdimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),29 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)30 and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),31 CuSCN32 and CuI,33 and counter electrodes (Au/Ag/Al/). However, polymer HTMs like spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA suffer from high cost and low stability. The preparation of these HTM solutions is a tedious job and high purity is needed. Furthermore, the organic HTMs limit the commercialization of PSCs. On the other hand, HTM-free perovskite solar cells are one of the options toward air and moisture stability. Yang et al.34 developed carbon paint and covered it onto the perovskite layer in order to avoid perovskite degradation by air and moisture, and demonstrated a 14.38% efficiency for a 7 mm2 device. However the device efficiency drastically decreased to 9.72% for a large (1 cm2) area device. There are also a few more reports mentioning that carbon or graphene-based electron extraction layers play a key role in the improvement of the stability of PSCs. Kumar et al.35 used graphite paste and reported a 1.11% efficiency. Yang et al.36a used multilayered graphene (MG) as a hole extraction layer for HTL-free PSCs and demonstrated a 11.5% (0.15 cm2) efficiency. Therefore, either physical methods or low temperature solution-processed p-type and n-type metal oxide-based HTLs/ETLs open new approaches in the PSC family. Mali et al., used low temperature hydrothermal technique for synthesis of 1D TiO2 ETL followed by ultrathin TiO2 passivation using atomic layer deposited (ALD) technique and demonstrated >13% efficiency.36b
3. Inverted p-i-n type planar structured PSCs
The inverted hybrid planar PSCs are divided into two main types. These types have been divided based on their type of hole transporting layer (HTL) and electron transporting layer (ETL), such as regular planar (n-i-p) and inverted planar (p-i-n) structures. These details are represented in Scheme 1.
3.1. Organic hole transport layer (HTL) based PSCs

3.1.1. Organic hole transport layer (HTL) and PCBM electron transport layer (ETL). 
The inverted p-i-n type PSCs consist of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) as a promising hole transport layer (HTL) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), C60 and their derivatives as n-type electron transport layers (ETLs).37 Jeng et al.37 firstly demonstrated an inverted PSC using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and PCBM as the ETL. Fig. 1(a and b) illustrate the device configuration used for the first inverted PSC and its respective energy level diagram. Here C60 or its derivatives such as PCBM is used as the ‘electron acceptor’ and PEDOT:PSS used as the hole transport layer. This system illustrates a donor–acceptor polymer/organic planar heterojunction (PHJ) system. Here C60 and MAPbI3 act as the acceptor and donor respectively. As a result, depositing or growing a thin layer of the “acceptor” material on the MAPbI3 perovskite film is expected to create a donor–acceptor contact interface for charge separation. This hybrid perovskite/acceptor PHJ shows a photovoltaic effect. The MAPbI3 (DMF)/PCBM (25 nm) PHJ device exhibits a VOC = 0.60 V, JSC = 10.30 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.63, corresponding to an optimized PCE of 3.9%. After this, several manuscripts were published with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and PCBM as the ETL. Sun et al.38 used PEDOT:PSS and PC61BM as the HTL and ETL respectively, and studied the MAPbI3/PC61BM bilayer solar cell interface and demonstrated an improved FF of up to 0.76 with a 7.4% PCE. The authors also concluded that the thickness of the active layer (<100 nm) and processing temperature (<150 °C) are the most critical factors in order to improve the PCE (Fig. 1c–e). Yang et al.39 demonstrated a low temperature solution processed MAPbI3−xClx perovskite with PCEs of 11.5% (for rigid substrate) and 9.2% (for flexible substrate). However, the authors also concluded that the optimization of uniform PCBM is a difficult task in order to improve the device performance.

However, due to the formation of low energy of lead halide perovskites and acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS organic HTLs, PSCs suffer from degradation problems in moisture and air. On the other hand, the low hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS and optimization of the uniform PCMB ETL layer hinders the efficiency and stability of PSCs. From this study it is clear that the HTL and ETL played important roles in order to improve the efficiency and maintain the stability of the PSCs.39 From the above discussion, it is clear that PEDOT:PSS has been widely used as an ETL for inverted PSCs due to its good conductivity. However, PEDOT:PSS is hydrophilic and can easily absorb water from the surrounding environment. In addition to this, PEDOT:PSS has acidic properties that could potentially react with the bottom metal oxide layers. Therefore there is a need to determine a perfect solution with a highly stable HTL and ETL in order to achieve air stable PSCs. Recently, Bi et al. used poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) as the HTL and PCBM/C60/BCP as the ETL, which demonstrated a 18.1% PCE with less hysteresis. Here, the non-wetting surface was used in order to grow high-aspect-ratio crystalline grains.40 A detailed literature survey of p-i-n type inverted PSCs with various HTLs and ETLs is discussed in Table 1.

3.1.2. Organic HTL and n-type metal oxide ETL (p-i-n inverted). 
Although this type is one of the possible options for inverted PSCs towards stability, however, so far there are no reports available. Researchers have used either an organic HTL and PCBM ETL, or an organic HTL and PCBM/p-type metal oxide ETL.


3.1.3. Organic HTL and PCBM/n-type MO ETL (p-i-n inverted planar): stability aspect. 
The problem of uniform deposition of PCBM has been tackled by Snaith et al.41 using a PCBM/TiOx bilayer ETL layer for p-i-n inverted planar PSCs. This PCBM/TiOx bilayer ETL facilitates an improvement in the perfect coverage of the ETL onto the perovskite layer. With this architecture the authors demonstrated 11.8% (best one for regular rigid type), 9.8% (best one for inverted rigid type) and 6% (for flexible) PCEs using the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite (Fig. 2). However both devices suffered from a low FF and moderate stability. Based on the same concept Bai et al.42 used PCBM/colloidal ZnO NCs as an ETL for planar inverted PSCs (Fig. 3). The authors concluded that the stability of such a device drastically improved up to 140 h. The authors demonstrated different electron/hole diffusion lengths with respect to temperature and showed 15.9% (small-area ≤0.1 cm2) and 12.3% (large-area ≥1 cm2) PCEs for the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/colloidal ZnO NC/Al configuration. Both of large area and small area devices would affect the long-term stability of the perovskite solar cell. These devices show only 1% hysteresis in the forward and reverse scans (Fig. 4a). The authors concluded that the introduction of an additional ZnO nanocrystal interlayer between the PCBM and Al electrode is critical in terms of improving the hole blocking properties of the cathode contacts, preventing the direct contact of the electrodes and the perovskite layers, and enhancing the ambient stability of the devices. The ZnO interlayer dramatically improves the hole-blocking capability due to its deep valence band level. This architecture facilitates enhanced charge selectivity of the cathode contacts. The reverse saturation dark current of the ZnO NC-based device is much higher than the bare device Fig. 4(b). Furthermore, the ZnO NC layer avoids direct contact between the Al contact and the perovskite, resulting in a higher PCE.

Similarly, Zhang et al.43 developed a low temperature method for the synthesis of ZnO for planar p-i-n PSCs with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/ZnO/Al device configuration. The uniformity device performance was optimized by fast and slow growth of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite. The optimized fast grown perovskite device without a ZnO interlayer shows a 14.5% PCE, while the slow grown perovskite with a ZnO interlayer shows a 16.8% PCE. Interestingly it is observed that without a ZnO interlayer the devices are dead after few hours, while the devices with a ZnO interlayer show a stable PCE for up to 60 days (Fig. 5).

3.2. p-Type metal oxide HTL and PCBM ETL
Recently, p-type metal oxides have demonstrated a much higher carrier mobility and superior stability than the organic materials.44,45 The p-type Cu2O or CuO have a unique properties like low cost and environmental friendliness, and can be used as HTLs in PSCs. Ding et al.46 adopted an in situ low-temperature method to synthesize cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and copper oxide (CuO) as hole transport materials, and they demonstrated 13.35% and 12.16% efficiencies respectively. Pal et al.47 synthesized Cu2O by the Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) technique and reported 8.23% and 8.30% efficiencies for MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx respectively. Furthermore, Wu et al.48 used a sputtering technique for the synthesis of a Cu layer followed by thermal annealing for the synthesis of Cu2O and demonstrated an 11.03% efficiency for a 5 nm thick Cu2O thin film. It is well known that p-type NiO has a higher hole mobility (10−5 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a higher open circuit voltage than PEDOT:PSS. Hsu et al.44 studied the effect of spin-coated PCBM for NiOx HTL-based p-i-n PSCs and achieved a 7.8% PCE for NiOx/MAPbI3 (9500 rpm)/PCBM. Based on this prediction, inorganic charge transport layers like NiOx and Cu:NiOx49 have been used as HTLs for regular as well as inverted PSCs. Tian et al.50 synthesised solution processed p-type BL NiO and mesoporous NiO for inverted type PSCs. The thickness of both BL NiO and mp-NiO were varied, and finally a 80 nm BL NiO and 120 nm mesoporous NiO HTL-based inverted PSC was shown to have a 1.5% PCE with a 0.2 cm2 active area. Recently pulsed laser deposition (PLD)51 and sputtered52 techniques have been used for the synthesis of p-type NiO HTLs for inverted PSCs with 17.3% and 11.6% PCEs respectively. However, nanostructured p-type NiO metal oxides can also be processed easily via solution at low temperatures.53 Zhu et al.54 adopted sol–gel processed NiO NCs (40 nm thick HTL) and demonstrated a 9.11% PCE. Park et el.55 developed a novel hybrid HTL for p-i-n inverted planar PSCs. The solution method is simple and cost effective and can easily control the HTL thickness. The solution processed ultrathin NiOx-based devices showed an 11.4% PCE which was further improved by addition of a 1.0% PEDOT/NiOx layer and reached a PCE up to 13.9%. Furthermore a 1 v/v% PEDOT/NiOx HTL-based device showed a 15.1% PCE (JSC = 20.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.04 V, FF = 0.72) with minimum hysteresis.
Wang et al.52 used p-type mesoscopic NiO (meso-NiO) and demonstrated a 9.51% PCE for the first type of inverted PSCs (Fig. 6). The low temperature sputtered NiO and meso-NiO is discussed here. Fig. 6(a) shows the typical device structure of NiO metal oxide ETL-based p-i-n type inverted PSCs. Here NiO acts as the HTL and PCBM acts as the ETL. Under irradiation holes and electrons are then separated at the donor–acceptor interface. The holes travel through mp-NiOnc/sputtered NiOx and electrons are accepted by PCBM and produce electricity. This mechanism is discussed in Fig. 6b. In the present case the authors used sputtered NiO and solution processed NiO nanocrystals for improving the PCE of PSCs. With this configuration a 9.51% PCE was demonstrated which was further improved up to 11.6% by optimizing the sputtering parameters.52 The pure argon atmosphere and oxygen flow ratio are the most critical points in order to obtain the 11.6% PCE. Hu et el.56 used a solution processed spin coating technique for the synthesis of NiO thin films and demonstrated a 7.6% PCE for UV zone (UVO)-treated NiO thin films. Subbiah et al. used the electrodeposition technique for the synthesis of CuSCN and NiO as the HTL and demonstrated 3.8% and 7.3% PCEs respectively.57 Trifiletti et al.58 synthesized mesoscopic NiO thin films that demonstrated 2.9% and 2.7% PCEs for MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx perovskites respectively.

On the other hand, Seok et al.51 used the pulse laser deposition (PLD) technique for the synthesis of a uniform and compact NiO layer (Fig. 7). The influence of oxygen pressure and NiO film thickness has been studied, and a 17.3% PCE (VOC = 1.06 V, FF = 0.813, JSC = 20.2 mA cm−2) was demonstrated for a nanostructured NiO film with 150 nm thickness. From this it is also concluded that the ETL thickness plays a key role in order to improve the PCE of PSCs. The lower thickness resulted in inefficient electron blocking, while disordered NiO films suffered from inefficient hole extraction from the perovskite layer. Therefore an ordered uniform nanostructured NiO (∼150 nm) thin layer facilitates efficient electron blocking, and hole extraction results in a higher PCE.

Based on similar ideas we have also developed a modified solution process for the deposition of highly uniform and transparent NiO nanocrystalline (NC) thin films. The thickness of the NiO HTL layer was optimized via a simple multistep spin coating technique and the optimized device with 70 nm NiO shows η = 15.31% with VOC = 1.056 V and JSC = 19.85 mA cm−2 using an MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.3) perovskite (Fig. 8).59Fig. 8(d) shows the evolution of stable photocurrent measurements and the solar cell performance over time of the champion devices under illumination using ∼75 nm NiO thin films. The photocurrent density at 5 s is 12 mA cm−2 but increased up to 19.70 mA cm−2 after 20 s of constant illumination, and gives stable >15% PCE over a 300 s measurement window. These results clearly revealed the good photocurrent stability of inverted p-type p-i-n PSCs based on a nanparticulated NiO HTL. The compact and nanocrystalline nature of the NiO thin film facilitates high optical transmittance and excellent hole mobility.

Further, Jen et al. used Cu:NiOx60 as a HTL, showing markedly improved air stability as compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The PCE of the Cu:NiOx-based device remains above 90% of the initial value even after 240 h of storage in air (light soaking has not been mentioned). Recently, Han et al.61 developed a new device architecture based on compact NiO and mesoporous Al2O3 for high optical transparency and a specific dual blocking effect. This architecture facilitates minimum light absorption loss and interfacial recombination loss (Fig. 9). Based on this configuration Han et al. reported a 13.61% PCE for 10–20 nm compact NiO and 90 nm meso-Al2O3. Here the authors suggested that Al2O3 strongly passivates the FTO/MAPbI interface, and helps to block the shunt paths between NiO/PCBM via the meso-Al2O3 layer with the perovskite filled between both (Fig. 9b). The ultrathin NiO (10–20 nm) and transparent meso-Al2O3 guarantee an excellent optical transmittance, which can minimize the optical loss in NiO based PSCs. Seok et al. developed an intramolecular exchange process (IEP) for the synthesis of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) and applied it with solution processed NiO in the form FTO/perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al (p-i-n architecture). The optimized device shows a 20.2% PCE, however this device suffered from strong hysteresis.13

3.3. p-Type MO HTL and n-type MO ETL: composition aspect
Very recently You et al.62 developed a similar device architecture via solution processed p-type NiOx (HTL) and n-type ZnO (ETL), and showed a 16.1% PCE with high air stability. The air stability of perovskite solar cells has been extended up to 60 days by replacing PCBM with ZnO. The champion device had the ITO/NiOx (80 nm)/MAPbI3 (320 nm)/ZnO(70 nm)/Al configuration. This device shows negligible hysteresis in the forward and reverse scans (Fig. 10). However, the stability in an open atmosphere and constant illumination is the main issue. This issue can be removed by proper device encapsulation. These issues still remain in the PSC family for future commercialization. Nejand et al.63 used a metal oxide-based regular n-i-p planar structure with p-type NiOx and n-type TiO2 as the HTL and ETL respectively to form a hybrid planar structure. The uniform and crack-free coverage of the NiOx HTL was achieved by deposition by DC reactive magnetron sputtering on the perovskite active layer. This compact NiOx layer protects the MAPbI3−xClx layer against moisture and mechanical damage. The champion cell with the FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/NiOx/Ni configuration shows a 7.28% PCE with JSC = 17.88 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.77 V and FF = 0.53. The fabricated inverted type PSCs showed long-term durability over more than two months compared to the traditional spiro-OMeTAD-based HTM.

3.4. p-Type MO HTL and PCBM/n-type MO ETL: composition aspect
Based on the above discussion, it is clear that metal oxide-based ETLs are the best possibility towards stable efficient PSCs. However, uniform deposition of the PCBM ETL on the perovskite layer and maintaining electron mobility are critical issues. Therefore, Chen et al.64 synthesized heavily p-doped NixMg1−xO and n-doped TiOx by a chemical process and used as the HTL and ETL respectively for PSCs with a 16.2% PCE. Chen et al. adopted this mechanism and developed heavily p-doped (p+) NixMg1−xO and n-doped (n+) TiOx contacts to extract selectively photogenerated charge carriers from an inverted planar MAPbI3–PCBM film architecture. Here NixMg1−xO and Ti(Nb)Ox act as the HTL and ETL respectively. The optimized composition NixMg1−xO HTL (i.e. Li0.05Mg0.15Ni0.80) of 20 nm thickness and the PCBM layer (80 nm followed by Ti(Nb)Ox (i.e. Ti0.95Nb0.05Ox) of 10 nm thickness shows a 16.2% PCE with >7 day stability). This champion device is much more stable than PCBM-based devices.
We believe that NiO, doped NiO or ternary compounds based on NiO will be promising HTLs while n-type TiOx, heavily doped (n-type) Ti(Nb)Ox, ZnO NCs or graphene/metal oxide composites are promising ETL materials that should be further investigated to achieve future p-i-n inverted PSCs close to the theoretical efficiencies. This aspect is currently underway in our laboratory and we expect excellent stable efficiency based on this configuration.
4. Conclusions and outlook
PSCs have exceeded PCEs of 20% via intramolecular exchange processes (IEPs),13 solvent engineering and a 21.1% PCE via a cation mixing process.65,66 However, the air stability using traditional HTLs or ETLs is still the main issue for their commercialization. Hybrid perovskites and solution processed ETLs/HTLs are the ideal candidates for the development of cost effective, simple, air stable efficient perovskite solar cells. The present review revealed that the solution processed doped or undoped p-type NiO as the ETL and doped/undoped n-type TiO2, ZnO nanocrystals pave the way towards air stable, hysteresis-free, efficient perovskite solar cells. However, the 60 day stability is not enough for commercialization of these inverted type p-i-n perovskite solar cells. We conclude that TCO/modified p-type metal oxide/IEP (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/modified n-type metal oxide/Al could show >25%. air stable power conversion efficiency (Fig. 11).† The stability of the devices will be further improved using alternative stable perovskite materials and stabilizing additives. The hysteresis issue can be nullified using doped n-type metal oxides. The present solution process also suffers from the high temperature needed to process metal oxides (≥300 °C for NiO), which limits the flexibility of the PSCs. Therefore, a low temperature solution process for the synthesis of p-type/n-type stable metal oxides is still needed in order make ideal, low cost, air stable (at least >6 months) efficient PSCs. We strongly believe that these approaches will help to make the dream of stable perovskite solar cells come true.
 Fig. 11  Probable future device configuration for highly efficient and air stable perovskite solar cells. Note: the energy level values for the mixed perovskite have been mentioned as per a band gap of 1.55 eV and available literature. However, there might be the possibility of different values with respect to different compositions.

Footnote
† The authors declared that the predicted >25% efficiency for PSC is only the authors’ opinion based on the reported literature and considering ideal conditions like VOC = >1.1 V, FF = >80%, and JSC = >25 mA cm−2. There might be the possibility of lower or higher efficiencies. The authors declare no competing financial interests.
