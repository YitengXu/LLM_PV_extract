    , Accepted 13th December 2014First published on 15th December 2014AbstractIn this study, photocatalytic activities of BaZrO3 for CO2 reduction were investigated in detail. BaZrO3 samples were successfully obtained via a Pechini process at different temperatures. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area measurement, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effects of the deposition of various metal nanoparticles on the surface of BaZrO3 were also discussed. The results proved that the highly dispersed silver nanoparticles play a crucial role in improving the photocatalytic activities of BaZrO3.
1. Introduction
Nowadays with the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels and the rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, environmental pollution and greenhouse effect become more obvious, which raise increasing concerns about the ensuing crisis of energy supply and global climate. Also, CO2 is supposed to be the most important greenhouse gas.1,2 An ideal way to cut down the increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 and relieve the crisis of fossil energy simultaneously is to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons under solar irradiation. However, CO2 could not absorb irradiation in the wavelength range of 200–900 nm, indicating that the photoreduction of CO2 requires suitable photosensitizers. Both metal complexes and semiconductors have been utilized to absorb visible/UV irradiation and transfer this energy to CO2.3 Since CO2 can be photoreduced into hydrocarbons under UV light at room temperature and ambient pressure,4 applying the photocatalyst with a cocatalyst is also a promising way to efficiently solve the problems mentioned above.5–7
To date, TiO2-based photocatalysts have been developed extensively for CO2 photoreduction.8–15 Recently, other photocatalysts such as ZnGa2O4,2 Zn2GeO4,16 NaNbO3,17 Bi2WO6 (ref. 18) and BaLa4Ti4O15 (ref. 19) have been studied for photo-reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons. The development of new photocatalysts for CO2 conversion could enhance our understanding of this photoreduction process.20
BaZrO3 has been extensively studied for over ten years.21,22 Due to its small thermal expansion coefficient, poor thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, thermal stability and low chemical reactivity towards corrosive compounds, it has been investigated in various applications, such as a thermal barrier coating material in the airspace industry, a good substrate for manufacturing high temperature superconductors23 and a material for interface engineering of alumina fiber–alumina matrix composites.24,25 Pure BaZrO3 has been also proved to be an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting under UV light irradiation. For the cubic perovskite structure BaZrO3 with 180° Zr–O–Zr bond angle, the photogenerated electrons and holes in BaZrO3 should be easy to delocalize and transfer to the surface.26 The evolution rate of H2 was 522.0 μmol h−1 g−1, which was significantly higher than that of the pure anatase TiO2 powders.26
The DFT (density functional theory) calculation results of BaZrO3 show that the top of the VB is composed of O 2p orbitals, while the bottom of the CB is dominated by Zr 4d orbitals. Besides, the top of the VB and the bottom of the CB are located at the R point and the G point, respectively, which indicate that BaZrO3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor.27 The calculated band gap (3.2 eV) is smaller than the experimental value (4.8 eV). The bottom of the CB and the top of the VB of BaZrO3 are located at −1.8 eV and 3.0 eV versus NHE, pH 7.0, respectively. The photogenerated electrons in the CB are more negative than the potentials of CH4/CO2, CH3OH/CO2, HCHO/CO2 and HCOOH/CO2 redox couples. The corresponding holes in the VB can easily oxidize H2O. Thus the energy of the photogenerated electrons and holes should be sufficient for CO2 photoreduction using water as a reducing agent under UV irradiation. But the width of its band gap severely restricts the absorption of light.28
To the best of our knowledge, no results have been reported about the photocatalytic activity of BaZrO3 for CO2 reduction under UV light irradiation. Furthermore, it is important to investigate the photocatalytic activity of BaZrO3 with the assistance of cocatalysts. In this study, a series of BaZrO3 samples were synthesized by the Pechini technique and characterized by X-ray diffraction, BET surface area measurement, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, SEM and TEM. The photocatalytic activities of BaZrO3 with various cocatalysts loaded in CO2 reduction under UV irradiation have also been investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample synthesis
The BaZrO3 samples were prepared using the same method as that reported by our previous paper.26 Stoichiometric amounts of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and Ba(NO3)2 (both are of analytical reagent grade) were initially prepared in a beaker. Then, a mixture of 60 wt% citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7, purity ≥99.9%) and 40 wt% ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, purity ≥99.9%) (the molar ratio of citric acid to total cations was fixed at 2:1) was added to the beaker. Subsequently a solution was acquired by adding distilled water to the beaker. This solution was homogenized by stirring at room temperature for about 1 h. Then the prepared clear solution was evaporated in a baking oven at 343 K until a brown resin was formed. The obtained resin was heated for 6 h at 673 K to remove the majority of the organics. After that, the obtained solid was ground using an agate mortar, and finally thermally sintered at different temperatures (1173, 1273, 1373, 1473 K) for 10 h under air atmosphere.
Noble metals (Ag, Au, Pt) were deposited on the surface of BaZrO3 as the different cocatalysts through liquid phase chemical reduction according to a reported method.19 A cation solution (AgNO3, HAuCl4, H2PtCl6) of 0.1 mol L−1 was added to 30 ml of an aqueous suspension containing 0.2 g of BaZrO3. After adding an equimolar amount of NaH2PO2 (0.4 mol L−1) with respect to the cation in the suspension, the mixture was stirred at 333 K for 1 h. The obtained mixture was washed with distilled water and dried at 343 K in air. Then the sample was annealed at 573 K for 1 h.29
The deposition of Cu and Ru cocatalysts was carried out via an impregnation method. The corresponding cation solution (CuCl2, (NH4)2RuCl6) and calcination at 723 K for 1 h were selected as the conditions of the impregnation method. The reduction treatment was carried out under H2 gas flow at 573 K for 2 h.
2.2 Characterization
The data of the crystal structure and the phase purity were collected by a powder X-ray diffractometer (Ultima III, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. The acceleration voltage was 40 kV, and the emission current was 40 mA. The diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 20° to 80° at a scan rate of 10° min−1. The UV-vis reflectance spectra were recorded with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan) using BaSO4 as the background. The specific surface area of the BaZrO3 samples was determined by BET measurement (TriStar-3000, Micromeritics, USA) using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 3010) was employed to characterize the surface morphologies of BaZrO3 powder and silver nanoparticles. The gas products were detected using a gas chromatograph with a double-FID (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan).
2.3 Photocatalytic experiments
The photocatalytic reaction was executed in a cylindrical quartz cell. A plate glass loader filled with the fresh sample (0.1 g) was placed in the cell. The reaction system was connected with a traditional vacuum system and stabilized at ambient temperature by flowing cool water. After the sample was loaded, the reaction system was evacuated to about 1 mTorr using a mechanical pump and then sealed. Carbon dioxide (99.99% pure) was transmitted into the reaction system until the pressure reached 93.5 kPa. Before adding 0.4 ml of distilled water into the reaction system, the distilled water was heated at 100 °C in order to drive out the dissolved O2. Then, the sample absorbed CO2 and water vapor for 8 h in the dark with the gas circulator working. Before illumination, 1 ml of the gas sample was withdrawn and injected into the gas chromatograph by using a gas-tight syringe (1 ml) and the analysis was used as the reference.
In the experiments, a 300 W Xe lamp (PE 300BUV) was used as the light source. The whole reaction system was tightly closed during the irradiation. According to the analysis using the gas chromatograph, methane was the major hydrocarbon in all these experiments. Therefore, the direct measure of activity toward CO2 photoreduction was referenced to the methane yield. To make sure that the hydrocarbon products were attributed to the photoreduction of CO2, three contrast tests were carried out. The first one was UV-illuminated without the catalyst, the second one was the dark reaction under the same experimental conditions and the third one was illuminated with the photocatalyst in the absence of CO2. All the reactions have been repeated more than five times to confirm the reproducibility and consistency of the photocatalytic experiment.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples prepared from 1173 to 1473 K were detected by XRD measurement, as shown in Fig. 1. The sample prepared at higher temperature showed a higher intensity and narrower diffraction peaks, indicating the improvement of the crystallinity. For the sample prepared at 1173 K, the XRD diffraction patterns of BaCO3 could be found, which should be attributed to the relatively low calcination temperature in the synthesis process. According to the XRD patterns, the lattice parameter of BaZrO3 prepared at 1273 K could be calculated as 4.18 Å, which is consistent with other reports.30 Pure BaZrO3 could also be obtained via the solid state reaction at relatively high temperature about 1873 K.31

The UV-vis and BET surface data have been acquired. The specific surface area of BaZrO3 obtained at 1273 K was 2.30 m2 g−1. And the absorption edge of BaZrO3 is located at about 260 nm, which indicates that BaZrO3 is a wide-band gap semiconductor. The band gap of BaZrO3 is estimated to be 4.8 eV, which is obtained by processing the UV-vis spectra data of BaZrO3 using the Kubelka–Munk method. The calculated band gap of BaZrO3 has been reported to be 3.2 eV,26 which is less than the experimental value, due to one electron approximation.
Just as depicted in Fig. 2, no hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank experiments. The three blank reactions illustrated that both the photocatalyst and the light irradiation were indispensable for the CO2 photoreduction process. Fig. 2 also depicts the amount of CH4 produced from the above photocatalytic system containing different photocatalysts prepared at different temperatures under UV-light irradiation for 8 h. It could be found that the BaZrO3 samples prepared at different temperatures show similar photoreduction activity. All the BaZrO3 samples showed relatively low photocatalytic activity, which should be ascribed to the low BET surface and the low efficiency of the electron–hole separation. The experimental results also showed that CH4 was the primary product in the gaseous photocatalytic CO2 reduction system using BaZrO3 as the photocatalyst. The selective formation of CH4 rather than other hydrocarbons (such as CH3OH and CO) might be attributed to the redox potential of CH4/CO2 [E0 (CH4/CO2) = −0.24 V versus NHE, pH = 7.00] which is much lower than that of CO/CO2 [E0 (CO/CO2) = −0.53 V versus NHE, pH = 7.00] or CH3OH/CO2 [E0 (CH3OH/CO2) = −0.38 V versus NHE, pH = 7.00].32,33
 Fig. 2  The products were detected in three blank reactions and the CH4 yield of pure BaZrO3 prepared at different temperatures (1273, 1373 and 1473 K). 
To confirm the effect of the cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activities, various noble metal particles were deposited on the surface of BaZrO3 prepared at 1273 K. Au, Pt, and Ag nanoparticles were obtained by the liquid chemical reduction method, while the Cu and Ru particles were prepared by an impregnation method. The CH4 evolution rates over the BaZrO3 samples with different cocatalysts deposited (BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Pt, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ag, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Cu, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Au, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ru) under illumination for 6 hours are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  CH4 yields of BaZrO3 deposited with different cocatalysts (Ru, Cu, Au, Pt, Ag) having the same apparent amount. 
According to the results shown in Fig. 3, three samples (BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Pt, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ag, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Au) exhibited higher photoactivity than the pure BaZrO3 (1273 K) shown in Fig. 2, whereas the other two samples (BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Cu, BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ru) showed a much lower photoactivity than the pure BaZrO3. The sample BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ag exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency. The coverage and adsorption of CO2 may be more feasible to carry out on the surface of BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ag, which would result in a better photoreduction activity in contrast to the other samples. To find the optimal deposition amount of Ag nanoparticles, BaZrO3 samples with various weight ratios of Ag (0.5 wt%, 0.3 wt%, 0.1 wt%) deposited were chosen for further investigation, and the results are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  CH4 yields of BaZrO3 with different amounts of Ag deposition. 
The Ag deposition can increase the methane yield owing to the increasing amount of active sites. As shown in Fig. 4, BaZrO3–0.3 wt% Ag showed higher photoactivity than BaZrO3–0.1 wt% Ag. The BaZrO3–0.5 wt% Ag sample exhibited relatively lower photoactivity than BaZrO3–0.3 wt% Ag, which should be attributed to the excess Ag deposition that covered the surface of BaZrO3 and hampered the light absorption, depressing the photogenerated e−–h+ separation efficiency.
The BaZrO3 powder with 0.3 wt% Ag deposited was investigated by SEM, TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 5). The Ag nanoparticles could be found from the SEM microphotograph, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The TEM image in Fig. 5(b) clearly displayed that the silver nanoparticles aggregate on the BaZrO3 surface with an average size of about 5 nm, which agreed with the report before.19 The enlarged high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the selected area (Fig. 5(c)) exhibited well-defined lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.29 nm corresponding to the (110) plane of BaZrO3. The adjacent lattice fringes also have a lattice spacing of 0.24 nm which coincided with the (111) plane of silver. The continuity of lattice fringes between BaZrO3 and Ag verified the formation of a Schottky barrier between them. Under the observed projections, other particles with diameters of about 15 nm were found on the edge of BaZrO3 particles. Since their sizes were much smaller than that of BaZrO3, it may be attributed to the excessive aggregation of the silver particles. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM images proved that silver nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of the BaZrO3 uniformly. These silver nanoparticles changed at the beginning stage of the photocatalytic reduction which results in the increase of the photocatalytic activities.19

Under UV light irradiation, the electrons in the valence band (VB) are excited by the photon to the conduction band (CB). The CO2 or intermediate molecules adsorbed on the surface of BaZrO3 could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons. Due to the large band gap of BaZrO3, the utilization of irradiation light is limited, which may lead to relatively low photocatalytic activity. However, the deposition of silver on the surface of BaZrO3 enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency. In the case of silver deposited BaZrO3, the photogenerated electrons are trapped by silver nanoparticles under UV light, which leads to a better interfacial charge transfer and a sharp decrease in the recombination rate. This is attributed to its EF level which is lower than the CB of BaZrO3.34 When this semiconductor–metal composite is exposed to UV light, the photogenerated electrons in BaZrO3 transfer to silver nanoparticles and this continues until they attain equilibrium, which shifts the Fermi level of the semiconductor–metal composite upward and increases the negative potential of silver.34,35 This negative shift in EF leads to better charge separation and more reductive power for the catalyst system. At the interface of silver and BaZrO3, a Schottky barrier is formed, which would promote the separation of the charge carriers through accumulating electrons in silver and remaining holes in BaZrO3.3,36–39
4. Conclusions
The photocatalytic properties of BaZrO3 as a new photocatalyst for CO2 reduction have been investigated. The BaZrO3 samples obtained at 1273 K with 0.3 wt% Ag nanoparticles deposited showed the highest photocatalytic activities. Under UV light irradiation, the Ag nanoparticle deposited BaZrO3 showed higher photocatalytic activities than the samples with other metal nanoparticles deposited. The deposition of Ag nanoparticles on BaZrO3 results in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and the electron transmission mechanism should be further investigated in detail to enhance the photocatalytic activity of BaZrO3.
