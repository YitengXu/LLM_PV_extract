    , Accepted 7th September 2015First published on 7th September 2015AbstractAmong different metal chalcogenides, copper sulfides have been extensively studied in the past few years due to their semiconducting and non-toxic nature, making them useful in a wide range of applications from the energy to the biomedical fields. A series of stoichiometric compositions of copper sulfides from Cu-rich, Cu2S to Cu-deficient, CuS2 exist with different crystal structures as well as phases, resulting in different unique properties. The suitable band gap values in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV and unique optoelectronic properties indicate that the material is photocatalytically active and exhibits excellent plasmonic behavior. The material is also known for promising thermoelectric properties, converting waste heat into electricity through the Seebeck effect. The nanodimensional form of copper sulfides promotes their use to a more advanced level, tuning their properties with the size of the materials. In view of this, the present review article is focused on the compositions, phases and crystal structures, and different synthetic methodologies involved in the fabrication of 0D, 1D and 2D nanostructured copper sulfides. Moreover, recent advancements on their use in various applications will also be briefly discussed.

1. Introduction
Copper sulfide is known to be a very important p-type semiconductor due to its versatility, availability and low-toxicity nature. It exists in different phases ranging from copper-rich (Cu2S) to sulfur-rich (CuS), which exhibit a wide variation in their direct/indirect band gaps.1,2 Further, plasmonic absorption is observed near the IR region in non-stoichiometric copper sulfide due to the generation of free charge carriers.1,3–7 The electrical conductivity of copper sulfide relies very much on its composition and decreases from copper-poor to copper-rich compositions.8,9 The naturally occurring covellite phase of CuS shows extraordinary superconductivity at 1.63 K.10 Owing to the wide variation in their optical as well as electrical properties, copper sulfides find promising applications in the field of optoelectronic devices,11,12 photocatalysis,13,14 photovoltaic cells,4,15,16 sensors,16 battery electrodes17,18 and in biomedical19–21 fields. Recent investigations have shown that size reduction of CuS into nanoscale dimensions further causes a significant alteration in their physical and chemical properties due to the quantum confinement effect.1,22,23 Therefore, considerable attention has been focused on the fabrication of nanostructured copper sulfides with different sizes, shapes and morphologies. A variety of physical24 as well as chemical25,26 methods have also been employed in fabricating different nanodimensional 0D, 1D and 2D copper sulfides. The manipulation of their properties based on the requirement was achieved with a controlled growth process, attaining different shapes of nanostructured copper sulfides such as nanoparticles,21,27,28 nanoplates,29–31 hollow spheres,11,25 nanorods,32–35 nanowires,18,36,37 nanotubes,38 nanosheets13etc. In this regard, 0D nanocrystals (quantum dots, nanoparticles) with high surface area and active surface plasmon resonance are found to be very useful in optoelectronics and bioapplications.7 On the other hand, anisotropic structures of CuS are more suitable in electronic devices with directional electronic transportation and structural integrity.18,39 Further manipulation of their properties can be attempted by fabricating copper sulfide-based hybrid nanostructures in combination with other materials, exhibiting manifold enhanced activity in many energy applications.5,40–43
Although a large number of review articles/books on nanostructured metal chalcogenides regularly appeared,22,23,44–47 contemporary work on copper sulfides is still not surveyed in spite of their versatility in composition, phase, size, shape, and morphology. In view of this, the present review article is focused on the formation of different phases of nanodimensional copper sulfides in terms of their crystal structure and synthetic methods. Further, tunable optical, electrical, and thermal properties of copper sulfides depending upon their size and shape have been reviewed followed by their applications in multifaceted fields. Finally, smart approaches combining copper sulfides in developing hybrid nanostructures/nanoheterostructures and their effective application in the energy as well as biomedical fields have also been compiled.
2. Compositions, phases and crystal structures of copper sulfide
Copper sulfides exist in different phases ranging from copper-rich (Cu2S) to sulfur-rich (CuS). To date eight different forms of copper sulfide have been identified – chalcocite (Cu2S), djurleite (Cu1.97S), digenite (Cu1.80S), anilite (Cu1.75S), geerite (Cu1.60S), spionkopite (Cu1.40S), yarrowite (Cu1.12S), and covellite (Cu1.00S) and often represented as Cu2−xS with very small x values.48,49 Depending on the packing of sulfur in the lattice, the crystal structure of these forms has been divided into three groups, namely cubic close packing (anilite and digenite), hexagonal close packing (djurleite and chalcocite) and a combination of hexagonal close packing and covalent bonding of the sulfur atoms (covelline).48 However, the crystal structures of yarrowite, spionkopite and geerite are still not determined. Furthermore, a phase transition on changing temperature has also been observed, e.g. chalcocite Cu2S exhibits a monoclinic phase (low chalcocite) at a temperature below 104 °C, which changes to hexagonal phase (high chalcocite) between 104 and 436 °C and transforms further to cubic phase (cubic chalcocite) above 436 °C.50,51 All the phases follow different synthesis methods and properties, making them extremely useful in most specific applications. Wei and his coworkers50 calculated the heat of formation (ΔH) and noted anilite (Cu1.75S) as one of the most stable forms of copper sulfide. Fig. 1 shows the crystal structures of some selective forms of copper sulfides. All these forms of copper sulfides are p-type semiconductors due to the presence of Cu vacancies in the lattice. The band gap values of copper sulfides vary with stoichiometry in Cu2−xS and increases with copper deficiency ‘x’, as evident from band gap values in Cu2S (1.1–1.4 eV), Cu1.8S (1.5 eV) and CuS (~2.0 eV).1,4 Therefore, compositional control of copper sulfides is the effective way to tune their optoelectronic properties as per the requirement (see detailed discussion in section 4.1).

Several investigations are reported on stoichiometric Cu2−xS nanocrystals for possible phase transition.1,7,32,49,51,52 Cassaignon and his coworkers53 investigated the influence of composition on copper diffusion in copper sulfide (Cu2−xS) with the help of impedance spectroscopy. The study was carried out at the Cu2−xS/electrolyte interface in a galvanic cell (Cu|Cu2+|Cu2−xS) at different potentials and composition modification was observed at the interface. Such a change in composition was attributed to the Cu diffusion through the vacancies in the lattice on imposing the different potentials. Xie et al.49 synthesized a series of copper sulfide nanocrystals by solution-based method with the composition varying from Cu1.1S to Cu2S by incorporating Cu(I) in the lattice of starting material Cu1.1S and investigated its optical properties. Burda and his group1 successfully synthesized Cu2−xS nanocrystals of compositions ranging from CuS (covellite) to Cu1.97S (djurleite) by varying the reduction potential in the sonoelectrochemical method, adjusting the pH value in the hydrothermal method and choosing different precursor pretreatments in the solventless thermolysis approach. Further, copper deficiency in the Cu2−xS nanocrystals exhibited localized surface plasmon resonance and effective plasmonic behavior in the near-IR region.4,7 Such special properties enable these materials to be used in various photoelectrochemical and energy applications, which will be discussed later.
3. Synthetic strategies of nanostructured copper sulfides
A variety of synthetic strategies have been employed to prepare nanodimensional copper sulfides of different compositions and phases (Table 1). According to the available literature, the composition of copper sulfides could be controlled by changing the molar ratios of the Cu and S precursors during the synthesis process. In addition, control over the morphology, shape, or size of the nanostructured copper sulfides with tunable properties is executed by changing the reaction parameters. In this section, we will discuss different methodologies and the mechanisms involved in fabricating nanodimensional copper sulfides of various morphologies (Fig. 2 and 3).

3.1 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method
Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods remain even till now as one of the most commonly used methods in synthesizing nanomaterials. The technique enables increasing the solubility of reactants in the solvent and speeding up the chemical reaction, attaining quick supersaturation under high temperature and pressure. Accordingly, the synthesis of copper sulfides was successfully achieved in the form of nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires or nanotubes by this approach.31,54–61 The application of stabilizing/capping agents has also been extensively employed in order to stabilize the narrow size distribution in 0D and specific high-energy surfaces in 1D and 2D nanostructures of copper sulfide. Du et al.31 synthesized single-crystalline, hexagonal covellite (CuS) nanoplatelets (dia: 26 nm, thickness: 8 nm) by solvothermal method in the presence of hexadecylamine and toluene as capping agent and solvent, respectively. These nanoplatelets exhibit a tendency to self-assemble into pillar-like, raft-like and stratiform nanostructures. Although the size of the nanoplatelets could be tuned by varying the reaction temperature, self-assembled stacking was mostly controlled by the capping agent and van der Waals attraction.31 An interesting approach was attempted by Zhuang et al.62 on bottom-up self-assemblies of Cu2S nanocrystals into a superlattice at the water–oil interface in an autoclave. In this case, dodecanethiol was used as the oil phase as well as the capping agent. It is believed that the size and shape of nanocrystals can be engineered by changing the concentration of Cu2+ and dodecanethiol, whereas the self-assembly of nanocrystals can be controlled by adjusting the dipole–dipole and van der Waals interactions. In addition, polymers were also often used as a capping agent to prepare copper sulfide superstructures under hydrothermal conditions.13,14,20,58,63,64 Zhang et al.63 synthesized CuS nanotubes by solvothermal process in a microemulsion system consisting of oleic acid, water and poly(vinylpyrrolidone). Jia and his coworkers54 reported the facile synthesis of hexagonal bifrustum-shaped copper sulfide (CuS) nanocrystals via hydrothermal method assisted by tetradecylamine. Different non-stoichiometric compositions of copper sulfides, CuS (particle), mixture of Cu7S4–CuS (hexagonal plate) and Cu9S5 (octahedron nanocrystals), were fabricated by solvothermal method simply by varying the ratios of Cu and S precursors.55 The formation of such different morphologies of copper sulfides was attributed to the oriented-attachment mechanism of copper sulfides. Zhang et al.56 synthesized CuS nanocrystals of spherical nanoflowers, doughnut-shaped nanospheres, and dense nanosphere shapes via solvothermal method. Interestingly, different morphologies were obtained under the same reaction conditions but changing the S precursors, Na2S, Na2S2O3 or CS(NH2)2, led to the formation of different Cu complexes, [Cu(S2O3)(H2O)2], [Cu(S2O3)2]2− or [Cu{CS(NH2)2}n]Cl, and accounted for the formation of their variable morphology. Different nanostructures of CuS were prepared by varying the ratio of water:ethylene glycol as solvent, precursor ratios, reaction temperature and duration under hydrothermal treatment in the temperature range 150–250 °C.59 Further, addition of CTAB as surfactant reduced agglomeration to form well-dispersed nanocrystals. The complex formation phenomena with Cu(II) and S precursors or use of a single source precursor and their decomposition during the hydrothermal or solvothermal method plays a very important role for the growth of nanocrystals leading to various morphologies of copper sulfides.30,56,57,59–61 Lou and his coworkers30 synthesized high-quality, uniform copper sulfides (CuS and Cu9S5) in the form of faceted nanocrystals and triangular nanoplates by the decomposition of copper dialkyldithiophosphates via solvothermal method. The size of such nanocrystals were adjusted from 8 to 16 nm by varying the carbon number of the substitute alkyl and the reaction temperature in the presence of oleylamine as a stabilizing agent. Our group subjected the Cu dithiooxamide complex as a single source precursor to heating in an autoclave at 120 °C.61 It was noted that several μm long CuS nanowires with 70 nm diameter were obtained under hydrothermal condition, whereas the use of ethylenediamine or toluene instead of water leads to the formation of CuS nanoparticles only. In another attempt, our group studied the growth of flower-like morphology of copper sulfides from nanorods with different compositions by solvothermal method using ethylenediamine as solvent.65 Furthermore, various morphologies as well as stoichiometries have also been fabricated by using different chelating and nonchelating solvents in the solvothermal method as reported elsewhere.66 Zhao and his coworkers26 carried out organic amine-assisted hydrothermal method to assemble digenite phase copper sulfide nanoparticles into various shapes – nanowires, nanotubes, and nanovesicles – using triethylenediamine, tramethylethylenediamine, and di-n-butylamine, respectively, as linking agent at low temperature range (90–110 °C).
A number of attempts have also been made in fabricating nanocomposites of copper sulfide and carbon nanotubes by hydrothermal method.16,67–70 These nanocomposites exhibit very promising properties in the field of solar cells and sensors. Park and his coworkers16 fabricated Cu2S nanocrystals anchored on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via solvothermal process using oleylamine as solvent. They also manipulated the size of Cu2S nanocrystals by simply changing the molar ratio of Cu and S precursors. A similar work has also been reported on CuS nanoparticles on MWCNTs via hydrothermal process.70 Copper sulfide-core/carbon-sheath cables were prepared via hydrothermal method in the presence of β-cyclodextrin acting as both ligand and carbon source of the sheath.67 Another interesting strategy in fabricating ultrafine CuS nanoneedle arrays on a CNT backbone involved the combination of template-engaged conversion route followed by hydrothermal treatment.68 In this approach, silica-coated CNTs (CNT@SiO2) were first introduced as the substrate for the growth of copper silicate (CuSilicate) nanoneedles to form 1D CNT@SiO2@CuSilicate core–shell. Subsequent hydrothermal treatment converted it into CuS nanoneedles@CNT accompanied by selective etching of SiO2 by OH− ions.
3.2 Hot-injection method
Other than hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, one-pot hot-injection method is another frequently used technique to synthesize monodisperse, high-quality copper sulfide nanocrystals from the mixture of organic solvents and appropriate surfactants in a standard Schlenk set-up.7,49,71,72 The mechanism relies on the sudden addition of cold reactants (room temperature) into hot solvent leading to a sudden burst of nucleation and subsequent growth of nuclei in the presence of surfactant under optimum reaction conditions.73 Since Bawendi and his group74 developed this method for monodisperse Cd chalcogenides, it has been further extended to other metal chalcogenides including copper sulfides.
Xie and his coworkers71 successfully synthesized covellite CuS nanodisks by this approach. According to this, fast addition of S (sulfur)/OLAM (oleylamine) solution to the preheated (180 °C) mixture of CuCl/OLAM/OLAC/ODE (copper chloride/oleylamine/oleic acid/1-octadecene) followed by a short annealing period resulting in the formation of monodisperse hexagonal-shaped CuS nanocrystals. Depending upon the binary OLAC/OLAM surfactant ratio, the size of the nanocrystals varied from 10 to 28 nm. Non-stoichiometric Cu1.8S nanocrystals (6–20 nm) were also prepared by the same technique as reported by Liu et al.7 An in situ phase transformation from rhombohedral Cu1.8S nanocrystal to hexagonal CuS clusters was observed due to OLAM-assisted oxidation process by keeping the colloidal solution for a few days. Ghezelbash and Korgel75 synthesized hexagonal CuS (covellite)/rhombohedral Cu1.8S (digenite) nanocrystals (dia: 10–15 nm) in a dichlorobenzene-solvated medium by varying OLAC/OLAM molar ratios. The combination of 1-dodecanethiol and oleic acid as solvent and their variable ratios at the reaction temperature range 200–220 °C often produced non-stoichiometric monodisperse Cu2−xS nanoparticles (dia: 2–10 nm).15,72,76 The formation of such non-stoichiometric Cu2−xS nanoparticles lies upon the reducing ability of dodecanethiol versus oleic acid and the growth of particles often accelerated to an unusual faceted shape in the presence of oleic acid.76 Kruszynska et al.32 observed that reaction temperature plays a very important role in determining the size and shape of copper sulfide nanocrystals. Accordingly, they successfully prepared Cu2−xS nanocrystals to nanorods with adjustable length by careful choice of S precursors (1-dodecanethiol/tert-dodecanethiol or t-DDT) followed by adjusting the nucleation temperature and copper monomer concentration. It is noted that t-DDT at high temperature promotes the reactivity of (100) surfaces of djurleite particles and favors the one-dimensional growth into CuS nanorods. Nørby and his coworkers51 reported the formation, growth, and phase transition of colloidal Cu2−xS nanocrystals in the presence of DDT as a reducing agent as well as a size and shape controller. It is also observed that the particle size of Cu2−xS nanocrystals decreases with increasing DDT concentration.52 However, contradicting findings are also reported on increasing the size of Cu2S nanocrystals with DDT content, temperature, and reaction time.77 The nanocrystal of β-Cu2S (hexagonal) with narrow size distribution (2–10 nm) has been prepared in a medium containing a 1:2:1 molar ratio of [Cu+]/[TGA] (thioglycolic acid)/[TAA] (thioacetamide).78 It is believed that TGA stabilizes the nanoparticles as the absence of TGA results in the self-assembly of nanoparticles to nanoribbons through the epitaxial matching of the particle surfaces.
The technique has also been extensively used in fabricating controlled shape and size nanoheterostructures of copper sulfides. Gao and his coworkers42,79 prepared Cu1.94S–MxSy (M = In, Zn) heterostructured nanorods by multi-step injection of M(acac)y–dodecanethiol stock solutions into a hot Cu(acac)2–dodecanethiol reaction system. In either case, nanoheterostructures of Cu1.94S–In2S3 (ref. 79) and Cu1.94S–ZnS (ref. 42) were achieved by the epitaxial growth of In2S3 and ZnS on Cu1.94S and seeds were controlled by injection time as well as molar ratio of In(acac)3:Cu(acac)2 or Zn(acac)2:Cu(acac)2, respectively. Such seed-mediated growth results in a matchstick-like morphology with Cu1.94S acting as head and In2S3 and ZnS acting as tails. Further, a series of nanocrystals of Cu2S–metal chalcogenides, including Cu2S–ZnS, Cu2S–CuInS, and Cu2S–CuInZnS in the form of nanocrystals to nanorods, were also prepared in octadecene-mediated medium containing DDT as capping agent.41 In another two-step strategy, dimeric Cu1.94S–ZnS nanoheterostructures were fabricated by dispersing Cu1.94S nanocrystals in OLAM under hot condition followed by injecting Zn oleate and dodecanethiol into this mixture.80 The proposed mechanism involved the ion exchange reaction of Zn with Cu ions in Cu1.94S nanospheres, embedding the ZnS crystal into the nanosphere followed by the directional growth of ZnS nanoslab on the embedded ZnS crystals. Further, complex structures of different Cu1.94S–ZnS, Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S, and Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S nanoheterostructures with screw, dumbbell, and sandwich-like shapes were also fabricated by the one-pot colloidal route by varying the molar ratios of Cu and Zn precursors in oleylamine.43
3.3 Thermolysis
This method involved the formation of copper sulfide nanostructures by thermal decomposition of Cu–S complex as single source precursor. The hot-injection method, as discussed earlier, could also be considered as the effective solvent-mediated thermolysis of Cu–S complex in the presence of a capping agent. However, a number of solventless thermolysis processes also produced different nanostructured copper sulfides. Korgel and his group33,81 fabricated Cu2S nanocrystals from copper alkylthiolate single source precursor by solventless thermolysis at the temperature range 140–200 °C. They used sodium octanoate as a capping agent during the preparation of thiolate precursor in organic medium to control the anisotropic growth of Cu2S nanocrystals of different shapes, e.g. nanorods, nanodisks and nanoplatelets or their assemblies, to form multilayer superlattices. Such oriented growth of Cu2S depends on the differences in surface energy of (001) and (100), (110) facets. Chen et al.82 prepared Cu2S nanowires of high aspect ratio by the thermolysis of Cu thiolate polymer precursor. It is also inferred that the aspect ratio of Cu2S nanowires could be modified by alteration of the polymeric chain length of the precursor, controlling the viscosity of the colloidal precursor. Solvent-mediated thermal decomposition of Cu alkylthiophosphates at moderate reaction temperature range (120–200 °C) led to the formation of monodisperse CuS nanocrystals and triangular CuS nanoplates.30 A number of reports are also available on direct thermal decomposition of Cu–S complex precursors, e.g. Cu thiolate,83 Cu dithiooxamide61 or Cu alkyldithiocarbamate84 complexes. It is anticipated that the size and shape of such nanocrystals entirely depend upon the crystal structures of the single source precursors. The decomposition of complex precursors under microwave irradiation by thermolysis has also been carried out to synthesize copper sulfide nanocrystals, which is discussed in detail in section 3.4.
3.4 Microwave irradiation
Chemical synthesis under microwave irradiation in the frequency range 0.3 to 2.45 GHz remains comparatively one of the fastest strategies.87 Under this microwave frequency range, electromagnetic energy is converted into thermal energy, which induces a chemical reaction leading to the synthesis of nanostructured materials. This approach has successfully been employed for rapid decomposition of single source precursor into CuS nanotubes in the presence of diethanolamine as a solvent.85 The diameter of several micrometer long CuS nanotubes were further tuned in the range of 150–500 nm by altering the reaction temperature, choice of solvent and use of surfactant. In another report, non-stoichiometric copper sulfide (Cu9S8) nanorods were prepared by decomposition of a Cu–thioacetamide complex in sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous solution under microwave irradiation.34 Thongtem et al.88 prepared CuS nanotubes in the absence of any surfactant following the decomposition of a Cu–thioacetamide complex by microwave-assisted solvothermal method. In addition, various hierarchical nanostructures of CuS were also prepared by simple mixing of Cu and S precursors in the presence of EDTA as complexing agent or additives or surfactants under microwave irradiation.89–91 The formation of stable Cu-EDTA complex is compared to the weak interaction among Cu2+ and surfactants, leading to the formation of 3D flower-like morphology of CuS with oriented arrangement, which further undergoes 1D chain-like growth via self-assembly.89
3.5 Electrodeposition
Electrochemical deposition or anodization is another simple, low-cost and high-throughput technique to fabricate copper sulfide nanostructures onto the substrate directly. Like many other metal oxides, copper sulfide nanostructures are also grown on Cu substrates or Cu foil acting as anode and Ti metal as cathode in the voltage range of 1.5–8 V in Na2S aqueous solution.86 Accordingly, Cu2S and CuS nanorod and nanowall arrays were achieved by manipulating the voltage as well as the reaction temperature. Xu and his co-workers92 successfully fabricated hierarchical CuS nanostructures by electrochemical deposition onto conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate at −1.05 V in a DMSO-based electrolyte containing Cu salt and S powder and NaNO3 as supporting electrolyte at 80 °C. Further, CuS nanorods and nanowires were also deposited onto a conductive stainless-steel substrate by a similar technique at room temperature.93,94 It is also noted that the diameter of nanowires could vary between 40 and 600 nm and their lengths up to 300 μm depending on the deposition duration.94 Although the chemical method is very simple and efficient, very limited work has been reported to date on the fabrication of copper sulfide nanostructures.
3.6 Others
In addition to the above conventional methods, a number of strategies have also been utilized for fabrication of different copper sulfide nanostructures. In situ source–template–interface reaction (ISTIR) route is a simple wet chemical method to fabricate different nanostructures (nanoparticles and nanorods) of CuS in a controlled way.95 The reaction mechanism lies at the interface of a water–oil microemulsion solution, where CS2 acts as a sulfur source as well as the oil phase and ethylenediamine is used as a complexing agent to control the release of free Cu2+ ions. The growth of nanostructures was simply controlled by changing the reaction temperature. Interestingly twinned structure was observed in the CuS nanorods at low reaction temperature due to insertion of stacking fault during the slow reaction process. A most commonly accepted approach in the preparation of copper sulfide nanotubes involved copper–thiourea complex [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O nanowire precursor as self-sacrificial template.96–98 The complex itself acts as a single source precursor for both Cu and S and the crystallization of CuS starts at the surface by the decomposition of thiourea. The subsequent dissolution of the complex towards the interior results in the formation of porous CuS nanotubes. A similar approach has also been attempted by using Cu nanowires99,100 or its different complexes, such as Cu thioacetamide, Cu(OH)2 (ref. 101 and 102) or CuSn(OH)6 (ref. 103), in the form of nanorods or nanowires as self-sacrificial template.
Syntheses of nanostructured hybrid materials of copper sulfide with carbonaceous materials (SWCNT, MWCNT etc.) have also been reported due to their potential applications. In most cases, these hybrid materials were prepared hydrothermally or solvothermally16 (see section 3.1) by mixing acid-treated CNTs with Cu and S precursors. The successful anchoring of CuS nanoparticles onto the SWCNT surface was also carried out via functionalizing the SWCNT surface by oleylamine in a toluene-based reaction medium.104,105
4. Properties of nanostructured copper sulfides
4.1 Optical properties
Owing to a variety of compositions, copper sulfide nanocrystals are considered to be promising materials for their application in optoelectronic devices. Earlier, Cu2−xS was considered to be both a direct and an indirect band gap semiconductor due to the appearance of absorption peaks in UV-Vis and NIR spectroscopy.4,7,32,106,107 Later on, Lukashev et al.2 suggested the non-existence of an indirect band gap in Cu2−xS as per their theoretical calculations irrespective of its different phases, differing from previous reports. In support of the calculations by Lukashev et al.,2 Burda and his co-workers1 ruled out the existence of an indirect band gap and stated that the direct band gap of Cu2−xS is a function of x due to the Moss–Burstein effect108,109 caused by copper deficiency. When x values increase, hole formation near the valence band leads to the shifting of energy of the lowest occupied energy level and altering of the band gap value of Cu2−xS.110 The nanocrystal size-dependent band gap values have also been well studied by several research groups.71,83,110 As expected, Cu2−xS exhibits a strong quantum confinement effect for its size of <10 nm, showing a blue shift in the absorption spectra compared to bulk structures.1,3 Further, a size-dependent shift in the UV-Vis spectra of Cu2−xS nanocrystals is found to be more prominent than the compositional dependence due to the Moss–Burstein effect.108,109 Based on findings reported by several groups, Fig. 4(a–c) shows the band gap dependence of copper sulfides with composition, size and shape of nanocrystals. Alivisatos and his coworkers110 observed a clear blue shift from 1.3 to 1.6 eV in the UV-Vis absorption spectra as the size of Cu2−xS nanocrystals decreases from 5.9 to 2.9 nm. In another report, comparatively larger nanodisks of Cu2S with a diameter of 21.7 and 26.0 nm synthesized by thermolysis of a single source precursor showed a blue shift in their UV-Vis absorption spectra.83

(d) NIR spectra of Cu2−xS NCs with different compositions synthesized by the sonoelectrochemical method. Reprinted with permission from ref. 1. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. 
In addition to the absorption band in the UV-Vis range, a broad band in the NIR region is also observed in Cu2−xS nanocrystals. Although earlier it was misinterpreted as the indirect band nature, later it was confirmed that such band in NIR is due to the plasmonic behavior of Cu2−xS resulting from free carriers, mostly free holes created due to the Cu deficiency.1,4 Like metals with high electron density, copper sulfides of different compositions except perfect Cu2S exhibit such plasmonic resonance behavior.4Fig. 4(d) shows plasmonic NIR spectra of Cu2−xS nanocrystals at different compositions as reported by Alivisatos et al.1 The intensity of plasmonic bands can be derived from the Drude model and the Mie theory as follows:1,4    where ωp is the plasmon frequency, N is the free carrier concentration, ε is the dielectric constant, kext(λ) is the extinction coefficient, m* is the charge carrier effective mass and τ is the average relaxation time. These relationships suggest that plasmon frequency ωp increases with free carrier concentration (N1/2) and extinction coefficient kext(λ) at wavelength λ and also is a function of the dielectric constant of the material. An interesting approach to control the localized surface plasmonic resonance frequency of Cu1.94S was successfully attempted by fabricating dimeric nanoheterostructures with ZnS.111 The strategy was designed with Cu1.94S as the plasmonic resonance source, while ZnS acted as the tunable dielectric component. Such nanoheterostructures exhibited a controllable localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) peak in the range of 1390–680 nm, enabling their potential applications in telecommunication.
4.2 Electrical and thermoelectric properties
Due to the presence of cationic vacancies in the lattice structure, copper sulfides, Cu2−xS, are considered as p-type semiconductors. The close packing, specifically in Cu2S and Cu1.94S with short Cu–Cu distance like metallic Cu–Cu bonding as well as short Cu–S distance, accounts for their high electrical conductivity.112 Such a situation converts the material into one with a semimetallic character when the critical temperature of 1.6 K is attained.113 Owing to their high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity, copper sulfides are potentially used as excellent thermoelectric materials. However, very limited work has been done on analyzing the electrical properties of copper sulfides particularly in nanodimensional form. According to the earlier literature, highly dense Cu2−xS bulks show high thermoelectric performance with a figure of merit (zT) value of 1.9 at 970 K.114 Li et al.115 prepared KCu7−xS4 nanowires by introducing K+ into Cu7S4 lattice without compromising electrical conductivity. They found that KCu7−xS4 nanowires exhibit efficient thermoelectric property due to the increased Cu deficiency in the lattice and generation of numerous grain boundaries in comparison to the pristine Cu7S4 nanostructure. However, plenty of scope exists to investigate the thermoelectric property of different phases of copper sulfides.
5. Applications of nanostructured copper sulfides
5.1 Photocatalysis
Considering the strong absorption in the visible range and stability over a wide range of pH, copper sulfide nanostructures are extensively used in photocatalytic decomposition of various organic pollutants.4,116–119 This versatility makes copper sulfide nanostructures suitable as replacement to most widely used TiO2 photocatalysts due to their limited absorption in the UV range.56 Therefore, the photocatalytic activity performance of different nanostructures of copper sulfides in the presence of different dyes, e.g. methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) etc. has been extensively investigated.55,56,117,120,121Fig. 5a describes the mechanism of dye degradation taking place on the surface of copper sulfide nanostructure. Like other semiconducting photocatalysts, copper sulfide nanostructure absorbs visible light and generates an e−–h+ pair in the conduction and valence bands followed by successful charge transfer to the surface of the nanostructure to react with oxidants and reductants, respectively. Eqn (1)–(6) describe a series of chemical reactions taking place between copper sulfide with oxidants and reductants.56 Subsequently, the superoxide ions (˙O2−) and ·OH radicals decompose the organic pollutants. CuS + hν → h+(CuS) + e−(CuS)(1) H2O → H+ + OH−(2) e−(CuS) + O2 → ˙O2−(3) e−(CuS) + H2O2 → ˙OH + OH−(4) h+(CuS) + OH− → ˙OH(5) Organic pollutant + ˙OH + ˙O2− → degradation products(6) Fig. 5  (a) Schematic representation of the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants on the surface of copper sulfide nanocrystals.

(d) Comparison between pristine Cu2S and Au–Cu2S nanocrystals on photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. Reprinted with permission from ref. 124. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society. Zhang et al.56 investigated the photocatalytic performance of various CuS nanostructures (nanoflowers, doughnut-shaped nanospheres, dense nanospheres, mixtures of nanoneedles, nanoparticles, and nanoplates) with their band gaps lying in the range of 1.61–2.01 eV in RhB. Monodisperse CuS microflowers also exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of MB.117 Srivastava and coworker121 observed that CuS nanoparticles degrade MB to ~90% in 90 min and also exhibited excellent reusability. Geng and his coworkers14 fabricated various controlled architectural ball-flower-shaped CuS structures and observed better photocatalytic performance of CuS structures compared to Degussa P25 powders in UV light due to their high surface area. Hierarchical CuS flowers assembled by pure CuS nanosheets (thickness: 20 nm) are also found to be very promising photocatalysts with excellent recyclability in the photodegradation of MB, RhB or both in the presence of H2O2 under light irradiation.120 It is noted that the presence of H2O2 and visible light are most effective in the fast degradation of dyes due to their synergistic effect as shown in Fig. 5(b).55 A very fast degradation rate of RhB reaching 98% degradation in 15 min was observed for the mixture of CuS and Cu7S4 with flake-like nanostructures compared to pure CuS and Cu9S5.55 On a different note, there are few reports on CuS nanostructures exhibiting catalytic activity in the presence of H2O2 and interestingly in the absence of light.59,122,123 The degradation of dyes in the dark is attributed to the formation of ·OH radicals in the chemical reaction between CuS and H2O2 as described below:122,123 Cu2+ + H2O2 → H+ + CuOOH+(7) CuOOH+ → HOO− + Cu+(8) Cu+ + H2O2 → Cu2+ + OH− + ˙OH(9) RH (organic dye) + ˙OH → R− + H2O(10)
Several attempts have also been made in designing nanoheterostructures to improvise the photocatalytic performance of copper sulfide nanostructures.122,124–128 Park and his group124 synthesized Au–Cu2S core–shell nanocrystals by solvothermal method and observed ~2.5 times enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light in MB as well as RhB degradation. Such hybrid nanostructures of copper sulfide showed enhanced performance due to their synergistic effects compared to the pristine component.
5.2 Solar cells
Copper sulfides attracted a lot of attention in solar cells due to their ability to act as the light-absorbing layer in solar cells.129 Although in the 1980s the CdS/Cu2S junction exhibited 10% efficiency in the solar cell,130,131 its scope in the solar cell is limited due to the diffusion of Cu+ ions in the CdS layer.131 Additionally, the poor electrical conductivity of Cu2−xS results in a high probability of e−–h+ recombination affecting the overall efficiency of solar cells.131 These drawbacks have been overcome by using single-crystalline copper sulfide nanocrystals15,132,133 or replacing the CdS layer by metal oxides, such as TiO2 (ref. 134) or ZnO.135 Alivisatos and his group15 fabricated photovoltaic devices composed of CdS/Cu2S junctions on a conventional glass as well as flexible plastic substrate, imparting a photoconversion efficiency of 1.6%. Bera et al.136 studied the current tunneling effect along with the density of states (DOS) spectra in individual nanorods designed as Cu2S/CdS (p-n) or Cu2S/CdS/Cu2S (p-n-p) heterojunctions to determine the band edges across the junction. It is also reported that Cu2S/CdS coaxial nanowires showed enhanced performance in photovoltaic devices due to the piezo-phototronics effect.132 Yang and his research group137 fabricated single-crystalline CdS/Cu2S core–shell nanowires as an effective p-n junction to separate the generated charge carriers and minimize their recombination. The single-crystalline nature of materials demonstrates the presence of very few interface defects to account for excellent VOC and FF and an efficiency of 5.4%. The application of hybrid CuS nanotubes–ITO Schottky junctions in photovoltaic devices exhibited an efficiency of 1.46%.99 Further, the use of nanocomposites of Cu2S with MWCNTs in photovoltaic devices has also been reported elsewhere.16 As an extended solar cell application, Cu2S has also been employed in the fabrication of quantum dot sensitized (QDSSC) or dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).138–141 It is a well-known fact that noble metals such as Pt, Au are widely accepted as counter electrodes in the TiO2-based QDSSCs and DSSCs. However, the chemisorption of electrolyte on metal catalysts causes high overpotential leading to low fill factor. Therefore, Cu2S has been effectively used as a counter electrode due to its higher electrocatalytic activity in reducing Sn2− to nS2− and decreasing charge transfer resistance as well as sheet resistance of the counter electrode.138 Jiang et al.138 designed a counter electrode composed of a coaxial nanowire array of ITO as the core and Cu2S as the sheath against CdS-sensitized TiO2 (Degussa) layer as the photoanode. Such an arrangement in a QDSSC leads to a stable efficiency of up to 4.06%.
5.3 Energy storage devices
Recently, nanostructured materials have been widely used in different energy storage devices, such as lithium ion rechargeable batteries (LIB), supercapacitors etc.142 In this regard, transition metal chalcogenides are widely accepted as cathode material due to their higher potential versus lithium.23 Based on the bonding between transition metals and chalcogens, the potential range of transition metal chalcogenides can be tuned between 0 and 3.5 V.143 Among various metal chalcogenides, copper sulfide nanostructures are considered to be efficient cathode materials in lithium ion rechargeable batteries due to their high lithium activity, high theoretical capacity, high abundance and low cost.18,144 The reactivity of the Li/CuS system can be represented as follows:144 2CuS + 2e− + 2Li+ ⇔ Cu2S + Li2S(11) Cu2S + 2e− + 2Li+ ⇔ 2Cu + Li2S(12)The reversibility of the reactions leads to good cyclability and high battery performance. 1D nanostructures have also drawn much attention due to directional electronic transportation, high surface area and accommodation of mechanical stress during the Li+ ion insertion and removal process.142 Lai et al.18 fabricated Cu2S nanowire arrays onto the conductive Cu substrate and used them as cathode material in LIB. The electrode showed good capacitive performance of 230 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 2C with great cyclic stability of up to 100 cycles along with a capacity retention value of 96%. Guery and his coworkers17 synthesized single-crystalline CuS thin films containing flake-like structure by electrodeposition technique in ionic liquid medium and examined their performance as positive electrode in LIB. Although the electrode initially showed a discharge capacity value of 350 mAh g−1, capacity fading occurred with capacity retention value of 54% up to 20 cycles. Among different nanostructures, the core–shell nanostructure exhibited better LIB performance as the inner hollow space accommodates the strain generated during the Li+ intercalation/deintercalaction process.145 Another interesting work involved fabrication of CuxS/Cu nanotubes by a two-step solvothermal process.146 It showed excellent Li storage ability, as the metallic Cu helped in enhancing electron transportation kinetics through the nanotube wall, leading to high specific capacities as well as high current densities (Fig. 6).

A few reports are also available on 1D nanostructured copper sulfide directly grown onto the conductive substrate to facilitate electronic transportation further through the nanostructure avoiding any loss of electrons to the current collector, leading to better performance as an electrode.68,142,147 Therefore, Hsu et al.147 fabricated CuS nanowire arrays on Cu foil, whereas Lou and coworkers68 designed ultrafine CuS nanoneedles supported on a CNT conductive backbone. Such hybrid nanocomposites exhibit a high capacitance value of 100 F g−1 with excellent cycling stability up to 1000 cycles.
5.4 Biomedical applications
A detailed discussion on the biomedical applications of nanostructured CuS has recently been reviewed by Goel et al.148 CuS has invariably been used for both in vitro and in vivo biological applications due to its non-toxic nature.148–150 For in vitro applications, CuS nanoparticles are extensively used as biosensors for DNA detection, food analysis, bioreactor monitoring etc. The detection of DNA is usually carried out by chemiluminescence assays based on the luminescence of enzymes or metal (Au, Ag etc.) attached to the DNA.148 However, due to the poor stability as well as low detection sensitivity of metals and enzymes, CuS in nanoscale form has been used as an alternative stable material for this purpose.149,150
In biomedical science, detection of glucose level is very important to diagnose many diseases, like diabetes. Although enzymatic biosensors were extensively used for this purpose, the recent advent of nanomaterials with high conductivity overshadowed the use of relatively less stable enzymes.148 In comparison to expensive noble metals, low-cost CuS nanomaterials mostly in the nanotubular form with metal-like conductivity were efficiently used as non-enzymatic biosensors.16,63,85,97 Further, enhanced glucose sensitivity can also be achieved by hybrid Cu2S–MWCNT material as reported elsewhere.16,151 Such enhanced activity has been attributed to the synergistic effect of the catalytic property of Cu2S and increased electrical conductivity due to the presence of MWCNT.
The optical activity of copper sulfide in the NIR region (typically in the range of 700–1065 nm) was also used in drug delivery systems by photothermal ablation technique for the treatment of tumors.20,152–154 Hollow copper sulfide nanoparticles exhibit intense photothermal coupling effects, allowing rapid heating and instantaneous heat conduction on absorbing nanosecond-pulsed NIR laser.152 The phenomena were effectively used as a transdermal delivery system and changing the power of the NIR laser can easily control the depth of skin penetration. Guo et al.153 carried out a comparative study on photothermal therapy of cancer by hollow CuS nanoparticles and hollow Au nanoparticles with comparable size of nanoparticles. They injected the surface-modified nanoparticles (hollow CuS and hollow Au) by polyethylene glycol in a comparative dose and found effective photothermal therapy of CuS over Au nanoparticles due to its non-toxic and biodegradable nature. The fabrication of flower-like CuS superstructures enhances the absorption capability in the NIR region, exhibiting almost 50% improvement in photothermal conversion efficiency.20 Feng and coworkers155 investigated the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of CuS nanoplates using various cell lines (HeLa, KB, HUVEC and RAW 264.7). They observed no visible toxicity of CuS nanoplates for in vitro experiments against HeLa, KB and RAW 264.7 cells up to 100 μg ml−1 dose. In vivo experiments show that 7.7 mg kg−1 CuS nanoplates have no toxic effect on mice. However, biodistribution of CuS nanoplates was observed in the lungs, spleen and liver due to the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Such information is significant for designing the therapeutic applications of copper sulfide nanostructures.
6. Outlook and conclusion
Copper sulfides with different cationic vacancies in their crystal lattices exhibit a series of phases with tunable optical and electrical properties. The absorption band of copper sulfide in the NIR region accounts for the plasmonic effect due to the presence of charge carriers. This is attributed to different compositions and vacancies created in the crystal structures. The crystal packing of Cu2−xS with different x values further exhibits a semimetallic behavior. Interestingly, copper sulfides in nanoscale dimension with controlled size and shape opened further a new addition. Accordingly, several synthetic procedures have been employed for designing different nanostructures and fabricating nanoheterostructures. The wide variations in their compositions, crystal packing and tunable properties make them flexible for many multifaceted applications in many fields. As an effective photocatalyst, nanostructured pristine Cu2−xS and hybrid materials with appropriate band gap engineering are used for the degradation of organic pollutants. The nanoheterojunctions of copper sulfides with other materials are used in the design and fabrication of photovoltaic solar cells to minimize the loss of charge carriers generated by light absorption and to attain high photoconversion efficiency. In this regard, fabrication of nanohybrid materials of copper sulfides with conductive CNTs, CNFs or their deposition on conductive substrates, such as ITO-coated glass, Cu or Al substrates is found to be a very effective approach. Nanostructured Cu2−xS has also been used in lithium ion rechargeable batteries due to its high lithium activity and high theoretical capacity. Their interesting optical properties as well as non-toxic nature further allow them to be used in different biomedical applications.
