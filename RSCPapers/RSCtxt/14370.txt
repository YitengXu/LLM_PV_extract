    , Accepted 22nd February 2017First published on 22nd February 2017AbstractIn this work, we provide systematic studies on the non-fullerene solar cells based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers as electron donors and a well-known electron acceptor ITIC. ITIC has been widely reported in non-fullerene solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%, when it is combined with a wide band gap conjugated polymer, while its application in small band gap DPP polymers has never been reported. Herein, we select four DPP polymers containing different thienyl linkers, resulting in distinct absorption spectra, energy levels and crystalline properties. Non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as donors and ITIC as an acceptor show PCEs of 1.9–4.1% and energy loss of 0.55–0.82 eV. The PCEs are much lower than those of cells based on fullerene derivatives due to the poor miscibility between the DPP polymers and ITIC, as confirmed by the morphology and charge transport investigation. The results indicate that it is important to tune the miscibility between the donor and acceptor in order to realize optimized micro-phase separation, which can further enhance the performance of DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have entered a new era of non-fullerene electron acceptors, as evidenced by the fast development of non-fullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs) in recent years with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 12%.1–5 Intensive modification of the chemical structures enables non-fullerene conjugated materials to obtain tunable energy levels, charge transport and crystal properties in order to meet the requirement of electron donors, providing the opportunity to improve the photovoltaic performance.6–16 It has been reported that when lowering the energy loss (Eloss) defined as the difference between the optical band gap (Eg) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), and realizing high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs),17 the PCEs of NFOSCs can be close to 20%.18 NFOSCs also show good thermal and bending stability, indicating their promising application in large-area devices.19
Nowadays, the most successful strategies to achieve high performance NFOSCs are to use two components with complementary absorption spectra in photo-active layers, such as wide band gap (with an absorption onset below 700 nm) and medium band gap (with an absorption onset around 800 nm) conjugated materials. For instance, perylene bisimide (PBI) based electron acceptors with strong absorption at 400–600 nm can show PCEs above 9% when combined with low band gap conjugated polymers as donors.20 The other electron acceptors are developed by using electron-donating centres and electron-withdrawing end groups, such as the molecules reported by McCulloch et al.3,21,22 and Zhan et al.7,23–25 with the absorption extending to the near-infrared region. These low band gap electron acceptors were applied in high performance NFOSCs by using wide band gap polymers as electron donors. Among them, a non-fullerene molecule, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) with an absorption onset close to 800 nm, has been widely reported as an universal electron acceptor in NFOSCs.1,25–31
Since sunlight covers a broad spectrum from 300 nm to 1000 nm, it is important to develop NFOSCs with a photo-response in this region. This has also been reported in the literature, especially with a photo-response above 900 nm, but the PCEs were below 4%.32–34 This is mainly due to the limited materials selection of the ultra-low band gap polymers, mainly based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units. Therefore, it is still a challenging task to study the NFOSCs with a photo-response of up to 1000 nm in order to sufficiently utilize the solar energy and can also be applied in tandem and triple-junction solar cells.35
In this work, we are working on NFOSCs based on DPP polymers as electron donors and ITIC as an electron acceptor, which has not been reported elsewhere. DPP polymers have shown successful applications in fullerene-based solar cells, such as using [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) as an acceptor with PCE above 9%.36,37 However, the performance of NFOSCs based on DPP polymer donors is out of expectation, although DPP polymers were reported to show a narrow band gap, high hole mobility38 and good crystallinity.39 In our previous work, we applied several electron acceptors in DPP polymer solar cells, but the EQE is below 0.3 compared to the EQE of 0.65 when using PCBM as an acceptor (Fig. 1).16,33,34,40 Herein, we apply ITIC in DPP polymer solar cells, resulting in a highest PCE of 4.1% with an EQE above 0.4. We further study the morphology and charge transport properties of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) thin films, in which we found that the hole mobilities and crystallinity of DPP polymers in blended thin films were similar to those in pure polymer films. Therefore, we speculate that DPP polymers have poor miscibility with ITIC, resulting in poor phase separation with a large domain and hence relatively low PCEs in solar cells.

Experimental
Commercial chemicals (from Sigma-Aldrich, JK Chemical and TCI) were used as received. DPP polymers, PDPP3T,41PDPP4T,39PDPP5T,42PDPP6T42 and ITIC7 were synthesized according to the literature. The molecular weight was determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 140 °C on a PL-GPC 220 system (Agilent Technologies with a Knauer PDA detector) using a PLgel 10 μm MIXED-B LS column and o-DCB as the eluent against polystyrene standards. A low concentration of a 0.1 mg mL−1 polymer in o-DCB was applied to reduce aggregation. The molecular weights (Mp) of these polymers are 369 kg mol−1 (PDPP3T), 156 kg mol−1 (PDPP4T), 42 kg mol−1 (PDPP5T) and 34 kg mol−1 (PDPP6T). Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrometer with a slit width of 2.0 nm and a scan speed of 1000 nm min−1. Cyclic voltammetry was performed under an inert atmosphere at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and 1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile as the electrolyte, a glassy-carbon working electrode coated with samples, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa multimode atomic force microscope in a tapping mode under ambient conditions. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 double-monochromator luminescence spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled near-IR sensitive photomultiplier (Hamamatsu).
2D-GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline 7.3.343 at the Advanced Light Source. Samples were prepared on Si substrates using identical blend solutions as those used in devices. The 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.12°–0.16°, which was selected to maximize the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected using a Dectris Pilatus 2M photon counting detector.
R-SoXS transmission measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.244 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). Samples for R-SoXS measurements were prepared on a PEDOT:PSS modified Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.). 2-D scattering patterns were collected on an in-vacuum CCD camera (Princeton Instrument PI-MTE). The sample detector distance was calibrated from diffraction peaks of a triblock copolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-2-vinyl pyridine), which has a known spacing of 391 Å. The beam size at the sample is approximately 100 μm by 200 μm.
Photovoltaic devices with inverted configuration were made by spin-coating a ZnO sol–gel45 at 4000 rpm for 60 s onto pre-cleaned, patterned ITO substrates. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating a CHCl3 solution containing DPP polymers and ITIC and an appropriate amount of DIO as the processing additive in air. MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation at ca. 4 × 10−5 Pa as the back electrode.
The active area of the cells was 0.04 cm2. The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under the AM1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Enlitech model SS-F5-3A). The solar simulator illumination intensity was determined at 100 mW cm−2 using a monocrystal silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter. Short circuit currents under AM1.5G conditions were estimated from the spectral response and convolution with the solar spectrum. The external quantum efficiency was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd). The thickness of the active layers in the photovoltaic devices was measured on a Veeco Dektak XT profilometer.
Results and discussion
Absorption and energy levels
The chemical structures of the DPP polymers and ITIC are shown in Fig. 2. We select four DPP polymers containing a DPP core alternating with oligothiophenes, as PDPP3T, PDPP4T, PDPP5T and PDPP6T (Fig. 2). These DPP polymers were synthesized in our lab according to the literature, by using the Stille polymerization condition of a catalyst system of Pd2(dba)3/PPh3 and the solvent mixture toluene/DMF. When the number of thiophene segments was increased, the absorption of the DPP polymers was blue-shifted (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the optical band gap is increased from 1.33 eV to 1.43 eV, 1.45 eV and 1.50 eV for PDPP3T–PDPP6T (Table 1). The absorption spectrum of ITIC in the thin film is also shown in Fig. 3a, showing an absorption onset at 780 nm with an Eg of 1.59 eV.

The energy levels of the DPP polymers and ITIC were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in thin films, as shown in Fig. 3b and summarized in Table 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of these conjugated materials were calculated from the onset of the oxidation potential, showing that the HOMO levels are gradually shifted to a high-lying position, from −5.40 eV for PDPP3T, to −5.25 to −5.33 eV for the other DPP polymers (Table 1). Similar trends can also be found in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the DPP polymers, providing LUMO levels from −3.80 eV to −4.07 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of ITIC determined under the same measurement conditions are −5.61 eV and −4.02 eV. Therefore, we can calculate the HOMO and LUMO difference between the donor polymers and ITIC (ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO). The HOMO offset is around 0.20–0.36 eV, while the LUMO offset shows a significant difference. Interestingly, the LUMO offset between PDPP3T and ITIC is even negative, indicating the negligible driving force for exciton dissociation into free charges. The small LUMO offset will influence the charge separation process in organic photovoltaic cells due to the low driving force for exciton dissociation into free charges.
Non-fullerene solar cells
Non-fullerene solar cells were fabricated by using DPP polymers as electron donors and ITIC as an electron acceptor. The photovoltaic devices with inverted configuration were used with ITO/ZnO and MoO3/Ag as the electrodes. The photo-active layers were solution-processed from CHCl3, in which the high boiling point additive, the ratio of donor to acceptor and the thickness were carefully optimized, as summarized in the ESI† (Table S1–S4). In general, PDPP3T and PDPP4T based cells provided the optimized performance with the ratio of donor to acceptor of 1:2 under fabrication conditions of CHCl3 with 0.2% DIO, while PDPP5T and PDPP6T have the best performance with the ratio of 1:1.5. The optimized J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

PDPP3T:ITIC cells show the best PCE of 1.9% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.2 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.59. The PCE was significantly enhanced to 3.9% for PDPP4T:ITIC cells, which is mainly attributed to a higher Jsc of 8.0 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.63. The Jsc of PDPP5T:ITIC cells was further increased to 9.6 mA cm−2, but with a reduced Voc of 0.69 V, so the PCE is slightly increased to 4.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this also presents the best non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as electron donors. The PCE of PDPP6T:ITIC slightly dropped to 3.8% due to the decreased Jsc of 9.3 mA cm−2. The Jsc of these cells was also reflected by their EQEs, as shown in Fig. 4b. PDPP3T:ITIC cells show a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 900 nm, but the EQE is below 0.2. The EQE can be further enhanced to 0.3 for PDPP4T:ITIC cells and 0.4 for PDPP5T and PDPP6T based cells. The EQE above 0.4 also represents the highest EQE in DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells, confirming that ITIC is an universal electron acceptor.25 The trend of EQE enhancement from PDPP3T to PDPP6T can be due to the gradually enhanced Eloss from 0.55 eV to 0.82 eV, as shown in Table 2. We speculate that in DPP polymers, a high Eloss is important for efficient charge separation in the BHJ system.42 This can be further confirmed by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement, as shown in Fig. 5. The PL of PDPP3T in blended thin films was not quenched, while PDPP4T showed the obviously quenched PL spectra in blended thin films. The quenching ratio can further increase for PDPP5T and PDPP6T based blended thin films (Fig. 5). It is assumed that when the LUMO or HOMO difference between the donor and the acceptor is small, the charge separation will be insufficient, causing poor PL quenching. This can explain the low EQE and Jsc in PDPP3T and PDPP4T cells.

Morphology investigation
The EQE and Jsc of these cells are still low compared to those of PCBM based cells, as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, we intend to provide deep insight into the morphology and charge transport properties of these systems. We first apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyse the morphology of blended thin films, as shown in Fig. 6. At first glance, all the thin films present a smooth surface as indicated by the small roughness (1.3–1.7 nm). However, we can observe worm-like structures or crystallized domains in these thin films. These structures were possibly attributed to the crystallized DPP polymers, indicating that the DPP polymers and ITIC have large phase separation with poor miscibility.

This can be further confirmed by 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurement, as shown in Fig. 7. These DPP polymers present good crystalline properties, as revealed by their high ordering reflection patterns of (h00) peaks and (010) diffraction peaks (Fig. 7a–d). When blended with ITIC, the crystallinity of DPP polymers is slightly reduced, but the diffraction patterns are similar to those of pure polymers. The results indicate that incorporation of ITIC into DPP polymers has little impact on the crystallization of DPP polymers. We further use R-SoXS to get the information regarding the characteristic mode length (domain size) as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S5 (ESI†), in which the large domain size is correlated to the better phase separation and high FF. The blended thin films based on these DPP polymers have a domain size of 23–31 nm, explaining their similar FF in solar cells.

Charge carrier investigation
We further applied space-charge limit current (SCLC) measurement to study the charge transport properties of the pure DPP polymers and blended thin films, as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3. The pure DPP polymers exhibit hole mobilities between 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility in blended thin films is slightly increased, but very similar to those of pure polymers. As observed in AFM and 2D-GIWAXS, the crystallization of DPP polymers is not disturbed in blended thin films, which shows a similar charge transport channel for charge transport. Thus, this explains the similar charge mobility of DPP polymers in pure and blended thin films.

Conclusions
In this work, we study the non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers and ITIC, and explore the limitation in these cells. We achieve PCEs of up to 4% in solar cells, with a photo-response from 300 nm to 900 nm. This is also one of the best PCEs in DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells. Morphology investigation by AFM and 2D-GIWAXS reveals that DPP polymers and ITIC have poor miscibility, causing large phase separation in bulk-heterojunction thin films, reducing photocurrent and PCEs. This can be further confirmed by the SCLC measurement, in which the hole mobility in pure and blended thin films is quite similar. These results show that tuning the micro-phase separation by chemical and physical methods, especially focusing on improving the miscibility of the DPP polymers and ITIC, will be beneficial for high performance non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as electron donors owing to their broad absorption spectra.
