    , Accepted 7th August 2015First published on 13th August 2015AbstractEfficient organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells with regular structure typically use solution-processed electron selective layers. Here, we demonstrated efficient planar perovskite solar cells using vacuum-processed C60 compact electron selective layers at room temperature. The best-performing planar perovskite solar cell has shown a power conversion efficiency of 15.14% with an open circuit voltage of 1.08 V and a fill factor of 74.51% measured under reverse voltage scanning. Our results suggest that vacuum-processed fullerene electron selective layer is a good candidate for fabricating all perovskite tandem solar cells.
Lead halide perovskites have attracted enormous attention in the past few years, owing to their superior photovoltaic properties such as long electron–hole diffusion lengths, high absorption coefficient, tunable band gaps, and high charge carrier mobility.1–5 Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells based on lead halide perovskites have achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20%.6,7 To further improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells, a viable approach is to apply tandem architecture, either using all perovskites or pairing with other solar cell absorbers with smaller bandgaps such as CuInSe2 and Si. Efficient perovskite solar cells usually use electron and hole selective layers.6,8–11 These layers also reduce non-radiative recombination at perovskite/contact interfaces, critical for achieving high open circuit voltages (Voc's). So far, most interface layers are deposited by solution processes and some of the layers even require high temperature sintering, which may inevitably damage or degrade the underlying perovskite cells, limiting the application of these layers in all perovskite tandem cells. Fullerenes, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C60 have been widely used as electron selective layers in perovskite solar cells.12–16 It has been reported that solution-processed fullerenes are excellent passivation materials for CH3NH3PbI3, which can effectively passivate grain boundaries and reduce the density of trap states and therefore reduce hysteresis of perovskite solar cells.15 Compared with PCBM, the low-cost C60 lacks bulky side-chains and can be packed more densely, which facilitates intermolecular charge transport.17 Furthermore, it has been reported that C60 exhibits an electron mobility of 1.6 cm2 V s−1 and a conductivity of 2.3 × 10−3 S cm−1, which are much higher than that of PCBM (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V s−1 and 3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively).17 Perovskite solar cells with the inverted structure based on the solution-processed C60 interface layers exhibited better performance than the cells based on PCBM and indene-C60 bisadduct interface layers.17 Recently, solution-processed C60 compact electron selective layers have also been successfully used in the regular structure to replace compact TiO2.18 Therefore, a compact C60 film should be an excellent candidate for the electron selective layer for perovskite solar cells. Importantly, C60 thin films can be deposited by thermal evaporation,12,15,19 which is a desirable process for fabricating all perovskite tandem cells. However, so far there are no reports on regular perovskite solar cells with vacuum-deposited C60 thin films as electron selective layers.
Here, we demonstrate that room-temperature vacuum-deposited C60 thin films are excellent electron selective layers for planar perovskite solar cells with the regular structure. Our best-performing planar perovskite solar cell based on the vacuum-processed C60 has achieved a PCE of 15.14% with a Voc of 1.08 V and a fill factor (FF) of 74.51% measured under reverse voltage scanning. Furthermore, the planar perovskite solar cell with the regular structure employing a vacuum-deposited C60 exhibited much less hysteresis than the reference cell without an electron selective layer. Our results reveal that vacuum-processed fullerene can act as an efficient electron selective layer, which is very valuable for fabricating all perovskite tandem solar cells.

Fig. 1a shows the device structure of our heterojunction planar perovskite solar cells with the regular structure. The cells consist of compact C60 films, perovskite films, and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) films as electron selective layers, absorber layers, and electron blocking layers (EBLs), respectively. The C60 films were prepared by thermal evaporation. Fig. 1b shows the energy band diagram of our perovskite solar cells. The C60 electron selective layers were inserted between the perovskite films and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) electrodes. The band gap offsets between different layers facilitates effective transport of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite films to the FTO electrodes and transport of holes from the valence band of the perovskite films to the spiro-OMeTAD and then to the metal electrodes. Holes and electrons can be blocked by the C60 films and the spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.

Depositing compact C60 films with complete coverage using solution process has been proven to be difficult because C60 has a very low solubility in commonly used solvents.18 However, compact C60 films can be deposited on most substrates by thermal evaporation. Fig. S1† shows the atomic-force microscopy (AFM) images of 3-dimensional patterns of the FTO substrates without and with a 7.5 nm vacuum-processed C60 electron selective layer. Though FTO substrate has a rough surface (Fig. S1a†), the thermally deposited C60 films can cover the FTO surface smoothly. Therefore, the surface with a C60 film shows a similar morphology (Fig. S1b†). The root mean square roughness of the substrates without and with a C60 film are 11.8 nm and 10.6 nm, respectively. The roughness of the FTO substrate was slightly reduced after the deposition of a 7.5 nm C60 film. It should be noted that the electron selective layer should be compact and thin. Thermal evaporation enables the depositions of large-scale, highly homogeneous, and dense films.20 Therefore, even a very thin C60 film can fully cover the FTO substrate.
Because C60 has a very low solubility in dimethylformamide (DMF) and 2-propanol, synthesis of perovskite films via two-step deposition, i.e., spin-coating of the PbI2 film followed by dip-coating of a CH3NH3I solution, should not significantly damage the C60 film.18 We have found that high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films can be prepared on C60-coated FTO substrates. Fig. 2a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a perovskite film on a substrate covered with a C60 electron selective layer. Our perovskite film shows a dense and smooth surface with large grains. The inset in Fig. 2a shows the cubic-like shape of perovskite grains. The cross-sectional SEM image of a completed device is shown in Fig. 2b, exhibiting an FTO substrate covered with a 7.5 nm C60 electron selective layer, a 380 nm perovskite absorber layer, a 170 nm spiro-OMeTAD EBL, and a 60 nm Au electrode in sequence. The crystallinity of our solution-processed perovskites was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. S2a† shows the XRD pattern of a perovskite film on an FTO substrate covered with a C60 interface layer. The strong peaks of perovskite film indicate good crystallinity. It also shows that our perovskite film did not contain too much remnant PbI2. The PbI2 film was fully converted to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, which is necessary for a thin perovskite film to absorb light efficiently. Fig. S2b† shows that the perovskite film has an absorbance peak at about 760 nm. Our perovskite films exhibit similar structural and optical properties as those reported in literature.21,22

C60 has a band gap of about 1.7 eV and does not contribute to photocurrents.17 To achieve high efficiencies, the thickness of C60 film in a solar cell device should be optimized. We investigated the transmittance of the FTO substrates covered with the C60 interface layers in different thicknesses, shown in Fig. 3a. It is seen that the C60 interface layer does exhibit absorption in the short wavelength and the absorption sensitively depends on the thickness. The transmittance of the substrate was significantly reduced upon deposition with a 20 nm C60 film. However, the absorption is very low when the thickness of C60 is kept below 10 nm. The thickness of the C60 interface layer was found to affect the cell performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells without and with C60 interface layers in different thicknesses measured under reverse voltage scanning are shown in Fig. 3b. Here, the cell performances are seen to improve when thinner C60 interface layers were used in their structure. The perovskite solar cell without a C60 interface layer only achieved a PCE of 7.88 ± 0.26% with a Voc of 0.93 ± 0.01 V, a Jsc of 16.87 ± 0.07 mA cm−2, and an FF of 50.15 ± 1.56%. It is known that a perovskite solar cell without an electron selective layer and a hole blocking layer exhibits a serious charge recombination and shunting at FTO/perovskite interface. The PCE of the cell using only a 2.5 nm C60 film increased sharply to 12.77 ± 0.31% with a Voc of 1.04 ± 0.01 V, a Jsc of 18.09 ± 0.22 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.80 ± 1.17%. The performance of the perovskite solar cells first increased and then decreased as the C60 thickness increased. The optimized thickness of the C60 interface layer is about 7.5 nm. The perovskite solar cell using a 7.5 nm C60 interface layer exhibited the lowest series resistance (Rs) of 1.2 ± 0.1 Ω cm2. An interface layer with a high electron mobility can effectively reduce charge recombination.17 The low Rs can be attributed to the high electron mobility of the dense and ultra-thin C60 interface layer. This cell has achieved a PCE of 14.87 ± 0.20% with a Voc of 1.06 ± 0.01 V, a Jsc of 18.84 ± 0.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.14 ± 0.63%. A thick C60 film has a strong absorption in the 350–550 nm wavelength range (Fig. 3a). Because C60 films do not have good conductivity, the perovskite solar cell using the 20 nm C60 interface layer showed a lower Jsc, a lower FF, and a higher Rs. The corresponding device performance parameters of these cells are summarized in Table 1. Because the electron selective layer does not contribute to photocurrent, a thin and dense interface layer is preferred. The dense C60 films can be easily prepared by thermal evaporation. Even a few nanometers thick C60 interface layer can effectively block the holes and transport the electrons, allowing perovskite solar cells to use ultra-thin C60 films to achieve good performance.

We found that the use of C60 interfacial layers not only improved the cell efficiency, but also reduced hysteresis. Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the best-performing perovskite solar cells without and with a 7.5 nm C60 interface layer measured under different scan directions at the same scan rate. The cell without an interface layer has achieved a PCE of 8.27% under the reverse voltage scanning, but a much lower PCE of 4.55% under the forward voltage scanning. It can be attributed to obvious hysteresis behavior known in perovskite solar cells.23 The perovskite solar cell using a 7.5 nm C60 interface layer achieved PCEs of 15.14% and 13.70% under reverse and forward voltage scanning, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the cells without and with a 7.5 nm C60 interface layer measured under different scan direction are summarized in Table 2. The perovskite solar cells using the C60 interface layer exhibited much less hysteresis than the cell without an interface layer. Reports in literature have demonstrated that the fullerenes can effectively passivate grain boundaries, reduce the density of trap states and the non-radiative recombination.15,24–26 Fullerenes can reduce or even eliminate hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. It has also been reported that the interface charge affects hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. The lower interface charge density can lead to less or even no hysteresis.27 Our previous work has demonstrated that Cl can passivate the interface and therefore effectively improve the cell performance.28 Hence, the reduced hysteresis in the devices reported in this paper can be attributed to C60-induced passivation of the FTO/perovskite interface.

To check the spectral response of the devices, we measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performing perovskite solar cells without and with a 7.5 nm C60 interface layer. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE spectrum of the perovskite solar cell using a C60 interface layer doesn't show an obvious reduction at the short wavelength range due to use of a dense and ultra-thin electron selective layer. The integrated photocurrent obtained from the EQE curve of the cell with a C60 interface layer is 18.75 mA cm−2. This value is very close to the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve under both reverse and forward voltage scanning, which show Jsc of 18.88 and 18.79 mA cm−2, respectively. The high EQE can be attributed to effective electron–hole separation and collection at the interfaces and strong light absorption of the perovskite films. However, the integrated photocurrent obtained from the EQE curve of the cell without an interface layer is only 14.11 mA cm−2. The low EQE can be attributed to serious interface recombination. To check the reproducibility of the devices, we fabricated 30 separate perovskite solar cells that used 7.5 nm C60 electron selective layers. The statistics of the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S3.† The average Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for the 30 cells with vacuum-processed C60 electron selective layers are 1.06 ± 0.02 V, 18.85 ± 0.42 mA cm−2, 71.30 ± 2.74%, and 14.20 ± 0.84%, respectively. The high performance of these cells can be attributed to that the evaporated C60 films are uniform, thin, dense and pinhole-free. We also fabricated perovskite solar cells using solution-processed C60 electron selective layers. The best-performing cell achieved a PCE of 12.24%, a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 18.58 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.54% (Fig. S4†). The relatively lower performance can be attributed to that thick C60 films prepared by spin-coating method exhibit high resistances.
To investigate the passivation effect of the C60 film, we measured the Voc decay curves of the perovskite solar cells with and without a C60 interface layer. The Voc decay measurement has been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells. It can reveal the interface recombination rate and the electron lifetime.28–33Fig. 5a shows the Voc decay curves of the perovskite solar cells with and without a C60 interface layer. These curves indicate three electron transport processes in different voltage regions.29–31 The constant lifetime at high voltage region can be attributed to the free electrons. The exponential increase at medium voltage region can be attributed to internal trapping and detrapping through bulk traps. The inverted parabola at low voltage region can be mainly attributed to the FTO/perovskite interface, which shows obvious difference in our cells without and with a C60 interface layer. Fig. 5a shows that the cell with a C60 interface layer exhibits a much slower Voc decay process than that the cell without an interface layer at low voltage region. The electron lifetime can be calculated by the following equation:29–31τn = −kBTe−1(dVoc/dt)−1where e is the elementary charge, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
 Fig. 5  (a) Voc decay curves and (b) the relationship between electron lifetime and Voc of the perovskite solar cells with and without a C60 interface layer. 

Fig. 5b shows the electron lifetime as a function of Voc. The perovskite solar cell with a C60 interface layer shows a much longer electron lifetime than that the cell without an interface layer over the same voltage region, indicating that the cell with a C60 interface layer has a much lower interface recombination. The thin C60 film can effectively passivate the FTO/perovskite interface and block hole transport across the film, thereby, reducing interface recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated efficient perovskite solar cells using vacuum-processed and room-temperature deposited C60 films as the electron selective layers. The best-performing planar perovskite solar cell using an ultra-thin C60 interface layer has achieved a maximum PCE of 15.14% with a high Voc and FF when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The C60 electron selective layers not only block hole transport but also passivate the FTO/perovskite interface. Therefore, the perovskite solar cells using C60 interface layers showed much higher performances and lower hysteresis than the reference cells without interface layers. Our results suggest that vacuum-processed and low-temperature deposited fullerene can act as an efficient electron selective layer, which is very valuable for fabricating flexible and tandem perovskite solar cells.
