    , Accepted 10th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractGreen hydrogen is increasingly recognized as one of the most promising options to decarbonize the energy and transport sector to achieve the goal of climate neutrality, but its low volumetric density presents significant challenges that need to be addressed. Because of their ease of handling and transportability, liquid carriers such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) and ammonia are particularly appealing. This work presents a comparative sustainability analysis of three liquid carriers: liquid hydrogen, liquid ammonia, and synthetic natural gas, and the three promising LOHCs (methanol, di-benzyl toluene, and methylcyclohexane), based on rigorous economic and environmental evaluations. The overall results indicate that by 2050, the promising carriers for small- to medium-level market penetrations (i.e., 50000 kg d−1) would be ammonia and methanol, with levelized costs of 3.60 and 3.78 $ per kg H2, respectively, while that for high-level market penetrations (i.e., 57.1 Mt per year) is LH2 with a levelized cost of 2.12 $ per kg H2. LH2 is a promising carrier from an environmental perspective because it does not have an energy-intensive dehydrogenation stage. Finally, policy implications are presented as these necessitate the development of a strategic policy framework around the globe to comply with the legal requirements set forth by the United Nations, such as the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.
Introduction
With global warming and strict environmental regulations, decarbonization of the energy and transportation sectors is a global challenge.1,2 Given the significant advancement and deployment of renewable energy over the last decade, the lack of transportable energy carriers has become the primary impediment to the energy transition to renewables.3 The deployment of current solar, wind, and energy storage technologies for energy mobility is imperative if the world is to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting the global average temperature rise to 2 °C.4 It is critical to have a chemical form of energy storage that can enable zero-carbon transportation while also providing high-temperature industrial heat.4 Besides, long-term energy storage and long-distance transportation are other challenges that need to be addressed when finding the most affordable and environmentally friendly energy carrier.5–8 Hydrogen is being considered a potential candidate for such purposes due to its high gravimetric energy density and zero emissions when produced using renewable energy resources such as solar and wind resources. Keeping this in view, several companies in Chile have collaborated on the “Haru Oni” project in 2021 to produce green hydrogen.9 The project aims to use Chile's strong winds in the Magallanes region to produce cost-effective and environmentally friendly hydrogen for domestic applications and exports. However, the biggest obstacle in green hydrogen export is the low volumetric density that makes its storage complex and transportation vastly expensive. Consequently, several liquid carriers are being considered around the world for the development of large-scale and long-term hydrogen storage and mobility infrastructures.
Several analyses have been performed for hydrogen carriers from either an economic or an environmental perspective;10–19 however, rigorous and comprehensive analyses are scarce. For example, Akhtar et al. compared multiple liquid hydrogen carriers, including ammonia, from a life cycle assessment perspective and concluded that liquid hydrogen is the best candidate in terms of the ecological profile.5 However, they did not perform an economic analysis that may present different insights, and the ranking of the evaluated candidates might vary. Similarly, Niermann et al. conducted a techno-economic analysis of various liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). They determined that methanol is the most cost-effective LOHC for long-term storage and long-distance hydrogen transportation.15 However, the environmental profiles of the studied LOHCs were not compared. Wulf et al. performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) for hydrogen transportation via different carriers. They concluded that LOHCs are the worst candidates for long-term storage and long-distance transportation of hydrogen.10 However, they only considered one LOHC (i.e., di-benzyl toluene) and did not conduct an economic analysis, which is imperative in providing decision-making support to policymakers. Akhtar et al. recently conducted an economic and environmental comparison of green hydrogen production by importing green ammonia and transporting domestically produced green hydrogen.17 They concluded that while imported green ammonia is an economically viable option, it is the worst option, primarily due to the environmental impact of NH3 cracking. In a study by Chatterjee et al., NH3 was evaluated as a hydrogen carrier based on its energy efficiency without considering any NH3 or hydrogen transportation.20 The process of separating hydrogen via NH3 cracking is one of the main constraints in terms of the highest energy demand.20
Other than the economic and environmental perspectives, the health impact of various LOHCs has also been studied by Markiewicz et al.21 They emphasized that no general statement can be given for the health impact of the selected LOHCs because many similar mineral oil-based compounds are toxic, and the heavily used diesel also has many safety issues.21 Niermann et al. compared multiple LOHCs from the energy and economical perspectives with the conventional pathways: high-pressure compressed gas and cryogenically liquefied hydrogen for long-term storage and transportation.16 They concluded that for long-distance transportation, methanol is not only economically advantageous but also energetically efficient. For shorter-distance transportation, compressed hydrogen pipelines with cavern storage are an economically viable option.16 Several studies provided policy implications related to green hydrogen production. Unfortunately, they failed to cover the entire supply chain, leaving the research question of which is the best candidate for the long-term storage and long-distance transportation of green hydrogen to guide policy and decision-makers in the rapid transition to the global hydrogen economy.1,4,22,23 The most important aspects that have been less understood so far are as follows: (1) how liquid hydrogen carriers affect the global hydrogen delivery infrastructure and (2) how the economics of these carriers correlate when the renewable hydrogen price, total hydrogen demand, and transportation distance are varied. Consequently, the overall economic, environmental, and policy implications of hydrogen storage and delivery pathways are still uncertain in light of the variable hydrogen price and demand.
To address these research gaps, this work presents the current challenges, bottlenecks, policy implications, and future directions for hydrogen storage and delivery pathways. A large-scale hydrogen delivery infrastructure is presented based on rigorous process simulations, detailed economic models, and a cradle-to-gate LCA. Six different liquid carriers, namely liquid hydrogen (LH2), ammonia (NH3), methanol, synthetic natural gas (SNG), methylcyclohexane (MCH), and di-benzyl toluene (DBT), are evaluated for hydrogen storage and transportation. Green hydrogen is produced through water electrolysis powered by a hybrid solar photovoltaic and wind power plant, but its economic and environmental impact is not considered in the analysis because it would be the same for all pathways. By analyzing the associated costs and emission metrics, we believe that the findings of this analysis can help researchers, energy modelers, system planners, and policymakers make sound decisions on a global-level hydrogen delivery infrastructure.
Methodology
The supply chain considered for all carriers is shown in Fig. 1, and it includes (1) green hydrogen production via renewable electricity-based water electrolysis, (2) pretreatment i.e., loading gaseous hydrogen in a liquid carrier or converting gaseous hydrogen to liquid hydrogen (liquefaction), (3) road transportation and storage, (4) sea transportation, and (5) post-treatment i.e., the release of gaseous hydrogen via dehydrogenation or evaporation followed by carrier return in the case of MCH and DBT. For subsequent techno-economic and environmental analyses, the mass and energy balances of all processes were obtained by simulating pretreatment (i.e., hydrogenation and liquefaction) and post-treatment (i.e., dehydrogenation and evaporation) processes in Aspen Plus V12.2. Appropriate thermodynamic property packages were selected to accurately calculate the mass and energy balances. For example, the Peng Robinson equation of state was used when the processing units were operating above 10 bar or dealing with gas phases. Likewise, the non-random two-liquid activity coefficient model was employed when the processing units were operating below 10 bar or dealing with liquid phases. Heat integrations were also performed to reduce the operating costs. More specifically, stream matchings were performed by considering a minimum temperature approach of 30 °C, 20 °C, 10 °C, and 5 °C between gas–gas, gas–liquid, liquid–liquid, and liquid–condensing vapor, respectively. The complete processing information of all pathways with their process flow diagrams is given in Fig. S1–S6 of the ESI.† The mass storage density of different carriers along with their operating conditions and the reactions used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are reported in Table S1.† Once the required mass and energy balances were obtained, the entire supply chain of all pathways was modeled in spreadsheets to perform techno-enviro-economic analyses.

Economic analysis was performed by developing a discounted cash flow rate of return analysis model based on the total capital investment (TCI) and total cost of manufacturing (TCOM). The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) was selected as an economic indicator for evaluating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of different carriers and is defined as follows:  where NPV is the net present value. The NPV of total costs is estimated as follows:  where IRR is the internal rate of return. The TCI was determined based on the total installation cost. Aspen Plus economic analyzer and data from the literature were used to estimate the total installed cost. When necessary, the costing data were scaled based on the power-law and multiplied with the installation factor to determine the installation cost. Finally, the installation cost was updated to the analysis year using the chemical engineering plant cost index. The aforementioned methodology for determining the total installation cost can be mathematically represented as follows:  where TIC is the total installed cost; Cj,o is the baseline equipment cost of j; Qj and Qj,o are the adjusted and baseline capacities of equipment j; and Ij,o is the installation factor of equipment j. Once the total installation cost of the plant is determined, the factor approach given in Table 1 is used to calculate the TCI. The TCOM is estimated as follows:TCOM = CRM + CUT + COL,where CRM, CUT, and COL stand for the cost of raw material, cost of utility, and cost of operating labor, respectively. The latter was assumed to be 1.6% of the TIC. CRM and CUT were calculated based on the material and energy balance. Table S2† presents the raw material and utility prices used to calculate the CRM and the CUT. Tables S3 and S4† summarize the assumptions used to model road and sea transportation.

Finally, cradle-to-gate LCA was performed to evaluate and compare the environmental burden of the six hydrogen supply scenarios. As shown in the system boundary (Fig. S7†), the environmental impact was calculated by considering five stages: hydrogen production, pretreatment, trucking, shipping, and post-treatment. The complete life cycle inventory is given in Table S5,† which is normalized by selecting 1 kg of hydrogen with 99.99 wt% purity as a functional unit. The characterization data used to calculate environmental impact were retrieved from Ecoinvent 3.8, ELCD, and USLCI (Table S6†) and characterized for life cycle impact assessment using the CML-IA V3.06 method in SimaPro 9.4.0.7 in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044.28–31 Eleven impact categories are considered in this assessment to analyze the complete life cycle profiles of hydrogen delivery through different routes, as shown in Table S7 of the ESI.† Since hydrogen production via electrolysis and subsequent pretreatment (hydrogenation or liquefaction) of hydrogen take place at a renewable rich location, we assume that these processes are powered by electricity produced by solar and wind (50% contribution from each). However, dehydrogenation (post-treatment) is powered by fossil driven electricity because this process will take place at a renewable lean location.
Results and discussion
Table S8† summarizes the material and energy balances and capital costs. The techno-economic results in Fig. 2 indicate that ammonia is a promising carrier for the long-term storage and transportation of hydrogen. The LCOH via ammonia is determined to be 8.31 $ per kg, with hydrogenation (primarily renewable hydrogen cost) and sea transportation accounting for most of the contribution. Although methanol has a lower hydrogen mass storage density (12.6 wt%) than ammonia (17.8 wt%), the lack of refrigeration makes methanol a promising candidate for transportation. Overall, methanol is found to be the second promising carrier for hydrogen storage and transportation, followed by the MCH pathway. The key economic barriers found in the SNG pathway are liquefaction (capital intensive) and the auto-thermal reforming process (energy-intensive), with an LCOH of 11.6 $ per kg. Likewise, the high raw material cost and large flow rate requirement (7306 kg h−1 as initial loading and 7.3 kg h−1 as makeup) due to the low hydrogen storage density (6.2 wt%) of the carrier are found to be the main bottlenecks for the high LCOH in the DBT pathway. It is worth noting that the sea transportation of MCH and DBT carriers includes carrier return; the sea transportation via LH2 is 2.8 times more expensive than that via the MCH and DBT pathways. However, if the hydrogen demand is increased from 10000 kg d−1 (base case) to 50000 kg d−1, the sea transportation cost and LCOH decrease from 6.83 $ per kg to 1.42 $ per kg and 16.09 $ per kg to 8.77 $ per kg, respectively. This indicates that hydrogen delivery via LH2 is not an economically feasible option for low hydrogen demand.

Fig. 3 shows the characterization scores of international transport of renewable hydrogen via different carriers, and Table S9† shows the indicator results. Overall, the results in Fig. 3 suggest the following decreasing order for the environmental impact of hydrogen delivery via different carriers: LH2 < methanol < DBT < ammonia < SNG < MCH.

In-depth insight can be provided by analyzing the breakdown of the hydrogen supply chain via different carriers. Fig. 4 presents the LCA results for the six environmental categories, and Tables S10–S15 (ESI†) present the results of all eleven categories. The abiotic depletion potential is mainly affected by the extraction of raw materials for carrier production in the pretreatment stage of all carriers except SNG. Notably, Fig. 4 reveals that hydrogen supply via the LH2 route is the most eco-friendly with the lowest global warming potential of 1.03 kg CO2 eq., which is mainly due to the elimination of the energy-intensive dehydrogenation stage. It can also be observed from Fig. 4 that in methanol, SNG, and ammonia, the contribution to the global warming potential from dehydrogenation is between 40 and 98%, indicating that dehydrogenation is the key bottleneck to the environment for these pathways. In this regard, novel catalysts for dehydrogenation processes under mild operating conditions must be developed to reduce utility consumption and ultimately, environmental impact. Another possible solution would be to use hydrogen retrieved from carriers in part to avoid using fossil-based utilities for dehydrogenation. However, this strategy will necessitate more hydrogen (delivery) to compensate for hydrogen loss due to power dehydrogenation, imposing an additional burden on the upstream. The direct use of carriers in onboard vehicles, turbines, and fuel cells can eliminate the need for energy- and capital-intensive dehydrogenation, significantly improving the environmental profile. MCH and DBT are the worst routes from an environmental perspective with a global warming potential of 27.58 and 26.70 kg CO2 eq., respectively, due to the large flow rate requirements of the carrier (15.20 and 15.01 kg−1 of hydrogen, respectively) and energy-intensive pretreatments (13.4 and 11.1 kW h kg−1 of hydrogen, respectively). Notably, if NH3 and methanol are used directly as fuel without regeneration of H2, the global warming potential is reduced drastically to 0.66 and 0.57 kg CO2 eq. for NH3 and MeOH, respectively, which is even lower than the global warming potential for LH2 (1.03 kg CO2 eq.). In all routes, the ODP is mainly affected by dehydrogenation (3.9–73.2%) and diesel consumed in trucks (5.3–16.7%) and ships (13.5–60.2%) for domestic and international transportation. Likewise, the dehydrogenation of carriers is found to be a major driver of human toxicity potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential in all routes except MCH and DBT where pretreatment is the main cause of the aforementioned indicators due to the large flowrate requirement of carriers and energy requirement for subsequent hydrogenation.

Compared to the current gasoline prices, the calculated LCOH for all carriers in Fig. 2 is very high and should be decreased substantially before the large-scale deployment of the hydrogen economy. According to BloombergNEF, green hydrogen will cost around 2 $ per kg by 2030 and 1 $ per kg by 2050, but only in locations with abundant renewable energy resources to produce cheap renewable electricity.32 Keeping these projections in view, we developed learning curves by performing two-dimensional sensitivity analyses to investigate the expected value of LCOH for different carriers in the near future. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that ammonia and methanol are the only carriers that can deliver hydrogen at 4 $ per kg. However, ammonia is more promising because it can achieve an LCOH of 4 $ per kg at a wide range of hydrogen demands and prices. Given a renewable hydrogen price of 1 $ per kg by 2050 and a demand of 50000 kg d−1, the LCOH for ammonia as a carrier would be 3.60 $ per kg, which can be reduced to 2.30 $ per kg if NH3 is used directly as a fuel in direct ammonia fuel cell vehicles. The global warming potential would fall from 10.50 to 0.66 kg CO2 eq. by removing dehydrogenation from the ammonia supply chain. Therefore, the future research direction should focus on eliminating capital- and energy-intensive dehydrogenation processes and decreasing the production cost of hydrogen from solar and wind farms.
 Fig. 5  Two-dimensional sensitivity analysis on levelized cost of hydrogen for different carriers. The price of hydrogen obtained via electrolysis is varied from 1 to 5 $ per kg and the hydrogen demand at the destination is varied from 5000–50000 kg d−1 to find the optimal carrier delivering hydrogen to the destination below 5 $ per kg. (A) = ammonia; (B) = methanol; (C) = MCH; (D) = SNG; (E) = DBT; and (F) = LH2. 
Interestingly, the decision regarding the optimal liquid hydrogen carrier is mainly governed by the hydrogen market penetration. For example, the promising carrier for the low-level hydrogen market penetration (10000–85000 kg d−1) is ammonia with an LCOH between 8.31 and 6.36 $ per kg, while that for the mid-level hydrogen market penetration (0.125–6.72 kt per d) is methanol with an LCOH between 6.20 and 5.45 $ per kg. For the high-level hydrogen market penetration (>6.72 kt per year), LH2 is always selected as the promising carrier for long-term energy storage and transportation. Interestingly, MCH, DBT, and SNG were not selected as economically viable carriers even for a single time for low-, mid-, and high-level hydrogen market penetrations. Better insight can be drawn by considering a roadmap to 2050, where the targets for the large-scale deployment of the hydrogen industry are presented for various countries.33 We considered 13 countries to investigate which carrier is suitable for them based on their hydrogen production targets (0.09–35 Mt per year) for 2030–2050.34 The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that for the low hydrogen demand scenarios (Paraguay, Chile, New Zealand, S. Korea, and Japan), methanol is the promising carrier for energy storage and transportation, while for high hydrogen market demand scenarios (Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States), LH2 is the promising carrier for transporting green hydrogen at the desired location with a minimum LCOH. The practical implication of Fig. 6 is that countries can decide whether they should import or export hydrogen to meet their environmental sustainability targets most economically. For example, the domestic LCOH of green hydrogen production in S. Korea and Chile is 9.55 and 1.67 $ per kg, respectively.35,36 However, the calculated imported LCOH is 2.3 and 2.9 $ per kg for S. Korea and Chile, respectively, indicating that for S. Korea importing hydrogen is more economically feasible than domestic production of hydrogen, and the reverse is true for Chile.

Policy implications and future directions
Considering the current challenges related to hydrogen transportation over long distances, the ambitious rapid transition toward a green hydrogen economy, and the legal compulsions set by the United Nations (e.g., Paris Agreement) to achieve Net-Zero by 2050 and Sustainable Development Goals, it is deemed of importance to explore alternative approaches for a hydrogen economy that does not require a new hydrogen infrastructure. This study reveals numerous key characteristics of various liquid carriers. Based on these findings, future directions and targets are proposed, which might be used to establish suitable policy measures for developing a global hydrogen economy.
Ammonia already has a global production and transportation infrastructure of millions of metric tons and has been used to make fertilizers for the last 100 years. Furthermore, the highest volumetric and gravimetric energy densities make green ammonia the most appealing and versatile hydrogen storage carrier because of its diverse end-use sectors, including industries, transportation, and power generation using direct ammonia fuels and jet engines. Despite several advantages, the current manufacturing method for ammonia production is not that eco-friendly; hence, we must find ways to introduce steps in the current process to make it more environmentally friendly. One way of doing so is to operate the reactor at a lower temperature and pressure without compromising the yield.37,38 Another potential solution is the development of electrochemical ammonia synthesis, which operates under mild conditions and has zero carbon dioxide emissions.39 Hydrogen release from the carrier at the destined location is another key economic bottleneck. Akhtar et al. recommended that direct ammonia utilization in direct ammonia fuel cell vehicles is a promising option for improving its economic and environmental performance.5
Methanol and SNG are two interesting hydrogen carriers because their production uses CO2 as a concept of carbon capture and utilization. However, the current carbon capture methods, namely point source (pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion) and direct air capture, are capital- and energy-intensive. For example, the MEA absorption process, as one of the most developed and mature technologies, requires a capital of approximately 96 $ per (t of CO2 capture capacity per year) and an energy between 3 MJ kg−1 CO2 and 4.5 MJ kg−1 CO2. The latter would decrease the overall power plant efficiency from 24.4% to 35%.40 One possible strategy to avoid the huge capital and manufacturing costs of CO2 capture is recycling CO2 between the source (renewable energy-rich country) and the destination (renewable energy-lean country). Nevertheless, implementing CO2 recycling between countries negatively affects the economy due to the huge capital investment and manufacturing costs needed to capture and liquefy CO2 at a destination, followed by sea transportation of CO2 from the destination to the source country. Therefore, future research and development activities should focus on improving the economic viability of CCS technologies instead of recycling CO2 between countries.
The main bottlenecks for MCH and DBT carriers are low energy storage density (i.e., 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively) and energy-intensive dehydrogenation (i.e., 11.7 kW h kg−1 and 18 kW h kg−1, respectively). The former requires high flow rates to chemically bind hydrogen in carriers, increasing the capital and raw material costs, while the latter requires an expensive heating utility to release hydrogen, thereby increasing the manufacturing costs. Another bottleneck is the purchase cost of DBT (4 $ per kg), which is the top player in determining the overall economic viability of this pathway, as suggested by a sensitivity analysis. All the aforementioned findings clearly indicate that for cost-effective energy transportation and storage, future carriers should (1) be inexpensive, (2) have high storage density, and (3) have low dehydrogenation heat.
Analogous to the NH3 and methanol routes, the LH2 route is a well-understood and mature process. However, the economic viability of this pathway is largely governed by the market penetration or scale. As previously shown, this pathway becomes optimal, and vice versa, at high demands. The key benefit of this pathway is that it has minimal environmental impact compared to all other pathways. Nevertheless, several steps can be taken to make this pathway even better in terms of economics. The first research direction should focus on reducing the energy demand of large-scale hydrogen liquefaction systems. For the current technologies, Baryton and Claude consume 12.3–13.4 and 10.8–12.7 kW h kg−1 LH2,41 respectively. Whereas the minimum theoretical energy for liquefying hydrogen under ambient conditions is 3.3 kW h kg−1 LH2 or 3.9 kW h kg−1 LH2 with conversion to para-LH2.42 The IDEALHY report showed a remarkable reduction in specific energy consumption to approximately 6.4 kW h kg−1 H2.43 However, further improvements are possible through the application of more innovative approaches, machinery, and equipment to simultaneously lower the capital and manufacturing costs.
To this end, an effective policy framework is required if government institutes and governing bodies are to achieve Net-Zero Carbon by 2050 while not violating the targets set to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, it is recommended to shift the paradigm toward the ammonia, methanol, and LH2-based green hydrogen economy and develop global policy frameworks that are required to shift toward an economy based on renewables rather than fossil fuels. It will require building multi-GW green energy and hydrogen production systems at idealized locations with optimal wind speed and solar irradiance to ensure the availability of the cheapest possible renewable electricity and hydrogen. For a 100% hydrogen economy, much more investments in renewable energies are needed. For example, the global primary energy consumption was 173340 TW h in 2019, whereas the energy production from solar and wind resources was only 5333 TW h.44 Furthermore, when formulating a global policy for the hydrogen economy, hydrogen requirements for processing (hydrogenation and dehydrogenation) and delivery (trucking and shipping) should be considered in addition to market penetration. It can be seen from Table 2 that for a hydrogen market penetration of 450 Mt per year or 15065 TW h, approximately 22.2% (5333 TW h), 45.1% (10803 TW h), and 90.4% (13612 TW h) extra power are required to produce hydrogen as a fuel for processing and delivery of green hydrogen via LH2, methanol, and ammonia, respectively. The renewable energy produced (5333 TW h) from solar and wind resources in 2019 could barely meet the additional power needed for the processing and delivery (5333–13612 TW h) of green hydrogen at 450 Mt per year or 15065 TW h. Therefore, projects involving renewable energy production, supply, and sales should be encouraged to hasten the transition to an aforementioned LOHC-based green hydrogen economy. More subsidies, cost-effective technologies, and public awareness can help achieve a Net-Zero Carbon economy by 2050. Having said that, one must carefully consider the environmental impacts of the production and use of LOHCs as a new fuel, as it raises some safety concerns. Although the rules and regulations for ammonia, methanol, and LH2, including exposure limits, are widely recognized, it is evident that humanity must avoid creating another crisis involving ammonia and NOx emissions to avert a single dilemma revolving around CO2.

Conclusions
Sustainability is not only a goal to be accomplished but also one that must be practically demonstrated because only in this way will existing challenges, such as climate change, growing energy demand, and the availability of clean and affordable energy, be addressed. Analyses that yield these results should be encouraged, and good performance should be rewarded. It may be time for a watershed moment in which subsidies are granted “only for truly sustainable initiatives,” and everything that contributes to environmental damage is penalized. Given the importance of green hydrogen in achieving a net-zero emission economy, it is deemed critical that comprehensive hydrogen strategies and decadal plans be developed globally, based on the findings of rigorous research studies that state the key findings and present guidelines for policy implications and future directions. Based on the findings of this study, it is concluded that for the development of a small- to medium-scale green hydrogen delivery infrastructure, ammonia and methanol would be the two promising candidates for providing green hydrogen at the desired location with an LCOH less than $ 4 per kg by 2050.
Meanwhile, energy transportation via LH2 is a promising pathway for large-scale hydrogen demands. The global warming potential results indicate a different scenario, owing to bottlenecks in carrier dehydrogenation at the destination. From an environmental perspective, LH2 is the optimal carrier. At present, no single LOHC is 100% free from demerits. An ideal LOHC must have a high hydrogen storage capacity and low production costs. In addition, LOHCs with low toxicity are favored because their transport is easier. Low desorption heat is preferred for dehydrogenation at low temperatures. LOHCs should also be compatible with the current fuel structure. Excessively volatile compounds are not favored as LOHCs because they may introduce impurities in the released hydrogen, requiring an extra purification step, and adding to the overall costs. All these parameters adversely affect the estimations for environment feasibility; thus, better LOHC candidates must be searched for.
Therefore, to meet all the legal requirements set forth by the United Nations, such as the Paris Agreement 2050 and Sustainable Development Goals, an effective hydrogen policy framework comprising short- and long-term goals based on a specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound methodology is considered necessary. Water electrolysis is one of the most capable methods of producing hydrogen. However, focused research on the system and a continuous improvement process are required to lower the cost associated with this route while enhancing the energy conversion efficiency and ensuring an extended lifetime. In addition, to address economic, regulatory, supply chain, and policy factors, R&D should be integrated with a private–public partnership for technological demonstration initiatives, resulting in a credible de-risking method to attract private investment. The development of specific task forces at the national level worldwide can help accelerate the deployment of hydrogen projects and applications at a global scale. Finally, programs, such as social development, capacity building, and innovation programs, can help in the vertical communication of benefits and opportunities related to environmental and safety challenges to effectively address the negative perceptions associated with implementing the green hydrogen economy. Furthermore, social factors such as public participation, community outreach programs, and incentivized volunteering activities are all equally important in encouraging and hastening the transition to green hydrogen-based energy and transportation systems.
