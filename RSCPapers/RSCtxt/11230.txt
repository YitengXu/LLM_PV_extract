    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 13th July 2018AbstractAs a member of the bismuth iodide family compounds, Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite shows potential applications in photovoltaic devices and radiation detectors, due to the absence of toxic lead and its high air and moisture stability. In this work, we report Cs3Bi2I9 bulk crystals grown by a low temperature solvent volatilized crystallization method. The morphology of the single crystals exhibits a well symmetric hexagonal shape, with a layered structure along the [00l] direction. Three defect related transitions (iodine substituting bismuth (IBi) to the valence band maximum (VBM), the conduction band minimum (CBM) to caesium substituting bismuth (CsBi1−/2−), and the CBM to caesium substituting iodine (CsI1+/2+)) are identified in 10 K photoluminescence spectra, with dissociation energies of 47.87 meV, 45.28 meV, and 52.01 meV, respectively. The anisotropic resistivities along the [00l] and [l00] directions are compared, with values of 11.08 GΩ cm and 0.77 GΩ cm, respectively, which is attributed to the difference of carrier mobility. This is further certified by the first principles calculations, which demonstrate that the effective masses along the [00l] and [l00] directions are 3.22me (electrons)/2.14me (holes) and 0.327me (electrons)/0.946me (holes), respectively. The Cs3Bi2I9 device exhibits fast photoresponse to optical light, with an on–off ratio of ∼24 along [l00], which is fifteen times higher than that along [00l]. This photoelectric anisotropy dictates the potential applications in photovoltaic devices and radiation detectors.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites with a general formula of APbX3 (A = CH3CH3+, NH2CHNH2, Cs; X = I, Br, Cl) have demonstrated remarkable performances in radiation detection,1–4 LEDs,5,6 lasing,6,7 and solar cells.8–10 However, the toxic lead element limits their future applications. Recently, bismuth halide materials with a chemical formula of A3Bi2X9 (A = Cs or MA; X = I, Br, Cl) have emerged to avoid toxic elements.11–14 Among them, Cs3Bi2I9 was shown to be a potential material in this system due to its relatively high power conversion efficiency reported in photovoltaic devices15 and high chemical stability.13 Photoconductivity under laser excitation as well as a high resistivity of 9 × 1012 Ω cm were found in Cs3Bi2I9,16 which indicate its potential application in hard radiation detection. The structure of Cs3Bi2I9 consists of edge-sharing [BiI6]3− octahedral layers with the voids filled with Cs+ cations between the layers,17 resulting in a two-dimensional layered crystal structure. Thus, Bi3+ exhibits a stronger tendency to form lower dimensional structures than Pb2+, meaning the evident anisotropy in the structure and properties.
This distinctive structure is expected to generate great impacts on the properties of Cs3Bi2I9. Cs3Bi2I9 crystals were reported to be grown by high temperature methods, such as the Bridgman method16,17 and solvothermal reaction method.13 Recently, low temperature solution growth methods4,18,19 have been widely adopted in growing inorganic halide perovskites due to the use of cheap experimental equipment, short growth periods, etc. However, these facile methods have not been attempted in the growth of Cs3Bi2I9 crystals. For solution methods, a suitable solvent needs to be selected to dissolve the specific perovskite compounds. γ-Butyrolactone (GBL) is a solvent that is generally applied for the growth of I-based systems,20 and the solubility of Cs3Bi2I9 is high, which suggests that it is possible to synthesize Cs3Bi2I9 in specific solvents at room temperature. Thus, low temperature solution methods are shown to be possible to grow Cs3Bi2I9 crystals easily and efficiently.
In this work, we report Cs3Bi2I9 bulk crystals grown by a low temperature solution method at 50–60 °C under ambient atmosphere. The morphology and structure of the resulting single crystals were evaluated. To reveal the optical properties of the as-grown crystals, the photoluminescence spectra were obtained. In addition, the anisotropic electrical properties of Cs3Bi2I9 were studied, which were combined with the first principles calculations. The photoelectric performances of the anisotropic single crystals were also investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of precursors and crystal growth
CsI (≥99.9%), BiI3 (≥99.9%) and gamma-butyrolactone (≥99.9%) were used as the starting materials. According to the stoichiometric ratio of Cs3Bi2I9, 6 mmol CsI powder and 4 mmol BiI3 powder were dissolved in 10 mL GBL at room temperature. During the dissolving process, the colour of the mixed solution gradually turned crimson. The solution was continuously stirred for 6 hours and then filtered using 22 μm pore-size filters. Finally, the dark crimson transparent solution was obtained as the precursor.
Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals were grown by the solvent volatilized crystallization (SVC) method.19 As shown in Fig. 1(a), 10 mL precursors were put into a container, and the top of the container was sealed by aluminum foil. There were several holes on the foil to ensure that the solvent could be volatilized out. The container was put onto a hot plate, and the temperature was set at 60 °C. After 6 h, the precursor was saturated and then cooled to 50 °C with a rate of 1 °C h−1. During the cooling, several nuclei formed and finally grew at 50 °C for 3 days. After the growth, more than ten millimeter-sized plate-like Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals and several polycrystals with a dark crimson colour were obtained.

2.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of both powder and a single crystal were collected using a D/Max2500PC with CuKα1 in the range of 10–70°. The UV-vis spectra of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals were measured on a UV-2550 spectrometer with an integrating sphere over the spectral range of 450–850 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out on a Tescan MIRA3 XMU field emission scanning electron microscope. A TRIAX 550 fluorescence spectroscope was used to collect photoluminescence (PL) spectra, with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The Current–voltage (I–V) was measured using an electrical property measurement system (Agilent 4155C). Carbon electrodes were deposited to fabricate devices, with electrode areas of 8 mm2 and 3 mm2 for the [00l] and [l00] directions, respectively.
2.3 First-principles calculations
In the framework of the density functional theory (DFT), calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)21–24 within the framework of the projected augmented-wave method (PAW).25,26 The cutoff energy for the plane-wave expansion is set at 350 eV. The Brillouin zone (BZ) is sampled using a 7 × 7 × 3 k-point mesh for the unit cell of Cs3Bi2I9. During structural relaxation, the energy convergence criterion is 10−4 eV per unit cell, and the lattice constants and the atom coordinates are optimized until the convergence of the force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1. For the calculation of the band structure, a high symmetry path is assumed from Γ (0, 0, 0) to K (0.333, 0.333, 0), M (0.5, 0, 0), Γ (0, 0, 0), and L (0.5, 0, 0.5).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal growth and structure
The growth processes include three stages. First, the nearly saturated precursor was heated to 60 °C, with the solubility of Cs3Bi2I9 increasing. By volatilizing the solvent at this temperature, the precursor became saturated again. The second stage was the nucleus formation and growth stage. By cooling the precursor, nuclei formed and grew with the decrease of solubility and the volatilization of solvent. The cooling rate must be precisely controlled under 1 °C h−1, or a large number of nuclei can be formed and overspread at the bottom of the container. In the last stage, crystals grew at 50 °C with the volatilization of solvent. The growth rate can be tailored by the number of the holes on the foil and the temperature of the hot plate illustrated in Fig. 1(a).

Fig. 1(b) shows the size distribution of the resulting Cs3Bi2I9 crystals, with cross-section and thickness values in the range of 2–10 mm2 and 0.4–0.6 mm, respectively. Fig. 1(c) shows a typical Cs3Bi2I9 crystal with a hexagonal shape, which consists of a hexagonal close packed lattice. There are many growth steps on the rough surface of the crystal, which is mainly due to the dislocation growth mechanism and the rapid growth rate. Fig. 1(d) shows the crystal structure of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal, in which Cs and I atoms are closest packed and Bi atoms occupy 2/3 of the octahedral I6 voids.17,27–29 Isolated Bi2I93− ions form as pairs of face-sharing Bi–I octahedra, which results in a hexagonal symmetric structure with the Cs atoms filling the hexagonal channels. This structure determines that the crystals preferentially grow along the (00l) faces.
Further to investigate the structure of the resulting solution-grown Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals, the powder XRD pattern was measured, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The results of the XRD pattern refinement demonstrate that Cs3Bi2I9 crystallizes in the space group P63/mmc, and the corresponding cell parameters a = 8.411 Å and c = 21.182 Å, which are in agreement with previous reports.13,16,17 Because no phase transition occurred during growth, stoichiometric Cs3Bi2I9 was achieved. Other phases were not observed in the powder XRD pattern. In addition, the XRD pattern of the Cs3Bi2I9 single crystal is shown in Fig. 2(b), exhibiting a set of (00l) diffraction faces, which is from the top face of the crystal showed in Fig. 1(c).

3.2 Morphology of Cs3Bi2I9 crystals
The morphology of the solution-grown Cs3Bi2I9 crystals was investigated by SEM. The surface of the single crystal exhibits a well symmetric hexagonal shape, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For solution growth, the morphology of crystals is mainly determined by the chains of strong bonds, which limit the crystal growth in specific directions. According to the law of Donnay & Harker,30 crystals grow rapidly in the direction where the bonds are the strongest. For Cs3Bi2I9, the (00l) faces contain the highest percentage of strong chemical bonds (Bi–I), but the chemical bonds between the (00l) faces are weak. Therefore, the growth rate is rapid along the (00l) faces while it is low along the direction vertical to the (00l) faces. Furthermore, due to the hexagonal symmetric structure and equilibrium growth conditions, the lateral faces ((l00), (0l0), and (ll0) faces) have the same growth rate, which makes the top faces a symmetric hexagonal shape.

Fig. 3(b) reveals the layered structure from the cleavage face, which is marked in Fig. 3(a), and the thickness of the layers is 1–4 μm. According to the crystal structure, two BiI6 octahedra form isolated Bi2I93− ions by sharing the edge face, with the Cs+ ions filling the center of the hexagonal unit. Thus, the two-dimensional (2D) structure was formed by the alternating arrangement of hexagonal units in parallel. In the SVC method, the growth speed is controlled by the volatilization rate of the solvent. Small-sized Cs3Bi2I9 crystals were formed due to the relatively fast volatilization rate. As shown in Fig. 3(c), small grains were adhered together to form Cs3Bi2I9 polycrystals, and plenty of nuclei ranging from 10 to 30 μm were enriched on the surface of the crystals. Therefore, to obtain large-size Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals, the number of nuclei should be critically controlled for solution growth. The corresponding EDS analysis indicates that the ratio of Cs, Bi and I is 2.82:2:9.19, shown in Fig. 3(d), which is close to the stoichiometric concentration.
3.3 Optical properties of Cs3Bi2I9 crystals

Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-vis transmission spectrum of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals. A sharp rise around 610 nm can be observed, which illustrates the high purity as well as low density of shallow energy level defects. A mean transmittance of 42% can be observed from 660 to 800 nm. The bandgap (Eg) of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals was calculated to be about 1.94 eV by fitting the Tauc plot,13 as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a), which is similar to 1.90 eV from a crystal grown by a solvothermal reaction method,13 but distinct from 2.06 eV using the Bridgman method.16 The variation of the experimental Eg was possibly caused by the different test methods (UV-vis optical diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measured by other works).

The band structure of Cs3Bi2I9 was further calculated by the first principles method, with the result shown in Fig. 4(b). The calculated indirect bandgap is around 2.30 eV, which is similar to previous calculated results of 2.32 eV (ref. 13) and 2.34 eV.31 The calculated Eg is higher than the experimental one, which is mainly attributed to the DFT structure optimization, the unit cell volume is more overestimated for Cs metal homologues, as compared with lighter alkali salts.13 From the band structure, the curvature of the lowest conduction bands is higher than that of the top valence band, indicating the higher mobility of electrons than that of holes.32
The temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties of the Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals were studied under variable incident power values. Fig. 5(a) shows the excitation-power-dependent PL spectra from 0.40 mW to 2.30 mW at 10 K. There are some overlapping peaks in the range of 1.84–2.07 eV, which is in agreement with previous reports.13,16 To analyse the overlapping peaks, the PL curves were resolved by fitting peaks using a Gaussian curve. The PL spectrum can be resolved into three peaks, with energies of 1.92 eV, 1.96 eV and 2.04 eV, independent of the incident power, shown in Fig. 5(b). According to previous calculations on defect levels,31 these three resolved peaks (1.92 eV, 1.96 eV, 2.04 eV) could be assigned to iodine substituting bismuth (IBi) to the VBM, the CBM to caesium substituting bismuth (CsBi1−/2−), and the CBM to caesium substituting iodine (CsI1+/2+), respectively. In Cs3Bi2I9, the substitutions CsBi and CsI are formed easily because of the lower formation energies, which have been reported by calculation results.31 The bond between Cs and I is weak, so it is easier to form Cs defects, resulting in the multiple peaks of the PL spectra.

(b) The overlapping peaks are resolved into three peaks using the Gaussian fitting method, named peaks 1, 2, and 3. (c) The relationship between PL intensities vs. incident powers.

(f) The intensities of the three peaks fitted as a function of temperature by eqn (1). 
The PL peak intensity (I) as a function of incident beam intensity (F) is shown in Fig. 5(c), displaying a power law dependence (I ∝ Fγ) for all three peaks. The resulting values of the exponential coefficient γ are 0.98, 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. All the recombination originates from donor–acceptor pair (DAP) or free-to-bound (FB) recombination since the γ values are less than 1,16 which is consistent with the previous analysis. Furthermore, the temperature dependent PL spectra under the incident power of 1.7 mW were evaluated, as seen in Fig. 5(d). Upon increasing the temperature from 10 to 100 K, these three combination peaks gradually attenuated. When the temperature rises up to 100 K, these three peaks disappear as the enhancement of the thermal excitation. Fig. 5(e) presents the integrated colour graph of changes of PL intensities at variable temperatures and energies. To further understand this, the intensities of the three peaks were fitted as a function of temperature by the given equation,33 shown in Fig. 5(f), (1)where I(T) is the intensity at different temperatures, I(0) is the zero-temperature intensity, C is a constant, and E is the dissociation energy during the quenching process. The resulting dissociation energies of the three peaks are 47.87 meV, 45.28 meV, and 52.01 meV, respectively, fitted by eqn (1).
3.4 Electrical anisotropy
Due to the anisotropy of the crystal structure, the electrical properties of Cs3Bi2I9 were also expected to be anisotropic. I–V measurements were taken based on both coplanar and sandwich electrode configurations, which are along the close packed direction [l00] and the normal direction of the layer structure [00l], respectively, as seen in Fig. 6. The carbon electrodes were deposited onto the surface of the crystal to ensure the ohmic contacts. The resistivity along the [l00] and [00l] directions is calculated to be 0.77 GΩ cm and 11.08 GΩ cm, which are close to that of the state of the art CdZnTe (ref. 34) crystals. Generally, the resistivity ρ can be calculated according to the formula (2)where n is the carrier density, q is the carrier charge, τ is the mean free time and m* is the effective mass of the carriers. The effective mass of carriers is calculated using the formula (3)where m* is the carrier effective mass, k is the crystal momentum vector, and E(k) is the band eigenvalues. Based on the calculated results, the effective masses of electrons and holes are 0.327me and 0.946me along the [l00] direction, respectively, where me is the mass of free electrons. Meanwhile, the effective masses of electrons and holes are 3.22me and 2.14me along the [00l] direction, respectively. The large variations of the effective mass along these two directions, which determined the carrier mobility, should be responsible for the anisotropy resistivity.

The photoresponse measurement along these two directions was further conducted at a bias of 10 V, as seen in Fig. 6(b), which was illuminated by a high-frequency LED with a wavelength of 420 nm and an intensity of ∼10 mW cm−2. The current signals rise and decline sharply without exponential decay when the LED is on and off, which reflects the fast response to optical light. The anisotropic on–off ratios are compared, with values of 24 and 1.6 for the [l00] and [00l] directions, respectively. The on–off ratio of ∼24 in [l00] is an order of magnitude higher than that of a previous study, which is illuminated using a 405 nm laser,13 with an even higher power density. Well, because of the layered structure, in some directions, [00l] for example, the photodetection performance is not as good as that in [l00], but the unique structure ensures a higher resistivity and lower dark current, which enable the device to work stably under a higher electric field. These results indicate further applications of Cs3Bi2I9 crystals as photodetectors.
4. Conclusions
Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals were grown using a low temperature solution method. In this method, Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals can be obtained at 50–60 °C. The crystal structure parameters were determined as the space group P63/mmc with cell parameters of a = 8.411 Å and c = 21.182 Å, by the powder XRD refinement. Three defect related PL peaks at 1.92 eV, 1.96 eV and 2.04 eV are identified in the 10 K PL spectra, which are associated with IBi, CsBi1−/2−, and CsI1+/2+, with dissociation energies of 47.87 meV, 45.28 meV, and 52.01 meV, respectively. A high resistivity on the order of 1010 Ω cm was obtained for the as-grown Cs3Bi2I9 crystals. The anisotropic resistivity and fast photoresponse in the [00l] and [l00] directions were revealed according to the coplanar and sandwich configuration devices, which indicate further uses of Cs3Bi2I9 in hard radiation detection.
