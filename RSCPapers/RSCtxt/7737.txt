    , Accepted 2nd August 2017First published on 2nd August 2017AbstractThe crystallization mechanism of sol–gel-derived NaYF4:(Yb,Er) up-converting phosphors has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry analysis using both model-free and model fitting approaches. Structural and optical data have shown that the hexagonal NaYF4:(Yb,Er) phase crystallization process occurs at around 315 °C as a result of the thermal decomposition of the metal trifluoroacetates. As the annealing temperature increases, sphere-like microcrystals of about 1–2 μm size (at 300 °C) break up into smaller ones (400–500 nm size) and finally collapse at higher temperatures (600 °C); the up-conversion luminescence signal intensity increases due to the crystallinity improvement and dehydration process. The crystallization process can be described as an autocatalytic-type reaction where the accompanying cubic NaYF4 phase played a catalytic role by reducing the energy barrier against the crystallization of the hexagonal NaYF4 phase, causing its fast self-accelerated crystallization. The energy resulting from the disintegration process of the initial NaYF4 microcrystals contributed to the growth and agglomeration processes and finally the collapse of the crystalline fragments with increasing temperature.
1. Introduction
Rare-earth-doped fluorides showing efficient up-conversion (UC) effects (i.e. near-infrared (NIR) conversion into the visible spectral range)1 are opening up new alternatives for a wide range of applications. Hexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride, NaYF4, has been the most efficient host material to date for green (Yb3+/Er3+) and blue (Yb3+/Tm3+) UC phosphors. Under high power laser excitation, an efficiency of around 50% has been reported for the conversion of NIR (about 1000 nm) to visible light in NaYF4:(Yb,Er).2 Various approaches have been reported for synthesizing NaYF4, such as the co-thermolysis of trifluoroacetates,3 thermal coprecipitation,4 hydro/solvothermal synthesis,5 colloidal route,6 liquid–solid solution method7 or mechanochemical synthesis.8
Among all the synthesis methods, the sol–gel process is known as a typical wet-chemical technique for synthesizing UC NPs with its advantages: lower processing temperature, the ability to control the purity and homogeneity of the final materials at a molecular level and its large compositional flexibility. Sol–gel-derived nanocrystals generally have broad particle size distribution (tens of nm) with irregular morphology, which are not appropriate for biological related applications.4 However, this method usually offers high luminescence intensity due to the high crystallinity caused by high annealing temperature and it is very well suited for “spin-coating” deposition of thin films in a waveguiding configuration for various photonic applications: planar optical waveguides,9 white LEDs,10 optical amplification11 and solar cell efficiency improvement.12 The annealing procedure (temperature and time) after/between subsequent depositions can seriously determine the quality (morphology and size distribution) of the thin films, which might have a great influence on their optical properties. Therefore, optimization for such thin film-related applications requires deep and proper knowledge of the crystallization mechanism involved.
Thermal analysis is recognized as one of the best methods for kinetic measurements and determination of the mechanism of various transformations in materials.13,14 The theory of crystallization in amorphous materials can be explained by considering the structure and the kinetics of crystallization. Therefore, the investigation of crystallization kinetics is important since it quantifies the effect of the nucleation and growth rate of the resulting crystallites.13 Several procedures have been proposed for determining the activation energy and the kinetic model from data obtained under increasing temperature conditions.15,16 Non-isothermal methods are further divided into two main categories for studying the reaction kinetics: (i) iso-conversional (model-free) methods17,18 and (ii) model-fitting methods.19,20 The model-free analysis allows the estimation of the kinetic parameters (the apparent activation energy and the pre-exponential factor) at progressive degrees of conversion for an independent model. On the other hand, fitting data to multi-step kinetic models allows the ‘true mechanism’ to be predicted for the simulated data. Such analysis was performed successfully for fluorides such as doped LiYF4:(Yb,Er) nanopowders21 and CaF2:Sm3+ nanocrystals embedded in a silica glassy matrix (glass-ceramic)22 or oxide glass ceramics.23
The aim of this paper is to investigate the structure–property relationship during the crystallization of an amorphous xerogel to a NaYF4:(Yb,Er) crystalline material with improved optical/up-conversion properties by correlation of the complex thermal investigation (differential scanning calorimetry, mass spectrometry and kinetic data analysis) with several other techniques: structural (XRD), morphological (SEM) and optical studies (FTIR and up-conversion).The kinetic parameters (activation energies and pre-exponential factors) were determined using the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) method and many other different kinetic models were used for model-fitting data analysis.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
For the synthesis of NaYF4 nanopowders doped with Yb (4%) and Er (1%), we have used a hybrid sol–gel/thermal decomposition route using metal acetates and trifluoroacetic acid as the in situ fluorinating reagent.21,24 Stoichiometric amounts of powder acetates (0.0104 g Er(CH3COO)3 (99.9% Alfa Aesar), 0.037 g Yb(CH3COO)3 (99.9% Alfa Aesar), 0.6317 g Y(CH3COO)3 (99.99% Alfa Aesar) and 0.205 g Na(CH3COO) (99.998% Alfa Aesar)) were mixed and then dissolved in a solution consisting of 4 mL isopropanol (99.5% min. Alfa Aesar) and 4 mL ethanol (99.8% Sigma Aldrich), with addition of 1 mL trifluoroacetic acid (99.5+% Alfa Aesar) and 1 mL water. The transparent sol was stirred for 2 h and then it was slowly evaporated at room temperature up to dryness. The as-prepared xerogel powder was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and kept in sealed vessels; the crystallization was achieved by calcination in oxygen flow for 1 h at different temperatures up to 600 °C.
2.2. Sample characterization
Thermal property analysis was performed using a SETARAM SETSYS Evolution 18 instrument in a TG-DSC thermal analysis mode, from room temperature up to 650 °C. Powder samples (∼15 mg) were loaded into an open cylindrical alumina crucible and then measured in synthetic air (80% N2/20% O2) with a 16 ml min−1 gas flow rate, at four different heating rates: 2, 7, 10 and 15 °C per minute, using an empty alumina crucible as reference. The accuracy of heat flow measurements was ±0.001 mW, and the temperature precision was ±0.1 K. The gases resulting from the thermal decomposition process have been monitored with a QMS 301 OMNISTAR PFEIFFER mass spectrometer coupled to the SETARAM device. For the processing of the non-isothermal data and comparison of the calculated and experimental curves corresponding to the crystallization process, a Netzsch Thermokinetics professional software module has been used.
The morphological characterization of the samples was carried out by using a Zeiss MERLIN Compact scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a GEMINI column. The chemical composition analysis of the samples was performed by using an EVO 50 XVP microscope from Zeiss equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray system (EDX, Quanta Bruker 200).
For the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples, we used a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE type X-ray diffractometer, in focusing geometry, equipped with a copper target X-ray tube and a LynxEye one-dimensional detector. In order to investigate the phase composition and crystallographic characteristics in a more quantitative way, the XRD patterns of the annealed powders were analyzed.
Photoluminescence and UC luminescence measurements were recorded at room temperature by using a FluoroMax 4P spectrophotometer and the spectra were corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the instrument. For the UC luminescence spectra, we used a laser diode centred at 980 nm (140 mW) focused to a spot size of about 1.5 mm diameter.
A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) (Model Spectrum BX, Perkin Elmer Instruments) was used for IR measurements. A mixture of the gel powder and KBr powder was pressed as pellets and used for infrared spectroscopy studies.
3. Non-isothermal kinetic analysis – theoretical background
3.1. Model-free methods
Model-free methods commence by using both rate and Arrhenius equations and are based on the assumption that the reaction model is independent of the temperature and heating rates.25,26 For non-isothermal conditions, the following equation is used: (1)where α is the conversion, T is the temperature, β is the heating rate, f(α) is the reaction model, A and E are the frequency factor and the activation energy, respectively, and R is the universal gas constant. The kinetic triplet (i.e. A, E and f(α)) is the typical outcome of the regular kinetic analysis and is needed to provide a mathematical description of the described process. The most popular methods are represented by the differential method of Friedman27 and by the integral methods proposed by Ozawa–Flynn–Wall.28,29 Under non-isothermal conditions, for a given extent of reaction, the analytical integration of eqn (1) can be expressed as eqn (2): (2)where (3)is the integral form of the model function.

Eqn (2) does not have an analytical solution and it can be solved either by numerical integration of approximations.30 One of the simplest approximations is given by eqn (4) belonging to the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall methods.31 (4)
Under the isoconversion assumption, the function g(α) reaches a given value and is thus a constant. Therefore, the plot of ln(β) versus 1000/T for a given value of the crystallization fraction is a straight line with the slope being . This is one of the methods that can determine the activation energy without knowledge of the reaction order.32
3.2. Model-fitting method
Several mathematical methods can be used to calculate the kinetics of the crystallization process. A model-fitting method is an approach that fits different reaction models f(α) or g(α) into the general kinetic equation (eqn (1)), and the values of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are calculated by regression analysis.33 Then, different groups of kinetic triplet values are used to fit the above equation, and the curves generated by the equation with the best fit to the actual experimental curves would be considered the appropriate one to be selected.34
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Structural and morphological characterization
The XRD patterns of the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) xerogel annealed at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the xerogel annealed up to 250 °C did not exhibit crystallization peaks (not shown here). However, after subsequent thermal treatments up to 600 °C, we have recognized the characteristic diffraction peaks of the hexagonal β-NaYF4 nanocrystalline phase (JCPDS 28-1192); smaller peaks of the cubic α-NaYF4 phase (JCPDS card no. 77-2042) have been observed after annealing at 300 °C but not for annealing at higher temperatures. The X-ray patterns were analyzed by using the Na1.5Y1.5F6 structure type with the P63/m space group35 and full pattern fitting (Pawley method) – the results are listed in Table 1. The analysis has shown that for annealing temperatures up to 400 °C, the lattice parameters are about the same and show relatively weak changes at higher temperatures. A deeper and critical discussion of the stoichiometry and crystal structure was given by Krämer et al.36

During the subsequent annealing, the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) xerogel experiences drastic morphological changes that are revealed by the SEM images depicted in Fig. 2. After annealing at 300 °C, the SEM images showed sphere-like microparticles of about 1–2 μm size. They are quite large because there are no additional capping reagents or surfactants needed to suppress the agglomeration of the NaYF4 nanoparticles (see the XRD pattern, Fig. 1) resulting from the metal trifluoroacetate decomposition process.3,37,38 However, after annealing at 400 °C, the thermal energy is able to break up the microparticles into smaller, irregularly shaped fragments of about 400–500 nm size. At even higher annealing temperatures (600 °C), they started to agglomerate and collapse, and we observed a sintered ceramic-like morphology most likely caused by a mass transfer between the neighboring microparticles. The crystallite sizes computed from the XRD patterns are smaller than the particle size (observed by SEM), indicating that the microparticles are made up of several smaller nanocrystallites.

Chemical composition analysis using the EDX spectra has shown good agreement between the concentrations in the precursor chemicals and those in the annealed xerogel samples: 61 at% (F), 20 at% (Na), 18 at% (Y), 0.7 at% (Yb) and 0.3 at% (Er).
4.2. Optical properties: FTIR and up-conversion luminescence
The FTIR spectra of the initial dried xerogel and those after annealing at 300 and 400 °C are presented in Fig. 3. As we expected, the spectrum of the xerogel is dominated by the absorption peaks related to the yttrium and sodium trifluoroacetates.38,39 After annealing at 300 °C, all the peaks disappeared due to decomposition of the trifluoroacetates, being replaced by a relatively broad peak at about 400 cm−1 assigned to the lattice vibrations of the NaYF4 crystalline phase.40
 Fig. 3  FTIR spectra of the dried NaYF4:(Yb,Er) xerogel and those after annealing. 
Under 980 nm laser light pumping, the annealed samples showed up-conversion green ((2H11/2, 4S3/2) → 4I15/2) and red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) luminescence due to the Er3+ ions (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Up-conversion luminescence spectra recorded for the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) xerogel annealed at the indicated temperatures; the inset shows the energy level schemes of Yb3+ and Er3+ and the main energy transfer processes involved in the UC mechanism. 
The UC luminescence mechanism for Yb3+/Er3+ systems has been extensively investigated in NaYF4 (ref. 3–6) and therefore we do not address it in detail here. The UC mechanism is based on a very efficient energy transfer between spatially separated Yb3+ and Er3+ ions; the absorption of infrared light photons by the Yb3+ ions (2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition) is followed by a two-step energy transfer process to neighboring Er3+ ions with their characteristic green ((2H11/2, 4S3/2) → 4I15/2) and red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) luminescent emissions (Fig. 4 inset).
The intensity of the UC spectra is about the same at annealing temperatures up to 400 °C and shows an increase of about several times at higher annealing temperatures up to 600 °C. As the annealing temperature increases, the crystallinity improvement is accompanied by a decrease of the hydroxyl ion concentration and reduction of the non-radiative relaxation rate, resulting in an increase of the luminescence signal.
4.3. Thermal property analysis
For deeper understanding of the thermally activated formation process of the optically active β-NaYF4 crystalline phase, a study of the crystallization kinetics and the mechanism involved is needed, which is carried out by analyzing the thermal properties of the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) xerogel. Fig. 5a depicts the TG/DSC curves recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, while Fig. 5b shows the DSC curves recorded at four different heating rates (2, 5, 7 and 10 °C min−1) – Table 2.

It can be seen that the TG-DSC curves (Fig. 5a) exhibit a two-phase weight loss. The first weight loss before 186 °C is ascribed to the loss of residual water and organic solvents; small exothermic and endothermic peaks were observed during this process. The exothermic peak at around 280 °C is accompanied by a large weight loss (Fig. 5), which was assigned to the decomposition of metal trifluoroacetate precursors as follows:37,38
Ln(CF3COO)3 → LnF3 + (CF3CO)2O + CO2 + CO with (Ln = Yb,Er)
A third exothermic peak centered around 315 °C corresponds to the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) phase crystallization process as shown by the X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 1).
The analysis of the gases resulting from the thermal decomposition has shown the peak intensities of mass fragments with m/z = 14, 18, 28, 32 and 44 (Fig. 6) in the 250 to 300 °C temperature range. They were assigned to the (–CH2–) radical fragments, H2O, CO, O2 and CO2 resulting from the thermal decomposition of trifluoroacetate precursors.3,36,37

Model-free thermokinetic analysis
The model-free estimation of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor has been performed by the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method (Fig. 7). Both kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) obtained from the analysis are represented in Fig. 8 as a function of partial area crystallization α.

 Fig. 8  Dependence of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor on the crystallization fraction according to the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method. 
The model-free analysis results (Fig. 8) reveal that both kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) exhibit a slow increase until α = 0.4 (E ≅ 219 kJ mol−1 and logA ≅ 17.48 s−1), followed by a decrease, as the crystallization fraction increases. This behavior might have occurred because of the autocatalytic effect in the crystallization process.21
The Ozawa method allowed obtaining the kinetic parameters specific to the crystallization process without taking into consideration any specific model. Model-fitting analysis is the method which conduct to the specific model of the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) crystallization, and in the next paragraph, this analysis is presented.
Model-fitting analysis
The dynamic DSC measurements were fitted with the reaction models (displayed in Table 3) by using multivariate least-squares regression41 (Thermokinetics program). The optimal model was selected on the basis of the discrepancies between the calculated and experimental values. The F-values which were computed using a statistical F-test method42 are normally used as an indication of the reaction model that best fits the experimental data. The F-test method compares the model variances against each other. The model with an F-value of 1 has the least deviation out of all the models compared. If the F-value of the second best-fit model is higher than the critical F-value at the 0.95 confidence interval, the model with an F-value of 1 is considered as the best-fit model.43

According to Table 3, the Prout–Tompkins autocatalytic model (Bna) provides the best description of the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) crystallization processes (Fig. 9). This kinetic model is based on the concept of “nucleus branching” analogous to the homogeneous chain reaction where the energy quanta released from the reaction are transferred to potential reactant species20 and it is characterized by the following equation:44 (5)

According to the results obtained by fitting the measurements to a reaction in one step, the crystallization process of the NaYF4:(Yb,Er) nanoparticles is quite similar to that of LiYF4:(Yb,Er) already reported21 and can be described as an autocatalytic type reaction, where the amorphous xerogel sample exhibits fast self-accelerated crystallization due to the simultaneous presence of two crystalline phases (NaYF4) right from the beginning of crystallization. These phases resulted from the thermal decomposition of the metal trifluoroacetates above 300 °C – see the FTIR and XRD measurements (Fig. 1 and 3). Thermal analysis measurements have indicated that the formation of the hexagonal NaYF4 phase is energetically more favorable than that of the cubic phase. According to the general autocatalytic-type reaction, the latter played a catalytic role by reducing the energy barrier against the crystallization of the hexagonal NaYF4 phase and caused its fast self-accelerated crystallization. By comparison, cubic-to-hexagonal transformation was observed by tuning of multiple parameters,45 during annealing at 400–600 °C (ref. 46) or depending on the rare-earth nature,47 but in the present case, the cubic NaYF4 phase itself caused the transformation. The analysis performed within the Prout–Tompkins autocatalytic model (Bna) has indicated that, at the beginning of crystallization, the NaYF4 microcrystalline particles of about 1–2 μm size are disintegrated generating a higher number of branching nuclei and the crystallization process is initiated on a larger surface. The energy resulting from the disintegration process contributed to the growth and agglomeration of the nuclei so that at the end of the crystallization process NaYF4:(Er,Yb) nanoparticles collapsed and their size started to increase with increasing temperature. This mechanism of crystallization is confirmed by the evolution of the particle morphology evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 2).
Conclusions
The crystallization process of NaYF4:(Er,Yb) microcrystals obtained by a sol–gel method was studied by differential scanning calorimetry analysis. According to the model-fitting approach, the hexagonal NaYF4:(Yb,Er) phase crystallization process resulted from the thermal decomposition of the metal trifluoroacetates and it be described as an autocatalytic type, where the accompanying cubic NaYF4 phase played a catalytic role causing its fast self-accelerated crystallization. The energy resulting from the disintegration process of the initial NaYF4 microcrystals contributed to the growth, agglomeration and collapse process of the crystalline fragments, which is consistent with the morphological changes evidenced by electron microscopy. The crystallization process is accompanied by an increase in intensity of the up-conversion luminescence signal due to the crystallinity improvement and dehydration process.
