    , Accepted 25th November 2013First published on 27th November 2013AbstractA series of 2,3,5-substituted thiophene-based metal-free dyes with two anchoring groups, D–π–(A)2 (DA), were synthesized for application in DSSCs. Different arylamines and 2-cyanoacrylic acid were used as the electron donor and the electron acceptor, respectively. The DSSC based on DA5 has the best power conversion efficiency (7.28%) among all devices, which is 2 times higher than that of S1 with only one anchoring group. With addition of a co-adsorbent, CDCA, the device performance of all the DA-based DSSCs are improved by 1.03 to 2-fold, with the best efficiency (7.87%) reaching 95% of that of the N719-based standard cell (8.28%). Compared with the S1 congener with only one anchor, the DA dyes can more effectively suppress charge recombination and increase electron injection efficiency, leading to higher open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current.
Introduction
Solar energy is very attractive among renewable energy resources due to its unlimited supply. Since the seminal report of O'Regan and Grätzel,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have shown great potential due to their high solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency and low cost of production. Prototype DSSCs are composed of a photoanode (such as crystalline TiO2 porous film), sensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode (such as platinum). To date, power conversion efficiencies (η) higher than 11% have been reported for ruthenium(II)-based DSSCs under AM 1.5 illumination.2 However, rarity, high cost and environmental concerns may limit extensive usage of Ru-based dyes. In addition to Ru-based dyes, dipolar donor–π conjugate spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) type metal-free sensitizers have also received intensive study3 as they possess several advantages: flexibility in tuning the molecular architecture, high molar extinction coefficients and low cost.
Improving the light harvesting ability of the dye is a prerequisite for better light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. This can normally be achieved by: (1) extending the π-conjugation to increase the molar extinction coefficient of the absorption band; (2) increasing the strength of the donor and acceptor to increase the absorption wavelength; (3) increasing the amount of dye anchored on the TiO2 surface. More effective electron injection from the photo-excited dye molecule and suppression of dark current should be also beneficial for high performance DSSCs.
In recent years there has been increasing interest in sensitizers possessing multiple anchors, as multi-binding sites may increase electron extraction channels and hence the photocurrent, and enhance binding stability.4 Dyes with a single donor and two acceptors/anchors (D–π–(A)2) frequently have higher photocurrent than their congeners with only a single acceptor/anchor (D–π–A) due to their better light harvesting, i.e., longer wavelength absorption and higher absorption intensity. However, a higher photovoltage is not guaranteed, as the extra protons released from the D–π–(A)2 molecules will lower the Fermi level of TiO2. For example, Abbotto,4a Hagfeldt,4b Wang4c and Kim4g reported that dyes with two accepting/anchoring groups had a lower photovoltage than the congener with only one anchoring group, due to inefficient dark current suppression and/or downward shift of the titania conduction band. Another interesting type of dye possesses two D–π–A segments in the same molecule.5 Non-conjugated and conjugated connectors were used by Cao5a and Ren,5b respectively, to link the two D–π–A segments. In both cases the dyes with two D–π–A segments were found to have better cell performance (conversion efficiency, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage) than those with a single D–π–A segment. It was found that the dye with two D–π–A segments had a significantly larger amount of the D–π–A segment adsorbed on TiO2 compared to the single D–π–A dye. Consequently, more compact packing of the dye molecules can more effectively suppress the dark current in addition to providing better light harvesting. This effect was not observed in double D–π–A sensitizers with a quinoxaline bridge,5c possibly due to the indeterminate D–A segment in the dye molecule.
Previously we found that dyes with two anchors for p-type DSSCs were more efficient than the congeners with a single anchor in hole injection and dark current suppression.6 We therefore set out to design dyes with two anchoring groups for n-type DSSCs using the same strategy in the hope of enhancing electron injection and dark current suppression. We developed two-donor type sensitizers incorporating a 2,3,5-substituted thiophene motif in the spacer for the integration of two arylamine donors at the 2- and 3-sites of the thiophene ring.7 The presence of two donors was found to be beneficial for dark current suppression. By inverting the synthetic sequence, the integration of two acceptors/anchors at the 2- and 3-sites of the thiophene ring should be possible. As mentioned above, molecules of the type may exhibit a high molar extinction coefficient and good power conversion efficiency. Herein, we report the preparation of Y-shaped D–π–(A)2 dyes constructed from a 2,3,5-substituted thiophene motif, and the DSSCs based on these new sensitizers.
Experimental
Materials and instrumentation
All solvents used were purified by standard procedures, or purged with nitrogen before use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 and AMX-400 spectrometer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Dynamica DB-20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60 M, 230–400 mesh). Mass spectra (FAB) were recorded on a VG70-250S mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer.
Cell fabrication of DSSCs
For the DSSCs, the TiO2 film consisted of a transparent layer and a scattering layer with thicknesses of 15 and 5 μm, respectively, as measured by a profilometer (Dektak3, Veeco/Sloan Instruments Inc., USA). The TiO2 electrode with a 0.16 cm2 geometric area was immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M organic sensitizer, or in an acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1 by vol.) solution containing cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) (3 × 10−4 M) for 16 h. For the co-adsorbed solar cells, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was added into the dye solutions at a concentration of 10 mM. A platinized FTO was used as a counter electrode and was controlled to have an active area of 0.16 cm2 by adhered polyester tape with a thickness of 60 μm. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN). The photoelectrochemical characterizations of the solar cells were carried out using an Oriel Class A solar simulator (Oriel 91195A, Newport Corp.).
Characterization of DSSCs
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (CHI650B, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) at a light intensity of 1.0 sun calibrated using an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150, Newport Corp.). Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC–L11, AM 1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell and measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Quantum chemistry computations
The structures of the molecules were optimized using B3LYP/6-31G*. The hexyloxy (–OC6H13) groups in dyes DA4 and DA5 were replaced with methoxy (–OCH3) groups in order to save computational efforts. For each molecule, a number of possible conformations were examined and the one with the lowest energy was used. For the excited state, we employed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional. All calculations were performed with Q-Chem 4.0 software.8 There are a number of previous works that employed TDDFT to characterize excited states with charge-transfer character.9 In some cases underestimation of the excitation energies was observed.9,10 Therefore, in the present work, we used TDDFT to characterize the extent of the charge-shift and avoid drawing conclusions from the excitation energies.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the materials
The new dianchor-based (DA1–DA5) organic dyes are shown in Fig. 1, and the main synthetic pathways are depicted in Scheme 1. Compounds S1 and 2,3-dibromothiophene were prepared according to the published procedures7 palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction11 of 2,3-dibromothiophene with two equivalents of stannylated arylalehyde protected by derivatization as dioxolan. After bromination by NBS, the intermediate (5′-bromo-[2,2′:3′,2′′-terthiophene]-5,5′′-dicarbaldehyde or 3-(5-bromo-2-(4-formylphenyl)thiophen-3-yl)benzaldehyde) was subjected to palladium catalyzed Stille coupling with the appropriate stannyl derivatives of arylamine to form DA1a–DA5a. The final products were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of DA1–DA5 with cyanoacetic acid. The new organic dyes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses, and mass spectrometry.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the DA dyes recorded in THF have one or two major absorption bands in the range of 360–550 nm (Fig. 2a). The band below 400 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated molecules, and that in the longer wavelength region (480–600 nm) is ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) with π–π* transition character. The λabs values of the ICT band in THF decrease in the order DA5 (482 nm) > DA2 (478 nm) > S1 (474 nm) > DA1 (472 nm) > DA4 (462 nm) > DA3 (451 nm). Similar to our previous observations on 2,3-diarylamine-substituted thiophene-based dyes,7DA dyes exhibit higher molar absorption coefficients for the band below 400 nm compared to S1, which can be attributed to their more complex structure resulting in more π–π* transitions. Though S1 has a more planar structure compared to DA2 (vide infra), the added acceptor in DA2 is beneficial for a red shift of the absorption spectrum. Consequently, the ICT bands of the two dyes have nearly the same absorption maximum. The ICT band of DA1 is blue-shifted compared to that of DA2, as the latter has one more thiophene ring in the conjugated spacer. The ICT bands in DA3 and DA4 have the shortest wavelengths of all, which can be rationalized by the significant twist of the two phenyl rings from planarity with the neighboring thiophene ring (vide infra, see computation). The blue shift of the absorption spectra of the dyes on TiO2 (Fig. 2b) is attributed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.6b Extension of the spectra beyond 600 nm implies the existence of J-aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. The trend of the emission band in these dyes is in parallel with that of the absorption spectra.

Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes are shown in Fig. S1† and the relevant electrochemical data are presented in Table 1. All of the dyes exhibit one or more quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The first reversible wave is attributed to the oxidation of arylamine, and decreases in the order DA1 > DA5 > DA3 ≈ DA2 > DA4. Compound with a stronger donor (DA4) is oxidized at a lower potential. Increasing the number of electron rich thiophene rings also lowers the oxidation potential of arylamine. The excited state potential (E*0–0) of the sensitizer was estimated from the difference between the first oxidation potential and the zero–zero excitation energy, where the zero–zero excitation energy was estimated from the absorption onset. The more negative excited state oxidation potential of the DA dyes (E*0–0, −0.97 to −1.58 V vs. NHE) than the conduction-band-edge level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE),3a ensures electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The first oxidation potential of the dyes is more positive than that of I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that regeneration of the dyes (0.97 to 1.24 V vs. NHE) is energetically favorable.

Theoretical approach
Density functional (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level using Q-Chem 4.0 software were carried out on the new dyes. According to ground-state optimized structure, the largest intramolecular dihedral angle in each dye comes from the 2,3,5-substituted thiophene and its adjacent anchor-substituted aromatics (Fig. S2†). The angle ranges between 35.4° and 39.4° in DA1, DA2 and DA5, while that in DA3 and DA4 ranges between 37.5° and 45.2°, indicating the somewhat larger steric congestion between the 2- and 3-substituents in DA3 and DA4. The dihedral angles in DA dyes are significantly larger than that between two neighboring thiophene rings in S1, ranging from 3.5 to 12.4°. Selected frontier orbitals of the dyes are shown in Fig. 3 and S3.† The HOMO and HOMO − 1 in these compounds are mainly distributed from the arylamine to the adjacent thiophene moiety, with HOMO − 1 possessing more population on one arm of the branched spacer. The LUMO and LUMO + 1 are largely distributed from two 2-cyanoacrylic acid peripherals extending to the 2,3-substituted thiophene ring. Time-dependent DFT calculations of the dyes were also carried out, and the results are listed in Table S1.† The two lowest-energy transitions (S0 → S1 and S0 → S2) for all compounds are ∼100% HOMO → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 1 transitions, respectively. These are ascribed to predominately charge transfer transitions. In comparison, compound S1 has only one charge transfer transition with somewhat higher energy, i.e., the S0 → S1 (HOMO → LUMO) transition. The changes in Mulliken charge after vertical excitation from the ground states of the dyes (Fig. S4†) were also calculated to estimate the extent of charge separation upon excitation. The dye molecule, grouped into several segments including arylamine (Am), thiophene (T1, T2), phenylene (T, T′) and acceptor (Ac, Ac'), shows significant accommodation of negative charges at both acceptors for both S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 transitions. Consequently, electron injection from the DA dye molecule to TiO2 is expected to be favored compared to S1, as the former has one more electron injection channel than the latter. Indeed, all DA dyes except for DA4 have better electron transport behavior than S1 based on the electrochemical impedance measurements (vide infra). Severe deviation of the conjugation segment from planarity may hamper electron injection in DA4.

Photovoltaic devices
The cell performance data under AM 1.5 illumination are collected in Table 2. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the cells are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The conversion efficiencies (η) of the DSSCs range from 2.60% to 7.28%, with the best efficiency (DA5) reaching 88% of that of an N719-based standard cell (8.28%) fabricated and measured under similar conditions. The presence of two anchors leads to greater steric congestion of the dye molecules, resulting in slightly lower dye loading on TiO2 than S1 (Table 2). However, all the dyes except DA4 still exhibit better cell performance than S1 because they have better light harvesting, electron injection efficiency (vide infra) and dark current suppression (vide infra). It is noteworthy that the cells exhibit higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) than that based on the dye with a single anchor, S1, which is very different from many other D–π–(A)2 dyes reported in the literature.4 Apparently the Th(Ar-A)2 (Th = thiophene; Ar = phenyl or thienyl; A = 2-cyanoacrylic acid) stand is ideal for coverage of the TiO2 surface from contact with the electrolyte and effectively reduces the dark current (vide infra). The significant downward shift of the conduction-band edge of TiO2 is another cause of the low VOC for the S1-based cell (vide infra, see charge extraction). Though the two electron-donating alkoxy substituents render DA4 with better light harvesting than DA3, DA4 still has the lowest cell efficiency among all cells due to several factors: (1) steric congestion due to the long alkoxy chains significantly reduces the dye loading;12 (2) more void space due to lower dye loading results in larger dark current; (3) larger twist angle between the two phenyl rings and the neighboring thiophene ring leads to less efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2 (vide infra). Similar to DA4, DA3 also has two phenyl rings connected with the thiophene ring, leading to less efficient electron injection as evidenced from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy taken under illumination (vide infra). However, DA3 exhibited the highest VOC among all cells. Possibly the larger twist angle between the anchor-containing phenyl rings and the neighboring thiophene ring is beneficial for dark current suppression (vide infra). DA2 also exhibits effective dark current suppression, as its higher dye loading (Table 2) leaves less void space for electrolyte penetration (Fig. 4a and 5a). The highest cell efficiency of DA5 can be attributed to several factors: (1) the absorption of DA5 is intense and has good coverage of the solar spectrum, both in the solution and on the TiO2 film; (2) DA5 has the highest dye loading; (3) efficient electron injection; (4) efficient dark current suppression.

 Fig. 5  (a) Electrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) of DSSC for the dyes measured in the dark. (b) Electrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) of DSSCs based on the dyes measured under (AM 1.5) illumination. 
The dark current and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs in the dark are shown in Fig. 4a and 5a, respectively. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, i.e., the dark current.3a The resistance towards the dark current (the size of the semicircle) decreases in the order DA3 > DA2 > DA5 > DA1 > S1 > DA4, which is consistent with the dark current (Fig. 4a) and the observed VOC values (Table 2). Obviously, dyes with two anchors can more effectively protect the TiO2 surface from contact with the electrolyte than the dye with a single anchor (S1), except for the dye (DA4) which has less dye loading due to steric congestion among the molecules. Dyes with Th(Ar-A)2 moieties, where Ar is the phenyl entity, have larger twist angles between the phenyl and the thiophene rings and may more efficiently block the penetration of the electrolytes through the dye forest, similar to previous reports in the literature.13 Electrochemical impedance upon illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was also measured under open-circuit conditions, and the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with different dyes are shown in Fig. 5b. The radius of the intermediate frequency semicircle (10−2–105 Hz) in the Nyquist plot will reflect electron transport resistance, and a smaller radius means a smaller electron transport resistance.3a The electron transport resistance decreases in the order DA4 > S1 > DA3 > DA1 > DA2 ≈ DA5. Among the DA dyes, the Th(Ph-A)2 type molecules (DA3 or DA4) with a larger twist angle between the phenyl ring and the 2,3-substituted thiophene ring jeopardize the electron injection efficiency. In comparison, Th(Th-A)2 type molecules have better electron injection than S1. This is similar to our previous observation on p-type DSSCs,6 that is, dyes with two anchors have more efficient hole injection than those with a single anchor.
It is noteworthy that DA2 has significantly improved electron transport and dark current suppression efficiencies compared with its congener with a single anchor, S1. This points to the importance of the incorporation of the second anchor.
CEM and IMVS characterization
The VOC value is determined by the position of the edge of the conduction band (ECB) and electron density in the TiO2 film.14 The relative conduction band shift of TiO2 was estimated by means of the charge extraction method (CEM), as shown in Fig. 6a. DA4 and S1 exhibited significantly lower dn (electron density) values when at the same VOC. This indicates that there is a significant upward shift of the conduction-band edge of TiO2 for the two dyes. It is conceivable that dyes with two anchors can release more protons upon adsorption, which will lower the ECB.15 The smaller effect in DA4 may be due to its much lower dye loading.
 Fig. 6  (a) VOC as a function of electron density for DSSCs sensitized with DA dyes. (b) Electron lifetime as a function of VOC for DSSCs sensitized with DA dyes. 
With the view that VOC is also influenced by the electron recombination lifetime, the electron lifetime was derived as a function of VOC by using intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), as shown in Fig. 6b. The longer electron lifetimes of DA dyes than that of S1 except for DA4 provide strong evidence that dyes with two anchoring groups can more effectively block the electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface. The trend is also consistent with the VOC and EIS data in the dark. The incompetence of DA4 in suppressing dark current may be attributed to its lower dye density. The significantly longer lifetime of DA3 than that of DA2 is possibly due to the larger twist angle between the 2,3-substituted thiophene with the neighboring aryl entity containing the anchor (Ar = phenyl for DA3; Ar = thienyl for DA2), which hampers diffusion of the electrolyte toward the TiO2. This phenomenon has been reported in several phenyl vs. thienyl sensitizers.16 The possibility of slower recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized DA3 molecules cannot be completely ruled out, however.16d
Co-adsorbed DSSCs
The co-adsorbent approach has been widely used for improving the cell efficiency by anti-aggregation of the dye molecules and/or dark current suppression.17 As aggregation of DA dyes on TiO2 surface was noticed (vide supra), the use of CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid)18 as the co-adsorbent was tested. Blue shift of the absorption spectra of DA dyes on the TiO2 film was observed upon addition of CDCA (Fig. 7), indicating that the aggregation of DA dyes had been eased. Cell performance parameters measured with the co-adsorbent are shown in Table 3, and the corresponding J–V curves and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. In general, the conversion efficiency was increased for all dyes upon addition of 10 mM CDCA. The percentage increments in VOC, JSC and η vary among different dyes (Fig. S5†), with the largest improvement found in DA4: 11%, 63% and 96% for VOC, JSC and η, respectively. As CDCA has an adverse effect on dye density, the increment of JSC provides further support of dye aggregation suppression by CDCA. As mentioned above, the Y-shaped DA dyes in our study can more effectively suppress dark current compared to the linear S1 dye. In the case of DA4, the two hexyloxy chains significantly reduce the dye loading (vide supra) and create more un-adsorbed TiO2 sites. The added CDCA molecules help to occupy these exposed TiO2 sites and avoid close contact of the TiO2 surface with the oxidized electrolytes. Among all dyes, DA2 exhibited the highest cell performance (η, 7.87%; JSC, 17.59 mA cm−2; VOC, 0.65 V; FF = 0.68) with added CDCA, and the efficiency reached 95% of that of the N719-based standard cell.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized 2,3,5-substituted thiophene-based metal-free organic sensitizers containing two anchoring groups. These dyes exhibit better electron injection and dark current suppression efficiencies than their congener with only one anchor. DSSCs using these sensitizers exhibited efficiencies of 2.60–7.28% under AM 1.5 illumination, while the N719-based standard cell fabricated and measured under similar conditions had an efficiency of 8.28%. Upon adding CDCA as a co-adsorbent, the best cell performance (7.82%) reached ∼95% of that of the N719-based standard cell.
