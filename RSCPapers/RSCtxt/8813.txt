Consequently, benzodifurandione-based polyphenylene vinylene (BDPPV) polymers also possess low LUMO values of less than −4.0 eV and have been reported to show good thermoelectric performances. However, all n-doping of BDPPV polymers have been insofar restricted to hydride-donors. Using tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) as a control, we found out that the lack of suitable electron-donors for BDPPV polymers is due to the strong tendency of over-doping, as a result of their very low LUMO values that promotes very rapid electron transfer and near room-temperature alkyl side chain melting that facilitates dopant infiltration. Here, we demonstrate well-controlled n-doping of a highly electron-deficient chlorinated BDPPV polymer (Cl-BDPPV, LUMO = −4.3 eV) using an electron-donor benzyl viologen radical cation (BV˙+). Unlike other electron-donors like N,N′-dimethylbenzimidazoline dimers, BV˙+ can be easily prepared using easily accessible reagents and shows excellent stability under a N2 atmosphere. The BV˙+-doped films were fully characterized and their thermoelectric performances were evaluated. A maximum σ and PF of 0.16 ± 0.01 S cm−1 and 0.43 ± 0.01 μW m−1 K−2 were obtained, respectively. Our results indicate that BV˙+ is a suitable electron-donor n-dopant candidate for highly electron-deficient n-type conjugated polymers.
Introduction
Recent groundbreaking development of n-type conjugated polymer thermoelectrics has garnered much interest in the conjugated polymer research community.1–16 This rapid development is driven by the discovery of new and highly electron deficient acceptor cores2,4,6–9,12,13,15,17–21 and side-chain engineering3,7,14,22 for n-type conjugated polymers, as well as new highly effective n-dopants.10,23–28 Among the new highly electron deficient acceptor cores, benzodifurandione-based oligophenylene vinylene (BDOPV) cores are in the center of attention due to their superior electron mobilities, as well as their low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of their polymers (BDPPV).12,17–19,22,29–33 These qualities arise from multi-fused electron-withdrawing aryl amides/esters, bridged by rigid exocyclic double bonds and conformation-locked via pseudo-hydrogen-bonding. Halogenated BDPPV polymers have shown superior electrical conductivities (σ) and power factors (PF) to their non-halogenated BDPPV counterparts when n-doped with the commercially available hydride-donor (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI) due to further backbone rigidification via conformation locking at the ethylene group (F-BDPPV: σmax = 14 S cm−1, PFmax = 25.5 μW m−1 K−2. Cl-BDPPV: σmax = 5 S cm−1, PFmax = 16.5 μW m−1 K−2, BDPPV: σmax = 0.26 S cm−1, PFmax = 1.6 μW m−1 K−2).4 Such backbone rigidification of conjugated polymers is known to reduce energy disorder and thus enhance charge transport.34,35
Despite the rapid development of conjugated polymer based thermoelectrics, the progress of n-dopants is rather insubstantial, with the top-performing n-doped conjugated polymer systems dominated by the use of hydride-donor N-DMBI (Fig. 1).4,7–9,14,15,36 While high (intrinsic) thermoelectric parameters have been demonstrated by N-DMBI for several n-type conjugated polymers,4,7–9,36,37 whether hydride-donors could improve the actual device performance remains to be verified. In particular, issues of hydride-reduced species and significant contact resistance have not been satisfactorily addressed. For instance, it has been reported that N-DMBI-doped tetracyano-diketopyrrolopyrrole organic semiconductors revealed clear signatures of Fermi level pinning by an impurity band.38 Moreover, n-doping of conjugated polymers using N-DMBI often requires very high annealing temperatures and long annealing times (typically with temperatures much higher than 100 °C for two hours or more)4,7–9,12,14,15,36,37,39 to activate the doping process,40,41 making it incompatible for n-doping of the electron-transport layer of organic photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes.

Because of the possibility of unwanted impurities arising from n-doping using hydride-donors,42 as well as the incompatible processing, much effort has been directed towards new electron-donor n-dopants. Notable examples are 19-electron organometallic sandwich compounds25,43 and N,N′-dimethylbenzimidazoline dimers.24,25,44 While the use of these new electron-donor n-dopants has attained reasonable success in the area of n-doped conjugated polymers, the syntheses of these n-dopants are non-trivial, often involving a large amount of hazardous Na–Hg alloy that limits scalability.24,25 n-Doping of conjugated polymers via exposing their thin films to the vapor of traditional electron-donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) has also been reported to be unstable even in a N2 environment due to its high volatility,26,45 making it difficult for reliable device measurements. Interestingly, despite the availability of many electron-donors, we are unaware of any reports on direct electron donor-doped BDOPV core-based polymers since their debut in 2013.17
We have recently reported that benzyl viologen radical cation (BV˙+) is an effective electron-donor n-dopant for several n-type conjugated polymers and can be easily prepared using commercially available benzyl viologen dichloride and zinc dust in acetonitrile.26–28 Unlike TDAE, BV˙+-doped polymers have displayed excellent electrical stability under a N2 environment. Also, we achieved the highest record σ for BV˙+-doped poly(naphthalenediimide-bithiophene) (pNDI-2T) and the highest record PF for BV˙+-doped poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL).26,28 Here, we demonstrate for the first time electron-doping of a BDOPV core-based polymer, Cl-BDPPV (Fig. 1). We found that the very low LUMO energy levels of Cl-BDPPV (∼−4.3 eV) and its near room-temperature alkyl side chain melting promote rapid n-doping of its thin films. The BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films were fully characterized and their thermoelectric performances were evaluated.
Results and discussion
The onset of the reduction of Cl-BDPPV films in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in anhydrous acetonitrile was determined to be −0.49 V vs. Fc+/Fc from cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1, ESI†). Its LUMO level was calculated to be −4.31 eV, consistent with reported values.4,11 Previously, we determined the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) level of BV˙+ in anhydrous acetonitrile to be −3.65 eV. Electron transfer from BV˙+ to Cl-BDPPV is expected to be highly spontaneous due to the large difference between the SOMO and LUMO levels, and this was confirmed by the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the doped films (Fig. 2b). Notably, the spin-coated films of Cl-BDPPV (20 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1000 rpm) were only about 20 nm thick, despite our numerous attempts to increase the film thickness while maintaining film uniformity (by increasing concentration, changing solvent, etc.). The sequential-solution doping method used here is highly dependent on the film thickness and dopant concentration since the process is diffusion-limited.26,46 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed a melting temperature of 20 °C for Cl-BDPPV, characteristic of polymers with such super long alkyl side chains (Fig. S2, ESI†).17,18 This, together with the very small film thickness and the very low LUMO energy levels, promotes extremely rapid n-doping. Initial doping attempts utilizing our standard 5 mM BV˙+ solution in anhydrous acetonitrile reported for other n-type polymers26–28 resulted in over-doping (based on electrical measurements) within one second. The same result was also observed when Cl-BDPPV films were exposed to TDAE vapor for one second. Evolution of the UV-Vis-NIR spectra of TDAE-doped Cl-BDPPV films indicated extremely rapid doping (Fig. 2b). To prevent over-doping, the Cl-BDPPV films were n-doped by immersing in a more dilute 2.5 mM BV˙+ solution for different immersion times and annealed at 50 °C for 10 min in the glovebox (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm). By following the changes in the UV-Vis-NIR absorption (Fig. 2a), we observed rapid doping even for 1 s immersion. This is based on the formation of polaron absorptions centered at around 1000 nm and 3100 nm, as shown in Fig. 2a, as well as bleaching of the neutral state absorption centered at around 785 nm. A polaron absorption greater than 3100 nm (or smaller than 0.4 eV) indicates a well-delocalized polaron,46–49 and this is consistent with the well-delocalized LUMO calculated for a trimer of Cl-BDPPV using density functional theory (DFT) (Fig. S13, ESI†). Furthermore, the BV˙+-doped films also showed the formation of a new absorption peak centered at 400 nm and the intensity of this peak increases with increasing immersion times. This peak was not observed in N-DMBI-doped Cl-BDPPV films4 and corresponded to the characteristic BV˙+ absorption at 400 nm, indicating the presence of BV˙+ species in the doped films.

To understand the chemical environment of the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films, we also performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 3). XPS binding energy measurements of the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film (immersion time 7 s) revealed lower binding energies for N1s (0.24 eV) and Cl2p (0.18 eV) as compared to the pristine film. A new and weak N1s peak belonging to BV2+ was also observed in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film. The integrated area ratio of the polymer amide N1s peak to this BV2+ N1s peak was found to be approximately 5:2, suggesting that there are about two BV2+ molecules to five polymer repeating units in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film. Based on the UV-Vis-NIR studies, we believe the observation of BV2+ species instead of BV˙+ species is due to the unavoidable air exposure during loading of the very thin film samples (∼20 nm) for XPS measurements. More importantly, no ionic chloride species (Cl2p3/2 centered at around 198 eV)27 was observed in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film. Although XPS is a surface sensitive technique with a typical depth analysis of up to 10 nm, this represents almost 50% of the polymer film thickness. The presence of BV N1s species with a lack of ionic chloride species suggests that the diffusion of BV˙+ into Cl-BDPPV films is redox-mediated, i.e., oxidized BV˙+ (BV2+) was reduced back to BV˙+ by other BV˙+ before diffusing deeper into the Cl-BDPPV film.

XRD was performed to understand the changes in film structure before and after doping with BV˙+ (Fig. 4). The XRD measurements were performed on drop-casted films as the spin-coated films were too thin. The pristine film showed a textured lamellar stacking peak (100) at around 2.7° 2θ value in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to a d-spacing of around 32 Å. The textured lamellar stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction suggests Cl-BDPPV has a preferred edge-on orientation on the SiO2 surface. Both the d-spacing and the preferred edge-on orientation are consistent with what was observed by Pei and co-workers for other BDPPV polymers.18 No second order (h00) diffraction peak could be observed, suggesting low lamellar crystallinity. Despite this, several weaker peaks were observed. In order to index these peaks, we modelled two possible stacking modes for Cl-BDPPV, namely the segregated and mixed stacking modes (Fig. 5a–d). Both segregated and mixed stacking modes have been well-documented for the high-mobility poly(naphthalenediimide-bithiophene).50,51 In the segregated stacking mode (Fig. 5a and c), the BDOPV cores in blue and ethylene spacers in red form segregated columns. In such a configuration, the meridional reflection (001) will correspond to the length of one repeating unit of Cl-BDPPV while the π–π stacking reflection (010) will correspond to the distance between two polymer chains. In the mixed stacking mode (Fig. 5b and d), the BDOPV cores and ethylene spacers stack on top of one another alternately. In this configuration, its meridional reflection (001)′ is approximately half of the length of one repeating unit (i.e., half of (001)) while its π–π stacking reflection (010)′ is approximately the distance between three polymer chains (i.e., double of (010)). Accordingly, we assigned the peak at around 23° 2θ value to be the (010) peak while the peaks at around 13° and 25° 2θ values to be the (010)′ and (020)′ peaks, respectively. Using DFT calculations, the length of one repeating unit of Cl-BDPPV is found to be 18.8 Å and this pleasantly matched the (001) peak at around 5° 2θ value. Accordingly, the peak at around 10° 2θ value was assigned as the (001)′ peak.

(e) Schematic of a dimer of Cl-BDPPV with 3 repeating units used for DFT calculation of the energy landscape profile. Energy landscape profile of the dimer of Cl-BDPPV with 3 repeating units with a π–π stacking distance of (f) 3.5 Å and (g) 3.8 Å. The scales for the axes in (f) and (g) are kept the same for comparison. 
DFT calculations on the energy landscape profile of a dimer of Cl-BDPPV with 3 repeating units with respect to the a- and c-axis displacements, at different π–π stacking (b-axis) distances (Fig. 5e–g) were performed to support the different stacking modes for Cl-BDPPV. Based on the XRD results, π–π stacking distances of 3.5 and 3.8 Å between the dimer were used. The displacement in the a-axis was set from 0 to ±3 Å since larger values will result in no π–π stacking. The displacement in the c-axis was set from 0 to 15 since the length of each repeating unit is 18.8 Å. At both π–π stacking distances, the global minimum for the dimer appears to be the lowest when the c-axis displacement is 10 Å. This is approximately half the length of a repeating unit (9.4 Å) and corresponds to the mixed stacking mode. On the other hand, segregated stacking (c-axis displacement = 0 Å) appears to be higher in energy for both π–π stacking distances, due to the steric effect of the methyl groups. Nonetheless, a slight offset in the segregated stacking (c-axis displacement = 5 Å) significantly lowers the total energy, and this is commonly observed in molecular π-systems. Taking into consideration the calculated energy landscape and the additional stabilization energy that will be bestowed to the polymer from the alkyl interactions (which was omitted in the calculation) in the segregated stacking mode, we believe that both segregated (with a slight offset) and mixed stacking modes exist in Cl-BDPPV.
The XRD spectra of both pristine and BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films were recorded using Bruker AXS Topas (v3) software and a summary of the indexed peaks and their spacing distances is tabulated in Table 1. Based on the fittings, the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film showed a slight increase from 31.7 to 32.7 Å in lamellar stacking (100) distance, probably due to the accommodation of BV˙+ molecules. A slight increase in both segregated (001) and mixed (001)′ meridional reflection distances were observed due to the additional electron(s) occupying the antibonding LUMO orbital upon n-doping. Slightly bigger π–π stacking (010) and (010)′ distances were also observed, probably due to electronic repulsion upon gaining additional charge(s). A clear increase in lamellar (100) crystallinity and a suppressed (001)′ peak was observed in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film. This increase in lamellar crystallinity was also observed for predominantly amorphous poly(perylenediimide-bithiophene) when doped with BV˙+.27 The suppression of the (001)′ peak but not the (001) peak and the prevalence of the (010)′ peak and (020)′ shoulder suggest that the mixed stacking mode in the edge-on configuration was converted to the segregated stacking mode. A possible explanation for this is that in the mixed stacking mode, Cl-BDPPV is unable to accommodate the BV˙+ molecules due to the smaller spacing between the alkyl side groups from adjacent polymer chains. In order to accommodate the BV˙+ molecules, the Cl-BDPPV polymer chains in the mixed stacking mode shift in the meridional direction during the doping process (immersion in dopant solution and/or annealing), resulting in the conversion to the segregated stacking mode. This conversion process is likely to be aided by the low melting temperature of the alkyl side groups observed in BDPPV polymers.17,18 On the contrary, TDAE-doped Cl-BDPPV (7 s) showed the disappearance of most of the peaks except the (100) and alkyl interaction peaks (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†), indicating a much stronger infiltration/doping ability of TDAE as compared to BV˙+. The much stronger infiltration/doping ability of TDAE is likely to be a consequence of its non-polar nature, which is similar to the long alkyl chains in Cl-BDPPV, as compared to the charged BV˙+.

To confirm the n-doping of Cl-BDPPV by BV˙+, we measured the σ and S of the BV˙+-doped spin-coated films (Fig. 6a). σ measured using the two- and four-probe method resulted in similar values, indicating minimum contact resistance in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films. Minimum contact resistance was also verified using the transmission line method (Fig. S9, ESI†). With just 1 s immersion, σ reached 0.042 ± 0.001 S cm−1 with an S of −300 ± 3 μV K−1. The negative S confirms the n-type thermoelectric character of the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films. With longer immersion time, σ increased, reached a maximum of 0.16 ± 0.01 S cm−1 for the 7 s immersion and decreased for the 10 s immersion while S generally decreased with a longer immersion time. The electrical conductivities of the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films for 7 s immersion were found to be stable for 2 weeks at room temperature in the glovebox environment (O2 and H2O ≤ 1 ppm) (Fig. S11, ESI†). We also over-doped the Cl-BDPPV films by immersing them in the BV˙+ solution for 30 min and found σ to be 0.071 ± 0.01 S cm−1. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the over-doped film showed a significant decrease in the polaron absorption at 3100 nm and resembled more like those of TDAE-doped films at 1 s vapor exposure time (Fig. S4, ESI†). In comparison, TDAE-doped Cl-BDPPV films only gave 10−3 S cm−1 regardless of the vapor exposure time (Fig. S10, ESI†), in agreement with the over-doped scenario. The PF also peaked at 7 s immersion, with a value of 0.43 ± 0.01 μW m−1 K−2. While our measured PF of BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV was far lower than the hydride-doped Cl-BDPPV using N-DMBI (16.5 μW m−1 K−2),4 our results represent the first electron n-doped example for Cl-BDPPV. Our results are also comparable with fluoride-doped Cl-BDPPV.11 We also performed the temperature-dependent σ measurements to determine its activation energy. The σ of the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film (7 s immersion) increased linearly with increasing temperature and an activation energy of 0.11 eV was determined from the linear fit of its Arrhenius plot (Fig. 6b). This activation energy for σ is significantly lower than that of BV˙+-doped pNDI-2T (0.27 eV) with a twisted polymer backbone,26 suggesting much better electron transport in the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV due to its conformation-locked planar polymer backbone and is in agreement with the well-delocalized n-polaron observed in UV-Vis-NIR absorption. However, the activation energy for σ of BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV is still larger than that of BV˙+-doped BBL (0.08 eV), due to the highly rigid and crystalline nature of the ladder-type BBL polymer.28

Doping efficiency is defined as the ratio of free charge carriers (electrons/holes) to donor/acceptor dopant. To determine the number of free charge carriers per cubic centimeter in the BV˙+-doped CL-BDPPV film (7 s), we use the formula σ = eημ where σ is the conductivity, e is the elementary charge, η is the free carrier density and μ is the charge mobility. A field-effect electron mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Cl-BDPPV was reported by Pei et. al.4 Since there is no significant difference in the polymer morphology before and after BV˙+-doping based on the XRD measurements, we assume the electron mobility to be the same after doping. The free electron carrier density for the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV film (7 s) was estimated to be 2 × 1018 cm3. Assuming a density of 1 g cm−3 for Cl-BDPPV after doping and using the area ratio of 0.40 for the N1s peaks (BV:Cl-BDPPV) from the XPS measurements, the dopant density for the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films (7 s) was calculated to be 1.38 × 1020 cm3. Hence, the doping efficiency for the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV films (7 s) was estimated to be 1.5%. This value is comparable with that of solution-mixing N-DMBI-doped pNDI-2T (≈1%) but much smaller than that of N-DMBI-doped oligoethylene glycol-based pNDI-2T (≈13%).1,52 The difference between these two reported studies was attributed to the miscibility of N-DMBI with the conjugated polymers. Our UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra and XPS measurements seem to suggest that sequential-solution doping of Cl-BDPPV using BV˙+ is not diffusion-limited when the BV˙+ molecules infiltrate the polymer film. Rather, the diffusion limit arises from the charged BV˙+ molecules having difficulty infiltrating the ordered lamellar domains of Cl-BDPPV, probably due to the long hydrophobic alkyl chain and the planar polymer backbone. Further investigations on the spatial distribution of BV˙+ molecules have to be carried out to confirm this.
To understand the charge transport and dopant-polymer interactions in BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV, we utilized DFT calculations at the CAM-B3LYP 6-31G** level of theory to simulate the geometry of a Cl-BDPPV dimer with and without a BV˙+ molecule (Fig. 7). The ratio of one Cl-BDPPV dimer to one BV˙+ molecule was chosen based on the ratio of XPS N1s binding energies of the Cl-BDPPV repeating unit to BV˙+ molecule. The geometry optimized dimer without BV˙+ molecule ([Cl-BDPPV dimer]) was slip-stacked along the meridional direction with a displacement of ∼3.9 Å and a π–π stacking distance of 3.61 Å, which is somewhere in between the experimental segregated and mixed stacking mode. The electron and hole transfer integrals of the [Cl-BDPPV dimer] were computed to be 85 meV and 32 meV respectively using the energy-splitting-in-dimer approach, with the electron transfer integral agreeing well with literature values.53 The much larger electron transfer integral is in agreement with the n-type character of Cl-BDPPV. The geometry optimized for [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]˙+ maintained the slip-stacked packing without any significant change in the displacement along the meridional direction (∼3.9 Å), suggesting that the (001) meridional reflection in the segregated stacking mode is most likely not affected by the incorporation of the BV˙+ molecule. The electron transfer integral of [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]˙+ was computed to be 83 meV using single-point energy calculation of the optimized [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]˙+ with the BV˙+ molecule removed, which was slightly inferior to that of the Cl-BDPPV dimer without a BV˙+ molecule. The spin density of [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]˙+ is localized on the BV molecule. However, taking into consideration the redox-mediated diffusion of BV˙+ species into the polymer film and their spectroscopic presence in the UV-Vis-NIR spectra (vide supra), it is likely that the BV˙+-doped Cl-BDPPV system exists as [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]0. DFT optimization of this kind of configuration indicates the existence of [Cl-BDPPV dimer]˙− and BV˙+ species since the spin density was delocalized on both the dimer and the BV˙+ molecule. Again, no significant change in the displacement along the meridional direction was observed (∼3.9 Å). The electron transfer integral of [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]0 was computed to be 96 meV, significantly larger than that of [Cl-BDPPV dimer] and [Cl-BDPPV dimer + BV]˙+, suggesting much better electron transport in this kind of configuration.

Conclusion
The BDOPV cores are very electron-deficient and their polymers often have LUMO energy levels much lower than −4.0 eV.54 Despite this, we are unaware of any reports on n-doping of BDOPV core-based polymers using electron-donors since their debut in 2013. Instead, all the reported n-doping of BDOPV core-based polymers is based on a hydride-donor. The reason for this, we believe, is likely due to the tendency of over-doping via excessive electron transfer from the electron-donor to these polymers as a result of their very low LUMO energy levels. On the other hand, hydride transfer by a hydride-donor often requires thermal energy to overcome an activation barrier.10,23 Thus the extent of n-doping using a hydride-donor can be tuned not only by the dopant ratio but also by the annealing temperature. The latter has been recently demonstrated on N-DMBI-doped BBL.45 BDOPV core-based polymers often require the use of super long alkyl side chains to impart solubility and processability.54 These super long alkyl side chains possess a characteristic near room-temperature melting transition that would facilitate the penetration of dopant molecules via sequential solution/vapor doping, thereby increasing the ease of doping. Indeed, we confirmed that n-doping of Cl-BDPPV thin films using the commonly used electron-donor TDAE via sequential-vapor doping was found to be extremely rapid and over-doping occurred in just one second upon exposure to TDAE vapor. By using our BV˙+ n-dopant, we demonstrated for the first time well-controlled electron-doping of Cl-BDPPV using sequential-solution doping in dilute BV˙+ solution, thus allowing their thermoelectric performances to be evaluated. Since n-doping of conjugated polymers is also an important process for electron-transporting layers in solar cells and light-emitting diodes, we envision that BV˙+ can be a viable electron-donating n-dopant for conjugated polymer based electron-transport layers in these applications.
