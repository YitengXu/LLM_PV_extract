    , Accepted 16th April 2020First published on 21st April 2020AbstractA bithiophene donor unit, 3-alkoxy-3′-alkyl-bithiophene (TRTOR), was copolymerized with difluorobenzochalcogenadiazole (ffBZ) containing different heteroatoms on its diazole structure to afford a series of PffBZ copolymers (where Z = X, T, Se) with narrow optical bandgaps in the range of 1.34–1.47 eV. The effects of the ffBZ heteroatoms (O, S, and Se) on the optical properties, electrochemical characteristics and film morphologies of the polymers as well as the device performance were fully investigated. The results revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the polymers gradually elevated accompanied by their increased materials solubility in common organic solvents as the size of the heteroatoms increased. The PffBZ copolymers exhibited a substantial hole mobility of 0.08–1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). The PffBX, PffBT, and PffBSe-based polymers exhibited maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.47%, 10.12%, and 3.65%, respectively, in polymer solar cells (PSCs). For the PffBZ copolymers, the alkyl chain exerts a great influence on the morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend films and hence affect the PCEs in PSCs. It was found that the performance of the polymers with branching on the 2nd position of the alkyl chain and the 3rd position of the alkoxy chain were the best among the PffBT and PffBSe-based polymers, different from the tetrathiophene-based benchmark polymer with branching on the 2nd position of the alkyl chain. X-ray diffraction revealed that all of the PffBZ-based polymers showed obvious face-on dominant orientation, and that chalcogen atoms and branched positions on the alkoxy chain have a great influence on the morphologies of the neat and blend films. The above results indicated that the branching positions and chalcogen atoms should be carefully optimized to maximize performance.
Introduction
π-Conjugated polymers have attracted much attention over the past few decades due to their great potential for use in fabricating lightweight, flexible and large-area electronic devices, such as organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–8 The design and synthesis of novel polymer semiconductors with optimized physicochemical and electronic properties play a crucial role in achieving high device performance.9–11 Among existing materials, in-chain donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymers demonstrate widely adjustable physicochemical properties and optimized film morphology, and hence improve device performance in OTFTs and PSCs.12–15 For organic electronic devices, modulating the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of the polymer semiconductors, including both the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), is critical in promoting device performance, since they are closely related to injection/generation, transport, and collection of charge carriers.14,16–18 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer semiconductors can be effectively adjusted through orbital hybridization among these units by copolymerizing appropriate donor and acceptor units, thus achieving better performance for organic electronic devices.
Head-to-head linkages containing bithiophene units with side chains substituted by alkoxy groups have proved to be promising electron donors in constructing D–A type copolymers for PSCs and OTFTs.19–22 This is because their reduced steric hindrance (the –CH2– moiety connected to the thiophene unit is replaced by a smaller oxygen atom) and extra introduced intramolecular S⋯O interactions, featuring high coplanar molecular backbones and strong electron-donating abilities, lead to a pronounced red-shifted absorption and a smaller bandgap of the D–A polymers compared to conventional 3,3′-dialkyl-2,2′-bithiophene units (BTR)-based polymer analogues.19 Previous studies have also demonstrated that 3-alkoxy-3′-alkyl-2,2′-bithiophene (TRTOR), in which the side chains between the two adjacent thiophene units are substituted by only one alkoxyl group at the 3-position of the thiophene, offer more advantages than the analogue donor units with two alkoxyl groups at the 3-position of thiophene (BTOR), while maintaining a coplanar molecular geometry and strong electron-donating properties.19,23 In particular, the HOMO energy levels of TRTOR-based polymers are lower than those of BTOR-based polymers, thus resulting in increased Voc values and better device performance of the PSC devices.19 Our previous work has proved that the TRTOR-based polymer PffBT-3 (Fig. 1) shows a more pronounced red-shifted absorption spectra and a smaller bandgap than terthiophene- or tetrathiophene-based polymer analogues if it is copolymerized with benzothiadiazole.19,20,24–26 When blended with PC71BM, PffBT-3-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs show remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 9.76%,20 attributed to their excellent solar light absorption, ordered film morphology, and substantial charge carrier mobility. These results clearly demonstrate that TRTOR is an excellent building block for constructing high-performance polymer semiconductors.19,20

Among various acceptor units that have been reported, difluorobenzothiazole (ffBT) is widely used for constructing high-performance in-chain donor–acceptor copolymers due to its strong electron-withdrawing capability and compact geometry. The ffBT-based polymer semiconductors currently show the most promising PCEs in fullerene solar cells.25,27,28 A new acceptor unit difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX) was obtained by replacing the S atom in the ffBT unit with an O atom.29,30 The electron deficiency of ffBX is more than that of ffBT because the electron negativity of the O atom is higher than that of the S atom. When ffBX was copolymerized with various donor units, the polymers obtained showed higher Voc values in PSCs and facile tunable charge carrier polarity in OTFTs due to the high electron deficiency of ffBX.29–32 The difluorobenzoselenadiazole (ffBSe) unit is produced if the S atom in ffBT is substituted with a heavier Se atom. Several studies have shown that polymers containing ffBSe exhibit red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra compared with their ffBT-based polymer analogues, and these properties enhance their light harvesting capability in PSCs.33–35 Based on our previous results,20 the high performance of PffBT-3 devices drives us to further investigate the physicochemical properties and device performances of PffBX and PffBSe-based polymer analogues in organic semiconductors.
Herein, the TRTOR donor unit was copolymerized with a variety of ffBZ acceptor units, ffBX, ffBT, and ffBSe to afford a series of polymer semiconductors with narrow bandgaps of 1.34–1.47 eV (Fig. 1). The influences of the heteroatoms on the optical properties, electrical characteristics, and device performance of the polymer semiconductors were systematically investigated. The results indicate that the backbone planarity and intermolecular aggregation gradually decrease as the chalcogen atom size increases from O to S and to Se. Among all the polymers, the PffBT-based polymers exhibit better device performance than the PffBX- and PffBSe-based polymer analogues. In addition, the branching positions of the side chains were systematically changed to probe their influences on the device performance. It was found that the branching positions of the side chain are critical for the aggregation of the polymer chain, film morphology, and hence the device performance. The PffBT-3 polymer with the 2nd position branching away from the backbone on the alkyl chain and 3rd position branching away from the backbone on the alkoxy chain (Fig. 1) affords the highest PCE of 10.12% with a remarkable Jsc value of 21.46 mA cm−2 in PSCs (Fig. 6 and Table 3) and the highest hole mobility (μh) of 1.58 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs (Fig. S14, ESI†) due to its high degree of backbone planarity, narrow optical bandgap and the improvement of film crystallinity. Different from the tetrathiophene-based benchmark polymer that has branching positions on the 2nd position of the alkyl chain,25 the polymer analogue PffBT-2 with 2nd position branching from the backbone on both the alkyl and alkoxy chains (Fig. 1) leads to reduced charge carrier mobility and PCE. The PffBT-2 polymer shows a lower PCE of 7.42% than PffBT-3 because the film morphology is degraded. The results indicate that the branching position of the side chain should be carefully optimized to maximize performance in PffBZ-based polymer semiconductors.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The ffBT monomer was purchased from a commercial resource, and the monomers ffBX and ffBSe were synthesized according to published procedures (see the ESI† for the synthetic details).29,30,36 TRTOR monomers with two branching positions on their side chains were synthesized to fine-tune the film morphology and study the correlations between the materials structure, properties and device performance. All TRTORs could be readily stannylated to obtain tin monomers, which were used for polymerization with three ffBZ units via Pd-mediated Stille coupling-based polycondensation reactions. After polymerization, all of the polymer chains were end-capped with mono-functionalized thiophene and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methane, acetone, and hexane to remove the small molecular weight fractions, and then with dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to extract the high molecular weight polymer products. The polymers with the highest molecular weights were collected and used as polymer semiconductors after they were extracted with the final solvent. The desirable molecular weights (Mns) of all polymers were 11–35 kDa and their comparable polydispersity indices (PDI) were 1.3–1.7 (Table 1). Among all of the polymers, the PffBT-based copolymers show limited solubility at room temperature, but can be readily dissolved in hot o-DCB and toluene, and the PffBSe-based polymers show better solubility, and can be dissolved in o-DCB and toluene at room temperature. However, the solubility of the PffBX-based polymers is worse in hot o-DCB and toluene. In terms of polymer solubility, it seems that the solubility of the polymers increases in line with an increase in the size of the heteroatoms, thus proving that inter-chain interactions occur and have a profound impact on the device performance of OTFTs and PSCs.

Compared to the PffBT-based polymer PffBT-3, the PffBX-based polymer analogue PffBX-3 with the same side chains was also synthesized. However, the PffBX-3 polymer aggregates quite easily, even in hot o-DCB (∼100 °C), resulting in it having poor solubility. The PffBX-2 polymer was also synthesized to improve the polymer solubility, showing good solubility in hot o-DCB (∼100 °C), thus exhibiting higher performance in OTFTs and PSCs than PffBX-3. The PffBSe-3 polymer shows good solubility in o-DCB at room temperature, but the temperature needs to be elevated to ∼100 °C for the PffBT-3 polymer with the same side chains to achieve comparable solubility, and only limited solubility is observed even in hot o-DCB (∼100 °C) for the PffBX-3 polymer, which makes it difficult to fabricate a device, and hence leads to low performance OTFTs and PSCs. The above results show that the solubilities of the PffBZ-based polymers gradually increase as the size of the chalcogen atoms (O < S < Se) in the ffBZ monomers increases.37
Theoretical computation of the polymer semiconductors
In order to better understand the influences of the chalcogen atoms on the optoelectrical properties of the PffBZ-based polymer semiconductors, density functional theory (DFT)-based computation was performed for the dyads of polymer repeating units using a hybrid B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set (Gaussian 09). All of the branched alkyl side chains were truncated in order to facilitate the calculations. The optimized geometries of the polymer dyads are shown in Fig. 2, and the FMO spatial distributions are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculation results revealed that all of these PffBZ-based polymers show quite planar backbones with dihedral angles between any two neighboring arenes in the range of 0.05–0.23°, which can be attributed to the compact geometry of the building blocks as well as the intramolecular interaction of noncovalent S⋯O, F⋯S, and F⋯H.38–41 It was found that the dihedral angle between neighboring arenes of ffBZ and thiophene slightly increased as the size of the chalcogen atom increased from O to S and to Se on the ffBZ unit, probably because the atomic size is larger, thus increasing steric hindrance between ffBZ and thiophene.

Dihedral angles between neighboring arenes are indicated by the red dotted circles. Alkyl substituents were truncated for calculation simplicity. 
The low-lying ELUMO/EHOMO of the PffBX-3 polymer dyads (−3.00/−4.99 eV) is lower than that of the PffBT-3 polymer dyads (−2.87/−4.80 eV) if ffBT is substituted with ffBX, because the electronegativity of the O atom is higher than that of the S atom.29 Due to the high-lying EHOMO, low Voc values (0.66–0.67 V) are a major bottleneck in the performance of PffBT-based PSCs, while a low-lying EHOMO should be beneficial for increasing the Voc values of PffBX-based PSCs. The ELUMO (−2.91 eV) of PffBSe-3 is lowered by 0.04 eV but the EHOMO (−4.74 eV) is raised by 0.06 eV compared to PffBT-3, where the relatively raised EHOMO of PffBSe-3 versus that of PffBT-3 could be ascribed to the lower electronegativity of Se (vs. S) and the higher quinoidal character upon the substitution of S with Se,42–44 therefore, PffBSe-3 shows the smallest bandgap (Table 1). The high-lying EHOMO of PffBSe-3 results in it having the lowest Voc value in PSCs (vide infra) among the PffBZ-based polymers. The electron densities are well delocalized on the HOMO energy levels of the main polymer chain (Table S1, ESI†), which should be beneficial for the intramolecular transport of charge carriers.
Optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers
The optical absorption spectra of all of the PffBZ-based polymers are shown in Fig. 3a and b, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. All of the polymers show two distinctive absorption bands in both the solution and film states. The high energy absorption in the range of 390–430 nm can be attributed to π–π* transitions, and the low energy absorption in the range of 550–900 nm can be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process.45,46 On the basis of the polymer absorption onsets, the derived optical bandgaps (Eoptg) are 1.46, 1.47, and 1.34 eV for PffBX-3, PffBT-3, and PffBSe-3, respectively. The changes in the branching positions of the PffBZ-based polymers have a minimal effect on the absorption profile of the polymer and the absorption maximum (λmax), indicating comparable backbone conformation, which can be attributed to the greatly reduced steric hindrance brought about by inserting the oxygen atom and effective conformation locking enabled by the intramolecular interaction of noncovalent S⋯O.47 Among all of these PffBZ-based polymers, PffBSe-3 exhibits the most red-shifted absorption with an absorption maximum (λmax) of 820 nm and the narrowest optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.33 eV.44 This trend is consistent with how the absorption of the acceptor ffBZ monomers evolve (Fig. S10, ESI†). As the heteroatoms vary from O to S and to Se, PffBX-3 and PffBT-3 show similar absorption and the Se-containing polymer PffBSe-3 exhibits a substantially red-shifted absorption onset, where the red-shift absorption of the PffBSe-3 polymer is possibly caused by an increase in quinoidal features and a decrease in aromaticity as one atom changes from S to Se.33,35,44,48,49

(c) Cyclic voltammogram of polymer films measured in 0.1 M (n-Bu)4N·PF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard. 
All PffBZ-based polymers show minimal red-shifted absorption λmax and λonset values on going from solution to thin film, indicating their aggregated forms in solution, in combination with their structured absorption profiles.25,50 To further investigate the aggregation of these polymers, temperature-dependent absorption spectra of their diluted o-DCB solutions were recorded at various temperatures from 30 to 100 °C (Fig. S11, ESI†). Based on how their absorption evolved, the polymers were determined to gradually disaggregate as the temperature increased, as revealed by the disappearance of absorption shoulders and greatly blue-shifted absorption λmax values at elevated temperatures. Benzoxadiazole-based PffBX-3 shows the strongest aggregation behavior compared to PffBT-3 and PffBSe-3, as indicated by its less red-shifted λmax at 100 °C (Fig. S11b, ESI†), while benzoselenadiazole-based PffBSe-3 exhibits the weakest aggregation. The PffBSe-3 is almost completely disaggregated at 100 °C, as revealed by the disappearance of the absorption shoulder (Fig. S11f, ESI†). As the heteroatoms vary from O to S and to Se, the aggregation gradually decreases, which is maybe correlated with the slightly increased size of the chalcogen atom and the increased backbone torsion. Among all of the PffBZ-based polymers, the aggregation of PffBX-2, PffBT-2, and PffBSe-2 is decreased by moving the branching position closer to the polymer backbone as the steric hindrance increases, because the branching positions are on the 2nd position in these three polymers.
Electrochemical properties of the polymer
The electrochemical properties of PffBZ-based polymers were characterized via cyclic voltammetry (CV) using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal standard. As shown in Fig. 3c, all of the polymers exhibit obvious oxidation peaks, and the HOMO energy levels (EHOMOs) of the polymers were determined using the equation: EHOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.80) eV,51,52 and the derived EHOMOs for PffBX-3, PffBT-3, and PffBSe-3 were −5.42, −5.20, and −5.14 eV, respectively (Table 1). The LUMO energy levels (ELUMOs) were −3.96, −3.74, and −3.80 eV for PffBX-3, PffBT-3, and PffBSe-3, respectively, which were derived from the polymer Eoptg and HOMO energy levels using the equation: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. Among the polymer series, PffBX-3 shows the lowest-lying EHOMO and ELUMO levels, which can be attributed to ffBX showing the strongest electron-withdrawing capability among the compounds. Benzoselenadiazole-based polymer PffBSe-3 has the highest-lying EHOMO, probably because ffBSe shows the weakest electron withdrawing capability out of all of the compounds. This trend is consistent with that of the electronegativity (O > S > Se) of the chalcogen atoms.43,53 The polymers PffBX-2, PffBT-2, and PffBSe-2 have nearly identical EHOMO and ELUMO levels to those of the PffBX-3, PffBT-3, and PffBSe-3 polymers, respectively, indicating the minimal effects that moving the branching positions from the 3rd to the 2nd position have on the FMO levels for the alkoxy chain in PffBZ-based polymers.51
Thermal properties of the polymers
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out under a N2 atmosphere to study the thermal properties of the PffBZ-based polymers. The DSC and TGA curves of the polymers are shown in Fig. S12 and S13 (ESI†), respectively, and the relevant data are compiled in Table 1. The decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss were above 340 °C for all of these PffBZ-based polymers, suggesting their good thermal stability for device fabrication and optimization. According to the DSC curves (Fig. S12, ESI†), the PffBT-based polymers show thermal transition at higher temperatures than the PffBX and PffBSe-based polymers, which possibly indicates the increased film crystallinity of the PffBT-based polymers. Polymer PffBT-3 exhibits the highest crystallinity among the polymers, as revealed by it having the sharpest transition peak. Therefore, the film crystallinity can be increased by moving the branching points away from the polymer backbone, which can be attributed to the reduced steric hindrance between the adjacent bulky side chains. The charge carrier mobilities in the OTFTs and PCEs in PSCs are improved because the crystallinity of the PffBT-3 polymer is increased (vide infra).
Organic thin-film transistor performances of the polymers
The charge transport properties of all of these PffBZ-based polymer semiconductors were investigated by fabricating OTFTs with a top-gate/bottom-contact (TG/BC) device architecture, in which an amorphous fluoropolymer poly(perfuorobutenylvinyl ether) (CYTOP) was used as the dielectric layer. The parameters of OTFT performance are shown in Table 2 and the representative OTFT transfer and output curves are shown in Fig. 4. During the device optimization, it was found that PffBX-2, PffBX-3, PffBT-2, PffBT-3, PffBSe-2, and PffBSe-3 showed optimal performances, with maximum hole mobility (μh) values of 0.14, 0.084, 0.55, 0.69,20 0.12, and 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, if o-DCB was used as the processing solvent under thermal annealing at 250 °C. The PffBX-3 polymer exhibited a lower μh value and higher threshold voltage (VT) than its analogue PffBT-3, which could be attributed to the low-lying EHOMO level of the PffBX-based polymer and the larger hole injection barrier thus generated. PffBSe-3 showed a lower μh value than PffBT-3, possibly because of its more twisted polymer backbone and decreased film crystallinity. Polymer PffBT-3 exhibited the highest μh value among all of the PffBZ-based polymers, which was attributed to its high crystallinity and excellent film morphology (vide infra). For the best-performing polymer PffBT-3-based OTFTs, an off-center spin-coating (OCSC) method was utilized to improve the polymer chain alignment,54,55 and the OTFTs showed a further increase in their μh values to 1.58 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S14, ESI†).

Photovoltaic characteristics of the polymer solar cells
Inverted BHJ PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were firstly fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performance of all of these PffBZ-based polymers. In order to fully optimize the PSC performance, we systematically changed the polymer:PC71BM ratios, active layer thicknesses, and processing additives of the blend films. The performance parameters under various fabrication conditions are summarized in Table 3 and Tables S2–S4 (ESI†), and the current–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 5a. During the device optimization, it was found that the PSCs with a polymer:PC71BM ratio of 1:1.5 typically showed improved performance and that the PSC performance could be further improved by insertion of a thin layer of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) between the active layer and the ZnO electron transporting layer. The J–V characteristics of the optimized PSCs under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5a, with the relevant performance parameters collected in Table 3, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal cells are illustrated in Fig. 5b.

 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of PffBZ-based polymer solar cells fabricated under optimized conditions. 
Polymer PffBX-3 exhibits a PCE of 2.44% with a Jsc value of 6.65 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.75 V and a FF of 48.9%. The optical absorption of PffBX-3 approaches 854 nm, which indicates that a high Jsc value could maybe be attained in PSCs. However, PffBX-3 showed excessive aggregation at both 30 and 100 °C (Fig. S11b, ESI†), leading to poor blend film morphology, revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, which was not favorable in achieving efficient charge transport and collection in the related devices, and led to a low Jsc value. For the PffBT-3 polymer, it was found that both the Jsc and PCE values were drastically improved by adding 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) additive, as a result of increasing film crystallinity, revealed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and AFM imaging. PffBT-3 exhibited a higher PCE of 10.12% with a remarkable Jsc value of 21.46 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.67 V, and a large fill factor (FF) of 70.9%. The performance of polymer PffBT-3 is improved probably because the film morphology is better than that in previous reports.20 To our best knowledge, the Jsc and PCE values are among the highest for fullerene-based PSCs with a bandgap of <1.50 eV. A small Voc value of 0.55 V and a low Jsc value of 13.03 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 3.65% was obtained for polymer PffBSe-3, where the low Jsc value is likely to be attributed to low charge carrier mobility and poor morphology. PffBX-2 showed better solubility than PffBX-3, leading to proper blend film morphology, hence making the Jsc and PCE values in PSCs higher than those of PffBX-3. PffBT-2 and PffBSe-2 exhibited Jsc values of 20.01 and 13.30 mA cm−2, respectively, similar to those of PffBT-3 and PffBSe-3. However, the FFs were significantly reduced by a big margin (>10%) probably because of low charge carrier mobility and poor blend film morphology. As a result, the PCEs were decreased to 7.42% and 2.32% for the PffBT-2 and PffBSe-2-based PSCs, respectively.
In terms of performance parameters, the PffBT-based polymer semiconductors showed Voc values of 0.66–0.67 V, indicating the minimal effect that the branch point of the side chains has on the Voc values. The PffBX-based PSCs showed the largest Voc values of 0.74–0.75 V, which verified that they have the lowest-lying EHOMO levels in the polymer series. The PffBT-based polymers showed greater Voc values (0.65–0.67 V) than those (0.53–0.55 V) of the PffBSe-based polymers. The Voc values of the PffBX-based PSCs were consistent with the EHOMO levels of these polymer donors. In terms of device performance, the chalcogen atom exerted a great influence on the Voc values and PCEs of the PffBZ-based polymers. The branch point of the alkyl side chain has a strong influence on the morphology and mobility (space charge limited current), thus making the PCEs in PSCs different.
The EQE spectra (Fig. 5b) reveal that PffBT-3 exhibited higher EQE values than PffBX-3 and PffBSe-3, with the highest EQE value of nearly 75%, indicating that this polymer has a high Jsc values in PSCs. The PffBX and PffBT-based polymers showed a broad photo-response from 300 to 850 nm, but the PffBSe-based polymers exhibited an EQE spectrum with a longer wavelength of 950 nm in the EQE curve. These results were in good agreement with the optical absorption spectra of these polymers. The integral Jsc values deduced from the EQE spectra were well matched with those obtained from the J–V measurements, with a mismatch <5%, indicating the good reliability of the PSC performance.
Charge carrier mobilities in blend polymer films
The charge carrier mobilities of the polymer:PC71BM blend films were characterized using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method56 with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/Polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al device structures for hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively (see Table 3 and Fig. S15, S16, ESI†). The derived SCLC hole mobilities (μh,SCLC) were 7.70 × 10−5, 3.52 × 10−4, 9.93 × 10−5, 2.68 × 10−3, 4.45 × 10−5, and 2.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2) for the PffBX-2, PffBX-3, PffBT-2, PffBT-3, PffBSe-2, and PffBSe-3-based blend films, respectively. Among all of the blend films, the μh,SCLC value of the PffBT-3:PC71BM blend was the highest. The SCLC electron mobility (μe,SCLC: 8.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the PffBT-3 blend was slightly lower than that of PffBX-3 (1.36 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), but it was greater than that of the other polymer blends, possibly because PffBX-based polymers showed the lowest ELUMO among the PffBZ-based polymers. The high SCLC mobility of the PffBT-3:PC71BM blend led to it having the highest Jsc value among the PffBX-based PSCs. The PffBSe-3:PC71BM blend showed the lowest μh,SCLC/μe,SCLC values of 2.63 × 10−5/1.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which prohibited the transport and collection of charge carriers, hence leading to its having a low Jsc in PSCs.
Film morphologies and their correlations with device performance
AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the surface and bulk morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blend films (Fig. 6 and Fig. S17, S18, ESI†). The root mean square (RMS) roughness of all of these polymers:PC71BM blend films increased after ODT addition (Fig. S18, ESI†), and the RMS roughness of the PffBX-2:PC71BM, PffBX-3:PC71BM, PffBT-2:PC71BM, PffBT-3:PC71BM, PffBSe-2:PC71BM, and PffBSe-3:PC71BM blend films increased to 22.67, 21.28, 19.38, 11.67, 4.53, and 9.88 nm, respectively, indicating that the film crystallinity of the blend films was increased upon ODT addition.20,57 It can be seen from Fig. 6 and Fig. S18 (ESI†) that the PffBT-3:PC71BM blend film exhibited a smoother surface with a lower RMS roughness than the PffBT-2:PC71BM blends. The low RMS roughness of the PffBT-3:PC71BM blend film is beneficial for exciton dissociation at the polymer:PC71BM interface and charge transport. Consequently, the polymer PffBT-3 showed a higher Jsc value and FF than PffBT-2. The RMS roughness values of the PffBSe-2:PC71BM and PffBSe-3:PC71BM blend films are the lowest among the PffBZ-based polymers:PC71BM blend films, which is likely to be attributed to their low crystallinity and good solubility. After ODT was added, the phase separation at the nanoscale with an interpenetrating network could be clearly observed in the TEM images of the PffBZ-based polymer:PC71BM blend films, which enabled these polymers:PC71BM-based devices with higher PCEs in PSCs than polymers:PC71BM without ODT added (see Fig. 6, Fig. S17 and Table S4, ESI†). Among all of the PffBZ-based polymers, the TEM images of PffBX-3:PC71BM, PffBSe-2:PC71BM, and PffBSe-3:PC71BM suggested that some PC71BM-rich domains were formed. The domains formed in the polymers:PC71BM blend films were detrimental to exciton diffusion and separation, thus leading to low Jsc values. The PffBT-3:PC71BM blend film showed the longest nanoscale fibrils among the PffBZ-based polymers, which probably enhanced mixing, efficient exciton and charge transport between PffBT-3 and PC71BM, thus leading to high Jsc values in PSCs.
 Fig. 6  AFM phase images and TEM images of the active layers (a and g) PffBX-2:PC71BM, (b and h) PffBX-3:PC71BM, (c and i) PffBT-2:PC71BM, (d and j) PffBT-3:PC71BM, (e and k) PffBSe-2:PC71BM, and (f and l) PffBSe-3:PC71BM. The films were prepared using the optimal conditions for the PSCs (3 vol% ODT). 
The interchain packing structure of the PffBX-based polymers in the pure and blend films were analyzed using 2D-GIXD. The X-ray diffraction pattern and the corresponding line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 7 and Fig. S19 (ESI†), and the relevant data are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). For the pure film, the GIXD diffractogram of PffBX-2 exhibited remarkably strong lamellar diffraction up to the (300) peak with a d-spacing of 1.75 nm both in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) orientations. An obvious π–π stacking peak was seen in the OOP direction, and the π–π stacking located at 1.62 A−1 gave a stacking distance of 0.39 nm, indicating the high crystallinity of the PffBX-2 film. A weak π–π stacking peak was also seen in the IP direction, indicating the coexistence of an edge-on crystalline orientation. This edge-on backbone orientation benefits charge transport in transistor devices. The crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) calculated from the IP and OOP directions were 21.0 and 11.4 nm, respectively (Table S9, ESI†). The pure PffBX-3 film showed obvious lamellar diffractions up to the (300) peak in the IP direction and the (100) peak in the OOP direction with a longer d-spacing of 1.85 nm versus the d-spacing (1.75 nm) of the PffBX-2 film, which suggested that the bulky 2-propylheptan-1-oloxy chain on the TRTOR unit led to an increase in the interchain distance of the PffBX-based polymers. A similar phenomenon could also be seen among the PffBT and PffBSe-based polymers. The pure PffBX-3 film showed a face-on dominant orientation with a π–π stacking distance of ∼0.39 nm, and had a long crystal size (24.6 nm) in the IP direction, which is a disadvantage to charge transport in the edge-on orientation in transistor devices. The PffBT-based polymer films showed different microstructures from those of the PffBX-based polymers. The pure PffBT-2 and PffBT-3 films showed remarkably strong lamellar diffractions up to the (300) peak with d-spacings of 1.75 and 1.80 nm, respectively. Both the PffBT-based polymer films exhibited stronger π–π stacking peaks in the OOP direction than the PffBX-based polymer films, and the π–π stacking located at 1.57–1.59 Å−1 displayed a stacking distance of ∼0.40 nm. The PffBSe-based polymer films had strong lamellar diffractions progressing up the (300) peaks with a large crystal size (17–19 nm) in the OOP direction, which indicated the high crystallinity of the PffBSe-based polymer films.
 Fig. 7  2D-GIXD images of pure (annealing at 250 °C) and blend films. 
All of the PffBZ-based blend films showed similar diffractions to the pure film. The PffBX:PC71BM-based blend film exhibited obvious diffraction at the (100) and (200) peaks, leading to the high crystallinity of the PffBX:PC71BM-based blend films. Both the PffBX-2:PC71BM and PffBX-3:PC71BM blend films exhibited obvious π–π stacking peaks in the OOP direction, indicating a face-on orientation. The crystal coherence length (CCL) calculated from the IP direction was about 21.7–24.0 nm, possibly because of increased interchain interaction and strong aggregation of the PffBX-based polymers. The PffBT:PC71BM-based blend films showed distinct diffraction peaks among these polymers, and the PffBT-3:PC71BM blend film showed the strongest π–π stacking in the OOP direction among the PffBZ-based blend films, with a π–π stacking peak located at 1.59 Å−1 (corresponding to a stacking distance of 0.39 nm), with the diffraction pattern indicating that the PffBT-3 in the blend film adopted an edge-on crystalline orientation, which is beneficial to charge transport and results in high Jsc values and FFs in PSCs,58,59 leading to the PffBT-3 polymer demonstrating high performance in PSCs. The PffBSe:PC71BM-based blend film did not show obvious π–π stacking peak in the OOP and IP directions, which indicated that these two polymer:PC71BM blend films showed poor crystallinity, and thus also showed low performance in PSCs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a series of narrow bandgap (1.33–1.47 eV) PffBZ-based polymers incorporating TRTOR as the electron donor units and ffBZ as the electron acceptor units were synthesized and characterized. The five new copolymers were compared computationally and experimentally with the previously reported copolymer PffBT-3. As the chalcogen atomic size in the ffBZs increased, the HOMOs of the copolymers were raised, accompanied by their increased solubility. By comparing different chalcogen atom containing PffBZ-based PSC devices, a decreasing trend in the Voc values was found to be accompanied by an increase in the heteroatom size of the chalcogen atoms. Although the Voc values decreased, high-performing PSCs were obtained with PCEs of 2.44%, 10.12%, and 3.65% for PffBX-3, PffBT-3, and PffBSe-3, respectively. The PCEs of PffBT-3 were the highest among polymer semiconductors containing a head-to-head linkage and polymer semiconductors with Eoptg values smaller than 1.50 eV. The optical and electrochemical properties were found to be very similar for PffBZ-based polymers with different branch positions on the chain, but the morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blend films were very different, resulting in the different PCEs of the PSCs. The high planarity backbone of TRTOR resulted in the PffBX-2, PffBX-3, PffBT-2, PffBT-3, PffBSe-2, and PffBSe-3 polymers exhibiting hole mobilities of 0.14, 0.084, 0.55 1.58, 0.12, and 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices, respectively. The correlations between structure, properties and device performance in this work offer useful insights for constructing ffBZ-based polymer semiconductors in organic electronics.
