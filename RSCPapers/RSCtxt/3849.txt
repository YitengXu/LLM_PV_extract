    First published on 16th October 2014AbstractHarvesting solar energy from sunlight to generate electricity is considered as one of the most important technologies to address the future sustainability of humans. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest and attention over the past two decades due to their potential advantage to be fabricated onto large area and light-weight flexible substrates by solution processing at a lower cost. PSCs based on the concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration where an active layer comprises a composite of a p-type (donor) and an n-type (acceptor) material represents the most useful strategy to maximize the internal donor–acceptor interfacial area allowing for efficient charge separation. Fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61or71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are the ideal n-type materials ubiquitously used for BHJ solar cells. The major effort to develop photoactive materials is numerously focused on the p-type conjugated polymers which are generally synthesized by polymerization of electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor monomers. Compared to the development of electron-deficient comonomers (acceptor segments), the development of electron-rich donor materials is considerably flourishing. Forced planarization by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic and heteroaromatic subunits leads to the formation of ladder-type conjugated structures which are capable of elongating effective conjugation, reducing the optical bandgap, promoting intermolecular π–π interactions and enhancing intrinsic charge mobility. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress on the development of various well-defined new ladder-type conjugated materials. These materials serve as the superb donor monomers to prepare a range of donor–acceptor semi-ladder copolymers with sufficient solution-processability for solar cell applications.

1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on fullerene–polymer composites have been developed over 15 years.1 The efficiency of polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) grew slowly from 3% to 5% for many years. However, this type of solar cell has made remarkable improvement in efficiency since 2009. Such a rapid progress is very significant, showing promise and brightness for future commercialization. Along with advanced device engineering and controlled active-layer morphology, the major breakthrough in this area comes from the development of superb conjugated polymers to achieve efficient light-harvesting and charge transport. Theoretical computation predicts that over 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a BHJ solar cell is obtainable if an ideal p-type conjugated polymer is equipped with all required properties.2 Through tremendous research effort to create numerous novel conjugated polymers, encouraging device performances with PCEs up to 8–9% have been realized recently.3–14
Extensive research and accumulated experiences have provided the general guidelines for developing p-type conjugated polymers. The required intrinsic properties for an ideal p-type conjugated polymer at the molecular level include (1) sufficient solubility to guarantee solution processability and miscibility with n-type materials, (2) a low optical band gap (LBG) for the broad absorption spectrum to capture more solar energy, (3) high hole mobility for accelerating charge transport to reduce charge recombination and series resistance, and (4) suitable HOMO and LUMO energies to ensure a large Voc and a downhill energy offset for exciton dissociation. So far, the most useful method to prepare a LBG polymer is to connect electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor segments along the conjugated polymer backbone, in either an alternating or a random fashion.15 Efficient intramolecular charge transfer will occur upon photoexcitation.
The most straightforward way to make an alternating donor–acceptor conjugated polymer is to independently synthesize a donor monomer and an acceptor monomer which are then polymerized via a transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. In this regard, molecular design of new electron-rich donor monomers is central to the development p-type donor–acceptor polymers.16–24 Traditional linear conjugated polymers consist of continuous aromatic rings interconnected by carbon–carbon single bonds (Scheme 1a). Another important category of conjugated frameworks is ladder-type polymers which are comprised of linearly fused aromatic or heterocyclic subunits connected via sharing endocyclic carbon–carbon double bonds. (Scheme 1b).25–48

Such double-strand conjugated structures feature high thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities. More importantly, covalently forced planarization in a ladder structure strengthens the parallel p-orbital interactions to reduce the band gap by elongating the effective conjugation length and facilitating π-electron delocalization. Moreover, the rigidified coplanar structures can suppress the rotational disorder around interannular single bonds to lower the reorganization energy, which in turn enhances the intrinsic charge mobility.49
Although the physical and electronic properties of ladder-type polymers have attracted considerable interest in the area of nonlinear optics, light-emitting diodes and organic transistors, the highly rigid ladder-type polymers suffer from poor solubility for solution processability due to strong π–π interactions, greatly limiting their optoelectronic applications. To circumvent the infusibility of the ladder-type polymers/oligomers while maintaining the advantageous properties of structural planarization, it is envisaged that the well-defined ladder-type small molecules can function as donor monomers to polymerize with acceptor units, leading to a new class of donor–acceptor semi-ladder copolymers that can be suitably used for solution-processable polymer solar cells (Scheme 2). Therefore, molecular designs and synthesis have been devoted towards integrating electron-rich aromatic subunits into mutually ring-fused structures. Various accessible electron-rich aromatic and heterocyclic building blocks such as benzene, thiophene, furan, selenophene, pyrrole, silole, germole, cyclopentadienyl moieties can be chemically assembled to afford a range of fascinating ladder-type conjugated skeletons with tunable properties and functions. It should be emphasized that incorporation of aliphatic side chains into the conjugated backbone is necessary and side-chain engineering plays a critical role for such semi-ladder conjugated molecules.50–53

The length and the branching position of an alkyl chain, and its attachment position on a polymer backbone would dramatically influence the solubility, crystallization, and molecular packing which alter the charge transportation and morphology of the composites, resulting in variations in device performance. Compared to non-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heteroaromatics, synthesis of new multifused conjugated entities with implantation of alkyl side chains is less explored and remains challenging. The increasing interest of these materials for organic photovoltaics thus opens up a new research field for synthetic and polymer chemists.
Several reviews have summarized the development of conjugated polymers for bulk-heterojunction solar cell applications.54–69 The target of this review will focus on the recent advance on the design and synthesis of new ladder-type conjugated small molecules toward the development semi-ladder donor–acceptor polymers. The order of content in this review will be systematically arranged according to the conjugated length of the multifused structures, including tricyclic, tetracyclic, pentacyclic, hexacyclic, heptacyclic, nonacyclic, and undecyclic arenes. The useful synthetic approaches for making these novel and important building blocks will be highlighted and presented. The principle of molecular design and structure–property relationships associated with device characteristics will be discussed.
2. Tricyclic system: tricyclic bithiophene-based D–A copolymers
Coplanar tricyclic bithiophene-based materials where the 3,3′-positions of the bithiophene are fastened by different bridging atoms have been demonstrated as superior building blocks to construct considerable solution-processable organic materials utilized in a spectrum of diverse optoelectronic applications. The molecular properties of these tricyclic skeletons could be modulated by changing the bridging moieties embedded in a central aromatic or heterocyclic ring. The carbon-bridged 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) was the early first monomer utilized for making donor–acceptor conjugated polymers for PSCs.70–73 The bridging carbon of the CPDT can be functionalized by two alkyl groups to increase the solubility of the corresponding copolymers. Zhu et al. first reported a polymer poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (P1).74 Compared with the absorption maximum (λmax = 721 nm) in chloroform, P1 exhibits λmax at 760 nm in a thin film with a relatively low Eg of 1.4 eV, indicating significant interchain interactions in the solid state. The EHOMO and ELUMO of P1 were estimated to be −5.30 and −3.55 eV, respectively. The device using P1:PC71BM (1:3, in wt%, all the polymer:fullerene ratios in the present review are in wt%, unless otherwise stated) blend exhibited a nice PCE of 3.5% in 2007 (Table 1).

Later on, a CPDT-based D–A alternating copolymer P2, using 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as a comonomer, was reported by Scherf et al.75 By using a mixture of chlorobenzene and anisole (19:1, v/v) as the solvent, the device based on the P2:PC61BM (1:1) blend exhibited a PCE of 2.1%.
The CPDT-based random copolymer polymer P3 shown in Scheme 3 was reported by Cheng et al.76 Compared to the absorption of alternating P1, P3 containing higher thiophene and lower BT content showed a blue-shifted but broader absorption spectrum. Moreover, the device incorporating a P1/P3/PC71BM (1:1:4) ternary blend delivered a higher PCE of 2.5%, which outperforms the devices based on the binary blending systems of P1:PC71BM (1:2) (PCE = 1.4%) or P3:PC71BM (1:2) (PCE = 2.0%) under identical conditions due to the complementary absorption and compatible structure of the P3 and P1 polymers.
 Scheme 3  Chemical structures of P1–P4. 
Poly-[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(5-fluoro-[2,1,3]-benzothiadiazole)] (P4) was reported by Jen et al.77 Because of introducing a F atom onto the BT unit, P4 exhibited the lower-lying EHOMO of −5.15 eV compared to −5.02 eV for P1. Therefore, a higher Voc value in P4-based PSCs can be expected. P4 has better π–π stacking than its nonfluorinated analogue, P1, resulting in higher hole mobility. Without using any solvent additive to modify the morphology, the device using the P4:PC71BM (1:2) blend delivered a better performance with a Jsc of 15.0 mA cm−2, a higher Voc of 0.75 V, an FF of 0.49, improving the PCE to 5.51%. Further device optimization by inserting a thin layer of fullerene-containing surfactant between the active layer and Ag cathode resulted in a higher PCE of 5.81%.77
The synthesis of monomer 8 is shown in Scheme 4.76 3-Bromothiophene 1 was lithiated by n-butyl lithium followed by quenching with 3-formylthiophene to afford the di-(thiophen-3-yl)methanol 2. Compound 2 was lithiated again at the 2-positions followed by reaction with iodine to furnish compound 3. PCC oxidation of 3 generated 4 which underwent intramolecular cyclization to afford 5 by the Ullmann coupling reaction. Compound 5 was reduced to 6 by the Wolff–Kishner reduction. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, double alkylation of 6 yielded 7 which was brominated to form 8 by NBS.

The silicon-bridged dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) units with a longer carbon–silicon bond length have been incorporated into the polymers, showing a higher degree of crystallinities and thus prominent solar cells performances. Yang and Hou et al. reported a DTS-based polymer P5 with an optical Eg of 1.45 eV similar to that of P1 (Scheme 5).78 Furthermore, the FET hole mobility of 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P5 is 3 times higher than that for P1. The device based on the P5:PC71BM (1:1) blend showed a Jsc of 12.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.68 V, an FF of 0.55, leading to an average PCE of 4.7%.
 Scheme 5  Chemical structures of P5–P7. 
A DTS-based polymer P6 using thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as an acceptor unit was reported by Tao et al.79 Compared to the CPDT-based counterpart, P6 showed better hole-transport properties and a lower-lying EHOMO of 5.57 eV.80 By using chlorobenzene (CB) with 3 v% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the device based on the P6:PC71BM (1:2) blend showed a Jsc of 12.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, an FF of 0.68, leading to a high PCE of 7.3%.
Marks and Facchetti et al. reported a DTS-based polymer P7 using bithiopheneimide (BTI) as an acceptor unit.81 BTI-based polymers have achieved promising OFET devices with high electron and hole mobilities.39 By using diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive to improve nanoscale phase separation, interpenetrating network formation and also enhance blend film crystallinity, the device with the P7:PC71BM (1:1) blend exhibited a PCE of 6.41%.
The synthesis of monomer 14 is shown in Scheme 6.76 Lithiation of 2,3-dibromothiophene 9 in the presence of copper dichloride generated the dimerized 10, which was then brominated to afford tetrabromo-11. Compound 11 was lithiated again at the 5,5′-position followed by reaction with chlorotrimethylsilane to furnish compound 12. As a consequence, the subsequent lithiation of 12 occurred at the 3,3′-position, which then underwent cyclization through double addition to dioctyldichlorosilane to give 13. Compound 13 was brominated to form 14 by NBS.
 Scheme 6  The synthetic route of monomer 14. 
Heeney et al. reported a germanium-bridged 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole monomer and its copolymer P8 using benzothiadiazole (BT) as an acceptor unit (Scheme 7).82P8 shows an optical bandgap of 1.47 eV which is similar to that of the silicon-bridged P5. By using chloronaphthalene as the additive, the device based on the P8:PC71BM (1:1) blend showed a Jsc of 18.6 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.57 V, and an FF of 0.43, leading to a PCE of 4.5%. The high hole FET mobilities (0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1) of P8 semicrystalline thin films are attributed to the very high photocurrents of OPV devices.
 Scheme 7  Chemical structures of P8–P9. 
A dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole (DTG)-based copolymer P9 using TPD as an acceptor unit was reported by Reynolds et al.83P9 exhibited a red shift of the absorption maxima and a lower Eg value of 1.69 eV in the solid state compared to its silicon-bridged P6 counterpart.79 The device based on the P9:PC71BM blend showed a Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, and an FF of 0.68, leading to a high PCE of 7.3%. Subsequently, Leclerc et al. also reported the synthesis of P9. Their device based on the P9:PC71BM blend showed a PCE of 4.1%.84
The synthesis of monomer 16 is shown in Scheme 8.82 Compound 12 was lithiated by n-BuLi followed by reaction with dibromodi(2-ethylhexyl) germane to yield 15. The crude 15 was brominated with excess NBS to afford monomer 16.

3. Tricyclic system: benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based D–A copolymers
3.1 4,8-Bis(alkyl or alkoxy)-BDT-based copolymers
The electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit, a central benzene ring fused with two thiophenes, emerges as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers due to its symmetric, rigid and coplanar structure. These structural features are beneficial to induce intermolecular π–π interaction for efficient charge transport. Therefore, research efforts have been focused on the synthesis of BDT-based polymers for the applications of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The BDT-based polymer P10 (Scheme 9) has achieved a high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1.85 In 2008, Yang and co-workers reported a series of BDT-based donor–acceptor conjugated polymers used for the applications of organic photovoltaics (OPVs).86 The thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene (TT) unit is a unique thiophene-based building block for the construction of p-type conjugated polymers, because the TT moiety tends to adapt more quinoidal resonance structure along the conjugated backbone, resulting in smaller Eg (energy of bandgap).58,61,68 Alternating poly(benzodithiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PBDTTT) derivatives prepared by polymerization of the BDT unit with the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene moiety have been the most successful polymers for OPV applications. The functional groups substituted on the 2-position of the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit play an important role in determining the molecular properties. Hou et al. reported that P11,87 having a stronger electron-withdrawing alkyl carbonyl group on the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit, showed lower-lying EHOMO (HOMO energy level) and ELUMO (LUMO energy level) (−5.12 and −3.35 eV, respectively) than P12 (−5.01 and −3.24 eV) using the ester group as the side chain; however, the Eg of P11 is approximately the same as that of P12 (Scheme 10).87 Furthermore, when the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit was further substituted with an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom, the resulting polymer P13 exhibited a lower EHOMO accordingly. The absorption spectra of these polymers in the solid state showed a similar absorption onset (∼770 nm) and thus similar Eg. The device based on the P12:PC71BM (1:1) blend exhibited a PCE of 5.15%, whereas the device based on the P11:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend exhibited a higher PCE of 6.58%. Because P13 possesses a relatively lower-lying EHOMO, the device based on the P4:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend showed a higher Voc of 0.76 V, leading to a highest PCE of 7.73% (Table 2).

A series of fluorinated BDT-based polymers P14–P17 were also reported by Yu et al.88 Compared to the absorption of P14 and P15 in the solid state, P16 and P17 showed sharper peaks and more blue-shifted absorption onsets due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atoms. The blue-shifted absorption onset of P15 compared to P14 is attributed to the change of the alkyl side chain from n-octyl for P14 to 2-ethylhexyl for P15. The bulkier side chain causes longer polymer interchain distances, thus reducing interchain interaction. The absorption spectra of P16 and P17 in the solid state are very similar, suggesting that further substitution of fluorine to the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit in P17 does not change its optical properties. The cyclic voltammetry results indicated that both EHOMO and ELUMO can be lowered by the introduction of fluorine to the TT or the BDT units in the polymer backbones. Under the optimal device conditions, the devices based on P14:PC71BM (1:1), P15:PC71BM (1:1.5), P16:PC71BM (1:1.5) or P17:PC71BM (1:1.5) blends exhibited PCEs of 5.1, 7.2, 3.2 and 2.7%, respectively. Although P14 and P16 have similar molecular weight and backbone structure, the FF of P14 is around 50% higher than that of P16. Besides, the Jsc values of P14 and P15 are also higher than those of P16 and P17 by ca. 3–4 mA cm−2. The dramatic decrease of FF values observed in P16:PC71BM and P17:PC71BM blend devices are mostly due to the small mobilities and poor miscibility of the polymers with PC71BM. Very recently, Cao and coworkers introduced poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as a cathode interlayer, the device using the P15:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend as the active layer exhibited a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 17.46 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.7, leading to a very impressive PCE of 9.21%.13P15 is also commonly named as PTB7 in the literature.
Considering that introducing an electron-withdrawing group on the TT unit can lower EHOMO of the corresponding polymers to obtain greater Voc, BDT-based P18 having a strong electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group on the TT unit was reported by Li, Han and Hou et al.89 The absorption spectra of P18 were essentially unchanged in solution and solid states, and the optical Eg deduced from the onset of the polymer thin film absorption spectrum is 1.65 eV. The EHOMO and ELUMO of P18 were estimated to be −5.12 and −3.49 eV, respectively. The device based on the P18:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend exhibited a Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and an FF of 0.58, leading to a high PCE of 6.22%, indicating that the sulfonyl group is also an effective substituent for BDT/TT-based polymers.
The thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit is a simple, compact, and planar structure, which can facilitate electron delocalization and strengthen interchain interactions in conjugated polymers. Furthermore, the TPD unit with electron-withdrawing ability can efficiently lower the EHOMO of the TPD-containing polymers to increase Voc. Leclerc and coworkers first prepared P19 containing BDT and TPD units in an alternating manner.90 The Eg of P19 obtained from the absorption onset is 1.8 eV. Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of P19 in solution is very similar to that in a thin film. The EHOMO and ELUMO of P19 were estimated to be −5.56 and −3.75 eV, respectively. The device based on the P19:PC71BM (1:2) blend exhibited a Jsc of 9.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, and an FF of 0.66, leading to a promising PCE of 5.5%. At the same time, Jen et al. also reported an identical polymer P19 which resulted in a similar PCE of 4.2%.91
Later on, Fréchet et al. also reported BDT/TPD-based alternating copolymers P19, P20 and P21 with different alkyl groups on the TPD units.92 By replacing the 2-ethylhexyl chains in P20 with the less bulky alkyl chains, P19 and P21 showed broader and red-shifted absorption spectra. The Eg obtained from the absorption onset of the polymer films are around 1.7 eV for the three polymers. The estimated EHOMO levels are −5.4 eV for P19, −5.48 eV for P20, and −5.57 eV for P21. The device based on the P20:PC61BM (1:2) blend exhibited a PCE of 3.9%. Compared to P20, the device based on the P21:PC61BM (1:1.5) blend exhibited a higher PCE of 5.4% because of larger FF and Jsc. Furthermore, the device based on the P19:PC61BM (1:1.5) blend using 1 v% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) with higher boiling point as an additive to optimize the morphology of active layer showed the highest PCE of 6.6%. On the other hand, the Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) analysis showed that the TPD-based polymers tend to adapt a face-on orientation of the polymer backbone and preserve a small π-stacking distance in the blend containing PC61BM.
A new BDT-based D–A alternating copolymer P22, using 6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-hexyloxyphenyl)-5,8-dithiophen-2-yl-quinoxaline as an acceptor unit, was reported by Chou et al.10P22 showed more red-shifted absorption in the solid state than in the dilute solution state as a result of a higher degree of interchain π-stacking in the solid film. The EHOMO, ELUMO and Eg of P22 were estimated to be −5.52, −3.30 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively. By adding the processing additive (3 v% DIO), the device based on the P22:PC71BM (1:1) blend exhibited a Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and an FF of 0.576, leading to an average PCE of 7.8%.
BDT-based polymer P23 incorporating thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyT) as the acceptor was reported by W. You et al. (Scheme 11)93P23 showed significant red-shifted absorption in the solid state than in the solution state due to strong π–π stacking in the solid state. The EHOMO, ELUMO and Eg of P23 were estimated to be −5.47, −3.44 eV and 1.51 eV, respectively. The device based on the P23:PC61BM (1:1) blend exhibited a Jsc of 12.78 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, and an FF of 0.582, leading to a PCE of 6.32%.
 Scheme 11  Chemical structures of P23–P28. 
Based on many examples in the literature, introduction of small and electronegative fluorine atoms is an effective way to lower the EHOMO of the conjugated polymers, leading to large Voc values of OPV devices. By using a similar strategy, P24 with two fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole acceptor units was designed and synthesized by You et al.24 The corresponding nonfluorinated polymer P25 was also prepared for comparison. The absorption maximum of P24 in a chlorobenzene (CB) solution is red-shifted by 80 nm at room temperature relative to that at 100 °C, indicating that strong aggregation occurs at room temperature. Moreover, P24 exhibited an additional absorption shoulder in the solid state, implying higher ordered interchain stacking. The optical Eg of P24 deduced from the absorption onset of the thin film spectrum is 1.7 eV. The EHOMO and ELUMO of P24 were estimated to be −5.54 and −3.33 eV, respectively. The device based on the P24:PC61BM (1:1) blend exhibited a Jsc of 12.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V, and an FF of 0.61, leading to a high PCE of 7.2%. The P24:PC61BM (1:1) blend has a higher absorption coefficient than that of the P25:PC61BM (1:1), which likely accounts for the higher Jsc value obtained in the P24-based device.
Structurally similar to benzothiadiazole, the benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole unit is another attractive acceptor unit for the D–A polymer. The central nitrogen atom in a triazole unit allows attachment of an additional solubilizing alkyl chain. You et al. reported BDT-based polymers P26 and P27 by introducing 2-(2-butyloctyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (HTAZ) and 2-(2-butyloctyl)-5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (FTAZ) as the acceptors.94 Compared to the widely used benzothiadiazole, the HTAZ acceptor has weaker electron-withdrawing ability. Therefore, HTAZ-based polymers usually have wider Eg values. Again, P27 showed lower EHOMO and ELUMO (−5.36 and −3.05 eV) than P26 (−5.29 and −2.87 eV) due to the additional electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the FTAZ acceptors. By using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as a solvent to spin cast the active layer followed by solvent annealing, the device based on the P26:PC61BM (1:2) blend exhibited a PCE of 4.36%. Furthermore, the device based on the P27:PC61BM (1:2) blend exhibited a Jsc of 12.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V, and an FF of 0.72, leading to a PCE of 7.1%. The effect of fluorine atoms resulted in an increased Voc in the P27:PC61BM-based devices.

P28 containing thiazolothiazole units was reported by Jenekhe et al.95 The EHOMO and Eg of P28 were estimated to be −5.4 and 1.77 eV. The device based on the P28:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend exhibited a Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.69 V, and an FF of 0.66, leading to an average PCE of 5.3%.
3.2 2-Dimensional 4,8-bis(aryl)-BDT-based copolymers
Since the BDT derivatives have been proved to be a superior donor component for making donor–acceptor copolymers, chemical modification of the BDT unit is a practical and efficient strategy to further improve its molecular properties. Introduction of two thienyl rings at 4-, 8-positions of the BDT unit to extend the conjugation in the vertical direction is a rational design, considering that the absorption ability can be thus improved and the thiophene-based moiety is an essential ingredient for efficient charge transportation. On the basis of the 4,8-bis(2-thienyl)-BDT (BT-BDT) structure, one or two aliphatic side chains can be substituted on the 3- or 4- or 5-positions of the two vertically extended thiophene rings to guarantee sufficient solubility.
Similarly, the BT-BDT unit was also used to copolymerize with the alkoxycarbonyl-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomer or the alkylcarbonyl-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomer to give P29 and P30, respectively (Scheme 12).23 The branched 2-ethylhexyl group on the extended thiophene moieties was employed to improve the solubility of the corresponding polymers. P29 and P30 showed more red-shifted and broader absorption bands compared to the alkoxy-substituted BDT analogues, P11 and P31, due to the enhancement of intermolecular interactions resulting from the extended 2-D conjugation of the alkylthienyl side chains. The Eg values are 1.58 eV for P29 and P30, which are slightly smaller than that of P31 (1.63 eV) and P11 (1.61 eV). By replacing the alkoxy side chain with the alkylthienyl conjugated side chain, the EHOMO and ELUMO of the corresponding polymers are shifted downwardly, which is beneficial for a higher Voc for the PSCs. By adding the processing additive (3 v% DIO), the devices based on P29:PC71BM (1:2) and P30:PC71BM (1:1.5) blends exhibited high PCEs of 6.21% and 7.59%, respectively (Table 3).

P32 using benzothiadiazole as the acceptor was reported by Hou and Yang et al.18 Compared to the solution state, P32 exhibited a more red-shifted absorption spectrum in solid state as a result of the stronger aggregation. The EHOMO and Eg of P32 were estimated to be −5.31 and 1.75 eV, respectively. The device based on the P32:PC71BM (1:2) blend exhibited a Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.92 V, and an FF of 0.58, leading to a PCE of 5.66%. The high Voc agrees well with the lower-lying EHOMO of P32.
BT-BDT-based polymer P33 using a new acceptor unit, naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (NT), was reported by Huang et al.22 The corresponding P34 using benzothiadiazole (BT) as the acceptor was also synthesized for comparison. Compared to BT, NT consisting of two fused 1,2,5-thiadiazole rings has a larger coplanar structure, which can enhance the interchain packing and carrier mobilities of the corresponding polymer. Besides, the electron-withdrawing ability of NT is slightly stronger than that of BT, which reduces the Eg of P33. In comparison to P34, P33 showed red-shifted absorbance spectra both in an o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution and in a thin film, which was a result of the more electron-deficient NT acceptor. The Eg values deduced from the absorption onset of polymer thin film spectra are 1.73 eV for P34 and 1.58 eV for P33. The device based on the P33:PC71BM (1:1) blend exhibited a Jsc of 11.71 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, and an FF of 0.61, leading to a best PCE of 6.0%. However, the device using the P34:PC71BM (1:1) blend only exhibited a lower PCE of 2.11%.
Li and Hou et al. also reported a BT-BDT-based polymer P35 using thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole as the acceptor unit.96 In spite of a branched 2-hexyldecyl group, polymer P35 showed limited solubility in a chloroform or dichlorobenzene solution. The EHOMO, ELUMO and optical Eg of P35 were estimated to be −5.3, −3.2 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Upon adding the processing additive (DIO), the device based on the P35:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a Jsc of 10.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, and an FF of 0.59, and a PCE of 5.22%.
Hou et al. reported a series of D–A polymers (P36, P37, P38 and P39) based on BT-BDT and dithienyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene units. The fluorine atoms can be added onto the BDT units or/and TT units of the backbone.97 All the polymers showed similar absorption spectra in solution and in thin films, and the optical Eg values are estimated to be ca. 1.61–1.65 eV. Compared with P36, the three fluorinated polymers (P37, P38 and P39) showed more prominent shoulder peaks toward longer wavelengths, indicating that stronger intermolecular interactions may come from the introduction of the F-atoms. All of the fluorinated polymers showed lower ELUMO and EHOMO levels than the non-fluorinated polymer, and hence the PSC devices based on these polymers exhibited higher Voc values. Compared to the P36-based device with a Voc of 0.56 V, monofluorination on the TT units in P37 improves Voc to 0.60 V, while difluorination on the BT-BDT units in P38 increases the Voc to 0.74 V. Furthermore, the device based on the trifluorinated polymer, P39, produced the highest the Voc of 0.78 V, indicating that the fluorination on TT and BT-BDT units has a synergistic effect on reducing the LUMO and HOMO levels of the polymers. The devices based on P36:PC71BM (1:1.5), P37:PC71BM (1:1.5), P38:PC71BM (1:1.5) or P39:PC71BM (1:1.5) blends exhibited high PCEs of 4.5%, 5.6%, 7.2% or 8.6%, respectively. The device based on the P39:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend using 3 v% DIO as an additive exhibited the best performance with a maximal PCE of 8.6% and an average PCE of 8.3% due to the higher Jsc and larger Voc values.
A thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-substituted BDT derivative-based polymer P40, using 2-ethylhexyl 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate as an acceptor unit, was reported by Hwang et al. (Scheme 13).98 The optical Eg (1.55 eV) of P40 is slightly smaller than that (1.68 eV) of P15, suggesting that P40 has more extended conjugation and/or enhanced interchain π–π interactions due to the 2-D thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chains. The EHOMO and ELUMO of P40 were estimated to be at −5.31 and −3.76 eV, respectively. Upon adding the processing additive (3 v% DIO), the inverted device based on P40:PC71BM (1:1.5, in wt%) blend exhibited a Jsc of 14.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.77 V, and an FF of 0.68, leading to a PCE of 7.71%.
 Scheme 13  Chemical structures of P40–P41. 
Hou et al. also reported P41 incorporating the meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted BDT units.99 Compared to P37 with the alkylthienyl side chains, P41 exhibited a slightly larger Eg (1.7 eV) and a lower EHOMO level (−5.17 eV). The device based on the P41:PC71BM (1:1.5, in wt%) blend with 3 v% DIO as an additive exhibited a higher PCE of 7.5% due to the enhanced Voc of 0.78 V.
4. Multifused tetracyclic systems: naphthodithiophenes (NDTs)-based D–A copolymers
Tetracyclic naphthodithiophenes (NDTs), in which two thiophenes are fused at the ends of a naphthalene, have been used as key building blocks to make superior organic semiconductors owing to their coplanar cores to facilitate π-electron delocalization and π–π stacking for efficient charge transport. Recent NDT-containing polymers have produced high-performance PSCs and OFET. As acenedithiophenes systems (AcDTs), the NDT family contains different regioisomers including linear-fused NDT (lNDT) and angular-fused NDT (aNDT). Moreover, depending on the geometry of the fused thiophenes, aNDT can be further classified as α-aNDT and β-aNDT as shown in Scheme 14.
 Scheme 14  Chemical structures of lNDT, α-aNDT and β-aNDT. 
Takimiya and co-workers demonstrated that in comparison of lNDT counterparts, aNDT-based materials exhibit downshifted EHOMO levels which would lead to greater Voc values in solar cell devices. Besides, the conjugated geometry of NDTs strongly influences the charge mobility of polymers. The aNDT-based polymers possess higher ordered solid-state structures which are beneficial to promote efficient HOMO overlaps and improve charge carrier mobility. aNDT-containing P42 exhibited a high mobility of 0.77 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Scheme 15).100–103
 Scheme 15  The synthesis of P42 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
In 2012, a series of D–A copolymers P43, P44 and P45 synthesized by non-alkylated α-aNDT monomer 17 were first reported by Takimiya et al. for the application of PSCs (Scheme 16). Electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) or naphthobisthiadiazole (NT) units are chosen as the acceptors.104 The BT or NT units are sandwiched by two thiophenes substituted with branched 2-hexyldecyl (HD) and 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) side chains. Although P43 and P44 have the same backbone structure, P43 with shorter branched side chains showed limited solubility and thus a lower degree of polymerization (Mn = 17.0 kDa) and a smaller absorption coefficient. P43 showed an absorption maximum at 600 nm with a shoulder peak at 650 nm, whereas P44 showed a relatively blue-shifted λmax at 582 nm, implying the stronger aggregation ability of P43. The device based on the P43:PC61BM (1:2) blend showed a low PCE of 1.8%, with a Jsc of 7.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.60 V, and an FF of 0.42, while the P44:PC61BM (1:1) blend with the longer side chain and better solubility afforded a better PCE of 3.8% with a Jsc of 8.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V, and an FF of 0.64 (Table 4). On the other hand, P45 with NT as the electron acceptor (Scheme 16) showed broader absorption and a red-shifted λmax of 632 nm compared to P43 and P44 due to the stronger electron-deficient nature and the more rigid and planar structure of NT. According to the solid state absorption spectra, P43 and P44 showed the optical Eg of 1.7 eV, while the Eg of P45 is estimated to be 1.6 eV. Again, P45 with stronger electron-deficient NT units showed a lower-lying EHOMO of −5.25 eV relative to P43 and P44 with EHOMO of −5.15 eV. P45 exhibited a high field-effect mobility of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the device based on the P45:PC61BM (1:1) blend delivered a PCE of 5.5%, with a Jsc of 12.3 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.54.

The synthesis of monomer 17 is shown in Scheme 17.101,102,105 The regioselective chlorination at 1,5-positions of 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene (22) by sulfur oxychloride produced compound 23 which was further reacted with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride to give a key intermediate 24. The Sonogashira coupling reaction of compound 24 selectively occurred at the OTf sites over the Cl sites to afford 25. Intramolecular cyclization of 25 with Na2S·9H2O led to the formation of the two fused thiophenes in α-aNDT (26). Lithiation of 26 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and the sequential treatment with trimethyltin chloride yielded the monomer 17.
 Scheme 17  The synthetic route of monomer 17. 
The non-alkylated α-aNDT-based polymers generally suffer from poor solubility, which severely hinders its wet processability and limits its solar device performance. Very recently, a useful approach to selectively functionalize two alkyl chains at 5,10 positions of the α-aNDT (26) unit was first developed by Takimiya et al. in 2012.106 In 2013, they published two superior D–A semiconducting copolymers, P46 and P47, which were polymerized by reacting 5,10-didodecyl α-aNDT (27) monomer with dibromodithiophenyl-NT monomers (28 or 29) having two different alkyl chains (Scheme 18).107 The solubility of the polymers was thus substantially improved by the introduction of the alkyl chains at the NDT cores. P45 is soluble only in hot chlorobenzene (CB) or o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), whereas P46 and P47 can be soluble in chloroform, CB, and DCB at room temperature to 40 °C. The EHOMO values of P46 and P47 both were –5.22 eV, which are slightly higher-lying than that of P45 (–5.25 eV). It is implied that the electronic effect of the alkyl groups on the 5,10 positions of the α-aNDT core is insignificant. Furthermore, the polymer orientational order changed from edge-on to face-on to facilitate the out-of-plane charge transport after introducing the alkyl chains on the NDT cores. Consequently, the P46-based solar cells with a thick active layer (300 nm) using PC71BM as the n-type material (1:2) exhibited a high PCE of 8.2%, with a Jsc of 15.6 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V and an FF of 0.64. These results indicated that the 5,10-alkylated aNDT is a promising building block for constructing high-performance polymers for PSCs.

The synthesis of monomer 27 is shown in Scheme 19.106,107 Protection of compound 26 by the triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) groups to give compound 30. The central naphthalene moiety in 30 was selectively borylated to produce 31 in almost quantitative yield. Compound 31 was reacted with CuBr2 to give brominated 32. Under the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling condition, alkylation at the 5,10 positions of 32 proceeded to afford compound 33 in the presence of borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) and 1-dodecene. Finally, deprotection of the TIPS groups of 33 followed by the stannylation at 2,7 positions furnished the final monomer 27.
 Scheme 19  The synthetic route of monomer 27. 
In 2013, Li et al. reported a D–A copolymer P48 prepared by Stille copolymerization of a 4,9-dialkoxyl α-aNDT monomer 34 with a 1,3-dibromo-thienopyrrolodione 35 as an acceptor monomer (Scheme 20).108 Compared to the lNDT-based copolymer PNDTTPD109 with a PCE of 4.0% and a Voc of 0.69 V, the P48:PC71BM-based device (1:1) with 1 v% DIO additive demonstrated a higher PCE of 5.26%, with a higher Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.03 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.64 due to a lower-lying EHOMO level of –5.38 eV. Later on, Li et al. published two more 4,9-di(2-ethylhexyoxy) α-aNDT-based copolymers P49 and P50 using dibromodithienobenzothiadiazole (DTBT) (36) or dibromodithienobenzoxadiazole (DTBO) (37) as the acceptor comonomers.110 Two dodecyloxy side chains were introduced to the BT and BO units to guarantee good solubility of the polymers (Scheme 20). Compared with P49, P50 with the stronger electron-accepting BO unit possesses the deeper EHOMO and ELUMO and better intramolecular charge transfer in the conjugated backbone. As a result, the P50:PC71BM-based device (1.5:1) with 1 v% DIO additive showed a higher PCE of 5.07%, while a PCE of 3.22% was obtained for the P49:PC71BM (1:2) blend with 1 v% DIO.
 Scheme 20  The synthesis of P48, P49 and P50 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
Another two 4,9-di(2-ethylhexyoxy) α-aNDT-based alternating D–A copolymer copolymers P51 and P52 synthesized by the polymerization of 34 with dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) (38) and dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene (FTT) (39) monomers were reported by Lee and co-workers (Scheme 21).111 Due to the higher carrier mobility, the fluorinated polymer P52 exhibited better photovoltaic performance than the nonfluorinated polymer P51. As a result, the device based on the P52:PC71BM (1:2) blend with 3 v% DIO showed a PCE of 4.88%, with a Jsc of 13.52 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.71 V, and an FF of 0.51, while the device containing the P51:PC71BM (1:2) blend showed a PCE of 2.51%, with a Jsc of 11.99 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.55 V, and an FF of 0.38.
 Scheme 21  The synthesis of P51 and P52 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of the 4,9-dialkoxy α-aNDT monomer 34 is shown in Scheme 22.108,112 Lithiation of compound 40 followed by quenching with bis(2,2-diethoxyethyl) disulfide led to the formation of compound 41. Using polyphosphoric acid (PPA) as the catalyst, intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization–dehydration of 41 constructed the fused thiophenes in compound 42. Stannylation of 42 resulted in monomer 34.
 Scheme 22  The synthetic route of monomer 34. 
5,10-Dialkyl α-aNDT units and their corresponding copolymers have been developed and investigated by Takimiya and Osaka. However, the synthesis and molecular properties of the 4,9-dialkyl α-aNDT unit as well as 4,9-dialkyl β-aNDT and 5,10-dialkyl β-aNDT units have not been fully explored. The side-chain isomeric effect may determine the photophysical, orbital, and molecular packing properties. On the other hand, two different conjugated isomeric geometries, which are α-aNDT and β-aNDT units, are also worthwhile for in-depth investigation. Very recently, Cheng et al. presented a systematic strategy to implant lateral alkyl chains at inner 4,9 and outer 5,10 positions of α-aNDT and β-aNDT units, leading to the successful construction of the four isomeric aNDT-based structures.113 The regiospecific synthesis of inner and outer dialkylated aNDTs was accomplished through McMurry coupling and base-catalyzed 6π-cyclization of dieneyne moieties.
The synthetic route toward 47 and 52 is depicted in Scheme 23.113 Alkene compounds 44 and 49 with almost E-form olefinic configuration were synthesized by the McMurry coupling reactions of 43 and 48, respectively, using titanium tetrachloride and a reducing agent of Zn. The Sonogashira coupling conditions of 44 and 49 with 1-dodecyne afforded the dithiophenyl enediynes 45 and 50, respectively. The key reaction to synthesize the inner 4,9-didecyl-α-aNDT (46) and 4,9-didecyl-β-aNDT (51) involves the tandem base-induced 6π-cyclizations in the presence of diazabicycloundecene (DBU), which constructed the central naphthalene moieties with the alkyl chains specifically at the 4,9 positions. Finally, the double lithiation of 46 and 51 followed by treatment with Me3SnCl generated the monomer 47 and 52, respectively. The 4,9-didecyl α-aNDT and β-aNDT monomers are ready for polymerization with a variety of electron acceptors.
 Scheme 23  The synthetic routes of monomers 47 and 52. 
With a similar strategy (Scheme 24), olefinic products 55 and 60 with a dominating E-form configuration were also obtained by TiCl4/Zn McMurry coupling of 54 and 59, respectively. Again, the outer 5,10-didecyl-α-aNDT (57) and 5,10-didecyl-β-aNDT (62) momomers were constructed by the base-induced 6π-cyclizations followed by stannylation. The D–A copolymers prepared by the monomers and their solar cell performance will be reported in the due course.

5. Multifused pentacyclic systems
5.1 Indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based D–A copolymers
The tricyclic 2,7-fluorene unit has shown to be an excellent building block to construct D–A polymers having deep-lying EHOMO levels to achieve high Voc values for PSCs.114–116 However, the benzene-based fluorene-containing polymers usually possess relatively large optical Eg (>2 eV) values thus resulting in limited light-harvesting ability and photocurrents. Tricyclic thiophene-based 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) is another useful electron-rich building block for D–A copolymers.74,76,117–120 Despite the fact that the CPDT-based D–A copolymers exhibited low optical Eg and high hole mobilities to achieve large Jsc, the Voc values of the devices are generally below 0.65 V.
“Integration of the benzene and thiophene units into a single fused molecular entity could be a rational molecular design to improve Jsc and Voc simultaneously.” The pentacyclic indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit was first reported by Wong et al. in 2006.121 The extended conjugation and coplanarity make IDT a good building block for preparing D–A copolymers. IDT-based alternating copolymer P53 using benzothiadiazole (BT) as the acceptor was first synthesized (Scheme 25).122P53 possesses an optical Eg of 1.75 eV with a high absorption coefficient of 1.60 × 105 cm−1 in the solid state. The device using P53:PC71BM in the active layer delivered a PCE of 5.4% (Table 5). By solvent vapor annealing to optimize the active layer morphology, the device exhibited a highest PCE of 6.4% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67. This IDT-based copolymer represents one of the early successful polymers incorporating a ladder-type conjugated moiety.

Later on, Jen and co-workers reported two IDT-based polymers P54 and P55 incorporating 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and phenanthrenequinoxaline units as the electron-deficient acceptors, respectively (Scheme 26).123 Compared to the nonfused 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, the fused phenanthrenequinoxaline acceptor further increases the coplanarity and facilitates the intermolecular packing for charge transport. P55 showed a narrower Eg of 1.67 eV than P54 (1.81 eV) in a thin film. The device based on the P54:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a PCE of 5.69%. Furthermore, due to the fact that P55 possesses a lower Eg and preferred energy levels suitably matched with PC71BM, the device based on the P55:PC71BM (1:3) blend showed an increased PCE of 6.24% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.64. Notably, by using a C60 bis-adduct surfactant to modify the energy level alignment at the organic/cathode interface in a conventional BHJ device, the P55:PC71BM (1:3) blend device also exhibited a high PCE of 6.22%.124
 Scheme 26  Chemical structures of P54 and P55. 
The early reported IDT structures used two 4-hexylphenyl groups substituted on the sp3 carbons in the cyclopentadienyl moieties. These alkylaryl side chains close to the conjugated backbones are rather bulky, which will suppress the intermolecular interaction between the polymers. Using more flexible aliphatic side chains to the carbon bridges is a rational approach to circumvent this deficiency. Therefore, the IDT unit having more flexible dodecyl substituents was synthesized and copolymerized with electron-deficient units. Two IDT-based copolymers P56 and P57 synthesized by the Stille polymerization of 63 with 64 and 65 monomers, respectively, were reported by Li and co-workers (Scheme 27).125 The device based on the P56:PC71BM (1:2) blend exhibited a high PCE of 5.79% with a Jsc of 13.3 mA cm−2 and a high Voc of 0.89 V, while the device based on the P57:PC71BM (1:2) blend exhibited a higher PCE of 6.17% with a Jsc of 13.27 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V, and an FF of 56.9%.

The synthesis of monomer 63 is shown in Scheme 28.125 The Negishi coupling reaction of 66 with 67 resulted in 68. Compound 68 was hydrolyzed to form 69, which was then converted to 70 by oxalyl chloride. AlCl3-induced intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation of 70 afforded compound 71. The Wolff–Kishner reduction of the ketone groups in 71 led to the two methylene groups in compound 72. Alkylation of compound 72 afforded IDT (73) which was distannylated to form IDT monomer 63via brominated 74.

5.2 Indacenodiselenophene (IDS)-based D–A copolymers
Donor–acceptor copolymers incorporating selenophene moieties have recently emerged as promising photoactive materials considering the ability of selenophene to improve light harvesting, photostability and charge mobility of the polymers.126–129 Incorporation of the selenophene moiety into a ladder-type framework is of great interest in material development but synthetically less explored. Recently, Cheng et al. developed a new indacenodiselenophene (IDS) unit, a selenophene-based analogue of indacenodithiophene (IDT).130 The distannyl IDS-OC8 and IDS-C6 monomers having 4-octyloxyphenyl and 4-hexylphenyl side chains were prepared and copolymerized with 77 and 78 acceptors, respectively, to yield P58–P61 (Scheme 29). Similar molecular weights of P58 (10.7 kDa) and P60 (10.8 kDa), as well as P59 (11.5 kDa) and P61 (9.3 kDa), provide fair comparison of the side-chain effects on the molecular properties. It was found that the octyloxy (OC8) and hexyl (C6) side chains have a negligible influence on the optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers due to the fact that the side chains have no direct conjugation with the polymeric backbones. However, the solar cell performance is highly associated with the side chains of the polymers. Under similar device fabrication conditions, the P60:PC71BM (1:4) and P61:PC71BM (1:3)-based devices showed much improved efficiency than the corresponding P58:PC71BM (1:4), and P59:PC71BM (1:3)-based devices (2.6% and 1.9% vs. 3.8% and 3.9%). Consistently, P60 and P61 exhibited higher FET hole mobilities than the corresponding P58 and P59. These results revealed that the 4-hexylphenyl group is a better side chain than the 4-octyloxyphenyl group in the IDS system. Computational calculations showed that the octyloxy group in IDS-OC8 is nearly in-plane with the phenyl ring, whereas the hexyl group in IDS-C6 is out-of-plane with the phenyl ring. This structural variation might influence the molecular packing between the polymers. At the same time, Jen and coworkers also reported a similar alternating copolymer P61 using IDS-C6 as the donor and FBT as the acceptor segments.131 The effect of molecular weight on the properties of P61 was systematically examined. Higher molecular weight leads to higher mobilities as well as stronger absorptivity of polymer films. Consistently, the polymers with increasing molecular weights of 30, 46, and 62 kDa led to the enhanced solar cell efficiencies of 5.48%, 6.11% and 6.79%, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of achieving high molecular weight and selenium-containing polymers are promising for high-performance organic photovoltaics.
 Scheme 29  The synthesis of P58, P59, P60 and P61 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 75 and 76 is shown in Scheme 30.130 Compound 80 is an important intermediate which was synthesized by the Stille coupling of diethyl 2,5-dibromoterephthate (66) with 2-(tributylstannyl)selenophene (79). Double nucleophilic addition of the ester groups in compound 80 with 4-octyloxyphenyl magnesium bromide resulted in the two benzyl alcohols in 81. Under acidic conditions, intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization proceeded to give compound 82. This is the first example demonstrating that a selenophene moiety is able to undergo Friedel–Crafts cyclization at its 3-position. Finally, IDS-OC8 (82) was converted to the distannyl Sn-IDS-OC8 (75). The synthesis of Sn-IDS-C6 (76) monomer is similar. The only difference is that compound 80 was treated with 4-hexylphenyllithium to afford the corresponding IDS-C6 (83).

5.3 Diindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT)-based D–A copolymer
Another pentacyclic target is the diindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT) unit, where the central thiophene is connected with two outer benzene units through two embedded cyclopentadienyl (CP) moieties. Cheng and Hsu reported the detailed synthesis of the tetra-octyl DIDT molecule leading to its dibromo- and diboronic ester derivatives for the preparation of DIDT-based polymers. Accordingly, a donor–acceptor conjugated polymer P62 was prepared by the Suzuki coupling of DIDT monomer 84 with 65 (Scheme 31).132P62 exhibited a EHOMO of −5.36 eV with an optical Eg of 1.85 eV. However, the P62:PC71BM (1:2)-based device showed a PCE of 1.65% with a Voc of 0.7 V, a Jsc of 5.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 44%.
 Scheme 31  The synthesis of P62 by Suzuki coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 84 is shown in Scheme 32.132 Deprotonation of 1-indanone (85) by sodium hydride produced the enolate ions which underwent oxidative dimerization in the presence of CuCl2 to afford compound 86. The 1,4-diketone moiety in 86 reacted with Lawesson's reagent led to the formation of the central thiophene to obtain compound 87. Alkylations of 87 yielded DIDT (88), which was brominated regioselectively at the 2, 8 positions by Br2–FeCl3 reagent to form compound 89. Compound 89 was treated with n-butyl lithium followed by quenching with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane to afford the 2,8-diboronic DIDT (84) in 72% yield.
 Scheme 32  The synthetic route of monomer 84. 
5.4 Sila-indacenodithiophene (Si-IDT)-based D–A copolymers
Silicon possesses different steric and electronic nature compared with the carbon atom. The synthesis of sila-indacenodithiophene (Si-IDT), a silicon analogue of indacenodithiophene, has been independently reported by Jen133 and McCulloch.134,135 A silicon atom embedded into two aryl rings actually forms a five-membered silole unit that usually exhibits extraordinary molecular properties due to the σ*–π* conjugation.136 Therefore, the silole unit is a very attractive building block used to construct conjugated systems for optoelectronic applications. Si-IDT-based copolymers P63 and P64 were synthesized by the Stille polymerization of 90 with 77 and 65, respectively (Scheme 33). The optical Eg values were estimated to be 1.80 and 1.70 eV for P63 and P64. The silicon-bridged polymer P64 exhibited a high hole mobility of 0.012 cm2 V−1 s−1. The devices based on P63:PC71BM (1:3) or P64:PC71BM (1:3) blends exhibited PCEs of ca. 3.5%. At the same time, McCulloch also reported the synthesis of P63. The device based on P63:PC71BM (1:3.5) showed a slightly higher device efficiency of 4.3%.134

The synthesis of monomer 90 is shown in Scheme 34.133 The Suzuki coupling reaction of 1,4-dibromo-2,5-diiodobenzene (92) with 91 yielded compound 93. Tetrabromo 93 was first lithiated completely by n-BuLi and then quenched with dichlorodioctylsilane to produce the cyclized 94. The monomer 90 was obtained by the NBS bromination of 94 followed by the standard procedures of stannylation.

5.5 Germa-indacenodithiophene (Ge-IDT)-based D–A copolymer
It was found that sila-indacenodithiophene is unstable under basic conditions, which restricts it from using a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. However, it has been known that dithienogermole derivatives were stable under the basic conditions of a Suzuki coupling reaction due to the reduced polarization of the C–Ge bond compared to the C–Si bond.82 Heeney et al. reported a Ge-bridged IDT analogue and investigated the electronic and steric effects of the Ge-bridge. The germa-indacenodithiophene (Ge-IDT) monomer 95 was synthesized and thus polymerized with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) 96 by the Suzuki polymerization to afford P65 (Scheme 35).137 In contrast to the carbon analogue P53 without obvious crystallinity, P65 with four bulky 2-ethylhexyl groups exhibited semi-crystalline nature in the thin film XRD analysis. P65 showed an absorption maximum at 630 nm in the solution state, while it exhibited a main absorption peak at 644 nm with a shoulder at 596 nm in the solid state due to aggregation in thin films. The device based on the P65:PC71BM (1:4) blend showed a PCE of 5.02% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.58.

The synthesis of monomer 95 is depicted in Scheme 36.137 TMS protection of compound 97 formed the key intermediate 93. The germanium-bridged pentacyclic 98 was constructed by the lithiation of 93 to react with dibromodi(2-ethylhexyl) germane. The monomer 95 was obtained by the NBS bromination of compound 98.

5.6 Nitrogen-bridged benzodipyrrolothiophene (BDPT)-based D–A copolymers
A pentacyclic benzodipyrrolothiophene (BDPT) unit, where two outer thiophene rings are covalently fastened with the central phenylene ring by two nitrogen bridges, was also independently reported by McCulloch and Cheng.138,139 The coplanar distannyl BDPT building block was copolymerized with electron-deficient 77 and 100 monomers by the Stille polymerization to afford two alternating copolymers P66 and P67, respectively (Scheme 37). The bridging nitrogen makes the BDPT motif electron-rich and structurally coplanar. Strong photoinduced charge transfer along with dramatic band-broadening in the solid state and higher oxidation potential are characteristic of the BDPT-based polymers. P66 achieved the highest field-effect hole mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. The photovoltaic device using the P66:PC71BM blend (1:3) exhibited a Voc of 0.6 V, a Jsc of 10.34 mA cm−2, and an FF of 50%, leading to a PCE of 3.08%. Moreover, the device incorporating the P67:PC71BM (1:3) composite delivered a higher PCE of 3.72%. The enhanced performance comes from the lower-lying EHOMO value of P67, yielding a higher Voc of 0.72 V. The BDPT unit has a relatively higher-lying EHOMO which usually leads to a lower Voc value due to the electron-donating nature of the nitrogen atoms.
 Scheme 37  The synthesis of P66 and P67 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 99 is shown in Scheme 38.138 Reaction of 2,3-dibromothiophene (9) with n-BuLi followed by the treatment with zinc bromide produced 101 intermediate that underwent the Negishi coupling with compound 92 to afford 97. BDPT (102) was constructed by the Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 97 with an excess amount of 1-octylnonylamine in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst. The standard stannylation at the 2,7-positions of BDPT (102) resulted in the formation of monomer 99.
 Scheme 38  The synthetic route of monomer 99. 
5.7 Angular-shaped anti-anthradithiophene (aADT)-based D–A copolymer
Compared to pentacene, linear-fused anthradithiophene (lADT) derivatives possess many advantages, including easier functionalization, broader absorption window, and better chemical stability. Nevertheless, the polymers incorporating lADT units are seldom reported,140,141 because introducing two alkyl chains at the 5, 10 positions of lADT units is not sufficient to provide sufficient solubility of the resulting lADT-based polymers. Furthermore, the traditional synthesis of the linear-fused ADT inevitably obtained a mixture of syn- and anti-isomers with undefined molecular conformation.142–145 The devices using the lADT-based polymers have only shown PCE less than 1%.141 Recently, Cheng and Hsu et al. developed a facile synthesis to prepare an isomer-free angular-shaped anthradithiophene (aADT) with the introduction of four alkyl substituents at its 4, 5 and 10, 11 positions via Suzuki-coupling reactions.146 This 2,8-distannyl aADT monomer 103 was copolymerized with dibromodithienodiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) 104 to furnish an alternating donor–acceptor copolymer poly(anthradithiophene-alt-dithienoyldiketopyrrolopyrrole) P68 (Scheme 39).146 The device based on the P68:PC71BM (1:2.5) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 9.49 mA cm−2, a FF of 58.4%, delivering a PCE of 3.66%. By adding 1.5 v% 1-chloronaphthalene as a processing additive to optimize the morphology, the PCE can improve to 4.24%. The angular-shaped and dialkylated aADT-based polymers showed better PSC and field-effect transistor (FETs) characteristics than the linear-shaped ADT-containing polymers.
 Scheme 39  The synthesis of P68 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 103 is shown in Scheme 40.146 In the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, aADT (106) was successfully synthesized by the tandem Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of dialkyldiborylalkene (105) with 97. It is an efficient and useful strategy to construct the aADT (106) framework by concomitantly introducing four alkyl chains. The lithiation of aADT (106) by t-butyllithium followed by quenching with Me3SnCl afforded the monomer 103.
 Scheme 40  The synthetic route of monomer 103. 
A tetrathienoanthracene unit, an extended derivative of anthradithiophene, was also reported by Yu et al. The two-dimensional extended π-conjugated length induces stronger intermolecular π–π stacking. The tetrathienoanthracene monomer 107 was copolymerized with 108 to furnish P69147 (Scheme 41) which showed a Eg around 1.69 eV, a EHOMO of −5.04 eV and a ELUMO of −3.28 eV. By using chloroform with diiodooctane as a co-solvent system, the device based on P69:PC61BM (1:1) exhibited a PCE of 5.62%.
 Scheme 41  The synthesis of P69 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 107 is shown in Scheme 42.147 The Stille coupling of compound 105 with 110 yielded intermediate 111 which was further brominated to form compound 112. Iron trichloride-induced oxidative cyclization of 112 produced tetrathienoanthracene 113. The stannylation of 113 by a two-step n-BuLi/Me3SnCl method afforded the monomer 107.
 Scheme 42  The synthetic route of monomer 107. 
5.8 Dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based D–A copolymers
A pentacyclic dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) structure was developed by Hou and coworkers.148 Compared to the tricyclic BDT unit, the DTBDT structure has two additional fused thiophene rings (Scheme 43). A new poly(DTBDT-alt-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) P70 unit was prepared by the polymerization of 114 with 115. By using 3 v% diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive to improve the morphology, the device with P70:PC71BM (1:1) exhibited a PCE of 3.64%.
 Scheme 43  The synthesis of P70 and P71 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
Meanwhile, Yu and coworkers reported another synthetic route to prepare the DTBDT monomer 116 leading to polymer P71 structurally similar to P70 (Scheme 43).149 The structural difference is that the alkoxy groups in 114 and P70 were replaced by the alkyl groups in 116 and P71, and a fluoro atom was introduced to the thienothiophene unit in P71. P71 showed a high charge carrier mobility of 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 determined by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement. P71 exhibited a crystalline nature with a lamellar spacing of 15.4 Å and a π–π stacking distance of 4.0 Å. Consequently, the device using P71:PC71BM (1:1.2) delivered a much higher PCE of 7.6% with a Jsc of 13 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.87 V. It is noteworthy that the EHOMO levels for P770 and P71 are −5.15 eV and −5.24 eV, respectively. This result suggests that the alkoxy side chains with more electron-donating ability leads to the higher-lying EHOMO of the polymer and thus the lower Voc values of the device. This comparison again demonstrates the importance of side-chain engineering on the conjugated backbones.
The synthesis of monomer 114 is shown in Scheme 44.148 Compound 118 was brominated to obtain compound 119. The bromo atoms at the 2, 6 positions of 119 were selectively lithiated followed by the reaction with N-formylpiperidine to form 120. A cyclization reaction of compound 120 with ethyl mercaptoacetate led to the formation of two outer thiophene units in compound 121. The hydrolysis of 121 produced compound 122. The decarboxylation of 122 in Cu/quinoline furnished 123 which was stannylated to yield the monomer 114.
 Scheme 44  The synthetic route of monomer 114. 
On the other hand, another synthetic route of monomer 116 is shown in Scheme 45.149 In the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, compound 126 was synthesized by the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 124 with 125. The intramolecular cyclization of compound 126 with Eaton's reagent afforded compound 127. Bromination of 127 followed by n-BuLi/Me3SnCl produced the final monomer 116.
 Scheme 45  The synthetic route of monomer 116. 
5.9 Dithienogermolodithiophene-based D–A copolymers
A dithienogermolodithiophene unit 129 where two neighboring thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units are bridged by a dialkyl germanium moiety was reported by Heeney and coworkers (Scheme 46).150 The Stille polymerization of monomer 129 with 130 resulted in P72 with a Eg of 1.75 eV and a EHOMO of −5.68 eV. The drop cast films were investigated by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) before and after annealing at 140 °C. Both films displayed a broad diffraction peak at 24.7° (2θ) corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.6 Å as a result of the π–π stacking distance of the polymer backbones. The as-cast films also showed a peak around 4.6° owing to the lamellar packing of the polymer backbones. This lamellar peak intensity increases after annealing to increase polymer ordering. The polymer exhibited a saturated charge carrier mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device based on P72:PC71BM blends (1:2) afforded a PCE of 7.2% without the need of thermal annealing.
 Scheme 46  The synthesis of P72 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 129 is shown in Scheme 47.150 Compound 131 was lithiated by LDA at –78 °C to form the bromo-danced intermediate which was then oxidatively dimerized by the treatment with CuCl2 to afford 132. The dibromo 132 was dilithiated and then reacted with dibromobis(2-ethylhexyl) germane to yield the central germole unit in 133. NBS bromination of 133 followed by t-BuLi/Me3SnCl resulted in the distannylated monomer 129.
 Scheme 47  The synthetic route of monomer 129. 
5.10 Fused donor-acceptor-based copolymers
If neighboring electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor units along a polymer backbone are covalently locked into a coplanar interfused D–A entity, the electronic interactions between the donor and the acceptor unit in a D–A copolymer might increase. Nevertheless, polymers containing D–A fused frameworks have not been well investigated. Benzothiadiazole (BT), and quinoxaline (QX) units with moderate electron affinity are the most widely used acceptors.86 The benzothiadiazole unit connected with two electron-rich thienyl rings to form a nonfused D–A–D type 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole (DTBT) moiety has been commonly incorporated in the D–A polymers.151 Cheng et al. developed a fused D–A–D benzothiadiazolodithienopyrrole (BTDTP) structure in which the 3 position of two outer thiophenes (D) are covalently linked to the 5, 6 positions of the central benzothiadiazole core (A) by the nitrogen bridges (Scheme 48).152 The structure of BTDTP is a useful precursor to synthesize the quinoxalinodithienopyrrole (QXDTP) unit. The rigid and coplanar DTPBT120 and DTPQX121 building blocks were copolymerized with the fluorene monomer 137via the Suzuki coupling polymerization to afford two alternating copolymers P73 and P74, respectively.153 The D–π–A diaminobenzothiodiazole and diaminoquinoxaline chromophores in DTPBT and DTPQX segments induce internal charge transfer transitions upon photo-excitation, resulting in enhanced light-absorption ability in the UV region. The device based on P74:PC71BM (1:4) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 8.62 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.55, leading to a good PCE of 3.40% due to the lower-lying EHOMO level, and the highest hole-mobility of P74. The device using P73:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a PCE of 3.11%.
 Scheme 48  The synthesis of P73 and P74 by Suzuki coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of 135 and 136 monomers is shown in Scheme 49.152,153 Nitration of 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole (77) gave the 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzothiadiazole (138). Compound 140 was synthesized by the Stille coupling of 138 with 2-tributylstannyl thiophene (139). Double intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization of 140 in the presence of triethyl phosphate furnished the fused D–A–D structure 141. N-alkylation of 141 with an excess amount of 1-bromododecane and potassium hydroxide resulted in the formation of DTPBT (142) which was further brominated to yield monomer 135. Meanwhile, the thiadiazole ring in DTPBT was reduced by Zn/AcOH to generate the corresponding diamine intermediate 143, which underwent the imine condensation with benzyl to produce DTPQX (145) which was brominated to give the 136 monomer.

5.11 Multifused acceptor: thienopyridothieno isoquinolinedione (TPTI)-based D–A copolymers
Development of electron-deficient ladder-type conjugated structures is relatively rare. Ding et al. reported a pentacyclic multifused thiophene–phenylene–thiophene skeleton containing two embedded bislactam rings. This structure, also called thienopyridothieno isoquinolinedione (TPTI), is endowed with electron affinity due to the two electron-withdrawing lactam moieties (Scheme 50).154–156 At the same time, Kim et al. reported a similar isomer with an inversed amide arrangement in the thiophene–phenylene–thiophene structure and demonstrated its D–A copolymers for OFET.157
 Scheme 50  The synthesis of P75, P76, P77, P78, P79 and P80 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
Two D–A polymers P75154 and P76155 were polymerized by the Stille coupling reaction of the acceptor monomer TPTI (146) with thiophene (148) or selenophene (149) donor monomers. Both polymers possess narrow Eg values, deep-lying EHOMO values, and good charge carrier mobilities. The conventional P75:PC71BM (1:1) device with 3 v% DIO showed a high PCE of 7.21%, with a high Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 12.47 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.8%. Under the same optimized conditions, the inverted cells afforded a better PCE of 7.80%. Compared with the thiophene-based polymers, the selenophene-based polymers possess increased planarity, extended conjugation length, and reduced Eg due to the reduced aromaticity of selenophene. Consequently, P76 exhibited a high hole mobility of 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the P76:PC71BM device (1:1 with 3 v% DIO) demonstrated a PCE of 6.04%. At almost the same time, the other four D–A conjugated polymers (P77–P80)156 prepared by TPTI (146 and 147) monomers and BDT (150) or DTS (151) monomers were reported. Compared with the BDT-based polymers P77 and P78, the DTS-based P79 and P780 have better light-harvesting capability, lower Eg, but higher-lying EHOMO levels. Among the polymers, P77:PC71BM (1:1.6) showed the best photovoltaic device performance with a PCE of 5.30% due to its higher mobility.

TPTI monomer 146 with a 2-hexyldecyl side chain was synthesized according to a three-step route (Scheme 51).154 The amidation of N-alkyl thiophen-3-amines (152) with 2,5-dibromoterephthaloyl dichloride (153) generated precursor 154. Pd-catalyzed intramolecular C–H cyclization of 154 was carried out to construct the pentacyclic arene TPTI (155). NBS bromination of 155 afforded the monomer 146.
 Scheme 51  The synthetic route of monomer 146. 
6. Multifused hexacyclic systems
6.1 Dithienocyclopentathieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTCTT)-based D–A copolymers
A dithienocyclopentathieno[3,2-b]thiophene (156, DTCTT) hexacyclic unit was synthesized by Cheng et al. (Scheme 52).158 This structure actually consists of two connected cyclopentadithiophene (CDPT) units. This distannyl Sn-DTCTT 156 was copolymerized with electron-deficient acceptors 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 77 or 1,3-dibromo-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 130via the Stille polymerization, furnishing copolymers P81 and P82, respectively. A field-effect transistor using P81 yielded a high hole mobility of 0.053 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is among the highest performance based on the amorphous donor–acceptor copolymers. The device incorporating P82 having a lower-lying EHOMO delivered a higher Voc of 0.72 V and a PCE of 2.59% (Table 6).

At the same time, McCollough and coworkers reported a similar monomer using 4-hexylphenyl groups as the side chains and its corresponding BT-based copolymer P83 which showed a high FET mobility of 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device based on P83 exhibited a similar PCE of 2.5%.159
The synthetic route of the 156 monomer is shown in Scheme 53.158 2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (157) was reacted with ethyl-2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate (158) by the Stille coupling to obtain compound 159. Double nucleophilic addition of 4-(octyloxy)phenylmagnesium bromide to the ester groups of compound 159 led to the formation of tertiary alcohols in 160, which was subjected to intramolecular annulation through a Friedel–Crafts reaction to furnish the hexacyclic arene 161. 161 was lithiated by t-butyl lithium followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to afford the monomer 156.

6.2 Thieno[3,2-b]thienobis(silolothiophene)-based D–A copolymers
McCulloch and coworkers also reported the synthesis of a thieno[3,2-b]thienobis(silolothiophene) unit which is a silicon version of 161.160 A new donor–acceptor polymer P84 was synthesized by the Stille coupling of 162 and 78 monomers (Scheme 54). The EHOMO of the polymer P84 is ca. −5.1 eV. The device based on the P84:PC71BM (1:3.5) blend showed a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 14.07 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.52%.
 Scheme 54  The synthesis of P84 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 162 is shown in Scheme 55.160 The 3,6-dibromo-2,5-bis(3-bromothiophen-2-yl)-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (165) was synthesized by the Negishi coupling of compound 163 and (3-bromothiophen-2-yl)-zinc bromide (164). Lithiation of compound 165 by LDA followed by quenching with trimethyl silyl chloride yielded compound 166. After metal-bromo exchange of compound 166 by using t-butyl lithium, the tetra-lithiated intermediate underwent cyclization through double nucleophilic addition of dioctyldichlorosilane. Bromination of compound 167 generated compound 168. Compound 168 was stannylated to form the monomer 162.

6.3 DTBTBT-based D–A copolymer
A new tetradodecylthieno[3′,2′:6,7][1]benzothieno[3,2-b]thieno[3,2-g][1]benzothiophene (DTBTBT) monomer 169 was reported by McCulloch (Scheme 56). The Suzuki polymerization of 169 with monomer 96 afforded copolymer P85.161 The copolymer P85 with a coplanar backbone showed strong intermolecular interactions and a EHOMO of –5.2 eV. The device using P85:PC71BM (1:3) showed a PCE of 3.7% with a large Voc value of 0.92 V.

171 was synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the tetrabromo intermediate (165) with 170 (Scheme 57).161 Bromination of monomer 171 by NBS generated the final monomer 169.
 Scheme 57  The synthetic route of monomer 169. 
6.4 Diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DITT)-based D–A copolymer
The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit has been an appealing building block for high mobility p-type semiconductors. This structure possesses higher aromatic stabilization energy than a thiophene, which can potentially lower the HOMO level for higher Voc.162 Moreover, the C2h symmetry might induce ordered packing. Cheng et al. reported a multifused hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (176, DITT) unit, where the central TT ring is connected with two outer phenyl rings through two embedded cyclopentadienyl (CP) moieties (Scheme 58).163 This monomer 172 was polymerized by the Suzuki coupling with 65 to afford an alternating D–A copolymer P86. Note that the optical Eg of P62 is 1.85 eV which is lower than that of P86, suggesting that the TT unit in DITT may have higher aromaticity than the thiophene unit in DIDT. The device using the P86:PC71BM (1:4) blend delivered superior performance with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.71 mA cm−2, an FF of 58.4% with a PCE of 5.8% which greatly outperformed the P62-based device. The hole mobility of the P86:PC71BM blend is 1.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which might be responsible for its better Jsc, FF and photovoltaic performance.
 Scheme 58  The synthesis of P86 by Suzuki coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of 172 is shown in Scheme 59.163157 was reacted with 2-bromo-1-ethylbenzoate (173) by the Stille coupling to yield compound 174. Double nucleophilic addition of 4-(octyloxy)phenyl magnesium bromide to the ester groups of 174 formed 175. Compound 175 was subjected to Friedel–Crafts reaction to furnish the hexacyclic arene 176. Bromination of 176 by Br2/FeCl3 selectively occurred at 2,8 positions to afford 177. The metal-bromo exchange of 177 with n-butyl lithium followed by quenching with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane afforded monomer 172.

6.5 Dithienocyclopentanaphthalene (DTCN)-based D–A copolymers
A ladder-type dithienocyclopentanaphthalene (DTCN) was designed and synthesized by Zheng et al. DTCN monomer 178 was polymerized with 179 to give P87 by the Stille coupling reaction (Scheme 60).164P87 exhibited a space-charge limit current (SCLC) hole mobility of 2.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device based on P87:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a PCE of 4.8% with a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V, and an FF of 54%. Furthermore, the inverted device based on the P87:PC71BM (1:2) blend showed a higher PCE of 5.0%.

The synthesis of 178 is shown in Scheme 61.164 Treatment of 180 with oxalyl chloride followed by the AlCl3-induced intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation yielded the hexacyclic arene 181. Compound 182 was synthesized by the Wolff–Kishner reduction of 181. Alkylation of compound 182 with 2-ethylhexyl bromide yielded compound 183. The stannylation of 183 afforded the monomer 178.

7. Multifused heptacyclic systems
7.1 Carbon, silicon, nitrogen atoms and ethylene as bridges for dithienofluorene-, dithienocarbazole-, and dithienosilafluorene-based heptacyclic arenes and their D–A copolymers
Alternating copolymers, poly(2,7-fluorene-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PFDTBT)165 and poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT),166 were the early developed p-type photoactive materials for the application in PSCs. Cheng and Hsu et al. reported two D–A copolymers poly(fluorenedicyclopentathiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) P88 and poly(carbazoledicyclopentathiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) P89 (Scheme 62).167 Both polymers were designed based on the skeletons of the PFDTBT and PCDTBT polymers. The structural uniqueness of P88 and P89 is that the 3 position of two outer thiophenes are covalently fastened with the 3,6 positions of central fluorene or carbazole cores by the carbon bridges, forming two cyclopentadienyl (CP) moieties embedded in a heptacyclic structure. The optical Eg values are determined to be 1.76 eV for P88 and 1.66 eV for P89. These results suggest that the donating strength of carbazole is stronger than that of the fluorene moiety. P88 and P89 have more red-shifted absorption spectra and smaller Eg in comparison with their corresponding non-fused PFDTBT (Eoptg = 1.87 eV) and PCDTBT (Eoptg = 1.88 eV) analogues. The HOMO levels were estimated to be −5.32 eV for P88 and −5.38 eV for P89. Without extensive optimization, the preliminary photovoltaic performance based on the P88:PC71BM (1:2) blend already showed a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.77 V, and an FF of 0.38, leading to a decent PCE of 2.8% while the device using the P89:PC71BM (1:2) blend delivered a better performance with a Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, and an FF of 0.43, improving the PCE to 3.7% (Table 7). Because two 4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl moieties substituted at the carbon atoms of the CP rings dilute intermolecular interactions, the profiles of absorption spectra of P88 and P89 are essentially unchanged from the solution state to solid state. To improve the intermolecular interaction, the CDCT (197) structure was modified by replacing the branch ethylhexoxyphenyl groups with more flexible octyl groups. A D–A copolymer, poly(carbazoledicyclopentathiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) P90, was thus synthesized.168 Compared to P89 showing the absorption maxima at 412 nm and 607 nm in the thin film, P90 exhibited red shifts of the absorption maxima at 425 nm and 645 nm. These phenomena clearly indicated that the flexible aliphatic side chains indeed are capable of enhancing inter-chain π–π stacking interactions in the solid state. The device based on the P90:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, and an FF of 60%, delivering a PCE of 4.6%. Similarly, the FDCT (196) structure in P88 was also modified with the more flexible octyl groups to afford P91.169 The optical Eg of P91 was determined to be 1.71 eV, which is narrower than that of P88 (1.76 eV). P91 exhibited a high field-effect hole mobility of 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of P88 (1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) by an order of magnitude. The solar cells with inverted architecture were fabricated based on the configuration of ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/P91:PC71BM (1:3)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag, where C-PCBSD is a cross-linked fullerene interlayer.170,171 By inserting a solution-processed vanadium oxide (VOx) film on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, a high PCE of 7% was achieved.

Two new heptacyclic silicon-bridged dithienosilolo-carbazole (DTSC) and nitrogen-bridged dithienopyrrolo-carbazole (DTPC) structures were developed172 to polymerize with the benzothiadiazole acceptor, leading to two alternating D–A copolymers poly(dithienosilolo-carbazole-alt-benzothiadiazole) (P92) and poly(dithienopyrrolo-carbazole-alt-benzothiadiazole) (P93). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P93 and P92 were determined to be −4.76/−3.29 eV and −5.35/−3.58 eV with the corresponding Eg of 1.47 and 1.77 eV, respectively. It has been known that silole unit possesses a certain extent of electron-accepting ability which in turn lowers the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P92. In contrast, the stronger electron-donating ability of the nitrogen moiety will increase the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P93. N-bridged P93 exhibited the most bathochromic shift of the absorption ICT maximum at 742 nm in the toluene solution, whereas Si-bridged P92 exhibited the most hypsochromic shift absorption maximum at 590 nm. Furthermore, the optical band-gaps (Eoptg) deduced from the absorption edges of thin film spectra are in the following order: P92 (1.83 eV) > P90 (1.64 eV) > P93 (1.50 eV).
The annealed P93 FET device showed a hole mobility of 8.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on–off ratio of 4.0 × 102. The devices of P92 and P90 exhibited higher hole mobilities of 0.073 and 0.110 cm2 V−1 s−1 with good on–off ratios of 1.1 × 106 and 1.7 × 104 under the optimal conditions, respectively. The device based on the P93:PC71BM (1:2) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.50 V, a Jsc of 10.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 49.9%, delivering a PCE of 2.6%. The device using P92:PC71BM (1:3) blend delivered a superior performance with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2, a FF of 56.7%, improving the PCE to 5.2%.
The monomers 184–189 and the polymerization reactions for the preparation of the corresponding P88–P93 are shown in Scheme 63, and the synthetic routes of the 184 and 185 monomers are shown in Scheme 64.167
 Scheme 63  The synthesis of P88–P93 by Stille coupling or Suzuki coupling polymerization. 
 Scheme 64  The synthetic route of monomers 184 and 185. 
Compounds 192 and 193 were obtained by the Suzuki coupling of ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate (158) with 2,7-diboronic esters fluorene 190 and carbazole 191, respectively. Nucleophilic addition of 192 and 193 with 4-(2-ethylhexyloxy) phenyl magnesium bromide led to 194 and 195 which underwent intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reaction to produce 196 and 197. The carbazole-based 197 was lithiated by t-butyl lithium followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to afford the distannyl monomer 185. Nevertheless, the fluorene-based 196 was brominated to generate compound 198 which was then lithiated to obtain the distannyl monomer 184.
The synthesis of 186 is shown in Scheme 65.168 In a similar strategy to prepare 185, the synthesis of 186 with octyl side chains was obtained via199 and 200. The only difference is to use octyl Grignard reagent for preparing 199. It should be noted that a small amount of dehydration product resulting from the tertiary alcohols was also obtained during the formation of 200.168
 Scheme 65  The synthetic route of monomer 186. 
On the other hand, the synthesis of fluorene-based 187 with alkyl chains is shown in Scheme 66.169 Two carboxylic acids in compound 201 were converted to acid chlorides to afford 202. Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation of 202 afforded the multifused heptacyclic arene 203. The two carbonyl groups in compound 203 were reduced to the methylene groups in compound 204 by the Wolff–Kishner reaction. Alkylation of compound 204 yielded compound 205, which was then brominated to afford the monomer 187.
 Scheme 66  The synthetic route of monomer 187. 
The synthetic routes of the 188 and 189 monomers are shown in Scheme 67.172 The palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling between 2,7-diboronic esters carbazole (206 and 191) and 3-bromo-2-iodothiophene (207) afforded compound 208 and 209, respectively. Due to the nitrogen-directing effect, bromination of compound 208 and 209 by NBS regioselectively occurs at 3- and 6-positions of the carbazole to obtain tetra-brominated key intermediates 210 and 211. Compound 210 was lithiated by LDA followed by quenching with trimethylsilyl chloride to yield compound 212. After metal-bromo exchange of compound 212 by n-BuLi, the tetra-lithiated intermediate was subjected to double nucleophilic addition of dioctyldichlorosilane to obtain 213. Bromination of 213 resulted in the formation of monomer 188. In the meantime, the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 211 with 2-ethylhexyl amine resulted in the formation of 214. 214 was stannylated to afford the monomer 189.
 Scheme 67  The synthetic routes of monomers 188 and 189. 
The carbon, silicon, and nitrogen-bridged atoms are all sp3-hybridized. Two geminal side chains on the tetrahedron carbon and silicon atoms will stick out of the conjugation plane and thus exert steric hindrance to suppress the intermolecular interaction. It is of interest to bridge the central carbazole and two outer thiophene rings by sp2–sp2 CC ethylene moieties to form two embedded benzene rings. A highly planar heptacyclic structure, dithienobenzocarbazole (215, DTBC), with four aliphatic side chains on the sp2-carbons to promote adequate solubility was reported (Scheme 68).173 On the basis of the 215 unit as an electron-rich donor to polymerize with the 65, an alternating donor–acceptor copolymer poly(dithienobenzo-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (P94) was furnished. The device using the P94:PC71BM (1:1.5) blend has produced a high PCE of 6.2%, which outperforms the corresponding sp3-hybridized DTCC-based, DTSC-based and DTPC-based copolymers.
 Scheme 68  The synthesis of P94 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of 215 is shown in Scheme 69.173 Lithiation of 1-decyne (216) followed by reaction with 1-bromooctane generated 9-octadecyne (217). The Pt-catalyzed syn-diborylation of bis(pinacolato)diboron with 217 afforded dioctyl-bis(pinacolatoboryl)alkene 105. Reaction of 211 with 105via the tandem Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling yielded 218. The benzoannulation is accompanied by the introduction of four aliphatic side chains to ensure sufficient solubility. The length of alkyl chains can be adjustable depending on the preparation of dialkyldiborylalkene materials.
 Scheme 69  The synthetic route of monomer 215. 
Structurally similar to P88 having fluorene embedded in the heptacyclic unit, a new silafluorene-containing counterpart was reported by Luscombe et al. and copolymerized with benzothiadiazole 77 to afford P95 with a EHOMO of −5.32 eV (Scheme 70).174 The devices based on the P95:PC61BM (1:3.5) blend exhibited a high Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 8.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 56%, delivering a PCE of 4.2%.
 Scheme 70  The synthesis of P95 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of 219 is depicted in Scheme 71.174 Acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction of the tertiary alcohols in 220 generated 221 which was then brominated by NBS to afford compound 222. 222 was stannylated to form the monomer 219.
 Scheme 71  The synthetic route of monomer 219. 
7.2 Benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (BDCPDT)-based D–A copolymers
A heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (223, BDCPDT) unit containing two outer CPDT units that share two thiophene rings with the central BDT core was reported by Cheng et al.175 The distannyl BDCPDT building block 223 was copolymerized with 130 by the Stille polymerization to afford a new alternating copolymer P96 (Scheme 72). The forced planarization greatly suppresses the interannular twisting to extend the effective conjugated length and preserve the interactions between the donor and acceptor segments. The device using the P96:PC71BM (1:3) blend processed with dimethyl sulfoxide as an additive delivered a high PCE of 6.6% which represents a significant enhancement compared to the device using the corresponding nonfused polymer P97 with a PCE of 0.2%.176 This example again suggests that chemical planarization is a useful strategy to improve molecular properties of p-type conjugated polymers.
 Scheme 72  The synthesis of P96–P98 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
On the other hand, the 223 monomer was also polymerized with 224 acceptor to produce P98177 which exhibited a high hole mobility and complementary absorption coverage to P3HT. An inverted cell using the P98:PC71BM (1:3) blend exhibited a high PCE of 5.76% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 12.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.5%. The inverted tandem device on the basis of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:IC60BA(1:1)/m-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/P98:PC71BM(1:3)/MoO3/Ag achieved a Voc of 1.62 V leading to a PCE of 7.08%, which performed superiorly than their individual subcells. The Voc of 1.62 V is among one of the highest values ever reported.177 The synthesis of monomer 223 is shown in Scheme 73.175 2,6-Trimethylstannyl BDT (225) was reacted with ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate (158) by the Stille coupling to afford compound 226. Similarly, Grignard nucleophilic addition followed by Friedel–Crafts cyclization formed the compound 228 which was stannylated to yield the monomer 223.
 Scheme 73  The synthetic route of monomer 223. 
7.3 Indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based (IDTT) D–A copolymers
Cheng et al. reported another heptacyclic indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene arene (229, IDTT) unit (Scheme 74).178 The central phenylene of 229 is covalently fastened with the two outer thieno[3,2-b]thiophene rings. This coplanar 229 monomer was copolymerized with electron-deficient acceptors 77, 78, 224 and 130 monomers via Stille polymerization to produce P99–P102, respectively. Because the higher content of the thienothiophene moieties in the 229 structure facilitates π-electron delocalization, these new polymers show much improved light-harvesting abilities and enhanced charge mobilities compared to P86 using hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (176) as the donor moieties. The device using P99:PC71BM (1:4) exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%. Meanwhile, the device using the P100:PC71BM (1:4) blend exhibited a greater Voc value of 0.9 V and a larger Jsc of 10.08 mA cm−2, improving the PCE to 4.2%. The enhanced Voc is attributed to the lower-lying of EHOMO of P100 as a result of the electron-withdrawing effect caused by the fluorine atoms. A highest PCE of 4.3% for the device incorporating the P102:PC71BM (1:4) blend was obtained.
 Scheme 74  The synthesis of P99–P102 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
Meanwhile, Jen and coworkers also reported a copolymer P101 similar to the P100, except that the side chains on the bridging carbons in P101 are the 4-hexylpheny groups.179 The device based on the P101:PC71BM (1:3) blend showed a higher PCE of 7.03% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 12.21 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.61 without using any additives or post-solvent/thermal annealing processes. Like that of P58–P61, these studies also demonstrated that the IDTT-based polymers with different side chains (hexylphenyl vs. octyloxyphenyl groups) result in different molecular packing and thereby the device performance. In a similar synthetic route described previously, the synthesis of monomer 229 is shown in Scheme 75.178
 Scheme 75  The synthetic route of monomer 229. 
8. Nonacyclic and undecyclic arene-based D–A copolymers
If the 3,7 positions of the DIDT (88) unit in P62 are covalently rigidified with the 3 position of two adjacent thiophene rings by the carbon bridges, an alternate thienyl-phenylene-thienylene-phenylene-thienyl (234, TPTPT) nonacyclic arene will be generated (Scheme 76). Cheng and Hsu et al. reported the synthesis of the 234 monomer which was copolymerized with monomer 77 to afford an alternating D–A copolymers P103 (Scheme 77).180 It should be emphasized that P103 showed significantly red-shifted absorption maximum in comparison with its corresponding non-fused P78 analogue (444 vs. 415 nm for the localized transition and 628 vs. 544 nm for the ICT transition in chloroform solution), demonstrating that the effective conjugated length of the coplanar donor is increased and electron coupling between the rigidified donor and the acceptor units is substantially enhanced. Despite the amorphous nature in thin films, P103 showed good hole transporting properties due to their rigid and coplanar structures. P103 exhibited higher hole mobilities of 5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 by SCLC measurement, compared to P62 with 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device using the P103:PC71BM (1:4) blend delivered superior performance with a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, an FF of 61%, and an exceptional PCE of 5.3%, which outperformed the device based on the non-fused P103:PC71BM (1:2) blend by 3-fold. The inverted device incorporating the P103:PC71BM (1:4) blend further achieved a high PCE of 5.9% with Jsc = 12.10 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.76 V and FF = 64%.

The synthesis of monomer 234 is shown in Scheme 78.180 Compound 235 was converted to 236 which underwent Friedel–Crafts cyclization to furnish the nonacyclic arene 237. Bromination of 237 by NBS generated 238. The stannylation of 238 afforded the monomer 234.
 Scheme 78  The synthetic route of monomer 234. 
A semi-ladder polymer P104 using the indacenodithiophene-biscyclopentadithiophene (239, IDTCPDT) as a donor unit was reported by Jen et al. (Scheme 79).181 A reference polymer P105 which has two thiophene spacers without being fused between indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (240, IDTT) and difluorobenzothiadiazole (241) was also synthesized for comparison. The Eg deduced from the absorption onset of a polymer thin film spectra are 1.77 eV and 1.59 eV for P105 and P104, respectively. Compared with P105, P104 showed significantly red-shifted absorption in a thin film due to the stronger electron-donating ability of the 239 unit as well as increased effective conjugation length and reduced rotational disorder of the polymer chains. The device using the P104:PC71BM (1:2.5) blend delivered a higher PCE of 6.46% than that of the P105:PC71BM (1:2.5) blend as a result of the effect that chemical rigidification of the 239 unit increases the Jsc of the device based on the corresponding polymer (10.40 mA cm−2 for P105, 14.59 mA cm−2 for P104).
 Scheme 79  The synthesis of P104–P105 by Stille coupling polymerization. 
The synthesis of monomer 239 is shown in Scheme 80.181 Treatment of compound 242 with n-BuLi followed by reaction with zinc chloride generated intermediate 243 that underwent the Negishi coupling with compound 158 to afford compound 244. Nucleophilic addition reaction of 244 with p-hexylphenyllithium and a subsequent Friedel–Crafts cyclization generated 245 which was then stannylated to form the 239 monomer.

9. Conclusions
Although ladder-type conjugated polymers are a unique class of organic materials that have received great interest over the past decades, complete rigidification and planarization of the conjugated backbones make the resulting materials insoluble, hindering their practical applications. To impart p-type conjugated polymers with broad and strong absorption ability for solar cell applications, incorporation of electron deficient units into the polymer backbone to form donor–acceptor copolymers is necessary. Structurally well-defined ladder-type small molecules emerge as promising conjugated frameworks that can suitably act as electron-rich donor monomers. Copolymerization of such monomers with acceptors leads to various semi-ladder donor–acceptor copolymers which possess not only solution-processability but also advantageous properties resulting from chemical planarization. Through molecular engineering to assemble various building blocks via well-designed synthetic methodologies, a series of multifused ladder-type small molecules flanked with aliphatic side chains has been created. Thiophene, selenophene and benzene units are usually the basic components of the conjugated backbones. Thiophene units are preferably installed at two ends of the molecules due to the facile functionalization (bromination or stannylation) at the α-carbons of thiophene for metal-catalyzed polymerization. Side chains can be directly functionalized on the sp2-carbons of benzene and/or β-carbons of the thiophene units. Five-membered rings such as cyclopentadiene, silole, germole, pyrrole units are also important components to be embedded into the ladder-type frameworks. The bridging carbon, silicon, germanium, nitrogen atoms have the additional valences to introduce alkyl chains for sufficient solubility. Meanwhile, these heteroatoms with different electronic and steric natures allows for fine-tuning the molecular properties and tailoring the molecular functions. The development of ladder-type structures associated with the concept of chemical rigidification/planarization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy to improve light harvesting, charge transportation and molecular packing, leading to the enhancement of solar cell device performance. Most of the D–A copolymers in this review were prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling polymerization using difunctional stannyl aromatic monomers. The synthesis and purification of tin compounds can be tedious and costly. Furthermore, stannylated derivatives and the resulting stannyl-containing byproducts are environmentally toxic and hazardous. To improve the synthetic efficiency of polymerization, transition-metal-catalyzed direct arylation utilizing unsubstituted aryl monomers in combination with the corresponding dihalo aryl components could be the focus of future research.
In this review, we have summarized the recent development of the semi-ladder donor–acceptor conjugated polymers. These synthetic advances towards the preparation of the ladder-type conjugated frameworks have paved the important way for exploring high-performance solar cell materials.
