Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, the device using the RuLF sensitizer gave a conversion efficiency of 7.28%, compared to 7.50% optimized for the N719 dye. The power-conversion efficiency of RuLF is 24% and 66% higher than those of RuLN and RuLC, respectively, due to a remarkable fluoro-substitution effect. The origins of this effect have been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic, electrochemical, and density functional theory (DFT) studies. Our results show the fluoro-substitution serves as the key factor for improving the device performance, the role of which is to increase the dye density on TiO2, alter the molecular packing, and tune the electron donating property. These findings may provide an alternative strategy for the design of a new type of ruthenium sensitizer by the introduction of C–F bonds to the auxochromic ligand to improve the device performance.IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent one of the most promising candidates for developing new renewable energy sources due to their low cost and high efficiency.1–3 A conversion efficiency of up to 12% has been achieved by using Ru(II)-based sensitizers, which has inspired new molecular engineering of different types of Ru(II) complexes to obtain better cell performance.4–7 One important type of Ru(II) complex, namely the family of heteroleptic Ru(H2dcbpy)(L′)(NCS)2 (H2dcbpy = 4, 4′-dicarboxylic acid-2, 2′-bipyridine) is of particular interest owing to its dual functions: (i) containing the anchoring H2dcbpy ligand which is responsible for the complex adsorption onto the semiconductor surfaces; and (ii) incorporating the auxochromic ancillary ligand L′ which is not directly attached onto the semiconductor but can be used to tune the overall properties of the complexes. This type of structural model provides a facile molecular engineering approach to design diversified metal-complex sensitizers with high conversion efficiencies just by modifying the ancillary ligand. Also, in most studies, the Ru(II) complexes containing 1,10-phenanthroline-based ancillary ligands have received little attention,8–12 although Yin and Lin et al. have prepared a Ru(II)-sensitizer with an unusually high power-conversion efficiency by modifying 1,10-phenanthroline with a thiophene moiety.11On the other hand, F-containing compounds have attracted much interest due to their specific features and properties, as well as their wide applications in numerous cutting-edge fields.13–15 The potential benefits of fluorinated complexes relate to the halogen atom properties such as high electronegativity and can be summarized as follows: (i) fluorination of the C–H bonds can make the compounds sublime better for thin film deposition;16a,b (ii) introduction of a C–F bond can alter the molecular packing and minimize the self-quenching behavior;16a (iii) fluorination sometimes enhances the electron mobility of the complex;16a–c and (iv) HOMO and LUMO levels can be modified by fluorination, thus allowing the optimization of the carrier injection.16a,d Despite the fact that F-containing complexes possess so many unique features, investigation of the F-substituted compounds acting as a key component in DSSCs is so far scarce.6,17 Recently, Chen and Chou et al. reported a series of organic D-π-A dyes with high absorptivity suitable for the fabrication of all solid-state DSSCs, and found that the dye possessing a key F-substitution can render the highest conversion efficiency.17a This finding suggests that F-substitution will play an important role in improving cell performance. Unfortunately, the study of the fluoro-substitution effect on Ru(II) complexes, especially on the ancillary ligand which is able to easily tune the overall properties of the sensitizer, still remains in its infancy.Combining the above considerations, we envisage that the design of Ru(H2dcbpy)(L′)(NCS)2 type Ru(II)-sensitizers by functionalizing the 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligand with an F-substituent may provide a promising route to improving cell efficiency. To test this concept, we synthesized three Ru(II) photosensitizers (Scheme 1 and S1, ESI†), RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC, using a one-pot synthetic procedure (synthetic details in ESI†). The results indicate that the device performance with F-substituted RuLF as the sensitizer is significantly higher than those of RuLN and RuLC, which contain electron donating substituents. The origins of the performance diversity among these devices have been extensively studied with respect to power-conversion efficiency by various electrochemical and photochemical spectroscopies, implying a salient fluoro-substitution effect on the ancillary ligand. Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the dyes RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC. ExperimentalGeneral methodsAll reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. The solvents were dried over sodium or calcium hydride and distilled before used. The ligands 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (LF), 4-(1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthrolin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (LN), and 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (LC) were prepared according to the procedures listed in the experimental section in the ESI.†Physical methods1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Mercury-Plus 300FT-NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d6. MS data were obtained using a LCQ DECA XP liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer. Emission spectra were measured using a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Vario EL Element Analyzer. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded using a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer with FTO as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. CVs of the dyes in DMF (1 mM) were measured with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. The scan rate was maintained at 50 mV s−1 for all compounds. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the ruthenium complexes obtained from the theoretical calculations were coupled with the redox potentials obtained from the cyclic voltammetry measurements as shown in the main text.Synthesis of Ru(LF)(dcbpyH2)(SCN)2 (RuLF)Hydrated ruthenium trichloride (104 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (125 mg, 0.4 mmol) were heated at 80 °C in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under a N2 atmosphere. The H2dcbpy (97.6 mg, 0.4 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was heated to 160 °C under nitrogen for 12 h with constant stirring in darkness. Then an excess of NH4SCN (760 mg, 10 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture continued for another 12 h at 130 °C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and was filtered, water was then added to the resulting slurry, and the insoluble product was collected and washed with distilled water. The crude product was dissolved in DMF and allowed to crystallize by slow diffusion of diethyl ether. Then the product was washed with a small amount of methanol to remove the DMF.

The paste fabrication process was carried out according to a previous paper.18a Briefly, TiO2 powder (20 nm) (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in a mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g), and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, to finally form a viscous white TiO2 paste. The thickness of the films (21 μm) can be easily controlled through repeating the screen-printing process. Afterwards, a heating process (at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic substances was used. The as-prepared TiO2 nanostructured films (TiO2/FTO) were soaked in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, which improved the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. After 30 min, the TiO2 films were washed with water and ethanol and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiCl4 treated TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM DMF and ethanol (v:v = 1:1) solution of the Ru complex dye and kept at room temperature for 16 h. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.16 cm2, which was measured by profilometer (AMBIOS, XP-1).The dye-sensitized TiO2/FTO films were sandwiched together with Pt coated FTO glass which was used as a counter electrode. The platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by the thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min. The electrolyte was injected into the space between the sandwiched cells.Dye-loading measurementsThe dye loading measurements on the TiO2 films were carried out by desorbing the dye into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in H2O and then measuring the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the resultant solution with the same dilution. The adsorbed density of each dye was calculated from the difference in concentration of each solution before and after the TiO2 film immersion.Characterization of DSSCsThe current–voltage characteristics were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination provided by a solar simulator (69920, 1 kW Xe lamp with optical filter, Oriel). The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) with a frequency range from 10 mHz to 1000 kHz. The magnitude of the alternating signal was 10 mV. The impedance measurements were carried out under a forward bias of −0.7 V in the dark.Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Zennium) and were performed under a modulated LED light (457 nm) driven by a source supply (ZAHNER, PP210). The illumination intensity ranged from 30 to 150 mW cm−2. The light intensity modulation was 20% of the base light intensity over the frequency range of 10−1–103 Hz.The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a monochrometer.Computational methodThe Density Functional Theory (DFT) method was employed for ground state geometry optimizations. The Becke, Three-Parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr functional (B3LYP) functional was used to evaluate the exchange and correlation energy. The basis set def2-TZVP was assigned to all the atoms. The quasirelativistic Stuttgart/Dresden semicore (SDD-ECP) was used for the ruthenium atom. Solvation effects were included using the implicit solvent model COSMO with a dielectric constant for dimethylformamide (DMF) at 38.25. The vertical singlet to singlet transitions were calculated with time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) using the same basis sets and exchange–correlation functional as for the ground-state calculations. All the calculations were performed by TURBOMOLE software.Results and discussionThe UV-vis absorption spectra of RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC recorded in DMF are shown in Fig. 1a, and the optical data are summarized in Table 1. The spectrum of RuLF shows two UV bands centered at 350 and 302 nm, and one broad band with maximum at 470 nm and a shoulder at 512 nm in the visible region (see inset in Fig. 1). By comparing this spectrum with those of the free ligands LF and H2dcbpy (Fig. S1, ESI†), it is easy to conclude that the two UV bands are assignable to the intraligand π–π* transitions of H2dcbpy and LF.9 The broad low energy band is characteristic of the MLCT absorption contributed by both metal-to-anchoring-ligand (H2dcbpy) and metal-to-ancillary-ligand (LF) transitions,19 which is one of the dominant factors for determining the efficiency of photosensitizers. Under the same conditions, the maxima of the MLCT bands of RuLN and RuLC only appear at 514 and 512 nm respectively, showing obviously narrowed peaks relative to that in RuLF and implying that the metal-to-anchoring-ligand (H2dcbpy) and metal-to-ancillary-ligand (LN or LC) transitions are not distinguishable in RuLN and RuLC.9 Such a difference in MLCT adsorptions of the three sensitizers results from their different substituents on the ancillary ligand. In contrast to the electron donating N,N′-dimethyl and methyl groups in LN and LC, the strong electron withdrawing F group in LF is known to have a blue shift effect,19 thus making the metal-to-ancillary-ligand band move to a higher frequency and leading to an overall broader MLCT band of RuLF compared with those of RuLN and RuLC. All these observations clearly demonstrate that the electronic transitions of Ru(H2dcbpy)(L′)(NCS)2 have been tuned by the choice of remote substituent X.

When adsorbed on TiO2 in DMSO solution, N3 very slightly shifted its absorption bands to higher energies, indicating only weak electronic coupling between the complex and the TiO2.23 In addition, the amount of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface is shown in Table 1. The dye loading amount of RuLF is higher than that for RuLN and RuLC, which may be due to a weak interaction between the LF ancillary ligand and the –OH group on the TiO2 surface (C–F⋯H–O).17d For RuLN, the Me2N group can expand the molecular size and lead to the smallest amount of adsorbed dye on the photoelectrode. With very similar absorption profiles and intensity in the DMF solution among RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC, we speculate that the different adsorption abilities of the dyes are the main cause of the different solid absorption spectra on TiO2 and the IPCE curves.To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the three sensitizers were obtained (Fig. S2, ESI†). As seen from Table 1, the first oxidation potentials of all three dyes are more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple, providing a thermodynamic driving force for efficient dye regeneration. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) derived from the oxidation potentials and absorption/emission data (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the three complexes are summarized in Table 1.9 Judging from the LUMO values, the excited-state energy levels of the three dyes are much higher than the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2, indicating that the electron injection process from the excited dye molecule to the TiO2 conduction band is energetically favorable. It is worth noting that the HOMO value of RuLF is the lowest relative to those of RuLC and RuLN, indicative of a stronger driving force for efficient dye regeneration and a better ability to avoid germinating charge recombination. In addition, the fluorination of the LF ancillary ligand in RuLF is found to remarkably lower the energy levels of both the HOMO and LUMO, in agreement with the literature.16a This forms a striking contrast to RuLN, which gives rise to the highest HOMO and LUMO levels in these three sensitizers. As seen from the following calculation study, the increase in the HOMO energy level of RuLN is probably due to the change of the HOMO location in the metal complex.To scrutinize the geometrical and photophysical properties, molecular orbital calculations of RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC were carried out using DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) programs (Fig. 2). For RuLF and RuLC, the HOMOs have amplitudes mainly on the ruthenium metal and NCS ligands, while within the NCS ligands the amplitude is primarily located on the sulfur atom. In comparison, the HOMO of RuLN is mainly located on the 1,10-phenanthroline moiety of the ancillary ligand. This results in a higher HOMO energy level of RuLN, accounting for the lower efficiency of the RuLN cell relative to RuLF. In all complexes, the LUMOs are localized mainly on the H2dcbpy ligands, facilitating electron injection from the excited Ru complex to the TiO2. These results are in good agreement with reported data,9 denoting that a subtle change in ancillary substitution provides a great contribution to modifying the frontier orbital levels of the Ru(III) complexes, thus benefiting the optimization of the conversion efficiency. Fig. 2  Frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC calculated with DFT on the B3LYP/6-31G* level. To gain further insight into the electronic properties of the RuLF sensitizer, we studied its computed spectrum in the UV-vis region (Fig. S4, ESI†). The relevant occupied and unoccupied Kohn–Sham molecular orbitals of the dye RuLF involved in the transitions are shown in Fig. S5, ESI† and their contributions to the main electronic transitions are listed in Table S1, ESI.† Although the positions of the calculated transitions are offset from the experimental peaks, three main bands closely comparable with those measured are observed, characterized by the difference between the corresponding ground state and excited state electron density distributions. It is obvious from the calculations that the first band at 512 nm (Table S1, ESI†) is mainly characterized by the ruthenium metal-to-dcbpy ligand charge transfer. In contrast, the excited electron density for the second band at 470 nm is partially localized on the LF ligand, indicating the blue-shifted absorption was caused by the metal-to-LF transition. The result provides a strong support for the validity of the above conclusion that a wider MLCT band of RuLF relative to RuLN and RuLC derives from the separation of the metal-to-ancillary-ligand (LF) transition from the metal-to-anchoring-ligand (H2dcbpy) transition.The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for the DSSCs based on the three sensitizers are shown in Fig. 3. The IPCE curves for the RuLC, RuLN, and RuLF based DSSCs exhibit wide absorption in the range of 300–800 nm, with maxima at 58.3, 69.5, and 83.5%, respectively. It is clear that the IPCE spectrum of RuLF is enhanced relative to those of RuLC and RuLN, especially in the visible region. The maximum is blue shifted relative to those of RuLC and RuLN, but the overall band profile is remarkably expanded and increased, suggesting an obvious contribution from the high frequency side in the visible region. This is consistent with the solid UV-vis spectra of the three dyes on the TiO2 films. Fig. 3  The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra for DSSCs based on RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC. The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices containing RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC are shown in Fig. 4, and detailed cell performance data are listed in Table 1. Under a standard global AM 1.5 G solar illumination, RuLC and RuLN sensitized solar cells gave overall conversion efficiencies (η) of 3.91 and 5.23%, respectively, while that of the RuLF solar cell reached 6.48%. Of particular importance is the Jsc values increased by 4.65 mA cm−2 and 2.50 mA cm−2 in RuLF relative to those in RuLC and RuLN, respectively. Since RuLF has a higher dye packing density than that of RuLC and RuLN, the enhanced Jsc for RuLF could originate from the adsorbed amounts. With F atoms, there is a stronger interaction between the RuLF dye and the TiO2, and consequently higher dye adsorption. Fig. 4  Photocurrent density vs. voltage for DSSCs based on RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was also performed to elucidate the above photovoltaic findings. Fig. 5 compares data for RuLF, RuLN and RuLC solar cells measured in the dark under a forward bias of −0.70 V. The Nyquist plots show that the radii of the middle semicircles increase in the order RuLC < RuLN < RuLF, indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments from RuLC to RuLN to RuLF.24–26 The electron lifetime values derived from curve fitting are 18.0, 28.4, and 38.0 ms, respectively. The Bode plots shown in Fig. S6, ESI† likewise support the differences in the electron lifetimes for TiO2 films derivatized with the three dyes. The middle-frequency peak of the DSSC based on RuLF shifts to a lower frequency relative to RuLN and RuLC, indicating a longer lifetime for the former species. The increase in the electron lifetimes observed with RuLF relative to RuLN and RuLC cells are associated with a pronounced rise in the charge transfer resistance, implying that the F-substitution in RuLF decreases the interfacial rate constant for electron capture by the I3− ions more effectively. The outcome may be rationalized by the following reason; the replacement of H atoms by F atoms on aromatic rings can substantially alter their physical and chemical nature, and consequently influence their intra- and intermolecular forces to result in a completely different molecular packing fashion.27 This may be helpful to prevent the LF ligands, to a certain extent, from normal close π–π aggregation which disfavors efficient electron injection.16 However, the fluorinated aromatics still tend to stack in a staggered fashion or form a lamellar thin film. Such a thin film may act as a barrier layer to block the recapture of the photo-injected electrons by I3−, thus favoring an increase of electron lifetimes.16 This speculation is verified by the shorter electron lifetimes of RuLN and RuLC with obvious bulky substituents which make no contribution to effective stacking. Nevertheless, the relatively longer electron lifetimes for RuLN than RuLC may suggest that the existence of a more bulky N,N-dimethyl substituent in RuLN offers a better hindrance to retard the charge recombination than a simple methyl substituent. Fig. 5  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC. Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were carried out to further investigate the different photovoltaic behavior of the three sensitizers.24,28Fig. 6a shows the recombination time (τr) of the DSSCs based on RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC sensitizers under various incident light intensities. The results indicate that the recombination time of the devices displays a systematic trend, RuLF > RuLN > RuLC, consistent with the EIS results described above. The much longer recombination time of the DSSC based on the RuLF sensitizer is ascribed to the effective suppression of the electron recombination by the F-substitution. However, the electron transport time (τd) of DSSCs based on the three sensitizers increases in the order RuLF > RuLN > RuLC as shown in Fig. 6b. We suggest that this is why RuLF has the least absorption on TiO2, and the lowest LUMO energy level of the three sensitizers, resulting in the slowest photo-injected electron transport to the rear electrode. Nevertheless, the charge collection efficiencies (ηcc), determined by IMPS and IMVS through the equation ηcc = 1 − τd/τr (Fig. S7, ESI†), display an overall increase in the order RuLF > RuLN > RuLC, which is in agreement with the cell performance in general. Fig. 6  (a) Incident light intensity dependent recombination time constants and (b) incident light intensity dependent transport time constants for DSSCs based on RuLF, RuLN, and RuLC. To understand the role of the π–π stacking of RuLF on cell performance, a study of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) coadsorption on the device parameters was carried out. Fig. 7 compares I–V curves for devices with and without CDCA under the same conditions. As seen from Table S2, ESI,† by adding 3 mM CDCA in the dye solution, the efficiency was increased to 7.28% from 6.85% without CDCA, close to 7.50% obtained from the N719 based DSSC under comparable conditions. The remarkable increase in the Jsc value suggests that the π-stacking still remains in RuLF, but can be broken down by the coadsorption of CDCA to improve the electron injection yield. In addition, a decrease by 19 mV of Voc was observed. This implies that more protons are brought by CDCA to the TiO2 surface, which charges the surface and positively shifts the conduction band edge to result in Voc loss.29 Fig. 7  Photocurrent density vs. voltage for DSSCs sensitized by a 0.3 mM RuLF solution containing 0 or 3 mM CDCA under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). On the basis of the above discussion, we can conclude that all cell parameters, including the conversion efficiencies observed from the IPCE curves, the device efficiencies derived from the I–V curves, the electron lifetime obtained from EIS, and the charge collection efficiencies calculated from IMVS and IMPS, are consistently in the order of RuLF > RuLN > RuLC. These results unanimously indicate an important role of the F-substituent in cell performance, encouraging us to attribute such better DSSC performance of fluorinated RuLF dye to a potential “fluoro-substitution effect”.It is obvious that the F-substitution effect takes place in a versatile manner, probably involving the following multiple contributions. Firstly, F substituents are known to reduce the electron donating property of the ligand in a Ru(II)-sensitizer and thus adjust the Ru(II)/Ru(III) redox potential at a level where rapid regeneration of the sensitizer by iodide ion is possible.6 This is evident from the lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels of RuLF, in contrast to those of RuLC and RuLN, in which the lowest HOMO level of RuLF gives rise to the strongest driving force for efficient dye regeneration. Secondly, fluorination of LF leads to a higher dye density on TiO2, which may account for the increased Jsc value in RuLF relative to RuLC and RuLN, verified by the observation of a remarkably enhanced IPCE band in a broadened visible region. Thirdly, fluorination of aromatic rings can partly avoid normal close π-aggregation to favor offset or lamellar molecular packing, providing a barrier layer to retard the charge recombination and increase the charge collection efficiency. EIS measurements confirm that the RuLF DSSC possesses the longest electron lifetime. This is known to be helpful in increasing the conduction band of TiO2 to improve Voc values.30ConclusionsIn summary, three Ru(II)-sensitizers containing differently substituted 1,10-phenanthroline-based ancillary ligands were prepared and their photovoltaic characteristics were investigated. Detailed photo-physical spectroscopy studies disclose that the photovoltaic performance of this series of solar-cell devices is rather sensitive to the substituents on the ancillary ligands. Because modification with a fluorine moiety in the ruthenium complex could tune the localization of the frontier orbitals appropriately, increase the dye density on TiO2, and enhance the electron lifetime for TiO2 films, the device based on the F-substituted RuLF has a higher power conversion efficiency of 6.48% (7.25% with coadsorption of CDCA) than those based on N,N-dimethyl-substituted RuLN (5.23%) and methyl-substituted RuLC (3.91%). This F-substitution effect, by taking advantage of flourishing F chemistry, will open a promising route to designing a new class of Ru(H2dcbpy)(L′)(NCS)2 type Ru(II)-sensitizers with a high power-conversion efficiency by the simple introduction of C–F bonds in the ancillary ligands.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the 973 Program of China (2012CB821701), NSF of China (61232009, U0934003, 21272292, 21173272, and 21121061), High Performance Grid Computing Platform of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Computational Science, Guangdong Province Computational Science Innovative Research Team, Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (20101102110018), and Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (2011J2200053).Notes and referencesB.
