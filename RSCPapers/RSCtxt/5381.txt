1. Introduction
According to the report of the International Energy Agency, global total carbon emission in 2019 reached about 33 billion tons.1,2 Excessive carbon emission causes serious environmental problems. Glacier melting and sea level rise caused by the greenhouse effect have posed a threat to coastal cities in many countries. The melting rate of polar glaciers is six times larger than that in 1990s. Thus, controlling carbon emissions is a crucial issue and needs to be urgently solved. Carbon neutrality has become a resolute target all over the world.
It is well known that CO2 is the main greenhouse gas that leads to global warming. The adsorption, storage, and re-utilization of CO2 have attracted considerable attention.3–6 Traditionally, the geological or ocean storage of CO2 is operationally difficult, has high escape risk, and high energy consumption.7–10 It is not a sustainable and economic route to CO2 treatment. On the other hand, low value-added carbon-based solid wastes with polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic components, such as inferior coal, coal tar pitch, and petroleum coke, are other kinds of sources of carbon emission, which also brings about serious environmental pollution.11–13 Generally, polluting gas and wastewater are also produced during the treatment and utilization of carbon-based solid wastes.14–16 In fact, CO2 and carbon-based solid wastes can also be considered as cheap and abundant secondary carbon resources. The directional conversion of CO2 and carbon-based solid wastes to high value-added carbon-based products by a green process is a promising and cost-effective strategy and has become a research hotspot.
Recently, green and sustainable electrochemical methods have been developed to directly convert secondary carbon resources to high value-added carbon-based products. It is well known that the electron is a strong reactant that can induce fast electrochemical reactions under moderate conditions. Moreover, the reaction process can be well controlled by the cell voltage or current density.17 Aqueous solution and molten salt are typical electrolytes for the electrochemical conversion reaction. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous solutions is widely studied.18,19 Various chemicals, such as methane, ethylene, ethane, ethanol, syngas, and CO, can be produced on the cathode from CO2.18,20,21 However, diverse products also mean that the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction is low in aqueous solutions due to the participation of hydrogen, especially at a large current density. In addition, in order to obtain high-purity chemicals from the aqueous solution, multi-step chemical separation must be carried out. CO2 = C + O2(1) 2CO2 = 2CO + O2(2)
Compared to aqueous solutions, stable molten salt electrolytes, such as alkali/alkaline earth chloride and carbonate, possess a wide electrochemical window and high CO2 solubility. Due to the absence of H2O, the electrochemical reactions in molten salts are simplified. For CO2 electroreduction on the cathode, C solid products and CO gas may be only produced by the complete and incomplete reduction of CO2 based on reactions (1) and (2), which can be adjusted by electrolysis parameters and the molten salt system.21,22 Meanwhile, CO gas will be separated from the molten salt spontaneously. Thus, pure carbon materials with a graphitized structure (such as carbon nanotubes and graphene) can be expectedly obtained.23,24 In addition, molten salt electrochemistry is also used for the graphitization of solid amorphous carbon.25–28 In the process, oxygen in amorphous carbon can be firstly removed, and then carbon atoms are rearranged from the disordered state to an ordered structure.28 Thus, graphite is conveniently prepared. The method can be also expanded to the graphitization conversion of various carbon-based solid wastes.29
It is well known that graphitized carbon is widely used as an electrode material in batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis.30–33 However, graphitized carbon materials must be traditionally prepared under an extremely high temperature of 2500–3000 °C in an inert atmosphere in order to induce the rearrangement of carbon atoms.34,35 High energy consumption and cost are needed. Apparently, molten salt electrochemistry provides a novel low-temperature and environment-friendly graphitization strategy and the temperatures are usually lower than 900 °C. More importantly, CO2 and carbon-based solid wastes as secondary carbon resources can be directly converted into advanced carbon materials for energy application.
On the other hand, it is well known that the graphite anode is usually used during molten cell electrolysis and CO2 is mainly produced at the anode. Apparently, graphite anode is unsuitable for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 and carbon-based solid wastes. Therefore, stable inert anodes must be exploited to ensure the production of clean oxygen at the anode. In the review, the conversion mechanisms of secondary carbon resources, including CO2 and solid carbon, to high value-added graphitized carbon have been discussed. The development and utilization of inert anodes have been reviewed. The progress toward the conversion process of secondary carbon resources and energy application of graphitized carbon materials have been summarized. In previous papers,5,24 the electroconversion of CO2 to carbon materials has been mainly reviewed. In contrast, the progress of electrochemical graphitization conversion of low value-added solid carbon wastes in molten salt was studied. Considering the whole design of the electrolytic cell, the requirement and typical development of inert anodes are also overviewed. Meanwhile, the promising applications of carbon materials from secondary carbon pollutants are highlighted.
2. Electrochemical conversion mechanisms of secondary carbon resources
Secondary carbon resources mainly include CO2 gas and amorphous carbon-based solid wastes. During electrochemical conversion, graphitized carbon materials and O2 are expectedly produced at the cathode and the anode, respectively. For cathodic processes, the conversion behaviors are related to the electroreduction mechanism and molten salt systems. For the anodic process, stable inert anodes are crucial in order to produce O2. Therefore, the conversion mechanisms of CO2 and amorphous carbon to graphitized carbon are discussed. In addition, the demand for an inert anode is preliminarily analyzed.
2.1 CO2 capture and electro-conversion mechanism
The direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 gas at the cathode is inefficient due to weak affinity between the gas and the solid electrode. Thus, CO2 must be firstly captured by molten salts to form soluble carbonate in order to improve the mass transfer of reactants (i.e., CO32−) for electroreduction, i.e., CO2 capture and electro-conversion should be successive processes.

2.1.1 CO2 capture. 
CO2 is usually captured by the chemical binding between O2− in molten salts and CO2 to form CO32− on the gas–liquid interface by reaction (3). Meanwhile, an opposite decomposition reaction also happens. The reversible reaction has been confirmed by the mass loss of pure Li2CO3 molten salt due to thermal decomposition and the mass increase due to the injection of CO2 into Li2O-containing molten salts.36–38 In addition, C2O52− ions are also found in the carbonate eutectic salt after CO2 capture.39,40 The capture content of CO2 in pure Li2CO3 molten salt is about 50 times compared to those in pure Na2CO3 or K2CO3 molten salt.41 Therefore, it was concluded that both CO32− and C2O52− can be formed in molten salts during CO2 capture with the aid of O2− ions.42 As shown in Fig. 1a, CO2 capture should be ascribed to reactions (3) and (4). O2− is the indispensable capture ion and can be produced by the pre-addition of alkali/alkaline earth metal oxides. The capture contents of CO2 obviously depend on the Li2O concentrations in molten salts. From Fig. 1b, in Li–Na–K eutectic carbonate salts without Li2O, the capture content of CO2 was approximately 7.8 mmol after the reaction equilibrium. It further suggests that the capture route by reaction (4) exists. Apparently, the capture capability of carbonate salts to CO2 increases with the increase in Li2O. When the content of Li2O is 5.0 wt%, the capture content of CO2 is up to 115.5 mmol. It indicates that CO2 capture primarily depends on reaction (3) rather than reaction (4).42 CO2 + O2− ↔ CO32−(3) CO2 + CO32− ↔ C2O52−(4)

Theoretically, according to reaction (3), the capture capability of molten salt to CO2 is determined by the solubility of alkali/alkaline earth metal oxides. Among various alkali/alkaline earth metal oxides, Li2O and CaO are the most promising oxides due to their high solubility and stability.43–45 From Fig. 2, the solubilities of both Li2O and CaO increase with the increase in temperature. The solubility of Li2O in pure LiCl molten salt reaches 17.67 mol% at 800 °C.44 However, when NaCl or KCl is added into molten LiCl salt, the solubility of Li2O decreases obviously (Fig. 2a and b). It means that the dissolution capacity of oxygen in the molten salt decreases. Similar rules are also found for the dissolution behavior of CaO in pure CaCl2, CaCl2–NaCl, or CaCl2–KCl molten salts (Fig. 2c and d). In pure CaCl2 molten salt, the solubility of CaO is up to 21.3% at 950 °C.44

On the other hand, it is noticed that the solubilities of Li2O and CaO increase as a function of temperature in all the molten salts (Fig. 2). The capture capability of molten salts to CO2 depends on the O2− concentration, which is primarily related to the composition of the molten salt. According to Fig. 2, the high temperature is theoretically beneficial for enlarging the capture capability of CO2 due to high O2− concentration and rapid mass transfer.42 However, excessive high temperature would lead to the decomposition of carbonates (Fig. 3a), which will decrease the capture capability of CO2. CaCO3 ↔ CaO + CO2(g)(5)

CaO is the most suitable capture agent due to abundant reserves, low price, and high solubility in CaCl2 molten salt. CaCO3 is formed during CO2 capture by CaO. However, when the temperature increases to about 900 °C, the decomposition reaction of CaCO3 to CaO and CO2 by reaction (5) happens based on the thermodynamic calculation in Fig. 3a, i.e., ΔG < 0. The capture capability of the molten salt for CO2 will be reduced. In LiCl–KCl molten salt containing CaO, the conversion rate of CaO also decreases from ∼80% at 400–550 °C to ∼60% at 600 °C.46 However, for Li–Na–K eutectic carbonate molten salt with 50 kPa CO2 pressure, CO2 equilibrium adsorption contents are about 148.6, 187.5, and 259.3 mol m−3 at 450, 550, and 650 °C, respectively.42 Thus, a equilibrium between adsorption and decomposition should exist, and the equilibrium adsorption content is a reasonable evaluation parameter to capture the capability.
Single LiCl or CaCl2 molten salt has relatively high solubility toward Li2O or CaO for CO2 capture, especially at high temperature. However, the decomposition of CO32−, volatilization of the molten salt, and high energy consumption are the key issues at high capture temperature. At present, multi-compound eutectic molten salts are usually used to decrease the temperature. CO2 equilibrium absorption processes in various multi-compound molten salts have been studied (Fig. 3b). When the equilibrium is reached, about 17.0 mmol CO2 is captured by LiCl–KCl molten salt with 180 mmol kg−1 CaO or Li2O.47 The adsorption kinetics of CaO in molten Li–Na eutectic chloride molten salts is much faster than that of Li2O and the adsorption equilibrium is reached within two hours. CO2 adsorption rate and contents in chlorides are higher than those in carbonate. Furthermore, according to reaction (3), CO2 adsorption reaction equilibrium shifts to the right through increasing the partial pressure of CO2 in capture initial stage. It means that CO2 absorption capacity of molten salt can be enlarged.47 Meanwhile, the initial absorption can be also accelerated (Fig. 3c and d).42 In detail, in Li–Na–K carbonate molten salts, the CO2 adsorption capacity increases from 44.1 to 150 mol m−3 with an increase in the CO2 partial pressure from 20 kPa to 75 kPa.42 In short, the CO2 adsorption capacity and rate depends on the molten salt composition, temperature, and CO2 partial pressure.


2.1.2 CO2 electroreduction. 
As discussed above, CO2 is adsorbed by the dissolved O2− ions in the molten salt, and then CO32− ions are formed. In the molten salt electrolysis cell, soluble CO32− ions will be easily transferred to the cathode and the electroreduction reaction happens.48–51 Therefore, the electrochemical conversion behavior of CO2 is determined by the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO32− electroreduction. Tetravalent carbon in the CO32− ions may be completely and incompletely reduced to C and CO, respectively. The reduction degree depends on the electrochemical parameters, molten salt composition, temperature, etc.
The molten salt electrolyte for CO2 electroreduction mainly includes halides (such as NaF, LiF, NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2), carbonates (such as Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, and CaCO3), and mixtures of halides and carbonates.52–55 In addition, in order to enhance the adsorption capacity, alkali or alkaline-earth metal oxides are usually added into molten salts.50,56,57 The electrochemical window of the molten salt depends on the decomposition voltages of the components. The theoretical decomposition voltages (TDV) of typical components are shown in Fig. 4. When the temperature is lower than 1000 °C, TDV values of all halide molten salts are higher than 3.0 V (Fig. 4a). For typical carbonate molten salts, the TDV values are lower than those of the halides at the same temperature. Only a voltage of 2.0 V is needed to decompose the carbonate at 1000 °C (Fig. 4b). At the same temperature, halide molten salts possess better electrochemical stability than the carbonate. It also indicates that carbonate as the adsorbent for CO2 in halide molten salts can be electro-reduced without the decomposition of halides.
 Fig. 4  Theoretical decomposition voltages at different temperatures. (a) Halide and (b) carbonate molten salts; (c and d) the decomposition voltages of carbonate and oxides. All values were calculated by the HSC software. 
The TDV of typical carbonate and relevant oxide is calculated and shown in Fig. 4c and d. In the calculated temperature range, the TDV values for carbon reduction in Na or K carbonate are in the range of 1.4–1.9 V and those of K or Na oxide are in the range of 1.0–1.9 V. In the same temperature range, the TDV values of Na or K carbonate are higher than those of the corresponding oxides so that the obvious side reduction reaction of Na or K oxide happens in the electro-reduction process of Na or K carbonate. As a consequence, carbon is hardly produced due to the side reaction of the reduction of Na or K oxide, i.e., Na or K carbonate cannot be directly used as the reactant for the preparation of carbon due to low efficiency, while it can be used as the molten salt electrolyte.58–60 On the other hand, the TDV of Li or Ca oxides (2.5–6.0 V) is significantly higher than the corresponding carbonate (1.0–1.5 V). Thus, Li or Ca oxides can be used as the adsorbent for CO2 due to stable performance and high decomposition voltage. Thus, the stable cycle of adsorption and electroreduction of CO2 through Li or Ca oxide as the adsorbent is realized.
Generally, three reduction mechanisms of CO32− are proposed.35–37,48–50,53,55,61–63 Firstly, CO32− is electro-reduced in a single step to carbon through four-electron transfer. CO32− + 4e− → C + 3O2−(6)
Secondly, two-step electro-reduction proceeds by two-electron transfer through CO22− intermediates. Meanwhile, CO is produced by the incomplete reduction of CO32− or the decomposition of CO22−. CO32− + 2e− → CO22− + O2−(7) CO22− + 2e− → C + 2O2−(8)or CO32− + 2e− → CO + 2O2−(9) CO22− → CO(g) + O2−(10)
Thirdly, the metal thermal-reduction of CO32− occurs. M+ + e− → M(Na, K)(11) CO32− + 4M → 2M2O + C + O2−(12)
The practical electrochemical reduction behavior of CO32− mainly depends on the temperature and potential. CO is hardly detected in exhaust gas at a temperature lower than 800 °C.64 Therefore, the one-step reduction mechanism of CO32−, i.e., reaction (6), is mainly recognized. However, at 850 °C, CO is produced.62 Thus, CO32− is reduced by the two-step electrochemical reduction mechanism based on reactions (7) and (8). The reduction process is also confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry62 (Fig. 5a and b). CO may be produced by the direct electroreduction of CO32− or the decomposition of the unstable CO22− intermediate, i.e., reaction (9) or (10). It is noticed that CO is only detected during the electrolysis of pure Li2CO3 at a temperature higher than 900 °C and carbon is not deposited on the cathode.63 Besides, with the increase in temperature, the TDV values of typical carbonates of CO are gradually lower than those of C (Fig. 5c). In particular, CO can be obtained through the electro-reduction of CaCO3 at temperatures higher than 800 °C due to the low TDV. The third reduction mechanism was proposed in 1986s61 and confirmed for the Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt at 450 °C on bubbling CO2 gas electrode in a recent research work.49 In the cyclic voltammetry curves (Fig. 5d), the C1 peak is identified for the reduction of CO32−, i.e., reaction (6). The C2 peak is ascribed to the reduction of alkali metals such as Li and Na, i.e., reaction (11).49 It can be confirmed by the existence of the reversible A2 peak in the Ar atmosphere, i.e., the oxidation reaction of alkali metals. Thus, carbon can be formed by reaction (12). Therefore, the mechanism for the electro-reduction of CO2 is affected by the temperature and the potential.

In summary, in order to obtain carbon products on the cathode more efficiently, temperature lower than 800 °C is favorable. When the temperatures are higher than 950 °C, CO gas is dominant in both the carbonate and halide molten salts. Besides the temperature, a suitable potential also plays an important role in the products. In fact, CO2 electro-reduction is also affected by CO2 adsorption in the molten salt. If the adsorption rate or solubility for CO2 is very low, the formation of CO32− and the mass transfer of CO32− to the cathode are limited, which is a disadvantage to the electroreduction process. In contrast, when the solubility of the molten salt for CO2 is high, the decomposition of carbonate easily happens at a temperature higher than 800 °C. The adsorption efficiency of CO2 decreases and the energy consumption increases. Thus, the durable equilibrium between CO2 adsorption and electro-reduction becomes very important during CO2 electrochemical conversion. However, the adsorption and electro-reduction mechanism depends on the molten salt system; it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the electrochemical conversion process. Recently, the critical operating conditions for durable looping were calculated by finely coupling the current density with the O2− dissociation kinetics for the CaO-containing LiCl–KCl molten salt.46 The coupling current density was 4.41, 9.60, and 27.3 mA cm−2 at 450, 550, and 650 °C, respectively. The coupling relationship between CO2 adsorption and electroreduction in other molten salts, and the common law in various molten salts will be an essential research direction.

2.2 Electro-conversion mechanism of amorphous carbon to graphitized carbon
Traditionally, the graphitization of amorphous carbon must be carried out at an ultra-high temperature of 3000 °C. Even if the transition metals or oxides are added as catalysts, the operating temperature can only be reduced to about 1500 °C.65,66 Recently, a novel and effective molten salt electrochemical method was proposed for the low-temperature graphitization of solid amorphous carbon.27,28 A schematic diagram of the direct electro-conversion of amorphous carbon to graphitized carbon is shown in Fig. 6a. The powdery amorphous carbon is assembled into a solid cathode and graphitization is achieved by cathodic polarization at a temperature lower than 1000 °C. During electrochemical conversion, oxygen atoms in the form of oxygen-containing functional groups in amorphous carbon are removed by cathodic polarization, and then carbon atoms are rearranged from the disordered state to an ordered structure. Then, the graphene sheets are formed (Fig. 6b). Finally, the graphite structure is obtained easily. Besides amorphous carbon, other solid carbon-based resources (such as inferior coal and biomass carbon) can also be electro-converted into graphitized carbon materials by a similar method. Thus, it provides a feasible and low-temperature strategy to prepare graphitized carbon materials.

2.3 Demand for inert anodes
In addition to the molten salt electrolyte and cathode materials, the anode is also significant for the electro-conversion of secondary carbon resources. The anode reaction depends largely on the anode materials. Graphite is usually used as an anode for industrial molten salt electrolysis due to its good thermostability and electrical conductivity. However, the oxygen ions released due to the cathodic reduction reaction will react with the graphite anode to produce CO and CO2, resulting in a decrease in the electrode size.67 A graphite anode with continuous consumption needs to be replaced regularly, which is unfavorable for continuous and stable production. Moreover, carbon powders peeled off from the graphite anode will float on the molten salt surface, which will result in a short circuit between the anode and the cathode. As a result, energy consumption is increased and current efficiency is decreased.68 More importantly, it is absurd to produce CO2 on the graphite anode during the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to graphitized carbon. Thus, traditional graphite anode cannot be used for the electrochemical conversion of secondary carbon resources. 2O2− − 4e− → O2(g)(13)
The exploitation of novel non-carbon inert anode is of significance. As shown in reaction (13), oxygen ions on the non-carbon inert anode are oxidized to O2 rather than CO2 or CO on the graphite surface. It means that all the issues regarding graphite anode may be solved. The electro-conversion of secondary carbon resources to high value-added graphitized carbon in molten salt will be of great practical significance. Generally, the inert anode should meet many conditions as follows.69,70
(a) Strong physical and chemical stability;
(b) High electron conductivity;
(c) Resistant to thermal shock;
(d) Resistant to attack by oxygen ion or oxygen;
(e) No electrochemical dissolution.
3. Inert anode for molten salt electro-conversion
For molten salt electrolysis, researchers are devoting great effort for exploiting stable inert anodes. Several candidate materials as anodes are assembled into the molten salt electrolysis cell. In view of the harsh requirements given in Section 2.3, a suitable inert anode is still a crucial challenge. So far, according to the materials of inert anodes, they can be divided into pure metals, alloys, oxides, and so on.
3.1 Pure metal
Pure metals easily meet most of the requirements of inert anodes. Compared with the graphite anode, metals usually possess superior physicochemical properties, such as high conductivity, excellent thermal shock resistance, and mechanical stability. Moreover, metals are easily machined to electrodes. The electrochemical and chemical stability of metal anodes in the molten salt mainly depends on the surface oxide film, which must resist the erosion of the molten salt and the oxidation of oxygen ions on the substrate. Meanwhile, good conductivity is needed to minimize the ohmic resistance. Among metals, noble metal Pt seems to be the most stable.53,71,72 The electrochemical behaviors of the Pt anode were investigated in LiCl and LiCl–1.0 wt% Li2O molten salts (Fig. 7a).73 Li2PtO3 is found on the surface of the Pt electrode (Fig. 7a). However, only the Pt diffraction peak on the surface of the Pt electrode in pure LiCl molten salt is detected (Fig. 7b). It suggests that oxygen ions in the LiCl molten salt are indispensable in order to form Li2PtO3. Li2PtO3 film (grey part in the inset graph of Fig. 7a) with a thickness of about 20 μm on the Pt surface is observed after the electrolysis in LiCl–1.0 wt% Li2O molten salt.73 However, the oxide film of Pt is not found in pure LiCl molten salt (inset graph of Fig. 7b).73 It is inferred that the anti-corrosion ability of the Pt electrode is ascribed to the formation of the Li2PtO3 film in LiCl molten salt with oxygen ions.73

Although noble metal Pt is the best anode material, its high cost is a limiting issue. As shown in Fig. 7c and d, typical anodic polarization curves of other pure metals were studied in CaCl2, CaCl2–CaO, and Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salts.71,74 It was found that the anodic dissolution order of various metals according to the polarization potential in CaCl2 molten salt was Cu, Fe, Ag, Co, Ni, Mo, and Pt (Fig. 7c). Except Pt, Mo is the most stable among the tested metals in CaCl2 molten salt. In fact, CaO usually exists in CaCl2 molten salt, especially for CO2 capture. Thus, the effect of oxygen ions on the electrochemical behavior was investigated in CaCl2–2.5 mol% CaO (Fig. 7d). It was found that the order of metal dissolution was changed significantly. The order of initial polarization potential is Fe < Mo < Cu < Ag < Co < Ni < Pt. The dissolution potential of Mo becomes more negative and the dissolution rate is much faster due to the presence of oxygen ions. It means that the Mo electrode is more resistant to chloride ions, compared to oxygen ions. Interestingly, comparing the polarization curves in two kind of molten salts, the increase in the rate of current density for the Ni electrode in the potential range of 1.70–1.83 V (vs. Ca2+/Ca) is slower than those of Fe, Cu, Co, Ag, and Mo.71 The reason is ascribed to the formation of the NiO film on the surface of the Ni metal and the corrosion by oxygen ions can be effectively avoided. It can be further confirmed by the polarization curves of Ni, Pt, and the pre-oxidized Ni electrodes in CaCl2 molten salt at 850 °C (Fig. 7e). The dissolution potential of the pre-oxidized Ni electrode is more negative than that of Pt and is much more positive than that of pure Ni electrode. Compared with the chloride electrolyte, the Ni electrode exhibits good electrochemical stability in carbonate molten salt (Fig. 7f). According to the 5th cycle of anodic polarization curves in the temperature range of 575–750 °C in carbonate, the passivation current densities in the potential region without O2 evolution decrease with the increase in temperature (inset in Fig. 7f).74 It indicates that the stability of the anodic film is enhanced at high temperature. Based on the above results, Ni may be the most suitable pure metal anode considering the anti-corrosion property and cost.
Apparently, the surface film on the pure metal inert anode plays a crucial role in corrosion resistance. Thus, it is an effective way to reduce the cost by coating a noble metal with good corrosion resistance on the substrate anode. In order to prepare the coated inert anode, the stable noble metals or other materials are usually deposited on the conductive substrate.75–79 For example, the Pt–Ti composite inert anode is prepared by coating Pt layer on the Ti metal substrate.76 The Pt–Ti inert anode exhibited good conductivity and stability in carbonate molten salts, and the cost can be decreased, compared to that of pure Pt anode.76 Specifically, Pt–Ti electrode showed excellent catalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction and high durability, which were similar with that of pure Pt anode in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salts at temperature than lower 500 °C.76 However, the adhesion of the coating to the substrate is a limiting issue. With long-term electrolysis, oxygen and molten salts will diffuse into the interface between the coating and the substrate, which leads to corrosion and degradation of the coating. Then, O element was obviously detected in the interface region. Thus, it is the key for the coated inert anode to enhance the adhesion between the surface film and the substrate.
3.2 Alloy
Compared to pure metals, alloys possess better anti-corrosion ability and physicochemical properties. Alloys are considered as better anode materials for molten salt electrolysis. In addition, it has been confirmed that Ni is an optimum pure metal anode. Thus, nickel-based alloys are widely studied as anode materials, such as Ni–Fe,80–82 Ni–Cu,83,84 Ni–Al,85 Ni–Cr,75,86 Ni–Cu–Al,87 Fe–Ni–Al,88,89 Ni–Cu–Cr,90,91 Ni–Fe–Cu,92–97 Ni–Fe–Co,98 Ni–Fe–Cr,99 and Ni–Fe–Cu–Al.93,100 A common law is that the formation of conductive and anti-corrosion composite oxide films on the alloy surface are crucial for the long-term durability in molten salt.
Ni–Fe based alloys as promising candidate materials are the research hotspots. NiFe2O4 film on the surface of the Ni–Fe alloy has low solubility in molten salt and possesses good corrosion resistance to molten salt.81,101,102 The film of NiFe2O4 on the Ni0.36Al0.1Cu0.3Fe0.24 surface is slowly formed in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.6 V (vs. Ag/Ag2SO4) in Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt (Fig. 8a).93 And then, from Fig. 8b, O2 evolution reaction happens on the surface of the anode at potential of 0.7 V (vs. Ag/Ag2SO4).82 The in situ formation of NiFe2O4 on the surface of the Ni–Fe based alloy is slow. Therefore, the Ni–Fe alloy is usually pre-oxidized before electrolysis.100 The pre-oxidized Ni–11Fe–10Cu as the inert anode was studied in Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt (Fig. 8c).92 After continuous electrolysis for 100 h, NiFe2O4 on surface of Ni–11Fe–10Cu alloy was found. It indicated that the Ni–Fe based alloys as inert anodes have good long-term stability in carbonate molten salt.

Copyright 2013 Elsevier. 
Unfortunately, for halide molten salts, both oxygen and halogen ions will cause the corrosion of the alloy anode. The stability of the alloy in halide molten salt becomes worse. Although the NiFe2O4 film can be still formed on the surface of the Cu65Ni20Fe15 alloy anode, the FeF2 layer was observed at the oxide/alloy interface after 5 h electrolysis in KF-AlF3 molten salt at 700 °C (Fig. 8d and e).103 The thickness of the FeF2 layer increases with the electrolysis time, which leads to the serious corrosion of the alloy anode. These results have been confirmed by previous studies,104,105i.e., the Ni–Fe alloy is easily corroded by the halogen elements, which brings about poor stability.
In fact, the stability of the Ni–Fe based alloys in molten salt depends on the composition of the alloys. For the Ni–Fe–Cu alloy, the NiFe2O4 phase can be strengthened by Cu. Thus, the penetration of the molten salt into oxide films was decreased and rapid anode dissolution was effectively inhibited. Gavrilova et al.96 reported that Cu concentration in the alloy is crucial to the formation of NiFe2O4 spinel in KF-AlF3 molten salt at 700 °C. The spinel with a coherent inner layer is difficult to be formed at high Cu concentration. If the content of Cu in the Ni–Fe–Cu alloy is too low, the outer CuO layer that acts as a sacrificial layer cannot be formed. Therefore, there is not enough time to form the NiFe2O4 spinel inner layer with a protective effect.96 It was found that a denser and more protective NiFe2O4 inner layer can be expectedly formed on the Ni–Fe–Cu alloy anodes with Cu content of 45 wt% and 55 wt%.96 In addition, when other elements, such as Al, were added to the Ni–Fe alloy, the stability in molten salt was also improved. For the Ni–Fe–Al alloy, Al is more active than Fe and Ni. Thus, Al is preferentially oxidized and serves as a pinning connection, which brings about good adhesion between the metal and the oxide film.88 The dense NiFe2O4–NiAl2O4–FeAl2O4 ceramic layer on the substrate surface is critical.89 It was found that the 57.9Fe–38.2Ni–3.9Al alloy possessed good anti-corrosion ability in halide molten salt.88 However, compared to halide molten salt, the Ni–Fe alloy exhibited better stability in carbonate molten salts. Apparently, the stability of the alloy in the molten salt can be improved by doping elements.
The doping of suitable elements can effectively adjust the microstructure of the inert anode, such as the grain size and morphology.106–108 Therefore, the anti-corrosion properties of the anode can be improved.109–111 The doping of rare earth elements into inert alloys was mainly focused on. For example, when less than 0.43 wt% yttrium is doped into the Ni–16Mo–7Cr–4Fe alloy, the grains are refined and the distribution of the coarse particles is improved.110 The alloy containing 0.05 wt% yttrium showed the best anti-corrosion and mechanical properties simultaneously. Severe spallation of the oxide film on the Ni–16Mo–7Cr–4Fe alloy with 0.05 wt% yttrium was not found within 250 h and the outer NiO layer was detected clearly.110 Moreover, by doping aluminum and yttrium into Ni–11Fe–10Cu, the adhesion of the protective layer at high temperature is enhanced.111 In addition, the anti-corrosion ability of the Ni-based alloy (Ni–10Cu–11Fe–6Al) can be improved by doping a little of Ce in the halide molten salt.106
Based on the above results, appropriate Ni-based alloys may be selected as the inert anode for molten salt electrolysis. However, the applicability of the alloy anode depends on the composition of the molten salt. The stability of the alloy inert anode in carbonate is better than that in halide molten salts.
Others alloy inert anodes were also developed in recent years.112–114 Chromium–iron (CrFe) binary alloys were proposed as inert anodes for molten oxide electrolysis (MOE).112,113 In molten oxides (wt%: 42.3 CaO, 42.3 Al2O3, 5.4 MgO, and 10 Fe3O4), the formation of the oxide spinel layers plays an important function in the stability of the alloy. Main spinels including CaCr2O4 and (Mg,Fe)(Cr,Al,Fe)2O4, (Cr2−xAlx)O3 (ref. 113) were formed on the surface of the CrFe anode. In particular, (Cr2−xAlx)O3 solid solution as a protective oxide layer (i.e., (Cr0.9Al0.1)O3, (Cr1.4Al0.6)O3, and (Cr0.7Al1.3)O3) is crucial for the Cr1−xFex (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) alloys.113 The initial concentration of iron in the anode was of major importance. High Fe content in the anode led to the formation of interfacial defects and extensive internal oxidation.113 This research provides a new idea to explore alloy anodes using more accessible materials, i.e., oxide passivating alloys.
Recently, a new TiB2 inert anode was reported.114 In CaCl2 molten salt with a small amount of CaO, the passivation film is generated on the surface of the TiB2 anode during the anodic polarization process, leading to a higher pitting potential than that of the Pt electrode. After long electrolysis of 100 h at 2.8 V, the TiB2 anode was protected by three passivation layers, namely, CaTiO3, TiO2, and Ti(BO3).114 The corrosion rate was only 1.38 × 10−3 g cm−2 h−1.114
The passivation layer with good conductivity and stability on the surface of the alloy anode is of significance to obtain good anti-corrosion properties. The alloy inert anode with affordable metal materials is promising for building industrial electrolytic cells for stable and long-term electrolysis. However, the resistance to the corrosion of oxygen ions between the passivation layer and the alloy substrate need to be further improved.
3.3 Oxides
Obviously, the stability of the metal inert anode in halide molten salts is poor. However, the halide molten salts are one of the important molten salt systems for carbon electro-conversion. Thus, more stable inert anodes are still desired. The formation of dense oxides film on the surface of metals anode is crucial to possess chemical or electrochemical anti-corrosion ability in molten salts. Thus, it is expected that oxides with good conductive and strong corrosion resistance are directly used as inert anodes. In recent years, oxide inert anodes (such as SnO2, RuO2·TiO2, and Ti4O7) have attracted more and more attention.67,115–118
At present, SnO2 is mainly used as an inert anode for the electro-conversion of secondary carbon resources in molten salt. As shown in Fig. 9a, the polarization curve profile of SnO2 is similar to those of Pt and Ir in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt at 500 °C, and no obvious oxidation peak appears.116 It means that all the electrodes are stable. However, the slopes of Pt and Ir are obviously larger than those of SnO2. It means that Pt and Ir display better catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction than SnO2. However, considering the low cost, SnO2 may be a suitable anode material. After electrolysis, there is no obvious change in the surface of SnO2 (inset in Fig. 9a). In particular, SnO2 is also a relatively stable inert anode in CaCl2-based molten salts. The CaSnO3 film is formed on the surface after electrolysis in CaCl2 molten salt (Fig. 9b), which will lead to a decrease in the conductivity.119 In addition, CaSnO3 could be reduced by alkaline or alkaline earth metals, leading to the mass loss of the SnO2 anode. Moreover, SnO2 has poor conductivity, thermal cracking property, and is easily broken at high temperature.93,120 Thus, in order to improve the property of SnO2, SnO2-based composite anodes, such as SnO2–CuO–Sb2O3, have become a research direction.121,122 It was found that the sintering temperature can be reduced from 870 to 780 °C with the increase in the CuO content from 1 wt% to 5 wt% into SnO2.122 The electrical conductivity was improved by adding Sb2O3 into the SnO2-based anode.122 All in all, the SnO2 anode showed better stability in carbonate than that in chloride molten salts.

Copyright 2015 ECS. 
However, the formation of the CaSnO3 film on the anode surface in CaCl2 molten salt inhibited the electron transfer and then reduced the conductivity.115 Thus, the properties of the SnO2-based anode still need to be improved. CaTiO3/CaRuO3 composite materials possess high conductivity and good stability in CaCl2-based molten salt.123 The CaRuO3-based anode shows low corrosion rate, even after long-term electrolysis in CaCl2–CaO molten salt.117,123 Therefore, a promising composite oxide anode, i.e., RuO2·TiO2, was developed. The electrochemical behavior of the RuO2·TiO2 anode in CaCl2–CaO (1.0 wt%) was examined.117 As shown in Fig. 9c and d, the initial polarization potential of the RuO2·TiO2 anode was more positive than those of Pt and graphite. More positive self-corrosion potential was also observed on the RuO2·TiO2 anode (−0.415 V vs. Cl2/Cl−) than those on Pt (−1.222 V vs. Cl2/Cl−) and graphite (−1.766 V vs. Cl2/Cl−) in Fig. 9d.117 It indicated that better stability was obtained for the RuO2·TiO2 anode in CaCl2-based molten salt.
Although the RuO2·TiO2 inert anode displays good stability in CaCl2-based molten salt, the practicability of TiO2·RuO2 may be restricted by the limited reserves of Ru element on Earth. Recently, a new and renewable titanium oxide inert anode without Ru, Ti4O7, was proposed.67,124 The dense Ti4O7 anode exhibited good stability in CaCl2-based molten salt, which was ascribed to the formation of a protective TiO2 layer on the surface.67 Interestingly, the novel Ti4O7 anode is recyclable. The oxidized Ti4O7 inert anode can be regenerated by either in situ periodic current reversal in molten salt or H2 chemical reduction.67 Although the Ti4O7 anode displays good electrochemical performance, slight change in the Ti4O7 purity, particle size, and morphology can have a significant effect on the performance. Thus, the preparation of Ti4O7 needs to be further studied.
The doped-TiO2 anode was also researched, especially Nb-doped TiO2 anode.125 At low concentrations and reducing conditions, niobium is mainly incorporated into TiO2 in the form of Nb5+ and produces a highly conductive material, probably in the form of Nbx5+Tix3+Ti1−2x4+O2 (i.e., Nb0.06Ti0.94O2).125 The electronic conductivity is ascribed to the presence of Ti3+ sites in the rutile structure. Nb-doped TiO2 also displayed good stability. Under oxidizing conditions, Ti3+ may be oxidized to Ti4+, and oxide ions are incorporated into the lattice. The lattice structure is rearranged to accommodate the oxide ions, and cation vacancies are formed to achieve charge equilibrium.125 The Nb-doped TiO2 inert anode exhibited good performance during 24 h electrolysis at a current density of 0.2 A cm−2. However, an outer Nb-depleted region of the TiO2 with high porosity exists after 100 h of electrolysis.125 Therefore, the stability of the doped-oxide inert anode needs to be further improved.
In conclusion, inert anodes for molten salt electrolysis are mainly focused on pure metals, alloys, and oxides. Pure noble metals, such as Pt, Au, and Ir, are not suitable anode materials due to their high cost. However, coating a noble metal anode can decrease the cost but the adhesion and stability should be improved. Oxides and Ni-based alloys as anode materials should be mainly developed due to their good stability and low cost. Notably, a proper inert anode should be rationally selected according to the difference in the stability in carbonate or halide molten salt. In addition, the properties of alloy and oxide anodes, such as conductivity and anti-corrosion ability, are expectedly enhanced by metal doping. Indeed, using an inert anode, secondary carbon resources, especially CO2, can be electrochemically converted to oxygen and high-value carbon products in molten salt systems. It provides a green and promising route for the utilization of secondary carbon resources.
4. Electroconversion of CO2 to graphitized carbon
It is well known that single- or multi-wall carbon nanotubes can be obtained from graphite cathode by electrolysis in pure NaCl molten salt.126 It opens a door to the electro-conversion of secondary carbon resources, such as CO2 and carbon wastes, to high value-added carbon materials in molten salts. For the electro-conversion of CO2, the micro-morphology and graphitization degree of carbon materials are mainly focused on. In recent decades, carbon nanospheres, nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanosheets have been obtained from CO2 by molten salt electrolysis. Meanwhile, the graphitization degree of carbon materials can also be adjusted in order to exhibit good electrochemical properties for energy storage. Thus, it is significant to summarize the preparation of polymorphous nanocarbon materials and the factors affecting the graphitization process.
4.1 Electroreduction to nanocarbon materials
Nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been widely studied.127–129 The convenient preparation methods, promising application, and excellent performances of nanocarbon materials attract increasing attention. For example, carbon nanotubes with sp2-hybridization are widely used in the field of superconductivity, energy storage, and catalysis due to their superior dynamics, conductivity, and heat transfer. The preparation methods of nanocarbon materials include laser evaporation of graphite, plasma jet deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and electrolysis. In the past decade, nanocarbon materials have been conveniently prepared by the direct electroreduction of CO2 in molten salts. According to the microstructure, electrolytic carbon products can be divided into three classes—carbon nanotube/nanofibers, graphene, and carbon spheres/particles.

4.1.1 Carbon nanotube/nanofibers. 
Carbon nanotubes, as typical one-dimensional nanocarbon materials, possess excellent mechanical, electrical, and electrochemical properties. Conventionally, carbon nanotubes are synthesized through chemical vapor deposition. High cost, low productivity, and complex process are the restrictive issues. In comparison, molten salt electrolysis can be used to rapidly prepare carbon nanotubes from greenhouse CO2 and become a research hotspot.130–135 The method is simple and promising. The electrolysis process can be conveniently adjusted by cell voltage, current density, electrolytic time, temperature, and molten salt composition to enlarge the production efficiency and control the microstructure of nanotubes.131–134
Li et al.135 found that a high yield of more than 50% in electrolytic carbon products can be achieved by the electrolysis of carbonate (Fig. 10a). In addition, the strong interference ability of K2CO3 toward the growth of one-dimensional carbon nanotubes is found. The yield of carbon nanotubes in Li–Na carbonate molten salt is obviously higher than that in Li–K carbonate molten salt. Similar result is also obtained in another work.136 The microstructure and efficiency of one-dimensional carbon nanotubes are also affected by the cell voltage and temperature. Karen et al.134 confirmed that the diameter of carbon nanotubes becomes smaller and the deposition rate increases with the increase in both the cell voltage (4.0–6.0 V) and temperature (550–650 °C) in CaCO3–Li2CO3–LiCl molten salt. In particular, carbon nanotubes with a minimum diameter range of 13.0–43.5 nm can be obtained at 550 °C and 4.0 V.134 However, the efficiency decreased correspondingly. For example, at a cell voltage range of 4.0–6.0 V, the ranges of current efficiency are 70–85% and 28–46% at 550 °C and 650 °C, respectively.134

Carbon nanotubes can also be obtained by molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in halide molten salt. Novoselova et al.137 prepared carbon nanotubes in NaCl–KCl or NaCl–KCl–CsCl molten salt under CO2 atmosphere. Compared with the NaCl–KCl–CsCl molten salt, the content of carbon nanotubes in the products was higher in NaCl–KCl molten salt and the value was about 40 vol% at 10 atm CO2 pressure and 750 °C.137 Similarly, carbon nanotubes with the diameter of 20 nm and wall thickness of 5–10 nm were synthesized by molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in CaCl2–NaCl–CaO molten salt at 750 °C.138 Temperature is another effective factor on the microstructure of carbon products. At the temperature of 650, 750, and 850 °C, the microstructures of carbon products are mainly quasi-spherical, nanotubes, and platelet-like, respectively.138 All in all, carbon nanotubes can be successfully obtained through CO2 electro-conversion in molten salts.
Carbon nanotubes with 270–950 GPa Young's modulus possess good mechanical properties but the radial mechanical properties are poor due to the structural anisotropy and hollow cores.139 The doping or filling-carbon nanotubes can be also prepared by one-step molten salt electrolysis to further improve the physicochemical properties. For example, carbon nanotubes as flexible materials need high radial strength, which can be improved by filling heterogeneous elements inside the carbon nanotubes.140–142 At present, both non-metal and metal elements, such as Fe, Co, Sn, and B, are doped or filled into the carbon nanotubes.
For non-metal elements, boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are the main filling or doping elements.143 Han et al.139 proposed a convenient method to prepare the boron-filled carbon nanotubes through the direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 in CaCl2–CaCO3–B2O3 molten salt. The boron-filled carbon nanotubes with a diameter of about 10–20 nm are obtained, as shown in Fig. 10b. It is found that boron in the form of boron carbides is filled into the carbon nanotubes. The yield of carbon nanotubes can be increased at higher cathodic potential of −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl.139 However, the formation of CaB6 leads to the loss of boron, which is unfavorable to the filling of boron into the carbon nanotubes. In addition, sulfur-doping carbon nanotubes are also obtained by the direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 and SO2 in both CaCl2–NaCl–CaO–Li2SO4 and Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3–Li2SO4 molten salts.144,145 From the XPS data, sulfur-doping is inhibited with the increase in the temperature in CaCl2–NaCl–CaO–Li2SO4 (3 mol%). The sulfur content (atom%) is only 1.07% at 775 °C.144
For metal elements, tin-filled carbon nanotubes are prepared by the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in LiCl–SnCl2 molten salt.146 When SnCl2 concentration is about 1 wt%, the optimum yield is reached. Higher SnCl2 concentration has a negative effect on the quality of carbon nanotubes. The diameter of tin-filled carbon nanotubes is about 50 to 100 nm.146 Similarly, the metallic Ge-filled carbon nanotubes by the co-electrolysis of both soluble GeO2 and CO2 in NaCl–CaCl2–CaO molten salt were obtained (Fig. 10c).147 It was confirmed that the liquid phase CaxGe intermediate is crucial to the formation of the tubular nanostructure. Then, Ca in CaxGe is washed post treatment. As a result, the electrometallurgy of Ge from GeO2 and the electrodeposition of carbon from CO2 occurs on the cathode simultaneously.147 Ge nanoparticles is encapsulated into carbon nanotubes.
Carbon nanofiber is another important one-dimensional nanocarbon material. Traditionally, carbon nanofibers are synthesized by electrospinning, carbonization, or chemical vapor deposition from various raw materials such as pitch, rayon, solid carbon materials, and acetone.151–154 However, these methods will bring about serious pollution and high energy consumption. As an alternative, carbon nanofiber can be synthesized in a single step by molten salt electrolysis from CO2 gas, as shown in Fig. 10d.148,150 Carbon nanofibers have a high crystallinity, especially those that are prepared in carbonate molten salt. The yield of carbon nanofibers is also higher in carbonate molten salt.148 It is inferred that carbon nanofibers are formed from the C-13 isotope CO2, while carbon nanotubes are formed by natural CO2 at the same conditions.52 It is well known that CO2 is dissolved in molten salt and electro-reduced on the cathode. The diffusion of 13CO32− in the molten salt is slower than that of 12CO32−. Thus, carbon growth is affected. Specifically, the slow diffusion of 13CO32− can influence (i) the distribution of the transition metal nucleation sites, (ii) the curvature of the carbon cap growing on the nucleation site, and (iii) the availability of carbon during the growth process.36 The diameter of 13C-carbon nanofibers is in the range of 150 to 350 nm.36 At present, there are few reports on the direct application of carbon nanofibers prepared by molten salt electrolysis and further studies are still needed.
Carbon nanotubes and nanofibers have been successfully synthesized from CO2 through molten salt electrolysis. It is inferred that the formation mechanism of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers may be the necking of carbon nanoparticles and further propagation (Fig. 10e).134 Another formation mechanism of carbon nanotubes/nanofibers is the catalytic effect in molten salt (Fig. 10f). Specifically, the electrochemical growth of carbon nanotubes can be controlled by Fe catalysts.149 The diameter of carbon nanotubes is related to the thickness of Fe catalysts.149 It was found that the median diameters of carbon nanotubes were changed from ∼23 to ∼33 nm with the thickness increase of Fe catalyst layer from 0.5 to 5 nm.149 During CO2 electroreduction, Fe as active centers can be carbonized to Fe3C and then carbon can be evolved and grown into carbon nanotubes.155 Similarly, carbon nanofibers can be also formed by the catalytic effect of Ni active centers (Fig. 10g).148


4.1.2 Graphene. 
Graphene, also called ultrathin graphite sheets, is the most representative two-dimensional nanocarbon materials. The arrangement of carbon atoms in graphene is the same as that of monolayer graphite of the sp2 hybrid orbital. Graphene possesses superior optical, electric, thermotic, and mechanical performances. For example, the maximum thermal conductivity of monolayer graphene reaches 5300 W mK−1.156 Therefore, it is considered as a revolutionary material in the future and commonly applied in the fields of material, energy, and biomedicine.157–160 The synthetic technologies of graphene mainly include mechanical exfoliation, redox, electrochemical exfoliation, and chemical vapor deposition.161,162 Considering the energy consumption and carbon emission, molten salt electrolysis is recognized as a perspective route. Originally, it was found that graphene can be electrochemically stripped from the bulk graphite cathode in molten salt.26 Indeed, it is a successful strategy to prepare graphene from graphite. However, graphite must be also produced by the conventional technology, which needs extremely high temperature and energy consumption.
Interestingly, the direct electro-conversion of CO2, as a greenhouse gas and secondary carbon resource, to graphene is successfully achieved by molten salt electrolysis.62,163 Transparent ultrathin graphite nanosheets are firstly synthesized from CO2 in CaCl2-based molten salt (Fig. 11a). It is further confirmed by HRTEM that the ultrathin graphite sheet consists of one to five layers of graphene.62 Meanwhile, it was found that the nanostructure of graphene is affected by the cathodic materials. Hu et al.163 found that the graphene balls with a rolled edge can be prepared by the electro-reduction of CO2 on the Cu cathode in CaCl2–NaCl–CaO molten salt (Fig. 11b). When the cathodic substrate is changed to metal Ni, a flat-shaped graphene with less layers is grown on the surface.163 It is inferred that the formation and structure of graphene may be related to the catalytic effect of cathode materials. Now, it is worthy to further study the electro-conversion process and mechanism of CO2 conversion to graphene. The structure and layer number of graphene will determine the properties and application.164,165 In addition, heteroatom-doped graphene prepared directly by molten salt electrolysis of CO2 may be a promising research direction.

The formation mechanism of graphene by molten salt electrolysis has been also studied (Fig. 11c).163 At the initial stage, C and CO can be electro-reduced from dissolved CO2 (i.e., CO32−). Then, C grows in plane with the assistance of active Fe atoms on the surface of stainless steel. C also diffuses into the crystal lattice of solid steel to form Fe3C. Although the cathode is covered with few layers of graphene, active Fe atom will be inserted into the interlayer of the graphene sheets. Therefore, graphene continues to grow layer-by-layer through the micro-explosion reaction in the interlayer space of the graphene layer due to the intense generation of CO.163 CO in the outlet gas is also detected by online gas analyzer (Fig. 11d).163 In addition, the formation of graphene is also related to physical or chemical peeling from graphite.166,167 However, the direct electrochemical preparation of graphene from CO2 is rarely mentioned and needs to be further explored in depth.


4.1.3 Carbon nanoparticles/nanospheres. 
Besides the carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, and graphene, carbon nanoparticles/nanospheres are also prepared from CO2 by molten salt electrolysis.60,135,145,168 It is well known that carbon nanoparticles/nanospheres are important advanced materials and widely used as reinforcement materials or matrix for rubber, catalyst support, lubricating materials, electrode materials for rechargeable batteries, hydrogen storage, and so on.169–171
Carbon nanoparticles are electrochemically prepared from CO2 in the temperature range of 450–700 °C in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt.60 At 450 °C, carbon products consist of fine nanoparticles with the diameter of 30–50 nm. After optimization, the highest specific surface area of the carbon products is up to 1315 m2 g−1 at 450 °C and the potential of −6.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag2SO4).60 With the negative shift of potential, micro-pores in carbon products are more easily formed. In the potential range of −3.0 V to −6.0 V, the formation of lithium carbide will compete with the generation of carbon,60 which will inhibit the growth of carbon particles. The obtained carbon nanoparticles are potential electrode materials for supercapacitors.
Carbon nanospheres are a kind of typical carbon nanoparticles. Due to the large specific surface area and high conductivity, they are widely used in the fields of double layer capacitors, secondary batteries, and catalyst supports.172–174 Conventionally, arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition are used to prepare carbon nanospheres.175–177 The low yield, high energy consumption, and complex precursor preparation are the key issues.
Carbon nanospheres are also prepared by the molten salt electrolysis of CO2. It was found that carbon nanospheres with a high yield of ∼90% and the diameter of 200–500 nm can be prepared from CO2 in Li–Ca–Na (66.7:20:13.3, wt%) and Li–Ca–K (66.7:20:13.3, wt%) carbonate molten salt.135 Carbon nanospheres exist in the forms of clusters (Fig. 12a). The formation process of carbon nanospheres was also inferred.135 In the initial stage, carbon grows on the nickel nucleation site on the Ni anode. Then, metal nucleation sites promote multidimensional carbon deposition. Coupled with the interface modification of CaO from CaCO3 splitting, multi-dimensional carbon growth is facilitated to generate carbon nanospheres. More details still need to be found in the future. When molten salt is changed to Li–Ca carbonate, carbon nanotubes will be generated under the same electrolysis conditions.135 It further indicates that the microstructure of deposited carbon can be regulated by the molten salt composition.

On the other hand, large carbon spheres can also be prepared by the molten salt electrolysis of CO2.168,178 In LiCl–KCl–CaCO3 molten salt, hollow carbon spheres with a diameter of 3–5 μm were obtained at 2.8 V and 450 °C and the yield was ∼80%.168 The wall thickness of carbon spheres is about 20–50 nm (Fig. 12b).178 The specific surface area of carbon spheres prepared in LiCl–KCl–CaCO3 molten salt increased with the increase in the temperature. However, complete carbon spheres will be destroyed to carbon sheets with the increase in temperature. The formation process of hollow carbon spheres is explained as follows (Fig. 12c):178 (1) CO32− is formed due to CO2 absorption; (2) CO32− is reduced to CO22−; (3) ultrathin carbon sheets are produced by the reduction of CO22− (or CO32−); (4) CO22− (or CO32−) is embedded into the carbon sheets; (5) the embedded CO22− or CO32− is further dissociated or reduced to CO; (6) the growing CO bubbles squeeze the carbon sheets to form bubble-like structures by the microbubble effect; and (7) CO bubbles are further reduced to carbon. The hollow carbon spheres are promising electrode materials of lithium-ion secondary batteries and supercapacitors.168,178
Based on the above reviews, nanocarbon materials with various structures can be prepared from CO2 by molten salt electrolysis. The structure can be well adjusted by catalytic elements, cell voltage/potential, temperature, and molten salt composition. The catalytic elements (such as Fe and Ni) and the formation of alkali metal carbide play an important role in the formation of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. The production of graphene and carbon nanospheres depends on the by-product of CO bubbles. Meanwhile, the effects of temperature, cell voltage, and molten salt composition cannot also be ignored. All in all, CO2 as a secondary carbon resource can be successfully transformed to high value-added nanocarbon materials.

4.2 Effects on the graphitization degree
For carbon materials, besides the micro-morphology, the graphitization degree is another important parameter for practical application. The graphitization degree is affected by electrolysis time, voltage, temperature, molten salt composition, catalyst, and so on. Conveniently, the graphitization degree of carbon is characterized by the intensity ratio of the D peak to the G peak in the Raman curves (i.e., ID/IG). A smaller ID/IG value means a higher graphitization degree.
The graphitization degree of electrolytic carbon products can be improved by increasing the electrolysis time.155 In Li2CO3 molten salt, after 4 h electrolysis at 770 °C and 1.0 A, the ID/IG value of carbon products was 0.93, which was much lower than that (1.48) after 1 h electrolysis (Fig. 13a).155 During long-term electrolysis, oxygen in the functional groups can be separated deeply. The disordered carbon atoms will be sufficiently rearranged and carbon materials with high graphitization degree can be obtained. In addition, the electrolysis voltage and temperature also significantly affect the graphitization degree. In Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3–Li2SO4 molten salt, with the increase in the electrolytic temperature, the ID/IG value decreases from 0.83 at 475 °C to 0.30 at 825 °C (Fig. 13b).145 That is, the graphitization degree of carbon products was enhanced. At the same conditions, the ID/IG value of carbon in chloride molten salt was lower than that in Li–Na–K carbonate molten salts (Fig. 13c).47 Carbon materials with a high graphitization degree are easily obtained in chloride molten salts. More defects exist in the carbon products obtained in carbonate molten salts.47 Wang et al.179 found that the graphitization degree of carbon will increase with the increase in the cell voltage in Na2CO3–K2CO3–NaVO3 molten salt (Fig. 13d). The ID/IG value of carbon products decreased from 0.802 at 3.0 V to 0.489 at 4.0 V. Above all, electrolytic carbon with a high graphitization degree might be prepared under long electrolysis time, high temperature, and high voltage in chloride molten salts.

Although the ID/IG value can be decreased by adjusting the electrolysis parameters, the graphitization degree is still low, which limits the potential applications of carbon products. In Section 4.1, it is confirmed that the morphology and structure of electrolytic carbon can be changed by metal catalysts. It is inferred that the graphitization degree of carbon may be improved. Therefore, catalytic graphitization should be an effective strategy to enlarge the graphitization degree. During CO2 electrolysis, metal cathodes may serve as heterogeneous catalysts and provide active sites. CO2 electrolysis was carried out on various metal cathodes. Ge et al.148 prepared carbon materials by CO2 electrolysis on glassy carbon cathode and the ID/IG value is 0.79–1.28. Li et al.53 obtained carbon materials on Mo sheet in LiF–Li2CO3 eutectic molten salt and the ID/IG value was 1.48. The graphitization degree of electrolytic carbon is still low. From Fig. 13e, the intensity ratios of the D peak and the G peak on the Cu and Ni cathode are basically similar,180i.e., the graphitization degree of carbon obtained on Cu and Ni cathode has no obvious difference. The reason may be ascribed to the rapid and complete coverage of carbon products on the heterogeneous cathode surface in a short time (10 s), which will prevent the metal cathode from contacting the freshly-obtained carbon or molten salts. The freshly-obtained carbon is actually electrodeposited on the carbon film. The continuous catalytic effect of the metal cathode is inhibited during the long-term electrolysis of CO2. In order to enhance the graphitization degree, electrolytic carbon products obtained in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt were further treated by direct immersion method in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3–Li2SO4 molten salt at 550 °C (Fig. 13f). The ID/IG value decrease from 1.08 to ∼0.72 after 1 h immersion.181 The graphitization degree of electrolytic carbon can be improved by the sulfurization function. However, the graphitization degree is not further increased with the increase in the immersion time due to the slow diffusion of sulfur in solid carbon products.
Based on the above results, heterogeneous catalysis by solid metal cathodes for the graphitization of carbon products from CO2 is ineffective and cannot be achieved continuously. It is significant to develop a homogeneous catalytic graphitization strategy for CO2 electroreduction in molten salts. If a soluble catalyst is added into the molten salt, in situ homogeneous catalysis may be achieved. Wang et al.179 proposed a novel and feasible homogeneous catalytic method by adding soluble NaVO3 into the molten salt. It was found that the ID/IG values of carbon products decrease from 1.143 to 0.536 with the increase in the NaVO3 content from 5% to 15% (Fig. 13g).179 It indicated that soluble NaVO3 exhibited good homogeneous catalytic effect on the electrochemical graphitization conversion of CO2. The catalytic mechanism is also discussed in Fig. 13h.179 V2O74− (i.e., the real existing form of VO3− in molten salt) and CO32− ions are co-electroreduced to V2O3 and carbon on the cathode (reactions ① and ②). The highly-active V2O3 exhibits a good catalytic effect on the conversion of carbonate to the ordered graphitized carbon. Meanwhile, V2O74− ions will be regenerated by the spontaneous reaction between the newly-formed V2O3 and carbonate, which also accelerates the production of carbon by reactions ③ and ④. Although solid carbon will cover the entire cathode surface, insoluble V2O3 as the catalyst can be in situ electrodeposited in the carbon products and re-oxidized to soluble vanadate in the molten salt. Therefore, the homogeneous and in situ catalytic effect can proceed continuously.
Similarly, soluble Li2SO4 can also serve as a homogeneous catalyst in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt, and carbon products with high graphitization degree can be prepared by the catalytic effect of S.144,145 With the increase in the content of Li2SO4 from 1.0 mol% to 5.0 mol%, the ID/IG ratio of carbon products decreased from 1.64 to 0.577.144 It indicated that the graphitization degree of carbon increased with the increase in the Li2SO4 content in molten salt. The mechanism for the improvement of the graphitization degree by Li2SO4 can be explained as follows: S can be electroreduced from Li2SO4 and in situ reacts with the defect carbon in the carbon products to form CS2 gas.145 The volatilization of CS2 gas accelerates the removal of defect carbon and then leads to a higher graphitization degree.
Compared with heterogeneous catalysis by solid metal cathodes, a higher graphitization degree can be obtained for the carbon products by the homogeneous catalysis of soluble catalysts. However, the homogeneous catalytic strategy is still preliminary and is needed to be further studied in detail.
4.3 Evaluation of CO2 electro-conversion in molten salt
The main purpose of CO2 electrolysis in molten salt is the clean treatment of greenhouse gases. The simultaneous preparation of high-valued carbon materials on cathode expands the significance of this method due to the promising applications. Meanwhile, oxygen gas can be produced using an inert anode. It means that CO2 greenhouse gas can be electrochemically converted to high-valued carbon materials and oxygen in the molten salt. Therefore, it is a green and sustainable process. The current efficiency and energy consumption are important indices to evaluate the electrolysis process.

Table 1 summarizes the typical literatures in the field of the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into graphitized carbon in molten salt. Actually, it generally includes three basic processes during CO2 electro-conversion. Firstly, CO2 is captured (or dissolved) into the molten salt; secondly, electrochemical reactions take place on the electrode; thirdly, the post treatment of products takes place. It is a vital step for electrolysis to continuously capture CO2. CO2 adsorption kinetics should match well with electrolysis in molten salt. From Table 1, it is found that molten salts including carbonates or carbonate-chloride mixtures with Li+/Ca2+/Ba2+ oxides are commonly used as electrolytes for the capture and electrolysis of CO2. These electrolytes have wide electrochemical windows and high capture ability for CO2. In molten salt, CO2 was captured and converted to CO32− by the released O2− from Li+/Ca2+/Ba2+ oxides. CO32− was further electro-reduced to C/CO on the cathode surface, while O2− was released to capture CO2. In addition, molten salt with a high temperature is advantageous for the reaction kinetics of capture or electrolysis. Moreover, the reduction potentials of CO32−/C and CO32−/CO are very sensitive to temperature, which ensures the high selectivity of the reduction reaction.24 From Table 1, it can be found that the electrolysis temperature range is 450–900 °C. Based on the controllable side reaction and low overpotential at high temperature, the high current efficiency can be easily obtained. For example, Ijije et al.185 reported that the current efficiency was approximate 100% for the conversion of CO2 to C in carbonate molten salts.

The electrode materials applied for the molten salt electro-conversion of CO2 are listed in Table 1. The cathode materials are mainly transition metals or stainless steels. It is noted that the cathode material will affect the microstructure of deposited carbon. For example, Douglas et al.149 reported that carbon nanotubes are easily obtained on an Fe-coated stainless steel. The diameter of nanotubes is related to the thickness of Fe layers. Inert anode materials for oxygen evolution reaction are crucial. However, a durable anode with low overpotential and low cost still needs to be explored. The Ni-based alloy anode is relatively stable in carbonate molten salts. Actually, if more stable and durable inert anodes can be developed, it would be helpful in enhancing the current efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. More importantly, continuous electro-conversion of CO2 can be achieved.
The current efficiency is obviously affected by the electrolysis conditions, such as temperature, current density, molten salt composition, and electrode material. In molten salt, CO2 can be electroreduced to CO and C. For the production of carbon, the incomplete reduction of CO2 to CO is the main side reaction, which will decrease the current efficiency for C production, especially at high cell voltage and temperature.64,192,193 Meanwhile, the production of alkali metal carbides, such as Li2C2 and CaC2, is also a key factor to decrease the current efficiency at high voltage.129,168,178 Deng et al.47 reported that the high current efficiency is easily obtained at a low current density and pure molten carbonate. The maximum current efficiency is close to 90%.47 In addition, a stable anode with good conductivity is beneficial to obtain high current efficiency. Hu et al.191 reported that the high current efficiency of 83.75% was obtained using the RuO2–TiO2 anode, compared with the inert TiO2–Ni anode. Therefore, the high current efficiency can be obtained by adjusting the electrolysis conditions, which will decrease the energy consumption of CO2 electro-conversion.
Industrial aluminum electrolysis is used as a reference to estimate the energy consumption of CO2 electro-conversion. It is well known that the electricity consumption is ∼12 kW h kg−1-Al with the current efficiency of ∼96% at about 4 V.24 From Table 1, the minimum energy consumption is only 9.8 kW h kg−1 for carbon products from CO2. Therefore, the molten salt electro-conversion of CO2 has great potential for large-scale applications. Meanwhile, clean and renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy, would be used for electricity supply in the future. Wang et al.24 designed the promising molten salt CO2 capture and electrochemical transformation, i.e., MSCC-ET process, which provides a path for systematic industrial application (Fig. 14). The process can be heated and powered by renewable energy, for example, heat and electricity from solar energy. Molten salt plays a central role in effectively capturing CO2, transporting reactants and ions, as well as maintaining the temperature of the cell. Besides, depending on the feed gas and operation conditions, functional carbon materials, CO, or syngas can be produced.24 Moreover, the MSCC-ET process can be integrated with a molten salt heat storage system from concentrated solar heating and a heat exchange system with industrial high-temperature flue gas.24 In fact, it provides a feasible route for the industrial application of CO2 molten salt electro-conversion from the system integration of raw, capture, electrolysis, products, and energy supply.

As mentioned above, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into high-valued carbon materials is of great development prospect. However, there are still several problems that need to be solved before large-scale application. (1) CO2 capture in molten salt is critical for continuous and constant electrolysis. However, less attention is paid, especially to the equilibrium between CO2 capture and electrolysis. (2) In the molten salt electrolysis process of CO2, the regulation of side reaction is still a key to obtain high efficiency. However, side products such as CO and alkali metal carbides are generally produced. (3) Carbon products easily fall from the cathode during long-term electrolysis due to low density and will float on the whole surface of the molten salt. As a result, short circuit between the cathode and the anode happens due to the electron conductivity of the carbon layer, which will decrease the current efficiency.185 Therefore, a reasonable electrolysis cell structure must be designed. Although some issues still exist, the route of green and sustainable CO2 molten salt electrolysis is an advanced and promising method. In addition, from the engineering aspect, the pre-treatment and purity of mixing flue gas with CO2, the stability and durability of the electrolytic tank components, the continuous separation and collection of electrolytic products, etc., should be solved in the future.
5. Electrochemical graphitization conversion of solid carbon resources
Low added-value carbon solid waste (such as inferior coal, tar pitch, and biomass), as a part of carbon emission, also leads to serious environment pollution. Generally, solid carbon wastes are amorphous and low-temperature graphitization to advanced carbon materials is a promising route for their harmless treatment and resource utilization.
5.1 Graphitization conversion of low added-value carbon resources
It is well known that the main impurities of carbon solid waste with disordered carbon arrangement are non-metal elements (such as oxygen and hydrogen), which will hinder the graphitization conversion. In the past decades, a molten salt electrochemical method has been developed for Ti extraction from solid TiO2 cathode by direct electrochemical deoxidation, named as the FFC method.194 Inspired by the FFC method, Jin et al.27,28 proposed a novel method for the graphitization conversion of amorphous carbon as the solid cathode in low-temperature molten salt. The solid deoxidation and carbon atom rearrangements bring about the graphitization conversion. It is confirmed that the electrolysis potential and temperature have great influence on the graphitization conversion of carbon black. With the negative shift of potential and the increase in temperature, the characteristic peak intensity of graphite increases, which means higher graphitization degree (Fig. 15a and b). Peng et al.28 confirmed that carbon black can be well graphitized after 30 min of electrolysis at 820 °C and 2.6 V in CaCl2 molten salt (Fig. 15c). After 2 h of electrolysis, amorphous carbon black is converted into nanoflake graphite (Fig. 15d and e). The ID/IG value of carbon products decreases obviously from 0.84 to 0.11 after 2 h.28 Similarly, it is confirmed that hydrocarbon compounds, such as glucose, can also be electro-converted to graphitized structure through cathodic polarization.27 In fact, amorphous carbon can be divided into bulk and powdery carbon. For bulk amorphous carbon, it can be directly used as a cathode to achieve graphitization conversion.25,147 If amorphous carbon is powdery, it must be pressed into a pellet and then used for a cathode (Fig. 6a).

During graphitization conversion, cell voltage, temperature, and electrolysis time are important parameters to adjust the electro-conversion behavior. In general, high cell voltage will bring about strong polarization and prompt graphitization conversion. Tu et al.195 found that the petaloid nanoflake features of carbon products become more obvious and the thickness of the nanoflakes is decreased with the increase in the cell voltage from 2.6 V to 3.0 V (Fig. 15f–i). Correspondingly, the ID/IG value of carbon products decreases from 0.324 to 0.201.195 It means that the graphitization degree is obviously improved at high cell voltage. However, if the cell voltage is further increased, carbon loss would increase due to CaC2 formation in the CaCl2 molten salt. In addition, the graphitization degree also increases with the increase in the electrolysis time and temperature. At the cell voltage of 2.8 V, the maximum graphitization degree with the ID/IG value of 0.112 is obtained after 2 h at 850 °C.195
On the other hand, it is well known that the burnout rate of inferior coal as fuel is low, which also causes severe environmental pollution. However, inferior coal can also be used as a carbon-rich resource. Thus, it may be a good raw material to produce graphite for high value-added applications. However, inferior coal containing a large amount of ash cannot be directly graphitized. Thus, the pre-treatment of inferior coal is necessary. A typical pre-treatment and electro-conversion method of inferior coal is provided for the high-valued utilization.196 Inferior coal is firstly purified to Hyper Coal (HPC) through thermal extraction in the organic solvent N-methylpyrrolidone in an autoclave at 350 °C for 1 h.196 Then, the HPC powder is pressed into a bulk cathode for molten salt electrolysis.196 It is confirmed that pre-treatment is favorable for the graphitization conversion of inferior coal. Meanwhile, with the increase in the electrolysis temperature, cell voltage, and time, the graphitization degree of carbon products increases. At 950 °C and 2.6 V, the ID/IG value of inferior coal decreases from 1.6 to 0.3 after 6 h electrolysis in CaCl2 molten salt.196 The graphitized carbon products are employed as negative electrode materials of lithium ion battery, delivering a good capacity performance.
Based on the above works, a promising and common method is successfully obtained for the graphitization conversion and utilization of carbon-based solid wastes. Although the method is preliminary studied, it is expectedly extended to the graphitization conversion of low metamorphic coal, coal tar pitch, petroleum coke, biomass, etc.
5.2 Electrochemical graphitization of biomass carbon
Biomass, including husk, shells, leaves, and stalks, is a kind of carbon-containing solid waste from agriculture and forestry. The yield of biomass is up to a hundred billion tons every year. Biomass is regarded as a renewable carbon resource. Thus, the reuse of biomass waste is very significant. Traditionally, the open burning of biomass wastes is one of the main treatment methods. The greenhouse gas CO2 and contaminated dust are released, which leads to serious environment pollution. Thus, a green and sustainable method for the treatment and utilization of biomass wastes is expected to be developed.
The molten salt electrochemical graphitization method is extended to the utilization of biomass wastes.29,197,198 Firstly, biomass wastes are simply pre-treated to form amorphous carbon-based materials with oxygen-containing functional groups. Then, it is directly immersed into the molten salt for electrochemical graphitization and graphitized carbon is obtained.
Carbon–silicon composites as promising anode materials of Li-ion batteries have been widely researched. C can effectively alleviate the volume expansion (>300%) of Si.199 Electrode materials for Li ion battery usually need to meet the requirement of a porous structure. Reactive metals (e.g., Mg and Al) are usually used to reduce porous silica precursors to Si powders.197,199,200 Then, carbon and Si composites are prepared by chemical vapor deposition or the hydrothermal method.201,202 However, most natural silica and silicates are contained in rocks, which are not suitable for the preparation of porous particles through the solid-state metallothermic reduction route.197 Natural plants are ideal precursors to fabricate hierarchically biomimetic porous carbons due to the porous structure, carbon-neutrality, sustainability, and wide availability.197,203 Rice is one of the most important agricultural crops and the annual production amount is ∼420 million tons all over the world.204 Rice husks with porous structures mainly consist of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and hydrated silica (15–20%).205 In rice husks, the organic components are assembled into vascular bundles with natural macroporous channels to transport water and nutrients. SiO2 nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of the cell walls and intercellular layers are interconnected to each other to form a continuous 3D nanostructure.204 Moreover, carbon in the rice husks can be utilized as a conductive network to reduce IR drop during the molten salt electrolysis and improve the storage performances of carbon–silicon composites.197 Therefore, rice husk is considered as a promising biomaterial for the preparation of carbon–silicon materials due to the co-utilization of Si and C.
The electrochemical conversion of rice husk to porous C–Si composite materials was confirmed in CaCl2 or NaCl–KCl–MgCl2 molten salt.197 Rice husk was firstly pyrolyzed. The organic component and hydrated silica in rice rusk can be converted to hard carbon and SiO2, respectively. Therefore, the C–SiO2 composite was formed and then electrochemically converted to the C–SiC composite at 2.4–2.8 V in CaCl2 molten salt (Fig. 16a).197 At a cell voltage of 2.4 V, the SiC nanowires distributed among amorphous C particles are the main products. At 2.6 V, a mixture of honeycomb-like SiC wires and carbon sheets was obtained. When the cell voltage increased to 2.8 V, the electrolytic products become carbon sheets with interconnected nanowires. The C–SiC composites obtained at 2.4 V as the anode material of Li-ion batteries exhibit excellent rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1.197 In addition, the C–Si composite obtained in the NaCl–KCl–MgCl2 molten salt delivered a specific capacity of 670 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1,197i.e., the performance of the electrolytic products was affected by the molten salt composition. In brief, the high-value utilization of biomass waste was successfully realized.

A similar molten salt electrochemical method was also used for the graphitization conversion of cellulose (Fig. 16b–d). It was found that the graphitized carbon was obtained from cellulose and is a potential positive materials for Al ion battery.29 Specifically, the diffraction peak of (002) became more and more obvious with the increase in the electrolysis time (Fig. 16b), i.e., the graphitization degree of electrolytic carbon increased as a function of electrolysis time. The graphitized carbon consisted of thin nanoflakes with wrinkles (Fig. 16c and d).
According to the above results, electrochemical graphitization is a feasible and promising method for the high-value utilization of biomass wastes. Carbon emission is effectively avoided and the pollution issue is expectedly solved. Meanwhile, carbon resources in low-cost and abundant biomass wastes are well utilized and recycled. The research on the high-value utilization of biomass wastes through molten salt electrolysis may become one of the hotspots in the future.
However, the graphitization conversion method of solid carbon wastes is preliminarily studied. The wide adaptability to various solid carbon resources with different compositions needs to be further confirmed. More importantly, the low purity and graphitization degree of carbon products with inhomogeneous structure will limit their applications. Therefore, it is significant to further understand the conversion mechanism and optimize the conversion process further.
6. Energy applications of graphitized carbon
Generally, high value-added graphitized carbon materials can be obtained by high-temperature heat treatment, chemical vapor deposition, direct combustion, and so on.35,206,207 The obtained carbon materials are used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. However, the long process, serious pollution, and residual impurities in the conventional process seriously limit the sustainable development.
Fortunately, low-temperature molten salt electrochemical method is a green and promising technology for the direct electro-conversion of secondary carbon resources to high value-added graphitized carbon materials. More importantly, the technology is common and suitable for preparing various nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanofibers, nanotubes, nanoflakes, nanosphere, and graphene.208 The graphitized carbon with a controllable graphitization degree, large specific surface area, and high conductivity can be used as an excellent electrode material for sustainable energy conversion and storage, such as rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysts.
6.1 Rechargeable battery
Rechargeable batteries as typical electrochemical energy storage devices, such as Li ion battery (LIBs) and Al ion battery, are widely applied and developed for portable and large-scale energy storage. Graphite is the key electrode material due to its low cost and good electrochemical properties. The graphitized carbon materials obtained by molten salt electro-conversion from secondary carbon resource are also studied as electrode materials for Li-ion and Al-ion batteries.

6.1.1 Li-ion batteries. 
Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density, long cycling stability, and relatively low cost play an indispensible role in common electronic products, electric vehicles, and hybrid vehicles.209,210 Graphitized carbon is the only commercial negative material of Li-ion batteries. Predictably, the requirements of graphitized carbon materials will present a sustainable and rapid increase in the future. In particular, various new carbon materials as negative electrode, such as carbon nanofibers, nanotubes, nanospheres, and graphene, exhibit better electrochemical properties.211,212 Preferentially, it is crucial to produce carbon materials via an environment-friendly route.
As a low-cost and green method, molten salt electrolysis for the preparation of nanocarbon materials from low-value carbon waste and CO2 has been confirmed and the electrochemical properties of carbon materials as negative electrode of LIBs have been studied. Deng et al.46 prepared hollow carbon spheres and ultrathin carbon sheets by the capture and electrolysis of CO2 in LiCl–KCl–CaCO3 molten salt. It was found that the reversible specific capacities were 254 and 185 mA h g−1 for hollow carbon spheres and ultrathin carbon sheets, respectively. Both carbon products showed good cycling stability and approximately 100% coulombic efficiency over 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Ge et al.213 found that excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability were realized for direct electrolytic carbon through the electrochemical conversion of CO2. At 500 mA g−1, the discharge specific capacity was maintained at 215.5 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles.213
Graphene is a kind of typical two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial and is considered as a promising negative material for LIBs owing to its high surface-to-volume ratio and good conductivity. Ultrathin graphene has also been successfully prepared by the electrochemical conversion of CO2 in CaCl2-based molten salts.163 The charging/discharging behavior of graphene obtained by the electroreduction of CO2 is not still measured. It may be an interesting work and the obtained graphene is expected to exhibit good electrochemical properties. However, graphene prepared from commercial graphite by molten salt electrochemical method has been studied as an negative electrode of LIBs.25 The discharge specific capacity at 1C reaches 1016 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and the value is much higher than the theoretical capacity of bulk graphite.25
In addition, nanocarbon materials converted from solid carbon through molten salt electrolysis have also been researched.28,196,214 Graphitized carbon with a nanoflake structure was prepared by molten salt electrolysis from inferior coal.196,214 The electrolytic carbon as the negative electrode of LIBs exhibited a high reversible specific capacity of 848.26 mA g−1 after 120 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. Even at an ultra-high current density of 10 A g−1, a high specific capacity of 277.2 mA h g−1 and excellent rate performance were obtained.214 Other solid carbon sources, such as carbon black and glucose, have also been graphitized and used in LIBs.28 The specific capacity of electrolytic carbon with the unique porous nanoflake structure was 65 mA h g−1, which is significantly higher than those of commercial graphite nanosheets (31 mA h g−1) and graphite powders (21 mA h g−1) at a high current density of 1800 mA g−1.28 The graphitized carbon also displays a good cycling stability.28 In addition to pure carbon materials, the mixing or doping of electrolytic nanocarbon materials by other elements can be achieved in situ by the molten salt electrolysis of secondary carbon resources. It is expected that composite carbon materials as negative electrode of LIBs will exhibit excellent charging/discharging properties.


6.1.2 Al ion batteries. 
LIBs are the most mature energy storage devices owing to the success application of graphite and lithium cobaltite as electrode materials. However, LIBs is limited by safety issues and scarce resources of Li and Co.215,216 In the past decades, several efforts have been devoted to exploiting novel and safe rechargeable batteries with low-cost and earth-abundant electrode materials. Various rechargeable batteries, such as potassium,30,217 sodium,218,219 calcium,220,221 magnesium,222,223 and aluminum224,225 batteries, have been developed as alternatives of LIBs. Among the novel rechargeable batteries, aluminum-ion battery (AIBs) is regarded as a reliable alternative for large-scale energy storage due to its rich reserves, cost-effectiveness, and good safety. Moreover, three-electron transfer can be realized on the negative electrode during the charging/discharging of AIBs. Therefore, the theoretical volumetric capacity of AIBs is up to 8046 mA h cm−3 and obviously higher than that of LIBs (2062 mA h cm−3). However, the positive electrode is the key limit for the development of AIBs. Graphitized carbon is the most effective positive materials of AIBs.226–228 Thus, it is significant to prepare carbon-based positive materials with a low cost and environment-friendly method.
Recently, graphitized nanocarbon obtained by molten salt electrolysis has been researched as a positive electrode of AIBs. The charging/discharging behaviors and cycling stability between amorphous carbon and electro-converted graphitized carbon were compared.195 When amorphous carbon is used as the positive electrode material of AIBs, there are no obvious redox peaks (Fig. 17a and b). On the contrary, graphitized carbon cathode displays clear redox peaks and voltage plateaus. The typical intercalation/deintercalation behavior of AlCl4− ion was observed. The initial discharge capacity was about 67 mA h g−1.195 More importantly, with the increase in the current density, AIBs with the graphitized carbon cathode still delivered stable reversible capacities of 60.2, 65.8, and 65.1 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, and 500 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 17c). Moreover, graphite nanoflakes can maintain a discharge capacity of 63.6 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 over 1000 cycles.195 Similar results were also confirmed by Zhang et al.229 Wang et al.230 successfully prepared graphite nanoflakes with different graphitization degree from carbon black by molten salt electrolysis. The effects of the graphitization degree on the electrochemical performance of the AIBs were confirmed. It was found that the charging/discharging capacity increases with the increase in the graphitization degree.230 Graphite nanoflakes with the highest graphitization degree deliver an initial discharge capacity of 66.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, eventually retaining 66.3 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 96.1% and capacity retention of 99.7%, exhibiting an ultra-stable cycling performance.230

In addition, it is worthy to note that the positive reactions of AIBs are mainly restricted by the poor diffusion kinetics of AlCl4− ions among the layer space of graphite. Thus, the microstructure of the carbon positive electrode has important effects on the capacity and stability. A strategy of reducing graphene layers to improve the ionic diffusivity was proposed.228 Therefore, ultrathin graphene obtained by the molten salt electrolysis of secondary carbon resources is crucial for AIBs. Meanwhile, the defects in graphene can hinder AlCl4− diffusion and cause side reaction.231 Therefore, pure graphitized carbon materials with less layered graphene and few defects are needed. The electrochemical conversion of secondary carbon resources in molten salt can be well controlled by the electrolysis parameters and molten salt composition. Advanced carbon materials with high graphitization degree are expected to be prepared to meet the requirement of AIBs.
In summary, the studies on electrolytic carbon materials from secondary carbon resources by molten salt electrolysis have been carried out. The obtained carbon materials as electrodes of LIBs and AIBs exhibit good electrochemical properties. In fact, the electrolytic carbon can be also used for other rechargeable batteries, such as Na and K ion batteries.186 Thus, preparing advanced graphitized carbon materials for rechargeable batteries by the molten salt electrolysis of secondary carbon resources is a promising, sustainable, and economic route.

6.2 Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are considered as promising electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high power density, long cycle life, and fast charging/discharging process.232–234 Carbon materials, such as spheres, fibers, felts, and graphene, are widely used as electrodes in supercapacitors.235–237 In order to obtain excellent electrochemical performances, it is crucial for carbon materials to possess high specific surface area and a suitable pore structure. Conventionally, template methods are usually used to prepare carbon materials with an appropriate pore structure and specific surface area.238–240 However, the complex process and high cost are the key issues. The conversion of CO2 to superior carbon materials can be realized by the one-step electroreduction process in molten salts.
Carbon materials prepared by molten salt electrolysis are used as electrodes in supercapacitors.241–243 Hughes et al.241 found that nanocarbon materials with the amorphous, spherical, folded carbon, tubular, and plate-like structures can be obtained by the electro-conversion of CO2 in carbonate molten salt and can be directly used as electrodes in supercapacitors. With the decrease in temperature and current density during molten salt electrolysis, the specific capacity of electrolytic carbon displayed an increasing trend.241 The electrolytic nanocarbon with a high BET value of 329.5 m2 g−1 can be obtained at 1.2 A cm−2 and 500 °C. The specific capacitance is 230 F g−1 for carbon materials prepared at 0.15 A cm−2 and 500 °C.241 Similarly, bituminous coal was electrochemically converted to carbon materials with micro- or nano-structure in Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt (Fig. 18a and b).242 The obtained porous carbon materials possessed a high graphitization degree with the ID/IG value of 0.688 and specific surface area up to 519 m2 g−1.242 A capacity of 173 F g−1 was obtained at 5 A g−1 and less capacity loss occurred after 10000 cycles (Fig. 18c).242

(a) Preparation process, (b) morphology of electrolytic carbon at 750 °C, and 2.3 V after 5 h, (c) cycling performance of electrolytic carbon as electrode materials of supercapacitor at 5 A g−1 (the inset is the first and last 5 cycles). 
In general, it is confirmed that carbon materials prepared by molten salt electrolysis from various carbon resources are suitable electrode materials for supercapacitors and exhibit good capacitance performance. However, the investigation is still preliminary and the microstructure of carbon materials needs to be further adjusted to improve the electrochemical properties.
6.3 Catalysts
Electrocatalysis is an effective strategy to accelerate an electrochemical reaction and is widely applied in electrochemical energy conversion devices, such as water electrolysis, fuel cell, and air batteries. Advanced carbon materials as electrocatalysts or supports play an important role in the improvement of the electrochemical properties. Carbon materials with perfect graphite structure are usually inert and have no catalytic activity to chemical or electrochemical reactions. However, by doping heterogeneous elements or constructing defects on carbon materials, excellent electrocatalytic activity can be obtained in typical electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen evolution reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).181,244 Indeed, it is found that the catalytic activity of pure electrolytic carbon materials with nanoparticles and nanosheets obtained by the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 is low due to high-content carboxyl group.181 Sulfur-doping carbon materials are prepared by immersing electrolytic carbon into eutectic Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt with 8 mol% Li2SO4. Interestingly, the sulfur-doping carbon materials consisting of nanoparticles with the diameter range of 50–100 nm exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for ORR in 0.1 M KOH solution.181 With the increase in the electrolysis time, the graphitization degree and S contents (0.13–1.06 wt%) increase gradually. When the immersion time is about 12 h in molten salt, S-doped carbon materials exhibit the highest catalytic activity for ORR.181 In order to further improve the activity of the electrolytic carbon, sulfur and cobalt co-doped carbon materials were prepared by a similar immersion method.181 For S/Co-doped carbon materials with 2.18 wt% of sulfur and 4.689 wt% cobalt, the onset reduction potential (−0.047 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is close to that of Pt/C (−0.034 V, vs. Ag/AgCl) and more positive than that of S-doped carbon (−0.117 V, vs. Ag/AgCl).
It is confirmed that electrolytic carbon materials in molten salts are potential electrocatalysts. However, the investigation is still insufficient and further systematic works are needed. The adjustment of the microstructure, surface functional groups, and heteroatom doping during the electroconversion of secondary carbon resources may bring about unexpected electrocatalytic properties.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
It is an urgent task to dispose carbon pollutants, including the greenhouse gas CO2 and carbon solid wastes, in order to achieve the global target of carbon neutrality. Recently, a sustainable and feasible molten salt electrochemical method for the conversion of carbon pollutants to advanced carbon materials at the cathode has been proposed and well developed. Various inert anodes have been expectedly explored to ensure oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. The outstanding advantages are the simple process, high-efficiency, and controllable conversion. More importantly, the method is suitable for preparing various high value-added carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, nanosheets, nanospheres, graphene, or graphite from extensive secondary carbon pollutants. The obtained carbon materials can be widely used in the fields of batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, and so on.
Although carbon materials are prepared from CO2 in molten salt, a mixture with various structures is usually obtained. It is an important problem to accurately control the conversion reaction of CO2 to produce carbon materials with high purity and uniform morphology. The graphitization conversion of solid carbon wastes is still in the initial stage and the wide feasibility needs to be further confirmed. For carbon products from both CO2 and solid carbon wastes, the graphitization degree is still low, which limits their potential application, especially as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. An in situ catalytic graphitization method has been confirmed in the latest works. It provides an opportunity to accelerate the electro-conversion and improve the graphitization degree, which expectedly advances the performances of energy applications. In addition, the long-term stability of inert anodes is still improved, especially in harsh chloride molten salts. Meanwhile, the catalytic properties of inert anodes for oxygen evolution reaction are rarely studied and need to be focused on in the future.
Considering scalable application, the current efficiency and energy consumption are considered. The compatible capture and electro-conversion process of CO2 must be optimized. The amplification effect of solid carbon cathode to prepare graphitized carbon materials is the key issue. More importantly, the design of suitable industrial equipment is also a challenge to ensure continuous electro-conversion and product collection.
Thus, future research on the molten salt electroconversion of secondary carbon pollutants should focused on the following: (a) graphitization conversion mechanism of secondary carbon; (b) accurate control of the conversion reaction of CO2 or solid secondary carbon to produce carbon materials with high purity and uniform morphology; (c) in situ catalytic graphitization method to improve the graphitization degree; (d) the exploration of stable inert anode in extreme molten salts for oxygen evolution reaction; (e) the design of suitable industrial equipment for scalable application; (f) optimum electrolysis technologies with high current efficiency and low energy consumption in the whole process.
