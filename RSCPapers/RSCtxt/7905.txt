    , Accepted 29th May 2016First published on 31st May 2016AbstractThe two-magnon (2M) spin waves with a magnon frequency of 43 THz, generated by a polarized laser, were first observed in one-dimensional (1D) NiO nanorods. The 1D NiO nanorods of ∼700 nm length, which have perfectly in-plane antiferromagnetic spins lying on the (200) and (100) faces, are the smallest spin-wave waveguides. Due to the magneto-optical Faraday effect (MOFE), the significant change in the Faraday intensity can show the 2M information in the NiO nanorods. There are only two 2M-on and 2M-off states at various applied alternating-current magnetic fields and laser-incident angles, which make the 1D NiO nanorods excellent optical nanomagnonics.
Introduction
Antiferromagnetic materials have attracted much attention recently, because they have two opposite magnetic sublattices.1–4 NiO is an excellent antiferromagnetic material,5–11 whether in bulk form,5,6 thin films7,8 or nanoparticles.9–11 The antiferromagnetic spins of NiO are of interest for use in spintronics, such as in magnetic switching.12,13 In fact, NiO has many other unique properties, such as a wide bandgap,14 large specific capacitance,15 excellent capacity retention,16 high carrier density,17 colossal resistance,18 rapid switching time19 and stable resistive switching junctions20 in resistance-based memory, high photon-to-current conversion efficiency for sandwich dye-sensitized solar cells,21 high catalytic activity for carbon-monoxide oxidation,22 very fast coloration and bleaching times for electrochromic devices,23 and so on. Recently, the antiferromagnetic magnon property of NiO has also attracted much attention for use in magnonics, such as terahertz (THz) radiation,24 and magnetization control.25 However, apart from the studies mentioned above, there have been no successful uses of NiO in magnonics, because it is difficult to perceive the spin waves and magnonic functions in various nanostructures. Here we show the two-magnon (2M) THz spin-wave waveguides and optical magnonics in the one-dimensional (1D) NiO nanorods because the 1D morphology is more applicable to nanoelectronics and nanodevices26 as well as waveguides. Each of the as-synthesized 1D NiO nanorods has a flat square end and a straight body with four rectangular surfaces. The flat square end of the 1D NiO nanorod is the oxygen-rich (200) face, which has ideally in-plane antiferromagnetic spins. The in-plane antiferromagnetic spins lie perfectly on the (200) and (100) faces because of the straight rectangular body of the 1D NiO nanorods, and gives a good condition or medium for forming standing spin-waves. Their average length of ∼700 nm makes the 1D NiO nanorods the smallest spin-wave waveguides.
However, only a few previous studies27–29 reported the observation of spin-waves, because it seems difficult to acquire the real spin-wave propagations. In the previous studies,27–29 only Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy was used to detect and observe spin-waves, while the wavelengths of the detected and observed spin-waves are a few micrometers. Note that the spatial resolution of an optical method is limited only by the size of the focus spot.30 That is the reason why, until now, no study reported direct observation of the propagation of the spin-waves in the NiO nanorods or the other nanostructures. In addition, the polarized laser beam passing through the 1D NiO nanorods at various incident angles and at an applied alternating-current (AC) magnetic field perpendicular to the growth direction of the 1D NiO nanorods can generate and interact with the spin waves in the 1D NiO nanorods. Due to the magneto-optical Faraday effect (MOFE), the change in the Faraday intensity can show the 2M information in the 1D NiO nanorods. There are only two MOFE results at various incident angles and AC magnetic fields, which represent the 2M-on and 2M-off states, and it is these states that give the 1D NiO nanorods very good potential for use in optical nano-magnonics.
Experimental
Vertical-aligned 1D NiO nanorods were synthesized by the hot-filament metal–oxide vapor deposition (HFMOVD) technique, which is a powerful method to synthesize various high melting-point metal–oxide nanostructures.31–39 The details of the synthesis of 1D NiO nanorods on a Si wafer and an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin film coated on the glass substrate have been reported elsewhere.18,23 The surface morphology and crystalline structures of the 1D NiO nanorods were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-6500F) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100) with a selected area electron diffractometer (SAED) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, Quantum design, MPMS XL), and a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw system 1000) with 532 nm incident photons from a diode-pump solid state laser operated at a maximum power of 3.5 mW were used to determine the antiferromagnetic anisotropy and spin-wave waveguide of the 1D NiO nanorods, respectively. The application of the optical magnonics on the 1D NiO nanorods was evaluated by using a magneto-optical Faraday effect (MOFE) magnetometer40–42 (homemade) using a polarized He–Ne laser beam of 633 nm.
Results and discussion
Surface morphology and magnetic properties
The FESEM image in Fig. 1(a) shows the top view of the 1D NiO nanorod array on a Si substrate. The end faces of the 1D NiO nanorods are clearly flat and rectangular surfaces. According to a previous study,18 the array contains ∼20 nanorods per square micrometer, and the average width and length of the 1D NiO nanorods are ∼105 nm wide and ∼700 nm long, respectively. The spot size of the laser incident to the 1D NiO nanorods is ∼1 μm in diameter, because a micro-Raman spectrometer was used. The area of the spot size is ∼0.785 μm2, so ∼15.7 nanorods are covered by a laser spot. The high-magnification TEM images and SAED patterns of a single 1D NiO nanorod (Fig. S1(a)–(c), ESI†) verify the 1D NiO nanorods to be simple cubic crystals and preferentially grow along the [200] direction, so that the end surfaces of the 1D NiO nanorods are the oxygen-rich (200) faces. The (200), (100) and (010) faces of the simple cubic NiO structures present as the in-plane antiferromagnetic faces (Fig. S1(d) and (e), ESI†), but only the (001) face is out-of-plane antiferromagnetic. To verify the in-plane and out-of-plane antiferromagnetic anisotropy on the various faces, the magnetization is measured after the application of a magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the [200] direction, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Although some of the 1D NiO nanorods are at slight tilts, the angles are only a few degrees from the normal direction. The linear graph in Fig. 1(c) shows the two hysteresis loops obtained with the application of a magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the [200] direction. Obviously, the hysteresis loop, obtained at the field parallel to the [200] direction, shows up as an inversely proportional line. It is known that the Si wafer is a strong diamagnetic material, so the 1D NiO nanorods neither demonstrate a diamagnetic behavior nor contribute any magnetization at the applied magnetic field parallel to the [200] growth direction.

(b) The schematic diagram displays the magnetic field applied in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the [200] to measure the magnetizations. (c) The hysteresis loop, obtained at the field parallel to the [200] direction, is shaped like an inversely proportion line, but the other hysteresis loop, obtained at the field perpendicular to the [200] growth direction, is a typical weak ferromagnetic curve. (d) From enlarging the weak ferromagnetic hysteresis loop in (c), the loop is slightly opened at low magnetic fields, but it is closed above 500 Oe. The weak ferromagnetic–superparamagnetic transition occurs above the transition field (HT) of 500 Oe. (e) The applied magnetic field is parallel to the [200] direction, and none of the in-plane antiferromagnetic spins ideally lying on the oxygen-rich (200) and nickel-rich (100) faces interact with the applied magnetic field, or contribute to the magnetization. (f) When the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the [200] direction, the antiparallel spins (enclosed by the red open circles) in the in-plane antiferromagnetic faces are forcedly flipped to be parallel to the applied field, so they contribute to the weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism in the low and high fields, respectively. The (200) and (100) faces are highlighted in yellow and orange. 
However, the other hysteresis loop, obtained at the field perpendicular to the [200] growth direction, is a typical weak ferromagnetic curve as reported in a previous study,43 indicating that the 1D NiO nanorods do contribute a small magnetization strength. From the linear graph in Fig. 1(d), an enlargement of the weak ferromagnetic hysteresis loop in Fig. 1(c), it can be seen that the loop is slightly opened at low magnetic fields, but it is closed above 500 Oe. The loop becomes superparamagnetic above the transition field (HT) of 500 Oe, and there is a ferromagnetic–superparamagnetic transition due to both the nano-size and magnetic-field effects. The saturation magnetization (MS) at 900 Oe and remanent magnetization (MR) of the loop are 2.81 × 10−4 and 3.69 × 10−5 emu g−1, respectively, and the coercive field (HC) is 40 Oe. Compared with the two hysteresis loops, the diamagnetic and weak ferromagnetic (or superparamagnetic) behaviors are strongly dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field, confirming that in-plane and out-of-plane antiferromagnetic anisotropy exists in the 1D NiO nanorods. The schematic diagrams in Fig. 1(e) and (f) demonstrate that the applied magnetic field is normal and perpendicular to the in-plane antiferromagnetic (200) and (100) faces of the simple cubic structure. As shown in Fig. 1(e), all the in-plane antiferromagnetic spins ideally lie on the oxygen-rich (200) and nickel-rich (100) faces, so they do not interact with the applied magnetic field, nor contribute to the magnetization. In Fig. 1(f), the antiparallel spins (circled in red) at the in-plane antiferromagnetic faces are forcibly flipped to become parallel to the applied field, so they contribute weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism in the low and high fields, respectively. Note the simple cubic structure with the oxygen-rich (200) and nickel-rich (100) faces, highlighted in yellow and orange, respectively.
Raman scattering and two-magnon spin waves

Fig. 2 shows the setup and results of Raman scattering from the 1D NiO nanorods and bulk NiO. The two schematic diagrams in Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the polarized laser light incident to the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods vertically grown on Si substrates. Fig. 2(c) illustrates the three Raman spectra with the two-phonon (2P) and two-magnon (2M) Raman bands for the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO. The 2P Raman bands are located between 600 and 1200 cm−1, and the 2M Raman band is located at around 1500 cm−1. Obviously, the 2M Raman bands in the two Raman spectra of the bulk NiO and the top faces of the 1D NiO nanorods are similar to each other, but very different from the Raman spectra of the side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods. No matter what the bulk NiO or the top faces of the 1D NiO nanorods are, each has only one large 2M Raman band. However, the side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods have two small separated 2M Raman bands which are labelled 2ML and 2MH. It is known that the 2M spin-waves exist only in the bulk NiO,44,45 and previous studies have reported the absence of 2M spin-waves in any nanostructures.46,47 Therefore, the 2M spin-waves are first found to be present in the 1D NiO nanorods. The magnon frequency is 43.0 THz. In comparison with the Raman bands of the bulk NiO, all the 2P and 2M Raman bands of the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods are redshifted, so not only the magnons but also the phonons are confined by the two nanostructural factors of nanoscale size and low dimensionality.31–33 Note that the Raman shifts of all the 2P and 2M Raman bands are shown in Table 1.

(d)–(f) The three decomposed Raman spectra are shown for the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO, respectively. Three 2P Raman bands labeled 2P1, 2P2, and 2P3, and two small 2ML and 2MH Raman bands appear in the Raman spectra. The Raman shifts of all the 2ML and 2MH Raman bands are shown in Table 2.

The three Raman spectra that appear in Fig. 2(c) can be decomposed to understand why the 2M Raman band disappears but the 2ML and 2MH Raman bands emerge in the Raman spectra of the side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods. Fig. 2(d)–(f) show the three decomposed Raman spectra for the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO, respectively. All the Raman spectra have three 2P Raman bands labeled 2P1, 2P2, and 2P3, where 2P1 is double the transversal optical (TO) mode, 2P2 is equal to the TO band plus the longitudinal optical (LO) mode, and 2P3 is double the LO mode. Although the 2P modes are influenced by the phonon confinement effect, they are always present in the NiO nanostructures and bulk NiO. However, it can be seen in Fig. 2(e) that the 2M Raman band disappears, and only the two small 2ML and 2MH Raman bands emerge between 1200 and 1800 cm−1. The 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are considered to be one kind of 2M spin-wave, and they also exist in the top faces of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO. Apparently, the two decomposed Raman spectra of Fig. 2(d) and (f) also have the two small 2ML and 2MH Raman bands, confirming that the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves, as 2P modes, always exist in the NiO nanostructures and bulk NiO. As compared with those of the bulk NiO, the 2ML Raman bands of the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods are blueshifted, while the 2MH Raman bands are redshifted. The Raman shifts of all the 2ML and 2MH Raman bands are shown in Table 2.

Terahertz spin-wave waveguide
It is known that when a polarized laser beam is incident to the top faces of the 1D NiO nanorods, a 2M Raman band occurs, indicating that the THz 2M spin-waves can travel the short distance of ∼700 nm (the average length of the 1D NiO nanorods) as standing waves. The standing 2M spin-waves are first found to exist in the 1D NiO nanostructures. However, when the polarized laser is incident to the side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods, the 2M Raman band disappears, implying that the 2M spin-waves cannot propagate and stand for the much shorter distance of ∼105 nm (the average width of the 1D NiO nanorods). One can conclude that the 1D NiO nanorods are excellent spin-wave waveguides for the formation of standing 2M spin-waves along the growth directions of the 1D NiO nanorods, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The 2ML and 2MH spin-waves propagate only on the surfaces of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Hence, the 2M spin-waves are the standing waves, and the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are the surface waves. As is known, the antiferromagnetic materials possess two opposite magnetic sublattices,1–4 so it is suggested that the propagation of the surface spin-waves can be strongly influenced by the two sublattices. Specifically, the magnon frequencies are enhanced and reduced, respectively. The Raman shifts of the 2ML and 2MH Raman bands are evidently lower and higher, respectively, than the shift of the 2M Raman band. This suggestion is verified by examination of the as-synthesized 1D NiO nanoneedles lying on the Si wafer (Fig. S2(a), ESI†) by Raman spectroscopy. The two 2ML and 2MH Raman bands also appear in the Raman spectra (Fig. S2(b) ESI†), confirming that the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are surface waves and can be strongly affected by the two opposite magnetic sublattices.
 Fig. 3  Terahertz spin-wave waveguides in the 1D NiO nanorods. (a) With a laser incident to the flat square ends of the 1D NiO nanorods, standing 2M spin-waves occur and travel along the growth [200] direction, and the surface 2ML and 2MH spin-waves arise and propagate on the surfaces of the ends. (b) With a laser incident to the straight rectangular bodies of the 1D NiO nanorods, the standing 2M spin-waves do not occur, but the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves do appear and propagate only on the surfaces of the bodies. 
Optical magnonics
As mentioned above, the spin-waves of the 1D NiO nanorods are naturally influenced by the nanoscale size, low dimensionality, and magnetic sublattices. However, if the spin-waves can be artificially modified by an external force, such as a magnetic field, this would give the 1D NiO nanorods very good potential in magnonics. The schematic diagram in Fig. 4(a) displays the MOFE experimental arrangement for the magnonic 1D NiO nanorods. The inset photograph in Fig. 4(a) shows the 1D NiO nanorods deposited on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin film coated on the glass substrate to be transparent. The 1D NiO nanorods with the ITO/glass substrate are placed between two electromagnets that can provide an AC magnetic field. The AC magnetic field is perpendicular to the growth direction of the 1D NiO nanorods, which is the normal of the ITO/glass substrate. The polarized laser is incident to the 1D NiO nanorods with the incident angle (θ) to the normal, and the Faraday rotation is received by the detector. The linear graph in Fig. 4(b) demonstrates the two AC magnetic-field cycles, which reach the maximum field of ∼1800 Oe and vary as a function of time. Fig. 4(c) shows the two cycles of the normalized Faraday-rotation contours, which also vary as a function of time at angles ranging from 0 to 60°. Obviously, the variations of the normalized Faraday rotations at angles less than 30° are quite small, but those at angles greater than 30° are large. This is because the spin-waves play an important role in causing this phenomenon. When the polarized laser is incident at low angles of less than 30°, the standing 2M spin-waves are generated and travel along the growth directions of the 1D NiO nanorods. Since the traveling directions are perpendicular to the applied magnetic field, the standing 2M spin-waves are barely affected by the applied magnetic field. Therefore, this state can be called the 2M-on state. However, when the polarized laser is incident at large angles greater than 30°, only the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are produced on the surfaces of the 1D NiO nanorods. The propagating directions of the two surface 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are parallel to the applied magnetic field, so the two surface spin-waves are easily influenced by the applied magnetic field. It is called the 2M-off state, when the variations of the normalized Faraday rotations are large and at large angles greater than 30°. The two MOFE results make the 1D NiO nanorods excellent candidates for use in optical nano-magnonics.

(b) The linear graph illustrates the two AC magnetic-field cycles, which reach a maximum field of ∼1800 Oe and vary as a function of time. (c) The two cycles of the Faraday intensity contours vary as a function of time at variable angles from 0 to 60°. The variations of the Faraday intensity at angles less than 30° are quite small, but those at angles greater than 30° are large. This is called the 2M-on state at angles less than 30°, and the 2M-off state occurs at angles greater than 30°. 
Conclusions
The as-synthesized 1D NiO nanorods clearly have flat square ends and straight rectangular bodies. The flat square ends are the oxygen-rich (200) faces, which ideally possess in-plane antiferromagnetic spins, so the nickel-rich (100) faces ideally have in-plane antiferromagnetic spins. The standing 2M spin-waves and the two surface 2ML and 2MH spin-waves in the 1D NiO nanorods are detected by Raman spectroscopy. The flat square ends and straight rectangular bodies make the in-plane antiferromagnetic spins lie perfectly on the (200) and (100) faces, producing good conditions for the formation of the standing 2M spin-waves of 43 THz in the 1D NiO nanorods. The 1D NiO nanorods of ∼700 nm length are the smallest spin-wave waveguides. Using MOFE magnetometry, the information of 2M spin-waves at various AC magnetic fields and laser-incident angles can be probed. There are two magnonic states, 2M-on and 2M-off states, in the 1D NiO nanorods. At laser-incident angles less than 30°, the standing 2M spin-waves are generated in the 1D NiO nanorods, and it cannot be changed by various AC magnetic fields. The variations of the Faraday rotations in the 1D NiO nanorods are small or zero. At the laser-incident angles larger than 30°, the surface 2ML and 2MH spin-waves are produced in the 1D NiO nanorods, and they can be changed by various AC magnetic fields. The variations of the Faraday rotations in the 1D NiO nanorods are large. The two MOFE results for the 2M-on and 2M-off states show the 1D NiO nanorods to be excellent for use in optical nano-magnonics and next generation nanodevices working at high THz frequency.

 	Fig. 1  Perfectly in-plane antiferromagnetic spins lying on the (200) and (100) faces. (a) The FESEM image shows a top view of a 1D NiO nanorod array on a Si substrate. (b) The schematic diagram displays the magnetic field applied in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the [200] to measure the magnetizations. (c) The hysteresis loop, obtained at the field parallel to the [200] direction, is shaped like an inversely proportion line, but the other hysteresis loop, obtained at the field perpendicular to the [200] growth direction, is a typical weak ferromagnetic curve. (d) From enlarging the weak ferromagnetic hysteresis loop in (c), the loop is slightly opened at low magnetic fields, but it is closed above 500 Oe. The weak ferromagnetic–superparamagnetic transition occurs above the transition field (HT) of 500 Oe. (e) The applied magnetic field is parallel to the [200] direction, and none of the in-plane antiferromagnetic spins ideally lying on the oxygen-rich (200) and nickel-rich (100) faces interact with the applied magnetic field, or contribute to the magnetization. (f) When the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the [200] direction, the antiparallel spins (enclosed by the red open circles) in the in-plane antiferromagnetic faces are forcedly flipped to be parallel to the applied field, so they contribute to the weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism in the low and high fields, respectively. The (200) and (100) faces are highlighted in yellow and orange.	 

 	Fig. 2  Raman scattering from the 1D NiO nanorods and bulk NiO. (a), (b) The two schematic diagrams display the polarized laser light incident to the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods vertically grown on Si substrates. (c) The three Raman spectra for the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods, and the bulk NiO are shown. The 2P Raman bands are located between 600 and 1200 cm−1, and the 2M Raman band is located at around 1500 cm−1. The side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods have two small separated 2M Raman bands labelled 2ML and 2MH. The 2M spin-waves are first found to be present in the 1D NiO nanorods, and the magnon frequency is 43.0 THz. The Raman shifts of all the 2P and 2M Raman bands are shown in Table 1. (d)–(f) The three decomposed Raman spectra are shown for the top faces and side matrices of the 1D NiO nanorods and the bulk NiO, respectively. Three 2P Raman bands labeled 2P1, 2P2, and 2P3, and two small 2ML and 2MH Raman bands appear in the Raman spectra. The Raman shifts of all the 2ML and 2MH Raman bands are shown in Table 2.

 	Fig. 3  Terahertz spin-wave waveguides in the 1D NiO nanorods. (a) With a laser incident to the flat square ends of the 1D NiO nanorods, standing 2M spin-waves occur and travel along the growth [200] direction, and the surface 2ML and 2MH spin-waves arise and propagate on the surfaces of the ends. (b) With a laser incident to the straight rectangular bodies of the 1D NiO nanorods, the standing 2M spin-waves do not occur, but the 2ML and 2MH spin-waves do appear and propagate only on the surfaces of the bodies.	 

 	Fig. 4  Optical magnonics in the 1D NiO nanorods. (a) The schematic diagram displays the setup of the MOFE experimental arrangement for the magnonic 1D NiO nanorods. The inset photograph shows the transparent 1D NiO nanorods deposited on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin film coated on the glass substrate. (b) The linear graph illustrates the two AC magnetic-field cycles, which reach a maximum field of ∼1800 Oe and vary as a function of time. (c) The two cycles of the Faraday intensity contours vary as a function of time at variable angles from 0 to 60°. The variations of the Faraday intensity at angles less than 30° are quite small, but those at angles greater than 30° are large. This is called the 2M-on state at angles less than 30°, and the 2M-off state occurs at angles greater than 30°.
