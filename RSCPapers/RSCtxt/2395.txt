    , Accepted 12th May 2018First published on 14th May 2018AbstractPhase-controlled synthesis of nickel selenide nanostructures was successfully realized via a facile electrodeposition route with the same electrolyte at room temperature and by employing a Ni foam (NF) as the substrate and NiCl2 and SeO2 as the Ni and Se sources, respectively. The results indicated that pure NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 were obtained when the deposition potentials were −0.35, −0.46, and −0.60 V, respectively. The as-obtained products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that nickel selenide nanostructures exhibited clear phase-dependent electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). NiSe2 presented the best HER and OER performances. The NiSe2/NF electrode required overpotentials of only 104 mV and 279 mV to obtain the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 for HER and 20 mA cm−2 for OER, respectively. Moreover, three nickel selenide/NF electrodes displayed excellent catalytic stabilities.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, the research on exploiting new energy sources has been a focus worldwide. Some clean energy sources including solar, wind, and hydraulic power are considered as good alternatives to replace fossil fuels. Since hydrogen is also a clean energy source, and it reacts with oxygen to produce water and to liberate a plenty a large amount of energies; simultaneously, hydrogen and thus, it can be generated by water splitting, it is also a clean energy source.1 At present, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for electrochemical water splitting have been considered significant in material science. Theoretically, a minimum voltage of 1.23 V is needed for electrochemical water splitting. However, the actual electrolyzer commonly requires a higher voltage of 1.8–2.0 V due to the existence of overpotential.2 Thus, it is urgent to develop efficient and durable catalysts to reduce the overpotentials for water splitting.
Usually, Pt and RuO2 are separately considered as good catalysts for HER and OER,3,4 but their large-scale applications are limited due to their low abundance and high costs. Hence, it is important to find non-noble materials as catalysts for these reactions.5–8 In the recent years, nickel selenides have drawn increasing interests owing to their outstanding electronic and metalloid properties and extensive potential applications in many fields including water splitting, supercapacitors, photoelectrochemistry, and dye-sensitized solar cells.9–12 Especially, nickel selenides are considered as good candidates for the catalysis of HER because of the appropriate chemisorption free energy of atomic hydrogen, which is neither too weak nor too strong.13 For example, Gao and coworkers solvothermally prepared sea urchin-like NiSe nanofiber assemblies, which exhibited excellent activity for HER.14 McCarthy et al. synthesized nanostructured NiSe2 thin films via a direct reaction between metallic Ni and grey Se in a mixed system of ethylenediamine and mercaptoethanol at 25 °C for 48 h, and they found that the as-obtained NiSe2 thin films demonstrated high HER catalytic activity with 100% Faradaic efficiency.15 An Ni3Se2 film deposited on a Cu foam by an electrochemical route was used as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER with good durability in alkaline media, and it exhibited high activities of 10 mA cm−2 at 100 mV HER overpotential and 50 mA cm−2 at 340 mV OER overpotential.16 Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies prepared by a microwave-initiated reaction with a Ni foam in an NaHSe solution were also employed as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER;17 it was found that the electrocatalytic activity of the as-obtained Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies strongly depended on the pH value of the system. Also, the water splitting efficiency of Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies in a neutral solution was better than those observed in many previously reported studies.17 Yu et al. electrochemically deposited NiSe2 pyramids on N-doped graphene and found that the as-deposited NiSe2 pyramids exhibited superior water oxidation ability and cycle stability.18 However, to date, no report has been found in the literature on the phase-controlled synthesis of nickel selenides through electrochemical deposition and their phase-dependent HER and OER performances.
In the present study, we designed a simple potentiostatic electrodeposition route to successfully realize the phase-controlled synthesis of nickel selenides in the air at room temperature by employing NiCl2 and SeO2 as the Ni and Se sources, respectively, and a Ni foam (NF) as the substrate. The results displayed that pure NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 were deposited at the deposition potentials of −0.35, −0.46 and −0.60 V, respectively. The as-deposited nickel selenides could be used as the catalysts for HER and OER. In a 1.0 M KOH solution, three nickel selenides presented good catalytic performances for HER and OER and also exhibited remarkable phase-dependent characteristics; among them, NiSe2 exhibited the best HER and OER catalytic activities.
2. Experimental section
All reagents and chemicals were analytically pure and were bought from Shanghai Chemical Company; they were used without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout the experiments.
2.1 Electrodeposition of nickel selenide nanostructures
To obtain nickel selenide nanostructures, a typical three-electrode setup was used by employing a nickel foam (NF) as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Before electrodeposition, NF with a size of 1 × 2 cm2 was washed with 0.1 M H2SO4 solution, ethanol, and water for 20 min under ultrasonic assistance. The electrolyte was composed of 0.065 M NiCl2, 0.01 M SeO2, and 0.2 M LiCl. Nickel selenide films were deposited on the NF substrates at the deposition potentials in the range from −0.35 to −0.6 V (vs. SCE) for 60 min. Finally, the working electrode was removed from the electrolyte, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried at room temperature.
2.2 Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the products were collected from a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154060 nm) at a scanning rate of 0.2° s−1 and 2θ in the range from 10° to 90°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the product was conducted using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument with monochromic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) and at the power of 150 W. FESEM and EDS analyses of the product were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and 15 kV, respectively. For EDS analyses, the products were scraped from the NF substrates and stuck directly on a conductive tape.
2.3 Electrochemical tests
Electrochemical tests were carried out on the CHI 660E electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode setup with the as-prepared electrodes, a graphite rod, and the SCE as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The reference electrode was calibrated with 1.0 M KOH to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale in all measurements as follows: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 1.068 V. The ohmic potential drop correction was carried out to correct the polarization curves. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed in 1.0 M KOH solution to investigate the HER and OER electrocatalytic performances. For the HER measurement, LSV curves were obtained from 0 to −0.4 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1; for the OER measurement, LSV curves were obtained from 1 to 1.6 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Electric impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the potentiostatic mode at a potential of −0.12 V (vs. SCE) with a scanning frequency of 105–0.01 Hz. To find the reasons for the different electrochemical catalytic performances of the as-prepared electrodes for HER and OER, CV cycles were tested in the region from −0.4 to −0.3 V (vs. SCE) at the scan rates of 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mV s−1. The Janodic–Jcathodic value at 720 mV (vs. RHE) was obtained from a single CV cycle at a certain scan rate and then, it was plotted against the scan rate. Subsequently, the as-measured data were fitted into a line. Since the slope of this line was twice that of the geometric double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be calculated based on the equation ECSA = Cdl/Cs (Cs, the specific capacitance of the sample), which exhibits an atomically smooth planar surface at one unit area under a specific electrolyte condition. According to the previous reports,19–24 the Cs values of the Ni-based electrodes in alkaline electrolytes ranged from 0.022 to 0.040 mF cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. S1† depicts the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the electrolyte containing NiCl2, SeO2, and LiCl in the potential window of 0.0–(−0.7) V at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Three peaks appear at ∼−0.347, −0.464, and −0.606 V (vs. SCE), indicating that three different electrochemical processes occur at these potentials. In this study, the potentials of −0.35, −0.46, and −0.60 V are employed for the deposition of nickel selenides. Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of the products obtained by depositing the same electrolyte at various deposition potentials for 60 min. By comparing with the PDF card files no. 41-1495, 02-0892 and 19-0841, the products obtained at the potentials of −0.35, −0.46, and −0.60 V (vs. SCE) can be indexed as cubic NiSe2, hexagonal NiSe, and hexagonal Ni3Se2, respectively (see Fig. 1a, c and e). When the deposition potentials are in the ranges from −0.35 to −0.46 V and −0.46 to −0.6 V, the products include a mixture of cubic NiSe2 and hexagonal NiSe and a mixture of hexagonal NiSe and hexagonal Ni3Se2, respectively. Clearly, phase conversion can be realized in the same electrolyte by changing the deposition potential only.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the products obtained by depositing the same electrolyte at various potentials for 60 min: (a) −0.35, (b) −0.41, (c) −0.46, (d) −0.53, and (e) −0.6 V. 
Fig. S2† depicts the EDS spectra of the products obtained by the deposition of the same electrolyte at various potentials for 60 min. The Se and Ni peaks can be readily seen besides the carbon peak in the three products. The carbon peak can be attributed to the conductive tape. From the calculation of the peak areas, the Ni/Se molar ratios in the three products are 1:2.1, 1.02:1, and 1.45:1, which are very close to the values for NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2. The above-mentioned results confirm the formation of NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 at the deposition potentials of −0.35, −0.46, and −0.60 V, respectively.
In the present study, the deposition potential is a sole factor to control the phase of the final product and the other conditions were kept constant. The potential of −0.46 V is critical as at this potential, Se(IV) is fully reduced to Se2− ion. Thus, NiSe is formed. When a more positive potential was selected, some Se(IV) species reduced to Se(0), which then reacted with NiSe to produce NiSe2. As a result, a mixture of NiSe and NiSe2 was obtained. At the potential of −0.35 V, Se(0) and Se2− with the molar ratio of 1:1 were formed. Hence, phase-pure NiSe2 was generated. Conversely, after a more negative potential was selected, some Ni2+ ions were reduced to Ni(0), which then reacted with NiSe to produce Ni3Se2. This led to the co-formation of NiSe and Ni3Se2 and at the potential of −0.6 V, phase-pure Ni3Se2 was produced. A similar formation process has been found in the hydrothermal synthesis of nickel selenides.25 The related reactions can be described as follows: SeO2 + H2O = H2SeO3(1) H2SeO3 + 4H+ + 4e− = Se + 3H2O(2) Se + 2H+ + 2e− = H2Se(3) H2Se + Ni2+ = NiSe + 2H+(4) H2Se + Se + Ni2+ = NiSe2 + 2H+(5) 2NiSe + Ni2+ + 2e− = Ni3Se2(6)
To further analyze the compositions of the three products, the XPS technique was employed. Fig. 2 displays the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni and Se in the three products. Three Ni 2p XPS spectra shown in Fig. 2a, c and d present a similar outline and peak situations. The peaks at ∼873.8 and 856.0 eV with the satellite peaks at ∼879.5 and 861.5 eV, respectively, have an energy splitting of 17.8 eV, which can be attributed to Ni2+ in NiSe2.11,15 Furthermore, the binding energies at ∼853.1 and 870.4 eV can be ascribed to metallic Ni from the NF substrate.26 The binding energies of Se 3d for the three products exhibit a remarkable difference. In Fig. 2b, the positions of the Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks located at 54.7 and 55.6 eV, respectively, are consistent with those of Se22− in NiSe2 with the pyrite structure.27 In Fig. 2d, the Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks separately located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV, respectively, are in good agreement with those of Se2−.2 In Fig. 2f, the Se 3d peaks at 54.3 and 55.2 eV are separately located between 54.0 eV for Se2− and 54.7 eV for Se22− and between 54.9 eV for Se2− and 55.6 eV for Se22−, implying the existence of the mixed valence states. Moreover, a wide peak in the region of 58–61 eV can be attributed to the oxidized Se.28 Clearly, the successful formations of NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 are confirmed by the XPS analyses.

Fig. 3 shows the FESEM images of the products prepared by depositing the same electrolyte at various deposition potentials for 60 min. When the deposition potential of −0.35 V was used, the obtained product presented a porous film structure composed of nanoflakes (see Fig. 3a). When the potential of −0.46 V was selected, the product still displayed the porous film structure composed of nanoflakes (see Fig. 3b), but the sizes of nanoflakes markedly increased. At the deposition potential of −0.60 V, the product also exhibited the porous film structure similar to NiSe2. However, the nanoflakes forming the Ni3Se2 porous film clearly degraded (see Fig. 3c), which differed from that observed for the NiSe2 porous film. Markedly, the microstructures of the three porous films were different, which was attributed to their different formation processes. During the formation of nickel selenides, NiSe was formed first due to the rapid reaction between Ni2+ and Se2− ions. At the deposition potential of −0.46 V, the continuous nucleation and growth of NiSe resulted in the formation of porous NiSe nanofilms composed of nanoflakes with bigger sizes. This growth process was exclusive. At the higher/lower potential than −0.46 V, however, the produced Se/Ni atoms could further react with NiSe. Thus, new nucleation and growth centers appeared. As a result, porous NiSe2/Ni3Se2 nanofilms with smaller flake sizes were finally formed. Furthermore, as shown in the lateral FESEM images of three porous films in Fig. 3a–c, the thicknesses were 300 nm for NiSe2, 2330 nm for NiSe, and 1580 nm for Ni3Se2. The difference in the thickness was attributed to different deposition potentials. With the decrease in the deposition potential from −0.35 V to −0.6 V, the nucleation and growth rate to form the product increased, which resulted in an increase in the thickness within the same deposition time. However, since NiSe was composed of abundant nanoflakes with bigger sizes, the film was very loose (see Fig. 3b). This led to the NiSe film being thicker than the Ni3Se2 film, which was more compact (see Fig. 3c). Nevertheless, the porous film structures of the final products were unchanged when the deposition potential was varied. This provided a good opportunity to study the parameters affecting HER and OER electrocatalytic activity. In the current study, the correlation between the phase and the electrocatalytic performance of three products can be studied owing to their similar morphologies.

The HER catalytic activities of the as-prepared products were tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The loading mass of nickel selenides on NF was maintained at ∼2.3 mg cm−2 by controlling the deposition time. Fig. 4a shows the corresponding polarization curves of various electrodes in 1.0 M KOH solution. Compared with NF, the three products distinctly presented better HER electrocatalytic activities. To get 10 mA cm−2 current density for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, the overpotentials of −102, −153, and −170 mV were required for NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, and Ni3Se2/NF electrodes, respectively, which were far smaller than the overpotential of −255 mV required for the NF electrode. Also, compared with some reported HER electrocatalysts such as NiFe LDH/NF (210 mV),29 H2-CoCat (−385 mV),30 Ni2P nanoparticles (−221 mV),31 PCPTF (−380 mV),32 and CoOx@CN (−232 mV),33 these nickel selenide catalysts displayed stronger HER electrocatalytic activities. Fig. 4b depicts the Tafel plots of the as-prepared nickel selenide/NF electrodes. The linear parts were fitted for the Tafel equationη = blog(j) + awhere b is the Tafel slope, η and j represent the overpotential and the current density, respectively, and a is the cathodic intercept, which is related to the exchange current density. In the light of the Tafel equation, we can say that the smaller the slope, the lower the overpotential to drive the same current density. According to the obtained Tafel plots, we observed that the slopes for the as-prepared NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, and Ni3Se2/NF electrodes were 93, 99, and 148 mV dec−1, respectively. Clearly, NiSe2 exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity for HER. However, further investigations indicated that the NiSe2/NF electrode did not possess the best catalytic stability. Fig. 4c shows the relations between the current densities of various electrodes and the catalytic time. After continuously catalyzing for 30 h, the current densities were ∼11, 13, and 17 mA cm−2 for NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF and Ni3Se2/NF electrodes, respectively. Hence, the Ni3Se2/NF electrode had better HER stability than the NiSe/NF and NiSe2/NF electrodes.

It was found that the as-prepared NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, and Ni3Se2/NF electrodes also presented good electrocatalytic abilities for OER. Fig. 5a compares the OER polarization curves of NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, Ni3Se2/NF, and blank NF at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. An onset potential of 1.45 V for RHE was observed. To achieve a current density of 20 mA cm−2 for the OER, the required overpotentials were 274 mV for NiSe2/NF, 287 mV for Ni3Se2/NF, 329 mV for NiSe/NF, and 492 mV for NF. Compared with NF, the nickel selenide/NF electrodes presented superior OER electrocatalytic activities. Also, by comparison with some noble-metal-free electrocatalysts such as Ni3S2 nanorods/NF (420 mV),34 CoP nanowires/Ti mesh (310 mV),35 and exfoliated NiFe LDHs (305 mV),36 the as-prepared nickel selenide/NF catalysts exhibited better or almost the same electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, in the polarization curves of nickel selenide/NF electrodes, an oxidation peak could be seen at ∼1.36 V, which was ascribed to the transformation from Ni(II) to Ni(III).37 It is worth pointing out that the order of OER electrocatalytic activities of three nickel selenide/NF electrodes is NiSe2 > Ni3Se2 > NiSe, which differs from the order of NiSe2 > NiSe > Ni3Se2 for their HER catalytic activities. Nevertheless, NiSe2 still presented the best catalytic ability. From Table S1,† which compares the OER and HER electrocatalytic efficiencies of the present NiSe2 and different nickel selenide catalysts, it can be seen that NiSe2 had almost the same or even better catalytic activity.

The Tafel plots of the nickel selenide/NF electrodes for OER are shown in Fig. 5b. The Tafel slopes of NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, and Ni3Se2/NF are 97, 107, and 110 mV dec−1, respectively. NiSe2/NF exhibits the lowest Tafel slope, indicating the fastest Faradaic process on NiSe2/NF. Fig. 5c displays the changes in current density of various electrodes with the catalytic time. After continuously catalyzing for 20 h, the current densities are ∼13, 13, and 14 mA cm−2 for NiSe2/NF, NiSe/NF, and Ni3Se2/NF, respectively. Clearly, the current densities of the three electrodes show similar decays for OER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Usually, the decay of the current density during HER/OER can be ascribed to two reasons: on the hand, the generation of continuous H2/O2 gas bubbles may cause the removal of the catalyst from the electrode surface; on the other hand, the production of gas bubbles reduces efficient contact between the electrolyte and the catalyst.38
Moreover, to ascertain the effect of deposition time on the electrocatalytic performance of the as-prepared electrodes for HER and OER, NiSe nanosheets were selected as the representatives. Fig. S3† compares the HER and the OER performances of the NiSe/NF electrodes deposited at −0.46 V for the deposition times of 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, and 2 h. It was found that the NiSe/NF electrode obtained with the deposition time of 1 h had the best HER activity, and the one prepared with the deposition time of 1.5 h displayed a better OER activity than those obtained with different time durations. Fig. S4† displays the typical FESEM images of the NiSe nanofilms deposited at −0.46 V for various durations. By prolonging the deposition time, it was observed that the film gradually became more compact. Markedly, this affected the electrocatalytic activity of the NiSe/NF electrode. Generally, the active sites and resistance are the two factors that affect the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Within the short deposition time tested in the current study (for HER, ca.: 0.5–1.0 h), the active sites of the catalyst rapidly increased when the deposition time was prolonged. Hence, the active sites were predominant. Upon continuously prolonging the time, the thickness of the film increased, which made the resistance of the catalyst dominant. Thus, the electrocatalytic performance decreased.

Fig. 6a–c display the CV curves of three nickel selenide/NF electrodes in the potential window of 0.668–0.768 V (vs. RHE) and at the scan rates of 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mV s−1. At the same scan rate, the order of the current densities is NiSe2/NF > NiSe/NF > Ni3Se2/NF. To clearly reflect the electrocatalytic activities of the three electrodes, a linear relationship between the scan rate and the Janodic–Jcathodic value at 720 mV (vs. RHE) obtained from a single CV cycle at every scan rate is given in Fig. 6d. The Cdl values are 4.65 mF cm−2 for NiSe2/NF, 1.93 mF cm−2 for NiSe/NF, and 1.21 mF cm−2 for Ni3Se2/NF. Furthermore, the Cdl value is also determined directly by integrating cyclic voltammograms. In this study, three CV curves obtained at the scan rate of 40 mV s−1 were chosen for various nickel sulfide/NF electrodes to calculate their Cdl values. According to the CV curves, the double-layer capacitances are 5.3 mF cm−2 for NiSe2/NF, 2.4 mF cm−2 for NiSe/NF, and 1.5 mF cm−2 for Ni3Se2/NF. Clearly, the results obtained by these two methods are similar. Considering the linear relationship between ECSA and Cdl,39 the order of corresponding ECSA is also NiSe2/NF > NiSe/NF > Ni3Se2/NF. Usually, the higher the ECSA, the faster the dissipation rate of the gas bubbles. Since the catalytic active sites and the dissipation rate of the gas bubbles are two important factors influencing electrocatalytic water splitting, NiSe2 presents the best electrocatalytic activity; NiSe presents moderate electrocatalytic activity and finally, Ni3Se2 presents the lowest electrocatalytic activity during the electrochemical water splitting process. The above-mentioned activity order is in good agreement with that of the HER process, but it differs from that of the OER process, implying the presence of other affecting factors. To ascertain the reason for the different activity orders in the HER and the OER, the impedances of the three nickel selenide/NF electrodes were investigated. Fig. 7 depicts the Nyquist plots of the three electrodes. In general, the diameter of the curve in the high-frequency region represents the charge transfer resistance. The smaller the diameter, the lower the charge transfer resistance. As shown in Fig. 7, clearly, NiSe2/NF exhibits the smallest diameter; Ni3Se2/NF exhibits the bigger diameter than NiSe2/NF and finally, NiSe/NF exhibits the biggest diameter, indicating that the conductivity order is NiSe2 > Ni3Se2 > NiSe. This order is consistent with that in the OER, and it is different from that in the HER. However, by comparing the Cdl values in Fig. 6d and the impedances in Fig. 7, we can find that NiSe/NF and Ni3Se2/NF have similar ECSA and conductivity values, which are far smaller than those of NiSe2/NF. Thus, the above-mentioned different activity orders in the HER and OER processes can be attributed to the combined effect of ECSA and conductivity of nickel selenide/NF electrodes.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully realized the phase-controlled synthesis of nickel selenide nanostructures on the Ni foam through a facile electrodeposition route with the same electrolyte in the air at room temperature by employing NiCl2 and SeO2 as the Ni and Se sources, respectively. Pure NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 were obtained at the deposition potentials of −0.35, −0.46, and −0.60 V, respectively. At the potential ranges from −0.35 to −0.46 V and from −0.46 to −0.60 V, the mixtures of NiSe2/NiSe and NiSe/Ni3Se2, respectively, were obtained. It was found that the nickel selenide nanostructures exhibited clear phase-dependent electrocatalytic activities. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, the activity order was NiSe2 > NiSe > Ni3Se2; for the oxygen evolution reaction, the order was NiSe2 > Ni3Se2 > NiSe. The above-mentioned different activity orders were related to the combined effect of ECSA and conductivity of nickel selenide/NF electrodes. Owing to the biggest ECSA and the best conductivity, NiSe2 presented the best HER and OER performances. To obtain the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER and 20 mA cm−2 for the OER, the NiSe2/NF electrode required overpotentials of only 104 mV and 279 mV, respectively. The present study is a useful attempt for achieving phase-controlled synthesis of transition metal selenide electrocatalysts from a simple system through a facile electrochemical deposition route.
