    , Accepted 13th March 2023First published on 14th March 2023AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are presently on the cutting edge of contemporary materials chemistry providing excellent and tuneable optoelectronic properties. Here we report the synthesis, crystal structures, and linear optical, and dielectric properties of two newcomers to the family of two-dimensional (2D) HOIPs – IMMHyPbBr4 and IMMHyPbCl4 (IMPB and IMPC), respectively, where IM = imidazolium, MHy = methylhydrazinium) which adopt rarely reported alignment of PbX6 octahedral layers (X = Br, Cl), described as (110)-cut derivatives of 3D perovskites, with IM+ situated at the interlayer and MHy+ at intralayer sites. Both materials exhibit phase transitions with the high-temperature phase of monoclinic P2/c symmetry with both organic cations and the linking halide anion being disordered. On cooling, at 344.5 K (375.4 K) for IMPB (IMPC) a P2/c → P21/c symmetry breaking occurs which induces strong tilting of octahedral layers, with the lowest Pb–Xlink–Pb angle (143° for IMPC, Xlink = linking halide) ever reported for this class of compounds. Dielectric studies reveal a well-defined single dipolar relaxation process in the low temperature range from 150 K (170 K) to 188 K (230 K) for IMPB (IMPC), associated with the change in dynamics of the MHy+ cation. With the use of linear optical measurements, we demonstrate that both compounds exhibit broadband emission with a large Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons. The emission colour changes with temperature and IMPB is the first example of a mixed-organic cation perovskite showing white-light emission near 200 K. The structure–physiochemical property relationship is discussed with reference to other (110)-oriented lead halides.
Introduction
Widespread exploration of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) – a family of materials with a variety of physiochemical properties and applications, gives rise to the development of compounds with vast structural diversity.1–5 The flagship representatives, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) HOIPs with ABX3 formula and a high-temperature (HT) cubic Pmm symmetry, built using corner-sharing PbX6 octahedra (X = Br−, Cl−, I−) and small monovalent organic cations (methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+)) filling the voids in between the inorganic network,6,7 exhibited remarkable optoelectronic properties (a power conversion efficiency of up to 25%, a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 85%, long carrier diffusion lengths, etc.) and are increasingly placed as strong candidates for solar cells.8–13 Apart from the aforementioned examples, only two newcomers appeared so far to meet the requirements of the 3D perovskite structure with lead halide octahedra, i.e., aziridinium (Azr+) and methylhydrazinium (MHy+).14–18 3D HOIPs comprising MHy+ are exceptional in terms of the polar crystal structure. They manifest the nonlinear optical effects, such as the second-harmonic generation (SHG), benefiting from the lack of the inversion centre.
The foregoing incorporation of different organic cations into the perovskite family leads to structures with reduced dimensionality: two-dimensional (2D, layered) HOIPs or 1D and 0D hybrid compounds. In 2D HOIPs, perovskite layers are separated by organic cations. Such a configuration improves the chemical stability and induces quantum well characteristics of the inorganic substructure with the insulating ‘spacers’. It is also worth mentioning that another degree of structural flexibility is achieved via the incorporation of either one or two organic moieties, resulting in compositions of the ABX4, A2BX4, or AA′BX4 formula for single-layered (n = 1) analogues. Depending on the relative stacking of perovskite layers, one may distinguish three structural families: Ruddlesden–Popper (RP, A2BX4, A = monovalent cation),19 Dion–Jacobson (DJ, ABX4, A = divalent cation),20 and alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI, AA′BX4, where A and A′ denote monovalent cations)21 compounds. Facile manipulation of components, together with the quantum confinement effect brings more paths of tunability and flexibility of the dielectric and optical properties obtained via structural engineering.4,22–24 When compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D HOIPs are usually characterized by higher exciton binding energies (typically >150 meV and ca. 10 meV for 2D and 3D perovskites, respectively),25,26 leading to enhancement of the PL intensity and improved PLQY.27–30 The mixing-amine approach may also improve the photovoltaic properties of hybrid perovskites. For instance, doping of imidazolium (IM+) to MA+-based 3D HOIPs increases solar cell efficiency.31 Moreover, the imidazolium derivatives are also used for the improvement of resistance to moisture, taking advantage of their hydrophobic properties.32,33
Considering the structural diversity of the 2D lead halide perovskites, one may describe them as derivatives of 3D structures, created by ‘slicing’ along particular crystallographic planes (001) (i.e., ‘sliced’ across the octahedral corners) and (110) (‘sliced’ across the octahedral edges).3,5 As can be seen in Fig. 1, in the (110)-cut family the inorganic layers are corrugated. Depending on the corrugation type, these structures can be labelled as ‘n × n’ or ‘n × m’, as presented in Fig. 1(b).34 Based on the online database of 2D perovskites published by Marchenko et al.35 633 representatives of (001)-cut lead halide HOIPs are found with only 25 (110)-oriented. The overwhelming majority of the (001)-cut perovskites proves that such a configuration is the most preferable and tolerant to the substitution of both inorganic and organic components.36 Nevertheless, the (110)-derived compounds have proven their usefulness in optoelectronics, revealing, for instance, broadband white light emission with higher PLQY and larger Stokes shifts than their (001)-cut counterparts due to a greater degree of dielectric confinement and octahedral distortion.37–40

Our previous studies showed that MHy+ may also be used as a ‘spacer’ for the layered lead halides with X = Br, Cl, I and that these compounds exhibit multiple functional properties like dielectric switching, ferroelectricity, PL, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.41–43 We have also recently reported three distinct compounds comprising IM+ cations and exhibiting broadband PL – IMPbBr3 with the 4H-hexagonal perovskite structure built using face- and corner-shared PbBr6; IM2PbBr4 adopting a 1D double-chain structure with edge-shared octahedra; and IM3PbBr5 adopting a 1D single-chain structure with corner-shared octahedra.44
To our best knowledge, only one example of hybrid lead chloride adopting the (110)-cut structure with two distinct organic moieties (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediammonium (TMEDA) at the interlayer site and dimethylammonium (DMA) at the intralayer site) was reported so far.45 However, this compound contains diammonium cations and its composition is TMEDA0.5DMAPbCl4, not AA′BX4, as typically reported for the ACI perovskites. In the case of its bromine counterparts, there are 7 known ACI analogues, i.e., two comprising IM+ – IMGUAPbBr4 and IMTzPbBr4 (GUA = guanidinium, Tz = 1,2,4-triazolium),36,46 and five comprising other organic cations – FAHEAPbBr4, PYGUAPbBr4, PYTzPbBr4, TzGUAPbBr4 and FA1.5AA0.5PbBr4 (HEA = hydroxyethylammonium, PY = pyrazolium, AA = acetamidinium).38,46,47 There are also several examples of (110)-oriented bromides and chlorides with one, mainly divalent organic cation.36,39,40,48–54 One should note that there is no structure containing MHy+ and that studies of ACI bromides and chlorides were limited principally to crystal structures and room-temperature (RT) absorption. Temperature-dependent PL was reported for only one representative, i.e., IMTzPbBr4.36 Furthermore, there are no reports on dielectric properties, and the structural phase transition was revealed only in TzGUAPbBr4.46
A short survey of literature data shows that the (110)-cut family of perovskites have great application potential but they are still very scarce, especially in the case of ACI analogues, and their properties are still poorly understood. Herein, we report for the first time two new representatives of 2 × 2 (110)-oriented ACI layered HOIPs comprising MHy+ and IM+ cations, i.e., IMMHyPbBr4 (“IMPB”) and IMMHyPbCl4 (“IMPC”). Using multiple techniques we investigate the crystal structure and phase transition mechanisms as well as the dielectric and linear optical properties of these compounds.
Experimental
Synthetic procedures
PbBr2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), PbCl2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), methylhydrazine (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), imidazole (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (37 wt % in H2O, POCH), hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) were commercially available and used without further purification. In order to grow single crystals, HBr or HCl was added dropwise to 6 mmol of methylhydrazine and 5 mmol of imidazole until pH = 7. Then 5 mmol of PbBr2 or PbCl2 was added, the mixture was stirred at 30 °C and DMF was added until complete dissolution of lead halide. The solution was left undisturbed at RT. The plate-like crystals were harvested after 2 days, separated from the mother liquid, and dried at RT. Their powder X-ray diffraction patterns are in good agreement with the calculated ones based on single-crystal diffraction data (Fig. S1, ESI†), confirming the purity of the bulk sample.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)
SCXRD experiments were carried out using an Xcalibur four-circle diffractometer (Oxford Diffraction) with an Atlas CCD detector and graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation. Absorption was corrected by multi-scan methods using CrysAlis PRO 1.171.39.46 (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction, 2018). Empirical absorption correction was applied using spherical harmonics, implemented in the SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. For the RT phases of both compounds, H atom parameters were constrained. All the crystal structures were solved in Olex2 1.555 using SHELXT56 and refined with SHELXL.57 Experiments were performed at 358 K (390 K) for the HT phase (I) of IMPB (IMPC) and at 295 K as well as 100 K for phase II of both compounds. The main experimental and geometric details are summarized in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). The succinct structural details, i.e., symmetry, unit cell parameters, and refinement factors, are as follows.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the ground crystals were measured in the reflection modes using an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffraction system equipped with a PIXcel ultrafast line detector and Soller slits for CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å).
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
Heat flow was measured using a Mettler Toledo DSC-1 calorimeter with a high resolution of 0.4 μW. Nitrogen was used as a purging gas, and the heating and cooling rate was 5 K min−1. The mass of the measured samples was 23.00 mg and 33.49 mg for IMPB and IMPC, respectively. The excess heat capacity associated with the phase transition was calculated by subtraction of the baseline from the data representing the system variation in the absence of phase transitions.
Broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS)
Dielectric measurements of the examined samples were carried out using a broadband impedance Novocontrol Alpha analyser. Since the obtained single crystals were not large enough, we did not perform single-crystal dielectric measurements. The powder was pressed into cylindrical pellets of 5 mm in diameter and about 0.5 mm in thickness. The silver paste was deposited on the pellet surface to ensure good electrical contact. A sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude of 1 V and a frequency in the range of 1 Hz–1 MHz was applied across the sample. The studies were performed in the temperature range of 150–400 K for IMPB and 175–425 K for IMPC. The temperature was stabilized using nitrogen gas using the Novocontrol Quattro system.
Optical measurements
The RT diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of powdered samples were obtained using the Varian Cary 5E UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer. Measurements of temperature-dependent PL were performed with the Hamamatsu PMA-12 photonic multichannel analyser combined with a BT-CCD sensor while the temperature was controlled using the Linkam THMS600 stage. As an excitation source, the 266 nm laser beam was used.
Results and discussion
Thermal properties
The calorimetric measurements showed one reversible phase transition (PT) at 344.5 K (356.9 K) and 375.4 K (383.3 K) visible in the cooling (heating) mode for IMPB (Fig. 2(a)) and IMPC (Fig. 2(b)), respectively. The symmetrical, sharp peaks seen in ΔCp plotted as a function of temperature and the evident thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling cycles indicate the first-order type of PTs. This is also confirmed by the accompanying discontinuous change in the entropy (ΔS) (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). The changes of ΔS were estimated to be 6.6 J mol−1 K−1 (6.4 J mol−1 K−1) for IMPB (Fig. 2(a)) and 9.37 J mol−1 K−1 (8.67 J mol−1 K−1) for IMPC (Fig. 2(b)). For an order–disorder transition, ΔS = Rln(N), where R is the gas constant and N is the ratio of the number of configurations in the disordered and ordered phase. The estimated N is 2.20 and 3.09 for IMPB and IMPC, respectively. These values imply an important contribution of order–disorder processes in the mechanism of PT. The temperature of the PT and the estimated entropy change are higher for the chloride analogue.

Crystal structure
Crystal structures of both IMPB and IMPC compounds represent the ACI family with IM+ occupying the interlayer site and MHy+ placed at the intralayer site. The HT phases (I) are isostructural, described in a monoclinic, centrosymmetric P2/c space group, with the number of formula units per unit cell (Z) equal to 2. The crystal structure of I is presented in Fig. 3(a). The inorganic layers adopt a corrugated 2 × 2 (110)-oriented arrangement, composed of [PbX6]∞ octahedra (X = Br, Cl) sharing cis ligands. The Pb–X distances are 2.898(1)–3.110(7) Å and 2.755(4)–2.99(4) Å for IMPB and IMPC, respectively. Both organic cations exhibit dynamic disorder. Consequently, there is no stable network of hydrogen bonding interactions (HBs). Bearing in mind that MHy+ cations occupy the intralayer site, their dynamics might initiate disorder of the linking halides, which are split into two symmetrically equivalent positions with equal probability (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The organic components have a slight impact on the geometry of single octahedra, which is expressed in the octahedral distortion parameters (calculated using Fleet's approach)58 – bond length distortion Δd = 8.3 × 10−4 (10.5 × 10−4) and octahedral bond angle variance σ2 = 13.7 deg2 (15.1 deg2) for IMPB (IMPC). These values are typical for the family of mixed-amine (110)-oriented lead halide 2D HOIPs (see Table S7, ESI†). The angular distortion results in deviations of Pb–X–Pb angles from 180°, with the largest deviation for the Pb–X–Pb angle with linking ‘X’ halogen (θlink) equal to 167° for both IMPB and IMPC. It is worth noting that there is no octahedral tilting observed in this phase.
 Fig. 3  Crystal structures of IMPB and IMPC in (a) HT phase I – P2/c and (b) phase II – P21/c at 100 K. Dashed lines in (b) represent the intermolecular interactions: green for N–H⋯X and C–H⋯X HBs, and blue for N–H⋯N HBs. 
As the temperature decreases, both compounds undergo a PT to a monoclinic and centrosymmetric phase of P21/c symmetry (phase II, Fig. 3(b)). The I → II PT is associated with a translational symmetry breaking and formation of the 2b superstructure (Z raises to 4). Analysis of the DSC curves suggests a change in the dynamics of the organic cations associated with this PT. Indeed, in II all the IM+ moieties are well-ordered and anchored via N–H⋯X and C–H⋯X HBs (green dashed lines in Fig. 3(b), for distances see Tables S5 and S6, ESI†). At RT, the MHy+ cations still exhibit a disorder which is, however, largely reduced compared to the HT phase – the CH3 and terminal NH2 groups are ordered, while the middle nitrogen is dynamically split into three distinct sites with equal probability (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Temperature decrease anchors one of the three positions and at 100 K the structure is well-ordered. One should also note that the creation of N–H⋯N HBs between IM+ and the terminal N atom of the MHy+ (blue dashed lines in Fig. 3(b)) might stabilize terminal NH2 of MHy+ at RT. The N atoms of MHy+ take an active part in creating N–H⋯X HBs with the neighbouring halide ligands, including the linking one. The intermolecular forces mentioned above induce tilting of the octahedral layers with θlink = 158° and 153° for IMPB and IMPC, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Interestingly, the geometry of the single octahedra is not remarkably affected by the PT, as expressed in Δd = 8.4 × 10−4 (20.1 × 10−4) and σ2 = 8.6 deg2 (17.3 deg2) for IMPB (IMPC).
As the lowering of the temperature leads to the change of interatomic distances, both the distances between corresponding Pb atoms of the neighbouring layers (dinter) and inside the layers measured along the [001] direction (dintra) decrease with temperature within phase II (Fig. S4, ESI†). With a decrease of dintra, increasing intermolecular forces between the inorganic part and MHy+ cations cause gradual ordering of this organic moiety without a change in symmetry of the crystals, eventually leading to the formation of a stable network of N–H⋯X HBs (Fig. S2c, ESI†). Furthermore, with temperature lowering greater octahedral distortions and enlarged octahedral tilting are observed (Fig. S3, ESI†), with Δd, σ2 and θlink equal to 13.5 × 10−4 (31.5 × 10−4), 28.7 deg2 (44.7 deg2) and 148° (143°) for IMPB (IMPC) at 100 K. The θlink angles of both IMPB and IMPC are exceptionally low when compared to analogues found in the literature (152°–180° for related compounds, see Table S7, ESI†). In other words, the octahedral tilting in the structures reported herein is significantly larger. This anomaly is correlated with one of the lowest dintra lengths for MHy+ as the intralayer cation (8.16 Å (7.96 Å) for IMPB (IMPC) at 100 K versus 7.98–10.42 Å for related compounds) caused by strong intermolecular interactions, especially N–H⋯X HBs. This effect is also observed in (N-MEDA)PbBr4 (N-MEDA = N-methylethane-1,2-diammonium)40 with comparable θlink = 152° and dintra = 8.39 Å at 100 K, and in the monoclinic phase of FA2PbBr4 with dintra = 7.98 Å at 100 K.51 In terms of optoelectrical properties, massive octahedral tilting may manifest itself in a propensity for increased energy band gap and broader PL emission.59,60
Dielectric studies
The structural dynamics were investigated via broadband dielectric spectroscopy experiments. The temperature dependence of the complex dielectric permittivity ε* = ε′ − iε′′ of both compounds depict distinct changes at a temperature that corresponds to the PT confirmed by other experiments (Fig. 4). The dielectric curves of both samples show similar behaviour. Above 200 K, the observed strong frequency dispersion of ε* is probably related to the induced ionic conductivity.18,61,62 The occurrence of this process in the vicinity of the PT temperature (dashed lines in Fig. 4) obscures the experimental response of structural changes, resulting in slight changes observed in both real and imaginary dielectric permittivity values. In the investigated frequency range, at low temperatures, the anomalies indicate the occurrence of a single dipolar relaxation process. Close inspection of the complex dielectric permittivity data in the frequency domain confirms that in the temperature range from 150 K (170 K) to 188 K (230 K) for IMPB (IMPC), a well-defined single dipolar relaxation process appears (Fig. S5, ESI†). For both compounds, this relaxation is visible as a gradual step-like change in the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity ε′ and a bell-like peak in the loss spectra ε′′ (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). To parameterize the characteristic dipolar relaxation times, the data were fitted with the use of the single Havriliak–Negami function.63 In order to understand the relaxation dynamics for both compounds, we compared the temperature-dependent behaviours of the dielectric relaxation times as a function of 1000/T (see Fig. 5(c)). In the investigated frequency range, the Arrhenius behaviour of the thermally activated single dipolar relaxation process for each sample can be recognized. The estimated activation energy for this process equals 0.269 eV and 0.326 eV, for IMPB and IMPC, respectively. The structural data indicate that the dipolar relaxation may be associated with the reorientational motion or angular jumps of the MHy+ cation. A higher (smaller) value of the activation energy for IMPC (IMPB) is consistent with the presence of stronger (weaker) HBs between MHy+ and Cl− (Br−) (Tables S5 and S6, ESI†), due to a smaller (larger) ionic size of Cl− (Br−) and thus a smaller (larger) size of the interlayer voids occupied by MHy+. The obtained activation energy values are close to the value obtained for MHy+ rotations in the metal–formate frameworks.64 This is also consistent with the suspicion that the activation energy of the dipolar relaxation process is proportional to the number of broken hydrogen bonds.65

Optical studies
The RT diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of IMPB and IMPC are presented in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†). The bands at 391 nm (IMPB) and 334 nm (IMPC) can be attributed to excitonic absorption. Energy band gaps (Eg) of both samples were determined with the Kubelka–Munk66 relation after subtraction of the low intensity peaks assigned to free excitons (FE), see Fig. S7a and b (ESI†). Graphical estimations of Eg were performed from Tauc plots (Fig. S6a and b, ESI†) and are equal to 3.22 eV and 3.79 eV for IMPB and IMPC, respectively. The Eg values are one of the largest amidst ACI (110)-oriented perovskites, however, they are similar to several single-amine examples (Table 1). The optical properties of the (001)-oriented perovskites depend on numerous factors, e.g., the interlayer distance, in-plane and out-of-plane Pb–X–Pb angles, shifts between adjacent layers and octahedral central ion displacement.41–43,59,67 In general, shorter interlayer distances and smaller tilting of the PbX6 octahedra, indicate more reduced Eg. However, the former factor was found to be much more important.59 In the (110)-cut family, the distortion of the perovskite layers seems to exert the predominant influence on the electro-optical properties, being even more important as the distance between the layers. In (110)-cut bromides and chlorides larger distortion (lower θlink) increases Eg in most cases, as summarized in Table 1. For instance, the non-distorted TzGUAPbBr4 and IMGUAPbBr4 with θlink = 180° possess significantly lower Eg values than MlaPbBr4 and IMPB (Mla = melammonium), which demonstrate much smaller or comparable interlayer distances but exhibit very strong deformation of the perovskite layer.46,49,53 The greater band gap of IMPC, when compared to IMPB, is associated with the Br to Cl substitution effect, resulting in lower interatomic distances and greater octahedral distortion. Analogous dependence was also reported for the 3APRPbX4 (3APR = 3-aminopyrrolidinium; X = I, Br, Cl) series and in mixed-halide 3D HOIPs with MHy+.18,53

The PL spectra (λexc = 266 nm) of the investigated materials show single bands (Fig. 6(a), (b), (d) and (e)) with the maximum at λem = 569.4 nm (FWHM, 160 nm) and λem = 586.6 nm (FWHM, 166 nm) for IMPB and IMPC, respectively, and the Stokes shift equal to 178 nm (252 nm) for IMPB (IMPC). The broadband emissions with large Stoke shifts are usually attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEx).27,68–72 Stability of STEx states increases with the enhancement of exciton–phonon coupling, and numerous studies showed that the intensity of STEx PL and Stokes shift increase with increasing distortion of the inorganic layers (decreasing θlink).27,68,72,73 Since the high level of structural distortions is typical of (110)-oriented perovskites,36,46,53 these compounds often show STEx related broadband emission, including the white-light one.39,40,45,47,48,51,53,69Table 1 shows that for many (110)-cut bromides and chlorides, larger distortion leads to an increase of λem and Stokes shift. However, this trend is less regular than in the case of Eg.
 Fig. 6  Temperature-dependent optical properties of IMPB: (a and b) thermal quenching of the luminescence and (c) CIE colour coordinates in the 1931 colour space chromaticity diagram; and IMPC: (d and e) thermal quenching of the luminescence and (f) CIE colour coordinates in the 1931 colour space chromaticity diagram. 
In contrast to some (110)-oriented materials, IMPB and IMPC do not exhibit PL bands associated with FE recombination.46,53 Furthermore, the observed PL is strongly temperature dependent (Fig. 6(a), (b), (d), (e) and Fig. S8, ESI†). The luminescent intensity decays with increasing temperature; the T0.5 parameters, which stand for the temperature at which the PL intensity has decreased to half of its initial value, are equal to 111 K (IMPB) and 127 K (IMPC) (Fig. S9, ESI†). To acquire the activation energies of thermal quenching, the Arrhenius equation was implemented: (1)where I0 is the initial intensity of luminescence (80 K), I(T) is the intensity at a given temperature T, c is a constant value, Ea is the activation energy of thermal quenching, and k is Boltzmann's constant. The calculated values of activation energy of thermal quenching are equal to 123.2 meV and 306.3 meV, for IMPB and IMPC, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†).
The increase in temperature induces a change in the position of the maximum emission intensity, which shifts toward higher wavelength values (Fig. 6(b), (e), Fig. S8, ESI†). To demonstrate this feature, the CIE (Commission Internationale de I’Echlairare) coordinates have been calculated (Fig. 6(c) and (f)). The shift of emission is especially visible for the IMPB sample, varying from warmer yellow (0.43, 0.49; 3666 K) at 80 K to colder white (0.34, 0.37; 5226 K) at 200 K. Such a strong dependence has not been observed for IMPC, where the CIE coordinates change from (0.47, 0.48) to (0.46, 0.46) in the 80–200 K range.
Conclusions
Two newcomers to the small family of ACI 2D HOIPs IMMHyPbBr4 (IMPB) and IMMHyPbCl4 (IMPC) have been synthesized. Both IMPB and IMPC adopt uncommon alignment of the perovskite layers, which may be treated as the (110)-cut derivative of 3D structures (i.e., sharing cis ligands) with interlayer IM+ and intralayer MHy+ cations. HT phases are isostructural, of P2/c symmetry (I), exhibiting disorder of both organic cations and linking halides. On cooling, both compounds undergo a P2/c → P21/c (II) symmetry breaking phase transition to a new monoclinic superstructure (b′ = 2b) inducing the tilting of inorganic layers, ordering IM+ cations and partial ordering of MHy+. On further cooling the MHy+ moieties stabilise their positions, eventually leading to structural alignment with record-breaking octahedral tilting (θlink = 148° (143°) for IMPB (IMPC) at 100 K) in the family of (110)-oriented lead halide 2D HOIPs. The distortion of inorganic layers manifests in the broad PL (FWHM = 160 nm (166 nm) with a maximum at 569.4 nm (586.6 nm) for IMPB (IMPC) at 80 K) with huge Stokes shifts (178 nm (252 nm) for IMPB (IMPC)), and one of the largest energy band gaps (3.22 eV and 3.79 eV for IMPB and IMPC, respectively) amongst (110)-oriented compounds. Linear optical studies also demonstrate a change in the emission colour in the temperature gradient, especially noticeable for IMPB (yellow to white within the 80–200 K temperature range). Dielectric studies revealed a single dipolar relaxation process in the low temperature range from 150 K (170 K) up to 188 K (230 K) for IMPB (IMPC), originating from the gradual positional ordering of the MHy+ cation.
Former studies showed that the MHy+ cation has the ability to serve both as a ‘spacer’ (in (001) 2D perovskites41–43) and a ‘perovskitizer’ (in 3D analogues16–18) cation. The present results demonstrate a third feature of this cation, i.e., it can also be employed in the synthesis of ACI phases with MHy+ at intralayer sites exhibiting a record-breaking large out-of-plane distortion of the inorganic layers. Our results also demonstrate for the first time white-light emission in the ACI perovskite.
