    , Accepted 15th August 2022First published on 30th August 2022AbstractLow-dimensional organic–inorganic metal halides with broad light emission have drawn widespread attention, however, the low thermal stability has been a major obstacle to their commercialization. Herein, zero-dimensional (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 with space group P21 was synthesized for the first time. (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 emits blue fluorescence at room temperature with external quantum efficiency as high as 42.5%, which are among the highest reported for Zn-based OIMHs, and it is comparable with the commercialized phosphors. Notably, the luminous integral intensity of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 at 470 K remains more than 50% of that at room temperature. Mn2+ doping of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 was conducted to improve the photoluminescence. With increasing Mn2+ concentration, the title compounds underwent fluorescence conversion from blue to green. The external quantum efficiencies of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+ were 43.7% and 42.9%, respectively. More importantly, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ exhibited different luminous colors at different temperatures. As the temperature decreased from 290 to 110 K, the luminous color changed from green to light blue. Finally, a composite film was prepared to demonstrate the temperature response of this material, and the absolute sensitivity reaches 0.57%/K. These findings fill in the gaps for low-temperature indication and expand the application scenarios of OIMHs.
1. Introduction
As a new type of photoelectric material, low-dimensional organic–inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) exhibit high structural and composition flexibility, with wide-ranging application in solid-state lighting,1–5 X-ray scintillation,6,7 nonlinear optics,8 temperature measurement,9–11 and solar cells.12–14 Materials for solid-state lighting should maintain strong luminous intensity at higher temperatures (∼80 °C). However, the luminescence intensity of most OIMHs decreases significantly with increasing temperature, which is known as the poor photoluminescence (PL) thermal quenching property, hindering their widespread commercial application.
The low luminescent thermal stability of OIMHs compared with that of conventional inorganic phosphors is mainly due to the flexible organic moieties in the hybrid materials. Currently, only a limited number of hybrid materials exhibit good thermal stability, e.g., (C10H16N)2MnBr4 exhibits almost the same PL intensity at 25 °C and 150 °C,15 and (DAO)Sn2I6 (Dao, 1,8-octyldiammonium) maintains almost constant PL intensity in the temperature range of 145–415 K.16 Recently, metallic zinc has attracted considerable attention because of its non-toxicity and antioxidant properties and the abundance of Zn in the crust. It has been proved that Zn can improve the thermal stability and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of OIMHs. IQE which is also known as photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) refers to the ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of absorbed photons under optical excitation; external quantum efficiency (EQE) refers to the ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of excited photons under optical excitation; EQE is more important to value the commercial prospect of phosphors which is lower than IQE. Lee et al.17 observed that after Zn2+ doping in CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals, the IQE increased by 85%, and the luminescence intensity at 413 K was 49% of that at room temperature. Compared with pristine CsPbI3 quantum dots, Zn2+-doped CsPbI3 quantum dots exhibited higher emission performance and the IQE increased by 120%; in addition, the EQE of light-emitting diodes nearly doubled from 7.5% to 14.6%.18 Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that Zn doping can improve the power conversion efficiency of the corresponding solar-cell devices.19,20
As mentioned above, Zn doping enhances the stability and IQE of OIMHs;21 however, the IQE of single-component Zn-based OIMHs is generally low. To our knowledge, the highest IQE of single-component Zn-based OIMHs is only 19.18%.22 Therefore, many studies in recent years have selected light-emitting organic moieties combined with Zn2+ to form highly stable PL materials such as (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4,22 (C6(CH3)5CH2N(CH3)3)ZnBr3(DMSO),23 and [(N-AEPz)ZnCl4]Cl (N-AEPz = N-aminoethylpiperazine).24 No C9H13N3 (1-(2-pyridyl)piperazine) hybrid metal halides have been reported in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre database, and C9H13N3 (1-(2-pyridyl)piperazine) exhibits blue-light emission under UV excitation and is thus very suitable as an organic part of Zn-based OIMHs. In recent years, more and more researchers have begun to pay attention to ion doping to improve the fluorescence properties of OIMHs.25–27 Zn2+ and Mn2+ can both easily form tetrahedral coordination with radii of 0.60 and 0.66 Å, respectively.28 Thus, Mn2+ is an excellent dopant to tune the luminescent properties of Zn-based OIMHs, as previously observed in Cs2ZnBr4:Mn,29 Cs3ZnBr5:Mn,29 and (C10H16N)2Zn1−xMnxBr4.15 Therefore, Zn-based hybridization may be a good strategy to overcome the problems faced by current OIMH systems.
With the deepening of research on OIMHs, many excellent practical applications have been explored. Temperature response has always been a critical application; however, most temperature detectors function in the high-temperature range.9,10 With the recent prevalence of COVID-19, the long-term preservation of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer has been critical, requiring deep refrigeration, with storage in an ultra-low temperature refrigerator at −70 °C for six months, in a special insulated transport box with dry ice for fifteen days, and then in a hospital refrigerator for only up to five days at 2 °C–8 °C. It is thus desirable to develop a low-temperature fluorescent thermometer (−100 °C to 0 °C) that can conveniently display the temperature during vaccine transportation, storage, and distribution.
To overcome the shortcomings of poor high-temperature light stability and adjustable color of OIMHs,2,30 in this work, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 with high EQE and good photostability at high temperature was prepared. A series of Mn2+-doped (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 was synthesized, which exhibited high EQE and excellent high-temperature PL stability. The activation energy (Ea) of the thermally activated nonradiative process of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 was calculated, and the superelevation thermal quenching property of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 is discussed in depth. Finally, the variable temperature (100–290 K) Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ were determined. By combining polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+, a thermal detecting composite was prepared, and the possible application of this new temperature-response intelligent material was demonstrated.
2. Experimental section
Reagents
1–2 Pyridyl piperazine (C9H13N3), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and manganese chloride (MnCl2) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl: purity 36%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Synthesis
C9H13N3 (500 mL), ZnCl2 (0.272 g), and HCl (4 mL) were mixed and stirred while heating (90 °C) to obtain a clear solution. The transparent (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 crystal was obtained by cooling to 25 °C at a cooling rate of 1.2 °C h−1. The synthesis method of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ (1–50%) was the same as that of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4. The feed ratios of ZnCl2/MnCl2 were 99:1, 95:5, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 1:1 and the amount of HCl was 6 mL.
Characterization
A PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer was used at 45 kV and 40 mA (Cu Kα radiation). The crystal structure was measured using a Bruker apex-ii CCD diffractometer under Mo Kα radiation and solved using OLEX2 software. The microstructure and elemental distribution of the alloy were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and EDS (JEOL JSM-6510 scanning electron microscope). PL spectra (room temperature and low temperature) and PLE spectra were obtained and the IQE and fluorescence decay lifetime were determined using a FLSP920 transient spectrometer (PMT detector and 150-W Xe900 lamp).
3. Results and discussion
(C9H15N3)ZnCl4 single crystal was synthesized using the solution method through slow cooling of the clear solution to room temperature, and transparent crystals were obtained. As shown in Fig. 1, the size of the crystal reaches the centimeter level. The crystal structure of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 is monoclinic, and it crystallizes in the P21 space group. The detailed structure is shown in Table S1, (ESI†) and more information is provided in the ESI† (Tables S2–S5). Like all zinc-based zero-dimensional (0D) OIMHs with tetrahedral coordinated inorganic groups, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 consists of tetrahedral ZnCl42− and the organic cation C9H13N3+. The Zn–Cl bond lengths range from 1.969 to 2.527 Å, this is consistent with the bond length range reported previously (2.2426 to 2.2885 Å for [(N-aminoethylpiperazine)ZnCl4]Cl).31

The optical properties of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 were studied. Fig. 2a presents the normalized luminescence spectra of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 and C9H13N3, both of which exhibited blue emission at 405 nm, a photoluminescence excitation (PLE) peak at 352 nm, and a Stokes shift of 53 nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 and C9H13N3 were 69 and 85 nm, respectively, and the fluorescence decay lifetimes were 8.49 and 6.67 ns, respectively (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the emission peak of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 at 405 nm can be attributed to the organic part. The difference is that (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 has a small shoulder at 523 nm, and its decay lifetime is 7.61 ns (Fig. 2d); therefore, it is inferred that the luminescence may originate from inorganic tetrahedra. Since the excitation peaks of the emission peaks at 405 and 523 nm are located at 352 nm, the excitation peaks belong to C9H15N32+, and the emission peaks of C9H13N3 and the excitation peaks of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 have obvious overlapping parts, it is speculated that (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 has an energy transfer (ET) from the organic part to the inorganic part during the luminescence process. After the organic part is excited by light, it emits 405 nm blue light. At the same time, part of the energy is transferred to the inorganic part, leading to the radiative transition on ZnCl42− tetrahedron. In addition, compared with C9H13N3, the luminescence intensity of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 is greatly improved (Fig. 2b), which may be due to the confinement of organic molecules by inorganic tetrahedron, which reduces the motion of the organic moiety, resulting in less nonradiative transitions and increased strength of luminescence.32

(C9H15N3)ZnCl4 materials with different levels of Mn2+ doping were synthesized using the same method. Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ prepared with a starting ratio of ZnCl2:MnCl2 = 1:1, and it is apparent that Mn was successfully incorporated into the material. Table S6 (ESI†) shows the ratios of Zn and Mn cations in the feedstock and those obtained from EDS. Overall, the Mn2+ concentration in the composites increased with increasing feed ratio. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Fig. 3) of different Mn2+-doped samples are consistent with that of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, with no additional diffraction peaks, indicating that the doped samples are pure phases.

The optical properties of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ were characterized, with two independent emission peaks observed at 405 and 523 nm, optimal excitation at 352 nm, and Stokes shifts of 53 and 171 nm, respectively (Fig. 4a). Similar to pure (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, the emission peak at 405 nm corresponds to C9H15N32+, and the peak at 523 nm corresponds to the 4T1 → 6A1 transition of Mn2+ and isolated center luminescence of ZnCl42−. Upon increasing the feed ratio of doped Mn2+ from 0% to 50%, the peak at 405 nm became weaker, whereas the peak at 523 nm became stronger. With increasing Mn2+ doping, the CIE chromaticity coordinates changed from (0.1627, 0.0972) to (0.2187, 0.5647) (Fig. 4b and Table S7, ESI†). Photographs of the luminescent crystals under 365 nm excitation are presented in Fig. 4c; the color changed from blue to green. Because the excitation peaks of these two peaks are the same, they belong to the excitation peak of C9H15N32+; therefore, ET also occurs during the luminescence process of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ series compounds. We then measured the fluorescence decay lifetime of this series of compounds (Fig. S2, ESI†). All the curves were fitted by the single exponential function of I(T) = Aexp(−T)/τ. For the emission peak at 405 nm, the decay lifetime decreased from 6.29 to 2.33 ns with increasing of Mn2+ doping, and the decay lifetime at 523 nm increased from 2.69 to 3.01 ms. This millisecond lifetime further confirms that the peak centered at 532 nm belongs to Mn2+ emission. We suspect that the ET channel is from C9H13N3+ to the 4T1 energy level of Mn2+. The energy transfer efficiency (ηet) under different Mn2+ doping was calculated using the following formula:33,34  where τ′ indicates the lifetime of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 at 405 nm, and τ0 is the lifetime of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ at 405 nm. The estimated values of ηet for compounds with different Zn2+/Mn2+ feeding ratios of 99:1, 95:5, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 1:1 are 5.7%, 27.4%, 34.8%, 50.2%, 59.4%, 64.8%, and 65.1%, respectively, indicating that the ET is efficient and increases with increasing Mn2+ concentration.

In general, the photoluminescence of Zn-based hybrid halides may be attributed to self-trapped exciton (STE)35 emission or d–s transition emission of Zn2+. Generally speaking, the FWHM of STE emission is larger, so the emission of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 at 523 nm may be attributed to the d–s transition of Zn2+, which has also reported in previous work.24 The luminescence mechanism of the (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ series compounds is shown in Fig. 5. Because there are three light-emitting centers, when excited by light, the electrons first transition from the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) of C9H15N32+ to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) and produce a radiation transition when returning to the HOMO. In addition, part of the energy is transferred from the LUMO of C9H15N32+ to the 4T1 orbital of Mn2+ and the ZnCl42− tetrahedron (resulting in Zn2+ electron orbital occupation from 3d10 to 3d94s), with the transition from 4T1 to 6A1 orbital and the electron orbital occupation of Zn2+ from 3d94s to 3d10, an emission peak appears at 523 nm. Under 352 nm excitation, the PL spectrum with Al2O3 as reference was used to measure the IQE and EQE of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ (Fig. S3, ESI†).36 The results demonstrate that the IQE of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+, and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+ was 48.9%, 50.2%, and 49.3%, respectively; the photoluminescence EQE was 42.5%, 43.7%, and 42.9%; and the absorption ratios were 86.9%, 87.1%, and 87.0%, respectively. Such high EQE and light absorption are also rare in pure inorganic phosphors, such as commercial β-SiAlON:Eu2+ under excitation at 303, 405 and 450 nm, the EQE is 61%, 41% and 33%,36 which may be due to the high absorptivity of C9H15N32+ itself and the high efficiency of ET, demonstrating the potential of this series of compounds as solid-state lighting materials.
 Fig. 5  PL mechanism diagram of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ (ET = energy transfer). 
Temperature-dependent PL spectra of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+, and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+ were collected from 110 K to 470 K (Fig. 6). Under 352 nm excitation, with increasing temperature, the emission peak at 405 nm of the three compounds gradually decreased because of the increase of coupling between electrons and phonons. With increasing temperature, the peak at 523 nm first increased and then decreased, and the maximum luminous intensity was observed at 260 K, 290 K, and 290 K for (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+, and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+, respectively. This phenomenon has been previously reported for [DMPZ]2SbCl6·Cl·(H2O)2 (DMPZ = N,N′-dimethylpiperazine),37 (C9NH20)2SnBr4,38 and [(H2O) (C6H8N3)2Pb2Br10].39 This may be because in the low temperature range, the increase in temperature will promote the opening of the ET channel from the organic part to the inorganic part, and the ET efficiency will increase, resulting in an increase in the luminous intensity with increasing temperature. In the high-temperature range (above 260 or 290 K), the thermal quenching effect of PL is greater than the ET; therefore, the luminescence intensity decreases with increasing temperature. All three compounds exhibited very good thermal stability, with T50 values of 470 K, 360 K, and 365 K for (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+, respectively (here, T50 is the temperature at which the luminous intensity is 50% that at room temperature). The activation energy of the thermally activated non-radiative process (Ea) was calculated using the following Arrhenius formula:40  where IPL is the PL intensity at different temperatures, I0 is the PL intensity at 0 K, Ea is the activation energy of thermally activated non-radiative process, and kb is the Boltzmann constant. Ea of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 is 114.2 meV (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is higher than that of previously reported compounds, such as (N(CH3)3)2SbCl5·DMF (174 meV) and (C6H15N)3InCl6 (45.4 meV). This may be the reason for the super-high T50 of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4.

As shown in Fig. 7a, the CIE coordinates of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ varied with temperature, and as temperature increased from 110 K to 290 K, the CIE coordinates changed from (0.1885, 0.3067) to (0.2053, 0.4208) (Table S8, ESI†). A cryogenic thermometer was fabricated by combining (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A composite film of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ exhibited blue fluorescence at 110 K and cyan fluorescence at 290 K (Fig. 7b). When the bottom of the composite column prepared with (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ was submerged in liquid nitrogen, a gradient from blue to cyan fluorescence was exhibited (Fig. 7c). Fig. 7d shows the integrated luminescence intensity of the organic (Io) and inorganic (Ii) parts of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ as a function of temperature, and it can be seen that Io decreases monotonically and Ii increases gradually with increasing temperature. By exploring the relationship between Io/Ii and temperature (Fig. 7c), it is found that the absolute sensitivity (S) of this new low temperature responsive material is 0.57%.41 This S value is lower than the S value of (PEA)2PbyMn1−yBr4 quantum well (1.44%/K). This is close to the S value (0.8%/K) of the dual-emission Mn2+-doped chalcogenide temperature-responsive material. The temperature measurement range is far larger than (PEA)2PbyMn1−yBr4 quantum wells (180–298 K).11,42 This series of studies may contribute to the development of a low-temperature indicator for the storage and transportation of the current novel coronavirus vaccine.

4. Conclusions
The zero-dimensional hybrid metal halide (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 was synthesized and crystallized in the P21 space group. (C9H15N3)ZnCl4 exhibited blue-light emission under UV light, and its T50 exceeded 470 K, with excellent high PL thermal stability compared to other OIMHs. Under 352 nm excitation, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ exhibited bimodal emission, and the change from blue to green light could be realized by adjusting the Mn2+ concentration. The IQE of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4, (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+, and (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:50%Mn2+ was as high as 48.9%, 50.2%, and 49.3%, and the photoluminescence EQE was as high as 42.5%, 43.7%, and 42.9%. Such ultra-high EQE is very rare in OIMHs. Two ET channels were observed in (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:Mn2+ from the organic cation C9H15N32+ to ZnCl42− and from C9H15N32+ to the 4T1 orbit of Mn2+. Finally, the CIE variable temperature coordinates of (C9H15N3)ZnCl4:5%Mn2+ were analyzed, and a thermally intelligent composite material was prepared by combining PDMS with a sensitivity of 0.57%/K. This work demonstrating the application potential of this material in the field of low-temperature measurement.
