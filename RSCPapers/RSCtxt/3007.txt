    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractBismuth-based ternary nanowires (NWs), including Bi19S27Br3 and Bi19S27I3, have been exploited as cost-effective and highly efficient Pt-free electrocatalysts in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Devices with them as counter electrodes (CEs) display a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8.70%, superior to that of a cell with Pt as a CE (7.99% PCE) under the same conditions.
Substantial work has been conducted on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) over the last two decades for their commercialization.1 As a crucial component of DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays two key roles in a typical DSSC device: collection of electrons from an external circuit and regeneration of I− from I3− in the shuttle reaction via electrocatalytic reduction. Thus good CE materials should exhibit high catalytic activity toward the reduction reaction of I3− (IRR), display good conductivity, and most importantly show excellent adsorption/desorption reversibility for the I3−/I− couple. As of now, noble metal Pt is the most widely employed CE in DSSCs, while its low natural abundance and very high cost are the major concerns limiting its large-scale applications. Moreover, Pt can easily undergo dissolution to PtI4 or H2PtI6 in iodic electrolyte solution in the long term,2 which hinders the commercialization of DSSCs.
Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) are of great interest due to their unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties that are distinct from their bulk counterparts. The NCs exhibit advantages in terms of non-toxicity, cost-effective synthesis, solution processability and tunable optical properties. Their promising applications have been demonstrated in photovoltaics,3 photodetectors,4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),5 thermoelectrics,6 and so on. Given their unique characteristics, colloidal NCs have also recently been employed as CEs for DSSCs, such as FeSe2,7 SnS2,8 CuFeS2,9 Ag–Ag8SnS6,10 CuInS2–ZnS,11 and Cu2ZnSnS4.12 Nevertheless, the device performance of DSSCs with NCs as CEs has not been satisfactory to date, and it is usually inferior to the conventional Pt-based device.7,8,12 One of the possible reasons is that the adsorption and desorption of iodine species on the CEs exhibit worse reversibility, which is a key factor for an efficient CE. Hence, it remains a challenge in seeking a NC-based CE with satisfactory performance for further development of DSSCs.
Recently, we have developed a colloidal chemistry strategy for the synthesis of Bi19S27Br3 (Bi–S–Br) nanowires (NWs) and evaluated their application potential in optoelectronics.13 In order to widen their application range and further tackle the above mentioned problem of NC-based CEs for DSSCs, we first simulated the adsorption and desorption behaviour of iodine species on the NWs via density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that the NWs demonstrate reversible sorption behaviour of iodine species, showing potential application as CEs in DSSCs. However, it is still unclear whether such bismuth-based ternary materials exhibit sufficient electrocatalytic activity in the IRR of DSSCs. To this end, we present an investigation of the NW-based CE for DSSCs. The results indicate that colloidal Bi–S–Br NWs show excellent electrocatalytic activity in a counter electrode reduction reaction (I3− to I−) and good electrochemical stability. Moreover, the DSSC device made of the Bi–S–Br CE yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.72%, higher than the control device made of a Pt CE (with a PCE of 7.99%), which has been attributed mainly to the reversible adsorption/desorption of the iodine species on Bi–S–Br or Bi–S–I CEs. Similarly, the DSSC made of a Bi19S27I3 (Bi–S–I) CE shows a high device efficiency of 8.71%. These results demonstrate that the present bismuth-based ternary materials (Bi–S–Br and Bi–S–I) exhibit halogen-independent catalytic performance towards the reduction of I3− and manifest great potential for application in developing low-cost and high efficiency DSSCs.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-synthesized Bi–S–Br NWs is shown in Fig. 1a, which matches well with the hexagonal-phase of Bi19S27Br3 (JCPDS No. 26-0813) and precludes the existence of impurities in the product. Fig. 1b and c present transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized Bi–S–Br NWs. The NWs display a narrow distribution with an average size of 9.1 nm (inset of Fig. 1c, the composition of the NWs was confirmed by EDS and XPS, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1d) show that Bi–S–Br NWs are highly crystalline with continuous lattice fringes. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (inset of Fig. 1d) on a single NW confirms its single crystalline nature. The lattice distance (0.201 nm) matches well with the (002) plane of the hexagonal Bi19S27Br3, indicative of the fact that the growth of NWs is oriented along the [001] direction. These results are in good agreement with our previous study.13

DFT calculations were first employed to simulate the electrochemical performance of Bi–S–Br in the IRR as the CE of DSSCs. The electrochemical performance of a CE is tightly correlated with its activity for the IRR, where the IRR can be generally described as follows: I3−(sol) ↔ I2(sol) + I−(sol)(1) I2(sol) + 2* → 2I*(2) I* + e− → I−(sol)(3)where * represents the free active sites on a CE material, and (sol) denotes the acetonitrile solution. Reaction (2) has been recognized to be fast in equilibrium.14 In contrast, the I2 dissociation and desorption of the adsorbed I atom determine the overall electrocatalytic IRR activity of the CE material. According to the classical Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relation,15 the optimal IRR activity requires intermediate adsorption energy of the I atom. We investigated the intrinsic activity of the IRR and the energy profile along the reaction pathway in the Bi–S–Br case in the absence of solvent effects and an electrode voltage. As shown in Fig. 2, an I2 molecule and I atom can preferably bind onto the active Bi center with a strength of −0.49 and −1.98 eV, respectively. In other words, the step of I2 dissociation does not limit the overall IRR reaction rate. It can also be seen, from a thermodynamic point of view, that the adsorption (−1.98 eV) and desorption (−1.97 eV) of the I atom on Bi–S–Br are spontaneous and apparently reversible than those on the surface of Pt (−3.40 eV, Fig. S3, ESI†), which is expected to exhibit superior IRR activity for the Bi–S–Br material.

We then performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the Bi–S–Br and Pt CEs toward the reduction of I3− to examine the electrocatalytic activities, which is important for assessing their application potentials in DSSC performance.16 The adopted electrolyte is acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 3a. Two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks (Ox-A/Red-A, Ox-B/Red-B) can be identified for both electrodes. The Ox-A/Red-A in the CV plots is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I3−/I−, whereas the Ox-B/Red-B to the oxidation and reduction of I3−/I2. Given that the left pair of peaks in cyclic voltammograms is closely correlated with the IRR catalytic ability of a CE, a further study will focus on it. It was reported that the peak current density reflects the catalytic activity of a CE, and larger current density is suggestive of higher catalytic activity.17 Moreover, the peak separation between anodic and cathodic peaks (Epp) is a very useful parameter for assessing the catalytic activity of a CE,18 and there is a negative correlation between Epp and the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction. The Epp of the Bi–S–Br electrode (ca. 109 mV) is significantly smaller than the Epp of the Pt electrode (ca. 149 mV) (Table S1, ESI†), indicative of the lower overpotential loss of the Bi–S–Br CE than the Pt CE in DSSCs. The higher peak current densities and lower Epp values (Fig. 3a) reveal that the Bi–S–Br electrode exhibits a higher catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−, which is a critical characteristic of an excellent CE in DSSCs; thus good photovoltaic performance of the Bi–S–Br based DSSC device could be expected.

To extract the relationship between the scanning rates and the peak current densities of Ox-A/Red-A (shown in Fig. 3b), we further compared the cyclic voltammograms at various scanning rates for Bi–S–Br and Pt electrodes (shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). It is observed that there is a linear relationship between the peak current densities and the square root of the scanning rates. According to the Langmuir isotherm principle, such a linear relationship demonstrates that the transportation of iodine species towards the CE in the cells is determined by diffusion limitation,19 and both Pt and Bi–S–Br display sufficiently high catalytic activity in the IRR of DSSCs. This is because of the fact that, as the scanning rate increases, the diffusion layer becomes thinner and the electrochemical polarization becomes larger, leading to a higher overpotential and worse reversibility.20
In order to understand the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Nyquist plots for the two electrodes are presented in Fig. 3c. The intersection of the high frequency intercept on the real axis corresponds to the series resistance (RS) of the cell, and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE) can be revealed by the left semicircle in the high-frequency range. Additionally, the right semicircle in the low-frequency range reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple transport in the electrolyte. The Nyquist plots for the two CEs were fitted by the Z-view software and the relevant equivalent circuit diagram is shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. The corresponding EIS parameters are shown in Table S1, ESI.† The Bi–S–Br CE shows a very similar RS value to the Pt CE due to the addition of small amounts of carbon black, and hence has a similar influence on photovoltaic performance. Generally, Rct is closely associated with the electrocatalytic activity of the CE towards the reduction of I3−. A small Rct benefits the charge transfer from the CE to electrolyte and consequently results in less interfacial recombination, whereas a larger Rct means sluggish electron transfer and often leads to a lower JSC of DSSCs. The Rct of Bi–S–Br is 0.99 Ω cm2, which is much smaller than 1.51 Ω cm2 for the Pt CE (Table S1, ESI†), indicating that the Bi–S–Br electrode is more efficient than the sputtered Pt electrode in terms of catalytic reduction of I3− at the CE/electrolyte interface. Effective reduction of I3− to I− could promote the dye-regeneration at the photoanode, resulting in an improved fill factor (FF) and enlarged photocurrent density (JSC).21 The ZN of the Bi–S–Br CE is close to that of the Pt, indicative of an improved electrolyte diffusion capability. These results are in line with the results from the CV measurements. Moreover, Tafel polarization was further applied to elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs and the interfacial charge transfer properties of the I3−/I− couple on the electrode surface. Fig. 3d comparatively presents Tafel curves of symmetrical cells based on Bi–S–Br and Pt CEs, respectively. Both slopes of the anodic and cathodic branches reveal that Bi–S–Br exhibits better electrocatalytic performance than Pt in reduction of I3− to I−.
Our previous study revealed that Bi19S27(Br3−x,Ix) alloyed NWs (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) show an unusual composition-independent band gap of ca. 0.8 eV and display a pronounced photoresponse with high stability and reproducibility.13 However, it is unclear whether variation in the halogen composition of these NWs affects the electrocatalytic performance in the IRR. To this end, we further evaluated the electrocatalytic activities of Bi19S27I3 NWs (Bi–S–I, TEM image, XRD pattern, EDS and XPS measurements are shown in Fig. S1, S2 and S5, ESI†). The electrochemical measurement results (Fig. S6–S8 and Table S1, ESI†), including CV, EIS, and Tafel polarization, indicate that the Bi–S–I NWs exhibit low charge transfer resistance and excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−, similar to the Bi–S–Br NWs. These results manifest that the bismuth-based ternary materials indeed exhibit composition-independent catalytic performance in the reduction of I3−, from which we can deduce that the active sites of the bismuth-based materials in the reduction reaction of I3− should be Bi sites and the halogens contributed little to the redox shuttle reaction.
Electrochemical stability affects significantly the application potential of DSSCs. To assess the electrochemical stability of the present NW-based CEs, the sequential CV for both CEs was measured for 150 cycles (Fig. S9, ESI†). It can be found that the current densities and the Epp experienced negligible alteration, manifesting that both the NW based CEs and Pt exhibit comparable electrochemical stability in this study.
The excellent electrocatalytic activity in the redox reaction of I−/I3− and good electrochemical stability make bismuth-based NWs potentially competent candidates as CEs for DSSCs. Devices with the bismuth-based ternary materials and sputtered Pt as CEs were finally assembled to assess their device performance under the same conditions. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all devices, and the corresponding highest photovoltaic parameters (statistics of the device efficiencies from 45 cells are shown in Table S2, ESI†) are summarized in Table 1. The Bi–S–Br based device displays a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.72% (with a VOC of 747 mV, a JSC of 16.34 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.41%), which are all higher than that of the Pt-based device (with a VOC of 734 mV, a VOC of 15.37 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.78%). It is notable that the improvement in PCE is mainly attributed to the increase of JSC and the FF, which can be attributed to the fast photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface, the low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I3−, the high diffusion coefficient of I3− and the rapid interconversion between I3− and I−. These results are in line with the results from electrochemical measurements in the above section. Moreover, a very similar device efficiency of 8.71% (Fig. 4 and Table 1) was achieved for the Bi–S–I CE, which is very close to that of the Bi–S–Br device, manifesting composition independent electrocatalytic activity in the CE reaction of DSSCs. It can also be seen that all devices show a comparable VOC of around 740 mV, which is due to the fact that the VOC is mainly determined by the energy level between the Fermi level of the photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte, whereas the CE materials has a minor influence on it.

In summary, bismuth-based ternary nanowires (NWs) have been successfully exploited as Pt-free, highly effective counter electrode (CE) materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The NW-based CEs exhibit low charge transfer resistance and excellent electrocatalytic performance in the reduction reaction of the I−/I3− redox shuttle. And theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption and desorption of iodine species on the bismuth-based CEs are spontaneous and much more reversible than those of a Pt surface. The device consisting of a Bi–S–Br or Bi–S–I CE demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8.70%, which is superior to the control device using sputtered Pt as the CE (7.99%). These results may pave the way for further studying environmentally friendly, economical and highly efficient CEs for DSSCs.
