    AbstractAlthough it is not yet technologically mature, the high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process offers potentially a feasible and environmentally benign way to convert carbon-free or low-carbon electrical energy into chemical energy stored in syngas with a desired H2 to CO ratio for further processing. An attractive application is to convert the as-produced syngas further into synthetic liquid fuels through the Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process. The synfuel can be used as alternative fuels in the transportation sector while keeping the existing infrastructure and motor engine technology unchanged. The combination of the high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process and the F-T process thus offers an efficient way to store electricity in transportation fuels. The implementation of such a quasi carbon-neutral process depends on its economic competitiveness. In the present paper, an economic assessment of this process is performed through process modelling and sensitivity analysis. As an energy-intensive process, the availability of cost-effective electricity is crucial for its economic competitiveness. Preferred electricity sources are probably nuclear power and surplus wind power, with which synthetic fuels could be produced at a cost comparable to BTL (Biomass to Liquid) process. The present process is biomass-independent, and can also be located in regions where solar energy is abundant.

Broader context
The burning of petroleum-derived liquid fuels for transportation makes one of the major contributions to the global CO2 emission. Alternative liquid fuels derived from low-emission energy sources are desired to meet the demand in the transportation sector. As the use of renewable but fluctuating electricity (e.g. wind and solar) strongly increases, large scale energy conversion and storage are certainly required. The electricity-to-fuel conversion is therefore inevitable in a future energy system. The high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process converts water and CO2 directly to syngas, which in turn can be converted to synfuel through the well-established Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process. The combination of the high-temperature co-electrolysis process and the F-T process offers thus an attractive solution to convert efficiently low-emission electrical energy to chemical energy stored in transportation fuel. Successful market entry of this technology certainly depends on its economic competitiveness. In the present paper, an economic assessment of this process is performed through process modelling and sensitivity analysis. As an energy-intensive process, the availability of cost-effective electricity is crucial for its economic competitiveness. Preferred electricity sources are probably nuclear power and surplus wind power, with which synthetic fuels could be produced at a cost comparable to BTL (Biomass to Liquid) process.

1. Introduction
The ever-increasing consumption of carbon-based fossil fuels worldwide as the primary energy source for electrical power generation, industrial and residential heating as well as transportation releases huge amount of CO2 to the atmosphere, resulting in unfavourable climate change. To mitigate the green house gas (GHG) CO2, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is being developed. Another important approach is to expand the utilisation of carbon-free (or low-carbon) energies such as nuclear energy and renewable energies (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, biomass etc.).1,2 The burning of petroleum-derived liquid fuels in vehicle motors for transportation makes one of the major contributions to the global CO2 emission. As petroleum becomes scarcer and more expensive, alternative fuels are desired to meet the demand in the transportation sector. The wide use of hydrogen as a clean transportation fuel is challenged by the lack of readily available infrastructure. In addition, many oil-poor countries are heavily dependent on foreign oil import, posing risks on their national energy security. In this context, it is beneficial to develop alternative sustainable liquid fuels derived from low-emission energy sources. One example is to convert biomass to diesel, which has been successfully implemented e.g. in Germany.3
The high temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis offers an alternative way to convert low-emission electrical energy to chemical energy stored in transportation fuel. Using electricity from carbon-free resources, this process can convert steam and CO2 to syngas (CO + H2), which can then be used as a feed stock for the production of synthetic fuel (synfuel) through the Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process,4 an established technology commercialised by Sasol and Shell. Additionally, pure oxygen can be obtained from this process as a value-added by-product.
The electricity source can be a nuclear reactor which produces cost-effective electricity with a very small carbon footprint. Alternatively, it can come from wind energy, which is characterised by its unfavourable intermittency but increased installations worldwide. Such an unpredictable intermittency results in difficulty in grid management.5 By storing the electrical energy in synfuels through the high temperature electrolysis process and F-T process, the renewable energy from wind can be used indirectly for transportation. It is also possible to re-convert the chemical energy back into electricity when needed. In this case, a buffer is supplied to alleviate the intermittency problem. In future, solar energy (solar-thermal and photovoltaic) could be another energy source as the installation increases especially in those sun-belt countries.
Recent research work has shown in the lab scale the technical feasibility of syngas production using the high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process.6–10 A process model11 predicted also a high overall thermal-to-syngas efficiency when coupling the co-electrolyser with a high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, successful market entry of this technology certainly depends on its economic competitiveness. The cost of syngas produced with this process is determined by factors like the cost and lifetime of the electrolyser stack, feedstock and energy prices etc.
In the present report, a syngas plant based on the high-temperature co-electrolysis process with a productivity of about 5 tonnes syngas per day is simulated with Aspen Plus®. The economy of this process is assessed, including a sensitivity analysis to various parameters. The production cost of synfuel with the as-produced syngas via F-T process is then estimated and its economic competitiveness discussed.
2. Process description
The principle of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) was schematically shown in Fig. 1. As driven by the externally applied d.c. voltage, oxygen ions (O2−) are pumped from the cathode (e.g. Ni/YSZ cermet) side, through the solid oxide electrolyte (e.g. yttrium-stabilised zirconia, YSZ), to the anode (e.g. La1-xSrxMnO3/YSZ) side. At the cathode, H2O and CO2 are reduced to H2 and CO, respectively: H2O + 2e− → H2 + O2−(1) CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−(2)
 Fig. 1  Principle of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) for the co-electrolysis of steam/CO2, producing syngas and oxygen. 
At the anode, oxygen ions are oxidized to oxygen: O2− → ½O2 + 2e−(3)
Besides the electrochemical reactions at both electrodes, chemical reactions can also occur in parallel. The most important one is the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O(4)
The RWGS reaction is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction in the presence of a solid catalyst such as Ni in the Ni/YSZ electrode. At high temperatures it is a kinetically fast, equilibrium reaction. In fact, it was considered8 that most CO2-to-CO conversion under steam/CO2 co-electrolysis conditions could be realised through the RWGS reaction instead of the electrochemical CO2-reduction reaction (2).
For the production of syngas with a typical H2 to CO ratio of 2, the total reaction can be written as: (5)
To split steam and CO2, energy must be supplied to the system. The total energy for the reaction is composed of electrical energy and thermal energy. The energy demand as a function of temperature for reaction (5) is shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding cell voltage in order to supply certain amount of energy is also indicated by the right axes in the diagram. The voltage is correlated to the energy according to the equation: (6) where V is the voltage in Volt, W is the energy in J/mol, and F is Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1).
 Fig. 2  Thermodynamics of the co-electrolysis of steam/CO2 for syngas production. The right axes shows the corresponding cell voltage of the energy needed. Thermal neutral voltages at 25 °C and 800 °C are indicated. 
At 25 °C, the total energy required by reaction (5) corresponds to a voltage of 1.48 V. This voltage can be regarded as the overall thermoneutral voltage, representing the total electrical energy required for the split of CO2 and H2O (with a ratio of CO2/H2O = 1/2) with both feedstock and product temperature at 25 °C and without any heat energy input to the system. The step of the enthalpy curve at 100 °C is attributed to the evaporation heat of water (equivalent to 0.14 V). From 100 to 800 °C, the (minimum) electricity demand decreases significantly (by 19.2%) and the (maximum) heat demand increases accordingly with increasing temperature, while the total energy demand remains essentially unchanged. Therefore, in comparison to low-temperature electrolyser (alkaline and proton-exchange membrane electrolyser), high-temperature solid oxide electrolyser has a potential to reduce remarkably the specific electricity consumption per unit of product. This feature translates into significantly reduced energy cost as heat energy is usually much cheaper than electrical energy. However, it does not naturally mean an equally reduced syngas production cost due to the offset effect from another factor, which is shown in the following sections.
In principle syngas could also be produced by separate electrolysis of steam and CO2. However, current Ni-based cathode material performs worse with CO2 electrolysis than with steam electrolysis.9,12 With the introduction of even small amount of steam or hydrogen to a predominantly CO–CO2 reactant stream, the cell performance is virtually identical to that of the cell on H2-H2O alone. An even more important reason for a preferred co-electrolysis is the high risk of carbon deposition in the case of dry CO2 electrolysis. The existence of steam and hydrogen can effectively avoid carbon deposition. Another option is to produce first only H2 by high-temperature steam electrolysis, then convert the CO2–H2 mixture to syngas through the RWGS reaction.13,14 Apparently the present steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process offers an advantage of simplified system design since syngas is in situ formed at the cathode of the electrolyser cell and a second reactor is not required.
3. Method of process modelling
A syngas production plant based on the steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process described by reaction (5) was simulated with Aspen Plus® (AspenTech). A process flow sheet containing all of the components that would be present in an actual high-temperature co-electrolysis plant was first created, and then the parameters for each component were established and optimised in order to maximize the energy conversion efficiency. A key issue in the design of the flow sheet was to maximize the recovery of the heat energy contained in the hot outlet gases. The heat was recuperated in a series of heat exchangers for the preheating of feed stocks. A large part of the heat was used for steam generation from liquid water.
Unlike the other components in the system, such as heat exchangers, compressors, pumps and electrical heaters, the high-temperature electrolyser is not a standard component in Aspen Plus. Therefore, the input and output of the electrolyser were calculated separately by taking into account the mass and energy balances. In the calculation of the composition of the cathode outlet gas, a local chemical equilibrium model9 was used, where a chemical equilibrium of the RWGS reaction (4) at the cathode outlet temperature was assumed. After leaving the hot zone, the gas composition is considered to be kinetically frozen. As shown in Fig. 3 as an example, the calculated results agree well with the experimentally observed results, indicating the validity of this model. The chemical equilibrium calculation was performed using HSC Chemistry® 5.1 (Outokumpu Research Oy, Finland).
 Fig. 3  Product gas composition and cell temperature as a function of current through an electrolyte-supported cell (active electrode area 16 cm2). The oven temperature is 850 °C, but the cell temperature increases with current. The cathode feed gas is composed of 120 sccm H2O(g) (60 mol.%), 60 sccm CO2 (30 mol.%) and 20 sccm H2 (10 mol.%). 500 sccm air was used to sweep the air electrode. Closed symbols indicate experimentally observed results and open symbols indicate calculated results by using the chemical equilibrium model. At a current of −24 A, the CO2/H2O conversion is 93%. 
The energy balance of the electrolyser can be expressed as: (7)where is the external heat transfer rate to the electrolyser, Ẇ is the rate of electrical work supplied to the electrolyser,  is the enthalpy increment rate of the reaction system, Ṅi is the molar flow rate of each reactant or product, Hi is the molar enthalpy of each reactant or product, TR is the reactant temperature at the inlet of the electrolyser, and TP is the product temperature at the outlet of the electrolyser. The molar enthalpy of each reactant or product is a function of temperature: (8) Cp = A + B·10−3·T + C·105·T−2 + D·10−6·T2(9)where Hf(298.15) is the enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K, Htr is the enthalpy of transformation, Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure, and A, B, C and D are coefficients estimated from experimental data. In the present study, parameters for the calculation of the molar enthalpy for each reactant or product were taken from HSC Chemistry® 5.1.
The rate of electrical work supplied to the electrolyser can be expressed by: Ẇ = VopI = Vopi Acell(10)where Vop is the average cell voltage during operation, I is the total current, i is the current density and Acell is the total active area of electrolysis cells in the electrolyser stack (single cell area multiplied by the number of cells in the stack).
The electrolyser can operate either isothermally or adiabatically. When operating isothermally, the electrolyser outlet gas temperature is kept the same as the inlet temperature (TP = TR) by regulating the heat exchange between the electrolyser and an external heater or cooler. Depending on the operating voltage, the electrolyser can work in three different modes: thermoneutral, endothermic and exothermic. In the thermoneutral mode, the enthalpy increment of the reaction system is exactly balanced by the electrical energy input to the system (Ẇ =  or  = 0), and operating voltage in this mode is called thermoneutral voltage: Vtn = /I(11)
In the endothermic mode, the operating voltage is lower than the thermoneutral voltage (Vop< Vtn), and extra heat energy input is needed to balance the enthalpy change ( > 0). In the exothermic mode, the operating voltage is higher than the thermoneutral voltage (Vop> Vtn), and extra heat energy has to be removed from the electrolyser ( < 0).
When operating adiabatically ( = 0), no external heater or cooler is used, and the electrolyser outlet gas temperature varies as a function of the operating voltage. As the operating voltage decreases, the electrolyser outlet gas temperature decreases to maintain the energy balance.
The following constraints were used for the modelling of the electrolyser under preferred conditions:
• The inlet gas at the cathode side contains 90% (CO2 + H2O) and 10% (CO + H2) and the outlet gas at the cathode side contains 10% (CO2 + H2O) and 90% (CO + H2). 11.1% of the outlet gas is recycled back to the inlet in order to have 10% (CO + H2) in the inlet stream to avoid oxidation of the Ni-based cathode material. A mass flow diagram of the electrolyser is shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Mass flow diagram of the electrolyser (normalised to 100 kmol gas input to the stack). 
• The conversion of (CO2 + H2O) to (CO + H2) in the electrolyser is 88.9%. Due to the cathode gas recycling, the overall conversion increases to 90%.
• The H2/CO ratio of the cathode outlet gas or the product gas was fixed at 2.12 by adjusting the H2O/CO2 ratio of the inlet gas. This ratio is considered optimal for the production of synthetic fuels using a Fischer–Tropsch process with a cobalt catalyst.11
• Besides syngas CO–H2 (H2/CO = 2.12), the product gas contains also a few percent of CO2 and H2O. The content of H2O is further reduced by the subsequent condensation-separation step.
• In the anode side, no purge air is used so that pure oxygen can be produced as a by-product.
• The designed syngas productivity of the system is ca. 5 t/day (1 t = 1000 kg). The electrolyser stack operates at around 1.2 bar. Considering that a typical FT reactor operates at pressures ranging from 10 to 40 bar, the syngas product is compressed to 20 bar in the designed system in order to be ready for that. The product temperature is 25 °C.
• Since one of the advantages of high temperature electrolysis is the capability to use cheap external heat energy and not to produce heat energy from electrical energy, an external cooler was not considered when operating the electrolyser isothermally.
• The electrolyser inlet gas temperature was fixed at 800 °C. The anode outlet gas (O2) has the same temperature as the cathode outlet gas. When operating isothermally, the electrolyser stack temperature and the outlet gas temperature was also fixed at 800 °C. When operating adiabatically, a temperature gradient along the gas flow path exists in the electrolyser stack. The outlet temperature can be either lower or higher than 800 °C. However, in order to avoid very large thermal stress in the stack, the maximum temperature difference between the inlet and the outlet was limited to 150 °C, i.e. 650 °C ≤ TP ≤ 950 °C.
In the present study, both isothermal and adiabatic operations were modelled. The isothermal operation of the electrolyser in the thermoneutral mode was chose as the baseline study. Based on the baseline study, effects of various parameters on the calculated production cost were studied (sensitivity analysis). For the analysis of adiabatic operation, two outlet temperatures, 650 and 950 °C, were chosen, representing a cell operating voltage of lower and higher than the thermoneutral voltage respectively.
To correlate the operating voltage to the current density of the electrolyser cell, the following equation was used: (12) where  is the mean Nernst potential of the operating cell, accounting for the variation of gas composition and temperature along the flow path of the cell.  is the mean area specific resistance of the electrolyser stack, accounting for the variation of temperature along the flow path of the cell when operating the electrolyser adiabatically. The area specific resistance characterises the stack performance, and includes all of the loss mechanisms in a serial repeat unit (SRU) of the stack such as ohmic resistance, activation overpotentials, concentration overpotentials, etc. It has a unit of Ω cm2.
For simplicity, the mean Nernst potential was calculated by averaging the Nernst potentials at the inlet and outlet of the cell: (13) where R is molar gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), F is Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1), pO2,R and pO2,P are the oxygen partial pressures of the reactant gas at the electrolyser inlet and the oxygen partial pressure of the product gas at the electrolyser outlet, respectively.
When the electrolyser is operated adiabatically, the mean area specific resistance of the stack was calculated from: (14) where ASR(T) was given by the following empirical equation: ln ASR(T) = 4900/T − 5.95(15)
This equation was derived from experimental data obtained with state-of-the-art planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks with hydrogen electrode-supported cells. At 800 °C (T = 1073.15 K), ASR is 0.25 Ω cm2.
4. Parameters for the economic assessment
As the technology of high temperature electrolysis is still under development, and large demonstration units for long-term operation are still not available, it is difficult to make a precise and definite cost assessment due to uncertainties related to the technology (e.g. manufacture cost, lifetime and reliability of the electrolyser stack under steam/CO2 co-electrolysis conditions). In the present study, parameters were estimated based on the state-of-the-art SOFC technologies and current commercial data for the baseline study. The results of the baseline study are considered realistic today or in the next a few years. The impact of various technological as well as external parameters on the production cost of syngas is studied by the sensitivity analysis. For the FT-synthesis process, economical parameters were simply taken from the literature since it is a well-established technology. The parameter values for the baseline study and the ranges considered in the sensitivity analysis are listed in Table 1 and are explained below.

4.1. Electrolyser
The state-of-the-art SOFC stacks with planar hydrogen electrode-supported cells and metallic interconnects have shown a lifetime of > 20000 h with a degradation rate of 0.75%–1% per 1000 h at 700–800 °C. The latest stack shows an even lower (∼ 0.4%/1000 h) degradation rate so that a lifetime of > 30000 h is expected.15 The ASR of the stack at 700–800 °C is in the range of 0.2–0.3 Ω cm2. Such a high-performance stack can be used also for the high temperature electrolysis. According to the experimental results,8,9 the ASR of the electrolysis cell remains essentially unchanged when switching from steam electrolysis to steam/CO2 co-electrolysis. In addition, the cell ASR for steam electrolysis is also comparable to the cell ASR when operating in the fuel cell mode (electricity-generation mode). Therefore, an ASR of 0.25 Ω cm2 at 800 °C is used for the baseline study. Regarding the lifetime of the co-electrolyser, no long-term degradation data have been reported. It is assumed in the present study that the co-electrolyser stack can run for 20000 h. For the sensitivity analysis, a lifetime range of 5000–80000 h was used. If electrolyte-supported cells are used in the stack, the ASR will be much larger, so an ASR range of 0.25–1.25 Ω cm2 is selected in order to cover this possibility.
Regarding the manufacture cost of the stack, Krewitt et al.16 suggested a long-term cost prediction of 300 €/kW for generic large SOFC cogeneration systems. A study carried out by US DOE/NETL17 indicated that an SOFC stack can be manufactured with the current technologies at a cost of 150–1500 US$/kW (i.e. ca. 100–1000 €/kW) assuming an annual production volume of 500–5 MW. The US SECA (Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance) program set a goal to reduce the manufactured cost of SOFC stacks to 170 US$/kW by 2010.18 In the present study, a price of 300 €/kW was used as a baseline value. Assuming that a typical power density of the SOFC stack is 0.5 W/cm2, this translates into a cost of 1500 €/m2 cell. A range of 500–5000 €/m2 cell is used for the sensitivity analysis.
The operating voltage of the electrolyser cells is 1.343 V (thermoneutral voltage at 800 °C) for the baseline study. At a lower voltage, the electrolyser operates in the endothermal mode. For the sensitivity study, a range of 1.100–1.343 V was chosen.
The annual maintenance cost for the electrolyser is assumed to be 4% of the acquisition cost. This value was taken from ref. 19, where 4% was used for an alkaline electrolyser.
4.2. Power converter
In order to convert the alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) required by the electrolyser, a power converter (in this case a rectifier) has to be used. In ref. 19, an efficiency of 95% and a cost of 130 €/kW were used. In ref. 20, however, an efficiency of 90% and a cost of 120 €/kW were used. In the present study, values of 92% and 130 €/kW were chosen for the baseline study. The lifetime of a rectifier is 100000 h. The latest product (from Eltek Valeres) delivers 96% power conversion efficiency. So a range of 92–96% was chosen for the sensitivity analysis. The annual maintenance cost is estimated to be 2%.19
4.3. Heat exchanger
The cost of each exchanger was estimated using Aspen Plus (module TASC+). An average price of 6000 € per unit was obtained. The lifetime of the high temperature heat exchanger (∼800 °C) is about 10000 h (commercial data). However, low temperature exchangers (< 300 °C) have much longer lifetimes. In the present study, an average lifetime of 15000 h was chosen for the baseline study. Materials with higher creep strength and higher oxidation and corrosion resistance can be used for the fabrication of exchangers with longer lifetime, but the cost will also be remarkably increased.21 The annual maintenance cost for heat exchangers is assumed to be 4%.
4.4. Compressor
The acquisition cost, maintenance cost and lifetime of a compressor were taken from ref. 19 (700 €/kW, 4% and 90000 h).
4.5. Other components
The cost of other components including water pump, splitters, mixers and separators is estimated to be 20000 €, lifetime 50000 h and maintenance cost 2%.
4.6. CO2 cost
CO2 released from fossil fuel power plants as well as some industry processes (e.g. cement production, steel industry, ammonia, fermentation) can be captured. The capture cost depends on many factors such as the type of power plant and the CO2 concentration in the gas stream.22 For most Rankine cycle power plants using steam as the working fluid, the capture was estimated to be 25–60 US$/tCO2. An IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) plant needs slightly lower capture cost (25–40 US$/tCO2). For industrial processes (ammonia, ethylene oxide and fermentation) that generate nearly pure CO2 streams, only compression cost (6–12 US$/tCO2) is needed to facilitate transport and storage. Therefore, these CO2 sources should be first exploited for use. According to the statistics of IEA in 2002, 194 large (annual CO2 emission > 0.1 Mt CO2) ammonia plants were identified globally, emitting 113 Mt CO2 per year.
The transportation cost has to be considered when the co-electrolysis plant is not located at the place where CO2 is captured. The most economic method to transport large amount of CO2 is through onshore pipelines. Offshore pipelines are about 40–70% more costly than onshore pipes of the same size. A cost competitive transport option for longer distances at sea might be the use of large tankers. The transportation through pipelines or shipping for mass flow rates of 5 to 40 MtCO2 per year would cost 1–8 US$/tCO2/250 km.23 Rail and road transport are generally more expensive. For instance, truck transport would cost 15 €/tCO2 for a distance of 60 km and 65 €/t for a distance of 250 km (commercial information).
The current commercial price of CO2 is, however, much higher than the estimated capture cost. A price of 160 €/tCO2 (incl. transport cost for 60 km and the tank renting cost) was recently quoted by a gas company for a daily consumption of 10 t/d. This price is used in the present study as a baseline value. As the capture technology and large-scale CO2 utilisation are widely employed, the commercial CO2 price is expected to drop. For the sensitivity analysis, a range of 20–160 €/t was chosen. The lower end of 20 €/t represents the compression and transport cost of pure CO2 sources (e.g. from an ammonia plant).
4.7. Deionised water
The estimated cost for the deionised water is 1.15 €/t.24
4.8. Electricity
To ensure that the co-electrolysis process has low carbon emission, carbon-free (or low-carbon) electricity has to be used. In the present study, the cost-effective nuclear power is considered as a favourable source of electricity. In this case, the electricity price in France is considered since 78% of the total electricity generation in France is from nuclear energy. The commercial price for an industrial customer depends on the annual consumption and the supply-demand relationship on the market. With a designed syngas productivity of ca. 5 t/day, an electrolyser plant requires about 15 GWh per year. According to the published EU statistic data (Eurostat), the electricity price in 2008 is about 56 €/MWh (without VAT) for an annual consumption of 2–20 GWh. This value was chosen for the baseline study. In the present analysis, the up-scale effect due to decreased electricity price for larger electricity consumptions is also considered. A plant with syngas productivity of 1000 t/day would consume 3000 GWh electricity per year (340 MWe). Since the price at such a high consumption level is not available with Eurostat, a value used for the perspective study in the European Commission project WETO-H2 (World Energy Technology Outlook – Hydrogen) is referred to in this study, i.e. 44 €/MWh in France.
Besides nuclear energy, wind energy is considered as another attractive electricity source due to its large capacity potential and low cost among various renewable electricity sources. In Germany, the use of wind energy expands rapidly thanks to the incentives legislated by the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). In 2008, the installed capacity reached 23.9 GW and the contribution of wind electricity to the total gross electricity consumption was 6.6%. There is still a large potential to increase through repowering of the current onshore sites and new installation of offshore sites. The latest scenario study (lead scenario 200925) commissioned by the federal ministry for the environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety (BMU) forecasts 66 TWh onshore and 30 TWh offshore wind power in 2020 (17% of total gross electricity generation). By 2050, the wind contribution could increase to 228 TWh (38% of total gross electricity generation). The current electricity generation cost from onshore wind farms is typically 50–120 €/MWh. For offshore wind farms, additional investments for foundation and grid connection are required so that the electricity generation cost will be higher. The initial tariff for off-shore wind electricity is currently set at 150 €/MWh in Germany. However, in the case of surplus wind energy, which can not be absorbed by the grid, the price could be much lower or even free. For the sensitivity analysis, a range of 0–200 €/MWh was chosen.
It should be noted that the present analysis focuses on nuclear and wind power as electricity sources mainly due to their large installed capacities worldwide and low electricity generation costs, which have already been demonstrated today and thus favour a large-scale and cost-effective electricity-to-fuel conversion scenario in the near-term. The use of solar energy, either the concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) or the photovoltaic (PV), remains another option as the worldwide installation increases and the cost decreases in the mid- and long-term.
4.9. Heat
In the designed electrolyser plant, the heat used for water evaporation and the heat required to preheat the feed gases to the operating temperature of the electrolyser stack are categorised as low-temperature and high-temperature heat respectively. Such a differentiation is necessary because different grades of heat sources are available in real applications. For instance, the current pressurised water reactors (PWRs) used in France can provide heat of about 300 °C, which can be used for steam generation, but not for the feed gas preheating to 800 °C, while the heat produced in a high temperature gas-cooled reactor can do both. Considering a thermal efficiency of 35% for a typical PWR, the price of the heat from a PWR is assumed to be 1/3 of the electricity price. In the present study, 20 €/MWh was chosen as the baseline price of the low-temperature heat. In the case of coupling a co-electrolyser to a PWR, the high-temperature heat should be generated from electricity using an electrical heater. Therefore, a baseline price of 56 €/MWh (the same as for electricity) was chosen. When varying the price of the electricity, the heat price will also be changed accordingly. In the case of wind electricity, all heat energy must be transformed from electrical energy, so the low-temperature as well as the high-temperature heat has the same price as the electricity price.
4.10. Credit from the sale of pure O2
The by-product of the electrolysis process, pure O2, can be sold to O2 users to reduce the production cost of syngas. Oxygen consumption in the U.S. and Europe is growing at a pace of about 3.5% per year over the past five years. Primary metals production (mostly steel) is the largest market of oxygen. In the past 20 years a strong market for gasification and the use of oxygen in environmental technologies has proven to be a very strong growth area. A small portion (in western Europe ∼ 7%) is used for health services. Cryogenic air separation is currently the most efficient and cost-effective technology for producing large quantities of oxygen with high purity (> 99%). Plant sizes currently built have reached 3500 t per day. The cryogenic oxygen production is an energy-intensive process. The electricity costs can be around two thirds of the total cost of oxygen production. The latest technology has reduced the electricity consumption to 300–325 kWh/tO2. Depending on the plant capacity (200–4000 t per day), the production cost of oxygen is in the range of 50–20 US$/tO2.26 For the baseline study in the present analysis, oxygen credit is not considered since the sale of large amount of pure O2 can not be guaranteed. For the sensitivity analysis, an oxygen sale price of 0–50 €/t is assumed.
4.11. Other parameters and assumptions
Loans were considered for purchasing equipment. The interest rate was chosen as 9% per annum.24 For each component, the loan was paid during the lifetime of the component with a constant payment each year. The price inflation of equipment, feedstock and energy was not taken into account. In addition, government subsidies or any credit for CO2 mitigation have been excluded from consideration. The annuities of each component was calculated with the following equation: (16)where A is the annuity of the investment, I is the investment cost (acquisition cost), i is the interest rate (%) and N is the lifetime (in years) of the component.
When wind energy is considered as the electricity source, the production capacity of the plant has to be increased (over dimensioned) to match the full-load power of the wind farm. In the present study, both onshore and offshore wind energies were considered. The onshore wind farm is assumed to operate 2200 h full load hours during the year. The offshore farm is assumed to operate 3800 h full load hours, which was taken from the specifications of the first offshore wind farm of Germany in the north sea - Alpha Ventus.27
5. Baseline study

Fig. 5 shows the flow sheet of the co-electrolysis plant in the case of isothermal operation of the electrolyser (power converter not included). The electrolyser stack operates at about 1.2 bar. Heat exchangers are used to recuperate the heat from the hot outlet gases for preheating the feedstock. The isentropic compression (COMPR2 in the flow sheet) of the product gas from 1 bar to 20 bar leads to increased temperature of the gas, which goes through another heat exchanger (HX2) to evaporate water. An additional low-temperature heat source is still needed to convert all liquid water into steam (HEAT1 in the flow sheet, 22 kW). Another high-temperature heat source is used to raise the temperature of the reactant gas to the stack inlet temperature (800 °C) (HEAT2 in the flow sheet, 46 kW). In the baseline study, only electricity is supplied to the electrolyser stack (HTE in the flow sheet) and it operates in the thermoneutral mode.
 Fig. 5  Flow sheet of the co-electrolysis plant when the electrolyser operates isothermally at 800 °C. 
The mass and energy balance for the baseline study on both the system level and the electrolyser level is shown in Table 2. The total energy input to the system amounts to 1612 kW, which is composed of 1544 kW electricity (96%) and 68 kW heat (4%). In the present baseline study, the high temperature heat (46 kW) is converted from electricity, so the actual electricity input is 1590 kW (98.6% of the total energy). The high heat value (HHV) and low heat value (LHV) of the product syngas is 1610 kW and 1437 kW, respectively (Table 3). The slight difference between the HHV of the product syngas and the total input energy is attributed to the fact that the feed stock temperature (CO2 and H2O, 20 °C) is lower than the reference temperature (25 °C) used in the definition of HHV. When the feed stock temperature was changed to 25 °C, the required input energy indeed decreased to 1610 kW. It should be noted that in the present energy balance analysis, thermal energy loss from hot surfaces and electrical energy loss on the power converter (efficiency < 100%) are not taken into account. In the subsequent economic assessment, the power converter efficiency is considered.

Using the baseline parameters listed in Table 1, the cost of product syngas was calculated to be 0.775 €/kg. The result is summarised in Table 4. The cost of syngas is energy and feedstock intensive, and is not capital intensive. The capital and maintenance contributes only 9.3% to the total cost. The major contribution comes from electricity consumption (57.3%). Due to relatively high cost of CO2 (160 €/t assumed for the baseline study), feedstock contributes about one-third (31.6%) to the total cost.

6. Sensitivity analysis in isothermal operation mode
6.1. Electrolyser performance, lifetime and cost

Fig. 6 shows the dependence of syngas production cost on the performance (measured by ASR) and lifetime of the electrolyser stack. As the stack performance decreases (higher ASR), larger cell surface area is needed to reach the designed productivity, resulting in higher capital cost. For a typical stack with cathode-supported cells (cathode means the hydrogen electrode of an electrolyser cell, CSC stack, ASR = 0.25 Ω cm2), the critical lifetime is about 10000 h. When the lifetime is shorter than 10000 h, the syngas cost will increase rapidly with decreasing lifetime. For a typical stack with electrolyte-supported cells (ESC stack, ASR = 1.25 Ω cm2), the critical lifetime is about 20000 h. When the lifetime is longer than 20000 h, the syngas cost decreases only slightly with increasing lifetime.
 Fig. 6  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the electrolyser performance (measured by ASR) and lifetime. 
The sensitivity of the syngas cost to the electrolyser cost depends certainly on the electrolyser performance (Fig. 7). For the highly performed electrolyser (ASR = 0.25 Ω cm2), the sensitivity is low. The syngas cost increases by only 8.5% when the electrolyser cost triples. And even the electrolyser cost decreases to as low as 500 €/m2, the syngas cost can only be reduced by 3%. For an electrolyser with ASR of 1.25 Ω cm2, however, the electrolyser price strongly affects the syngas cost. The syngas cost increases by more than 40% when the electrolyser cost triples.
 Fig. 7  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the electrolyser cost. 
6.2. Operating voltage
When the electrolyser operates isothermally, it is possible to operate at a cell voltage lower than the thermoneutral one, so that more heat can be used to replace expensive electric energy and lower energy expense is expected. However, lower operating voltage leads to lower current density so that larger cell surface area is needed, which increases in turn the capital cost. As shown in Fig. 8, these two counteracting effects result in a maximum cost reduction of only 1.5%. At an operating voltage of 1.1 V, where 18% of electricity is replaced by heat, the cost becomes even 1% higher. The benefit from replacing electrical energy with cheaper heat energy is more apparent when the electrolyser capital cost is lower. Fig. 8 also shows the calculation results in the case that the electrolyser cost is reduced from 1500 €/m2 cell (baseline value) to 500 €/m2 cell. At an operating voltage of 1.1 V, the syngas production cost can be reduced by 4%. Such a low electrolyser cost is, however, unlikely to be achieved in short term. Overall speaking, the benefit of operating the stack at lower voltages depends on the availability of high-temperature heat and is insignificant. Therefore, in the isothermal operation mode, thermoneutral voltage is recommended to simplify the system design (no external heating unit is necessary).
 Fig. 8  Effect of the operating voltage on the production cost of the syngas. At an operating voltage of 1.1 V, 18% electrical energy is replaced by heat energy. Two different high-temperature heat prices and two different electrolyser prices are compared. 
6.3. Power converter efficiency
Less electrical energy is consumed when increasing the efficiency of the power converter. Fig. 9 shows that the syngas cost can be reduced by 2.5% if the power converter efficiency is increased from 92% to 96%.
 Fig. 9  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the power converter efficiency. 
6.4. CO2 price
The CO2 price strongly affects the syngas cost (Fig. 10). If the price of CO2 is 20 €/t, the syngas production cost can be reduced by 27.5% with regard to the baseline cost.
 Fig. 10  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the price of CO2. 
6.5. Energy price and source
As shown in Table 4, the electricity cost contributes 57.3% to the total syngas production cost. Therefore, the electricity price is a key factor in determining the final syngas cost. Fig. 11 shows the dependence of the syngas cost on the price of electricity from difference sources. When wind electricity is used, higher capital expense is needed due to the partial loading operation of the plant, resulting in higher syngas production cost. At a representative price of 90 €/MWh for onshore wind electricity and 150 €/MWh for offshore wind electricity, the syngas generation cost will be 1.27 and 1.65 €/kg, respectively.
 Fig. 11  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the price of electricity from difference sources. 
It should be noted that these production costs are based on the physical cost of wind electricity distributed with the existing grid in Germany, where incentives are disregarded. In practice, an operator of the electrolyser plant can benefit from the legislated incentives. In addition, more economical production of synfuel from wind energy relies on the use of surplus and hence cheap electricity, which would be otherwise wasted since it is not needed or it is not manageable by the existing grid at the time when it is produced. At a market price of 45 €/MWh, the production of syngas using surplus offshore wind power would cost the same as in the baseline case where the electrolyser operates in base-load mode using nuclear electricity at 56 €/MWh (Fig. 11).
6.6. Credit from the sale of by-product O2
As shown in Fig. 12, significant cost reduction can be realised by selling the by-product O2. At an O2 sale price of 50 €/t, the syngas cost can be reduced by 10%.
 Fig. 12  Sensitivity of the syngas production cost to the O2 sale price. 
7. Adiabatic operation
When the electrolyser stack operates adiabatically, the outlet gas temperature varies with the operating voltage. Energy balance calculation reveals that the outlet temperature is very sensitive to the operating voltage (Fig. 13). The outlet temperature is the same as the inlet temperature (800 °C) at the thermoneutral voltage (1.343 V). It can increase to 950 °C or decrease to 650 °C when the operating voltage deviates only by 46 mV from the thermoneutral voltage. These two outlet temperatures were chosen for economic assessment under adiabatic conditions.
 Fig. 13  The dependence of the electrolyser stack outlet temperature on the operating voltage when operating adiabatically. 
For an outlet temperature of 650 °C, the flow sheet of the system is similar to the baseline case. Due to the lower outlet temperature, more low-temperature and high-temperature heat are needed for the feed stock preheating (Table 5). The total cell surface area has to be increased due to the reduced current density, resulting in a slightly higher investment cost as well as final syngas generation cost (4.4% higher than the baseline cost).

For an outlet temperature of 950 °C, the flow sheet of the system is also similar to the baseline case. Due to the higher outlet temperature, the high-temperature heater is not any more necessary, and less low-temperature heater is needed for the feedstock preheating (Table 5). The required total surface area is reduced due to higher current density, resulting in a slightly reduced investment cost as well as final syngas generation cost (1.6% lower than the baseline cost). It should be noted that possible harmful effect on the stack lifetime caused by higher outlet temperature is not considered in the present analysis.
From an economic point of view, it is beneficial to operate the stack at a cell voltage slightly higher than the thermoneutral one. However, from a thermo-mechanic point of view, a thermal gradient in the stack causes thermal stress that could endanger the structural integrity of the stack. It is apparently unworthy to take the risk of a catastrophic stack failure for such a small economic benefit. Furthermore, higher temperature normally leads to shorter lifetime of the stack. Therefore, also for the adiabatic operation, an operating voltage as close as possible to the thermoneutral voltage is recommended.
8. From syngas to FT-diesel
As discussed above, in the baseline case, the production cost of syngas using the co-electrolysis process is mainly determined by the price of CO2 and the price of electricity. Taking the credit of O2 sale into account, the syngas production cost can be expressed by the following two equations (in terms of unit mass and unit LHV of syngas respectively): Psyngas [€/t]= 73 + 1.52 × PCO2 [€/t] −1.54 × PO2 [€/t] + 8.19 × Pelec [€/MWh](17) Psyngas [€/MWh_LHV] = 10.69 + 0.2226 × PCO2 [€/t] −0.2262 × PO2 [€/t] + 1.199 × Pelec [€/MWh](18)
To estimate the cost of liquid fuel produced from syngas, economic parameters for the F-T synthesis and product upgrading were taken from ref. 28–30. The syngas conversion in the F-T reactor is 95%. Only 80% of the energy in the gas is retained in the paraffin FT product; the remainder is released as reaction heat. The selectivity of the FT process to C5+ products (liquid and wax) is 95%, the other 5% are gaseous C1–C4 products. The heavier FT products can be selectively converted into fuels in the hydrocracking step with 98% efficiency. The energy contained in the FT off-gas (i.e. unconverted syngas and C1–C4 products) can be used to generate electricity (the credit from this part is not considered in the present analysis). The overall energy conversion efficiency from syngas to FT C5+ liquids is (95% × 80% × 95% × 98% =) 71%. In the scope of this study it is assumed that all FT products are upgraded to yield diesel. The production cost of FT diesel from syngas is estimated to be 1.5 €/GJFT-diesel (5.4 €/MWhFT-diesel).29 The LHV of FT diesel is 36.3 MJ/l.28 The cost of FT diesel can thus be expressed by PFT-diesel [€/l] = 0.0142 × Psyngas [€/MWh_LHV] + 0.0544(19)
9. Discussions
9.1. Energy conversion efficiency
In electrolysers, the cell operating voltage is the key parameter in determining the energy conversion efficiency. As shown in the baseline study, the high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolyser can operate under moderate voltages (close to the thermoneutral voltage at the operating temperature, 1.343 V at 800 °C), but already with high current density of 1.46 A/cm2, enabling low capital cost (9.3% to the total syngas production cost) and small footprint of the electrolyser stack. Adding the electricity consumption for the product compression to 20 bar, the total electricity consumption is equivalent to 1.42 V, still lower than the overall thermoneutral voltage (1.48 V, cf.Fig. 2), so that extra low- and high-temperature heat is needed for the feedstock preheating. The energy conversion efficiency of the electrolyser (η = (syngas HHV)/(total input energy)) can be close to 100% if practical factors such as thermal insulation loss and energy loss in compressors and power converters are disregarded. The overall energy conversion efficiency of the electrolyser plant is then determined by the power converter efficiency and practical energy losses. For large facilities the thermal insulation losses amount to only a few percent. Assuming 3–5% energy loss from un-ideally insulated hot surfaces and compressors and 92–96% power converter efficiency, the overall energy conversion efficiency should be 87–93%.
As mentioned above (section 2), syngas could also be formed by reacting CO2 and H2 (RWGS reaction), wherein H2 is produced by water/steam electrolysis. In this context, it is interesting to compare the efficiency of a high-temperature electrolyser with a low temperature water electrolyser. The operating voltage of a typical alkaline electrolyser is usually much higher than the overall thermoneutral voltage. The extra electrical energy above the product HHV is used to obtain reasonable current density and has to be dissipated in the form of Joule heat, resulting in wasted energy and reduced efficiency. For example, a commercial HySTAT electrolyser stack from Hydrogenics (tested in ref. [31]) has a rated voltage of 43 VDC and current of 120 A, which translates into a rated cell operating voltage of 1.95 V and current density of 0.4 A/cm2. The overall power consumption is 4.90 kWh/Nm3 H2 of which 4.20 kWh/Nm3 H2 are required by the electrolysis. Since the HHV of 1 Nm3 H2 amounts to 3.55 kWh, the electrolyser and system efficiencies are calculated to be 84.5% and 72.4%, respectively. Therefore, overall speaking, the energy conversion efficiency of high temperature electrolysers could be about 10–15% higher than low-temperature electrolysers.
9.2. Heat management

Table 6 summaries the heat flows that occur inside the system for the baseline case. The water evaporation (up to 130 °C) alone consumes 202 kW heat, and the total heat needed to raise the feedstock temperature to 800 °C amounts to 403 kW of which 250 kW (62%) is recovered from the hot outlet gases, and 85 kW (21%) is recovered from the hot syngas after compression. Only 68 kW heat (17%) is additionally needed for feedstock preheating. In comparison to the total energy input to the system (1739 kW), the magnitude of heat to be managed is significant (403 kW equals to 23% of 1739 kW). Therefore, efficient heat exchangers and good thermal insulation are important to realise high energy conversion efficiency in the high-temperature electrolyser system.

Sensitivity analyses on the operating voltage for both isothermal and adiabatic operation modes have led to the same conclusion: the preferred operating voltage is simply the thermoneutral voltage. In practice, the operating voltage may need to be slightly increased in order to compensate for the thermal insulation loss from the electrolyser.
9.4. Possible benefit from free heat sources
Under thermoneutral operation conditions (i.e. baseline case), the extra heat needed amounts to 68 kW, which is only 4% of the total energy input to the system. Even when free heat energy is available, this could reduce the syngas cost by only 2%. This means that the high-temperature electrolyser can not really benefit a lot from cheap or even free heat energy if heat energy from hot outlet gases is well recovered. In the case of remarkable thermal insulation losses in the system, cheap or free heat energy would certainly be more beneficial. For instance, in the case of 10% thermal insulation loss, free heat energy would reduce the syngas cost by 7%.
9.5. CSC vs. ESC stack
The impacts of the performance, lifetime and cost of the electrolyser on the syngas production cost are interlinked among each other. In the present context, the performance is characterised solely by the ASR of the stack. Depending on the other two parameters, each of these three parameters can play a key role in determining the production cost (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7).
In comparison to an ESC stack (electrolyte-supported cells, ASR = 1.25 Ω cm2 at 800 °C), an CSC stack (cathode-supported electrolyser cells, ASR = 0.25 Ω cm2 at 800 °C) represents a clear advantage in reducing the investment cost. Using modern mature manufacturing technologies, no significant difference between the manufacture costs of these two type of stacks is expected. Assuming both stacks achieve a lifetime of 20000 h, replacing an ESC stack with an CSC stack would reduce the syngas production cost by 17%. With longer lifetime, this benefit is lessened, but still remarkable (40000 h, 10%) (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the requirement on the lifetime (the critical lifetime) for the CSC stack is less stringent than for the ESC stack (10000 h vs. 20000 h). Therefore, test and development of CSC stacks should be pursued.
Ignoring the maintenance cost related to the stack replacement when one stack reaches its lifetime, it would not lead to significant cost increment when the CSC electrolyser stack has a lifetime of only 10000 h, while a stationary SOFC stack has to survive > 40000 h operation. In comparison with a 40000 h CSC electrolyser stack, a 10000 h CSC stack would increase the syngas production cost by only 5.5%. Nevertheless, a long-term operation of a CSC stack under co-electrolysis conditions in a timeframe of 10000 h has not yet been reported. Therefore one of the key technical challenges is to demonstrate or achieve a lifetime of > 10000 h for an CSC electrolyser stack.
9.6. Economic competitiveness
A preferred large-scale application of the syngas produced by the high-temperature co-electrolysis process is to convert it through F-T process further to liquid fuels as an alternative transport fuel. This can avoid major infrastructure shift that would be otherwise required for a purely hydrogen-based transportation system. In this sense, liquid fuels derived from the co-electrolysis-FT process should compete with:
1) presently used petroleum-derived liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LNG etc.)
2) coal-derived FT liquid fuels (coal to liquid process or CTL process)
3) natural gas-derived FT liquid fuels (gas to liquid process or GTL process)
4) biomass-derived liquid fuels (biomass to liquid process or BTL process)
CTL and GTL processes have been since decades successfully commercialised by Sasol (several plants in South Africa) and Shell (first plant in Malaysia). In 2008, the first commercial BTL plant has been put into operation by the company Choren in Freiberg, Germany. It can produce 18 million litres fuel per year. Both CTL and GTL processes consume fossil fuels as feed stocks and thus contribute to CO2 emission. In addition, the production cost of GTL and CTL synfuels are very sensitive to the price of natural gas and coal. As shown in Fig. 14, the natural gas price in Europe is volatile and has increased by more than 100% during the last decade. The BTL process, however, is nearly a CO2-neutral process, which is composed of biomass gasification, gas cleaning, gas conditioning, F-T synthesis and product upgrading. It is thus interesting to compare the economic potential of the BTL process and the co-electrolysis-FT process considered in the present report.

Boerrigter28 assessed the impact of scale on the production cost of liquid fuel in a BTL plant. The production cost is estimated to be around 30 €/GJFT-liquid (or 1.10 €/l) for a 50 MWth plant. When the plant is scaled up to 9100 MWth, the production cost can be reduced to just above 15 €/GJFT-liquid (or 0.55 €/l). A BTL implementation report summarised by the German Energy Agency (dena)32 indicates a production cost of 0.68–0.90 €/l when the BTL plant is integrated into an existing refinery plant. When the plant is located just in a green field, the cost would be 20% higher (0.81–1.05 €/l). The assessment is based on a plant with an annual throughput of one million tonnes of biomass (calculated to be around 550 MWth). In another BTL study based on the Karlsruhe bioliq® process, Henrich et al.33 estimated a synfuel production cost of about 1.04 €/kg (or 0.8 €/l) at a biomass input of 3300 MWth. Summarizing the BTL liquid production costs estimated by different authors, it lies in the range of 0.55–1.1 €/l, and more likely in the range of 0.7–0.9 €/l for a plant with biomass input of > 500 MWth. As a reference, the market price of conventional petroleum-derived diesel is 0.57 €/l in 2008 in both France and Germany (without taxes, source: Eurostat). When all taxes are included, the end-user price increases to 1.21 €/l.

Fig. 15 shows the calculated production cost of FT diesel as a function of electricity price. Effects of CO2 price and credit from O2 sale are also illustrated. In the baseline case (CO2 price 160 €/t, electricity price 56 €/MWh, no O2 sale credit), it would cost 1.66 €/l. As discussed above, the real capture, compression and transport cost of CO2 from concentrated sources such as ammonia plants is only about 20 €/t. If this price is used, the production cost of FT diesel would be remarkably reduced to 1.22 €/l. Considering the up-scale effect, a large plant can benefit from a much lower electricity tariff than in the baseline case. At an electricity price of 44 €/MWh and CO2 price of 20 €/t, the diesel production cost is reduced to 1.02 €/l, which is already comparable with BTL technology. When the pure O2 by-product can be sold, the diesel production cost can be further reduced to 0.95 and 0.86 €/l at an O2 sale price of 20 and 50 €/t, respectively. At such a price it could compete with BTL process. Besides base-load operation with constant syngas production rate, it is assumed that the electrolyser stack could also operate in a power-following mode. In this case, off-peak nuclear electricity with the lowest tariff could be used, which could increase further the economic competitiveness of this process.
 Fig. 15  Production cost of FT diesel as a function of electricity price, CO2 cost and credit from O2 sale. The production cost of BTL Fuels estimated in the literature is indicated with a patterned zone (0.55–1.1 €/l). The market price (without taxes, source: Eurostat) of conventional petroleum-derived diesel is 0.57 €/l in 2008 in both France and Germany. 
Another interesting electricity source is wind energy. As the wind power penetration is increased e.g. in Germany, grid operators may have difficulty to digest so much strongly fluctuating electricity. A way to store the surplus wind energy during low-demand but high-output hours in a large scale is undoubtedly needed. The co-electrolysis-FT process could be used to store the wind energy in the convenient form of liquid fuel with high energy density, which can either be directly used for transport, or converted back to electricity when needed, although the latter option is energetically unfavourable due to remarkable loss of the roundtrip efficiency. Due to the low capacity factors of wind power plants, the electrolyser has to be over dimensioned to achieve the same syngas productivity as for an electrolyser operating in base-load mode, which increases the capital cost. In comparison with the nuclear power, the higher generation cost of wind electricity further increases the real production cost of syngas or synfuel. However, as far as “surplus” wind energy is concerned, it often means free or at a price much lower than its real generation cost. In this case, the production cost of synfuel could still be economically competitive.
10. Conclusions
1) Although it is not yet technologically mature, the high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process offers potentially a feasible and environmentally benign way to convert carbon-free or low-carbon electrical energy into chemical energy stored in syngas with desired H2 to CO ratio for further processing. An attractive application is to convert the as-produced syngas further into synthetic liquid fuels through the F-T process, which can be used as alternative fuels in the transportation sector while keeping the existing infrastructure and motor engine technology unchanged. Like the BTL process, but in contrast to the CTL and GTL processes, the combined co-electrolysis-FT process is a low CO2-emission approach for the production of alternative liquid fuels.
2) Process modelling and sensitivity analysis of the co-electrolyser system for syngas production lead to the following findings:
Owing to its relatively low operating voltage at reasonable current density, the energy conversion efficiency of a high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolyser system is estimated to be 87–93% (based on HHV), which is about 10–15% higher than a low-temperature water electrolyser system.
The high operating temperature of the electrolyser requires efficient thermal management of the system to recover the large amount of heat (∼23% of the total energy input to the system) in the hot outlet streams for the preheating of inlet streams.
The preferred operating voltage is the thermoneutral voltage (1.343 V at 800 °C). This preference is justified by the following two facts: i) the economic benefit of operating the stack isothermally at lower voltages (so that expensive electric energy can be replaced by cheap heat energy) depends on the availability of high-temperature heat and is insignificant due to the offset effect from the improved capital cost; ii) the small economic benefit of operating the stack adiabatically at higher voltages (1.389 V) is challenged by the risk of mechanical failure due to the large temperature gradient (150 °C) in the stack.
When the electrolyser operates at thermoneutral voltage, only a small amount of extra heat (4% of the total energy input) is needed. In other words, it is nearly thermally self-sustainable, indicating that it can not really benefit a lot from cheap or even free heat sources, though this is not the case when substantial thermal insulation loss exists in the system.
A CSC (cathode-supported electrolyser cell) electrolyser (with much lower ASR or higher performance) offers clear advantage over an ESC (electrolyte-supported cell) electrolyser: lower syngas production cost and less stringent lifetime requirement. The lifetime of a CSC electrolyser should exceed 10000 h.
As an energy-intensive process, the major contributor to the production cost of syngas is the electricity cost. Therefore, cost-effective electricity source plays a decisive role in determining the economic competitiveness of this process. The cost of CO2 is the second important factor. Concentrated CO2 sources (e.g. ammonia plants) should be exploited for the first application of this process. The credit from possible sales of the by-product O2 could also significantly reduce the production cost.
3) Nuclear electricity is considered as a preferred energy source due to its low generation cost and low carbon emission. Using CO2 from ammonia plants (∼20 €/tCO2) and nuclear electricity for large industries in France (assume 44 €/MWh), the production cost of FT diesel is estimated to be 1.02 €/l. Taking the credit from the O2 sale (assume 50 €/t) into account, the diesel production cost can be reduced to 0.86 €/l, which lies in the range of the estimated BTL cost (about 0.55–1.1 €/l) and hence has a good potential to be economically competitive.
If surplus, and thus free or very cheap, wind electricity is available (e.g. in Denmark, Germany), the present process offers also an attractive way to store the intermittent wind energy in the form of liquid fuel. Similarly this process could also find application in regions where solar energy (solar-thermal or photovoltaic) is abundant.

Broader context
The burning of petroleum-derived liquid fuels for transportation makes one of the major contributions to the global CO2 emission. Alternative liquid fuels derived from low-emission energy sources are desired to meet the demand in the transportation sector. As the use of renewable but fluctuating electricity (e.g. wind and solar) strongly increases, large scale energy conversion and storage are certainly required. The electricity-to-fuel conversion is therefore inevitable in a future energy system. The high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process converts water and CO2 directly to syngas, which in turn can be converted to synfuel through the well-established Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process. The combination of the high-temperature co-electrolysis process and the F-T process offers thus an attractive solution to convert efficiently low-emission electrical energy to chemical energy stored in transportation fuel. Successful market entry of this technology certainly depends on its economic competitiveness. In the present paper, an economic assessment of this process is performed through process modelling and sensitivity analysis. As an energy-intensive process, the availability of cost-effective electricity is crucial for its economic competitiveness. Preferred electricity sources are probably nuclear power and surplus wind power, with which synthetic fuels could be produced at a cost comparable to BTL (Biomass to Liquid) process.

 	Fig. 14  Evolution of the natural gas price in some European countries during the last ten years. This price (without taxes) is for medium sized industrial customers with annual consumption of 10 000–100 000 GJ. (Source: Eurostat).	 

 	Fig. 15  Production cost of FT diesel as a function of electricity price, CO2 cost and credit from O2 sale. The production cost of BTL Fuels estimated in the literature is indicated with a patterned zone (0.55–1.1 €/l). The market price (without taxes, source: Eurostat) of conventional petroleum-derived diesel is 0.57 €/l in 2008 in both France and Germany.
