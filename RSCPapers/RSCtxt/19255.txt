    , Accepted 6th March 2020First published on 9th March 2020AbstractFor the first-time we have synthesised perovskite CsPbBr3 quantum dot (QD) superlattices in borosilicate glass, which play a key role in controllable network structure connectivity. The structural and optical properties of the CsPbBr3 QD superlattices embedded in borosilicate glass were investigated.
All-inorganic caesium lead halide perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs possess outstanding characteristics as a new generation of optoelectronic material owing to their tuneable band gaps corresponding to the visible light region and high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, which allow their potential applications in lasers,1 sensors,2 solar cells,3 light emitting diodes (LED),4etc. However, uncovered CsPbX3 QDs always suffer from poor stability in a moist environment because of their inherently ionic nature that needs to be circumvented. Recently, profiting from the natural superiority glasses have shown as a support, they are becoming indispensable for QDs, especially for CsPbX3 QDs.5 This provides a reliable technical path to resolve CsPbX3 QDs’ stability issues for the exploration and application of new functions in optoelectronics.6–8
In recent work, Dong et al. utilized a femtosecond laser irradiation and thermal annealing method to reversibly fabricate and decompose CsPbBr3 QDs in a glass matrix, demonstrating their potential application in high-capacity optical data storage or information encryption.5 Wang et al. realized the stress-induced crystallization of CsPbBr3 QDs on a glass surface, which can be further used as a pressure-sensitive “glassy pencil” to learn people's writing habits or as a Pb2+ detector with good sensitivity and selectivity.9 Xiang et al. discovered the up-conversion properties of CsPbX3 QDs ranging from 420 nm to 711 nm under excitation with an 800 nm femtosecond laser in the glass matrix, that could more easily achieve amplified spontaneous emission for superior stable multi-colour lasing.10 Zhang et al., Liu et al. and Chen et al. both enhanced the thermal stability, photon stability and water resistance of CsPbX3 QDs by virtue of the inert nature of glass, and demonstrated their potential applications in light-emitting devices, and low-threshold random upconverted lasers under ambient air conditions.11–13 Wang et al. fabricated spatially isolated CsPbBr3 QDs with rare-earth-ions in glass via a self-crystallization route, and demonstrated their potential application as an accurate, reliable and robust thermometer.14
However, until now, the morphology and geometry of CsPbX3 QDs in glass have been unknown. In addition, the CsPbBr3 QD superlattice was first recently found in a colloid-state accompanied by superfluorescence (SF).15 It should be noted that the spontaneous organized superlattice is of great interest for the bottom-up fabrication of functional materials and as one of its special optical characteristics, the SF phenomenon can only be observed in a few systems.16–18 This is a remarkable piece of work that expanded the limited number of SF materials, and also inspired us to integrate a CsPbBr3 QD superlattice into glass. Herein, CsPbBr3 QD superlattices were precipitated in borosilicate glass by using conventional melt-quenching and a subsequent heat-treatment method (ESI†).
Because the two typical glass network units, –B–O– and –Si–O–, possess similar single-bond strength (497 kJ mol−1 and 443 kJ mol−1), but show notable differences in topological organization (triangle [BO3]/tetrahedra [BO4] for –B–O– and tetrahedra [SiO4] for –Si–O–),19 borosilicate glass can be used as a “microreactor” to modulate not only the chemical state of the dopants but also the size of the QDs.20,21 Taking full advantage of its properties, borosilicate glass was chosen as a host for producing a CsPbBr3 QD superlattice in situ. The Raman spectra and normalized spectra shown in Fig. 1a and b are an intuitional illustration of the topological configuration of a pristine borosilicate glass matrix network. The valley around 728 cm−1 is assigned to the [BO4] tetrahedra, 1170 cm−1 is assigned to the [SiO4] tetrahedra with four nonbridging O atoms per silicon, and 1320 cm−1 is assigned to the “loose” [BO3] triangle.22 To quantify the change in topological organization, we summarized the difference ratios of [BO3]/[BO4], [BO3]/[SiO4] and [BO4]/[SiO4], taking transmittance at 1032 cm−1 as the baseline in Table S1 (ESI†). With an increase in the mol. ratio of B2O3/SiO2 (denoted B/Si), the difference ratios of [BO3]/[BO4] and [BO3]/[SiO4] increased; meanwhile the [BO4]/[SiO4] ratio was almost unchanged. This indicates that the topological configuration of the glass matrix network changes from three-dimensional (3D) to quasi-two-dimensional (2D) with an increase in the ratio of B/Si, as sketched in Fig. 1c–e, where the glass matrix is like ‘cheese’ with more gaps for the diffusion of QDs in the glass with higher B/Si. Consideration of this topological feature of borosilicate glass may induce an enhancement in both the electrostatic binding energy to detach the ions and the strain energy to push the dopants through the interstitial “doorway”.23 Thus, borosilicate glass with a high ratio of B/Si is beneficial for the diffusion of CsPbBr3 QDs and the formation of a CsPbBr3 QD superlattice (Fig. 1f).

As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD patterns of QG1, QG2, and QG3 are generally aligned with a cubic perovskite CsPbBr3 standard PDF card (#00-054-0752). The diffraction peaks of QG1 are weaker than those of QG2 and QG3, because there are dispersed tiny CsPbBr3 QDs with a small number of lattice planes for diffraction in QG1 while there are large close-packed CsPbBr3 QD superlattices with more planes for diffraction in QG2 and QG3. Obviously, with an increase in B/Si, the diffraction peaks at 21.551° and 30.645° become stronger and shift to a smaller angle, indicating that the interplanar spacings of the corresponding (110) and (200) lattice planes are enlarged according to Bragg's Law, as shown in the schematic illustration of Fig. S2 (ESI†).24 And the TEM images confirm the indication that the lattice fringe interplanar spacing is 2.92 Å in CsPbBr3 QDs (Fig. 2b) similar to the CsPbBr3(200) crystalline plane interplanar spacing (2.92 Å), and 3.05 Å in the CsPbBr3 QD superlattice (Fig. 2c) which belongs to the gap width between those close-packed CsPbBr3 QDs (Fig. S2d, ESI†). Thus, related to the optical phenomena discussed later, we believe there are two types of CsPbBr3 co-existing in the borosilicate glass: CsPbBr3 QDs with an average size of ∼5.2 nm and CsPbBr3 QD superlattices (Fig. S3, ESI†). The network topological configuration of the glass matrix is an essential mediating factor for the self-assembly of a CsPbBr3 QD superlattice in the glass.

To further confirm the synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs and CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, we measured their absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 2d. The absorption edge red shifts from ∼508 nm to ∼531 nm with an increase in B/Si, which could be attributed to the quantum size effect in CsPbBr3 QDs,24 or the compressed [PbBr6] octahedra in CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, which have a great influence on the absorption profile of the perovskite.25 That is to say, the absorption edge in QG2 and QG3 may not come from CsPbBr3 QDs but from the compressed [PbBr6] octahedra in the CsPbBr3 QD superlattices. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the CsPbBr3 band gap (Eg) according to eqn (1) developed from the Tauc formula by Pankove:27,28 ahν = A(hν − Eg)0.5(1)where a is the optical absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h is Plank's constant, and ν represents the optical frequency. By plotting (ahν)2 against hν, Eg could be obtained via extrapolation of the absorption edge, as shown in Fig. 2e. The values of Eg for QG1, QG2, and QG3 are ∼2.40 eV (517.3 nm), ∼2.31 eV (537.7 nm), and ∼2.30 eV (538.9 nm), respectively. And then, assuming the inexistence of the CsPbBr3 QD superlattice and only the existence of CsPbBr3 QDs in the glass matrix, we estimated the dimension of CsPbBr3 QDs (d) using eqn (2) for the size-dependent energy gap:29,30 (2)where, d is the dimension of CsPbBr3 QDs, Ed is the band gap of CsPbBr3, E∞ is the band gap of a CsPbBr3 bulk semiconductor (E∞ = 2.0 eV), dB is the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr3 (dB = 7 nm), and Ry* is the exciton Rydberg energy of CsPbBr3 (Ry* = 34 meV).26,31 Substituting Eg into eqn (2), the dimensions of CsPbBr3 QDs in QG1, QG2, and QG3 are calculated to be about 5.8 nm, 6.5 nm and 6.6 nm, respectively. In fact, the average dimensions of CsPbBr3 QDs in QG1, QG2 and QG3 are all ∼5.2 nm, as measured from Fig. S3a–c (Table S2, ESI†), and these similar sizes cannot contribute to the red shift based on the quantum size effect. This indicates that there are compressed [PbBr6] octahedra in CsPbBr3 QD superlattices contributing to the red shift of the absorption edge. Thereby, we attribute the CsPbBr3 band gap Eg evaluated from the absorption edge on the blue-side to CsPbBr3 QDs (∼2.40 eV for QG1) and the red-shifted absorption edge to CsPbBr3 QD superlattices (∼2.31 eV for QG2 and ∼2.30 eV for QG3).
To further demonstrate the existence of CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, we measured the two-dimensional excitation–emission mapping of QG1, QG2, and QG3, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Generally, the apexes of the excitation and emission peaks of QG1, QG2, and QG3 are both located around 469 nm in the excitation wavelength and 520 nm in the emission wavelength, corresponding to the similar sized CsPbBr3 QDs existing in QG1, QG2, and QG3. With few differences, the symmetrical and characteristic mapping of QG1 is the same as that seen from CsPbBr3 QDs in other researchers’ reports,11,32 while the mappings of QG2 and QG3 are asymmetric, especially in the red oval area with an apparent increase in intensity. It should be noted that the asymmetry can be distinguished in the excitation wavelength range of 445–495 nm and the emission wavelength range of 525–550 nm. In connection with the feature of cooperative radiation discussed below, we attributed the asymmetry in the red oval area to the SF originating from CsPbBr3 QD superlattices.
To further discuss the mapping asymmetry, we measured the PLE spectra over a wider range (Fig. 3a), profiled the PL spectra excited at 469 nm from the two-dimensional excitation–emission mappings (Fig. 3b), and fitted their peaks (Fig. 3d–f). The PLE spectra of QG1, QG2 and QG3 show almost the same shape from 300 nm to 500 nm and a uniform excitation peak at ∼469 nm whether or not the CsPbBr3 QD superlattice is formed in the glass matrix, indicating that the CsPbBr3 QD PLE spectra from 300 nm to 500 nm are attributed to the CsPbBr3 QDs. And there is a distinct PLE peak at ∼525 nm for SF in QG2 and QG3 close to the emitted radiation wavelength of CsPbBr3 QDs (∼520 nm), which is assigned to the common radiation field for the coupled quantum system just as in the CsPbBr3 QD superlattice.15,33 For PL spectra, there is one fitted peak in QG1, and two fitted peaks in QG2 and QG3. We further measured the corresponding radiation lifetimes (Fig. S5, ESI†) under different power density excitations, and the calculated average lifetimes τave monitored at 520 nm under different power density excitations are ∼20 ns, close to previous reports for CsPbBr3 QDs in either solid-state (ref. 32) or colloid-state (ref. 26) while the τave monitored at 540 nm are ∼25 ns under low power density excitation and ∼15 ns under high power density excitation. It is known that the SF emission peak from coupled CsPbBr3 QDs in a superlattice is typically red-shifted by ∼90 meV from the uncoupled CsPbBr3 QDs,15 and the corresponding lifetime can be longer or shorter than that of uncoupled CsPbBr3 QDs under different excitation conditions; for instance, the power density of excitation.15,33,35 Moreover, taking their evaluated Eg with a reasonable Stokes shift into consideration,34 we assign the similar peaks of QG1, QG2, and QG3 at ∼2.38 eV (520 nm), ∼2.39 eV (519 nm), and ∼2.38 eV (521 nm) to the emission of CsPbBr3 QDs, and the other peaks of QG2 and QG3 at ∼2.29 eV (541 nm) and ∼2.28 eV (543 nm) to the SF emission of CsPbBr3 QD superlattices.

We also used a 473 nm continuous wave laser to stimulate QG1, QG2, and QG3 (Fig. 3c and g–i). There were still one peak (∼521 nm) in QG1 and two peaks (518 nm and 542 nm for QG2, 518 nm and 546 nm for QG3) while the ∼545 nm SF emission of CsPbBr3 QD superlattices was significantly enhanced compared with the ∼520 nm emission of CsPbBr3 QDs. We attribute the enhancement in SF emission to the strong dependence of SF on excitation power.15 In addition, we tested the PL performance of QG2 and QG3 via a 365 nm UV LED excitation light source (Fig. 4), and the corresponding CIE colour coordinates were (0.238, 0.735) for QG2 and (0.266, 0.710) for QG3. We believe it can be modulated to reach the green standard of (0.170, 0.797) in the Rec. 2020 colour gamut, and used as a potential candidate for solid-state lighting applications.

In conclusion, we modulated the topological configuration of a glass matrix network from three-dimensional (3D) to quasi-two-dimensional (2D) by increasing the ratio of B/Si, where the QDs can move more easily to form self-assembled superlattices. The CsPbBr3 QD superlattice accompanied by SF was first realized in a solid-state transparent glass medium. Our research proposes a straightforward means to obtain the solid-state implementation of a perovskite CsPbBr3 QD interaction system for exploration in relation to optoelectronic applications.
