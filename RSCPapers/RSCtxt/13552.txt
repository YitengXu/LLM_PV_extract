Assembled cells have been subjected to full electrochemical testing at temperatures ≤80 °C. At elevated temperatures, specific capacitance as high as 700 F g−1 has been observed. The increase in specific capacitance with temperature has been found to be at a cost to cycling performance. Furthermore, the time spent at elevated temperatures “at rest” has been shown to have a major effect on device lifetime. It has been found that at 80 °C, without cycling, such devices lose all significant capacitance after 21 days. The findings herein are believed to have major implications for transport, storage lifetime and ultimate utilization of such systems.IntroductionEnvironmental sustainability and the threat of global warming, combined with the need for diversity of energy supply in the current geopolitical environment, have resulted in a concerted push from both the political and scientific community to move away from the use of fossil fuels for energy generation and transport applications. Attention is currently being directed at renewable technologies for grid and large scale power applications and fuel cell and battery technologies as an alternative to the internal combustion engine. Of the renewable technologies under development, the most currently viable (wind and solar) do not offer security of supply, with down times dependent on the time of day and/or the weather. Fuel cell and battery technologies currently do not offer the high power densities required in automotive applications when used on their own, with high power usage having a major detrimental effect on device lifetime. Electrochemical supercapacitors are attracting much attention both on their own and in conjunction with batteries or fuel cells to improve longevity and performance (by virtue of their long cycle life and high power densities, and rapid charge–discharge characteristics).1–6 Commercially available supercapacitors typically consist of carbon or ruthenium(IV) oxide-based electrodes and an electrolyte, with amorphous ruthenium(IV) oxide electrodes currently showing high specific capacitances over 700 F g−1 but at high cost and high toxicity.7–10 A number of alternative metal oxides are currently under investigation, with MnO2 being most promising by virtue of its low toxicity, cost and natural abundance, and with device capacitances as high as 450 F g−1 being reported for non-thin film electrodes.11 A wide range of phases and morphologies are attainable for MnO2 through tailoring material synthesis routes and conditions.12–16 Currently, much work is underway to utilize the various morphologies and phases to maximize surface areas and tailor pore textures in an attempt to maximize specific capacitance through enhanced electrolyte accessibility. Whilst it is usually the case that a higher specific surface area results in a higher specific capacitance in such systems, it has been shown in some birnessite MnO2 materials that a high specific capacitance can be obtained with electrode materials of a relatively low specific surface area. This is believed to be a result of the thinness of the birnessite platelets allowing access of the electrolyte to almost all of the MnO2, almost all of the material being close to the surface.17 Recently, we demonstrated further enhancements in specific capacitance by utilizing the nanotube morphology, as has been previously demonstrated in carbon materials.18Application of potential supercapacitor devices in the automotive industry will depend, amongst other factors, on their ability to withstand the varied temperature profiles they may experience. Although it is rare for the temperature to exceed 45 °C in all but the hottest places on Earth, it must be remembered that a supercapacitor under the hood of a car would routinely experience temperatures up to 80 °C and higher. Much of the work reported in the literature does not specify testing temperatures of new systems and rarely investigates the effect of temperature on device performance.In this study, the previously reported birnessite nanotube aqueous supercapacitor system18 has been subjected to extensive testing at elevated temperatures in order to assess the effect on key performance indicators such as specific capacitance and cycle lifetime, information seen by the authors as essential prior to possible automotive application.ExperimentalMaterials synthesisSynthesis of birnessite nanotubes was carried out following the method reported previously,18 utilizing a different template molecule and lower temperature to ensure target morphology and phase purity. KMnO4 (0.0949 mol) was added to KOH(aq.) (0.5988 mol, 180 cm3) and stirred for 30 min. Dodecylamine (0.0170 mol) was added and the mixture stirred for a further 30 min before being transferred to a Hastelloy steel autoclave and heating to 120 °C for 3 days with constant stirring. After allowing the reaction to cool slowly to room temperature, the resultant solid was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionised water, until the pH of washings corresponded to that of the starting water. The solid was then washed several times in ethanol until all dodecylamine had been removed, (verified by CHN analysis) before drying at 80 °C overnight.Electrode fabricationElectrodes for electrochemical characterization were prepared by mixing the material above with polyvinilydene fluoride (PVDF) and graphite in the ratio 85:5:10 in acetone, with stirring for several hours to obtain a homogenous ink. The volume of the ink was reduced by heating at 85 °C before spraying (room temperature) onto pre-weighed stainless steel current collectors and then drying at room temperature to give an electrode material loading of 9 mg cm−2. Carbon electrodes were prepared by the same method, but with MnO2 substituted by Darco G60 carbon (Aldrich).Assembly of supercapacitor cellsOne MnO2 and one carbon electrode were assembled in a hybrid arrangement separated by a glass fiber filter paper pre-soaked in (NH4)2SO4 (aq., 2 mol dm−3) electrolyte in custom, sealed test cells and were assembled to a constant torque of 2 N m−1.Characterization techniquesPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were measured on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro PW3179 diffractometer using CuKα radiation and an X'Celerator detector. Nitrogen sorption was carried out at 77 K on a sample previously outgassed at 150 °C for 24 hours in a Micromeritics Flowprep 060 unit. The sample was then transferred to a Micromeritics V surface area and pore size analyzer for analysis. Samples for electron microscopy were ultrasonically suspended in ethanol for 15 min before being deposited on Holey carbon discs and were characterized using a Hitachi HD-2300A Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) at 200 kV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry were carried out using a Gamry Reference 600 instrument. For EIS, a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–1 MHz was used with oscillating amplitude of 10 mV. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out between 0 and 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl (aq. sat. KCl), corrected to temperature of experiment. Galvanostatic cycling of the assembled test cells was carried out between 0 and 1.35 V over 1000 cycles at various discharge currents using a Solatron 1480 instrument.Results and discussionMaterial characterizationIn depth characterization of similar MnO2 materials has been presented elsewhere.18 A summary of relevant material properties follows below. Powder XRD (Fig. 1(a)) showed the material to be potassium birnessite with all peaks observed indexed to JCPDS card no. 01-052-0556, with no indication of the presence of any manganese oxyhydroxides. A relatively high degree of crystallinity in the material was suggested, given the sharp and relatively high intensity nature of the peaks. Nitrogen sorption at 77 K (Fig. 1(b)) showed an isotherm consistent with the combination of types I and IV as classified by BDDT with a rapid uptake of nitrogen at low relative pressures, indicative of the presence of micropores, and no plateau at high relative pressures.19 Desorption showed a hysteresis that could be classified according to IUPAC as a combination of types H2 and/or H3, indicating mesopores and a complex network of interconnected slit shaped pores.20 High specific surface area and pore volumes of 128 m2 g−1 and 0.60 cm3 g−1 were obtained by BET and BJH analysis respectively. The pore size distribution as calculated by density functional theory (Fig. 1(c)) showed no contribution to pore volume at pore sizes below 4 nm, with 2 peaks observed at between 8 and 15 nm and between 30 and 50 nm. Through consideration of cumulative pore volume data, these 2 peaks were shown to contribute 54 and 26% of total pore volume respectively. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) confirmed the material to consist of agglomerated nanotubes emanating from a central point, with diameters between 15 and 40 nm, in good agreement with calculated pore size distribution as shown in Fig. 1(d). A proposed mechanism of formation has been discussed elsewhere.18 Fig. 1  Physiochemical characterisation (a) powder XRD profile of birnessite MnO2; (b) N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K; (c) pore size distribution as calculated by DFT; (SEM and TEM (inset) micrographs of birnessite MnO2 nanotubes). Electrochemical characterizationEffect of temperature on electrochemical properties. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were carried out on electrodes (formed as detailed earlier) using a Ag/AgCl(aq., sat KCl) reference electrode and carbon Darco G60 counter electrode with (NH4)2SO4 (aq., 2 mol dm−3) at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C, and at a range of scan rates. Fig. 2 shows the resultant CV profiles obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. At 30 °C a typical quasi-rectangular response was observed with a small peak in both scan directions resulting from the reversible insertion/de-insertion of NH4+ into the birnessite structure, with the accompanying conversion of Mn(IV) to Mn(III) and vice versa. As the temperature was increased, these peaks were seen to become clearer and were also seen to move to a lower potential. This was a result of improved kinetics in the system, allowing for easier and more rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ion into the birnessite structure through the pore networks present. Furthermore, as the temperature was increased, the size of the rectangular “envelope” was also seen to increase suggesting an increase in specific capacitance through the EDLC mechanism. These same variations were observed as the scan rates were varied, becoming less pronounced at faster scan rates. Fig. 2  CV profiles of 3-electrode cells at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C. As the scan rate was increased at each temperature a deviation from ideality was observed, with the envelopes becoming less rectangular in form and also tilting away from the horizontal. This was a result of diffusional control of electrolyte ions to the insertion/de-insertion sites of the electrode. At low scan rates, the electrolyte was able to diffuse through the majority of the pore network to access the surfaces of the electrode, forming an electric double layer and also inserting into the birnessite structure as detailed above, resulting in the quasi-rectangular ideal response. As the scan rate was increased, the interaction between the electrolyte species and the electrode decreased, with the NH4+ merely approaching the surface of the electrode at high scan rates with little redox interaction. This results in a deviation from the ideal rectangular profile and a tilting away from the horizontal. This effect was less prominent at higher temperatures due to the increased mobility of electrolyte species and enhanced diffusion through the pore networks of the solid.The effect of scan rate on the specific capacitance at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C is shown in Fig. 3. At all four temperatures the specific capacitance is seen to decrease rapidly as the scan rate is increased from 1 to 25 mV s−1, with a relatively small decrease following as the scan rate was increased to 100 mV s−1. This is a result of the decreased interaction between the electrode and electrolyte discussed above. At all scan rates, the specific capacitance observed increased with increasing temperature. The relative increase was most significant at lower scan rates, with an increase of over 100% being observed between 30 and 80 °C at 1 mV s−1, with the specific capacitance increasing from 340 F g−1 at 30 °C to 700 F g−1 at 80 °C. Fig. 3  Effect of CV scan rate on specific capacitance at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C. Galvanostatic cycling studies were also performed on the electrode materials in 2-electrode configuration, cycling between 0 and 1.35 V at various discharge current densities. The expected “saw-tooth” charge–discharge profile was observed in every case, with the charge and discharge portions being linear symmetrical as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4  Charge–discharge profiles at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C at a current density of 10 A g−1. The effect of discharge current density is shown in Fig. 5. The same phenomena were observed as in CV studies: an increase of nearly 100% was observed in specific capacitance between 30 and 80 °C at low discharge current densities, becoming less significant at higher current densities; there was little difference observed in specific capacitances between 30 and 70 °C at higher current densities, with a more significant increase observed between 70 and 80 °C. This cannot be explained through simply comparing results from CV and galvanostatic cycling at this time and is the subject of further investigation. Fig. 5  Effect of discharge current density on specific capacitance at 30(), 50(), 70() and 80 °C(). The effect of temperature on assembled supercapacitor test cells was investigated further using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with complex impedance plots as shown in Fig. 6. The intercept with the real axis at high frequency corresponds to the series resistance RS, a result of the combination of electrolyte ionic resistance, the intrinsic resistance of the active materials and binder in the electrodes, contact resistances of the electrodes to current collectors and connections of the test cells to instrumentation.21,22 Moving to lower frequencies, a depressed semi-circle was observed in all cases, assigned to charge transfer processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface;23–25 the diameter of this semi-circle gives an indication of the interfacial charge transfer resistance. This was followed at lower frequencies by a curve tending from 45 to 90° at the characteristic “knee” frequency, indicative of a semi-infinite Warburg component with capacitive behavior as a result of electrolyte diffusion within the electrode pores.26 This Warburg impedance when combined with the charge transfer resistance is often referred to as the faradaic resistance. The impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit using the CNLS fitting method.1,24,26 The equivalent circuit was based on the commonly used Randles circuit, with a constant phase element (CPE) replacing the capacitor (given the presence of a depressed semi-circle), to allow for the pore size distributions of the electrodes (each pore size having different time constants with varying ionic diffusion rates).1,25,27–31 An open Warburg element was also used as it is believed that even at the lowest frequencies measured, the electrode material is too thick for full penetration of electrolyte through the entire pore network.25 Fig. 6  Effect of temperature on complex impedance plots of assembled supercapacitor cells. Fitting of the impedance spectra to the model above showed there to be little change in RS as the temperature was increased. The increase in temperature did result in a decrease in charge transfer resistance (a decrease in the diameter of the semi-circle) and also in the Warburg resistance (diffusion limiting resistance). The variations in resistance at elevated temperature are shown in Fig. 7. This was accompanied by a decrease in diffusion length and or increase in diffusion coefficient, and an increase in the magnitude of the CPE corresponding to an increase in capacitance. The variations in these parameters all suggest that at elevated temperatures, the electro-active species are able to penetrate the electrode at a higher rate, in agreement with the CV and galvanostatic cycling results discussed earlier. Fig. 7  Variation of series (RS), charge transfer (RCT) and Warburg (RW) resistances with temperature. The leakage current at full charge (1.35 V) was also investigated on test cells at various temperatures and was seen to increase from 12 to 15 μA at 30 to 50 °C, with a further increases to 38 and 47 μA observed at 70 and 80 °C respectively. Although this represents an increase of nearly 400% between 30 and 80 °C it is not seen as problematic as the values of leakage current were still low for a hand assembled, non-industrially optimized system.Effect of temperature on cycling characteristics. The effect of temperature on charge–discharge cycling performance was investigated using CV at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 over 1000 cycles (Fig. 8(a)). In most cases an initial increase in specific capacitance was observed over the first few cycles. This has been observed by others in similar MnO2-based systems and is attributed to a morphological restructuring and the start of an on-going dissolution/redeposition process of Mn from the electrode material.32 This process was seen to be most pronounced at higher temperatures and is most visible at 80 °C. At 30 °C, after 100 cycles the specific capacitance was seen to be stable up to 1000 cycles with excellent columbic efficiency and little loss in cycling. At 50 °C, a gradual drop in specific capacitance was observed after ca. 500 cycles, possibly stabilizing between 900 and 1000 cycles. At 70 and 80 °C a greater drop in specific capacitance was observed during the first 700 cycles, with values stabilizing with around 50 and 70% of original values respectively, and high coulombic efficiencies observed thereafter. Fig. 8  Variation of specific capacitance with cycle number at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C as determined by (a) CV at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, (b) galvanostatic cycling at a discharge current density of 2.5 A g−1 and (c) galvanostatic cycling at a discharge current density of 10 A g−1. The cycling behaviour of cells tested through galvanostatic cycling showed differences dependent upon the discharge current.At 2.5 A g−1 (Fig. 8(b)) an initial increase in specific capacitance was observed at all temperatures, as in CV studies. After this period, stable capacitance was observed at 30 and 50 °C up to 1000 cycles. At 70 °C this initial rise in specific capacitance was followed by a gradual fall, resulting in a lower specific capacitance after 1000 cycles than was observed at 30 or 50 °C. At 80 °C the initial increase in specific capacitance was seen to be more significant and was followed by a rapid loss, which became more gradual after 500 cycles and resulted in a specific capacitance comparable with that at 30 °C after 1000 cycles. At a discharge current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 8(c)), a small increase initial in specific capacitance was observed between 30 and 70 °C, with a large increase observed at 80 °C. Upon cycling at 30 to 70 °C, small variations in specific capacitance were observed over 1000 cycles with good cycling behaviour and high coulombic efficiencies being observed. At 80 °C, again the initial increase in specific capacitance was observed over the first 150 cycles. After this point, the specific capacitance was seen to gradually decrease before appearing to stabilize after 900 cycles; the specific capacitance observed at 80 °C in this case was approximately 150% of that at 70 °C, with specific capacitance after 1000 cycles increasing with increasing temperature.It is apparent that the loss in specific capacitance observed was significant at elevated temperatures when studied using galvanostatic cycling rather than CV. This may be a result of the timescales of the two testing techniques. In CV, the time of experiment is specified through the scan rate and potential window, with all of the temperatures investigated being cycled and at temperature for the same amount of time. In galvanostatic cycling studies, the current density and potential window were specified, with the total time of experiment (and hence time at temperature) being a result of the test cell capacitance. This results in the time at temperature (for a given discharge current density, potential window and number of cycles) increasing with specific capacitance (80 > 70 > 50 > 30 °C). Given the differences observed in cycling behavior at 2.5 A g−1, 10 A g−1 (shorter test time) and CV cycling, it is apparent that the lifetime of systems such as these at elevated temperatures may be more dependent on the time spent at elevated temperature than on the number of cycles performed and this is discussed later.EIS was performed at various temperatures after 1, 10, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 cycles (at a current density of 2.5 A g−1) to gain further insight into the cause of the loss of specific capacitance observed during cycling.The resulting spectra were again fitted to a modified Randles circuit as discussed earlier. At 30 °C, (Fig. 9(a)), little variation was observed in RS over 1000 cycles. A gradual increase in both the charge transfer resistance (seen graphically by the increasing diameter of the semi-circle) and the Warburg resistances was observed over the first 500 cycles, increasing significantly between 500 and 1000 cycles. At 80 °C, (Fig. 9(b)), little change was observed in RS throughout 1000 cycles but with a gradual increase in charge transfer and Warburg resistances over the first 100 cycles. Large increases in those values were observed between 100 and 250 cycles and between 250 and 500 cycles, with little variation observed thereafter. At 50 and 70 °C, the results were intermediate to the two cases discussed. The lack of variation in RS throughout the cycling regime confirms that no electronically insulating phases were produced during cycling. As mentioned earlier, it has been shown that MnO2 electrodes are prone to dissolution/redeposition when cycled in aqueous electrolytes such as (NH4)2SO4 in supercapacitor systems. It is believed that the increases in charge transfer and Warburg resistances observed between 500 and 1000 cycles at 30 °C was a consequence of the redeposition of MnO2 on the electrodes resulting in the blocking of some of the available pores, increasing mass transport restrictions and thereby increasing the faradaic resistance and decreasing specific capacitance. It would be expected that this dissolution would occur more rapidly at higher temperatures due to an increased solubility in the electrolyte solution, resulting in the effect being more pronounced at higher temperatures. Fig. 9  Effect of prior galvanostatic cycling on complex impedance plots of supercapacitor cells at (a) 30 °C and (b) 80 °C. Effect of time spent at temperature on electrochemical properties. Given the above results obtained thus far, the effect of time spent at elevated temperature on specific capacitance of test cells was investigated. Assembled test cells were stored at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C for 28 days and were galvanostatically cycled periodically at 10 A g−1 discharge current density to obtain the specific capacitance at each time. As can be seen in Fig. 10, at 30 °C an initial increase of around 50% in specific capacitance occurred over the first 2 days, indicating that the morphological restructuring observed in systems such as these will occur even if cycling is not performed. This was followed by a gradual decrease in specific capacitance, becoming less significant as time progressed and resulting in a specific capacitance similar to the initial value after 28 days. At 50 and 70 °C, the initial increase in specific capacitance was observed to take place over the first 12 hours. This was followed by a rapid drop in specific capacitance, resulting in around 40% remaining after 1 day; a more gradual loss followed up to around 10 days with a relatively stable specific capacitance observed up to 28 days. At 80 °C, an initial increase in specific capacitance was observed over the first 2 hours which was followed by a sustained loss resulting in 60% specific capacitance remaining after 2 days, 20% after 7 days and no significant specific capacitance after 21 days. Fig. 10  Effect of storage at 30, 50, 70 and 80 °C for 28 days on the capacitance (relative to initial measured specific capacitance) of supercapacitor cells. The changes observed through galvanostatic studies were further investigated through EIS studies, with the spectra observed for the 30 and 80 °C test cells shown in Fig. 11. As can be seen in Fig. 11(a), at 30 °C, little variation was observed throughout the 28 days, with no change in general form, with small increases in charge transfer and Warburg resistances between 0 and 28 days. Storage of test cells at 80 °C (Fig. 11(b)) showed a number of changes. Little change was observed over the first 2 hours of storage, with an increase in both charge transfer and Warburg resistances over the first day. Fig. 11  Effect of storage time at (a) 30 and (b) 80 °C, on the complex impedance plots of supercapacitor cells. After 7 days storage at 80 °C, further increases in both the charge transfer and Warburg resistances were observed. After 14 and 21 days, the charge transfer and Warburg resistances were seen to increase dramatically, followed by little change between 21 and 28 days. The EIS spectra suggest that with time spent at elevated temperatures, deposition and or growth of Mn species upon the surface of the electrodes occurs resulting in a blocking layer forming, with a reduction of available pore volume and hence accessibility for electrolyte in the electrode (as evident from significant increases in the charge transfer and Warburg resistances).ConclusionsThe performance of a hybrid nanostructured birnessite/(NH4)2SO4(aq.)/carbon supercapacitor has been investigated at elevated temperatures ≤80 °C. Through both CV and galvanostatic investigation, the specific capacitance has been seen to increase with increasing temperature, with values as high as 700 F g−1 observed at 80 °C. The increase in specific capacitance has come at a cost to cycle lifetime, with device life decreasing with increasing temperature.Through variations in cycling lifetime observed via CV and varied discharge rates of galvanostatic cycling, a dependence upon time spent at elevated temperatures was indicated and further investigated. Through analysis of test cells over a 28 days period spent at elevated temperature, it has been confirmed that storage temperature of a system such as this is critical in determining the device lifetime. Although little variation in performance and lifetime was observed at 30 °C, at 80 °C a loss of 40% specific capacitance was observed after 2 days with 80% loss after 7 days. After 21 days of storage at 80 °C, no significant capacitance was observed. EIS studies suggest this to be a result of deposition and or growth of Mn species on the electrode surface resulting in large increases in charge transfer and Warburg resistances and subsequent loss of available pore structure to the electrolyte.The results presented for this system suggest that it is not only the number of cycles performed that dictate the lifetime of such a supercapacitor cell but that the time spent at elevated temperatures may be a more significant limiting factor when considering device lifetime. Although it is accepted that the observations presented herein may be specific to the system studied, further similar investigations on other systems may indicate similar issues at elevated temperatures, suggesting particular attention should be paid to the thermal profile that such a device is likely to experience, both in operation and in storage.AcknowledgementsThis work is funded under the UK's EPSRC Supergen Energy Storage Consortium (Grant no.
