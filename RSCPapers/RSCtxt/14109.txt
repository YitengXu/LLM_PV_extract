    , Accepted 17th May 2020First published on 18th May 2020AbstractCharge transfer and surface photocatalytic reactions are two crucial factors that determine the efficiency of photocatalysts in converting light energy to hydrogen energy. Herein, a fast and green strategy composed of a one-pot microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis followed by a heat treatment process is developed for synthesizing In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposites, using a mixture of tetra-butyl titanate, H2O, In-S-ionic liquid precursor solution (In-S-ILs) and [Bmim]Cl as the reactants. The ionic liquid cations act not only as a microwave absorbent during the solvothermal process, but also as a morphology-controlling agent via a dissolution-recrystallization process, leading to the formation of nanocomposites consisting of small and uniform sized In2S3 and mesoporous TiO2. The optimum In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposite with an In2S3 content of 1.01 mol% exhibits a H2 evolution rate of 637.9 μmol g−1 h−1, which is over 10 times that of commercial P25, and is 5.7 and 2.6 times that of neat mesoporous TiO2 and the milled In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 with the same component, respectively. The improved H2 evolution activity is predominantly attributed to the small size of In2S3, special mesoporous structure of TiO2, and their intimate heterojunction interface, which guaranteed effective charger transfer between In2S3 and mesoporous TiO2 as well as abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. This work provides a novel and simple strategy for obtaining special structures of semiconductor-based nanocomposites for efficient energy conversion.
1. Introduction
The photocatalytic solar-to-hydrogen conversion process has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to the global energy and environmental crisis, due to its renewable solar energy source and green chemical fuel products.1–5 Thus, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 evolution, which can effectively harvest light, enhance the transfer of photogenerated charges, and boost the rate of photogenerated electrons to H+.2,5–7 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most studied photocatalysts owing to its low cost, nontoxicity, and high photo-stability.8,9 However, the insufficiency of optical absorption and the easy recombination of photogenerated carriers result in its low photocatalytic activity.10,11
A promising way to extend light absorption and boost photogenerated charge transfer is to sensitize TiO2 with narrow band-gap semiconductors that have a suitable band alignment with TiO2.12,13 For this purpose, small sized metal sulfides have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention.14–16 However, small sized metal sulfides are always unstable and easily agglomerated during their preparation processes owing to the high surface energy. A common approach to solve this situation is to graft organic ligands on the surfaces of metal sulfides,17,18 but the existence of organic protective layers limits the carrier transfer between photosensitizers and catalysts.18–20 Therefore, there is a large incentive to develop an effective synthesis method for small sized metal sulfides.
Recently, indium sulfide (In2S3), with lower toxicity and a more negative conduction band compared with TiO2, has been exploited as an efficient semiconductor material to sensitize TiO2 for hydrogen generation.14,21 For example, Chai et al. have demonstrated In2S3/(Pt-TiO2) nanocomposites prepared by ball milling of hydrothermal In2S3 and Pt-deposited Degussa P25.22 Wang et al. have obtained In2S3/Pt-TiO2 heterogeneous catalysts via a refluxing wet-chemical approach.12 They found that, after coupling TiO2 with In2S3, the nanocomposites showed obviously enhanced light absorption and charge separation rate, resulting in increased hydrogen generation. However, these reported methods tend to form In2S3 particles with a larger size which goes against the effective charger transfer between In2S3 and TiO2.16,23,24
Besides, as a unique structure, porous photocatalysts that can exhibit substantially improved photocatalytic activity have been extensively investigated.25–29 For instance, Ren et al. reported TiO2 nanocrystals with internal pores through microwave-assisted hydrolysis using F− as the morphology-controlling agent, and found that the as-prepared TiO2 nanocrystals exhibited considerably higher photocatalytic degradation activity than solid nanocrystals.30 Sreethawong et al. applied a sol–gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant for the synthesis of mesoporous-assembled TiO2 nanocrystals that led to an increased photocatalytic H2 generation activity as compared with commercial P25.31 Noticeably, In2S3 particles are easily agglomerated, and additional morphology-directing agents are normally required for the formation of porous TiO2 during the preparation processes. Thus, it is of high significance to develop a simple and effective route to prepare small sized In2S3 loaded porous TiO2.
Ionic liquids (ILs) with good thermal stability, low vapor pressures, adjustable solubility for chemical compounds, and considerable synthetic possibility32,33 have been utilized as structural directing templates for the fabrication of mesoporous TiO2.34–36 Moreover, ILs are also good media for absorbing microwaves due to large organic positive ions with high polarizability, which leads to a high heating rate and nucleation rate for forming small sized nanoparticles.37,38 In this situation, herein we firstly prepared an In-S-IL precursor containing small-sized InxSy nanoparticles by a simple element-direct-reaction in a microwave-assisted ionothermal process. By further mixing the precursor with tetrabutyl titanate, H2O, and the ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) under microwave conditions followed by a heat treatment process, a series of In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposites with different molar ratios were successfully synthesized. By contrast, we also obtained neat In2S3 and mesoporous TiO2 under similar experimental conditions, and then milled these two compounds according to the previously reported synthesis route to obtain In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites.22 The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of the optimum one-pot-deposited In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposite is 2.6 times that of the milled sample with the same composition, and is 10.2, 5.7 and 277.3 times that of commercial P25, neat mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3, respectively. The photocatalytic mechanism for the one-pot-synthesized In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposite has been proposed. That is, the small size of In2S3 and intimate heterojunction interface in the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites actuated the charge separation between In2S3 and TiO2, and the mesoporous structure of TiO2 shortened the bulk diffusion length of charge carriers and increased the number of reactive sites, resulting in a superior photocatalytic material.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and characterization
Indium powder (99.99%) was purchased from Xin Long Tellurium & Technique Development Co., Ltd (Sichuan, China); 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride ([Bmmim]Cl; RG) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl; RG) were purchased from Lanzhou Yulu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd (Lanzhou, China); sulfur powder (CP), tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), acetonitrile (AR), methanol (AR) and ethanol (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All the chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water was obtained by reverse osmosis by filtration and ion exchange (YA. ZD-5 controlled type, Shanghai Shen An Medical Instrument Factory).
Morphologies and element mapping were characterized on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Indium contents in the samples were determined by using a HORIBA JY Ultima 2 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured in the angular range of 2θ = 10–80° on a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Specific surface areas were determined through N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms collected at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M adsorption analyzer. Solid-state optical diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer in the range of 200–800 nm with a BaSO4 plate as a standard (100% reflectance). The absorption data were calculated from reflectance spectra by using the Kubelka–Munk function α/S = (1 − R)2/2R, where α is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient, and R is the reflectance. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were recorded by using an Edinburgh FLS980 luminescence spectrometer at room temperature.
2.2. Synthesis
The synthesis of In-S-IL precursor was carried out via a microwave-assisted ionothermal process on a microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator EXP) with a maximum power of 100 W. Specifically, a mixture of In (1.140 g; 10 mmol), S (0.702 g; 22 mmol) and [Bmmim]Cl (10 g; 53 mmol) was loaded into a 25 mL Biotage microwave quartz vessel. Then, the vessel was sealed and heated in a water bath (100 °C) with magnetic stirring until a mash-like mixture was formed. The mixture was then heated under microwave using a controlled program (specifically, the mixture was heated at 150 °C for 5 min followed by 190 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature) with magnetic stirring. Finally, a dark-red gel was obtained. After that, the as-synthesized dark-red gel was diluted with 10 mL of acetonitrile to form an In-S-IL precursor solution, containing small-sized InxSy nanoparticles stabilized by ILs. Obviously, the In-S-IL precursor could be well dispersed in acetonitrile and this solution showed distinct Tyndall Effects (Fig. 1a). The TEM results further reveal the dispersed clusters with a uniform size of about 2–3 nm (Fig. 1b and c).

In2S3-loaded mesoporous TiO2 was also prepared through a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. Specifically, 4.12 mL of H2O, 5.840 g of [Bmim]Cl (33 mmol), 4.424 mL of TBT (13 mmol) and various volumes of In-S-IL precursor solution were introduced into a Biotage microwave quartz vessel with magnetic stirring for 30 min. Then, the mixtures were heated at 120 °C for 5 min followed by 150 °C for 60 min and then cooled to room temperature under microwave with magnetic stirring. The resulting white suspensions were collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove ions and possible remnants. Subsequently, the above obtained powders were dried stepwise under vacuum at 80 °C overnight and subjected to further heating at 350 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a H2 (10%)/N2 mixed atmosphere. Finally, sample Sx was obtained, in which x indicates the added volume of In-S-IL precursor solution of 0.05, 0.5, 2, and 16 mL. ICP results reveal that the In2S3 content in the samples S0.05, S0.5, S2 and S16 is about 0.14 mol%, 1.01 mol%, 4.15 mol% and 25.27 mol%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†).
Preparations of the neat mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3 were conducted by the same process as above but without addition of In-S-IL precursor solution and TBT, respectively, named S0 and S100. By contrast, sample Smil with similar compositions to sample S0.5 was prepared by milling a mixture of mesoporous TiO2 (S0; 1 g), In2S3 (S100; 0.0418 g), and absolute ethanol for 1 h.
2.3. Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The hydrogen generation activity was evaluated using a photocatalytic water splitting testing system (CEL-SPH2N, AULTT, China) containing 100 mL of 10 vol% methanol aqueous solution. 50 mg of photocatalyst was used in the process. After complete evacuation of the reaction system, a 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source. The temperature of reactant solution was maintained at 6 °C by a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic process. The amount of H2 generation was determined with a gas chromatograph using Ar as the carrier gas.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical properties were measured in a three-electrode cell by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. 5 mg of photocatalyst and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) were dispersed in 0.25 mL of an ethanol/water mixed solvent (4:1 v/v) for at least 60 min in an ultrasonic bath to prepare a homogeneous catalyst colloid. Then, 40 μL of the catalyst colloid was deposited onto an area of ∼1 cm2 of ITO conductive glass and then dried in air to form the working electrode. A Pt wire, a Ag/AgCl electrode and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution were used as the counter-electrode, the reference electrode, and the electrolyte, respectively. All the photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a square electrolytic cell containing 125 mL of electrolyte. A 300 W Xe arc lamp was utilized as the light source. The photocurrent with ON/OFF cycles was measured without a bias potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy plots (EIS) were recorded in a frequency range from 0.01 to 100000 Hz with a bias potential of −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mott–Schottky plots were collected at the frequencies of 500, 100, and 1500 Hz with an applied potential of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase structure and morphology analysis of photocatalysts
Crystallographic structures and phase textures of the photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, with the patterns displayed in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of sample S0 is of pure anatase phase, and the diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 25.30°, 37.79°, 48.04°, 53.88°, 55.06°, 62.69°, 70.29°, and 75.03° can be assigned to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (220), and (215) diffraction planes of anatase TiO2 (according to JCPDS card no. 99-0008), respectively. The diffraction peaks of sample S100 located at 2θ = 14.23°, 23.33°, 27.43°, 28.67°, 33.24°, 43.62°, 47.71°, 66.62° and 69.77° can be indexed to (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (511), (440), (731) and (800) diffraction planes of β-In2S3 (according to JCPDS no. 65-0459), respectively. No other phase was detected, indicating high purity of the prepared In2S3. Besides, it can be seen that with an increase of In2S3 content within the In2S3/TiO2 composites, the intensities of diffraction peaks of β-In2S3 were gradually increased. It is noted that the diffraction peaks for trace In2S3 were also observed in samples S0.05 and S0.5 likely due to the fine particle size and good dispersion of the In2S3 nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface; a similar phenomenon was also observed in sample S16. By comparing the XRD patterns of samples S0.5 and Smil, we found that the positions and intensities of their diffraction peaks are almost the same (Fig. S1, ESI†).

TEM and HRTEM images of samples S0, S0.5 and Smil are shown in Fig. 3. For sample S0, the inter-planar lattice spacing of 0.35 nm can be assigned to the (101) facet of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 3a),39 and TiO2 nanoparticles with a uniform size of ca. 5 nm are observed (Fig. 3d). After coupling with In2S3 (S0.5), two sets of lattice planes can be clearly observed with spacings of 0.31 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (311) and (101) planes of the In2S3 and TiO2 phases, respectively (Fig. 3b).12 The size of TiO2 nanoparticles remains constant, while the In2S3 nanoparticles show a smaller size of ca. 2 nm (Fig. 3b and e). For the sample Smil obtained by the milling method, In2S3 and TiO2 phases can be observed, but the nanoparticles are severely agglomerated, and the size of In2S3 nanoparticles is obviously larger than that of sample S0.5 (Fig. 3c and f). Besides, we also carried out element mapping on sample S0.5, as shown in Fig. S2.† It is found that the In2S3 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of TiO2, which is consistent with the XRD patterns.

To determine the surface area and pore-size distribution of the obtained photocatalysts, N2 adsorption–desorption characterization was conducted. Fig. 4 presents the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore-size distributions of TiO2 and In2S3/TiO2 with different molar ratios. It can be observed that the commercial P25 and sample S16 show a type II nitrogen isotherm (Fig. 4a),40 and possess non-mesoporous characteristic (Fig. 4b), due to the absence of both a distinct hysteresis loop and an adsorption plateau at very high relative pressure, thus indicating that there is no capillary condensation of N2 into the pores. In contrast, the isotherms of the other samples S0 ∼ S2 exhibit a typical type IV pattern with the H2 hysteresis loops at a relative pressure between 0.4 and 0.7 (Fig. 4a), which is characteristic of a mesoporous-assembled material (pore diameter 2 to 50 nm) according to the IUPAC classification.32,41 The pore size distribution curves reveal that the samples possess uniform mesopores centered at ∼6 nm (Fig. 4b and Table 1). These results provide evidence that the obtained TiO2 and In2S3/TiO2 using the microwave-assisted ionic liquid method possess mesopores structures (Fig. 4b), which are considered to be extremely useful in photocatalysis.42–45 They may shorten the bulk diffusion length of charge carriers and provide flexible transport pathways for the diffusion of reactants during the photocatalytic process.

Table 1 summarizes the SBET, pore volume, and pore size for the title samples of TiO2, In2S3, and In2S3/TiO2 with different molar ratios. All the SBET values of the prepared photocatalysts were greater than that of P25. Moreover, the specific surface area increased with the increase of In2S3 content before it reached 1.01 mol%, and decreased with the further increase in the In2S3 content, as excessive addition of the ionic liquid can greatly decrease the specific surface area of nanocrystals.38 The specific surface area was ∼225.0 m2 g−1 for the optimized In2S3/TiO2 sample (S0.5), which is much higher than that of sample Smil obtained by the milling method (∼157.6 m2 g−1), and is about 4.7 times that of commercial P25.
The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the obtained photocatalysts were recorded to characterize their optical properties, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the neat mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles only responded to ultraviolet light due to their intrinsic wide band gap of 3.37 eV. After coupling with In2S3, the In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 particles displayed enhanced absorption in the extended light region. The neat In2S3 showed the strongest broad light absorption among all the samples and its band gap was estimated to be ∼1.97 eV. Apparently, absorption of the In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposites was gradually red-shifted with an increase in the In2S3 content. The shift is attributed to the wide wavelength light response of In2S3. The results illustrate that the presence of In2S3 can efficiently extend the absorption of TiO2 nanoparticles into the broad light region.

3.2. Photocatalytic hydrogen production performance
The photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity of the obtained photocatalysts was evaluated under Xe light irradiation in 10% methanol aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 6, the commercial P25 displayed a low photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity of 62.4 μmol g−1 h−1, since P25 only showed a lower specific surface area of 48.04 m2 g−1. In contrast, the mesoporous TiO2 with a larger specific surface area of 182.0 m2 g−1 (S0) exhibited a significantly higher photocatalytic activity of 111.3 μmol g−1 h−1. The one-pot deposition of tiny In2S3 on mesoporous TiO2 provided some activity, resulting in a hydrogen yield of 333.6 μmol g−1 h−1 for 0.14 mol% In2S3 loaded TiO2 (S0.05). With further improvement of In2S3 content to 1.01 mol% (S0.5), the hydrogen yield reached the highest value of 637.9 μmol g−1 h−1, which is over 10 times that of commercial P25, and is 5.7 and 277.3 times that of neat mesoporous TiO2 (S0) and In2S3 (S100). There was an optimal In2S3 content of 1.01 mol% beyond which the photoreactivity decreased with the increase of In2S3 content. This was likely attributed to the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers in In2S3 particles owing to the high loading amount, and the partial blockage of the TiO2 surface active sites due to the excessive amount of In2S3 on the TiO2 surface.23,46 Besides, we also compared the H2 evolution activity of optimal proportion of In2S3/TiO2 prepared by one-pot-synthesis and milling methods, respectively. The H2 evolution rate of the one-pot-synthesized sample (S0.5) is about 2.6 times that of the milled one, which is partly benefited from the highly dispersed In2S3 nanoparticles (Fig. 3) resulting in the large specific surface area (Table 1), thereby abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. The stability test of the nanocomposites indicates that the one-pot-synthesized sample S0.5 can be used as a stable photocatalyst for hydrogen generation in the presence of sacrificial agents (Fig. S3 and S4†).

3.3. Charge transfer studies
To understand the origin of the enhanced hydrogen generation activity over the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites, it is crucial to establish the band alignment between TiO2 and In2S3. The electronic band structures of mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3 were further investigated by examining their Mott–Schottky plots. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, mesoporous TiO2 (S0) and In2S3 (S100) exhibited positive slopes in the Mott–Schottky plots, which is an indication of n-type semiconductors.2,47,48 And the results reveal that flat band potentials of mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3 are −0.43 V and −0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. In general, the conduction band (CB) edge of an n-type semiconductor is about 0.10 V more negative than the flat band potential.49 Thus, the CB potential of mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3 is −0.33 V and −0.72 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode), respectively. Combined with the band gap energy, the valence band (VB) position of mesoporous TiO2 and In2S3 can be calculated to be 3.04 V and 1.25 V vs. NHE, respectively (Table S2†). On the basis of the above results, a possible mechanism for the efficient charge transfer in the In2S3/TiO2 is proposed in Fig. 7c. In the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites, the component of In2S3 possesses excellent light absorbing ability and plays a light-harvesting role. Thus, under light irradiation, In2S3 is excited to generate electrons in the CB and holes in the VB. Driven by the potential drop at the heterojunction interface between In2S3 and TiO2, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of In2S3 could be firstly delivered to the CB of TiO2,7,12,14 thereby to the TiO2 surface for the H+ reduction reaction, while the holes located in the VB of In2S3 are captured by CH3OH.

Fig. 7c details efficient charge separation within the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites. Generally, photocatalytic performance shows dependence on the accumulation of electrons and holes for reactions, which is correlated with the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the migration rates to active sites.50 Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency characterization was carried out to monitor the instantaneous electron transfer under light irradiation.51 The transient photocurrent responses of the samples during the light ON–OFF cycles (Fig. 8a) were recorded. Notably, all the samples exhibited a photocurrent increase with the light on, corresponding to energy transfer from the substrate-catalyst to a lower energy trap state;50 and they also showed an immediate photocurrent drop with the light off, representing the combination of electron–hole pairs. Besides, considerable increases in the current intensity of the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites were observed compared to that of the neat TiO2 and In2S3, indicating the enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the existence of a heterojunction interface between In2S3 and TiO2. In contrast to the milled In2S3/TiO2, the higher current intensity of the one-pot-synthesized In2S3/TiO2 can be ascribed to the more effective charger transfer between In2S3 and mesoporous TiO2, which also partially explains the large gaps for these two samples in the hydrogen evolution activity. The tentative conclusion can be further supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution ranging from 100000 to 0.01 Hz, and the charge transfer resistances of samples are deduced from their Nyquist plots (Fig. 8b).52,53 Obviously, the one-pot-synthesized In2S3/TiO2 exhibits a much lower charge-transfer resistance than the neat TiO2, In2S3 and milled In2S3/TiO2. This indicates that a more efficient charge transfer channel has been establish between the small sized In2S3 and mesoporous TiO2 over the one-pot-synthesized In2S3/TiO2, thus greatly promoting the charge transfer and the separation efficiency.

Photoluminescence (PL) quenching and fluorescence lifetime experiments were also performed to give further insight into the electron transfer behavior. As shown in Fig. 8c, compared with the neat TiO2 with a strong fluorescence emission peak, the In2S3/TiO2 nanocomposites exhibited significant quenching of the PL intensities, especially the one-pot-synthesized one. It is suggested that the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs was effectively suppressed while the separation of electron–hole pairs was significantly improved with the introduction of In2S3 component.54 Analyses of the curves with a reconvolution fit supporting a triexponential decay model in each case reveal a shortening of the amplitude-weighted average lifetimes from the 4.944 ns of neat TiO2, 3.727 ns of the milled In2S3/TiO2 to 3.109 ns of the one-pot-synthesized In2S3/TiO2 (Fig. 8d and Table 2), indicative of the rapid charge transfer from the small sized In2S3 to mesoporous TiO2. This result can be explained as follows: (i) Small sized In2S3 nanoparticles result in a significant enhancement of the contact between In2S3 and TiO2, therefore leading to high charge separation and transfer rate;16 (ii) small sized In2S3 decreases the coverage of active sites on the surface of TiO2, which is conducive to the surface catalytic reaction;23 (iii) when smaller sized In2S3 is attached to TiO2, the energy difference in the conduction band of In2S3 and TiO2 is larger, which is favorable for electron injection from In2S3 to TiO2.24

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple, fast and relatively green method for synthesizing In2S3 loaded TiO2 with a mesoporous structure as a highly active photocatalyst. The In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposites with different molar ratios were prepared via a one-pot microwave-assisted synthesis using an ionic liquid and a subsequent heat treatment process. It is demonstrated that the ionic liquid cations act not only as a microwave absorbent during the solvothermal process, but also as a morphology-controlling agent via a dissolution-recrystallization process. The method endows the In2S3/TiO2 material with a small and uniform size, mesoporous structure, and intimate heterojunction interface, which accelerated the charge carrier transfer and increased the hydrogen evolution rate. The hydrogen evolution rate for the optimized In2S3/mesoporous TiO2 nanocomposites was greatly improved, being nearly 10.2 times that of commercial P25, and 2.6 times that of the milled sample with the same composition prepared by a method according to the previous report. This work may provide a new insight into the fabrication of special structures of semiconductor-based nanocomposites for improving solar energy conversion.
