    , Accepted 26th September 2011First published on 1st November 2011AbstractSingle-crystalline uniform Ta2O5 nanowires are prepared by a novel synthetic route. The formation of the nanowires involves an oriented attachment process caused by the reduction of surface energy. The nanowires are successfully applied to photocatalytic H2 evolution, contaminant degradation, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The Ta2O5-based DSCs reveal a significant photovoltaic response, which has not been reported. As a photocatalyst, the Ta2O5 nanowires possess high H2 evolution efficiency under Xe lamp irradiation, nearly 27-fold higher than the commercial powders. A better performance of photocatalytic contaminant degradation is also observed. Such improvements are ascribed to better charge transport ability for the single-crystalline wire and a higher potential energy of the conduction band. This new synthetic approach using a water-soluble precursor provides a versatile way to prepare nanostructured metal oxides.
1. Introduction

        Tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) is one of the most attractive transition-metal oxides because of its unique physical and chemical properties. Due to the high dielectric constant, high refractive index, outstanding photoelectric properties and high chemical stabilization, Ta2O5 has been widely used as a key material in dynamic random access memory, intermediate insulators, atomic switch, antireflective coating layer, gas sensor, photocatalysis, etc.1–4Ta2O5 is a good photocatalyst for both hydrogen (H2) generation from water and contaminant degradation because of its suitable conduction and valence band positions.5Ta2O5 has a rather wide band gap of about 4 eV, thus it is necessary to further narrow its band gap by doping and absorb visible-light photons to efficiently harvest solar energy.
In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the sensitized anode prefers to possess a wide band gap, such as TiO2.6,7 The excellent performance of Nb2O5 in solar energy applications 8–12 suggests that Ta2O5 should be a promising candidate to replace TiO2. Surprisingly, the reported Ta2O5-based DSCs were unable to generate photocurrent.8 It may be due to either poor electronic conductivity or inefficient charge transfer between Ta2O5 and the dye in the DSC. The nanostructured Ta2O5 with a special morphology might activate the DSCs to achieve photovoltaic response. In order to clarify the underlying truth, novel nanostructured Ta2O5 is needed to be prepared.
For effective utilization of solar energy, Ta2O5 ought to possess a high surface area to ensure abundant active sites, and preeminent charge-separation and electron-transport abilities. While these two respects of high surface area and efficient electron-transport are often contradictory, because high surface area leads to the increased electron-scattering from grain boundaries. Nanotechnology can provide a possible solution to this problem. Low dimensional structures (nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, etc.) favor carrier transport and also possess large surface areas. Recently, much attention has been paid to silicon (Si), titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires or nanotubes in solar energy utilization for their prominent electronic transport properties.13–21 Up to now, no studies about Ta2O5 nanowires have been reported. It is highly desired to develop a simple and low-cost method to prepare Ta2O5 nanowires.
In this study, we have developed a novel synthetic method to prepare Ta2O5 nanowires. A water-soluble tantalum precursor was synthesized and employed to fabricate highly crystallized one-dimensional Ta2O5 nanowiresvia a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The obtained nanowire is single-crystalline about 20 nm in diameter and 0.5–2 μm in length, and the formation mechanism was investigated. The Ta2O5 nanowires were successfully applied to photocatalytic H2 evolution and methyl orange (MO) degradation. The Ta2O5 nanowires facilitate charge transport and possess a higher potential energy conduction band, contributing to improved photocatalytic performance compared with commercially purchased Ta2O5. Importantly, the Ta2O5-based DSCs revealed a significant photovoltaic response. In addition, the nitrogen doping of Ta2O5 nanowires was easily achieved by annealing the products under an NH3 flow.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation
The synthetic process for the Ta2O5 nanowires is shown in the electronic supplementary information (ESI) in detail.† Briefly, 1.0 g of Ta2O5 powder (analytically pure, Sinopharm) was first dissolved in 10 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution (HF 40%), and reprecipitated by adding ammonia (analytically pure, 30%). Then the freshly formed precipitate was redissolved in a 30 mL solution containing hydrogen peroxide (analytically pure, 25–28%) and ammonia (5:1 by volume) to get a precursor. For safety reasons, the precursor was heated at 60 °C for 1 h to promote the decomposition of H2O2, and transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave reacting at 240 °C for 24 h. Finally, the resultant product was washed thoroughly with deionized water and subsequently ethanol, and freeze-dried overnight prior to being characterized. Nitrogen doped Ta2O5 samples were prepared by annealingTa2O5 nanowires under NH3 flow at 700, 750 and 800 °C for 3 h, respectively.
2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure and phase identification of the samples were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with a monochromatized source of Cu-Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) at 1.6 kW (40 kV, 40 mA). A JEOL JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the morphologies of the samples. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected using a JEOL JEM 2100F microscope working at 200 kV. The nitrogen sorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 at 77 K, and the specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The optical absorption characteristics of the powders were determined viaUV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) on a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U4100) equipped with an integrating sphere accessory.
2.3 Photocatalytic tests
The photocatalytic hydrogen generation tests were conducted in a gas-closed circulation system. 100 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in a solution containing 160 mL of deionized water and 40 mL of methanol as a sacrificial reducing agent in a Pyrex cell. The light source was a 500 W Xe lamp covered with a water-cooled quartz jacket. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by gas chromatography.
The photocatalytic contaminant degradation was investigated by monitoring the degradation kinetics of a model pollutant methyl orange (MO) under UV light. A 500 W high pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source. 250 mg of photocatalyst was added into a MO solution (250 mL, 10 mg L−1). Before illumination, the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then the stirred suspension was exposed to UV irradiation. The concentration of the MO was monitored by tracking the absorbance at 464 nm over time using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
2.4 
          DSC assemblage and performance measurement
The Ta2O5 paste was coated on the cleaned FTO (2.2 mm, 15 Ω □−1) by screen-printing (0.25 cm2), dried at 100 °C for 15 min and then heated at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed into dye solution (0.3 mM, N719 dissolved in ethanol,22 Dyesol) for 20–24 h. The dye-covered Ta2O5 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell. The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile. Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) were measured on a Keithley Model 2440 source meter under a solar light simulator illumination at AM 1.5 with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure
The morphology and structure of the as-prepared Ta2O5 nanowires were characterized by SEM images and an XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 1. From the SEM images (Fig. 1a–c), it was observed that the uniform nanowires were about 20 nm in diameter and 0.5–2 μm in length. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1d) shows two strong peaks and some very weak peaks, which can be assigned to the orthorhombic Ta2O5 structure (JCPDS Card No.79-1375) with space groupPmm2 and lattice constants of a = 43.997 Å, b = 3.894 Å and c = 6.209 Å.23 The enhanced (010) peak indicates the preferential growth of the sample. In addition, the XRD pattern and SEM image of commercially purchased Ta2O5 are shown in Fig. S1.† The orthorhombic structure (JCPDS Card No.79-1375) and irregular morphology were observed.

The detailed structure of the Ta2O5 nanowires was revealed by TEM images (Fig. 2). The inset in Fig. 2a shows the overall electron diffraction pattern of nanowires, from which two diffraction rings assigned to (010) and (020) crystal faces can be clearly observed. This is consistent with the XRD result in Fig. 1d. The high resolution TEM image near the ends of the nanowire (Fig. 2c) clearly indicates the single-crystal nature with high crystallinity and the lattice fringes perpendicular to the growth direction of [010]. The measured fringe width of 3.92 Å was found to be close to the interplanar spacing of the (010) plane of the orthorhombic Ta2O5 phase. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single Ta2O5 nanowire confirms that the nanowire is single-crystalline and grows preferentially along the (010) plane.

3.2 Formation mechanism of Ta2O5 nanowires
In order to understand the formation process of the Ta2O5 nanowires, we carried out time-dependent experiments. Fig. 3a–d show TEM images depicting the structural evolution with reaction time. The Ta2O5 is still amorphous particles after reacting at 240 °C for 1 h, as shown in Fig. 3a. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern further confirms its amorphous nature. With the reaction progressing, the amorphous particles turned into crystalline nanowires slowly. After reaction for 3 h, only a few short nanowires were observed (Fig. 3b); and lots of nanowires can be observed for the 6 h sample. Almost all the amorphous particles have been changed to nanowires after reacting for 12 h, and its SAED pattern confirms the high crystallinity. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4 further indicate the crystallinity development of Ta2O5 nanowires during crystal growth.

It is most probable that the growth of Ta2O5 nanowires follows an oriented attachment mechanism, which has been reported for a variety of metal oxide systems.24,25 For instance, in the preparation of titania under hydrothermal conditions, oriented attachment was investigated to occur on the (001) plane because of its high surface energy. There is certainly a strong thermodynamic driving force for oriented attachment, resulting from the reduced surface energy.26 The driving force for the assembly process is thus the reduction of surface energy by dissolving the amorphous particles and reprecipitating on the surface with high energy. In our system, the (010) plane of the orthorhombic Ta2O5 phase should possess a relatively high surface energy. As a result, the crystal growth occurred in the [010] direction to lower the overall system energy and finally the nanowires were formed. It can be proved by the following experiments: 0.1 mL of hydrogen fluoride (HF) was added to the Ta2O5 precursor in the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia solution, and followed by the same procedure as described in the experimental section. Interestingly, irregular particles instead of nanowires were obtained in this case (as shown in Fig. S2†), which is caused by the effect of F− ions. Because the fluoride prefers to adsorb on the high-energy surface and reduces its surface energy, the preferential growth of nanowires along the [010] direction should be prohibited. The influence of F− ions on the growth of titania has been well investigated,27,28 but there are still no previous reports about the influence of F− ions on the growth of Ta2O5.
3.3 Photocatalytic performance

Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water over Ta2O5 nanowires and commercially purchased Ta2O5. The produced hydrogen increased almost proportionally to the irradiation time. After irradiation under a Xe lamp for 5 h, the amount of generated H2 reached 1070 μmol g−1 over Ta2O5 nanowires without any co-catalyst, while only 40 μmol g−1 of H2 was generated over the commercially purchased Ta2O5. The photocatalytic H2 evolution of Ta2O5 nanowires is nearly 27-fold higher than that of commercial Ta2O5, which indicates that the Ta2O5 nanowires have higher photocatalytic reduction ability than commercial Ta2O5. The specific surface area is an important factor influencing the photocatalytic performance. It was measured and calculated to be 3.58 and 3.47 m2 g−1 for Ta2O5 nanowires and commercial Ta2O5 respectively. So the effect of specific surface area on performance is negligible in this case. Therefore, we can conclude that the superior performance of Ta2O5 nanowires compared with commercial Ta2O5 can be attributed to the enhanced charge transport efficiency and the higher potential energy of the conduction band. The nanowires with high crystallinity are in favor of charge transport because of the low defect scattering (see the inset of Fig. 5a).29,30 Thus, the photogenerated electrons can migrate more efficiently to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction of 2H2O + 2e− → H2 ↑ + 2OH−, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution. Another contributing factor is the higher potential energy of the conduction band for Ta2O5 nanowires, which is related to the driving force for H2 generation. Fig. 6 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Ta2O5 nanowires and commercial Ta2O5. As the orthorhombic Ta2O5 is a direct transition semiconductor,31 plots of α2(hν)versus the energy of exciting light are shown in the inset, which affords the corresponding band gap energies.32,33 The Ta2O5 nanowires have a wider band gap than commercial Ta2O5 (4.12 eV for Ta2O5 nanowires and 3.94 eV for commercial Ta2O5).

diffuse reflectance spectra of Ta2O5 nanowires and commercial Ta2O5. Inset shows the plots of α2(hν)versus the energy of the exciting light. 
The calculations of electronic band structures revealed that the valence band of Ta2O5 consists mainly of the O 2p orbital and the conduction band consists of the Ta 5d orbital.34,35 Since the ionic O2− 2p6 states of the valence band are highly localized, the band energy shifting mainly occurred in the conduction band. The higher energy of the conduction band minimum (CBM) for Ta2O5 nanowires gives rise to higher reduction ability, resulting in higher H2 evolution efficiency.
To demonstrate the photocatalytic oxidation ability of Ta2O5 nanowires, we conducted tests using the methyl orange (MO) assay under UV-light irradiation. The commercially purchased Ta2O5 was also used for reference. As shown in Fig. 5b, the as-prepared Ta2O5 nanowires possess higher photocatalytic activity for MO degradation than that of commercial Ta2O5. After UV irradiation for 60 min, MO was totally bleached over the Ta2O5 nanowires, whereas only 70% of MO was degraded over commercial Ta2O5. The enhanced charge transport efficiency of Ta2O5 nanowires also contributes to the superior performance of photocatalytic MO degradation. Compared with the great difference in the H2 evolution rates between Ta2O5 nanowires and commercial Ta2O5, the difference in the MO degradation rates is much smaller. This is caused by their similar valence band positions because of the highly localized O2− 2p6 states. The result verifies the previous discussion about the reasons for Ta2O5 nanowires possessing much higher H2 evolution efficiency.
3.4 Characterization of DSC
To further explore their potential for solar energy applications, the Ta2O5 nanowires were used as the anode material to fabricate DSCs. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve is shown in Fig. 7, and the performance characteristics are summarized in the inset. The overall efficiency, η, was evaluated using the equation η = (FFJscVoc)/Pin, where FF is the fill factor, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and Pin is the incident light power density. The photovoltaic response of the DSC using Ta2O5 nanowires as anode material was observed for the first time and the energy-conversion efficiency was calculated to be 0.11%. Although the efficiency is relatively low, it would open up the possibility to employ nanostructured Ta2O5 as a promising anode material.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage curve of a dye-sensitized solar cell based on the Ta2O5 nanowires. 
The poor efficiency is primarily due to the low photocurrent density. In the case of Ta2O5 nanowires, a very small amount of dye adsorbed on the Ta2O5 surface is supposed to be the main reason for its low photocurrent density, which can be obviously evidenced by the very light color of the dye-sensitized anode film after dyeing. The amount of adsorbed dye was further quantitatively determined and compared with that of the anode film made up of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25). The dye-sensitized anodes were soaked in a 0.1 M solution of alkaline in ethanol and water (1:1 by volume) for 2 h to desorb the dye, and the value of the desorbed dye was quantified by measuring their optical absorption spectra.36 There is a significant difference in the dye adsorption between these two kinds of anodes, the value of adsorbed dye for Ta2O5 nanowires anode is only 0.9% of that for TiO2 nanoparticles anode (0.08 × 10−8 mol cm−2vs. 8.5 × 10−8 mol cm−2, with a similar film thickness of about 8 μm). The influence of dye adsorption is the dominate factor for the low efficiency, and therefore it is possible to achieve a pretty high efficiency for Ta2O5 based DSCs by increasing the ability of dye adsorption.
3.5 
          Nitrogen doping of Ta2O5 nanowires
Since intrinsic Ta2O5 is a wide band-gap semiconductor (Eg ∼ 4 eV), the photocatalytic reaction should be activated by the irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light, which accounts for only a small fraction (7%) of the sun's energy. Thus, shifting the optical response of Ta2O5 from the UV to the visible spectral range will have a profound positive effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the material. Doping is a commonly used approach to enlarge the optical response range of wide band-gap semiconductors. Here, the nitrogen doping of Ta2O5 nanowires was easily achieved by annealing under an NH3 flow, and yellow powders were obtained. The change in color of the samples upon nitrogen doping demonstrates a profound effect on their optical response in the visible wavelength range. Fig. 8a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of pure Ta2O5 and nitrogen-doped Ta2O5 nanowires under different annealing temperatures. The results show that the band-gap absorption onset of the nanowires shifted from 300 nm to 450 nm (700 °C) and further to 580 nm (750 °C). The XRD patterns and SEM images of the N-doped Ta2O5 nanowires are also shown in Fig. 8b–d, both the structure of orthorhombic Ta2O5 and the morphology of the nanowires were maintained well after nitrogen doping.
 Fig. 8  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, (b) XRD patterns, and (c, d) SEM images of N-doped Ta2O5 nanowires. 
The photocatalytic activity of the N-doped Ta2O5 nanowires was evaluated by measuring the hydrogen generation from water under Xe lamp irradiation. Unfortunately, no enhanced performance was observed, as shown in Fig. S3.† The hydrogen generation rates were decreased after doping, which may be because the severe defects became recombination centers and hindered the charge separation. Another reason may be the lower potential energy of the conduction band caused by nitrogen doping.5
4. Conclusions
In summary, Ta2O5 nanowires were prepared by employing a novel and water-soluble tantalum precursor via a one-pot hydrothermal route, and were successfully applied to photocatalytic H2 evolution, contaminant degradation and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The as-prepared Ta2O5 nanowires possess an orthorhombic single-crystalline structure of about 20 nm in diameter and 0.5–2 μm in length. The formation mechanism of Ta2O5 nanowires was investigated, which involves an oriented attachment process caused by the reduction of surface energy. The value of produced H2 reached 1070 μmol g−1 over Ta2O5 nanowires under Xe lamp irradiation for 5 h without any co-catalyst, which is nearly 27-fold higher than that of commercially purchased Ta2O5. The improvement is ascribed to the enhanced charge transport and higher potential energy of the conduction band. In the MO degradation, the advantage of Ta2O5 nanowires was weakened, because its valence band was almost unchanged and only the enhanced charge transport efficiency contributed to the improved degradation performance. As the photoanode material of DSCs, a photovoltaic response was observed and the efficiency was calculated to be 0.11%. The very small dye adsorption is the main reason for its poor efficiency. In addition, the nitrogen-doped Ta2O5 nanowires were prepared by annealing the products under an NH3 flow, and their photocatalytic activities were evaluated.
