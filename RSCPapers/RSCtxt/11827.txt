Introduction
Clean water production is of great significance for human well-being and sustainable development. However, conventional water treatment technologies suffer from the disadvantages of massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.1–4 The utilization of solar energy, a kind of clean energy continuously replenished by nature, has no geographic restrictions. Therefore, using solar energy to promote water evaporation provides a feasible scheme for reducing energy consumption and saving costs in water treatment. Nevertheless, the energy transfer efficiency in the process of solar-driven evaporation under natural conditions is lower than 20%, due to the weak absorption capacity from sunlight and high heat loss.5 Consequently, building solar-driven evaporation systems with high solar energy utilization efficiency has sparked increasing attention from related researchers.
In recent years, considerable research has been carried out on nanofluids and interfacial evaporation. The nanofluids convert solar radiation into heat through volumetric absorption, specifically, the high-temperature photothermal nanoparticles disperse in the nanofluids and induce water evaporation by transferring heat to the surrounding water.6–8 However, the increase in temperature of the bulk water inevitably leads to a large amount of heat dissipation.9 Therefore, the interfacial evaporation system has been proposed to selectively heat the water in the vicinity of the air–water interface through localized heat conversion. Ultimately, the evaporation efficiency can reach or even exceed 100%.10 Currently, the application of solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) to obtain clean water is gaining popularity, especially in the field of seawater desalination. The ion concentration of the freshwater obtained through SIE can meet the World Health Organization standard for drinking water without further treatment.11–13 Besides, the SIE of wastewater such as dye wastewater, heavy metal wastewater, oily wastewater, and radioactive wastewater has also been studied.14–19
SIE performance is primarily determined by two indicators: evaporation rate and evaporation efficiency. The evaporation rate is the amount of water vapor generated by the unit area of the evaporation interface in unit time, which most intuitively reflects the ability of an evaporation system to produce water vapor. Evaporation efficiency (η), also known as solar thermal conversion efficiency, solar–vapor conversion efficiency, photothermal conversion efficiency, etc., is essentially the proportion of solar energy irradiated to the evaporation interface that is used to generate water vapor. The calculation formula of η is as follows: η = (ṁsunlight − ṁdark)(q + hvap)/Pin, where Pin is the intensity of solar radiation on the evaporation interface; ṁsunlight − ṁdark is the net mass flux of water vapor produced under irradiation, which is equal to the apparent evaporation rate (ṁsunlight) minus the evaporation rate without sunlight (ṁdark); q + hvap is the total enthalpy change of water from liquid state to gas state, including the sensible heat absorbed by liquid water (q) and the latent heat of evaporation (hvap). According to the conservation of energy, η must be less than or equal to 100%, implying that the evaporation rate has an upper limit. For the previous reported SIE systems with evaporation efficiency greater than 100%, there is necessarily an energy input other than solar energy that is not accounted for in the denominator of the above equation.
The structure of SIE systems is increasingly diversified. Fig. 1 shows three typical SIE systems. The SIE system shown in Fig. 1a is assembled from three main components: a hydrophobic foam for thermal insulation, a two-dimensional (2D) hydrophilic material (such as fabric) surrounding the foam for water transport, and a solar-absorbing layer for photothermal conversion. During SIE, the hydrophobic foam isolates the solar-absorbing layer from the bulk water to prevent downward heat dissipation, while the hydrophilic fabric pumps water to the sunlight-absorbing layer to achieve efficient interfacial evaporation. A one-piece interfacial evaporator with a Janus structure is exhibited in Fig. 1b. It is primarily made of a porous material with low thermal conductivity, such as aerogel. The lower part is hydrophilic, while the upper part is hydrophobic and used to absorb solar energy. Through a three-dimensional (3D) porous network, water is transported to the interface of the upper and lower parts, where it evaporates rapidly by absorbing heat and escapes through the pores. In Fig. 1c, the SIE system with a special 3D structure has a relatively high surface area for solar energy absorption and evaporation. A considerable reduction in heat conduction loss is achieved by the transportation of water to the evaporation surface using a one-dimensional (1D) channel. To sum up, the efficient and stable evaporation of an SIE system is inseparable from the synergy of three key factors: solar thermal conversion, thermal management, and water transport. Solar thermal conversion is realized by photothermal nanomaterials, which constitute the solar absorber in the interfacial evaporators. In order to maximize the capture and conversion of sunlight, photothermal nanomaterials with broadband light absorption as well as low emissivity and transmittance are required.20 In addition, the surface morphology of the interfacial evaporators also greatly affects the absorption capacity of sunlight. Thermal management is the key to realizing thermal localization, which mainly involves the thermal insulation between the evaporation interface and the bulk water. That is closely related to the pore structure of the evaporators. Water transport is the crux to ensure continuous evaporation, during which the supply of water from the bulk water to the evaporation interface is mainly realized through capillary action, so the wettability of materials has a great impact on it. Briefly, an ideal SIE system should satisfy excellent photothermal conversion, minimum heat loss and efficient water transport. Additionally, it is also necessary to accommodate the requirements for durability, salt resistance, anti-biological fouling, system simplification and function extension, which are crucial for the practical applications of SIE.

(c) The SIE system with a special 3D structure. 
From the above perspectives, researchers have made various efforts to improve the performance of SIE. In this review, the latest research advances of SIE were systematically discussed, including the structural regulation of interfacial evaporators and the associated photothermal nanomaterials, as well as the innovative structural design of the evaporation systems (Fig. 2). The key structural properties of the evaporators and evaporation systems required to enhance the SIE performance were explored from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Finally, we expounded the existing challenges and opportunities of SIE under the new situation, hoping to provide some guidance and inspiration for the development of SIE.

Photothermal materials
Obtaining the energy input as large as possible is a prerequisite for efficient interfacial evaporation. In order to efficiently convert solar energy into thermal energy, various photothermal materials with broadband absorption have been studied as absorbers in interfacial evaporators. Based on the solar–thermal conversion mechanism, photothermal materials can be classified as plasmonic metal nanoparticles, semiconductors, carbon-based materials, etc. The light absorption of different photothermal materials and the SIE performance based on these photothermal materials are summarized and compared in Table 1.

Plasmonic metal nanoparticles
Plasmonic metal nanoparticles can effectively convert light into heat owing to the effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). As shown in Fig. 3a, two adjacent metal nanoparticles are excited by light to generate plasmas.21 When the frequency of the incident light matches the oscillation frequency of the free electrons in the metal, these free electrons undergo collective excitation and resonance. Finally, the kinetic energy of these vibrating electrons is converted to heat by damping. Noble metal nanoparticles typified by gold (Au)24–28 and silver (Ag)29–33 have been widely used in SIE because of their excellent photothermal conversion properties and structural controllability. In addition, palladium (Pd) also exhibits excellent photothermal properties.34

The absorption bandwidths of classical plasmonic metal nanoparticles are typically narrow, limiting the solar energy utilization efficiency. By designing the size and shape of plasmonic nanoparticles, the plasmonic properties can be further adjusted to improve the absorption of photons as well as the heat conversion. Ho et al.35 showed that larger Ag nanoparticles exhibited stronger LSPR effect. Anisotropic structures with sharp edges or vertices facilitated a broad range of LSPR wavelength tuning from the visible (Vis) to the near-infrared (NIR) region.36 Huang et al.37 developed a trepang-like Au nanostructure (nano-trepang) by manipulating the structural anisotropy and morphology of the nanoparticles. Compared to the Au nanorods, the nano-trepang had broader absorption, exhibiting a broad and featureless absorption in the range of 300 to 1100 nm (Fig. 4a). In general, thin and sharp structures contribute to the strong penetration of the incident electric field, allowing the entire plasmonic particle to participate in the heating process. In addition, asymmetric and hollow structures also conduce to broadband absorption.20

In the application of SIE, the design of the spatial assembly of metal nanoparticles is one of the most effective means to enhance the optical performance. Zhou et al.38 fabricated a broadband plasmonic absorber through self-assembly of Au nanoparticles onto a nanoporous alumina template. The random distribution of the size and shape of Au nanoparticles induced a high density of hybridized LSPR, leading to broad solar spectral absorption. While the porous template offered an impedance match for effective reduction of reflection and coupling to the optical modes. Based on these key factors, the plasmonic absorber achieved ∼99% of light absorption from 400 nm to 10 μm. When two metal nanoparticles are approaching together, a coupling interaction will generate between their surface plasmas, resulting in a new plasmon resonance. For example, a multiscale nanostructured colloid composed of hollow porous Ag/Au nanocubes demonstrated an enhanced and broadened plasmonic absorption peak through strong interparticle plasmonic coupling effect.39 Chen et al.40 reported a seeded growth method to synthesize black Ag nanostructures in a confined tubular space, thereby inducing random plasmonic coupling between Ag nanoparticles and achieving broadband absorption in the visible and NIR region. In the application of SIE, the obtained black Ag nanostructures achieved an evaporation rate of 1.38 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun (1 sun = 1 kW m−2 sunlight illumination).
The high costs and scarce resources limited the applications of noble metals, whereas non-noble metal nanoparticles with broader plasmonic peaks may be more suitable for photothermal conversion.41 A 3D porous films deposited with aluminum (Al) nanoparticles had a broadened plasmonic response from the ultraviolet (UV) range to the infrared range due to plasmonic coupling between nanoparticles and the formation of oxide layers.42 A nickel-based (Ni–NiOx/Ni) foam exhibited ∼90% light absorption in the Vis-NIR region, achieving an evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 and ∼94% respectively under one sun.43 In addition, indium (In),44 cobalt (Co),45 nickel–cobalt bimetal (Ni1Co3),46 copper (Cu)47,48 have also been applied for SIE.
Semiconductors
For semiconductors, when the energy of incident light exceeds the band gap, the electrons in valence band are excited and transfer to the conduction band, forming electron–hole pairs in the valence band. The electron–hole pairs then gradually move to the edge of the band gap for recombination via non-radiative relaxation and release energy in the form of phonons, resulting in localized exotherm of the lattice (Fig. 3b).22 Conventional semiconductors with large energy gaps generally absorb high-energy incident light for electronic excitation, and the absorbed energy is mostly re-emitted as photons. For example, typical titanium dioxide (TiO2) only responds to UV irradiation at wavelengths less than 400 nm due to its inherently large band gap (∼3 eV). Through ongoing research, black semiconductor materials with narrow energy gaps, such as Ti2O3, MoS2,49–51 Cu2−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 1),52–55 CuO,56 black phosphorus,57 CuFeSe2 (ref. 58) have been developed. Visible light absorption can stimulate the electronic exotherm in them, greatly expanding the application of semiconductors in photothermal conversion. A nanoscale Ti2O3 with a rather narrow band gap of ∼0.1 eV has the ability to absorb solar energy in the full spectrum range.59 Combining this band gap feature with the enhanced light scattering between nanoparticles, the nanoscale Ti2O3 achieves nearly 100% internal and ∼92% external solar thermal conversion efficiency.
It has been shown that for semiconductors of the same composition, a narrower band gap resulted in higher solar thermal conversion efficiency and better SIE performance.60 Therefore, bandgap engineering is an effective means to enhance the solar absorption of semiconductor materials. For instance, color-tunable TiOx (x < 2) nanoparticles could be synthesized by magnesium (Mg) reduction of white P25 TiO2 nanocrystals.61 The increasing of Mg content lifted the Ti/O ratio in TiOx, resulting in a darker TiOx with higher light absorption (Fig. 4b). In addition, black NiO with a wide absorption range was developed by introducing atomic defects and intermediate energy levels.62 The Janus evaporator with black NiO nanoparticles (band gap of 1.03 eV) as the photothermal upper layer achieved an evaporation efficiency of 83.5% under one sun.63
In transition metal semiconductors, generating intrinsic defects or doping can lead to the formation of plasmonic properties in the NIR region. For example, cationic vacancies in the vacancy-doped semiconductor nanocrystalline lead to an increase in the density of free carriers. When these free carriers are excited collectively by electromagnetic radiation, they will produce a strong NIR extinction band, or LSPR.64 For non-stoichiometric copper chalcogenide nanocrystals, including Cu2−xS, Cu2−xSe and Cu2−xTe, the plasmon resonance is achieved by manipulating the copper vacancies in the structure. Specifically, the frequency of LSPR increases as the vacancy concentration increases.65 CuS nanoflowers synthesized by hydrothermal method have strong absorption peak in visible and NIR region due to LSPR of the free carriers.66 After integrating them with a semipermeable collodion membrane for SIE, an evaporation efficiency of 81.2% was achieved under four suns. Additionally, oxygen deficient metal oxide semiconductors, such as MoO3−x (ref. 67) and WO3−x (ref. 68 and 69) also exhibit LSPR effect.
Carbon-based materials
Compared to plasmonic metal nanoparticles and semiconductors, carbon-based materials are the most competitive light absorbers for SIE because of their abundant sources, low cost, excellent light absorption ability throughout the solar spectrum, and simple fabrication. The thermal vibration of molecules determines their photothermal conversion properties. Incident photons with energies above the optical bandgap can excite electronic transitions in carbon-based materials, which in turn transfer the absorbed light energy to lattice vibrations through electron-phonon coupling relaxation, resulting in heat generation (Fig. 3c).23,70 Currently, the commonly used photothermal carbon-based materials include amorphous carbon, graphite,71,72 graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), etc.
The carbon atoms in amorphous carbon with a low degree of graphitization mainly exist in sp2- and sp3-hybridized structure. Typical amorphous carbon materials such as carbon black,73 carbonized biomass,74–76 and porous carbon77 are widely used for photothermal conversion. Through the processing of coating, blending, etc., granular amorphous carbon can be supported on certain substrates to achieve excellent SIE properties.78,79 In addition, biomass with unique cell structures, such as mushrooms,80 lotus seedpods,81 carrots,82 corn stalks,83 wood,84 loofahs,85,86 potatoes,87etc., can be directly used as interfacial evaporators by entire carbonization or surface carbonization. For example, the carbonized loofah has a hierarchical pore structure that is ideal for water transport. It shows an evaporation rate of 3.7 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun, which further increases to 14.5 kg m−2 h−1 with an additional wind of 2 m s−1.88
In contrast to amorphous carbon, the carbon atoms in graphite, graphene and its derivatives, and CNTs are primarily sp2-hybridized, resulting in a large number of conjugated π bonds. The increase of conjugated π bonds in the system can narrow the energy gap between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), causing a red shift in the absorption spectrum, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of solar energy utilization.9 CNTs are widely used as an effective solar absorber in various energy and environmental applications, attributed to their blackbody-like optical behavior.89–92 Mu et al.93 obtained a carbon aerogel with a nanoporous network consisting of hollow-CNTs by carbonizing the conjugated microporous polymer (Fig. 4c). The carbon aerogel has a high specific surface area of 826 m2 g−1, a light absorption of nearly 100% in the range of 2000–2500 nm, and an evaporation efficiency of 86.8% under one sun. In the last decade, graphene and its derivatives have been widely used in the development of various advanced functional materials due to their excellent properties such as high light absorption, good mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, negative thermal expansion and large specific surface area.70 In fact, owing to the low chemical activity and the difficulty of scalable production of pristine graphene, the derivatives of graphene that have been tuned in terms of optical and surface properties through various strategies, such as changing the degree of oxidation and doping, are more widely used.94 Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been applied to SIE.18,95–99 A 3D interconnected porous maize straw/GO aerogel with an evaporation efficiency of 3.22 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun was synthesized by low-temperature hydrothermal reduction and atmospheric drying.100 The addition of urea for nitrogen doping, on the one hand, regulated the π–π stacking among GO sheets, while on the other hand, increased the reduction degree and hydrophilicity of GO. The thermal-treated nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (NGA) showed an evaporation rate of 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun.101 Specifically, the thermal treatment endowed the NGA with unusually superwetting property, i.e., the NGA annealed at 400 °C could be completely wetted with water within 40 ms (Fig. 4d).
Other materials
In addition to the above materials, organic polymers, MXenes, melanin, covalent organic frameworks, and metal organic frameworks are also materials of interest for photothermal conversion.102–106 Because of the thermal vibrations of the molecules, organic polymers with conjugated structure undergo strong light absorption in the Vis-NIR region.107 Polypyrrole (PPy) is the most commonly used photothermal organic polymer, and it is usually decorated on some substrate following in situ polymerization of pyrrole.108–110 For example, the microwave- and alkali-treated corn straw coated with PPy had an evaporation efficiency of 96.8% under one sun.111 In addition, polyaniline,112–114 polydopamine (PDA)17 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)115 have also been used in SIE applications. Recently, the emerging MXene nanosheets obtained by exfoliating the MAX phases have also shown outstanding photothermal conversion performance due to their semi-metallic properties.116–120 The melamine foam dip-coated with MXene achieved ∼95% of sunlight absorption and evaporated water at a rate of up to 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun.121 Cuttlefish ink is a natural melanin which shows efficient solar absorption and can be used as a high-quality biomass-derived photothermal material. A hydrogel evaporator with vertical microchannels composed of cuttlefish ink and gellan gum shows 97% absorption of sunlight and an evaporation rate of 3.1 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun.122
Furthermore, several kinds of hybridizing materials can improve photothermal performance owing to the synergistic effects. Plasmonic metal nanoparticles have absorption peaks at specific wavelengths. By coupling them with broad-spectrum absorbing materials, the absorption peaks can be further broadened. For example, the Ni@C@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles integrated the broadband absorption of carbon and the plasmonic excitation of Ni nanoparticles.123 The evaporation efficiency of this nanoparticle-based evaporator could rise up to 91.2%. In addition, Cu@PPy,124 Au–CuS,53 MoS2@Cu9S5,49 graphene-carbon cloth125 and other hybrid photothermal materials have also been reported.
Interfacial evaporators
Interfacial evaporators can be divided into 2D evaporators and 3D evaporators according to structural dimensions. 2D evaporators, such as metal meshes, membranes, cloths, air-laid paper and cellulose paper modified or assembled with functional photothermal materials were often used in early SIE applications.61,74,97,127–134 The modification or assembly methods include electrostatic spinning, layer-by-layer assembly, dip-coating, etc. For example, by electrostatic spinning, polymeric nanofibers encapsulating carbon black nanoparticles can be made into highly flexible and repeatedly washable nonwoven cloth with an absorption capacity of more than 94% of the full solar spectrum.135 By dip-coating, MXene nanosheets can be coated on the surface of a cellulose fibrous membrane to form a flexible photothermal membrane with 94.1% absorption of light in the wavelength range of 300–1500 nm.136 However, separate applications of 2D evaporators are not common. For the interfacial evaporation system constructed with a floating thin membrane, the energy absorbed by the membrane is directly transferred to the bulk water, resulting in a lower evaporation efficiency, which is contrary to the original research intention of the interfacial evaporation. 3D evaporators excel in reducing heat loss and light reflection while enhancing water transport, and thus have excellent evaporation performance. The commonly used 3D evaporators mainly include wood-based, aerogel/foam/sponge-based, and hydrogel-based evaporators, and their structural properties, SIE performance, and advantages are summarized in Table 2.

Wood-based evaporators
Wood has great potential for applications in efficient SIE due to its good hydrophilicity, low thermal conductivity, and large number of natural microchannels. Carbonization of wood blocks or modification with photothermal nanomaterials is a common method to obtain wood-based evaporators.92,109,137,138 For example, the poplar wood block coated with VO2 (M) nanoparticles achieved an evaporation rate of 3.63 kg m−2 h−1 under three suns.139 The wood block modified with tannic acid and Fe3+ (poplar–TA–Fe3+) had an evaporation efficiency of ∼90% under one sun and performed a unique resistance to crude oil-fouling.140 Jang et al.141 used CO2 laser to induce a graphitic carbon layer on the surface of basswood and further created a grid pattern to enhance light absorption. The obtained photothermal wood block exhibited a light absorption efficiency of ∼98% in the wavelength range of 300–2000 nm.
The vertical microchannels in the wood and the pits in the channel walls play important roles in water transport. Depending on the structure, wood is divided into softwood and hardwood. Softwood is mainly composed of highly elongated tracheids with small openings in the tracheid walls. Hardwood is more complex, with fibre tracheids providing structural support and vessels (enlarged cells with thin walls and large pore spaces) responsible for water transport.142 Jia et al.143 compared the microstructures of several typical hardwoods and softwoods and analyzed their effects on the SIE performance. As shown in Fig. 5a, softwoods exhibited almost uniform pore sizes, while hardwoods had two peaks in the pore size distribution. Hence, different woods have varying porosity and density. Poplar (hardwood) with higher porosity and lower thermal conductivity showed an evaporation efficiency of 86.7% under ten suns after further surface carbonization. In addition, the bimodal porous structure of the hardwood enhanced salt exchange capacity in desalination of high-salinity water. Surface-carbonized balsa (hardwood) had long-term stability in 15% saline water and showed an evaporation rate of 6.4 kg m−2 h−1 under six suns.144 As shown in Fig. 5b, although the rapid evaporation during solar desalination increased the brine salinity in the narrow tracheids, the brine could gradually diffuse into the large vessel channels through the pits, nanopores and ray parenchyma cells. The increased salt exchange effectively avoided the decline in desalination capacity caused by the salt blockage. The thickness of the wood is also a key factor affecting the interfacial evaporation performance. The increased thickness improves the thermal localization while reducing the mass transfer efficiency. Through experiments and calculations, Yu et al.145 determined that the optimal thickness of the carbonized wood-based solar steam generator was ∼22 mm, and it could achieve an evaporation rate of 6.89 kg m−2 h−1 under 5 suns. Although the wood has the ability to transport water, it still has certain limitations. Therefore, Tang et al.146 exposed the hydroxyl groups of cellulose in the wood by partial delignification to further enhance the hydrophilicity of the wood and got an evaporation rate of 3.91 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun by adjusting the height of the wood above water surface. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, the enhanced hydrophilicity enabled sufficient water to be transferred to the upper evaporating surface, while the increased height allowed the side surface of the evaporator to absorb energy from the surroundings.

Aerogel/foam/sponge-based evaporators
Aerogels, foams, sponges, and other ultralight materials with 3D network structures have the characteristics of well-developed pores, good thermal insulation, and low density, making them ideal for constructing evaporators with distinct advantages in sunlight capture, thermal localization, water transport and vapor escape. Moreover, the pore structure of aerogel/foam/sponge can be designed and tuned to exhibit adjustable interfacial evaporation characteristics compared to the above-mentioned wood-based evaporators with inherent pore properties.
Biomass-based aerogels are a new generation of aerogels with good biocompatibility, biodegradability and renewability. Currently, biomass-based aerogels such as cellulose aerogel, chitosan aerogel, and konjac glucomannan aerogel have been used in combination with photothermal materials for SIE.19,147–149 The porous network structure as a sound support for photothermal materials can effectively prevent the agglomeration of nano-functional materials to enhance the structural stability. Besides, the hydrophilicity of most biomass-based materials enables the aerogel network to absorb large amounts of water, thereby providing a humid environment for interfacial evaporation. Nanocellulose is an excellent construction material for aerogel due to its rich reactive groups, large aspect ratio, and excellent mechanical properties. The aerogel-based evaporator composed of nanocellulose has abundant pore structure, and its internal micro-scale channels and the rough walls of the channels provide a large internal surface area for water penetration and evaporation.115 Moreover, the unique 1D structure of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) makes the aerogel exhibit excellent mechanical stability and flexibility.150 Jiang et al.151 constructed a lightweight all-nanofiber aerogel with an evaporation efficiency of 76.3% under one sun, in which the main skeleton composed of CNFs with anisotropic vertically elongated macro channels embodied water transport, thermal insulation and compression resistance, while the upper CNT light-absorbing layer could be firmly bonded to the CNFs by hydrogen bonding. Liu et al.152 integrated a hydrophilic cellulose–polyvinyl alcohol aerogel (CPA), a hydrophobic silylated cellulose aerogel (SCA) and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) coating layer to form a monolithic cellulose aerogel-based evaporator (Fig. 6a) by heterogeneous mixing and in situ freeze-drying. Only the CPA in the center was used for water transport, which avoided the increase of thermal conductivity caused by the complete filling of the open pores with water and thus enhanced the thermal localization effect. Under one sun, the integrated aerogel exhibited an evaporation efficiency of 89.16%. In addition, delignification of wood to obtain cellulose aerogel/foam is a new method developed in recent years. After removal of lignin, the water transport capacity of the wood was dramatically increased, and the wood became more porous, thus exhibiting excellent compressibility and super-insulation. The cellulose aerogel prepared from wood treated with Na2SO3/H2O2 had a porous lamellar structure (Fig. 6b) and a thermal conductivity as low as 0.0617 W m−1 K−1 even when completely wetted.153 After coating with plasmonic Au nanoparticles-decorated rGO, this wood-derived cellulose aerogel evaporator could reach 90.1% solar-to-vapor conversion under one sun. Besides, PDA@Ti3C2Tx MXene, Fe/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles and Fe3O4/polyvinyl alcohol were also modified on delignified wood blocks (cellulose aerogels) to achieve excellent SIE properties.154–156

(d) The fabrication process and SEM images of the GO-based aerogel (reproduced from ref. 170 with permission from John Wiley and Sons). 
Chitosan is another biomass-based material for synthesis of aerogels.157–160 Chitosan aerogels exhibit good hydrophilicity and a certain degree of swelling in water, facilitating the wicking effect and the storage of water within their macropores.160 Compared with other biomass-based materials, chitosan also has antibacterial activity. It can interact with bacteria through van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces, making the chitosan aerogels uniquely advantageous in the treatment of seawater and wastewater. A chitosan/gelatin-based sponge incorporating melanin-coated titania hollow nanospheres exhibited an evaporation rate of 3.17 kg m−2 h−1 under 2.5 kW m−2 solar irradiation and had an antibacterial rate of 100% against Salmonella.161
As a low-cost, hydrophilic and 3D porous material with low thermal conductivity, melamine foam (MF) is often used as a support for photothermal materials. PPy-coated MF could yield evaporation efficiency of up to 87.7%.162 However, the filamentous macroporous network structure of MF limits the number of modifiable sites. To solve this problem, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film was introduced into the MF network to increase the surface coating area (Fig. 6c).163 After being loaded with porous carbon and polyaniline (PAN), the obtained composite foam evaporator (PCPF evaporator) achieved an evaporation rate of 1.496 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun without extra thermal insulator. In addition, melamine has a high nitrogen content. The nitrogen-doped carbon foams obtained by calcining MFs in a nitrogen atmosphere or directly in air have been proved to exhibit excellent photothermal conversion properties.164–166 Huo et al.167 obtained a nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon hybrid aerogel (NGCA) by annealing the GO-dip-coated MF. With GO reduction, nitrogen doping to graphene sheets and MF carbonization during the heat treatment, the NGCA achieved an average light absorption of 97.57% and evaporation efficiency of 90% under one sun.
Carbon aerogels are ideal for use as interfacial evaporators due to their inherent sunlight-absorbing characteristics. Typical carbon aerogels mainly include graphene-based aerogels as well as carbonized aerogels. The presence of π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions between graphene nanosheets allows them to assemble into 3D porous network structures. In general, the preparation methods of the graphene-based aerogels mainly include hydrothermal process and freeze casting. Under high-temperature and high-pressure environment of the hydrothermal process, oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO sheets entrap a large amount of water into the graphene network to form a self-assembled hydrogel. As the reaction proceeds, the hydrophobicity and π-conjugated structure of the reduced GO sheets increase, which enhances the π–π stacking strength as well as the amount of cross-links.168 As for freeze casting method, the well-dispersed GO suspension is used as the precursor, and the GO sheets are concentrated at the boundary of the ice crystals and aligned along the ice crystal growth direction by extrusion, thus leaving the porous framework of aerogel after the ice crystal sublimation (Fig. 6d).169,170 Generally, strategies such as addition of cross-linkers or graft copolymerization are often used to modulate the interactions between GO nanosheets in order to further optimize the structure and properties of the graphene-based aerogels.171 Sodium alginate is mostly used as a binder between graphene sheets, acting as a connecting bridge, and it can also make graphene-based aerogels hydrophilic.170,172,173 Besides, Wu et al.174 grafted bayberry tannin to graphene aerogel for bifunctionalization, finding that bayberry tannin could not only improve fluid infiltration during evaporation but also chelate with uranium ions for marine uranium extraction. Furthermore, the impact of reduction method on the properties of the resulting graphene has also been studied. Zhang et al.175 found that the high-quality graphene obtained by thermal annealing with maximum removal of oxygen-containing groups and defects might not have optimal properties. The defect-abundant graphene aerogel assembled by small-sized rGO sheets and reduced by laser irradiation had a lower thermal conductivity and a shorter free path of the long-wavelength acoustic phonons, contributing to efficient vapor generation.
Carbonized aerogels are generally obtained by carbonizing organic aerogels. As mentioned above, the carbonized MF is one of the typical representatives. Other organic aerogels carbonized for SIE include the resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogel,176 the polymeric monolith aerogel,177etc. Besides, biomass-based polymers as well as some biomass itself can also be carbonized to produce high-performance carbon aerogels or foams.178 For example, the electrically conductive and magnetic carbon aerogels obtained by carbonizing Fe3O4-modified cellulose derived from waste paper were capable of both photothermal and electrothermal conversion.179 The carbonaceous foam formed by carbonizing compacted Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) retained the fiber and branching structure of EP, providing long-range continuous channels for rapid water transport.180
In addition to the above mentioned types of aerogels, the aerogels based on hydroxyapatite, attapulgite and other materials have also been developed for SIE.181,182
Hydrogel-based evaporators
Hydrogels are a class of polymeric materials with 3D cross-linked networks that can be swollen but insoluble by water molecules. The hydrophilicity of the hydrogels is attributed to the abundance of hydrophilic groups in the polymer network, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino and sulfonic acid groups. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the network structure of the hydrogels can greatly accelerate the water evaporation. The hydrogen bond between the hydrogel network and water molecules activates some water clusters, making them more likely to escape from the confined space of the hydrogel network, thus resulting in a lower vaporization enthalpy.183,184 By adjusting the structural parameters of the hydrogel, such as polymer concentration, composition ratio and degree of cross-linking, the condition of water in the hydrogel can be regulated.185 Zhou et al.184 constructed a highly hydratable light-absorbing hydrogel (h-LAH) with PVA and chitosan as the hydratable skeleton and PPy as the light absorber. There were three kinds of water in the hydrated polymer network, namely bound water, intermediate water and free water, as shown in Fig. 7a. As the proportion of chitosan in h-LAHs rose, the hydrability of the polymer network increased, as did the corresponding intermediate water content, which was attributed to the fact that –NH2 could attract more water molecules compared to –OH. Thanks to the effective regulation of the water state, the h-LAH achieved an equivalent water vaporization enthalpy of 931 J g−1, and the vapor generation rate was increased to ∼3.6 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. In addition, the polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) network also exhibits strong hydration capacity. The PVA hydrogel penetrated by PSS networks activated more than 50% of the contained water to the intermediate state, so that the energy consumption for water evaporation could be as low as 860 J g−1.186

(c) Flow chart of preparation of the PVA/sodium alginate/sodium polyacrylate hydrogel evaporators with different light-absorbing layer structures (reproduced from ref. 191 with permission from John Wiley and Sons). 
The control of water transport is critical for interfacial evaporation. Inadequate water supply owing to the poor water transport restricts evaporation, but excessive water content owing to the high water transport rate makes more energy used to heat the water, leading to the reduction of energy efficiency. By adjusting the pore structure and hydrophilicity of the hydrogel network, the water transport process can be efficiently optimized.187 Fermentation is a simple method to impart porous structures to hydrogels. Different sized microchannels can be constructed inside the hydrogel to match the rate of water supply required for evaporation by taking advantage of the fact that varying fermentation duration produces different sized fermentation bubbles. The PVA/activated carbon-based fermentation porous hydrogel with a fermentation time of 30 min had a pore diameter of ∼21.34 μm after lyophilization, and exhibited optimal water transport and evaporation matching during SIE with an evaporation efficiency of 95.15% under one sun.188 Liang et al.189 synthesized a gradient-structured hydrogel using a pair of templates consisting of a Teflon plate and a glass plate. The two plates had a different attraction to the microgel crosslinker according to the hydrophobicity, as a result, the carbon powder/polyacrylamide composite hydrogel cross-linked by the microgel had a gradient-distributed pore structure with large holes at the bottom and small holes at the top (Fig. 7b). The improved bottom-up capillary action increased the rate of water transport through the microchannels and improved the transport unidirectionality, thus decreasing downward heat convection losses and resulting in an evaporation efficiency of 93.4% under one sun.
In addition to water transport modulation, some hydrogels can also exhibit strong self-healing and antibacterial properties. The introduction of borax can endow the hydrogel with a strong self-healing ability. Specifically, the reaction between the borate anions generated by borax hydrolysis and the hydroxyl groups of the polymer network produces interchain dynamic didiol–borax complexation.190 Li et al.191 created ternary (PVA/sodium alginate/sodium polyacrylate) composite hydrogels by spraying the borax solution on fluid-like gels made of PVA and sodium alginate, followed by in situ polymerization of sodium polyacrylate. Depending on the self-healing ability of hydrogels, interfacial evaporators with various light-absorbing layer structures were created, as shown in Fig. 7c. Both the randomly placed small hydrogel cubes and the hydrogel strips woven into the grid were able to self-heal into a whole, thus forming the evaporators with different surface morphologies and surface areas. The hydrogel evaporator with the grid-like morphology had a higher surface area and achieved an excellent evaporation rate of 2.21 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. Polyelectrolyte-based hydrogels exhibit anti-biofouling and antibacterial properties during interfacial evaporation. Polymers with cationic groups have been used as antimicrobial agents, where groups such as quaternary ammonium and protonated amino groups can interact with negative charges on the surface of bacteria, rendering the bacterial membrane immobile and thus killing the bacteria.192 However, due to electrostatic attraction, microbes and bacterial debris may spontaneously proliferate and adhere to the hydrogel surface thereby increasing the evaporation resistance. As a result, a composite polyelectrolyte photothermal hydrogel with both cationic and zwitterionic segments was proposed, in which the high-density ammonium groups of the poly-[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride segments endowed the hydrogel with antibacterial property, and the strong hydration generated by zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) via the ionic solvation effect contributed to the anti-biofouling capability. This composite polyelectrolyte photothermal hydrogel maintained stable evaporation for more than six weeks in real seawater.193
Structural regulation of interfacial evaporators
Pore structure
Pore structure control is particularly important in microstructural regulation. The abundant pores and rough surfaces of the evaporators reduce upward sunlight reflection and allow the sunlight to be absorbed by multiple scattering. Generally, the macroporous structure is more favorable for water transport and steam escape. Conversely, smaller pores, especially nanoscale pores smaller than the mean free path of air, are better for thermal insulation. Therefore, the ideal interfacial evaporator should have a hierarchical pore structure with pore sizes ranging from the nanometer to the micron scale.
The templating method is one of the effective means to create pores and adjust their size and appearance in the material matrix. The ice templating, also known as freeze casting or freeze drying, is widely used in the preparation of aerogels. It removes solvents such as water in the aerogel precursor through freeze crystallizing and sublimating, thereby leaving the corresponding pores in the network architecture. The control of operating parameters such as freezing direction and speed is an efficient way to achieve pore regulation inside the aerogel-based evaporators. The effects of different cold sources and freezing directions on the internal pore structure of the aerogels were investigated.157 As shown in Fig. 8a, horizontal unidirectional freezing in the refrigerator induces the formation of an irregular square porous structure, circular freezing in the lyophilizer promotes the formation of a honeycomb structure, and rapid longitudinal unidirectional freezing in liquid nitrogen eventually results in the formation of a vertical tubular structure. Different freezing directions create different temperature gradients inside the gel, which leads to different icing directions and shapes, thus forming a variety of pore structures. Besides, the freezing temperature has a substantial influence on the size of ice crystals. Lower temperatures promote rapid nucleation and inhibit ice crystal growth, resulting in smaller-sized pores in the aerogels. Wang et al.176 prepared foam-strengthened ultrablack carbon aerogels with micro-, meso- and macropores by freeze-drying. The microporous structure of the carbon aerogels induced strong hot-electron effect, thus significantly improving the evaporation efficiency. Furthermore, the effects of ice-templating and emulsion-templating methods on the pore structure of CNT aerogels were studied in comparison.195 The ice-templating CNT (rIT-CNT) aerogel exhibited a highly interconnected 3D network with pores originating from interstitial spaces of the entangled CNTs with an average pore size of ∼0.1 μm, while the network of emulsion-templating CNT (rET-CNT) aerogel had a lower cross-linking density and consisted of loose CNT microspheres with open gaps and channels with an average size of ∼5.6 μm (Fig. 8b). As a result, the rIT-CNT aerogel had a lower thermal conductivity, and its evaporation efficiency was 30% higher than that of the rET-CNT aerogel under one sun. Some specific materials have also been used as pore-forming materials for aerogels. For example, 3D porous graphene sheets obtained by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using nanoporous Ni (np-Ni) as templates completely replicated the open and bicontinuous porous structure of the np-Ni, with the average pore size ranging from a few hundred nanometers to a few microns depending on the CVD temperature.196 In the pitch-derived porous carbon nanofoam, a porous structure with an average pore size of ∼26.8 nm was introduced through combined templates of CaCO3 nanoparticles and NaCl.197

(e) Schematic diagrams of solar desalination by the wood-based evaporator with drilled channels and micron-sized natural channels (reproduced from ref. 204 with permission from John Wiley and Sons). 
In addition to modifying the pore structure using the templating method, gradient microchannels can also be fabricated by introducing a concentration gradient. Meng et al.198 constructed gradient vertical channels within a ring-like 3D aerogel based on porous nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) meshes, as shown in Fig. 8c. The gradient meant that the distance between adjacent graphene walls and the graphene wall thickness gradually increased from the center to the edge of the aerogel. The unique gradient microchannels were formed by introducing a concentration gradient of NH4OH into the N-rGO hydrogel before lyophilization. NH4OH not only acted as a nitrogen source to promote the orderly assembly of graphene but also regulated the ice crystallization behavior. This aerogel with ring-like pore channels absorbed sunlight without angular dependence and exhibited ring-by-ring thermal insulation with an evaporation efficiency improved by 93% compared to that of the honeycomb structured aerogel.
Water transport plays a key role in SIE. Stable and efficient water evaporation is inseparable from the continuous water supply. If the speed of water transport cannot keep up with the rate of light-to-heat conversion, or the salt crystals produced in the evaporation process block the water transport, the efficiency of evaporation will be greatly reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the continuous water supply capacity through reasonable design of the evaporator pore structure. Specifically, the vertically aligned channels with low tortuosity are more conducive to interfacial evaporation than random pore structures. Especially in seawater desalination, the transport route of salt solution is shortened, and the salt ions can diffuse back to the bulk water in the shortest path, thus avoiding a large accumulation of salt.199 Li et al.200 discovered that the strong hydrogen bonds between the pyranoid rings of cellulose induced a reorientation of microcrystalline cellulose in the presence of the ionic liquid. As a result, they produced a cellulose aerogel with vertically aligned channels that had an evaporation efficiency of 88%. And no crystallization was observed when soaking the aerogel in 20% NaCl solution for 20 days. In addition, it has been shown that radially aligned channels also exhibit excellent capillary water absorption capacity.201 As illustrated in Fig. 8d, based on the prominent capillarity and branched diffusion, the water transport rate and height of the aerogel with a radially aligned channel structure are significantly greater than those of the aerogel with a random porous structure. Therefore, after partial deposition of multi-walled CNTs, the aerogel with radially aligned channels achieves efficient water evaporation with an evaporation efficiency of 85.7% under one sun. In order to avoid pore blockage due to salt precipitation, hierarchical pore structures have been developed to control salt transport flux by regulating the ratio of the pores at each level.14,202,203 The salt concentration gradient formed between the hierarchical pores is the driving force for the salt to return to the bulk water, and the macroporous channels can also serve as salt drains. In the partially carbonized basswood block drilled with an array of millimeter-sized channels, salt concentration gradients were formed between the drilled channels and the micron-scale natural wood channels, and spontaneous salt exchange between the two types of channels was achieved through the pits on the wood cell walls (Fig. 8e).204 As a result, the salt was dissolved back into the bulk solution through the drilled channels. This evaporator exhibited an evaporation efficiency of ∼75% for 20 wt% NaCl solution under one sun and has long-term stability for continuous operation over 100 h. However, the drilled millimeter-scale pores sacrifice the effective sunlight absorption area to some extent.
The key to SIE also lies in achieving the localized conversion of sunlight into heat. Only by minimizing heat loss to the environment and the bulk water can high evaporation efficiency be obtained. Most previous studies prevented heat loss by simply adding commercial insulation components such as polyethylene and polystyrene foams, but the use of such petroleum-based materials defeated the sustainability purpose of the SIE. Therefore, improving the thermal management of the evaporators by modulating the internal pore structure and increasing the porosity of the materials has gradually gained attention. Inspired by the hollow structure of polar bear hair, the aerogels composed of hollow carbon tube fibers (CTAs) have been developed.205 The air inside the hollow carbon tubes hardly transferred heat, because the inner diameter of the tubes (35 nm) was much smaller than the mean free path of air (75 nm). The shell thickness of tubes affected the gas-phase convection, thermal radiation, and solid-phase conduction. The CTA with a tube shell thickness of 25 nm had a low thermal conductivity of 0.023 W m−1 K−1. When CTAs were used as the thermal insulating layer and light absorber layer for an interfacial evaporator, an evaporation efficiency of 79.6% could be achieved under one sun.206 Similarly, kapok fibers have also been used for interfacial evaporation due to their inherently hollow cylindrical topology. The kapok fiber aerogel modified by PPy had a thermal conductivity of 0.0241 W m−1 K−1, achieving an evaporation efficiency of 82.4% under one sun.207 Furthermore, another effective method for increasing porosity and thus enhancing thermal insulation is to incorporate porous materials into the evaporators. Hollow-structured materials, such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified hollow glass microspheres and hollow SiO2 microspheres have demonstrated remarkable results in optimizing the thermal management of the evaporators.208,209
Surface morphology
The surface morphology affects the performance of the evaporators in many ways. The texture of the surface can change the path of the incident light, as well as affect the convection near the surface. For hydrophobic surface, the roughness of the surface influences the hydrophobicity to some extent, thus affecting the self-floating, self-cleaning and anti-corrosion properties of the evaporators; for hydrophilic surface, the surface morphology and surface area directly determine the vaporization enthalpy and evaporation area of water, thus affecting the temperature and speed of water evaporation.
Efficient light absorption is essential to photothermal conversion. The most important goal for morphology regulation of the evaporators is to maximize the absorption of sunlight and minimize the outward reflection of sunlight, i.e., to build a surface that tends to be a black body. The special structure of some biomass in nature has provided many inspirations. For example, sunflower discs with a typical 3D array structure can reflect the light multiple times within each structural unit, as illustrated in Fig. 9a. The carbonized and PPy-decorated sunflower discs exhibited high sunlight absorption of over 98% throughout the entire solar spectrum.210,211 Unfortunately, the biomass that can be directly exploited is limited. Thus, more studies have attained the performance equivalent to that of natural organisms by building biomimetic structures. Li et al.212 deformed the 2D photothermal nanocoatings into hierarchical crest-ridge structures by sequential thermal actuation, inspired by the very dark appearance of the black scales of Bitis rhinoceros (Fig. 9b). The obtained biomimetic MXene nanocoatings have a dense crest texture that incident light can be strongly scattered and reflected several times, resulting in significantly increased broadband light absorption (84.9–86.9%) compared to planar MXene samples (46.8–64.0%) under one sun. Gan et al.213 constructed a 3D flower-like cellulose film through non-contacting control according to a magnetic field assistant strategy. In the petals of the film, a stable interwoven structure of magnetic nanoparticles and CNFs was generated. During the interfacial evaporation, these petals enhanced the light absorption and suppressed the radiation loss through multiple reflections of sunlight, thus greatly improving the energy utilization efficiency. Specifically, the 3D flower-like structure increased the evaporation efficiency to 90.6% from 76.9% of 2D cellulose film. In addition, the flexible carbon cloth nanocomposite with a biomimetic Pelargonium hortorum-petal-like surface214 and the plasmonic wooden flower imitating lotus215 have also been developed and exhibit good interfacial evaporation properties.

In general, arrayed crumpled surface morphology is more favorable for light absorption and has a synergistic effect on improving surface roughness and surface area. Following this research direction, various techniques have been applied for surface morphology modulation. Among them, embossing with a mold is the easiest and most efficient method. Lu et al.216 created concave pyramid-shaped surface patterns on a photothermal hydrogel for increasing the solar absorption from 95.3% to 98.2%. Simultaneously, the groove structure introduced temperature and tension gradients under solar irradiation, which activated the Marangoni convection, thus enhancing water transport and vapor conversion efficiency. However, the accuracy of this technique for surface texturing is only up to the micron level. Surfaces with both micro- and nanoscale texture exhibit more extraordinary properties. For example, the polyethylene/graphene foam with a micro-nanostructured surface reflected only ∼1.6% of sunlight and had a high water contact angle of 155 ± 2°.217 The nickel template with micro-pyramid arrays was first used to construct a primary microstructure on the surface of the polyethylene/graphene nanosheets/NaCl composite by compression molding. After extracting NaCl, irregular pores appeared, and a secondary nanostructure was formed by spraying SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 9c). Besides, laser technique with high precision and fast engraving speed is widely used in the modulation of the evaporator textural structure. As a result of the high energy input, not only the material surface shows specific patterns, but also the material composition near the surface is changed. Singh et al.218 treated a shiny Al sheet into a super-light-absorbing (and super-wicking) surface by single-step femtosecond laser technique. As shown in Fig. 9d, the surface consisted of hierarchical nano- and microstructures, where Al nanoparticles realized strong light absorption by LSPR and periodic microgrooves further captured scattered light, resulting in 97% absorption across the entire solar spectrum and 85% absorption in the non-solar region. Most organic materials, including biomass and polymers, form carbonized layers or even graphene-structured surfaces after laser treatment.141,219 For example, the top layer of a laser-ablated polyimide membrane is transformed into a porous graphene structure, which not only minimizes the energy loss caused by the diffuse reflection of light but also enhances the evaporation area.219 The modification of nanomaterials on the surface is also one of the important means of morphology control. Kim et al.220 prepared an evaporator with high evaporation area by growing TiO2 nanorods on a carbon foam. The growth of the 1D nanorods provided the evaporator with a very rough surface texture that ultimately resulted in an enhancement of the nanoscale surface area. With the synergistic effect of the increased surface area and the hydrophilicity of the TiO2 nanorods, the evaporator obtained an evaporation rate of 2.23 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. Yu et al.221 used p-toluene sulfonate acid as a template to deposit PPy nanoarrays on carbon cloth, effectively reducing the reflection loss of light (Fig. 9e). More importantly, micro-meniscuses were generated between the nanoarrays after water absorption, and the Marangoni effect was formed due to the different evaporation rates at each point on the meniscuses, and then a part of the water reached the top of the arrays to form microdroplets with diameters less than 1 μm. These microdroplets had higher saturated vapor pressure and lower evaporation enthalpy, which significantly improved the evaporation rate (Fig. 9e). The carbon cloth-PPy array (CC-PPy array) with a PPy array height of ∼600 nm showed an evaporation rate of 2.16 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun.
Wettability
Interfacial evaporators with only a single wettability, hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, are bound to face a trade-off between thermal management and water transport. For the evaporators with uniform hydrophilic structures, the filling of water in the open pores increases thermal conductivity, resulting in more heat loss, and thus weakening thermal localization. Moreover, in desalination, the brine is lifted to the evaporator surface, and the rapid evaporation of water causes the precipitation of salt on the surface, which may hinder solar absorption and prevent evaporation. The completely hydrophobic structure has self-cleaning characteristics, however, water cannot be transported through it, thus limiting heat transfer to the water and reducing the evaporation efficiency. Therefore, in order to maximize the evaporation efficiency, the photothermal material is usually assembled with insulation and water transport components to form an interfacial evaporation system.15,220,222,223 In recent years, inspired by the lotus leaf, the design and construction of Janus photothermal aerogels or other monoliths with asymmetric wettability, have gradually attracted attention. These photothermal materials with special wetting characteristics can be used alone for SIE to achieve spatial isolation of the light-absorbing layer and bulk water, which reduces the structural complexity of interfacial evaporation systems without sacrificing the localized management of heat. Besides, this Janus structure shows significant advantages in desalination applications. During the high-speed evaporation process, the salt concentration only gradually increases at the interface between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, so that the salt diffuses back into the bulk water easily without blocking solar absorption.
Currently, various strategies have been used to render materials hydrophobicity, including silane modification, hydrophobic particle deposition,224,225 hydrophobic agent coating,74 and laser engraving.226 Generally, the silane modification of hydrophilic materials is recognized as a simple and efficient method. Siloxanes or chlorosilanes undergo hydrolysis first, followed by the dehydration condensation reaction with the hydroxyl groups of the hydrophilic materials, replacing the hydrophilic groups with hydrophobic ones. Methods such as spraying and partial immersion of the modifier solutions have been used for single-sided hydrophobic modification of hydrophilic materials.118,131,227–229 For example, the Janus evaporators obtained by partial dip coating of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) show self-recovering surface hydrophobicity due to the ability of PDMS to rebuild siloxane bonds, demonstrating long-term stable salt resistance and durable resistance to photochemical damages.230 However, due to the wicking effect, the distribution uniformity and penetration depth of the silane solution cannot be precisely controlled by the above methods. Taking advantage of this feature, Guo et al.231 found that the water evaporation behavior could be modulated by the inhomogeneous surface wettability. As shown in Fig. 10a, hydrophobic island-shaped patches appeared on the hydrogel evaporator surface after contacting one side of the hydrogel surface with trichloro(octadecyl)silane (OTS). When the OTS coverage was 30%, the evaporation rate under one sun could reach a maximum value of ∼4.0 kg m−2 h−1.

In addition to the hydrophobic modification of hydrophilic materials, hydrophilic modification of hydrophobic materials is also feasible, and the currently employed methods include acidification,232 O2 plasma treatment,233,234 UV-grafting of acrylic acid monomer,235etc. The growth of hydrophilic coatings on hydrophobic surfaces is also an effective approach. For instance, one surface of the hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane could be decorated with hydrophilic PDA under the modulation of CuSO4/H2O2, resulting in the formation of the Janus structure with opposite wettability up and down.236 Besides, the construction of Janus wetting structures is not limited to the top and bottom asymmetry. The inner and outer asymmetric wettability also has outstanding advantages in SIE, which can also afford stable floatability, thermal localization of solar energy, and continuous water transport.237,238 As illustrated in Fig. 10b, the nitrogen-doped hydrophilic graphene nanopetals grown on the external surface of the hydrophobic graphene foam by one-step plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) constituted on-surface waterways.239 Therefore, an adequate water supply was achieved for solar vapor generation and spontaneous salt diffusion, while the hydrophobic foam interior prevented water infiltration and salt fouling. In the real seawater SIE test for more than 240 h, this structure exhibited stable performance, obtaining an evaporation efficiency of 88.6 ± 2.1%. By O2-plasma treatment, the surface of the superhydrophobic carbonized Fe3O4-modified cellulose aerogel was activated to be hydrophilic, allowing the fast water supply.179 And the internal superhydrophobic property enabled the aerogel to maintain a low thermal conductivity of 0.044 W m−1 K−1.
Except for the well-defined up-down asymmetric and inner-outer asymmetric Janus structures, recent studies have pointed out that the mixed hydrophilic and hydrophobic structures in evaporators are also effective in balancing water transport and evaporation. As shown in Fig. 10c, the nonwoven composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polypropylene/polyethylene (PP/PE) fibers has a transitional structure of entangled hydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers that induces the formation of a wettability gradient in the thickness direction, thus providing a unidirectional water-transfer function.240 In the application of SIE, unlike most other evaporators, the multi-walled CNTs for photothermal conversion are sprayed on the hydrophilic surface, while the hydrophobic side of the nonwoven is in contact with the bulk water surface. The differential capillary effect driven by the internal wettability gradient allows the water to be pumped from the hydrophobic bottom surface to the hydrophilic surface. By adjusting the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers, the water transfer rate and evaporation rate are optimally matched, and an evaporation rate of 1.44 kg m−2 h−1 is achieved under one sun. Li et al.241 developed a covalent organic framework (COF)/graphene dual-region hydrogel by an in situ growth strategy, in which COF-loaded rGO constituted the hydrophilic region and pure rGO constituted the hydrophobic region (Fig. 10d). The synergistic effect of the dual regions could effectively regulate the pore size of the hydrogel network and the ratio of intermediate water to free water. By precisely controlling the two wetting regions, the water content was optimized and thus the energy demand for water vaporization was reduced, resulting in an evaporation rate of 3.69 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun.
Design of evaporation systems
In addition to regulating the chemical composition, surface morphology, pore characteristics and other microstructures of the evaporators, the macroscopic 3D structures of the entire evaporation systems need to be optimized in order to improve the practical application effect to a greater extent, especially high-efficiency thermal management, enhancement of solar energy absorption, and control of water transport, as summarized in Table 3.

Design for high-efficiency thermal management
Spatial isolation of the solar-absorbing layer from the bulk water is a common strategy to effectively prevent solar heat transfer to the bulk water. One isolation method is to use the support materials to keep the solar-absorbing layer at a certain distance from the water surface, and to use the hydrophilic materials as the water transport channels to continuously pump water to the solar-absorbing layer through capillary action.16,130,137,242,243 However, this approach requires additional support and water transport components, and it is challenging to be applied directly in open water, such as sea desalination. Water needs to be transferred into the storage device before evaporation, which increases the complexity and cost of the operation. On this basis, self-floating evaporators have been further investigated. They can float on the water surface while avoiding direct contact between the bulk water and the solar-absorbing layer. The double-layer structure is often considered to achieve high energy utilization efficiency.79,244,245 The top solar-absorbing layer effectively absorbs incident sunlight and converts it into heat for liquid-to-vapor conversion below the boiling point, while the bottom layer is usually employed for thermal insulation and floating support. And the water transport component connecting the top and bottom layers inhibits heat transfer to the bulk water and delivers water to the solar-absorbing layer. Splicing and assembling are commonly used to create a double-layer structure. As shown in Fig. 11a, a double-layer self-floating CNT-based evaporator with outstanding thermal management was constructed.206 The hydrophobic CNT-based aerogel with thermal conductivity of 0.023 W m−1 K−1 was directly used as the thermal insulation layer, the hydrophilic modified CNT-based aerogel decorated with Au nanoparticles was used as the solar absorber layer, and cross-shaped wool felt was placed between the two layers for water transport. Due to the excellent thermal insulation of the lower aerogel layer, the heat loss from the surface to the bulk water was effectively resisted, and the solar thermal conversion efficiency was increased by ∼26% compared with the single-layer structure. However, these separated double-layer structures are generally loosely constructed or require complex assembly processes, and the discontinuous interfacial transition inevitably has an impact on the comprehensive performance and stability of the evaporators in practical applications. Therefore, unique strategies have been employed to obtain seamless one-piece bilayer structures. Jiang et al.246 reported a two-step bacterial culture process to fabricate the bilayered hybrid biofoam. Firstly, GO flakes were incorporated into the bacterial culture medium to obtain a GO-filled bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) hydrogel. Then additional bacteria broth was added to the surface of the GO-filled BNC hydrogel to form the BNC layer. During the application of SIE, the BNC layer was wetted, but had a thermal conductivity (0.466 W m−1 K−1) lower than that of water, minimizing heat loss to the bulk water and enriching the heat to the evaporation surface. Han et al.247 prepared a single-module Janus evaporator with the hydrophilic CNF aerogel as the lower part and the hydrophobic CNF/MXene aerogel as the upper part through a pre-freezing process (Fig. 11b). When used in SIE, the upper part stayed well dried and maintained thermal insulation, resulting in an evaporation rate of up to 2.287 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. Through similar approaches, bilayer rGO-based photothermal evaporators and bilayer chitosan-derived hydrogels have been reported.248,249 And based on the double-layer structure, some one-piece integrated evaporators with more complex mushroom-shaped structures have also been developed by heterogeneous mixing and multi-step freeze-drying.152,250

Copyright 2021 American Chemical Society). 
In addition to insulating the solar-absorbing layer from bulk water with solid materials, creating a gaseous thermal barrier is another method to prevent heat dissipation. As illustrated in Fig. 11c, an all-in-one evaporator with a concave structure was constructed by layer-by-layer 3D printing.251 The CNT/GO layer was used for solar absorption, and the GO/nanofibrillated cellulose (GO/NFC) layer and the porous GO/NFC wall were responsible for water transport. During the SIE, air with low thermal conductivity was filled in the middle cavity of the 3D-printed evaporator as an effective thermal barrier to inhibit the heat loss. Compared with the 3D-printed CNT/GO film in direct contact with the bulk water, this evaporator had a higher energy conversion efficiency, increasing from 66.6% to 85.6%.
The structural designs discussed above are aimed at reducing heat transfer to bulk water, which is required to achieve efficient evaporation. On this basis, constructing temperature gradients at the evaporation interface is an effective way to further improve the evaporation efficiency. Luo et al.252 constructed an evaporator with a patterned surface by selectively printing carbon black on air-laid paper, and found that the temperature differences between adjacent patterns caused the lateral heat and mass transfer, improving the SIE performance. The sample covered with 90% of carbon black showed an evaporation rate comparable to that of the all-black sample. In the evaporation system constructed by Cao et al.,253 the hydrophilic PVA/CNT foam was surrounded by a hydrophobic CNT film (Fig. 11d). Due to the difference in wettability, the temperature of the CNT film was higher than that of the PVA/CNT foam under one sun, forming a temperature gradient of 29.7 °C. Through the gradient heating effect, the heat in the CNT film was continuously transferred to the PVA/CNT foam evaporator, increasing the evaporation rate to 4.2 kg m−2 h−1.
In addition to minimizing heat loss, improving the absorption of heat from the environment could also help enhance evaporation efficiency in case that the temperature of the partial area of the evaporator is lower than the ambient temperature. Through reasonable design, the energy absorbed by the evaporator can offset the energy loss, so that the comprehensive evaporation efficiency (the input energy only takes incident solar energy) can be higher than the theoretical limit of 100%.254 Therefore, it is obvious that all these evaporators have 3D structures, and their total evaporation surface area is greater than their horizontal projection area. In areas not exposed to sunlight, evaporation of water acts as a cooling effect. Moreover, in this case, the incident solar energy intensity is usually kept no more than one sun.255 Because high-intensity sunlight will raise the temperature of the entire evaporator, thus reducing the temperature difference and even reversing the direction of heat transfer.256 Based on the above theoretical analysis, the geometry and height of the 3D evaporators can be adjusted to change the proportion of the cold evaporation surface and coordinate the balance between environmental heat absorption and water transport, resulting in an optimum evaporation effect. The simulation results of the evaporation flux rate for domed, conical and cylindrical evaporators under solar irradiation at zenith angles of 0° and 45° are shown in Fig. 12a.257 The cylindrical evaporator obtained the highest evaporation flux for both zenith angles, attributed to its high evaporative area index (EAI, which is defined as the ratio of the total evaporative surface area to the projected area). As the height of the evaporator increased, the EAI increased, and thus the evaporation flux increased. However, the water transport capacity is different at different heights, so the water lifting limit should be considered. The optimal height of the evaporator was simulated by combining the two aspects. Furthermore, the GO stalk with EAI values up to 70 was also constructed with an evaporation rate of 34.7 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. Zheng et al.258 designed an array of engineered trees using delignified wood, which could lift water more than 1 foot, resulting in a larger evaporation surface. The freshwater generation rate of the array composed of 16 trees reached 4.8 L m−2 h−1 in a closed space under 1 sun. Shao et al.46 demonstrated a Ni1Co3@PDA sponge-based evaporator and adjusted the height of the evaporator by stacking different numbers of photothermal sponges. As the height increased, the evaporation rate and efficiency first increased and then decreased, and there existed an optimal case where the evaporation efficiency could reach 112.7%.

In a normal evaporator, the upward heat loss from the solar-absorbing surface with higher temperature is still inevitable. Wang et al.259 drew attention to this issue and proposed a solution. As shown in Fig. 12b, several vertical fins were placed above the warm evaporation surface (WES) to serve as the cold evaporation surface. These vertical fins did not interfere with the solar absorption on the WES, and more importantly, they could effectively capture and recycle the energy dissipated from the WES by thermal radiation and convection, and the latent heat released from vapor condensation. Although these vertical fins absorbed a small portion of the evaporated water, the overall water evaporation was still promoted due to high energy recovery, achieving an evaporation rate of 2.53 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. Li et al.260 designed a heteromorphic arch-like evaporator array using polytetrafluoroethylene/CNT composite hollow fibers (Fig. 12c). The arch-like fiber array achieved a 360° evaporation, and the surface temperature of the bottom base was much higher than the ambient temperature and the surface temperature of the overhead hollow fibers. As a result, the heat radiation and convection loss on the surface of the hollow fibers were partly eliminated, while the base material also enhanced steam generation on the surface of the hollow fibers through convection and radiation. The array system recovered approximately 10–16 kg m−2 of freshwater per day outdoors when carbon cloth was used as the base material.
In addition, it should be noted that although the air convection will take away some of the heat generated by the evaporator, airflow can also take away the evaporated water molecules and reduce the relative humidity around the evaporating surface. Thus, reasonably regulating the airflow velocity can generally increase the evaporation rate. Therefore, some studies introduced airflow into the evaporation system or reasonably regulated the density of the evaporation arrays to maximize the evaporation rate.132,258–260
Design for enhancing solar absorption
Sunlight shining on the evaporator surface will inevitably have a certain degree of reflection. In order to construct a surface that tends to be as black as possible, a lot of research has been carried out on the development of photothermal materials and the regulation of pore structure and surface morphology as mentioned above. In fact, reasonable macrostructure designs can also play a pivotal role. Conical structures are typical and commonly used for light trapping. The photothermal cones have been combined with the support and water transport assembly to achieve efficient water evaporation.261–263 Compared with the 2D plane, the 3D photothermal cone has better sunlight capture ability, because the sunlight incident into the cavity can be reflected and absorbed many times. Photothermal cones with different of apex angles exhibit different sunlight-trapping capabilities. As shown in Fig. 13a, as the cone apex angle decreases further, the number of multiple reflections increases gradually. Specifically, photothermal cones of polyvinylidene fluoride coated with PPy could reach 99.2% solar absorption when the top angle was 56°.264 To further improve reflection within the cavity, folded cones were proposed (Fig. 13b). The increasing folds enhanced multiple reflections of the incident sunlight, thus increasing the possibility of solar absorption and subsequent photothermal conversion. The average temperature of a 32-folded cone increased from 42 °C to 58 °C under one sun compared with plane cones.265 In addition, special 3D structures obtained by origami also exhibit extraordinary effects in enhancing solar absorption. For example, the origami-based evaporator with good geometric compressibility and rigidity had highly controllable surface area densities in which the periodic array of mountain-valley folds formed a concave structure, effectively capturing and recovering diffuse reflected sunlight and minimizing radiative and convective heat losses (Fig. 13c). As a result, the evaporation efficiency was close to 100%.266

The solar elevation changes constantly at the same location throughout the day. However, the solar absorbing surface of most evaporators is parallel to the water surface, making the evaporation highly dependent on the incident angle of sunlight. Generally, the evaporators demonstrate good solar absorption performance only when the incidence angle is 0°. Therefore, some strategies have been proposed to solve the problem of sunlight angle variation in practical applications. The most straightforward approach is to track the variation in the incident angle. Liu et al.267 designed a heliotropic evaporation model based on hierarchical polyacrylonitrile@CuS fabrics. In this model, the photothermal fabric was stretched and the two edges were fixed in two tanks of different heights. Adjusting the tank height changed the tilt angle so that the fabric remained orthogonal to the solar irradiation. Therefore, the model maintained an almost constant evaporation rate under inclined sunlight. However, in practical applications of the above design, mechanical tracking facilities are essential to ensure accurate and continuous angle manipulation, which requires high energy consumption and capital investment, increasing the difficulty of practical deployment in some remote areas. Therefore, the evaporation system that can receive a wide angular range of incident sunlight without external energy input is of relatively high practical application value, and it usually has a large solar absorption and evaporation surface area. The natural 3D structure of plants can maximize the absorption of sunlight at varied incident angles throughout the day. Inspired by this, artificial transpiration devices in the shape of a 3D hollow cone (tip up) have been proposed to alleviate the dependence on the incident angle of sunlight.16,268 Besides, lianas with fenestrated leaves, such as Monstera, were found to grow faster in dappled or oblique sunlight. Based on this, further upgraded ultra-black paper-based artificial trees with 3D hierarchical structure and leaf fenestration were developed.269 As shown in Fig. 13d, incident sunlight was effectively utilized through multiple reflections, diffractions, and thermal radiation between the fenestrated leaves. When the incident sunlight angle increased to 75°, the evaporation rate of the artificial trees with six layers of leaves remained at 1.28 kg m−2 h−1, higher than that of the 2D evaporator under vertical incident sunlight. In addition, Liu et al.256 constructed a 3D photothermal catalytic spherical evaporator by using microfluidic blow spinning technology. The ultrafine polymer nanofibers deposited on the surface and PPy grown in situ provided a large specific surface area. As shown in Fig. 13e, the spherical geometry ensured omnidirectional solar absorbance by the hemispheres facing the light, while also keeping the opposite hemisphere in shadow to capture energy from warmer environments. Under one sun illumination, the water evaporation rates at different incident angles of sunlight were similar. When incident angles were at 90°, 60°, 30° and 0°, the evaporation rates were 3.6, 3.17, 3.09 and 3.33 kg m−2 h−1, respectively.
Most of the evaporators reported at present produce water vapor on the same side as the sunlight exposure. Water vapor has greater absorption, scattering and reflection of sunlight, which interferes with the absorption of sunlight by evaporator. Moreover, the liquid water generated on the transparent shell used for condensation recovery also filters out a portion of the incident sunlight. In order to solve the above problems, evaporators with photothermal conversion and water evaporation on the two separate sides have been proposed.270 In a Janus-interface solar steam generator, one side was used to absorb solar energy via micro-nano hybrid antireflection structure, the other side enhanced water evaporation by a hydrophilic polymer with a large number of microchannels and a multi-level porous structure, and high thermal conductivity metal skeleton allowed the heat from solar energy to be easily transferred from the absorption side to the evaporation side.271 The evaporation system of solar steam generator based on the Janus-interface is illustrated in Fig. 13f. It avoided energy losses of up to 26% due to reflection and scattering of water vapor, enhanced solar energy utilization efficiency by ∼35%, and produced about 10 L m−2 of purified water per day outdoors.
Design for controlling water transport
In SIE systems, the water transport path refers to the channel through which the water flows from the bulk phase to the evaporation interface, and can be divided into 1D, 2D and 3D channels according to the dimension. In typical double-layer assembled structures as well as special 3D structures (e.g., hollow cones,16,261 artificial trees,269 and spheres,256 as mentioned above), the water transport paths are mostly 1D and composed of cotton rods, wicks, cotton fabrics, air-laid papers, or filter papers, etc., which pass through the insulation/support layer to transfer water to the evaporation interface, allowing for efficient inhibition of heat loss. To further enhance the water transport rate to match the photothermal conversion rate, hydrophilic materials such as 2D absorbent fabrics and air-laid papers were also sandwiched between the light-absorbing layer and the thermal insulation layer in the double-layer assembled structures, and their edges were immersed in the bulk water to form 2D water transport paths.206,211,245 In the novel integrated evaporators, the upper part is used for photothermal conversion and thermal localization, and the lower part is a cross-linked 3D porous structure, which effectively maintain water pumping with high flux. As mentioned above, the coordination between water transport and photothermal conversion is particularly important. In addition to the adjustment of microstructure and chemical composition, the macroscopic design that affects water transport cannot be ignored. Especially in the application of seawater desalination, the rational design and optimization of the water transport channels at micro and macro levels is of great significance to alleviate salt deposition.
To solve the problem of salt deposition, it has been mentioned above that the low-curvature channels and multi-scale pores are beneficial to enhance salt ion exchange and the Janus structure can prevent the deposition of salt grains on the evaporator surface effectively. And from the perspective of water transport control, it can be optimized in two directions. One is to always maintain rapid water transport in the evaporation system to strengthen salt ion exchange and prevent the salt from crystallizing, and the other is to induce the salt to crystallize only at specific locations, allowing the salt to be recovered without affecting the evaporation.
For the former, designing multi-level water delivery networks is one of the effective ways. Yuan et al.272 designed a T-type fluidic photothermal evaporator in which the PVA/CNT film with uniform holes wrapping a cotton thread was wound into a coiled tube structure (Fig. 14a). The hydrophilic cotton thread formed the in-tube water transfer medium, and the uniform holes on the tube wall formed the in-plane water diffusion paths. Benefiting from the dual-mode water transfer, the evaporator showed almost no salt on the surface after 200 h of evaporation in 3.5 wt% artificial seawater. In the evaporation system shown in Fig. 14b, water was first transferred to the upper photothermal aerogel through the cotton cores, and the superhydrophilic square microgrooves on the photothermal aerogel constituted a secondary water transport channel.273 During the interfacial evaporation of brine, for the evaporator without the microgroove structure, a gradually increasing salt concentration was formed on the evaporation surface from the center of the cotton cores to the edge, and then salt grains started to nucleate, grow, and accumulate from the edge to the center. In contrast, the microgrooves accelerated the ion exchange by capillary forces, reducing the salt concentration gradient between the edge and the center of the cotton cores, thereby delaying salt crystallization at the edge and achieving 86.83% evaporation efficiency in 20 wt% NaCl solution. According to the characteristic that salt always crystallizes from the edges, a bridge-arch solar evaporator was proposed to achieve salt rejection by introducing predetermined contacting edges between the evaporator and the bulk water. Moreover, the biomimetic arrays of grooves and microcavities on the evaporator surface acted as water replenishment channels so that a double-layer 3D liquid film was formed (Fig. 14c).274 The lower confined water film ensured sufficient liquid supplementation, and the directional Marangoni convection generated in the upper free-flowing water film effectively prevented salt accumulation and the formation of salt concentration gradients along the evaporator surface. As a result, the evaporator surface remained clean and the evaporation efficiency was 89% after 200 h of continuous evaporation in 10 wt% NaCl solution.

For the latter, it is an ideal zero-liquid discharge process, which not only recovers clean water but also collects solid salt. During the evaporation of brine, it is a common phenomenon that the farther the water is transferred, the greater the salt concentration at the corresponding location, and salt precipitation occurs when a critical value is reached. The results of the computational fluid dynamics model that simulated advection and diffusion of salt and evaporation of water were also consistent with this phenomenon.275 Based on this feature, a T-shape evaporator composed of a longitudinal wood membrane (L-wood) and a surface-carbonized L-wood was reported (Fig. 14d).276 The brine was guided by the aligned channels in the membrane plane to be transported from the support to the top surface and further to the edge of the T-shape evaporator, where it was finally crystallized and collected. The evaporation rate and salt collection rate of the T-shape evaporator maintained at 1.93 kg m−2 h−1 and 56.6 g m−2 h−1, respectively, when evaporating 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 60 h under one sun. There are also some other 3D evaporators that are well designed to achieve the separation of light absorption and salt precipitation. For example, cup-shaped evaporators, in which the bottom of the cup was used as the absorbing surface and the wall was used as the salt precipitation surface,277 and umbrella-shaped evaporators, in which the salt that crystallized first at the edge was automatically separated from the umbrella by gravity.275,278 In these 3D structures, water continued to be transported at the hydrophilic evaporation interface after being transferred to the evaporation interface through a 1D water path. Therefore, the control of water transport cannot only rely on the design of the narrowly defined transport paths, otherwise the room for improvement will be too limited. Additionally, a Janus suspended type evaporator with a 2D water transport path was also able to achieve zero-liquid discharge.279 As shown in Fig. 14e, a fibrous mat with opposite wetting behavior on the upper and lower sides was suspended between two tanks, and its extended hydrophilic layer was immersed in the water inside the tank and continuously drew the water to the evaporation interface. With rapid evaporation, salt crystals were confined to the middle part of the hydrophilic lower layer of the fibrous mat and fell by gravity, without interfering with sunlight absorption and water recharge.
Outlook and conclusions
Outlook
At present, under laboratory and outdoor small-scale model conditions, SIE has achieved significant high evaporation rates and efficiencies in both simulated seawater and real seawater samples and has shown great salt resistance and durability. However, there are still major obstacles between the current research status and large-scale practical applications. The development of SIE still faces some challenges and opportunities in the future, as follows.
(1) The yield of clean water is directly related to the solar absorption area and evaporation area of the SIE systems. Since most interfacial evaporators have solar absorption and water evaporation surfaces parallel to the horizontal plane, a large area is required for the SIE systems to evaporate large amounts of water. Therefore, research on the vertical expansion of the structure of 3D evaporators is of great significance. The evaporators with spherical, conical, tree-shaped, or other special structures have large solar absorption and evaporation surface areas while occupying relatively small horizontal projected areas, resulting in a relatively high evaporation capacity per projected area. However, this advantage also comes with poor portability. These 3D evaporators take up more space and face the issue of fragile constructions requiring additional protection, which greatly increases transportation costs. Therefore, in addition to further improving and developing new materials and structures with excellent light absorption, heat insulation, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, etc., the development of long-term compression-resistant and foldable evaporator materials should also be brought into focus.
(2) At present, most of the reported SIE systems are applied to seawater desalination and have achieved considerable results. However, for water sources with complex compositions, especially those containing low boiling point contaminants, the cleanliness of the condensates produced by SIE cannot be guaranteed. During evaporation, some volatile contaminants will escape, condense, and be collected along with water vapor. Although a few studies proposed that the use of activated carbon with good adsorption capacity as a photothermal material could effectively reduce the content of volatile contaminants in condensates,78,280 the issue of limited service life caused by adsorption saturation has not yet been resolved. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop SIE systems for the treatment of water sources containing volatile contaminants. The development of adsorbent materials with fast adsorption rates, large adsorption capacities, simple regeneration processes, and their coupling in SIE systems are crucial if the pollutant emission problem is considered to be solved by synergistic adsorption. Improvements to the condensate recovery system may be another solution, that is, collecting clean water and other volatile pollutants separately. In addition, even though significant progress has been made in coping with salt blockage and microbial contamination, the development of durable SIE systems with higher fouling resistance, corrosion resistance and recyclability in the face of more complex water sources is still required.
(3) The SIE's performance is usually investigated under laboratory conditions. The light intensity is consistently stabilized at one sun or higher, and the ambient temperature is maintained above 20 °C with moderate humidity and no airflow disturbance. In practical applications, however, the performance of SIE is not ideal, as solar radiation reaching the evaporation interface is weakened by local geography, weather, and condensed water. And the temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. are not controllable. Consequently, more attention should be paid to the development of highly efficient SIE systems suitable for non-ideal environmental conditions, such as low sunlight intensity, high humidity, low temperature, or strong convection. And it is inextricably linked to the fundamental studies related to energy conversion, heat transfer, mass transfer, and vapor diffusion kinetics in SIE systems. The analysis of these conversion processes will help us better understand the relationship between the structure and performance of SIE systems. However, most of the current studies are based on the analysis of experimental results to improve the material or system structures, and a few of them verify the experimental results by simple simulations. There is still a lack of elaboration on the mechanism of microscopic transfer and transformation of energy and mass in SIE systems. It is necessary to conduct a lot of in-depth research on the mechanism of interfacial evaporation by combining advanced online detection technology and theoretical calculations.
(4) The evaporation rates and efficiencies reported in SIE studies are currently measured in open systems by placing the water sample to be evaporated on a balance and monitoring the mass changes. In practice, however, the purpose of SIE is to recover condensate rather than to release water vapor into the atmosphere. In most of the previous studies, transparent covers were generally used as condensation walls, which inevitably blocked part of the incident sunlight. As evaporation proceeded, the effects of pressure, temperature, and humidity in such closed systems also greatly interfered with evaporation and condensation, resulting in lower actual evaporation performance than measured in the laboratory. Recently, a few optimization schemes such as the recycling of latent heat have been proposed to improve water collection.281,282 However, the reliability and practicality of these research results still need to be analyzed and addressed in depth. Therefore, the design and development of advanced condensation-collection systems should be given attention.
(5) The implementability of the scale-up of SIE systems remains to be proven. There are two main application locations for SIE systems. One is to build SIE systems on land, which can ensure the stability of the evaporation process but occupy a large area of land. Pumping and transporting water from the source will also increase the operating costs. The other is to build the SIE systems directly on the open water. In this case, it is possible to achieve in situ water supply without considering the problem of high buildings blocking sunlight, but waves and sea wind have unpredictable effects on the stability of SIE. It is challenging to construct a matching condensation–collection system on the surface of the sea or lake. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out scale-up experiments to verify the comprehensive performance of SIE engineering applications and to propose realistic solutions.
(6) High cost is also a major challenge in scaling up SIE systems. The manufacturing costs of various photothermal nanomaterials, aerogels, and hydrogels mentioned above, which are synthesized in small quantities in the laboratory, have not attracted much attention. However, the raw material costs, technical difficulties, time costs, power consumption, and environmental impact of large-scale production must be considered. Therefore, the research and development of novel low-cost materials remain a top priority. In the selection of raw materials, biomass materials are recommended because they are abundant in source, inexpensive and environmentally friendly. In terms of production, energy-intensive and time-consuming technologies should be avoided. For example, there is an urgent need to improve the technology for producing aerogels. The freeze-drying technology currently used has low production efficiency and requires complex equipment due to the necessity to create low temperature and vacuum conditions, resulting in high operating expenses. In addition, the installation costs of other ancillary equipment (condensing components, water tanks) required for the construction of the entire SIE system and the additional power input that may be involved (pumping of water, introduction of airflow through fans) increase the difficulty of application in off-grid areas.
(7) The functionality of SIE is expected to be extended and expanded. Some studies have already started to focus on the simultaneous implementation of other forms of energy conversion and SIE. For example, the integration of extensive functions such as photocatalytic conversion, thermoelectric conversion, salinity-induced electricity generation, and water wave detection in SIE systems has achieved initial success.250,256,283–287 The corresponding technical parameters are expected to be improved through further development, and the application field of SIE will go beyond the production of clean water.
Conclusions
In this review, the latest research progress in SIE is covered in detail from four aspects: the development and structural control of photothermal nanomaterials, the construction of interfacial evaporators, the structural regulation of interfacial evaporators, and the advanced design of SIE systems. So far, a variety of photothermal materials with high solar absorption have been developed, including plasmonic metal nanoparticles, semiconductors, carbon-based materials, organic polymers, MXenes, etc. By generating nanoscale sizes, forming beneficial geometries, hybridization, and other structural modifications, these materials achieve enhanced photothermal properties and are effective for localized heating when introduced into the interfacial evaporators. Interfacial evaporators are divided into 2D and 3D evaporators according to dimension, among which 3D evaporators have better evaporation performance because of the larger evaporation area and the better light trapping, thermal insulation and water transport capacity. Specifically, structural properties such as pore structure, surface morphology and wettability of interfacial evaporators affect their evaporation performance in different aspects. Besides, the approaches and strategies to achieve efficient thermal management, enhance light absorption and control water transport are discussed from the perspective of the macrostructure design of SIE systems. Finally, some challenges and opportunities for the development of SIE are discussed, hoping to provide some guidance for future research.
Although further study, development and improvement of SIE are required, the inherent advantages of thermal localization ensure that this technology is bound to become one of the key strategies for sustainable access to clean water. The application of SIE is expected to be developed on a large scale in the upcoming years.
