    , Accepted 16th March 2023First published on 17th March 2023AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells have been considered promising candidates for novel applications that require a high power-to-weight ratio. However, the scalable ambient air deposition of efficient devices remains a major challenge of this technology. In addition, toxic solvents are regularly used in perovskite layer deposition, which can damage the environment and endanger the safety of potential production lines. In this paper, we introduce sustainable flexible perovskite solar modules (flex-PSMs), in which all layers are deposited via blade coating in ambient air without the usage of toxic solvents. A double-cation Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3−xBrx-based perovskite is blade coated in two steps as the absorber and the coating parameters are optimized. We found that proper drying in the first step is crucial to obtain high-quality perovskite films with the right phase of the perovskite. We improved the morphology and limited the voids in the perovskite layer by additive engineering and obtained 14% efficiency. Finally, 94 cm2 modules were manufactured to demonstrate the scalability of the process.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an excellent choice for flexible devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency and low-temperature solution-processing fabrication techniques. Flexible PSCs (flex-PSCs) deliver a high power-to-weight ratio, are low cost, and are environmentally friendly.1–5 Flexibility and low weight make them adaptable to various surfaces and enable broad applications such as tandem photovoltaics,6,7 photovoltaics in space,8 building-integrated photovoltaics,9,10 wearable electronics11 and the Internet of Things (IoT).11,12 Recently, flex-PSCs have shown great progress, with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) surpassing 22%.13 However, record-breaking flex-PSCs are made by spin-coating with a small active area below 1 cm2 and under a N2 atmosphere. The performance of these solar cells decreases when deposited on a large scale due to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) resistivity and decreased uniformity of the film. For instance, PCE decreased from 20% to 15.5% for flex-PSCs upon transferring small spin-coated cells to 100 cm2 blade-coated modules fabricated in a controlled environment.14 Moving to ambient air fabrication further decreases the performance, as humidity adversely affects the morphology of the perovskite film by changing the growth kinetics.15 Hence, the deposition of a large-area flexible perovskite layer in ambient air is one of the main challenges in flex-PSCs.
Among large-area deposition techniques, blade coating is one of the most widely used solution-processing methods for PSCs.16,17 It is a high-throughput deposition method that requires simple equipment and is transferrable to roll-to-roll fabrication with slight modifications. Blade coating of the perovskite layer in the ambient environment is only possible by means of hot casting, gas quenching, vacuum extraction, or a combination of these methods to prevent moisture from spreading over the perovskite phase.18 Exposure of the intermediate phase (i.e., PbI2-DMSO-MAI) to moisture results in poor quality perovskite film.19 Yang et al. showed that dense and dark brown perovskite layers, blade coated at 15–25% RH from a DMF-based solvent system, turned into nonuniform films with a grayish color at 60–70% RH and PCE dropped from 10.44% to 0.35%.20 An effective strategy is the two-step deposition of perovskite films, which prevents the formation of the intermediate phase and allows the ambient deposition of the perovskite. Two-step deposition of the perovskite layer is a common technique for the spin coating method: first, the PbI2 layer is deposited on the substrate and converted to perovskite by a second deposition or immersion in organic halide salt solutions. Controlling the crystallization dynamics is simpler than in one-step deposition.21 In this way, a high-quality PbI2 film is formed, and the conversion to perovskite occurs thereafter. Matteocci et al. fabricated large-area PSCs under ambient conditions through the coating of the blade of PbI2 layers and immersion in MAI solution in isopropyl alcohol (IPA).22 They added MAI to the PbI2 ink to slow down crystallization and avoid formation of large lead iodide grains. Castriotta et al. showed that it is also possible to blade coat a double-cation perovskite using two-step deposition in ambient air with the help of gas quenching and additive engineering.23 The effect of moisture was alleviated by adding FAI and CsI to the PbI2 ink. In addition, the double cation perovskites endured 1000 hours of light soaking.
A major obstacle to the large-area processing of PSCs is the usage of toxic solvents. For example, studies on the perovskite layer blade coating use primarily toxic solvent systems that include dimethylformamide (DMF),22,24–26 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME)23,27,28 or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).23,27,28 Although solution processability is the main advantage of PSCs and reduces fabrication complexity and cost, with current solvent systems, transferring the process to a large area becomes an environmental issue. The use of toxic solvents for mass production releases a massive volume of solvents and pollutes the atmosphere. The most commonly used solvent in PSCs is dimethyl formamide (DMF) the use of which as a solvent the European Union will prohibit from 2023.29 Therefore, the elimination of toxic solvents is essential for the commercialization of PSCs. Among the common polar aprotic perovskite solvents, DMSO has the lowest environmental and human health impact based on a life cycle assessment (LCA).30 Moreover, the wastewater of DMSO can be efficiently managed since it can be decomposed to methanesulfonic acid using ultraviolet or ozone-based oxidation.31
DMSO shows good solubility and coordination capability towards perovskite precursor salts. The term donor number, which refers to the tendency of solvents to donate electron pairs, was introduced by Gutmann.32 Hamill et al. noticed a correlation between the donor number and coordinating ability of perovskite precursors for solvents and the solubility of perovskite precursor salt(s).33 Consequently, a higher DN results in better solubility and more control over the crystallization. Thus, low DN solvents such as acetonitrile (ACN), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) can only dissolve lead halides in the presence of organic salts.34 DMSO has the highest DN among these solvents, and it can dissolve PbI2 in the presence of different halide salts and can be used to deposit compositions of MA-based, FA-based, Cs-based, and mixed cation perovskite.35,36 DMSO is mainly used as a co-solvent in perovskite deposition and the development of efficient PSCs based on DMSO is encouraged.37 However, DMSO is a nonvolatile solvent with a high boiling point (189 °C) and a low vapor pressure (0.6 mm Hg at 25 °C). External force to extract the solvent from the wet film is required to deposit the perovskite layer from a perovskite precursor solution based on a DMSO containing solvent system.
Studies that deposited perovskite in ambient air, using a mixture of DMSO with DMF or GBL, used relatively high blading temperature (>150 °C) to overcome the adverse effect of humidity during perovskite phase formation.38–40 In addition, high temperature is required to prevent DMSO from being trapped in the perovskite film.41 Therefore, there is lack of low-temperature processed DMSO-based blade coated perovskite layer in the literature.
In this work, we used a two-step blade coating method to deposit a perovskite layer at low temperature in ambient air using DMSO only as the solvent for the first step and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for the second step. Low-temperature deposition of DMSO-based ink is introduced for the first time to apply on flexible substrates. Previous studies on single-step deposition of DMSO-based perovskite solution using the blade coating technique required high substrate temperature (150 °C) or high annealing temperature (170 °C).36,42 In addition, the previously reported devices were fabricated under a nitrogen atmosphere. With the help of additive engineering and optimized drying of the wet film with high-flow gas quenching, we obtained a smooth film of Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3−xBrx perovskite on a large coating area (94 cm2). We fabricated flexible perovskite solar cells with a planar N-I-P device architecture of PET/ITO/SnO2/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3−xBrx/PTAA/Au in ambient air with a relative humidity of 30–35%. Solar cells are blade coated on large substrates (5 × 7 cm2) but measured on a small scale with a 0.09 cm2 active area, and the champion device achieved 14.08% PCE.

Solar cell fabrication

Fig. 1 depicts the fabrication procedures of flexible perovskite solar cells in ambient air (T ≈ 20–25 °C and RH ≈ 30–35%). To use flexible substrates for the sheet-to-sheet blade coating method, 7 × 5 cm2 pieces of PET/ITO are laminated on glass. Lamination prevents the substrate from dangling during deposition and helps to fix the substrate on the blade coater. 1 cm from the top and bottom of the substrates is excluded due to the non-uniformity of the beginning and end of the blade-coated film. An aqueous colloidal dispersion of tin oxide nanoparticles (15% wt, Alfa Aesar) was diluted to 2.5% wt and blade coated on a PET/ITO substrate with a speed of 15 mm s−1 followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 minutes. 1 M PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 solution in DMSO with 0.25 mg ml−1 LP additive was blade coated with a 5 mm s−1 speed and 40 μm gap height of the blade. The hotplate temperature was set to 60 °C while an air-knife with a flow rate of 120 L min−1 with a 90° incident angle and distance of 50 mm was blowing from the top. The air-knife nozzle has a length of 25 cm and can be seen in Fig. S1b.† Then FAI/FABr 30 mg/7.5 mg in IPA is coated with a speed of 2 mm s−1 and a hotplate temperature of 60 °C followed by IR treatment using two Helios Quartz IR lamps for 2 minutes. The orange film turned dark brown after annealing at 130 °C for 45 minutes. The PTAA layer (12 mg ml−1 in toluene) was spin coated at 1500 rpm for 35 s. 5 μL of TBP and 10 μL of Li-TFSI salt (170 μm ml−1 in ACN) were added to the PTAA ink. An Au electrode with 100 nm thickness was deposited by thermal evaporation. The substrates were cut into four 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 substrates (each hosting four cells).

Modules fabrication
Modules were manufactured on 7 × 7 cm2 and 13 × 13 cm2 substrates by blade coating of all layers (ETL, absorber and HTL). The mini modules had a total module area of 5 × 5 cm2 consisting of 7 cells with a cell width of 5 mm and a width of 0.3 mm for interconnections. The total active area was 18.55 cm2, excluding the dead area. The larger modules layout consisted of 17 series connected cells with a height of 9.7 cm and a width of 0.5 cm, for a total active and aperture area of 82.45 cm2 and 94.09 cm2 (9.7 × 9.7 cm2) respectively. 13 × 13 cm2 substrates were secured to the blade coater plate using a vacuum holder. The ETL and perovskite were deposited as mentioned in the previous section. PTAA (12 mg ml−1 in toluene) was blade coated at a 40 mm s−1 speed while the blading gap was set to 100 μm. P1–P2–P3 laser ablations43 were obtained through a UV Nd:YVO4 laser beam (355 nm wavelength, 2 μm spot size); more specifically, P1: 1.35 μJ pulse energy, 1600 pulses per mm; P2: 0.35 μJ pulse energy, 350 pulses per mm; P3: 0.5 μJ pulse energy, 250 pulses per mm.
Characterization
All solar cells were deposited over a large area (7 × 5 cm2) and measured under standard AM1.5 conditions after cutting to a small area (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) using a class A solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000) masked with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2. A Si reference cell (RR226-O, RERA Solutions) was used for calibration of the sun simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a measurement system from Arkeo–Cicci research s.r.l. The scanning electron microscopy images of thin films were captured using a TESCAN MIRA microscope. Optical images were obtained using an Olympus Lext OLS 3100 confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy provides a topographic map by transforming a series of optical sections taken from the surface that can be used to measure surface roughness.44 Surface roughness measurement from this technique is proved to be comparable to stylus instruments.45 Gwyddion software was used to calculate surface roughness from confocal microscopy results.46 A Rigaku SmartLab SE was used to measure X-ray diffraction patterns.
Results and discussion

Table 1 summarizes the boiling point, Gutmann's donor number (DN), and environment, health, and safety (EHS) scores of common solvents for the perovskite layer. The EHS scores were adopted from the CHEM21 study on a scale of 1 to 10 and a three-color code (green, yellow, and red).47 The safety score mainly reflects the flammability of the solvents, the environment score is related to environmental issues, and the health scores reflect the occupation hazard, which is crucial for production lines. It is obvious from Table 1 that DMF, NMP, and 2-ME fail the health criteria and are classified as hazardous solvents. The non-hazardous solvents on the list are DMSO, ACN, and GBL but the last two have some limitations. ACN is not toxic, but the additives and cosolvents that are normally used with it are considered toxic. Most studies address the solubility issue of ACN by adding methylamine gas which is hazardous and flammable.47 On the other hand, GBL has high environmental impacts and a high boiling point above 200 °C which would be inconvenient for flexible substrates.48 Hence, among the commonly used solvents, DMSO is an attractive option due to its ability to dissolve perovskite precursors (high DN) and its low environmental and toxicological concerns. Therefore, we selected DMSO as the main solvent for the perovskite layer. The perovskite layer was deposited by a two-step blade coating method that utilized a DMSO-only solvent system for the first step and IPA for the second step. First, PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 is deposited and then it is converted to the perovskite phase by blade coating of an FAI/FABr solution in IPA. Adding a non-stoichiometric amount of organic halide salts to the first step solution has been shown to enhance the porosity of the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 layer which helps in the conversion process to the perovskite phase during the second step.22 Furthermore, because of the low solubility of cesium halide salts in IPA, CsI was added to the first step. The presence of CsI and FAI in PbI2 ink affects the crystal growth of the layer as nucleation agents and facilitates heterogeneous nucleation by reducing the free energy barrier.49 Furthermore, the PbI2-FAI-CsI complex may assist in the complete conversion of the film to the perovskite phase during the second step.50

To adopt an all-DMSO solvent system for the first step of deposition, we attempted to optimize the solvent evaporation rate by tuning substrate temperature and gas quenching parameters. The evaporation rate alters the degree of supersaturation which affects the nucleation rate.18,25 We observed that depending on the blading parameters, ink drying was divided into four categories of ambient drying, incomplete drying, optimized drying, and overdrying, which are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, blade coating at room temperature without an air knife for gas quenching resulted in the formation of a wet film that required more than 3 minutes to naturally dry after blade coating. Slow evaporation of the DMSO leads to low supersaturation and allows crystals to grow faster than the nucleation rate. In this situation, the supersaturation is not enough for an appropriate nucleation rate. The long drying time allowed the formation of a noncontinuous film and large needle-like PbI2 crystals visible to the naked eye. We name this ambient drying because there is no external force to drive solvent evaporation and the drying occurs in the ambient environment.

The opposite extreme of ambient drying is the over-drying situation. Upon increasing the supersaturation rate by hot casting (100 °C substrate temperature), or using a hot air knife (100 °C) or high-pressure air knife (flow rate of 150 L min−1), we observed phase separation in the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film with dark perovskite regions appearing occasionally on the yellow PbI2 film (Fig. S2b†). Although in the single-step perovskite deposition, a very high degree of supersaturation is beneficial and assists the direct conversion of the precursors to the perovskite phase,19 it normally requires high blading temperatures of around 150 °C to deposit high-quality perovskite films in ambient air38,39 which is not recommended for flexible substrates. Therefore, direct conversion of perovskite precursors under ambient conditions is not possible for flexible substrates. In the two-step method, CsI/FAI is present to retard the PbI2 crystallization. However, the high supersaturation in our PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 ink resulted in the reaction of CsI/FAI salts with lead iodide and the formation of the perovskite phase. After the second deposition step, this phase separation results in the formation of islands in the perovskite film.
A trade-off is observed when the substrate and air knife are kept at a temperature of 60 °C using a flow rate of 120 L min−1. The film is partially dried after blading and the drying is completed after approximately 30 s. Therefore, we name it incomplete drying. The mild temperature (60 °C) increased the nucleation rate and decreased the crystallization time, leading to smaller grains and a more uniform yellow film. However, due to incomplete drying after blading, the SEM image in Fig. 2 indicates a PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 layer with micron-scale voids that could be the result of a moisture attack.40 To prevent the incomplete drying of the film, we decreased the blading speed from 10 mm s−1 to 5 mm s−1. As a result, the total volume of air striking the wet film doubles without increasing the air pressure and without exceeding the supersaturation level that leads to overdrying. The wet film dried instantaneously after the blading/drying deposition steps. A smooth PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film is deposited without hot casting or hot gas quenching. Fig. S2b and c† illustrate the smoothness of the film compared to incomplete drying. We name this optimized drying because the drying step occurs after applying the airflow at optimized flow rates without exposing the wet film to the ambient moisture.
As is evident from the SEM images in Fig. S3,† the optimized drying of the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film is more uniform and the large voids disappeared. However, there are pores with 150–200 nm diameter. This porosity could be helpful in the conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite phase.
After the second deposition step (FAI/FABr), the yellow film turns dark orange and consequently dark brown after the annealing and a smooth perovskite layer is formed.

Fig. 3a shows the SEM images and 3D projection of the confocal microscopy of the perovskite film when the first layer is incompletely dried. Microscale voids remained after conversion to the perovskite layer, and some crystals are visible on top of the film suspected to be needle-like PbI2 crystals.
 Fig. 3  SEM and confocal 3D microscopy images of the perovskite layer deposited under the conditions of incomplete drying (a), optimized drying (b), and optimized drying + LP additive (c). 
Using optimized drying, as evident from the SEM images in Fig. S3,† the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film is more uniform, and the large voids shrink to a smaller size (150–200 nm). This porosity could be helpful in the conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite phase. However, Fig. 3b indicates that the pores remained even after conversion to the perovskite phase. We modified the crystallization of the perovskite by adding L-α-phosphatidylcholine (LP) to the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 ink. LP is a naturally occurring amphoteric zwitterionic surfactant derived from egg yolk, used as an additive in the single-step blade coating of the perovskite layer to reduce surface tension and passivate charge traps.36,58–61 We investigated the effect of this additive in two-step blade coating of the perovskite for the first time by adding this surfactant to the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 ink. The morphology of the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film remained unchanged upon addition of the LP as shown in Fig. S3a–c.† However, it improved the morphology, increased the grain size, and eliminated the voids after conversion to the perovskite phase (Fig. 3c). Most likely, the additive slows down the crystallization of the perovskite phase and facilitates the growth of crystals. Additionally, small needle-like crystals (PbI2) are not visible in the LP-added sample, suggesting that it helps to convert PbI2 to the perovskite phase in ambient air and improves film quality. LP did not alter the crystallization of the first step, and the voids remained identical. But after the second step and annealing, the voids in the LP containing the samples are removed. This is more visible in the SEM images which depict the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 layer (Fig. S4a–c†) and their corresponding perovskite layer (Fig. S4d–j†) w/o and with the LP additive. We measured the roughness of the perovskite film deposited in incomplete drying and optimized drying + LP additive by confocal microscopy. The root mean square (RMS) roughness decreased significantly in optimized drying compared to incomplete drying, dropping from 317.16 nm to 48.39 nm. The addition of LP enlarged the grain size as shown in Fig. 3c, and consequently the roughness increased to 62.91 nm.
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the PbI2-(FAI)0.3-(CsI)0.15 film after the first step and perovskite films after annealing are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. For each step, we took the XRD patterns of the incompletely dried, optimally dried, and optimally dried + LP additive films. According to Fig. 4a, the drying conditions influence phase formation and the crystallinity degree. In incomplete drying, the sharp peak at 12.7° indicates the presence of highly crystalline PbI2 and a δ-FAPI peak at 11.9° is observable since PbI2 is partially converted to the δ-FAPI perovskite phase due to FAI reaction with PbI2. After conversion to perovskite (Fig. 4b), a substantial amount of PbI2 and the δ-FAPI phase is still observed. However, in optimized drying, there is no evidence of crystalline FAPI formation in the first step and PbI2 is fully converted to the perovskite phase after annealing, as the 12.7° peak is eliminated. In the optimally dried film, PbI2 is less crystalline as indicated by the broader peak with a full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) of 0.945 compared to the sharp peak with that of 0.197 for incomplete drying. This implies that less crystalline PbI2 is more likely to convert to the perovskite phase. The addition of LP does not alter the XRD pattern of the first deposition step. However, after the second step of deposition and annealing, samples with LP additive show better crystallinity and more intense peaks of FAPI and CsPbI3. Furthermore, LP helped to eliminate the δ-FAPI peak at 11.9° and there is no evidence of other major peaks of δ-FAPI.62 The peaks of cubic FAPI and CsPbI3 at 13.9° and 13.2° are visible in the optimally dried perovskite, which proves the presence of the perovskite phase.

We fabricated flex-PSCs with the perovskite layer deposited via incomplete drying, incomplete drying using LP additive, and optimized drying using LP additive. Fig. 5a shows box plots comparing the photovoltaic parameters of these three groups. The incomplete drying cells show the lowest fill factor due to the poor morphology and high surface roughness of the perovskite layer, and a maximum efficiency of 9.78% has been obtained. By using the optimized drying technique and the LP additive, the PCE of the champion device was increased to 14.08%. The summary of data is shown in Table S2†. The J–V characteristic and the IPCE spectrum of the optimized cell are demonstrated in Fig. 5b and c. The mechanical stability of flex-PSCs has been investigated by bending the complete device using a cylinder with a radius of 18 mm. The results of this test based on four devices are presented in Fig. 5d. On average, the devices maintained 95% performance after 200 bending cycles and 70% after 1000 bending cycles.

(d) The repetitive mechanical bending test of the flex-PSC device and the schematic of device architecture. (e) The distribution of PCE on a 5 × 5 cm2 substrate after cutting and measuring four small-area cells obtained by optimized drying + LP. 
As mentioned in the Experimental section, we used 7 × 5 cm2 substrates for deposition and then cut them to measure small cells. The distribution of the performance of solar cells on one substrate is illustrated in Fig. 5e. This proves the uniformly distributed performance of the cells across the bladed substrates. To further investigate the distribution of cells performance across 7 × 5 cm2 substrates, the mean value of normalized PCE for incomplete drying cells and optimized drying + LP cells is mapped in Fig. S6a and b.† It is apparent that in the case of incomplete drying the pattern is arbitrary since the drying occurs in an uncontrolled way. However, in the optimized drying case, a gradient in the performance on the edges of samples is visible which could be due to lamination defects. Next, we also deposited the PTAA layer by blade coating using the same solution used for spin coating. The best all-blade cell obtained delivered 13.93% PCE with an average PCE of 10.5% across one 7 × 5 cm2 substrate (Fig. S5†).
We transferred the devices to modules with 5 × 5 cm2 and 9.7 × 9.7 cm2 active area to demonstrate the scalability of the optimized fabrication process. Due to the increase in the substrate size and, correspondingly, the meniscus bar, an adjustment of the precursor solution volume to form the meniscus between the blade and the substrate for all three layers (SnO2, perovskite, and PTAA) is done. The all-bladed flexible modules with a 25 cm2 and 94 cm2 active area deposited by a sustainable solvent system showed 6.58% and 3.92% PCE respectively as shown in Fig. 6a and b. This is the largest all-bladed flexible module reported so far, to the best of our knowledge.

Conclusion
In conclusion, all-blade coated flexible perovskite solar cells and modules were fabricated using a sustainable solvent system to avoid the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, NMP, and 2-ME. We showed that high temperature is not required to deposit the perovskite in a DMSO-based solvent in ambient air. A double-cation perovskite was deposited on a PET substrate by adding nonstoichiometric amounts of FAI/CsI to the PbI2 solution and optimized drying of the blade-coated film using moderate substrate temperature and an air knife. The δ-FAPI phase was eliminated and morphology improved by additive engineering. The champion devices achieved 14.08% PCE and the process was proven to be transferable to larger substrates up to 13 × 13 cm2. We reported for the first time fully-blade coated flex-PSMs with a 9.7 × 9.7 cm2 (94 cm2) aperture area. Further efforts should be focused on improving the performance of these ambient-air fabricated modules.
