First published on 14th June 2011AbstractThis chapter reviews the literature reported in 2010 on the homogeneous reactions of inorganic species in solution, excluding the reactions of p-block elements.
Highlights
A detailed theoretical study of the pathway for water oxidation in synthetic ruthenium-based catalysts has been presented. Structural and energetics data for the single-centre catalyst system were used as the basis for considering a representative Ru-dimer which was designed to form O2via coupling between the two centres. The acid-base mechanism presented suggests a new set of strategies for the rational design of multicentre catalysts.1
1 Introduction
While the main focus is on the varied mechanistic studies of redox, substitution, hydrolysis, solvent effects, atom transfers and oxidative additions/reductive eliminations of coordination complexes and organometallic complexes of transition and main group metals, those kinetic and mechanistic studies of inorganic and biologically relevant compounds have been included, as well as several interesting reports on techniques.
Mechanistic studies of heterogeneous or solid state processes are not covered in this review. Neither are electrochemical, fluxional, photochemical processes, nor redox reactions involving organic substrates or organic reactions of the p-block elements. Homogeneous catalysis of organic reactions are included, where the mechanistic role of the transition metal centre is highlighted. Computational methods continue to make a tremendous contribution to the field of inorganic reaction mechanisms. These studies have appeared along with experimental studies, or by themselves, and highlight the power of theoretical methods in both a predictive and confirmatory vein.
2 Redox reactions
Outer- and inner-sphere electron transfer
The kinetics of the hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative degradation of the azo dye Orange II in aqueous carbonate buffered solution were studied for the oxo-bridged [Mn2III/IV(μ-O)2(bpy)4](ClO4)3 complex and its mononuclear analogue [MnII(bpy)2Cl2] as catalysts. The key feature of both catalysts is a two-electron oxidation from a Mn(II) precursor to a high-valent MnIVO intermediate, which represents the potential oxidizing species.2
In weakly acidic media ([H+], 0.01–0.06 M), 2-mercaptoethanol, thioglycolic acid and L-cysteine reduce the superoxo ligand of {μ-amido-μ-superoxo-bis-[tetra-amminecobalt(III)]}4+ to its corresponding hydroperoxo complex, {μ-amido-μ-hydroperoxo-bis[tetraamminecobalt(III)]}3+. During this act, 2-mercaptoethanol and thioglycolic acid are quantitatively oxidized to their respective disulfides. The reactivity of the thiols decrease in the order: L-cysteine > thioglycolic acid > 2-mercaptoethanol.3
The oxidation of D-glucuronic acid by excess CrVI yields D-glucaric acid (Glucar) and CrIII as final products. The redox reaction involves the formation of intermediate CrIV and CrV species, with CrVI and CrV reacting with Glucur at comparable rates. The experimental results indicated that CrIV is a very reactive intermediate, and does not accumulate in the reaction. Kinetic studies show that the redox reaction between D-glucuronic acid and CrVI proceeds through a mechanism combining one- and two-electron pathways.4
The first example of a ruthenium complex, [RuIII(edta)(H2O)]− (edta = ethylenediaminetetraacetate), that catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxyurea in the presence of H2O2 has been reported. The complex mimics the action of peroxidase or catalase and its action may have implications on the applicability of Ru anti-cancer drugs.5
The oxidation of [Co(edta)]2− by [IrCl6]2− proceeds by both inner-sphere and outer-sphere electron-transfer pathways. In the presence of added [Co(en)3]3+, the outer-sphere pathway is enhanced. When optically active [Co(en)3]3+ is used the [Co(edta)]− formed is optically active reflecting a 1.5% ΔΛ selectivity. It is proposed that the selectivity arises from preferential formation and reactivity of the ΔΛ ion pair, {[Co(edta)]2−,[Co(en)3]3+}.6
A synthetic iron(II) complex, [FeII(TMC)]2+, that reacts with stoichiometric H2O2 to generate an oxoiron(IV) complex, [FeIV(O)(TMC)(CH3CN)]2+, in nearly quantitative yield, has been identified for the first time. A sizeable H/D KIE of 3.7 was observed, highlighting the importance of proton transfer in the cleavage reaction. The observed stoichiometry and KIE is best rationalized by invoking heterolytic O–O bond cleavage of an iron-bound H2O2 that is facilitated by an acid-base catalyst (2,6-lutidene), as shown in Scheme 1.7

Iridium half-sandwich complexes Cp*Ir(N–C)X, [Cp*Ir–(N–N)X]X, and [CpIr(N–N)X]X (Cp = η5-C5H5; Cp* = η5-C5Me5; N–C = 2-phenylpyridine-κC,N; N–N = 2,2′-dipyridyl, 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,2′-bipyrimidine, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) are highly active catalyst precursors for the homogeneous oxidation of water to dioxygen. Kinetic studies with cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate as primary oxidant show that oxygen evolution is rapid and continues over many hours. In addition, [Cp*Ir(H2O)3]SO4 and [(Cp*Ir)2(μ-OH)3]OH show even higher turnover frequencies. DFT calculations show that in the key O–O bond formation step, water attacks the oxo ligand of the active species by losing one proton.8
The reaction between NO and L1(H2O)Rh2+ (L1 = meso-Me6-1,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane) generates a stable, sky blue L1(H2O)RhNO2+, a {RhNO}8 complex.9 The complex is oxidized rapidly and reversibly with Ru(bpy)33+, kf = (1.9 ± 0.1) × 105 M−1 s−1, to an intermediate believed to be L1(H2O)RhNO3+. This unprecedented {RhNO}7 species has a lifetime of about 90 s at room temperature at pH 0. The reverse reaction between L1(H2O)RhNO3+ and Ru(bpy)32+ has kr = (1.5 ± 0.4) × 106 M−1 s−1. The rate equation is shown in eqn (1). d[Ru(bpy)32+]/dt = kf[Ru(bpy)33+][L1(H2O)RhNO2+] − kr[Ru(bpy)32+][L1(H2O)RhNO3+](1)
Atom transfer
The self-exchange rate constant for hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) for the couples CraqOO2+/CraqOOH2+ and L2(H2O)RhOO2+/L2(H2O)RhOOH2+ (L2=cyclam) was estimated to be 101±1 M−1 s−1. The use of this value in the simplified Marcus equation for the CraqO2+/CraqOOH2+ cross reaction provided an upper limit kCrO,CrOH ≤ 10(−2±1) M−1 s−1 for CraqO2+/CraqOH2+ self-exchange. Cross reactions with organic oxygen-centred radicals were fast and adopted a modified Russell mechanism.10 The CraqOO2+/(CH3)3C(O)OO˙ reaction has a rate constant of greater than 108 M−1 s−1.
A monooxomolybdenum(VI) model complex for the oxidized active site in the DMSOR family of molybdoenzymes has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The compound was obtained from the desoxomolybdenum(IV) derivative by clean oxygen-atom transfer from an amine N-oxide in a manner similar to that observed in the enzyme. A combination of electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies, coupled with the results of bonding and excited-state calculations, has been used to provide strong support for a highly covalent Mo(dxy)–S(dithiolene) π*-bonding interaction in the molybdenum(VI) complex. It is proposed that the resulting Mo–S covalency facilitates electron-transfer regeneration of the catalytically competent DMSOR MoIV active site.11
The oxygen atom transfer reactivity of the dioxo-Mo(VI) complex, TpiPrMoO2(OPh) (TpiPr = hydrotris(3-isopropylpyrazolyl)borate), with a range of tertiary phosphines (PMe3, PMe2Ph, PEt3, PnBu3, PEt2Ph, PEtPh2, and PMePh2) has been investigated. The first step in all the reactions is a nucleophilic attack by the phosphine on an oxo ligand. The second step of the reaction, that is the exchange of the coordinated phosphine oxide by acetonitrile, is first order in starting complex and acetonitrile. The reaction occurs via a dissociative interchange (Id) or associative interchange (Ia) mechanism, depending on the nature of the phosphine oxide. The oxo-Mo(V) phosphoryl complex is more stable than the acetonitrile analogue, whereas the oxo-Mo(IV) acetonitrile complex is more stable than the phosphoryl analogue. The higher stability of the Mo(V) phosphoryl complex may explain the phosphate inhibition of sulfite oxidase. The reaction rate follows a linear correlation with the phosphine cone angle suggesting steric influences play a significant role in this system.12
Thermolysis of a green solution of (nacnac)V(N3)(Ntol2) (tol = toluene) in C6D6 at 100 °C for 12 h caused transformation to a new diamagnetic and orange species assigned as (nacnac)V ≡ N(Ntol2). A negatively large ΔS‡ value suggests a very early transition state with respect to (nacnac)V ≡ N(Ntol2) and a highly ordered system in which the azide ligand plausibly forms a three- or four-membered ring with the V(III) centre, via chelation at the β or γ positions. The reaction is 16 times slower in THF than in toluene.13
Several optically active Nb(salan) complexes were synthesized, and their oxidation catalysis was examined. A dimeric μ-oxo Nb(salan) complex (Fig. 1) that was prepared from Nb(OiPr)5 and a salan ligand was found to catalyze the asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols using a urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct as an oxidant with good enantioselectivity. This is the first example of the highly enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols using aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. The μ-oxo dimer dissociates into a monomeric species prior to epoxidation.14

A series of molybdenum oxo imido and bisimido complexes of the type MoO(N-t-Bu)L2] and [Mo(N-t-Bu)2L2] that contain L = β-etiminate ligands were synthesized. KL = KArNC(CH3)CHC(CH3)O (Ar = phenyl, 2-tolyl, 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). OAT properties to triphenylphosphine were investigated, and the findings show the steric effect of the t-Bu imido group to be dominating.15
The roles of the distinct electronic structures of the {Fe(NO)2}9 and {Fe(NO)2}10 dinitrosyliron complexes (DNICs) in modulating nitrite binding modes and nitrite activation pathways has been investigated via nitrosylation of [PPN]2[(ONO)2Fe(η2-ONO)2] [PPN = bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium] which yields the nitrite-containing {Fe(NO)}7 mononitrosyliron complex (MNIC) [PPN]2[(NO)Fe-(ONO)3(η2-ONO)], which when reacted with 1 equiv of PPh3 triggers OAT of the chelating nitrito ligand under mild conditions to yield the {Fe(NO)2}9 dinitrosyliron complex (DNIC) [PPN][(ONO)2Fe(NO)2]. Both electronic structure [{FeIII(NO−)}7, S = 3/2] and redox-active ligands are required for the transformation of {Fe(NO)}7 MNICs into {Fe(NO)2}9 DNICs. This result may signify that nitrite-containing DNICs may act as NO/NO2− storage/transport species to maintain cellular NO homeostasis in biological systems.16
Remarkable 2e− deoxygenation reactions of stable nitroxyl radicals, including TEMPO˙, by five-coordinate oxorhenium(V) anions, to afford dioxorhenium(VII) complexes and aminyl radical-derived products, have been reported. Kinetics studies suggest a multistep reaction mechanism, where, by analogy to the first step of O2 activation, redox-active ligands are proposed to facilitate 1e− trapping of oxygen radicals. The OAT reaction with [ReV(O)(cat)2]− ([cat]2− = 1,2-catecholate) is displayed in Scheme 2.17

Kinetic parameters for the reduction of copper(II) complexes in atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) in the presence of free-radical diazo initiator (AIBN) were determined using both experimental and kinetic modelling techniques. The rate constant of decomposition of AIBN (kdc) in various solvents was determined at 60 °C using UV-vis spectroscopy. Rate constants of deactivation (kd,AIBN) of [CuII(L)Cl][Cl] (L = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine), tris[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-ethyl]amine), N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) and [CuII(bpy)2Cl][Cl] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) complexes by radicals generated from the decomposition of AIBN were measured using the TEMPO-trapping method in a competitive clock reaction. The respective second order rate constants are 5.4, 53, 7.3 and 11 (×107 M−1 s−1).18
C–H bond activation by metal oxo complexes, which involve HAT have been reviewed.19 The importance of precursor and successor complex formation in the bimolecular proton-electron transfer reaction of TEMPOH to [CoIII(Hbim)-(H2bim)2]2+ (H2bim = 2,2′-biimidazoline) has been reported. The energetics of formation of these encounter complexes are the dominant contributors to the overall energetics: ΔG°′ for the proton-electron transfer step is only −0.3 ± 0.9 kcal mol−1. Thus, formation of the precursor and successor complexes can be a significant component of the thermochemistry for intermolecular proton-electron transfer, particularly in the low-driving-force regime, and should be included in quantitative analyses.20
Reactions of the ruthenium(II) hydride complexes, Ru(terpy)(bpy)H+, Ru(terpy)(dmb)H+ and Ru(η6-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)+ with the hydride acceptors, CO2, CO, CH2O and H3O+, have been examined in aqueous media at 25 °C (terpy = 2,2′;6′,2″-terpyridine, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine). The reactions of two Ru(II) hydride complexes with CO2 in water are best described as insertion: formation of the C–H bond of formate precedes formation of the Ru–O bond in the product formate complex.21
The electrophilic (salen)ruthenium(VI) nitrido species, [RuVI(N)(L)(MeOH)](PF6) [L = N,N′-bis(salicylidene)-o-cyclohexyldiamine dianion], undergoes stepwise reactions with RSH to produce the first examples of sulfilamido and sulfilamine complexes of ruthenium. The reaction of the RuVI complex with a stoichiometric amount of RSH in CH3CN gives the corresponding (salen)ruthenium(IV) sulfilamido species [RuIV{N(H)SR}(L)(NCCH3)](PF6) (R = tBu, Ph), whereas reaction with 3 equiv. of PhSH gives a (salen)ruthenium(III) ammine species [RuIII(NH3)(L)–(NCCH3)](PF6) (Scheme 3). The direct reduction to [RuIII(NH3)(L)(CH3CN)]+ with PhSH represents a new method for the conversion of a nitrido species to an ammine.22

A review on the theory of coupled electron and proton transfer reactions includes concerted PCET reactions, sequential proton and electron transfer, concerted vs. sequential PCET, and some applications.23 PCET in cytochrome oxidase has also been reviewed.24
Complexes of the type CuII(L)X2 (L = H33m, D-H33m, p-NO2-H33m; X = CF3SO3−, ClO4−) have been employed to provide the mechanistic details of a mild aromatic C–H activation effected by a copper(II) centre ligated in a triazamacrocylic ligand. Equimolar amounts of a CuIII-aryl species and CuI species are produced. At low temperatures, a three-centre, three electron C–H⋯CuII interaction, is identified by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. Kinetic studies strongly implicate a rate-limiting PCET as the key C–H activation step.25
Titanocene(III) aqua complexes have been used to efficiently reduce carbon-centred radicals of diverse nature. The success of this transformation is based on the excellent binding capabilities of water toward titanocene(III) complexes, and a low activation energy for the HAT step. The observed reactivity was explained in the framework of an unprecedented HAT reaction involving water.26
The synthesis of a niobium cyclopropyl complex, TpMe2NbMe(c-C3H5)(MeCCMe) has been reported. Thermal loss of methane from this compound generates an intermediate that is capable of activating both aliphatic and aromatic C–H bonds. The active intermediate is an η2-cyclopropene complex formed via β-hydrogen abstraction. C–H activation chemistry of this type is favoured by the strain in the C3 ring which prevents the decomposition of the key intermediate via loss of cyclopropene. A detailed analysis of the reaction kinetics, along with a survey of the computed free energy surface, suggests that two unsaturated intermediates are unselective and react with aliphatic or aromatic C–H bonds with approximately equal rates.27
It was revealed by quantum mechanical analysis that carbonyl reduction of aldehydes and ketones by the imine-based reductant cis-[OsIII(tpy)(Cl)(NHCHCH3) (NSAr)] (Ar = C6H5, 4-MeC6H4 and 3,5-Me2C6H3), which is accessible by reduction of the analogous nitrile, occurs by hydride-proton transfer (HPT) involving both the imine and sulfilimido ligands. Water or alcohol significantly lowers the barrier for proton shuttling between ligands, in carbonyl reduction. The –N(H)SAr group activates the carbonyl group through hydrogen bonding while the –NC(H)CH3 ligand delivers the hydride.28
Dipicolinate vanadium(V) alkoxide complexes (dipic)VV(O)(OR) (OR = isopropoxide, n-butanoxide, cyclobutanoxide and α-tert-butylbenzylalkoxide) react with pyridine to afford vanadium(IV) and 0.5 equiv. of an aldehyde or ketone product. The evidence points to a bimolecular reaction with pyridine to generate a vanadium(III) intermediate. The involvement of base in the elementary alcohol oxidation step observed for the dipicolinate system is an unprecedented mechanism for vanadium-mediated alcohol oxidation and suggests new ways to tune reactivity and selectivity of vanadium catalysts.29
3 Solvent effects
The complex [Ru(Mebimpy)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ [Mebimpy = 2,6-bis(1-methyl benzimi-dazol-2-yl)pyridine, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine] and its 4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy derivative on oxide electrodes are water oxidation catalysts in propylene carbonate and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) to which water has been added as a limiting reagent. The rate of water oxidation is greatly enhanced relative to that with water as the solvent and occurs by a pathway that is first-order in H2O; an additional pathway that is first-order in acetate appears when TFE is used as the solvent. The results demonstrate that catalytic water oxidation can occur in nonaqueous environments with greatly enhanced rates and by a new pathway involving direct O-atom addition to H2O. There may be important implications in these results for alternate solar-fuel strategies in nonaqueous environments.30
A new dinuclear nickel(II) complex, [Ni2(LH2)(H2O)2(OH)(NO3)](NO3)3, of an “end-off” compartmental ligand 2,6-bis(N-ethylpiperazine-iminomethyl)-4-methyl-phenolato, exhibits versatile catalytic activities of biological significance, viz. catecholase, phosphatase, and DNA cleavage activities. The catecholase activity of the complex observed is very dependent on the nature of the solvent. In acetonitrile medium, the complex is inactive to exhibit catecholase activity, but in methanol, it catalyzes not only the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol but also tetrachlorocatechol, which is very difficult to oxidize under aerobic conditions.31
The interconversion of the closed- and open-tethered RuIIη6-arene complexes [RuII(η6:η1-C6H5(C6H4)NH2)(en)]Cl2 (1) and [RuII(η6-C6H5(C6H4)NH2)Cl(en)]Cl (2), respectively, (en = 1,2-diaminoethane) (Fig. 1), has been investigated in different solvents. Complex 1 opens in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) by solvent-induced dissociation of the NH2 group of the pendant arm. In methanol, however, equilibrium between 1 and 2 is reached after 12 h when both species coexist in solution in a ratio of 2∶1 (open/closed). In water (pH 7), complete ring closure of 2 to 1 at 298 K occurs in less than 2 h (Fig. 2).32

The kinetics of decomposition of the copper(II) complexes of a series of phosphate mono-, di-, and tri-esters with a common leaving group (2′-(2-phenoxy)-1,10-phenanthroline), was studied in methanol at 25 °C. The Cu(II) complexes of 2-[2′-phenanthrolyl]phenylphosphate (3), 2-[2′-phenanthrolyl]phenyl methyl phosphate (4), and 2-[2′-phenanthrolyl]phenyldimethyl phosphate (5) are tightly bound (Kd ≤ 3 × 10−7 M). They show similar ΔH‡ terms but differ in the ΔS‡ terms, which vary from 18 to 2.3 to −7.4 cal mol−1 K−1 passing from the mono- to di- to tri-ester. Detailed analyses of the kinetics indicate that the reactions involve spontaneous solvent-mediated cleavage of the Cu(II)-coordinated phosphate dianion [3b]0 and phosphate diester monoanion [4b]+.33
4 Hydrolysis/aquation
The ruthenium(II) dithiolate complex (bmmp-TASN)RuPPh3 (6) reacts with O2 under limiting conditions to yield isolable sulfur oxygenated derivatives as a function of reaction time. Rapid addition of O2 yields the thiolato/sulfinato complex (bmmp-O2-TASN)RuPPh3 (7). Steric interactions between the remaining thiolate and PPh3explains the slow, second oxygenation step, to give the sulfenato/sulfinato derivative (bmmp-O3-TASN)RuPPh3 (8). Further oxygenation to produce the bis-sulfinato complex (bmmp-O4-TASN)RuPPh3 (9) is further hindered by the PPh3 and occurs only on longer time scales. Stoichiometric hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetamide by 7 and 8 is observed in mixed acetonitrile, methanol, PIPES buffer (pH = 7.0) mixtures. Complex 9 degrades in the presence of water.34
Two new isostructural mononuclear [Ln(L)(NO3)(H2O)3](NO3)2 complexes, with Ln = Tb and Eu, display high activity in the hydrolysis of the substrate 2,4-bis-(dinitrophenyl)phosphate. These complexes displayed catalytic behaviour similar to that of the mononuclear gadolinium complex [Gd(L)(NO3)(H2O)3](NO3)2 previously reported. The hydrolysis reaction occurs in two stages, with the second stage being independent of the complex concentration. Studies with a radical scavenger (dimethylsulfoxide) confirmed the hydrolytic action of the Tb and Eu complexes in the cleavage of DNA.35
New macrocyclic binuclear nickel(II) complexes synthesized from the bicompartmental mononuclear complex [3,3′-((1E,7E)-3,6-dioxa-2,7-diazaocta-1,7-diene-1,8-diyl)bis(3-formyl-5-methyl-2-diolato)nickel(II)] and various diamines (1,2-bis(aminooxy)ethane, 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,2-diaminobenzene, and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene) hydrolyse 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, with observed first order rate constant values in the range from 8.69 × 10−3 to 1.85 × 10−2 s−1. The complexes show good binding propensity to calf thymus DNA giving binding constant values in the range from 1.4 × 104 to 17.5 × 104 M−1.36
Dimethylphosphate was used as a model in the benchmarking of density functional theory functionals for the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. A total of 52 functionals were tested for four reaction paths, and a best basis set, based on time and accuracy, is proposed.37
5 Substitution
The spectroscopic and structural characteristics and the relative reactivity of several TpMsCu(olefin) (olefin = ethylene, 1-hexene, allyl ethyl ether (aee), cyclohexene and styrene) complexes bearing the bulky hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazolyl)borate ligand have been examined. Kinetic studies of the exchange of TpMsCu(aee) with 1-hexene at 0 °C in CD2Cl2 revealed the existence of a dissociative mechanism. The global equilibrium is shifted to the olefin with the less steric influence.38
The dissolution of [(CH3)N]2Na[MnN(CN)5]3·H2O in water results in the dissociation of the labile trans-CN− ligand to form [MnN(H2O)(CN)4]2−, which reacts rapidly with a number of mono- and bi-dentate nucleophiles such as n-methylpyridines and pyridine-2-carboxylate and quinoline-2-carboxylate. The kinetics of substitution using pyridine-2-carboxylate and pyridine-2(x-di)carboxylate-type ligands showed that the first step in the two-step reaction was too fast to be observed. The second, ring-closing step, involving cyanide substitution, was observed, and has positive values for the activation entropy, supporting a dissociative activation.39
The hydrogenation of the Ir(I) methyl complex, (PONOP)Ir(CH3) (PONOP = 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinito)pyridine yields a trans-dihydride species through a quite different mechanism involving proton-catalyzed H2 cleavage (b), a pathway that circumvents the intermediacy of the cis-dihydride isomer. (Scheme 4).40

The activation parameters and the rate constants of the water-exchange reactions of MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ (meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin) as cationic, MnIIITnHex-2-PyP5+ (meso-tetrakis(N-n-hexylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin) as sterically shielded cationic, and MnIIITSPP3− (meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin) as anionic manganese(III) porphyrins were determined from the temperature dependence of 17O NMR relaxation rates. The rate constants at 298 K were obtained as 4.12 × 106 s−1, 5.73 × 106 s−1, and 2.74 × 107 s−1, respectively. An interchange-dissociative mechanism (Id) was proposed for the cationic complexes (ΔS‡ ≈ 0 J mol−1 K−1) whereas a limiting dissociative mechanism (D) was proposed for MnIIITSPP3− complex (ΔS‡ = +79 J mol−1 K−1).41
The rate of displacement of the aqua ligands by three neutral nucleophiles (Nu) of different steric demands, namely thiourea, N,N′-dimethylthiourea and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylthiourea and an anionic nucleophile (I−) in complexes of the form [{Pt(H2O)}2(N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)–N(CH2)nN](CF3SO3)4, n = 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, was studied under pseudo first-order conditions as a function of concentration, temperature and pressure using stopped-flow techniques and UV-visible spectrophotometry. The pseudo first-order rate constants, kobs(1st/2nd), for the simultaneous substitution of the aqua ligands and the proposed subsequent dechelation of the pyridyl units, respectively, agreed well to the rate law in eqn (2). High negative activation entropies, negative volumes of activation and second-order kinetics for the displacement reactions all support an associative mode of activation.42 kobs(1st/2nd) = k2(1st/2nd)[Nu].(2)
6 Isomerisation
The meso-dithioxamide H-((R)-1-(1-phenyl)ethyl)-NSC-CSN-((S)-1-(1-phenyl)-ethyl)-H (H2-mesoDTO) bonds [(η6-p-cymene)chlorido-ruthenium(II)]+ or [(η3-allyl)-palladium(II)]+ fragment and provides the Cs symmetrical complexes [(η6-p-cymene)ClRu(H-mesoDTO κ-S,S Ru)] and [(η3-allyl)palladium(H-mesoDTO κ-S,S Pd)]. These complexes are pseudochiral, and each of them exists as a mixture of two symmetrical meso forms. [(η6-p-cymene)chlorido-ruthenium(II)]+ and [(η3-allyl)-palladium(II)]+ fragments have been joined by means of the binucleating meso-dithiooxamidate ligand in a κ-S,S Ru κ-N,N Pd coordination mode. The resulting Cs-symmetrical complex [(η6-p-cymene)ClRu(μ-mesoDTO κ-S,S Ru κ-N,N Pd)-Pd(η3-allyl)] possesses two pseudochiral metal centres, and is a mixture of four isomeric meso forms. In a chloroform solution all of these isomers interconvert in that both palladium and ruthenium invert their configurations. A mechanism of epimerization for both palladium and ruthenium is proposed.43
The phosphinito-bridged Pt(I) complex [(PHCy2)Pt(μ-PCy2){κ2P,O-μ-P(O)Cy2}-Pt(PHCy2)](Pt–Pt) reversibly adds H2 under ambient conditions, giving cis-[(H)(PHCy2)Pt1(μ-PCy2)(μ-H)Pt2(PHCy2){κPP(O)Cy2}](Pt–Pt), which slowly isomerizes spontaneously into the corresponding more stable isomer trans-[(PHCy2)(H)Pt(μ-PCy2)(μ-H)Pt(PHCy2){κP-P(O)Cy2}](Pt–Pt). The nonclassical dihydrogen complex [(PHCy2)(η2-H2)Pt(μ-PCy2)Pt(PHCy2){κP-P(O)Cy2}](Pt–Pt) is an intermediate in the dehydrogenation. The cis-trans isomerisation reaction occurs via an intramolecular mechanism which involves opening of the Pt–Pt bond of the hydrogen bridge followed by the rotation of the coordination plane of the Pt centre with the terminal hydride ligand.44
The reaction of 2 equiv. of the primary silane, SiH3Ph with [RhIr(CO)3(dppm)2] yields the bis(silylene)-bridged complexes, [RhIr(CO)2(μ-SiHPh)2(dppm)2] (dppm = 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane). The kinetic isomer of this bis(silylene)-bridged product has the phenyl substituent axial on one silylene unit and equatorial on the other, and in the presence of excess silane this rearranges to the thermodynamically preferred “axial–axial” isomer (Scheme 5). The added silane is incorporated before elimination of one of the original SiHPh groups.45

7 Rare earths
The new trinuclear gadolinium complex [Gd3L2(NO3)2(H2O)4]NO3·8H2O (10) with the unsymmetrical ligand 2-[N-bis-(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl]-4-methyl-6-[N-bis(2-hydroxy-2-oxoethyl)aminomethyl] phenol (H3L) is highly active in the hydrolysis of the substrate 2,4-bis(dinitrophenyl)phosphate (Km = 4.09 mM, Vmax = 2.68 × 10−2 mM s−1, and kcat = Vmax/[10] = 0.67 s−1). Complex 10 displays high efficiency in DNA hydrolytic cleavage (Km = 4.57 × 10−4 M, k′cat = 3.42 h−1, and k′cat/Km = 7.48 × 103 M−1 h−1).46 The terbium and europium analogues of (10) also displayed similar reactivity in the hydrolysis of 2,4-bis(dinitrophenyl)phosphate.47
Data from potentiometric titrations of Eu(CF3SO3)3 by Me4NOH in 80% v/v DMSO/water agree equally well with formation of two sets of hydroxo complexes: either Eu2OH5+ and Eu(OH)n3−n (n = 1–3) or Eu2OH5+, Eu2(OH)24+, Eu2(OH)5+ and Eu(OH)3. The second model, with predominantly binuclear complexes is supported. Kinetic studies of the cleavage of two model phosphodiesters by Eu(III) triflate in the same medium shows that reactive species are higher order hydroxo complexes Eu2(OH)5+ and Eu(OH)3.48
Yttrium carbenes were shown to effect regioselective ortho-C–H activation and sequential C–C and C–O bond formation reactions of aryl ketones to give iso-benzofurans and hydroxymethylbenzophenones. With MeCOPh, cyclotetramerization occurs giving a substituted cyclohexene. This demonstrates new rare earth carbene reactivity which complements existing Wittig-type reactivity. The proposed mechanism for the yttrium carbene promoted formation of the oxymethylbenzo-phenone and substituted iso-benzofuran complexes is shown in Scheme 6.49

8 Clusters
The novel hydride clusters, [M3S4H3((R,R)-Me-BPE)3]+ (M = Mo, W; (R,R)-Me-BPE = (+)-1,2-bis-(2R,5R)-2,5-(dimethylphospholan-1-yl)ethane) react with HCl in CH2Cl2 in a way similar to that previously observed for [W3S4H3(dmpe)]+ (dmpe = (1,2-(bis)dimethylphosphinoethane), three kinetically resolved steps being observed under acid excess and corresponding to the sequential substitution of the three hydride ligands by the anion of the acid. The nature of the transition metal does not modify to a great extent the kinetics of the process.50 [Mo3(FeCl)S4(dmpe)3Cl3] undergoes a number of Fe and Mo site specific ligand substitution reactions in acetonitrile solutions. In particular, PhS− coordination at the tetrahedral Fe site proceeds in a single resolved kinetic step whereas such substitutions at the Mo sites proceed more slowly. An acid excess hinders substitution reactions at both the Fe and Mo sites.51
The terminal chloride ligands of the [Re6S8Cl6]4− cluster have been substituted leading to the preparation of a new series of complexes, [Re6S8(PEt3)nCl6−n]4−n (n =1–4). The substitution chemistry of [Re6S8Cl6]4− was found to be similar to that of [Re6Q8]2+ containing terminal bromide and iodide ligands. The chloride ligand is considerably less labile. Isomerization between the cis and trans-isomers of [Re6S8(PEt3)2Cl4]2−, and between the fac- and mer-isomers of [Re6S8(PEt3)3Cl3]−, occurs at elevated temperatures. This is the first report of such an isomerization reaction involving these hexarhenium clusters.52
The reaction between HOs3(CO)8[μ-PhP(C6H4-μ2,η1)CH2PPh2] and excess CO proceeds rapidly in toluene to give HOs3(CO)9[μ-PhP(C6H4)CH2PPh2]. Reactions carried out at varying pressures of CO confirm that the rate is dependent on [CO]. The mechanism depicted in Scheme 7 was supported by kinetic analysis and DFT.53

9 Biologically-relevant systems
The range of reactions of peroxynitrite with heme proteins has been surveyed with particular attention to myoglobin and cytochrome c. These proteins are textbook paradigms for oxygen binding and electron transfer, respectively, and have been shown to have other important functions that involve NO and peroxynitrite.54 Also done, is an overview of the fundamental chemical properties of nitric oxide and nitrite ion in relation to the reactions with ferri- and ferro-heme models and proteins potentially relevant to the roles of these species in mammalian biology.55
9.1 DNA
The binding capacity, of a series of new cationic nickel and manganese metalloporphyrins, to bind in the minor groove of DNA was evaluated by binding competition experiments with manganese(III)-bis-aqua-meso-tetrakis(4-N-methyl-pyridiniumyl)porphyrin, Mn-TMPyP, a powerful artificial nuclease when associated with KHSO5. The four N-methylpyridiniumyl substituents on this porphyrin macrocycle are responsible for a strong binding affinity for the minor groove of AT-rich DNA. Data on the structural modifications that influence cationic porphyrin binding to DNA should be helpful in the design of new quadruplex selective agents based on porphyrins.56
The activation of DNA carbon-hydrogen bonds by metal complexes has been reviewed. Careful design of the ligand is necessary so that the metal complex is a good catalyst and a precise fit between the metal centre and DNA is achieved. The complex must interact with DNA in such a way that it is within reach of a C–H bond and that it can be activated at the site of its interaction with DNA.57
Four vanadium(III) complexes of the general formula [V(maltol)2(N–N)]ClO4, where N–N is 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy); 1,10-phenanthroline (phen); dipyrido[3,2-d:2′,3′-f]-quinoxaline (dpq), and dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (dppz), have been synthesized and characterized by IR, UV-visible, NMR spectroscopies, and electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS). The V(III) complexes of dpq and dppz ligands are more active than the bpy and phen complexes in cleaving plasmid DNA which also do not require any external reagents like ascorbate or hydrogen peroxide.58
The peptidyl antibiotic bacitracin (Bc) can bind divalent transition metal ions, including Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). Metal-free Bc does not bind DNA. Cu(II)–Bc binds and oxidatively cleaves DNA under reduction conditions in air. It also exhibited a significant oxidative activity toward catechol oxidation, showing enzyme-like saturation kinetics with kcat = 7.0 × 10−3 s−1 and kcat/Km = 2.1 M−1 s−1 aerobically and kcat = 0.38 s−1 and kcat/Km = 14.7 M−1 s−1 in the presence of 32 mM of H2O2. The proposed mechanism for catechol oxidation by Cu(II)–Bc through a mononuclear Cu(II) centre in the presence of O2 (steps A through F) or in the presence of H2O2 (steps A, B, and F) is shown in Scheme 8.59

Several mixed-ligand copper(I) complexes of cyclodiphosphazanes, [tBuNP-(NC4H8X)]2 (X = O, NMe), were synthesized by reacting the octanuclear copper(I) complexes [Cu8(μ2-I)8{[tBuNP(NC4H8X)]2}4] with various pyridyl ligands. Interaction of the metallomacrocyclic Cu8 complexes with pyridine, 2,2′-bipyridine, and 1,10-phenanthroline afforded the neutral dinuclear complexes [(C5H5N)4Cu2I2{[tBuNP(NC4H8X)]2}], [(2,2′-bpy)2Cu2I2{[tBuNP(NC4H8X)]2}], and [(1,10-phen)2Cu2I2{[tBuNP(NC4H8X)]2}] (X = O, NMe), respectively, in good yield. The results indicated that all of the copper complexes have in vitro antitumor activity against human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells, either similar to or better than that of cisplatin.60
Two copper(II) complexes, [CuL3Cl2] and [CuL4Cl2], and two copper(II)–platinum(II) heteronuclear complexes, [CuPtL3(DMSO)Cl4] and [CuPtL4(DMSO)Cl4], were synthesized using two bifunctional ligands, N-[4-(2-pyridylmethoxy)benzyl]-N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (L3) and N-[3-(2-pyridylmethoxy)benzyl]-N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (L4). The heteronuclear complexes exhibit an enhanced DNA binding ability and a superior cleavage activity because of the preferential affinity of platinum(II) for DNA.61
9.2 Porphyrins
Reaction of hydrido[5,10,15,20-tetrakis(p-tolyl)porphyrinato]iridium(III) (Ir(ttp)H) with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) at room temperature in benzene gave a 90% yield of the unsupported iridium(II) porphyrin dimer, IrII2(ttp)2. Kinetic measurements revealed that the oxidation followed overall second-order kinetics: rate = k[Ir(ttp)H][TEMPO], k (25 °C) = 6.65 × 10−4 M−1 s−1. The entropy of activation (ΔS‡ = −25.3 ± 2.5 cal mol−1 K−1) and the kinetic isotope effect of 7.2 supported a bimolecular associative mechanism in the rate-determining HAT from Ir(ttp)H to TEMPO.62
The gas-phase oxygen-atom transfer chemistry of meso-tetrakis(pentafluoro-phenyl) porphyrin (TPFPP) chromium complexes, as well as some other tetradentate macrocyclic ligands, was explored in order to determine the structure of the species formed in solution. [(TPFPP)CrIII]+ forms adducts with a variety of neutral donors, but O-atom transfer is only observed for NO2. [(TPFPP)CrVO]+ species are much less reactive than the Fe and Mn analogues.63
The reaction of cysteine (CysSH) with aqueous nitrite and the water-soluble ferriheme models FeIII(TPPS) (TPPS = meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato) or FeIII(TMPS) (TMPS = meso-tetra-(sulfonatomesityl)porphyrinato) at pH 5.8 and 7.4 forms cysteine sulfenic acid CysS(O)H and the respective ferrous nitrosyl complex FeII(Por)(NO) (Por = TPPS or TMPS). Analogous oxygen atom transfers (OAT) were seen when glutathione (GSH) was used as the substrate. Preliminary kinetic studies are consistent with rate-limiting OAT from a ferric nitro complex FeIII(Por)(NO2−) to CysSH.64
In coordinating solvent DMSO, the superoxide adduct of heme-FeII species, {(Porph)Fe–O2}−, (H2Porph = 52-N-(4-aza-18-crown-6)methyl-54,104,154,204-tetra-t-butyl-56-methyl-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin) exists in the isomeric forms, FeIIIperoxo and FeII-superoxo, which are not resonance structures, but two discrete isomers. The existence of heme-FeIIsuperoxo species explains the finding that upon release of coordinated (su)peroxide from {(Porph)Fe–O2}− a corresponding iron(II) complex remains in solution.65
9.3 Metalloenzymes
Double-mixing stopped-flow spectroscopy was used to investigate the reactions of a panel of substrates of varying C–H bond strength with the oxidants Hperoxo and Q, two intermediate species that are generated sequentially during the reaction of reduced soluble methane monooxygenase with O2. It was shown for the first time that an inverse trend exists between the rate constant of reaction with Hperoxo and the C–H bond strength for those substrates in which C–H bond activation is rate-determining. The reaction of Hperoxo with acetonitrile appears to proceed by a distinct mechanism (Scheme 9) in which a cyanomethide anionic intermediate is generated, bolstering the argument that Hperoxo is an electrophilic oxidant that operates via two-electron transfer chemistry.66

The interplay of the acid-base and redox properties of the diiron hydrogenase model complexes, [Fe2[(SCH2)2NR](CO)3(dppv)(PMe3)]+ (R = H, CH2C6H5; dppv = cis-1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethylene)) has been investigated. The indication is that addition of H2 followed by deprotonation are endothermic for the mixed valence (FeIIFeI) state and exothermic for the diferrous (FeIIFeII) state. The results suggest that PCET pathways should be considered for H2 activation by the [FeFe]-hydrogenases.67
Spectroscopic, equilibrium thermodynamic, and kinetic measurements have established the pH dependence of the Cld-catalyzed decomposition of ClO2− and set forth a structurally consistent model that rationalizes the modest influence of pH on catalytic activity. Enzyme kinetic measurements reveal that the turnover number (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) are maximized in the presence of the cationic, guanidinium form of the distal Arg183 (maximum kcat = 2.0 (±0.6) × 105 s−1, kcat/KM = 3.2 (±0.4) × 107 M−1 s−1, pH 5.2, 4 °C). The cationic state of the Arg exerts the most influence on catalytic efficiency via its polarizing influence, which stabilizes the transition state of the putative rate-limiting step. This occurs along the Cl–O bond scission coordinate to yield Compound I/ClO− as intermediates (Scheme 10).68

Modelling of the structure, reactivity and selectivity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes by QM/MM calculations has been reviewed.69 A forum article focussed on the area of biochemical and biologically inspired inorganic chemistry dealing with nitric oxide [nitrogen monoxide, ˙NO(g)] and its biological roles and reactions, has been presented.70
10 Organometallics
The ability of compounds CpCrII(nacnacAr,Ar) (nacnac = [ArNC(CH3)]2CH−, Ar = Dipp, Xyl) to catalyze the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of vinyl acetate has been explored using methyl 2-chloropropionate as initiator. The general principles that interplay between atom transfer and metal–carbon bond formation for the radical trapping in controlled radical polymerization, thermodynamically favoured formation of the organometallic dormant species. The metal–carbon bond formation is greatly preferred from the kinetic standpoint.71
Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP level of theory were carried out to elucidate the initial step of the catalytic cycle of the aminohydroxylation of olefins with osmium reagents. Various reaction pathways of the model systems (O)2Os(NH)2 (Os1) and (O)2Os(NH)-cyclo-(–NHCH2CH2HN–) (Os2) and two of their isomers, (HO–)(O)Os(NH)(N) (Os1′) and (O)Os(–OH)(N)-cyclo-(–NHCH2CH2HN–) (Os2′), with ethylene have been considered. Os1, Os1′, and Os2 prefer a [3+2] cycloaddition kinetically and thermodynamically, whereas Os2′ is predicted to favour a [1+2] pathway due to kinetic reasons. Thermodynamically, Os2′ prefers a consecutive rearrangement after the [1+2] addition. The isomer Os1′ is lower in energy than Os1, but the kinetically and thermodynamically most favourable reaction is the [3+2]NH,NH ethylene addition to the latter isomer, which takes place without a barrier.72
In the interaction of an amido/bis(phosphine)-supported (PNP)Ir fragment with a series of linear and cyclic ethers, DFT investigation has revealed the factors dictating reaction direction toward either an iridium-supported carbene, which involves initial C–H activation, followed by a cascading autocatalytic rearrangement, or a vinyl ether adduct, involving the same initial C–H activation followed by β-hydrogen elimination to form a weakly bound Ir(III) dihydrido vinyl ether. An interesting systematic error present in the DFT analysis of reactions where steric environment alters considerably within a reaction has been highlighted.73
A range of paramagnetic Cr(III) monohydrocarbyl complexes CpCr[(ArNCMe)2–CH](R) (Ar = orthodisubstituted aryl; R = primary alkyl, trimethylsilylmethyl, benzyl, phenyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl) were synthesized to investigate how varying the steric and electronic properties of the R group affected their propensity for Cr–R bond homolysis. Modifying the neopentyl ligand from the previously reported CpCr[(XylNCMe)2CH](CH2CMe3) decreases its reactivity. Replacing one Me group with a H diminishes the rate of alkyl dissociation, while use of the CH2SiMe3 group effectively shuts down the thermal homolysis reaction at room temp. The homolysis rates increased when bulkier Dpp and Dep substituents were used on the β-diketiminate ligands, consistent with the importance of steric repulsion in weakening the Cr(III)–R bonds.74
Iron(II) tris(2-pyridylthio)methanido (11) containing an Fe–C bond, reacts with protic acid to generate iron(II) bis(2-pyridylthio)carbene. The carbene complex is converted to an iron(II) complex of the 1-[bis(2-pyridylthio)methyl]pyridine-2-thione ligand (12) upon treatment with a base, a process which is reversed upon acidification (Fig. 3). This is the first report of a novel rearrangement of tris(2-pyridylthio) methanido to 1-[bis(2-pyridylthio)methyl]pyridine-2-thione in the iron(II) complex and highlights the importance of this ligand in organoiron chemistry.75

The first systematic mechanism study of C–F reductive elimination from a transition metal complex has been described. Mechanistic evaluation of C–F bond formation from three different Pd(IV) fluoride complexes suggest that reductive elimination occurs from cationic Pd(IV) fluoride complexes via a dissociative mechanism. The ancillary pyridyl-sulfonamide ligand plays a crucial role for C–F reductive elimination, likely due to a κ3 coordination mode, in which an oxygen atom of the sulfonyl group coordinates to Pd. The pyridyl-sulfonamide can support Pd(IV) and has the appropriate geometry and electronic structure to induce reductive elimination (Scheme 11).76

The efficient and selective organozirconium(IV)-mediated, intermolecular hydrothiolation of terminal alkynes by aliphatic, benzylic, and aromatic thiols using CGCZrMe2 (CGC = Me2SiCp″NCMe3, Cp″ = C5Me4), Cp*ZrBn3 (Cp* = C5Me5, Bn = benzyl), Cp*ZrCl2NMe2, Cp*2ZrMe2, and Zr(NMe2)4 precatalysts has been reported. The CGCZrMe2-mediated reaction between 1-pentanethiol and 1-hexyne is first-order in [catalyst], first-order in [alkyne], and also first-order in thiol at lower concentrations but transitions to zero-order at [thiol] > 0.3 M. Deuterium labelling of the alkyne yields kH/kD = 1.3(0.1). ΔS‡ = −20.9(2.5) e.u. for [alkyne] = [thiol] = 0.2 M, consistent with turnover-limiting alkyne insertion into the Zr–SR bond.77
11 Main group metal complexes
The complexes of composition fac-[(η6-C6H6)Ru(L)][PF6][X] (X = PF6 or Cl), formed by reacting 2-MeSC6H4CHNCH2CH2E-C6H4-4–R and 2-MeSC6H4CH2–NHCH2CH2E–C6H4-4–R (where E = S or Se, R = H; E = Te, R = OMe) with [{(η6-C6H6)RuCl(μ-Cl)}2] and NH4PF6, have been found to be efficient catalysts for catalytic oxidation of alcohols with N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, tBuOOH, NaOCl, and NaIO4 and transfer hydrogenation reaction of ketones with 2-propanol. The oxidation appears to occur through Ru(IV)O-containing species and hydrogen transfer through a classical mechanism involving Ru–H formation. The catalytic efficiency for both processes follows the order Te > Se > S.78
Aluminium has been established as a highly active metal toward the hydro-amination/-hydrazination of carbodiimides. The commercially available [Al(NMe2)3]2 dimer is active in transformations that occur at temperatures above 75 °C, whereas monomeric species such as the guanidinate-supported dimethyl Al show increased catalytic activity at low reaction temperatures. Al-aminoguanidinate proved to be catalytically active and is proposed to play an active role in the reaction mechanism.79
A systematic investigation into the Lewis base catalyzed, asymmetric, intramolecular selenoetherification of olefins has been described. These studies show that the 2-nitrophenyl group attached to the selenium atom significantly attenuates the racemisation of seleniranium ions, a critical challenge for the development of this process. A variety of achiral Lewis bases catalyze the intramolecular selenoetherification of alkenes using N-(2-nitrophenylselenenyl)-succinimide as the electrophile along with a Brønsted acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of ionic Lewis base-selenium(II) adducts.80
12 Techniques
The first time-resolved soft X-ray spectroscopy of electron and spin dynamics in solvated molecules has been reported.81 Electrospray ionization in concert with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry has been used to characterize and observe reactivity of the ionic species [(TPFPP)CrIII]+ and [(TPFPP)CrVO]+.63 Multifrequency (X-, Ka- and Q-band) and multitechnique (continuous-wave, electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE)) electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to investigate the cluster of Human mitoNEET in its paramagnetic reduced [Fe2+Fe3+] state.82
