Corresponding innovative methodologies to improve the ionic conductivity of ISEs are introduced. Then, structural/compositional characteristics and chemical/electrochemical behaviors occurring at solid–solid sur-/interfaces are systematically discussed. Practical strategies to address these sur-/interfacial issues, including regulation in humid air, cathode (anode)/ISEs, and grain boundaries are highlighted. Finally, comprehensive suggestions for an in-depth understanding and manipulation of the sur-/interfaces, and a meaningful perspective on future research directions in ISE-based ASLBs are provided. The present review gives constructive insights into solid–solid sur-/interfacial phenomena in the smart design of ISEs for advanced ASLBs, and will make research more efficient and provide fundamental understandings to allow for tremendous advances in ASLBs in the future.
1. Introduction
Driven by the urgent motivation to transform our style of transportation, from fossil fuel-based vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (PEVs), enormous efforts have been devoted to achieving better lithium-ion batteries with a higher specific energy density, longer cycle life, and improved safety.1,2 However, contemporary lithium-ion batteries, typically composed of lithiated transition metal cathodes and graphite anodes, are greatly restricted by safety-related concerns during cell charge/discharge because of their flammable liquid organic electrolytes.3,4 Furthermore, the limited electrochemical window of organic electrolytes makes compatibility with newly developed high-potential cathode materials difficult, which tremendously impedes a huge increase in the practical energy densities of Li-ion batteries.5,6 Currently, the practical energy density of lithium-ion batteries is still restricted to ∼100–350 W h kg−1, which hardly satisfies the increasing consumer demands for advanced technologies and applications.7,8 In a word, the intrinsic properties of organic liquid electrolytes, such as high toxicity, narrow window of chemical stability, and low thermal stability are inevitable disadvantages that greatly affect their broad application. As is well known, a substantial improvement in energy/power density of lithium-ion batteries can be achieved with Li-metal anodes paired with Li-containing or non-Li-containing cathodes (sulfur and air/O2), due to them having the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential.9,10 However, numerous studies have also suggested that the formation and propagation of Li dendrites on the electrode/electrolyte interfaces in liquid organic electrolyte systems results in short circuiting, which will lead to a rapid fading in capacity and a short cycling capability.11
Most recently, a variety of innovative technologies enabled by solid-state electrolytes (SEs), especially inorganic solid-state electrolytes (ISEs), have emerged uninterruptedly, ranging from dye-sensitized solar cells,12 solid oxide fuel cells,13 supercapacitors,14,15 smart windows,16 sensors,17 micro-batteries for on-chip power,18,19 to all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASLBs) for HEVs and PEVs.20 In stark contrast to liquid organic electrolytes, these ISEs can offer certain unique merits: (i) the most prominent one is the increase in safety due to the intrinsic properties of ISEs, such as nonflammability, noncorrosiveness and nonvolatility. (ii) Owing to the outstanding thermal stability of ISEs, ASLBs can be operated over a wider temperature range than current commercial lithium-ion batteries. Typically, an Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3-based ASLB exhibits superior electrochemical properties between −30 and 100 °C.21 (iii) Certain kinds of ISEs are not sensitive to moisture, leading to their good chemical stability even when exposed to air for a long period of time. Liang and coworkers recently developed a new Li-ion conductor, Li3.833Sn0.833As0.166S4, which shows a promisingly high Li+ conductivity of 1.39 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature (RT) and superior chemical stability when processed under air and/or moisture.22 In addition, NASICON-type ISEs, such as LiZr2(PO4)3, have also been demonstrated to be currently the most stable under ambient atmosphere, and even in contact with moisture.23,24 Consequently, the process of manufacturing ASLBs based on these ISEs when using carbonaceous materials as the anode does not necessarily require the protection of an inert atmosphere, resulting in a reduction in production cost to a certain extent. (iv) Some ISEs, with a metallic lithium anode and a high-voltage cathode for batteries, significantly enhance the energy density.25 For instance, a thin-film battery with high-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as the cathode, lithium metal as the anode, and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) as the ISE, presents an operating voltage of as high as ∼4.8 V and shows an outstanding cycling performance with 90% capacity retention after 10000 cycles.26 (v) Certain kinds of ISEs in specific cases, in a thin-film battery rather than a bulk battery, can effectively prevent Li dendrite growth.27 For instance, thin-film batteries with an Li-metal negative electrode and ISEs (e.g., LiPON) are able to avoid dendrite penetration over extended cycling.26,28 However, the underlying reasons for this difference between bulk and thin-film batteries are not well understood. In particular, it has been demonstrated that an effective approach to suppressing lithium dendrites is to introduce an interfacial “solid electrolyte interface (SEI)”-like layer, either self-formed or deliberately inserted between the Li metal and the ISEs.29 Additionally, the electrode concentration polarization generated at high current densities and parasitic chemical side reactions occurring on electrode/electrolyte interfaces can be significantly suppressed due to ISEs using lithium ions as a single carrier. As a result, the power density of the full devices is strikingly improved. All in all, the smart substitution of the liquid organic electrolytes currently used in lithium-ion batteries by ISEs can lead to greatly increased safety, improved energy/power density, enhanced thermal stability, diminished flammability and reduced cost.
The main goal in the further advancement of ASLBs is to achieve both superior cyclic stability and safety properties, while maintaining similar or even higher power/energy densities in comparison with traditional lithium-ion batteries. However, this is primarily limited by several challenges faced by ISEs. The most pronounced issue is to ensure a high ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 or much higher at RT, which plays an essential role in determining the electrochemical performance of ASLBs, but is scarce in the huge family of ISEs. In addition to the ionic conductivity of ISEs, another substantial issue is how to fabricate favorable solid–solid interfaces between the solid electrode and ISEs, where three aspects should be comprehensively considered: the wetting properties of the solid materials, solid–solid interfacial stability and the transport speed of ions across the interface.30 Therefore, enormous research efforts should be devoted towards exploring, designing and developing ISEs with high ionic conductivity, good chemical stability, a wide electrochemical window, high mechanical strength, and other desirable properties (Fig. 1a). Enabled by this design, cathode material candidates can be significantly extended from Li-containing oxides to many other materials, such as promising sulfides and air. It is strongly believed that employment of ISEs could be a fundamental solution to overcoming the shuttle effect of polysulfides in Li–sulfur (Li–S) batteries by inhibiting the polysulfides in the cathode side, and settling the issues associated with the degradation of electrodes in Li–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries in an ambient atmosphere.31–33 In a word, the increasing advances in ISEs could pave the way for next-generation Li metal-based batteries, including all-solid-state Li-ion, Li–S, and Li–O2 batteries with large energy densities and high safety, as shown in Fig. 1b.

Firstly, an overview of ISEs and their conducting mechanisms are briefly discussed in Section 2. Then, the current status, fundamental properties and up-to-date findings on ISEs are presented and discussed in detail in Section 3. Corresponding effective methodologies/strategies to enhance the ionic conductivities of ISEs are comprehensively introduced. Then, new insights into the origin of interfacial evolution are put forward, and the associated sur-/interfacial regulations, including cathode|ISEs and metallic lithium|ISEs, together with efficient approaches, especially nanotechnologies, to cope with these challenges are highlighted and presented in Section 4. Finally, we provide our significant perspective on the future development of ISEs in ASLBs.
2. Overview of ISEs and ionic transport mechanisms
2.1 A brief history of ISEs
Distinct from the coupled transport of both cations and anions in conventional liquid electrolytes, SEs are indeed a kind of fast ion conductor material with a transference number of unity (only Li ions can migrate). The morphologies and thicknesses of ISEs can be readily controlled by atomic layer deposition (ALD),34–37 thermal evaporation, electron beam evaporation,38 magnetron sputtering,39,40 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),41,42 extrusion molding, spray drying43 and spark plasma sintering.44 To design desirable ISEs for advanced ASLBs, several key factors, including ionic conductivity, chemical stability, the electrochemical window, mechanical strength, environmental friendliness and low cost, should be systematically taken into account.
After the pioneering work on LiPON as a thin-film solid electrolyte reported by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1990s,45–47 ISEs began to be widely used for rechargeable lithium batteries. After that, considerable research focused upon a wide variety of other ISEs, including Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-type, Li superionic conductor (LISICON)-type, garnet-type, anti-/perovskite-type, and sulfide-type. In particular, NASICON-type compounds were first reported in the 1960s48 and denoted as “NASICON” after the investigation of Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 synthesized through a high-temperature solid-state reaction method by Goodenough in 1976.49 In general, these compounds have an AM2(PO4)3 formula, in which the A site is occupied by Li, Na or K and the M site is occupied by Ge, Zr or Ti.50 In particular, the LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) system has been of wide interest. The ionic conductivity of LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) has been shown to be significantly improved by the substitution of Sn or Y. For instance, a bulk ionic conductivity of 1.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 can be achieved at 25 °C by Y3+ doping.44,51,52 In addition, the ionic conductivity can be further improved by partial substitution to form Li1+xMxTi2−x(PO4)3 (M = La, Al, Hf, Cr, Fe, In, Ga, or Sc),53–56 where the replacement by Al has been confirmed to be the most effective.24,57 Another important NASICON-type SE is the LiGe2(PO4)3 phase, which can be partially substituted by elemental Al to form the well-known Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 (LAGP) systems, due to the close ionic radius between them.32,58,59 Another type of promising ISE is a garnet-type material with the common formula A3B2Si3O12, in which the A and B cations have eight-fold and six-fold coordination, respectively. After the representative Li3M2Ln3O12 (M = W or Te) system was first reported in 1969,60 a range of garnet-type ISEs has been exploited. In particular, a chain of systematic studies have been conducted on systems such as Li7.06M3Y0.06Zr1.94O12 (M = La, Nb or Ta), Li5La3M2O12 (M = Nb or Ta), Li5.5La3M1.75B0.25O12 (M = Nb or Ta; B = In or Zr), Li6ALa2M2O12 (A = Ca, Sr or Ba; M = Nb or Ta) and cubic Li7La3Zr2O12.30,61–63 Typically, the outstanding lithium conductive properties for Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) have been realized by Te substitution, exhibiting a maximum Li+ conductivity of 1.02 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C.64 As for perovskite-type ISEs, a representative one reported in the 1990s was Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3 (LLTO) with a superhigh lithium-ion conductivity exceeding 10−3 S cm−1 at RT, thanks to the presence of numerous equivalent sites for lithium ions to occupy and so move freely.65 However, the unavoidable reduction of Ti4+ when in contact with lithium metal is mainly responsible for its unacceptable application in ASLBs. The pioneering investigation into sulfide-type ISEs can be dated back to the 1980s with the typical system of Li2S–SiS2.66,67 Afterwards, intensive studies, including research into Li/Na-based secondary batteries, have been carried out on this unique Li2S–SiS2-type ISE.68–70 Then, in 2001, a new crystalline material family was discovered in the Li2S–P2S5 system, and it featured the highest conductivity of 2.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.71–75 Of particular concern, the most serious drawback of sulfide-type ISEs is their chemical instability in air and the generation of harmful H2S gases.76 However, their stability can be significantly improved by the addition of metal oxides,77 and the ionic conductivity can be finely tuned by changing the fabrication process and the ratio of Li2S to P2S5.78,79 A typical example is high-temperature fabricated Li2S–P2S5 with a ratio of 70:30, rendering a high ionic conductivity of 1.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at RT, which is ten times greater than that obtained through cold-pressing, due to the decrease in grain boundary (GB) resistance.80,81 Recently, remarkable progress has been made in improving the properties of the ISEs mentioned above. An impressive advance was reported by Kanno and co-workers in 2016, when an exceptionally high conductivity of 25 mS cm−1 was achieved for Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3, as well as a high stability of ∼0 V versus Li metal for Li9.6P3S12.21 In addition, in order to overcome the poor wettability of ISEs, there has also been extensive focus on emerging solid polymer composite electrolytes using active ISEs as the main medium for ion conduction and polymers as the matrix.82,83 An up-to-date, yet comprehensive, summary of recent exciting advancements in ISEs will be reviewed in Section 3.
2.2 Mechanisms of ionic transport in ISEs
The ion-conducting mechanisms in crystalline ISEs are completely different from that in conventional liquid electrolytes; the ionic transport depends greatly on the concentration and distribution of defects, instead of the synchronous movement of both cations and anions in the liquid media.84,85 In general, there are many types of defects, such as point defects, line defects, planar defects, volume defects, and electron defects. Among these, point defects widely exist in ISEs, and play an important role in the ion-transport mechanism in a crystal.86,87 The correlative properties significantly determine the ionic transport mechanisms of ISEs. Representative point defects include Frenkel defects (i.e., vacancies accompanied by an interstitial ion) and Schottky defects (i.e., anion vacancies accompanied by a cation vacancy).86Fig. 2a exhibits a schematic diagram of different point defect models. The ionic diffusion type based on Frenkel and Schottky point defects can be categorized into three main types, as depicted in Fig. 2b. The simple divacancy mechanism relies on Schottky defects. which generate abundant vacancies available for direct ion hopping, and the relatively complicated diffusion generally includes the divacancy mechanism, interstitial mechanism, interstitial–substitutional exchange mechanism and the collective mechanism,88,89 among which the interstitial mechanism means that the interstitial ions diffuse through the Frenkel defects based on a knock-off-like type by continuously displacing Li ions in adjacent available sites.84 However, high ionic conductivities can be achieved with special structures without a high concentration of defects, and these normally consist of two sublattices: a crystalline framework composed of immobile ions and a sublattice of mobile species.30,90,91 In general, the body structure of ISEs consists of a coordination polyhedron and a spatial arrangement of mobile species, which can provide numerous vacancies distributed in the interior framework. Current understanding of the ionic diffusion pathway in ISEs depicts the ionic transport as the hopping of individual ions from one lattice site to another through inter-connected diffusion channels within the structural framework.87,92 By using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, Mo and co-workers demonstrated that mobile ions occupying high-energy sites can activate concerted migration with a reduced migration energy barrier. Notably, the mechanism can be observed not only in lithium garnet and NASICON-type ISEs but also in other ISEs, such as Li7P3S11, β-Li3PS4 (β-LPS), LISICON, and LixLa2/3−x/3TiO3 (LLTO) perovskite (Fig. 2c).87 Typically, as for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP), the concerted migration mode means that two Li ions at adjacent M1 and M2 sites migrate as a pair. Specifically, the Li+ on the M1 site hops into the unoccupied M2 site, and at the same time the Li+ on the M2 site hops into the next M1 site. The lithium diffusion pathway in an LATP superionic conductor was also investigated via7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy93–95 and negative nuclear density maps reconstructed by the maximum entropy method (MEM).57 As for the garnet-type ISEs, apart from employing AIMD calculations to study the ion dynamics,96,97 which demonstrated a concerted migration mechanism, high-resolution NMR combined with MEM further indicated that the conduction pathways in the garnet framework are restricted to diffusion through the tetrahedral sites of the interstitial space.98,99 More recent insights into the lithium-ion transport mechanism for the aforementioned ISEs will be introduced in detail in Section 3.

The ionic conductivity of crystalline ISEs is greatly limited by the capability of mobile species passing through periodic bottlenecks (namely migration or motional energy), and also depends on the numbers of interstitials, vacancies, and partial occupancies on lattice sites or interstices. Currently, the recognized ionic transport mechanisms in ISEs are based mainly on the Arrhenius model, and the corresponding ionic conductivity (σ) is represented as follows: (1)where the pre-exponential factor σ0 is related to the number of charge carriers, T is the temperature in Kelvin, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and EA is the activation energy of diffusion. Commonly, EA has a huge influence on the ionic conductivity, where a low EA value results in high ionic mobility and conductivity.20,100 In conventional hopping theory, the pre-exponential factor is governed by geometrical factors, the carrier densities of mobile ions, migration entropy, jump distance, the charge of the ions, and the jump frequency.101,102 In addition, AIMD simulations can be performed to directly quantify the pre-exponential factor.103,104 Recent experimental studies associate a decrease in EA with a decrease in the pre-exponential factor and a lower ionic conductivity, suggesting that the factor σ0 can provide more information about ionic conductivity.105,106
As for amorphous ISEs (i.e., superionic glasses), including LiPON, xLi2O–(1 − x)SiO2 and xLi2S–(1 − x)P2S5, they do not have a long-range ordered structure like that of crystalline ISEs, but still possess a short-range or medium-range ordered structure, which helps considerably in obtaining a high ionic conductivity.21,72,80 The ionic transport mechanism in amorphous ISEs can be described as follows: several ordered lattice ions existing in local body sites will initially arouse their neighboring sites, and then, the local sites together with the excited site will collectively diffuse at the macroscopic scale.66,107 Besides, the internal interaction between mobile ions and the structural skeleton, with plenty of point defects, plays a vital role in amorphous ISEs.50,108 The strategies for increasing the conductivity of such systems must focus on understanding and eliminating the source of this super-coupling, and on decreasing the glass transition temperature for the salt/solvent as far below ambient as possible.107 In summary, to achieve fast ionic conduction, three essential criteria must be achieved for this kind of structure: firstly, the number of equivalent (or nearly equivalent) sites available for the mobile ions to occupy should be much larger than the number of mobile species. Next, an uninterrupted diffusion pathway should be constructed by interconnected interstitial sites and vacancies, and the migration barrier energies between the available adjacent sites should be low enough for an ion to hop easily from one site to another. Finally, the body structure should offer steady framework ions and weak interaction forces between mobile ions and the framework so as to form a consecutive diffusion pathway.84,109,110 For more details, several reviews have lately comprehensively summarized the ion-transport mechanisms of ISEs20,30,84–86,100,109,111,112 or focused on a specific family, such as lanthanum titanates,113 garnets,114 or sulfides.115,116
3. Enhancing bulk lithium conductivity by structure tuning
To date, an enormous family of ISEs have been studied in detail and progressively developed owing to their unique advantages in comparison with liquid electrolytes. Although the high ionic conductivity of ISEs is a vital prerequisite for practical application in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, other significant aspects, such as ionic area-specific resistance, electronic area-specific resistance, ionic selectivity, electrochemical window, chemical compatibility with other components, thermal stability, mechanical properties, fabrication processes, cost, environmental friendliness and device integration should also be taken into consideration.117–119 An outline of typical ISEs along with their ionic conductivity at RT, advantages and disadvantages is given in Table 1. In this section, state-of-the-art ISEs with enhanced ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility by novel synthesis methods and nanotechnologies are summarized in detail, and several representative examples are further selected.

3.1 NASICON-type ISEs

3.1.1 Crystal structure. 
The framework of NASICON-type ISEs is commonly a rhombohedral unit cell (space group Rc), along with two MO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra sharing oxygen atoms to create lantern units, which are assembled to form a three-dimensional (3D) network structure (left hand side of Fig. 3a).20,120,121 In this framework, the lithium ions can occupy two different sites: the M1 sites which are 6-fold coordinated (octahedral symmetry) and located directly between two MO6 octahedra, and the M2 sites which are 8-fold coordinated and located between two columns of MO6 octahedra.122,123 The Li+ transport falls mainly back on hopping between these two sites, and the two sites partially taken up by lithium ions play a key role in increasing lithium-ion conductivity, particularly when vacancies are needed at the junction point of the transport pathways to offer an opportunity for 3D diffusion within the framework (right hand side of Fig. 3a).56,124,125

3.1.2 Strategies for improving the conductivity. 
Phase-pure LTP, LiGe2(PO4)3, LiHf2(PO4)3, and LiSn2(PO4)3, and so forth, have been widely studied, although their ionic conductivities are far from the ideal requirement (>10−4 S cm−1, or even >10−3 S cm−1 in the case of thick composite electrodes).126–130 In order to improve lithium-ion conductivity, one efficient strategy is to finely tune the size of the framework, where the bottleneck of lithium-ion transport to the transfer between the two sites recurs. For instance, Lang et al.131 systematically studied the direct impact of the replacement of Ti ions in the crystal LTP structure with isovalent and aliovalent cations (such as Al, Ge, or Mo) on the migration of Li vacancies (Fig. 3b). The size of the LiO6 octahedra has a strong influence upon the energy barrier for jumps of Li ions. The results revealed that the larger polyhedral volumes lead to lower activation energies, which is mainly caused by two factors: the size of the bottleneck in the diffusion path depends hugely on the polyhedron volume, so the larger the octahedron, the lower the energy barrier for Li ions. On the other hand, the vacant positions in large octahedra are more stable than occupied ones; accordingly, occupation of a vacancy is also supported.86,118,131 In particular, the formation of Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (LATP) and LAGP using elemental Al of a smaller ionic radius (0.53 Å) to substitute for segmental Ti or Ge is broadly deemed to be a valid route to produce a striking improvement in ionic conductivity.24,32,56–58,95,132–135 Commonly, compared to the LATP family, the LAGP system has a wider electrochemical window, which makes LAGP more compatible with high-voltage cathodes.136–138 In 2009, Kumar and co-workers132 demonstrated that the lithium oxide concentration is decisive in ionic conductivity, and even gives the conductivity of LAGP an unprecedented level of ∼10−2 S cm−1 at around RT. They attributed this superionic conductivity in these specimens to the space-charge-mediated effect resulting from the presence of the dielectric Li2O phase.106 However, most recently, Zeier et al.139 reported a simple aqueous-solution method to prepare LAGP, and the structural variation caused by the incorporation of Al3+, together with its influence on ionic transport, were investigated in detail. They explored the changing trend between RT conductivity (σRT) and EA as a function of the nominal Li+/Al3+ content (Fig. 3c) and showed that the structural fluctuation and triangular bottleneck in the transport channels do not determine the activation barrier in LAGP, whereas the correlated ion motion was functionalized. As for the LATP specimens, most researchers have intensively studied the relationship between the structure and conductivity in combination with cationic occupation changes with increasing amounts of Al substitution or a rise in temperature, confirming that the additional Li ions are used for charge compensation in LATP.124,140–142 From a theoretical point of view, the mechanism of Li-ion diffusion in the LATP system has also been extensively investigated via various techniques, such as first-principles studies, density functional theory (DFT), neutron diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and neutron and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD).86,93,131,141,143–150 So far, the most widely recognized viewpoint is that Li-ion transfer occurs through triangular oxygen planes formed between Ti/AlO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra.94,95
Another important NASICON-type solid electrolyte is LZP, which can form an insulated SEI film composed of Li3P and Li8ZrO6 when in contact with Li metal, with no redox reactions within the electrochemical window even up to 5.5 V (vs. Li/Li+).151–153 Nevertheless, Noda and co-workers154 employed DFT to calculate the electrochemical window of LZP, and used first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanism of Li-ion transport (Fig. 3d). Corresponding theoretical investigations showed an electrochemical window of 2.2–4.1 V (vs. Li/Li+) for LZP, and it was figured out that each Li+ migrates between 6b sites as it is pushed out or repelled by other Li ions around these 6b sites, which is actuated by the Frenkel-like defects. Also, the Li-ion conductivity of LZP was calculated to be approximately 5.0 × 10−6 S cm−1 at RT. This is in good agreement with the earliest reports for LZP with a low ionic conductivity of 10−6–10−5 S cm−1 at RT.155–158 As for ISEs, different synthesis approaches always led to an obvious disparity in the ionic conductivity, even with the same chemical constitution.23,159 Most recently, Goodenough and co-workers23 devised a novel strategy to prepare rhombohedral LZP (Fig. 3e) at RT using a spark plasma sintering technique, which resulted in enhanced bulk Li-ion conductivity (2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1) at RT, high electrochemical stability even up to 5.5 V (vs. Li/Li+), and small interfacial resistance for Li+ transfer. Apart from using suitable synthetic methods, significant enhancement in Li-ion conductivity (in the order of 10−4 S cm−1) can also be achieved by substituting other elements (Ti, Ca, Y, Sr, or Al) for the Zr in a typical LZP.44,52,160–163
Even if NASICON-type ISEs have stimulated an enormous wave of research by virtue of their high ionic conductivity (Fig. 3f),23,128,130,132,149,164,165 wide electrochemical window and high chemical stability when exposed to water and air, they still suffer from knotty issues associated with their chemical instabilities in contact with Li-metal.166,167 Thus, surface coating or the introduction of an interposed buffer layer168,169 in the ASLBs are necessary to passivate the solid–solid interfaces, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.

3.2 Garnet-type ISEs

3.2.1 Crystal structure and synthesis. 
Crystal structure. 
Garnet-type ISEs with a common chemical formula of A3B2(XO4)3 consist of three crystallographically distinct cation coordination environments, with the A, B, and X cations in eight, six, and four oxygen-coordinated cation sites, respectively, indexed as a face-centered cubic structure with Iad space group.63,91,170 Up to now, a variety of Li-containing garnet-type ISEs, such as Li5La3Ta2O12,171 Li5La3Nb2O12,62,172 Li7La3Sn2O12,173 Li5Nd3Sb2O12174 or Li3Ln3Te2O12,175 have been explored, with high conductivities ranging from 10−6 to 10−4 S cm−1 at RT. After numerous efforts from all over the world, a promising LLZO ISE with the highest ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemically stable window and superior environmental stability stands out remarkably from the others.84,176–178Fig. 4a illustrates the typical crystal structure of cubic-LLZO with a 3D framework structure, which is composed of dodecahedral LaO8 and octahedral ZrO6. The Li atoms occupy two types of crystallographic sites in the interstices of the framework, where the Li1 and Li2 sites are located in the tetrahedral 24d sites and distorted octahedral 96h sites, respectively. The resultant 3D network for convenient Li-ion migration in the structure can be mainly attributed to the shortened Li–Li distance and occupational disordering.179,180 The in-depth ion transport mechanism in the garnet-type structure has been intensively studied using both experimental and theoretical techniques.96,98,99,181–184 As for the migration pathway, Baral et al.185 proposed two potential routes: one is Li+ migration between two octahedral Li sites, and the other is the transfer of Li ions via the joint triangular faces, which can segregate the octahedral and tetrahedral polyhedra. To date, the latter, that is, Li-ion migration passing through tetrahedral sites, has been found to be well founded, and has been increasingly supported by more and more researchers.97,99,182,186,187 The lithium ions shuttling back and forth between the 24d sites and the 96h sites can be distinctly detected using high-resolution NMR, as depicted in Fig. 4b, which fully verifies the lithium-ion migration pathways of 24d–96h–48g–96h–24d. Meanwhile, the total conductivity is demonstrated to be greatly dependent on the lithium mobility at the 24d sites.99 Using high-temperature neutron diffraction, Goodenough also came up with the homologous mechanism of migration pathways, which are confined to diffusion through the tetrahedral sites of the interstitial space.98 Moreover, the utilization of spin-alignment echo (SAE) NMR, which is susceptible to ion hopping among electrically inequivalent sites, further proves that the diffusion of lithium ions occurs in both 24d and 96h sites (Fig. 4c).

Synthesis. 
In general, the garnet-type LLZO families are synthesized through conventional solid-state sintering methods requiring high temperatures and ultralong sintering times as preconditions.188–191 Apart from these demanding conditions, the LLZOs obtained using this method usually have low densities owing to the defects and pores formed during the sintering processes.192 Consequently, different kinds of strategies have been adopted to maximally optimize the properties of bulk LLZO: for example, spark plasma sintering (SPS),193,194 the field-assisted sintering technique (FAST),195 hot press sintering,196,197 the sol–gel (SG) method,198–200 and molten salt synthesis.201 In particular, Chan et al. reported a facile molten salt synthesis to prepare phase-pure LLZO with a eutectic mixture of LiCl–KCl at 900 °C, and the Li-ion conductivities of the obtained LLZO ranged from 0.23 to 0.37 mS cm−1.201 In fact, for the commercialization of ISEs, a problem to be urgently solved is how to successfully design and manufacture thin ISEs, which could be considerably boosted via advanced film-forming techniques. These techniques cover mainly chemical vapor deposition (CVD),41,42 radio frequency magnetron sputtering,39,40 the aerosol deposition method,38 atomic layer deposition (ALD),34 the SG spin coating method,199 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),202,203 and the electrospinning technique.204 In particular, Dasgupta and co-workers first explored a feasible ALD route to deposit pentenary Al-doped LLZO films with a low amount of impurities, a tunable composition, and self-limiting behavior (Fig. 4d).34 More significantly, the formation of cubic LLZO can be achieved at a temperature as low as 555 °C, significantly lower than that required for bulk processing.34 Interestingly, Cui et al. reported the simple synthesis of Al3+/Nb5+ co-doped cubic LLZO nanoparticles (NPs) and LLZO NP decorated carbon foam (LLZO@C) using the one-step Pechini SG method.205 The constructed LLZO@C based Li–S batteries can deliver a high specific capacity of >900 mA h g−1 at 37 °C, and even 1210 and 1556 mA h g−1 at 50 and 70 °C, respectively (Fig. 4e).205 However, numerous investigations indicate that the existing synthesis approaches have some undesirable drawbacks, including the inevitable loss of lithium due to the inevitable volatility during high-temperature processes, low efficiency, and unsatisfactory properties. Therefore, it will take further persistent efforts to develop low-temperature and rapid synthetic methodologies to fabricate LLZO with high bulk ionic conductivity and a stable cubic phase.


3.2.2 Phase transition and defect chemistry. 
Phase transition. 
garnet-type LLZO exists in two different phases: the cubic phase (space group Iad) formed at high temperatures and the tetragonal phase (space group I41/acd) formed at low temperatures.86,206 In general, tetragonal LLZO (t-LLZO) obtained at RT is more thermodynamically stable than cubic LLZO (c-LLZO).90,179 A series of studies have demonstrated that the distribution of Li ions transforms from ordered to disordered during this phase transition from tetragonal to cubic.206–214 The loop structure of the arrangement of lithium in both tetragonal and cubic LLZO is shown in Fig. 4f,210 where the cubic 24d sites are changed into fully occupied 8a sites and unoccupied 16e sites, and, also, the cubic 96h sites are transformed into two fully occupied 16f and 32g sites.207,210 This phase transition has a negligible impact on the crystal structure, but an intense influence on the Li-ion distribution and it lessens the ionic conductivity by two orders of magnitude. Thus, it is extremely critical to reveal and comprehend in-depth the mechanism of this phase transition. Just recently, Chen et al. intensively studied the essential origin of the phase transition and the stabilization of the cubic phase in LLZO, which they achieved via MD simulations and DFT-based calculations.210 The results clearly verified that lithium ions take on uniformly 3D migration in c-LLZO, while the lithium migration in t-LLZO predominantly traces the a and b directions. More importantly, they figured out that the limited migration in the c direction in t-LLZO can be greatly attributed to the blocking effect of 16f sites, which were found to be thermodynamically more stable than tetragonal 8a and 32g sites through DFT calculations. From a thermodynamics point of view, the phase transition in LLZO is actually an entropy-driven procedure,208,212 during which lithium ions spread over all sites.215,216 Additionally, the amount of lithium ions plays a key role in determining the phase-transition temperature, which will be sharply cut by reducing the amount of Li+. While, the decrease in Li-ion content and the disorder of the lithium sublattice can be achieved by supervalent doping,209,217 which motivates the transfer of Li+ distribution from ordered to disordered, and ultimately diminishes the free energy.207,218 Thus, clarification of the essence of the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic is highly significant for a better comprehension of how to optimize c-LLZO and design further garnet-type ISEs with much higher ionic conductivity.
Defect chemistry. 
Little attention has so far been paid to probing the defect chemistry associated with garnet-type ISEs. However, insights into the mechanism of defect chemistry are still of great importance to catch onto the nature of ionic transportation, and speculate about the performance of GBs and heterogeneous solid interfaces in advance. Typically, the consumption of ionic charge carriers (space charge layers),167,219 and the above-mentioned phase transformation due to cross migration of ions220 are primarily responsible for the expansion of sur-/interfacial resistance. Any of these origins stem closely from the defect structure of bulk c-LLZO, which refers to the concentration gradients, and interactions between ionic defects and charge carriers.211,221 Typically, Shirpour et al. observed and discussed the defect reactions related to temperature and oxygen activity. A defect diagram of c-LLZO was further constructed, as presented in Fig. 4g.211 Of particular significance is that the association effect between the lithium vacancies and holes at intermediate or low temperatures seem to be negligible and oxygen vacancies might be conducive to the Li-ion mobility by decreasing the number of electron holes, thus alleviating their correlation with lithium vacancies. In addition, the extensive existence of hybrid oxygen-ion conductive ISEs, while there is a scarcity of mixed Li+ conducting compounds, can also be explained by the inherent formation of lithium vacancy–hole pairs.211,222


3.2.3 Strategies for improving conductivity. 
Substitution. 
LLZO with an Li-stuffed garnet structure is considered to be a promising solid electrolyte due to its superior bulk ionic conductivity (10−3–10−4 S cm−1).176 However, its ionic conductivity is still insufficient in comparison with that of liquid electrolyte as a result of the negative influences from the crystal structure, high calcinating temperature and sur-/interfacial obstacles.223,224 Based on all of the experimental and theoretical studies with respect to LLZO, especially up-to-date investigations on phase transitions and defect chemistry, the most efficient way to achieve critical Li vacancy concentration, stabilize the cubic phase and tune the bulk ionic conductivity is to import lithium vacancies into a lithium sublattice by supervalent doping. To date, multiple doping cations have been intensively pursued, including Al3+,188,225–227 Ta5+,61,171,228–230 Ga3+,184,217,231–234 Te6+,64 Y3+,185 Ti4+,235 Ge4+,236 and Fe3+,237 as summarized in Table 2. Typically, Sakamoto et al. demonstrated the effect of Al and Li concentration on the formation of cubic phase LLZO, verifying that Li replaced by Al can give rise to extra charges to compensate for Li vacancies that play a vital role in determining phase stability. Moreover, it was found experimentally that at least 0.2–0.24 moles of Al substitution (0.4–0.48 Li vacancies) per formula unit in LLZO can stabilize the cubic phase.226 After that, Sakamoto et al.230 further confirmed the prediction that a critical doping level of 0.4–0.5 Li vacancies per LLZO formula is conclusively demanded to stabilize the cubic phase by selecting two Al-free LLZO compositions. In other words, the t-LLZO and c-LLZO compounds will exist simultaneously when a composition is insufficiently doped to stabilize the cubic polymorph. Recently, several innovative dual substitution strategies have been developed to enhance Li-ion mobility in LLZO.238–241 In particular, Buannic and co-workers proposed a dual substitution method by concurrently using Ga3+ and Sc3+ (Fig. 4h). Of the two, Ga3+ is introduced on the Li sites to stabilize the fast-conducting cubic phase, and Sc3+ is used to partially populate the Zr sites, which consequently increases the Li+ concentration by charge compensation. As a result, this unique Li local structure is of great benefit to improving the ionic conductivity (1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 300 K) and lower the EA (0.29 eV in the temperature range of 180 to 340 K).239 Cui et al. reported that the simultaneous substitution of elemental Nb and Y for the Zr sites tremendously improves the Li-ion conductivity and air stability of LLZO.238

Synthesis conditions. 
Usually, the detailed conditions in the synthesis process exert a great impact upon the micro-structures of ISEs, including crystallite size, grain size, GBs and bulk density, which can directly affect the ionic conductivity of the final ISEs.191,195,200,242 Commonly, a decrease in grain size and an increase in bulk density can result in higher ionic conductivity. Bernuy-Lopez and co-authors243 regulated the sintering conditions of LLZO by using a dry O2 atmosphere, which can bring about the formation of dense ceramic materials and avoid the degradation process thanks to the exchange of Li+ by H+ from atmospheric moisture. This novel synthesis approach led to total conductivity values of as high as ∼1.3 and ∼2.2 mS cm−1 at 24 and 42 °C, respectively, which are among the highest Li ion conductivities reported for LLZO. Kim et al. deduced that the ionic conductivity of nano-crystalline LLZO can be enhanced due to a very small grain size and a large concentration of GBs.242 In general, a large GB area can result in low impurity segregation on the GBs, which can block Li-ion conduction; thus higher ionic conductivity is achieved compared to micro-sized materials.244 However, detrimental short-circuiting and resistance may be caused by the GBs. Furthermore, the total ionic conductivity of LLZO would be greatly decreased if the GB area were too large, owing to the highly restrained migration of Li ions at GBs.245 Consequently, the designed sintering conditions play a reasonably crucial role in obtaining the optimum ionic conductivity.

3.3 Thio-/LISICON-type ISEs
As for the LISICON and thio-LISICON ISEs, the crystallized structure is generally analogous to the Li4SiO4 of the P21/m space group and the γ-Li3PO4 structure with the Pnma space group, in which all of the cations are tetrahedrally coordinated and belong to an orthorhombic unit cell (Fig. 5a).20,246 This structure can be established as a distorted hexagonal close-packing of oxygen atoms, whose packing planes are perpendicular to the c-axis. Therefore, regular parallel one-dimensional (1D) chains along the a-axis are formed due to the distribution of cations in two crystallographically distinct tetrahedral interstices.247 By doping with aliovalent elements, for instance, the partial replacement of P5+ in γ-Li3PO4 systems with Si4+ or Ge4+ can yield compositions such as Li3+x(P1−xSix)O4,248 which results in LISICON-like specimens and rapid lithium-ion transport. As for the thio-LISICON families, they can be achieved by replacing O in Li3+x(P1−xSix)O4 by S to form Li3+x(P1−xSix)S4, leading to a three orders of magnitude rise in ionic conductivity.249 In the following subsections, LISICON-type and thio-LISICON SEs are briefly summarized.

3.3.1 LISICON-type ISEs. 
A LISICON-like fast lithium-ion conductor comes into being by integrating Li4SiO4 and γ-Li3PO4. In comparison with pure Li4SiO4 and γ-Li3PO4 members, the ionic conductivity can be improved by at least 3 orders of magnitude by constructing Li4−xSi1−xPxO4 (in the range of I = 0–0.4) or γ-Li3+ySiyP1−yO4 (in the range of y = 0–0.4), which has been widely demonstrated.250–252 Recently, the crystal structures and lithium-ion conduction mechanisms of the Li4SiO4–Li3PO4 electrolyte system have been restudied by Islam and co-workers using a powerful multi-technique approach, including diffraction, AC impedance, NMR spectroscopy, and atomistic modeling.250 Of particular significance is that the (1 − z)Li4SiO4–(z)Li3PO4 (z = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) families have been discovered to present desirable ionic conductivities of 10−3 S cm−1 at 573 K (Fig. 5b), which is several orders of magnitude higher than those of the end members. Furthermore, the compelling evidence obtained from large-scale MD simulations sheds light upon new insights into mixed Si/P compositions, in which Li-ion conduction occurs through 3D pathways via a cooperative interstitial mechanism. Besides this, such associated migration is a crucial factor in achieving high ionic conductivity. Islam and co-workers253 further confirmed that the lithium-ion conductivity of Li4±xSi1−xXxO4 (X = P, Al, or Ge) systems at RT can be obviously promoted by several orders of magnitude by substitution at Si sites. These systems contain a sequence of configurations, such as Li4SiO4, Li3.75Si0.75P0.25O4, Li4.25Si0.75Al0.25O4, Li4Al0.33Si0.33P0.33O4, or Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4. The results offer three different Li+ ion diffusion mechanisms, hinging on temperature (Fig. 5c). The interrelated experimental and MD simulated ionic conductivity values (Fig. 5d) show that Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4 exhibits a transition to superionic motion at a temperature much lower than that of Li4SiO4; hence, an ionic conductivity of 0.9 mS cm−1 at RT is rendered. Also, Holzwarth et al.247,254 adopted first-principles modeling techniques to examine possible Li-ion diffusion mechanisms in Li3PO4 in both the γ and β crystalline forms, verifying an interstitial mechanism involving the concerted motion of an interstitial Li ion and a neighboring Li ion of the host lattice. In particular, Lu et al. reported a simple tactic to fulfill the integration of high ionic conductivity and superior electrochemical stability by the substitution of Cl for O, according to the guidance of bottleneck size and binding energy (Fig. 5e).255 Apparently, high ionic conductivities of 1.03 × 10−5 and 3.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 were obtained for Li10.42Si1.5P1.5Cl0.08O11.92 and Li10.42Ge1.5P1.5Cl0.08O11.92, respectively, which are 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of bare Li3PO4, and 1 order of magnitude higher than that of pristine Li10.5Si1.5P1.5O12.
In summary, LISICON-type ISEs can operate at high temperatures thanks to their excellent thermal stability and near-zero vapor pressure. However, up to now, few LISICON-type ISEs have been reported compared with others, which is probably as a result of their relatively low ionic conductivity at RT (10−7–10−5 S cm−1).253,255,256


3.3.2 Thio-LISICON-type ISEs. 
Amorphous. 
The advances in sulfide SEs date back to studies on ion-conducting glass, and conductivities in the order of 10−3 S cm−1 have been observed in a sulfide glass.73 Glassy ISEs based on xLi2S·(100 − x)P2S5, where x ranges from 70 to 80, have drawn wide attention, and been widely studied due to their enormous potential for high energy density Li-ion batteries, and especially for Li–S batteries. In particular, stoichiometric Li7P3S11 delivers a high Li-ion conductivity of ∼4.2 × 10−3 S cm−1.257,258 As mentioned above, the synthetic conditions play a key role in determining the ionic conductivity. Noticeably, a unique heat treatment process endowed an Li2S–P2S5 glass-ceramic conductor with an extremely high ionic conductivity of ∼1.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at RT, benefiting from a decrease in GB resistance and the positive influence of voids.81 Recently, 70Li2S–30P2S5 and 78Li2S–22P2S5 glass-ceramic electrolytes with a high conductivity of more than 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 have been developed.259,260 As reported, the substitution of Li2S–P2S5 with oxide has been verified to improve its ionic conductivity and chemical stability. For instance, substitution with 1 mol% Li3PO4 to the 70Li2S–30P2S5 allows it to exhibit an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of ∼1.87 × 10−3 S cm−1, which can be rationally ascribed to a reduction in EA for Li-ion diffusion and the formation of a highly conductive Li7P3S11 phase in the presence of PS43− and P2S74− ions.258 Moreover, Xia and co-workers designed a novel MoS2-doped Li2S–P2S5 glass-ceramic electrolyte, which delivered a striking ionic conductivity of ∼4.8 mS cm−1 at RT and a steady wide electrochemical window up to 5.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). Impressively, an all-solid-state Li–S battery constructed with this electrolyte exhibited an amazingly high discharge capacity of ∼1020 mA h g−1, better than that for the undoped counterpart.261 In another significant piece of research, incorporating LiI into Li2S–P2S5 glass has been demonstrated to greatly suppress the formation of Li dendrites, which is the main challenge to utilizing Li-metal anodes with sulfide-based ISEs.27
The main drawback of these sulfide electrolytes is that they must be handled in an inert gas atmosphere since they have low chemical stability in air. The hydrolysis of these sulfides by water molecules in air generates harmful H2S gas.115 Tatsumisago and co-workers firstly investigated the structure and stability of Li2S-based sulfide ISEs in air, and examined the amount of H2S generated with an increase in Li2S content (67, 70, 75 and 80 mol% Li2S).76 The observations showed that the structural units of 67Li2S 33P2S5 glass, P2S74− ions, change greatly in air, leading to considerable amounts of H2S being generated. In contrast, there are no obvious structural changes for 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass or glass-ceramic composed of PS43− ions in the atmosphere, which can be put down to the original PS43− group having good chemical stability against hydrolysis. Thus, the optimization of chemical composition and separation from the ambient atmosphere with respect to Li2S–P2S5 electrolytes is of vital importance.262
Crystallinity. 
The latest advances related to ionic conductivity for LISICON-type and thio-LISICON-type are collected in Fig. 6a.73,74,248,250,263–265 It is apparent that an appealing thio-LISICON-type ISE of Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) shows the highest ionic conductivity of ∼1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at RT,266 which can be rightly compared to a conventional liquid electrolyte. This is mainly ascribed to its intrinsic 3D framework structure and 1D Li conduction path along the c-axis. In addition, the substitution of S2− for O2− can weaken the binding of Li ions and expand the channels of ionic transportation.84,267,268 Typically, LGPS has the space group P42/nmc with a tetragonal unit cell, which is made up of isolated PS4 and GeS4 tetrahedra occupying two distinct crystallographic sites.266 The concerted migration of LGPS extracted from AIMD simulations is provided in Fig. 6b and c. In LGPS, a typical concerted migration involves four Li ions occupying Li1 and Li3 sites hopping simultaneously along the c channel into their nearest-neighboring Li3 and Li1 sites, respectively.87 In addition, the underlying diffusion pathways in LGPS have been thoroughly elucidated via neutron powder diffraction in association with multiple solid-state NMR methods, further confirming the existence of quasi-isotropic 3D lithium diffusion pathways, which are a combination of 1D diffusion channels crossing two diffusion planes.268,269 Despite the advantages mentioned above, unfortunately, the large-scale application and generalization of LGPS is severely limited by its unaffordable costs. A feasible approach to tackling the issue is to replace the Ge with other reasonable elements, such as Sn, but at the expense of ionic conductivity. Dehnen and co-workers265 recently developed an affordable lithium superionic conductor, Li10SnP2S12, which is yielded by the reaction between Li2S and P2S5 with Li4[SnS4]. The Li10SnP2S12 conductor shows a total conductivity of ∼0.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 27 °C, which is lower than that of LGPS, but the raw material cost can be cut down by a factor of ∼3. Most recently, the origin of the reduction in conductivity along with an increase in the Sn fraction in Li10Ge1−xSnxP2S12 was ascertained by investigating the structure–property relationships, as shown in Fig. 6d.270 The intrinsic origins of this behavior can be clarified as follows: upon mounting an Sn4+ constituent in Li10Ge1−xSnxP2S12, a structural bottleneck along the diffusion channels in the z-direction begins to tighten, and with the concomitant increase in lattice softness, the local ionic bonding interactions between Li+ and S2− become stronger, further increasing the activation barrier.270 More significantly, in order to simultaneously realize cost-effectiveness and high ionic conductivity, a conductivity of ∼2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 for Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 has been favorably achieved, and it was found that ASLBs can be built with outstanding cycling performance (∼75% of capacity retention over 500 cycles).21 Crystalline LGPS with high ionic conductivity have also been successfully utilized in a full cell with high-voltage cathode materials. Hirayama et al.271 have successfully operated the fabrication of bulk-type 5 V-class ASLBs composed of an LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, LGPS solid–electrolyte, and Li-metal anode, as described in Fig. 6e, where the 1st discharge capacity is up to ∼80 mA h g−1 and an average voltage of 4.3 V is held. But the growth of a resistive interfacial layer resulting from the decomposition products at the LGPS/acetylene black interface restricts the transport of electrons and/or Li ions in the cathode composite, which is mainly responsible for the capacity fading.271

In fact, the research boom into crystalline sulfide-based ceramic electrolytes can be traced back to the pioneering discovery of LPS, which is the most stable phase in the Li2S–P2S5 system, with three different transitions among the α, β and γ-phases as a function of temperature.272 The γ-LPS shows a low conductivity of ∼3 × 10−7 S cm−1 at RT, while β-LPS, which can be transformed into γ-LPS when the temperature is below 195 °C, has a higher conductivity. For this reason, the RT ionic conductivity is remarkably enhanced by three orders of magnitude by constructing nanostructured LPS, further distinctly stabilizing the metastable β-phase.74 The implementation of high-nickel-content LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 in a bulk-type solid-state battery with β-LPS as a sulfide-based solid electrolyte has been successfully presented (Fig. 6f). The interfacial decomposition and chemomechanical contraction of the active material upon delithiation was first investigated in detail, which will propel the practical application of these sulfide-based ISEs in ASLBs.273 Excitingly, Liang and co-workers recently demonstrated a newly formed Li7P2S8I phase with appropriate compositions of LiI and LPS, which exhibited an electrochemical stability of 10 V (vs. Li/Li+) and a high ionic conductivity of 6.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at RT.75
By and large, the superiorities obviously emerge in terms of ion conductivity for binary amorphous and ternary crystalline sulfide ISEs in comparison with their counterparts, benefiting from their low GB resistance. However, enormous efforts should be devoted to overcoming several shortcomings faced by these sulfide-based ISEs, such as their highly hygroscopic nature, limited electrochemical window, generation of harmful H2S gas, and unaffordable cost.76,265,266,274

3.4 Perovskite and antiperovskite type ISEs

3.4.1 Perovskite-type. 
In general, perovskite-type ISEs, in the form of ABO3 (A = Ca, Sr or La; B = Al or Ti; X = O), are composed of two cations and abundant oxygen deficiencies, reserving the space for Li ions by means of aliovalent substitution.100 The importation of Li ions to the A sites in the perovskite framework can yield the common formula, a classic electrolyte of LLTO. The layered perovskite-type La0.62Li0.16TiO3 structure with a Cmmm space group consists of (1) the La-rich (001) La1–O1 layer, (2) the (004) Ti–O layer, and (3) the La-deficient (002) La2–O2 layer. The La-rich La1–O1 and La-deficient La2–O2 layers are alternately arranged along the c-axis,275 as shown in Fig. 7a. With the aim of detecting the Li+ migration pathways in perovskites, a neutron powder diffraction study of the La0.62Li0.16TiO3 perovskite was conducted accordingly. As depicted in Fig. 7b, the Li ions located in the 2c, 2d and 4f positions mainly gather on the La2–O2 layer, offering an opportunity to transfer along the 2c–4f–2c diffusion path or the other potential migration channels 2c–2d–2c. It was found that the facility of the Li ions in the perovskite-type ISEs is highly sensitive to the concentrations of both Li+ and vacancies, and the associated bottlenecks should be expanded through introducing rare-earth or alkaline-earth ions.65,275 Susana et al. further demonstrated that the optimization of Li+ conductivity requires control over the ratio of charge carriers/vacancies as well as a shortening of the B–O distance or an increase in the A–O distance, where the developed solid solution La0.56Li0.33+x□0.11−xTi1−xAlxO3 (□ means a cation vacancy) with a composition of x = 0.03, corresponding to ∼8% vacancies, shows a Li+ conductivity as high as ∼2.95 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 295 K.276

Another crucial factor determining the ionic conductivity has been proven to be the micro-structures of these materials. Epitaxial strain is an effective approach to tuning Li ionic conduction. Typically, Fukumura et al. fabricated high-quality Li0.33La0.56TiO3 (LLT) epitaxial thin films on perovskite oxide substrates with various lattice mismatches by PLD (Fig. 7c). Strikingly, a high ionic conductivity of ∼6.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at RT can be achieved by the LLT thin film on NdGaO3 (110) substrate.277,278 Recently, a correlation between the micro-structures and Li+ conducting properties of perovskites was investigated by controlling the sintering temperature and Li content,279 as shown in Fig. 7d and e. The results reveal that the domain size is a predominant factor in determining the Li+ conducting behaviors associated with the boundary resistances of the perovskite Li3xLa(2/3)−x□(1/3)−2xTiO3. Attractively, a combination of 1D ceramic Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) nanofibers (Fig. 7f) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) was successfully designed and synthesized by simple electrospinning and a subsequent calcination route. Thanks to the uninterrupted ionic conductive pathways, this unique product shows a high ionic conductivity of ∼2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at RT and a large electrochemical stability window of up to 5.0 V (vs. Li/Li+).280
The perovskite-type ISEs, especially LLTO, are still up against several challenges. How to effectively lower the GB resistance is of great significance, through significantly improving the total conductivity of the LLTO to that equivalent to bulk conductivity. On the other hand, it is also an urgent matter to resolve how to maximally suppress the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as soon as the LLTO is in direct contact with Li metal, similar to the LATP mentioned above.109,281,282


3.4.2 Antiperovskite-type. 
Inspired by the high-temperature superionic conductivity of NaMgF3 and (K, Na)MgF3 perovskites, Zhao et al. firstly developed a novel family of “electronically-inverted” antiperovskites with a general formula of Li3OX (X = Cl, Br) as Li-rich superionic conductors with an ionic conductivity beyond 10−3 S cm−1 at RT.283 The typical crystal structure of Li3OCl is depicted in Fig. 8a.284 In this antiperovskite framework, a great deal of Li+ ions in the crystal lattice are accommodated and these Li+ ions can migrate smoothly by importing certain amounts of crystal defects: for instance, Li+ and Cl− vacancies.282 As for the Li3OX (X = Cl, Br) system, especially for Li3OCl, the correlated Li+-ion transport mechanism, phase stability and defect chemistry, as well as the concentration of charge carriers have been systematically studied.285–289 In particular, the dominant Li+ diffusion mechanism in Li3OCl is Li vacancy hopping, which has been proved via ab initio DFT calculations and classical MD simulations.286 However, an opposite assumption was proposed by Paschoal et al. that the Li+ interstitials outnumber Li+ vacancies by 2–3 orders of magnitude in heavily LiCl-deficient Li3OCl. Therefore, the interstitials, not vacancies, were suggested to be the mobile charge carriers responsible for superionic conduction.288 Also recently, first-principles DFT calculations were implemented to systematically evaluate the electronic, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of Li3OCl (Fig. 8b).284 It was found that the LiCl defect pair has the lowest formation energy compared to those for Li2O, O substituted Cl, and Li/Li-vacancy Frenkel defect pairs. The LiCl and Frenkel defect pairs play a vital role in determining Li diffusion in Li3OCl. Thus, a deeper comprehension of the ion-transport pathway and defect chemistry is of vital importance by using theoretical methods in the future.

However, several studies of Li+ conductivity in crystalline “Li3OX” compounds have suggested that the as-prepared “Li3OX” may be Li2OHX antiperovskite rather than Li3OX.290–292 Liang and co-workers explored the LiOH–LiCl system, and demonstrated that Li2OHCl with increased crystal defects has the highest ionic conductivity and an extremely stable interface with the Li-metal anode, which is mainly due to the formation of a stable SEI. Notably, an Li/Li2OHCl/Li cell cycled at 195 °C shows outstanding stability.290 Goodenough and co-authors determined the crystal structure of cubic Li2OHCl by neutron diffraction, indicating that the H+ is on the axis of an O–Cl bond and forms an OH− bond.292 They further revealed that the substitution of F− for the OH− anion not only reduces the number of hindered H+ ions, which hinders Li+ jumping, but also stabilizes the more favorable cubic phase at RT. Thus, a promising fluorine-doped antiperovskite Li-ion conductor Li2(OH)0.9F0.1Cl was prepared, in which the structural phase is transformed from the orthorhombic Li2OHCl to an RT cubic phase, leading to two orders of magnitude higher Li-ion conductivity than that of Li2OHCl and high electrochemical stability to 9.0 V (vs. Li+/Li).292 Apart from developing synthesis approaches and structural calculations for the current antiperovskite-type ISEs, it is also crucial to explore new systems based on antiperovskites to propel the practical application of ASLBs. Interestingly, a double-antiperovskite structure, Li6OSI2 (or Li3O0.5S0.5I) with a new phase is established and synthesized through finely tuning the lattice chemistry of antiperovskite structures.293 Strikingly, the migration of an interstitial Li+ in an antiperovskite phase such as Li3SI is calculated to be a dumbbell-linked pathway, as given in Fig. 8c, showing a lower EA barrier in comparison with the vacancy mechanism. Moreover, two types of migrating modes associated with the two types of octahedra exist in this double antiperovskite Li6OSI2 (Fig. 8d), combining two new phases with low activation energies, leading to excellent Li+ conductivity at RT.293 Through probing a series of antiperovskites composed of cluster ions, Fang and co-workers first developed two novel Li-ion superionic conductors, i.e., Li3SBF4 and Li3S(BF4)0.5Cl0.5 (Fig. 8e).294 The former has an RT conductivity of ∼10−2 S cm−1 and the latter exhibits an RT conductivity as high as 10−1 S cm−1, which is the highest conductivity value among all of the previous reports. The high ionic conductivity has been proven to be enabled by the thermally-excited vibrational modes of the cluster ions and the large channel size created by mixing the large cluster ion with the small elementary ion.
Another effective way to ensure high ionic conductivity and controllable interfaces is to construct solid electrolyte films with the desired structure by deposition approaches. Recently, Jia and coworkers presented the use of a novel composite target, referring to a compressed mixture of Li2O and LiCl to deposit the Li3OCl films by PLD.295 Corresponding results illustrated that Li3OCl films with high crystallinity can be successfully shaped and the RT ionic conductivity increases substantially up to approximately 10−4 S cm−1. The smooth interfacial contact between the Li metal and Li3OCl can be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an in situ focused ion beam system (Fig. 8f). An all-solid-state thin-film battery assembled with an LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode and a graphite anode joined with this Li3OCl film exhibits an initial discharge capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1 and a high Coulombic efficiency of ∼95% after the second cycle.

3.5 Nitride-based ISEs
Proverbially, it is widely deemed to be a valid approach to decrease the bulk and interfacial resistance of ISEs by reducing their thickness. Specific ISEs can be built as ultrathin films via special techniques, including PLD, ion beam sputtering,296 ALD and CVD. To date, amorphous LiPON nonetheless stands out as the optimal candidate to construct a thin-film solid-state battery, thanks greatly to its special preparation.297,298
In the early stages, the sputtering method was implemented to fabricate LiPON films using Li3PO4 as the target material and N2 as the processing atmosphere, yielding a conductivity of ∼2.0 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C and long-term stability in contact with Li metal.298 However, the fabrication of the LiPON film by the sputtering technique suffers as a result of an undesirable relatively slow growth rate and film cracking.299 Consequently, the metal–organic CVD technique was investigated and employed to deposit LiPON films without any cracks.300 Nevertheless, the required high deposition temperatures (500 °C) are undesirable for co-processing with many battery materials and packaging components; meanwhile, the conductivity level of the obtained LiPON is greatly susceptible to the substrate temperature, hence leading to an unsatisfactory ionic conductivity of ∼2.95 × 10−7 S cm−1. The emerging ALD is a distinctive superior gas-phase thin-film technique to deposit highly conformal coatings with atomic-level precision on complex nanometer-scale architectures.35,301 Rubloff and co-workers first reported the ALD process for LiPON deposition and further demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the N content in LiPON films ranging from 0% to 16.3% by variation of the N dose at a specific location in the ALD sequence.35 Then, Karppinen and co-workers innovatively overcame the challenge of simultaneously integrating the phosphorus and nitrogen in LiPON, allowing for a high N to P ratio in the LiPON films, which is beneficial for achieving the required high ionic conductivity. As a result, a film with a constituent of Li0.95PO3.00N0.60 deposited at 330 °C engendered an ionic conductivity value of 6.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 at RT.302 Mostly recently, Ceder and co-workers constructed amorphous LiPON structure models and investigated the mechanisms of ion conductivity in LiPON electrolytes using a combination of AIMD simulations, DFT, neutron scattering, and infrared spectroscopy.303,304 They concluded that to maximize Li+ mobility in LiPON, it is important to accommodate N in bridging sites while keeping a high concentration of charge carriers, which implies that the concentration of excess Li with respect to Li3PO4 and of isolated O anions should be minimized. The conclusion is consistent with recent research on the interrelations between chemical composition, structure, sputtering conditions and conductivity of LiPON.305,306 Li-compensated LiPON is reported to show an ionic conductivity of 3.2 × 10−6 S cm−1.307
Besides, LiPON film ISEs obtained by special vapour deposition or a sputtering method result in an ultrathin film with a thickness of a few hundred nanometers.296,308 Furthermore, the film generally possesses a smooth surface and forms an intimate contact with electrode layers, which can meet the requirements of compact solid-state Li-ion batteries.308,309 For instance, a functional ASLB of less than 1 μm in thickness was successfully fabricated using ultra-thin LiPON layers (12–195 nm), which were fabricated by ion beam sputtering.296 Unfortunately, amorphous LiPON films, which are confined by their intrinsic characteristics, deliver uncompetitive ionic conductivity levels of a mere 10−7–10−6 S cm−1 or so.84,296 In addition, a potential threat to these thin-film batteries is that an ultrathin electrolyte can be pierced to induce a short circuit when it encounters the rough surface of an electrode.109,310
3.6 Emerging ISEs

Argyrodite-type. 
Lithium argyrodite Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, or I) have lately been used to develop fast lithium-ion conductors, with an ionic conductivity approaching 7 × 10−3 S cm−1, as first reported by Deiseroth.311 The crystal structure of Li6PS5X is shown in Fig. 9a, in which the X− anions form a face-centered cubic lattice (Wyckoff positions 4a and 4c) with S2− anions in half of the tetrahedral voids and PS43− tetrahedra on the octahedral sites (P on Wyckoff 4b). As for the occupation of Li ions, two potential crystallographic positions for Li+ are the Wyckoff 48h and 24g, of which the 24g sites stand for an intermediate state.105 The nature of Li-ion conductivity in argyrodite ISEs (Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br) has been ascertained through DFT-based MD simulations,312 suggesting that the effect of halogen atoms on their local surroundings is equally significant, apart from the critical role of Li-ion vacancies in the argyrodite-type framework. Therefore, the change in the halogen distribution in Li argyrodites can evidently enhance the Li+ conductivity of these materials. Moreover, a combination of 7Li NMR experiments and MD simulations further revealed two clearly distinguishable Li-ion motion processes: (1) local transitions within the cage-like structure formed by Li-ion positions around the S or Cl atom and (2) intercage transitions, which are the limiting step for the macroscopic diffusion of Li ions in the crystalline bulk Li6PS5Cl structure.313 The influence of lattice polarizability on ionic conductivity in Li6PS5X argyrodites was also investigated by controlling the fractional occupancy of the halide anions combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and neutron diffraction, suggesting that the lattice softness has a striking influence on the ionic transport.105 Besides, the EA is relatively low, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 eV, owing to its smooth migration in between the hexagons made of partially occupied positions.314–316

Although argyrodite-type ISEs are promising candidates for bulk ASLBs due to their high ionic conductivity and good processability, the challenge of interfacial instability still exists just like that for sulfide-based ISEs. Preliminary measurements have shown that the electrochemically stable window of Li6PS5Cl is very wide, from 0.0 to 7.0 V (vs. Li/Li+).20,317 More recently, the electrochemical window and stability of Li6PS5Cl towards Li metal was evaluated by electrochemical testing of asymmetric Pt/Li6PS5Cl/Li and symmetric Li/Li6PS5Cl/Li cells.318 The results showed that no severe decompositions of the Li6PS5Cl could be observed with a potential range of −0.5 to 5 V. However, Merinov and co-workers performed a theoretical investigation of the Li/Li6PS5Cl interface based on AIMD simulations, showing that the Li/Li6PS5Cl interface decomposes with the formation of multiple phases, and the main decomposition products are Li2S, Li3P, LiCl, and possibly LiP.319 Consistent with this theoretical calculations, Janek and co-workers studied the stability and interphase growth of argyrodite type compounds Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br and I) when in contact with Li metal using an in situ XPS technique and time-resolved impedance spectroscopy, confirming the formation of Li2S and Li3P together with LiX.320 Thus, it remains a challenging task to understand the interfacial evolution of argyrodite-type ISEs toward Li metal, and more advanced characterization techniques should be further implemented. As for the interface stability of argyrodite electrolytes toward positive electrodes, Dedryvére et al. investigated the interface stability of Li6PS5Cl towards several positive electrode materials, including LCO, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, and LiMn2O4 (Fig. 9b),321 indicating that Li6PS5Cl is oxidized into elemental sulfur, lithium polysulfides, P2Sx, phosphates, and LiCl at the interface because of the interface reactivity. Similarly, they also confirmed their findings through analyzing the interfacial mechanisms in cycled LCO/Li6PS5Cl/Li4Ti5O12 full cells.314 However, in spite of this interface reactivity, good capacity retention of corresponding ASLBs can still be achieved.321


Li1+2xZn1−xPS4. 
The Li1+2xZn1−xPS4 family with a body-centered cubic sulfur sublattice is a newly proposed fast ion conductor, which has been evidenced by a combination of DFT and AIMD simulation techniques.322 Intuitively, the family can be derived from I-type structure LiZnPS4 material, which contains an identical framework showing an RT ionic conductivity of a mere ∼10−8 S cm−1.323 As for LiZnPS4, its structure incorporates a framework of PS43− and ZnS46− tetrahedra housing Li+ ions, where Li fully takes up the 2b site and Zn occupies the 2a site, as depicted in Fig. 9c. In regard to the nonstoichiometric Li1+2xZn1−xPS4, the additional Li shares the 2a site with Zn, which distributes equally between the 2a and an additional site, 2d. The 2d site is estimated to be close to the “interstitial” site.322,324 Excitingly, the calculated results imply that a conductivity in excess of ∼0.1 S cm−1 can be potentially attained with the solubility range extending to Li2.5Zn0.25PS4 (x = 0.75). Even with the x = 0.5 limitation, the high defect solubility yields an expected ionic conductivity of 5.4 × 10−2 S cm−1, exceeding a large proportion of current counterparts.322 However, inspired by this, Nazar et al. further studied the inherent relationship of body structure and high ion conductivity in the solid solution (Li1+2xZn1−xPS4) derived from combined X-ray and neutron powder diffraction analysis. The results demonstrated the conductivity of the refined phase, for instance, Li1.7Zn0.65PS4 (∼1.30 × 10−4 S cm−1) and Li1.2Zn0.9PS4 (∼1.65 × 10−5 S cm−1), which are lower than the predicted theoretical values.324 The highest ionic conductivity of ∼8.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 was achieved when x = 0.75 in the form of a crystallized material. Furthermore, Ceder and co-workers reported the experimental synthesis and electrochemical properties of Li1+2xZn1−xPS4 with various x values, which were synthesized from a mixture of LiZnPS4 and amorphous LPS (a-LPS).323 They confirmed that stoichiometric LiZnPS4 has a low RT conductivity, and the conductivity of the Li1+2xZn1−xPS4 increases greatly with an increase in lithium concentration. Among these, the maximum RT ionic conductivity reached ∼5.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at x = 0.63, which is obviously higher than that for LiZnPS4 (10−8 S cm−1 or so). Furthermore, this newly developed electrolyte has been successfully employed in a bilayer all-solid-state battery with a configuration of graphite|a-LPS|Li2.25Zn0.375PS4|LiNi0.8Mn0.05Co0.15O2 coated with Li2O–ZrO2, which displays a good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles.323


Closo-borate ISEs. 
Of late, polyborate salts ground on closo-borates including B12H122−, B10H102−, CB9H10−, and CB11H12− anions have emerged as a booming new class of ISEs with extraordinary high-temperature ionic conductivities of over ∼10−1 S cm−1.325–327 For instance, the Li+ conductivity of LiCB11H12 was determined as >0.15 S cm−1 when the temperature was higher than 403 K.328 Furthermore, Wood and coworkers employed AIMD simulations and DFT calculations to figure out the reasons for cation diffusion, and an in-depth insight into the basic principles of ultrafast ion conduction was achieved.329 The simulated crystal structure of superionic Li2B12H12 is given in Fig. 9d. Corresponding analysis revealed that Li+ ions are predicted to preferentially occupy trigonal and tetrahedral interstitial sites in M2B12H12closo-borates. In the fcc crystal structure adopted by Li2B12H12, there are four trigonal interstitial sites available per cation, implying 1/4 occupancy. This investigation also demonstrated that a high density of accessible interstitial sites and distinct site types exist in this internal structure, which are responsible for the flatness of the energy landscape and the detected cation mobility.329 However, the inevitable phase transformation from ordered to disordered for Li2B12H12 accompanied by the expansion of the unit cell, indeed take place above a certain temperature, which sharply reduces the ionic conductivity.330 To decrease the transition temperature, the structurally similar icosahedral, monovalent CB11H12− anions are deliberately imported to yield the LiCB11H12 compound. This leads to a much lower transition temperature (400 K) than that for the analogous Li2B12H12, and stellar ionic conductivities (>0.1 S cm−1), which are unmatched by any other known polycrystalline materials at these temperatures (Fig. 9e).328 Just recently, the combination of AIMD simulations and quasielastic neutron scattering was carried out to further elucidate the underlying relationship between the cation diffusion and high orientational mobilities of the CB11H12− anions.331 The findings suggested that the incorporation of atomic C will yield a dipole, which can change the energy landscape of neighboring cations tremendously, and hence endow LiCB11H12 with relatively lower activation energies compared to its carbon-free counterpart. This in turn renders lower temperatures, which are necessary to access the disordered phases and more conductive to Li+ ions.331 Predictably, closo-borate ISEs, especially LiCB11H12, could definitely boost advances in Li solid-state batteries under high operating temperatures. In particular, Liang's group recently reported a feasible Li solid-state battery system in the form of Li-metal/LiBH4–LiI/lithiated TiS2, which exhibited good cyclic stability at 120 °C.327

4. Origin, challenges, and solutions for sur-/interfacial evolution
Advances in high ionic conductive ISEs have progressed tremendously in recent years, while it has proved deeply problematic to integrate them smoothly into electrodes whether it be the cathodes or the anodes in ASLBs. Fundamentally, apart from a high bulk ionic conductivity, a small GB resistance for ISEs is also important. From the perspective of practical applications, the stability of ISEs in an ambient atmosphere is of prime importance, as air-stable ISEs can greatly cut down the cost of manufacturing in contrast to air-sensitive ISEs.245 Most importantly, the principal hurdle lies in seeking suitable strategies to optimize the interfacial properties between ISEs and electrodes, and excellent electrochemical compatibility and ultralow interfacial resistances could be achieved. A schematic illustration, as exhibited in Fig. 10, outlines these challenges. In the next subsection, the substantial original and current challenges for sur-/interfacial evolution are summarized in detail. Then, we comprehensively outline the typical regulations to tune the air-stabilities and GB restrictions, together with classic strategies to suppress the growth of lithium dendrites and decrease interfacial resistance, as described in the recent literature.

4.1 Stabilities in ambient atmosphere
In order to achieve high ionic conductivity, it is equally critical to consider practical applications, where an acceptable stability against an environment containing moisture, oxygen, and carbon dioxide is highly desirable.
As investigated previously, the surface of garnet-type ISEs is highly sensitive to air exposure.332,333 To shed light upon the reaction mechanism, Ta-doped LLZO was deliberately exposed in dry (humidity ∼5%) and humid air (humidity ∼80%) for 6 weeks, by Duan et al.334 As a result, a mechanism for Li2CO3 formation was proposed as follows (Fig. 11a): initially, water vapor from the ambient air spontaneously gathers on the sample surface; at the same time, the exchange of Li+/H+ occurs not only on the garnet grains but at the GBs, giving rise to the formation of LiOH·H2O. The resulting LiOH·H2O acts as a prerequisite intermediate and required precursor, after reacting with CO2, finally leading to the formation of a Li2CO3 layer. In sharp contrast, only a small amount of Li2CO3 can be observed in LLZO when exposed to dry air. So far, several approaches for lessening this insulative layer on the surface, which will create a large interfacial resistance, have been explored. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 11b, the origin of the large interfacial resistance of the garnet is graphically illustrated, which is mainly related to the Li+/H+ exchange at the surfaces of the garnet grains and the Li+ insulating Li2CO3 surface layer on the garnet surface.335 Because of this, a carbon-treated Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZT-C) was developed by Goodenough and coworkers by reacting garnet LLZT with carbon at 700 °C, thus greatly diminishing the Li2CO3 and protons in the garnet framework.335 In addition, the amount of the Li–Al–O glass phase on the garnet surface, which is responsible for the low Li-ion conductivity, was also decreased. Evidently, the related Raman mapping of LLZT and LLZT-C (Fig. 11c), where the color stands for the integral area calculated from the Li2CO3 peak at 1090 cm−1, indicates that there is a thick Li2CO3 layer on the surface of LLZT with an uneven distribution, while negligible Li2CO3 signals can be detected in LLZT-C. Intriguingly, a successive combination of wet polishing and heat treatment has been proven to be an effective way to remove both carbonate/hydroxide-based surface contamination layers, resulting in a dramatic growth in Li wettability and the erosion of nearly all interfacial resistance down to ∼2 Ω cm2.336 Specifically, Liu et al. studied the impact of crucibles, including Pt and Al crucibles, on the air stability and ionic conductivity of Al-doped LLZO.337 The results verified that Al-doped LLZO prepared in a Pt crucible leads to larger grains, lower GBs, and thus a better air stability is obtained. In addition, the formation of Li2CO3 is greatly dependent on the grain size of LLZO, where a small-grained one (the corresponding SEM images after 6 months exposure to the ambient atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 11f and g) are more air-stable than a large-grained one (Fig. 11d and e, corresponding SEM images after 6 months exposure to the ambient atmosphere), yielding far less surficial Li2CO3.338 All of these observations suggest that reasonable surface treatment and synthesis conditions play a vital role in determining the ionic conductivities and air stabilities of garnet-type ISEs.

As for the sulfide-based system, it easily suffers from the moisture in air to form detrimental H2S gas. Consequently, its preparation and usage must be implemented under inert atmospheres, which will bring about undesirable additional total cost.76,84 These intrinsic hygroscopic properties of sulfide-based ISEs are regarded as a principal hurdle in their practical utilization. As a consequence, the surface decoration of sulfide-based ISEs to enhance their stabilities against ambient atmosphere is very meaningful. Recently proposed strategies to improve the stability of sulfide-based ISEs against air mainly include the modulation of composition,76 the addition of metal oxides339 and partial substitution,77 as well as elemental doping.22 In particular, the element arsenic was employed to partially substitute Sn in the Li4SnS4 specimen, which can not only endow a higher ionic conductivity (∼1.39 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) but can stabilize the surface structure even when exposed to the air.22 More recently, Xu and co-workers explored the air stability of LiI, LiCl, and P2O5 doped glass-ceramic LPS, as exhibited in Fig. 11h, further confirming that the stability in moisture as for sulfide-based electrolytes is substantially associated with its specific structures and compositions.115
With regard to other types of ISEs, NASICON-type ISEs have been demonstrated to be very stable in air even if the GB impedance is relatively high.57 To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research report on the stability of perovskite-type ISEs in ambient air. Nonetheless, potential insights can be gained into the stability in ambient air of lithium titanate compounds, which proved to be unstable in ambient air, accompanied by the growth of LiTi2O4 and Li2CO3 on the surface.340
4.2 Grain boundaries
In general, the ionic conductivity of a polycrystalline ceramic is distinctly inferior to a single crystal because of the existence of GBs, which normally originate from the interphases and the space-charge layer.109,333 In fact, GB resistance in ASLBs is a thorny problem that must be overcome to achieve the ionic conductivity required for their practical applications. To this end, first and foremost, a thoroughgoing perception of the ionic migration mechanism at GBs is extremely imperative and of high importance.245,341,342 Recently, Dawson and co-workers used Li3OCl as a model polycrystalline electrolyte, and applied large-scale MD simulations to elucidate the ionic transport mechanism at stable GBs.341Fig. 12a describes the unique channels for Li-ion migration in the grains and at GBs, including intragranular (within grains), intergranular (between grains), and within the GBs. The greatest significance of this result is that a polycrystalline model was presented to quantify the impact of GBs on conductivity as a function of grain size (Fig. 12b).341 Equally, Chi and co-workers conducted an atomic-scale study to unravel the origin of the large GB resistance by choosing LLTO as a prototype material (Fig. 12c).342 This observation shows that most GBs cause serious structural and chemical deviations, such as wastage of lithium, elemental reduction from Ti4+ to Ti3+, diminishment of the La and deformation of the Ti–O polyhedra, leading to high GB resistance, which hence yields poor ionic conductivity. Furthermore, toward uncovering the GB-associated phenomena, Siegel et al.245 carried out a series of characterizations of the compositions, transport, and energetic capabilities of three low-energy (Σ3 and Σ5) symmetric-tilt GBs at the atomic scale in LLZO, as exhibited in Fig. 12d–f. This calculation further confirmed that Li migration is generally slower in the GB region, compared to that in the bulk. However, the degree of this influence is profoundly dependent on the GB structures and temperatures. Overall, all these proposed mechanisms for GBs will pave the way for rationally tailoring the grain size and micro-structures, which would further guide the optimization of ISEs.

To date, there have been great advances in not a few strategies for lowering GB resistance. First of all, the incorporation of a heterologous phase into the GBs can remarkably cut down the GB resistance as a result of the space-charge impact.109,132 Typically, Goodenough and co-workers introduced an LiF layer to the garnet LLZT surface, which can substantially suppress the formation of the impurity phase of Li2CO3, thus diminishing the GB resistance.343 Secondly, the introduction of other aliovalent ions can also reduce the GB resistance to some extent.344 For instance, the GB resistance of LLZO is strikingly suppressed by the addition of Si and Al, due to the facilitated Li+ transfer, which is caused by the formation of interfacial amorphous Li–Al–Si–O and nanocrystalline LiAlSiO4 phases.345 The third and most effective method is to optimize the synthesis conditions so as to precisely tune the constituents and micro-structures of the domain boundaries.81,279,346,347 Seino et al. testified that the optimum heat treatment for an Li2S–P2S5 glass-ceramic conductor can apparently decrease the GB resistance and the influence of voids, thus improving the ionic conductivity.81 This standpoint has also been verified in the cubic garnet-type families, where a small grain size renders the LLZO with much lower GB resistances than those with larger grain sizes.346 In addition, Park and co-workers support this viewpoint that the domain size is a predominant factor for determining the Li+ conducting behaviors associated with the GB resistances of perovskite-type ISEs.279 Apart from these aforementioned methods, the augmentation of densification is likewise perceived to be an effective approach to considerably decrease the GB resistances.348
4.3 Origin of sur-/interfacial evolution
Undoubtedly, finely elucidating the fundamental origin of sur-/interfacial evolution that governs the ionic migration at the electrode–electrolyte interface will enable the exploration of interfacial chemistry, and provide constructive insights into the suppression of lithium dendrites and reduction of interfacial resistances.167,349–351 Next, we comprehensively sum up the latest investigations with respect to the origin of sur-/interfacial evolution against cathodes and anodes (mainly referring to Li metal), respectively.

4.3.1 Against cathodes. 
Oxide-based ISEs. 
In general, oxide-based SEs, such as NASICON-type and garnet-type materials are comparatively thermodynamically stable in the high potential range.90,131 Whereas, the lattice mismatch engendered by their inflexible nature together with the ubiquitous lattice volume change of cathodes upon cycling will lead to incompatibility problems. On the other hand, space-charge regions, as for oxide-based ISEs, play a less significant role. To identify intrinsic evolution near the electrode/electrolyte interface, Yamamoto and co-workers directly detected the potential distribution resulting from Li-ion diffusion (Fig. 13a).221 Importantly, quantitative analysis from this study allowed the fundamental sources of reaction resistance, and particularly kinetic factors controlling charge–discharge reactions at the interface to be identified. Inspired by this, a superior Li+ conducting buffer layer of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was coated onto the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode surface, and a well-matched interface was built. A gradual slope of potential formed at the interface could be responsible for the significantly improved interface dynamics.352 Unlike the stable crystal structure of NASICON-type ISEs, the interaction between the garnet-type LLZO and the LCO cathode gives rise to a framework transformation from the cubic to tetragonal phase at the interface, which can be ascribed to the occurrence of cross-diffusion of elements, especially Al, as graphically depicted in Fig. 13b.220 The phase distortion will worsen the electrochemical properties because of the low conductivity of the tetragonal phase; thus, a surface modification with Li3BO3 is meanwhile introduced. In order to reveal the structural evolution of LCO in an ASLB, Li and co-workers353 reported a method using a chip-based in situ transmission electron microscopy holder for in situ atomic-scale observation of electrochemical delithiation in an ASLB, which consisted of the LCO cathode, LLZO electrolyte and gold anode. The results showed that a pristine single crystal of LCO becomes nano-sized polycrystals connected by coherent twin boundaries and antiphase domain boundaries after high-voltage delithiation, which is wholly different from liquid electrolyte batteries. Besides this, they also proposed a lithium migration pathway before and after polycrystallization. But the corresponding formation mechanism still needs to be further clarified.353 In addition, DFT was further implemented to probe the electronic and atomic structures as well as the redistribution of ions at the interface between LLZO and LCO.354,355

Nitride-based ISEs. 
Recently, the formation and evolution of LCO–LiPON interfaces upon annealing, especially the reactions in terms of defect formation and energy levels, were studied using photoelectron spectroscopy by Hausbrand et al.309 Similar to oxide-based ISEs, an electrostatic potential gradient of 0.3 V was detected in the process of initial interface formation, as verified by band bending in the LCO (Fig. 13c). This gradient has been proven to be induced by the equilibration of the electrochemical potential of the Li+ traversing the interface, which can potentially propel the formation and migration of the oxygen vacancy, hence providing high reactivity even at relatively low temperatures. For further exploration, interfacial degradation reactions between LiPON and LixCoO2 were modeled by using electronic structure DFT calculations, implying that LiPON with P–N–P backbones are kinetically inert towards lithium at RT. By comparison, the migration of oxygen atoms from the low-energy LixCoO2 (104) surface to LiPON is much faster under ambient conditions.356 As expected, the LiPON electrolyte bears a wide voltage window and good interfacial compatibility with both cathodes and anodes, which enabled the formation of an all-solid-state Li/LiPON/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cell with outstanding electrochemical properties.26
Thio-LISICON-type ISEs. 
In comparison with oxide-based ISEs, thio-LISICON-type ISEs with an amorphous or crystalline feature are primarily thermodynamically unstable in the cathode potential range. Furthermore, when they are in direct contact with oxide cathodes, a space-charge layer at the interface would be formed.84,357 Tateyama and co-workers utilized calculations using DFT+U methods coupled with a systematic procedure for matching the solid–solid interface, to theoretically elucidate the mechanism of the space-charge layer by examining the interfaces between the LCO cathode and solid β-LPS electrolyte. They revealed that competition for Li-ion adsorption exists at the LCO/β-LPS interface, and the mobile Li ions in β-LPS move into energetically favorable sites in LCO, suggesting that the space-charge layer grows at the beginning of charging, thus leading to the interfacial resistance.357 The same research group further carried out an examination of mutual diffusion properties of cation elements at the LCO/β-LPS interface, as shown in Fig. 13d, confirming that the mixing of Co and P is energetically preferable to the unmixed states at this interface.358 Such unfavorable exchange can be dramatically suppressed through the interposition of a buffer layer (LiNbO3), resulting from a reduction of the Li depletion layer. Also, Sumita et al. theoretically confirmed the lithium depletion and oxidation on the sulfide side near the interface in the LiFePO4 (LFP)/β-LPS system, which was deemed the ultimate origin of the high interface resistance.359 Typically, Al-substitution for Co was proposed to be a beneficial strategy to weaken the electronic conduction of LCO and consequently bring down the space-charge layer effect.115,360 Apart from the dominant impact from the space-charge layer, additional side reactions originating from the interface are also an issue for certain thio-LISICON-type ISEs.109,361 Corresponding reflections about those side reactions can be acquired from a newly formed interfacial layer on the LCO/Li2S–P2S5 interface after charging, which is caused by mutual diffusion of the Co, P, and S elements (Fig. 13e).362 In fact, the suppression of the interfacial layer by surface modification is very helpful in enhancing the electrochemical properties of ASLBs.362–364
Argyrodite-type ISEs. 
Argyrodite-type ISEs, such as Li6PS5Cl, belong to sulfide-based systems, and face analogous challenges to the above-mentioned thio-LISICON-type ISEs.311,365 Recently, Seznec et al. systematically investigated the interfacial process and mechanism of Li6PS5Cl towards several typical cathode materials, including LCO, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM), and LiMn2O4. In good agreement with the proved side reactions, Li6PS5Cl is transformed into some by-products containing elemental sulfur, lithium polysulfides, P2Sx (x ≥ 5), phosphates, and LiCl at the interface.321 However, in spite of this interface reactivity, good capacity retention was gained in the NCM/argyrodite/Li cell over 300 cycles. Moreover, great efforts have been made to assess the interfacial evolution between Li6PS5Cl and the Li2S electrode so as to guide electrolyte–electrode interface design for future solid-state Li–S batteries. For this reason, Wagemaker et al. reported two-dimensional (2D) lithium-ion exchange NMR spectroscopy to evaluate spontaneous lithium-ion transport over the interface, as exhibited in Fig. 13f,349 suggesting that the interfacial conductivity strongly depends on the preparation method.


4.3.2 Against anodes. 
Among all the anodes, Li metal has the highest theoretical capacity of ∼3860 mA h g−1.366 Unfortunately, the adoption of rechargeable lithium metal batteries has not been achieved thus far, mainly due to safety concerns related to short circuits in liquid electrolytes. The emergence of ISEs is considered to be the most promising avenue to solve all the issues associated with Li-metal anodes. However, a huge family of ISEs is unstable when in direct contact with Li metal, and many strategies to tackle this issue have been purposefully developed.
As demonstrated before, the reduction of Ti4+ by Li metal is the main challenge for Ti-containing ISEs against Li-metal anodes.113,367 In the case of NASICON-type LATP, a reduction potential of 2.16 V against Li was estimated based on first-principles calculation results by Mo and co-workers.368 Moreover, the phase equilibria at 0 V or against the Li metal, corresponding to the products of the lithium reaction with Li metal, contain mainly Ti3P, TiAl, Li3P and Li2O. Since it is difficult to completely settle the trouble with Ti reduction, the substitution of Ge for Ti has been identified as a competitive solution.58 Recently, Kang et al. showed the chemical reactions arising from the direct contact of Li metal with an LAGP, showing that the Li metal is simply oxidized as soon as it comes into contact with LAGP, yielding the formation of Li2O, Li2O2, and Li2CO3 with the existence of C at the interface, as described in Fig. 14a.59 This newly formed interface bears an electronic conductivity which is relatively higher than its ionic conductivity, which has a profound influence on the electrical properties, mechanical integrity, and thermal stability of the solid-state cell. Furthermore, the electronic and ionic conductivities also play a vital role in deciding the electrochemical properties and dendrite growth, which was further demonstrated by Manthiram et al.369 To this end, an ultrasensitive 3D chemical analysis was employed to uncover the dynamic formation of interphases via the assembled Li/Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3/Li (Li/LYZP/Li) cell, as shown in Fig. 14b.369 Contrarily, this examination suggests that highly stable ISEs with metal anodes actually accelerate fast dendritic formation resulting from the lower Li consumption and much larger curvature of dendrite tips. Goodenough and co-authors also revealed that a Li+-conducting passivation layer containing Li3P and Li8ZrO6 is formed between the LiZr2(PO4)3 electrolyte and the lithium anode, which can enable the formation of an all-solid-state Li/LFP cell with good cyclability and a long cycle life.23

(h) X-ray photoelectron spectra recorded during deposition of 31 nm Li metal on the LGPS.374 Reproduced from ref. 374 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Usually, garnet-type ISEs possess a wide electrochemical window and good stability against Li metal.63,225 According to first-principles calculations, the reduction potential of c-LLZO has been assessed to be as low as 0.05 V, and the reduction products principally comprise Li2O, Zr3O, and La2O3.368 To find out more details, an in situ formation of the Li/c-LLZO interfaces inside an aberration-corrected scanning TEM was implemented in research by Ma et al.370 As a result, a 6 nm-thick interfacial tetragonal LLZO phase was detected to form on the surface of c-LLZO (Fig. 14b), which not only ensured the stability of c-LLZO against the reductive Li metal but maintained excellent ionic conduction. Furthermore, Hu and co-workers recently introduced a nondestructive and uniquely Li-sensitive technique, neutron depth profiling (NDP), to perceive the interfacial behavior between the garnet ISE and metallic Li, where a typical cross-sectional SEM image of the Li/garnet interface is shown in Fig. 14d.371 In addition, the influence stemming from the protonlithium exchange in garnets and the pore connectivity on the interfacial behaviors has also attracted enormous attention.372,373
Theoretically, thio-LISICON type ISEs, such as LGPS, began to be lithiated and reduced at ∼1.71 V against Li metal, and the interfacial by-products, including Li3P, Li2S, and Li15Ge4, were formed in the case of the phase equilibria of LGPS at 0 V.368 This predicted result is in good agreement with analysis concerning the reaction of LGPS with lithium metal conducted by Janek and co-workers374 using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. 14h) and time-resolved electrochemical measurements. The analysis manifested that the decomposition of LGPS gives rise to the formation of an interphase composed of Li3P, Li2S, and Li-Ge alloy. Lately, Li deficiency in ISEs has been proposed as a major culprit for high interfacial resistance. Aiming to establish the interrelation between Li deficiency and interfacial resistance, a 3D 7Li magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was applied to visualize the Li distribution at the interface (Fig. 14e).375 The resulting variations in Li concentration at the interfaces and in the bulk LGPS electrolyte with changes in 7Li MRI images, as shown in Fig. 14f and g, revealed that large amounts of Li run away at the Li/LGPS interface upon cycling, which was regarded as the leading cause for the expanding interfacial resistance. Significantly, an interfacial modification with a polymer film was successfully proposed to tremendously mitigate the Li depletion at the interfaces.375 Equally, the interface stability and evolution with regard to the LPS and Li2S–P2S5 systems have also been explored,351,376,377 providing preferential strategies for a reasonable design of the interfacial configuration and to strongly suppress the resistance and dendrites.
As for LiPON, Schwöbel et al.378 firstly reported the chemical reactions at the interface of LiPON and lithium metal, showing that the chemical reactions at the interface result in the emergence of coproducts consisting of Li3PO4, Li3P, Li3N and Li2O, which was in line with the conclusion from the first-principles calculations accomplished by Mo et al.350 However, the observation showed that the interface reactions disappear rapidly due to the formation of a passivation layer,378 which can prevent the further decomposition and reduction of LiPON.

4.4 Sur-/interfacial engineering
ASLBs offer dramatic superiority in terms of energy density and safety, as required for the large-scale production of electric vehicles. ISEs have been greatly boosted, where strategies to maximize the ionic conductivity have been widely focused upon. To date, an ionic conductivity of as high as ∼2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 can be achieved for certain thio-LISICON-type ISEs,21 which even rivals that of conventional liquid electrolytes. Nevertheless, it is well known that the key bottleneck troubling the application of ISEs is how to block Li-dendrite penetration and flexibility to enable ultralow interfacial resistance. Accordingly, a variety of sur-/interfacial engineering techniques have been presented, especially nanotechnology-based solutions. In the following subsection, the latest and representative strategies to diminish interfacial resistance and suppress lithium dendrites are summed up.

4.4.1 Strategies for diminishing interfacial resistance. 
Against cathodes. 
Despite the high ionic conductivity of garnet-type LLZO, the poor flexibility and occurrence of side reactions at the interface greatly hamper its practical applications. Therefore, various buffer layers have been attempted to realize an interface that has high ionic conductivity, is chemically stable and has wettability with both electrodes.379 Specifically, Wang and coworkers developed an innovative method to cut down the LCO/LLZO interfacial resistance by thermally soldering LCO and LLZO together through the reaction between the Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 solder and Li2CO3 coatings to form an Li2.3−xC0.7+xB0.3−xO3 interphase, as shown in Fig. 15a.380 The principal reason for this is that the entire division between LCO and LLZO cannot be fulfilled by simply adding a sintering additive, such as Li3BO3.220 As a consequence, a Li2CO3 coating layer with a thickness of around 30 nm uniformly covers the LLZO surface (Fig. 15b). A high cycling stability can be observed from the interphase-engineered Li/LLZO/LCO cell at 25 °C, which is maintained at around 83 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, as depicted in Fig. 15c.380 For the same purpose, Nan and co-workers combined LCO with a mixture of Li3BO3 (LBO) and In2O5Sn (ITO), where the former has a low melting point and the latter has high electrical conductivity, which were then assembled into an all-solid-state battery with an LCO–ITO–LBO/Ta-doped LLZO/Li configuration. Obviously, the interfacial resistance is decreased, especially at elevated temperature (80 °C).381 Adopting the same design, a composite cathode composed of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, In2(1−x)Sn2xO3, LBO, and polyvinylidene fluoride was tape-cast on Ta-doped LLZO (Fig. 15d),382 which could play an identically beneficial role. Notably, the interfacial resistances stemming from the decomposition of oxide ISEs can be considerably surmounted by stabilizing the solid electrolyte.383 For instance, the employment of Nb-doped LLZO can endow striking low interfacial resistance, which is comparable with that of the Li-ion batteries with liquid organic electrolytes.384,385

In effect, thio-LISICON type ISEs, that is, sulfide-based ISEs, come into good contact with the cathode under the conditions of a certain applied pressure. The main problems with the sulfide ISEs/cathode interface center on mutual diffusion, side reactions and the space-charge layer.84,360 A widely utilized approach is also the introduction of an interface buffer layer. One classic piece of research is that the 3D Li4Ti5O12 functions as an interposing layer between LCO and sulfide-based ISEs, leading to a dramatic reduction in space-charge layers and resistance, thus significantly improving the high-rate capability.386 Inspired by this, a comparable benefit can be obtained from other interface buffer layers with similar functions, such as LiNbO3,387 LiNb0.5Ta0.5O3,363 Li2SiO3,362 or Li2O–ZrO2.379
In contrast to ISEs, solid polymer electrolytes exhibiting better flexibility have great potential to overcome the drawback of inferior interfacial resistance. Thereby, the integration of ISEs and solid polymer electrolytes has been reasonably proposed to address the interface issues, and gives full play to their respective advantages.100,388 Most recently, Cui et al.389 successfully fabricated a mixture including poly(vinyl carbonate) and thio-LISICON Li10SnP2S12via in situ polymerization to ameliorate the rigid interface issues (Fig. 15d). In their studies, the interfacial impedance was substantially reduced; hence, the built LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4/composite electrolyte/Li cell delivered a high RT capacity of ∼130 mA h g−1 with a considerable capacity retention of ∼88% after 140 consecutive cycles, as shown in Fig. 15e. Another appealing hybrid electrolyte against the cathode is the union of LLZO and solid polymer electrolytes. In particular, the Li-ion pathways in this hybrid electrolyte have been revealed through the combination of selective isotope labeling and high-resolution solid-state Li NMR.390 Specifically, solid-state LFP|Li batteries or LiFe0.15Mn0.85PO4|Li batteries with hybrid electrolytes consisting of LLZO and solid polymer electrolytes, respectively, have been demonstrated to show higher discharge capacities and excellent cycling stability in comparison with a single LLZO assembled cell, which were presented by the Goodenough388 and Li groups.391 As noted, as for other reports on the utilization of hybrid solid-state electrolytes beyond the above-mentioned cases, readers can refer to several typical reviews published recently.84,100,109,392
In LiPON-based ASLBs, Tak et al. first reported a method coating a thin layer of Al2O3 upon the LCO surface to decrease the high resistance at the interface of LCO/LiPON, which can be put down to the formation of solid solution LiCo1−yAlyO2.393 Amazingly, a huge charge-transfer resistance (>1 × 107 Ω cm2) could be observed in a 5 V-class Li/LiPON/LiCr0.05Ni0.45Mn1.5O4−δ (LNM) battery arising from the greatly developed Li+-deficient layers at the LiPON-side of the interface that are caused by the large electric potential difference (Fig. 15g). To deal with this puzzle, Yada et al.394 deposited BaTiO3 nanoparticles onto LNM film, which enormously reduced the charge-transfer resistance from ∼1 × 107 to ∼2 × 103 Ω cm2. The rearrangement of the Li+ distribution and the emergence of “Li+ pathways” for charge-transfer reactions bear the major responsibility for this observation. An apparent enhanced rate capability with a discharge capacity of ∼100 mA h g−1 at 8 C rate was endowed, as described in Fig. 15h.
Against anodes. 
A main hurdle faced by the garnet-type LLZO is the poor contact with the Li-metal anode. Notably, the rigidity of the garnet will result in confined active sites and impractically large interfacial resistance, while relatively soft ISEs, such as sulfide-based electrolytes can avoid this issue. Now, the prevalent and effective strategies focus on engineering the surface of LLZO or introducing an additional interface with good wettability between the Li metal and garnet ISEs. In this field, significant progress has been made by Hu's,224,395 Chen's112 and Goodenough's groups335 by advanced coating nanotechnologies using various metals, semiconductors, and oxides. Recently, Hu et al. presented a strategy to engineer the garnet solid electrolyte and Li metal interface by forming an intermediary Li-metal alloy, as vividly shown in Fig. 16a.395 As a result, the wettability of the garnet surface was greatly modified and the interface resistance was tremendously reduced by more than an order of magnitude from ∼950 to ∼75 Ohm cm2. More significantly, dramatically improved wettability could be observed from the wetting behavior of the molten Li with t LLZO and Al-coated LLZO (Fig. 16b), rendering more stable cell performances for Li-ion, Li–S, and even Li–O2 batteries. Apart from the Li–Al alloy, Hu's group recently put forward a further innovative approach to reduce the garnet/Li-metal interfacial resistance by depositing an Li–Ge alloy layer with a thickness of 20 nm on LLZO (Fig. 16c).224 Similar to the results of the Li–Al alloy, the LLZO/Li-metal interfacial resistance decreased sharply from ∼900 to ∼115 Ω cm2 thanks to an alloying reaction between the metal Li and Ge, which was strongly confirmed by first-principles calculations. Additionally, the stable cycling properties of a Li/LLZO/LFP full cell were enabled by this unique Ge modification technique.224 Besides this, a sharp decrease in interfacial resistance can also be realized by coating an ultrathin layer of amorphous Si on LLZO via plasma-enhanced CVD, which is induced by an obvious change from superlithiophobic to superlithiophilic behavior because of the reaction between Li and Si.396 In particular, Hu and co-workers devised a one-step soldering technique to rapidly coat a molten Li–Sn alloy onto freshly-polished Nb and Ca-doped LLZO, leading to a tight and conformal contact between the Li–Sn alloy and the LLZO surface (Fig. 16d), thus unpredictably yielding an interfacial resistance of as low as ∼7 Ω cm2.397 This was mainly attributed to the obvious increase in the surface energy and the viscosity of molten Li.

Interestingly, Chen's group came up with an ultra-simple and valid approach to increase the interfacial contact between LLZO and Li metal merely by drawing a graphite-based soft interface with a pencil, as exhibited in Fig. 16e.398 Actually, a lithiated connection interface with better ionic and electronic conductivities was newly formed through the reactions between the graphite-based interfacial layer and Li metal (Fig. 16f), which was demonstrated by experimental analysis and theoretical calculations. Apparently, the impedance of symmetric Li cells drops considerably by virtue of this soft interface, as shown in Fig. 16g, which contributed to a solid-state full Li/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/treated-LLZO cell with superior rate and cyclic capability.398
As mentioned above, the design concept focuses on improving the wettability between LLZO and Li metal. Actually, certain inorganic compounds with good ionic conductivity or a mutual exchange reaction with LLZO have been certified to drastically decrease the interfacial impedance. Typically, the huge interfacial impedance between the Li anode and a garnet LLZO-based electrolyte can be effectively addressed by coating an ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) layer on the LLZO surface via ALD, as illustrated in Fig. 17a, which was first reported by Hu et al.399 This study revealed that the interfacial contact could be significantly improved due to the lithiation of an ALD–Al2O3 ultrathin layer on the LLZO surface (Fig. 17b). Moreover, the lithiated-alumina endows a faster Li-ion migration, hence leading to an ultralow interfacial resistance of ∼34 Ω cm2 (Fig. 17c). Furthermore, a tremendous reduction in interfacial impedance, from ∼1710 to ∼1 Ohm cm2, was proved with a calculation from stripping/plating tests, which was an enormous breakthrough in the advancement of ASLBs.399 Besides, an interface resistance of as low as ∼20 Ohm cm2 could be fulfilled by coating an ultrathin, conformal ALD-ZnO surface film, which was developed by Hu's group.400

Unlike Hu's contribution, Goodenough's group center their research on decreasing the amounts of by-products on the surface, which is largely responsible for the interfacial resistance at the interface. Goodenough's group employed LiF to enhance the stability of the garnet LLZT electrolyte against the moisture and carbon dioxide in air, benefiting from the strong ionic bond and insoluble nature in water of LiF.343 The work shows that the interfacial resistance apparently dropped from ∼1260 to ∼345 Ω cm2 after the addition of LiF, which enabled the ASLBs and a solid-state Li–S cell with a high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life. Similarly, a method to stabilize the LLZT/Li interface by importing Li3PO4 can greatly reduce the interfacial resistance, which was proposed by Liu's group.401 Just recently, Goodenough further confirmed that the major hurdles to LLZT are closely associated with a thick Li2CO3 layer and the Li–Al–O glass phase on the surface, which will block the Li-ion transport to a great extent.335 To completely remove Li2CO3 and suppress the formation of the Li–Al–O glass phase, Goodenough's group demonstrated a simple approach by reacting LLZT with carbon at 700 °C (Fig. 17d).335 Most significantly, the interfacial resistances including the Li/LLZT, LLZT/LFP, and LLZT/organic-electrolyte were enormously lowered to the levels of lithium-ion batteries with conventional organic electrolytes, as exhibited in Fig. 17e. Consistently, Sakamoto and co-workers cogently affirmed that the inferior wettability by Li and large interfacial impedance are mainly caused by the existence of surface impurities containing Li2CO3 and LiOH.336 For this reason, they thoroughly exploited the mechanism by which surface chemistry regulates the impedance of the LLZO/Li interface. Accordingly, an integrated method of wet polishing and heat-treatment was rationally designed to ultimately eliminate the surface contamination, strikingly resulting in a negligible interfacial resistance of ∼2 Ω cm2, much lower than that of traditional liquid electrolytes without the demand for extra coatings (Fig. 17f).336
Apart from the above-mentioned strategies, the introduction of additional interlayers with soft and deformable properties and high ionic conductivity has also been demonstrated to be an effective approach to minimize interfacial resistance. Recently, Hu et al. used a gel electrolyte as an interlayer between the LLZO-based electrolyte and solid electrodes to heighten their contact and decrease the interfacial resistance, as shown in Fig. 17g.402 As a consequence, the interfacial resistance of LLZO against the cathode and Li anode declined dramatically from ∼6.5 × 104 to ∼248 Ω cm2 and from ∼1.4 × 103 to ∼214 Ω cm2, respectively, as described in Fig. 17h. Thus, an LFP cathode-based full cell with a high capacity of ∼140 mA h g−1 and stable cyclic performance was achieved. Furthermore, the constructive effect contributed by a certain solid polymer as an interlayer between the ISEs and Li anode was also verified in NASICON-type and sulfide-based ISEs.403,404
Furthermore, the reduction in the grain sizes of LLZO by controlling the sintering technique has been demonstrated to be an effective way to achieve high Li-ion conductivities and a low interfacial resistance to the Li anode.195,242,346 Recently, Botros and co-workers presented a dense, fine-grained LLZO ceramic consisting of grains with a size in the range from 0.5 to 3 μm, which was prepared by a combination of nebulized spray pyrolysis and FAST.195 As a result, a total conductivity of the sample at RT was estimated at ∼0.33 mS cm−1; more significantly, a symmetrical Li/LLZO/Li cell showed good cycling stability and the corresponding interfacial resistance of the Li/LLZO interface was determined to be 76 Ω cm2. Consistently, Doeff and co-workers also suggested that LLZO with small grain sizes exhibits much lower interfacial resistance and better cycling behavior than that with larger grain sizes.346 However, the grain sizes of the LLZO reported by Doeff and co-workers346 were located in the range of 20–40 μm, obviously larger than the values reported by Botros and co-workers.195 The lower area specific resistance of 37 Ω cm2 was achieved even if the grain sizes reported by Doeff and co-workers were even larger, which could be ascribed to the influence of surface roughness. Hence, given this, further detailed studies should be made to determine the impact of surface roughness and grain size on the interfacial resistance.195
Apart from the far-ranging concerns about the interface between ISEs and Li metal, restrictions in terms of compatibility, contact and resistance also exist in other anode materials when matched with ISEs, such as the attractive Si and Li4Ti5O12 anodes.405–407 Specifically, a porous garnet electrolyte interface structure was ingeniously devised to achieve an enhanced Li+ transfer at the interface, rendering much smaller interfacial resistance.406


4.4.2 Strategies for suppressing lithium dendrites. 
As is known, the concrete progress of Li-metal batteries with conventional liquid electrolytes is hugely obstructed by the emergence of lithium dendrites, which are greatly prone to induce serious safety issues.408 To some extent, the substitution of liquid electrolytes by ISEs is an effective strategy to relieve this conundrum, which is always attributed to the unit Li+ transference number and high shear modulus. However, multiple research groups have recently shown that lithium dendrites can propagate where ISEs pair with a Li-metal anode, resulting in short circuiting and disabling of the batteries.346,401,409–411 Several other studies have further confirmed this observation.412–414 Contrary to this general understanding, Manthiram and co-workers have suggested that highly stable NASICON-type ISEs with Li/Na metal anodes in fact promote fast dendritic formation, which was ascribed to a larger curvature of the formed dendrite and lower consumption of dendrites.369 However, there is an exception, as aforementioned, thin-film batteries with Li-metal anodes paired with ISEs (e.g., LiPON) are able to avoid dendrite penetration, but an explanation has still not been put forward so far.26,28
Lately, an exhaustive comprehension of the essential formation mechanisms of Li dendrites against garnet-type LLZO and NASICON-type LATP ISEs was presented by Xiao's group,29 and the origin and evolution of the Li dendrite growth through these two ISEs were meanwhile elucidated. As has been demonstrated, the dendritic Li forms along the defects and phase boundaries vertical to the LLZO surface (Fig. 18a), which is motivated by the heterogeneous distribution of the surficial electrical field. In contrast, as for LATP, an SEI, similar to that formed in a liquid battery, arises between the LATP and Li metal, which is fostered by their interreactions (Fig. 18b).29,57 As a result, the continuous expansion of Li dendrites along the interface is effectively avoided due to its in-house consumption. To further substantiate this viewpoint, they developed a simple and facile “polishing” process without any treatment to fill Si nanoparticles into the LLZO surface structures, as shown in Fig. 18c, which can validly terminate the growth of Li dendrites, owing to the formation Li–Si alloys. Most importantly, the study fully demonstrated that the formed SEI-like interfacial layer between the Li and ISEs has a profound role in suppressing the growth of harmful Li dendrites.

In fact, prior to this study, several innovative tactics had been developed to maximally restrain the expansion of Li dendrites.27,168,347,372,401,409,415 In particular, Xu and co-workers presented a simple and convenient modification approach to inhibit lithium dendrites, as depicted in Fig. 18d, in which amorphous Li3OCl, acting as a binder, filler and bridge, is utilized to enclose the LLZO-based electrolyte particles, resulting in a consecutive ionic conductive network.415 And, the lithium dendrite during lithium plating/stripping is suppressed due to this constructed interfacial layer, enabling the derived symmetrical cell to show a stable cycling property without a short circuit (Fig. 18e). Achieving the equivalent result, Liu et al. put forward a strategy to stabilize the garnet/Li interface by introducing Li3PO4 as an additive in garnet-type ISEs, confirming that the existence of Li3PO4 can obviously enhance the interfacial compatibility and produce an extreme reduction in the formation of Li dendrites during Li-metal plating/stripping.401 For the same reason from the observations by Xiao et al.,29 a newly-induced self-limiting and ion-conducting interphase, Li3P, has been proven to be responsible for this outstanding interface stability. Furthermore, Guo's group ingeniously conceived a thin asymmetrical design of garnet-type ISEs to address this issue.168 A rigid ceramic layer modified with an ultrathin polymer was coated on the Li metal to accomplish dendrite-suppression of the Li anode; meanwhile, a soft polymer-layer was spread over the exterior and interior of the cathode to simultaneously render a connected interface, as shown in Fig. 18f. As a result, no distinct Li dendrites were observed even after lithium plating/stripping for 3200 h (Fig. 18g).168 In addition, Tsai et al. confirmed that the formation of Li dendrites is mostly due to inhomogeneous contact between the LLZO solid electrolyte and Li electrodes.409 Hence, a thin layer of Au buffer was rationally introduced to augment the interface contact, which can effectively eliminate the growth of Li dendrites. With respect to a study of the initial stages of Li dendrites, the relationship between Li segregation at the surface and LLZO particle morphology was provided via first-principles DFT,347,372 suggesting that Li segregation can be effectively curbed by regulating the ceramic synthesis conditions.
Apart from garnet-type ISEs, the Li dendrite issue has also been detected in Li2S–P2S5-based sulfide electrolytes at lower current densities compared to liquid electrolytes.27,28,416,417 Typically, the formation of Li dendrites leads to a rapid short circuit in an all-solid-state lithium metal battery with a sulfide-based Li2S–P2S5 electrolyte at current densities higher than 1 mA cm−2,416,417 while the lithium-metal anode is still able to cycle hundreds of hours at 2 mA cm−2 without shorting in a conventional liquid electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC).418 Hence, this signifies that sulfide-based ISEs (thio-LISICON-type) are prone to accelerate rather than inhibit the formation of Li dendrites compared with liquid electrolytes. Unfortunately, so far, the intrinsic mechanism for the accidental dendrite formation is still ambiguous, resulting in no valid strategy being proposed to control the Li dendrite growth in sulfide-based ISEs.28 To the best of our knowledge, up to now, there have only been two relevant studies on the inhibition of Li dendrites for sulfide-based ISEs.27,416 The first one states that the critical current density, at which dendrite formation leads to a short circuit, of 75Li2S–25P2S5 can be raised after hot pressing, due to the formation of a highly conductive phase and enhancement in adhesion between particles.416 However, the critical current density of the hot-pressed 75Li2S–25P2S5 is nonetheless confined to 1 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that in liquid–electrolyte Li-ion batteries. The second one, attempting to suppress dendrite formation at a large current, was researched by Wang's group, where the incorporation of LiI into Li2S–P2S5 glass was proven to effectively tune the constituents of the SEI-like layers at the Li/ISEs interface, tremendously inhibiting the formation of Li dendrites.27 The main reason is that the unique utilization of LiI with a high ionic conductivity but electronic insulation, which can facilitate the mobility of Li ions, promotes Li deposition at the interface, and thus inhibits the growth of Li dendrites. As a consequence, the critical current density is enhanced dramatically, achieving 3.90 mA cm−2 at 100 °C after adding 30 mol% LiI (LPS30I). Therefore, ultra-stable cycling properties of the assembled Li–Li battery were realized at 1.50 mA cm−2 at 100 °C for 200 h, as shown in Fig. 18h.27 Overall, in view of the unclear mechanisms and scarcity of strategies concerning sulfide-based ISEs, an in-depth elucidation of the mechanisms by combining theoretical and experimental approaches and an extensive exploration of novel methods would undoubtedly hugely propel the practical applications of ASLBs.

5. Summary and future perspectives
In conclusion, the development and latest progress of ISEs, including their basic structure, ionic transport mechanism and typical innovative approaches to improve ionic conductivity are firstly summarized. Principally we pay further attention to the origin, challenges and solutions of sur-/interfacial evolution, which are highly critical to the physical and electrochemical properties of ASLBs. Convincingly, by virtue of their high energy density and potential safety, ASLBs could have a significant impact upon our future lives. Nevertheless, more unremitting efforts should be made to boost substantial advances in ISEs for commercially feasible ASLBs. Herein, we expectantly use our own comprehensions to propose some perspectives.
Firstly, it is a prerequisite in the evaluation of ISEs to have a high ionic conductivity rivaling that of conventional liquid electrolytes. To date, existing ISEs have not yet achieved adequate ionic conductivity along with other criteria. Therefore, an integrated, in-depth approach based on experimental and theoretical modeling, together with advanced characterization techniques, should be conducted to rationally tune the bulk framework and further uncover their intricacies, if ionic migration mechanisms are to be urgently developed. In particular, it will take us uninterrupted and huge effort to explore a simple and convenient method at low temperatures to prepare garnet-type LLZO with high bulk ionic conductivity and a stable cubic phase.
Secondly, as for garnet LLZO, several modified samples have yielded superior ionic conductivity, yet their extreme sensitivity to the ambient atmosphere leads to a high interfacial resistance, which remains the premier obstacle to and greatly restricts their large-scale utilization. Therefore, an ultimate elucidation of the origin of the formation of the insulative layer, the associated chemical/electrochemical behaviors and atomic-scale structural/compositional evolution is urgently required, thus providing sufficient guidance to put forward a more efficient and low-cost strategy for improving the sur-/interfacial stability. Similarly, all of these challenges still exist in sulfide-based ISEs, where certain unique anti-moisture methods should be developed based on theoretical calculation and simulation, thus probably avoiding its preparation and usage in just an inert atmosphere.
Thirdly, in order to obtain ultralow interfacial resistance at the cathode|ISE and metallic lithium|ISE interfaces, various strategies, particularly those focused on nanotechnology, have been extensively developed. Remarkable results have been achieved, especially concerning those between garnet LLZO and Li metal. In the future, some attention should be paid to other ISEs, including rigid NASICON-type and anti-/perovskite-type, to increase the contact with cathodes and Li-metal anodes. Most importantly, rational optimization of the sluggish interfacial kinetics between ISEs and electrodes should be persistently conducted. In addition, the induced volumetric change at the Li-metal side by repeated plating/stripping inevitably results in worse electronic contact and larger resistance, which requires suitable methodologies to cope with them.
Fourthly, the existence of Li dendrites in certain sulfide-based electrolytes logically accounts for their inferior electrochemical properties at high current densities. However, the detailed mechanism for dendrite formation in sulfide-based ISEs is still far from clear, and few effective strategies for inhibiting Li dendrite growth have been reported. Therefore, an in-depth yet general understanding of the formation mechanisms of Li dendrites by resorting to theoretical and experimental approaches and an extensive exploration of novel methods are of extreme significance to propel the substantial utilization of sulfide-based ISEs for ASLBs tremendously forward.
Undoubtedly, the current achievements are encouraging for various batteries based on SEs, in particularly for ISEs. It is also widely believed that the elegant realization of ISEs with indispensable parameters will make it possible for novel battery chemistries and sophisticated, affordable battery systems that will definitely revolutionize the present rechargeable field beyond Li-containing batteries. Therefore, various advanced secondary batteries will be obtained with large energy density and high safety, along with no self-discharge and long-span cycle lives.
