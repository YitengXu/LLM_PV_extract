    , Accepted 31st May 2013First published on 21st June 2013AbstractWe report on the synthesis and photoelectrochemical characterization of photocathodes based on CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opals (IOs). Compared to the NiO–CdS nanowire mesh IO electrode, the hole diffusion coefficient of the CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh IO photocathode was one order of magnitude larger, indicating that the Ni core facilitated hole transfer in nanostructured p-type electrodes. As a result, the charge-collection efficiency of the Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh IO electrode was shown to be essentially 100%.
Introduction
Tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices composed of a n-type semiconductor photoanode in series with a p-type semiconductor photocathode have recently been proposed as a low cost, high efficiency concept for solar fuels production.1 It is crucial that p-type semiconductor photocathodes be developed if tandem PEC structures are to be achieved. In general, the PEC devices, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), consist of n-type metal oxides including TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2. The high efficiency (11–12%) of these laboratory scale devices reflects the bulk of research performed on such n-type devices.2 On the other hand, the highest reported efficiencies (ca. 1.3%) of p-type DSSCs based on p-type nickel oxide (NiO, Eg = 3.5 eV) nanoparticle film are still relatively low.3 There has been much effort to increase the conversion efficiency by controlling the crystallinity and shape of NiO electrodes,4–6 improving transport properties,7,8 developing more effective sensitizing dyes for p-NiO,9 and utilizing alternative p-type wide bandgap oxides.10,11 The poor performance of p-DSSCs versus their n-type congeners has been attributed to non-optimized device components (photocathode, sensitizer, redox mediator, and counter electrode) and energy-loss processes (e.g., charge recombination).12–15 The p-type NiO nanoparticle photocathode,16 in particular, is known to have a low hole diffusion rate, which limits the use of NiO films above 2 μm thickness17 required for adequate light absorption by adsorbed dyes. To address this issue, here we report the development of a photocathode with a “core-shell” structure that provides a mechanism for fast hole diffusion through the nanostructred NiO material. Inasmuch as NiO does not absorb visible light (owing to its wide bandgap Eg of 3.5 eV), a thin layer of cadmium sulfide (CdS, Eg = 2.42 eV)18 was introduced by chemical bath deposition to increase the visible light absorption of the NiO photoelectrode. A similar core-shell concept involving a hybrid TiO2-carbon nanofiber has been demonstrated for n-DSSCs.19 A nanostructured charge transfer core has also been demonstrated for hematite-based PEC cells.20 But to date this core-shell structure has not been applied for p-DSSCs. Here, we demonstrate that the CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opal electrode improves the hole transport rate of otherwise poorly conducting p-NiO nanowire mesh inverse opal electrodes.
Experimental
Material preparations
Polystyrene (PS) colloid spheres with an average diameter of 400 nm (Seradyn, CMPS) were used to form a template for depositing Ni/NiO photonic crystal structure onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates as described previously.21 Thin Ti (20 nm) and Au (70 nm) layers prepared by e-beam evaporation were deposited on FTO substrates to ensure mechanical stability of electrodeposited films. Before depositing the PS bead template, Au-coated FTO substrates were treated in a 10 mM 1,2-ethanedithiol (Aldrich, 90%) solution in ethanol overnight to aid adhesion of the PS beads. A three-electrode configuration consisting of a working electrode constructed of a PS template on Au-coated FTO, a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a counter electrode made of a platinum mesh was used for deposition of Ni and Ni(OH)2.
A nickel metal inverse opal was electrochemically prepared within the pore space of PS opal films. A mixture of 2.1 M NiSO4·6H2O, 0.35 M NiCl2·6H2O, and 0.43 M H3BO3 solutions was used as the electroplating solution as described previously.22 Ni metal (2 μm) was deposited potentiostatically at −1 V for 10 min after the electrolyte was purged with nitrogen for 10 min to minimize the presence of oxygen. The PS template was then dissolved in dimethyl formamide (DMF) at 120 °C for 3 h. Following template dissolution, samples were rinsed using acetone solvent several times. To ensure complete removal of all organic residues, the samples were cleaned in the 0.5 M HCl solution for a 3–4 min and rinsed several times with water. Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) was prepared by the electrodeposition onto Ni metal inverse opals from 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solutions under galvanostatic conditions (−1 mA cm−2, 5 min, with slow stirring).23 The resulting Ni(OH)2-coated Ni metal electrodes were then annealed at 300 °C for 1 h under air to form the Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opal electrode (abbreviated as the Ni–NiO electrode). As a control sample, we also prepared a NiO inverse opal nanowire mesh electrode (abbreviated as the NiO electrode) by complete thermal oxidation of Ni inverse opal films at 550 °C for 30 min in air under ambient conditions.24
The CdS layer was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) in a solution containing 2 mM CdSO4, 10 mM thiourea, and 1 M NH4OH aqueous solution.25 With the sample placed vertically along the wall of beaker, the reaction was carried out at 60 °C for 20 min. Over this time period, the as-prepared transparent solution turned to a yellowish color indicative of CdS. Samples were then rinsed in water and dried in the air. To remove the reaction residue on the surface and enhance the crystallinity of as-deposited CdS layer, heat treatment at 250 °C for 1 h under N2 was performed.26
The prepared nanowire mesh electrodes were placed over the semitransparent counter electrodes prepared by spreading a droplet of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol onto a TEC 15 conducting glass substrate and subsequently annealing at 380 °C for 30 min. Devices were prepared by sealing the working and counter electrodes with a 50 μm-thick Surlyn (Dupont, USA) hot-melt ring. Finally, a droplet of redox electrolyte composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in 7:3 H2O:methanol (v/v)27 was infiltrated into the space between the electrodes via one of two pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode. The redox reactions of the polysulfide electrolyte has been discussed previously.28 Finally, the two holes on the counter electrodes were sealed with a thermoplastic and a cover glass.
Characterization
The photoelectrochemical characteristics were analyzed using a Keithley Model 236 source measure unit under a simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiance with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 that was calibrated using Si reference solar cell fitted with a Schott KG-5 filter. The cells were masked with black tape to mark off an active area of about 0.5 cm2. Light was incident upon the counter electrode side of the cell due to the non-transparent working electrode. The IPCE was measured under short-circuit conditions using a tungsten lamp source with an intensity of about 100 mW cm−2. Transport and recombination properties were measured by IMPS and IMVS as detailed previously.29 For these measurements, the cells were probed with a modulated beam of 500 nm light superimposed on a relatively large background (bias) illumination. To analyze the surface morphology of inverse opal structure, a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7000F) equipped with a Genesis energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted with a FEI F20 equipped with an EDS analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Scintag DMS-2000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. An ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) was utilized to measure the absorbance of samples in air.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents a simple scheme describing the structure concept along with the expected direction of charge flow in a CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opal electrode in the polysulfide electrolyte. Fig. 1a shows the injection and transport pathways of photogenerated holes on the energy band diagram consisting of a metallic Ni core, a semiconducting NiO shell, and a CdS sensitizer. Under illumination, photogenerated holes from the CdS layer are injected into the valence band of NiO owing to the large driving force provided by the difference in the valence band edge potentials of CdS and NiO. Following injection into NiO, holes are then transferred to the Ni core layer and finally collected at the FTO substrate. Photogenerated electrons are scavenged by polysulfide electrolyte that fills the pores of the inverse opal film. Fig. 1b presents a cross-sectional schematic of the structure, arranged in a hexagonal closed-packed array, showing the pathway of a hole through the nanowire mesh photoelectrode. The NiO shell (and CdS layer) could completely insulate the Ni metal core from the polysulfide electrolyte, potentially mitigating one source of recombination and providing a good conductive pathway for hole transport.

Fig. 2a shows the polystyrene bead template used to prepare electrodeposited inverse opal Ni/NiO films. The PS template exhibits the expected a hexagonal close-packed structure. Fig. 2b shows the well-ordered Ni inverse opal structure resulting from electrodeposition of Ni metal within the pore space of the polystyrene template in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2c shows that the structure retains the well-ordered face-centered cubic (fcc: ABCABC) lattice following deposition of the NiO shell layer (formed by electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2 on the Ni inverse opal structure and subsequent annealing). Analyses of the SEM images show that deposition of the NiO shell resulted in about 10% reduction of the pore size relative to the original pore diameter of the Ni inverse opal (370 nm), providing evidence that a uniform NiO coating is formed. The inverted bright-field TEM view (Fig. 2d) shows that the inverse opal structure is indeed comprised of the nanowire mesh and pores. In the high magnification view focusing on the core-shell pore at the interfacial region (Fig. 2e), the concentration profile of Ni and O and compositional distribution in the points p1 and p2 were analyzed through EDS line and point scan analyses to determine the boundary between the core and the shell. The black line in Fig. 2e indicates that the electron beam was scanned from the outer shell to the inner core. The EDS results of Ni/O atomic percent displayed in the inset of Fig. 2e demonstrate that oxygen is most prevalent <20 nm from the edge of the shell region. Therefore, we estimate that the thickness of NiO layer is approximately 20 nm. Also, Fig. 2e,f confirms that the nanowire mesh electrode is a Ni core surrounded by a thin NiO shell. Throughout the scan, the oxygen level is never reduced to zero, indicating a continuous coating of NiO on the Ni core. Additionally, the EDS analyses of points p1 and p2 further demonstrate that, although both the shell (p1) and core (p2) regions contain Ni and O, the intensity of Ni peak in the core region is quadrupled relative to that of the shell region, consistent with a continuous NiO layer. These results also confirm that electrodeposition and thermal oxidation treatments can be successfully used to prepare a Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh IO electrode.

The XRD spectra of a Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh IO electrode on Au/Ti/FTO substrate are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The as-deposited Ni nanowire mesh IO electrode (Fig. 3a) is a face-centered cubic crystalline system as evidenced by the strong (111) and (200) reflections (JCPDS 04-0850).30 For the Ni–NiO electrode, the rock salt structured NiO phase with weak signals of (200), (111) and (220) reflections (JCPDS 04-0835)31 coexist with the Ni phase. These weak NiO peaks are consistent with the formation of thin oxide layer, which further supports the core-shell structure.

Fig. 3 shows the change in surface morphology of the Ni–NiO core-shell and (control sample) NiO nanowire mesh IO electrodes following the deposition of the sensitizer CdS. Analyses of the SEM images show that deposition of a CdS layer (∼20 nm) does not change the morphology of inverse opals substantially, but it does decrease the pore size of inverse opals from 350 nm to 300 nm. Furthermore, the SEM images reveal that the CdS was uniformly coated on the Ni–NiO electrodes. In addition, Fig. 3d shows the absorption spectrum of the CdS deposited via CBD on a FTO substrate. The Ni–NiO electrode was not used because the Ni–NiO structure was deposited on a non-transparent Au coated FTO substrate. The absorption spectrum revealed a bandgap of 2.3 eV, which is consistent with that of the bulk CdS material (Eg = 2.42 eV). In addition, TEM images of CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO electrode (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the deposited CdS layer exhibits the cubic structure with lattice spacing (3.33 Å) corresponding to (111) plane (JPCDS 80-0019).32 Finally, EDS analysis of this sample confirmed the expected presence of the highest concentrations of Cd and S at the surface of the NiO particles (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 4 presents the time constants (τ) as a function of the short-circuit photocurrent density Jsc (Jsc ∝ incident light intensity) in the CdS-sensitized NiO and Ni–NiO electrodes measured by intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopies (IMPS/IMVS). The time constants for charge transport are nearly constant through the entire range of Jsc, whereas the time constants for charge recombination show a power-law dependence on the light intensity. These results are consistent with the studies of p-DSSCs.33,34 The hole diffusion coefficient (D) can be estimated using the expression D = w2/(2.35τc), where w is the thickness of the NiO film and τc is the transport time constant.16 From the film thickness (2 μm) and transport time constants (1.2 × 10−2 s and 9.1 × 10−4 s for NiO and Ni–NiO electrodes, respectively), we estimate that the hole diffusion coefficients of NiO and Ni–NiO electrodes were 1.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, respectively. Thus, the value of D in the core-shell structure is about one order of magnitude larger than that in the NiO nanowire mesh IO film. It is worthwhile to mention that the value of D for the CdS sensitized NiO nanowire mesh IO film in this study is substantially slower than that for the CdS sensitized NiO nanoparticle film in a previous study.8 This is likely caused by the difference in the material property of NiO electrodes prepared with different approaches in these studies. The improved hole diffusion rate observed for the Ni–NiO electrode is attributable to the rapid charge conduction through the metal core. Thus, in the case of the NiO electrode, we conclude that following the initial hole injection from the CdS to NiO, the hole flow occurs solely through the semiconducting NiO medium. For the Ni–NiO electrode, the results imply that following the initial hole injection from the CdS to NiO and the hole transfer from the NiO shell to the Ni core, the hole flow occurs through the metallic Ni layer.
 Fig. 4  Time constants as a function of Jsc for CdS-sensitized NiO (black circle) and Ni–NiO (red circle) electrodes in the polysulfide electrolyte. The τr and τc are the recombination and transport time constants, respectively. 
Over the range of light intensities, the hole recombination time constants (lifetimes), measured at open circuit, varied from 1 × 10−1 to 9 × 100 s for the NiO and from 6 × 10−2 to 2.5 × 100 s for the Ni–NiO core-shell inverse opal nanowire mesh electrodes. These values agree well with recent studies on dye/semiconductor sensitized p-type NiO photocathodes.8,17 Charge-collection efficiency is determined by the competition between charge transport and recombination. When the recombination time constant τr is substantially larger than the transport time constant τc, the charge-collection efficiency ηcc can be calculated by ηcc = 1 − (τc/τr).35 As a result of the increased transport times and similar lifetimes, the charge-collection efficiency of CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh electrode is improved relative to the NiO nanowire mesh electrode. Considering the difference in the internal quasi-Fermi level between short circuit (for measuring τc) and open circuit (for measuring τr),36 and the fact that τr is more than two orders of magnitude longer than τc for the Ni–NiO sample over the entire light intensity range, the actual ηcc at short circuit is essentially 100%. In contrast, CdS-sensitized NiO inverse opal film showed that the ηcc ranged from 92–99% (dependent on the illumination intensity) using the procedure described above. The longer transport times through the NiO layer than through the Ni core leads to an increased loss from charge recombination between photogenerated holes in NiO layer and electrons in the polysulfide electrolyte.
Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the IPCE spectrum and current density-voltage (J–V) curve of the CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh IO electrode in a polysulfide electrolyte. An IPCE value of over 3.5% at 400 nm is achieved. The same electrode without the sensitizer shows an IPCE value of essentially 0% over the scanned wavelengths, demonstrating that photogenerated holes are injected from CdS into the NiO layer and subsequently transported through the nanowire mesh. The J–V curve shows a low overall efficiency of 0.016% (Voc of 0.33 V, Jsc of 0.3 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 16.5%). Given the unity charge-collection efficiency, the low performance can be attributable to several factors including non-optimized redox electrolyte for slow ion conduction,13 low catalytic activity in the polysulfide electrolyte at the Pt counter electrode,37 and/or low light-harvesting efficiency owing to the use of non-transparent Ni core metal, which could block the incident light (to some degree) from reaching CdS. Optimizing the thicknesses of the Ni core, NiO shell, and/or CdS sensitizer layer could further improve the electrode performance. Despite this low conversion efficiency, this metal-metal oxide core-shell electrode structure is shown to improve hole diffusion in metal oxides with otherwise poor hole conductivity.
Conclusions
In summary, a core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opal photocathode was prepared by electrodeposition of a Ni metal inverse opal followed by Ni(OH)2 deposition and subsequent annealing to NiO. Analytical techniques (HR-TEM, EDS and XRD) demonstrated that the thin NiO layer is about 20 nm thick. A thin CdS layer (ca. 20 nm) was used as a visible light sensitizer to explore the hole dynamics in the Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh inverse opal electrode. IMPS and IMVS measurements demonstrated that CdS-sensitized Ni–NiO core-shell nanowire mesh electrode exhibits a hole diffusion coefficient that is one order of magnitude greater than that of a CdS-sensitized NiO nanowire mesh inverse opal film with no metal core. Consequently, this core-shell nanowire mesh results in a charge-collection efficiency of 100%. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for facilitating hole transfer in nanostructured p-type electrodes that can be applied to a range of optoelectronic devices.
