, Accepted 27th June 2023First published on 27th June 2023AbstractMetal oxide semiconductors have emerged as promising candidates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to replace conventional noble metal substrates. Here, we demonstrate an insulator to quasi-metallic phase transition in electron-rich WO3 doped with group 1 elements (H, Li, Na, and K) to amplify the Raman response of adsorbed probe molecules. In this category, the lithium-doped WO3 (LWO) exhibited excellent balance between SERS sensitivity and photostability, with enhancement factors (EFs) up to 4.3 × 106 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 10−8 M. Based on theoretical simulations and advanced experimental characterizations, we identified its non-discrete band arrangement and high free carrier concentration (1.3 × 1021 cm3), which create not only efficient migration channels for interfacial charge-transfer (CT) enhancement, but also a surface localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect-induced strong electromagnetic field that further amplified the Raman response via an electromagnetic (EM) mechanism. Our strategy greatly refines and expands the scope of existing metal oxide materials, offering new insights for designing efficient and robust non-noble metal-based SERS substrates.
1. Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is emerging as a powerful analytical tool for non-destructive structural analysis that is capable of instantaneously amplifying Raman signals by several orders of magnitude, providing highly sensitive and accurate fingerprint information.1–3 The working mechanism usually encompass electromagnetic (EM) enhancement and charge-transfer (CT) enhancement.4 The former arises from the collective oscillation of free electrons with the incident light at the substrate–analyte interface, where highly concentrated “hot spots” are generated by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), effectively increasing the Raman scattering cross-sections.5 The latter is in turn governed by photoinduced charge transfer (PICT), whose efficiency relies on the molecular polarization tensor through Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling.6 In general, the EM mechanism is the most important and dominant, and also the one that amplifies the Raman response most strongly.7,8 However, the carrier density in semiconductors is much lower than that of metals, and their oscillation frequencies are normally in the infrared region. Consequently, SERS realized by the EM mechanism is difficult to occur but mainly dominated by the CT process in semiconductors.9,10 There is broad consensus that the aim to overthrow the monopoly of noble metals in the current SERS field poses formidable methodological challenges in the design of novel and reliable non-noble metal substrates.
Most metal oxides have an abundant tunability of the morphology/lattice/band structure and chemical inertness, making them ideal and versatile next-generation SERS substrates. Some materials, like MoOxSy,11 TiO2,12 Cu2O,13 MoO3,14 and ZnO,15 have been reported to exhibit SERS activity, and relevant application scenarios in biomedical imaging, trace analysis, and in situ reaction monitoring have been developed,16–21 along with the recent highlights of SERS chips and biology kits for SARS-CoV-2.22–24 The band gap energy (Eg) present between the conduction and valence band is large and the lack of charge-transfer tunneling makes the CT process insufficient. The SERS sensitivity of metal oxides can be improved by introducing oxygen vacancies,25 downsizing to ultrathin nanosheets,26 amorphization,27 or other sophisticated approaches. Enhancement of the Raman signal of adsorbed molecules on metal oxides is mainly through a CT mechanism. Whereas numerous metastable defects are often incorporated during the synthetic procedure, which tend to be easily oxidized, resulting in a collapse of the crystal structure and degradation of the SERS performance in long-term operation.25,28,29 There is still an urgent need for a practical and feasible technique to construct robust metal oxides for efficient SERS via CM or EM or via a synergistic mechanism of both.14,30
The incorporation of charge effects induced by electronic doping is considered as an effective strategy of tailoring the fundamental optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties of materials.31–34 For semiconductors devoid of free charge carriers, the dopant-induced charge effects can modify the band structure and redox potential of the Fermi level (Ef) to meet the requirements for efficient SERS substrates. It has been demonstrated that the group 1 elements (H, Li, Na, and K) with small ionic radii can be easily intercalated into the interlayer or channels of a host lattice, thus generating significant charge effects while maintaining structural integrity.35,36 For instance, hydrogen-doped MoO3 with different work functions can achieve reversible charge extraction and transfer in solar cells.37 Li-doped TiO2 forms polarized charge centers with established internal built-in electric fields to separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs.38 H+-ion intercalation can reduce the electronic resistance of WO3 by two orders of magnitude and has been applied in wearable devices for sweat pH monitoring.39 These facts imply that electronic doping can efficiently retrofit the band structure and reverse the unfavorable drawbacks, providing the latest opportunities to address the dilemma of metal oxides in SERS-related applications being limited by their inherent wide band gaps.
In this work, we implemented an electronic doping of WO3 with H, Li, Na, and K through a metal salt solution treatment under mild condition, which not only could ensure a uniform distribution of dopants but also substantially allow tuning the electronic properties. We used the doped WO3 as the SERS substrate and R6G as the probe molecule at different dye concentrations. In assessing the enhancement factors (EFs) and photostability, Li-doped WO3 (LWO) was the optimal, exhibiting a consistent EF of 4.3 × 106 with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 × 10−8 M. First-principles calculations and charge-kinetics characterization suggested that the Li-dopants generated new electron-occupying states within the band gap, serving as springboards for electronic transitions to open up charge-transfer channels at the substrate–analyte interface. In contrast, the SERS by H, Na, and K doping was much weaker due to limited electron-transfer capacity or structural instability. Therefore, LWO integrated metrics of both semiconducting and metallic materials, with a free carrier concentration up to 1.3 × 1021 cm−3 to sustain the LSPR effect, amplifying the Raman signal through a synergistic CM and EM mechanism. The bare WO3 lacks the above-mentioned key features for enhancing the Raman response due to its carrier concentrations being below 1019 cm−3.
2. Methods
2.1 Sample preparation
The WO3 nanoparticles were commercially obtained from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The other chemical reagents were analytical grade and used as received without purification. We synthesized the quasi-metallic WO3 doped with group 1 elements by using a wet chemical reaction. In a typical reaction, 1 g of WO3 was dispersed in 30 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl) or metal salt solutions (LiCl, NaCl, KCl) at a concentration of 4 M using mild sonication. Under continuous stirring (1200 rpm), 0.15 g of metal zinc was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h. The final black products were collected and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol three times to remove any adsorbed impurity ions, and then vacuum dried at 60 °C for further characterization.
2.2 Materials characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a field-emission scanning electron microscopy system (SU8220). The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Model2501) in the region of 200 to 1200 nm, with BaSO4 used as the reflectance standard. 1H and 7Li solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained with a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker) at 298 K. Fluorescence spectroscopy (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were detected on an FLS920 spectrometer. SERS measurements were carried out using a Renishaw inVia Raman (UK) microscope with a 532 nm laser, and the light power set at 1 mW, and the Raman spectra were obtained with a 1 s acquisition time unless otherwise specified.
2.3 Determination of the band gap from the absorption spectrum
The band gap energy (Eg) is an important characteristic parameter of semiconductor materials that is mainly determined by the electronic structure. It reflects the strength the valence electrons are bound, indicating the minimum energy required to create intrinsic electronic excitation. Here, we used the UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to measure the Eg value, whereby the relationship between the optical band gap and absorption coefficient is given by:αhν = B(hν − Eg)mwhere α is the molar absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, ν is the incident photon frequency, B is the proportionality constant, and the value of m is related to the transition type of the semiconductor. When m = 1/2, 3/2, 2 and 3, it corresponds to the allowable dipole transition of a direct bandgap semiconductor, forbidden dipole transition of a direct bandgap semiconductor, transition allowed in an indirect bandgap semiconductor, and forbidden semiconductor of an indirect bandgap, respectively. WO3 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor and allows the electronic transition, which means its m value is 2. According to the above formula, if setting hν as the x-axis and αhν/m as the y-axis, when y = 0, the tangent of the reverse extension curve intersects the x-axis, and then the optical bandgap value Eg of a semiconductor material can be obtained.
2.4 Measurements of the flat-band potential and charge-carrier density
The flat-band potential Vfb was estimated by extrapolating the Mott–Schottky plot of WO3 and LWO. The charge-carrier density Nd depends on the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, and the relationship to describe the Mott–Schottky plot can be given as:   where C is the specific capacitance (F cm−2), which is negatively correlated with the carrier concentration; e is the charge of an electron (equal to 1.60 × 10−19 C); ε is the dielectric constant of WO3 samples (equal to 20); ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), V is the applied potential (V); k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1); and T is the absolute temperature (Kelvin scale). The relationship between the Fermi level and flat-band potential (Vfb) can be written as:Ef = −eVfbwhere e is the elementary charge. The potential conversion relationship between the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated KCl solution) is:ESHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V
The absolute potential value for SHE is taken as −4.5 V. Therefore, the Fermi level in reference to the vacuum can be calculated as:Ef,vacumn = e[−4.5 − (Vfb,Ag/Ag/Cl + 0.197)] V
By combining the XPS valence band spectra and diffuse reflectance spectra, it is possible to calculate the discrepancy between Ef and VBM and the corresponding Eg. This approach thus enables the energy level determination of Vfb and Ef, as well as the VBM and CBM.
2.5 Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements
Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements were performed on a Helios pump–probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) under ambient conditions. The output pulse was split into two beams. The first beam was used to generate 400 nm laser pulses by second harmonic generation through a nonlinear optical crystal, which acted as the excitation pulse. The second beam with weaker energy was focused on a CaF2 plate (4 mm thickness) to generate a white-light continuum as the probe. The time delay between the pump beam and the probe pulse was controlled by a motorized delay stage. The 400 nm pump pulses (∼800 nJ per pulse) were delivered by an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-800 fs), which was excited by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite-1K-HE; center wavelength 800 nm, pulse duration 35 fs, pulse energy 3 mJ, repetition rate 1 kHz) seeded with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser system (Micra 5) and pumped with a 1 kHz Nd:YLF laser (Evolution 30). In femtosecond time-resolved TA measurements (using the Helios system), the white-light continuum (WLC) probe pulse was generated by focusing the 800 nm beam (split from the regenerative amplifier with a tiny portion, ∼0.4 μJ per pulse) onto a sapphire plate. A reference beam split from the WLC was used to correct the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the WLC. The time delays (within 8 ns) between the pump and probe pulse was varied by a motorized optical delay line. The temporal and spectral profiles (chirp-corrected) of the pump-induced absorbance change of the samples were registered using an optical fiber-coupled multichannel spectrometer and further processed using Surface Xplorer software. The samples were well dispersed in deionized water and were kept in a 0.7 mL quartz cuvette under continuous magnetic stirring to ensure that the photoexcited volume of the samples was kept fresh during the fs-TA measurements.
2.6 Calculation methods
All the calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP).40 The DFT+U approach41 was applied to the tungsten centers, and U was set as 6.2 eV for all the calculations. The electron–ion interaction was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. The Kohn–Sham equations were solved using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The Gaussian smearing method was adopted with a width of 0.2 eV to determine how the partial occupancies were set for each wave function. Dipole correction was considered where necessary. We simulated the surface-electric-field distribution using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) software, with the particle size set to 60 nm × 60 nm × 60 nm with a grid division of 30 × 30 × 30, under light excitation at a wavelength of 532 nm.
3. Results and discussion
We achieved the electronic doping of WO3 by chemically reacting it with metal Zn, whereby the polarized charges at their Schottky contact acted as the driving force to attract group 1 element ions in solution into the lattice,42 with the products corresponding to H, Li, Na, and K doping labeled as HWO, LWO, now, and KWO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a, the appearance of the doped samples all changed. The colors of HWO, LWO, and NWO evolved into black to dark black compared to the light yellow of the undoped WO3, but KWO did not undergo much alteration. It is generally believed that the dipole transition of W between the +6 and +5 valence states produces light absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, which implies the worst charge effects in WO3 were caused by K doping and we will not discuss or compare this in the following text. The crystalline phase was determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) plots in Fig. 1b and S1 in the ESI.† We first illustrate that the bare WO3 possessed high crystallinity, and could be accurately indexed to JCPDS No. 83-0950 with lattice parameters a = 7.30 Å, b = 7.53 Å, c = 7.68 Å with α = 90.0°, β = 90.8°, γ = 90.0°. The XRD peak position of HWO and LWO were blue-shifted to 23.2° and 23.72° with respect to bare WO3 (24.2°) (Fig. 1c), which confirmed the slight increase in cell size. The XRD shifts for the Na-doped counterpart NWO were not remarkable, and so it could be tentatively concluded that the concentration of Na dopant was relatively low due to its large ionic radius, which only had a minor impact on the WO3 lattice. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d confirmed the subtle structural changes, where the lattice spacings initially attributed to the WO3 (200) and (002) planes were expanded from the ideal 3.84 Å and 3.65 Å spacings to 3.92 Å and 3.77 Å after Li doping. However, the charge effects could not be quantitatively compared by the above structural characterizations alone and needed to be further verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In Fig. 1f, the signal of W5+ ions was detected in all the doped WO3 samples, with the highest level noted in the LWO with W5+/(W5+ + W6+) = 54.5%, which was considerably higher than the 50.3% for HWO, and 43.4% for HWO, implying that the Li dopant caused the strongest charge effects in WO3. The ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectra revealed strong LSPR absorption in the visible to NIR region for all the doped WO3 samples (Fig. 1e). The LSPR of HWO and LWO appeared around 630 nm, while that for NWO was located at 790 nm. When used as SERS substrates, the LSPR generated by the excess free electrons oscillations could provide additional contributions through an EM mechanism. For undoped WO3, there was no light absorption in the entire visible-NIR region and hence it is not suitable for SERS. Since the UV-vis-NIR analysis provides a macroscopic representation of the atomic structure, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations for WO3, HWO, and LWO (Fig. 1g and S2 in the ESI†). Our results indicated that there were no density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (Ef) of bare WO3 due to the empty W 4f orbitals. According to the XPS results in Fig. 1f, the free electrons brought by the dopants were mainly localized in the outer 4f orbitals, which allowed the appearance of the DOS near Ef, raising its redox potential and phase transition from insulating to quasi-metallic.43,44 Such non-discrete band alignments can serve as springboards for charge transfer at the substrate–analyte interface, while the strong charge effects-induced LSPR can effectively enhance the near-surface electromagnetic field. We tentatively suggest that this unique quasi-metallic material can serve as an ideal substrate for enhanced SERS performance through a synergistic EM and CM mechanism.

The SERS activity of the doped WO3 was evaluated using R6G as a probe with concentrations ranging from 10−5 M to 10−8 M and focusing on the characteristic Raman peaks between 1000 and 2000 cm−1. The R6G was detectable for all the substrates at 10−5 M, but it had the lowest signal intensity with NWO. The calculated limit of detection (LOD) for HWO was 10−7 M and the corresponding enhancement factor (EF) was 2.17 × 105 (Fig. 2b, S3, S4 and Note S1 in the ESI†). For LWO, all the R6G peaks were still obvious at an extremely low level of 10−8 M (Fig. 2d), wherein all other substrates were deactivated at this time. The corresponding EF obtained from Fig. 2a–c was 4.3 × 106, which is among the best reported compared to previous reports of non-noble metal substrates (Table S1 in the ESI†). Notably, certain Raman peaks associated with the asymmetric vibrations were selectively enhanced. For instance, the C–H bending mode at 1153 cm−1 belonging to the asymmetric in-plane xanthene ring deformation was greatly enhanced in relative intensity with respect to its symmetric stretching (1647 cm−1), which is solid evidence of the charge-transfer-mediated CM mechanism.24,45 Based on the results presented above, the overall order of SERS activity was LWO > HWO > NWO. We speculate that the reason for such a change is that the ionic radius of group 1 elements gradually increases from the top to the bottom of the periodic table, and their triggered charge effects first become stronger and then weaker. This may be due to the structural instability caused by volatilization of the H dopant after exposure to air,36 a process further exacerbated by the thermal effect of laser irradiation; while larger radius atoms have higher insertion energies (Na > Li > H), leading to a low dopant concentration. To ensure practicality, photostability during long-term operation is another crucial factor that should be given priority. Here, LWO exhibited excellent photostability and no significant attenuation after 20 consecutive measurements as compared to HWO (Fig. 2e), indicating its great potential as a reliable and stable SERS substrate.

Further comparison of the structural stability after 48 h storage in air by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy revealed that the LSPR absorption of HWO shifted from the initial 630 nm to 945 nm, but for LWO it remained almost constant (Fig. 3a), which prompted us to explore the existing forms of H and Li in the WO3 lattice by studying their own Raman spectra. In Fig. 3b, the disappearances of the 187, 328, and 715 cm−1 peaks of LWO implied a decrease in binding strength between W and O. Nevertheless, the Raman intensity of HWO was slightly weakened. Hence, the chemical environments of the two dopants were fundamentally different: Li was likely incorporated inside the lattice and located in the tunnel of monoclinic WO3, which severely affected the O–W–O coordination; on the other hand, the small H tended to bond with O to shed a little impact.

In order to clarify the doping position, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was carried out (Fig. 3c and d). A chemical shift at −0.27 ppm was observed in the 7Li-NMR spectrum of LWO. While for HWO, a set of peaks were detected at 0.78, 5.09, and 8.66 ppm in the 1H-NMR spectrum. Among them, the peak at 5.09 ppm was close to the signature of H2O, and FTIR also presented a hydroxyl-like absorption at 3445 cm−1 (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). This also suggests that Li was in roughly the same environment, whereas most H dopants were probably present on the surface as O–H bonds, with a small part entering the crystal interior, which also explains why LWO exhibited excellent SERS sensitivity and better photostability. In an auxiliary experiment, the structural integrity of LWO was maintained even after calcination at 300 °C for 4 h in air (Fig. S6 in the ESI†). We strongly believe the Li-doped WO3 is the best substrate that can efficiently balance SERS sensitivity and photostability.
Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were used to explore the interfacial charge exchange by dispersing WO3 and LWO in R6G solution with the excitation wavelength chosen at 532 nm (Fig. 4a). It was found that the PL signal of R6G dropped by several orders of magnitude upon adsorption on LWO, but not significantly for the undoped WO3. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) in Fig. 4b showed that the decay lifetime of free R6G was 42.28 ns, almost equivalent to when adsorbed on the WO3 surface (40.05 ns), but decreased to 34.49 ns when adsorbed on LWO. This indicated a strong charge exchange at the LWO–R6G hybrid interface for the rapid separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby leading to PL quenching. We carefully analyzed the band positions by both theoretical simulations and electrochemical characterizations. First, we determined the Ef of each substrate using XPS valence band spectroscopy (VB-XPS, Fig. S7 in the ESI†). A prominent feature was the presence of many electron-occupied states near the Ef, which agreed well with the theoretical predictions that LWO undergoes a phase transition from an insulator to quasi-metallic (Fig. 1g). This led to an elevation in redox potential of Ef, which was 2.72 eV higher than the VBM of LWO. In comparison with WO3, the Ef was 2.36 eV higher than the VBM. As shown in Fig. 4c, we measured Mott–Schottky plots and calculated the flat-band potentials of WO3 and LWO as 0.62 and 0.60 V. Correspondingly, we could confirm their CBM levels by transforming the Tauc plots (Fig. 4d). The positive slope of the Mott–Schottky curves indicated that LWO had a much higher electron concentration (1.3 × 1021 cm−3) than bare WO3 (6.2 × 1018 cm−3).

(d) Mott–Schottky curves. (e) Band energy level diagrams for the charge transfer of WO3 and LWO with R6G. 
The band positions are summarized in Table S2 in the ESI,† and charge-exchange diagrams for WO3 and LWO with R6G were then constructed and are shown in Fig. 4e. For the WO3–R6G hybrid system, only the HOMO–CBM and HOMO–LUMO transitions can occur. The energy of interfacial PICT is far away from the incident laser, contributing little to the overall SERS activity. We then compared the electron-transfer efficiency for LWO, where the strong charge effect drove its Ef into the CBM and narrowed the band width. The quasi-metallic structure of LWO allowed multiple charge-transfer pathways, such as HOMO–LUMO, HOMO–CBM, and CBM–LUMO, and also enabled cascade electron transfer from the Ef to the higher excited states of LSPR and then to the LUMO. The narrowed band gap also could allow more electrons from VBM excitation to participate in the PICT process. In addition, the LSPR effects could effectively enhance the near-surface electromagnetic fields, further amplifying Raman response via the EM mechanism. It can be concluded that LWO has more charge-migration paths than WO3, and the high resonance in line with the laser could effectively improve the SERS performance. By analyzing the electric-field-intensity distribution based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) theory and the mathematical relationship of the fourth-order dependence between the molecular Raman signal intensity and the electric-field intensity, we obtained relative theoretical electromagnetic enhancement coefficients of 1.2 × 104, 2.3 × 103, 1.97 × 102, 46.8, and 1 for LWO, HWO, NWO, KWO, and WO3, respectively (Fig. S9 and Note S2 in the ESI†), which was consistent with the trend in their SERS enhancement results and confirmed the significant contribution from the electromagnetic enhancement (EM) mechanism that originated from the LSPR due to the strong charge effects.
To gain insight into the ultrafast charge kinetics, we employed femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy for a mechanistic study of the evolution of the photogenerated electrons at the substrate–analyte interface.7
We adopted 400 nm (3.10 eV) light for excitation according to the steady-state UV-vis-NIR spectra (Fig. 3a), and white-light continuum (WLC) for real-time tracking. Fig. 5a–d show the 3D fs-TA spectra (450–770 nm) of WO3, WO3 + R6G, LWO, and LWO + R6G, wherein a representative 720 nm probe light was selected to exclude the corresponding lifetime constants following the global fitting procedure. For WO3 and LWO, the build-up time for hot electron generation was within the limit of the instrument response function (IRF, <100 fs), and the subsequent relaxation process consisted of two steps, which were fitted as following (Fig. 5e and g): τ1 = 0.28 ± 0.02 ps (62%) and τ2 = 3.57 ± 0.25 ps (38%) for WO3, and τ1 = 0.27 ± 0.02 ps (54%) and τ2 = 3.78 ± 0.17 ps (46%) after R6G adsorption. It was found that the values and ratios of τ1 and τ2 of WO3 remained almost unchanged, indicating a lack of interactions between WO3 and R6G. By contrast for LWO (Fig. 5f), τ1 = 0.19 ± 0.01 ps (95%) and τ2 = 11.81 ± 4.08 ps (5%), which confirmed the numerous hot electrons collisions produced by the LSPR effect. The electron–electron scattering represented by the τ1 component was completely dominant (100%) after R6G adsorption and the electron–phonon scattering of τ2 completely disappeared, indicating that part of the excited-state electrons were rapidly transferred from LWO to R6G, consistent with the accelerated interfacial charge separation results derived from the PL quenching in Fig. 4a. Comparing the electron decay behavior in the initial 200 ps at the WLC range (Fig. S8 in the ESI†), the overall electron lifetime (i.e., charge-transfer efficiency) in the LWO–R6G hybrid system was the optimum. We can attribute the superior SERS activity of LWO to three factors: First, different from previous attempts based on a metastable oxygen vacancy-assisted band alignment strategy, the intrinsically quasi-metallic structure provided perfect band matching to ensure efficient substrate–analyte interfacial PICT-mediated Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling. Second, the electronic doping-induced charge effects generated strong LSPR effects to contribute an additional EM enhancement. Last, the stable doping structure avoided the activity loss caused by LSPR heating and therefore ensured high photostability, allowing for synergistic SERS enhancement from both the chemical CM and physical EM contributions.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a facile metal salt solution approach to achieve efficient electronic doping in WO3 by introducing group 1 elements under ambient conditions. In particular, the Li-doped WO3 substrate, which undergoes an insulator to quasi-metallic transition, exhibited both a semiconductor-like tunable charge-transfer capability and a metal-like LSPR effect. It was also sufficiently stable to serve as the optimal SERS substrate, offering both high sensitivity and photostability to achieve a remarkable enhancement factor (EF) up to 4.3 × 106 and a detection limit of 10−8 M R6G even after consecutive operations. Our work paves a way for the systematic modification of existing metal oxide materials toward developing alternative non-noble metal-based SERS substrates.
