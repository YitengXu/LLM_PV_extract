    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 25th June 2018AbstractWhile lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are poised to be the next generation of high-density energy storage devices, the intrinsic polysulfide shuttle has limited their practical applications. In order to fundamentally solve the problem, a well-designed host to simultaneously meet the requirements for both sufficient surface reaction and efficient conversion of polysulfides is urgently demanded. Herein, a 3D heterogeneous sulfur host, termed Ni-ZIF-8@CC, is fabricated by in situ deposition of nickel-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (Ni-ZIF-8) on carbon cloth (CC). Spectroscopic investigations show that polysulfides can be strongly adsorbed by the Ni-ZIF-8@CC host through the synergy between Ni–S and Li–N interactions, which is also verified by DFT simulations. The doped electrocatalytically active nickel species could furthermore significantly facilitate the kinetics of polysulfide redox reaction, attributed to fast lithium ion diffusion and reduced polarization potential. By combining these advantages, the electrodes exhibit a high areal capacity of up to 6.04 mA h cm−2 together with excellent cycling stabilities.
The increasing demand for portable electronics and electric vehicles has stimulated intensive research on advanced electrochemical energy storage techniques.1,2 Among the next-generation batteries, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are very attractive due to their superior theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1) and energy density (2600 W h kg−1).3–8 However, the practical use of Li–S batteries is seriously hindered by their low sulfur utilization and poor cycle life due to the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the large volume change during electrochemical reactions.9–15
In an attempt to tackle the above problems, great efforts have been devoted to the design and construction of micro/nanostructured carbonaceous sulfur hosts, such as porous carbon,16–18 carbon nanotubes/nanofibers,19 graphene,20 and hollow carbon nanospheres.21 However, the weak van der Waals interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfide species is not sufficient to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides during long-term cycling, resulting in the loss of reactive intermediates.22 In addition, the high nucleation barrier also impedes the efficient interfacial redox activity of sulfur species on carbon (Fig. 1a).23–25 Alternatively, there has been growing interest in polar materials, such as transition-metal oxides,26–31 sulfides,32–35 nitrides,36 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),37–43 which have been reported as sulfur hosts to improve the adsorption of intermediate polysulfides. It is believed that further reduction of Li2S4 to Li2S is the rate-determining step of the Li–S batteries, which contributes to three-quarters of the theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, in most cases, the chemically adsorbed LiPSs are blocked while the surface conversion cannot be directly realized on the polar host, where an additional surface diffusion step will be required for the overall reaction to proceed, resulting in sluggish redox kinetics.44,45 In this case, large amounts of soluble LiPSs are accumulated gradually within the host framework. Once the saturation capacity of trapping LiPSs is reached (all the active binding sites are occupied), polysulfide moieties will leak out of the cathode region, which can lead to diminishing performance (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustrations of the adsorption and conversion mechanism of LiPSs for different hosts. (a) Carbonaceous hosts: weak adsorption and inferior conversion of LiPSs. (b) Traditional polar hosts: strong adsorption but inferior conversion of LiPSs. (c) Heterogeneous hosts: creating a dynamic equilibrium between the strong adsorption and smooth conversion of LiPSs. 
It is known that MOF-related materials have recently been actively explored in energy storage systems due to their great diversity in terms of structure and composition.46–49 On the other hand, Ni-containing materials, a class of versatile 3d metal-based catalysts with multiple oxidation states, have been proved to enhance the reaction kinetics of aqueous polysulfides in photoelectrochemical solar cells and redox flow cells.50 With these concerns in mind, a Ni-doped MOF heterostructure could be intentionally designed as a smart host to simultaneously meet the demand for both sufficient surface reaction and efficient surface conversion over the abundant preferred nucleation sites, which is the kernel of fundamentally solving the shuttle problem (Fig. 1c).
Reported for the first time, herein we design a ternary hybrid material comprising nickel-doped ZIF-8 (Ni-ZIF-8) deposited on carbon cloth (CC), termed Ni-ZIF-8@CC, as a novel sulfur host. The original ZIF-8 porous frameworks effectively trap polysulfides owing to the strong confining effect of cage-like pores. More importantly, the catalytic nickel species could not only adsorb the polysulfides strongly, but could also accelerate the polysulfide redox kinetics effectively. What's more, the open structures of carbon cloth can accommodate high sulfur loading and improve electron transportation throughout the entire electrode. With these multiple advantages, a high capacity of 1006 mA h g−1 and good capacity retention over 500 cycles are thus achieved. Even with a high sulfur mass loading of 5.5 mg cm−2, the cell can be stably cycled for 100 cycles with an areal capacity of 5.3 mA h cm−2. As a result, such an effective strategy may guide us in developing novel multi-component heterostructures as cooperatively catalytic hosts for advanced Li–S batteries with superior electrochemical properties.
As illustrated in Fig. 2a, flexible Ni-ZIF-8@CC was prepared by in situ growth of nickel-doped Zn(2-methylimidazole)2 (Fig. 2b) on carbon cloth via a facile hot-pressing method. The Ni-ZIF-8 particles (ca. 220 nm) were uniformly distributed on the flexible carbon cloth (Fig. 2c and d and S1–S3†). The mesopores with a size of 2.48 nm and the micropores with a diameter of 1.17 nm are clearly distinguished in the pore size distribution (BJH & HK) of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC (Fig. 2e). The unique porous structure is good for confining soluble LiPSs during long-term cycling.41 The mass loading of Ni-ZIF-8 was 0.76 mg cm−2 and could be tuned from 0.55 to 1.05 mg cm−2 by adjusting the quantities of precursors (Fig. S4†). To show the catalytic mechanism of foreign nickel species, ZIF-8@CC was also prepared as a control sample (Fig. S5 and S6†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC composite is displayed in Fig. 2f and all the diffraction peaks could be indexed to ZIF-8, with the exception of the diffraction peak of carbon. In addition, Ni-ZIF-8@CC shows an electronic conductivity on a pressed pellet of 20.5 S cm−1, which is comparable with that of the pure carbon cloth (21.2 S cm−1) and sufficient for fast electron transport within the electrode (Fig. 2g and S7†).

Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S was prepared by first infiltering sulfur/CS2 solution into Ni-ZIF-8@CC composite and then using the conventional melt-impregnation method (Fig. 2a). No obvious crystalline sulfur was formed after sulfur loading (Fig. 2f and S8†), which indicates a uniform sulfur distribution in the Ni-ZIF-8 porous framework.51 The corresponding elemental mapping of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S composite further confirms the uniform distribution of sulfur in the Ni-ZIF-8 matrix (Fig. 2h and i).
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to model the interactions between LiPSs and Ni-ZIF-8. Fig. 3a shows the most stable configurations of Li2Sx (x = 4, 6 and 8) in the pores of Ni-ZIF-8.43 Driven by the electrostatic affinities of donor–acceptor pairs, the foreign nickel ion is inclined to coordinate with terminal sulfur atoms of LiPSs caused by Lewis acid–base interactions,52 while lithium atoms come close to the nitrogen atoms of the ZIF-8 framework. The binding energies between Ni-ZIF-8 frameworks with Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 species are 3.54, 3.81 and 3.35 eV, respectively, which are higher than those of ZIF-8 (Fig. S9†) and also comparable to those of other polar materials.24,27,53 To verify the efficient entrapment of LiPSs upon sulfur lithiation intuitively, in situ electrochemical behaviors of different cathodes were studied in optically transparent glass cells. As shown in Fig. 3b, the electrolyte in the cell using either ZIF-8@CC/S or pure CC/S as the cathode changes from colorless to yellow, indicating that the LiPSs diffuse out of the cathode and are solubilized in the electrolyte. In contrast, the electrolyte in the cell using Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S as the cathode remains colorless after discharging from 2.8 to 1.8 V, demonstrating the limited dissolution of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte. This experiment offers visual evidence of the effective LiPS trapping by the Ni-ZIF-8@CC host.

(a) Binding geometric configurations and binding energies of Li2Sx (x = 4, 6 and 8) species in the pores of Ni-ZIF-8. The high binding energies indicate the strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and Ni-ZIF-8. (b) Visual examination of polysulfide entrapment of Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S, ZIF-8@CC/S and CC/S electrodes at specific lithiation depths. XPS spectra showing (c) N 1s and (d) Zn 2p of the ZIF-8@CC/S electrode, and (e) Ni 2p of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S electrode before lithiation and after discharging to ∼2.0 V. 
To further understand the interaction between LiPSs and foreign nickel species or ZIF-8, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted. The binding energy of N 1s in ZIF-8@CC/S shifts to a higher value after lithiation, which can be ascribed to charge transfer from N to Li+ (Fig. 3c). However, the Zn 2p and S 2p peaks do not show any difference after cycling (Fig. 3d and S10†). As for the Ni-ZIF-8 heterostructure, the Ni 2p peak at 856.5 eV shifts to a lower binding energy of 854.7 eV after cycling (Fig. 3e), possibly because of a strong interaction between the foreign Ni species and the LiPSs,54 which is also proved by shifting of the S 2p XPS signal to higher binding energy (Fig. S10†). It is thus believed that the involved nickel species of the Ni-ZIF-8 heterostructure are the major interactive sites responsible for binding with LiPSs. These experimental observations are in good agreement with the findings from the theoretical simulations (Fig. 3a).
To demonstrate the electrocatalytic activity of foreign nickel species for charge transfer to LiPSs during the charge/discharge process in a Li–S battery, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrode kinetics with respect to the lithium ion diffusion coefficient (DLi+) (Fig. 4). When the CV of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC electrode for the LiPS conversion process is compared to those of ZIF-8@CC and pure CC, the distinguishable positive shift in the reduction peak and negative shift in the oxidation peak reveal the faster electrochemical reactions and superior catalytic activity of the Ni-containing electrodes (Fig. 4a–c).13 Based on the Randles–Sevcik equation, the lithium ion diffusion coefficient is calculated from the slope of the linear plot of the peak current (Ip) versus the square root of the scan rate (V0.5) (Fig. 4d–f).23,35,55 The diffusion coefficients for Ni-ZIF-8@CC at peaks A, C1 and C2 are 1.39 × 10−7, 3.67 × 10−8 and 8.01 × 10−8, respectively (Table S1†). These values are much higher than those of ZIF-8@CC and pristine CC (especially for the C2 peak) and also superior to those of other hosts,9,23,35,55,56 indicating much faster diffusion and better reaction kinetics. It is known that the discharge product, lithium sulfides, would easily precipitate within the host framework as an insulating layer, thereby hindering lithium ion diffusion.35 However, the introduction of heterogeneity (nickel species) enables catalytic conversion of LiPSs and prevents the formation of such insulating layer, resulting in facile lithium ion diffusion.

The electrochemical performance of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S composite for Li–S batteries was investigated, and the sulfur mass loading was about 1.5 mg cm−2. For comparison, ZIF-8@CC/S and CC/S composites were also prepared and made into half cells. The rate performance of all the samples was evaluated (Fig. 5a and S12†). At a low current density of 0.2C, a reversible discharge capacity of 1080 mA h g−1 was obtained from the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cathode. When the current rate was increased to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0C, the electrode exhibited reversible capacities of 976, 923, 820, and 666 mA h g−1, respectively, demonstrating better rate capability compared with the ZIF-8@CC/S and CC/S cathodes (Fig. 5a). Upon changing the current density back to 0.2C, the cell still showed good reversibility after high-rate tests, indicating good stability and fast kinetics of the electrode.

(g) Areal capacity and specific capacity of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S electrode with a high sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm−2 during cycling at a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2 (0.13C). 
Galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were also carried out at a current density of 0.2C. The Ni-ZIF-8@CC showed the smallest polarization (0.16 V) and the longest voltage plateau compared with ZIF-8@CC and pure CC (Fig. 5b and S13†), which could accelerate the polysulfide redox reaction benefiting from the excellent catalytic ability of Ni-ZIF-8 materials.57Fig. 5c shows the cycling performance at 0.2C. Initially, the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cathode can deliver a remarkable reversible capacity as high as 1125 mA h g−1 and still retain a stable capacity of 1036 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 92.1%. In addition, the discharge voltage plateaus are stable over 50 cycles for the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S electrode (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the ZIF-8@CC/S and CC/S cathodes have initial reversible capacities of 868 and 735 mA h g−1 and preserve discharge capacities of only 810 and 513 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively. In Fig. 5d and e, we separated out and plotted the high-plateau and low-plateau capacity contributions to the total discharge capacity for the various systems. The high-plateau capacity for the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S is much greater compared to those of ZIF-8@CC/S and pure CC/S (Fig. 5d), which confirms the suppression of polysulfide diffusion in the Ni-ZIF-8@CC. It is also found that the low-plateau capacity (corresponding to conversion from LiPSs to lithium sulfide) for the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S is more stable than that of pure CC/S (Fig. 5e). Although the ZIF-8@CC/S cathode also has a relatively stable low-plateau capacity, the performance is apparently inferior to that of the cells containing Ni-ZIF-8@CC heterostructures, which is mainly ascribed to the catalysis of foreign Ni species. Hence, the heterogeneous Ni-ZIF-8 could not only trap the LiPSs but also facilitate their subsequent conversion, contributing to such a high capacity.
The Li–S batteries based on Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cathodes were also cycled at a high current density (Fig. 5f). At a current rate of 1.0C, the initial discharge capacity reaches 1006 mA h g−1, and after cycling for 500 cycles, the capacity still remains at 715 mA h g−1, corresponding to a cycling decay rate of 0.05%. Although higher polarization occurred in the electrodes at higher rates due to slower dynamics of sulfur, the discharge/charge profiles still present a stable voltage plateau and small capacity loss during cycling, which further demonstrates the improved electrochemical properties (Fig. S14†). To build a high-energy-density Li–S battery, the areal sulfur loading was increased to approximately 5.5 mg cm−2 by fabricating a thick film electrode. At a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2, the cell delivers an initial discharge capacity of 6.04 mA h cm−2 (1098 mA h g−1), and shows good capacity retention (Fig. 5g). Thus, the cooperative interface of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S electrode provided a simple yet effective way to endow the Li–S battery with enhanced performance and to make it comparable to current battery technology (Table S3†).
To further demonstrate the superiority of Ni-ZIF-8@CC for stable cycling performance, the electrode films and separators were examined after long-term cycling. Uneven accumulation of discharge products on the fibers was observed for the cycled ZIF-8@CC/S and CC/S electrodes (Fig. 6a and b and S15a and b†), whereas the Ni-ZIF-8 @CC/S composite showed almost no variation compared with its pristine counterpart (Fig. 6c and S15c†). Furthermore, the separator from the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cell shows an inconspicuous color, implying the most effective restriction of LiPSs within the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cathode (Fig. 6f). In contrast, the yellowish areas on the separators of the ZIF-8@CC/S and pristine CC/S cells are much larger and more distinct than those of the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cell (Fig. 6d and e). These observations are in good agreement with the visual examination of polysulfide entrapment upon sulfur lithiation (Fig. 3b). Additionally, we carried out EIS measurements to explore the kinetics of our 3D porous hybrid structures. Before cycling, the obtained Nyquist plots contain a depressed semicircle corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), followed by an inclined straight line associated with the mass transfer process (Fig. 6g and S16a†). The initial Rct is almost of the same order of magnitude for batteries using the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S, ZIF-8@CC/S and pure CC/S electrodes (Table S2†). However, after deep cycling, all of the three cells have two semicircles related to the charge-transfer resistance at the cathode, Rct, and formation of an insulating layer of solid Li2S2/Li2S between the separator and the cathode, Rg, respectively (Fig. S16b†). Both of the Rct and Rg from the cell with Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S are distinctly smaller than those in the ZIF-8@CC/S and pure CC/S systems (Fig. 6h and Table S2†), which reflects the facile reaction kinetics at the interface.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a ternary Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S hybrid material to boost the performance of the S cathode in Li–S batteries. The heterostructure is built with a highly adsorptive component (ZIF-8 structure), catalytic component (foreign nickel species) and robust 3D conductive framework (carbon cloth), which is an effective way to simultaneously address the electron conduction, lithium ion diffusion, polysulfide shuttle problems and smooth conversion of LiPSs. Accordingly, the Ni-ZIF-8@CC/S cathode delivers an initial capacity of 1006 mA h g−1 and a substantial capacity of 715 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1C. More promisingly, the composite cathode with a high sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm−2 delivers an initial areal capacity of 6.04 mA h cm−2 which remains stable at ∼5.3 mA h cm−2 for 100 cycles, outperforming the reported MOF-based sulfur electrodes. This strategy may guide us in engineering novel multi-component host materials combining the catalytic effects with the physical/chemical confinement, which is expected to be a promising solution to promote the practical use of Li–S batteries.
