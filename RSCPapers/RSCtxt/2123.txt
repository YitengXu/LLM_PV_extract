    , Accepted 24th March 2023First published on 27th March 2023AbstractIn this work, a Zn-based 1D coordination polymer [Zn(H2O)(C10H8N2)(C9H4O6)]·2H2O, denoted as Zn–CP, has been designed and synthesized by a slow diffusion mediated multi-ligand approach at room temperature. The Zn–CP material is characterized by single crystal analysis and other spectroscopic methods. A heteronanocomposite (Zn–CP/rGO) is prepared by mixing Zn–CP with conductive rGO nanosheets through ultrasonication and is used as a battery-type material for supercapacitor application. The Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanostructure material delivers a specific capacity of 188.5 C g−1 (377 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1 with good cycling stability (85% capacity retention upon 6000 charge–discharge cycles at 6 A g−1) and a high coulombic efficiency of 97% while a pure Zn–CP electrode delivers only 135.5 C g−1 (261 F g−1) at the same current density. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor device (Zn–CP/rGO∥AC) is fabricated, which delivers a maximum energy density of 13.3 W h kg−1 and a power density of 7446 W kg−1. The suitable power density and long standing endurance of the hybrid device show promising potential for battery-type supercapacitor application.
Introduction
The sporadic nature of renewable energy sources stimulated the researchers to develop economically viable and environmentally benign energy storage systems. In the present scenario, two different electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems being utilized for large-scale applications are batteries and supercapacitors.1,2 Supercapacitors (SCs) in particular have gained attention due to their good power density, fast charge/discharge rates, excellent reversibility, long cycle life (>100000 cycles), easy transportation and adequate safety standards.3 According to the mechanism of charge storage in supercapacitors, they can be classified into electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. Typically, carbon materials store energy due to the accumulation of charged species at the electrode/electrolyte interface and behave as double-layer capacitors (non-faradaic process).4 The inherent potential of EDLCs to be used in a commercial perspective relies on their high power density and ultrahigh stability. However, insignificant energy density (<10 W h kg−1) and low specific capacitance restrict their broad-scale applicability.5 Comparatively, pseudocapacitive materials such as metal oxides (MnO2, RuO2etc.) and conducting polymers can deliver higher energy density and specific capacity by fast reversible redox reactions (faradaic process) occurring at the surface or near-surface of the electroactive materials.6–8 However, their ultra-fast redox kinetics alters the intrinsic properties and de-stabilizes the porous structure, resulting in an inferior power density and low rate performance.3 Currently, the paradigm has been shifted to integrate hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) between two dissimilar electrode materials (faradaic and/or non-faradaic) through which the potential window can be maximized to achieve high capacitance and high energy/power densities.9 Therefore, it is indispensable to design and develop newer electrode materials to attain high-performance supercapacitor devices.
Coordination polymers (CPs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) comprise one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) porous polymeric structures consisting of metal ions/metal-oxo-clusters tethered by organic linkers through covalent/coordination interactions.7,9–12 These materials have gained widespread attention owing to their preternatural porosity, diverse functionality, structural modularity and good thermal stability.13 These noticeable properties of MOFs/CPs have been explored in different fields, such as adsorption and separation,14,15 energy storage and conversion,7,16,17 water oxidation,18 photoluminescence19 and sensing20 to mention just a few. Due to the existence of a vast number of organic linkers and/or metal nodes/clusters, great success has been achieved to incorporate diverse functionalities into MOFs/CPs through a simple isoreticular approach.21 The 2D and 3D porous coordination polymers that extend from low-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers via non-covalent interaction and/or other weak interactions such as H-bonding, π–π stacking and van der Waals forces could provide a stable organic framework with well-defined porosity and tailorable topology.9,12,16,22 Due to the structural merits and the ability to provide redox-active metal centres and conductive ligands, MOFs/CPs have been investigated extensively as attractive electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitor applications. Such MOFs/CPs can facilitate charge transfer dynamics and promote ion/electrolyte diffusion into the interlayer space during the electrochemical redox process.12,23
Currently, pristine MOFs, MOF derived materials (porous carbon, metal oxide, hydroxide or sulphide) and MOF composites are extensively used to fabricate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.22,24–27 Although the use of pristine MOFs/CPs as a template or precursor to produce different hollow and porous materials is very popular and efficient, in most cases the porosity and morphology cannot be preserved in the final product and often require harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and/or a N2 (or Ar) atmosphere. Importantly, pyrolysis impairs the most architectural features of MOFs/CPs i.e. their characteristic metal–ligand coordination environments. On the other hand, the direct use of pristine MOFs/CPs as supercapacitor active electrode materials has not been fully established yet and is still considered an emerging research topic.5,28 For example, Cu-based coordination polymer nanowires (Cu–Asp) demonstrated a capacitance of 367 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 current density with excellent cycling stability.29 Recently, a vertically-oriented NiCo–MOF on carbon fiber paper (NiCo–MOF/CFP) was prepared using a Co(OH)2 precursor at 120 °C for 12 h.30 The MOF electrode showed a capacitance of 1044 F g−1. Moreover, the fabricated asymmetric device (NiCo–MOF//AC) delivered a maximum energy density of 28.5 W h kg−1. Abazari et al. designed a Co–MOF synergistically coupled with CoMn2O4 (Co(II)-TMU-63# 30%CoMn2O4 nanocomposite), which delivered a high capacitance of 1420 F g−1 at 7 A g−1.31 The excellent electrochemical activity of this MOF nanocomposite is attributed to its high surface area, sufficient active sites and porosity induced unrestricted mass transport. A Co-based layered MOF {[Co (Hmt) (tfbdc) (H2O)2]·(H2O)2}n was synthesized at room temperature that exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 2474 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with more than 94% capacitance retention (2000 cycles).32 Despite all the advancements, the major drawbacks associated with pristine MOFs/CPs are their poor electrical conductivities and electroactivities, which deteriorate their electrochemical performances. Therefore, a rational design of MOF-based nanocomposites assembling MOFs/CPs with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a multi-component approach has been explored.13,17,33,34 Among them, rGO being a 2D layered structure displays excellent electrical conductivity and possesses high mechanical robustness and surface area. Such MOF/CP–rGO robust heterostructures exhibit enhanced pseudocapacitive performance due to high electrical conductivities and short ion diffusion channels.24,33,35 For example, Yaghi and co-workers have synthesized 23 nanocrystalline MOFs (n-MOFs) doped with graphene using different metal nodes and organic linkers and studied their supercapacitive properties. Among all, a Zr–MOF/graphene (Zr6O4-(OH)4(BPYDC)6) thin film delivered high aerial capacitance of 5.09 mF cm−2.36 Recently, a CuMOF/rGO composite electrode was fabricated using an ultrasonication method, which delivered a specific capacitance of 462 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1. The specific capacitance reported for the CuMOF/rGO composite was 112 times higher than the pure CuMOF ({[Cu2(L)(H2O)2]·(5DMF)·(4H2O)}n).37 It can be noted that the majority of MOF/CP-based electrode materials contain Ni, Co, Fe and Cu redox centres, whereas there are a few reports on Zn-based coordination polymers for supercapacitor application.23,30–32,37
Herein, we have synthesized a new 1D porous Zn-based coordination polymer [Zn(H2O)(C10H8N2)(C9H4O6)]·2H2O (Zn–CP) by a facile mixed ligand strategy using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bpy) linkers. As far as we know, this is the first case where we have synthesized single crystals of a 1D coordination polymer containing Zn2+ ions and mixed ligands by a slow diffusion technique (layering of solvents) at room temperature. The BTC ligand used here provides multicarboxylate linkages that can undergo partial/complete deprotonation of –COOH groups, resulting in the construction of stable and flexible coordination polymers. Moreover, a one-dimensional chain extends in three dimensions through different interactions such as π–π interaction between the delocalised π-electrons in the pyridine ring and the BTC ring of one chain with another chain, and H-bonding within each layer. Such arrangements in 1D layered coordination polymers can facilitate the fast movement of ions into the bulk phase of the crystal through interlayer spacing without any hindrance. Furthermore, a simple ultrasonication assisted RT method was employed to synthesize a robust heterostructure with rGO (Zn–CP/rGO) for improved electrochemical performance. The Zn–CP/rGO heterostructure is endowed with a specific capacity of 188.5 C g−1 (377 F g−1) in an alkaline electrolyte, which is 1.44 times more than pristine Zn–CP. Furthermore, an HSC device is fabricated using Zn–CP/rGO as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, which delivered an energy density of 13.3 W h kg−1 and a power density of 7746 W kg−1.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
All the chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received. 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (C9H6O6, H3BTC), 4,4′-bipyridine (C10H8N2, 4,4′-bpy) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were purchased from Alfa Aesar. High-purity water (DI water, 18.2 MΩ cm) was used in all the experiments. All the solvents were used as received.
Synthesis of [Zn(H2O)(C10H8N2)(C9H4O6)]·2H2O (Zn–CP)
In this synthesis, a single crystal of Zn–CP was obtained via a room temperature mediated slow diffusion technique. Typically, 8 mL of DI water containing 0.01 g of H3BTC was slowly added to a methanolic solution (8 mL) of 4,4′-bpy (0.08 g). The ligand solution was stirred for 1 h. Meanwhile, 0.32 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in a beaker containing 8 mL of mixed solvents (DMF + H2O, 1:1 V/V) and 3 mL of this metallic solution was transferred to a glass tube. In the subsequent step, 3 mL of the ligand solution prepared above was layered over the metallic solution using 2 mL of buffer solution (1:1 V/V, H2O + MeOH). The glass tube was carefully sealed with Parafilm and left undisturbed at room temperature. After 15 days, small needle-shaped colourless crystals suitable for single crystal analysis were obtained at the interface between the two layers.
Synthesis of the Zn–CP/rGO composite
Graphene oxide (GO) and rGO were prepared according to a previously reported procedure.24 For the synthesis of Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanocomposites, 20 mg of rGO was dispersed in 8 mL of mixed solvents (H2O + MeOH + DMF, 1:1:2 V/V) under ultrasonication for 30 minutes followed by the addition of 0.32 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. After 1 h, 8 mL of mixed ligand solution was added to it and ultrasonicated for 30 minutes followed by stirring at room temperature for 12 h. Eventually, the final product was collected through multiple washings with methanol followed by drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The Zn–CP bulk powder was prepared by the same method as discussed above without adding rGO.
Characterization of materials
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded by irradiating the sample with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å) on a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer. A JASCO FT/IR-4100 spectrophotometer was employed to record the FTIR spectra (range: 500–4000 cm−1). The surface morphologies of all the samples were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Apreo S) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-3010). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using Q-500 instrument (heating rate: 10 °C min−1). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using Shimadzu ESCA 3100 spectrometer. The BET surface area was measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. A confocal Raman microscope (WiTEC R 300) was used for Raman spectral analysis.
X-ray crystallography measurements and data refinements
The colourless single crystal of Zn–CP was mounted on a Bruker D8 VENTURE diffractometer and irradiated with Mo Kα X-ray (λ = 0.71073 Å) and a kappa apex3 CMOS detector using a monochromated graphite radiator at 296 K by the standard φ–ω scan technique. The data were collected using APEX3 software and the cell refinement was done using the APEX3-SAINT programme. The crystal structure was solved via SHELXT-2014/5 and refined via the full-matrix least squares technique on F2 using the SHELXL-2018/3 computer programme.38 The positions of all atoms were obtained by direct methods and H atoms were refined anisotropically. All of the H atoms were placed at geometrically controlled positions and refined as riding atoms with isotropic temperature factors of 1.2 × Ueq of their parent atoms. Molecular graphics and interactions were produced using the Mercury programme.39 The single crystal data of Zn–CP were deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC no. 2239927†) and the details are given in Table S1.†
Electrochemical measurements
A CHI 7081C electrochemical workstation was used to carry out all the electrochemical measurements related to Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO in 2 M KOH electrolyte at RT. A typical three-electrode system consists of a reference electrode (SCE), a counter electrode (Pt foil) and a working electrode (Ni-foam, 1 × 1 cm2). The working electrode slurry was prepared by carefully mixing 85 wt% Zn–CP (or Zn–CP/rGO), 10 wt% acetylene black and 5 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) solution. The as-obtained slurry was brush coated onto pre-treated Ni-foam followed by overnight vacuum drying at 60 °C. The final mass loadings of the active materials were between 1.3 and 1.4 mg. The electrochemical performance of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The specific capacitance (Cs, F g−1) was calculated from CV and GCD data using eqn (1) and (2), respectively.40 (1) (2)where v is the scan rate in mV s−1, i is the current (A), m is the total mass of the electrodes in gram, and Δt and ΔV are the discharge time (s) and the potential window, Vi to Vf (V), respectively. A hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device was fabricated using a Swagelok cell setup containing Zn–CP/rGO as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The AC is prepared using a reported procedure.41 The same method was employed to prepare the HSC device's working electrode. Typically, two coated Ni-foams of 1 cm diameter were separated using filter paper (1.2 cm diameter) and soaked in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. For appropriate functioning of the HSC, the charge balance between the positive and negative electrodes needs to follow the relationship q+ = q−. The actual mass loading of positive and negative electrodes was calculated using the relationship: (m+/m− = C− × ΔV−/C+ × ΔV+), where + and − refer to positive and negative electrodes, respectively. C and ΔV represent the specific capacitance and potential in a three-electrode system, respectively. (m+/m−) is the ratio of mass loading to be taken in a two-electrode system. All the electrochemical tests related to the HSC were the same as described earlier. The energy density (Ed) and power density (Pd) of the HSC were assessed using eqn (3) and (4), respectively.24 (3) (4)
Results and discussion
In this protocol, single crystals of 1D Zn–coordination polymers (Zn–CP) are grown successfully using a mixed ligand (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 4,4′-bipyridine) approach. The colourless crystals of Zn–CPs are prepared by a facile room temperature mediated slow diffusion technique involving a mixture of three different solvents. In addition, the Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanostructure is prepared using rGO nanosheets through a simple ultrasonication method at room temperature. The schematic representation of the preparation of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanocomposites is shown in Scheme 1.

Single crystal analysis of Zn–CP
Single crystal XRD of Zn–CP revealed that the as-synthesized coordination polymer crystallizes in the C2/c space group of the monoclinic system. In Fig. 1a, the asymmetric unit of Zn–CP contains one Zn(II) ion, BTC molecule, 4,4′-bpy molecule, one coordinated and two lattice water molecules along with an isolated oxygen atom (due to solvent disorder). In Fig. 1b, the Zn(II) ion is coordinated to two O atoms of the BTC ligand, one N atom of the 4,4′-bpy molecule and one O atom of the coordinated water molecule. The structural feature of Zn–CP is that it contains an uncoordinated carboxylic group of the BTC ligand owing to its unidentate coordination fashion, which is later confirmed by IR analysis. Each Zn(II) ion is surrounded by O3N coordination environment and adopts a tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 1b). The Zn1–O bond lengths are measured within the range of 1.928–2.065 Å and are consistent with the earlier reported Zn-based coordination polymers.12,42 Similarly, the Zn1–N1 distance is found to be 2.026 Å (Table S2†). The O3–Zn1–N1, O1–Zn1–O3 and N1–Zn1–O7 bond angles are calculated to be 103.91(16), 119.59(15) and 95.25(19)°, respectively. The other bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table S2.† In the crystal structure, one Zn(II) centre is linked to another by a monodentate –COO– group of the BTC linker, resulting in the 1D infinite arrangement of the coordination polymer (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c shows the 2D stacking of Zn–CP originating through hydrogen bonding. The interionic distance between two Zn(II) centres in the 1D chain is found to be 9.95 Å. It is observed that the one-dimensional infinite layers are stacked on each other through π–π interaction between the 1D infinite layers and H-bonding between O(7)–H(7A)⋯O(2), O(7)–H(7b)⋯O(9) and N(2)–H(2A)⋯O(5), generating a three-dimensional layered supramolecular structure as illustrated in Fig. 2. The selected H-bonding distances and angles are given in Table S3.† A 3D wireframe structure of Zn–CP is given in Fig. S1,† which shows the unidirectional porous nature of the material.

Physiochemical analyses of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanocomposites
The phase purity and crystallinity of bulk Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO heterostructures are confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Fig. S2† shows the PXRD pattern of rGO, which matched well with the reported pattern.24 The powder XRD patterns of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO samples have shown characteristic diffraction peaks which also matched well with the powder pattern obtained by simulating single crystal data (Fig. 3a). The diffraction peaks of Zn–CP/rGO are the characteristic of Zn–CP only, which further confirms the structural integrity of CPs even after mixing with rGO. In addition, the sharp diffraction peaks at low 2θ values indicate the high crystallinity of the coordination polymer.29 Furthermore, the phase similarity between the bulk powder and single crystal is analysed by the Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern of the bulk powder using the Zn–CP cif file (Fig. 3b), which tells the crystal phase matching between the bulk powder pattern and single crystal's simulated pattern. Fig. 3c depicts the FT-IR spectra of H3BTC, 4,4′-bpy, rGO, Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO. The IR peak at 1709 cm−1 is ascribed to the asymmetric stretching mode of the carbonyl (CO) group of the H3BTC linker. However, there is a clear shift in the stretching vibration of the CO group from 1709 cm−1 to 1620 cm−1 in Zn–CP indicating the successful co-ordination of the –COO− group to the Zn metal ion.43 Concomitantly, a less intense peak at 1709 cm−1 suggests that some of the uncoordinated carbonyl groups may be present in Zn–CP which is in accordance with the single crystal data. Besides, the peak at 1375 cm−1 of Zn–CP is ascribed to the C–C asymmetric stretching vibration of the aromatic ring, while the peak at 1108 cm−1 is due to the C–O–C stretching vibration. The IR band at 758 cm−1 is related to the out-of-plane deformation vibration of C–H bonds.14 The characteristic broad absorption band at 3000–3450 cm−1 is due to the presence of the N–H, hydroxyl group (–OH) and water molecules in Zn–CP. The absorption band at 1596 cm−1 is related to the stretching vibration of the CN group of 4,4′-bpy. However, after complex formation with Zn metal, the band reappeared at 1580 cm−1.43 The absorption bands at 3136 (broad peak) and 1402 cm−1 (sharp peak) are due to the O–H stretching and deformation vibrations of rGO, respectively.24 Furthermore, similar IR signatures are observed for the Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite suggesting the successful integration of rGO with the 1D chain of Zn–CP.

Fig. S3† shows the TGA curves of rGO, Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO. The TGA curve of rGO in Fig. S3a† shows the decomposition of rGO starting from 450 °C. In Fig. S3b,† the initial weight loss of 16% in the temperature range of 70–170 °C is due to the loss of physically adsorbed/coordinated water molecules from the 1D CPs. After the removal of water molecules, the de-solvated coordination polymer is stable up to 250 °C. Subsequently, the organic moieties start to decompose within the temperature range of 250–450 °C, resulting in the collapse of the 1D structure (Fig. S3b†). In contrast, Zn–CP/rGO composites exhibit an additional weight loss of 16.6% starting at 475 °C, which is due to the decomposition of the carbonaceous material (rGO) as shown in Fig. S3c.† It is interesting to note that Zn–CP/rGO is more thermally stable than Zn–CP, which is the result of the formation of a robust heterostructure between the 1D coordination polymer and rGO nanosheets (Fig. S3d†). Raman analysis is conducted to validate the presence of rGO in the nanocomposite. Both rGO and Zn–CP/rGO exhibited two distinct signatures at around 1299 and 1601 cm−1 corresponding to D and G bands, respectively (Fig. S4†).44 The G band is due to the in-plane vibration (E2g vibration) of the sp2 hybridized carbon atom (C–C stretching vibration), whereas the D band is indicative of the vibration of the sp3 bonded carbon atom (k-point phonons) of A1g symmetry arising due to the disorders and defects in the material.45 The intensity of the D band is higher than that of the G band (ID/IG > 1) for both the samples, demonstrating the presence of a large number of defects (point/dislocation-like defects, bending, etc.) and disorders in the graphene composite.46 The electronic states and elemental compositions of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO samples are further investigated by XPS analysis. The full survey spectra in Fig. 4a confirm the presence of Zn, C, O and N elements in Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO samples. For both the samples, the high resolution Zn 2p spectra display spin–orbit peaks at binding energies of 1022.7 and 1045.8 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. The binding energy separation of 23.1 eV confirms the presence of Zn2+ ions (Fig. 4b).16,47,48 For the N 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 4c, the binding energies at 398.7, 399.7 and 400.5 eV correspond to the N–Zn, N–C and N–H bonds of Zn–CP, respectively. Similar N 1s peaks are obtained for the Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite.48 The N–C and N–Zn signals further confirm the presence of the 4,4′-bpy linker coordinated to Zn2+ ions in the mixed linker coordination polymers.48Fig. 4d shows the de-convoluted O 1s spectra of both materials. The peaks at 531.4, 532.2 and 533.5 eV are assigned to Zn–O, Zn–OH2 and C–O species, respectively.47 The C 1s spectra of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are fitted to four peaks centred at 284.5, 285.7, 286.5 and 288.6 eV, which are related to C–C/CC, C–N, C–O and O–CO functional groups, respectively (Fig. S5†).49

The surface area and pore size distribution of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are obtained from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms given in Fig. S6.† The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are found to be 13 and 15 m2 g−1 with the corresponding pore volumes of 0.046 and 0.016 cm3 g−1, respectively (Fig. S6†). The average pore diameters obtained from the BJH pore size distribution of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are 9.4 and 3.8 nm, respectively. Fig. 5 and S7† show the FESEM images of rGO, Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO samples. The rGO images in Fig. S7a and b† exhibit a porous wrinkled flake/sheet-like morphology stacked together by dispersive forces/interactions. The mixed ligand architecture of 1D Zn–CP synthesized by the slow diffusion technique displays irregular plate-like morphologies as shown in Fig. 5a and S7c.† However, the morphology of Zn–CP/rGO is similar to that of the pristine Zn–CP sample with a slight reduction in particle size (Fig. 5b and S7d†). Furthermore, the elemental compositions of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements (Fig. S8b and 5c†). The elemental mapping in Fig. 5d–g and S8c–f† corroborates the homogeneous distribution of Zn, C, O, C and N elements in the coordination polymers. Considering the differences in morphologies between rGO wrinkled sheets and Zn–CP plates, it is plausible to assume that the loading of Zn–CP crystals within the thin layers of the rGO matrix leads to the formation of sandwich structures. The TEM analysis in Fig. 6a and b also supports the layer-by-layer structure of the Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite. This demonstrates that ultrasonication assisted room temperature synthesis can be an effective way to prepare hybrid nanostructure materials. Fig. 6c shows clear lattice fringes obtained from the high-resolution TEM image, indicating the high crystallinity of the material. The inter-planar spacing of 0.34 nm matched well with the (002) crystal plane of the rGO nanosheets of the Zn–CP/rGO hybrid structure.

Electrochemical properties of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO hybrid nanocomposites
The electrochemical performances of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO samples are tested in a three-electrode system. Prior to all measurements, the electrode materials are stabilized by running 60 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The CV profiles of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO recorded in the potential range from 0 to 0.55 V are shown in Fig. 7a and S9.† For both materials, the CV curves display typical faradaic behaviour with well-defined pseudo-reversible redox peaks appearing during the anodic and cathodic sweeps. These redox peaks arise due to the intercalation/de-intercalation of OH− ions from the electrolyte into the interlayer spacing during the electrochemical processes.50,51 Based on the earlier reports,52 the following mechanism for the redox reaction is proposed,  
 Fig. 7  (a) CV profiles of Zn–CP/rGO at different scan rates (inset; logipversus logv plot), (b) comparative CV profiles at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1, (c) linear-fitted plot of EOP–ERPversus v½ (inset; linear-fitted plot of ipversus v½), (d) GCD profiles of Zn–CP/rGO at different current densities, (e) specific capacitance versus current density plot of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes, and (f) cycling stability and coulombic efficiency at a current density of 6 A g−1. 
There is an increase in the area of CV curves and peak current densities when the scan rate is increased from 5 to 90 mV s−1. Similarly, the anodic (oxidation) and cathodic (reduction) peaks move towards higher and lower potential values, respectively. This phenomenon is known to occur due to the difference in electron transfer kinetics at elevated rates and is often observed for battery-type materials.24 The electrode/electrolyte interface under low scan rate conditions experiences slow uptake of charge owing to the slow migration of electrons from the electrode to electrolyte. At higher scan rates, the actual potential at the electrode surface/electrolyte interface is different from the voltage applied. Thus, a large amount of potential is needed to expiate the potential variation.40 However, an improved electrochemical performance in terms of current density/charge transfer with a large integrated area is obtained for Zn–CP/rGO compared to the Zn–CP electrode (Fig. 7b). This is due to the fact that a unique 1D chain with interlayer spacing provides additional active sites for ultrafast OH− ion migration. The 1D chains synergistically coupled with conductive rGO sheets through strong p–π interactions which further promote unimpeded charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical reactions.53 It is important to note that bare Ni-foam (NF) has a flat CV with no apparent redox activity and charge contribution to the total capacity (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the potential difference between the oxidation peak potential (EOP) and the reduction peak potential (ERP) at the maximum current density (ΔEP = EOP − ERP) is very low at lower scan rates indicating the superior rate reversibility of the electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the plot of (ΔEP) versus v½ in Fig. 7c is a straight line demonstrating excellent kinetic reversibility of the Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes at all scan rates. Additionally, the (ΔEP) value increases linearly with v½, which indicates that the time lapse for electron transfer kinetics is proportional to the scan rate (v). It is important to note that the peak current density (ip) is dependent on the concentration of OH− ions at the surface of the electrode.54 Hence, the linearity between the anodic peak current density (ip) and v½ in the Randles–Sevcik plot for Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes bears much significance (inset of Fig. 7c). The linear relationship obtained for both the materials is due to the layer-by-layer structure of Zn–CP coupled with rGO, which offers higher diffusibility to OH− ions in the bulk phase even at higher scan rates. The non-faradaic contributions to the total charge transfer process are marked as shaded portions in the CV profiles for both electrodes, as shown in Fig. 7a and S9.† This arises due to the formation of a double layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.46 The CV plots for both Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO hybrid materials are converted to Csversus V plots using eqn (1) for all scan rates (Fig. S10a and S10b†). Furthermore, the graphical integration of Csversus V plots for both materials yielded specific capacitance (Cs) which is given in the insets of Fig. S10a and S10b.† The Cs values for the Zn–CP electrode are found to be 315, 289, 262, 239, 208, 187 and 173 F g−1 whereas Zn–CP/rGO delivers capacitances of 520, 461, 406, 359, 310, 279 and 256 F g−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70 and 90 mV s−1, respectively. As the scan rate increases, the Cs value decreases. This is due to the fact that at a higher rate, most of the active sites at outer and inner surfaces are inaccessible to the fast moving OH− ions due to polarization and ohmic resistance.4,54 In order to quickly analyse the intrinsic charge storage kinetics of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes, we have used a semi-empirical formula i = avb where a and b are adjustable parameters. Furthermore, the b value (0.5 to 1) determines the type of charge storage in an electroactive material. If the b value is 0.5, the mechanism is diffusion-controlled as in the case of battery-like electrodes, while the value of 1 determines the surface-controlled mechanism as seen in capacitive and pseudocapacitive materials.55,56 The b-value can be obtained from the slope of logipversus logv plot as shown in the inset of Fig. 7a. The anodic slope values calculated from the linearly fitted logipversus logv plots of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are found to be 0.69 and 0.64, respectively. This is an indication that the charge storage kinetics is dominated by semi-infinitive diffusion processes and validates the battery-type behaviour for both electrodes.
The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements are carried out to assess the charge storing ability of Zn-based coordination polymers. The GCD profiles of both the materials obtained at different applied current densities over a wide voltage range of 0–0.5 V are shown in Fig. 7d and S11.† The GCD profiles with non-triangular shape and quasi-flat plateaus are clearly observed during the charge/discharge process, signifying the battery-type behaviour and the faradaic charge transfer process in Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes.57 Basically, GCD curves display two variations, (i) perpendicular (0 to 0.4 V) due to EDLC formation and (ii) sloped (0.4 to 0.5 V) variations due to the faradaic redox process. The comparative GCD profiles of the Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite and pristine Zn–CP at 1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. S12,† which disclose that the Zn–CP/rGO electrode takes a longer time to discharge than the pristine Zn–CP electrode. The specific capacitances (Cs) of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposites are estimated from the GCD curves using eqn (2) and plotted in Fig. 7e. The Zn–CP/rGO electrode delivered a capacitance of 377 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, while the Zn–CP electrode delivered only 261 F g−1 at the same current density. Evidently, the enhanced electrochemical performance for the Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite is due to the dual contribution of synergistically assembled rGO nanosheets with layered 1D coordination polymers. The hybrid assembly provides (i) unhindered migration of OH− ions due to the interlayer spacing originating from the H-bonding/π–π interactions between different layers, (ii) the wrinkled rGO nanosheet induced active sites and large voids, which offer an ion buffering pool for dual-side adsorption and ultrafast mobility of electrolyte ions, and (iii) improved electronic conductivity as a result of weak internal/contact resistance between the solid electrode surface and the electrolyte. The charge storage performance of the Zn–CP/rGO sample is compared with those of the Zn-based MOF/CPs and other transition metal-based MOF/CPs in Table S4.† The rate performances of Zn–CP/rGO and pristine Zn–CP electrodes are evaluated by plotting Csversus the applied current density as shown in Fig. 7e. The Cs value decreases gradually with increasing current density. At high current densities, all the inner/bulk active surfaces of the electrode are inaccessible by the fast moving OH− ions resulting in inferior rate performances.4 Nevertheless, the rate efficiency of the Zn–CP/rGO electrode is found to be ∼53%, when the current density reaches 10 A g−1. This is because of the unrestricted diffusion of OH− into the interlayers in the bulk of the coordination polymer. The coulombic efficiencies (η) of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are calculated at a current density of 6 A g−1 using the equation,  where tD and tC are discharging and charging times, respectively.46 The calculated η values for both electrodes are plotted in Fig. 7f. It is important to note that the ∼97% value of η is maintained by both the samples in all the cycles performed. This result suggests that (i) the faradaic redox reactions in the coordination polymers are kinetically fast and highly reversible, (ii) complete access of interlayer active sites by electrolyte ions under high rate conditions and (iii) excellent feasibility of the redox reactions with no loss of conductivity.
Similarly, the long term stability of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO electrode materials is evaluated by continuous 6000 charge–discharge cycles at 6 A g−1. The Zn–CP/rGO sample displayed good cycling stability with more than 85% capacity retention during 6000 GCD cycles, whereas the Zn–CP sample retained only 61% capacity as shown in Fig. 7f. Clearly, the Zn–CP/rGO heterocomposite displays outstanding cycling stability than pristine Zn–CP, which is due to the formation of robust heterostructures between the wrinkled rGO nanosheets and the Zn-based coordination polymer through strong p–π interactions.53 Such excellent performance is directly related to the uninterrupted migration of OH− ions through the porous structure, architectural firmness/robustness and the crystal phase stability of the Zn–CP/rGO electrode under alkaline conditions. The crystal phase stability of the Zn–CP/rGO electrode material after a prolonged charge–discharge test is verified by the powder X-ray diffraction pattern recorded before and after 6000 cycles (Fig. S13†). The XRD pattern shows slight changes in the composition of Zn–CP/rGO after 6000 GCD cycles in alkaline medium. The specific capacities (Cs × ΔV) of both the battery-type materials are plotted in Fig. 8a, which further corroborates the excellent performance of the Zn–CP/rGO electrode. Moreover, the diffusion and interfacial charge-transfer kinetics of Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposites are studied by EIS measurements at a bias potential of 0.15 V (frequency range: 0.01–105 Hz) as shown in Fig. 8b. The complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting method is used to fit the impedance data (Nyquist plot) and the corresponding Randle's equivalent circuit diagram is given in the inset of Fig. 8b. The Nyquist plot contains a quasi-semicircle in the high frequency region (real Z′) and almost a vertical line in the low frequency region (imaginary Z′′). The intercept of the quasi-semicircle in the high-frequency region (real axis) signifies the total series resistance (Rs) which is the sum of resistance offered by the electrolyte and the resistance arising from the electrical contact between the working material and the current collector. The diameter of the quasi-semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct, marked in the inset of Fig. 8b), which is a combination of the working/counter electrode–electrolyte interfacial resistance. During the redox process, the transportation of OH− ions into the electrode materials offers a diffusive resistance, also called Warburg impedance (Zw). Zw can be represented by the vertical line in the low frequency region in the Nyquist plot. The steeper the line (more slope), the more the ideal capacitive behaviour of electrodes.29,53,58 The EIS data are fitted in ZSimpWin 3.21 software and the corresponding Rct values for Zn–CP and Zn–CP/rGO are found to be 1.35 and 1.1 Ω, respectively, while the Rs values are found to be 0.98 and 0.73 Ω, respectively.

Hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device fabrication
To evaluate the possibility of Zn–CP/rGO being used as a next generation electrode material, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device (Zn–CP/rGO∥AC) is fabricated using a two-electrode system. Initially, few coin cells are assembled using Zn–CP/rGO and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, which are separated by filter paper as schematically illustrated in Fig. S14.† Prior to electrochemical testing, coin cells are soaked in 2 M aqueous KOH electrolyte solution for 5 minutes. The CV and GCD measurements of activated carbon in a three-electrode system using 2 M aqueous KOH solution are shown in Fig. S15.† Clearly, activated carbon behaves as a typical EDLC material which is evident from its rectangular CV (Fig. S15a†). The specific capacitance obtained from the GCD curve for AC is 192 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 within the potential range of −1 to 0 V (Fig. S15b†). The ratio of mass loading of the positive and negative electrodes (M+/M−) of the HSC is 1.02. Fig. 9a shows the comparative CV curves of AC and Zn–CP/rGO electrodes measured in the respective potential windows from −1 to 0 V and 0 to 0.55 V at a fixed scan rate of 30 mV s−1. Thus, it is anticipated that the ideal potential window of the HSC device can be extended up to 1.55 V. To validate this, the CV profiles of the HSC at different potential windows at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 9b, which demonstrate that the cut off potential window of HSC is 1.55 V, beyond which oxygen evolution occurs. Thus, the CV profiles of the HSC device (Zn–CP/rGO∥AC) in the potential window of 0–1.55 V at scan rates of 10–150 mV s−1 are plotted in Fig. 9c. Notably, the shape of the CV curve remains almost unchanged at high scan rates and displays two weak redox peaks indicating both electrostatic (non-faradaic due to AC) and electrochemical (faradaic due to Zn–CP/rGO) contributions to the total charge storage in the hybrid device.59 Furthermore, the linear relationship between the CV area and the scan rate is an indication of smooth diffusion of OH− ions into the bulk phase of 1D coordination polymers. Fig. 9d shows the GCD profile of the Zn–CP/rGO∥AC HSC device at applied current densities of 1 to 10 A g−1. The discharge profiles at high current densities display a negligible IR drop, which indicates minimal internal resistance and improved conductivity of the hybrid supercapacitor device.3 The specific capacitance and capacity (Cs × ΔV) values of the HSC device are calculated from GCD curves by adding positive and negative electrode masses and plotted in Fig. S16.†

The long-term stability of the hybrid SC device (Zn–CP/rGO∥AC) is crucial for its practical application. Hence, the HSC device is subjected to 10000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at a high current density of 3 A g−1. Remarkably, the HSC retained ∼86% of the initial capacity after 10k GCD cycles (Fig. 9e). This is attributed to the electrochemically induced surface activation and the pore opening of the coordination polymers.13 The HSC device also maintains a good coulombic efficiency (η) of 93% (Fig. 9e). The EIS measurements are conducted to examine the nature of electron transfer in the hybrid SC device at a bias potential of 0.3 V within the frequency range of 10−5–100 kHz. The Nyquist plot of the Zn–CP/rGO∥AC device obtained before and after 10000 cycles shows a small semicircle in the high frequency region (inset of Fig. 9f). However, the EIS plot after the cycling stability test displayed less deviation suggesting good cycling stability of the hybrid device. The EIS data are fitted to generate an equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 9f). Notably, before 10k cycles, the hybrid device's Rs and Rct values were 0.63 and 1.6 Ω, respectively, while after 10k cycles, the values rose to 0.71 and 21.4 Ω, respectively. Energy (Ed) and power density (Pd) values are two key parameters for estimating the efficiency of a hybrid SC device. The Ed and Pd values of the Zn–CP/rGO∥AC device are calculated using eqn (3) and (4) and presented in the Ragone plot (Fig. 10). The Zn–CP/rGO∥AC HSC device delivers a suitable energy density of ∼13.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼789 W kg−1. It further continues to deliver a high power density of ∼7746 W kg−1 without much compromising its energy density. Furthermore, the performance of the device in terms of Ed and Pd values is found to be better than the values reported earlier on pristine MOF/CP based electrodes.28,33,35,58,60 For practical demonstration, three coin cells are joined in series combination to power 3 V yellow and red LEDs which could glow for more than 5 min without brightness fading (inset of Fig. 10). The Zn–CP/rGO∥AC HSC device has shown good electrochemical activity, which is attributed to the combined effect of wrinkled rGO sheets and 1D coordination polymers. The supramolecular layer-by-layer structure that originates from the 1D coordination polymer offers a short unidirectional path for unimpeded ion transportation and compensates the volume expansion during electrochemical reactions.

To sum up, the ultrasonication assisted room temperature synthesis is an elegant approach to prepare Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposites with plate-like morphologies. The rGO nanosheet bonded with the Zn-based coordination polymer acts as a conducting matrix and provides an ion-buffering pool for boosted electrochemical activities. The resultant Zn–CP/rGO hybrid material can be explored as a next generation hybrid supercapacitor with high power density and good cycling stability.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a new Zn-based 1D coordination polymer (Zn–CP) using a mixed linker approach at room temperature. Structural analysis revealed that the one-dimensional polymer extended in three dimensions through hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, a 2D rGO nanosheet is combined with Zn–CP to prepare a robust Zn–CP/rGO heterostructure by employing a simple ultrasonication assisted room temperature protocol. The physicochemical analyses (FESEM and TEM) show a uniform elemental composition and a layer-by-layer structure of the plate-like Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite. The hybrid material with the unique layered structure exhibits good electrochemical performance, when tested in three and two-electrode systems. The Zn–CP/rGO heteronanocomposite shows high rate capacity (53% of the initial rate at 10 A g−1), improved kinetic reversibility, long term stability (85% capacity retention after 6000 cycles), 97% coulombic efficiency and excellent ion diffusibility into the interlayer spacing than pristine Zn–CP. Furthermore, the GCD analysis of the Zn–CP/rGO heterostructure shows enhancement in the specific capacitance (377 F g−1) compared to the pure Zn–CP electrode (261 F g−1) at 1 A g−1. For real-time application, an HSC device (Zn–CP/rGO∥AC) is fabricated using the Swagelok cell technique that retained 86% of initial capacitance upon 10000 GCD cycles and delivered an extremely high specific power (7446 W kg−1). The efficiency is demonstrated by fabricating three coin cells to light up the yellow and red LEDs of 3 V for more than 5 minutes. It is believed that the present work offers additional insights into the development of mixed-ligand architected low-dimensional CPs synergistically combined with rGO as promising electrode materials for next-generation hybrid supercapacitors.
