Applying only a trace amount of Pd nanosheets readily led to a remarkably enhanced performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This finding provides an effective strategy to build efficient charge-transport materials for improving the overall performance of PSCs.
Recently, solution-processed organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yielding an impressive 20.1% certified conversion efficiency, have overtaken organic and quantum dot solar cells in a relatively short time.1–10 In the general configuration of PSCs, a perovskite layer is sandwiched between the electron transport material (ETM) and hole transport material (HTM), while the mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 is used as the scaffold for the perovskite absorber. Although HTM-free PSCs can exhibit efficiency over 10%, HTMs are indispensable to PSCs with high efficiency by restraining photo-induced carrier recombination and facilitating hole-extracting and transportation.6,11–13
To date, HTMs in PSCs mainly involve nitrogen-containing donor materials, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)3–5 and poly-(triarylamine) (PTAA),14,15 and sulfur-containing conducting materials, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)16–18 and tetrathiafulvalene derivative (TTF).19 However, these HTMs have relatively low electrical conductivity, which significantly limits the performance of the device. To solve this issue, the highly hygroscopic p-type dopant Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) has been commonly adopted into nitrogen-containing HTM layers (HTLs) to decrease the series resistance (Rs), increase the conductivity, and thus improve the performance of the cells.3–5,7,10,14,15 Besides, a series of highly conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes,20,21 reduced graphene oxide,22 graphdiyne,23 and graphene,24 have been embedded into HTLs, yielding significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances. In general, metals are much more conductive materials. However, there has been no report on the use of metal nanostructures to improve the conductivity of HTLs and thus to enhance the overall performances of PSCs.
We report in this study that the incorporation of a class of unique 2D metal nanomaterials, namely, surface-clean ultrathin Pd nanosheets, into HTLs significantly improves the conversion efficiency of PSCs. In its bulky form, Pd is a highly conductive metal. Pd nanosheets with controllable sizes have been successfully prepared by wet-chemistry and have exhibited unique properties for various applications.25–30 Good conductivity was also demonstrated in the nanowires of face-to-face assembled Pd nanosheets.31 The enhanced conductivity can be expected to facilitate the charge transport from perovskite to gold cathode and thus should result in an improved photovoltaic performance. When doped in HTLs, only a trace amount of Pd nanosheets is required to boost the overall photovoltaic performance of PSCs. When a sulfur-containing polymer, P3HT, was used as a HTM, the doping of 0.1 wt% of Pd nanosheets readily improved the photon-to-current conversion efficiency from 11.8% to 15.4% for the best fabricated cells. In the case of Spiro-OMeTAD, the incorporation of 0.05 wt% of Pd increased the average efficiency of PSCs from 17.0% to 18.1%.
To ensure the high conductivity of Pd nanosheets, surface-clean hexagonal Pd nanosheets with a reasonable large size were synthesized. Small surface-clean Pd nanosheets with diameters of ∼30 nm were first prepared by reported procedures,25,26 and used as seeds for the growth of the large Pd nanosheets (see Experimental section for details). As shown in the transmission electron microscopy image (Fig. 1a), the obtained Pd nanosheets had a rather uniform diameter of ∼160 nm. The obtained large Pd nanosheets were embedded into HTLs by mixing them with HTMs in various contents for the fabrication of PSCs. The fabricated PSCs had a typical p-i-n configuration of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au (Fig. 1b). In a typical fabrication procedure, the compact TiO2 layer and mesoporous TiO2 layer were deposited on a FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) conducting glass substrate, to achieve electron extraction and transport. The perovskite layer was deposited on TiO2 by adopting the method developed by Park et al.32 The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2, CH3NH3I and DMSO with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 in DMF. The completely dissolved precursor solution was spin-coated on the prepared substrate, followed by dropping diethyl ether on the rotating substrate. Finally, the HTL and gold cathode were subsequently deposited on top of the perovskite layer to complete the fabrication. The entire fabrication process was carried out at a common relative humidity of ∼15%. The fabricated perovskite film was characterized by UV-vis (Fig. S1a†) and XRD (Fig. S1b†).

To evaluate whether doping surface-clean Pd nanosheets into HTLs would improve the overall performance of PSCs, a sulfur-containing polymer, P3HT, that typically gives poor efficiency was first chosen as the HTM. The Pd nanosheets were mixed with P3HT to obtain a Pd/P3HT mixture. The mixture was then spin-coated onto the perovskite layers to form HTLs. The fabricated devices were characterized by SEM (Fig. 2a and S2†). The content of Pd nanosheets in HTLs was varied from 0 to 0.15 wt%. As shown in Fig. 2b and S3a,† the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra (IPCE) of these devices spanned from the UV region to 800 nm, matching well with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of perovskite film (Fig. S1a†). The J–V characteristics of these devices were also measured under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. As illustrated in Fig. 2, S3 and Table S1,† the devices based on P3HT offered an average efficiency of 10.6% ± 1.5%, with the best efficiency of 11.8%. The remarkably increased performances were observed as the content of Pd nanosheets was increased from 0 to 0.1 wt%. In comparison with devices using only P3HT, the devices based on Pd/P3HT (0.1 wt%) exhibited much better photovoltaic performance, with the best efficiency of 15.4%. Measurements over 30 devices gave an average efficiency of 14.2% ± 1.3%. Both the FF and Jsc of Pd-doped PSCs were improved (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2,† the presence of relatively small hysteresis behaviour for these cells could be due to the nature of perovskite films.

More detailed measurements revealed that the significant improvement was mainly due to the increased conductivity of HTLs. By doping with Pd nanosheets, the charge-transport resistance (Rs) (Fig. 3, S5 and Table S1†) dramatically decreased, as reflected by the arcs at a high-intermediate frequency of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSCs (Fig. 4a and S6a†). The quenched photoluminescence behavior (Fig. 4b and S6b†) of the film with Pd/P3HT (0.1 wt%) also clearly confirmed the enhanced hole transfer ability of P3HT due to the introduction of Pd nanosheets (Fig. 4c).

Although the increased conductivity (Table S1†) and decreased charge-transport resistance (reflected by the EIS, Fig. 4a and S6a†) were observed when the Pd nanosheets concentration was further increased, there was an optimized doping amount of Pd nanosheets to achieve the best performance. When the doping amount was increased to 0.15 wt%, a drop in the device's performance was observed (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 4c, compared to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV), the higher work function of Pd (−5.0 eV) could afford an efficient hole-extraction pathway. However, the work function of Pd is lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.9 eV). Such an energy matching could also create pathways of undesirable back-electron transfer, particularly when too much Pd nanosheets were added such that some of them aggregated to generate a direct electrical contact between the perovskite and Au electrode (Fig. 4d). This situation might explain why the decreased performance was observed when the doping content of the Pd nanosheets was increased from 0.10% to 0.15%. A similar result was also observed in another reported study.21
The conductivity of additive materials is expected to impact the performance of PSCs. For comparison, PSC devices with graphene dopant in HTM were fabricated and investigated. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3,† the performance of the devices based on Pd nanosheets greatly outperformed the optimized device with graphene sheets. This result is attributed to higher conductivity of Pd nanosheets (10 Ω sq−1 of square resistance at 298 K) compared to the graphene sheet (190 Ω sq−1 of square resistance at 298 K). Furthermore, Pd nanosheets protected by PVP were also synthesized following our previously reported methods,25,26 and used as a dopant for the P3HT layer. However, a much poorer performance was observed (Fig. S7b†). These results clearly imply that the further enhancement in the conductivity of dopant should further improve the devices’ performance.
With respect to HTMs, when doped with Li salt and a pyridine derivative, Spiro-OMeTAD becomes one of the most successful HTMs, achieving an impressive solar power-conversion efficiency. It was also found that the introduction of highly conductive Pd nanosheets into Li salt-doped Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 5a and S8†) readily further improved the overall performance of PSCs. The doping content of Pd nanosheets was varied from 0 to 0.1 wt%. As expected, as shown in Fig. 5 and S9 and Table S4,† the devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD gave an average efficiency of 17.0% ± 1.1%, with the best efficiency of 17.8%. In comparison, the devices with Pd/Spiro-OMeTAD (0.05 wt%) offered an average efficiency at 18.1% ± 1.0%, with the best device reaching a power-conversion efficiency of 18.9%.

Similar to the result of P3HT, the performance of the device with Spiro-OMeTAD increased as the content of Pd nanosheets was increased from 0% to 0.05%. However, when the loading of Pd nanosheets was further increased to 0.1 wt%, the devices exhibited reduced performance (Fig. S9 and S10†). As shown in Fig. S11,† the drop in the cells’ performance can also be attributed to the formation of an undesirable back-electron transfer pathway by the direct electrical contact between the perovskite and Au electrode when too much Pd nanosheets were doped, consistent with the result from the devices with P3HT. Due to the presence of only a trace amount of Pd nanosheets in the HTM layer, the cell stabilities almost did not alter (Fig. S12†).
Conclusions
In summary, surface-clean Pd nanosheets were synthesized and successfully employed as an effective dopant of HTMs for improving the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. Only a trace amount of Pd nanosheets was required to enhance the photon-to-current efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The enhanced performance was attributed to the improved conductivity of HTM layers by introducing highly conductive Pd nanosheets. With Pd nanosheets doped in the HTM layers, the best efficiencies of 15.4% and 18.9% were achieved for perovskite solar cells using P3HT and Li salt-doped Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, respectively. These numbers greatly outperformed the reference devices based on pure P3HT (11.8%) and Li salt-doped Spiro-OMeTAD (17.8%). This study is expected to stimulate more research efforts in to seeking more conductive materials as effective dopants of HTMs to further enhance the performance of PSCs. A similar strategy might be helpful for enhancing the performance of LEDs based on organic hole transport materials.
