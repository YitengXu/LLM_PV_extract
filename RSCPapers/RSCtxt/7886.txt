    , Accepted 27th March 2015First published on 30th March 2015AbstractNanostructured semiconductor electrodes have garnered intense recent interest for use in various solar energy conversion systems since they offer the possibilities of circumventing low efficiencies associated with short diffusion length bulk materials as well as optimizing light absorption in dye-sensitized solar cells. In such context, knowledge of the conduction (ECB) and valence band (EVB) edge positions are the most important electronic properties in order to optimize performance and obtain a detailed understanding of relevant electron-transfer processes. However, there is no reliable direct method to measure the band edges in nanostructured semiconductor electrodes. Spectroeletrochemical methods have been utilized, but the nature of the absorbing species and interpretation of results are unsettled issues. Herein we describe a new simple spectroelectrochemical method which simultaneously produces the conduction band energy and the extinction coefficient, ε, of free conduction band electrons in nanoparticle TiO2 electrodes.
During the early 1990s, Fitzmaurice et al. utilized spectroelectrochemical measurements to estimate the flat band positions in nanostructured semiconductor films.1–8 Several problems of the interpretations of these results were recently pointed out, and a new variable temperature spectroelectrochemistry (VTSEC) method introduced as a way to overcome them.9 The VTSEC method is not ideal, however, since it relies on two assumptions: the dominant absorbing species of the visible and near IR (Vis/NIR) wavelengths measured are free conduction band electrons and the only effect of the variable temperature is the free electron concentration. The first assumption of the absorbing species has not been firmly established and is the subject of continued disagreement, with alternative assignments of a trapped electron absorbance or a combination of free and trapped electrons (i.e. total electron concentration).10–13 Regarding the second assumption, there is likely a temperature dependence of the band gap, dielectric constant, phonons (thus extinction coefficient) of TiO2 employed that was not accounted for and may lead to significant error. Further, VTSEC is fairly tedious to control and not amenable as a routine measurement. The motive of this work is primarily to accurately determine the conduction band edge position of nanostructured semiconductor electrodes. In addition, it is shown that that free conduction band electrons dominate the Vis/NIR absorption and the extinction coefficient of free electrons in nanoparticle TiO2 can be accurately extracted.

Fig. 1 shows typical difference absorption, ΔA, spectra of a TiO2 film immersed in a pH 12.8 aqueous electrolyte. The absorbance increases in the visible and the near-IR regions with increasing (negative) applied potential (E) with a concomitant decrease at wavelengths shorter than ∼380 nm. The absorbance below 380 nm corresponds to the band gap transition of anatase. The bleach of the band gap absorbance is attributed to the filling of the low energy states of conduction band which block the lowest energy band gap transition, vide infra.14

The absorption edge due to the bandgap transition can be determined from a Tauc plot using the relation:15 (αhv)η = A′(EG − hv)(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, EG is the bandgap energy, A′ is a constant and the value of η is 1/2 for an indirect transition, which is the case for anatase.16–19 We note that there is a broadening of the absorption curve which causes some error in the absolute band gap determination. At a constant temperature and electrolyte composition, however, the magnitude of the broadening remains constant and does not contribute to the shift in the band gap absorbance, which is of primary interest here. Fig. 2a shows a typical Tauc plot used to determine the band gap energy of the anatase nanoparticles. The steep fraction of the (αhν)1/2vs. hν curve fit between 3.444 eV to 3.547 eV (360–350 nm) was extrapolated to determine the band gap and it was found to be 3.209 eV. Fig. 2b shows the blue shift of the bandgap with increasing negative applied potentials. Such band gap widening in highly doped semiconductors has been observed in many studies and is known as Burstein–Moss shift.14,20–24 When the population of the electrons in the conduction band is increased by applying an external bias, the lowest energy states of the conduction band becomes occupied by the electrons which can affect the absorption edge by increasing the energy to excite electrons from valence band to the unoccupied states of the conduction band. The magnitude of the band gap widening (ΔEG) due to the above mentioned phenomenon can be written as: (2)where meh* is the reduced effective mass of the charge carriers and nCB is the concentration of electrons in the conduction band. Although a range of values can be found in literature for the effective mass of electrons (me*) in anatase TiO2, it was reported to be equal to the mass of an electron by Tang et al.25 which is further supported by other reports26,27 and thus widely used.28–31 A smaller range of values for the effective mass of holes (mh*) are also present in literature.7,26,27 In this work, we take the mass of an electron as mh*. While the value of meh* affects the determination of nCB, the effect is systematic and minor. Values of conduction band edges (ECB/q) and absorption co-efficient (ε) were determined considering a reasonable range of literature values for me* and mh*, and are shown in the supporting information (Table S1, ESI†).

Good connectivity among nanoparticles immersed in an equipotential environment results in a constant Fermi level (EF) within the semiconductor NP film that can be controlled by applying an external bias to the contacting conductive substrate.32–34 When the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band minimum by applying more negative potentials, the density of the conduction band electrons increases exponentially according to: (3) Here, NCB is the density of states (DOS) in the conduction band given by, (4)According to eqn (2) and (3), (ΔEG)3/2 should change exponentially with EF if the assigned Burstein–Moss type band gap widening is the only effect behind the observed bandgap absorbance bleach. A plot of (ΔEG)3/2vs. applied potential shown in Fig. 3 is in excellent agreement with this interpretation. The density of electrons in the conduction band can be determined using eqn (2) for a given applied potential. Table 1 below shows the magnitudes of band gap shift under various applied potentials and the calculated density of electrons in the CB resulting in the shift.

Importantly, once nCB is known at a given potential, where E = EF/q, the conduction band edge energy can be calculated directly from eqn (3). Table 1 shows values of ECB calculated under a range of applied potentials. These results indicate an upward shift of the conduction band edge when the applied potential is increased, consistent with our prior results.9 Accumulation of electrons in electrically active states on the surface or within close vicinity of the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 films can cause a change in the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer.12,35,36
The increasing absorbance in the visible/near-IR region with bias shown in Fig. 1 is due to the increasing electron population in the TiO2. We assign this absorption to free conduction band electrons, as opposed to trapped or total electrons, for the following reasons. Similar absorbance spectra were found for Nb-doped nanoparticle TiO2 which exhibited increasing visible/near-IR absorption and band gap widening with increasing concentration of Nb that was shown to be due to increased free carriers.37 The monotonically increasing absorbance with wavelength is also characteristic of free carrier absorption.15 Absorption of a photon can excite a free electron to a higher energy level within the same energy band, which is accompanied by a change in momentum through scattering (e.g. interaction with lattice phonons or ionized impurities). According to the Drude–Zener theory, the free electron intra-band absorption gives rise to a wavelength dependent absorption spectrum according to, ΔA = CλP(5)where C is a scaling parameter, λ is the wavelength of light and the exponent, P, is a value from 1.5–3.5, depending on the scattering mechanism.15,38–42Fig. 4a shows the difference absorption spectra in the wave length range of 450 nm to 800 nm fitted to eqn (5). A global fit of P gave P = 1.85 which is well matched to the theoretical value of P = 1.5 for the absorption by free electrons coupled with acoustic phonon scattering.15 The slightly higher value of P might arise due to the presence of impurities in the semiconductor material. We further note that analogous measurements were performed for electrodes in contact with a variety of aqueous electrolytes with different pH values as well as non-aqueous electrolytes; in all cases P is close to 1.5.43 This trend is consistent with the assignment of absorbance by free conduction band electrons since this absorbance is a property of the bulk nanoparticle and independent of the contacting electrolyte.

(b) Plot of density of electrons in conduction band (nCB) calculated from band-gap shift (ΔEG) using eqn (3) and an absorbance (ΔA) measured at 780 nm, for different applied potentials. The potentials mentioned in the figure are given vs. SCE. 

Fig. 4b shows plots of ΔA measured at 780 nm vs. the density of CB electrons calculated from the band gap shift (Table 1). The linear correlation of nCB and ΔA confirms our assignment and allows for the calculation of the extinction coefficient (ε) of conduction band electrons from the slope according to Beer's law: ΔA = εl(1 − p)nCB(6)where l is the electrode thickness and p is the porosity. Using values of l = 6.95 μm and p = 0.71, ε was calculated to be 9.9 ± 0.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 780 nm. Our calculated value of ε is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the values found in literature measured using different methods.8,44–47 Prior methods did not discriminate free conduction band electrons from the large concentration of trapped electrons, nTrap, however, thus a large fraction of electrons in TiO2 are not participating in the absorption pattern in the visible range, which supports the higher value of ε determined here. When charge extraction measurements were performed (see ESI† for details) to quantify the total electron concentration, ntotal, in TiO2, a valued of ε = 784 M−1 cm−1 is determined, consistent with literature underestimates. A plot of ΔA vs. ntotal for different applied potentials is given in supporting information (Fig. S3a, ESI†) which shows non-linear behavior at low applied potentials, further supporting the assignment of this absorption to nCB as opposed ntotal. Finally, we note that our previous attempt at determining ε via VTSEC produced an extinction coefficient value very close to the value determined here (ε = 1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 compared to 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 950 nm). This is in reasonable agreement, especially considering the assumptions and the large extrapolation to determine ε.
In summary, our data indicates that the same electrons are responsible for the increased absorbance feature in the visible/near-IR range as well as the band gap widening; thus we can assign these optical signatures to free conduction band electrons, as we and others previously suggested. This allowed us to establish the first unambiguous, relatively simple and accurate method to simultaneously determine the conduction band energy of nanoparticle semiconductor electrodes and the extinction coefficient of free conduction band electrons by monitoring the change in electrode absorbance as a function of applied potentials. Thus, this report solves a long standing problem of being able to determine the band edge positions in nanoparticle semiconductor electrodes, establishes the identity of visible/near-IR absorbing electrons in TiO2 and allows for an accurate determination of the free conduction band extinction coefficient.
Methods
The transparent mesoporous TiO2 electrode was prepared by spreading HT/SP TiO2 (anatase) paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Hartford Glass) by the doctor-blade method, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 15 min in air. The thickness of the TiO2 film was measured by a Dektak3 Surface Profiler. Electrolyte solutions were made by dissolving recrystallized potassium chloride into Millipore water (18.2 MΩ cm). KOH was added to this solution to adjust the pH to 12.8 measured by a Fischer Scientific Accumet pH meter. In spectroelectrochemical measurements, the transmittance (%T) of the film was measured by a Perkin Elmer Lamda 35 UV-Vis spectrophotometer under an external bias provided by an AutoLab potentiostat. A three electrode electrochemical cell, made by customizing a commercial spectroscopic cuvette, was placed into the UV-Vis spectrophotometer such that the TiO2 film remained perpendicular to the optical path. A platinum wire was used as counter electrode and a commercial Ag/AgCl (“No leak”) was used as reference electrode. The TiO2 films were aged overnight in contact with the electrolyte solutions prior to any experiment. The temperature of the electrochemical cells was 22 ± 0.5 °C during the measurements. During spectroelectrochemical measurements, each film was stabilized at an applied bias for 5 minutes and %T of the electrode was measured. A control experiment was done with bare FTO electrode to confirm that the FTO has no contribution of the change in %T with varying potential. While determining the band gap using a Tauc plot, the absorbance spectra measured while using bare FTO electrode was subtracted from the spectra measured with TiO2 film on FTO. Thus the absorbance of TiO2 film was calculated by eliminating the contribution of everything else in the optical path (FTO, cuvette and electrolyte). The absorbance of the free conduction band electrons was calculated in the wavelength range of 350–400 nm by extrapolating the absorbance spectra of the visible range and was subtracted from the absorbance of the TiO2 film to determine the absorbance of the band gap transition only. Stability of the film as well as reproducibility of the results were checked both spectroscopically as well as electrochemically to make sure that there is no irreversible change of the film during the measurements. The difference absorbance spectrum (ΔA) in the visible region was fitted to ΔA = CλP using OriginPro 9.0. A global fit of the spectra was done to get a single value of P. The wavelength range was selected from 450 nm to 800 nm considering the appearance of a broad peak at ∼400 nm and a strong solvent absorbance in the near IR region starting at ∼900 nm. The peak ∼400 nm was correlated to the surface trap states.
