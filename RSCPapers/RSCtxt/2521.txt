    , Accepted 7th March 2015First published on 13th March 2015AbstractThe role of polymers in artificial photosystems has been studied in detail. The photosystems were composed of tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) chloride as a photosensitizer (PS), colloidal Pt stabilized by polymer as a hydrogen-evolving catalyst and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor, without the addition of a traditional molecular electron mediator. Comprehensive insights into the production of hydrogen on irradiation with visible light were achieved. Several polymers, including neutral polyvinyl pyrrolidone, anionic poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) and poly(acrylic acid) not only stabilized the nanoparticles, but were also effective in the production of hydrogen. Under the optimum conditions, an outstanding apparent quantum efficiency of 12.8% for the evolution of hydrogen was achieved. The formation of self-assembled and spatially separated donor–acceptor complexes via the non-covalent intermolecular interaction between PS and the polymer–Pt was pivotal in the efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen fuel. Important details of the photo-induced electron and energy transfer processes in the self-assembled artificial photosystems were determined by nanosecond transient absorption spectrometry and time-resolved fluorescence spectrometry. The initial step in the photo-catalytic production of hydrogen was a reductive quenching of the triplet excited state of the PS by sodium ascorbate, leading to a reduced form of PS, which could then be quickly quenched by the polymer. The rate-determining step was the electron transfer from PS to the catalyst via the polymer bridge.
1. Introduction
Lehn and Sauvage1 reported the first artificial photosynthesis system based on Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer (PS) and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as a hydrogen-evolving catalyst in early 1970s, followed closely by similar schemes reported independently by Kiwi and Gratzel2 and Okura and Kim-Thuan.3 Since then, the use of artificial photosynthesis for the evolution of hydrogen, which offers a facile method for the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen fuel, has been widely considered to be an attractive route to a future hydrogen-based economy.4–10 Artificial systems to produce molecular hydrogen usually consist of a PS, an electron mediator and an electron donor, and a hydrogen-evolving catalyst.11–15 The working mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 1, where a PS such as Ru(bpy)32+ absorbs light to generate a long-lived excited state. One electron is then transferred via a mediator such as methyl viologen or Rh(bpy)2Cl3 to a hydrogen-evolving catalyst, where H+ can obtain the electron to form molecular hydrogen. The oxidized Ru(bpy)33+ is reduced by the sacrificial electron donor to regenerate Ru(bpy)32+. The most important step in the system is the photo-induced electron transfer from a photo-excited PS to a hydrogen evolution catalyst. The direct injection of an electron from a PS to a catalyst generally leads to a very low efficiency of hydrogen production. The addition of an electron relay is often used to accelerate the electron transfer. However, this easily deactivates the multi-step electron transfer system as a result of significant energy loss and the dimerization or irreversible hydrogenation of the reduced electron relay.16 This limits the practical applications of the hydrogen production system with an electron mediator. The development of robust artificial photosynthetic systems that can work in the absence of electron mediators for efficient solar-to-hydrogen fuel conversion has been the focus of much research.
 Scheme 1  Mechanism of hydrogen evolution for an early four-component artificial photosynthetic system based on Ru(bpy)32+ as the PS, colloidal platinum as the catalyst, methyl viologen or Rh(bpy)2Cl3 as electron relays (ERs), and EDTA or TEA as electron donors (D). 
To improve the efficiency of hydrogen production in homogeneous aqueous solutions of photo-catalytic assemblies, much effort has been made to find both PSs with a high quantum efficiency (QE) and molecular hydrogen evolution catalysts.6,8,9,17 Many cobalt-,18–22 nickel-23–26 and iron-based27 molecular catalysts have been developed. The reduced species of these molecular catalysts have a strong capacity to reduce H2O to H2, but they often have poor photo-stability. The noble metals, especially Pt, are still widely used as hydrogen-producing catalysts to construct three-component systems without an electron relay.28–30 As a result of the heterogeneous environment, electron transfer between the PS molecules and the bare Pt NPs is severely blocked. One solution is that the PS can be attached to the catalyst either covalently or via coordination.31–33 Yang and coworkers suggested the use of multibranched porphyrin-functionalized Pt nanocomposites, self-assembled by hydrogen-bonded interactions, for the photo-catalytic production of hydrogen.34–36 However, the quantum yield of hydrogen achieved was as low as 3.0% under visible light irradiation. Fukuzumi and coworkers29,30,37 proposed another solution of protecting metal NPs (M = Pt, Ru, Fe) with poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP–M) and pioneered an enzymatic system for photo-catalytic H2 production using PVP–M as a hydrogen-evolving catalyst and Acr+-Mes or QuPh+-NA as the PS. In this micro-heterogeneous photosystem, the photo-catalyst underwent photo-induced electron transfer from the Mes or NA moieties to the singlet excited states of the corresponding Acr+˙ and QuPh+˙ moieties to produce an extremely long-lived electron transfer state capable of oxidizing NADH and reducing H+ on the surface of Pt–PVP, leading to efficient hydrogen evolution. A fast electron injection mechanism was proposed for artificial photosystems composed of PS, polymer-functionalized Pt catalysts and a sacrificial electron donor. Such an explanation seems to be expedient, but several important scientific issues for the three-component photosystems need to be clarified: what is responsible for the smooth electron transfer between PS and the hydrogen-evolving catalyst? What is the real role of the polymer?
We report here an artificial photosystem based on Ru(bpy)32+ as a PS, polymer-capped Pt NPs as catalysts and NaHA as a sacrificial electron donor for the efficient photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen, without the addition of a traditional molecular electron relay species. In this photosystem, the Ru(bpy)32+, polymer–Pt and NaHA can be simply self-assembled in situ to form a spatially separated donor–acceptor complex, achieving a higher efficiency of electron transfer from the PS to the catalyst. A QE for hydrogen of up to 12.8% can be achieved under irradiation with visible light. Various experimental parameters affecting the production of hydrogen were investigated, including the type of polymer, the size of the Pt NPs, the pH and the concentration of the components. Such a system avoids the use of a traditional molecular electron mediator and inherently eliminates the energy losses and back reactions associated with electron transfer to the relay. The function of polymers as molecular wires was highlighted. A comprehensive insight into the efficient evolution of hydrogen was achieved and this, in turn, has led us to develop more robust artificial photosystems for future applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Tris (2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) chloride hexahydrate (Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O) and the sodium salt of L-ascorbic acid (NaHA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, MW 450000) and polyacrylamide (PAM, MW 2 × 106–14 × 106) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 2000) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K-30, MW 40000) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG–PPG–PEG, P123, Mn approximately 5800) was purchased from Energy Chemical Co. Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, MW 70000) and poly(ethyleneimine) solution (PEI, average Mn approximately 60000 by GPC, average Mw approximately 750000 by LS, 50 wt% in water) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. All chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade.
2.2 Preparation of polymer-modified Pt colloids
Platinum colloidal solutions were prepared according to a previously reported method with some improvements.38 A 0.5 ml volume of an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (2.56 × 10−5 mol) was added to a 100 ml Schlenk flask with 25 ml of ethylene glycol solution containing 8 mM NaOH. The mixture was stirred magnetically and the ethylene glycol acted as both a reduction reagent and a solvent without the need for any additional reductant.39 The mixed solution was sealed and evacuated and then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min at room temperature. The sealed Schlenk flask was then placed in the center of a microwave oven (Galanz WP 800SL23-3). After microwave irradiation at the maximum power output of 800 W for 25 s, the solution changed from pale orange to dark brown in color and an ethylene glycol solution of Pt colloids was obtained. The fresh Pt colloids were added to each of a five-fold volume of water, PVP, PAM, PEG, P123, PSS, PAA and PEI aqueous solutions. The resultant catalysts were denoted as Pt, PVP–Pt, PAM–Pt, PEG–Pt, P123–Pt, PSS–Pt, PAA–Pt and PEI–Pt, respectively.
The size-controlled PVP–Ptn nanoparticles (NPs), where n is the calculated average number of Pt atoms, were prepared by a procedure similar to that used for the Pt colloids. However, 0.139 g of PVP (K-30) was added into the mixed solution prior to the reaction and different concentrations of NaOH were used to control the size of the Pt NPs (12 mM for PVP–Pt60 1.2 nm size; 10 mM for PVP–Pt75 of 1.3 nm size; 8 mM for PVP–Pt95 of 1.4 nm size; 7.2 mM for PVP–Pt115 of 1.5 nm size; and 4 mM for PVP–Pt276 of 2.0 nm size).
2.3 Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL Model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The histograms of the particle size distribution were obtained on the basis of statistical measurements in an arbitrarily chosen area. The zeta potentials (ξ) of the polymer–Pt colloids were determined by dynamic light-scattering analysis (Zeta Sizer 3000HSA) at 30 °C. The pH was adjusted using an aqueous solution of HCl or NaOH when the zeta potential of the sample was measured as a function of pH.
2.4 Photophysical measurements
UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 500 instrument. Photoluminescence emission spectra and photoluminescence lifetimes were measured at room temperature on a FL/FS920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments). The triplet transient difference absorption spectra and lifetimes were measured on an Edinburgh LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer. The excitation pump source was a Vibrant LD 355 II Nd:YAG/OPO system. The excitation wavelength was 450 nm for all the samples unless stated otherwise. For each measurement, optically dilute (OD = 0.3–0.5) solutions were degassed by purging with a stream of N2 gas for about 10 min; the head space of the solutions was maintained under a positive N2 pressure during data acquisition.
2.5 Photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen
The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a closed circulation system with a side-window Pyrex cell. A 150 ml volume of aqueous solution containing Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (66.7 μM), NaHA (50 mM), Pt colloids (167 μM) and polymer (667 μM as a monomeric unit) was added into the side-irradiation Pyrex reaction vessel and the pH of the solution was measured with a pH meter (Oakton Double Junction Waterproof pH Tester 30, resolution 0.1 pH units, accuracy ±0.01 pH units, Eutech (Oakton) Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and adjusted to within the pH range 2.0–10.0 using NaOH (aq.) or HCl (aq.) without a buffer. The reaction system was evacuated several times using a mechanical pump to remove any air and nitrogen. The catalyst was dispersed uniformly in the aqueous solution with magnetic stirring and irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter at 283 K. The evolved hydrogen gas was circulated with a gas pump and quantified by an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Ar carrier).
The apparent quantum yield for hydrogen production was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction. The amount of H2 formed during 1 h of photocatalytic reaction with irradiation at wavelengths of 420, 450, 475, 500, 525 and 550 nm was used to calculate the QE using the equation:  
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Screening of modifiers for Pt NPs
A series of water-soluble non-ionic polymers, including PVP, PAM, PEG and P123 and ionic polymers such as PSS, PAA and PEI were used as modifiers for Pt NPs to examine their role in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. Scheme 2 shows the chemical structures of all the polymers used in this work. The PVP–Pt colloidal solution was a pale yellow–brown color, whereas all the other polymer–Pt colloids and the pure Pt colloids were a deeper brown color (Fig. S1, ESI†). It can be seen from Fig. 1A that the bare Pt NPs in the Pt colloids were dispersed with an average size of 2.4 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 1B); aggregation could also be observed. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the bare Pt NPs. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ of 39.7°, 46.2° and 67.5° are attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of the face-centered cubic Pt phase (JCPDF 65-2868). The broadening of the diffraction peaks indicates that the sizes of the Pt particles are in the nanometer range, consistent with the results obtained from the TEM image. The inset in Fig. 1A shows a d spacing of 0.228 nm, indexed well as the (111) plane of metallic Pt NPs.

 Fig. 1  HRTEM images and particle size distribution histograms of Pt, PEG–Pt, P123–Pt, PAM–Pt, PVP–Pt, PSS–Pt, PAA–Pt and PEI–Pt colloids. 
The morphology and average size of the Pt colloids showed almost no change with the addition of PEG (Fig. 1C and D), whereas the addition of P123 decreased the average size of the Pt colloids to 2.0 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 1F), along with agglomeration (Fig. 1E). These results imply that PEG and P123 are not good stabilizers for Pt NPs because the interaction between the hydroxyl groups of non-ionic PEG or P123 and the Pt NPs (Scheme 2) is too weak to completely inhibit agglomeration of the particles. When PAM or PVP were used as stabilizers, the particle size of Pt became very small, about 1.5 nm (Fig. 1H and J). This is mainly because the acyl amino groups in PAM or PVP adhere easily to the surface atoms of Pt NPs. As a result, the surface free energy of the Pt NPs can be reduced and their growth and aggregation inhibited.40 The PVP–Pt colloids show highly monodispersed Pt NPs without aggregation (Fig. 1I), whereas the PAM–Pt colloids give ill-dispersed Pt NPs with a small amount of aggregation (Fig. 1G). The addition of ionic polymers leads to a clear agglomeration of the Pt NPs with an average particle size of about 2.0 nm. Fig. 1K–P represent the TEM images and particle size distributions of Pt colloids modified by ionic polymers including PSS, PAA and PEI. There is hardly any difference in the morphology, size or dispersion of the Pt NPs modified by these ionic polymers. This implies that PSS, PAA and PEI are not good stabilizers for Pt NPs. These results indicate that PVP is the best soluble polymer stabilizer for Pt NPs.
These modified Pt NPs acting as hydrogen-evolving catalysts were used to assemble the artificial photosystem for solar-to-hydrogen fuel production with the Ru(bpy)32+ PS. No electron mediator was added apart from the sacrificial reagent NaHA. The optimum pH of the system at which the highest H2 production rate was achieved was 4.0 (see Fig. 5). Fig. 2 shows the time course of hydrogen production at pH 4 under visible light irradiation. No hydrogen evolution was discernible in the system with bare Pt NPs as a catalyst, implying that there was no electron transfer between the PS and the hydrogen-evolving catalyst. It also can be seen that the PVP–Pt, PSS–Pt and PAA–Pt systems were highly photoactive for H2 evolution, with vigorous bubbles of H2 generated as soon as light irradiation started. The evolution of hydrogen in the other systems, including PEG–Pt, PAM–Pt, P123–Pt and PEI–Pt, was very weak, even negligible. Control experiments indicated that Ru(bpy)3Cl2, NaHA, Pt and PVP (or PSS or PAA) were all essential for H2 generation. The absence of any of these components gave rise to an absence of hydrogen evolution (Fig. S3, ESI†). As a result of the poor stabilization of the Pt NPs with PEG, P123 and PEI, not only were the Pt NPs aggregated, but the negatively charged Pt NPs (−27.1 eV) and the cationic PS Ru(bpy)32+ led to complex aggregations, which could be seen with the naked eye, accounting for their activity.41 Both PAM and PVP were good stabilizers for the Pt NPs, but PAM–Pt show little catalytic activity for hydrogen production, whereas PVP–Pt showed high activity. This implies that the polymer (PAM) stabilizes Pt NPs, but cannot assist in the electron transfer between the PS and the catalyst. The OC–N group link with the linear alkyl groups in PAM is neutral. However, PVP shows weak negatively charged properties as a result of the inner OC–N bond of the pyrrolidinone, which is inclined to the –N+C–O− bond with the N atom located inside and the O atom located outside.42 It can thus combine with the positively charged Ru(bpy)32+ to form a spatially separated donor–acceptor complex by weak electrostatic forces. The partial positive charge on the N atom behaved as an electron acceptor and the negative charge on the O atom behaved as an electron donor.43 Thus PVP has an important role as a bridge in the electron transfer process of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The same is true for the PSS–Pt and PAA–Pt systems. It is also reasonable to believe that the Pt NPs modified with polyanions and PVP can assemble with positively charged Ru(bpy)32+ by electrostatic interactions to form a complex hybrid. Although PSS and PAA cannot stabilize the Pt NPs, they can assist in the transfer of electrons from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Pt NPs.

3.2 Size effect of PVP–Ptn NPs
PVP was chosen as the best modifier of the Pt NPs to study the size effect of the Pt NPs. PVP–Ptn (where n is the number of Pt atoms) colloids with different sizes of Pt NPs were prepared by controlling the NaOH concentration to optimize the photosystem. Table S1 (ESI†) shows that the average diameter of the Pt NPs decreases with increasing NaOH concentration. All the PVP–Ptn colloidal solutions were transparent, homogeneous and had a pale brown color (Fig. 3A) and high stability. Fig. 3B–K show the HRTEM images and corresponding size distribution histograms. All the particles were approximately spherical and monodispersed without aggregation. The size distribution of these particles was narrow, with an average diameter of 1.2 nm for PVP–Pt60 (Fig. 3B), 1.3 nm for PVP–Pt75 (Fig. 3D), 1.4 nm for PVP–Pt95 (Fig. 3F), 1.5 nm for PVP–Pt115 (Fig. 3H) and 2.0 nm for PVP–Pt276 (Fig. 3J).

The effect of the size of the PVP–Ptn colloids on the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen was evaluated under the same experimental conditions with Ru(bpy)32+ as a PS and NaHA as a sacrificial reagent at pH 4.0. Fig. 4A shows the time course of hydrogen evolution and Fig. 4B shows the initial H2 production rates versus cluster size. With increasing size of the PVP–Pt colloids, the H2 production rate first increased and reached a maximum at n = 95, followed by a sharp decrease. The highest H2 production rate of 2.5 mmol h−1 was achieved in the Ru(bpy)32+–PVP–Pt photosystem and the optimum size of the Pt NPs as H2-evolving catalysts was 1.4 nm (PVP–Pt95 colloids). The results can be explained from two aspects: (1) the smaller the size of the PVP–Ptn catalysts, until the occurrence of quantum size effects,44 the more surface Pt atoms are exposed; and (2) larger sized particles can receive more electrons.45 The PVP–Pt95 with the highest rate of hydrogen evolution was selected as the H2-evolving catalyst (PVP–Pt) in subsequent experiments.

(B) Plots of initial hydrogen evolution rates with size-selected Pt clusters as a function of cluster size. The hydrogen evolution rates were determined from the initial slopes of the time course of hydrogen evolution in the first 30 min. 
3.3 Optimization of the H2-evolving photosystems
The influence of pH is significant in the H2-evolving photosystem as a result of several factors, including the redox potential of the protons, the electrostatic properties of the polymer–Pt colloids and the chemical equilibrium of H2A ↔ H+ + HA−.46,47 The evolution of hydrogen as a function of pH is shown in Fig. 5. A large amount of H2 was produced at pH 3.0–5.0. The maximum yield of H2 was obtained at pH 4.0, which is the pKa1 value of the reaction of H2A ↔ H+ + HA−, whereas the production of H2 was small, or even negligible, below pH 3.0 and above pH 6.0 (Fig. 5B). This is predominantly a contribution from the repulsive interaction between the positively charged Ru(bpy)32+ and the positively charged polymer–Pt colloids below pH 3.0 (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the equilibrium of H2A ↔ H+ + HA− shifts towards the left and reduces the concentration of the electron donor HA− at pH < 4.0, resulting in a significant decrease in the rate of H2 evolution. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows that the zeta potentials of the polymer–Pt colloids decreased from positive to negative with increasing pH from 2 to 10. As the pH increased, the decrease in proton concentration kinetically reduced the photoactivity. Therefore the pKa1 value of the reaction was selected to be the pH of the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt artificial photosystem.

The hydrogen evolution rates were determined from the initial slopes of the time courses of hydrogen evolution in the first 30 min. 
The effect of the relative concentrations of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, Pt and NaHA on H2 production was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the H2 evolution as a function of reactant concentrations. On increasing the concentration of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (Fig. 6A), the rate of production of H2 increased rapidly and reached a maximum at [Ru(bpy)3Cl2] = 66.7 μM. This originates from the optical properties of the PS, which exhibits the maximum intensity of fluorescence emission at [Ru(bpy)3Cl2] = 66.7 μM (Fig. S5, ESI†). The high PS concentration results in self-quenching of the excited state, accounting for the photocatalytic activity. The initial H2 evolution rate follows a Langmuir-type reaction model, which is generally applied to kinetics analysis for heterogeneous gas–solid and liquid–solid systems,48 as a function of the concentration of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, where the rate constant of H2 evolution and the adsorption constant of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 are 3.13 mmol h−1 and 65.98 L mmol−1, respectively (Fig. 6B). Pt (Fig. 6D) and NaHA (Fig. 6F) also show a Langmuir-type reaction model with a rate constant for H2 evolution of k = 2.86 mmol h−1 for Pt, 3.66 mmol h−1 for NaHA and an adsorption constant of K = 49.25 L mmol−1 for Pt and 0.072 L mmol−1 for NaHA. When the concentrations of Pt and NaHA were, respectively, higher than [Pt] = 0.171 mM (Fig. 6C) and [NaHA] = 50 mM (Fig. 6E), no more hydrogen was evolved for the first two hours of illumination. Based on the adsorption constant obtained, it can be concluded that the reaction is kinetically controlled by the adsorption of Pt, suggesting a critical role for electron transfer between the PS and the Pt catalyst in the evolution of hydrogen. Note that the substitution of NaHA by other electron donors, such as sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic and triethanolamine, often used in photoreactions at their optimum pH, resulted in only trace amounts of H2 being produced (Fig. S6, ESI†). This indicates that NaHA is the most effective electron donor for our artificial photosystem.

Initial rate of hydrogen generation (r) versus initial concentration (c) of (B) Ru(bpy)3Cl2, (D) Pt, (F) NaHA. The insets show the fitted plots of 1/r versus 1/c. The rates of hydrogen evolution were determined from the initial slopes of the time courses of hydrogen evolution in the first 30 min. 
The polymer does not follow the same kinetic model of H2 evolution as Pt and the PS. Fig. 7 shows that an optimum hydrogen evolution rate of about 2.50 mmol h−1 is achieved at [PVP] = 0.667 mM (Fig. 7A and B). The optimum molar ratio of PS/PVP/surface Pt atoms is calculated as 1:10:1.7 (Table S2, ESI†). The addition of more PVP leads to a slight decrease in the rate of hydrogen evolution. The artificial photosystems of Ru(bpy)32+–PSS–Pt and Ru(bpy)32+–PAA–Pt show the same reaction models as PVP. An optimum addition is achieved with 0.167 mM for PSS and 1.33 mM for PAA (Fig. 7C–F), where the optimum molar ratio of PS/polymers/surface Pt atoms was calculated to be about 1:2.5:1.3 and 1:20:1.3, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). A sharp decrease in the evolution rate of hydrogen occurred above the concentrations of PSS and PAA. Obviously, larger amounts of PVP, PSS and PAA all have a deleterious effect on the production of hydrogen. This is because the surplus polymer can adsorb and wrap around the Ru(bpy)32+, resulting in decreased contact between the negatively charged NaHA and Ru(bpy)32+. As a consequence, intermolecular electron transfer is hindered. The decreasing trend followed the order PSS > PAA > PVP, consistent with their negatively charged properties (Fig. S4, ESI†). We can see that these polymers do not follow a Langmuir-type reaction model. This implies that the polymers have an important role in the PS–polymer–Pt artificial photosystems.

Under the conditions of pH 4, [Ru(bpy)3Cl2] = 66.7 μM, [Pt] = 0.171 mM, [PVP] = 0.667 mM and [NaHA] = 50 mM, the optimum apparent QE of hydrogen production can be obtained under irradiation with different wavelengths of light. Fig. 8 shows the QEs at different wavelengths. The production of H2 matches with the UV-visible absorption spectrum of Ru(bpy)3Cl2–PVP–Pt in aqueous solution. A large QE of 12.8% was obtained at 450 nm, corresponding to the maximum absorption of Ru(bpy)3Cl2–PVP–Pt in the visible light region. At 475 nm, the QE is still as high as 12.3%. The QE decreases considerably above 475 nm as a result of a decrease in the absorption of Ru(bpy)3Cl2–PVP–Pt.

3.4 Understanding the intermolecular interactions of the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt system
Without an additional electron relay, hydrogen gas can be produced in the Ru(bpy)32+–polyanion–Pt system using NaHA as an electron donor under visible light irradiation. Kinetic analysis indicates that the evolution of H2 proceeds in a heterogeneous manner in the self-assembled photosystem, where Ru(bpy)3Cl2, polymers and Pt NPs bond to form a spatially separated donor–acceptor complex Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt. The effect of PVP on the absorption of Ru(bpy)32+ is indiscernible as a result of the weak electrostatic interactions (Fig. S7A, ESI†). Adding PVP–Pt colloids into the Ru(bpy)3Cl2 solution does not change the absorption. UV-Vis spectrum of Ru(bpy)32+-PVP–Pt shows only a simple plus of PVP–Pt and Ru(bpy)32+. However, after adding PSS and PAA, a slight red shift was discernible for the absorption feature at 453 nm resulting from the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band of Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. S7D and G, ESI†).49 The degree of red shift was constant with increasing concentrations of the polyanions, indicating no dependence of the concentration on the shift in MLCT bands of Ru(bpy)3Cl2. This result indicates that hybrids are formed under these conditions. These results further indicate that the polyanions (PSS and PAA) are strongly bound to Ru(bpy)32+ to form the self-assembled Ru(bpy)32+–polymer hybrids via electrostatic interactions.50
To gain further insights into the non-covalent interactions at the molecular level, fluorescence spectrometry was used to study the artificial photosystem. Fig. 9 shows the relative intensity and lifetime of the 610 nm emission as a function of the polymer or quencher concentration. Ru(bpy)32+ shows a significantly synchronous increase in the intensity and lifetime of the 610 nm emission with increasing concentrations of PVP (Fig. 9A; Fig. S8A and B, ESI†). This implies that PVP does affect the triplet excited state of *Ru(bpy)32+ as a result of the non-covalent interactions. The polymer PVP not only enables *Ru(bpy)32+ to be more stable, but also enhances the intensity of fluorescence emission, reducing the energy loss. Also, the addition of PSS and PAA induces a slight red shift in the emission maxima of *Ru(bpy)32+, consistent with the red shift in the lowest energy MLCT absorption of Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. S8E and I, ESI†). Moreover, they significantly increase the 610 nm emission of *Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. S8E and I, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 9C and E and Fig. S8E and I (ESI†), the intensity and lifetime increase with the concentrations of PSS and PAA, indicating the strong stabilization of the excited state *Ru(bpy)32+ in order to attain a relatively long-lived charge separation. This is mainly because the self-assembled Ru(bpy)32+–polymer hybrids decrease the rate of deactivation via intermolecular non-radiative paths.51 The increasing trend of fluorescence intensity and lifetime follows the order PSS > PAA > PVP, consistent with the electrostatic attraction between the polymer and Ru(bpy)32+. The stronger the attraction, the easier the formation of the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer hybrid. When the concentration of PSS reached 1.0 mmol L−1, the addition of more PSS does not lead to a change in the fluorescence intensity or lifetime of the *Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. 9C). We believe that the change in the trend of relative fluorescence intensity and lifetime for *Ru(bpy)32+ with increasing concentrations of PVP or PAA will be similar to that for PSS. The maximum amount of PVP and PAA needed to form *Ru(bpy)32+ with the longest lifetime will be >8 and >2.0 mmol L−1, respectively. Therefore adding the appropriate amount of polymer can increase the intensity and lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+. However, excessive amounts of polymer are unhelpful in increasing the fluorescence intensity and lifetime; excessive amounts of polymer reduce the probability of collision between the NaHA and Ru(bpy)32+, resulting in a decrease in electron transfer. This is consistent with the photo-catalytic activity results.
 Fig. 9  (A, C, E) Change in the relative fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (2.5 × 10−5 M) solution with increasing concentrations of polymer at pH 4.0. (B, D, F) Stern–Volmer plots of the fluorescence quenching and lifetime quenching of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (2.5 × 10−5 M) by Pt colloids in the presence of anionic polymers (8.0 × 10−4 M) at pH 4.0. 
However, adding bare Pt colloids to the Ru(bpy)3Cl2/PVP solution significantly quenched the emission at 610 nm (Fig. 9B and Fig. S8C, ESI†). The fluorescence intensity decreased linearly with increasing Pt concentration, but the fluorescence lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+ in the system showed no change (Fig. 9B and Fig. S8D, ESI†). On the basis of the Förster dipole–dipole non-radiative energy transfer theory, a resonance energy transfer (RET) can occur when the emission spectrum of a fluorophore (the donor) overlaps with the absorption spectrum of another molecule (Fig. S7, ESI†) (the acceptor) and the distance between them is about 10–100 Å.52 An intermolecular RET occurs from *Ru(bpy)32+–PVP to the Pt NPs. The linear fits of the intensity quenching (Fig. 9B) yield a Stern–Volmer (SV) constant, KSV, of 4332 M−1 and the relationship KSV = κENTτD, (where τD = 545.0 ns is the emission lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+–PVP in the absence of Pt) yields an energy transfer rate constant, κENT, of 8.0 × 109 M−1 s−1. The addition of Pt colloids into the PS–PSS and PS–PAA solutions drastically reduces the 610 nm emission, whereas the lifetime shows no change (Fig. 9D and F). This result clearly indicates the occurrence of a RET between *Ru(bpy)32+–polymer and Pt NPs. The energy transfer rate constant, κENT, is 9.0 × 109 M−1 s−1 for PSS and 24.8 × 109 M−1 s−1 for PAA. These quenching processes follow a static mechanism. This indicates that the Pt colloids are adsorbed strongly into the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer complexes. Furthermore, according to Förster theory, the rate of RET depends strongly on the donor-to-acceptor distance (r) and is proportional to r−6.53 The Ru(bpy)32+ to Pt distances in the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt self-assembled complex follows the order PAA ≪ PSS < PVP, corresponding to the rate of hydrogen evolution.
Therefore Ru(bpy)32+ and polymer/PVP can be self-assembled by strong electrostatic interactions to form a complex hybrid. The Pt colloids are adsorbed strongly into the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer by non-covalent intermolecular interactions to form the spatially separated donor–acceptor complex Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt. The polymers play several important roles in these processes: (1) the polymers can stabilize the excited state *Ru(bpy)32+ with long-lived charge separation; and (2) the polymers act as bridges to closely connect Ru(bpy)32+ with Pt, accelerating the energy transfer from the PS to the catalyst.
3.5 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production of NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt systems
To explore the details of the photocatalytic mechanism, we carried out steady-state photolysis experiments. A 50 ns laser excitation of Ru(bpy)32+ in aqueous solution gives rise to a negative absorption band from 400 to 500 nm, corresponding to the depopulation of the MLCT ground state absorption band of PS, and a positive absorption feature at about 370 nm (a characteristic of PS*) with a decay lifetime of about 600 ns (Fig. S9, ESI†). It has enough time to quench PS* with HA−. This reductive quenching is permissible thermodynamically because the first reduction potential of the triplet excited state PS* is estimated to be +0.84 V vs. SCE (RuII*/RuI),54 larger than the potential (+0.28 V vs. SCE) of the HA˙/HA− couple.55 The reductive quenching processes were studied by time-resolved fluorescence spectrometry (Fig. 10 and Fig. S10, ESI†). The linear fits of the intensity quenching (Fig. 10A) yield an SV constant, KSV, of 39.5 M−1 for the free Ru(bpy)32+ system without any polymers and the relationship KSV = κqτ0, (where τ0 = 554.0 ns is the emission lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+) yields a quenching rate constant, κq, of 7.13 × 107 M−1 s−1. The lifetime quenching (LQ) by NaHA is calculated to be KSV = 36.8 M−1 and κq = 6.7 × 107 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 10B), similar to the intensity quenching rate constant, indicating the quenching of *Ru(bpy)32+ by NaHA via a dynamic mechanism of electron transfer from NaHA to *Ru(bpy)32+. The addition of the polymers decreases both the SV and LQ constants (Fig. 10), which is further indicative of the stabilization of the polymers to *Ru(bpy)32+ following the decreasing order PVP (35.7 and 24.4 M−1 for SV and LQ constants, respectively; τ0 = 556.0 ns is the emission lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+–PVP) > PAA (25.7 and 18.0 M−1 for SV and LQ constants, respectively; τ0 = 569.0 ns is the emission lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+–PAA) > PSS (7.60 and 2.6 M−1 for SV and LQ constants, respectively; τ0 = 684.0 ns is the emission lifetime of *Ru(bpy)32+–PSS at pH 4.0).

The product of quenching of *Ru(bpy)32+ by NaHA was studied by the transient absorption spectra of the systems composed of NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. 11A and B) and NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–PVP–Pt (Fig. 11C). After the 50 ns laser excitation of a deaerated aqueous solution containing Ru(bpy)32+ (2.5 × 10−5 M) and NaHA (0.05 M) at pH 4.0, two transient absorption bands appeared at 310–400 and 470–550 nm (Fig. 11A). The new band with a maximum at 510 nm is characteristic of [Ru(bpy)3]+.56 It grew concomitantly with the decrease in the PS* absorption band at 370 nm, confirming electron transfer from HA− to PS*. The generation of [Ru(bpy)3]+ obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics with a lifetime of 264 ns and a rate constant of 3.1 × 107 M−1 s−1 (Fig. S11, ESI†). The decay of the entire transient absorption spectra of the systems composed of NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. 11B) and NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–PVP–Pt (Fig. 11C) occurs in few hundred microseconds, corresponding to the return of PS− to ground state PS with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 1.5 × 104 and 2.3 × 104 s−1. The rate constant of [Ru(bpy)3]+ decay in the NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–PSS–Pt and NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–PAA–Pt systems is 2.0 × 104 and 2.3 × 104 s−1, respectively (Fig. S12A, ESI†). The addition of the polyanion–Pt therefore considerably improves the return of PS− to PS, releasing an electron to the Pt catalyst, where H+ is reduced to hydrogen gas.
 Fig. 11  Transient absorption spectra after laser excitation at 450 nm of a deaerated aqueous solution containing Ru(bpy)32+ (2.5 × 10−5 M), NaHA (0.05 M) at pH 4.0 (path length 1 cm) within the time range (A) 0–500 ns and (B) 700 ns–167 μs. Insets: (A) growth time profile and (B) decay time profile of the absorbance at 510 nm arising from the Ru(bpy)3+ aqueous solution. (C) Transient absorption spectra after laser excitation of a deaerated aqueous solution containing Ru(bpy)32+ (2.5 × 10−5 M), NaHA (0.05 M) PVP (8.0 × 10−4 M) and Pt (2.0 × 10−4 M) at pH 4.0 (path length 1 cm) in the time range 0–160 μs. Inset: (upper panel) growth time profile and (lower panel) decay time profile of the absorbance at 510 nm arising from the Ru(bpy)3+ present in this aqueous solution. 
To clarify the role of the polymers in the electron transfer process, the time profiles of the absorption at 510 nm in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ and polymers were studied. Fig. S12B (ESI†) shows that the addition of polymers results in a faster decay. This implies that electrons can transfer from Ru(bpy)3+ to the polymers. Unfortunately, the laser photolysis experiments could not find any evidence of the polymer radical formed. The polymer–Pt systems may undergo a more complex mechanism than a simple back electron transfer between PS− and HA˙. We believe that some other reactions involve the return of PS− to PS during the addition of polymer–Pt catalysts. However, hydrogen can be efficiently evolved in the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt systems by adding several polymers, including PVP, PSS and PAA, indicating smooth electron transfer between PS− and the hydrogen-evolving catalyst Pt NPs. The evolution of hydrogen is inefficient, even negligible, in the bare Pt system, indicating severe blocking of electron transfer between PS− and the hydrogen-evolving catalyst. Without the addition of polymers to the artificial photosystem, no electron transfer occurs between PS− and the hydrogen-evolving catalyst Pt NPs. A reasonable concept of an electronic bridge is proposed to explain the role of the polymers used in hydrogen evolution. Electrons can be transferred from PS to the catalyst by electron–electron self-exchange between the anionic groups.57,58 Therefore the photocatalytic evolution of H2 by the NaHA–Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt system follows the mechanism shown in Scheme 3. The reaction is summarized as follows: (1) on the photo-excitation of the Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt system in the presence of NaHA, the exited state *Ru(bpy)32+ moiety is formed and it is then quenched by HA− to produce the reduced state Ru(bpy)3+ moiety; (2) electrons may be transferred from the Ru(bpy)3+ moiety to the Pt moiety through the electron–electron exchange of anionic groups of polymers; and (3) protons are reduced to H2 on the surface of the Pt NPs.

4. Conclusions
Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and polymer–Pt complexes were self-assembled in situ to form a spatially separated donor–acceptor complex by non-covalent interactions. The quasi-supermolecular complex showed highly efficient visible light photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen in the presence of NaHA as a sacrificial electron donor, without the addition of a conventional molecular electron mediator. The maximum amount of hydrogen production was achieved when the concentrations of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, PVP (or PSS or PAA), Pt and NaHA were fixed at 66.7 μM, 0.667 mM (or 0.167 or 1.33 mM), 0.171 mM and 50 mM, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, hydrogen evolution takes place with a large apparent QE of 12.8%. Based on the results of nanosecond transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence spectrometry, a mechanism of electron transport via a polymeric wire-bridging PS and Pt was proposed for the artificial Ru(bpy)32+–polymer–Pt photosystems. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the role of polymers in artificial photosystems for hydrogen production.
