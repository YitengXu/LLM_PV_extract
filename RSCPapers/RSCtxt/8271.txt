It was found that the size and morphology of the CdTe NCs were related to synthesis parameters such as the reaction temperature, carboxyl chain length and carboxylic acid. Based on these CdTe NCs, photovoltaic cells (PVC) in simple Schottky diode configuration of ITO/CdTe/Al were fabricated. The performances of the CdTe NCs solar cells were found to strongly rely on the morphology and surface ligand of the CdTe NCs. The best device could show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.15% under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, which is the highest efficiency of a CdTe NC-based Schottky solar cell reported to date. Notably, in comparison to the ITO/CdTe/LiF/Al device, the device configuration of ITO/CdTe/Al showed higher efficiency and better air-stability.
Introduction
Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted much attention during the past decade because of their potential applications in many fields, such as solar cells,1 light-emitting diodes2 and biological labeling.3 It is well known that the size, morphology and crystalline structure of NCs have great effects on their optical and electrical properties. It is very important to develop safe and large-scale synthetic routes for high-quality NCs with well-controlled morphology and structure. Among the most important II–VI colloidal semiconductor nanomaterials, CdTe has a high optical absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), small bulk band gap of ∼1.5 eV and large exciton Bohr radius,4 with promising applications in photoelectronic and biological labeling devices.5 In the case of CdTe thin film solar cells, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5% has been demonstrated with CdTe as an absorber layer and cadmium sulfide (CdS) as a window layer.6 However, the CdTe thin film solar cells modules are fabricated by using vacuum sputtering or close space sublimation techniques (CSS).7 The fabrication processes are time-consuming and costly. With the development of the synthesis of NCs in recent years, some new routes have been reported with great potential to supply low cost and high efficiency solar cells devices. It was found that multiple excitons could be generated by a single photon in lead chalcogenide NCs,8,9 which initiated an intensive interest to build next generation high efficiency solar cells that exhibit internal quantum efficiencies substantially greater than 100%. On the other hand, semiconductor NCs can be used as precursors or inks to fabricate thin films devices via more convenient solution processing. To date, semiconducting NCs such as Cu2S,10 PbS(Se),11,12 CuInS2,13 CuInSe214 and CuInSSe215 are the typical examples. There are relatively few reports on thin film solar cells fabricated with CdTe NCs. Alivisatos and coworkers reported thin film solar cells based on solution-processed p-type CdTe and n-type CdSe NCs, which showed PCEs of ∼3%.16 Chou et al. reported hybrid solar cells with a 3.2% PCE, based on a PSBTBT-NH2 and CdTe tetrapod NCs complex.17 Using ZnO as the window layer and optimizing the sintering process during the layer-by-layer processing, Mulvaney et al. fabricated CdTe–ZnO NC-based solar cells with 6.9% PCE.18 With the simplest Schottky diode configuration, Carter et al. fabricated thin film solar cells with 5.0% PCE from colloidal CdTe NCs.19
Currently, an organometallic procedure, also called the hot injection method, is a powerful route for the synthesis of high quality CdTe NCs with few defects, controlled morphology and high crystallinity. Normally, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and octadecene (ODE) are utilized as the coordinating and non-coordinating solvents, respectively, while tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) dispersed tellurium powder (TOP-Te) is used as the Te source. In the early works,20,21 organic phosphonic acids were widely selected as the binding ligands to stabilize the NCs in the organic solution and induce anisotropy growth to obtain NCs with different morphologies. However, phosphoric acid ligands are expensive and toxic, showing limitations in the large scale preparation of NCs. Recently, fatty acids (oleic acid or myristic acid) as weak binding ligands were used to afford CdTe NCs with tretrapod-shapes at a moderate temperature (∼240 °C), which could supply advantages of low cost and low reaction temperature.22,23
In a previous report, we demonstrated a surfactant-free method for the synthesis of CdSe NCs with well-controlled morphologies, in which cadmium carboxylates were selected as the cadmium precursors, instead of CdO.24 In this paper, we further applied the method for the fabrication of high quality CdTe NCs with well-controlled morphologies. It was found that the morphologies of the CdTe NCs were mainly determined by the reaction temperature and the chemical structure of the cadmium carboxylate. The simple preparation condition could realize the anisotropic growth of tetrapod or multi-armed CdTe NCs, with high selectivity and very good dispersion in pyridine or 1-propanol solvent. Most importantly, the CdTe NC-based thin film solar cells, in a simple Schottky diode configuration of ITO/CdTe/Al, could exhibit a PCE of 5.15% under AM 1.5G illumination. This is the highest efficiency of a Schottky diode solar cell based on CdTe NCs. In the meantime, the influences of the preparation conditions of the CdTe NCs on the photovoltaic performances were also investigated.
Experimental
Materials
Cadmium carboxylate precursors were synthesized according to our previous report.25 TOPO (technical grade, 90%), TOP and tellurium powder were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Other chemicals were obtained from Guangzhou Chemistry Factory, China. All chemicals and solvents were used without further purification.
Synthesis of CdTe NCs and device fabrication
All the reactions were carried out with a fixed Cd/Te molar ratio of 2:1 and TOPO of 2.32 g, while the concentration of TOP-Te was kept unchanged at 0.8 mmol mL−1. A typical synthetic procedure was given as the following. In a three-necked flask, 1.6 mmol of cadmium myristate (CM) or cadmium stearate (CS) and 2.32 g of TOPO were loaded. In some controlled experiments, myristate acid (MA) was also added to a three-necked flask before the TOP-Te injection. The mixtures were then heated to about 100 °C and pumped down for 1 h to remove any impurities. After which, the flask was introduced into the N2 flow. During the heating, cadmium carboxylates were dissolved gradually and generated a colorless homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to a temperature between 220 and 300 °C for 10 min and a solution of 1 mL TOP-Te was quickly injected into the reaction flask and kept at the same temperature for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The product was washed three times with methanol/toluene and separated by centrifugation to remove excess precursors, organic solvent and other impurities. The yields of the as-prepared CdTe NCs were around 90%. The CdTe NC samples for the fabrication of the solar cells were refluxed in pyridine overnight at 110 °C and centrifuged in hexane. Subsequently, the NCs were dispersed into a mixture of pyridine and 1-propanol with a volume ratio of 1:1 at about 50 mg mL−1 concentration. The Schottky diode solar cells based on the CdTe NCs were fabricated by a layer-by-layer solution process, similar to those reported previously.18 Firstly, one layer of the CdTe NCs was prepared by spin-coating the CdTe NCs solution onto the ITO-coated glass slides at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then the substrate was placed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 3 min. After dipping in a saturated CdCl2 methanol solution, the device sample was rinsed with 1-PrOH and dried under a nitrogen stream. The device sample was then sintered on a hot plate at an optimal temperature of 350 °C for 40 s (the optimal annealing time). This process was repeated 5 times with a final CdTe thickness of about 450 nm. The aluminum contact with 100 nm thickness was deposited via thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The active area of the Schottky diode solar cells was 0.16 cm2. The photovoltaic performances of the solar cells were measured according to a previous report.25
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the room-temperature UV absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CdTe NCs with different growth times prepared by using CM as the precursor at 240 °C. The as-prepared CdTe NCs solutions were taken from the refluxing reaction mixture at different time intervals and diluted by toluene. It was found that all samples showed a well-resolved absorption maximum of the first electronic transition, and the maximum absorbance peak shifted from 621 to 691 nm wavelengths and the PL peaks shifted from 651 to 720 nm accordingly with increasing reaction time, which implied that the size of the NCs became bigger with an increase of the reaction time. It should be noted that there was almost no change in the shape of the UV and PL curves after 1 min reaction. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL was about 30–40 nm for all the NCs with different growth times, suggesting that a narrow size distribution was obtained in the final NCs products. In other words, one can control the size of NCs more easily by controlling the reaction time during the synthesis.

The morphology and size distribution of the as-prepared CdTe NCs were characterized by a Hitachi model H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the CdTe NCs with different preparation conditions (named as sample A, sample B, sample C, sample D, sample E and sample F). It was found that reaction temperature greatly influenced the morphology of the CdTe NCs (Fig. 2a–c). When using CM as the precursor, a higher reaction temperature resulted in shorter arms and a bigger diameter. At a reaction temperature of 220 °C, sample A (Fig. 2a) showed a multi-armed morphology with an average diameter of about 4.1 nm and 29.1 nm in arm length, corresponding to an aspect ratio of 7.1 (length to diameter). Increasing the temperature to 240 °C afforded sample B of homogeneous rod-shaped and tetrapods-shaped NCs with an average diameter of about 5.87 nm and 21.6 nm in length, showing a smaller aspect ratio of about 3.68 (Fig. 2b). Further increasing the reaction temperature to 300 °C gave sample C (Fig. 2c) with an increased diameter (9 nm) and decreased arm length (16.74 nm). A higher reaction temperature accelerated the nucleation and growth rate of the CdTe NCs, affording NCs with larger size and shorter arms. Besides the reaction temperature, the type of cadmium carboxylate precursor also had effects on the NCs morphology. At a moderate injection temperature of 240 °C, using cadmium stearate (CS) as the precursor (sample D) we achieved tetrapod CdTe NCs with fairly uniform shape (Fig. 2d). The size distribution was less than 10% and tetrapod selectivity was higher than 60%. The arm length and diameter were about 26 and 5.16 nm, respectively, corresponding to an aspect ratio of about 5. As shown in Fig. 2a–d, our surfactant-free method is very useful to realize different morphologies of CdTe NCs. We also tried ODE as the solvent, instead of TOPO, in the synthesis of CdTe NCs. However, CdTe NCs with a spherical morphology were obtained at different temperatures. Similar results were obtained by Yang et al.26 Unlike TOPO, ODE is a homogeneous solvent and could not facilitate the anisotropy growth without a strong ligand (e.g., trioctyl phosphoric acid).21

In comparison to alkylphosphonic acids, fatty acids are relatively weak ligands with intermediate chain lengths, which usually makes both the nucleation and growth rate of the NCs slow down.5 In our case, the addition of a fatty acid as the surfactant made the nucleation and growth rate faster, which had been confirmed in our previous works on the preparation of CdSe tetrapods.24 To investigate the effects of the myristate acid (MA) on the morphology of CdTe NCs, we added a different content of MA into the reaction mixture during the preparation of the CdTe NCs. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, it can be seen that MA ligands will result in NCs with small diameters and short arms, which is consistent with those results obtained by Muhammed et al.5 who prepared CdTe tetrapods using oleic acid ligands. The size and morphology of the NCs were homogeneous at low MA content (sample E, Fig. 2e), while a large size distribution of NCs could be obtained in the case of a higher MA content (sample F, Fig. 2f).
It should be noted that all of the CdTe NCs could be stable within one week, and no dispersion problem were found. The synthetic method for the synthesis of the CdTe NCs also showed good reproducibility.
The typical crystal structures of the CdTe NCs were further analyzed by powder XRD and HRTEM. The XRD pattern (Fig. 3a) of the CdTe NCs (corresponding to samples B, C, D and E, respectively) showed similar diffraction peaks which can be indexed as (100), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (200) facets of wurtzite CdTe (CAS no.: 1306-25-8). The single crystallinity and structural integrity of the CdTe NCs were demonstrated by a JEOL JEM-2010F high resolution TEM operating at 200 kV (sample B). Well resolved lattice planes demonstrated that the CdTe tetrapod was highly crystalline, the lattice plane distance was 0.37 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of wurtzite CdTe. The black circle at the middle part of the NCs implied that the fourth arm was perpendicular to the TEM image plane, indicating that the NCs were tetrapod-shaped.

The as-prepared CdTe NCs were dissolved in pyridine–1-PrOH (volume ratio 1:1) with a concentration of 50 mg mL−1 and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The device architecture of the CdTe NCs Schottky diode solar cells was ITO/CdTe NCs/Al with an active layer thickness of about 450 nm by spin-coating five layers of CdTe NCs on the ITO surface, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The active layer was prepared by a layer-by-layer sintering process.18 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the NCs solar cells were fabricated by using CdTe NCs with different morphologies taken under AM 1.5G illumination at 66.4 mW m−2 are shown in Fig. 4, and Table 1 summarizes the performance characteristics of the PVCs fabricated with different CdTe NCs samples. We found that the NCs fabricated by using sample D were difficult to filtrate through the 0.45 μm PTFE filter, which may be due to the aggregation or larger size NCs, so no device was prepared in this case. On the other hand, samples A, B, C, E and F could be easily filtered but there was still some differences. Compared to samples A, B and C, the samples E and F were more stable in the pyridine–1-PrOH hybrid solution and no precipitate was found in the NCs container even after several weeks, which may be due to the fact that a small amount of MA capped on the NCs surface was kept even after pyridine refluxing. We found that the morphology of the CdTe NCs had a great effect on the performance of the ITO/CdTe/Al device. In the case of sample A, the NCs had a small diameter (about 4.1 nm) but a large aspect ratio of 7.1, only 0.08 V in Voc was obtained, along with a lower Jsc and filled factor (FF), corresponding to a very low PCE of 0.21%. On the other hand, when the NCs with a large diameter and low aspect ratio were used (sample C), the PCE was about 0.97%, which was increased by four times of that of sample A. It is worth pointing out that the NCs with a suitable diameter (about 5 nm) and an aspect ratio (about 3) appeared to significantly improve the growth of the CdTe NCs into a close packed larger crystalline structure and with a smooth surface during the CdCl2 annealing process, which will decrease the combined ratio of hole and electron, accounting for the significant increase of both Jsc and FF. Thus the Jsc, Voc and FF of sample B were 10.4 mA cm−2, 0.44 V and 41.9% respectively, corresponding to a PCE of 2.88%, a value much higher than those of samples A and C. Moreover, devices made from NCs with MA capping (samples E and F) showed significantly improved performances compared to those made of no MA capping NCs (the PCE for the two samples were 4.8% and 4.76% respectively). Thus the presence of the MA resulted in good dispersions of the NCs in the pyridine–1-PrOH mixed solution, which may provide the smooth surface during the NCs spin-coating and intimate good contact between the NCs active layer and the Al cathode.

An ideal active layer for the NCs solar cells must have a large crystalline size and good interfacial contact to decrease the carrier recombinations in the CdTe active layer and collect the charges to the electrodes efficiently. To visualize the interfaces related to the active layer, we probe the surface morphologies of the different CdTe NCs thin films by atomic force microscope (AFM). As described in the experimental section, each of the as-prepared layers of CdTe NCs was treated with CdCl2 and annealed at 350 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, the surface morphology of all the samples could be uniform, but there were some differences in the details. Many small particles were found in the cases of the devices fabricated from samples A, B and C, while large aggregation was found for samples A and C. On the other hand, the surfaces of the devices made from samples E and F were uniform and tightly packed, and their crystallite sizes were obviously larger. We further investigated the surface morphology of sample E by using scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 5f). It was found that the size of the CdTe crystallite was up to 100 nm, much larger than that of the NCs product (sample E: 4.9 nm in diameter and 12.7 nm in length). Furthermore, no large-scale defects that could lead to device leakage could be found in both AFM and SEM. It was clear that annealing could increase the crystallite sizes in the NCs thin films and allow the excitons to dissociate into free charges more easily.18 On the other hand, large particle size would reduce the number of grain boundaries and decrease the charge recombination in the interface of CdTe and Al, which will improve the PCE of the NCs solar cells. Thus, a high PCE was obtained in the case of using the MA capped NCs samples because of the smooth surface and large nanocrystalline size obtained in such a case.

It was mentioned above that the surface roundness and crystallite size in the CdTe NCs thin film was critical to the device performance. For an optimal device fabrication, we adopted a layer-by-layer sintering process using a relatively low concentration of CdTe NCs (30 mg mL−1) to fabricate the CdTe active layer with about 500 nm thickness consisting of 7 layers of NCs (sample E was selected for the device fabrication), while other conditions were kept unchanged (350 °C annealing). The intention of using a low concentration of NCs solution to fabricate the solar cells devices was to obtain defect free and a smoother surface so as to eliminate the recombinations at the interfaces. Fig. 6a shows the SEM image of the CdTe NCs thin films with 7 layers treated with CdCl2 and annealing at 350 °C. The surface was uniform, smooth and tightly packed, and no obvious defects such as pinholes could be found in a large area. The average grain size of the crystallite was up to 160 nm, much larger than those previously reported.18,27Fig. 6b shows the J–V characteristics of such CdTe NCs devices. Simultaneous enhancement in the Voc and FF was demonstrated in this optimal device. The JSC, VOC and FF were 17.56 mA cm−2, 0.52 V and 56.39%, respectively, corresponding to a high PCE of 5.15% under an AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 illumination, ranking the highest efficiency in the case of CdTe NCs Schottky diodes devices. Fig. 7 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell. The maximum EQE value for the solar cell was 63.4% at around 650 nm. The EQE value for the PVC device could be higher than 40% in the wavelength range between 410 and 795 nm. It should be noted that the spectral response could reach 830 nm, corresponding to the aborpsion edge of the CdTe NCs.

It has been found that introducing a thin cathode interlayer LiF before Al electrode deposition can enhance both the stability and performance in organic PVCs.28 Formation of a dipole layer at the film/electrode interface and elimination of chemical reaction between Al and the organic film has been adopted to explain this phenomenon successfully. This concept was also adapted in the case of PbS CQDs solar cells11 and a stable performance was found in the case of the LiF interlayer device compared to those without the LiF interlayer. Herein, we compared the operation and shelf stabilities of the devices fabricated in the present work using devices with and without the LiF interlayer kept under ambient conditions. The initial Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of an ITO-CdTe-Al device were 18.0 mA cm−2, 0.46 V, 49.4% and 4.09% respectively, while these parameters for an ITO-CdTe-LiF (1 nm)-Al device were 18.7 mA cm−2, 0.40 V, 47.6% and 3.55% respectively under AM 1.5G illumination. To our surprise, we obtained quite different results.
As shown in Fig. 8a, the Al contact device did not show an obvious decrease of photovoltaic performance in the Jsc, Voc and FF after a storage time of 7 days under ambient conditions. The calculated loss of PCE was 4%. On the contrary, for the PVC with a LiF interlayer, significant degradations in the Voc, FF and Jsc were observed for only one day (Fig. 8b). After the 7 days storage in air, the Jsc, Voc and FF of the PVC with the LiF/Al cathode contact decreased by 26.4%, 75%, 48.6%, respectively, leading to more than 90% reduction of the PCE. Thus the device using direct Al contact showed higher air-stability. The poor stability of the PVC with a LiF/Al cathode might be related to the possible diffusion of LiF into the CdTe film, which may generate traps near the interface and serve as a carrier-recombination center.

Conclusions
In conclusion, CdTe NCs with well-controlled morphologies have been fabricated successfully by a novel and simple hydrothermal method using cadmium carboxyl as the cadmium precursor. NCs with rod-, multi-armed- and tetrapod-shapes could be obtained by controlling the reaction temperature and chain length of the cadmium carboxylate precursors. The addition of myristic acid in the reaction system resulted in NCs with similar morphology, but with short arm length. The PVCs made from the obtained CdTe NCs with a device structure of ITO-CdTe-Al reached a PCE of 5.15% under AM 1.5G illumination. The device was found to be very stable when stored under ambient conditions, no obvious decrease in Jsc, Voc and FF was found, which resulted in only a 4% reduction of PCE after 7 days storage.
