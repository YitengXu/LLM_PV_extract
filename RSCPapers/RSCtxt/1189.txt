The as-synthesized products were identified as a pure phase by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that single-crystalline quasi square microplates with a fairly uniform morphology were successfully prepared. The average thickness and side length of the microplates were about 160 nm and 750 nm, respectively. The effects of the ratio of (CH3)2CHOH/H2O in the reaction system and the surfactant (polyvinyl pyrrolidone, PVP) on the morphology of the products were investigated. The experimental results showed that PVP and the solvent isopropanol played important roles in the formation of the uniform microplates. A magnetic nanoporous ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite could be obtained from K2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2·xH2O microplates after calcination at 500 °C. The composite showed a good photocatalytic property in the degradation of rhodamine B and could be easily separated from the reaction mixture through magnetic separation.
1 Introduction
Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3·xH2O, PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as the earliest human designed coordination polymers, have drawn considerable attention owing to their excellent properties for many applications such as catalysis, sensors, hydrogen storage, molecular magnets and so on.1–6 Compared to the considerable work on their properties, the size- and shape-controlled growth of PB and PBAs has been relatively overlooked. Until recent years, much attention was paid into these respects and some achievements were made. With the assistance of PVP, Shen et al.7 and Zhang et al.8 synthesized PB nanocubes and microcubes by a hydrothermal method, respectively. Wu et al.9 fabricated PB sub-microcubes through a sonochemical method. Hu et al.10 prepared Mn3[Co(CN)6]2·nH2O sub-microcubes through a precipitation method in the presence of PVP. Zheng et al.11 obtained PB microcubic mesocrystals by a hydrothermal method in the presence of glucose. In addition, by monitoring the synthesis methods and reaction conditions, PB nanowires,12,13 octahedra14 and pseudo-truncated PB mesocrystals,15 Zn3[Co(CN)6]2·xH2O microspheres and micropolyhedrons,16 and Cd3[Co(CN)6]2·nH2O octahedrons17 were synthesized. It can be observed that single crystalline PB and PBAs often show a cubic morphology while those with other morphologies display a particle-based aggregation feature. This should be closely related to their face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structures, which usually made the cubic morphology be the most stable morphology of PBAs during the classical crystallization of single crystalline. However, those products with a particle-based aggregation feature should originate from non-classical crystallization. Herein, the morphologies of the products often have no relationships to their crystal structures. In either case, these reaction processes all should be in good control to obtain products with regular shapes. So single-precursor hydrothermal methods and modified precipitation methods were dominantly used to realize the size- and shape-controlled growth of PB and PBAs in the above mentioned cases. However, the development of other methods is in its initial stage, such as hydrothermal-assisted precipitation methods. The synthesis of PBAs has rarely been reported by this method, for PBA nanoparticles with irregular morphologies will form immediately through rapid precipitation before the hydrothermal treatment of the reaction solutions. In order to slow the reaction process of precipitation, surfactants and organic solvents were often introduced into the reaction system.10 Under these conditions, uncontrollable rapid reactions can be prevented and subsequent hydrothermal treatment may create interesting results, thus hydrothermal-assisted precipitation methods may be promising for the controllable synthesis of PBAs.
It is well known that single-crystalline PBAs with morphologies other than cubes have seldom been reported, especially those with a two-dimensional (2D) shape.18 The 2D morphology is very interesting because it shows many properties that are not observable in bulk chemistry.19–23 In theory, the 2D PBAs can offer a highly accessible surface area, which can permit guest molecules to enter the nanopores in the PBAs effectively. Moreover, 2D PBAs can provide many active sites for catalytic and electrochemical reactions, so it is of significant importance and interest to fabricate materials with such structures.18 Furthermore, nanoporous metal oxides or composites could be obtained from PB and PBAs by a solid-state transformation,24–27 which could provide a simple method for fabricating various nanoporous metal oxides or composites. However, most current studies have been conducted on pure PB or cobalt-containing PBAs,24–27 which has greatly limited the application of PBAs as precursors to obtain other nanoporous metal oxides or composites. Therefore, it is very important to prepare other PBAs with well-defined shapes.
Zinc-containing PBAs have been widely used in batteries and catalysts.28–31 However well-defined morphologies of zinc-containing PBAs have not been reported yet. In consideration of the facility of controlling the reaction between Zn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3+ by polymer additives, we attempt to prepare zinc-containing PBAs by a hydrothermal-assisted precipitation method. Both ZnFe2O4 and ZnO are important materials which have a great application potential in many fields. ZnFe2O4 is one of the most interesting ferrites. ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles have a considerable photo-response in the visible light region (1.92 eV) with a good photochemical stability,32 suggesting their potential uses as gas sensors and semiconductor photocatalysts.33 While ZnO has been found to be useful in solar cells, gas sensors, light emitting diodes and catalysts.34–37 Therefore, the nanoporous ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite may combine the superior qualities of both materials.
In the present work, large-scale K2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2·xH2O (ZPBA) with a well-defined quasi square plate structure was synthesized through a hydrothermal-assisted precipitation method based on the previously presented work10 in the presence of PVP. It is the first time to achieve ZPBA with such a 2D structure. Furthermore, we converted ZPBA to a magnetic nanoporous ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite successfully. Furthermore the catalytic efficiency of the composite was investigated for the degradation of rhodamine B (RB) under UV light radiation.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without purification. A typical synthetic experiment was as follows. Solution A: 0.21 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 1 g PVP (K-30) were dissolved in 20 ml isopropanol under agitated stirring for 20 min to get an absolute transparent solution. Solution B: 0.14 mmol K3Fe(CN)6 was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water with stirring to get a homogeneous solution. Solution B was added into solution A slowly and regularly. The whole reaction process was kept at room temperature with agitated stirring. After 10 min, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 120 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature naturally, the obtained precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. After the solid was dried, white ZPBA products were obtained.
For the preparation of the nanoporous ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite, 50 mg of ZPBA power was calcined for 2 h under 500 °C in air (at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1).
2.2 Characterization
The phase composition of the prepared samples were monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X'Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation and conventional θ–2θ geometry. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results were recorded on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. A JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operating at a 200 kV accelerating voltage was used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum was measured at wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1 using a Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The porosity of the calcined sample was determined by N2 adsorption using an ASAP-2000 surface area analyzer. The transmission 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum was collected using a Mössbauer spectrometer in a constant acceleration mode with a 57Co(Pd) source. The measurement was performed at room temperature. Hyperfine interaction parameters were derived from the Mössbauer spectrum using a least-squares method. The spectrometer was calibrated using a standard 25 μm α-Fe foil. The magnetic property of the ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite was studied with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (LakeShore 736) at room temperature.
2.3 Photocatalysis experiment
The calcined product was used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of RB in an aqueous solution. In a typical process, 50 mg of the obtained ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO samples were added to 50 mL 10 mg L−1 RB solution and then stirred in the dark for 40 min, which ensured the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of RB on the sample. The solution was then exposed to UV irradiation with a distance of 20 cm from a 250 W high-pressure Hg lamp at room temperature. Every 5 min, 1 mL of solution was taken from the beaker and diluted to 5 mL, and then centrifuged. The concentration of RB in the supernatant was analyzed using a UV-2802S Spectrophotometer made by UNIC at a wavelength of 553 nm. A control experiment was carried out without any catalyst.
3 Results and discussion
A XRD pattern of the as-prepared products is shown in Fig. 1. All the diffraction peaks can be well-indexed as K2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2∙xH2O (JCPDS 33-1061), which agrees well with previous reports.38 The narrow and sharp peaks suggest that these products are highly crystalline. No characteristic peaks of impurities can be detected. Fig. 2(a) is an FESEM image of the typical ZPBA, in which perfect quasi square plates can be found. These plates have an average side length of about 750 nm and an averaged thickness of around 160 nm as shown in the inset picture. The surfaces of the plates were relatively smooth, and no obvious defects or voids could be observed. Fig. 2(b) is a typical TEM image of an individual plate. SAED patterns taken from it showed its single-crystalline nature, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). This is the first example of the formation of ZPBA with a uniform quasi square plate shape, and the information about how such plates are formed can guide the shape-controllable synthesis of other PBAs in the future.

The role of PVP was examined by adjusting the content of PVP. When 4 g of PVP were added, the morphology of the products remained basically unchanged (Fig. 3(a)). On decreasing the amount of PVP to 100 mg, products with different shapes came into being as shown in Fig. 3(b), plate-like and cubic products with various sizes could be detected. If no PVP was used with other experimental parameters kept constant, small octahedron particles and larger hexagon plates could be formed as shown in Fig. 3(c). It can be observed that the content of the quasi square microplates in the resulted products increased with the increase of the PVP amount. This result indicates that PVP may adsorb on a certain crystal plane selectively, which results in plate-like products.39,40 The higher the PVP amount, the stronger the interaction of PVP with a certain crystal plane, and more ZPBA microplates would be achieved. The existence of PVP was confirmed by the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 3(d)) of the as-prepared sample. The dominant peak at 2097 cm−1 was attributed to the CN stretching,41 while the peak at 1640 cm−1 can be well ascribed to the CO stretching of the PVP amide unit.42 In addition, isopropanol also plays an important role in the formation of ZPBA microplates. The plates disappeared when the volume of isopropanol was 35 mL while the deionized water was 5 mL. Irregular particles and their aggregations were obtained as displayed in Fig. 4(a). When no isopropanol was added, the product was amorphous and its XRD pattern was shown in Fig. 4(b). These results indicated that the isopropanol also has a large influence on both the morphology and crystallinity of the finial product, but the accurate mechanism is unknown and needs further research.

It is to be noted that two unexpected points different from the immediate precipitation preparation of PBAs were observed. The first surprising point lies in that the mixed reaction solution kept transparent at room temperature in our experiment. It is known to all that PBAs generally have a small solubility-product constant (Ksp) and they have long been synthesized by direct precipitation methods.43,44 For example, Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2·xH2O will be immediately generated by the direct mixing of Zn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3−. However, the reaction of Zn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3− was effectively prevented by the addition of PVP in this work. That is to say, the reaction rate were slowed,45 and this provides us enough time to modulate the subsequent reaction. So we can use the hydrothermal method to treat the transparent mixture before the rapidly uncontrolled nucleation. The other distinguishable point is that the [Fe(CN)6]3− ions were reduced to [Fe(CN)6]4− ions during the reaction process. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has never been reported in the preparation of other PBAs. This reduction step should also execute a certain control on the formation of ZPBA quasi square microplates.
According to the above analysis, the growth mechanism of the ZPBA microplates is proposed as follows. PVP may coordinate with Zn2+ and prevent its immediate reaction with [Fe(CN)6]3− after mixing solution A and B, which is supported by the transparent initial reaction solution. With the increase of reaction temperature, [Fe(CN)6]3− will be reduced to [Fe(CN)6]4− gradually by isopropanol, which is consistent with previous reports that alcohols have a reducibility at high temperatures.46,47 At the same time, the coordination interaction of PVP and Zn2+ would weaken at a high temperature and the ZPBA nuclei formed. During the subsequent growth of the nuclei, PVP may selectively adsorbed on specific crystal surfaces of the ZPBA crystal nuclei leading to the formation of ZPBA microplates,39,40 which is confirmed by the above results that products with other morphologies appeared when the amount of PVP was decreased. In conclusion, it is due to the combined function of isopropanol and PVP that the ZPBA microplates could be synthesized.
It is expected that ZPBA can serve as a new precursor to fabricate a nanoporous mixed ZnFe2O4–ZnO composite because PB itself can be transformed into nanoporous iron oxides or composites at high temperatures in air.27Fig. 5(a) shows the XRD pattern of the sample obtained after calcination of the precursor at 500 °C, and all of the diffraction peaks can be well assigned to ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) and ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS 22-1012). It is noteworthy that remarkably broadened peaks (peaks labelled as 2) corresponding to ZnFe2O4 are observed. This implies that some defects exist in the produced ZnFe2O4 phase, that is, the product may not fit the standard stoichiometric ratio. Therefore, these as-prepared samples could be considered as a ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite, which will be confirmed by the following researches. The room temperature Mössbauer spectrum and hyperfine parameters of the sample are shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table 1, respectively. It can be seen that the spectrum shows a broad sextet along with a central doublet. It is well known that stoichiometric zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) has a normal spinel structure and Zn2+ has a marked preference only for the tetrahedral (A) sites, whereas the iron ions prefer the octahedral (B) sites. This structure results in a paramagnetic behavior and a typical doublet Mössbauer spectrum of zinc ferrite at room temperature. However, the broadened sextet appearing in Fig. 5(b) shows some ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic properties which may come from the structural defects in the prepared composite.48 Moreover, the quadrupole shift value of the doublet in Table 1 is relatively higher than that of the pure ZnFe2O4,49 which further indicates the existence of the structural defects in the prepared composite. These results are consistent with the result of the XRD. Fig. 5c exhibits the room temperature magnetic hysteresis loop of the prepared composite. The non-linear dependence of the magnetization on the applied magnetic field and the 6.287 emu g−1 magnetization in the magnetic field of 18 kOe indicates some ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic character of the composite which is consistent with the sextet Mössbauer spectrum in Fig. 5b. Though there seems no hysteresis in Fig. 5c, the inset figure shows that the sample has an extremely small remanence (0.015 emu g−1) and coercivity (15 Oe). This means that the composite has a good soft magnetic property. In addition, though the magnetism is relatively poor, it is enough for the magnetic separation of the composite from solutions. Fig. 5(d) demonstrates a TEM image of the composite prepared by the calcination of the ZPBA microplates. Most of the particles retained the initial morphology of the ZPBA plates except that numerous nanopores emerged after calcination. The SAED pattern taken from it showed the poly-crystalline nature of the single microplate consisting of single-crystalline nanocrystals in a random lattice orientation, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(d). The reason for the formation of a porous structure is not only related to the existence of carbon and nitrogen elements in ZPBA, but also associated with the intrinsic open framework structure of ZPBA. When heated at a high temperature in air, both carbon and nitrogen are oxidized into gases and then escape from the initial crystals. At the same time, the intrinsic open framework structure of ZPBA50 would collapse and also caused voids. These two aspects all contributed to the formation of the porous ZnFe2−xO4-ZnO composite. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the sample prepared at 500 °C was measured to be 15.35 m2 g−1. The pore-size distribution calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method showed a very broad peak ranging from 5 nm to 60 nm as shown in Fig. 6. This wide distribution of the nanopores was also confirmed by direct TEM observation.

The photocatalytic performance of the calcined ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO nanoporous sheet architectures was investigated by monitoring the degradation of RB in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. For a comparative purpose, the photodegradation efficiency of RB mediated without any photocatalyst under UV irradiation was investigated. The changes in the concentration of RB with UV irradiation time were plotted and shown as Fig. 7. In the absence of any catalyst, the concentration of RB decreased gradually and about 37% of RB was degraded under UV irradiation within 90 min. One can see clearly that the concentration of RB decreased dramatically when 50 mg of the ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO sample was added and almost all of the RB was degraded within 90 min. The result shows that the ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO nanoporous sheets display a higher photocatalytic activity.

From what has been discussed above, the magnetic property of ZnFe2−xO4 will give it a good performance in magnetic separation for the ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO photocatalyst. We investigated the magnetic separation property of the ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 8, the catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, single-crystalline ZPBA quasi square plates were successfully prepared in the presence of PVP through a hydrothermal-assisted precipitation method. PVP and isopropanol played important roles in controlling the morphology of ZPBA. By using ZPBA quasi square microplates as precursors, a nanoporous ZnFe2−xO4–ZnO composite could be prepared without the collapse of the original morphology. The as-prepared composite showed a good photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RB and the catalyst could be easily magnetically separated from the reaction mixture. This method may be extended to the controlled synthesis of other PBAs.
