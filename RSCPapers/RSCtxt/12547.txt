    , Accepted 16th March 2022First published on 16th March 2022AbstractDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) are modified versions of ionic liquids (ILs) and are formed by the fusion of polar components (liquids or solids) via hydrogen bonding interactions. DESs are prepared by the simple mixing of two or three cheap constituents (that are capable of self-association) with gentle heating, which leads to a drastic decrease in their melting points. The resultant clear homogeneous mixture consists of cations, anions, as well as neutral molecules; this will contribute both ionic and molecular solvent properties to the DESs. DESs have emerged as alternatives to conventional organic solvents and ILs, which meet different criteria such as availability, low cost, low toxicity, biodegradability, recyclability, ease of preparation method, tunable, and designer physiochemical properties. Many of them have attracted considerable attention and haave been applied in distinct fields of chemistry. To summarize the full-scale development of DESs, this review discusses the history, classifications, various methods of preparation, properties, and some major applications in catalysis in the last three years. This review is expected to be helpful for the further development of DESs based on a summary of the fundamental research in the field.

1. Introduction
Green chemistry is now a quickly flourishing subdiscipline in the field of chemistry and it aims to reduce chemical-related impact on the earth, but it is not a complete solution to all environmental problems. In 1991, Paul T. Anastas and John C. Warner formulated the twelve principles of green chemistry as a checklist guide to chemists to evaluate a chemical process at the beginning stage (as it prevents the pollution at the molecular level).1 The first principle of green chemistry is ‘prevention instead of remediation’ and the latter are (2) maximize atom economy and design, (3) less hazardous chemical synthesis, (4) safer chemicals, (5) safer solvents and auxiliaries, (6) energy efficiency, (7) use of renewable feedstocks, (8) reduce derivatives, (9) use catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents, (10) design for degradation, (11) real-time analysis for pollution prevention, and (12) hazard and accident prevention.1 Thus, the chemical industry is giving major priority to sustainable replacements in important processes.
In 2015, Jessop et al. listed general requirements and some alternatives such as greener antimicrobials, greener small amines, greener chelating agents and sequestering agents, greener boron alternatives, greener fragrance raw materials, greener corrosion inhibitors, greener replacements for alkanolamides, greener surfactants, greener UV screens, and greener solvents.2 Most of the conventional solvents used do not follow the principles of green chemistry because of their inherent toxicity and volatility. Easy recyclable approaches used in green chemistry are utilization of supercritical fluids (e.g., sc CO2), water, fluorous solvents, polyethylene glycol (PEG), solvent free condition, glycerol, liquid polymers, room temperature ILs, DESs, and low melting mixtures.3 ILs have gained great attention during the past few decades and ethylammonium nitrate ([EtNH3][NO3]) was the first IL (melting point: 13–14 °C), which was reported in 1914.4 ILs are salts in the liquid state and their properties can be tuned by changing the constituent ions (cation and anion) used. Generally, ILs suffer from some drawbacks such as toxicity, high cost, tedious preparation and purification process, less biodegradability, and moisture sensitivity.5 Because of these issues, researchers were forced to rethink about alternate methods and this led to the invention of DESs, an improved version of ILs.
2. Definition and chemistry of DESs
The term ‘eutectic’ was originated from the Greek word eutēktos meaning “easy to melt”, which is interpreted as “reducing the melting point after mixing”.6 A eutectic system is a mixture of two substances that suppresses melting points of each of the components (or a mixture of substances that exhibits a single chemical composition that freezes at a lower temperature than any other composition).7 The solid–liquid phase diagram represents the temperatures at which crystalline solid states of a mixture of substances are at equilibrium with liquid states and a eutectic (a composition that has a lower melting point than any other composition, including the pure components) may occur in binary mixtures.8 The eutectic point corresponds to the minimum in the liquidus curve, indicating the equilibrium between a liquid phase and two crystalline phases.7 The resultant mixture has its own characteristics and the melting point depression is directly proportional to the interaction between the pure components.9 This effect is schematically shown in the phase diagram presented in Fig. 1 (green line). The crossing point indicates the eutectic point and the corresponding temperature is the eutectic temperature, which corresponds to the minimum melting temperature of the different compositions. It could be the congruent melting (the liquid formed on fusion of these compounds crystallizes back on cooling to the same compound) or incongruent melting (the original compound is not reformed on cooling the liquid melt but either of the initial components may crystallize out).8 The eutectic process is described as a three-phase transformation that occurs at a certain temperature and pressure. During solid–liquid phase transition, generally, the effect of pressure is negligible. The relationship between state functions (such as entropy and chemical potential) and temperature was discussed by Yu et al. in 2021.6
 Fig. 1  Solid–liquid phase diagram of simple ideal eutectic mixture (green line) and deep eutectic mixture (red line). 
DESs are liquids when they have a eutectic or near-eutectic composition, formed from appropriately mixed Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases.10 They are compositions of two constituents (a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor), a solid organic salt, and a complexing agent, which are liquids at ambient temperature (freezing point ≤25 °C).8 Thus, the melting point of the eutectic mixture is much lower than the individual components used and the term “deep” is used to indicate this large depression, where the eutectic point is below that of an ideal eutectic mixture. This effect is indicated by the red line in Fig. 1 and is dependent upon the pure constituents and their composition.11 Different methods are available in the literature to achieve solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) diagrams of binary mixtures. Commonly used methods are mixing of constituents with heating until a homogeneous liquid is formed; allowing the cooling and measurement of the temperature when the solid phase has appeared. Another method is using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), on heating the mixture, an endothermic peak is observed, the onset of which indicates the melting point.8
The interaction between the hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) results in charge delocalization, thereby lowering the lattice energy and melting point compared to pure substances.10 DESs are improved versions of ILs since some of their components are uncharged; they cannot be considered as conventional ILs.9 They can satisfy most of the criteria that meet the green chemistry principles such as nonflammability, biodegradability, recyclability, low cost, wide liquid range, wide applicability, can be prepared with 100% atom economy, and no need of additional purification.9–13
3. History of DESs
DESs are a new class of ILs with similar characteristics and properties. The studies based on these emerging green solvents are at their infancy as the first report related to this topic was only in 2001.14 Based on the extended study of ILs, Abbot et al. discovered these neoteric solvents. They prepared different melts using metal chlorides (MCl2, M = Zn and/or Sn) with quaternary ammonium salts of the formula [Me3NC2H4Y]Cl (Y = OH, Cl, OC(O)Me, OC(O)Ph) and abbreviated as ‘Lewis-acidic ionic liquids’. The catalytic activity of the prepared melt formed from ChCl–MCl2 (1:2) (M = Zn or Sn) was checked for Diels–Alder reaction15 and their chemical and electrochemical properties were studied.16 Later, the idea was extended to other hydrated metal salts (CaCl2·6H2O, LaCl3·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, LiNO3·4H2O, and Zn(NO3)2·4H2O) and ChCl/CrCl3·6H2O system was characterized specifically.17
In 2003, Abbot et al. reported the eutectic mixture formed from choline chloride (ChCl) and urea at 1:2 ratio with unusual solvent properties.18 Eutectic mixtures occur at 1:2 ratio of ChCl and urea with a melting point of 12 °C (obtained from the phase diagram); the mixture is now commercially named as reline. The melting point is much lower than that of the pure constituents (melting point of ChCl = 302 °C and urea = 133 °C) and the depression in the freezing point might be from the interaction between urea molecules and chloride ions. An abnormal deep melting point depression was observed during their experiment, which led to the invention of DES and the term “deep” was used to relate the phenomenon. The melt exists at low temperature, which is enough to give access to various applications as solvents/catalysts/electrolytes. Later, the study was extended using various carboxylic acids instead of amides.19
The term ‘deep eutectic solvent’ was initially used to describe eutectic mixtures formed from quaternary ammonium salts and HBDs. But eventually it was used for all eutectic-based ILs and were classified in to three types. Type I is a combination of quaternary ammonium salts and metal chlorides.14,20 The anhydrous metal halides with low melting points suitable to form eutectic composition are limited. This problem can be solved using hydrated metal halides instead of anhydrous metal halides and are named as Type II DES.17 The melting point of Type II DES is further decreased due to the water of hydration, which will further decrease the lattice energy.9 Type III DESs consist of a mixture of quaternary ammonium salts and HBDs (such as amides, carboxylic acids, or polyols).18,19 Later, the same idea was expanded using metal salts/metal salt hydrate and HBDs, and was classified as Type IV DES.21 Type V DESs are a new class of DES and were reported recently. They are made up of non-ionic molecular substances as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.22 They are named as non-ionic DESs (for example, 1:2 mole ratio of thymol:menthol system). Even though the ionic contribution is not present in Type V DESs, they exhibit the melting point characteristics of DESs. This might be due to the extensive hydrogen bonding present in this DES. In general, the formula of DESs is Cat+X−zY, where Cat+ is any ammonium/phosphonium/sulfonium cation (ChCl is the most commonly used cation) and X is generally a Lewis base (generally chloride/a halide ion). In the term zY, Y is the Lewis/Brønsted acid and z is the number of Y molecules interacting with X (halide ion).9
From these observations, it was concluded that DESs were combinations of HBDs and HBAs. Typical HBDs used for the preparation are alcohols, carboxylic acids, amides, amino acids, and the HBAs are ChCl, tetraalkylammonium halides, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, and metal halides/hydrated metal halides (Table 1).23

4. Other classes of DESs
There are three particular classes of DESs with increasing attention in recent times. They are natural deep eutectic solvents, therapeutic deep eutectic solvents, poly-quasi eutectic solvents, and polymeric deep eutectic solvents. Their interesting characteristics and attractive promising applications justify a more detailed description of these types of eutectic solvents.
4.1 Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs)
The more sustainable form of DESs derived from cellular metabolites such as alcohols, amino acids, organic acids, and sugars are called NADES.24 In 2011, Choi and co-workers discovered this new class of DES during their attempt to elucidate the solubility of intracellular compounds (which are insoluble in water and lipids).25 In the same way as that of DESs, NADESs are also chemically tailorable solvents formed by combining suitable HBDs and HBAs at different ratios via hydrogen bonding interactions. It could be noted that there was no clear differentiating line between DESs and NADESs; eutectic mixtures derived from natural metabolites (for example ChCl/glucose) can be considered as both DES and NADES.26 These neoteric solvents play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and many biological processes (germination, drought resistance, dehydration, etc.).27 An important process, ‘organ cryopreservation’ in living organisms, is based on the phenomenon to withstand the huge thermal amplitudes between winter and summer (where NADESs acts as cryoprotective agents).28 Living organisms are able to produce metabolites such as sugars, organic acids, choline derivatives, and urea. NADESs are formed when these metabolites are combined in particular compositions that will deeply decrease the freezing temperature of water, thereby preventing the disruption of cells.28 In addition to this, NADESs are used in extraction, chromatography, biomass pre-treatment, and enzymatic saccharification.29 Some biomedical applications are also reported for NADESs based on their biological activities.30 During the preparation of NADES, some fatty acids and terpenes can act both as HBDs and HBAs.31
4.2 Therapeutic deep eutectic solvents (THEDESs)
Deep eutectic systems formed using active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as one of the components are named as THEDESs.32–34 This special eutectic category can reduce many problems associated with drug solubility, bioavailability, difficulty in manufacture, handling, and permeability.33 In 1998, Stott and co-workers reported the eutectic mixtures formed between ibuprofen and menthol via hydrogen bonding interactions.35 It was observed that transdermal delivery can be enhanced via melting point depression by eutectic and solid solution formulations. In 2009, Morrison and coworkers studied the solubilities of some drugs in ChCl/urea DES.36 THEDES (a combination of menthol and camphor with dissolved ibuprofen) was reported by Tuntarawongsa and Phaechamud in 2012.37 Higher solubility of ibuprofen was observed in DES compared to water. In 2014, Wang et al. reported that the permeation of the THEDES (lidocaine:ibuprofen system) could be tuned based on the molar ratio of the components.38 In 2016, Aroso et al. reported therapeutic DES based on ChCl or menthol with three different APIs, acetylsalicylic acid, benzoic acid, and phenylacetic acid.33 Further, they explored the system by studying the structural features, thermal behavior, antibacterial activity, and dissolution rate (in PBS-phosphate buffered saline). Higher dissolution was observed for APIs in the form of THEDES compared to pure APIs. DES based on paeonol and matrine with various molar fractions of matrine were developed by Wu et al.39 They further studied their cytotoxicity and physicochemical properties and DESs showed relatively lower inhibitory activity on tyrosinase as compared with the paeonol at the same concentration as that in DES. Moreover, DESs displayed lower cytotoxicity than that of paeonol. This work gave information for the application of these DESs, which may be considered as potential candidates for the transdermal delivery of paeonol.39 THEDES based on osthole and paeonol were prepared and characterized by Yin et al.40 THEDESs has been proven to retain the bioactivities of pure APIs and showed better solubility than pure APIs in water. The permeation behavior of the THEDES was compared to that of pure APIs in gel form, and the results suggested that the THEDES had better permeation ability than pure APIs at the same concentrations. This shows the potential application of THEDES in transdermal delivery systems with great simplicity and convenience.40 Recently, Oliveira et al. discussed the challenges and opportunities of THEDES for the treatment of tuberculosis and colorectal cancer.41 The most important criteria for an efficient therapeutic drug for cancer treatment is to have as less side effects as possible on normal patients’ cells. This can be achieved using lower doses of the drugs or by designing them to be highly selective toward its target.42 Research based on THDESs has not been extensively explored and only little information based on the structure and properties are available in the literature.
4.3 Poly-quasi eutectic solvents (PQESs)
In 2017, Jiang et al. proposed the concept of PEGylated DESs.43 They named these systems as Poly-quasi Eutectic Solvents (PQESs).44 PQESs composed of polymers, namely, polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block poly(ethylene glycol) (P123), poly(propylene glycol)bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (PPG-NH2), and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (DMPEG) and hydrogen bonding donors (HBDs, including carboxylic acids and amides) have been developed.44 They are used for oxygen evolution reaction and metal oxide processing application.43,44
4.4 Polymeric deep eutectic solvents (PODESs)
When the hydrogen bond donor portion of a DES is polymerizable, it can be named as polymeric deep eutectic solvents (PDESs) or polymerized deep eutectic solvents (PDESs).45 In 2013, Mota-Morales et al. prepared DESs formed from various ammonium salts and acrylic acids/acrylamides (as HBDs) and were capable of sustaining frontal polymerization.46 The reactivity and frontal polymerization process is based on the choice of the ammonium salts and the completely converted polymer can be applied for biomedical applications such as drug delivery. In this case, DESs play multiple roles; the supplying monomer acts as an active filler and polymerization medium.46 Free-radical polymerizations of and in deep eutectic solvents for the green synthesis of functional materials were discussed by Mota-Morales et al.47 Wierzbicki et al. developed deep eutectic monomers (DEMs) by the dissolution of selected tetrabutylammonium salts serving as HBAs in methacrylic acid (MAA). Here, MAA is acting both as HBD and vinyl monomer.48 The influence of chloride, nitrate, hydrogen sulphate, and fluoroborate anions on the properties of DEMs and the course of radical photopolymerization was systematically studied. From the results, it was concluded that the degree of coordination of MAA in DEMs by anions follows the order: Cl− > NO3− > HSO4− ≫ BF4− and the strength of hydrogen bonds between HBD and HBA in DEMs is lower than in MAA dimers. Real-time FT-IR spectroscopy studies on the photopolymerization of DEMs indicate that the mixtures formed from MAA and tetrabutylammonium fluoroborate show significant lower initial photopolymerization rate in comparison with other investigated DEMs, which polymerize with similar rates.48 In general, PODESs are alternatives to ILs, successfully applied in nanotechnology,49 gas separation,50 and catalysis51
5. Preparation methods
DESs are formed by the mixing of suitable HBDs and HBAs at appropriate ratios; chemical reactions are not involved in the process. Thus, the process can be named as ‘preparation’ and not synthesis.23 Several methods are employed in the literature for the preparation of DESs to ensure their reproducibility. These include mixing of the components using mortar and pestle, stirring of components with gentle heating, freeze drying method, and vacuum evaporation method (Table 2).

The grinding method was introduced to prepare DESs without using heat. This method involved the grinding of HBDs and HBAs using mortar and pestle at room temperature until a homogenous mixture was obtained.52–54 The method was introduced by Florindo et al. for the preparation of DESs based on cholinium chloride and carboxylic acids.53
The most commonly used method (from the beginning onward) for the preparation of DESs was the heating and stirring method.14–21 The temperature was selected based on the melting point, boiling point, and stability of the reagents. It is necessary to identify the appropriate temperature and time to achieve the successful preparation of DESs; high temperature may lead to the decomposition of some compounds.
Freeze drying method involves the mixing of accurately weighed components, dissolving the same in the minimum amount of double distilled water, centrifuged, followed by cooling to −80 °C, and then freeze-dried by lyophilization to achieve a clear viscous liquid.55–58
The vacuum evaporation method was used for the first time for the preparation of NADESs, where the HBDs and HBAs were dissolved in water, and the water was evaporated by rotary vacuum evaporation at 50 °C to yield the DES. This method used relatively lower temperature for the process compared to heating and stirring method, and was commonly used for components with higher melting points.59–61
Twin screw extrusion method is a mechanochemical approach using a twin-screw extruder (TSE) that has been employed to overcome limitations of the heating and stirring method during the large-scale preparation of DESs.62 This consists of two counter rotating screws encased in a stainless-steel barrel with multiple conveying and kneading sections. The conveying sections move the materials forward and the kneading section applies high shear and compression forces on the material as it passes through. HBDs and HBAs (stoichiometric ratios) are added after preheating all sections of the TSE.
Microwave irradiation method is generally the faster and cheaper method for DES production.63–65 Here, the HBDs and HBAs are microwave irradiated for 20 seconds. But the careful optimization of heating time, power, and selection of components are important in this method.
DESs can be prepared by the use of ultrasonic waves (ultrasound-assisted preparation method).64,66 Stoichiometric amounts of HBDs and HBAs are mixed in a glass vial, sealed, and placed in an ultrasonic bath. The time and temperature for the formation of DES is based on pure constituents.
6. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic DESs
Due to extended hydrogen bonding interactions, DESs reported in earlier times were mostly hydrophilic, which easily dissolved in water. Their solubility in water was dependent on the nature of pure constituents used. Based on that, DESs are classified into hydrophilic and hydrophobic. The preparation and physicochemical properties of hydrophilic DESs are given in this section. Hydrophobic DESs will be discussed later.
6.1 Physicochemical properties of hydrophilic DESs
Similar to ILs, DESs are tailormade solvents and their physicochemical properties can be tuned by altering the constituents used.9 Task-specific DESs with distinct properties can be designed based on various applications. Important physicochemical properties of DESs (such as phase behavior, freezing point, density, viscosity, surface tension, conductivity, acidity or alkalinity, thermal stability, polarity and solubility properties of DESs) will be discussed in this section.

6.1.1 Phase diagram and melting point. 
DESs are formed by the hydrogen bonding interaction between the pure constituents and the depression in freezing point is based on the strength of this interaction.11 The number of reports based on the construction of the phase diagram for DESs are limited. Abbott and co-workers tried to establish the phase diagram for most of their systems.18,19,67,68 Various obstacles are encountered during the construction of phase diagrams of DESs. Several molecules used for DES preparation are not thermally characterized; thus, they may get degraded during the process. Large melting point difference between the constituents also makes some complexity in the process. Because of these issues, most authors failed to establish phase diagram and adopted to prepare mixtures with some proportions (mostly 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc.).69 This is based on the idea that there is no special significance of using eutectic composition. The eutectic composition is an intersection of two melting curves, which are predominated by the fusion properties more than the interactions of HBDs and HBAs.69
By selecting the right combination of the constituents, the designer nature of the DESs can be enhanced, which broadens its applicability.69 The designer nature will give an additional degree of freedom to the definition of DESs and the applications are no longer restricted to the eutectic composition only.69 This will give a new definition to the DESs: “Deep eutectic solvents are mixtures of two or more constituents with a eutectic temperature lower than that of ideal mixtures and they can exist as liquids at the operating temperature of the system or process.”
The cooling curve method is the commonly used method for the construction of phase diagram in conventional systems. But this method is difficult to apply in some combinations of DESs due to the large depression in melting point. DSC is the most used instrumental technique for the determination of melting point and further for the construction of phase diagram due to its simplicity, availability, and speed.70,71 Here, the sample and the reference (with a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperature) are placed in holders of the instrument. When the sample undergoes a phase transition, heat will be required or heat will be liberated to maintain the sample and the reference at the same temperature. Heat absorbed or released during the phase transitions can be measured using DSC. Phase diagrams of some DESs are constructed by this way. These include the phase diagram of DES composed of ChCl and urea,72 menthol and lauric acid,73 ibuprofen-poly(ethylene glycol)-6000 system,74 acetaminophen-caffeine system,74 ibuprofen-lauric acid, ibuprofen-palmitic acid mixtures,75 ZrOCl2·8H2O-urea,70etc. But for some other DESs, instead of a freezing point, a glass transition temperature was observed in the DSC thermogram. Only glass transition temperature was observed in the case of potassium carbonate-glycerol76 and ChCl–lactic acid77 systems over a wide range of ratios used in their work. The same observation was later reported in ZrOCl2·8H2O-ethylene glycol/glycerol DESs70 and CeCl3·7H2O-urea/ethylene glycol/glycerol/lactic acid systems.71 This group is generally termed as Low Transition Temperature Mixtures (LTTM).76 Some eutectic mixtures with molar ratio of DES and melting point/glass transition temperature of DES are given in Table 3. Entries 1–6 represent DES with their corresponding melting points and 7–11 represent DES with their glass transition temperatures.

6.1.2 Density (ρ) and viscosity (η) of DESs. 
Density and viscosity are two important physical properties of solvents, which lead to a better understanding of the liquid behavior. Studies based on viscosities of DESs are important for their application in distinct fields and this transport property controls many applications of DESs such as catalysis, synthesis, and other solvent applications.78 The values are generally higher than water and common organic solvents but comparable to those of ILs (density vary in the range of 1.1 g cm−3 and 2.4 g cm−3).67 This is mainly due to the large ion to hole radius ratio in both DESs and ILs.21 The effect was clearly explained using hole theory (which was previously used to explain the physical properties of ILs). The holes created (with random size and position) in a liquid during its melting process are in constant motion. The free movement of ions will occur only if the holes are present adjacent to them with size greater than or equal to ions. Abbot et al. explained the reason for the difference in the density value of ZnCl2/urea (1.63 g cm−3) and ZnCl2/acetamide (1.36 g cm−3) using hole theory and hydrogen bonding interaction (Table 4).21

The stark difference in the density values of these eutectic systems indicates the difference in their packing, even though both the HBDs are similar in size. Similar to ILs, DESs are also composed of holes or empty spaces and the size of these holes determine their density and the values are higher than the pure constituents. This difference is due to the varying degree of hydrogen bonding in these two systems. Compared to ZnCl2/acetamide DES system, and ZnCl2/urea can form better hydrogen bond network in the liquid using two NH2 groups. This extensive hydrogen bonding reduces the void size in ZnCl2/urea DESs. Also, the radii of cations are 3.56 and 3.57 Å in ZnCl2/urea and ZnCl2/acetamide systems, respectively (Table 4). This led to a large value for the ratio of ion radius and hole radius (2.83 and 2.43 Å for urea and acetamide-based eutectic mixtures). As a result, the suitably sized holes will be limited within the ZnCl2/urea eutectic mixture compared to ZnCl2/acetamide DES and resulted in increased density. This in turn restricts the free motion of ions within the liquid and consequently higher viscosity was observed.
The density and viscosity of some Type IV DESs formed from ZrOCl2·8H2O/CeCl3·7H2O in combination with urea/ethylene glycol/lactic acid are given in Table 5.70,71 A remarkable difference in the density and viscosity were observed and from this, it could be concluded that the density of DESs strongly depends on the pure constituents, hydrogen bond interaction between them, and the molecular organization or packing. In addition to this, some other forces such as van der Waals interactions or electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the high viscosity of DESs.11 Many other reports are available based on the effect of temperature on the density and dynamic viscosities of the DESs (mainly reline). All the studies concluded that the density and viscosity of DESs decreased with increasing temperature.79–81 The density and viscosity of aqueous DES mixture also decreased with increasing mole fraction of water (where water acted as a cosolvent) and the idea was also used in ILs.79–84 This means that the major limitation of DES is their high density and viscosity, which can be overcome by preparing suitable aqueous DES solutions.

6.1.3 Surface tension (γ). 
Surface tension is an important physical property that will give more information on the free ions and molecular ensembles within the liquid. The surface tension of DESs was rarely reported and the values are similar to some imidazolium-based ionic liquids. For ethaline (ChCl/ethylene glycol at 1:2 ratio), glyceline (ChCl/glycerol at 1:2 ratio), and reline (ChCl/urea at 1:2 ratio), the surface tension values are in the range 49–56 mN m−1 at 25 °C.11 Similar to the density and viscosity, the surface tension decreases linearly with increasing temperature and the values are related to the intermolecular interactions between the pure constituents in the DESs.85 The higher density and viscosity of DESs are due to the unavailability of suitably sized holes or vacant space in the liquid. Holes/free volume inside the DES can be increased by decreasing the surface tension of the liquid.86 The effect of various parameters (HBDs, HBAs, solvents, and temperature) on the surface tension of DESs were studied by Chen and co-workers in 2019.87 Fifty varieties of DESs were used and it was observed that both HBDs and HBAs had a significant influence on the surface tension of DESs. The presence of crystal water in the salt component of DESs would decrease the surface tension of DESs. Besides, the surface tension of DESs increased significantly when the water mole fraction was higher than 0.9. However, the surface tension of DESs decreased continuously with the increase in the mole ratio of other investigated solvents.87


6.1.4 Conductivity (k). 
Ionic conductivity is directly proportional to the rate of migration of ions within the DESs; hence, this value is directly proportional to the viscosity.88 Lower conductivity was observed for most of the DESs due to their higher viscosity (lower than 2 mS cm−1 at room temperature).11 The conductivity is strongly related to the pure constituents used and the value increased with an increase in the temperature. This is due to the improved collision frequency of molecules as the temperature increases.88


6.1.5 Acidity or alkalinity. 
Acidity and alkalinity of DESs have a significant impact in designing many organic reactions and optimizing their operating conditions, especially when they are used as catalysts.11 The values are strongly based on the nature of pure constituents and their combination. The Brønsted acidity/basicity of DESs are commonly evaluated by the Hammett acidity function (by determining the ionization ratio of indicators in a system)89 or by pH measurement. For a basic solution, the Hammett acidity function measures the tendency of the solution to capture protons. The Hammett function H_ is defined by the following equation.H_ = pK(HI) + log([I_]/[HI])[I_] = molar concentration of the anionic form of the indicator, [HI] represents the molar concentration of neutral forms of the indicator, and pK(HI) is the thermodynamic ionization constant of the indicator in water. Large H_ value indicates the stronger basicity of the medium. The value of H_ for ChCl/urea (1:2) DES was 10.86 when 4-nitrobenzylcyanide was used as the indicator, which indicated the weakly basic nature of this DES.89 Taysun et al. reported the pH measurement of DESs formed from benzyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (BTMAC) and three different organic acids (p-toluene sulfonic acid) (PTSA), citric acid, and oxalic acid.90 Higher acidity was observed for DES derived from PTSA. This is based on the higher acidity of PTSA compared to citric acid and oxalic acid. This reflects the dependence of acidity/basicity of DESs to that of the pure constituents.
Except Type III DES, all others are composed of metal salts. They may have some Lewis acidity for the corresponding DESs and the reports based on this are limited. Reports based on pH measurements and Hammett acidity function is restricted to Brønsted acidic DESs and are not applicable to DESs containing both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The acidity measurements of these types of mixtures are done by FT-IR spectroscopy using pyridine as the probe molecule.91–95 The method was previously applied in the case of ILs and montmorillonite clay catalysts and the vibration bands in the range of 1400–1700 cm−1 were recorded and could be used to differentiate Lewis and Brønsted sites.91–95 The experiment was conducted for ZrOCl2·8H2O/CeCl3·7H2O-based DESs. Both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are observed in ZrOCl2·8H2O and CeCl3·7H2O in combination with urea (at 1:5 ratio) with a vibration band at 1450 cm−1.70,71 This band indicates the Py-Lewis complex (formed by the interaction of pyridine with Lewis acid sites) and the band at 1540 cm−1 indicates the pyridinium ions ([PyH]+) formed by the interaction of pyridine with Brønsted acid sites. A band at 1540 cm−1 was only observed for the remaining DESs, indicating the Brønsted acidity of these systems. These results highlight the dependence of acidity/basicity of DESs with their pure constituents used for the preparation.


6.1.6 Thermal stability. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are the two major methods of thermal analysis for DESs to determine the thermal stability and melting point/transition temperature. The usefulness of DSC was already discussed during the melting point determination of DESs. In TGA, the changes are measured as a function of increasing temperature (with constant heating rate), or as a function of time (with constant temperature or mass loss).96,97 Zhao et al. studied the thermal stability of ChCl with urea (1:2)/glycerol (1:2) and choline acetate with glycerol (1:1.5 and 1:2 ratios) and it was observed that the decomposition temperature fell in the range from 205 to 216 °C.98 It was concluded that these DESs were stable up to nearly 200 °C.98
The thermal stability of some Type IV DESs was studied and their decomposition temperature are given in Table 5.70,71 Higher thermal stability was observed for ZrOCl2·8H2O and CeCl3·7H2O in combination with urea at 1:5 ratio (273 °C and 275 °C, respectively, Table 5, entry 1 and 3) and lower thermal stability was observed for the remaining DESs in the range of 110–140 °C (Table 5, entry 2, 4, and 5). Similarly, the thermal stability of DESs derived from ChCl with some carboxylic acids (lactic, tartaric, citric, and oxalic acid) was studied in the range of 25–400 °C.99 Thermal stability in the range of 130–200 °C was observed. From these studies, it could be concluded that the thermal stability of DESs is strongly dependent on the pure constituents used.


6.1.7 Polarity and solubility properties of DESs. 
Polarity or polarizability is an important factor indicating the strength of a solvent. In the place of conventional organic solvents, DESs could be used as solvents in organic reactions, extraction of natural products, and metallurgy. Hence, the determination of polarity of DESs is essential. It must be carefully evaluated before designing a reaction since it can influence the solubility of the reactants and change the activation energy.100 The solute–solvent interactions of a medium could be recognized by establishing relative polarity scale. But the number of publications based on the polarity of DESs is limited. Several parameters are used to express the polarity of chemical substances including DESs; the most frequently used quantities are permittivity (dielectric constant) and spectral parameter.100,101
The polarities of DESs formed from ChCl–Glycerol (various molar ratios) were determined by Abbott et al. based on several parameters and values similar to RNH3+X− and R2NH2+X− ionic liquids (with discrete anions) were observed.86 In addition to this, a linear increase in the polarity was observed with increasing concentration of ChCl. Pandey et al. determined the solvent polarity of some common DESs such as reline, ethaline, glyceline, and maline (a combination of ChCl (HBA) and urea, 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, and malonic acid (HBD) at 1:2 ratio, respectively) using various optical spectroscopic probes.102 They observed that the HBDs have a significant influence on the polarity of DESs.
Studies based on the miscibility properties of DESs are very important for many industrial applications such as extraction, separation, and organic synthesis.61,62 DESs are highly soluble in water, methanol, ethanol, etc., and are insoluble in aprotic ones (e.g., toluene, hexane, ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile). This indicates that the solvents that are able to form strong hydrogen bonds with the chloride ion tend to be miscible.76 The higher solubility of DES in water and its insolubility in solvents such as ethyl acetate makes its separation and recycling easier. In 2003, Abbott et al. studied the solvation properties of ChCl–urea DES at 50 °C.18 Compounds such as amino acids, aromatic acids, inorganic salts, and salts that are sparingly soluble in water (e.g., AgCl) are found to be highly soluble in DES.18 DES could dissolve several metal oxides because of the high anion concentration of these liquids.18 Compared to most molecular solvents, DESs have unusual solvent properties. They are similar to ILs and the solvation properties are strongly influenced by the strength of hydrogen bonds. HBDs have a significant effect in determining the physical properties of DESs.


6.1.8 Effect of water on the structure and properties of DESs. 
DESs are formed by coordinating the constituents via hydrogen-bonding and making them strongly water-miscible and hygroscopic. Understanding the effect of water on the properties of DESs is very important as water in trace amounts is an unavoidable impurity and it can reduce the problematic high viscosity of DESs. Limited numbers of reports are available based on the effects of water on the structure and physicochemical properties of DESs, most of which are mainly focused on reline. In 2014, Shah et al. studied the effect of water on the thermophysical properties of reline (ChCl–urea at 1:2 ratio).103 With the addition of water, properties such as melting point, density, and viscosity of DES are decreased. As a result, the free motion of DESs was increased and hence the conductivity was increased. In 2017, Hammond and co-workers studied the effect of water on the nanostructure of DES (ChCl–urea) over a wide hydration range using neutron total scattering and empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR).104 At low levels (≤1 W = 1:2:1 mole ratio of ChCl–urea–water system), the presence of water strengthened the ChCl–urea bonding by contributing to the hydrogen-bonding network. The intermolecular interaction in DES as far as 10 w (10 w = 1:2:10 mole ratio of ChCl–urea–water system) and after 15 w, the system was described as an aqueous solution of DES components at the molecular level. That is, the addition of water at a low level did not disrupt the DES structure. Molecular dynamics study was also conducted to understand the effects of water on various intermolecular interactions in reline-water mixtures and it was concluded that the reline structure was qualitatively retained at a lower hydration level.105
Responses of solvatochromic probes dissolved in three ChCl-based DESs (with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, and urea 1:2 mol ratios) disclosed that the addition of water to DESs resulted in increased dipolarity/polarizability and a decrease in the H-bond accepting ability (basicity).106 In 2019, Gabriele and co-workers studied the effect of water on DES formed from ChCl and various glycols with oxyethylene units (diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and PEG 200) and it was observed that small amounts of water could increase the fluidity, conductivity, and polarity of the DESs.107 In conclusion, the greenness of DESs is greatly enhanced by adding appropriate amounts of water, the most environment-friendly solvent. The addition of water has little influence on the chemical properties but has a remarkable influence on the physical properties; in particular, the addition of water improves the mass transport characteristics of DESs. Water can be used as a green co-solvent to improve the properties of DESs and can be used for various applications. The aqueous solution of Reline (90% water) was used for the effective removal of post-etch residues from electrical circuit boards.108 Reline water mixture was used for the synthesis of shape controlled gold nanoparticles, where the mixture exhibited dual role as a reaction medium and a shape-directing agent.109 The solubility of CO2 decreases with increasing water content in the reline water mixture; thus, water can serve as an antisolvent to drive out CO2 dissolved in reline.110 The DES-water binary mixtures can improve the efficiency of lipase-catalyzed lipophilization of phenolic acids compared to pure DES.111

6.2 Physicochemical properties of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HDESs)
The DESs studied and classified in earlier times are all hydrophilic character. However, their applications are only limited to polar compounds. Their restricted applications in aqueous samples and destruction of the DES structure in a large amount of water have forced researchers to think about hydrophobic DESs (especially in the analytical chemistry field). The first hydrophobic DESs was reported by van Osch et al. in 2015, consisting of decanoic acid as HBD and various quaternary ammonium salts as HBAs.112 Later, a limited number of hydrophobic DESs were reported; this is due to the unavailability of cheap and easily accessible hydrophobic compounds, which can form eutectic solvents.113

6.2.1 What is a true hydrophobic DESs?. 
In previous times, the term hydrophobic DESs was used to describe the water insoluble DES, which consisted of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components (i.e., water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt as a HBA and water-insoluble non-polar component such as a fatty acid or alcohol as HBD).114,115 But this definition was criticized by Shishov et al. in 2020.116 They observed that hydrophobic DESs containing water soluble quaternary ammonium salt or short-chain carboxylic acids (including acetic acid, 2-oxopropanoic acid, 4-oxopentanoic acid, and butanoic acid) were unstable in water. When this type of DES comes in contact with water, the dissolution of water-soluble constituent occurs, which is followed by the disintegration of the DESs mixture. These types of systems were discarded from the category of HDES and were termed as quasi-hydrophobic DESs or pseudo-hydrophobic DESs.116 Hydrophobic DESs are insoluble or very slightly water-soluble substances that are composed of two or more water-insoluble compounds.


6.2.2 Ionic and non-ionic HDESs. 
Generally, true hydrophobic DESs are classified into ionic and non-ionic HDES based on the constituents used for their preparation. In ionic HDESs, HBAs are long chain quaternary ammonium/phosphonium salts and HBDs are long chain fatty acids (e.g., non-polar fatty acids such as octanoic acid, decanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid) or alcohols (octanol, decanol, and dodecanol).113,117 Non-ionic hydrophobic DES are formed from hydrophobic natural compounds such as monoterpenes (menthol, thymol) and long chain organic acids. However, the number of non-ionic HDES is quite limited due to the unavailability of organic compounds that can form HDES.22,117 In non-ionic HDESs, it is very difficult to distinguish HBD and HBA components. Some of them can act both as HBD and HBA and form HDES stable in water.117 Generally, natural monoterpenes have HBA properties and long chain organic acids have HBD properties. HDESs composed only of non-ionic species have obtained great attention in recent times and are classified as Type V DES.22 They can overcome some problems associated with ionic-HDES such as the higher cost of quaternary ammonium salts with large alkyl groups, hydrophobicity, and viscosity, but their interactions are still unclear.113 The methods of preparation of HDESs are similar to hydrophilic ones that are based on the nature of the pure constituents used.
Similar to hydrophilic DES, the most common approach for the preparation of HDES is simply stirring the constituents at ambient temperature until a homogeneous liquid is formed, as proposed by Abbott in 2003.18 The first HDES introduced was a combination of various quaternary ammonium salts with long alkyl chain and decanoic acid.112 Their stability in aqueous medium was confirmed by studying the water uptake and leaching. The same idea was used for the preparation of other HDES based on DL-menthol and several natural carboxylic acids.118 HDESs composed of compounds from two fatty acids (compounds from the same family) are also reported, where both the acids can function as HBD and HBA. Some examples for HDESs with HBD, HBA, and their corresponding ratios are given in Table 6, where a indicates the unstable HDES in aqueous medium or the previously termed ‘quasi-hydrophobic DESs or pseudo-hydrophobic DESs’. Longer alkyl chain containing components have lesser water solubility and hence they form more stable hydrophobic DES.117

Similar to hydrophilic DES, the physicochemical properties of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (phase behavior-melting/freezing point, density, viscosity, acidity, conductivity, etc.) are based on the nature of the pure constituents and their unique interactions. The selection of HBD is based on the moderate ability to undergo hydrogen bonding interactions and the quaternary ammonium salt with longer alkyl chain favors the hydrophobicity.112


6.2.3 Phase diagram and melting point of hydrophobic DESs. 
Similar to hydrophilic DESs, studies based on hydrophobic DESs have also been started from the application point-of-view without answering some fundamental questions related to them and the solid–liquid phase diagrams for most of them are not available.127 In 2018, Martins and co-workers studied the phase behavior of terpenes (thymol or L(−)-menthol) and various monocarboxylic acids (octanoic, decanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and octadecanoic acid) by DSC. The results were correlated using the Perturbed Chain-Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state.128 These systems exhibited phase behavior with a single eutectic point and a small deviation from ideality (small depression in melting point was observed), which indicated low to moderate interaction between the constituents. However, in the literature, all these mixtures are named as HDESs. The phase behavior of some HDES composed of terpenes and some APIs such as ibuprofen and testosterone were also studied in earlier times.129,130 HDESs based on trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in combination with phenol was also reported recently and their phase diagram was determined by both DSC and visual inspection method.131 Usually, the melting point depression is small in hydrophobic DESs compared to hydrophilic DESs. With an increase in the alkyl chain length of HBD and HBA, the melting/freezing point of ionic HDES increased.132 The same tendency was observed for non-ionic HDES formed from fatty acids.132


6.2.4 Density (ρ), viscosity (η), and surface tension (γ) of hydrophobic DESs. 
Knowledge regarding the density, viscosity, and surface tension of HDESs is very essential and these are very important parameters that strongly affect the extraction processes (one of the major applications of HDESs).117 Contrary to hydrophilic DESs, hydrophobic DESs showed similar or lower density than water and the values were generally lower than that of hydrophilic DESs.127 The density values for ionic HDES are in the range from 0.850 to 0.980 g cm−3 and for non-ionic HDES; the density values are in the range from 0.870 to 1.091 g cm−3.117 The density of HDES was found to decrease with increasing alkyl chain length of HBD or HBA (that is the alkyl chain length of tetraalkylammonium salts or organic acids).127,128,131
Similar to hydrophilic DESs, the viscosity of hydrophobic DESs is strongly based on the nature of pure components used. Interestingly, very low viscosity was observed for hydrophobic DES containing only fatty acids that can simultaneously act as HBD and HBA. For example, the values of viscosity of dodecanoic acid in combination with octanoic, nonanoic, and decanoic acids (at 1:3, 1:3, and 1:2 ratios) are 8.2, 10.1, and 12.9 mPa s, respectively. An increase in the viscosity was observed with increasing alkyl chain length.133 However, high viscosity (86800.0 mPa s) was observed for HDESs composed of atropine-thymol at 1:2 ratio.31 This major change in viscosity is based on the pure constituents selected for preparation. The order of magnitude of viscosity of HDES based on the chemical structure of HBDs is fatty acids ≈ thymol < menthol < quaternary ammonium salts.127 The higher viscosity of HDESs based on quaternary ammonium salts is probably due to the Coulombic forces in the quaternary ammonium salts.
The surface tension of HDESs is generally higher than the common organic solvents but are comparable to that of ILs. The values are based on the interaction between HBD and HBA; the stronger the interaction, the higher will be the surface tension.117 In the case of ionic HDESs, lower viscosity, surface tension, and higher extraction efficiency were observed for HDES consisting of the shortest alkyl chain of both HBA and HBD.134


6.2.5 Thermal stability and volatility of HDESs. 
To assess the viability of HDESs, the knowledge of the thermal stability range is important and this will give the highest operating temperature for the system. The study of the thermal stability of hydrophobic DESs using TGA indicated that their degradation was mainly based on the pure components used for their preparation.135 The volatility of HDESs can be determined using headspace gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) and most of the HDESs are found to be non-volatile.136


6.2.6 Solubility of water in HDESs. 
It is important to guarantee the chemical integrity of HDESs as they are used as extractants of solutes from the aqueous phase. This is crucial to ensure that there is no loss of DESs or contamination of water in DES when comes in contact with the aqueous phase, which will affect the thermophysical properties of HDES.127 The water solubility is based on the pure constituents used for HDES preparation. Fatty acid-based HDES can solubilize ≤5 wt% of water, menthol-based HDESs can solubilize <2.5 wt% of water, thymol-based HDESs can solubilize <3.7 wt% of water, and ammonium salts based HDESs can solubilize between 2–7 wt% of water. Based on the above information, the solubility of hydrophobic DESs can be ranked in the order fatty acids < menthol < thymol < quaternary ammonium salts and their solubility decreases with increasing alkyl chain length.127

7. Applications of HDESs
Two major applications of HDESs are the extraction and separation of compounds from the aqueous phase. These are based on the water immiscibility of HDESs. The other applications of HDESs include the removal of pesticides and transition metal ions. This section provides an overview of various applications of HDESs reported in the literature.
7.1 Extraction of volatile fatty acids and other micropollutants from water
The first HDES was reported in 2015, a combination of decanoic acid with various quaternary ammonium salts, and the systems were successfully evaluated for the removal of volatile fatty acids (ethanoic, propionic, and butanoic acids) from water.112 Higher efficiency was observed for HDESs compared to industrially used amine-based extractants such as trioctylamine. HDESs can be applied in different pH environments, i.e., they have the ability to extract both the dissociated and undissociated forms of the acid. Higher extraction efficiency was observed for volatile fatty acids with large alkyl chain length; this may be due to the dispersive interactions between the used hydrophobic DESs and the expected volatile fatty acid.118 Later in 2019, HDESs formed from dihexylthiourea and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) showed the best extraction efficiency for volatile fatty acids over a wide pH range.137
In 2013, HDES-supported liquid membranes (SLMs) were prepared using the procedure similar to the preparation of ionic liquid membranes138 and were successfully used for the selective separation of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural from aqueous solution.139 Here, the three substrates selected were PP2E (HF), M3203B, and 16P10A incorporated with various hydrophobic polymeric materials with different pore sizes/thickness. The hydrophobic membranes “16P10A” and “M3202B” were made up of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and PP2E HF was a polypropylene-based flat sheet membrane. The HDESs used were decanoic acid in combination with n-tetraoctylammonium bromide (N8888Br), thymol, menthol (at 2:1, 1:1, and 1:1 ratio, respectively), and thymol-lidocaine at 2:1 ratio with different density and viscosity values. The various properties of substrates and HDESs influenced the permeability and diffusivity of furfural/hydroxymethylfurfural. High permeability and separation was observed for both furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural using SLM composed of M3202B with thymol-lidocaine. The addition of HDES (thymol-lidocaine) could increase the transport of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural.
In 2018, Ge et al. prepared HDES consisting of DL-menthol and decanoic acid and was successfully used for the extraction of benzophenone-type UV filters from environmental water samples with relative recoveries of 88.8–105.9%.115 In the same year, HDESs composed of only fatty acids including octanoic, nonanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid (that can act as HBD and HBA simultaneously) were reported with the study of their physicochemical properties.133 All the systems showed good ability to extract bisphenol-A (a dangerous micro-pollutant) from aqueous environments with extraction efficiencies up to 92%. Recently in 2021, HDESs based on menthol and various fatty acids were prepared and their applicability was checked for the removal of the micropollutant ‘bisphenol A’ from contaminated water. Among these, excellent recovery rate (98.2–99.0%) was observed for menthol-propionic acid and menthol-methanoic acid HDES.140
7.2 Extraction of metal ions from water and other phases
Contamination of water with traces of metals such as Cd, Pb, and As makes the water toxic and undrinkable. Liquid–liquid extraction using hydrophobic solvents is the generally accepted method for the removal of metal salts from aqueous solutions. The high cost of some metals such as Pd, Au, and Ag also makes the process more interesting from an economical perspective. In addition to this, the use of neoteric HDESs, instead of conventional organic solvents such as toluene and kerosene for this process makes the extraction more attractive. In 2016, HDES formed from decanoic acid and lidocaine at various molar ratios (2:1, 3:1, and 4:1) were used for the extraction of alkali and transition metal ions from non-buffered water.125 Here, all the metal ions were extracted with high distribution coefficients via the ion exchange mechanism. Low DES/water mass ratios were used even for high Co2+ concentrations and within 5 seconds, the maximum extraction efficiency could be reached.125 In the same year, indium extraction from hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid was reported by Tereshatov et al. using four HDESs.141 Among these, three HDESs formed from tetraheptylammonium chloride with ibuprofen/(Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid/decanoic acid (7:3, 1:2, and 1:2 mole ratio, respectively) furnished very quick indium extraction in the range of 0.001–10.2 M HCl and 1 × 10−7–8 × 10−1 M oxalic acid in the aqueous phase. The efficiency of fourth HDES (DL-menthol and lauric acid at 2:1 mole ratio) was found to be high in aqueous solutions with high acidity (pH ≈ 3).
In 2019, the possibility of HDES (composed of decanoic acid and lidocaine) was checked as the extractant for the separation of Fe3+ and Mn2+ from aqueous solutions.142 The separation was strongly based on the pH of the initial metal solution. At lower pH (lower than 2.0), the ion pair mechanism was observed between Fe(III) and decanoic anion. At higher pH, precipitation took place and the effect of pH could not be evaluated. The same mechanism was observed for Mn2+ at a pH lower than 2.2 and higher than 3.5. In between the pH range, the cation exchange mechanism was the most probable one (cation exchange reaction between Mn2+ and lidocaine cation).142 HDESs formed from terpenes (menthol/thymol) and fatty acids (CnH(2n+1)OOH; n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) were used for the separation of Cu2+ from mild solutions of other transition metals.143 After the careful evaluation of various factors such as terpene selection, chain length of carboxylic acid, and effect of pH, higher Cu2+ extraction efficiency was observed for thymol:decanoic acid HDES from the solutions containing other transition metal ions. Another category of HDES composed of parabens and trioctylmethylammonium was used for the extraction of heavy metal Cr(VI) from the water phase. Excellent efficiency was observed with an extraction capacity as high as 66.7 mg g−1.103
Another study that investigated the HDES formed from trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and phenol for the separation of [UO2]2+ from aqueous acid was reported.131 Another achievement of HDESs was the separation of traces of pertechnetate (99mTcO4−) within 5–60 min in the presence of several competing anions.144 HDES used here was a mixture of tetraalkylammonium (or tetraalkylphosphonium) halide and a monocarboxylic acid at 1:2 molar ratio.
7.3 Separation of pesticide residues from water and other media
Pesticide residues present in soil, water, and other media are harmful to humans and the environment. Neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, the most widely used class of insecticides and commonly used in sunflower, rice, maize, sugar beet, potato, fruits, and vegetables. Due to the presence of several interfering substances in real samples, the determination of neonicotinoid insecticide residues is usually challenging. In 2017, Florindo et al. developed ionic (composed of quaternary ammonium salts and organic acids) and non-ionic (composed of DL-menthol and natural organic acids) HDESs for the separation of four neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, nitenpyram, and thiamethoxam) from dilute aqueous solutions.145 Up to 80% extraction efficiency was observed for the studied neonicotinoids using non-ionic DL-menthol and organic acid-based DES. In 2020, Kachangoon et al. developed a simple hydrophobic DESs-based liquid–liquid microextraction coupled with HPLC for the extraction of neonicotinoid residues.146 The HDESs used here were composed of decanoic acid (HBD) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (HBA) and excellent efficiency was observed for the extraction of neonicotinoid residues from water, soil, and egg yolk samples. Very recently, Sereshti and co-workers introduced liquid polymer-based HDES for the extraction of pesticides from water samples.147 Here, the polymer-based HDESs used are polyacrylic acid with menthol/thymol and polyethylene glycol with thymol. Among the three, higher extraction efficiency was observed for polyethylene glycol with thymol HDESs at 2:1 ratio with a relative recovery in the range from 60.5 to 105.0%.
7.4 Extraction of biomolecules and other medicinal components
Various forms of biologically active and medicinally important compounds are present in the environment. Usually, they are extracted using petrochemicals and volatile organic solvents. In 2015, Ribeiro et al. prepared HDESs composed of DL-menthol and some naturally occurring acids (2-oxopropanoic acid, ethanoic acid, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid) with very low viscosities (5–100 cP).148 Using the hydrophobic nature of the prepared DESs, they were successfully used for the extraction of various biomolecules such as caffeine, tryptophan, isophthalic acid, and vanillin. Later in 2018, Cao and coworkers introduced a two-phase system (developed using hydrophilic and hydrophobic DESs) for the extraction of bioactive materials with various polarities.149 Ginkgo biloba leaves was chosen as the plant material containing several bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and terpenes with different polarities. Bioactive compounds such as polyprenyl acetates (PPAs), trilactones (TTLs), flavonoids, procyanidine (PAC), and terpenes were extracted by tailoring a two-phase system using two hydrophilic DESs and one hydrophobic DES in the volume ratio of 35:5:40. During the extraction process, the flavonoids, trilactones (TTLs), and procyanidine (PAC) were enriched into the hydrophilic phase, whereas, polyprenyl acetates (PPAs) moved in to the hydrophobic phase. HDESs were also used for the extraction of ciprofloxacin from water,150 tetracycline from milk samples,151 riboflavin from water,152 and artemisinin (drug for malaria) from Artemisia annua leaves.122
7.5 Other applications of HDESs
DESs are used in many other applications; one of them is the capture of various gases. The release of certain gases such as CO2, sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), H2S, and NH3 to the environment will make a negative impact on human health and the environment. Many hydrophilic deep eutectic solvents were previously used for CO2 capture but they absorbed a large amount of water during the process and this made high energy consumption in the CO2 desorption process.153,154 Thus, researchers were forced to think about hydrophobic DESs, which has shown great potential as absorbents of various gases and they can replace conventional volatile solvents, hazardous byproducts, etc. In 2018, for the first time, Zubeir et al. studied the solubility of carbon dioxide in hydrophobic DESs composed of decanoic acid and various quaternary ammonium salts. The solubility of CO2 in HDES was increased with increasing alkyl chain length.155 Later in 2020, Gu and co-workers successfully prepared HDES formed from polyamine hydrochloride and thymol, and was used for CO2 capture even at low partial pressures.154 Some therapeutic activities were also observed for HDES. HDESs composed of menthol and various carboxylic acids (dodecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, and tetradecanoic acid) at different molar ratios were investigated with wound healing abilities.156 The activity of HDESs was investigated in the synthesis of aldol157 and glucose monodecanoate.158
8. Applications of hydrophilic DESs in various organic reactions
Even though the DESs were introduced recently, they were applied in distinct and different fields of chemistry. These include analytical chemistry,159 nanotechnology,160 biotechnology & bioengineering,161 electrochemistry,162 and polymer chemistry.101,163,164 They are used for CO2 capture,165 biodiesel production,166 oil recovery,167 food analysis,168 metal processing,9 extraction,169 environmental analysis,170 catalysis,171,172etc. Among these, catalysis is an important application, where DES acts as a catalyst or a solvent or both. Applications of DES as catalysts/solvents for various organic transformations are discussed in this section (from 2018 onward).
8.1 DES as solvent for organic reactions
Various DESs were reported as effective solvents for various reactions, especially coupling reactions. DES formed from ChCl/glycerol (1:2) was found to be an efficient green medium for Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction using (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br, I) and mono/bifunctional potassium aryltrifluoroborates employing Na2CO3 as the base at 60 °C.173 The scope of the reaction was explored by repeating the reaction using a variety of aryl halides and arylboronic acids; biaryls and terphenyl derivatives were furnished with good yields. Pd(OAc)2, DES, and Na2CO3 were successfully recycled and reused up to six runs; the reaction is given in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of biaryls and terphenyls via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. 
In 2019, Saavedra et al. reported a pre-catalyst based on bipyridine-palladium derivative for various coupling reactions in environment-friendly eutectic mixtures.174 The efficiency of the catalyst in different eutectic mixtures was checked for various coupling reactions (Hiyama, Suzuki–Miyaura, Heck–Mizoroki, and Sonogashira). Among these, ChCl–glycerol (1:2 ratio) was found to be an efficient reaction medium for palladium-catalyzed Hiyama coupling reaction using NaHCO3 as base at 100 °C. ChCl–ethylelne glycol at 1:2 ratio was found to be a better reaction medium for both Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction and Heck–Mizoroki coupling reaction using the same palladium-based catalyst. Ph3PMeBr:glycerol (1:2) was found to be an efficient medium for the Sonogashira coupling reaction using the palladium-based catalyst. Other reaction conditions and substrate scope were evaluated. The palladium catalyst and DESs were recycled and reused and the coupling reactions are given in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Various coupling reactions in DES using bipyridine-palladium catalyst. 
N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)–Pd complex in combination with DES was found to be an interesting catalyst for various coupling reactions.175
Similar to the previous case, the activity was different when various DESs were used. The reaction conditions were optimized and the substrate scope was evaluated. The method allowed to accomplish the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction at room temperature. Reactions are given in Scheme 3.
 Scheme 3  NHC–Pd complex catalyzed coupling reactions using DES. 
Another report based on DES-mediated coupling reaction was in 2020, where poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were used as the catalyst.176 Glycerol-derived DES was found to be a green reaction medium for the palladium nanoparticle (Pd-NP)-catalyzed Heck–Mizoroki coupling reaction. DES was prepared by mixing ammonium salts with the glyceryl monoether in a 1:2 molar ratio and stirred under argon at 70 °C for 10 h until a homogeneous colorless liquid was obtained. In this reaction, the influence of the various glycerol derived eutectic solvents was studied for palladium NP catalyzed Heck–Mizoroki coupling reaction between n-butyl acrylate and iodobenzene. Among these, glycerol ethers and their eutectic mixtures with two ammonium salts were found to be more efficient as the medium for the coupling reaction. The reaction and the conditions are given in Scheme 4.
 Scheme 4  Heck–Mizoroki coupling reaction in glycerol-based eutectic solvent. 
The ChCl/glycerol eutectic mixture was also used as an environment-friendly medium for the Sonogashira coupling reaction using commercially available Pd/C in the absence of external ligands.177 The reaction was performed under heterogeneous conditions using (hetero)aryl iodides coupled with both aromatic/aliphatic alkynes at 60 °C. The system was found to be effective for electron-rich iodides, which were generally less reactive. Both the DES and the palladium catalyst were successfully recycled and the reaction is given in Scheme 5.
 Scheme 5  Sonogashira coupling reaction using DES. 
DES was found to be an efficient medium for the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction.178 The catalyst used was Fe3O4/GO@CL-Pd, which was a hydrophilic and magnetically-separable Pd catalyst. Its synthesis mainly involved three steps. The first step was the preparation of azide-functionalized Fe3O4/GO (Fe3O4/GO@N3), followed by the preparation of the alkyne-functionalized cellulose. In the second step, the preparation of cellulose-modified Fe3O4/GO (Fe3O4/GO@CL) took place via a click reaction and the finally immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on Fe3O4/GO@CL. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic DESs were applied as a green reaction media for the synthesis of biphenyls from various aryl boronic acids and aryl halides. Among these, higher activity was observed for hydrophilic DESs compared to hydrophobic DESs. It may be due to the better dispersion of the palladium-based catalyst in hydrophilic DESs compared to the hydrophobic one. Higher efficiency was observed using hydrophilic DES corresponding to dimethylammonium chloride and glycerol in 1:2 ratio. Both the catalyst and DES were recycled and reused up to five runs; the reaction is given in Scheme 6.
 Scheme 6  Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in DES. 
DES was also used as an efficient medium for C–N Ullmann coupling reaction catalyzed by copper nanoparticle-modified carboxamide-functionalized magnetic graphene oxide.179 The use of DES (ChCl–glycerol based DES) instead of toxic solvents such as toluene, DMF, and DMSO made the process more sustainable. Both the copper-based nanocomposite and DES were recycled and reused up to five cycles. The reaction is given in Scheme 7.
 Scheme 7  C–N Ullmann coupling reaction using DES. 
DES formed from ChCl and glycerol was used as an efficient reaction medium for the palladium catalyzed aminocarbonylation of (hetero)aryl iodide under mild reaction conditions (60 °C).180 The scope of this method was analyzed by repeating the experiment using various aryl iodides and amines, and both the catalyst and DES were recycled and reused up to five cycles; the reaction is given in Scheme 8.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of amides using DES. 
In 2019, Xiong and coworkers used a unique combination of DES and supramolecular catalyst for the synthesis of 2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyrans and 1,4-dihydropyridines.181 The DES formed from ChCl–urea acted as a green reaction medium and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) as the catalyst. The generality of the protocol was established using various reactants. The catalyst-solvent system was recycled and reused without a noticeable loss in its activity; the reactions are given in Scheme 9.

8.2 DES as catalyst/solvent for organic reactions
The dual role of DES as the catalyst as well as the reaction medium was observed in many organic reactions. In 2019, Tran et al. prepared Type IV DES formed from zinc chloride and ethylene glycol at 1:4 molar ratio.182 The DES was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and using various spectroscopic methods (NMR, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy). The system was successfully used for the C2-arylation of benzoxazoles, benzothiazole, and benzimidazole using various aromatic aldehydes under organic solvent free condition at 120–140 °C. The method gave the desired product using benzoxazoles/benzothiazole in high yield. However, the expected product formation was not observed using benzimidazole. The effect was explained on the basis of the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the NH of benzimidazole and DES, and the reaction is given in Scheme 10.
 Scheme 10  Arylation of benzoxazoles, benzothiazole, and benzimidazole using DES. 
In 2018, Inaloo et al. used a combination of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and DES (ChCl: Zinc(II) chloride) for the synthesis of primary carbamates and mono-substituted urea, where DES played a dual role as the catalyst and the reaction medium.183 Both the reactions were performed under the same reaction conditions (10 mol% MNP-Fe3O4 in 3 mL of [ChCl][ZnCl]2/130 °C/6 h). Compared to previous methods, this eutectic mixture using ferrofluids was found to be an efficient and green method for the synthesis of primary carbamates and monosubstituted ureas with good to excellent yields. Both the nanoparticles and the DES were reused several times without a significant loss in their activity and the reactions are given in Scheme 11.
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of primary carbamates and monosubstituted ureas. 
The activity of various ChCl-based DESs (ChCl with urea/oxalic acid/mandelic acid/ZnCl2/FeCl3/SnCl2) and sugar-based DES (fructose:urea) were checked for the convenient synthesis of 2-amino-4H chromen-4-ylphosphonates.184 The synthesis involved the domino reaction of salicylaldehyde, ethylcyanoacetate/malononitrile, and diethyl phosphite at 80 °C. The DES formed from ChCl:urea (at 1:2 ratio) was found to be a convenient one with dual role. The generality of the protocol was established using various derivatives of the aldehyde, active methylene compounds, and dialkylphosphite. After the reaction, DES was recycled and reused; the reaction is given in Scheme 12.
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of 2-amino-4H chromen-4-ylphosphonates using DES. 
In 2018, Wu et al. used DES formed from ChCl and PEG (PEG200, PEG400, PEG600, and PEG1000) as the catalyst for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with propylene oxide.185 The reaction was performed under organic solvent-free conditions and yielded the cyclic carbonates. The chloride ion of ChCl and the chain length of PEG were found to have an important role in the reaction. Higher product yield was observed using the ChCl/PEG200 system and the product yield was reduced with increasing chain length of PEG from PEG200 to PEG1000. This might be probably due to the mass-transport limitation with increasing chain length. The reaction condition was optimized to be 150 °C with a CO2 pressure of 0.8 MPa for about 5 h and the reaction was repeated using various epoxides. After the completion of the reaction, DES was recycled and reused for up to five cycles; the reaction is given in Scheme 13.
 Scheme 13  Synthesis of cyclic carbonates from the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with propylene oxide using DES. 
Bhosle et al. used ChCl:Urea DES for the synthesis of N-substituted decahydroacridine-1,8-diones by the reaction of various aromatic amines, aldehydes, and dimedone.186 Various parameters such as reaction time, temperature, and effect of solvent were studied. It was concluded that the reaction was completed with excellent efficiency within 30 min at 80 °C using 5 mL of DES under organic solvent-free conditions. The generality of the protocol was established by repeating the experiment using various aldehydes and amines. The catalyst was recycled up to three cycles without a significant loss in its activity and the reaction is given in Scheme 14.
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of N-substituted decahydroacridine-1,8-diones using DES. 
Friedel–Crafts acylation is an important method to prepare pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates. Thus, a greener catalytic process for this particular reaction is always an attractive topic. Jin et al. prepared six DESs (using ChCl/benzyltrimethylammonium chloride/triethylamine borane as HBAs and ZnCl2/trifluoromethanesulfonic acid/p-toluenesulfonic acid as hydrogen bond donors).187 The activity of the six DESs were compared in the Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction and ([ChCl][ZnCl2]2) was the superior catalyst among them at 70 °C under organic solvent-free conditions. After the reaction, the catalyst was recovered and reused up to five cycles. The reaction is given in Scheme 15.
 Scheme 15  Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction using DES. 
In 2018, Radfar et al. used a basic DES composed of Glycerol-K2CO3 for the synthesis of thioamides via the Willgerodt–Kindler Reaction.188 Willgerodt–Kindler Reaction is an important reaction for the synthesis of thioamides due to the biological, industrial, and synthetic importance of these products. Appreciable yields were obtained using various secondary cyclic or acyclic amines and acetophenones. The optimum temperature and time required for various substrates were 80 °C to 100 °C for 30 min to 5 h and the model reaction is given in Scheme 16.
 Scheme 16  Thioamidation reaction using basic DES. 
Due to the wide analytical and biological applications of pyrazoles, their synthesis has found some attraction. DES formed from ChCl and tartaric acid was found to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of 4,4-(arylmethylene)-bis(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ol)s by the condensation of ethyl acetoacetate, phenyl hydrazine, and benzaldehyde at RT.189 The synthesis involved the Knorr pyrazole synthesis, which was followed by Knoevenagel–Michael addition reaction using water as the solvent. The generality of the method was studied using various aldehydes and DES was reused up to five cycles; the reaction is given in Scheme 17.
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of 4,4′-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ol)s using DES. 
Tipale et al. used ChCl:urea DES as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of pyrazolopyranopyrimidines.190 These heterocyclic moieties have a wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. Their synthesis involved four component reactions of an aldehyde, hydrazine hydrate, barbituric acid, and ethyl acetoacetate at 80 °C using ethanol as an solvent for about an hour. The scope of substrates in the reaction was checked using various aldehydes, diketones, and hydrazines, and the DES was recycled and reused; the reaction is given in Scheme 18.
 Scheme 18  Synthesis of pyrazolopyranopyrimidines using DES as the catalyst. 
DES formed from L-proline and oxalic acid was found to be a green catalyst for the synthesis of pyrazole derivatives. The synthesis of 4,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carbonitrile was achieved by refluxing aldehyde, 3-oxopropanenitrile, and 1H-pyrazol-5-amine and DES (L-proline and oxalic acid) using ethanol as the solvent.191 The synthesis of bis(4,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carbonitrile) derivatives was achieved by refluxing dicarbaldehyde, 3-oxopropanenitrile, and 1H-pyrazol-5-amine at 1:2:2 ratio for about 1.5 h under the same reaction conditions. The method was tolerated well over wide varieties of aldehydes and 3-oxopropanenitriles in good to excellent yields. DES was recovered and reused over five cycles and the reactions are given in Scheme 19.
 Scheme 19  Synthesis of pyrazole derivatives using DES. 
DES formed from three components (ChCl, urea, and thiourea at 1:1:1 ratio) was found to be a green catalyst for the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and pyrano[2,3-d] pyrimidinone (thione) derivatives.192 These heterocyclic scaffolds have various useful biological and pharmacological activities. The synthesis involved the three-component reaction between malononitrile, aldehydes, and dimedone or (thio)barbituric acid. Higher yield and purity were observed for all the substrates and the catalyst was recycled and reused up to four cycles; the reaction is given in Scheme 20.

The strategy of using DESs was applied for the synthesis of 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones via the one-pot three component cyclization reaction of aniline, aldehyde, and thioglycolic acid.193 The reaction was performed using various ChCl-based DESs, in which ChCl:glycerol at 1:2 ratio was found to be the efficient one. The method was explored using various aldehydes and amines at 85 °C, and the catalyst was recycled and reused up to five runs; the reaction is given in Scheme 21.
 Scheme 21  DES-catalyzed synthesis of 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones. 
Another interesting work based on DES was reported by Kamble et al. They used a unique blend of concentrated solar radiation (CSR) and DES for the synthesis of 2,4,6-triaryl pyridine.194 Pyridine derivatives possess various biological activities. The reaction was performed between benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and NH4OAc in the presence of various ChCl-based DES. Among these, ChCl:malonic acid DES with concentrated solar radiation (CSR) was found to be the best condition for heating in terms of time and energy conservation compared to the conventional thermal method. DES used in the present case played a dual role of a catalyst and a reaction medium; the reaction is given in Scheme 22.

Three kinds of oxalic acid-based DESs were used for the oxidation of furfural to maleic acid and fumaric acid in the presence of H2O2 (as an oxidizer).195 Among these, DES derived from oxalic acid and ChCl was found to be an efficient acid catalyst and a solvent for the reaction at low temperature (50–60 °C). The reaction is given in Scheme 23.

In 2020, Ballarotto and coworkers studied the dual activity of various acidic DESs for the conjugate aza-Michael addition of amines to 2-vinylpyridine without using any additional acid additives.199 This is an important C–N bond forming reaction and was very useful for the synthesis of pharmaceutically-important compounds. Both Brønsted acidic and Lewis acidic DESs were used for the reaction. In the case of Brønsted acidic DES, the acidity of the components played a major role and higher efficiency was observed for weak carboxylic acids. Higher efficiency was observed using mixtures composed of 2-chlorobenzoic acid/3-chlorobenzoic acid and trimethylglycine. DES composed of Lewis acidic constituents (ZnCl2, SnCl2, and AlCl3) were also used well with excellent efficiency and the reaction is given in Scheme 27.

Another interesting work based on DES was reported by Nguyen et al. in 2020.200 The authors developed magnetic nanoparticle-supported [Urea]4[ZnCl2] DES and was successfully used as a catalyst for the multicomponent synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indoles. Two steps were involved in the synthesis of the catalyst; the first step involved the synthesis of silica-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@-SiO2@(CH2)3Cl) and DES ([Urea]4[ZnCl2]). In the second step, vigorous mixing of the nanoparticle and the DES was performed at 100 °C for 18 h. The prepared DES@MNP was collected by an external magnet, purified, and analyzed by various techniques including Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, VSM, XRD, EDX, TGA, and ICP-MS. The system was successfully used as a catalyst for the synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indoles via the multicomponent reaction of indole, acetophenone, and elemental sulfur power at 140 °C for 12 h. The reaction was repeated using various ketones and indoles, and the corresponding thieno[2,3-b]indoles were synthesized with high efficiency; the reaction is given in Scheme 28.
 Scheme 28  Multicomponent synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indoles using DES@MNP. 
The magnetic nanoparticle-supported Lewis acidic DES was also used as a catalyst for the multicomponent synthesis of 2,4,5-trisubstituted and 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles under solvent-free sonication.201 The magnetic separation of the catalyst was achieved without any loss in the activity, and the reaction is given in Scheme 29.

In 2020, Srivastava reported a bio-renewable DES composed of ChCl and polyethylene glycol (ChCl/PEG200 in 1:2 ratio) with notable activity for the synthesis of various bis-enol derivatives within 15 min at 80 °C.202 This involved Knoevenegal condensation followed by Michael addition of an aldehyde and active methylene compound at 1:2 ratio. Higher efficiency was observed using PEG200 and a decrease in the product yield was observed with increasing chain length from PEG200 to PEG1000. Various active methylene compounds (including acetyl acetone, dimedone, 4-hydroxycoumarin, and 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one) were used to furnish the corresponding bis-enol derivatives at the optimum conditions. These include bisacetyl acetones, tetraketones, biscoumarins, and arylbispyranylmethanes. Wide varieties of aldehydes were reacted with these active methylene compounds with excellent efficiency. A model reaction for the synthesis of biscoumarin is given in Scheme 30.

ChCl and zinc chloride-based DES was used for the synthesis of 3-substituted indoles via three-component reaction of aromatic aldehydes, active methylene compounds, and indoles under mild reaction conditions.203 The reaction was tolerated well with various substrates without any additives and the catalyst was recycled and reused; the reaction is given in Scheme 31.
 Scheme 31  DES-catalyzed synthesis of 3-substituted indoles. 
Another interesting work based on this neoteric solvent involved the development of a DES based nano-photocatalyst (n-TiO2-P25@TDI@DES) and its application in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.204n-TiO2-P25@TDI was synthesized and was added to the DES (ZnCl2–urea at 1:4 ratio), stirred at 100 °C for 18 h, and the powder obtained was washed with ethanol and dried. This photocatalyst was used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols and the reaction is given in Scheme 32.

The strategy of using DES was applied for the synthesis of 3-substituted indoles via the multicomponent reaction of malononitrile, aromatic aldehyde, and indole under ultrasonic irradiation.205 3-Substituted indoles are important building blocks for organic synthesis. DESs composed of ChCl in combination with various HBDs (urea, glucose, glycerol, oxalic acid, and succinic acid) were prepared and their activity was checked for the reaction. The expected product with higher efficiency was observed using ChCl and urea at 1:2 ratio and this may be due to the mild basicity of the DES. The reaction condition was tolerated well with various aldehydes and the reaction is given in Scheme 33.

Very recently in 2021, Lewis acidic DES composed of ChCl and zinc chloride ([ChCl][ZnCl2]3) was used as the catalyst for the synthesis of 1-amidoalkyl naphthols and polyhydroquinolines.206 The synthesis of 1-amidoalkyl naphthols included the multicomponent reaction of 2-naphthol, aldehydes, and amides in the presence of DES at 100 °C. Similarly, the synthesis of polyhydroquinolines involved the three-component reaction of various aldehydes, dimedone, and ethyl acetoacetate under the same reaction conditions. Various aldehydes reacted well with excellent efficiency and the DES was recycled and reused; the reactions are given in Scheme 34.

One NADES was prepared by Khoshdel et al. from amino acids and ChCl.207 During the formation of DES, amino acids can act as convenient HBDs. In the present work, NADES composed of ChCl and gabapentin (γ-amino acid) was prepared and characterized by FT-IR, NMR (1H and 13C), and mass spectroscopy. DES was successfully used as the catalyst for the synthesis of 4H-pyran scaffolds via the multicomponent reaction of aldehyde, malononitrile, and other active methylene compounds (including 1,3-cyclohexadione, dimedone, and thiobarbituric acid) at 70 °C. Various aldehydes were used under these conditions and the NADES was recycled and reused. A model reaction is given in Scheme 35.

Type IV DESs were reported based on ZrOCl2·8H2O in combination with urea, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.70 The physicochemical properties such as freezing point, density, viscosity, thermal stability, solvation properties, and acidity of the DESs were successfully studied. The catalytic activity of the three DESs were compared for the synthesis of pyrrols via Paal–Knorr reaction using 2,5-hexanedione and various amines at room temperature. Among the three DES, DES 1 (a combination of ZrOCl2·8H2O and urea at 1:5 ratio) was found to be the best catalyst, and the reaction is given in Scheme 36.

Later, a similar work was reported by preparing four Type IV DESs based on CeCl3·7H2O in combination with urea, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and lactic acid with the study of their physicochemical properties.71 The activity of the DESs were compared for the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated diketones and dicyano compounds via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction using various aldehydes and dimedone/malononitrile at room temperature. DES 4 (a combination of ZrOCl2·8H2O and Urea at 1:5 ratio) was found to be the efficient catalyst among the four and both reactions (reactions (1) and (2)) are given in Scheme 37.
 Scheme 37  Reaction of aldehyde with dimedone/malononitrile using DES. 
A study was performed to investigate the correlation between the physicochemical properties and the catalytic activity of Type IV DESs (ZrOCl2·8H2O/CeCl3·7H2O in combination with various HBDs) for the synthesis of α-aminophosphonates.208 This involved the one-pot multicomponent reaction of an aldehyde, dimethylphosphite, and amine (Kabachnik-Fields/Phospha-Mannich reaction) at room temperature in the presence of various DES systems. Among these, DES 1 (ZrOCl2·8H2O-urea at 1:5 ratio) had lower density, viscosity, higher acidity, and this system was found to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of α-aminophosphonates. The lower density and viscosity of DES 1 favored its activity as a solvent. Similarly, higher acidity favored its activity as a catalyst; the reaction is given in Scheme 38.
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of α-aminophosphonates using DES. 
The higher acidity and lower viscosity of DES 1 was also favorable for its activity as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazoles at room temperature (Scheme 39).209 This method showed interesting characteristics such as the easy preparation of the catalyst, high product yield, simple reaction procedure, and the reusability of the catalyst.

The further applicability of these DESs were checked for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxooctahydroxanthenes by the reaction of various aldehydes and dimedone (1:2 ratio) at room temperature.210 Here, the expected product with higher efficiency was observed using DES 2 (ZrOCl2·8H2O:ethylene glycol at 1:2 ratio). A mixture of both Knoevenagel product and xanthene derivative was observed in the presence of highly acidic DES 1. This indicated that the activity of DES 2 was based on the hydrogen bonding ability of the catalyst and not on the basis of the acidity. The substrate scope of the reaction was studied using various aldehydes and the catalyst was recovered and reused; the reaction is given in Scheme 40.

The suitability of these systems for dihydropyridine synthesis was also studied via the Hantzsch reaction at room temperature.211 This involved the multicomponent reaction of the aldehyde, two equivalents of ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate (symmetric Hantzsch pyridine synthesis). Using DES 1 and DES 4 (ZrOCl2·8H2O/CeCl3·7H2O in combination with urea at 1:5 ratio), a mixture of both dihydropyridine and dihydropyrimidinone was observed. This was due to the presence of urea in these catalytic systems, which interfered with the reaction. Thus, these systems were avoided in further studies and the expected product with higher yield was observed using DES 2 (ZrOCl2·8H2O:ethylene glycol at 1:2 ratio). The higher activity of DES 2 might be due to the lower viscosity and strong hydrogen bonding ability compared to the others. The system was further optimized and was used for the study of the scope of substrates and was recovered and reused. The model reaction is given in Scheme 41.
 Scheme 41  Hantzsch pyridine synthesis using DES. 
During the Hantzsch reaction, a mixture of both 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones (Biginelli product) and 1,4-dihydropyridines (Hantzsch product) was observed in the presence of DES 1 and DES 4 for some derivatives of aldehydes.212 Based on this observation, it was further decided to synthesize 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones via the Biginelli reaction. DES 1 and DES 4 were avoided in these studies to avoid the mixing of products and the catalytic activities of the remaining DESs were checked. This one-pot multi-component reaction was performed between ethyl acetoacetate, urea/thiourea, and various aldehydes at room temperature (Scheme 42). Among the DESs, excellent conversion was observed using DES 2 (ZrOCl2·8H2O with ethylene glycol in 1:2 ratio). This might be due to the strong hydrogen bonding ability and lower viscosity of DES 2 compared to the others. Good to excellent yield was observed for all the aldehydes; the products were analyzed by various methods (TLC, GCMS, NMR, and melting point measurements). In order to examine the stability, reactivity, and other structural parameters, various electronic and global reactivity parameters of the products were calculated and the catalyst was reused up to four cycles.

Recently, ammonium acetate (HBA) and ethylene glycol (HBD)-based DES were reported with the study of their physicochemical properties such as density, viscosity, thermal stability, and acidity.213 This system was used as a catalyst for the synthesis of nitroalkenes via the microwave-assisted Henry reaction under organic solvent-free condition (Scheme 43). The easy preparation, low-cost of the starting materials, short reaction time, recyclability of the catalyst, etc., make the present catalyst more attractive.

8.3 Eutectogels as catalytic systems for organic reactions
In order to make an effective use of a green solvent, attempts can be made to prepare a gel with special properties by gelation.214 Eutectogels are soft materials resembling DES, formed by gelling natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs), which may be closer to the intracellular environment than pure water. This can overcome most of the drawbacks associated with gel materials such as hydrogels, organogels, and ionic liquids (ILs) gels.215 ChCl is the most extensively used hydrogen bond acceptor for the preparation of eutectogel. Polyhydric alcohols and polyacids are extensively used hydrogen bond donors.215 Saavedra et al. prepared natural eutectogels by combining the properties of amino acids with that of DES.216 Various DESs were used and among these, the amino acids used were able to gel with DES composed of ChCl and urea (1:2). The soft materials obtained were characterized to determine their thermal stability, rheological properties, and morphological features. These soft materials were used as catalytic reaction media to promote C–C bond formation reaction such as the enantioselective aldol reaction.216 Among the tested materials, the L-proline/ChCl/Urea eutectogel was the one exhibiting the best catalytic performance with excellent yield and good enantiomeric excess. From the environmental point-of-view, the method presented various advantages such as a simple and recyclable method, renewable components, and lower reagent loadings. The catalyst systems based on eutectogels are in their infancy and eutectogels will open up new avenues to carry out enantioselective organic reactions in a totally eco-friendly manner.
9. Challenges and future perspectives of DES
In spite of the undeniable advantages, DES has significant drawbacks, related to its high viscosity, storage, lack of fundamental model, etc. Even if the preparation methods of DESs are simple, the mixtures obtained are hygroscopic in nature. The water content of the melt plays a good role in the change in the various physicochemical properties such as surface tension, viscosity, refractive index, and density. Hence, after the preparation, DESs may be stored in a desiccator. Another drawback associated with DESs was the unusually high viscosity, which was related to other physicochemical properties such as various transport properties and conductivity.217 To some extent, this problem can be solved by adding a suitable quantity of water, i.e., the addition of water at a low level did not disrupt the DES structure, as explained in Section 6.1.8. Despite its enormous interest in the application point-of-view, there is no clear information about the fundamental models of DESs. Because of this, nearly all other issues noted can be folded into this grand problem, and this is especially true for viscosity.217,218 Researchers are also confused with some fundamental questions and the definition of deep eutectic solvents. This includes the magnitude of the depression of the melting point of the mixture compared to those of the pure compounds, and the role of water in DES formation and stability. However, we may expect that researchers will find suitable answers for all these questions in the near future.
10. Conclusion
The present review has revealed the interest of researchers on deep eutectic solvents since their first description. History, classification, recent developments, and some important catalytic applications (over the last three years) are incorporated in this review. DESs are formed by the self-association of constituents via hydrogen bonding interactions. Various physicochemical properties can be tuned by adjusting the constituents and their ratios. Moreover, these neoteric solvents are biodegradable, less toxic, have low cost, non-volatile nature, etc. Many of the DESs reported can act as catalysts or solvents or both and are viable alternatives to many existing methods. Hence, their catalytic applications have received considerable attention as they can replace many volatile organic solvents. The major drawbacks associated with deep eutectic solvents are their high viscosity, which is mainly due to the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the constituents, which could significantly influence the solvent properties of DESs. To some extent, this problem can be solved by adding water as a co-solvent, which will decrease the properties such as melting point, density, and viscosity of DES. It was also reported that the addition of small amounts of water could strengthen the DES structure by contributing to the hydrogen-bonding network. Wide varieties of applications are available in the literature to indicate the potential of deep eutectic solvents. The future offers various combinations of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors to further increase their applicability.
