    , Accepted 9th July 2017First published on 10th July 2017AbstractOxygen reduction and evolution reactions are of immense importance in electrochemical conversion/storage devices like regenerative/alcohol/hydrogen based fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Here, a rational facile synthesis methodology has been developed to design N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Fe–Fe3C nanostructures co-embedded in B-doped mesoporous carbon nanostructures (BFNCNTs) as a noble metal-free superior bi-functional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. The incorporation of N and B with negligible/undetectable B–N formation and Fe–Fe3C nanostructures leads to the superior performance by introducing plenty of defects, local heterogeneity and a high specific surface area (∼272 m2 g−1). Besides, mesoporous boron-doped carbon acts as a host material for NCNTs and Fe–Fe3C, and it offers good connectivity as well as a protective coating for durable catalysis. Remarkably, more positive onset (−30 mV) and half-wave potentials (−225 mV) with ∼94% current retention under accelerated stability test and fuel tolerance for the ORR, in combination with lower onset (422 mV) and Ej=10(OER) (562 mV) potentials with high current density (190 mA cm−2 @ 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for the OER as compared to commercial state-of-the-art electrocatalysts suggest superior bifunctional behavior of BFNCNTs. The complete oxygen electrochemical activity ΔE = Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.788 V for BFNCNTs is lower than recently reported various state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Besides, a prototype battery fabrication using BFNCNTs as the cathode electrode for driving a light emitting diode has been demonstrated. Overall, BFNCNTs have potential to serve as a non-precious electrocatalyst for electrochemical energy devices.
Introduction
Electro-reduction of oxygen besides the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical conversion/storage devices like regenerative/hydrogen/alcohol based fuel cells and metal air batteries plays a pivotal role in deciding their operational efficiency.1–6 The large over potential and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics due to the involvement of the multi electron transfer process (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−, alkaline media) requires a catalyst to facilitate the ORR.7 Traditionally, Pt-/Pd-based mono-/multi-component novel metal nanostructures are well-studied as electro-catalysts for the ORR.8–13 However, the potential driven leaching of metals, agglomeration due to high surface energy and aggressive experimental conditions with limited availability accompanied by high price limit the commercial adoption of these materials in electrochemical devices.12 In an attempt to address these issues, hetero-atom doped/co-doped carbon nanostructures (CNSs) have recently emerged as a potential class of electro-catalysts for the ORR in alkaline media.14–39 The presence of hetero-atoms with different atomic sizes and electronegativities introduces the structural defects and electronic polarization that drive the doped CNS electrochemically active for the ORR.24–26,29 In this regard, N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have shown potential for the ORR as a Pt-free catalyst.22,24–26,30–32 Interestingly, the co-doping further offers the enhanced ORR activity by synergistic effects.24–26,28–32,40 The recent study on the volcano-shaped relationship between ORR activity and binding energies of ORR intermediates for various hetero-atom doped graphene-based electrocatalysts suggests that N-/B-doped graphene-based electrocatalysts have moderate binding energies of ORR intermediates and thus may offer better ORR activity over S-/P-/O-doped CNSs.25 However, in the boron (B) and nitrogen (N) co-doped CNS, the B–N bond formations are highly probable which are electrochemically inactive due to the neutralization effect and does not contribute significantly in the ORR process.24 The effect of B–N co-doping on the electronic transport study suggests that the bonded B–N species are transparent to the conduction electrons of carbon nanotubes.26 As a result, the bonded B–N species hardly contribute to the activation/conjugation of carbon π electrons. Therefore, B and N co-doping with least/negligible B–N species formation or effective B and N separation in order to prevent the neutralization effect for the efficient utilization of these co-doped heteroatoms is the essential requirement for the electro-reduction of oxygen by the B and N co-doped CNS. Besides, these heteroatoms in the CNS with the presence of iron moieties further promote the ORR process and support the 4e− ORR pathways as the presence of iron incorporates additional ORR active centres in the form of Fe–NxC complexes as well as through Fe–Fe3C centres.35–38
Likewise, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an electrochemical reaction of immense importance (4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−, alkaline media) and equally complex in nature.3–5,34 In this context, it is worthy to note that ORR and OER reactions collectively play a decisive role in regenerative fuel cells and metal air batteries. Literature surveys suggest that oxides and compounds of some noble metals (specially, Ir and Ru) as well as iron-based catalysts like FeNi are well suited for the OER but not promising for the ORR.41–44 Moreover, these precious metal (Ir and Ru) based oxide electrocatalysts for the OER are unstable under high anodic potentials cause dissolution and leaching of these catalysts.4,5 Similarly, Pt-based materials which are widely considered as the state-of-the-art ORR catalysts exhibit inferior performance towards the OER and suffer serious stability issues.41,44–46 Recently, bi-functional catalysts have drawn considerable interest that can overcome the cycling loss during charging and discharging process in rechargeable metal–air batteries.3–5 In this regard, a cost effective, noble metal-free, efficient and robust catalyst for the ORR and OER is of paramount importance, and the quest is to develop bi-functional robust electrocatalysts. Recently, iron–iron carbide (Fe/Fe3C) carbon nano-composites have shown their potential as an efficient ORR electro-catalyst which unveils the usefulness of iron incorporation in CNSs.20,21,47–49 They also offer a good OER electrocatalytic activity.48,49 As both NCNTs and Fe/Fe3C nanostructures can be used for the ORR and OER, we intend to design NCNTs and Fe/Fe3C nanostructures co-embedded in B-doped mesoporous carbon (BFNCNTs) in an attempt to make defect enriched heterogeneous nanoelectrocatalysts in order to assimilate the individual active behaviour and explore the maximum possible electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR and OER in alkaline media.
In this regard, we have made an effort to integrate the efficacy of B and N co-doping in CNSs with maximum possible separation of B and N species by sequential pyrolysis of ferrocene–melamine followed by ferrocene–triphenyl borane (TPB) to obtain nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and Fe–Fe3C nanostructures co-embedded in boron containing mesoporous carbon nanostructures (named BFNCNTs) as shown in Scheme 1 (Fig. S1†) and studied the ORR and OER bifunctional activities in alkaline media. In the present study, apart from being the host for NCNTs and Fe–Fe3C nanostructures, boron-doped mesoporous carbon provides good connectivity as well as a protective coating to NCNTs and Fe–Fe3C which enhances the operational durability. Furthermore, to elucidate the synergistic behaviour of boron & Fe–Fe3C containing carbon coated on NCNTs (BFNCNTs), we synthesized the boron-doped carbon coated NCNTs (named BNCNTs) and Fe–Fe3C containing carbon coated NCNTs (named FNCNTs) separately and subjected to the electrochemical study. Interestingly, the electrochemical activities of BFNCNTs are better than the commercially available state-of-the-art catalysts like Pt–C (20 wt% Pt loading for the ORR) and RuO2 (for the OER) under similar experimental conditions as well as superior to BNCNTs and FNCNTs. Furthermore, the accelerated stability test suggests ∼94% current retention in both the cases even after the 1000th cycle indicating good stability. Besides the electrochemical studies, in an attempt to study the viability for practical application of BFNCNTs as a cathode material, we fabricated a proto-type metal–air battery system using aluminium foil (a common house hold) as the anode material and BFNCNT coated carbon paper as the cathode material to power light emitting diodes.

Results and discussion
Structural characterization

Fig. 1a shows the representative SEM image of NCNTs obtained by the pyrolysis of melamine and ferrocene at 950 °C. TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1b and c) reveal the bamboo type tubular structure which is indicative of the nitrogen incorporation in the graphitic plane. The formation of the bamboo type structure (Fig. 1c) is attributed to the breaking of hexagonal symmetry in the graphitic plane resulting in the formation of pentagonal and heptagonal rings which promotes the compartment formation in the tubular structure.50,51 The representative SEM images of BFNCNTs obtained by the sequential pyrolysis of melamine–ferrocene (at 950 °C) and TPB–ferrocene (at 850 °C) at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 2a–e. The structural modification as compared to NCNTs (as shown in Fig. 1a) is noticeably observed. Moreover, the representative TEM images (Fig. 2f) reveal the co-embedded NCNTs and Fe–Fe3C nanostructure in the boron-doped CNS. The HRTEM image further ensures the encapsulation of the Fe–Fe3C species in the carbon layers of BFNCNTs (Fig. S2†). Fig. S3† shows the representative SEM images of FNCNTs and BNCNTs, obtained by the sequential pyrolysis of melamine–ferrocene (at 950 °C) followed by ferrocene/TPB (at 850 °C).

The XRD pattern of NCNTs (black line in Fig. 3a) shows the (002) graphitic peak around 26.3° along with peaks centred around 44.6 and 82.3° which can be attributed to the (110) and (211) planes of γ-Fe (JCPDS no. 870722).47 Moreover, the peaks around 37.5, 43.5 and 49° in NCNTs suggest the presence of the iron carbide phase (Fe3C) too.47,52 For BFNCNTs (red line in Fig. 3a), along with the peaks for NCNTs, the peaks around 39.57, 40.4, 42.6, 54, 57.8 and 77.6° are present which are also attributed to the Fe3C phase (JCPDS no. 851317). The XRD study suggests the co-existence of graphitic carbon, Fe and Fe3C in the BFNCNTs that is in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. S2†). The presence of Fe–Fe3C nanostructures in FNCNTs is also evident from Fig. S4.†46,47,52Fig. 3b shows the Raman spectra of BFNCNTs, FNCNTs, BNCNTs, NCNTs and pristine CNTs (prepared by the same method by pyrolysis of 2 ml of benzene and 20 mg of ferrocene at 950 °C for 3 h and included for comparison). The increment of the disorder peak intensity (ID) centred around 1340 cm−1 with respect to the graphitic peak intensity (IG) at ∼1575 cm−1 indicates the prominence of the surface defects in the carbon structure which may be attributed to the incorporation of heteroatoms.53 The ID/IG ratio, which gives an idea about the defects/disorderness present in the CNS, is found to be 0.76, 0.9, 1, 1.03 and 1.7 for CNTs, NCNTs, BNCNTs, FNCNTs and BFNCNTs, respectively. This indicates that the BFNCNTs are defect-enriched as compared to FNCNTs and BNCNTs. Furthermore, this advocates the need of TPB and ferrocene together in the sequential pyrolysis method as defect-enriched CNSs are well suited for electrochemical activities. Besides, the peaks (D & G) which were well separated in CNTs start overlapping with the introduction of heteroatoms suggest the presence of surface defects.53 Overall, Raman spectra provide valuable information about the presence of large amounts of surface defects in BFNCNTs as compared to NCNTs, FNCNTs, BNCNTs and CNTs.

Fig. 3c shows the XPS survey spectrum of BFNCNTs which comprises of boron (B) 1s, carbon (C) 1s, nitrogen (N) 1s, oxygen (O) 1s peaks with an iron (Fe) 2p peak (inset of Fig. 3c). Fig. 3d–f display the deconvoluted core spectra of B, C and N 1s. The deconvoluted core spectrum of B 1s comprises of peaks around 188.7, 189.8, 190.6, 191.2 and 192.8 eV which correspond to B–C3, BC2O, B–C, BCO2 and B–O moieties, respectively.24,54,55 The deconvoluted C 1s core spectrum indicates the presence of B–C (283.6 eV) & N–C (285.2 eV) moieties in addition to the characteristic peaks correspond to C–C sp2 (284.3 eV) and C–C sp3 (286.1 eV) carbon.24–26,34–39,50,54,55 Likewise, the deconvoluted core spectrum of N 1s comprises of peaks centred around 398.5, 399.3, 400.2 and 401.8 eV attributed to the pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic and oxide kind of nitrogen species.24–26,33–38,50,51 Interestingly, the absence of peaks around 191.2 and 398.2 eV (Fig. 3d and f) advocates the absence or undetectable amount of B–N moieties in the structure which promotes the possibility of maximum utilization of heteroatoms present in BFNCNTs towards electrochemical studies.24–26,56–58 Furthermore, the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen are beneficial for the ORR as Fe easily coordinates with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen to form Fe–Nx/C complexes which act as electrochemical active centres. The formation of Fe–Nx/C complexes is evident by the presence of the peak centred around 398.5 eV.16c The B/C and N/C ratios are found to be 0.022 and 0.03, respectively. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption process on BFNCNTs exhibit the type IV isotherm (Fig. 3g). The hysteresis loop in the range of 0.7 to 1 of P/Po confirms the strong capillary condensation and multilayer adsorption which advocates the presence of macro- & meso-porosity in the structure.30,59,60Fig. 3h shows the pore size distribution in the BFNCNTs as calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model which confirms the presence of macro- & meso-porosity in the structure. BFNCNTs exhibit the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of ∼272 m2 g−1 which is superior to various reported values for CNSs (Table S1†) and the pore volume of 0.258 cm3 g−1. The large specific surface area of BFNCNTs offers a high surface exposure of electro-catalytic active sites for the ORR/OER.3–5,30,59,60 At the same time, the wide pore size distribution as evident from Fig. 3h is conducive to deliver effective triple phase (solid–liquid–gas) regions necessary for oxygen electro-catalysis.60
Oxygen evolution study
In an attempt to appraise the electrochemical activity of BFNCNTs, we studied the OER response in alkaline media as the OER is one of the most important reactions, however, being complex in nature due to the involvement of multiple electron transfer, it experiences a high kinetic barrier to proceed at a useful rate and hence plays a decisive role in metal–air battery systems and sustainable hydrogen production (e.g. water splitting).3–5Fig. 4a comprises of the OER polarization LSV curves on BFNCNTs in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at different loadings of the BFNCNT electrocatalyst. With increase of loading, the OER current increases initially (till 750 μg cm−2) followed by a decrease in OER activity (for 1000 μg cm−2). This might be attributed to the limitations that arise in mass transport as the thickness of the catalyst film increased at a higher loading, thus hindering the efficient utilization of the bottom of the catalyst layer. This optimized loading is further used for electrochemical studies.

(b) Comparative OER study on BFNCNTs, FNCNTs, BNCNTs and RuO2 with a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 at an electrode rotation speed of 600 rpm in a nitrogen-saturated (1 M NaOH) alkaline medium.

(f) Tafel slope evaluation, (g and h) NaOH molar concentration dependent OER study on BFNCNTs and order of the OER evaluation, deduced from figure (g), respectively. 

Fig. 4b shows the OER polarization curves for BFNCNTs, FNCNTs, BNCNTs and commercially available RuO2 catalysts in nitrogen-saturated 1 M alkaline solution with a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 and at an electrode rotation speed of 600 rpm under identical experimental conditions. The observed onset potential (in this study Eonset is taken as the potential at 2 mA cm−2 of OER current density as shown in the inset of Fig. 4b) for BFNCNTs (∼423 mV) is much lower than that for FNCNTs (488 mV), BNCNTs (553 mV), and even to commercial RuO2 (454 mV). Interestingly BFNCNTs outperform FNCNTs, BNCNTs and RuO2 in terms of OER current densities and onset potential (Table 1). The current density at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is 190, 117.5, 83 and 40 mA cm−2 for BFNCNTs, FNCNTs, BNCNTs and RuO2, respectively. Furthermore, the potential value for the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10 mA cm−2, which is normally used to compare the OER activity and it represents the expected value for an efficient 10% solar water-splitting device under one sun illumination)30 is lower for BFNCNTs (561 mV) than that for FNCNTs (598 mV), BNCNTs (616 mV) and RuO2 (566 mV). Furthermore, in an attempt to understand the much improved OER activity on BFNCNTs, double layer capacitance (Cdl) in the faradaic silent region, that gives an indication about the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) associated with an electrocatalyst,18,19,30 is assessed from the CV curves recorded in nitrogen purged 1 M NaOH aqueous solution in the potential window of −0.5 to −0.6 V (Fig. S5†). The evaluated Cdl values for BFNCNTs, FNCNTs and BNCNTs are found to be 56.4, 8.9 and 2.4 mF cm−2 (Fig. 4c), respectively, which indicates the presence of large amounts of electrochemical active centres in BFNCNTs over FNCTs & BNCNTs, and hence, the better OER performance on BFNCNTs. For further understanding of enhanced OER performance on BFNCNTs, the quasi-reversible [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox study which involves one electron transfer was performed as a probe to evaluate the ease with which electron transfer takes place on electrocatalysts subjected to study using 10 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution.59Fig. 4d shows the CV curves recorded on BFNCNTs, FNCNTs and BNCNTs for the one-electron quasi-reversible redox process under similar experimental conditions (loading of catalysts was 750 μg cm−2). The increased current of BFNCNTs over FNCNTs and BNCNTs advocates faster electron transfer and supports much improved OER electroactivity. Overall, the study suggests that the catalyst (BFNCNTs) obtained by the sequential pyrolysis of TPB and ferrocene has enhanced electrochemical active centres and better electron transfer properties than FNCNTs and BNCNTs, respectively. The increase in electrochemically active centres suggested in Fig. 4c is in agreement with the Raman study in Fig. 3b, as the surface defects are more plentiful in BFNCNTs than in FNCNTs & BNCNTs which is elucidated by the large ID/IG ratio for BFNCNTs (∼1.7). Interestingly, no shift in the onset potential has been observed even after the 1000th cycle with ∼94% current retention under accelerated testing conditions (at 600 rpm with 100 mV s−1 sweep rate, Fig. 4e). In order to shed some light on the kinetics of the OER on BFNCNTs, we have tried to evaluate the Tafel slope and the order of the OER reaction with respect to hydroxide ions (OH−) present in the solution. BFNCNTs show a Tafel slope of ∼96 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4f) which is better than that for FNCNTs (∼141 mV dec−1), BNCNTs (∼142 mV dec−1) and various recently reported CNS based catalysts. Furthermore, to evaluate the OER order, the LSV polarization curves are recorded on BFNCNTs in 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 M NaOH aqueous solution as shown in Fig. 4g. The results suggest (Fig. 4h) a first order reaction with respect to OH− which indicates that each electrochemical active centre accommodates only a single OH− ion for all steps involved in the OER.5 Overall, the present study suggests better OER performance on BFNCNTs over other catalysts under study and various recently reported electrocatalysts (Table S2†).23,47,48,61

Oxygen reduction study
Inspired by the promising OER activity on BFNCNTs, we studied the ORR response in an alkaline medium (0.1 M NaOH) in an attempt to appraise the bifunctional nature, an important trait for air cathode catalysts in developing metal–air batteries. We recorded CVs in the oxygen-saturated alkaline solution at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 which are presented in Fig. S6.† The cathodic peaks around −357 and −350 mV for FNCNTs (JORR ∼ 1.5 mA cm−2) and BNCNTs (JORR ∼ 1 mA cm−2), under oxygen-saturation conditions, correspond to the ORR process. A shift of the ORR peak position (−290 mV) towards the positive side with the increased ORR current density to 2 mA cm−2 for BFNCNTs suggests the better ORR facilitation on BFNCNTs. No ORR peak has been observed under the nitrogen-saturated conditions. For further understanding of the ORR process, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) are recorded. Fig. 5a comprises of LSV curves for FNCNTs, BNCNTs, BFNCNTs and Pt–C at 2400 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed in oxygen-saturated alkaline solution. The onset potential (Eonset, in this study the potential at 0.05 mA cm−2 has been considered as the onset potential) for BFNCNTs (−30 mV) is shifted by ∼70 mV towards the positive side to that of FNCNTs (−100 mV) and BNCNTs (−100 mV). Interestingly, the Eonset of BFNCNTs is close to that of the Pt–C catalyst (Eonset(Pt–C) = −35 mV) with superior current density among the catalysts under study (J is 6.4, −4.2, −3.6 and −3.3 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl for BFNCNTs, Pt–C, FNCNTs and BNCNTs, respectively). Besides, the half-wave potential for BFNCNTs (−225 mV) is similar to that of Pt–C and on the positive side as compared to that for FNCNTs (−350 mV) and BNCNTs (−355 mV) as well as various recently reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts (Table S3†). Fig. 5b presents the Tafel slopes for Pt–C, BFNCNTs, FNCNTs and BNCNTs in the low over potential region. The Tafel slope for BFNCNTs (66 mV dec−1) is much better than FNCNTs (96 mV dec−1) and BNCNTs (102 mV dec−1) and very close to that theoretically predicted and reported for the commercial state-of-the-art Pt–C electrocatalyst (60 mV dec−1) which suggests that the oxygen species follow the Temkin adsorption conditions on electrocatalyst surface with fast initial electron transfer step.2,38 In the present study, we too observed a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec−1 for commercial Pt–C. Overall, the study suggests that BFNCNTs, in a similar manner to the OER, facilitate the ORR.

For further understanding of ORR kinetics, the LSV curves of BFNCNTs at different rotation speeds are recorded as shown in Fig. 5c. The measured current density increases with the increasing rotation speed owing to the fast oxygen flux availability on the electrode surface. The kinetic parameters of the ORR process is obtained by using the Koutecky–Levich (K–L)9,23 equation in the mixed current region and is given by (1)where J, Jd and Jk represent the experimentally obtained, diffusion and kinetic current densities. For RDE voltammetry, the Jd can be correlated with the working electrode rotation speed by using the Levich equation which is Jd = 0.62nFDO22/3ν−1/6Coω1/2(2)where n represents the overall number of electrons transferred in the oxygen reduction process, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity (0.011 cm2 s−1) of the electrolyte, DO2 is the bulk diffusion co-efficient (1.65 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) of oxygen in the electrolyte, Co is the concentration of oxygen (8.4 × 10−7 mol cm−3) dissolved in the electrolyte, ω is the angular velocity of the working electrode.9,23
The corresponding K–L plots (J−1 and ω−1/2) with good linearity represent the first-order reaction kinetics for the ORR (Fig. 5d) with respect to the dissolved oxygen and the parallel nature of lines ensures the uniform electron transfer with respect to applied potentials.62 Besides, the kinetic current (Jk) and the no. of electron (n) transfer for reduction per oxygen molecule in alkaline media can be evaluated by using the intercept and the slope value obtained with K–L plot analysis.9 Fig. S7† & 5e represent the Jk and n values, respectively, with working electrode potentials. The study shows the preferable four electron pathway for the ORR on the BFNCNTs which ensures the maximum electrochemical energy harvesting. Moreover, in an attempt to study the stability of BFNCNTs we performed the accelerated test study at a rotation speed of 2200 rpm and a sweep rate of 125 mV s−1. Fig. 5f shows the 10th and 1000th LSV polarization curves for the ORR in oxygen-saturated alkaline solution on BFNCNTs. A nominal half wave potential (∼10 mV) shift with nearly 94% current retention of the initial value was observed which suggests the excellent stability of BFNCNTs. Furthermore, the Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts in case of alcohol-based fuel cells are extremely susceptible towards fuel crossover, if any, which causes the mixed potential generation at the cathode and reduces fuel-cell efficiency. In this regard, we studied BFNCNTs to examine the fuel tolerant capacity. Interestingly the shape of the polarization curve for the ORR on BFNCNTs remains the same in the absence of ethanol as well as after ethanol addition to the aqueous solution as shown in Fig. 5g. This ensures the fuel tolerant behaviour of BFNCNTs. In addition, a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was used to assess the ORR performance of the catalyst under study. Fig. 5h shows the ring and disk currents for BFNCNTs, Pt–C, FNCNTs and BNCNTs. The number of electrons transferred (n) per oxygen molecule reduction in the ORR process on BFNCNTs, Pt–C, FNCNTs and BNCNTs estimated from the ring and disk currents are depicted in Fig. 5i which shows the preferable 4e− pathways on BFNCNTs (which is consistent with the K–L analysis) and better performance as compared to FNCNTs and BNCNTs. Besides, the ring currents were used to estimate the amount of hydrogen peroxide generation on these catalysts. As it is evident from Fig. 5j, the amount of hydrogen peroxide generated on the BFNCNT electrode is significantly less than that on the FNCNTs and BNCNTs, indicating that the BFNCNT electrode is a more efficient ORR electrocatalyst and it emulates the commercially available Pt–C catalyst in this regard (Fig. 5i and j).
Overall oxygen electroactivity
In general, the overall oxygen electro-catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst is appraised by the difference between potentials where the current density is 10 mA cm−2 for the OER and half-wave potential for the ORR (ΔE = Ej=10 − E1/2).30 The smaller is the magnitude of ΔE, better is the electro-catalyst for oxygen electrochemistry in electrochemical storage devices like metal–air batteries.30 As one of the reasons for measure loss in metal–air batteries which diminishes the power output and cyclic efficiency by 70% is the combined over-potentials in the ORR (η discharge) and OER (η charge).6–9 In the present study, BFNCNTs display a ΔE of 0.788 V (Fig. 6a) which is much smaller than those of B-MWCNTs (ΔE = 1.00 V),23 NS-CN (ΔE ∼ 0.88 V),30 MWCNTs@S–N–C (ΔE = 1.25 V),32 nitrogen, phosphorous co-doped carbon paper (ΔE = 0.96 V),33 nitrogen-doped graphene-CNT composites (ΔE = 1.00 V)34 as well as some noble/transition-metal based electro-catalysts e.g. Fe/N/C@BMZIF (ΔE ∼ 0.79 V)31 Fe/Fe3C@NGL-NCNT (ΔE = 1.29 V),47 Fe/Fe3C@N-graphitic layer (ΔE = 0.97 V),48 NiCo2O4/graphene (ΔE = 0.915 V),59 CoFe2O4/rGO (ΔE = 0.98 V),60 CoFe2O4/N–P-biocarbon (ΔE = 0.98 V),63 Ir@C (ΔE = 0.92 V), CaMn4Ox (ΔE = 1.04 V), Pt@C (ΔE = 0.94 V), and MnxOy/N-carbon (ΔE = 0.93 V),63,64 as shown in Fig. 6b (Table S4†). Overall, BFNCNTs exhibit superior ORR and OER electro-catalytic activity collectively.

The superior bifunctional behaviour of BFNCNTs can be attributed to the presence of hetero-atoms like Fe, N, and B in the carbon structure. It is known that the encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanostructures activate the carbon layers towards the ORR and the carbon layers protect the Fe–Fe3C nanostructures which improve the stability.15c Furthermore, the presence of N is beneficial in many ways. The pyridinic and pyrrolic N coordinates with Fe to form Fe–Nx/C centres which has been considered as the active electrochemical site.16c In addition, the graphitic N modifies the C–N bond length to the O–O bond length and facilitates the oxygen interaction and hence, the ORR activity.17c Similar to N, B also interacts with carbon resulting in a variety of BCx moieties which can serve as active ORR centres due to the electronegativity difference between C (∼2.5) and B (∼2).25,54 Thus, the presence of all these heteroatoms in BFNCNTs is highly beneficial for oxygen electrochemistry. The improved stability of BFNCNTs may be attributed to the presence of protective layers and the mesoporosity in the structure (as evident from Fig. 3h) that provide the facile transportation pathways and accessibility of electrochemical active centres to the reactant species. In the case of oxygen evolution, the porous structure is highly beneficial as it offers an appropriate gas outlet to prevent the gas-bubble accumulation that blocks the electrochemical active centres1b and trims down the activity with time. Overall, the presence of different active centres and the protective layers makes BFNCNTs as excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts both in terms of activity and stability.
Practical realization
Inspired by the enhanced overall oxygen electrocatalytic activity of BFNCNTs, we tested the practicability of BFNCNTs as a cathode catalyst for a prototype metal–air battery system. We fabricated a proto-type battery arrangement (Fig. 7) using aluminium foil (1 cm × 2 cm, locally available, common house hold) as an anode electrode and BFNCNTs drop-cast on carbon paper (2 cm × 2 cm, loading of BFNCNTs 750 μg cm−2) as an air-cathode electrode. It is worthy to note that the fabrication has been done in ambiance. Fig. 7a and b show the BFNCNTs@carbon paper (CNP) and aluminium foil used for battery realization. A porous cloth dipped in 1 M NaOH DI aqueous solution is used as the separator between these two electrodes. Fig. 7c shows two prototype batteries connected in series and powering a light emitting diode (Fig. 7d) which indicates the practical feasibility of BFNCNTs as a potential electrode material for battery applications.

Conclusions
In summary, a rational facile methodology has been developed to fabricate N-enriched carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Fe–Fe3C co-embedded nanostructures in B-doped mesoporous carbon nanostructures (BFNCNTs) as a noble metal-free superior bi-functional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. The co-embedded electrocatalyst obtained by sequential pyrolysis provides better opportunity to control the incorporation of N and B with negligible/undetectable B–N formation which is otherwise electrochemically inactive due to the compensating nature of B and N entities. The resultant mesoporous CNS with a high specific BET surface area (272 m2 g−1), enhanced defects and heterogeneity in a single structure ensures the increased electrochemical active centres, better exposure and accessibility of active sites to the reactant species. Besides the better OER/ORR activities as compared to those of commercial RuO2/Pt–C catalysts and various recently reported state-of-the-art bi-functional electrocatalysts, BFNCNTs exhibit a nearly 94% current retention even after the accelerated stability test for the OER and ORR. In addition, the fuel tolerant behaviour in combination with preferable 4e− ORR pathways warrants maximum energy harvesting. Interestingly, the overall oxygen electroactivity on BFNCNTs as appraised by ΔE (=Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.788 V) is much lower than several hetero-atom doped/co-doped carbon nanostructure based metal-free/transition metal incorporated state-of-the-art bi-functional electrocatalysts developed recently. In addition, we tested the viability of BFNCNTs as the cathode catalyst by fabricating a prototype battery system for powering a light emitting diode. Overall, our study suggests co-embedding may offer a new approach to revisit and modify the synthesis/design technique for carbon nanostructures in order to develop promising bi-functional electro-catalysts for both the ORR and OER. Moreover, the methodology applied here, is believed to pave the way for the design of multi-functional catalysts to assimilate the individual properties of each catalyst.
Experimental section
Materials
For synthesis, ferrocene (Merck, 98% purity), melamine (C3H6N6, S.D. Fine chemicals, 97.5% purity) and TPB ((C6H5)3B, Sigma Aldrich) are used. Milli-Q water (conductivity ∼5 × 10−8 S) and sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) are used to make the solution alkaline.
Synthesis procedure for NCNTs, BFNCNTs, BNCNTs and FNCNTs
NCNTs are synthesized by pyrolysing22,65 ferrocene (20 mg) and melamine (100 mg) at 950 °C (temperature ramp rate is 10 °C per min) for 3 h duration using a Lenton tube furnace (LTF 14/—/180) in a quartz tube (1 cm in diameter and 100 cm in length) with one end closed and the other end connected to a rubber bladder (Fig. S1†). After the synthesis of NCNTs, the furnace was allowed to cool to attain the ambient temperature. Furthermore, 100 mg of TPB and 100 mg of ferrocene were introduced in the same quartz tube and kept in the furnace for 3 h at 850 °C (temperature ramp rate is 10 °C per min) to obtain BFNCNTs. To synthesize BNCNTs/FNCNTs, TPB/ferrocene is added in the same quartz tube (after the synthesis of NCNTs as discussed above) and subjected to 850 °C (ramp rate of 10 °C per min). The as-synthesized catalysts (BFNCNTs, BNCNTs & FNCNTs) were subjected to acid wash followed by Milli-Q water washing prior to characterization and electrochemical studies to remove the residual metal ions, if any.
It may be noted that the synthesis temperature plays a crucial role in the synthesis of hetero-atom doped carbon nanostructures. In the first step, we have chosen the pyrolysis temperature as 950 °C to synthesize the nitrogen-doped CNTs. Our previous studies suggest that the N-doped bamboo shaped CNTs are obtained at 950 °C.22,65 In the second step, the pyrolysis temperature was 850 °C as the formation of Fe–Fe3C nanostructures can be feasible above ∼750 °C as predicted by the Fe–C phase diagram.66
Characterization technique
NCNTs, BNCNTs, FNCNTs & BFNCNTs were characterized by FEI SIRION scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI-TECHNAI F30), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a PAN analytical instrument using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source, Raman spectroscopy (with a Nd:YAG laser, excitation wavelength 532 nm, WITec, Germany) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA DLD from Kratos) with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K (Quantachrome Instrument) were performed for the evaluation of the specific surface area using the BET method. The pore structure was analysed by the BJH method. For electrochemical characterization, CV, RDE, RRDE voltammetry studies were carried out with a CHI instrument (700E) using a traditional three electrode set-up consisting of a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, active geometrical area ∼ 0.07 cm2 for the RDE and 0.196 cm2 for the RRDE), KCl saturated Ag/AgCl and a Pt ring as the working, reference and counter electrode, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
For electrochemical studies, the ink solutions of the respective catalysts were prepared by dispersing 7 mg of catalyst in 1 ml of Milli-Q water and sonicated for 30 minutes to achieve better dispersion. For each study 60 μl of the prepared catalyst ink solution was mixed with 10 μl of Nafion® solution (5%, Sigma Aldrich), named stock solution. For optimization of loading of the catalyst 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 & 10.0 μl of stock solution of BFNCNTs were successively drop-cast on the GCE (geometrical area ∼ 0.07 cm2, which corresponds to 250, 500, 750 & 1000 μg cm−2) followed by drying under a lamp prior to OER measurements. For the OER, the LSV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with 600 rpm in a potential window of 0 to 0.8 V. The optimized loading of BFNCNTs for better OER performance in 1 M NaOH solution was found to be 750 μg cm−2. To evaluate the OER reaction order, the LSV curves for BFNCNTs (loading 750 μg cm−2) were recorded in 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 M NaOH solution at 600 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed. For the OER the solutions were purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min prior to experiments. For the ORR, 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution was purged by nitrogen/oxygen gas for 30 min. CV curves for the ORR were recorded in the potential window of 0.1 to −0.8 V (at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1). Polarization curves using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at different rotation speeds with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 were carried out with an RDE/RRDE set-up in 0.1 M NaOH oxygen/nitrogen saturated aqueous solution at room temperature for the ORR. The RDE data were analysed using K–L plots (J−1vs. ω−1/2) at different potentials to evaluate the electron transfer (ET) number (n) based on the K–L equation.9,23 Furthermore, for better understanding the variation of n with the applied potential and the generation of % H2O2 were deduced from RRDE voltammetry using the equations as follows:9,23 (3) (4)where n represents the no. of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule reduction process, Id is the faradaic disk current, Ir is the faradaic ring current, and N (=0.3) is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring electrode in the RRDE study. The Pt-ring potential was set to constant at 0.5 V to monitor the formation and further reduction of peroxide intermediate during the ORR process, if any.9,23 For comparative studies the loading of the commercial catalyst (Pt–C/RuO2 for ORR/OER) was maintained as 750 μg cm−2 as the geometrical surface area of the electrode is used for normalization of currents in the present study. In order to calculate the overall oxygen electroactivity of BFNCNTs, the recorded polarization curves with respect to the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were converted with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the equation ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + EoAg/AgCl, where EoAg/AgCl is 0.197 V vs. the SHE.
