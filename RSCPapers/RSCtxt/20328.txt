    , Accepted 18th February 2013First published on 19th February 2013AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen production using semiconductor materials is one of the ideal processes for direct solar energy conversion. Sulphide semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted much attention due to their excellent solar spectrum responses and high photocatalytic activities. This article presents recent research progress in the development of visible light driven sulphide photocatalysts, focusing on the expansion of solar spectrum response and enhancement of charge separation efficiency. As is known, the ultimate goal of photocatalytic hydrogen production is to meet the practical energy demand of human beings. Thus, design of highly efficient and low cost sulphide photocatalysts with excellent sunlight response is highly desired. So we also highlight the crucial issues in the development of highly efficient sulphide photocatalysts without noble metal cocatalysts. The present paper is expected to provide important scientific reference for future works. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this area are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Since the first discovery by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, photocatalytic hydrogen production using semiconductor materials has been considered as one of the ultimate solutions for energy and environmental issues.1 During the past 50 years, great progress has been made in this exciting field, numerous semiconductors have been reported to be effective for photocatalytic hydrogen production.2 However, Maeda and Domen have reported that to meet 1/3 of the energy requirement of human beings by 2050 through photocatalytic hydrogen production, ten thousand photocatalytic water splitting systems with energy conversion efficiency above 10% should be established.2Fig. 1 shows the relationship between energy conversion efficiency and quantum yield of photocatalysts with different absorption edges. Photocatalysts with a photoresponse of up to 600 nm should have an average quantum yield as high as 60% in the whole absorption range to achieve the requirement of practical application. To the best of our knowledge, photocatalysts satisfying the above minimum requirement have not yet been obtained. Apparently, we still have a long way to go to achieve a green and clean energy future by photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Metal oxides, such as SrTiO3,3,4 TiO25 and NaTaO3,6,7 possess suitable band structures meeting the thermodynamic requirement for water splitting, and are non-toxic and very stable during the photocatalytic process, thus they have been reported to be the most efficient oxide photocatalysts for water splitting reported up to now. But all of them are only active under ultraviolet light, which only accounts for ∼4% of the solar spectrum. Therefore, (oxy)nitrides as well as oxysulphides, which possess excellent solar spectrum responses, have been successfully developed by Domen's group.8–13 Especially, (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) has been proved to be the most efficient photocatalyst capable of splitting pure water under visible-light irradiation.8,14–17 Since many important findings on this subject have been achieved during the past several decades, a comprehensive review on the advances in the development of oxide or non-oxide photocatalysts is already very large.18–21
However, little attention has been focused on the progress of sulphide photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Sulphides always possess relatively high conduction band positions suitable for H2O reduction and better sunlight responses than oxides, which are originated from the higher valence band positions composed of S 3p orbitals. For instance, ZnS–AgInS2–CuInS2 solid solution has an absorption edge up to ca. 800 nm, that is, it could utilize the whole ultraviolet and visible light region of sunlight.22,23 But the excellent visible light responses are always achieved at the cost of oxidizing abilities. Thus, thermodynamically, sulphides are not capable of splitting pure water due to their S 2p containing valance band. Sacrificial reagents are always needed to achieve photocatalytic hydrogen production. For example, sulphides always exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities in aqueous solution using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. Pt/PdS/CdS, reported by C. Li et al., show an extremely high apparent quantum yield of about 93% at 420 nm, almost achieving the efficiency of natural photosynthesis.24,25 One may consider that development of photocatalysts that work only for half reactions of water splitting in the presence of sacrificial reagents is not meaningful. We cannot agree with this point of view, as abundant sulphur compounds obtained from chemical industries or natural resources can be used as electron donors. As shown in Fig. 2, this reaction produces H2 at ambient temperature and pressure but does not consume fossil fuels and does not emit CO2.18

Obviously, scientific investigations on photocatalytic hydrogen production by sulphide photocatalysts are also of great importance from the viewpoint of practical application. Therefore, sulphide semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted much attention in recent years due to their excellent visible-light responses and outstanding photocatalytic properties. So a comprehensive review on this issue is timely to provide important theoretical guidance and scientific reference for future studies on this exciting subject. The present paper is focused on the recent advances in the development of highly efficient sulphide photocatalysts with different formulations, especially highlighting the important aspects of the modifications of non-loaded sulphide photocatalysts. The crucial issues that should be addressed in the future research activities are also discussed.
2. General view of sulphide photocatalysts
Numerous metal sulphide photocatalysts have been reported for water splitting in the presence of different sacrificial reagents in the past several decades. This section briefly reviews the efficient sulphide photocatalysts reported to date, with a focus on materials formulation. As shown in Table 1, over 30 kinds of sulphide materials can act as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution via water splitting. Summarizing the metal elements that construct these heterogeneous sulphide photocatalysts, we find that almost all of the sulphide photocatalysts consist of metal cations with d10 configuration (Fig. 3). It is reasonable that the conduction bands of sulphide photocatalysts are always composed of d and sp orbitals, while the valence bands consist of S 3p orbitals, which are much more negative than O 2p orbitals, thus resulting in conduction band positions negative enough to reduce H2O to H2 and narrow band gaps with suitable response to the solar spectrum.18

The genealogy of these reported sulphide photocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 4. Sulphide photocatalysts can be divided into several groups, such as IIB–VIA, IIB–IIIA–VIA, IA–IIIA–VIA and IB–IIB–IVA–VIA sulphide photocatalysts, according to their elemental compositions and material formulations. All these sulphide semiconductors can be considered as derivatives of zinc-blende structure, which are obtained through substituting IIB atoms with other metallic elements. Due to the variety of metal elements, the symmetries of corresponding crystal structures are reduced. Thus tetragonal crystal systems, the symmetries of which are obviously lower than cubic crystal systems, are gradually presented in sulphides such as chalcopyrite and stannite structures. Therefore the significant progress in the development of sulphide photocatalysts will be reviewed in the following sections with reference to their material formulations.
 Fig. 4  Genealogy of sulphide semiconductor photocatalysts and the corresponding relationship between semiconductors with different formulations. 
3. IIB–VIA sulphide photocatalysts
IIB–VIA sulphide semiconductors are one of the most popular photocatalysts reported up to now, including ZnS, CdS and Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions. As shown in Fig. 5, zinc-blende and wurtzite structures are the two types of atomic arrangements adopted by tetrahedral coordinated semiconductors of IIB–VIA groups. The lattice is FCC in the zinc-blende structure and CPH in the wurtzite structure, each structure is composed of two sublattices displaced from each in blende and wurtzite structures, respectively, metal atoms being at the nodes of one lattice and S atoms at the nodes of the other lattice. They differ by the stacking sequence: A-aB-bC-cA-aB-bC-c for the blende structure and A-aB-bA-aB-b for the wurtzite structure, where capital letters denote pure metal planes and small letters pure S planes or vice verse.145

ZnS is a typical IIB–VIA group semiconductor photocatalyst, exhibiting an extremely high apparent quantum yield of about 90% at 313 nm without noble metal co-catalysts in Na2S–Na2SO3 aqueous solution because of its high conduction band position.146 However, ZnS can only utilize ultraviolet light due to its wide band gap (∼3.6 eV). Thus numerous efforts have been made to realize visible light response while maintaining the high conduction band of ZnS. Foreign elements doping has been proved to be one of the most effective modification methods to develop visible-light active ZnS based photocatalysts.18,134,147–149Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnS doped with different transition metal cations.18,134,147,148 Foreign elements doping successfully enhances the absorbance of ZnS in the visible-light region, and the spectral shapes are distinct from those of band gap transitions, indicating that doping cations form donor levels in the forbidden band of ZnS. These doped ZnS photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities without any co-catalysts, because the high conduction band of ZnS is maintained after doping. Additionally, Muruganandham and Kusumoto successfully synthesized a novel C, N co-doped porous ZnS photocatalyst by a simple procedure, which was the first report on non-metal doped sulphide semiconductors, and the doped ZnS exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light.149 Recently, J. G. Yu et al. reported that surface modification of a ZnS porous nanosheet by CuS could significantly enhance its photocatalytic activity under visible light, and they concluded that the interfacial charge transfer from the valence band of ZnS to CuS caused the reduction of CuS to Cu2S, thus resulting in much more improved activity (Fig. 7).150

CdS, another member of IIB–VIA sulphides, is probably the best-studied metal sulphide photocatalyst for H2 evolution, because of its narrow band gap (2.4 eV) that suits very well with the solar spectrum and good band positions for reducing H2O to H2, although it is unstable and toxic. However, CdS alone exhibits very low photocatalytic activity and its good performance is always achieved by loading noble metals on the surface to lower the overpotential for H2O reduction, such as Pt, Pd, RuO2, etc.46,47,151–155 Nosaka et al. investigated the influence of different noble metal co-catalysts on the photocatalytic activities of CdS powders, and demonstrated that Rh- and Pt-loaded CdS particles showed higher activities.156 Reber and co-workers reported a series of good hydrogen production efficiencies of about 16%, 25% and 34% at 60 °C in Na2S, S2−/SO32− and S2−/H2PO2− aqueous solutions respectively.47 Borgarello et al. deposited very small quantities of RuO2 on CdS, which resulted in the quantum yield of H2 formation reaching 35% after loading, and they attributed this high efficiency to the catalysis of hole transfer from the valence band of CdS to sulphide solution.151 Pt-like tungsten carbide was also reported to act as an excellent co-catalyst for CdS in photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation.35 Recently, transition metal compounds, especially metal sulphides, were found to be excellent co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production by CdS.33,157–159 Zong and co-workers investigated the effect of MoS2 loading on the photocatalytic activity of CdS. They found that the activity of MoS2/CdS was even higher than those of CdS loaded with different noble metals, and the junction formed between MoS2 and CdS as well as the excellent H2 activation energy of MoS2 were supposed to be responsible for this enhanced activity.33,159 Zhang et al. synthesized a novel highly active NiS/CdS photocatalyst by a simple hydrothermal loading method, and a high quantum efficiency of 51.3% was measured at 420 nm in lactic acid sacrificial solution.158 Furthermore, the most encouraging achievement was made by H. J. Yan and C. Li, who reported an extremely high quantum efficiency of 93% at 420 nm approaching the level of natural photosynthesis, while Pt and PdS were simultaneously deposited on the surface of CdS particles to act as reduction and oxidation co-catalysts respectively (Fig. 8).24,25 This effective strategy to achieve high quantum yield by co-loading suitable dual co-catalysts will be of considerable importance in the design and preparation of highly active photocatalysts in the future.

All the above studies focus on the development of highly efficient co-catalysts for the CdS photocatalyst, however, the influences of crystal structure, crystallinity, defects and nanostructure on the photocatalytic performance of CdS are also worth unremittingly investigating. Matsumura et al. systematically studied the photocatalytic activities of CdS with different crystal structures. Pt-loaded CdS powder having a hexagonal crystal structure was found to be much more efficient than that having a cubic crystal structure.26 Bao and co-workers successfully tuned the crystal structure of CdS by a simple cadmium–thiourea complex thermolysis route, and further confirmed the superiority of hexagonal CdS in the photocatalytic process.39 CdS photocatalysts with different morphology, such as nanocrystals, nanowires and nanorods, were also reported for the photocatalytic hydrogen production.36,38,43,160 The most interesting discovery was that CdS with special surface nanosteps, synthesized through a novel thermal sulfuration method by L. J. Guo and D. W. Jing, exhibited an apparent quantum efficiency as high as 25% at 420 nm, and the nanostep structure was found to be crucial for the remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production, as the reaction sites were successfully separated by this special structure (Fig. 9).41 Then CdS powder with porous nanostructure, including nanosheets and hollow nanorods, was prepared via a two-step aqueous route by Bao et al. (Fig. 10). After 10 wt% Pt loading, a high quantum yield of about 60% was measured at 420 nm. They attributed its high efficiency to the efficient charge separation, fast transport of the photo-generated carriers, and fast photochemical reaction at the CdS/electrolyte interface.44

Although CdS is the most often investigated sulphide photocatalyst for hydrogen production, there are still some existing shortcomings such as photocorrosion and the need for noble metal cocatalysts. Meanwhile, ZnS is a good candidate for photocatalytic water splitting, but its large band gap limits the range of light response. Therefore, considering the similar crystal structures of CdS and ZnS, much attention has been focused on making Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions in order to overcome the above disadvantages.97,100,104,105,108,161,162 The important achievements in this subject will be mentioned in Section 7.
4. IIB–IIIA–VIA sulphide photocatalysts
ZnIn2S4, which is the most popular IIB–IIIA–VIA sulphide semiconductor, always exhibits two distinct polymorphs based on cubic and hexagonal lattices as shown in Fig. 11. The structure of cubic ZnIn2S4 can be described by an ABC stacking of sulphur atoms, with Zn atoms tetrahedrally coordinated and In atoms octahedrally coordinated by S atoms. The hexagonal polymorph of ZnIn2S4 exhibits several different polytypes. The structure of these polytypes is essentially based on stacking of packets of S–Zn–S–In–S–In–S layers. Each packet could have an ABCA stacking of sulphur atoms or an ABAB stacking of sulphur atoms. In each packet containing zinc, indium and sulphur, the zinc atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by sulphur atoms, the indium atoms of one layer are tetrahedrally coordinated and those of the other layer are octahedrally coordinated by sulphur atoms. The stacking of these packets also generates a layer of vacancies between two weakly bonded sulphur layers.120,163–165 Thus the solution coordination model (SCM) was always proposed to explain the formation mechanism of ZnIn2S4 with different crystal structures, since the coordination of the ions formed in solution can serve as a template to retain the same coordination mode in the solid.164,166,167
 Fig. 11  Schematic diagram of hexagonal and cubic crystal structure ZnIn2S4.168 
ZnIn2S4 possesses many distinct optical and photoelectrical properties, and has attracted widespread attention since the first report on its application in photocatalysis,111 due to the suitable band gap in the visible region and substantial chemical stability.124 Gou et al. synthesized ZnIn2S4 with various morphologies including nanotubes, nanoribbons, nanowires and microspheres by hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, but they did not evaluate the photocatalytic activities.167 Chen et al. synthesized flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres with different crystal structures via a facile hydrothermal method by simply changing the metal precursors. Both hexagonal and cubic ZnIn2S4 exhibited photocatalytic activities for the degradation of MO, but the photocatalytic performances over them were different.166 Then they performed photocatalytic degradation of RhB and MO over hexagonal ZnIn2S4 microspheres and cubic ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles. Hexagonal ZnIn2S4 microspheres exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB as compared to cubic ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles, while a reverse phenomenon was observed in the degradation of MO. It was concluded that the exposed negative (0001) S plane which is composed of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 microspheres played an important role in the adsorption of cationic dyes and accumulation of photogenerated holes.169 Lei reported hydrothermal synthesis of ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles and examined the photocatalytic water reduction performance under visible-light irradiation.111 Shen and co-workers synthesized cubic and rhombohedral ZnIn2S4 by thermal sulfuration of a Zn–In mixed oxide precursor at different temperatures. It was found that ZnIn2S4 with rhombohedral structure photocatalyzed H2 evolution from sacrificial agent solution efficiently, whereas cubic ZnIn2S4 was not active for this reaction.168 Thus the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution of ZnIn2S4 with cubic crystal structure was rarely reported, whereas hexagonal ZnIn2S4, especially with flower-like microsphere morphologies, has been intensively studied in recent years. Guo's group synthesized ZnIn2S4 microspheres via hydrothermal/solvothermal processes and investigated their visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution performances, and a proportional relationship between the d(006) space and quantum yields of the photocatalysts was discovered (Fig. 12).114,116,118 Peng et al. reported that the hydrothermal temperature and pH value had important effects on the crystal structures, morphologies, optical properties and photocatalytic activities of the ZnIn2S4 micropheres. Photocatalysts prepared at 160 °C and pH = 1.00 showed the highest photocatalytic H2 production with an apparent quantum yield of up to 34.3% at 420 nm.113

The ZnS–In2S3 system, which is reported to exist in various modifications with the general formulation of ZnmIn2S3+m (m = 1–5), is also a good candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen production.120,163 ZnmIn2S3+m are formed by m layers of ZnS4 tetrahedra and a constant structural unit consisting of one layer of indium atoms in octahedral voids, another layer of indium atoms in tetrahedral voids, and a layer which is not occupied by cations. Shen et al. synthesized ZnmIn2S3+m photocatalysts with different m values by a simple hydrothermal method. The morphology of ZnmIn2S3+m greatly depended on the atomic ratio of Zn/In, while the absorption edges of ZnmIn2S3+m shifted to a shorter wavelength as the atomic ratio of Zn/In in the synthetic solution was increased (i.e. m increased from 1 to 5). It was found that the Zn2In2S5 product had the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light among these ZnmIn2S3+m photocatalysts, with the quantum yield at 420 nm determined to be 11.1%.120
5. IB–IIIA–VIA sulphide photocatalysts
IB–IIIA–VIA (IB = Cu, Ag; IIIA = Al, In, Ga; VIA = S) ternary sulphide semiconductors, with the general formulae of I–III–VI2 and I–III5–VI8, have been receiving considerable research and industrial interest recently. These ternary semiconductors are good photo-absorbers for solar cells and photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) devices, because their energy band gaps lie between 0.8 and 2.0 eV.170–176 Especially, Cu–In–S and Ag–In–S are also interesting photocatalyst materials, which have attracted much attention because of their suitable band gaps for solar energy conversion and capacities for H2 production.172 Fujishima et al. investigated the photocatalytic activities of CuInS2 and CuIn5S8 for H2 evolution in sulphite aqueous solution almost twenty years ago. The activity of CuIn5S8 was about twice that of CuInS2 and was improved remarkably by the addition of silver sulphide, which was attributed to the improvement of hole transfer in the heterojunction of CuIn5S8 and Ag2S.177 Garskaite and co-workers prepared transition metal doped CuInS2 films by a chemical bath method. Sb-doped CuInS2 exhibited the maximum photocurrent density of −8.58 mA cm−2, and the maximum hydrogen evolution of p-type Zn-doped CuInS2 films was 33.26 mL cm−2.178 Xie's group synthesized monodisperse CuInS2 with hierarchical microarchitectures by a facile in situ formed template solvothermal route. They found that a phase conversion process from binary sulphide (CuS) to ternary sulphide (CuInS2) played an important role in the formation of the special morphology, which resulted in a much higher average hydrogen yield of 59.4 μmol h−1.129 Chen and Ye reported AgIn5S8 as an excellent visible-light response photocatalyst in S2−/SO32− aqueous solution for the first time, and H2 evolution could be observed even when the wavelength of the cutoff filter was greater than 640 nm by this photocatalyst.130 Kudo et al. prepared layered metal sulphides AGa2In3S8 (A = Cu or Ag) by a solid state reaction, both CuGa2In3S8 (1.91 eV) and AgGa2In3S8 (2.27 eV) gave 15% apparent quantum yields at 560 nm and 460 nm for H2 evolution with the assistance of Rh cocatalysts, respectively, and Rh/CuGa2In3S8 responded to 680 nm for the photocatalytic H2 evolution.133 They also prepared visible-light active NaInS2 photocatalysts using a solid state reaction, and a hydrogen evolution rate of 470 μmol h−1 g−1 was achieved under visible-light irradiation.179
Ternary semiconductors of the I–III–VI2 group always exist as a chalcopyrite structure, which is composed of tetrahedral units with four anions coordinated to a cation. Thus the unit cell of the chalcopyrite type can approximately be regarded as two unit cells of a zinc-blende type piled up along the c axis.137 It is known that ZnS with a zinc-blende structure has an excellent ability to produce H2 under ultraviolet-light irradiation, and is a good host material for the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts by making solid solutions with other narrow band gap semiconductors.138 Therefore, alloyed nanocrystals between chalcopyrite sulphide semiconductors and ZnS have been intensively investigated recently. Tsuji et al. demonstrated that I–II–VI2/ZnS photocatalysts inherit an outstanding capacity in hydrogen generation from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (Fig. 13).22,23,137–139 These solid solution photocatalysts showed high activities for H2 evolution, and the highest H2 production rate was reported to be 8.2 L h−1 m2. Theory band structure calculation and the photophysical analysis revealed that the visible-light-response should be attributed to the contribution of Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals to the valence band and that of In 5s5p orbitals to the conduction band. Especially, the Zn 4s4p orbitals played an important role in maintaining the conduction band energy level high enough to reduce H2O.144

However, the synthesis method of I–II–VI2/ZnS photocatalysts was obviously not cost-effective and environmentally friendly due to the use of H2S gas and thermal treatment at high temperature. Thus, considerable efforts have been made to develop a novel synthesis method for I–III–VI2/ZnS photocatalysts.140,180,181 Guo et al. reported the preparation of (CuIn)xZn2(1−x)S2 type solid solutions for all 0.01 < x < 0.5 values using a facile hydrothermal route with CTAB as a surfactant. Particles obtained showed a spherical super-structural morphology, and the CTAB helps to increase the specific surface of the photocatalysts. After 1.5 wt% Ru-loading, the photocatalyst presented the best activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution with an energy conversion efficiency of 0.9% and an apparent quantum yield of 15.45% at 420 nm.182 Chen's group achieved an extremely high photocatalytic activity on a novel nanoporous ZnS–In2S3–Ag2S photocatalyst which was prepared by a simple template-free hydrothermal method, even in the absence of co-catalysts (Fig. 14).183,184 The apparent quantum yield of ZnIn0.23Ag2xS1.345+x (x = 0.02 and 0.035) nanostructures at 420 nm is 19.8% and 19.6%, respectively, amongst the highest reported yields for semiconductor photocatalysts under visible light. Then they synthesized hierarchical ZnS–In2S3–CuS nanospheres with nanoporous structure by a similar method. An especially high photocatalytic activity (an apparent yield of 22.6% at 420 nm) is achieved by unloaded ZnIn0.25Cu0.02S1.395 because of its high crystallinity, large pore volume and the special microstructure.185

6. IB–IIB–IVA–VIA sulphide photocatalysts
Stannite-type I2–II–IV–VI4 (I = Cu and Ag, II = Zn, IV = Sn and Ge, VI = S) compounds are quaternary complex sulphides whose crystal structures are similar to a zinc-blende structure of ZnS and a chalcopyrite structure of CuInS2. Each metal cation is tetrahedrally coordinated by four sulfur anions. The structures of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 containing Cu as a monovalent ion have been investigated in detail. There are alternating cation layers of mixed Zn and IVA atoms, which are separated from each other by layers of Cu atoms.186 These semiconductors can be obtained by replacing half of the In atoms in CuInS2 with Zn, and by replacing the other half with Sn or Ge. Since the abundance of Zn and Sn is much larger than that of In, this compound has been studied extensively as one of the most promising alternatives for an absorber of thin film solar cells, and recently conversion efficiency of the Cu2ZnSnS4-based solar cell has reached over 6.7%.187 Kudo's group has aimed at these quaternary complex sulphides as new visible-light-driven photocatalysts, because the constituting elements such as Cu, Ag and Zn could contribute to the valence and conduction band formation (Fig. 15).144 They synthesized quaternary stannite-type complex sulphides by a solid state reaction method similar to the preparation of ZnS–AgInS2–CuInS2, and Ru cocatalyst-loaded Cu2ZnGeS4, Ag2ZnGeS4 and Ag2ZnSnS4 showed high activities for photocatalytic H2 evolution from an aqueous Na2S–K2SO3 solution under visible-light irradiation. Especially the CuAgZnSnS4 photocatalyst possessed a band gap of about 1.4 eV which could utilize a wide range of visible light. As the crystal structures of the stannite-type complex sulphides are similar to those of photocatalysts with zinc-blende-type and wurtzite-type structures, such as CdS, ZnS and ZnS–AgInS2–CuInS2, they have also tried to make solid solutions of Cu2ZnSnS4, Ag2ZnSnS4 and ZnS. The incorporation of ZnS samples gave an upward shift of conduction band edges, whereas the presence of Ag2ZnSnS4 in the solid solution might make them possess n-type conductivity, leading to efficient migration of photogenerated electrons to the surface to induce water reduction into H2.143

7. Highly efficient Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts
As is known, the ultimate goal of photocatalytic water splitting is to meet the practical energy demand of human beings, the key issue of which is to develop highly efficient and low cost photocatalysts with excellent sunlight responses. Cd1−xZnxS, which is the solid solution of CdS and ZnS, has attracted lots of attention in recent years, due to the controllable band structure and excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation, especially in the absence of noble metal co-catalysts. Systematic investigation of the development of highly efficient Cd1−xZnxS should be highly evaluated from the standpoints of both theoretical research and industrial application. However, the photocatalytic activity of the Cd1−xZnxS photocatalyst is still far from the fundamental requirement of practical application. Thus in order to significantly improve the photocatalytic efficiency, development of novel approaches for the modification of the Cd1−xZnxS photocatalyst is highly desired.
7.1. Seeking for novel synthesis methods
Many methods have been explored to fabricate Cd1−xZnxS solid solution, such as coprecipitation,92 micro-emulsion,188 hydrothermal/solvothermal,91,189 and decomposition of molecular precursors.190 Recently, Xing et al. synthesized Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions via simple co-precipitation followed by heat treatment under a N2 atmosphere, and a quantum efficiency of 2.17% and 0.60% was obtained using Cd0.62Zn0.16S under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation, respectively.88 Villoria and co-workers systematically investigated the influence of thermal treatment on the photocatalytic activity of Cd1−xZnxS. They found that elemental losses upon heat treatment caused the change in the composition and the appearance of defects in the crystalline structure of the Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions, thus intensively affecting the photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production.191 Guo's group applied a novel thermal sulfuration method for the preparation of Cd1−xZnxS for the first time, Cd0.8Zn0.2S exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity and a high apparent quantum yield of 10.23% at 420 nm without needing the deposition of noble metal cocatalysts, which was also the highest efficiency of non-loaded photocatalysts at that time. Comparative studies showed that the sulphide photocatalyst prepared by thermal sulfuration has a much higher activity than that prepared by conventional methods, which is attributed in part to its better crystallinity and more importantly to the existence of a charge gradient due to the uneven distribution of anionic S2−, which promotes the charge separation of e−–h+ pairs and avoids their recombination in the bulk of the semiconductor, leading to significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production.90

Although Cd1−xZnxS can successfully overcome the shortcomings of photocorrosion from CdS and a wide band gap of ZnS, the band gap of this solid solution is still larger than the ideal value (1.8 eV), which thus limits the utilization of the solar spectrum for hydrogen evolution. Therefore doping of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution with various metal ions has been intensively studied recently, such as Cu,94 Ni192,193 and Sn194, which can enhance the visible light response by forming impurity levels in the forbidden band. Liu et al. synthesized a Cu doped Cd0.1Zn0.9S photocatalyst by a coprecipitation method, and an apparent quantum yield of about 9.6% at 420 nm was achieved by the Cd0.1Cu0.01Zn0.89S photocatalyst without cocatalysts.195,196 Xu and co-workers reported a novel solid solution of Zn0.95Cu0.05S and CdS with a cubic structure, as shown in Fig. 16. The solid solution sample (Zn0.95Cu0.05)1−xCdxS with x = 0.33 gave the highest H2 production rate, and the apparent quantum efficiencies obtained were 15.7% and 31.8% for the samples without and with Pt, respectively. It was concluded that the Zn and Cd contributed to obtain a proper band gap while maintaining a relatively high conduction band potential, and Cu2+ impurity levels in the forbidden band could accommodate the photogenerated charge carriers and thus increased the photocatalytic activity.197 Recently, they synthesized Cu–Cd–Zn sulphide nanospheres with controlled copper locations by a two-step solvothermal method. It was found that the activity of the sample with copper only on the surface shell is about two times of that with copper only in the core, but the highest hydrogen production rate was obtained on the nanosphere sample with copper both in the core and on the surface shell.198

7.2.2. Alkaline metals doping. 
However, although transition metal ions doping significantly enhances the visible light response of photocatalysts with wide band gaps, this modification strategy seems to be not suitable for Cd1−xZnxS with narrow band gaps. Alkaline metal ions doping has been proved to be a good modification strategy for oxide semiconductor photocatalysts with no influence on their band structure,199–202 but there are still no reports on the influences of alkaline metal ions doping on the photocatalytic properties of sulphide photocatalysts. Guo's group has performed alkaline metal ions doping for the modification of Cd1−xZnxS (Fig. 17). They found that Sr atoms could not be incorporated into the bulk phase by the coprecipitation method due to their bigger atomic size, and preferred to exist on the surface or near the surface of Cd1−xZnxS nanocrystals, which efficiently suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and dramatically enhanced the photocatalytic activities of these photocatalysts. It was suggested that Sr atoms existing on the surface of Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts could act as trapping centers for photo-induced electrons and holes, thus efficiently improving the separation and migration of carriers and resulting in higher photocatalytic activities.109 In order to further improve the photocatalytic activity of Cd0.8Zn0.2S photocatalysts, they tried to combine alkaline metal doping with the thermal sulfuration method, which were both proved to be beneficial for sulphide modification (Fig. 18). Due to the bigger atomic size of Ba than Cd and Zn, surface Ba doping resulted in a significant change in metal element space distribution. It was suggested that the decrease of Zn concentration from the bulk phase to the surface could provide a favorable driving force for the migration of electrons, and be beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction. Although Ba doping would not influence the light absorption property, it could induce transition of band structure from the direct to the indirect type and a significant increase in density of states at the top of the valence band, which were favorable for the migration of photo-induced carriers. As a result, Ba-doped Cd0.8Zn0.2S photocatalysts exhibited much more improved photocatalytic activities, and the highest photocatalytic activity was about 1.1 times higher than that of Cd0.8Zn0.2S, with an apparent quantum yield of 17.4% at 425 nm and an energy conversion efficiency of 0.54% in the range of 420–760 nm.110 Alkaline metal ions doping is expected to provide guidelines for the exploration of new active sulphide photocatalysts.

The movement trend of the photoluminescence intensity was almost opposite to that of photocatalytic activity.109

The decrease of Zn concentration from the bulk phase to the surface provides a favorable driving force for the migration of electrons, and surface Ba doping is also favorable for the migration of photo-induced carriers.110 

7.3. Constructing special nano-structure
As is known, point defects in semiconductors, such as vacancies and interstitial atoms, always act as recombination centres for photogenerated electrons and holes in photocatalytic water splitting. However, the role of planar defects in photocatalysis has been rarely reported up to now. II–VI group semiconductors have been extensively reported to exist as zinc-blende or wurtzite crystal structure (Fig. 5). The zinc-blende structure can be pictured as two interpenetrating cubic-close-packed lattices, one of which has been translated in the [111] direction through a distance , where ac is the cubic lattice constant. Wurtzite is composed of two interpenetrating hexagonal-close-packed lattices, one of which has been translated in the [0001] direction through a distance 3c/8, where c is the height of the hexagonal unit cell.145,203 Obviously, zinc blende and wurtzite will match perfectly in the [111-0001] direction if the value of c is equal to . Thus it is reasonable that ZnS and CdS show many polytypes consisting of periodically arranged WZ and ZB layers along the [111-0001] direction. Especially, single crystals of ZnS or CdS sometimes show planar defects, such as stacking faults and twinning, with the WZ/ZB interface along the [111-0001] direction.204
Consequently, Liu et al. introduced nano-twin structure into Cd1−xZnxS for the first time by a one pot precipitation–hydrothermal method. These as-prepared samples exhibited superior photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation without noble metal co-catalysts, especially Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocrystals show the highest activity for hydrogen evolution with an extremely high apparent quantum yield (AQY = 43%) at 425 nm, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.79 mmol h−1 without noble metals.89 It was suggested that the “back to back” potential formed by parallel nano-twins in the Cd1−xZnxS crystals can significantly improve the separation of the photogenerated electrons–holes (preventing their recombination) thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 19). Noble metals were selectively photo-deposited at central regions between the twin boundaries, which further confirmed such a mechanism.

Recently, we developed a novel two step synthesis method for sulphide photocatalysts, which consisted of ultrasonic assisted co-precipitation and solvothermal processes. ZnS and Cd1−xZnxS were present in the form of separated nano-particles in composite photocatalysts, and there were lots of defects in Cd1−xZnxS nano-particles, especially repetitive stacking faults. The highest apparent quantum yield was calculated to be 48.7% at 425 nm, which was much higher than the other non-loaded photocatalysts reported up to now. Comparative studies suggested that there was no synergistic effect between ZnS and Cd1−xZnxS, and the efficient photocatalytic activity was due to the efficient separation and migration of photo-induced electrons and holes in Cd1−xZnxS nanoparticles, which originated from the special stacking faults. We suggest that the anomalous photovoltaic effect plays an important role in the photocatalytic process. The changes in structure from cubic to hexagonal induced by stacking faults lead to a significant difference in electrostatic potential around the structure interface, and efficiently separate the photo-induced electrons and holes, thus resulting in the extremely high photocatalytic activity.205–208 These interesting findings will be published in international journals later.
Apparently, the efficient charge separation ability of planar defects (stacking faults and twinning) provides a novel modification idea for semiconductor development. If we could manually control the distribution of stacking faults and twinning in the future, photocatalysts with a much higher photocatalytic efficiency might be obtained.
7.4. Development of low-cost co-catalysts
Noble metal loading has been widely used to enhance the separation of photogenerated charges in photocatalytic water splitting. However, it is not acceptable to use these noble metals of quite high cost from the viewpoint of practical application, and therefore development of novel low-cost co-catalysts is also a key issue in the present stage. Thus lots of efforts have been made to design novel co-catalysts to further improve the photocatalytic efficiency of Cd1−xZnxS.101,209
Carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene, have attracted considerable attention because of their special structure, large specific area, extraordinary mechanical and unique electronic properties and their wide range of potential applications. In particular, they have a large electron-storage capacity, and exhibit metallic conductivity similar to metals.210,211 Thus it is believed that carbon nanotubes and graphene could be excellent cocatalysts for semiconductor photocatalysts. Yu and co-workers have systematically investigated the influences of carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on the photocatalytic activities of Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions (Fig. 20).98,102 They found that CNT content had a great influence on the photocatalytic activity, and an optimum amount of CNT was determined to be ca. 0.25 wt%, at which the CNT–Cd0.1Zn0.9S displayed the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light, giving an H2-production rate of 78.2 μmol h−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of 7.9% at 420 nm. Moreover, the optimized RGO–Zn0.8Cd0.2S photocatalyst has a high H2-production rate of 1824 μmol h−1 g−1 at the RGO content of 0.25 wt% and the apparent quantum efficiency of 23.4% at 420 nm (the energy conversion efficiency is ca. 0.36% at simulated one-sun (AM 1.5 G) illumination). These results exhibit significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production, and are better than that of the optimized Pt–Zn0.8Cd0.2S under the same reaction conditions. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was due to CNT and RGO as excellent electron acceptors and transporters, thus reducing the recombination of charge carriers and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the prepared samples were photostable and no photocorrosion was observed after photocatalytic recycling. These studies show not only the possibility of utilizing low cost carbon materials as a substitute for noble metals (such as Pt) in the photocatalytic H2-production but also a significant enhancement in the H2-production activity using metal-free carbon materials as effective co-catalysts.

8. Conclusion and perspective
We selectively summarize the main achievements of sulphide semiconductor materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production in this paper. It is encouraging that the photocatalytic efficiencies of sulphide photocatalysts have been tremendously improved during the past several decades, while significant scientific and technological knowledge has already been accumulated by researchers all around the world. However, there are still many issues and challenges remaining in this area.
8.1. Enhancement of hydrogen production efficiency
For an ideal photocatalyst suitable for industrial application, high photocatalytic efficiency in combination with excellent solar spectrum response should be achieved. Thus development of excellent sulphide photocatalysts requires narrowing the band gaps and enhancing the separation of photogenerated charges simultaneously. Sulphide semiconductors always possess excellent solar spectrum responses. Moreover, promising strategies such as doping foreign elements and making solid solution of wide band gap and narrow band gap sulphide semiconductors have been widely applied for the modification of band gaps, and the light absorption edge of sulphides can be readily extended to nearly 800 nm. Thus at the present stage the key issue of development of efficient sulphide photocatalysts lies in the enhancement of hydrogen production efficiency. As is known, the behaviour of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial for the photocatalytic process, and could be affected by many factors, such as crystallinity, crystal structure, surface states, defects and morphology. However, there is still a serious lack of deep and systematic investigations on these factors as well as their interrelationship. Thus intensive investigations should be carried out in the future, in order to provide scientific references for maximizing the photocatalytic efficiencies of sulphide semiconductors.
8.2. Cost reduction of sulphide photocatalysts
Noble metal loading on the surface of sulphide photocatalysts as co-catalysts is a useful way to accelerate the separation of photogenerated charges. For example, Pt and PdS working as dual-cocatalysts on CdS have been proved to be very effective for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. However, it is not desirable to use these noble metals of quite high cost from the viewpoint of industrial application. Therefore it is necessary to develop novel photocatalysts with low cost that could efficiently utilize the solar spectrum (both the ultraviolet region and the visible light region). Transition metal sulphides have been reported recently to be excellent co-catalysts for H2 evolution on sulphide photocatalyst systems, which provides a clue in the search for novel low cost sulphide photocatalysts. Furthermore, design of highly efficient sulphide photocatalysts without noble metal cocatalysts is also highly desired from the standpoint of practical application. Thus, highly efficient sulphide photocatalysts, which exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties without noble metal co-catalysts, have attracted much attention in recent years, such as Cd1−xZnxS, ZnS–In2S3–Ag2S. Especially, the Cd1−xZnxS solid solution photocatalyst has been studied extensively due to its controllable band structure and excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Many efforts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of Cd1−xZnxS, but it is still far from the requirement of practical application.
8.3. Strengthening stabilities of sulphide photocatalysts
Sulphide photocatalysts always suffer from photocorrosion during the photocatalytic process. Therefore sacrificial agents are needed to prevent the anodic photocorrosion by providing sacrificial electron donors to consume the photogenerated holes. However, using sacrificial reagents cannot be the ultimate solution for the stability enhancement of sulphide photocatalysts. Recently, incorporating sulphide semiconductors into the interlayers of oxide materials with layered structure or the mesopores of molecular sieves has been extensively investigated.42,212 The composite photocatalysts always result in much more improved resistance to photocorrosion. Apparently, it reveals a novel modification strategy for sulphide photocatalysts, but satisfactory photocatalytic efficiency has not been achieved until now.
8.4. Developing scale-up devices
The lack of extensive studies for a successful scale-up of the laboratory setup into an industrially relevant scale is another issue for photocatalytic hydrogen production. To directly utilize solar light in the open air, a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC)-based photocatalytic hydrogen production reactor was recently designed by Jing et al.213–215 Efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production under direct solar light was accomplished by coupling a tubular reactor with the CPC concentrator. This demonstration drew attention for further studies in this promising direction. Nevertheless, both for material and reactor design, reduction of cost will have to be given special priority, before the final utilization for semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen generation.
