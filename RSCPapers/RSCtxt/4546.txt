    , Accepted 21st May 2015First published on 21st May 2015AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 0.35 to 1.85 μm and micron-sized grains (0.5–1.5 μm) were synthesized using co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors with different deposition times. Here we have introduced a sputtered CdS buffer layer for the development of CZTS solar cells for the first time, which enables breakthrough efficiencies up to 6.6%.
Chalcogenide-based thin film photovoltaic material Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has recently attracted significant interest as a potential candidate for the massive production of solar cells on a large scale, because CZTS is composed of the earth-abundance and non-toxicity of the constituent elements. It has a near-optimum direct band gap of approximately 1.5 eV, a large absorption coefficient over 104 cm−1, and rapid improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 The theoretical PCE of a single junction CZTS device is 32.4% with Jsc = 29.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.21 V and FF = 89.9%, according to the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit.4 However, even the Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x (CZTSSe) world record efficiency of up to 12.6% is still far below the theoretical limit.5 Thus, obviously there is still plenty of room to make substantial progress towards developing low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.
CZTS solar cells have been prepared by vacuum-based-deposition, such as co-evaporation and sputtering processes, and have achieved PCEs of 8.4%6 and 6.77%,7 respectively. Several non-vacuum-based-deposition techniques, such as a hydrazine-based precursor solution approach,3,5 the sol–gel method,8,9 spray pyrolysis10 and electrodeposition,2,11–14 are also being developed for preparing high efficiency CZTS devices. Among them, electrodeposition is an attractive non-vacuum growth process due to its technical advantages for the fabrication of low-cost solar cells. For instance, its inexpensive equipment has been commercially used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips on printed circuit boards, it is easily exploited in industry on large-area substrates and electrolytes are prepared from environmentally friendly and low-cost solutions. Moreover, there is no need to use toxic solvents or ligands like hydrazine.3,5 In the pioneering work reported by Ennaoui et al., a CZTS solar cell prepared by a co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn precursor followed by sulfurization in H2S atmosphere at 550 °C for 2 h achieved a PCE of 3.4%.12 However, the major drawback of this method reported in the literature is the use of highly toxic H2S instead of sulfur powder, which is unsuitable for an industrial process in terms of both environment and security. Ahmed et al. reported a PCE of 7.3% using a CZTS based solar cell prepared by preheating of an electrodeposited Cu/Zn/Sn metallic stack followed by sulfurization at 585 °C for 12 min.2 Thus far, the champion record based on stacked electrodeposition has reached a PCE of 8% for CZTS solar cells, which were fabricated by sulfurization of preheated Cu/Zn/Sn metallic stack precursors at 590 °C for 10 min.11 Previously, we have reported that CZTS solar cells can be co-electrodeposited using different deposition potentials, yielding a PCE of 3.68%.13 Compared to the stacked electrodeposition, the co-electrodeposition process greatly simplifies the fabrication process of the CZTS precursor. In this report, a champion co-electrodeposited CZTS solar cell with a PCE of 6.6% is fabricated.
Generally, cadmium sulfide (CdS) with a large bandgap of 2.4 eV is the most promising buffer layer for CZTS/CdS heterojunctions in devices, and the highest conversion efficiencies have been achieved using the chemical bath deposition of CdS thin films (CBD–CdS thicknesses in the range of 25–120 nm2–9,11–15). However, the n-type CdS layer deposited by CBD causes some serious environmental problems due to the large amount of cadmium-containing waste during the CBD process. In this regard, we present radio-frequency (RF) sputtering to process a CdS layer, which is suitable to reduce the environmental impact and can enhance the continuity of the deposition processes so that thin film solar cells can be manufactured by an in-line process for massive production. So far, the sputtered CdS buffer layer for a CZTS solar cell in device performance has not been demonstrated. In this work, we have systematically studied the influence of deposition time on the properties of CZTS thin films, and have demonstrated the successful use of a sputtered CdS buffer layer for CZTS based solar cells with efficiencies as high as those fabricated using CBD–CdS.2,4,8 The results offer new research directions for solving persistent challenges of CBD–CdS in CZTS photovoltaics.

Fig. 1a shows XRD patterns of all the films derived from sulfurization of precursors co-electrodeposited for various durations. Besides the diffraction peak from Mo substrates, the main peaks of the sulfurized CZTS films at approximately 2θ = 18.20, 28.53, 32.98, 47.33 and 56.17° match very well with the diffraction of the (101), (112), (200), (220) and (312) crystal planes of the kesterite structure CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575) with a preferred grain orientation along the (112) direction.4 The intensity of all the diffraction peaks becomes relatively more intense and sharper with increasing deposition time, indicating the expected increase in crystals with larger grains (Fig. 2). However, it should be noted that XRD diffraction peaks cannot unambiguously distinguish other common secondary phases such as ZnS and Cu2SnS3.

 Fig. 2  Surface and cross sectional SEM images of the sulfurized CZTS films deposited for different durations: (a, f) CZTS(05), (b, g) CZTS(10), (c, h) CZTS(20), (d, i) CZTS(30) and (e, j) CZTS(40). 
Therefore, Raman spectroscopy was utilized to obtain further phase identification, and the results of the CZTS films are compared in Fig. 1b. All CZTS films exhibit the main peaks at 249, 287, 337, 349 and 368 cm−1, which can be assigned to the kesterite CZTS structure.9 Raman spectra also reveal the presence of MoS2 with an extremely weak peak at around 407 cm−1 in the CZTS(05) film from the relatively short deposition time,13 but no layer could be resolved by SEM. Besides, the MoS2 Raman signal for the CZTS(10, 20, 30 and 40) films from the relatively long deposition times is not observed, this can be explained by the fact that the effective penetration depth of the Raman scattering technique with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm is limited and a MoS2 layer at the bottom layer near thicker CZTS films possibly may not be detected by a 532 nm laser. No unidentified secondary phases are observed by either XRD or Raman measurements, demonstrating well-crystallized and single phase CZTS films.

Fig. 2 shows surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the sulfurized CZTS films. It is clear that there are notable differences in grain sizes ranging from 0.5 μm for CZTS(05), 0.8 μm for CZTS(10), 1.1 μm for CZTS(20), 1.2 μm for CZTS(30) to 1.5 μm for CZTS(40). The longer the deposition time, the larger the grain size. It implies the significant improvement of the grain size of CZTS thin films, which is consistent with XRD and Raman spectrum analyses. Large grains generally benefit device performance due to less opportunity for recombination of photogenerated carriers at the grain boundaries.2 Moreover, the surface roughness of the films seems to show the same trend: the longer the deposition time, the rougher the film surface. This result is expected as a larger grain size normally results in a rougher surface. The relatively flat surface films may be beneficial to the formation of CZTS/CdS heterojunctions and thus reduce the interface combination of charge carriers.13
The cross-sectional images of the CZTS films are shown in Fig. 2(f–j). The thickness of the films increases quasi-linearly from 0.35 μm for the CZTS(05) film to 0.8 μm, 1.1 μm, 1.2 μm and 1.85 μm for CZTS(10, 20, 30 and 40) films, respectively. The MoS2 layer is not observed between the CZTS film and the Mo back contact interface. When the deposition time increases from 5 to 10 min, uniform fine grains with homogeneous and densely-packed morphology are formed and shown in Fig. 2(f and g). However, upon further increasing the deposition time above 20 min, the films consist of a bi-layered structure: a large-grain top layer and a small-grain bottom layer are shown in Fig. 2(h–j). The small-grain bottom layer indicates that sufficient sulfurization is not achieved, this can be explained by the fact that sulfur is difficultly incorporated into the relatively thick CZTS precursors to form CZTS(20, 30 and 40) films with severely S-poor compared with CZTS(05 and 10) films with obviously S-rich, as presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The small-grain sizes are generally deleterious to device performance due to increased opportunity for recombination between neighboring small particles. Hence, it would be an optimum sulfurization temperature and/or sulfurization duration to achieve a homogeneous and large densely packed grains for CZTS absorbers.
The chemical compositions of all sulfurized CZTS films are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The contents of Cu, Zn and Sn increase while that of S decreases in all CZTS films, which reveals that S is sufficiently incorporated into very thin films to form CZTS during sulfurization. The (05 and 10) films are non-stoichiometry, which may result from the high population of intrinsic defects. Interestingly, the CZTS(20 and 30) films have Cu-poor and Zn-rich growth conditions which may give superior photovoltaic performance.3,5,11 However, for the CZTS(40) film, it is Cu-rich and Zn-rich, and the compositional deviation from stoichiometry is not severe.
The comparison of current–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the CZTS solar cells using two different thickly sputtered CdS buffer layers (150 nm and 170 nm) are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S1a (ESI†). Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†) show their parameters in J–V characteristics. A short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.0 mA cm−2 is obtained from the CZTS(20) cell with a CdS thickness of 150 nm. This reaches the highest Jsc ever reported for CZTS solar cells.2 When compared with Jsc (18.2 mA cm−2) of the CZTS(20) cell with a 170 nm thick CdS buffer layer, the relative Jsc enhancement for the CZTS(20) cell with a 150 nm thick CdS buffer layer is ∼20%. Such an increase in Jsc may be attributed to the light below 520 nm easily passing through the relatively thin sputtered CdS into the CZTS absorber, as seen in EQE analysis (Fig. 3b and Fig. S1b (ESI†)). As deposition time increases, CZTS(20) and CZTS(30) solar cells have the best efficiency of 6.6%. The improvement originates from the increase of Jsc from 4.1 to 22.0 mA cm−2, Voc from 133.2 to 581.4 mV and a fill factor (FF) from 25.1 to and 57.2%. The significant improvement of Voc, Jsc and FF can be mainly attributed to the increment in the suitable thickness of the CZTS absorbers with large grains in combination with the SEM results shown in Fig. 2. Upon further increasing the deposition time to 30 min, the larger grain results in higher Voc; however, the efficiency is not obviously improved. This is due to the decrease in Jsc, which counterbalances the increase in Voc. A possible cause for a low Jsc value obtained in CZTS(30) solar cells is due to the small-grain bottom layer which becomes thicker, as shown in Fig. 2. When the deposition time increases from 20 to 30 min, Voc improves from 567.0 to 581.4 mV. It is well known that Voc ∝ (AkT/q)ln(Jsc/Jo), where A, kT/q and Jo are the diode ideality factor, thermal voltage and reverse saturation current, respectively. Table S2 (ESI†) shows that Jo values of CZTS(20) and CZTS(30) films are 5.93 × 10−4 and 9.33 × 10−5 mA cm−2, respectively. Voc is inversely proportional to Jo and thus CZTS(30) has a bigger Voc value than that of CZTS(20). Moreover, the Rsh value of CZTS(30) is relatively higher than that of CZTS(20), as seen in Table S2 (ESI†). Consequently higher Rsh can also give rise to higher Voc. The CZTS solar cell obtained from the CZTS(30) absorber gives the best η value of 6.6% with Voc (581.4 mV), Jsc (19.9 mA cm−2), fill factor (FF = 57.2%) and series resistance (Rs = 5.3 Ω cm2), respectively. This is the highest reported efficiency obtained for a co-electrodeposited CZTS solar cell to date. However, the low shunt resistance (Rsh = 282.8 Ω cm2) comparable with that reported for a champion electrodeposited CZTS solar cell2 indicates that there may be some leaks or a voltage-dependent current collection in the device. The cross-over behavior observed in the electrodeposited,2 hydrazine-processed3 and co-evaporated6 CZTS devices might be associated with the presence of an electrical barrier either in the buffer/absorber interface or in the back contact.16 Therefore, it is suggested that this barrier is highly likely responsible for higher series resistance in the devices.

It is clear that the J–V curve of the CZTS(05) solar cell exhibits an almost ohmic behavior with low η, Voc, Jsc and FF values, as shown in Fig. 3a. As discussed above, a very thin CZTS absorber with a small grain size should induce significant cell leakage current. On the other hand, CZTS(10) and CZTS(20) solar cells have appreciable performance. The CZTS(20) solar cell exhibits better performance, with η of 6.6%, Jsc of 22.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 567.0 mV and FF of 52.8%, than that of the CZTS(10) cell (η = 3.3%, Jsc = 15.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 453.1 mV and FF = 47.1%). As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the J–V curve of the CZTS(10) solar cell shows relatively poor electrical rectification with a low Rsh (117.3 Ω cm2) and a high Rs (9.9 Ω cm2). The thinner CZTS(10) film (Fig. 2g) leads to the generation of an appreciable shunt pass: the low Rsh significantly reduces Voc. Moreover, the resulting high Rs leads to a drop in the FF value as well as a decrease in Jsc. In contrast, the CZTS(20) solar cell shows relatively good electrical rectification, as can be seen in Fig. 3a. Significant improvement in Voc is due to the appropriately thick CZTS absorber and large grain size, which leads to suppression of shunting: it has a relatively high Rsh (183.1 Ω cm2). The enhancement of Jsc and FF are directly related to the decrease in Rs (5.9 Ω cm2). The solar cells (C1–15) are other devices in the CZTS(20) and CZTS(30) samples which are close to the best CZTS solar cell (6.6%) listed in Table S4 (ESI†). This result indicates a relatively well-controlled composition distribution in the CZTS absorber. Compared to the CZTS(20) solar cell, the characteristics of the CZTS(40) solar cell is limited by low Jsc, Voc and FF possibly due to the very thick CZTS absorber and a rather rougher surface increasing the interface combination of charge carriers and an obvious bi-layered structure with small grains leading to the shunting path between the CZTS and the Mo electrode shown in Fig. 2j. The effect of deposition time on absorber properties and device performance has been confirmed by different batches of repeated experiments.

Fig. 3b and Fig. S1b (ESI†) show the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding CZTS solar cells with two different thickly sputtered CdS films as a function of photon wavelength. When the deposition time increases from 5 to 20 min, the maximum EQEs for CZTS solar cells increase from ∼3% to ∼85% at 560 nm (Fig. 3b). The band gap of CZTS(20) extracted from the EQE data is about 1.48 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is close to that of the reported kesterite CZTS device.4 The EQE value of the CZTS(20) solar cell with a CdS thickness of 150 nm is higher than that with a CdS thickness of 170 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is consistent with the higher Jsc shown in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The loss in the EQE for wavelengths below ∼520 nm is caused by the absorption in the CdS layer, showing the large potential for further improvement in Jsc and η by properly reducing the thickness of the CdS layer. This result is similar to the semi-empirical optical modeling done for CZTSSe solar cells.15 On the other hand, in the wavelength region from 520 to 1000 nm, the EQE value of the CZTS solar cell from the CZTS(20) absorber is higher than that from other absorbers. This can be explained by the fact that the CZTS(20) absorber from a relatively long deposition time has better quality: larger grains with less grain boundaries, no obvious bi-layered structure and a suitable absorption thickness. The EQEs in the visible range gradually decays for a longer wavelength. The loss at a longer wavelength is likely caused by a short minority carrier diffusion length.2,3,14
In conclusion, high-performance CZTS solar cells with a maximum η of 6.6% have been fabricated by a sputtered CdS buffer layer for the first time. It is found that the increase in deposition time from 5 to 30 min can quasi-linearly increase the thickness and micron-sized grains, significantly improving the crystallinity of the absorber, greatly reducing the series resistance, and consequently improving the device efficiency greatly by increasing Jsc and Voc. However, upon further increasing the deposition time to 40 min, the excessive increase in the thickness of the CZTS absorber leads to some degradation in different device parameters. It is necessary to control the electrodeposition time to ensure a CZTS absorber with a large grain size and appropriate film thickness.
