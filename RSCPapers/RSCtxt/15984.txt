    , Accepted 1st May 2018First published on 2nd May 2018AbstractAcceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A)-types of small molecules are very promising nonfullerene acceptors to overcome the drawbacks of fullerene derivatives such as the weak absorption ability and electronic adjustability. However, only few attempts have been made to develop π-bridge units to construct highly efficient acceptors in OSCs. Herein, taking the reported acceptor P1 as a reference, five small-structured acceptors (P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6) have been designed via the replacement of the π-bridge unit. A combination of quantum chemistry and Marcus theory approaches is employed to investigate the effect of different π-bridge units on the optical, electronic, and charge transport properties of P1–P6. The calculation results show that the designed molecules P2 and P5 can become potential acceptor replacements of P1 due to their red-shifted absorption bands, appropriate energy levels, low exciton binding energy, and high electron affinity and electron mobility. Additionally, compared with P3HT/P1, P3HT/P2 and P3HT/P5 exhibit stronger and wider absorption peaks, larger electron transfer distances (DCT), greater transferred charge amounts (Δq), and smaller overlaps (Λ), which shows that P2 and P5 have more significant electron transfer characteristics and favorable exciton dissociation capabilities for enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC) and thus, they are potential acceptors in OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have several technological superiorities when compared with their inorganic counterparts; their advantages include ease of processing, lightweightedness, flexibility, and cost-effective mass production.1–3 Among various OSC devices, a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell is commonly composed of a p-type material as the electron donor and an n-type material (fullerene-based derivative, conjugated polymer or organic semiconductor) as the electron acceptor.4 At present, most BHJ solar cells use fullerene derivatives as the acceptors and produce high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% due to the relatively high electron affinity, adequate band gaps, isotropic charge transport properties, and good interaction of fullerene with donor materials.1,5–7 However, fullerene acceptors have some disadvantages including invariable energy levels, high synthetic costs, relatively weak absorption ability in the red and near-infrared regions, complicated purification processes, and chemical/morphological instability.8–10 These issues have led to a quick development of new donor and acceptor materials to obtain high-performance of BHJ solar cells. In comparison to the numerous studies about electron donors,11–13 the development of nonfullerene acceptors is far behind.
Nonfullerene acceptors mainly include small organic molecules1,2,4,14–20 and polymer acceptors.21–26 It is rather remarkable that perylene diimide (PDI),23,27 naphthalene diimide (NDI),4 and B ← N moiety-based polymer acceptors28–30 have primarily improved the properties of OSCs. For instance, the nonfullerene polymer-based solar cell of PBDB-T:IT-M produces PCE of over 12%, and this value has exceeded PCEs of fullerene-based OSCs.31 Compared with polymer acceptors, small molecule acceptors have many merits: mechanical flexibility, wide and efficient absorption, facile synthesis, and better tunable energy levels.1,2,14 Hence, more efforts have made to exploit small molecule acceptors. A large number of A–π–D–π–A-type nonfullerene small molecule acceptors have been synthesized and reported based on various π-conjugated moieties such as PDI,1,4 NDI32 and more recently, rhodanines.16,33 For example, Zhu et al. recently reported an OSC based on an ATT-1 acceptor, which achieved a high PCE of 10.07%.34 Chen et al. synthesized a novel electron acceptor (NFBDT) and PBDBT-T as a donor, and the device based on NFBDT and PBDBT-T showed a high efficiency of 10.42%.3 In 2014, Lim and co-workers synthesized a new small molecule Flu-RH, and the organic photovoltaic devices based on Flu-RH as an acceptor and P3HT as a donor yielded a PCE of 3.08%.35 In 2015 and 2016, Holliday and co-workers developed new small molecules of FBR36 and O-IDTBR,37 respectively. PCE of OSC based on FBR as an acceptor and P3HT as a donor is 4.1%.36 For P3HT:O-IDTBR devices, the PCE is 6.4%,37 and this is the highest PCE for nonfullerene acceptor devices with P3HT as the donor.
There are already many studies on design and synthesis of new D or A building blocks.31,37,38 However, studies focusing on π-bridge units between D and A units are few, which affords a new idea to improve the property of OSCs. In this paper, we focus on investigating the effect of different π-bridge units on the ground state geometry, optoelectronic and electron transport properties, and performance of A–π–D–π–A nonfullerene small molecule acceptors in the active layers. Herein, based on O-IDTBR (P1),37 which contains an indacenodithiophene core, benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT), and 3-ethylrhodanine, we replace the π-bridge BT unit with other π-bridges such as [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine39 (TP), [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-d]pyridazine40 (TY), [1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine41 (OP), [1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-d]pyridazine42 (OY), and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5-carbonitrile (BTC) units, and we design five novel small molecule acceptors (P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6). Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. From the strategy of molecular design mentioned above, we have focused on the issue of the effect of π electron-withdrawing moiety in small molecular acceptors on the optical absorption and electron transport ability of OSC devices. Irrespective of the kind of design strategy, improvements in the optical absorption and electron transport ability of the acceptor materials in the OSC devices are the ultimate targets. The geometric structure, electronic properties, and optical absorption are calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. We also investigate the electron transport properties of P1–P6 molecules. In addition, referring to the representative p-type polymer P3HT as the donor material,37 the energetic driving force between the donors and acceptors and the performance of small molecule acceptors in the active layers are also investigated to provide an in-depth insight into the performance of OSCs. Herein, our calculations can provide a theoretical model for analyzing how the different π-bridge groups between the donor and acceptor groups affect the photovoltaic properties of OSCs.

Computational methods
The ground-state geometries of P1–P6 were fully optimized using the DFT method43 with B3LYP,44 PBE0,45 and HSE0646,47 functionals at the 6-311G(d,p)48,49 basis set. To save the computational costs and simplify the calculations, the branched alkyl chains in the molecules were replaced by methyl groups because of their slight influence on the frontier molecular orbitals and optoelectronic properties of the molecules.50,51 Solvent effects of chlorobenzene were taken into account within the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).52 The calculated vibrational frequencies at the optimized geometries showed no imaginary frequency, indicating that they are the minima on the potential energy surface. In this study, unrestricted DFT was used to optimize the ion-state geometries. As shown in Table 1, the calculated EHOMO value of P1 at the PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level (−5.51 eV) was in good agreement with the experimental value (−5.53 eV).37 Similarly, the computed LUMO energy (−3.82 eV) of P1 was taken from KS (Kohn–Sham), and it was in good agreement with the reported experimental value (−3.88 eV).37 Previous studies have proven that the PBE0 method is suitable for describing the structures and properties of sulfur-bearing molecules.53–58 Hence, the ground-state properties of the six molecules in this study were calculated at the PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level. The energies of electron affinity (EA) and reorganization energy (λ) were calculated at the PBE0/6-311+G(d,p) level based on the optimized geometries at the PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level.

To obtain the most reliable method for calculating absorption spectra, the absorption spectrum of P1 was calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with different methods of B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE06 with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set on the basis of the optimized ground-state geometries with the corresponding methods and basis set. According to the results shown in Table 2, the TD-PBE0/6-311G(d,p) method can yield a more accurate absorption peak (729 nm) of P1, which is in accordance with the experimental result of 690 nm.37 Hence, the optical properties of all six molecules were calculated at the TD-PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level.

The molecular crystal structure was predicted by using the polymorph predictor module in Materials Studio.59 A single molecule was optimized by the DMol3 module, and electrostatic potential charges of all atoms were obtained.60,61 The polymorph calculations were restricted to the five most probable space groups P21/C, P1, P212121, C2/C, and P21.60,61 The crystal structures in terms of their total energies were sorted. Then, the crystal structure prediction was carried out by employing the PBE functional and the Dreiding force field.62 The obtained crystal structures with the lowest energies were selected for further calculations on their charge mobilities. The transfer integrals of P1–P6 were obtained using a direct approach at the M06-2X-D3/6-311G(d,p) level.63–66 The donor P3HT and the acceptor blends (P3HT/P1–P6) were fully optimized at the M06-2X-D3/6-311G(d,p) level. The absorption spectra of all the interface models were simulated at the TD-M06-2X-D3/6-311G(d,p) level. All the above-mentioned calculations were carried out using Gaussian09 package.67
The Marcus–Hush theory with the hopping model is widely employed to estimate the charge transfer rate constant (kCT) between the neighboring sites:68 (1)here, h, υ, kB, T, and λ are the Planck's constant, the electronic coupling between the initial and final states, the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and reorganization energy, respectively.
The inner reorganization energy (λ) was calculated from the adiabatic potential energy surface:47,69,70 λ = (E−0 − E−) + (E0− − E0)(2)here, E0 and E− are the energies of the neutral and anion segments in their lowest energy geometries, respectively. E0− is the energy of the neutral segment at the anion state, and E−0 is the energy of the anion segment with the neutral optimized geometry.
The charge transfer integral (υ) shows the electron coupling between two neighboring molecules. υ can be expressed as follows:66,71,72 υ = 〈ψLUMOi|F|ψLUMOf〉(3)here, F represents the Kohn–Sham–Fock matrix of the dimer, which includes two fragments ψLUMOi and ψLUMOf and these are the LUMOs of two fragments.
The electron mobility (μ) of the molecules was calculated by utilizing Einstein equation:50 (4)here, e and kB are the electronic charge and the Boltzmann's constant, respectively, and D is the diffusion coefficient,73 which can be evaluated approximately by the following equation:74 (5)here, i and ri are the given transfer pathway and the charge hopping centroid-to-centroid distance, respectively. d (d = 3) is defined as spatial dimensionality, and pi (pi = ki/∑ki) is the relative probability for charge hopping to a particular ith neighbor.
Moreover, the electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange for the six molecular acceptor dimers and all P3HT/P1–P6 systems were calculated. The total electron density difference (∑∂i→j) after photoexcitation between the starting and final states could be defined as the sum of all molecular orbital transitions including each participating excitation i → j (i and j are the starting and final molecular orbitals, respectively.):69,75 (6)here, Ci→j expresses the orthogonal coefficient of the TD-DFT equation. ρi and ρj represent the electron densities of each participating molecular orbital with respect to the transitions. (7)Here, ηi, χ, and C are the occupation numbers of orbital i, the basis function, and the coefficient matrix, respectively. The factor of ith row jth column is equal to the expansion coefficient of orbital j with respect to the basis function χ. The electron density differences between the starting and the final states are the linear combination of various electron transition models.76 All results about the electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange can be obtained using the cubman utility supplied by the Gaussian 09 and Multiwfn programs.77 In addition, the two functions ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be used for describing the increase and decrease in the density owing to the electronic transition. The centroids of spatial regions defined by ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be expressed as follows:75 (8)and (9)The charge transfer distance (DCT) can be written as follows: DCT = |R+ − R−|(10)The fraction (q) of electron exchange can be defined as follows: (11)In the cases of dimer and P3HT/P1–P6, the dispersion corrections were considered using the empirical formula by Grimme et al. (i.e., DFT-D3).78
Results and discussion
Molecular structures in the ground state
Molecular geometries significantly impact the electronic properties, optical absorptions, intermolecular π–π stacking charge transfers, and electron mobility of organic functional materials.14,79 Hence, it is crucial to analyze the electronic structure first. The optimized ground-state structures of P1–P6 and the key geometry parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively.

The bridge bonds defined as the bonds between each molecular unit such as electron-donating fragment (D), electron-accepting unit (A), and π-bridge in a molecule supply an account of the interactions among them.80 As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the selected bridge bond lengths (Li) of a carbon–carbon bond (C–C) for P1–P6 (1.35–1.44 Å) are longer than a typical CC double bond (1.33 Å) and shorter than a typical C–C single bond (1.54 Å); this exhibits double-bond character due to π-bonding interaction, thereby strengthening and shortening the bridge bond. Fig. 2 and Table S1 show the calculated values of dihedral angles (φ1–φ6) of P1–P5 in the range of 0°–5.44°, which means that they have good coplanar configuration, and this may contribute to the red-shifting of the absorption as well as an increase in the tendency to crystallize on length scales matching with those of charge separation and extraction. The values of φ1–φ6 in P6 are significantly larger than those of P1–P5 due to the steric effect of the electron-withdrawing CN group substituted onto benzothiadiazole.
Frontier molecular orbitals
For the OSC devices, one of the basic factors for ideal acceptors is that they should have suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels matching with those of the donors to guarantee efficient exciton splitting and charge dissociation at the interface.26,81 Moreover, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and energy gaps have a very close relation to the electronic properties, optical absorptions, and carrier transport properties, which influence the OSC efficiency.82,83 Therefore, the HOMO/LUMO energies and molecular energy gaps of P1–P6 are calculated and summarized in Fig. 3. The corresponding contour plots of these orbitals are illustrated in Fig. 4, where the contribution to the corresponding orbital from the π-bridge conjugation on the molecular orbitals obtained from the analysis of partial density of states is also presented.

 Fig. 4  The contour plots of HOMO and LUMO orbitals and corresponding contributions of π-bridge conjugation on the molecular orbitals for P1–P6. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO/LUMO energies of P1 (−5.53 eV/−3.82 eV) agree well with the experimental values (−5.51 eV/−3.88 eV).37 Compared with those of P1, all the HOMO and LUMO energies of P2–P6 decrease. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Eg,TD) are in the order of P1 (1.71 eV) > P6 (1.70 eV) > P2 (1.64 eV) = P3 (1.64 eV) > P5 (1.61 eV) > P4 (1.60 eV). The above-mentioned results indicate that the π-bridge group has a significant influence on the modulation of energy levels. For example, by substituting the carbon atoms on the π-bridge unit in P1 by more strongly electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms in P2 can lower the HOMO/LUMO energies and Eg,TD. The lower Eg,TD values of P2–P6 compared to that of P1 indicate that the newly designed acceptors (P2–P6) may enhance the short-circuit density (JSC) of OSC, because lower energy gap generates broader absorption range.
In an OSC device, an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:acceptor/MoO3/Ag is most commonly used.37 The key factors are that the energy levels of acceptors should match with those of the donor P3HT to ensure efficient electron transfer from P3HT to the acceptors. Herein, we assume that ITO/ZnO is a cathode in the OSC device. The LUMOs of acceptors (P1–P6) are higher than the Fermi energy level of ITO (−4.7 eV),84 and the HOMOs are lower than that of P3HT (−3.2 eV),37 indicating that the energy levels of P1–P6 as acceptors match well with the corresponding Fermi energies of the ITO electrode and the HOMO energy level of P3HT. The LUMO energies of are all below −4.0 eV, which shows that P2–P6 are all air-stable electron-transporting semiconductors. Compared with PC60BM, the typical acceptor mostly used in OSCs with a LUMO energy level of −4.3 eV,85 the acceptors P2–P6 with higher LUMO energies are beneficial to improve VOC of the OSC devices because the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is directly related to VOC. In addition, to dissociate excitons at the interface of P3HT/P1–P6, there should be an adequate driving force (ΔEL–L), which is the energy difference between the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor. The value of ΔEL–L should be greater than 0.3 eV to guarantee charge separation at the P3HT/P1–P6 interface. As shown in Table 4, the values of ΔEL–L between P3HT and P1–P6 are all larger than 0.3 eV, which can ensure that electrons can transfer efficiently through P3HT/P1–P6 heterojunctions.
From Fig. 4, we can see that the HOMOs of P1–P6 are delocalized on the whole π-conjugated backbone, and the LUMOs are mainly centralized on a more electron-deficient unit. With an increase in the electron-withdrawing capacity of the π-bridge groups, the contribution (in Fig. 4) of the π-bridge groups in the HOMO decreases slightly, and the contribution in the LUMO increases. Hence, the fact that the FMO energy levels of P2–P6 are lower than that of P1 may be ascribed mainly to the increase in the electron-deficiency of the π-bridge unit.
Spectral absorption
Numerous studies on OSCs have indicated that absorbing photons is a key step to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) in the device, and the absorption spectra of the acceptors should match the solar spectrum as much as possible.86–89 Hence, for better understanding the photo-physical process, discussion of the photoexcitation properties of small molecular acceptors is important. The optical parameters including the electronic transition energy Eg (eV), maximum absorption wavelength λ (nm), the largest oscillator strength (f), and main configuration are listed in Table 3. The simulated Gaussian-type absorption spectra of P1–P6 are shown in Fig. 5 (where the first 50 excited states are considered).

 Fig. 5  Simulated absorption spectra of P1–P6. 
As seen in Fig. 5 and Table 3, the calculated absorption peak (729 nm for P1) is in reasonable agreement with the experimental datum (690 nm).37 The maximum absorptions of P1–P6 resulting mainly from the HOMO → LUMO transitions are in the sequence of P5 (783 nm) > P4 (778 nm) > P3 (764 nm) > P2 (738 nm)> P1 (629 nm), which indicates that with the enhanced electron-withdrawing ability of the π-bridge units, P2–P5 can yield red-shifted absorption wavelengths in comparison with P1. By replacing carbon and oxygen atoms with nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the conjugated π-bridge units, P5 exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 783 nm with a bathochromic shift of 54 nm compared with P1, which is due to the much stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the OY unit than that of the BT unit. The above-mentioned results indicate that the replacement of the BT group in the π-bridge part with TP, TY, OP, OY, and BTC units has a significant influence on the modulation of absorption spectrum. Consequently, the analysis of optical and electronic properties implies that the molecules P2–P6 exhibit better performances in comparison with P1 for OSCs as a result of their red-shifted absorptions in the visible and near-infrared regions of the solar spectrum.
Exciton binding energy and electronic affinity
In the OSC devices, the structure of the active layer (donor–acceptor blends) is a key factor to achieve the light-to-electricity conversion.87,90–92 According to the working mechanism in the OSC devices, the acceptor harvests sunlight to generate excitons, which separate into holes and electrons. Then, the holes of the separated excitons can transfer from the HOMO of the acceptor to the HOMO of the donor at the D/A interface.14,93 To achieve efficient hole and electron transport, the electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into fully separated free charges by overcoming an exciton binding energy (Eb).94 Here, Eb is the energy difference between the electronic and optical band gap energies.76,94 The electronic band gap is the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO in the ground state, and the optical gap is taken as the first singlet excitation energy. Additionally, a good acceptor for OSCs must have high tendency to accept electrons. Electronic affinity (EA) can be used to evaluate the energy barrier for injection of electrons. To achieve an acceptable performance, the acceptor must have high electron affinity to permit effective injection of electrons into the empty LUMO of the semiconductor molecules and to facilitate exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface for OSC applications.7,23 Electron affinity of an n-type material needs to be at the lowest value of 3.0 eV for an easy electron injection.95,96 The exciton binding energy (Eb), the vertical electron affinities (vEA), and adiabatic electron affinities (aEA) of P1–P6 are listed in Table 4.

A previous study has shown that a charge carrier becomes free from the coulombic attraction of an opposite charge when Eb < kBT, which amounts to 0.025 eV at room temperature.97 The Eb values in Table 4 show that the photoproduced excitons in P1–P6 are quite stable and can be effectively delivered to the acceptor interface without quick decay in the transport process. Compared with P1, P2–P5 have smaller Eb values, indicating that it is easier to split P2–P5 into free charge carriers.
As shown in Table 4, the vEA/aEV values of P1–P6 are higher than 3.0 eV. Thus, the electron affinities of P1–P6 are high enough to allow efficient injection of electrons into the empty LUMOs of the semiconductor molecules; also, P1–P6 may be air-stable. The values of vEA/aEV are in the sequence of P5 > P3 > P2 > P6 > P1 > P4. Normally, the higher the EA value of the electron transport layer, the easier the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor.96 Hence, P2, P3, P5, and P6 have better electron-acceptor properties in comparison with P1. Consequently, the increase in electron-withdrawing ability of the π-bridge units for P2–P6 can further strengthen exciton dissociation ability at the donor/acceptor interface.
Combining the above-mentioned two aspects (Eb and EA), it can be seen that the acceptors P2, P3, and P5 have more significant charge transfer characteristics and favorable exciton separation capabilities than P1 in OSCs.
Properties of the D/A active layers
The active layer with the arrangement of D/A blends is a key factor to influence PCE.81,98 In fact, the donor and the acceptor are blended to form an interpenetrating network in the active layer.60 However, the construction of theoretical models of the D/A blend is a gargantuan challenge due to the lack of sufficient experimental support. In this study, we use a favorable face-to-face model of the P3HT/P1–P6 active layers conducting a large intermolecular electronic coupling. Two planes of the donor P3HT and the acceptors are perpendicular to the line across the mass-center of D/A fragments. Much attention should be paid to ensure that there is more extended morphology of donor–acceptor blends for π-stacking between the polymer donor P3HT and small molecular acceptors. To obtain the optimized mass-center distances between the P3HT donor and the small molecular acceptors, the potential energy curves of the mass-center distances are calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311G(d,p) level, and the obtained energy profiles with respect to the D/A distances are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The P3HT/P1–P6 blends are fully optimized starting from the minimum energy point. The optimal structures of P3HT/P1–P6 are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The optimized distances of the donor–acceptor blends for P3HT/P1–P6 are 3.41 Å, 3.35 Å, 3.43 Å, 3.40 Å, 3.35 Å, and 3.53 Å, respectively.
Based on the optimized structures of the donor–acceptor blends, the calculated densities of states (DOS) and projected densities of states (PDOS) (see Fig. S3 and Table S2, ESI†) indicate which segments are involved in the electronic transition orbitals of the active layers. The contour plots of the HOMOs and LUMOs of P1–P6 illustrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show that the HOMO is mainly localized on the electron donor P3HT, whereas the LUMOs are almost localized on electron acceptors P1–P6. Hence, the HOMO → LUMO transitions of the donor–acceptor blends are intermolecular transfers from P3HT to the n-type acceptors P1–P6.
As is well-known, the light absorption range and intensity of the active layer are directly related to JSC,99 which is one of the three key parameters (VOC, JSC, and FF) influencing PCE of OSC devices.79 The optical parameters of these donor/acceptor active layers are listed in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). The simulated Gaussian-type absorption spectra of P3HT/P1–P6 are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) (where the first 30 excited states are considered).
We can see that there are clear differences between the results produced by the M06-2X-D3 method (Table S3, ESI†) and the PBE0 method (Table S4, ESI†) due to the lack of consideration of dispersion forces in the PBE0 method. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the order of the maximum absorptions for the blends is P3HT/P6 (428 nm) < P3HT/P3 (433 nm) < P3HT/P5 (435 nm) < P3HT/P1 (436 nm) < P3HT/P2 (443 nm) < P3HT/P4 (554 nm). The maximum absorptions of the donor–acceptor blends for P3HT/P2 and P3HT/P4 are red-shifted and more intense in comparison with those of P3HT/P1. As shown in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†), the main configurations responsible for the transitions of P3HT/P1–P6 result from HOMO → LUMO+2, HOMO−3 → LUMO, HOMO → LUMO+3, HOMO → LUMO+2, and HOMO → LUMO+4. Table S2 (ESI†) also shows that the donor P3HT participates in the electronic transition absorption of the active layers, and the acceptors P1–P6 also clearly involved. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows that the D/A blends of P2–P6 can yield more intense and broader light absorptions than those of P1 in the visible and near-infrared region (550–700 nm). The above-mentioned discussions and results clearly indicate that P3HT/P2, P3HT/P4, and P3HT/P5 have better optical properties within the visible and near-infrared regions in comparison with P3HT/P1, which provides more efficient sunlight absorption for improving JSC; thus, P2, P4, and P5 are good candidates for acceptors in OSC applications.
The electron of the donor or acceptor is excited to produce an exciton when light with suitable wavelength is incident on them and then, the generated exciton moves to the donor/acceptor interface and dissociates into free charge.100 In this process, we expect that more electrons (holes) should move from donor (acceptor) to acceptor (donor) because efficient intermolecular charge transfer (CT) at the D/A interface can improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) or JSC.100
To further analyze CT in these molecules, herein, electron difference density (EDD) maps are utilized to estimate CT properties of these molecules from the ground state to the excited state. The electron transfer distance (D), transferred charge amount (Δq), and overlaps between the regions of density depletion and increment (Λ) in the transitions of the P3HT/P1–P6 complexes are listed in the EDD maps (see Fig. 6) of intermolecular CT excited states.
 Fig. 6  Electron density difference plots of electronic transitions for P3HT/P1–P6 systems. DCT is the electron transfer distance (Å), Λ denotes the overlap between the regions of density depletion and increment, and Δq is the fraction of electron exchange (|e−|). Electron densities transfer from the light green area to the purple area. 
From the EDD maps depicted in Fig. 6, it can be seen that the listed excited states are not pure CT states, since electrons and holes are localized on the donor and acceptor. The calculated data in Fig. 6 also show that P3HT/P2–P6 exhibits an increase in the electron transfer distance (DCT) and the transferred charge amount (Δq) and a decrease in the overlap (Λ) in comparison with P3HT/P1. The larger values of D and Δq and smaller value of Λ are beneficial for enhancing JSC of OSCs. These results indicate the increasing electron transfer efficiency of OSCs. The order of the transferred charge amounts (Δq) is P3HT/P6 > P3HT/P4 > P3HT/P5 > P3HT/P3 > P3HT/P2 > P3HT/P1. The order of Λ is P3HT/P1 > P3HT/P4 > P3HT/P3 > P3HT/P2 > P3HT/P5 > P3HT/P6. In addition, the electron transfer distance (DCT) values for P3HT/P1, P3HT/P2, P3HT/P3, P3HT/P4, P3HT/P5, and P3HT/P6 are 0.194 Å, 1.352 Å, 0.782 Å, 1.663 Å, 2.674 Å, and 3.677 Å, respectively. It is clear that larger values of DCT and Δq and a smaller value of Λ for P3HT/P2–P6 contribute to enhance the electron transfer efficiency of OSCs. Through the analysis of the electron transfer distances, transferred charge amounts, and overlaps involved in the electron transition, we can conclude that P2–P6 can act as good acceptors with good electron transfer efficiencies at the D/A interface for OSC applications.
Electron transport
It is well-known that in a photovoltaic device, a charge transport layer with high hole and electron mobility contributes to the improvement in the photoelectric conversion efficiency via increasing JSC. The charge transport rates (kCT) of the organic materials can be studied by the Marcus theory.68 Herein, kCT is determined by two factors, i.e., the reorganization energy (λ) and the transfer integral (υ), where the latter is mainly investigated due to its major role in the charge transport rate. υ is significantly influenced by the path of the intermolecular arrangement of neighboring molecules.60 The crystal structures of P1–P6 with the lowest total energy belong to P21/C, P21, P21, P1, P1, and P1 space groups, respectively. The main transport pathways are presented in Fig. 7, where one molecule in the crystal is arbitrarily chosen as the central acceptor, and its adjacent molecules are treated as paired elements. The calculated transfer integrals (υ), inner reorganization energies (λ), electron transport rate constants (kCT), intermolecular center-of-mass distances (r), and the electron mobility (μ) of main pathways selected on the basis of the crystal structures for P1–P6 are listed in Table 5.

From Fig. 7 and Table 5, we can see that among all selected pathways, the largest transfer integral of all investigated systems corresponds to the slipped π–π packing, which further proves the previous view that the pathway with face-to-face π–π packing in general possesses a relatively large transfer integral compared to the other pathways with edge-to-face (such as pathway 5 of P1) or cross packing (such as pathways 3 and 4 of P2). The order of the electron mobilities is P5 (1.06 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P4 (0.77 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P2 (0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P1 (0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P3 (0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P6 (0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1). The electron mobilities of P2, P4, and P5 are higher than that of P1 due to the large electron transfer integral and electron hopping rate, which indicates that they are the carrier transport materials exhibiting high performance. The electron mobility of P6 is smaller than that of P1 due to higher reorganization energy and small transfer integral and electron hopping rate. As pointed out above, the π–π packing mode of the dimer plays an important role in determining electron mobility, and TP, OP, and OY are better π-bridge units for improving the electron mobility compared to BT, TY, and BTC. As discussed above, the designed acceptors P2, P4, and P5 may show better transport performances to increase JSC for OSC applications.
Conclusions
Based on the experimentally reported small molecular acceptor P1, five novel A–π–D–π–A-structured small molecular acceptors (P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6) with different π-bridge units are theoretically designed. The optical, electronic, and electron transport properties and the performance in the active layer of the acceptor materials are explored. Preliminary calculations show that P2 and P5 as acceptors can replace P1 due to their red-shifted absorption wavelengths, appropriate energy levels and energy gaps, high electron affinities, and large electron mobility. Also, to further explore the affecting factors on JSC, we analyze the electron density difference, and we quantitatively calculate charge transfer indexes (Δq, DCT, and Λ) in charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor at the D/A interface. Comparative analyses show that P2 and P5 have more significant charge transfer characteristics and favorable exciton separation capabilities than P1, which potentially enhances JSC. As a result, P2 and P5 are the most promising candidates among this series of small molecular acceptors under investigation. Finally, we hope this study will theoretically guide the design and synthesis of acceptor materials to improve the performance of OSCs.
