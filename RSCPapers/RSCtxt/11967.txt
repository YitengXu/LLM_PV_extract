    , Accepted 29th April 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractAll-inorganic cesium lead bromide demonstrates better thermal and chemical stability compared to its hybrid counterparts, and thus it can provide a base for high stability and performance of CsPbBr3-based perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Appropriate cation doping engineering could further improve the stability and performance of CsPbBr3 films and PeLED devices. Here, the stability and luminescence performances of B-site and A-site cation doped CsPbBr3 films and PeLEDs are summarized and critically compared. The mechanisms of the improved properties after doping are discussed. In addition, a conventional analysis of lattice parameters in terms of spontaneous strains is provided for the first time for CsPbBr3 perovskites, in which they have robust correlations with the stability of the CsPbBr3-based films and PeLEDs. Meanwhile, the cation doping process is an effective method to flexibly modulate the spontaneous strains to enhance the stability and luminescence properties of the metal halide perovskites and PeLEDs. Doping and strain engineering in the field of perovskite optoelectronics will certainly encourage very important future developments in materials science, physics and chemistry for operationally stable PeLEDs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been receiving great attention due to their potential applications as a new class of photoactive materials for next-generation, easy-fabrication, high-performance optoelectronics.1–4 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the MHP-based light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has soared from less than 1% to beyond 20% in the past five years.5–13 In addition, the features of promising color purity, high charge-carrier mobility, high luminance, narrow emission linewidth, tunable emission wavelength and intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) makes the PeLEDs possess the most remarkable potential for application in flexible display devices.2 Although organic LEDs (OLEDs)14–17 have been widely applied in the high-end consumer market (like in mobile phones from Huawei and Samsung, and smartwatches from Apple), the high-cost, rather broad emission spectra, low color purity, and narrow color gamut will limit their use in the development of larger markets.18–20 Therefore, the PeLEDs will be an ideal alternative.
For a commercial application PeLED, external quantum efficiency (EQE), current efficiency (CE), power efficiency (PE), maximum luminance (Lmax), turn-on voltage (VON), and device operational lifetime T50 are important parameters to evaluate the performance of devices.21 Initially, the emitters of the PeLEDs primarily used organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites,4,5,22–24 like CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) and HC(NH2)2PbBr3 (FAPbBr3). The EQE, CE, PE, and the luminance of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites LEDs have already approached the respective values for the commercially used organic LEDs (OELDs).28,29 However, the problems of instability in PeLEDs remain a great challenge,25 which strongly limit their practicality. To improve the operational lifetime T50 of the PeLEDs, the all-inorganic halide perovskites, like cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3), are used as alternative emitters.26–36 The CsPbBr3 is much more thermally stable than organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. This is because the decomposition onset temperature of CsPbBr3 is about 853 K,37 which is much higher than that of MAPbBr337 and FAPbBr338,39 (decomposition onset temperatures of 423–523 K). This feature of CsPbBr3 could increase the operational stability of PeLEDs, possibly by inhibiting degradation induced by thermal stresses, such as Joule heating.25
Perovskite CsPbBr3 normally includes three different structural phases:41,42 cubic (Pmm, No. 221), tetragonal (P4/mbm, No. 127), and orthorhombic (Pbnm, No. 62). As shown in Fig. 1, the Pb atom is at the center of the octahedra formed by six Br atoms, and the Cs atoms are in the 3D framework cavities. The crystal structure of CsPbBr3 is orthorhombic at room temperature, and its symmetry will be transformed to a tetragonal one, and a cubic one at ∼88 °C and 130 °C, respectively, with increasing temperature.40,42,43 Therefore, the structural transitions of the CsPbBr3 is easily induced by the Joule heating during the operational period of the PeLEDs, and the structural phase transition is a critical factor to influence the operational lifetime T50 of the PeLEDs. Thus, the doping engineering is adopted to prevent the structural phase transition during the device working period, and turn the bandgap to obtain the target emission line. For example, Zou et al.44 used Mn2+ as the doping substitution to stabilize the CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) even at high temperatures of up to 200 °C under ambient air conditions. Manganese doping into the B-site of the CsPbBr3 crystal lattice can effectively improve the formation energies and effectively circumvent the poor thermal stability.45–48

In addition, as shown in Fig. 1d, the lattice parameter b remains almost constant while the values of the lattice parameters a and c increase as the temperatures increase, before the tetragonal–orthorhombic structure transition. It is well understood that spontaneous strains are associated with lattice parameter variations and structural phase transitions.49–53 Recently, Steele et al.54 modulated the spontaneous strains and the strains from the substrates to successfully stabilize the cubic phase of the X-site doping all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film at room temperature. Thus, the doping engineering of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 can effectively enhance the stability and the formation energies, which has a strong correlation with the spontaneous strains in the perovskite crystals. Both Yi et al.55 and Li et al.56 have confirmed that the MHPs with a cubic structure have a lower formation energy than the tetragonal and orthorhombic ones, which results in them becoming thermodynamically more stable under ambient conditions.25 Therefore, to obtain highly stable CsPbBr3-based MHPs for PeLEDs, the targets are to modulate the spontaneous strains and obtain the cubic phase, and the two factors also have strong correlations.
In this review, we summarize and critically compare the light emitting performance of recent CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs through doping engineering, depending on perovskite polycrystalline films, nanocrystals, and colloidal QDs. The stable mechanism of the doped CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs is discussed in detail. Spontaneous strains, crystal structure transitions and thermodynamics, which have strong correlations with the operational lifetime of the CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs, are also focused upon. We conclude this review with the prospects for future developments that need to be considered in order to attain practical optoelectronic application and commercialization of all-inorganic PeLEDs, and we hope that this review will provide some valuable insights into the current status of PeLEDs and will stimulate new ideas and further research on their practical applications.
2. Doping engineering
The stability of the MHPs can be effectively enhanced by the doping engineering which has been widely used in the semiconductor industry.57,58 Furthermore, the PLQY of the all-inorganic MHP films can also be improved as doping some appropriate ions through reducing the defect state density in perovskites.58 The monovalent (K+, Rb+),59 divalent (Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Sr2+, Sn2+, Ni2+, Ge2+),60 trivalent (Sb3+, Bi3+, Al3+, Y3+)61,62 metal cations and lanthanide cations (Ce3+, Tb3+, Yb3+)63 have been used as dopant ions to improve the performance of the MHPs and PeLEDs,64 as well as modulate the energy band structure of the perovskites.21,58 For the CsPbBr3 perovskite, the valence band maximum (VBM) is from the Pb (6s)–Br (4p) antibonding interactions, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is from the Pb (6p)–Br (4p) antibonding interactions; however, the CBM is less hybridized and is primarily dominated by the Pb 6p contribution.64,65 When the X-site Br− is replaced by Cl− or I− ions, the VBM and CBM will have an obvious shift. The band structure will be changed as the B-site doping ions into the CsPbBr3. In addition, the A-site doping ions can indirectly result in a change in the band structure through modulation of the lattice parameters.64
In this section, we primarily discuss B-site doping ions and then shift to A-site doping ions in CsPbBr3-based perovskites. The synthesized methods of the QDs, polycrystalline films, nanocrystals, and single crystals are demonstrated. The benefits and origins of cation doping engineering for improved performance of the doped CsPbBr3-based perovskites and related PeLEDs are discussed.
2.1. B-site doping

2.1.1 Divalent doping ions. 
Mn ion doping. 
The perovskite QDs or nanocrystals could be synthesized using the hot-injection method67 or the ligand assisted reprecipitation method.68 These synthesized colloidal QDs/nanocrystals and the in situ fabricated perovskite QDs can be applied for fabricating efficient and stable PeLED devices.69–73 These strategies could also be applied for preparing the B-site doped perovskite QDs and nanocrystals, and appropriately doped ions could improve the stability and luminescence properties of CsPbBr3 based MHPs and PeLEDs. It has been found that doping of a small amount of Mn2+ (∼0.97 Å) into the B-site of CsPbBr3 lattices can improve the formation energies of the CsPbBr3 perovskite and thus remarkably enhance the thermal stability, air stability and optical properties of the perovskite films and PeLED devices.44,46 However, because of the larger disparity of M-Br (M = Pb, Mn) bond dissociation energies between PbBr2 (249 kJ mol−1) and MnBr2 (314 kJ mol−1) compared to the PbCl2 (301 kJ mol−1) and MnCl2 (338 kJ mol−1) precursors, it is more difficult to dope the Mn2+ ions into the CsPbBr3 crystal lattices, contrary to the case of CsPbCl3.66,74 In May 2018, Parobek et al.66 report a direct hot-injection synthesis method67 to obtain the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 2, the first step is to synthesize the intermediate monolayer L2[Pb1−xMnx]Br4 (L: ligand) and this intermediate structure demonstrates strong Mn luminescence. Secondly, the Cs-oleate is injected after further heating the reaction mixture to 200 °C, and the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are obtained as the final product when the temperature is quickly cooled to room temperature. The mixture of the nanocubes and thin nanoplatelets of the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can be easily separated by simple centrifugation.

Zou et al.44 exhibit an effective method via Mn2+ doping to remarkably stabilize perovskite lattices of CsPbBr3 QDs even at high temperatures of up to 200 °C under ambient air conditions for air-stable PeLEDs. Fig. 3a is the schematic illustration of the doping process in which a small amount of Mn2+ ions in perovskite CsPbX3 lattices can improve the formation energies of the manganese-doped CsPbX3 perovskites. Although the pure and Mn2+-doped CsPbBr3 QDs have comparable morphology and crystallinity as well as a similar orthorhombic crystal structure, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is enhanced through appropriate Mn2+ ion doping (Fig. S4b of the ESI in ref. 44). Furthermore, Fig. 3b demonstrates that the degradation rate of the Mn2+-doped CsPbBr3 QDs on the surface of a glass slide is much slower than that of the pure CsPbBr3 QDs. Meanwhile, an appropriate Mn2+ doping content is important to obtain air-stable CsPbBr3:Mn QDs under ambient air conditions, as exhibited in the ESI.44 These features are consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3c) that the absolute value of the ΔEform per Pb2+ (or Mn2+) ion shows a slight increase with the increase in Mn2+ content, reaching a maximum at ∼2.08 mol%, and then declining quickly as the doping content increased. The experimental and calculated results provide robust evidence that an appropriate Mn2+ dopant can effectively improve the air stability of CsPbBr3 QDs, which is a significant base for the long-term stable PeLEDs. Fig. 3d demonstrates the schematic illustration of a typical multilayer-structured PeLED device by using pure CsPbBr3, CsPbBr3:Mn (2.6 mol%) and CsPbBr3:Mn (3.8 mol%) QDs as green light emitting layers. Then, the normalized electroluminescence (EL) spectra, PL emission spectra, current density, luminance, EQE and current efficiency are compared. The results show that the maximum current density, maximum luminance, maximum EQE and maximum current efficiency of the Mn2+-doped CsPbBr3 PeLEDs outperform the pure CsPbBr3 counterparts. These measurements of the device performance are all carried out under ambient air conditions without any encapsulation or protection, which implies the great air stability of the all-inorganic manganese doped CsPbBr3 PeLEDs.

Sn, Cd and Zn ion doping. 
Due to the identical perovskite crystalline structures between CsSnBr3 and CsPbBr3, the doping of Sn2+ ions into the CsPbBr3 crystals is expected to be easier than for other divalent ions.44 Zhang et al.75 first demonstrated the all-inorganic Sn2+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and the content of the Sn cations has a significant effect on the device performance. Fig. 4a shows a typical device configuration consisting of spin-coated layers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly(4-butylphenyl-diphenyl-amine) (poly-TPD) and the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystals emitting layers, and evaporated layers of 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) and LiF/Al. A blue shift feature can be observed from the EL spectra with the increase of the Sn cation content. The performances of the PeLEDs are displayed in Fig. 4b. The results show that the best performance is obtained when the molar ratio of the Sn is 0.3, with maximum luminance and efficiency among all samples. Their work clearly illustrates that an optimum doping content of the Sn cations can effectively improve the luminance and efficiency of the CsPbBr3 based PeLEDs, like the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 PeLEDs.

However, the Sn2+ ions can be easily oxidized to Sn4+ ions, and this feature results in the problem of instability for a Sn-doped CsPbBr3 PeLED device. Therefore, Wang et al.76 demonstrated a hot-injection synthesis method to prepare the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 QDs with Sn4+ substitution to improve the performance of the QDs and related PeLEDs. They used the SnBr2 as one of the perovskite precursors to synthesize the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 QDs, but the valence state of the Sn ions in the synthesized CsPb1−xSnxBr3 QDs was tetravalent which was determined using X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). These results are primarily due to the facile oxidation of the Sn2+ ions for a high-temperature synthesis method. The best substitution ratio was x = 0.33 in which the absolute PLQY of CsPb0.67Sn0.33Br3 QDs was 83%. This PL enhancement could be due to the suppression of the trion formation with the Sn4+ substitution, confirmed by transient absorption (TA), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and single-dot PL spectroscopy. However, the performance of the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 QDs decreased as the relative amount of Sn increased owing to the generation of the impurity phase Cs2SnBr6. Finally, they fabricated the CsPb0.67Sn0.33Br3-based PeLEDs consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/CsPb0.67Sn0.33Br3 QDs/TPBi/Li/Al, and the devices exhibited a low turn on voltage of 3.6 V and a maximum luminance of 12500 cd m−2, which were the highest values for the Sn-based PeLEDs at that time. Thus, the PLQY of the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 QDs and the performance of the related CsPb1−xSnxBr3 PeLED device could be improved by an appropriate doping content of the Sn4+ ions.
Van der Stam et al.60 used the Sn2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ ions to partially replace the Pb2+ ions in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and they found that doping engineering led to a blue-shift of the absorption and emission spectra, while preserving the high PLQYs, narrow PL line width and sharp excitonic absorption transitions. Fig. 5a shows the schematic process of partial B-site cation exchange in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, where the Pb2+ cations are partially replaced by Sn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions. The synthesized CsPb1−xMxBr3 nanocrystals with smaller B-site cations leads to the blue-shift of the absorption and PL (Fig. 5b). However, the extent of the blue-shift is based on the kinds of divalent cations and precursor concentrations (Fig. 5b). For example, the position of the PL maximum can be changed from 452 to 512 nm through tuning the concentration of CdBr2 in toluene while maintaining other reaction parameters constant. Combining X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) results, they argued that lattice contraction after doping is the primary reason for inducing the blue-shift of the optical transitions. As shown in Fig. 5c, the lattice vector of doped CsPb1−xMxBr3 (M = Sn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+) nanocrystals scales linearly with that of the PL energy, and this tendency is independent of the cation type. Correspondingly, the lattice contraction and extent of optical blue shift for Cd- and Zn-dopants are larger than those for the Sn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. The proposed cation exchange reaction mechanism is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5d, and the detailed description is in the ESI of ref. 60.

2.1.2 Trivalent doping ions. 
Rare earth ion doping. 
Some heterovalent ions can also be doped into the CsPbBr3 structure. For example, the Ce3+ can be doped into the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals without introducing additional trap states, due to the similar ion radius between Ce3+ (103 pm) and Pb2+ (119 pm). In addition, the electron density in the conduction band of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can be improved after the Ce3+ doping, which is an effective method to modulate the kinetics of exciton relaxation and recombination.77 Yao et al.63 used the Ce3+ ions as a heterovalent dopant to enhance the photo/electroluminescence efficiency as well as improve the stability of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals through a hot-injection method. As shown in Fig. 6a–f, the device performance of the Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 PeLED is much better than that of the undoped ones, in which the PeLEDs with Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 have much stronger luminance, higher maximum CE and EQE. Furthermore, they also find that the PL kinetics hasa strong influence on the performance of the final devices. The left panels of Fig. 6g and h show the temporal evolution of the fs-TA spectra for the undoped and doped CsPbBr3 nanoparticles, respectively, and a global analysis is used to retrieve the decay-associated spectra (DAS) (right panels of Fig. 6g and h). The results demonstrate that the intra-band hot-exciton relaxation (τ1) and the exciton trapping to the band gap trap states (τ2) processes for the doped sample are accelerated compared to the undoped one. This feature is due to the doping-induced state modification, which brings on new, near band-edge states, resulting in the density increase of the lowest excitonic state, as highlighted by an asterisk in Fig. 6i. They illustrated that such an increase in density of states can improve the τ1 and τ2 processes. Fig. 6j demonstrates the average PL lifetimes of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with different dopant concentrations measured by time-resolved PL measurements dependent on time-correlated single photon counting. These results further confirm that the Ce3+-doping can increase the near band-edge state density and promote the PL kinetics with increasing the dopant concentrations. The anticorrelation between the PLQY and PL lifetimes as shown in Fig. 6j illustrate that the Ce3+-doping-induced near band-edge states are of radiative nature, which provide more emissive channels rather than nonradiative trapping channels. Thus, the fs-TA and time-resolved PL spectroscopy intrinsically confirmed that the Ce3+-doping can remarkably modulate the PL kinetics to enhance the PL efficiency of doped CsPbBr3 nanoparticles.

Furthermore, besides Ce3+ ions, other lanthanide ions, such as Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+, and Yb3+ ions, have been successfully doped into the CsPbBr3 perovskite lattices,78–80 which is an easy method of tuning the luminescence properties of CsPbBr3 perovskites and CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs. Duan et al.80 successfully doped some lanthanide ions (Sm3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Er3+, and Yb3+) into the CsPbBr3 film via a multistep solution-processable method in air, which was confirmed by the XRD, SEM, ICP and XPS measurements. Their results found that the introduction of some lanthanide ions can effectively increase the carrier lifetime and reduce charge recombination in perovskite films. In addition, the moisture and thermal tolerances of the doped CsPbBr3 films are enhanced as well. The stability enhancement mechanism of these rare earth doped CsPbBr3 films is similar to the Mn2+ doped CsPbBr3 ones,44 which is due to the increase of the formation energies. This feature also enhances the phase thermal stability.
Bi and Al ion doping. 
Besides rare-earth ions, bismuth is another important trivalent doping ion for MHPs.77 The calculation results have shown that the Bi3+ ion preferentially occupies the Pb2+ ion position in the CsPbBr3 crystal structure, because of the similar ionic radii between Pb2+ ions (119 ppm) and Bi3+ ions (117 ppm), the comparable metal halide bond lengths (Pb–Br: 3.00 Å vs. Bi–Br: 2.93 Å) and lower formation energies compared to the Cs and Br sites.77 Begum et al.61 found that the interfacial charge transfer (CT) can be tuned and facilitated by the Bi3+ ion doping in the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with different molecular acceptors. Through Bi3+ ions doping, the driving-force Gibbs free energy (−ΔG) between the molecular acceptor and donor moieties will increase and this feature results in more efficient CT from the nanocrystals to molecular acceptors. However, in sharp contrast to the Ce3+ doping, doping Bi3+ ions into the CsPbBr3 perovskites will remarkably reduce the PLQY due to the PL quenching.61,77 The reason for the PL quenching of the Bi3+-doped CsPbBr3 perovskites is that substituting Pb2+ ions with Bi3+ ions in the bulk or on the surface will create deep trap states, which will remove the defect-tolerant nature of the host CsPbBr3 perovskites. This feature will also result in the formation of non-radiative carrier recombination centers. Therefore, the trapping and scattering centers in the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals will remarkably quench the PL intensity.77 On the other hand, the Bi3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystal films are potentially stable electron-transporting layers for PeLEDs. The Bi3+ doping will alter the conductivity type of CsPbBr3 perovskites from p-type to n-type, and the mechanism is that the Fermi level will shift to a higher energy, which implies the formation of the electron-type defect states localized closer to the bottom of the conduction band.81
Liu et al.82 synthesized the Al3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with stable blue photoluminescence. Their XRD results show that the Al-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are highly crystalline with the orthorhombic phase, and the substitution of the Pb2+ ions (119 pm) by smaller Al3+ ions (53.5 pm) will lead to lattice contraction as well as octahedral tilting. The distortion and tilting of the PbBr6 octahedron will broaden the bandgap, and thus shift the PL emission to the bluer region. In addition, the contraction of the PbBr6 octahedron can strengthen the lattice stability under heating due to shorter Pb–Br bonds, and the experimental results also confirmed that the blue Al3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystal film demonstrated higher thermal stability and thermal recycling than the green CsPbBr3 nanocrystal film. Furthermore, the blue Al3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals also prevent the color drifting issues induced by anion exchange in halide mixture MPHs.82

2.2. A-site doping
Cs+ ion is the most popular alkali metal ion as the A-site ion in all inorganic MHPs due to its large ionic radius, and recently alkali metal ions with smaller ionic radii partly substituted the Cs+ ions to enhance the performance of the MHPs and the PeLEDs.83–86 Amgar et al.59 demonstrate the doping of Rb+ cations into CsPbBr3 nanoparticles using a hot injection method. It is well known that the smaller Rb+ ions (1.61 Å) in the A-site of CsPbBr3 perovskites reduce the Goldschmidt tolerance factor87 which is a reference to predict a stable perovskite structure. As shown in Fig. 7a–e, the tolerance factors reduce slightly through addition of more rubidium to the perovskite crystal. The tolerance factors are all more than 0.8, which implies that a stable perovskite can be obtained through the Rb+ ion doping. Fig. 7a–e show that the d-spacing of the crystallographic plains decreases through increasing the contents of the Rb+ ions at the A-site. This feature is consistent with the tilting angles of the octahedra in the perovskite structure.88 The smaller A-cation will result in lattice contraction, and this process can strengthen the antibonding overlap between Br-p and Pb-s orbitals. Besides, the increase of the Pb–Br–Pb angle will weaken the p–s overlap. In addition, the optical properties are correlated with the octahedral tilting.88 As shown in Fig. 7f and g, the absorption onsets and PL peaks shift to shorter wavelengths as the doping contents of Rb+ ions increase, which is due to the octahedral tilting of the perovskite structure. Importantly, appropriate doping of Rb+ ions into the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites effectively improve the PLQY (Fig. 7h), and thus, it is a base for a highly efficient Rb-doped CsPbBr3 PeLED device.

Li et al.89 found that the contracted lattice volume of the A-site doped CsPbBr3 is beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite structure and improving the absolute formation energy after substituting part Cs ions by the Li, Na, K, and Rb ions. In addition, doping of these alkali metal cations effectively reduces the grain boundaries and facilitates the charge transportation kinetics. Thus, the substituting process by alkali metal cations at the A-site of CsPbBr3 apparently decreases the non-radiative trap-dominated recombination and enhance radiative recombination. However, we found that the amount of the substituted A-site ions is very small, which is between 2% and 9%. Thus, we suspect that the performance improvement of their solar cell devices is primarily due to the grain boundary passivation effects by the A-site ions, not a real doping process at the A-site of the perovskite structure. The lattice contraction of the Cs1−xRxPbBr3 (R = Li, Na, K, Rb) is mainly due to the decrease in the content of the Cs ions at the A-site, and the results also support this hypothesis in which the lattice values (a, b, and c) follow an order of CsPbBr3 > Cs0.98Li0.02PbBr3 > Cs0.94Na0.06PbBr3 > Cs0.92K0.08PbBr3 > Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3. Although potassium passivation has confirmed that it can remarkably maximize and stabilize luminescence for the organic–inorganic hybrid mixed-anion (Cs0.06FA0.79MA0.15)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite,86 the knowledge regarding luminescence and stability of all inorganic CsPbBr3 PeLEDs through alkali metal cation doping engineering is still deficient. Thus a comprehensive study to gain further understanding of the replacement mechanisms at the A-site of the perovskite structure to improve the performance of all-inorganic MHPs and PeLEDs is urgently required.
3. Spontaneous strain variations
Recently, Steele et al.54 found that the degree of biaxial anisotropy of the CsPbI3 perovskite film90 jumped to 1.18% during the cubic–tetragonal transition and stopped increasing after forming an orthorhombic phase. In addition, Saidaminov et al.91 discovered that local lattice strain could result in the degradation of MHPs, which is due to the easier formation of point defects in perovskite crystal lattices. Jones et al.92 discovered the non-radiative losses in halide perovskites, which is induced by the lattice strain, and the lattice strain is directly associated with enhanced defect concentrations. Therefore, spontaneous strain variations of the CsPbBr3 at different temperatures will facilitate researchers to better understand the degradation mechanism of the CsPbBr3 perovskites and CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs. In this part, the analysis of spontaneous strains from 300 to 450 K use the temperature-dependent changes in CsPbBr3 lattice parameters, reported by Stoumpos et al.40 (Fig. 8a). The lattice parameters also represent the form and strength of coupling between the driving order parameters and strains.93

The reference parameter a0 is given by extrapolation of a straight-line fit to the cubic lattice parameters. (b) Variations of spontaneous strains determined for the data in (a) using eqn (1)–(7). The red dashed line and green dashed line represent the orthorhombic–tetragonal and tetragonal–cubic structure transition temperature, respectively. 
For determination of spontaneous strains, the reference parameter a0 has been obtained by fitting a straight line to lattice parameters a of the cubic phases (a0 = 5.77241 + 0.000226 × T Å).94 Linear strains were then calculated from the lattice parameter measurements as95–98 (1) (2) (3)
The symmetry-adapted strains are94,95 ea = e1 + e2 + e3(4) (5) eo = (e1 − e2)(6) e4 = (e1 − e3)(7)
Variations of linear strains (e1, e2, and e3), tetragonal shear strain et, orthorhombic shear strain eo, the remaining nonzero shear strain e4 and the volume strain ea obtained in this way are plotted in Fig. 8b. Fig. 8b has clearly shown that the linear strains and shear strains in the temperature range of the orthorhombic phase are much higher than those in the tetragonal and cubic phases. From the lattice strain aspect, the cubic and tetragonal phases are more stable than the orthorhombic ones. On the other hand, the strain at the film/substrate interface can effectively modulate the spontaneous strains in the perovskite crystals.54,92,99–101 Therefore, these insights into the role of the strain coupling and relaxational effects in a CsPbBr3-based MHPs and PeLEDs allow rationalization and prediction of perovskite stability. which could be enhanced in thin film form by choice of strain contrast with a substrate. Meanwhile, the cation doping engineering can flexibly adjust the spontaneous strains and increase the absolute formation energies, which are effective methods to enhance the stability of the CsPbBr3-based MHPs and PeLEDs.
Although using lattice strain relaxation to improve the performance and stability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 based PeLEDs was rarely discussed, some researchers have reported that the stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) for solar cells was effectively improved via the strain engineering. For example, Zhao et al.102 found the compressive strain in the MAPbI3 polycrystalline films and this strain accelerated degradation of perovskite films under illumination which is due to the increased ion migration in strained MAPbI3 films. As shown in Fig. 9a, the concave film with the smallest strain (0.2%) remained mostly black after 500 hour illumination, and in contrast, some regions turned yellow in the convex (0.62%) and flat (0.47%) films with larger lattice strains. The yellow region is a general feature of the decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2 confirmed by their XRD results (Fig. 9b). In addition, they also discovered that the lattice strains in the perovskite films are primarily induced by the thermal expansion mismatch between the perovskite films and substrates, and the high-temperature annealing processes for the perovskite solar cell fabrication. Zhu et al.49 also found the gradient evolution of residual strain in the vertical direction of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 film, and this phenomenon could be stemmed from the gradient thermal stress during film processing or/and compositional inhomogeneity. In addition, as shown in Fig. 9c, the strain gradient can affect the carrier dynamics across the interfaces over the perovskite solar cell, verified by the first principle calculations. Then they successfully fabricated strain-engineered perovskite solar cells with the enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified), by modulating the residual strains to enhance carrier extraction efficiency. Thus, low-temperature perovskite film formation, optimizing the annealing process and using substrates with a similar thermal expansion coefficient are effective methods to modulate the lattice strains in perovskite films.92,99

The distortion angle (θ= 180°–angle (B–X–B′)) decreases with strain relaxation. (Reproduced with permission.91 Copyright 2018, Springer Nature). 
Furthermore, Saidaminov et al.91 discovered that the lattice strains primarily originate from the ionic size mismatch between the A-site cation and the lead halide cage, leading to cage distortion and BX6 octahedral tilting, and the mechanisms of lattice relaxation in perovskites are demonstrated in Fig. 9d. Thus, some smaller isovalent dopants (e.g. Cl− for X-site and Cd− for B-site) were used to reduce the lattice strain in Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite films, and this process could maximize the formation energy of the most common defect species without introducing additional electronic traps. They observed that the stability and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) were remarkably improved for halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) after using those doping perovskite films. The experimental results were also consistent with their calculation that the PbX2 vacancy formation energy increased due to the incorporation of small ions. Their study implied that inclusion of small ions prevented the formation of defects by creating a new lattice strain relaxation pathway in MPHs.
The all-inorganic MHPs have better thermal and chemical stability compared to the OIHPs, and thus the study of strain engineering in all-inorganic MHPs may open new avenues for highly stable PeLEDs.
4. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have demonstrated cation doping engineering to improve the stability and luminescence properties of all-inorganic CsPbBr3-based MHPs and PeLEDs. B-site doping cation ions (Mn2+, Sn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, rare earth ions, Bi3+, and Al3+) and A-site doping cation ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+) into the CsPbBr3 perovskites are introduced in detail. We discussed the mechanism of the doping cation ions and the advantages of the doping processes are provided. First, cation doping engineering improves the stability and enhances the luminescence properties via an increase in the formation energies and contracted lattice volume; second, it can make the emission line bluer through modulating the band structure and shrinking the crystal lattices; third, cation doping engineering is a flexible method to adjust the spontaneous strains which is correlated with the perovskite stability; last, the B-site cation doping decreases the content of the toxic Pb2+ ions. In contrast to the anion exchange, cation diffusion in perovskites is a very slow process, owing to the high activation energies for the formation of cation vacancies and the lack of interstitial sites for interstitial diffusion.60 Although the X-site doping can improve the stability and luminescence properties for the MHPs without any loss in color purity,10 the ion migrations under electrical bias is a terrible issue to degrade the mixed-anion MHPs.103–105 Hence, a reasonable cation-doping process avoids the color shifting issues induced by anion exchange in halide mixtures MHPs.
The spontaneous strains of the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite is provided in this review for the first time over the structural transition range orthorhombic–tetragonal–cubic based on conventional analysis of the lattice parameters. The results indicate that the linear strains and shear strains in the orthorhombic phase are much higher than that in the tetragonal and cubic phases. However, the spontaneous strains in the perovskite crystal lattices will induce the generation of the point defects, which have a high affinity for oxygen and water molecules in air to relax the strains.91 Thus, the high spontaneous strain in the orthorhombic structure is a critical factor to cause the instability of the CsPbBr3 perovskite from the aspect of strain engineering. Nevertheless, the cation doping engineering is a remarkable method to modulate the spontaneous strains in the CsPbBr3 perovskite.
The unstable features of the CsPbBr3-based films and PeLEDs have strongly limited their commercial applications. Although doping and strain engineering can improve the stability and enhance the luminescent properties, the mechanism is still less studied. Thus, a deep understanding of the doping and strain engineering is pivotal to obtain excellent and stable PeLED devices to replace OLED and LCD products in the future display market.
