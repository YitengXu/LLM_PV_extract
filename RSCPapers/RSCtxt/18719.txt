    , Accepted 12th July 2022First published on 13th July 2022AbstractThe effect of phosphorene as a co-catalyst for Ti/TiO2 nanotube electrodes on CO2 reduction to methanol, and water splitting was investigated. The electrode was prepared by using poly-dopamine as an anchoring agent to attach phosphorene, which was initially prepared by liquid exfoliation from black phosphorous. In this photoelectrocatalytic system, phosphorene acts as a p-type semiconductor with an energy band gap of −1.46 eV and strong photoactivation under visible light irradiation. Under optimized conditions, solar simulator irradiation and applied potential of −0.8 V in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and pH 7 the CO2 reduction is preponderant in the process. The electrode system was found to also promote the production of hydrogen from water reduction when the photoelectrocatalytic process is conducted at the applied potential of −1.0 V in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH 2). The results indicate that phosphorene can be a good modifier of Ti/TiO2, and the high charge mobility amplify its potential applicability to CO2 conversion.
1. Introduction
The conversion of CO2 to functional hydrocarbons has been investigated by electrochemical processes for a long time.1,2 However, these processes suffer from the need for a high overpotential required for the electrochemical reduction, low selectivity of the products and the competing electrochemical reduction of water to produce hydrogen.3–7 The use of semiconductors as photocatalysts in artificial photosynthesis has shown great potential to reduce CO2 by using sunlight mimicking the natural photosynthesis process.8–13 More recently, photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction has gained great attention as a number of reports demonstrated that better catalytic performance can be achieved by applying a bias potential while irradiating a photocatalytic semiconductor.14,15 The application of a bias potential is assumed to promote step band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface leading to better separation of the photogenerated charges (e−/h+).15–17
Among the several types of semiconductors, the use of TiO2 electrodes in photoelectrocatalysis deserves special consideration, due to its low cost, high stability, good applicability in obtaining pure hydrogen and versatility of procurement and applications.18–20 Different strategies have been developed and used to address the challenge of obtaining high photocatalytic efficiency. For instance, the fabrication of nanostructured Ti/TiO2 electrodes (nanotubes, nanowires, and others) led to a higher surface area and vectorial charge transfer.21 The incorporation of metal nanoparticles (Ag, Pt, and Au) or the preparation of composites such as Sb2S3 and WO3 doped with B and N, has led to improvement of electron trapping (i.e., Schottky barriers), and increase in its photo-absorption in the visible region, thus minimizing the electron–hole recombination.22–24 Another aspect that has gained attention is to test how a new co-catalyst incorporated at the TiO2 electrode leads to the production of fuels, such as CO2 conversion to alcohol and hydrogen production from water splitting.25,26 For this, the photogeneration of suitably long-lived charge separated states is required since multi-electron chemistry is involved in these processes.27,28
In this context, the use of two-dimensional carbonaceous materials such as graphene in the nanocomposite synthesis process has attracted attention due to its extensive specific surface area, high intrinsic charge mobility, thermal conductivity, good electron–hole separation, and excellent mechanical stability.29–32 More recently, phosphorene has gained attention because in contrast to graphene, it has variable fundamental band gap that can be modulated by strains and the number of stacked monolayers of phosphorene.33
Phosphorene consists of a mono-layer where each phosphorus atom is linked to three adjacent ones, forming a structure that resembles a network of hinges connected with an anisotropic rotational deformation34 arranged in the form of zigzag two dimensional (2D) configurations with strong anisotropic electronic and optical properties. Phosphorene can be obtained from bulk black phosphorus (BP) using mechanical or chemical exfoliation techniques.35–37 It behaves as a p-type semiconductor with a band gap that increases substantially from 0.59 eV for a five-layer to 1.51 eV for a monolayer.38,39 It has high carrier mobility, high transport anisotropy controlled by layer thickness, good mechanical flexibility, strong excitonic effect, and high photo response (strong potential for absorbing solar radiation).32,36,40–44 The potential of these properties has been explored in energy storage,44,45 gas sensors,41,46 and p–n junctions.38,47,48 Ran et al.49 demonstrated by computational calculations that CdS, Zn0.8Cd0.2S and ZnS modified by phosphorene work well as non-metallic co-catalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Thus, taking into consideration the properties of phosphorene as a p-type semiconductor its use as a co-catalyst of Ti/TiO2 (n-type semiconductor) nanotube electrodes could be a good strategy to build p–n heterojunctions with higher potential for modulating the heterojunction for H2O or CO2 reduction.
The present report describes the construction of composite photoelectrodes by anchoring phosphorene to TiO2 nanotubes using poly-dopamine (PDA) as the anchoring agent.50 Phosphorene was produced via a liquid exfoliation method of black phosphorous. The Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode was analysed by Field Emission Scanning Electronic Microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), diffuse reflectance and photocurrent vs potential curves. The nanocomposite TiO2/PDA/phosphorene photoelectrode was used in the hydrogen generation concomitantly to the CO2 reduction to fuel alcohol by photoelectrocatalysis. The optimal experimental conditions to improve selective reduction of CO2 in relation to hydrogen evolution are reported.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of phosphorene
Phosphorene monolayers were obtained from black phosphorus bulk (99.99%, Smart elements) by liquid exfoliation.51 More specifically, 10 mg of black phosphorus were dispersed in 20.0 mL isopropyl alcohol in absence of oxygen by N2 gas bubbling for 10 minutes. The suspension was sonicated for 2 hours. Afterwards the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes (Misonix, model XL 2010). The suspension was allowed to rest for 12 h then 2/3 of the supernatant was collected and kept in the refrigerator to be used for Ti/TiO2/PDA modification.
2.2 Preparation of the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode
TiO2 nanotubes were grown from titanium foil as described in the literature.52 The Ti foil (Realum, Brazil) (∼1.0 cm2) was polished with silicon carbide sandpaper with the roughness of 200, 500, 1000 and 1200 grits. The foil was subsequently cleaned by sonication for 20 min in successive baths containing acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and distilled water, then dried in a flow of nitrogen gas. The TiO2 nanotubes were grown by electrochemical anodization in a two-electrode electrochemical cell and a DC power supply (Minipa MPL-1303), as previously described.53 More specifically, Ti foil was immersed in an aqueous glycerol solution (10% water, v/v) containing 0.15 mol L−1 NH4F and a potential of 30 V was applied for 50 hours. A Ti/Ru DSA® electrode (∼1.5 cm2) was used as the counter electrode. After anodization was completed, the Ti/TiO2 electrode was annealed at 450 °C for 1 hour (2 °C min−1). Different procedures such as drop casting, dip coating, electrochemical deposition and the use of polydopamine as the anchoring agent,50 were tried to anchor phosphorene to the Ti/TiO2 electrode. The use of polydopamine was found to be necessary to anchor phosphorene onto the Ti/TiO2 electrode. The procedure involved the immersion of Ti/TiO2 electrodes in a solution of 0.27 mol L−1 dopamine hydrochloride solution in phosphate buffer pH 8.5 for 6 hours. The PDA functionalized Ti/TiO2 (Ti/TiO2–PDA) electrode was coated by addition of 250 μL of the previously prepared phosphorene suspension (supernatant). The electrode was removed and dried for 10 min in a vacuum oven at 45 °C. The procedure was repeated 15 times.
2.3 Characterization of the electrodes
The morphology of the electrodes of Ti/TiO2, Ti/TiO2/PDA and Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene was studied by field-emission scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM), using a Gemini 300 (Zeiss, Germany) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Bruker, EUA). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected using a tabletop D2 phaser diffractometer (Bruker, EUA) equipped with a Cu ceramic X-ray tube (λα1 = 1.5406 Å). The optical properties of the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a UV/Vis/NIR PerkinElmer Lambda spectrometer, model 1050, equipped with an integrating sphere module – 150 mm UV/Vis/NIR (InGaAs) in the range from 200 to 800 nm. The band gap energies were estimated via the Tauc method, using Kubelka–Munk equation.53
Electrochemical measurements of photocurrent vs potential were carried out using an AUTOLAB Potentiostat/Galvanostat, model PGSTAT 302, using NOVA 2.0 software. Linear scan voltammetry for Ti/TiO2, Ti/TiO2/PDA and Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrodes were recorded in 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl as electrolyte, and a potential from −0.5 to +1.0 V vs. Ag| AgCl (3 mol L−1 KCl), at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 was applied. The charge transfer of the electrodes was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), obtained in 5.0 mmol L−1 [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− solution in 0.1 mol L−1 KCl, in the frequency range between 10 kHz to 0.03 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV. To determine the flat band potentials, Mott Schottky's experiments were carried out in a 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution with a frequency of 100 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV. A three electrode system was used, with an Ag|AgCl (3 mol L−1 KCl) as the reference and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode.
2.4 Photoelectrocatalytic performance
All photoelectrocatalytic experiments were carried out in a 250 mL Teflon photoelectrochemical reactor, as shown in Fig. 1. The system was composed of three electrodes: the Ti/TiO2 electrode with and without modification, Ag|AgCl (3 mol L−1 KCl) and a DSA® plate as the working electrode (B), reference (C) and counter electrode (D). A Newport 300 W Xe lamp, model 69911, was used for photo-irradiation, and a solar simulator Newport model 81094, placed 10 cm in front of the electrode irradiated through the quartz window (A).

Hydrogen produced during the experiment was analyzed separately as well as in the presence of CO2. Firstly, 100 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution was transferred to the reactor, which was saturated by bubbling CO2 for 15 minutes, sealed and the pressure was adjusted to 1.0 atm, as described previously.54 The solution was mechanically stirred during each experiment. The products generated after photoelectrolysis at optimized potential, pH, irradiation, and time were analysed by gas chromatography.
The amount of methanol produced from the electrophotocatalytic CO2 reduction was determined by gas chromatography using a Shimadzu, model 2010, attached to a flame ionization detector (FID). The carrier gas used was N2, with a flow of 1.0 mL min−1. A column Stabilwax, Rastek (30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 25 μm film thickness) was used. The temperature of 240 °C was used both in the injector and in the detector. The initial oven temperature was 40 °C, which was increased to 46 °C, on a heating ramp of 2 °C min−1, 170 °C under a rate of 45 °C, remaining for 3 minutes. The collected samples went through an analyte extraction step using solid phase microextraction (SPME) using a SPME fiber coated with divinylbenzene/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/PDMS), Supelco, type 57329-U. At the end of each experiment, a 500 μL aliquot was removed from the solution and transferred to a 1.5 mL vial. The vial was heated in a water bath at 65 °C for 7 minutes, then the fibre was exposed to the steam formed for 5 minutes, before injection into the GC instrument.
The production of H2 was monitored after photoelectrolysis in a 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution (without CO2) and was also carried out in the same electrolyte solution saturated with CO2 (concomitantly to CO2). 50 μL of the treated solution was collected using a gas-tight syringe and immediately injected into a Shimadzu gas chromatograph, model 2014, coupled with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The equipment was calibrated for hydrogen detection using a Carboxen-1010 Plot, Supelco column, (30 m long, 0.53 mm internal diameter and 30 μm of film thickness). The carrier gas used was Argon and temperatures of 220 and 230 °C were used for the injector and detector, respectively. The oven was heated from 130 to 135 °C, at a rate of 2 °C min−1, kept at 135 °C for 5 minutes, then heated to 200 °C (20 °C min−1) and maintained at 200 °C for 2 minutes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Surface characteristics of the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode

Fig. 2 shows the FEG-SEM images for the arrays of TiO2 nanotubes (A), TiO2 nanotubes coated with PDA (B), and after deposition of phosphorene (C and D). The electrochemical anodization of Ti foil resulted in nanotubes oriented perpendicular to the Ti-sheet of ∼112 nm in diameter and 21 nm wall thickness. After the growth of the poly-dopamine layer, the average nanotube wall thickness increased to 38 nm and the average diameter decreased to 95 nm. After phosphorene deposition (15 cycles), almost complete coverage of TiO2–PDA with randomly deposited 300 nm particles of phosphorene is observed. The qualitative distribution of Ti and phosphorous obtained by EDS mapping, show significant phosphorous presence, as shown (plot II). The quantitative results estimated from elemental analysis indicate that Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene contains 23.7% titanium, 0.7% of phosphorous, 64.7% of oxygen, and 10.8% carbon.

Phosphorene deposition was further confirmed by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), shown in Fig. 3, obtained for Ti/TiO2 (Curve a), pure phosphorene (Curve b) and Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrodes (Curve c). The PXRD of Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrodes shows representative diffraction peaks of TiO2, Ti, and phosphorene. The peaks observed at 2θ = 25.5°, 48.0° and 70.2° correspond to the (101), (200) and (220) diffraction peaks of the anatase phase of TiO2. The two low intensity peaks observed at 2θ = 35.4° (101) and 75.7° (202), correspond to the rutile phase of TiO2, and the peaks observed at 2θ = 38.5°, 40.2° and 53.0° correspond to the Ti metallic substrate. The phosphorene peaks are observed at 2θ = 17.0° (020), 34.5° (040) and 52.5° (060).37,55

3.2 Optical characteristics of the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode

MEP_L_fig3Fig. 3(B) compares diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) from 200 nm to 800 nm for Ti/TiO2 (Curve a), Ti/TiO2/PDA (Curve b) and Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene (Curve c) electrodes. Ti/TiO2 has strong absorption in the UV region (λ ≤ 380 nm), and no significant photoactivation in the visible region consistent with previously reported data.47 When coated by PDA and PDA/phosphorene, absorption bands at λ > 400 nm are observed, with maximum absorption between 600 and 650 nm. PDA was previously used as the anchoring agent,52 and has shown optical absorption in the 600–650 nm range (Fig. 3(B)). PDA is known to be photoactive and was previously described and used as dye-sensitizer for solar cells construction due its absorption in the visible region56 and good adherence to different surfaces.57,58 The Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrodes show higher photoabsorption in the UV and visible regions (Fig. 3(B)). In agreement with density functional theory,59,60 the absorption spectrum of phosphorene changes with the number of phosphorene layers because the excitation polarizes the armchair-edge direction of phosphorene. For instance, bilayer phosphorene has an optical band gap of 0.72 eV along the armchair direction In agreement with the literature,37 this value can also reach a band gap of around 1.51 eV. Thus, the phosphorene anchoring to Ti/TiO2 could achieve results in a hybrid material. Further studies were conducted using photoexcitation under artificial solar irradiation.
3.3 Electrochemical characteristics of the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode

Fig. 3(C) shows plots of photocurrent (Iph) vs. potential (E) for the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 in the dark (a) and under solar irradiation (b). Under solar irradiation, Iphvs. E plots obtained for Ti/TiO2 show hydrogen evolution starting at −1.0 V, which is reduced to −0.80 V when the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode is used. The anchoring of phosphorene seems to improve the separation of photogenerated charges (h+/e−), increasing charge carrier lifetimes, which facilitates water reduction.25 When the electrolyte is saturated with CO2, the voltammograms (plot d) indicate that under solar irradiation, the current in the cathodic region around −0.25 V increases, suggesting that CO2 could be reduced preponderantly at a lower potential than that required for water at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode. The results could indicate that similar to other modifiers such as graphene,47,61 phosphorene favors CO2 reduction in relation to water reduction at a negative potential due to greater electron mobility at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.
To better understand the effect of phosphorene on the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the electrolyte and the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in 5.0 mmol L−1 [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− using 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte. For comparison purposes the electrodes Ti/TiO2 and Ti/TiO2/PDA were also studied by EIS and the Nyquist graphs are shown in Fig. 3(D). The Nyquist plots show that the resistance to charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface drops from 45.3 Ω (Ti/TiO2) to 18.1 Ω (Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene). This can be attributed to the high current mobility of phosphorene, that reaches 105 cm2 V−1 as previously reported.36,41,43,44,62 The flat band potential (Efb) correlates with the Fermi energy levels63 and can be estimated from the capacitance measurements versus voltage following the Mott–Schottky equation:64 1/C2 = (2/εε0A2eNd)(E − Efb − kBT/e)(1)where, C = capacitance of semiconductor/electrolyte junction, ε = the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, e = electronic charge, E = applied potential, Efb = flat band potential, Nd = doping density, A = area of the depletion region/space charge region, kB = Boltzmann's constant, and T = absolute temperature at which the measurement is done. The flat band potential Efb were determined from the plot of 1/C2vs. E and found to be −0.21 V for Ti/TiO2 and ∼1.63 V for Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene. The Efb value was used to estimate the Fermi level position.65,66 The valence band and conduction band edges for Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene, were estimated using the empirical Mulliken's electronegativity equation (eqn (2) and (3)).67 EVB = χ − Ee + 0.5Ebg(2) ECB = EVB − Ebg(3)where, χ = absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is 5.81 eV for TiO268 and 5.62 eV for phosphorene;69Ee = energy of free electron vs. standard hydrogen electrode (4.5 eV vs. NHE). Using the calculated band gap energies for TiO2 (3.2 eV) and phosphorene (1.46 eV) the position of the VB and CB for the TiO2 nanotubes can be estimated to be 2.93 and 0.31 eV, respectively. The positions of the VB and CB for phosphorene are 1.83 eV and 0.39 eV respectively. The band positions of TiO2 and phosphorene are shown in Fig. 4. Thus, it is suggested that under irradiation, the electrons photogenerated at TiO2 (n-type) could be transferred to the conduction band of phosphorene, where CO2 reduction and/or hydrogen generation could occur.

Further experiments were carried out to monitor both alcohol production and hydrogen evolution during photoelectrolysis at a low negative potential and artificial solar irradiation to check if the phosphorene could indeed act as a co-catalyst in CO2 reduction and/or hydrogen production.
3.4 Photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode

Fig. 5(A) shows that coating the Ti/TiO2 electrode with phosphorene enhances methanol production by about 95% after 120 min of photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH 7) under a bias potential of −0.8 V. Fig. 5(B) shows that under the same conditions, more methanol is generated at the TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode under UV/vis irradiation than under a simulated solar irradiation.
 Fig. 5  Methanol production after 2 h of photoelectrocatalytic reduction of dissolved CO2 in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 at (A) TiO2/PDA/phosphorene and Ti/TiO2 electrode, under applied potential of −0.80 V and UV/Vis irradiation. (B) Comparison of UV-vis and solar simulator irradiation on methanol production on Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode; (C) comparison of photoelectrocatalysis,PEC, (catalyst + E = −0.80 V vs. Ag|AgCl + UV/Vis) and photocatalysis methods, PC, (catalyst + UV/Vis) on methanol production, (D) comparison between methanol and hydrogen formation at PEC condition. 

Fig. 5(C) also shows that higher CO2-to-methanol conversion at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode under an applied potential of −0.80 V and UV irradiation compared to photocatalysis carried out under UV irradiation only. These results also indicate that in the absence of a bias potential, the amount of methanol produced is 75% smaller. This can be explained by the fact that UV irradiation promotes the generation of charges (e−/h+) at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode surface, but the applied potential gradient is vital to overcome the steeper band bending. Fig. 5(D) also shows that 0.096 μmol L−1 of hydrogen is simultaneously produced during the reduction of CO2. Thus, to investigate the role of each reaction in the process, the production of hydrogen at TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode was monitored in the absence of CO2.
3.5 Water reduction at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode
3.8 μmol L−1 of hydrogen was produced during the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of water at Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 of Na2SO4, under a bias potential of −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1 KCl) and solar simulator irradiation. This amount is ∼100% higher than that produced at the Ti/TiO2/PDA electrode.

Fig. 6(A) compares hydrogen production under photolysis conditions (solar irradiation only), photocatalytic (solar irradiation + Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode) and photoelectrocatalysis (Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode + bias potential −0.2 V + solar irradiation). Hydrogen was measured by gas chromatography as described in the Experimental section. The results indicated that there is no detectable hydrogen production under irradiation (photolysis) only. In contrast, ∼1.3 μmol L−1 of hydrogen was obtained when photoelectrolysis (irradiation + bias potential) is carried out on the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphene electrode. When a bias potential of −0.8 V is applied, hydrogen production increased by ∼165%, indicating that water reduction is preponderant at a higher potential. This is presumably because the bias potential leads to steeper band bending, which improves charges separation.
Thus, phosphorene probably increases charge mobility at the Ti/TiO2 electrode, improves absorption in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and increases the lifetime of photogenerated electrons contributing to hydrogen production. To determine the effect of the type of electromagnetic radiations on hydrogen production, photoelectrocatalytic experiments were repeated at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode irradiated using a solar simulator and visible light only. The results are shown in Fig. 6(B). The modified electrode produced 3.54 μmol L−1 and 2.01 μmol L−1 of hydrogen, under solar simulator and visible irradiations respectively. Production of H2 under solar simulator irradiation is 1.8 times greater than under visible irradiation only, indicating that Ti/TiO2 is also photoexcited under UV-irradiation portion of the lamp. Although the photoelectrocatalytic generation of H2 under visible irradiation only is viable, solar simulator yields 43% more H2, and it was chosen in further experiments MEP_L_fig6Fig. 6(B). The modified electrode produced 3.54 μmol L−1 and 2.01 μmol L−1 of hydrogen, under solar simulator and visible irradiations respectively. Production of H2 under solar simulator irradiation is 1.8 times greater than under visible irradiation only, indicating that Ti/TiO2, it is also photoexcited under UV-irradiation portion of the lamp. Although the photoelectrocatalytic generation of H2 under visible irradiation only is viable, a solar simulator yields 43% more H2, and it was chosen in further experiments.

3.6 Simultaneous generation of methanol and hydrogen during photoelectrocatalytic reduction at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode
To modulate the parameters that directly affect the conversion of CO2 to methanol and simultaneous reduction of H2O to produce H2 hydrogen production, photoelectrocatalytic experiments were performed under the same conditions as above, i.e. supporting electrolyte (0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH 6) saturated with dissolved CO2) and bias potential. Samples were collected after 120 min of treatment and the amounts of methanol and hydrogen produced were quantified by CG-FID and CG-TCD respectively. Fig. 7 illustrates the effect of applied potential from 0.0 to −1.0 V vs. Ag|AgCl (3.0 mol L−1 KCl) on CO2 reduction and concomitant hydrogen production at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode.
 Fig. 7  Effect of bias potential at Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH 6) saturated with CO2 after 120 min of photoelectrocatalytic reduction under solar simulator irradiation. 
The reduction of CO2 to methanol (main product) by photoelectrocatalysis increases as applied potentials are shifted to more negative values reaching 218 μmol L−1 at −0.80 V. Also, a smaller amount of hydrogen is produced when the electrolyte is saturated with CO2. The largest amount of hydrogen is produced at −1.0 V, reaching 10 μmol cm−2. Only a negligible amount of hydrogen is produced at applied potentials lower than −0.80 V. These results clearly demonstrate that the photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction competes with the water reduction process and that the applied potential can be used to drive the reduction of CO2.
The CO2/methanol conversion is preferred at a slightly lower potential than −0.80 V, as verified by the photocurrent vs potential curves.
A higher potential than −1.0 V was not applied at the electrode to avoid cathodic polarization and to promote reduction of Ti4+ into Ti3+, which could interfere with the stability of the electrode. At potentials lower than −1.0 V the stability of hydrogen production remained constant during at least 8 repetition measurements.
It is well known that the reduction of CO2 to methanol starts with the generation of CO2˙−, which requires approximately −1.9 V vs. NHE.7,9,17 In more negative potentials, it is possible to observe the high gas formation, and bubble evolution, on the surface of the photoelectrode. Due to the H2 generation by water splitting which hinders adsorption of CO2 on the surface of the electrode, preventing CO2 reduction. However, the effect of phosphorene on the Ti/TiO2NT electrode assists to increase CO2 reduction, allowing the process to occur at a less negative potential, such as −0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and with good faradaic efficiency (46.5%) for methanol generation. Further studies were conducted at different pH using an applied potential of −0.80 V where maximum CO2 reduction was observed.
The pH is a key variable in the photocatalytic/photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol.70,71 This is primarily due to the fact that the pH significantly influences CO2 solubility and the dynamic equilibrium with hydrogen carbonate and carbonate ions.72 Thus, the effect of pH 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the electrolyte solution (0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 saturated with CO2) was investigated. A higher pH was not investigated because phosphorene is not stable above pH 7.73 The effect of the initial pH on methanol and hydrogen formation after 120 min of photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at the Ti/TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode under a solar simulator and a bias potential of −0.8 V is shown in Fig. 8. The pH values were not corrected during photoelectrocatalysis.
 Fig. 8  Effect of the pH of the initial electrolyte solution on methanol and hydrogen generated after 120 min of the photoelectrocatalytic process conducted in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 saturated with CO2 and pH = 2, 4, 6 and 7 at TiO2/PDA/phosphorene electrode under applied potential of −0.8 V (vs. Ag|AgCl3 mol L−1 KCl) and solar simulator irradiation. 
The results indicated that under neutral conditions (pH 7) 450 μmol L−1 of methanol formed indicating preponderant formation of methanol. On the other hand, H2 production predominates under more acidic solutions reaching a maximum of 0.85 μmol L−1 at pH 2. Taking into consideration the equilibrium and relative concentrations of the CO2 species, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is favored at pH < 6.1, and at 6 < pH < 7 favors the formation of HCO3− ions, allowing greater CO2 solubility in the electrolyte solution.74
4. Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that coating the Ti/TiO2 nanotube electrode with phosphorene leads to a good performance in photoelectrocatalytic CO2/methanol reduction probably due to a semiconducting heterojunction where TiO2 acts as a n-type semiconductor and phosphorene as a p-type semiconductor. The modification of the Ti/TiO2 nanotube electrode with phosphorene was only possible using a thin polydopamine film used as an anchoring agent, that improved adherence. The addition of phosphorene onto the Ti/TiO2 showed a significant improvement in absorption in the visible region and band gap energy characteristic of a hybrid compound, having two band gap energy values of 1.46 eV and 3.34 eV and lower charge transfer resistance, resulting in better charge mobility at the semiconductor/solution interface.
The electrode presented versatile applicability for both H2 photogeneration at −1.0 V (2.01 μmol L−1 H2) and preponderant CO2 reduction to methanol in sodium sulfate containing dissolved CO2 and corrected initial pH 7 and at an applied potential of −0.80 V vs. Ag|AgCl (458 μmol L−1) and solar simulator irradiation.
