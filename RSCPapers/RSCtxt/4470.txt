1. Introduction
Photodetectors are pivotal elements of the modern optoelectronic industry, which capture, identify, and visualize elusory optical signals by transforming them into tractable electric signals.1–3 Photodetectors have been extensively exploited in both civil and military realms. For example, ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors have been exploited for environment monitoring, military reconnaissance, space science, etc.; visible (Vis) photodetectors have been exploited for optical imaging, electronic eyes, solar energy harvesting, etc.; and infrared (IR) photodetectors have been exploited for optical communications, night vision, remote control, analytic science, satellite remote sensing, fire alarms, etc. Profiting from strong light–substance interactions, thickness-tailored bandgaps, high carrier mobility, flexible monolithic integration, strong immunity to short-channel effects, high compatibility with conventional Si-based microfabrication techniques, mechanical flexibility, high transparency, and strong quantum confinement effects, 2D materials (2DMs) have exhibited considerable prospects toward next-generation optoelectronic devices and triggered worldwide research enthusiasm.4–13 Due to the unique anisotropic crystal structures, layered materials, which are also denoted as van der Waals (vdW) materials, can be flexibly thinned down to atomic scale without compromising the crystalline quality as compared to the bulk counterparts.14–17 Thus far, layered 2DMs (L2DMs), spanning graphene,18 topological insulators,19 group 4 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),20–22 group 6 TMDCs,23–25 group 10 TMDCs,26–28 group 13 metal chalcogenides (MCs),29–31 group 14 MCs,32–35 elemental group 15 semiconductors,36,37 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),38 have been extensively investigated for photoelectric detection.
Despite indisputable advancements, L2DMs still suffer from a host of inherent limitations. Firstly, although more than 100 L2DMs have been experimentally produced, their intrinsic optical attributes are thus far insufficient to effectively match all optical wavebands. For example, the bandgaps of TMDCs/MCs are largely in the range 1–2 eV,39–41 corresponding to a narrow effective wavelength range of 621–1243 nm. In addition, the bandgap of h-BN is up to 6 eV,42 which is only suitable for vacuum UV (10–195 nm) photoelectric detection.38 Although moderate-bandgap TMDCs/MCs have been widely explored for detecting UV light, the photon energy (>3.0 eV) is usually much larger than the bandgaps of these L2DMs. Therefore, a considerable portion of energy of the absorbed photons is dissipated in the form of non-radiative relaxation of photocarriers, which dramatically curtails the photoelectric conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the unique Dirac-like electronic structures of graphene and topological insulators can be exploited for photoelectric detection of far-infrared (FIR) and terahertz wavebands.43,44 However, due to the bandgap-free character of the energy band structures, the carrier lifetime is extremely short,45,46 making the responsivity of the corresponding photodetectors limited to a few mA W−1,18,47 which is several orders of magnitude lower than commercial photodetectors (∼0.1–1 A W−1).48 Therefore, L2DMs themselves are unsuitable for meeting many optoelectronic applications, such as optical communications (1310, 1550 nm)49 and environmental UV-A (320–400 nm)/UV-B (290–320 nm) index monitoring.50,51 Second, L2DMs normally exhibit high in-plane symmetry. As a result, the corresponding photodetectors can only detect light intensity, whereas detection of incident light's polarization, polarization azimuth, and polarization ellipticity is unavailable. Although elemental group 15 L2DMs52 and group 4/10 TMDCs28,53 manifest a polarization-dependent photoresponse, they suffer from predicaments of poor air stability, exorbitant cost, or both. Third, L2DMs feature chemically inert surfaces. Therefore, it is inevitable to introduce large vdW gaps,54–56i.e., high potential barriers, between electrodes and channels, which are inconducive to carrier transport.
Inspired by the extensive accomplishments of L2DMs, non-layered 2DMs (NL2DMs) have also been anticipated to bring exceptional properties that are distinguished from their bulk counterparts. Compared with L2DMs, a fundamental feature of NL2DMs is that their surface atoms are unsaturated. It provides an additional degree of freedom to tailor the properties of materials as well as heterostructures built of them. Thus far, NL2DMs have substantially expanded the scope of the 2DM family and demonstrated a series of intriguing attributes beyond the reach of L2DMs. For example, unlike group 6 TMDCs, which are indirect bandgap semiconductors once deviating from a monolayer, In2S3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor in both monolayer and few-layer forms.57 In addition, Ga2S3 and CuBr possess a bandgap of ∼3 eV,58,59 bridging well the bandgap values of group 6 TMDCs and h-BN. Therefore, they have considerable potential to make up for the shortcomings of L2DMs in detecting UV-A and UV-B light. On the other hand, Te, CuFeS2, and Ge exhibit bandgaps of 0.31, 0.52, and 0.67 eV,60–62 filling the interstice between the bandgap values of TMDCs and graphene. Thus, they manifest promising prospects in the near-infrared (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR) range. Furthermore, both In2S363 and Ga2S364 are intrinsic defective semiconductors, where 1/3 of cationic sites are vacancies. It provides an additional degree of freedom for tailoring the optoelectronic properties to meet various requirements. Moreover, theoretical calculations indicate that 2D PbX (X = S, Se, Te) possesses a favorable bandgap around 1 eV whilst manifesting an unprecedented electron mobility up to 252000 cm2 V−1 s−1.65 Finally, a number of NL2DMs are intrinsic p-type semiconductors,66–71 which constitute an important complement to the common n-type L2DMs28,72,73 for the construction of p–n junctions. Thus far, researchers have devoted intense enthusiasm to NL2DM photoelectric devices and considerable progress has been achieved.
Although several literature reviews on NL2DMs have been published, the scope is largely confined to either a specific production approach, such as wet-chemical synthesis,74 or application in a specific realm, such as energy storage and conversion.75–77 As far as we know, there is no review providing a comprehensive overview of NL2DM photoelectric devices, spanning photodetectors and photovoltaic cells, as well as strategies for performance improvement. Therefore, a systematic, critical overview of this emerging domain is imperative. Herein, we begin with a summary of synthesis approaches of NL2DMs, including vdW epitaxy (vdWE), 2D template assisted topotactic conversion, the space-confined growth method, the self-limited growth method, and the hot-pressing method. Then, we present on-chip photodetectors built on NL2DMs, including pristine metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetectors and heterojunction photodetectors. Next, we summarize novel NL2DM photoelectric devices, including polarization-sensitive photodetectors and flexible photodetectors. After this, we introduce strategies toward improving the photosensitivity of NL2DM photodetectors based on device structure engineering. Subsequently, we describe photovoltaic devices based on NL2DMs. Finally, we highlight the key challenges facing further development of this rapidly progressing research field, along with strategies addressing them.
2. Strategies to produce NL2DMs
Restricted by the isotropic covalent bonding in all three dimensions, NL2MDs are difficult to produce through straightforward mechanical delamination from the corresponding bulk crystals since it is considerably challenging to break the strong covalent bonds. In addition, conventional bottom-up approaches are also infeasible for synthesizing NL2DMs due to the lack of a driving force to break the bulk crystal symmetry and promote anisotropic growth. Despite the fact that molecular beam epitaxy has been successfully exploited to synthesize NL2DMs with high crystalline quality and precise thickness,78–80 it entails exorbitant facilities and monocrystalline substrates (e.g., SiC, Al2O3, and GaN). In addition, the strict lattice-matching requirements impose severe restrictions on the categories of NL2DMs enabled by molecular beam epitaxy. Therefore, scientists have been devoted to searching for alternative synthesis technologies.
Thus far, several approaches have been successfully developed, including vdWE, 2D template assisted topotactic conversion, the space-confined growth method, the self-limited growth method, the hot-pressing method, and the wet-chemical synthesis method. It is worth noting that NL2DMs grown by an aqueous wet-chemical route will inevitably suffer from numerous crystal defects and contaminations due to the use of morphology control agents, surfactants, and dispersants, making them largely unsuitable for meeting the high standards of optoelectronic devices, notably heterostructures demanding atomically clean interfaces.81–83 Therefore, the wet-chemical synthesis method won’t be discussed herein. For more details of this approach, one can refer to a preceding literature review by Tan et al.74 Below we provide a summary of the dry approaches, elaborating on their working principles and development status, as well as advantages and disadvantages.
2.1. vdWE
vdWE is a synthesis technique that has been developed for decades, starting from the 1980s,84 despite the fact that it has only been extensively exploited for producing 2DMs as well as vdW heterostructures in the past few years.85 In sharp contrast to traditional homoepitaxy or heteroepitaxy, vdWE exploits layered materials with a dangling-bond-free surface, such as graphite, L2DMs, fluorophlogopite mica ([KMg3(AlSi3O10)F2]), or non-layered materials with a passivated surface, such as H-passivated Si, as growth substrates. The growth mechanism of vdWE is as follows. To begin with, a dangling-bond-free surface can significantly suppress the nuclear density by virtue of few surface defects, which is conducive to reducing grain boundaries. In addition, since the surface of the substrates possesses no dangling bonds, the interaction between the precursor atoms and the substrate's surface atoms is weak vdW forces, which enables the growth of epilayers with a large lattice mismatch and distinct crystalline symmetry. Furthermore, the surface of freshly cleaved layered materials is normally atomically flat and clean. As a result, the migration barrier (E) for adatoms is low. Considering that the migration coefficient (D) is related to the migration barrier by D ∝ e−E/kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the substrate, adatoms can thus freely migrate along the substrate's surface and attach to the edges of nuclei, thereby promoting in-plane growth while suppressing out-of-plane growth.86 Furthermore, since the interlaminar interaction between the epilayer and substrate is weak vdW forces, the initial unit cell of an epilayer is strain-free, laying a solid foundation for high crystalline quality. In 2014, Wang et al. synthesized 2D Te nanoplates by performing physical vapor deposition on mica substrates.87 Regular hexagonal Te nanoplates with lateral dimensions of 6–10 μm and thicknesses of 30–80 nm are produced. In contrast, irregular microcrystals are obtained by exerting the same experimental conditions on a Si substrate, which further evidences the vdWE growth character on layered material substrates. It is worth noting that vdWE is highly universal for synthesizing various non-layered materials since the driving force for anisotropic growth is given by the layered substrates. Thus far, researchers have synthesized a host of NL2DMs through vdWE on various substrates (listed in parenthesis), including Se (ReS2),88 PbS (mica),89,90 PbSe (MoS2),91 Pb1−xSnxSe (mica),92 PbTe (mica),93 Pb1−xSnxTe (mica),94 Cu9S5 (mica),95 CuI (WS2, WSe2),96 CdS (MoS2, mica),97,98 CdSe (mica),99 CdSxSe1−x (mica),100 CdTe (mica),101 Cr2S3 (mica),102,103 Cr2Te3 (mica),104 CrSe (mica),105 In2S3 (mica),57 Sb2Se3 (mica),106 MnS (mica),66 ZnO (mica),107 Fe2O3 (mica),108 and NiSe (WSe2).109 Importantly, the weak interaction between the epilayer and substrate enables the flexible release of NL2DMs for transferring to arbitrary targeted substrates.110
Despite substantial progress, precise control of the thickness of NL2DMs based on vdWE is still challenging. Thus far, one-unit-cell thick NL2DMs have been rarely achieved. In addition, the lateral size of vdWE-grown NL2DMs is generally below 100 μm, which is unsuitable for practical applications. Furthermore, an additional transfer process is demanded for gate dielectric construction of vdWE-grown NL2DMs, since a layered substrate normally cannot serve as a back gate like conventional SiO2/Si substrates.
2.2. 2D template assisted topotactic transformation
2D template assisted topotactic transformation represents an ingenious synthesis technique that exploits ultrathin 2DMs as precursors and converts them into targeted NL2DMs through elaborately designed chemical transformation, where the overall starting 2D geometry of the parent materials is maintained. Normally, NL2DMs can be readily produced by performing ion exchange of L2DMs. For example, in 2014, Feng et al. synthesized 2D Ga2O3 nanosheets with a thickness below 10 nm through thermal oxidation of mechanically exfoliated 2D GaSe nanosheets in air (Fig. 1a).111 In 2019, Sreepal et al. produced 2D InF3 nanosheets through fluorinating mechanically exfoliated 2D InSe nanosheets by direct exposure to XeF2 at an elevated temperature.112 Most recently, Cao et al. synthesized 2D Mo5N6, W5N6, and TiN through nitrogenization of the corresponding TMDCs (MoS2, WS2, and TiS2) by exploiting urea as the nitrogen source.113 In addition to anion exchange, cation exchange of L2DMs can also be exploited to produce NL2DMs. Non-layered Cu2SnS3 was obtained by partially substituting Sn of layered SnS2 with Cu (Fig. 1b).114 A two-step topotactic transformation of the layered MTe2 (M = Mo, W, Ti) matrix to produce 2D Te nanosheets with a thickness down to 2.3 nm was demonstrated by Peng et al.115 Firstly, MTe2 is converted to Li2Te by an exhaustive lithiation process. Then, Li atoms from the lattice matrix are exclusively detached by a hydrolysis treatment, thereby leaving 2D Te nanosheets. Furthermore, 2DM-based solid-state reactions represent another route to realize topotactic transformation. For example, Feng et al. synthesized 2D CuGaSe2 nanosheets through a solid-state reaction of mechanically exfoliated GaSe nanosheets and thermally evaporated Cu.116 Later, 2D CuInSe2117 and CuGaS2118 nanosheets were also produced in a similar protocol.

Copyright 2019, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In addition to L2DMs, the surface layers of bulk materials can also act as natural 2D templates for producing NL2DMs through topotactic transformation. In 2019, Lin et al. produced 2D MoO2 nanosheets with a thickness down to 2–3 unit cells via a surface solid-state reaction route (Fig. 1c).119 In a typical synthesis course, Zn and MoO3 powders are mixed and ground until homogeneous. Then, Zn reduces MoO3 to MoO2 under heat treatment. By virtue of a solid–solid reaction, interdiffusion between the precursor materials is significantly suppressed. As a result, only the surface MoO3 is reduced. Finally, NH3·H2O is used to selectively etch the sacrificial MoO3 supports to dissociate the 2D MoO2 nanosheets. Inspiringly, a similar protocol has also been successfully exploited to produce a series of single crystalline 2D non-layered transition metal phosphides, including Co2P, MoP2, Ni12P5, and WP2,120 suggesting excellent universality of this approach.
Despite considerable advancements, 2D template assisted topotactic conversion suffers from the following disadvantages. Firstly, since the thickness of 2D templates is extremely limited. It's impractical to provide an ideal stoichiometric ratio of precursors for the chemical reactions, which may result in either contamination of residuals or incomplete chemical conversion. Second, it's still challenging to precisely control the thickness of the products. Third, the category and lateral size of NL2DMs are largely limited by the accessible 2D templates. Finally, the crude topotactic transformation may result in poor crystalline quality and rough surfaces, which are detrimental to device applications.
2.3. Space-confined growth method
The space-confined growth method is an approach that restricts the supply of feedstocks by limiting the growth space, thereby inhibiting material growth in the out-of-plane direction.121 That is, the material growth is switched from a thermodynamics dominant mode to a dynamics dominant mode. In 2016, Al Balushi et al. synthesized 2D GaN nanosheets by performing growth of graphene on SiC.122 Firstly, graphene coated SiC (graphene/SiC) is produced through sublimation of SiC followed by hydrogenation treatment. Then, Ga atoms are deposited onto graphene/SiC by pyrolysis of trimethylgallium, after which they intercalate between graphene and SiC. Finally, Ga is azotized by ammonolysis to obtain 2D GaN nanosheets. However, the limited lateral dimension and strong interactions with the substrate impose critical challenges on further device fabrication. In 2017, Huang et al. developed facile space-confined vdWE for the synthesis of monocrystalline 2D β-In2S3 nanosheets (Fig. 2a).63 Concretely, two mica sheets are vertically stacked and separated by a small gap size for space confinement, thereby forming a local microreactor with an extremely low precursor density and restraining the material growth along the out-of-plane direction. As the gap size enlarges from 1 μm to 50 μm, the product's thickness increases while its lateral dimension decreases. At an optimal gap size of 25 μm, triangular β-In2S3 nanoflakes with a thickness down to 1.5 nm are achieved. Analogous to conventional vdWE, the space-confined growth method is highly universal for producing various NL2DMs. Thus far, it has also been exploited to synthesize 2D NiS2,123 CuBr,59 Cr2S3,124 Ga2S3,125 Fe3O4,126 InI,127 and ZnTe.70 However, limited by the supply of precursors, this approach suffers from low growth efficiency, which is inconducive to large-scale practical applications.

2.4. Self-limited growth method
The self-limited growth method is a technique that suppresses or promotes material growth along specific crystallographic facets through spontaneously formed interfacial structures during the material growth process, thereby implementing anisotropic growth dynamics and thus a 2D morphology. In 2018, Hu et al. synthesized monocrystalline 2D Ge nanosheets through a self-limited epitaxial growth method by exploiting KCl as a passivation agent (Fig. 2b).62 During the growth process, Cl tends to absorb on the (111) plane of Ge to form the Ge–Cl motif, inducing serious structural distortions in terms of bond length, bond angle, etc. As a result, the energy for subsequent Ge to adsorb and grow on the Ge–Cl terminated (111) plane is extremely high. That is, the (111) plane is inactivated by the Ge–Cl motif, resulting in anisotropic growth dynamics. Under an optimized growth condition, a lateral dimension beyond 10 μm and a thickness down to 8.5 nm are achieved, demonstrating an anisotropic ratio exceeding 1000. Importantly, similar strategies have also been successfully exploited to synthesize 2D CdS and CdSe nanosheets.128
In addition to the interfacial motif, the heterointerface between materials with distinct properties can also help to realize self-limited growth. In 2018, Chen et al. synthesized a micron-sized tetrahedral GaN monocrystalline nanosheet through a heterointerface-confined nitridation reaction.129 In this work, liquid gallium (Ga)/tungsten (W) foil is used as a growth substrate. Since the surface tension of Ga (628.7 mN m−1) is much smaller than that of W (2361 mN m−1), Ga spontaneously spreads over the W substrate, forming a stratified Ga/Ga–W structure. During the nitridation process, the surface Ga is easily azotized to form GaN. Since W is more easily azotized, the subsurface Ga–W alloy effectively prevents further thickening of surface GaN, which leads to the formation of 2D GaN. Importantly, the electron mobility of an as-grown GaN nanosheet is as high as 160 cm2 V−1 s−1, attesting to its high crystalline quality. In 2019, Duan et al. synthesized 2D CaTe2O5 nanosheets with a thickness down to 7.4 nm by using molten glass as a substrate.130 During the growth process, molten glass can efficiently capture thermally evaporated Te atoms, after which Ca and O atoms from molten glass react with Te atoms to produce CaTe2O5. Once a CaTe2O5 layer is formed on the surface of molten glass, Te atoms are naturally isolated from Ca and O atoms. Thus, further thickening of the CaTe2O5 layer is prohibited.
On the other hand, low-melting point metals/alloys have recently emerged as important media for self-limited synthesis of non-layered 2D oxides, because the metal–air interface provides a natural 2D template, while the solid-phase surface oxides are readily delaminated from the liquid-phase metal precursors due to the weak adhesive forces. In 2017, Zavabeti et al. synthesized 2D HfO2, Al2O3, and Gd2O3 from the corresponding low-melting point metals at room temperature.131 In this work, 1 wt% of Hf/Al/Gd is alloyed with galinstan. Because the reduction in the Gibbs free energy caused by oxidation of Hf/Al/Gd is greater than that of In/Ga/Sn, HfO2/Al2O3/Gd2O3 tends to form on the alloy surface. The formation of the surface oxide keeps the liquid metal and air apart, thereby preventing further thickening, which is well dictated by the Cabrera–Mott oxidation mechanism.132 Later, researchers have synthesized SnO,133 TiO2,134 SnO2,133 Bi2O3,135 and Ga2O3136,137 by exploiting similar strategies. Importantly, combining this method with post-treatment represents a versatile route to obtain diverse NL2DMs beyond oxides, such as phosphates,138 nitrides,139 and sulfides.67,140
Despite extensive success, the self-limited growth method generally relies on specific materials or substrates. Therefore, its generalizability of synthesizing NL2DMs is inferior to vdWE. Meanwhile, the lateral size of the products is seriously limited. In addition, the self-limited growth method suffers from a confined thickness range of products due to its self-limited nature. It may hamper some practical applications, such as photovoltaic cells, which demand adequate light absorption. Furthermore, isolation of NL2DMs from substrates may add extra complexity to device fabrication.
2.5. Hot-pressing method
Recently, a novel hot-pressing approach has been successfully developed to produce NL2DMs from the corresponding bulk counterparts. In 2017, Hussain et al. obtained ultrathin Bi nanosheets with a thickness down to 2 nm and a lateral dimension with a magnitude of several microns by hot-pressing bulk Bi agglomerates (Fig. 3).141 Firstly, agglomerates of Bi nanoparticles are dispersed onto a polished Si substrate with an atomically flat surface. Then, they are sandwiched by covering with another polished Si substrate, after which a strong external compressing force is applied perpendicularly to the Si wafers and the system is simultaneously heated. After that, the Si wafers are naturally cooled to room temperature and 2D Bi nanosheets are obtained. Following the above success, this research group also produced sub-10 nm 2D Te nanosheets exploiting the same strategy.142 Generally, the hot-pressing method is clean, facile, scalable, and cost-efficient. However, it still suffers challenges in precisely controlling the thickness of the products.

3. Photodetectors based on NL2DMs
3.1. MSM photodetectors
Prior to the overview of NL2DM based photodetectors, several key figures-of-merit are introduced. The photocurrent (IP) is defined as IP = ILight − IDark, where ILight is the device current under illumination, and IDark is the device current in the dark. The responsivity (R) is defined as the ratio of the photocurrent to the power of the incident light. It is calculated by R = IP/PA, where P is the light intensity, and A is the photosensitive area. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) refers to the number of effective photogenerated carriers upon excitation per photon. It is calculated by EQE = hcIP/λePA × 100%, where h is the Planck constant, c is the velocity of light, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and e is the elementary charge. The detectivity (D*) reflects the capability of a photodetector to detect weak light signals. It is calculated by , where B is the frequency bandwidth, and NEP represents the noise equivalent power, which is equal to the minimum optical power where photocurrent can be distinguished from noise current. Specifically, when shot noise dominants the noise current, the detectivity can be calculated by .
MSM photodetectors possess merits of simple device structure and high photoconductive gain.143–147 Thus far, MSM photodetectors aiming at various wavebands have been achieved based on NL2DM channels with various optical attributes. Wide-bandgap NL2DMs are suitable for UV light detection. Up to now, experimentally synthesized wide-bandgap NL2DMs have included β-Ga2O3, α-Bi2O3, GaN, γ-CuBr, etc. In 2013, Feng et al. produced ultrathin polycrystalline β-Ga2O3 nanoflakes with a thickness down to 10 nm by a 2D template assisted topotactic transformation method and achieved high-performance UV photoelectric detection (Fig. 4a–c).111 Specifically, non-layered 2D β-Ga2O3 is produced through direct thermal oxidation of layered 2D GaSe in air. Under 254 nm light illumination, the responsivity, detectivity, and EQE of an as-fabricated 2D β-Ga2O3 photodetector reach 3.3 A W−1, 4.0 × 1012 Jones, and 1600%, respectively. In 2018, Messalea et al. exploited a liquid metal assisted synthesis approach to produce ultrathin α-Bi2O3 nanosheets and systematically studied their optoelectronic properties under UV light.135 Firstly, the surface layer of a liquid Bi droplet easily reacts with O2 gas in the ambient environment to form ultrathin α-Bi2O3. Then, the surface of a targeted substrate and a liquid Bi droplet are contacted to delaminate the α-Bi2O3 surface layer. Optical measurements indicate that 2D α-Bi2O3 exhibits a large direct bandgap of ∼3.5 eV, laying a solid foundation toward UV light detection. Importantly, an as-fabricated α-Bi2O3 photodetector demonstrates a significant and comparable photoresponse to both 280 and 365 nm light. Under excitation with 365 nm UV light, the device's responsivity reaches 400 A W−1. In addition, its response and recovery times reach 70 μs and 4.3 ms, respectively. In 2019, Gong et al. synthesized 2D γ-CuBr nanosheets by a self-limited growth method and systematically studied their optoelectronic characteristics.59 Due to efficient suppression of thermal excitation of carriers by a sizable bandgap (∼3 eV), the dark current of a γ-CuBr photodetector is as low as 0.64 pA even under a high source–drain voltage of 10 V. The device exhibits a pronounced photoresponse to 345 nm light. As the wavelength deviates from 345 nm, its photocurrent decreases significantly, attesting to high wavelength selectivity. Under 345 nm illumination, it demonstrates excellent stability of photoswitching. Its responsivity and EQE reach 3.17 A W−1 and 1126%, respectively. In addition, its response and recovery times are as short as 48 and 32 ms.

Moderate-bandgap NL2DMs are suitable for Vis light detection. Thus far, the experimentally synthesized moderate-bandgap NL2DMs have included CdTe, CdS, ZnTe, CuGaS2, α-MnS, etc. In 2017, Cheng et al. synthesized 2D monocrystalline CdTe nanosheets through vdWE and fabricated Vis photodetectors by exploiting them as photosensitive channels.101 Importantly, the thickness of 2D CdTe nanosheets is down to 4.8 nm, and their anisotropy ratio exceeds 103. Photoluminescence measurements indicate that the bandgap of 2D CdTe is ∼1.55 eV. Under a source–drain voltage of 1 V, the dark current of a CdTe photodetector is down to 100 fA. Upon 473 nm illumination, the device achieves a responsivity of 0.6 mA W−1 and detectivity of 1.02 × 109 Jones. In addition, it manifests a short response/recovery time of 18.4/14.7 ms. In 2018, Jin et al. synthesized 2D CdS nanosheets through a self-limited growth method and fabricated a Vis photodetector.128 Systematic photoluminescence measurements indicate a direct bandgap of 2.55 eV. The device exhibits an ultralow dark current of 200 fA. It is probably ascribed to the O2 molecules absorbed on the surface, which capture electrons from the n-type CdS and deplete the surface layer,148 accompanied by a sizeable bandgap and Schottky contact. Under 400–500 nm illumination, the device exhibits a significant photoresponse, where the photocurrent increases with decreasing wavelength. Under 400 nm illumination, photogenerated holes recombine with the negatively charged O2 molecules, leading to the release of a large amount of electrons, which help to boost the photoresponse. As a result, its on/off ratio reaches 103 and the response/recovery time is as short as 14/8 ms. In 2019, Wang et al. synthesized 2D ZnTe nanosheets with a lateral scale up to tens of microns by a space-confined growth method.70 PL measurements indicate a bandgap of 2.26 eV. The photoresponse of the corresponding ZnTe photodetector is as high as 453.9 A W−1. In addition, the device maintains excellent stability in a wide operating voltage range of 1–5 V. Recently, Li et al. synthesized 2D α-MnS nanosheets via vdWE and constructed a Vis photodetector (Fig. 4d–f).66 The as-fabricated α-MnS phototransistor demonstrates a typical p-type behavior and high on/off ratio beyond 106. In addition, its optimal responsivity and detectivity reach 139 A W−1 and 3.2 × 1014 Jones, respectively.
Small-bandgap NL2DMs require only a small amount of photon energy to excite photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, they are suitable for IR photoelectric detection. Thus far, the experimentally synthesized small-bandgap NL2DMs have included PbS and Te. In 2016, using a graphite sheet with an extremely low surface energy as a substrate, Wen et al. synthesized 2D PbS nanosheets with a thickness of 5–35 nm by vdWE.89 The corresponding PbS photodetectors exhibit a significant NIR photoresponse (800–1340 nm). Under 800 nm illumination at room temperature, the optimal responsivity, detectivity, photoconductive gain, and response time reach 1621 A W−1, 1.72 × 1011 Jones, 2512, and 0.3 s, respectively. In 2018, Amani et al. synthesized 2D Te nanosheets through a solution method and systematically investigated their photoelectric properties (Fig. 4g–i).60 Compared with black phosphorus, 2D Te nanosheets manifest a comparably small bandgap (∼0.31 eV) but much more excellent stability in air. Their hole mobility reaches 450 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which is elevated to 1430 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 77 K. Importantly, the room-temperature responsivity of a Te photodetector reaches 13 A W−1 and 8 A W−1 under 1.4 and 2.4 μm light illumination, respectively. Most recently, an IR photodetector with an effective wavelength range from 915 nm to 4.25 μm was implemented by exploiting a 2D ZnSb nanosheet as the photoactive channel.149 The device achieves a high responsivity of 89.2 A W−1 and detectivity of 1.7 × 1010 Jones upon 1550 nm illumination. In addition, it demonstrates a comparably short response/recovery time of 9.6/90 ms.
On the other hand, NL2DMs have also exhibited tremendous prospects for broadband photoelectric detection. Based on a moderate direct bandgap of 1.67 eV of CuGaSe2, Feng et al. constructed a UV-vis photodetector with an effective wavelength range of 254–700 nm.116 Under 490 nm illumination, its responsivity and detectivity reach 103 A W−1 and 8 × 1011 Jones. By leveraging a small direct bandgap of 0.6 eV of α-In2Te3, Yao et al. implemented high-performance photoelectric detection from UV to NIR (370–1064 nm).150 Under 635 nm illumination, an as-fabricated α-In2Te3 photodetector achieves a responsivity of 44 A W−1 and detectivity of 6 × 1012 Jones. In addition, its response/recovery time is less than 15 ms. By virtue of Dirac-dispersive surface states arising from the crystal symmetry of SnTe, Jiang et al. achieved room-temperature ultra-broadband photoelectric detection from Vis to MIR (405 nm–3.8 μm).151 Under 2003 nm illumination, the responsivity of an as-fabricated SnTe photodetector reaches 3.75 A W−1. Following this success, Yang et al. demonstrated high responsivity beyond 1 A W−1 based on a SnTe photodetector in the whole wavelength range of 254–4650 nm.152 Thus far, a series of NL2DMs, including Pb1−xSnxSe,92 Bi,153,154 In2S3,63 Bi2S3,145 CuInSe2,117 Te,155 Ge,62 Ga2S3,64 and Sb2Se3,106 have been successfully exploited for broadband photoelectric detection. For clarity, Table 2 summarizes the key figures-of-merit of NL2DM photodetectors.

3.2. HJPDs

3.2.1. In-plane HJPDs. 
Heterostructures can combine the advantages of diverse materials with various characteristics, providing abundant platforms for photoelectric detection applications.156 Notably, 2D/2D heterojunctions hold the merits of atomically sharp heterogeneous interfaces and excellent flexibility, representing promising device architectures toward next-generation photodetectors. In 2017, Zheng et al. developed in situ fabrication of in-plane L2DM–NL2DM heterojunctions based on a pulsed-laser deposition technology (Fig. 5).157 Concretely, asymmetric Cu–Au electrodes are firstly patterned on a SiO2/Si substrate. Then, an ultrathin In2Se3 nanofilm is synthesized in-between the electrodes through pulsed-laser deposition. Due to the high reactivity of high-energy ions of the plasma plumes, Cu and In2Se3 readily diffuse into each other, resulting in the formation of CuInSe2 at the Cu side. In contrast, the Au electrode is fairly inert and In2Se3 is thus formed at the Au side. As a result, a seamless 2D CuInSe2–In2Se3 lateral heterojunction is constructed spontaneously. Since the type-II energy band alignment along with the built-in electric field at the heterointerface can efficiently separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the photocurrent, responsivity, and EQE of an as-fabricated CuInSe2–In2Se3 photodetector increase by ∼1 order of magnitude as compared to a pristine In2Se3 photodetector. Meanwhile, the response time of the former is only half of that of the latter. This work depicts a facile protocol to fabricate 2D in-plane L2DM–NL2DM heterojunctions, opening up new opportunities toward high-performance photodetectors. Following this success, Ji et al. fabricated lateral CuInSe2/InSe heterojunctions through pulsed-laser deposition of ultrathin InSe nanofilms in-between symmetric Cu electrodes.158 Impressively, the CuInSe2/InSe heterojunctions exhibit approximately four times the photocurrent as compared to pristine InSe with Au electrodes, which is ascribed to the quasi-n+/n CuInSe2/InSe junctions for efficient reduction of the contact resistance. Most recently, Bi et al. presented another facile in situ route to construct lateral p–n junctions by selectively transforming n-type MoS2 to p-type MoO3via a KI/I2 solution-assisted chemical oxidization process.159 An as-fabricated MoS2/MoO3 photodetector demonstrates a high on/off ratio of ∼102. Importantly, this method can be readily generalized to other 2DMs, portending a rich palette of platforms for advanced photoelectric applications.

On the other hand, Wang et al. synthesized edge-contacted PbS–graphene heterostructures by performing vapor epitaxy of PbS with a graphene template.160 Since the unsaturated carbon atoms are highly active, PbS nanoplates selectively grow along the edges of the graphene nanosheet. Impressively, an as-fabricated PbS/graphene photodetector achieves a remarkable photoconductive gain of 108. In addition, its response/recovery time is as short as 48/64 ms. First-principles calculations establish that its excellent photosensitivity is ascribed to the strong covalent coupling between PbS and graphene nanosheets, which significantly promotes the carrier transport across the PbS/graphene heterointerface. In subsequent work, the same group also achieved a high-performance edge-contacted PbS/MoS2 photodetector with an excellent responsivity of 4.5 × 104 A W−1 and detectivity of 3 × 1013 Jones.161


3.2.2. Out-of-plane HJPDs. 
Typically, ultrathin NL2DM heterojunctions can be implemented based on the well-established manual stacking method for construction of L2DM heterostructures. In 2019, Alsaif et al. produced a 2D p-SnO/n-In2O3 photodiode based on printed oxide skins of liquid metals.162 However, the strong interfacial interactions induced by unsaturated dangling bonds of NL2DMs may dramatically degenerate the heterointerface by introducing a large number of defects.
L2DMs manifest a unique naturally passivated surface.6 As a result, they can be flexibly combined with NL2DMs to construct high-quality out-of-plane 2D/2D heterojunctions, which skilfully circumvents the strict lattice matching constraints demanded for the construction of conventional heterogeneous structures based merely on non-layered building blocks. In 2018, Lu et al. fabricated a 2D graphene/In2S3 photodetector by a facile manual stacking method (Fig. 6).163 The device exhibits pronounced and stable photoswitching characteristics upon periodic Vis illumination. In addition, by virtue of the ultrathin character, the device's photoresponse can be effectively modulated by its gate voltage. At a gate voltage of 0 V, its responsivity reaches 795 A W−1. At a gate voltage of 60 V, its responsivity is further boosted to 8570 A W−1. Importantly, the introduction of diverse NL2DMs into the 2DM family has dramatically enriched the assembly schemes of 2D/2D heterostructures. Thus far, a series of L2DM/NL2DM out-of-plane HJPDs, such as γ-CuI/MoS2,164 PdSe2/FA1−xCsxPbI3,165 MoS2/Cu9S5,95 black phosphorus/CdS,166 MoS2/ZnO,167 WSe2/ZnO,168 MoS2/MoO3,169 MoS2/Cd3As2,170 Bi2Se3/MoO3,171 SnTe/Bi2Se3,172 GaS/VO2,173 and WSe2/InGaZnO,174 have been successfully fabricated, providing numerous platforms for both fundamental research and technological applications.

(c and d) Responsivity (black) and EQE (blue) as a function of wavelength upon a gate voltage of 0 and 60 V.163 Reproduced with permission from ref. 163. Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. 
In addition to forming photodiodes with L2DMs, NL2DMs can also be exploited as photosensitizers coupled to L2DM channels to leverage high-performance photoelectric detection. Serving as photosensitizers, NL2DMs do not constitute the channel for carrier transport. In 2016, Zheng et al. synthesized non-layered CdS decorated layered MoS2 by a two-step growth method (Fig. 7a and b).97 Compared with a pristine MoS2 photodetector, the photocurrent of a CdS@MoS2 photodetector is increased by 50 times, and its response speed is expedited by 2 orders of magnitude. However, L2DM based heterostructures inevitably suffer from large vdW gaps,54–56 which are inconducive to carrier transport across the heterointerface. In 2018, Qin et al. produced a Se nanoplate decorated ReS2 monolayer (Se@ReS2) by combining a chemical vapor deposition method and vacuum deposition method in sequence.88 Importantly, covalent bonding between Se and ReS2 is formed, where the (110) plane of Se exhibits an epitaxial relationship with the (010) plane of ReS2. By virtue of the strong chemical hybridization, the response time of a Se@ReS2 photodetector is shorter than 10 ms and its detectivity reaches 8 × 1012 Jones, which is three orders of magnitude higher than a pristine ReS2 photodetector. This work depicts a promising scheme for improving the photosensitivity of NL2DM@L2DM photodetectors via interface engineering. In 2019, Wen et al. designed a two-step approach to deliberately produce gapless PbS@MoS2 heterostructures.175 Firstly, MoS2 is annealed in a reductive H2 atmosphere to introduce S vacancies. Then, 2D PbS nanosheets are self-assembled onto MoS2 by physical vapor deposition. The S dangling bonds of PbS and S vacancies of MoS2 exhibit a great trend to couple through strong orbital hybridization, resulting in a gapless vdW heterojunction, which dramatically alleviates the potential barrier stalling carrier transport (Fig. 7c). Inspiringly, an as-fabricated PbS@MoS2 photodetector achieves a high photogain of 105 and detectivity beyond 1014 Jones. In addition, the device manifests a response/recovery time of 47/49 μs, which is 5 orders of magnitude shorter than a PbS@MoS2 heterostructure assembled through a manual stacking method. Furthermore, its on/off ratio reaches 1.6 × 106, which is 4 orders of magnitude higher than the manually stacked PbS@MoS2 heterostructure. In subsequent work, the same group demonstrated excellent universality of the above paradigm by significantly boosting the photosensitivity of PbS@ReS2, PbS@MoSe2, PbS@MoS2, ZnSe@MoS2, and ZnTe@MoS2 heterostructures.176 Thus far, devices with similar architectures, such as PbSe@MoS2,91 Sb2O3/MoS2,177 and CdSe@MoS2,178 have been extensively achieved. Although 0D material (0DM) photosensitizers can also significantly improve the responsivity of 2DM photodetectors, this comes at the concurrent expense of a slowed temporal response due to the sluggish de-trapping process of nested photocarriers.179,180 It is worth noting that NL2DM photosensitizers can simultaneously upgrade the responsivity and response speed of 2DM photodetectors.97 The main reasons are probably as follows: on one hand, NL2DMs provide a large contact area and an atomically sharp heterointerface with the conducting channels as well as an ultra-short carrier transport path induced by the atomic scale thickness as compared to 0DMs, which are conducive to promoting the de-trapping process of photocarriers in the photosensitizers. On the other hand, the production of 0DMs usually entails the use of dispersants and surfactants, which inevitably introduce a large amount of interfacial contamination, thereby further deteriorating the response speed. In addition to acting as photosensitizers for MSM photodetectors, NL2DMs can also be exploited as photosensitizers for photodiodes. Recently, Lu et al. successfully exploited 2D In2S3 nanosheets as photosensitizers to dramatically improve the photosensitivity of graphene/Si HJPDs.181 Notably, the responsivity of an In2S3@graphene/Si photodetector reaches 4.53 × 104 A W−1, which is ∼1 order of magnitude higher than a pristine graphene/Si HJPD. In addition, its response time is shorter than 40 μs, which is less than 1/10 of that of the latter. These improvements are predominantly ascribed to the following aspects. Firstly, In2S3 enhances the interactions between the device and incident light. Second, the Fermi level of In2S3 is lower than that of graphene. As a result, the Fermi level of graphene is shifted down after the decoration of In2S3 and it leads to an enhancement in the built-in electric field at the graphene/Si heterointerface, thereby improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Third, the introduction of In2S3 induces a pronounced photogating effect resembling that of hybrid 0DM/2DM photodetectors.179,180 Under the driving force of the built-in electric field, photogenerated holes transfer to Si, while photogenerated electrons remain in In2S3, thereby achieving spatial separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, photocarriers can recirculate across the circuit before recombination, resulting in an extremely high photoconductive gain. Moreover, L2DM/NL2DM out-of-plane heterojunctions can be exploited as the photoconductive channels of MSM photodetectors to achieve high-performance photoelectric detection. In 2019, Im et al. produced an out-of-plane MoS2/MoO3 heterojunction by selectively vulcanizing the surface layer of a MoO3 nanofilm and systematically studied its photoelectric characteristics.182 Importantly, compared with a pristine MoO3 photodetector, a MoS2/MoO3 photodetector exhibits higher responsivity and detectivity under both 405 and 638 nm illumination.

With the rapid development of synthesis technologies, non-layered 2D homojunctions have also shown tremendous prospects in photoelectric detection applications. Recently, Jin et al. produced a wurtzite–zinc blende (WZ–ZB) homojunction by self-limited vdWE and systematically compared its photoresponse with pure WZ CdSe or ZB CdSe.183 The ZB CdSe photodetector suffers from a large dark current and low on/off ratio in spite of its high photocurrent. In contrast, ZB CdSe exhibits a low dark current and high on/off ratio, whereas its responsivity is low. Inspiringly, a WZ–ZB homojunction device integrates the advantages of low dark current, high on/off ratio, and large responsivity, providing fascinating material platforms toward next-generation photoelectric detection.
2D/3D heterojunctions, including both Schottky and p–n junctions, can combine novel 2DMs with traditional 3D materials, which are able to introduce fascinating material characteristics whilst simplifying the device fabrication procedures.184–187 In 2015, Yao et al. fabricated a self-powered Schottky photodetector by directly synthesizing a metallic Bi nanofilm on a Si substrate through pulsed-laser deposition.188 Importantly, the built-in electric field at the heterointerface can quickly separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs, while Bi with an extraordinary mobility can effectively collect photocarriers,189 resulting in an excellent on/off ratio beyond 105. This work provides an attractive methodology to develop NL2DM based heterostructured optoelectronic devices. Following this success, Gu et al. developed a self-powered broadband Schottky photodetector by directly synthesizing a metallic SnTe nanofilm on a Si substrate via a thermal evaporation method.190 By virtue of a small bulk gap of ∼0.18 eV as well as gapless surface states, the SnTe/Si photodetector achieves broadband photoelectric detection from deep UV to NIR (254–1550 nm). Owing to the effective suppression of dark current and dissociation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs enabled by the built-in electric field, the device manifests an ultrahigh on/off ratio of 5 × 106 and detectivity of 8.4 × 1012 Jones. On the other hand, in 2019, Lu et al. fabricated a high-performance p–n junction photodetector by manually transferring a vdWE-grown n-type 2D In2S3 nanoflake onto a commercially available p-type Si substrate (Fig. 8).191 Profiting from the built-in electric field along with favourable type-II energy band alignment at the heterointerface, the device can be operated in both self-powered and powered modes. Importantly, it exhibits a broad-spectrum photoelectric response of 400–1100 nm. In addition, its optimal responsivity and detectivity reach 579.6 A W−1 and 2.18 × 1011 Jones, respectively, accompanied by a short response/recovery time of 9/0.131 ms. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability by demonstrating stable photoswitching to periodic illumination over 1050 cycles.

3.3. NL2DM photodetectors with novel functionalities

3.3.1. Polarization-sensitive NL2DM photodetectors. 
Some NL2DMs bear pronounced in-plane anisotropic structural, optical, or electronic properties, giving themselves tangible application prospects in polarization-sensitive photoelectric detection. In 2017, Song et al. achieved polarization-sensitive Vis photodetectors based on 2D Sb2Se3 nanosheets (Fig. 9).192 Generally, Sb2Se3 can be regarded as an assembly composed of 1D (Sb4Se6)n nanoribbons coupled by weak intermolecular vdW forces, i.e., large interchain distance. Therefore, as carriers propagate along the direction of the (Sb4Se6)n nanoribbons, the transport efficiency is relatively high. In contrast, as carriers propagate along a direction perpendicular to the (Sb4Se6)n nanoribbons, the transport efficiency is relatively low because they have to hop between adjacent molecular chains. Importantly, the Sb2Se3 photodetector's maximum/minimum responsivity is 1.58/0.105 A W−1 upon 633 nm illumination with various polarization angles, giving rise to an anisotropic ratio of ∼15. This value outperforms those of previously reported L2DM polarization-sensitive photodetectors.193–195 Most recently, Chai et al. produced a polarization-sensitive photodetector in the IR range by exploiting a narrow-bandgap 2D ZnSb nanosheet as the photoactive channel.149 The device exhibits angle-resolved dark current and photocurrent, which is ascribed to the variation in effective mass along different directions. Its anisotropic ratio of the photocurrent reaches 1.28 upon 1342 nm illumination. Inspiringly, the device remains stable over four-month storage in air, making it competitive for practical applications. Thus far, a series of NL2DMs, including Sb2S3,196 Bi2S3,197 Se,69 Te,198 and ZnSe,199 have also exhibited anisotropic attributes. Therefore, their potential in polarization-sensitive photoelectric detection desires further exploration.

3.3.2. Flexible NL2DM photodetectors. 
Compared with their bulk counterparts, 2DMs manifest excellent deformation tolerance and they thus exhibit broad application prospects in wearable devices.200,201 In 2017, Cheng et al. implemented a flexible photodetector based on a vdWE-grown 2D CdTe nanosheet.101 The device maintains reversible photoswitching characteristics over 50 bending cycles. In 2018, Jin et al. constructed a flexible photodetector based on a 2D CdS nanosheet grown by a self-limited growth method.128 After 200 bending cycles, the device still maintains stable photoswitching characteristics, and its photocurrent remains almost unchanged. Later, Yang et al. realized a flexible broadband photodetector based on a physical vapour deposition-grown SnTe nanofilm on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate (Fig. 10).152 The device retains reversible photoswitching characteristics upon bending angles of 0–180 degrees. In addition, its photocurrent remains almost unchanged during 80 bending cycles upon either 635 or 1550 nm illumination.

Despite tremendous advancements, NL2DM flexible photodetectors, as a rule, still suffer from dilemmas of increased noise,92,100 slowed response speed,101 and reduced photocurrent66,87,100 after bending treatments. This is probably ascribed to the high brittleness of conventional metal electrodes, which are fatally degenerated upon bending treatments due to the introduction of folds, cracks, wrinkles, etc. Recently, all-2D device architectures have proven to be an effective solution to address these issues by leveraging the excellent mechanical properties of all building blocks.202,203 However, the distant contact between L2DMs and NL2DMs may introduce a large vdW gap, which leads to a high potential barrier and is inconducive to the interfacial transport of photocarriers. Recently, researchers have made significant progress in the investigation of the synthesis of metallic NL2DMs. For example, Ma et al. have synthesized hexagonal CoSe nanosheets with a thickness as low as 3.7 nm by chemical vapor deposition.204 Remarkably, their conductivity is as high as 6.6 × 105 S m−1 and the breakdown current density reaches 3.9 × 107 A cm−2. Datta et al. have exploited a low-temperature liquid metal printing technique to achieve the centimetre-scale synthesis of 2D indium tin oxide (ITO) with a thickness down to 1.5 nm.205 Its sheet resistance is as low as 5.4 kΩ □−1. Importantly, the electric conductivity remains almost unchanged at a curvature radius of 2–3 mm or over 3000 bending cycles. Therefore, one can anticipate that metallic and semiconducting NL2DMs are competent to be respectively exploited as electrodes and photoactive channels to implement high-performance all-2D flexible photodetectors.

3.4. Device structure engineering toward improved photosensitivity
Self-powered photodetectors have attracted worldwide attention in recent years due to the advantages of low power dissipation, supressed noise, high photosensitivity, fast speed, and high compactness. To date, most self-powered photodetectors have been implemented on the basis of heterogeneous structures,34,206,207 the fabrication process of which is not only technically complicated but also economically inefficient. In 2019, Gong et al. observed a pronounced photoresponse even at zero bias in a CuBr MSM photodetector with Ag Schottky contacts.59 This phenomenon is ascribed to the unintentional asymmetric contact geometries. However, the self-driven photoresponse has not been systematically investigated in this work. Recently, Lu et al. implemented high-performance self-powered photoelectric detection by designedly introducing an asymmetric geometry in an In2S3/Si MSM photodetector (Fig. 11).208 Firstly, they synthesize triangular 2D In2S3 nanosheets on a fluorophlogopite mica substrate through vdWE, providing a solid basis for asymmetric device geometries. Then, they transfer a 2D In2S3 nanosheet onto an exposed Si window of a SiO2/Si substrate by manual transfer technology and construct asymmetric electric contacts through conventional photolithography. Upon light illumination, photoexcited carriers are generated in both In2S3 and Si. Under the driving force of the out-of-plane built-in electric field at the heterointerface, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are rapidly separated, thereby effectively extending the lifetime of photocarriers. Subsequently, the photocarriers in In2S3 diffuse to the Ag electrodes at both ends. Due to the disparity in the contact length of the electrodes, the carriers collected by them are discrepant, which thus leads to the generation of a net current across the In2S3 channel. That is, self-powered photoelectric detection is realized. Importantly, the In2S3/Si photodetector demonstrates a photocurrent more than twice that of the pristine In2S3 photodetector. It achieves an excellent responsivity of 740 mA W−1. This value is superior to those of self-powered L2DM photodetectors with different kinds of electrodes,209–211 while the device structure of this work is much simpler. Recently, Zhou et al. have also demonstrated a self-powered photodetector based on a Bi channel with asymmetric Schottky barriers, which are ascribed to the inhomogeneous properties of the Bi film and electrodes.154 In summary, these studies describe a facile and novel route to implement self-powered NL2DM photodetectors.

As for photoelectric detection applications, NL2DMs inevitably suffer from the following deficiencies. On one hand, the unsaturated surface dangling bonds significantly strengthen the interactions between NL2DMs and substrates, which may give rise to severe interfacial distortion and carrier scattering.212 On the other hand, the atomic-scale nature of NL2DMs makes the light absorption cross-section extremely limited,213 which is inconducive to the accumulation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Recently, Lu et al. fabricated an ultra-sensitive 2D In2S3 photodetector by combining strain engineering and optical regulation (Fig. 12).214 The device is constructed by transferring a vdWE-grown 2D In2S3 nanosheet onto a SiO2 nanograting obtained by focused ion beam etching. The SiO2 nanograting makes the In2S3 flake partially suspended, thereby suppressing the carrier scattering effect from the substrate.215 In addition, the suspended 2D In2S3 channel bends downward spontaneously, forming strained In2S3 (S-In2S3). The strain engineers the electronic structure of In2S3, which leads to the formation of a seamless in-plane In2S3–S-In2S3 array. The built-in electric field array of the heterogeneous interface can effectively suppress dark current and separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby suppressing standby noise and extending the lifetime of the photocarriers. Furthermore, the SiO2 nanograting can enhance the light absorption of In2S3 by leveraging light trapping effects. By virtue of the above synergistic effects, the device exhibits an ultra-low dark current of 3.2 pA and an outstanding signal-to-noise ratio up to 1.7 × 106. In particular, it demonstrates a remarkable responsivity of 1810 A W−1 and excellent detectivity of 2.09 × 1015 Jones. This work provides an effective scheme to associate photonic/electronic property manipulation with optoelectronic applications of NL2DMs.

4. Photovoltaic cells based on NL2DMs
The photovoltaic effect, which converts light energy into electricity, represents a promising and sustainable technique to mitigate the increasingly aggravating energy crisis and environment damage issues.216–218 Compared with traditional 3D materials, 2DMs manifest a series of appealing characteristics in photovoltaic applications. First of all, 2DMs exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and light weight.219,220 Therefore, 2DM-based photovoltaic devices are highly conformable and portable. As a result, these device can be readily integrated onto surfaces with various morphologies. In addition, the pronounced quantum confinement effect along the out-of-plane direction leads to strongly bound excitons, which dramatically enhances light–substance interactions, resulting in a high power density beyond the reach of bulk materials.221 Furthermore, the diversity of 2DMs lays a solid foundation for tailoring highly-efficient photovoltaic devices through energy band engineering.
However, the surface of NL2DMs inevitably suffers from a vast number of unsaturated dangling bonds, which incur severe challenges to the production of high-quality NL2DM-based heterojunctions. Recently, Zhan et al. developed a cation exchange protocol to achieve in situ production of vertical NL2DM heterojunctions.222 As shown in Fig. 13, a vdWE-grown 2D CdS nanosheet is used as the host lattice. In a Cu+-containing solution, Cu ions will spontaneously penetrate into the CdS matrix and exchange with the Cd ions to form Cu2S. By precisely controlling the time of the cation exchange reaction, the upper layer of a 2D CdS nanosheet can be selectively converted into Cu2S, thereby in situ forming an out-of-plane CdS/Cu2S heterojunction. Upon light illumination, photogenerated electron–hole pairs are generated and they are promptly separated by the built-in electric field in the heterojunction region, resulting in a prominent photovoltaic effect. As for photovoltaic cells, the most critical performance metrics are the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (ISC), and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). The open circuit voltage refers to the output voltage in the open circuit condition. The short circuit current refers to the output current in the short circuit condition. The photoelectric conversion efficiency is calculated by PCE = Pout/Pin × 100%, where Pin is the power of incident light on the effective area, and Pout is the maximum output power of the photovoltaic cell derived from the photovoltaic characteristics. Inspiringly, the CdS/Cu2S photovoltaic cell exhibits an open circuit voltage of 0.17 V and a short circuit current of 2.3 nA, yielding a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 2.1% despite a cell thickness of only ∼30 nm. This value is comparable to state-of-the-art L2DM-based photovoltaic cells.223–226 Although it is still unsuitable for practical applications,227 this work describes a facile paradigm to achieve high-quality vertical NL2DM-based heterojunctions, which circumvents the exorbitant facilities (e.g., molecular beam epitaxy) demanded for the traditional schemes. Thus far, ion exchange has been successfully developed for a series of materials, such as Cu2S,228 CuS,229 CdSe,230 Cu2−xS,231,232 Cu2−xSe,233 MnS,234 and MnCo3.235 It lays a solid foundation for production of various NL2DM heterostructures. In the future, the photoelectric conversion efficiency can be further ameliorated by rationally adjusting the thickness of 2D photosensitive layers and designing the energy band structure of heterojunctions. In addition, coupling NL2DM-based photovoltaic devices with advanced optical antennas, such as plasmonic materials236 and all-dielectric materials,237–239 or photonic nanostructures, such as optical waveguides240–242 and optical resonant cavities,243 represents another promising route to counteract the deficiency of the limited optical absorption cross section of 2D photoactive materials and boost the photoelectric conversion efficiency.

On the other hand, NL2DMs can be readily grown on L2DMs to form vertical vdW heterojunctions,96,97,244 which opens up exciting opportunities toward next-generation photovoltaic applications. In 2019, Zhang et al. developed a vertical NL2DM/L2DM heterojunction for photovoltaic devices by directly depositing a thin layer of MoO3 onto MoS2.169 Impressively, the MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure achieves a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3.5%. Since L2DMs provide an ideal interface for the growth of NL2DMs, this strategy holds great promise to be popularized.
According to previous work, 2D/3D heterojunctions represent another promising device architecture to implement advanced photovoltaic cells.245,246 On one hand, 2DMs act as a counterpart to bulk materials to form Schottky or p–n junctions, which help to separate photoexcited electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, 2DMs serve as high-efficiency carrier collectors to extract photocarriers to the external circuit. Thus far, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of graphene/Si heterojunction photovoltaic cells has exceeded 15%.247,248 However, as far as we know, studies on NL2DM based 2D/3D heterojunction photovoltaic cells have been rarely reported. The main reason is that it is still challenging to produce large-scale ultrathin NL2DMs. In future studies, more efforts should be devoted to addressing this issue.
5. Summary & outlook
In summary, researchers have developed a variety of growth technologies, including vdWE, 2D template assisted topotactic conversion, the space-confined growth method, the self-limited growth method, and the hot-pressing method, to synthesize various NL2DMs and systematically investigated their photoelectric characteristics. As summarized in Table 2, NL2DM photodetectors have achieved compelling responsivity and detectivity, establishing themselves as competitive building blocks toward next-generation optoelectronics to an extent. However, for further development, there are still several issues to be addressed.
(1) Developing new NL2DM members. As is well-known, the categories of layered semiconductors are much fewer than those of non-layered ones. However, up to now, only tens of NL2DMs have been experimentally achieved, which lags far behind that of L2DMs, since the production of the former is much more challenging than the latter. In addition, some of these NL2DMs contain either toxic (e.g., PbS,89 and CdS98) or exorbitant (e.g., In2S3,57 and InF3112) elements, which curtails their scale-up of practical applications. Therefore, the family of NL2DMs needs to be further expanded to tackle various photoelectric detection requirements and more efforts are thus expected to be devoted to the synthesis of competitive non-layered photosensitive materials in a 2D form, such as CuS, CuSe, SnO2, etc.
(2) Wafer-scale production. Although NL2DMs with high crystal quality have been synthesized through various methods, the lateral dimension of the products is largely limited to several tens of μm, as shown in Table 1. Currently, production of wafer-scale NL2DMs is still a considerable challenge. Recently, magnetron sputtering and pulsed-laser deposition have been successfully developed to synthesize centimeter-scale NL2DMs, including Cu2O,249 Bi,153 ZnO,107 In2Te3,150 and VO2,250,251 making them promising alternatives to the existing synthesis technologies. However, 2DMs grown by magnetron sputtering and pulsed-laser deposition, as a rule, suffer from large surface roughness and numerous grain boundaries,252,253 which may degrade their electronic and optical behaviors. Therefore, in the future, more research efforts should be devoted to optimizing the uniformity and crystallinity by either modulating the growth parameters or post-growth treatments.
(3) Interfacial passivation. As shown in Table 2, most NL2DM photodetectors suffer from an unsatisfactory response rate with a response/recovery time with a magnitude of several milliseconds to several seconds. In addition, suffering from poor reversibility of photoswitching has been commonly observed.92,118,151 These demerits are probably caused by a large number of unsaturated surface dangling bonds, which have to be charge compensated through surface reconstruction, electron redistribution, or adsorption of charged species to satisfy the electrostatic balance.254 As a result, interfacial distortions and defects are inevitably introduced. At an atomic-scale thickness, the effect of surface scattering on the carrier transport is particularly pronounced. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to develop surface passivation technologies for NL2DMs. Inspiringly, h-BN manifests excellent chemical/thermal stability, a dangling-bond-free surface, a high breakdown electric field, and a considerable bandgap up to 6 eV, making it an all-sided candidate for dielectric and capping layers of 2D devices.255–257 Recently, based on density functional theory, Guo et al. revealed that the electronic and optoelectronic properties of 2D β-Ga2O3 can be significantly tailored by halogen passivation.258 It is found that both chloride and fluorine passivation can transform 2D β-Ga2O3 from an indirect bandgap semiconductor to a direct bandgap one. In addition, chloride passivation can simultaneously boost the electron and hole mobility of 2D β-Ga2O3. Notably, the hole mobility of chlorine semipassivated monolayer β-Ga2O3 along the b direction reaches 3914 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, surface chlorine passivation can also enhance UV light absorption, which is conducive to photoelectric detection applications. In another study, Yao et al. improved the photosensitivity of Bi/Si HJPDs by passivating the heterointerface with 2D WS2.188 On one hand, layered WS2 can alleviate the interactions between Bi and Si, thereby suppressing interfacial distortions and defects. As a result, interfacial recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is significantly suppressed. One the other hand, WS2 acts as a selective blocking layer. Photogenerated electrons can easily transfer from Si to Bi, while photogenerated holes are blocked. As a result, the lifetime of photocarriers is further extended. Compared with a pristine Bi/Si photodetector, the dark current of a Bi/WS2/Si photodetector is reduced to 1/3, while its photocurrent is elevated by 3 times.
(4) Hybrid dimensional photodetectors. By hybridizing with other nanomaterials, the performance of NL2DM photodetectors can be further upgraded. In 2018, Peng et al. improved the effective wavelength range of 2D CdSxSe1−x by modifying it with PbS quantum dots (QDs).259 The PbS QD/CdSxSe1−x photodetector exhibits a pronounced photoresponse upon 405–1064 nm illumination. Compared with a pristine CdSxSe1−x photodetector, its photosensitivity is ameliorated by three orders of magnitude upon NIR illumination.
(5) Application development. Profiting from the appealing physical characteristics, 2DMs have exhibited tremendous prospects in various optoelectronic fields. Based on the excellent flexibility of 2DMs, Choi et al. fabricated a hemispherical photodetector array.260 The device can be implanted in an artificial eye to convert optical signals into the corresponding electrical stimuli and finally transmit them to an optic nerve system, thereby implementing optical imaging. Recently, Lien et al. achieved transparent photodetectors by exploiting graphene as electrodes, interconnects, and photosensitive channels.261 Based on a device array distributed along the optical path, a proof-of-concept single-pixel focus stacking light field camera is achieved, which demonstrates effective measurement of the optical path/depth. However, thus far, research on NL2DMs has been predominantly concentrated on the detection of optical signals. There are still few studies on integrating NL2DM photodetectors with actual optoelectronic circuits to expand the scope of applications. In the future, researchers need to focus more on developing exotic applications of NL2DM photodetectors in various realms by leveraging the particular attributes of NL2DMs.
As a concluding remark, benefiting from the unique optical and electronic attributes, NL2DMs have come to the fore in the field of photoelectric detection. However, research on NL2DM photodetectors still lags far behind that of L2DM ones. In the future, more attention is expected to be devoted to the synthesis of novel NL2DMs. In addition, interfacial passivation suppressing the surface defects is key to further improve the performances of NL2DM photodetectors. Moreover, novel applications built on NL2DM photodetectors are in urgent need of development. Generally, NL2DMs can complement L2DMs well. A common issue of these two kinds of materials is that the size of the products is limited to hundreds of micrometers. It is still far below the standards of currently mature semiconductor technologies, which are at the magnitude of centimeter-scale. Furthermore, the reproducibility of producing 2DMs notably in terms of thickness and crystallinity needs further amelioration. We anticipate that NL2DMs and L2DMs together will play an irreplaceable role in next-generation optoelectronic devices once these issues are addressed.
