    , Accepted 12th July 2021First published on 27th July 2021AbstractA plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic system was designed with Ag–Pt–AgCl nanocomposites. Branched nanowires of Ag (AgBNWs) were first synthesized on indium-doped tin oxide-coated glass by electrodeposition. Then, the AgBNWs were dipped into an aqueous solution of Na2[PtCl6] at different concentrations from 1 to 5 mM to deposit Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) on the AgBNWs via galvanic displacement. During the PtNP deposition, eluted Ag+ ions reacted with Cl− ions to precipitate AgCl on the AgBNWs. The obtained AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites exhibited plasmonic absorption at approximately 465 nm. The nanocomposites were then examined as photoelectrodes for hydrogen evolution. The hybridization of the PtNPs on the AgBNWs significantly decreased the overpotential for water splitting in the dark, and the large number of PtNPs resulted in a higher efficiency compared to a conventional catalyst. Under blue-light irradiation (479 nm, 100 mW cm−2), the overpotential decreased by −110 mV, and the current density increased by 27.8 mA cm−2. Under red-light irradiation (631 nm, 100 mW cm−2), the shift in onset potential was small, which could be attributed to the mismatching of the plasmonic absorption band with the excitation wavelength. The nanocomposite without AgCl (AgBNW/PtNP) was less effective at lowering the overpotential but more effective at improving the onset potential than AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl. These electrochemical behaviors were explained by the synergistic effect of the plasmon-induced photocurrent and charge transfer between Ag, Pt, and AgCl. The nanocomposite retained its photocatalytic activity after 400 cycles; therefore, the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite could be useful for hydrogen evolution devices.
Introduction
The global energy supply and related environmental issues are the greatest challenges in the 21st century. Hydrogen is one of the most promising and appealing energy sources due to its renewability and environment-friendliness while alleviating the fossil fuel crisis and providing a sustainable energy source for the future.1–3 However, most hydrogen is generated as the current byproduct of fossil fuels.4 For sustainable development, hydrogen production from sustainable resources is desirable. Therefore, hydrogen production from water has been investigated. In regard to hydrogen evolution from water, water electrolysis has been conventionally applied. For water electrolysis, noble metals (Pt and Pd) work as effective catalysts, but because of their cost, structural refinement has been developed.5,6
On the other hand, the energy source for water electrolysis should also be considered from the viewpoint of sustainability. While hydrogen production using electricity from solar cells is developing,7,8 a direct energy conversion, namely, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, is also a promising approach.9–12 Some semiconductor photocatalysts have been examined for water splitting.13–15 Most photocatalysts use only the UV region, which is a minor portion of sunlight, and therefore, utilizing a broader range of the available light has continued to be a challenge. Plasmonic nanomaterials such as Au, Ag, and Cu possess broadly tunable optical properties, and their application in visible light-responsive photocatalysts has been examined.16 Since these plasmonic nanomaterials do not effectively catalyze water splitting, they can be coupled with other photocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by acting as a photosensitizer under visible light irradiation.14,17–19 For instance, plasmonic metal/semiconductor nanocomposite systems such as Au/TiO2,20–22 Au/ZnO,23 and Ag/AgCl/ZnO24 have been employed for effective visible light-induced plasmonic hydrogen generation.
To enhance the photocatalytic efficiency, plasmonic metals can also be hybridized with catalysts that are not photoactive. In bimetallic nanocomposites, the contact is ohmic, and charge separation is promoted by the gap in their electrode potentials.25,26 While the high conductivity of metals can facilitate charge transfer, rapid charge recombination can decrease their efficiency. On the other hand, a metal–semiconductor composite can rectify the photocurrent through the use of the Schottky junction, which can extend the lifetime of a photoexcited hot electron.27–29 Considering these characteristics of the two systems, a nanocomposite can be designed with three components: the bimetallic coupling of plasmonic metals with platinum metals, and then a further hybridization with semiconductors to enhance the photoelectrochemical efficiency.
In this work, we present a simple approach for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation using a bimetallic system, Ag/Pt, coupled with an AgCl semiconductor. In our previous works,30,31 metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and branched nanowires (BNWs) were synthesized and hybridized with semiconductors to improve their photocatalytic activity. Then, nanocomposites consisting of branched Ag nanowires (AgBNWs) and Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) were prepared using electrochemical and chemical methods. AgCl was synthesized by an in situ reaction of a precursor (Na2PtCl6) with Ag ions and is expected to act as a semiconductor. Thus, this method is expected to be an easy and effective approach for preparing plasmonic photocatalysts.
Experimental section
Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, Fisher), sodium hexachloroplatinate(IV) hexahydrate (Na2[PtCl6]·6H2O, Alfa Aesar), sodium hexahydroxyplatinate (Na2[Pt(OH)6], Alfa Aesar), potassium nitrate (KNO3, acros organics), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, Fisher), and isopropanol (acros organics) were analytical grade and used without further purification. Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass (sheet resistibility of 25 Ω square−1) was purchased from Aim Core Technology. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was freshly prepared with an apparatus (Yamata, Japan) and used throughout this study.
Synthesis of AgBNWs
ITO glasses were sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in isopropanol and ultrapure water for 15 min and then dried in air at ambient temperature. Then, a portion of the ITO glass was separated by a Kapton film (1 cm × 1 cm) and immersed in a solution (15 ml) of AgNO3 (5 mM) and KNO3 (0.5 M) at room temperature. To perform electrochemical deposition in this solution, a three-electrode system was setup with the ITO glass as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. A constant potential of −0.6 V was applied to the ITO glass for 3 min using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Hokuto-Denko, model HA-151B). Then, the ITO glass was rinsed in water and dried in air at ambient temperature.
Synthesis of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite
The modification of AgBNWs with PtNPs was performed by a galvanic replacement reaction. The ITO glass coated with AgBNWs was immersed into an aqueous solution (3 ml) of Na2[PtCl6] at different concentrations from 1 to 5 mM for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the product was rinsed with water and allowed to dry naturally.
Synthesis of Ag/Pt bimetals
Ag/Pt bimetals were also prepared by a galvanic replacement reaction without chloride compounds. ITO glass coated with AgBNWs was dipped into an aqueous solution (3 ml) of sodium hexahydroxyplatinate (Na2Pt[OH]6) at different concentrations from 1 to 3 mM for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the product was rinsed with water and allowed to dry naturally.
Characterization of materials
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; D2 phaser, Bruker, USA) with a Cu Kα radiation source (0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA; additionally, XRD was conducted at room temperature with a step size of 0.050 and a step time of 5 s in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the elemental compositions were also analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-6500F, JEOL, Japan). The detailed structures of the nanocomposites were observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOLARM200F, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The nanocomposites and the bimetals formed on the ITO glasses were scraped off in ethanol media, respectively. Then, the specimen was poured onto a carbon-coated copper grid, air-dried, and used for TEM observation. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an Auger electron microprobe (Thermo Microlab 350, VG Scientific, USA) with an EX05 ion gun (5 kV, maximum beam current >5 μA at 4 kV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SEC2000, BAS Inc., Japan).
Electrochemical characterization
All electrochemical analyses were carried out using a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell connected to an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER mess system, model XPot-26366, Germany). A Ag/AgCl electrode in 3 M KCl, a Pt wire, and the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite formed on the ITO glass were employed as the reference, counter, and working electrodes, respectively. An aqueous solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.3) was used as the electrolyte for all electrochemical measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark and under visible light irradiation within a potential range of −0.6 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Visible light irradiation was performed with LED light sources (blue light at 479 nm and red light at 631 nm with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2). A Mott–Schottky plot was obtained at a frequency of 20 kHz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using the same cell system at a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz and an amplitude of 20 mV. All of the potentials (E) were measured with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst equation (eqn (1)).32 (1)where ERHE is the potential converted in the RHE scale, EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential using the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and  is the standard electrode potential (0.1976 at 25 °C).
Results and discussion
Characterization of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite
The nanostructures of the AgBNWs formed on ITO glass are shown in Fig. 1. After 3 min of electrochemical deposition, dendritic AgBNWs formed disjointed elliptical plates as previously reported.33 The AgBNWs had backbones several tens of μm in length and several tens of nm in width. A fern leaf pattern developed along the backbones with branches several tens of nm in width (Fig. 1A). After the Na2[PtCl6] treatment at a low concentration (Fig. 1B and C), the AgBNWs maintained the branched structure while corrosion thinned down the nanowires (Fig. 1C), and many nodes (several tens to several hundreds of nm) were found mainly on the AgBNWs. The nodes covered most of the AgBNWs after the treatment in a 3 mM solution (Fig. 1D). The galvanic corrosion on the AgBNWs promoted significant disordering of the nanowires at the highest concentration (5 mM) (Fig. 1E); therefore, further characterizations were carried out mainly for the AgBNWs prepared from 1–3 mM Pt precursor solutions. The EDS spectra indicated that the ratio of Ag decreased and Cl increased as the Pt precursor concentration increased, while the Pt ratio did not significantly change (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†). This result might be explained by the PtNPs being covered by AgCl: in the early stage, PtNPs were formed on the AgBNW; however, the AgCl films became thicker and covered the former PtNPs as the reaction proceeded, while the new PtNPs were continuously formed. The nanostructure of AgBNW/Pt without Cl is shown in Fig. 2 after the treatment with Na2(Pt[OH]6) (1–3 mM). The AgBNWs maintained their branched structure, and PtNPs formed on the AgBNWs. The EDS spectra are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The high Pt contents in AgBNW/PtNP support the assumption that the PtNPs were covered by AgCl in AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl.

 Fig. 2  SEM images of the AgBNW/PtNP bimetals without Cl prepared from (A) 1, (B) 2, and (C) 3 mM precursor solutions, respectively. 
The details of nanocomposites were observed by TEM (Fig. 3). The low-resolution images are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite were separated into a core (Fig. 3A) and a skin (Fig. 3B), which could be due to the mechanical stress during the scraping process. The core was considered to be the Ag nanowire with PtNPs, and the skin could be the AgCl and PtNPs. The PtNPs consisted of coarse particles (several tens of nm) and small particles (a few nm, the inset of Fig. 3B), which seemed to develop on the AgCl film or be embedded in the film. This structure suggests that the galvanic current flowed into the AgCl to reduce the Pt ions on the AgCl film. On the other hand, the AgBNW/PtNP bimetal was partially covered by thin film, which could be AgOH or Ag2O, and the film was not exfoliated (Fig. 3C). The PtNPs (diameter of several nm to several tens of nm) were attached onto the Ag nanowires, which were observed as darker spots due to the high electron density. Thus, the structures of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites and the AgBNW/PtNP bimetals were significantly different. The AgCl film formed on the AgBNW could regulate the PtNP formation and even separate the PtNPs from AgBNW. These differences could affect the electrochemical behaviors of the nanocomposite electrodes.

The structural characterization of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites (prepared from a 1 mM solution) was obtained by XRD (Fig. 4). In the AgBNW patterns, the peaks at 38.52, 44.65, 64.64, and 77.67° were assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of metallic Ag (JCPDS: 04-0784), respectively. In the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite patterns, the diffraction peak of Ag(200) disappeared, and the 2θ value of the Ag(111) peak slightly shifted from 38.52 to 37.74° (JCPDS: 04-0784), suggesting that Pt alloyed with the Ag atoms and increased the unit cell lattice parameter.34 The peaks at 39.72, 45.46, and 67.56° were assigned to (111), (220), and (200) of metallic Pt (JCPDS: 04-0784), respectively. The diffraction peaks at 27.89, 32.26, and 46.23° were for the (311), (222), and (420) planes of AgCl (chlorargyrite, JCPDS: 22-1238), respectively.35,36 Thus, the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl components in the nanocomposites were confirmed.

XPS further confirmed the surface composition of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites (Fig. 5). The main components of the nanocomposite were Pt, Ag, and Cl. As shown in Fig. 5b, the peaks at 368.3 and 374.3 eV were assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, and belonged to the metallic state Ag0, whereas the peaks at 368.8 and 374.8 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, were attributed to Ag+, which verified the formation of AgCl. This result indicated that they coexisted in the nanocomposite (AgBNW/AgCl). In the Pt 4f XPS spectrum, four peaks appeared (Fig. 5c). The strong peaks at 71.0 and 74.7 eV belonged to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, which were assigned to the metallic state Pt0. A weak peak at 72.0 eV (Pt 4f7/2) was assigned to Pt2+, and a minor peak at 78.2 eV (Pt 4f5/2) was assigned to Pt4+.37,38 This result suggested that the Pt precursor was mostly reduced to the metallic state but partially remained as Pt2+ and Pt4+.39 For the Cl 2p spectrum, two peaks for Cl− were observed at 198.5 and 200.3 eV for Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 5d). Therefore, the XPS analyses further confirmed the existence of metallic Ag and Pt with AgCl.

Diffuse reflectance spectra
To understand the effect of the hybridization of AgBNWs with PtNPs and AgCl in terms of optical properties, diffuse reflectance spectra of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites were measured in the UV-vis region. The diffuse reflectance spectra of samples were analyzed using the Kubelka–Munk theory (eqn (2)).14 (2)where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function, R is the experimentally measured diffuse reflectance, K is the absorption coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient. As shown in Fig. 6, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites exhibited significant optical absorption from 420 to 500 nm with a maximum absorption at approximately 460 nm, which could be due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Ag nanostructures.40 The hybridization of AgBNWs with PtNPs and AgCl (1–5 mM precursor concentration) decreased the K/S ratio, which could be explained by the AgBNWs being covered by PtNPs.
 Fig. 6  Diffuse reflectance spectra of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites converted by the Kubelka–Munk theory. 
The change in spectra of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites from the AgBNWs revealed that treatment with the Pt precursor first decreased the F(R) at approximately 450 nm and then at approximately 460 nm. This change indicated the degradation and coverage of the Ag nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 1.14,24,25 The change in the LSPR also suggested a change in the electronic interactions of the composite.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical performances of the nanocomposite photoelectrodes were evaluated in an aqueous solution (0.5 M H2SO4) in the dark and under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6). The overpotential (at −1 mA cm−2) and current density (at −0.4 V vs. RHE) are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 7a shows the LSV curves of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl photoelectrodes versus RHE. Under dark conditions, the AgBNWs exhibited an overpotential of −0.35 V. The Pt wire, used for a comparison, exhibited an onset potential of approximately −0.13 V, which indicated that Pt had a higher catalytic activity than Ag. After hybridization, the overpotential of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (1–5 mM) shifted between −0.21 and −0.24 V, which was between that of the AgBNWs and Pt wire.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent responses of (a) AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl in the dark and under blue light; (b) under blue light and red light, (c) AgBNW/PtNP under dark and blue light. 
Under blue-light irradiation, the AgBNWs exhibited a current density of −10.8 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V, which was 6 times higher than the value in the dark (−1.8 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V). The overpotential shifted to −0.05 V, which was higher than that in dark conditions (ΔV = 0.30 V). These changes should be attributed to the plasmon-induced photocurrent.41,42 Compared to the AgBNWs, the overpotential of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (1 mM) photoelectrode shifted toward a more positive potential at 0.01 V under blue-light irradiation, although the shift from dark conditions (ΔV = 0.24 V) was smaller than that of the AgBNWs. The photocurrent density at −0.4 V increased by two times that of the AgBNWs. These results indicated that the hybridization of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl slightly decreased the plasmonic effect on the potential shift; however, the PtNPs lowered the energy barrier of the electrochemical reactions more effectively. The electron-sink function of PtNPs, which significantly decreased the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs with the support of the AgCl semiconductor,43,44 was also suggested.
The AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (2 mM) electrode resulted in a high current density value of ∼−27.8 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V under blue-light irradiation, which was 3.9 times higher than that in the dark (∼−7.2 mA cm−2). The overpotential shifted to ∼0.02 V under blue-light irradiation, which was higher than that of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (1 mM), and the shift in the overpotential in the dark was the same (ΔV = 0.24 V). This tendency in the overpotential was the same in AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (3 mM). The efficiency of the energy conversion could be estimated to be ∼8% from the gap in the power of the photocurrent between the dark and illuminated conditions (19.9 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V for the electrode prepared from the 2 mM solution) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The electrode prepared from the highest concentrations (5 mM) decreased both the photocurrent density and the overpotential. This result could be due to the destruction of the AgBNW structures (see Fig. 1E), which decreased the surface area and the LSPR effect.
The irradiation of red light (631 nm) also shifted the overpotential from 0 to 0.1 mV. The shifts from the dark condition were 0.20, 0.16, and 0.14 V for the electrodes prepared in 1, 2, and 3 mM solutions, respectively. The photocurrent densities were half of those of the corresponding electrodes under blue-light irradiation (Fig. 7b). These lower efficiencies under red-light irradiation compared to that under blue-light irradiation would be due to the low energy of red light itself and the mismatching of the plasmonic resonance; in other words, red light could not effectively excite the plasmonic current of the AgBNWs (Fig. 6).45,46
To confirm the effects of AgCl, the AgBNW/PtNP nanocomposite was prepared from a solution of Na[Pt(OH)6]. As shown in Fig. 7c, AgBNW/PtNP without AgCl exhibited a low photocurrent density (∼−13.2 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V for the nanocomposites prepared in the 2 and 3 mM solutions) and a high overpotential compared to the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite under blue-light irradiation. This result could be due to the effects of AgCl decreasing the electron–hole recombination and facilitating the plasmon energy transfer mechanism.44 On the other hand, the overpotential shifted toward the more positive side (0.03, 0.11, and 0.10 V for 1, 2, and 3 mM, respectively) than that of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (from 0.01–0.03 V), which indicated that the energy level of electrons in AgBNW/PtNP was higher than that in AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl under blue-light irradiation. The shift in overpotential from the dark condition was also higher than that of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (ΔV = 0.21, 0.29, and 0.27 V for 1, 2, and 3 mM, respectively) and slightly lower than that of the AgBNWs (0.30 V). These results suggested that AgCl relaxed the hot electrons generated by the LSPR in the AgBNWs in exchange for extending the charge separation. Thus, the role of AgCl in the nanocomposite was confirmed.
To assess the photoelectrocatalytic activity and to interpret the reaction mechanism, the relationship between the potential and current was analyzed using the Tafel equation (eqn (3)).47 η = a + blogj(3)where η is the overpotential, a is the Tafel constant, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the measured current density. Three principal steps were proposed for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media:48 the Volmer reaction (eqn (4)), the Heyrovsky reaction (eqn (5)), and the Tafel reaction (eqn (6)). H2O+ + e− → Hads + H2O(4) Hads + H3O+ + e− → H2 + H2O(5) Hads + Hads → H2(6)where Hads describes a hydrogen atom adsorbed on an active site of the photoelectrode surface. The Tafel slopes (b) are theoretically estimated to be ∼120, ∼40, and ∼30 mV decade−1 for the Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions, respectively.1 Hence, the possible rate-determining steps could be simply determined by evaluating the Tafel slope from the HER polarization curve.49 The slope of the Tafel plots of the AgBNWs, AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites (treated by the 1, 2, and 3 mM), and Pt wire were 125.4, 52.3, 49.1, 48.3 and 31.5 mV dec−1, respectively, in the dark (Fig. 8a); this result suggested that the rate-determining step for the HER was most likely the Volmer reaction for the AgBNWs, while it was the Tafel reaction for the Pt wire.50 The values for the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites (1, 2, and 3 mM solutions) were 115, 88, 68, and 65 mV dec−1, respectively, under blue-light irradiation (Fig. 8b). These results suggested that the reactions on the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites were mixtures of the reactions on the AgBNWs and the PtNPs, and the photoreaction on AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl could increase the contribution of the Ag surface. The AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (1, 2, 3 mM) nanocomposites exhibited a concentration dependency on the Pt precursor, which could be explained by the ratio of Ag to Pt on the surface of the nanocomposite (Table 2).

To assess the charge carrier migration and interfacial charge transport resistance of the AgBNWs and AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites, EIS was conducted (Fig. 9a). Using the model circuit, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and solution resistance (RS) were evaluated for the nanocomposite electrodes (Table 2).

The AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl electrodes resulted in a low Rct, which suggested that the galvanic replacement of AgBNWs by PtNPs increased the electrical contact. This effect was supported by the structures of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites (see Fig. 1), in which the PtNPs and AgCl that grew in the voids of the AgBNWs could bridge the Ag nanowires while maintaining the branched nanowire structure. However, this effect became weak when the precursor concentration increased to 3 mM. This result could be explained by the corrosion of the AgBNWs severely damaging the network of Ag nanowires. The RS also decreased due to hybridization when using the moderate treatment (1 and 2 mM), which could be explained by the wettability of ionic AgCl on the Ag surface. However, the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite prepared from the 3 mM solution significantly increased the RS, which could be attributed to the corrosion in the network and the decrease in the effective surface area of the AgBNWs (Fig. 1D).
In regard to the analysis of the charge density at the interface, Mott–Schottky plots were obtained for the photoelectrodes (Fig. 9b). Since AgCl is an N-type semiconductor, the Mott–Schottky relationship is provided as eqn (7).51 (7)where CS is the depletion layer capacitance (CS−2 = (−ωZ′′)2, in which ω is the angular frequency and Z′′ is the imaginary impedance), e is the charge of an electron, εr is the relative permittivity of the medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the surface area of the electrode, Nd is the volume carrier density, E is the applied potential, Efb is the flat-band potential, K is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The slope and flat-band potential could be estimated by extrapolating the Mott–Schottky plot to the x-axis to obtain the intercept (CS−2 = 0). All the samples displayed positive slopes (Fig. 8b and Table 3), and the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (2 mM) electrode showed the smallest slope, followed by AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (3 mM and then 1 mM) in the Mott–Schottky plot. This result could be due to AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (2 mM) having the largest surface area, which was consistent with the EIS results mentioned above. The hybridization of the AgBNWs with AgCl and PtNPs at the optimum ratio could increase the number of electron carriers on the electrode, and the improved performance of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (2 mM) photoelectrode could be partially explained by this phenomenon. The flat-band potential (Efb) of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (2 and 3 mM) nanocomposites shifted to more negative values compared to AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl (1 mM), which could be due to changes in the ion species adsorbed on the surface.

The stability of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite under blue-light irradiation was studied (Fig. 9c). No significant changes in the current density and onset potential were observed in the LSV curves before and after 400 cycles, which suggested the excellent stability of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl photoelectrode. This performance might be due to the strong bonds among the AgBNWs, PtNPs, and AgCl nanostructures.
Thus, the mechanism of the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite photoelectrodes in the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction could be conclusively proposed as that shown in Scheme 1. The AgBNWs absorbed visible light via its LSPR effect and generated hot electrons. The hot electrons took various energy level above the Fermi level, and were injected into AgCl through an energy barrier.52,53 Then, the hot electrons were again transferred from the AgCl to PtNPs for the photoreaction. The PtNPs are not photoactive under visible light but accept the photocurrent from the plasmonic metals to work as an active site in water splitting reactions.46
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram showing the energy level, the routes of electron transfer, and the hydrogen generation mechanism on the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite, where EVAC is the vacuum level, EG is the band gap, EF is the Fermi level, EC is the conduction band level, and EV is the valence band level, respectively. 
At the metal–semiconductor interface, the barrier height (φSB) is estimated from the gap of the work function of metal (φM) and the electron affinity of the semiconductor (χS) as eqn (8).54 φSB = φM − XS(8)Now, the bandgap of AgCl is 3.26 eV, and the positions of the conductive and valence bands are −0.06 and 3.20 eV vs. NHE, respectively.35 The work function of Ag (φAg) is ∼0.3 eV vs. NHE (i.e. ∼4.8 eV vs. vacuum level), and therefore the barrier height (φSB,Ag) at the Ag/AgCl interface is calculated as ∼0.36 eV with an ohmic contact, while the χS is ∼4.44 eV.35,55,56 For AgCl/Pt interface, the work function of Pt is 5.15–5.65 eV,57,58 and therefore the Schottky barrier height (φSB,Pt) is around 0.71–1.21 eV. In the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite, a new common Fermi level was spontaneously formed toward equilibrium, which could promote the electron transfer from AgBNW to PtNP. In the PCE reaction, the hot electrons were relaxed in the AgCl, and the barriers could decrease the efficiency of electron transfer. Thus, the bias potential, which was induced by the galvanic action, the LSPR, and the instrumentally applied potentials, was required to overcome the potential barriers.59 The Schottky barrier formed at the AgCl/PtNP interface prevented the backward flow of electrons to increase the current density. In contrast, the hot electrons could directly transfer from the AgBNW to the PtNP through the bimetallic junction, which resulted in the highest potential in the PCE reaction using the AgBNW/PtNP bimetal; however, the charge recombination decreased the current density because the rectification effect of the Schottky barrier didn’t occur. Such direct electron transfer could partially occur even in the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposite through the bimetallic junction. Since the size of metallic nanostructure and the film thickness of semiconductor also strongly affected the barrier height and the efficiency of electron transfer,59–61 the details of reaction mechanism should be analyzed with nano-scale resolution in the future.
Conclusions
A series of AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl nanocomposites was successfully fabricated using the electrodeposition of AgBNWs on ITO glass followed by galvanic displacement in an aqueous solution of Na2[PtCl6] at different concentrations. During the displacement, AgCl deposited on the AgBNWs to form the AgBNW/PtNW/AgCl nanocomposites, and the ratio of AgCl increased as the concentration of Pt precursor increased. Compared with pristine AgBNWs, the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl photoelectrodes improved the photoelectrochemical performance with a concentration dependency. The AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl prepared from the 2 mM precursor solution resulted in the highest current density, which was 2.6 times as high as that of AgBNW, under blue light irradiation (479 nm). Among the irradiation conditions on this AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl electrode, the blue light irradiation generated the current density 3.9 times higher than in the dark condition and 2 times higher than under red light irradiation (631 nm). Moreover, the blue light irradiation significantly shifted the onset potential (at −1 mA cm−2) to the more positive value compares to the dark (ΔV = 0.24 V) and red light conditions (ΔV = 0.08 V). The high effectiveness of the blue light was explained by the plasmonic resonance of AgBNW, which had the absorption band at 465 nm. Moreover, AgBNW/PtNP without AgCl under visible-light irradiation exhibited a small effect on increasing the photocurrent density but improved the onset potential (ΔV = 0.09 V, compared to the AgBNW/PtNP/AgCl). This behavior was explained by the relaxation of electrons and rectification in AgCl; however, excess AgCl decreased the photoactivity due to corroding the AgBNWs. Thus, combining the synergistic effects of the plasmonic charge separation of the AgBNWs, the electron sinking function of Pt, and the charge separation of AgCl could be a promising approach for developing water-splitting photoelectrodes.
