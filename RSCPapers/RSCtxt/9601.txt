    , Accepted 19th August 2011First published on 15th September 2011AbstractA thin layer of CuInS2 and CdS quantum dots (QDs) is deposited on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs) to form CdS/CuInS2/TNTs photoelectrodes. The CuInS2 layer is prepared by a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction method, and the CdS QDs are deposited by a chemical bath deposition method. The CuInS2 layer acts as both a co-sensitizer and an energy barrier layer between TNTs and CdS QDs. The deposited CuInS2 layer significantly extends the visible-light response of CdS-sensitized TNTs into 500–700 nm wavelength range. As a consequence, the photoelectrochemical response of the CdS/CuInS2/TNTs electrodes is much improved compared with CdS sensitized TNTs. The CdS/CuInS2/TNTs electrodes exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.3%, which is a 120% improvement compared with the highest efficiency of 3.3% for CdS/TNTs electrodes in our study. The improved efficiency is mainly due to the increased absorbance and the reduced recombination between the photoinjected electrons and the redox ions from the electrolyte, resulting from the formation of a CuInS2 layer.
Introduction
In recent years, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention as a novel candidate for the third generation solar cells.1,2 Titania (TiO2) is widely used as a photoelectrode in QDSCs; however, due to its high band gap of 3.2 eV, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,3,4CdTe,5–7CdSe,8–11 and PbS12,13 are incorporated on TiO2 photoelectrodes as sensitizers to extend the activity of the photoelectrode into the visible light region. Among QD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells, CdS sensitized TiO2 nanotube (TNT) cells show a better performance. The power conversion efficiency up to 4.15% was reported for CdS-QDs sensitized TNTs photoelectrodes.14 Recently, we improved the conversion efficiency of CdS QDs sensitized TNTs photoelectrodes using a ZnO energy barrier layer to reduce the charge recombination.15 However, CdS-TNTs absorb mainly in the wavelength region from 300 to 500 nm because of the wide band gap of TiO2 and CdS (2.4 eV), indicating that a large percentage of sunlight with the spectrum ranging 300–2500 nm is still wasted. To further improve the efficiency of CdS sensitized TNTs cells, it is needed to improve the optical absorption of the CdS/TNTs cells in the wavelengths greater than 500 nm. A typical strategy for this purpose is to use another material with complementary absorption spectra in the visible spectrum to co-sensitize TNTs with CdS QDs. Therefore, QDs with lower band gaps than that of CdS are needed. For example, CdSe QDs with the band gap of 1.7 eV have been used to co-sensitize TiO2 photoelectrodes and ZnO nanowire arrays.16–18 Compared with CdSe, copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) is a promising light-absorbing material for solar cells19–30 because it has a smaller direct band gap of 1.5 eV and has a large absorption coefficient (α = 5 × 105 cm−1).21,26 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, the conduction band level (−4.1 eV) of CuInS229 is much lower than that (−3.7 eV) of CdS and higher than that (−4.2 eV) of TiO2, which indicates that the electrons can transfer from CdS (or CuInS2) to TiO2 efficiently. Therefore, a CuInS2 layer can act as an energy barrier layer to block the recombination of photoinjected electrons with redox ions from the electrolyte. As discussed above, CuInS2 can be used as a co-sensitizer in CdS sensitized TiO2 electrodes. Although both CuInS2 and CdS have been used in CuInS2 based thin film photovoltaics,22,24,27,28CuInS2 film with a thickness of several micrometres is used as an absorber and CdS is only used as a buffer layer and not as an absorber on the CuInS2 film. Recently, CuInS2 QDs were applied as a light-absorbing material for inorganic solar cells23,25,30 and inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells.26,29 However, it is found that, in all of these solar cells, CuInS2 QDs were deposited on nanocrystalline TiO2 films, not on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs). The main reason for this phenomenon may be that the methods used to deposit CuInS2 QDs on nanocrystalline TiO2 films in these cells, such as the solution synthesis method23,26,30 and the molecular precursor decomposition method,25 are not suitable for depositing CuInS2 QDs on TNTs because of the smaller aperture of TiO2 nanotubes. Recently, Liet al. reported CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized porous TiO2 solar cells,30 and incorporation of CuInS2 nanoparticles into TNTs was once tried.31 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized QDSCs based on TNT arrays. In this work, we have successfully fabricated CdS/CuInS2 QD co-sensitized TNTs. CuInS2 QDs were coated on TNTs by a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method and subsequently CdS QDs were deposited on the TNTs by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. A thin layer comprising CuInS2 QDs aggregates was formed on the TNTs and this CuInS2 QDs layer acts as a co-sensitizer and an energy barrier. Due to the dual function of the CuInS2 QDs layer, the efficiencies of CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized TNTs are significantly enhanced compared with CdS-sensitized TNTs. The surface morphology, structure characterization, optical property, and photoelectrochemical properties of the CdS/CuInS2 TNTs are studied in detail with the comparison to those of CdS-sensitized TNTs.

Experimental
Materials

          Titanium foil (Ti, Goodfellow, 0.1 mm thickness, 99.6% purity), cadmium chloride (CdCl2, Kanto Chemical Co, 98.0%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Sigma–Aldrich, 98+%), ethylene glycol (Junsei Chemical Co, 99.0%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S, Sigma-Aldrich, 98.0%), cupric chloride (CuCl2, Junsei Chemical co., Ltd, >97.0+%) and indium chloride (InCl3, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%).
Synthesis of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs)
Highly ordered and vertically oriented TNTs were prepared by anodization of Ti sheets in an electrolyte consisting of 0.5 wt% ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and 1.5 wt% distilled (DI) water in ethylene glycol (EG) at 60 V for 5 h. A detailed experimental procedure has been described in our previous paper.15 After anodization, the samples were washed with DI water to remove the occluded ions and dried in a N2 stream. Finally, the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 deg min−1 at ambient conditions.
Fabrication of CuInS2 coated TNTs

          CuInS2 as an inorganic photoabsorption layer was deposited on TNTs with a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Such cycle-dependent layer-by-layer growth in a solution-phase SILAR process is a very powerful thin film growth technique.32 Briefly, the as-prepared TNTs electrodes were successively immersed in six different beakers for about 40 s each: beakers contained a 5 mM InCl3 aqueous solution, a 5 mM CuCl2 aqueous solution, and a 50 mM Na2S aqueous solution, respectively, and the other three contained DI water to wash the samples to remove the excess of each precursor. One dipping cycle of the SILAR procedure consists of firstly immersing the as-prepared TNTs electrodes into InCl3 solution followed by DI water washing, secondly immersing into Na2S solution followed by DI water washing, thirdly immersing into CuCl2 solution followed by DI water washing, and finally in Na2S solution followed by DI water washing. The deposited samples were then placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 40 min. After several cycles and heat treatment, the color of the initially gray electrodes became brownish. The TNTs sample after m cycles of CuInS2 deposition was denoted as CuInS2(m)/TNTs.
Fabrication of CdS QDs sensitized CuInS2/TNTs electrodes
CdS QDs were deposited on the prepared CuInS2/TNTs electrodes by the CBD approach. The precursor comprises a 50 mM CdCl2 aqueous solution and a 50 mM Na2S aqueous solution. A detailed synthesis process of CdS QDs can be obtained from our previous publication.15 The CuInS2 coated TNTs sample after n cycles of CdS deposition was denoted as CdS(n)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs. In addition, to investigate the effects of CuInS2 layers, CdS sensitized plain TNTs electrodes without CuInS2 layers were also fabricated by the same process.
Characterization
The as-prepared pure TNTs CuInS2 coated TNTs and CdS QDs sensitized CuInS2/TNTs were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques. The surface morphologies of the as-prepared electrodes were monitored using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI, Nova 230). The top view and direct cross-section thickness measurements were carried out at beam potentials of 15 kV. Small angle X-ray diffraction (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V diffractor) is used to confirm the crystalline phase and structure. Field emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM) measurements were carried out by scratching a portion of CdS/CuInS2/TiO2 sample from the Ti foil in ethanol, followed by ultrasonication for a few minutes. Then, a drop of ethanol was placed on a carbon grid and subjected to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). TEM analysis was carried out on a Tecnai G2 F30 TEM (FEI Company) with an Oxford instruments EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) detector coupled at 300 kV. The UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy was obtained from a spectrometer with a SA-13.1 diffuse reflector (Scinco Co. LTD, S-4100).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a 300 mL rectangular quartz cell using a three electrode configuration with the as-prepared samples as working electrode, a Pt foil as counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1.0 M Na2S aqueous solution. The working electrode with a surface area of 0.5 cm−2 was illuminated using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a digital power meter), and the photocurrent responses of the working electrodes were recorded during a voltage sweep from about −1.4 to 0.6 V.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a and b show typical top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of the plain TNTs, respectively. The images display a uniform vertical alignment of TiO2 nanotubes with an average diameter of ∼100 nm, a length of ∼30 μm, and a wall thickness of ∼20 nm. Fig. 2c shows a top-view FESEM image of the CuInS2(2)/TNTs. It can be clearly seen that the CuInS2 nanoparticles with the average diameters of about 8 nm are aggregated on the top of the TNTs. The SEM image of one broken CuInS2(2)/TiO2 nanotube clearly shows that CuInS2 nanoparticles are deposited on the inner surface of TNTs (Fig. 2d). It can be found that CuInS2 nanoparticles are aggregated to form a thin film on the inner surface of the nanotube. The conduction band level (−4.1 eV) of CuInS2 lies between that (−3.7 eV) of CdS and that (−4.2 eV) of TiO2 (Fig. 1); therefore, it is expected that the formed CuInS2 film between TiO2 and CdS nanoparticles could behave like an energy barrier layer to suppress the recombination of photoinjected electrons with redox ions from the electrolyte.15

Fig. 3a shows a top view FESEM image of the CdS(5)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs film. It can be found that some CdS QDs are deposited on the CuInS2(2) coated TNTs. The EDX spectrum demonstrates that the particles deposited on the TNTs are mainly composed of copper (Cu), indium (In), cadmium (Cd), and sulfur (S) (Fig. 3b). The chemical compositional analysis reveals that the atomic ratio of Cu, In, Cd and S is 1.1%, 1.0%, 1.2% and 3.2%, respectively, close to 1:1:1:3, confirming the formation of a CuInS2 and CdS. The crystallinity of the CdS(5)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs film was characterized by XRD (Fig. 3c). The well defined peaks, a hexagonal CdS (1 0 1), (2 2 0) and a tetragonal CuInS2 (1 1 2), (2 1 1), (3 0 1), indicate high crystallinities in the CdS nanoparticles and CuInS2 film, which are in agreement with the reported results.15,20

Fig. 4a and b show the low- and high-magnification TEM images of the CdS(5)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs. Fig. 4a shows that the nanotube structures are not damaged during the CuInS2 film formation and the CdS deposition process. Fig. 4b clearly shows that individual QDs are dispersed onto the inner walls of the nanotubes. In addition, a lot of clear lattice fringes with large space can be found in the nanotube. HR-TEM images confirm that the lattice spacing is 1.06 nm, corresponding to the (001) plane of tetragonal CuInS2 (JCPDS 38-0777) (Fig. 4c). Long and clearly distinguishable lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 4c) indicate the high crystallinity of CuInS2 and the formation of CuInS2 layer on the inner surface of TNTs, which is consistent with the previous results as shown in Fig. 2d. Fig. 4d shows a HRTEM image of one of QDs observed in Fig. 4b. The observed 0.357 nm fringes correspond the (100) plane of the hexagonal phase of CdS (JCPDS 80-0006).

To investigate the suitability of CuInS2 for photovoltaic applications, absorption studies are carried out. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the plain TNTs and CdS(n)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs films. The spectrum shows that the plain TNTs absorb mainly UV light with wavelength smaller than 400 nm. However, after CuInS2 deposition, the absorption edge of the CuInS2(m)/TNTs films appears at about 700 nm. The absorbance of the spectra of the CuInS2(m)/TNTs films increases significantly not only in the UV region but also in the visible region, which is mainly due to the formation of the CuInS2 layer coated on the TNTs. These results confirm that CuInS2 layer can effectively improve the light absorption property of the TNTs film. In addition, the size of individual CuInS2 QDs is about 8 nm. The band gap of CuInS2 QDs can be calculated from Kayanuma's formula.33 Our calculation results show that the band gap of CuInS2 QDs increases less than 0.1 eV compared with that of bulk CuInS2, indicating that the quantum size effect is not significant. Therefore, the absorption band of CuInS2(m)/TNTs films between 500 and 700 nm may be mainly attributed to the intrinsic absorption of CuInS2. Moreover, the conduction band level of CuInS2 QDs in our case may be about −4.1 eV, which is very close to the previously reported value.29 Compared with the plain TNTs and CuInS2(m)/TNTs, a further increase in the absorbance of the spectra of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs can be found, which can be attributed to the absorption of CdS QDs.15,30 Moreover, for the CdS(n)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs, the absorbance increases with the cycles of CdS or CuInS2 deposition, indicating an increased adsorption amount of CdS or CuInS2.15,30 For the CdS(n)/TNTs films, the effect of the cycles of CdS deposition on the optical property has been carefully studied in our previous work.15 In addition, for the co-sensitized films (i.e., the CdS(n)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs), the absorbance is higher than that of the CuInS2(m)/TNTs or CdS(n)/TNTs films. Apparently, the co-sensitized films have complementary and enhancement effects in the light harvest, which is similar to the case of CdS and CdSe co-sensitized films.16

To investigate the influence of CuInS2 layers on the photoelectrochemistry property of plain TNTs and CdS-sensitized TNTs, potentiodynamic scans on the plain TNTs, CuInS2 coated TNTs, CdS sensitized TNTs and CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized TNTs electrodes were performed from −1.4 V to 0.6 V vs. a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode with a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1 under UV light irradiation. For a cycle m = 2, Fig. 6a shows the J–V characteristics of the plain TNTs, CuInS2(2)/TNTs, CdS(n)/TNTs and CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes. The observed dark current density for the plain electrode is negligible. Under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the photocurrent generated from the CdS(n)/TNTs electrodes increases with increasing CBD cycles. After 15 cycles, the saturated photocurrent density increases to about 4.4 mA cm−2 which is in agreement with our previous report.15 The increased photocurrent can be attributed to the increased amount of CdS.15,34 For the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes, after the deposition of CuInS2 layer on the TNTs, a significant increase in the photocurrent density was observed, which may be due to the contribution of CuInS2 sensitizer. The saturated photocurrent density of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes also increases markedly with the cycles of CdS deposition to about 10 mA cm−2, which is 2.1 times the value of the CdS(n)/TNTs electrodes. In addition, it can be observed that, for a certain cycle n and an applied potential, the photocurrent of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrode is much higher than that of the CdS(n)/TNTs electrode when V > −1.0 V vs.Ag/AgCl. Apparently, the photocurrent of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes has been enhanced largely by the CuInS2 layer. There may be two reasons for these results. The first reason may be the increased absorbance of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes. As shown in Fig. 5, after the formation of CuInS2 layers, optical absorption of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes was improved significantly in the wavelengths greater than 500 nm, which led to an increased photocurrent density. The second reason may be the reduced recombination of photoinjected electrons with redox ions from the electrolyte in the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes. As reported in our previous work,15 the recombination can be reduced through the interposition of an energy barrier layer between the TNTs and electrolyte. In the present study, because the conduction energy level of CuInS2 is lower than that of CdS, but higher than that of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 1, the CuInS2 layer acts like the ZnO layer to block the recombination of photoinjected electrons with redox ions from the electrolyte. The recombination between the electrons in the conduction band and the redox ions of the electrolyte can be represented by the dark current.15,35 As an example, the J–V characteristics of CdS(5)/TNTs and CdS(5)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes in the dark are measured and the results are shown in Fig. 6b. Apparently, for an applied potential V > −1.0 V vs.Ag/AgCl, the dark current of the CdS(5)/CuInS2(2)/TNT electrodes is much smaller than that of CdS(5)/TNT electrodes, which indicates that the recombination is reduced by the CuInS2 layer.

Additionally, it is possible to calculate the contribution of both the light absorbed by the CuInS2 QDs and the reduced recombination caused by the CuInS2 layer to the photocurrent density of the CdS/CuInS2/TNT electrodes. The photocurrent of the CdS/CuInS2/TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) is originated from (1) TNTs themselves, (2) CdS to TNTs, (3) CuInS2 to TNTs, and (4) the effect of the CuInS2 layer as an energy barrier. According to our measurement results shown in Fig. 6 of our manuscript, CdS(10)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs had the saturation photocurrent density of 9.8 mA cm−2, whereas the current density of pure TNTs, CdS(10)/TNTs, and CuInS2(2)/TNTs is 0.36 mA cm−2, 4.7 mA cm−2, and 0.92 mA cm−2, respectively. Then, the current densities from CdS to TNTs and from CuInS2 to TNTs are 4.34 mA cm−2 and 0.56 mA cm−2, respectively. From these values, we can roughly estimate that the CuInS2 layer contributes 4.54 mA cm−2 as an energy barrier, which is much larger than the 0.56 mA cm−2 that corresponds to the current density originating from the CuInS2 sensitizer. Therefore, the major effect of CuInS2 on the photocurrent improvement is an energy barrier layer. Moreover, the highest electrode potential Eaoc (vs.Ag/AgCl) of the CdS(n)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrodes under open circuit conditions is about 1.18 V which is close to that of reported CdS/KCN-treated CuInS2 heterostructures.36
For a CBD cycle n = 5, Fig. 6c shows the J–V characteristics of CdS(5)/CuInS2(m)/TNTs electrodes. It can be clearly seen that, for an applied potential, the photocurrent density increases with increasing the cycles and reaches a maximum about 10 cycles of CuInS2 deposition and then decreases as m > 10. This phenomenon can be explained because of the balance of two effects: As the amount of CuInS2 increases, the light absorption increases and the charge recombination is reduced, thus the photocurrent density increases. However, as the thickness of CuInS2 increases, the amount of CdS would decrease because some pores in the TiO2 nanotubes have been occluded the by CuInS2 layer which may lead these pores to become inaccessible. Moreover, as the empty space inside the TiO2 nanotubes becomes smaller, the light absorption of CuInS2 layers or CdS QDs in the nanotubes would be less effective. These two negative factors make the photocurrent density decrease if the thickness of CuInS2 layer is above a certain value. Therefore, from the results shown in Fig. 6a and c, it is found that for the CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized TNTs electrodes, the electrode prepared by 10 cycles of CdS plus 2 cycles of CuInS2 (i.e., the CdS(10)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrode) has the best performance. In addition, for the CdS sensitized TNTs electrodes, the CdS(15)/TNTs electrode shows the best performance.

Fig. 7 shows the photoconversion efficiency of light energy to chemical energy as a function of applied potential (vs.SCE) for the CdS(10)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrode and CdS(10)/TNTs electrode under UV light irradiation. The efficiency η is calculated as37η (%) = [(total power output – electric power input)/light power input] × 100 = jp [(Erev − |Eapp|)/I0] × 100, where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jp × Erev is the total power output, jp × Eapp is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of incident light (mW cm−2). Erev is the standard state-reversible potential, which is 1.23 V/NHE. The applied potential is Eapp = Emeans − Eaoc, where Emeans is the electrode potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions, under the same illumination and in the same electrolyte. A maximum photocurrent efficiency of 7.3% was observed for the CdS(10)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrode at an applied potential of −0.74 V vs.Ag/AgCl, which is 2.2 times that (3.3%) for the CdS(15)/TNTs electrode at an applied potential of −0.9 V vs.Ag/AgCl. This result clearly demonstrates that significant improvement on the solar cell efficiency can be obtained via depositing the CuInS2 layers on the TiO2 nanotubes.

Conclusion
The power conversion efficiency of CdS QDs sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) has been improved through incorporation of CuInS2 as a co-sensitizer and energy barrier layer between the TNTs and CdS QDs. The UV-vis absorption spectra demonstrated that the CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized photoelectrodes have a complementary effect in the light absorption. The deposition of CuInS2 significantly extended the response of the CdS sensitized TNTs into the 500–700 nm wavelength region. J–V characteristics demonstrated that CuInS2 significantly improved the photoconversion efficiency of the CdS/CuInS2 co-sensitized photoelectrodes due to a reduced charge recombination. Under AM 1.5 G illumination, the maximum photoconversion efficiency of 7.3% is achieved for the CdS(10)/CuInS2(2)/TNTs electrode, i.e., ca. 120% higher than that of photoelectrodes without CuInS2.
