    , Accepted 13th August 2018First published on 14th August 2018AbstractTernary bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) are efficient platforms for improving organic solar cell (OSC) performance. The third component in ternary OSCs is generally chosen such that it exhibits complementary absorption in the solar spectrum. There are few reports on the effect of the intermolecular action between the third component and the binary system. In this paper, two coumarin derivatives with a similar absorption spectrum, coumarin 7 (C7) and coumarin 30 (C30), were used as the third component to achieve ternary fullerene-free OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:ITIC system. As a result, ternary OSCs with 10 wt% C7 display a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.16%, representing a 35% enhancement in comparison with the control device without C7 (7.50%). Moreover, the optimal ternary OSCs show enhanced thermal stability and photo-stability than the binary devices. In comparison, the ternary OSCs containing C30 showed poor performance and stability compared with C7 based ternary cells. The distinct improvements are ascribed to the elevated charge transfer ability and the optimized morphology of the photoactive layer due to the existence of hydrogen bonds, which formed between C7 and ITIC. This study indicates that introducing hydrogen bonds is a promising strategy to fabricate high performance and stable OSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), comprising a binary blend of electron donors and acceptors, are expected to be a great substitute for conventional silicon solar cells in future applications, which have attracted substantial attention owing to their magnificent merits, including low-weight, low processing costs, semi-transparency, flexibility, and compatibility with roll-to-roll technology.1–5 Recently, binary BHJ OSCs with single-junction device configurations have shown optimal photovoltaic performance, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >12%.6–10 However, further improvements in the PCE are still needed for practical applications in the future. A vast research effort has been made toward boosting the performance indexes and operation stability of OSCs, such as exploiting novel organic materials,5,7,11 solvent additives,12 neoteric device architectures,13–15 interface engineering,16,17 and meliorating active layer morphology.18 Despite this, increasing the three significant photovoltaic parameters simultaneously, namely open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF), remains challenging.19,20 As a result, two main strategies, involving fabricating tandem OSCs13,15,21 or ternary OSCs,17,22–27 have been used to broaden optical absorption spectra, proving to be efficient strategies for improving device performance. Unlike binary OSCs, ternary OSCs, which comprise three components (two electron donors and one electron acceptor or one donor and two acceptors) within the active layer, can extend the absorption region of OSCs to the near-infrared and ultraviolet band and avoid using intricate device cell structures, which results in an enhanced light harvesting capability.25,28 To date, the highest PCE reported for ternary OSCs is 13.54%.29
Fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM, for example) have long been the prevalent electron acceptor materials in OSCs. Owing to their unique spherical geometry, they exhibit high electron mobility, strong electron affinity, and isotropic charge transfer.30,31 PCEs exceeding 11% have been attained by fullerene-based OSCs.26,28 Nevertheless, their feeble absorption in the visible region and limited chemical modification impede their further development for practical applications. To tackle these problems and go a step further in efficiency, fullerene-free acceptors seem to exhibit a great prospect due to their broad and tunable photo-absorption region and comfortably tuned energy levels.32 Because of less-than-ideal device performance, fullerene-free OSCs were out of focus until 2015. In recent years, the PCEs of fullerene-free OSCs have increased rapidly from 6% to 13%, outperforming their fullerene counterparts.4,10,33–39 However, their unsatisfactory JSC values have hindered efforts to increase their PCE.
It is generally known that the extended conjugation in aromatic fused rings may contribute to the effective formation of π–π stacking and intensify intermolecular charge transfer,34 which have been utilized universally in the construction of organic semiconductor materials with high mobility. This π–π stacking can strengthen carrier transport by strong intermolecular interactions, but is accompanied by worsened exciton quenching, which causes undesirable exciton dissociation.40 To produce high-performance OSCs, π–π stacking and exciton quenching should be managed and well balanced. A possible solution to this problem is the development of optimal molecular packing modes to realize the most efficient carrier transport without worsening intermolecular π–π interaction-induced quenching. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which could be utilized synergistically with π–π stacking to control the distance between adjacent molecules,41 might be an alternative approach to elevate charge transfer ability and optimize the active layer morphology, resulting in devices with enhanced JSC and FF values. However, few reports have focused on the influence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds on OSC performance, and the working mechanism has yet to be explored systematically.
In this paper, two coumarin derivatives with a similar absorption spectrum, coumarin 7 (C7) and coumarin 30 (C30), were added to a polymer/fullerene-free binary system as an additional donor to construct ternary OSCs. We employ a general strategy to increase the JSC and FF of OSCs by introducing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The champion donor polymer poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl) (PTB7-Th) and non-fullerene acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) were selected as a traditional binary BHJ system because of their good compatibility and excellent photoelectric performance.15,17 C7 was selected owing to its matched LUMO energy level, complementary absorption position with PTB7-Th and ITIC, and hydrogen bond donor ability. Obvious hydrogen bonds between ITIC and C7 were observed and authenticated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and charge density difference (CDD) simulations, which accelerated electron transfer and provided effective charge transport. Furthermore, hydrogen bond interactions improved the BHJ morphology and vertical phase separation. Nanoscale network structures and smoother morphologies have been observed in the ternary OSCs, which can effectively enhance photon absorption and increase the available transmission channels. Meanwhile, PTB7-Th dominates the top surface of the ternary blend film, which is conducive to hole extraction by the top electrode. As a result, a high PCE of 10.16% was achieved by the OSC containing 10 wt% C7, in addition to an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V, a JSC of 18.36 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.66%. The results exhibited a 35% efficiency enhancement compared with the control device without C7. Remarkably, the optimal devices possessed outstanding thermal stability and photo-stability, outperforming the control devices. In comparison, the ternary OSCs containing C30 without the hydrogen bonds in the active layers showed poor performance and stability, though C30 and C7 have similar chemical structures and absorption spectrum. Our results indicated that introducing intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions into ternary OSCs might be a promising strategy for significantly boosting the performance of OSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
PTB7-Th and ITIC were purchased from 1-Material Inc. Coumarin 7, poly(2,3-dihydrothieno-1,4-dioxin)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and MoO3 were purchased from Xi’an p-OLED Technology Corp. Coumarin 30 was purchased from TCI Shanghai. All chemicals were taken from the same batch, used as received without further purification, and stored under N2 in a glovebox to ensure the credibility of the experimental results. All other chemical materials used in this work were bought from Alfa Chemical Inc. or Sigma-Aldrich Co.
2.2. Device fabrication and measurements
The inverted OSCs with ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag structure were constructed as follows. The ZnO sol–gel precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (110 mg, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich, USA) and ethanolamine (31 mg, NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in 2-methoxyethanol (1 mL, CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Active layer materials PTB7-Th, C7/C30, and ITIC were mixed in various weight ratios of (1 − x):x:1.25 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20), and dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) to guarantee 20 mg mL−1 in total. These solutions were stirred at 60 °C overnight under an N2 atmosphere. The pre-patterned ITO glass substrates (15 Ω square−1) were ultrasonicated in detergent water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, subsequently. After drying with a nitrogen gun, the substrates were further processed by ultraviolet–ozone treatment for 30 min. ZnO precursor solution was spin coated onto the substrate at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s, to serve as the electron-extracting layer, followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C for 1 h. Then, the photoactive layer (∼80 nm) was formed by spin-coating in a N2 atmosphere at 3500 rpm for 20 s. This was the general optimum speed for devices doped with C7 or C30. Finally, a thin MoO3 film (10 nm) and Ag anode (150 nm) were thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.3 Å s−1 and 3 Å s−1, respectively, using a shadow mask to ensure an active area of 0.02 cm2 under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa produced by an LN-1102SA vacuum instrument (Shenyang Vacuum Inst.).
The current density–voltage (J–V) tests were carried out under an illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel Sol3A Simulator, calibrated by an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell under atmospheric conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (PV Measurements, Inc.). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) measurements were performed using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-VS spectrophotometer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 80v FT-IR Spectrometer. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) analysis was performed by using a Panalytical X Pert pro. The thicknesses of the active layers were measured using a step profilometer (AMBIOS-XP2). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by using an F-4600 (Hitachi) fluorescence spectrometer.
2.3. Other characterization
The morphological properties of the BHJ active layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using an MFP-3D-BIO AFM system (Asylum Research). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were measured by using a high-resolution TEM scanning probe microscopy system (Hitachi TEM system) at 100 kV. XPS measurements were carried out on EscaLab 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The water contact angle (WCA) experiment was investigated by using a CAM 200 optical contact angle meter.
The geometrical optimization and electronic structure calculations were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in Materials Studio (MS) software. The exchange–correlation effects were treated by using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under generalized-gradient approximation (GGA). The van der Waals interaction was considered using the Grimme scheme. The structural optimization was performed through spin-unrestricted DFT computations implemented in the Dmol342–44 module of MS software, in which the double numerical plus polarization (DNP)45 basis set was employed and the global cutoff radius was set as 4.4 Å. Besides, the entire SCF convergence limit for energy and electron density was set as 10−5 a.u., and 0.001 Ha Å−1 was set for force. After structural optimization, the electron density difference calculation was carried out using the CASTEP42,46 module of MS software. The Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential was employed with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. The force and energy convergence criterion was set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical properties and characterization
The molecular structures of PTB7-Th, ITIC, C7 and C30 are shown in Fig. 1a. In addition to the composition of five-membered heterocycles, there is a strong similarity between the molecular structures of C7 and C30.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the N–H group in C7 can easily form hydrogen bonds with carbonyl group in ITIC, in which the carbonyl group possesses an agile space structure compared with PTB7-Th. In contrast, a methyl replaces the bonding hydrogen in C30, which has no capacity to form hydrogen bonds. The FT-IR spectra of the C7:pentacene composite film, C7:ITIC composite film and C7 single film were firstly investigated for better comparison. Pentacene, which is composed of five benzene rings arranged side by side, cannot form hydrogen bonds with C7. As shown in Fig. 2b, there are no significant changes between the C7:pentacene blend film and the C7 single film. However, there is a clear change in the C7:ITIC blend film. The characteristic waveform shifted to higher wavenumbers in the C7:ITIC blend film. We further investigated the FT-IR spectra of C7:ITIC blend films with different molar ratios to clarify the shift in wavenumber. Interestingly, the intensities of ∼3389 cm−1 vibration bands increased gradually with the increasing proportion of ITIC, while the ∼3339 cm−1 absorption bands eventually decreased (Fig. 2c). According to previous studies, the coumarin and benzimidazole ring systems are planar in the C7 molecular structure, in which intramolecular hydrogen bonds of N–H⋯O type exist.47 The results implied that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds (between C7 and ITIC) and the intramolecular hydrogen bonds (in C7) existed at the same time and ultimately achieved a balanced state in C7:ITIC blend films, which resulted in new absorption bands. The absorption peak was shifted to longer wavenumbers, indicating that hydrogen bonds between C7 and ITIC are weaker than the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in C7.48

Moreover, the geometrical optimization and electronic structure calculations were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in Materials Studio (MS) software to further clarify the influence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds on charge distribution. According to the molar ratio, it is more likely to form unilateral hydrogen bonds between C7 and ITIC. The chemical structure of hydrogen bond-linked and the CDD images of C7 and ITIC are shown in Fig. 2d. The yellow areas in the CDD image denote charge enrichment, while the blue areas indicate that the charge is insufficient. There were obvious charge accumulation and transfer at the connection between C7 and ITIC as a result of hydrogen bonds. The spaced distribution of the electron-rich regions and the electron-deficient regions provided a favourable channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, charges will be gathered in another end of the ITIC molecule backbone, which strengthen the electron-withdrawing ability of ITIC. From previous reports, charge transfer would occur from PTB7-Th to ITIC through π–π stacking between polymer backbones and aromatic fused rings in nonfullerene.9,34,49 It is noteworthy that the influence on the charge distribution from hydrogen bonds will boost up more efficient charge transfer from PTB7-Th to ITIC, resulting in an increased JSC.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTB7-Th, ITIC, C7 and C30 are shown in Fig. 3a.34 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of C7 were at −5.12 and −2.80 eV, respectively.24 The UV-vis absorption spectra of neat PTB7-Th, ITIC, C7 and C30 are shown in Fig. 3b. C7 and C30 clearly exhibited complementary absorption with the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary system, with maximum absorption peaks at 702, 720, 435 and 424 nm for PTB7-Th, ITIC, C7 and C30 respectively.

To further study changes in absorption after doping of the third component, the absorption spectra of ternary active layers containing different amounts of C7 or C30 with a constant donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio (PTB7-Th and coumarins:ITIC = 1:1.25) were measured. The active layers have a similar thickness (≈80 nm). As shown in Fig. 3c, introducing C7 into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend enhanced the light absorbance from 400 to 500 nm, which was consistent with the maximum absorbance range of C7. Notably, a slight increase in absorbance from 600 to 750 nm was observed after adding 5 or 10 wt% C7, suggesting that C7 incorporation improved the crystallinity of the polymer donor,50 which will be discussed further below. However, further increasing the percent of C7 to 15 and 20 wt% caused a slight decrease in absorption. This might be attributable to inordinate small molecules introducing serious phase-separated domains by affecting the crystallization and arrangement of the polymer donor in the ternary blend films.20 Similar changes were also observed in the ternary active layers doped with C30 (Fig. 3d), meaning that C7 and C30 blend films have little difference in absorption characteristics. The PL spectra of the PTB7-Th:C7 blend films with different doping ratios of C7 were studied to investigate the dominant mechanism for C7 doped OSCs. The emission intensities of PTB7-Th (700–850 nm) decreased gradually as the doping ratio of C7 increased, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), implying that the intermolecular energy transfer between C7 and PTB7-Th was inappreciable in PTB7-Th:C7 blend films and that charge transfer was the dominant mechanism in the films.51–53 The results indicate that introducing C7 in the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary system could elevate charge transfer of the host system.
3.2. Device performance
To explore the effect of C7 incorporation into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend system, inverted ternary OSCs based on PTB7-Th:C7:ITIC BHJ films with PTB7-Th:C7 weight ratios of 1:0, 0.95:0.05, 0.90:0.10, 0.85:0.15, and 0.80:0.20 were prepared. For comparison, the same devices containing C30 were also constructed to emphasize the impact on the performance caused by the hydrogen bonds. Higher doping ratios were not used to avoid severe domain separation and heterogeneous film morphology. The D:A weight ratio (PTB7-Th and C7:ITIC) was maintained at 1:1.25, and the device architecture is shown in Fig. 1b. Table 1 summarizes the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of the devices at different PTB7-Th:C7 weight ratios and PTB7-Th:C30 weight ratios. Their typical J–V characteristics, EQE, and IQE spectra are shown in Fig. 4.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the control device, a PTB7-Th:ITIC binary cell, exhibited an average PCE of 7.35% (maximum, 7.50%) with a VOC of 0.80 V, a JSC of 14.87 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.04%. This performance was better than that previously reported by Zhan et al. (PCE of 6.80%),34 which was attributed to the different device structure and D/A ratios used in this work. Compared with the control device, incorporating 5, 10, and 15 wt% C7 into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend system led to a significant enhancement in JSC and FF. Among all doping ratios, the OSC containing 10 wt% C7 produced the best device performance. The JSC of 18.36 mA cm−2 was over 20% higher compared with the control device without C7 (14.87 mA cm−2). Furthermore, this device achieved a VOC of 0.81 V and a high FF of 67.66%, resulting in the highest efficiency of 10.16% (average PCE reached 10.01% for 20 devices), representing ∼35% efficiency improvement compared to the control device (PCE of 7.50%).
However, the ternary OSCs based on PTB7-Th:C30:ITIC showed a deteriorating PCE compared to the PTB7-Th:C7:ITIC-based devices (Fig. 4b), demonstrating indirectly that hydrogen bonds are the pivotal reason for the significant increment in efficiency.
The enhanced JSC and FF of the device show that intermolecular hydrogen bonds could not only elevate the electron-withdrawing abilities of ITIC, which will boost up more efficient charge transfer from PTB7-Th to ITIC, but also optimize the morphology of the BHJ by forming favorable interpenetrating nanoscale networks to increase the available transmission channels. Notably, as the amount of doped C7 increased further, the JSC and PCE decreased to 17.56 mA cm−2 and 9.40% for 15 wt% C7, and 13.79 mA cm−2 and 7.38% for 20 wt% C7, respectively. This was attributed to larger amounts of C7 causing serious domain separation in the active layer, leading to deteriorating device performance. VOC is governed by the energy gap between the donor HOMO level and the acceptor LUMO level. VOC values among the devices were almost unchanged, indicating that C7 had little effect on the energy levels of PTB7-Th and ITIC.

Fig. 4c shows the EQE spectra of the devices containing various amounts of C7. The current densities obtained from the EQE spectra were coincident with those acquired from J–V measurements, with less than 5% difference between the two methods. Adding different amounts of C7 (5–15 wt%) into the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary system improved EQE values throughout the spectrum, perhaps due to the enhanced absorption and elevated charge transfer ability caused by C7, which would directly increase the JSC. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was calculated by using the equation EQE = total absorption × IQE (Fig. 4d). The total absorption was calculated by 1 minus reflectance and transmittance. The IQE of PTB7-Th:C7:ITIC-based devices is more than that of the binary PTB7-Th:ITIC-based device. Especially after doping 10 wt% C7, the IQEs reached over 85% from 640 to 740 nm, indicating that a great majority of absorbed photons were converted to a separated pair of charge carriers. This higher IQE was largely due to efficient charge generation and low recombination.
3.3. Stability test
It is generally accepted that stability is an essential issue for OSCs for practical applications. We utilized heat and light stress to test the stability of the unencapsulated devices.
As shown in Fig. 5, the optimal devices containing 10 wt% C7 exhibited outstanding thermal stability and photo-stability, outperforming the control devices (include the devices based on PTB7-Th:ITIC and PTB7-Th:10 wt% C30:ITIC). For the thermal stability test, the devices were continuously heated at 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C, respectively. Both optimal devices retained ∼80% of their original PCEs after continuous heating for 180 min, while the control devices retained only 40–55% of their original PCEs.

In addition, after continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for 150 min, the devices containing 10 wt% C7 retained 75% of their original PCEs. In comparison, the PCEs of the devices based on PTB7-Th:ITIC and PTB7-Th:10 wt% C30:ITIC dropped to 65% and 40% of their initial values, respectively. These results show that introducing intermolecular hydrogen bonds in BHJ films can not only optimize device efficiency but can also cause a significant increase in both thermal stability and photo-stability, demonstrating a promising strategy for actual applications of OSCs.
3.4. Film morphology
To further understand the effect of C7 on the BHJ films, AFM was used to investigate changes in the blend film morphology caused by different C7 weight ratios. The AFM height images (5 × 5 μm) for PTB7-Th:C7:ITIC films containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 wt% C7, and PTB7-Th:C30:ITIC blend films containing 5, 10 and 20 wt% C30 are shown in Fig. 6. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary blend was 0.944 nm (Fig. 6a). Notably, increasing C7 doping ratios caused only a tiny change in the morphology and RMS of the ternary blend films, indicating that a moderate concentration of C7 had good compatibility with the PTB7-Th:ITIC host system. In the ternary blend films containing 5, 10, and 20 wt% C7, smoother film surfaces with lower RMS roughnesses of 0.704, 0.616, and 0.743 nm were obtained, exhibiting a homogeneous surface morphology (see Fig. 6b–d). As shown in Fig. 6c, more obvious nanoscale network structures along with suitable phase separation can be realized, which are propitious for the formation of more abundant and better transport pathways in the active layer. As for PTB7-Th:C30:ITIC blend films, the introduction of C30 resulted in a significant increase in roughness, 1.032 nm for 5 wt% C30, 1.042 nm for 10 wt% C30, and even 1.538 nm for 20 wt% C30. The over-size domains would decrease the interface of donor and acceptor materials, which accounts for the degraded FF and efficiency.
 Fig. 6  AFM height images (5 × 5 μm) of blend films containing different amounts of C7 or C30: (a) 0 wt% C7; (b) 5 wt% C7; (c) 10 wt% C7; (d) 20 wt% C7; (e) 5 wt% C30, (f) 10 wt% C30 and (g) 20 wt% C30. 
The phase separation morphology of the film was explored in depth by TEM, as shown in Fig. 7. The images showed two regions, namely bright regions, attributed to the PTB7-Th and C7 enrichment region, and dark regions, attributed to ITIC domains. Fig. 7c shows the morphology of the blend film after doping with 10 wt% C7, indicating ITIC-rich domains surrounded by continuous domains rich in PTB7-Th and C7. The ternary film containing 10 wt% C7 clearly exhibited a finer scale and extended phases compared with the other blend films (enlarged Fig. 7f). A considerable interpenetrating network and homogeneous blend film morphology without palpable aggregated domains will guarantee effective exciton separation and charge transport.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of binary and ternary blend films containing different amounts of C7 or C30: (a) 0 wt% C7; (b) 5 wt% C7; (c) 10 wt% C7; (d) 15 wt% C7; (e) 20 wt% C7; (f) 10 wt% C7 with increased magnification; (g) 5 wt% C30, (h) 10 wt% C30 and (i) 20 wt% C30. 
Nevertheless, as the doping concentration increased, the films showed larger phase separation, which might explain the decreased JSC and FF, and consequently, the lower PCE. Overly large domain sizes were observed (Fig. 7e) in the ternary blend film after adding 20 wt% C7, leading to a decrease in exciton dissociation probability and reduced device performance. The films based on PTB7-Th:C30:ITIC showed larger domains and few transmission channel (see in Fig. 7g–i), representing inferior performance. These results were in good agreement with the AFM images, showing that hydrogen bond interactions improved the BHJ morphology.
3.5. Molecules’ distribution
To attain valid charge generation and transfer to the corresponding electrodes, the distribution of the third component (C7) in the ternary photoactive layer films is one of the key elements. Thus, water contact angles (WCAs) were tested to investigate the change of the top surface component caused by introducing C7 in PTB7-Th:ITIC blend films. Theoretically, the nearer the WCA approximates to a pristine film, the more the component is located on the surface of the film. As can be seen, the WCAs for pure PTB7-Th (Fig. 8a), pure ITIC (Fig. 8b), pure C7 (Fig. 8d) and pure C30 (Fig. 8g) are 102.68°, 94.31°, 67.86° and 74.48° respectively, and the WCA of the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend film (Fig. 8c) is 99.25°, close to that of the pure PTB7-Th film, which clearly elucidates that PTB7-Th dominates the top surface of the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend film. Further, the WCAs of the ternary blend films changed a little with the C7 doping concentration, exhibiting an angle of 99.78° for the PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC blend film (Fig. 8e) and 101.18° for the PTB7-Th:20% C7:ITIC blend film (Fig. 8f). These results suggest that the surface of blend films is still governed by PTB7-Th, while C7 distributes inside the active layers due to the hydrogen bonds between ITIC and C7. Such a distribution of acceptor and donor is favourable for charge transport and for restraining carrier recombination, resulting in higher JSC for devices. Moreover, the WCAs of the PTB7-Th:10 wt% C30:ITIC (Fig. 8h) and PTB7-Th:20 wt% C30:ITIC blend film (Fig. 8i) are 95.71° and 93.50°, respectively. The results indicated that C30 was more distributed on the surface of blend films when compared to C7, leading to worse performance.

To further investigate the changes in distribution and crystallinity in the BHJ blend films, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the binary and ternary systems (Fig. 9a). Both binary and ternary blend films showed the same peak at ∼22° associated with PTB7-Th, indicating ordered aggregation and π–π stacking, which helps to improve device performance.34,54 As expected, after doping with 10 wt% C7, a sharper and stronger diffraction peak was observed compared with the binary blend film, which suggested that C7 can promote the crystallization and ordered packing of polymer donor PTB7-Th, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution. These results were consistent with the film morphology observations.

In order to explore how C7 influences the vertical phase separation of PTB7-Th:ITIC blend films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the ratio of atoms at the top surface of the active layer, as shown in Fig. 9b. The elemental content in the top surfaces of blend films with different active layers characterized by XPS is also shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
All of PTB7-Th, ITIC and C7 contain oxygen (O), while only PTB7-Th contains fluorine (F). A high intensity O1s peak (≈533 eV, from PTB7-Th, ITIC and C7) and a relatively low F1s peak (≈690 eV, due to PTB7-Th) are attained from the top surface of the PTB7-TH:ITIC and PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC blend layer. One PTB7-Th repeating unit contains one F atom, and all these three molecules contain two O atoms. From the F/O ratio, the molar content of the donor polymer PTB7-Th at the top surface was calculated: 61% and 72% for PTB7-TH:ITIC and PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC blend films (details in the ESI†),17 which implies that C7 would lead to more aggregation of PTB7-Th on the top surface. High levels of the polymer donor on the top surface are conducive to hole extraction by the top electrode. These XPS results were in good agreement with the WCA results.
The schematic diagram in Fig. 9c is the conceivable distribution condition of the molecules in the ternary photoactive layer containing 10 wt% C7. Introducing 10 wt% C7 into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend film caused the formation of a large number of hydrogen bond networks between C7 and ITIC, and the crystallinity of PTB7-Th markedly increased at the same time, which aggregated at the top of the active layer. As a consequence, the enlarged and available D/A interface was formed, which produced more paths for charge transmission, resulting in a significant increment in JSC and FF.
3.6. Charge mobility and recombination
High level and more balanced charge carrier properties are vital for high-performance photovoltaic materials in OSCs to achieve good device performance. To gain a better understanding of the effects of different amounts of C7, the SCLC method was employed to measure electron and hole mobility in the ternary OSCs. Device structures of ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Au were used for electron-only and hole-only devices, respectively. These single carrier devices were constructed using the topgallant blend film conditions. J0.5–V characteristics and fitted curves obtained for the hole-only and electron-only devices with different C7 doping ratios are shown in Fig. 10a and b. All detailed data are summarized in Fig. 10c and Table 2.

Incorporating C7 into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend system had a large effect on electron and hole mobility. The PTB7-Th:ITIC binary device showed an electron mobility (μe) of 1.97 ± 0.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility (μh) of 6.35 ± 0.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating an imbalanced charge carrier mobility, which increased electron accumulation, resulting in more recombination.
The μe of the ternary blend films increased gradually with the amount of C7. This might be due to the increasing available transmission channels resulting from hydrogen bond interactions. In contrast, μh tended to decrease, which might be largely attributed to PTB7-Th and C7 having similar HOMO levels. Notably, adding 10 wt% C7 to the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend films realized a more balanced charge carrier mobility when compared with no C7 doping. The μe and μh observed for ternary PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC were 6.64 ± 0.44 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.04 ± 0.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced μe and μh values of the device led to weak charge carrier recombination and higher JSC and FF values.55
The charge recombination mechanisms in the devices were further explored by investigating the light intensity (P0, from 100 to 0.3 mW cm−2) dependence of the J–V characteristics. JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity (P0) plotted in double logarithmic scales with the linear fitting are shown in Fig. 10d and e, respectively. The variation in JSC as a function of P0 was modeled using the equation JSC ∝ Pα0. Under short-circuit conditions, α will approach 1 if bimolecular recombination is insignificant, because all generated excitons are swept out prior to recombination.56–58 The α values of the fitted lines for the ternary devices containing 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% C7 were 0.958, 0.960, 0.974, 0.951, and 0.949, respectively. Therefore, bimolecular recombination was lowest in the ternary device based on PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC.59 As shown in Fig. 10e, the slope value for the control device was 1.78kT/q, while those of cells containing 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% C7 were 1.69kT/q, 1.57kT/q, 1.96kT/q, and 1.81kT/q, respectively, suggesting that interfacial trap-assisted recombination was effectively diminished to improve device performance by adding 10 wt% C7.
To gain more insight into the charge generation and extraction properties, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the devices are plotted in Fig. 10f. Jph equals JL–JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities and dark current densities, respectively. Veff is defined by V0–Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at JL = JD and Vbias is the applied bias. Under high Veff values (Veff ≥ 2 V), all photogenerated charge carriers can be extracted by the electrodes and Jph saturates at a relatively constant value (Jsat).60,61 The exciton dissociation probability was defined as Jsc/Jsat, which was calculated as 87.1%, 89.9%, 93.6%, 92.2% and 88.6% for the PTB7-Th:C7:ITIC-based devices with different ratios of C7 under the short-circuit condition, respectively. The enhancement of dissociation probability demonstrates that the corresponding ternary device has a higher exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiency, which is closely related to the high efficiency of the device containing 10 wt% C7. These results were in good agreement with the increase in JSC from 14.87 to 18.36 mA cm−2 after doping 10 wt% C7.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a new strategy for increasing the JSC and FF of OSCs by introducing intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. Ternary OSCs with improved efficiency were developed by incorporating the small organic molecule C7 into the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary system. Hydrogen bonds were proved to exist between C7 and ITIC by FT-IR spectra, which accelerated electron transfer, provided rapid and effective charge transport, and thus increased JSC. Meanwhile, hydrogen bond interactions improved the BHJ film morphology. A remarkable enhancement in JSC (from 14.87 to 18.36 mA cm−2) was obtained by optimizing the C7 doping ratio. The OSC containing 10 wt% C7 showed significantly improved characteristics, which not only enhanced light absorption, but also optimized the morphology of the blend films by forming favorable nanoscale interpenetrating networks to increase available transmission channels. As a result, a PCE of 10.16% was achieved using 10 wt% C7, which represented an efficiency enhancement of 35% compared with the control device without C7. Furthermore, the OSCs based on PTB7-Th:10 wt% C7:ITIC showed enhanced thermal stability and photo-stability in contrast with the control devices. In comparison, the ternary OSCs containing C30 without the hydrogen bonds in the active layers showed poor performance and stability, even though C30 and C7 have a similar absorption spectrum. This study demonstrates that using intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions in ternary OSC fabrication might be a promising strategy to significantly increase the PCE of OSCs. These exciting results can help promote the development of novel alternative doping materials for high-performance ternary OSCs.
