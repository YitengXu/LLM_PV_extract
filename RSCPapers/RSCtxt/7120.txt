    , Accepted 18th December 2013First published on 19th December 2013AbstractPhotocurrent from fullerene excitons in polymer–fullerene solar cells is optimised by employing a series of low bandgap diketopyrrolopyrrole-containing polymers with differing molecular weights. The low LUMO level of this donor polymer prevents efficient charge generation from polymer excitons, allowing us to focus on charge and photocurrent generation specifically from fullerene excitons. We employ femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to show a correlation between fullerene domain size and the kinetics of polaron generation from fullerene excitons, and relate these observations to device efficiency. Charge generation from fullerene excitons is shown to occur on the 0.5 ns timescale, limited by the kinetics of diffusion of fullerene excitons to domain interfaces with donor polymers. For devices employing the highest molecular weight donor polymer, ∼7 mA cm−2 of photocurrent is observed from fullerene excitons, leading to an overall device efficiency of 5.2%.

Broader context
The sun is our most sustainable energy source and can be effectively used for an off-grid and on-grid power supply. However, current solar cell technologies still do not provide low cost power to be able to compete with fossil fuels. A particularly popular approach to reducing the cost of solar cells, gaining a high momentum in the past 10 years, is the use of organic materials as the photoactive component. Such organic solar cells can be fabricated to be light-weight, thin and flexible, thus making them ideal for off-grid applications and building integration. Polymer–fullerene solar cells are a type of organic solar cells that are now reaching 10% power conversion efficiency. In these solar cells, polymers and fullerenes absorb sunlight and generate photocurrent, but the way they do that and what limits their photocurrent generation properties is still currently widely debated and as a result difficult to control. In this paper, we explore the limitations of photocurrent generation from fullerene excitons. We apply time-resolved laser spectroscopy and opto-electronic experimental techniques to show that fullerene aggregation is the main cause for reduced photocurrent generation from fullerene excitons. We show that by careful control over polymer molecular weight, the photocurrent from fullerene excitons can be optimised to give solar cell devices reaching 5% efficiency.

Introduction
Polymer–fullerene organic solar cells (OSC) have the potential to provide an inexpensive and efficient solar technology.1 They consist of a film of a photoactive electron-rich polymer and electron-poor fullerene sandwiched between two electrodes. In the film, both the polymer and fullerene absorb sunlight and their excitons generate charges via a series of charge transfer steps driven by the energy differences of the polymer and fullerene frontier molecular orbitals.2,3 Research efforts have in recent years been particularly focused on developing new donor polymers for more efficient light harvesting and charge photogeneration.4–6 With the development of these lower bandgap polymers, the role of the fullerene in absorbing higher energy photons has become increasingly important, leading to increasing use of the asymmetric, fullerene, PC70BM due to its high absorption coefficient.7 However, relatively few studies have focused on investigating and optimising the generation of photocurrent resulting from this fullerene light absorption.8–12 Such photocurrent generation can be assigned to dissociation of fullerene excitons at polymer–fullerene interfaces, corresponding to a HOMO to HOMO hole transfer reaction.9,10,13
Several studies have considered the importance of fullerene aggregation within the blend film in relation to device performance.12,14–17 It has been suggested that fullerene aggregation may be important in stabilising charge separation and providing more efficient charge transport and collection at the electrodes.18 Conversely, we and others have identified that fullerene aggregation into domains with diameters bigger than their exciton diffusion length can limit device photocurrents due to inefficient exciton diffusion to the polymer–fullerene interface.8–10,13
In this paper, we focus on the kinetics of fullerene exciton diffusion and charge separation, employing blend films of PC70BM with the donor polymer BTT-DPP (see Fig. 1 for polymer's structure). We have previously shown that photocurrent generation in OSC employing these photoactive layer materials primarily results from fullerene light absorption,13 with BTT-DPP excitons being too low in energy to drive efficient charge separation.19 Herein, we employ a series of BTT-DPP fractions with differing molecular weights in order to optimise film microstructure and to investigate the correlation between fullerene singlet exciton dynamics and photocurrent generation. Following this approach we are able to achieve ∼7.3 mA cm−2 photocurrents from PC70BM excitons alone. We furthermore demonstrate that this impressive photocurrent generation is limited by fullerene exciton dissociation in these devices primarily occurring with a 0.5 ns time constant. Optimised devices reached power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 5.2%, with device photocurrents resulting primarily from fullerene light absorption.

For the EQE measurements, cells were kept under constant 1-sun illumination and then exposed to weak monochromatic light. 
Results and discussion
In the devices employed herein, the primary function of the donor BTT-DPP polymer is as a hole transport material, with the PC70BM playing the role of electron transport material and primary light absorber for photocurrent generation. Previously, we have shown that photocurrents from BTT-DPP:PC70BM devices are largely limited by the poor microstructure of the active layer.13 To optimise this microstructure, we synthesised BTT-DPP and subsequently fractionated it to yield three BTT-DPP fractions with number average molecular weights (Mn) of 22 (BTT-DPP-22), 73 (BTT-DPP-73) and 90 (BTT-DPP-90) kg mol−1.20,21 Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with a standard ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al structure. For all three BTT-DPP fractions, a 1:2 weight ratio (polymer–fullerene) blend composition was found to give optimum device efficiency. Fig. 1a shows the J/V characteristics of BTT-DPP-22/PC70BM, BTT-DPP-73/PC70BM and BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM devices under simulated 1 sun (AM1.5) irradiation, with the corresponding performance data being listed in Table 1. The differences in JSC between these devices should be highlighted. The BTT-DPP-90 based device has ∼3.5 times higher photocurrents than the BTT-DPP-22 based device, which can only be partly explained by differences in film thickness (see the ESI†). However, the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of all devices were found to be rather invariant. Therefore, the BTT-DPP-90 based device had a maximum average PCE of 5.2%, whereas the BTT-DPP-73 and BTT-DPP-22 based devices had only 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively. It is also notable that, given these devices were fabricated without any processing additives or annealing steps, their FFs are remarkably high, up to 0.72, indicating that charge collection in these devices is remarkably efficient, as we investigate further below.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 1b primarily track the PC70BM absorption spectrum, with only minor contributions from BTT-DPP absorption in the near infrared, as we have discussed previously.13 We estimate that by de-convoluting the EQE spectra with the polymer and fullerene absorption spectra (shown in the ESI†) the PC70BM light absorption yields on average 70 ± 15% of the overall photocurrent generation in the most efficient devices (BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM). This leads to photocurrent densities from fullerene excitons alone reaching ∼7.3 mA cm−2 for the BTT-DPP-90 device.
In order to investigate this trend in photocurrent generation, we carried out femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy of thin films of the three different molecular weight blends, as well as neat polymer and fullerene control films.22 Blends were excited at 470 nm (primarily fullerene absorption) and 800 nm (polymer absorption). The neat fullerene and polymer films were excited at 470 and 800 nm, respectively. In Fig. 2a, we compare the TA spectra of the neat BTT-DPP-90 and BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM blend films recorded at 0.25 ps and 6.2 ns delay times, whilst Fig. 2b and c show transient kinetics at selected probe wavelengths.

The neat polymer spectrum at 0.25 ps is included as a reference. (b) The corresponding TA kinetics of the BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM blend and neat polymer measured at 1200 nm. (c) As for (b) but comparing blends with the different Mn polymers following 470 nm excitation. Data in (b) and (c) were normalized at 0.25 ps. 
We consider first the neat film data. No detectable signals (<3 × 10−5 OD) were observed from the neat fullerene film under the relatively low excitation densities employed (7.5 μJ cm−2), suggesting that any photoinduced fullerene species exhibit low extinction coefficients relative to polymer excitons/polarons. In contrast, the neat polymer film exhibited a broad positive signal (Fig. 2a) assigned to photoinduced absorption of singlet excitons, which was observed to decay mono-exponentially with a 15 ps time constant (Fig. 2b). This polymer singlet exciton absorption increases monotonically between 1000 and 1400 nm, and can be readily distinguished from that of BTT-DPP positive polarons which exhibit an absorption maximum at 1200 nm.19
The blend film showed a more complex TA spectral evolution, as shown in Fig. 2a. For both 470 and 800 nm excitation, the initial (0.25 ps) photoinduced absorption spectrum resembles that of the neat polymer and is therefore assigned to polymer excitons (note that BTT-DPP also absorbs weakly at 470 nm). At later times (6.2 ns) the transient spectra take the shape of BTT-DPP polarons and this is therefore assigned to charge-separated polarons. However, the relative magnitudes of these signals and their temporal evolution depend strongly upon the excitation wavelength (Fig. 2a and b) and polymer molecular weight (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 2b displays representative transients for the neat BTT-DPP-90 film and blend recorded at 1200 nm for a 470 nm (fullerene) and 800 nm (polymer) excitation. It is apparent that, following the 800 nm excitation, the transient kinetics are dominated by the circa 15 ps decay also observed for neat BTT-DPP assigned to polymer singlet exciton decay to ground state, with only a relatively small residual long-lived signal deriving from BTT-DPP polarons. This is consistent with our previous observations of relatively inefficient charge generation from BTT-DPP excitons.13,19 In contrast, excitation at 470 nm results in a pronounced, relatively slow (∼0.5 ns) rise in BTT-DPP polaron signal, indicative of BTT-DPP polaron formation from fullerene singlet excitons.23 The large amplitude of this absorption rise (see also Fig. 2a) is consistent with our device EQE spectra (Fig. 1b) indicating relatively efficient charge generation from PC70BM excitons, and in agreement with our previous, microsecond timescale, transient studies.13 The slow timescale of this rather efficient charge separation (∼0.5 ns) is in marked contrast to the ultrafast (sub-picosecond) charge separation typically observed from most polymer excitons,24,25 although examples of slow charge separation from polymer excitons has also been previously observed.26 It is striking that charge separation from PC70BM excitons is so slow, due to diffusion limitations (∼0.5 ns), but still relatively efficient.
We now focus on comparing the charge photogeneration properties of the PC70BM excitons in the three different molecular weight (Mn) BTT-DPP/PC70BM blends. It is apparent from the absorption rises shown in Fig. 2c that PC70BM excitons generate polarons faster and more efficiently in blends with higher molecular weight BTT-DPP. This enhancement of charge photogeneration follows the same trend as the JSC in Fig. 1a, and is in line with our observation that PC70BM excitons are the main contributors to device photocurrents. We note that the only difference between these devices is the molecular weight of the polymer and therefore the most likely cause of this improvement of charge photogeneration is optimisation of the morphology of the films. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out TEM and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of blend films. TEM micrographs (Fig. 3) clearly show a coarser domain structure (>5 nm domains) and higher crystallinity for the BTT-DPP-22/PC70BM film relative to BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM. Similarly, WAXS measurements (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) indicate that the crystallinity in these blends increases in the order 90 < 73 < 22. It is thus apparent that fractionation of BTT-DPP has a significant impact on the morphology of the active layer, decreasing film crystallinity and domain size with increasing polymer Mn.

(c) Diagram depicting the exciton diffusion process within fullerene aggregates with different diameters. We note that this diagram does not represent realistic film morphology of the studied films, in which the presence of mixed polymer–fullerene phases is likely. 
Previous studies have reported fullerene singlet exciton diffusion lengths of 5 nm, of similar order of magnitude to the domain sizes apparent in our TEM images.27 In order to investigate this further, we used steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting to estimate the fullerene singlet excitons and lifetimes in the blends studied herein. The results of these measurements are included in Table 1. They reveal that indeed fullerene singlet excitons are quenched more efficiently and their lifetime is shorter in the more amorphous BTT-DPP/PC70BM films. We observe a relatively good match between the PL lifetimes and the corresponding charge photogeneration time constants determined from the TA data. Our observed correlation between PL, TEM and TA spectroscopy provides strong evidence that charge photogeneration from fullerene excitons is primarily diffusion limited due to fullerene aggregation on the length scale of the fullerene singlet exciton diffusion length.
The ability of PC70BM singlet excitons to drive reasonably efficient charge separation on relatively long (0.5 ns) timescales can be understood from its relatively long singlet exciton lifetime. The PL decay of neat PC70BM was observed to be 0.65 ns,28 indicative of the relatively slow decay of the fullerene singlet excitons compared to many donor polymer excitons (c.f.: 15 ps for the BTT-DPP singlet excitons observed herein).23,29–31 The efficiency of fullerene exciton dissociation can be estimated from the steady state PL data to range from ∼50% for the BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM blend to 30% for BTT-DPP-22/PC70BM, suggesting that for all the films studied, fullerene exciton decay prior to charge separation remains a significant loss pathway. We note that similar PCBM exciton quenching has been observed for other donor polymers,8,17,23 suggesting that our conclusion of significant losses associated with fullerene exciton diffusion limitations may be an important loss factor for many polymer–fullerene solar cells.
Optical excitation of neat fullerene films has been reported to result in direct generation of separated charges, albeit with modest quantum efficiencies.32–34 Whilst the data reported herein can not rule out low yields of charge generation within PCBM domains, our observation of similar kinetics for both PCBM exciton decay and polymer polaron generation, and similar dependencies upon domain size, indicate that the primary charge generation mechanism in the system studied herein is exciton diffusion to, and charge separation at, the PCBM–polymer interface.
We turn now to consideration of charge collection in these devices, and particularly our observation of very high FFs and invariable VOC. To address this, we recorded the JSCversus light intensity response of a representative BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM device from 0 to 4 suns (device FF and VOC did not vary significantly between blends, suggesting that device energetics and charge transport properties were invariant with polymer Mn). The result presented in the ESI, Fig. S4† reveals a remarkably linear response of JSC with light intensity (JSC proportional to I0.97) even at 4 suns, indicative of highly efficient charge collection and relatively low non-linear recombination losses at short-circuit in these devices. Furthermore, we used charge extraction and transient photovoltage/photocurrent techniques to quantify charge densities and charge lifetimes in the active layer as a function of voltage and light bias.35 Typical photocurrent and photovoltage transients are shown in Fig. 4a, showing decay times of 1 × 10−7 and 5.1 × 10−6 s respectively, with the substantially faster decay time at short circuit being consistent with efficient charge collection. Such transients were employed in the successful reconstruction of the experimental device J/V curves (Fig. 4b) and photovoltages (Fig. S5 in the ESI†) in the fourth quadrant for a wide range of illuminations, employing as previously a model that assumes that non-geminate recombination of charges is the only voltage dependent photocurrent loss pathway in the device.36 The observed excellent match of recreated and experimentally observed J/Vs, apparent in Fig. 4b, confirms that non-geminate recombination governs the BTT-DPP/PC70BM device FF and VOC. The non-geminate recombination flux (Fig. 4a, insert) only becomes significant (>1 mA cm−2) for voltages greater than 0.57 V, approaching VOC and consistent with the high device FFs.

(b) Reconstruction of the current density of BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM device in the fourth quadrant in the dark and different light levels ranging from 0.5 to 2 suns.19 Symbols are experimental data and full lines are reconstructed data. 
The efficient charge collection observed for the devices studied herein, and resultant high device fill factors, can be understood in terms of the kinetics of charge extraction relative to non-geminate recombination. Using charge extraction at short circuit, we estimated that indeed the effective transverse carrier mobility in the BTT-DPP-90/PC70BM device is ∼2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to P3HT.37 Despite these relatively high charge carrier mobilities, the charge carrier lifetimes are reasonably long, being ∼4 × 10−6 s for charge densities of 2 × 1016 cm−3 at open-circuit condition, again comparable to P3HT devices, and indicative of a film micro- or interface structure which reduces recombination losses and thereby favors efficient charge collection.38
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the design and characterization of BTT-DPP/PC70BM photovoltaic devices in which the fullerene excitons alone generate impressive >7.3 mA cm−2 photocurrents. The low bandgap polymer BTT-DPP was synthesised and fractionated into three different molecular weights to optimise the morphology of the films for more efficient charge photogeneration from PC70BM excitons. As a result of this, device JSC increased with polymer molecular weight. The most efficient device prepared with the highest molecular weight polymer showed an impressive FF of 0.72 and PCE of 5.2%. The high FF results from slow non-geminate recombination losses relative to charge extraction, indicative of a favourable film microstructure for efficient charge collection. Using PL and femtosecond TA spectroscopy, we find that charge generation from PC70BM excitons occurs primarily on the ∼0.5 ns timescale. The higher efficiency, relatively slower, charge generation from fullerene excitons compared to that from BTT-DPP excitons is enabled by the slower intrinsic decay time of fullerene singlet excitons (0.65 ns compared to 15 ps for BTT-DPP excitons), as well as by the more favourable energetics for hole rather than electron transfer. The efficiency of PC70BM exciton driven charge separation is observed to be dependent upon polymer molecular weight, assigned to variations in the PC70BM domain size on the length scale of the PC70BM singlet exciton diffusion length. Our results demonstrate that efficient photocurrent generation in polymer–fullerene OSCs can be achieved even with relatively slow exciton-diffusion-limited charge separation kinetics. They also emphasize that light absorption by fullerenes can result in high photocurrents, with the efficiency of this process being dependent in particular upon the efficiency of fullerene exciton diffusion to the charge separation interface, and therefore dependent upon fullerene domain size.
Experimental
Device preparation
Optimized devices were fabricated with the fractionated BTT-DPP polymers co-dissolved with PC70BM (Solenne BV) in a chloroform–o-dichlorobenzene (4:1) mixed solvent with a weight ratio of 1:2 and a 25 mg ml−1 concentration. ITO substrates with sheet resistance 15 Ω sq−1 (PsioTec Ltd, UK) were sonicated in detergent, acetone and isopropanol sequentially and then treated in an oxygen plasma asher (100 W, 7 min). PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated over the ITO substrates at 3500 rpm and baked on a hot plate at 150 °C in air for 20 min. The BTT-DPP/PC70BM solutions were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at the optimum for this blend 3000 rpm in air and transferred to a nitrogen glove box (<10 ppm O2, H2O), where Ca/Al (25 nm/100 nm) electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum. Device area was 0.045 cm2.
Device and film characterisation

J/V curves were measured with a 150 W xenon arc lamp filtered to simulate AM1.5 conditions (LOT Oriel) and a Keithley 238 source measure unit. EQE spectra were measured using a 100 W Tungsten–Halogen lamp. The photocurrent was measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A calibrated silicon photodiode with appropriate long pass filters was used as a reference in the J/V and EQE measurements.
PL spectra were measured with a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 470 nm monochromatic excitation. PL dynamics were recorded using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting, employing a Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH Fluorocube system. Excitation was 467 nm, 1 MHz repetition rate and 80 μW cm−2. Decays were recorded at 700 nm, the maximum PC70BM PL.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
Thin films of BTT-DPP-22/PB70BM, BTT-DPP-73/PB70BM and BTT-DPP-90/PB70BM blends were prepared on a glass substrate following the same procedure used during device fabrication. Samples were excited with 470 nm and 800 nm, ∼7.5 μJ cm−2 pulses, generated by a commercially available optical parametric amplifier TOPAS (Light conversion) pumped by a Solstice Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (Newport Ltd). Changes in the optical density of the films induced by the laser excitation were followed with a second broadband pulse (830–1450 nm) generated in a sapphire crystal. HELIOS (Ultrafast systems) transient absorption spectrometer was used for recording the dynamics of the transient absorption spectra up to 6.5 ns with an average 200 fs instrument response function.
Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
Samples for WAXS measurements were prepared in a drop-casting manner with the solutions used for device fabrication. The measurements were carried out with a Panalytical X'Pert-Pro MRD which has a nickel-filter Cu Kα1 beam and an X'Celerator detector, using a current of 40 mA and an accelerating voltage of 40 kV.
Transmission electron microscopy
For TEM examination, BTT-DPP solutions were spun onto PEDOT:PSS-coated (10 nm) glass substrates, retrieved on holey carbon films. The sample film thickness was ∼30 nm. The samples were then stained by RuO4 vapour to increase the contrast of fullerene and polymer domains and measured with Titan 80/300 transmission electron microscope.

Broader context
The sun is our most sustainable energy source and can be effectively used for an off-grid and on-grid power supply. However, current solar cell technologies still do not provide low cost power to be able to compete with fossil fuels. A particularly popular approach to reducing the cost of solar cells, gaining a high momentum in the past 10 years, is the use of organic materials as the photoactive component. Such organic solar cells can be fabricated to be light-weight, thin and flexible, thus making them ideal for off-grid applications and building integration. Polymer–fullerene solar cells are a type of organic solar cells that are now reaching 10% power conversion efficiency. In these solar cells, polymers and fullerenes absorb sunlight and generate photocurrent, but the way they do that and what limits their photocurrent generation properties is still currently widely debated and as a result difficult to control. In this paper, we explore the limitations of photocurrent generation from fullerene excitons. We apply time-resolved laser spectroscopy and opto-electronic experimental techniques to show that fullerene aggregation is the main cause for reduced photocurrent generation from fullerene excitons. We show that by careful control over polymer molecular weight, the photocurrent from fullerene excitons can be optimised to give solar cell devices reaching 5% efficiency.
