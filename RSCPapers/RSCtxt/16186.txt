    , Accepted 20th April 2018First published on 20th April 2018AbstractThe physical properties of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are greatly influenced by their composition, crystallinity, and morphology. Here, we investigate the growth of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx perovskite from micro-droplets of a methylammonium iodide/lead acetate/dimethylformamide precursor solution added with different concentrations of PbBr2, which helps to control the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film. We find that both perovskite and its intermediate containing an acetate group growing from the micro-droplets. By adding some PbBr2, there is a tendency to form cubic perovskite crystals due to partial substitution of iodine with bromide. There is composition segregation when the crystals grow freely from the droplets. Smooth and uniform CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx perovskite films with a tunable band gap are thus fabricated from the precursor solution added with PbBr2.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted great attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and promising applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronic devices.1–5 For photovoltaic applications, uniform perovskite films with large columnar grains, good crystallization, and suitable bandgaps are essential for high performance. Great efforts have been made on fabricating such high quality perovskite films through optimizing fabrication parameters and compositional engineering.6–8 With these efforts, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have increased significantly from 3.8% to above 22%.9–12 Liu et al. prepared large single-crystalline perovskite crystals directly from organic solutions for various applications.13–16 It is a pity that these perovskite crystals are too thick to be fabricated as highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Their work offers a model to study the growth mechanism of perovskite crystals from some organic solutions. However, it is still a great challenge to prepare ideal films for higher photovoltaic performance.
Generally, perovskite films are prepared from a halide lead (such as PbI2) precursor solution through spin coating. It tends to form needle-like perovskite intermediates containing some solvent molecules from the PbI2 precursor solution. Some other non-halide lead precursors, such as lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2),17 lead nitrate,18 and lead thiocyanate,19 were also used to fabricate perovskite films. Moore et al. found that lead acetate has wider processing windows than PbI2.20 It was reported that the bandgap and morphology of a perovskite can be modulated through chemical doping or elemental replacing.21,22 The bandgap of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (MAPbI3−xBrx) varies from 1.5 to 2.3 eV depending on the concentration of bromine. This shows a possibility of constructing highly efficient tandem solar cells from all perovskites by adjusting the concentration of iodine and bromine. In addition, the stability of the perovskite solar cells using MAPbI3−xBrx as a light absorber was improved evidently under humid conditions.23 CH3NH3Br (MABr) was also used as an additive in a lead acetate-based precursor solution. With the assistance of MABr, the uniformity and crystallinity of the perovskite films were improved significantly, resulting in high-performance devices.24 Generally, the MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite films were fabricated by a one-step spin-coating method,23–28 two-step spin-coating method,29 and sequential deposition process.21 In these reports, the perovskite films were prepared by dropping the precursor solutions onto the substrate, followed by spin coating. It is difficult to observe the growth process due to the high spinning rate.
Here, we investigate the crystallization of MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite from an acetate precursor solution by a micro-droplet method. Due to the tiny volume of the micro-droplet, it is facile to simulate the growth of perovskite crystals by spin coating, which helps to fully understand the growth mechanism of perovskite with mixed halides. Actually, micro-droplets have a wide range of applications,30–34 including fabrication of perovskite solar cells by a spray-coating method.35 We find that the acetate group and bromide play important roles in controlling the morphology of the perovskite.
Experimental
Pb(Ac)2·3H2O, PbBr2, and CH3NH3I (MAI) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a solution with a Pb2+ concentration of 1 mol L−1 and a MAI concentration of 3 mol L−1. The perovskite precursor solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. FTO glass was cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in sequence, followed by drying with nitrogen gas. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the FTO glass by spin coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol at 2000 rpm for 30 s. After drying at 100 °C for 30 min, the TiO2/FTO substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. For investigating the growth process of perovskite, the precursor solution was jetted to the TiO2/FTO substrate, which formed micro-droplets with volumes of several nano-litres. For fabricating perovskite films, the precursor solution was deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by setting at room temperature for 5 min and then annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.
The morphology of the perovskite crystals was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN VP Compact) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100F). The perovskite films were characterized by SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab), and UV absorption spectroscopy (Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies). The TEM samples were prepared by dropping a few drops of the precursor solution onto copper grids coated with holey carbon films.
Results and discussion
MAI/Pb(Ac)2/DMF precursor solutions containing various ratios of PbBr2 to Pb(Ac)2 are jetted onto the TiO2/FTO substrate at room temperature according to our previous method,36 which form micro-droplets with volumes on the nano-litre scale (Fig. 1a). Due to its good wettability, the micro-droplet disperses to form a thin pool on the TiO2/FTO substrate. The thickness of the pool at the edge is thinner than that at the centre. As the DMF solvent evaporates, some perovskite crystals first nucleate and grow at the edge of the micro-droplet due to supersaturation. More and more crystals grow from the droplet until the solution dries up. The growth of the perovskite finishes within several to tens of seconds according to the volume of the droplet and the conditions. The growth rate of the crystals is slower than that from spin coating. Therefore, one can investigate the growth of perovskite crystals through a micro-droplet method.

We first investigate the growth of perovskite crystals from the MAI/Pb(Ac)2/DMF solution without the addition of PbBr2. Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the perovskite and its intermediate prepared from a micro-droplet of the DMF precursor solution only containing CH3NH3I (MAI) and Pb(Ac)2 (molar ratio of 3:1). It is clearly seen from Fig. 1b that there are two different kinds of crystals: polygonal grains and needle-like crystals, which are similar to the perovskite and its intermediate crystals growing from the MAI/PbI2/DMF solution.36 The solubility of the organic component (MAI) in the DMF solution is higher than that of the inorganic component (PbI2). As DMF evaporates, the perovskite crystals first grow directly from the edge of the droplet, resulting in the formation of polygonal grains. As the perovskite grains grow, they consume an equimolar amount of MAI and PbI2, resulting in the unsaturation of MAI in the droplet. Thus, the PbI2-based intermediate precipitates from the solution due to the supersaturation of PbI2, leading to the growth of needle-like crystals. The PbI2-based intermediate converts to the perovskite intermediate by reacting with MAI and the acetate group. Here, the perovskite intermediate mainly contains the acetate group, rather than the DMF molecule.
As shown in Fig. 1c, the large polygonal grains still consist of many small perovskite crystals, which have a smooth, uniform and compact morphology. Some small grains are also observed on the surface of the polygonal crystals, which might come from the new nuclei of perovskite from the residual solution as DMF evaporates. These polygonal grains have a similar morphology to the perovskite films prepared from the Pb(Ac)2 precursor solution by spin coating.17

Fig. 2 shows the XRD curves of the samples prepared from solution added with different ratios of PbBr2. For the sample without the addition of PbBr2 (dark curves), there are two evident XRD peaks located at 14.10° and 28.34°, corresponding to the (110) and (220) planes of the MAPbI3 perovskite, respectively. These two XRD peaks do not shift after annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. These two prominent XRD peaks have shoulder peaks located at 13.86° and 27.74°, which disappear after annealing. It can be deduced that these two shoulder peaks are derived from the perovskite intermediate. It is noted that no XRD peaks below 10° are detected, which is quite different from that of the product prepared from the MAI/PbI2/DMF solution.36 For the perovskite intermediate containing the DMF molecule, there are usually several XRD peaks at low angles (<10°) due to lattice expansion. Therefore, the needle-like crystals are the perovskite intermediate containing the acetate group, rather than the DMF molecule. There are many small holes on the needle-like crystals (see Fig. 1d), which are derived from the escape of the acetate group. CH3NH3Ac is a volatile material, which will escape from the precursor solution as DMF evaporates.37

We then investigate the growth of the perovskite from the Pb(Ac)2 precursor added with some PbBr2. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the perovskites and their intermediates prepared from the micro-droplets of MAI/Pb(Ac)2/DMF solutions added with different molar ratios of PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2. At a low concentration of PbBr2 (PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2 = 1/8), the morphology of the crystals are similar to those without PbBr2 (Fig. 1), which consist of some polygonal perovskites and some needle-like intermediates (see Fig. 3a–c). However, the needle-like crystals still consist of many perovskite grains, derived from the partial conversion of the intermediate to perovskite. The XRD curves (red curves in Fig. 2) before and after annealing are similar to those without the addition of PbBr2. However, the intensities of the XRD shoulder peaks at 13.86° and 27.74° decrease slightly when compared with those without the addition of PbBr2, which indicates that more perovskite crystals grow from the solution.

Top: PbBr2:Pb(Ac)2 = 1:8, middle: PbBr2:Pb(Ac)2 = 1:6, and bottom: PbBr2:Pb(Ac)2 = 1:4; left: (a), (d) and (g) are low magnification SEM images; middle: (b), (e) and (h) are SEM images of the polygonal and cubic perovskite crystals; right: (c), (f) and (i) are high magnification SEM images. 
Besides the polygonal perovskite grains and needle-like intermediate crystals (see Fig. 3d), some cubic crystals (see Fig. 3e) are observed in the samples prepared from the solution with a high PbBr2 concentration (PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2 = 1/6). Furthermore, some needle-like crystals grow radially from the solution (see Fig. 3d and e). At the edge of the droplets, the perovskite directly precipitates and forms a smooth perovskite film (see Fig. 3f), which consists of many small perovskite crystals.
We measure the elemental concentration of iodine and bromine in the crystals with different morphologies by Auger spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Both iodine and bromine are detected in the needle-like and cubic crystals. The perovskite crystals can be ascribed to the partial substitution of iodine with bromine in MAPbI3−xBrx. However, the atomic ratio of Br/I in the needle-like crystal is about 1:10.9, which is lower than that in the cubic crystals (1:6.3). There is evident composition segregation during the growth of perovskite from the precursor solution. The Br-rich phase perovskite tends to grow directly from the precursor solution, while I-rich crystals tend to form needle-like perovskite intermediate crystals. Br has a smaller ionic size and lower solubility in organic solvents than I due to its stronger bond strength.22 In addition, the Lewis acidity of PbBr2 is weaker than that of PbI2,38 which means that PbBr2 does not tend to coordinate with DMF. Both the Br-rich perovskite and I-rich intermediate precipitate from the precursor solution, which causes the morphology evolution as mentioned above.

Fig. 5a shows the TEM image of the perovskite crystals grown from the precursor solution with PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2 = 1/6, which shows the initial stage of the perovskite nucleation. On the copper grid, DMF evaporates very fast due to the large surface area. It shows that the perovskite crystals nucleate directly from the solution, rather than through the intermediate. From the high resolution TEM image in Fig. 5b, the nuclei distribute randomly, which implies that they nucleate independently.

We further increase the molar ratio of PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2 to 1:4. With a higher Br concentration, more cubic perovskite crystals are observed in the sample (see Fig. 3g–i). This re-confirms that the cubic perovskite crystals tend to grow from the Br-rich solution. There are no needle-like crystals in the sample any more. The cubic perovskite crystals have a large size of tens of microns, which is larger than the crystals from the pure Pb(Ac)2 solution. The (110) and (220) XRD peaks (blue curves) shift to 14.26° and 28.45°, respectively. Furthermore, no shoulder peaks are detected in the XRD curves. This implies that there is no perovskite intermediate in the sample at high bromine concentration, which is consistent with the SEM characterization.
Based on the above results, we prepare MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite films by spin coating MAI/Pb(Ac)2/DMF precursor solutions added with different concentrations of PbBr2. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films. The films mainly consist of perovskite grains. For the film without the addition of PbBr2, there are some extra perovskite crystals, especially at the grain boundary of the perovskites (Fig. 6a). These extra crystals lead to a rough surface. When some PbBr2 is added to the precursor solution, the extra crystals at the grain boundary disappear (Fig. 6b–d), resulting in smooth perovskite films. The perovskite grain size also increases with the PbBr2 concentration. Some large grains with a size up to 1 μm are frequently observed in the film prepared from the solution with a high PbBr2 ratio of 1:4 (Fig. 6d). It is clear that the crystallinity of the perovskite is influenced by the concentration of PbBr2 evidently.

It is further confirmed by the AFM images (Fig. 7) that the grain size increases when more PbBr2 is added into the Pb(Ac)2/DMF solution. Furthermore, the perovskite films become smooth when some PbBr2 is added into the solution. The roughness of the perovskite film is reduced from 17 nm to 9 nm when the molar ratio of PbBr2 to Pb(Ac)2 increases from 0 to 1:6, respectively. However, the roughness increases to 20 nm when the molar ratio increases to 1:4, which might result from the existence of large grains in the films.

Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films prepared from solutions with various PbBr2 concentrations. There are evident absorption peaks at 740–780 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgap of the Br-doped perovskites. The onset absorption edge shifts towards the lower wavelength as more PbBr2 is added into the precursor solution (inset of Fig. 8). The optical bandgap of the Br-doped perovskite films prepared from the solution added with different ratios of PbBr2/Pb(Ac)2 (0, 1:8, 1:6, and 1:4) is 1.55, 1.59, 1.59, and 1.61 eV, respectively. High quality perovskite films with a suitable and tunable band gap are thus fabricated from the lead acetate precursor by adding some PbBr2 into the solution.

Conclusions
Crystallization of MAPbI3−xBrx perovskites from a lead acetate precursor by a facile micro-droplet method is investigated. Typically, perovskite crystals and needle-like perovskite intermediates containing an acetate group grow directly from the MAI/Pb(Ac)2/DMF precursor solution. The perovskite intermediate tends to convert to perovskite crystals due to the volatile material CH3NH3Ac. When some lead bromide is added, there is a tendency to form cubic perovskite crystals through partial substitution of iodine with bromine. High quality MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite films with a smooth, uniform morphology and tunable bandgap are fabricated.
