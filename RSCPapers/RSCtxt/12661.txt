    , Accepted 22nd November 2016First published on 9th March 2017AbstractNew supramolecular photocatalysts comprising an asymmetric bis-tridentate Ru(II) complex that functions as a photosensitizer and a Ru(II) carbonyl complex as the catalyst were designed. The complexes photocatalyzed the reduction of CO2 to CO or formic acid with high selectivity. The product distribution depended on the catalyst unit. CO and formic acid were the main products when using [Ru(BL)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ (BL = bridging ligand, Clbpy = 4,4′-dichloro-2,2′-bipyridine) and Ru(BL)(CO)2Cl2 catalysts, respectively.
Introduction
Reductive conversion of CO2 into energy-rich compounds using solar light as an energy source has been intensively investigated in recent years as one of the most promising solutions to global warming and shortage of fossil resources.1 In particular, photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems using supramolecular metal complexes whose redox photosensitizer and catalyst units are connected with a bridging ligand with two 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) moieties have been developed.2–11 Although these photocatalytic systems exhibit high efficiency, durability, rate, and selectivity for the reduction of CO2, a sacrificial electron donor is needed because of the weak oxidation power of the photosensitizer units. Recently, hybrid photocatalytic systems where supramolecular photocatalysts are connected to semiconductor photocatalysts12–15 or semiconducting photoanodes16–18 with high oxidation power were developed. These systems were shown to reduce CO2 to formic acid or CO via Z-scheme-type electron transfer using weak reductants such as methanol12 and water.18 These hybrid systems use a limited number of supramolecular photocatalysts, which can deliver high-performance CO2 reduction using strong electron donors in homogeneous solutions (Chart 1a and b), however, their molecular designs are not yet optimized for hybridization with heterogeneous materials. Therefore, two problems remain: (1) the detachment of the supramolecular photocatalysts from the semiconductors and (2) rapid backward electron transfer from the reduced supramolecular photocatalysts to the semiconductors. Since the photosensitizer unit of the reported supramolecular photocatalysts is a trisdiimine-type complex, i.e., [Ru(N⁁N)3]2+ (N⁁N = diimine ligand), the additional electron in the one-electron-reduced state of the photosensitizer unit may migrate among the three diimine ligands, providing a considerable chance for backward electron injection into the semiconductor (BET1 in Chart 1a and b). There are two structures in the reported supramolecular photocatalysts and each has a different position between the anchors and the catalyst unit, i.e., trans-position (Chart 1a) and cis-position (Chart 1b). In the case of the cis-position, backward electron transfer from the one-electron-reduced catalyst unit to the semiconductor (BET2 in Chart 1b) might be faster because it can be closely localized to the semiconductor surface. Selective synthesis of only the trans-type complexes or isolation from a mixture of both isomers is difficult.
 Chart 1  Conceptual images of a hybrid photocatalytic system constructed with (a, b) bidentate diimine ligands and (c, d) tridentate ligands. Blue arrows indicate the backward electron transfer process. 
To solve the aforementioned problems, we designed a new type of supramolecular photocatalysts where a Ru(II) photosensitizer with two different tridentate ligands, [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+ (mbip = bis(N-methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine; tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine), and a catalyst unit are connected through a bridging ligand (Chart 1c). Although Ru complexes with two tridentate ligands are potentially effective photosensitizer units, many of them cannot be used as photosensitizers because of the very short lifetime of their excited states, typically [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (τem = 0.25 ns). The asymmetrical bis-tridentate Ru(II) complex [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+ was originally reported by Haga and coworkers.19–23 They investigated the properties of this series of complexes in solution19 and on an electrode surface.20–23 [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+ weakly emits from its triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited state with a longer lifetime (τem = 30 ns) compared with the symmetric bis-tridentate complex [Ru(tpy)2]2+.19 Four anchors, such as phosphonate groups, can be introduced into the mbip peripheral ligand (Chart 1d), which strongly attach to the surface of the metal oxide.20,22,23 In the 3MLCT excited state of this complex, the transferred electron was mainly localized on the tpy ligand rather than the mbip ligand. This localization might accelerate electron transfer to the catalyst connected to the tpy ligand. In the hybrid system, the electronic and structural anisotropies of the photosensitizer unit (Chart 1d) might suppress backward electron transfer from the reduced supramolecular photocatalyst to the semiconductor.
Two Ru(II) carbonyl complexes, i.e., [Ru(tpy)(N⁁N)(CO)]2+24,25 and Ru(N⁁N)(CO)2Cl2,26–29 were employed as a catalyst unit because they have been reported to function as electrochemical catalysts for CO2 reduction and to potentially accept an electron from a one-electron-reduced [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+-type photosensitizer unit, as described below. Structures and abbreviations of synthesized supramolecular complexes are shown in Chart 2. In this study, we report the synthesis of Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 and Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) and their photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction.

Results and discussion
We have previously reported the molecular architecture of supramolecular photocatalysts that show efficient CO2 reduction, i.e., the introduction of a non-conjugated bond between the photosensitizer and catalyst units to maintain enough reduction power for the catalyst unit to achieve CO2 reduction.4 Based on this architecture, new bridging ligands connecting a tpy moiety with another tpy moiety or a bpy moiety were designed for constructing photocatalysts with a [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+-type photosensitizer unit. A bridging ligand that connects two tpy moieties with an ethylene chain (tpyC2tpy) was synthesized to connect a [Ru(tpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ (Clbpy = 4,4′-dichloro-2,2′-bipyridine) catalyst unit with the photosensitizer unit (Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO)). On the other hand, the bpy moiety of a Ru(N⁁N)(CO)2Cl2 catalyst unit and the tpy moiety of the photosensitizer unit were connected with an –OCH2– chain (tpyOCbpy) in the case of Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2. For both supramolecular photocatalysts, the reduction power of the catalyst units is expected to be maintained because of the ethylene or methylene chain in the bridging ligand. Synthetic procedures used for the supramolecular complexes are shown in Scheme 1. For Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) synthesis, tpyC2tpy reacted with (mbip)RuCl3 to produce [(mbip)Ru(tpyC2tpy)]2+, followed by reaction with [Ru(CO)2Cl2]n, CF3SO3H, and Clbpy. In the case of Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2, the photosensitizer unit with a free bpy moiety, i.e., [(mbip)Ru(tpyOCbpy)]2+, was first obtained by the Williamson ether synthesis using [(mbip)Ru(tpyOH)]2+ (tpyOH = [2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridin]-4′-ol) and 4-(bromomethyl)-4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine. The complexes were identified using 1H NMR, ESI-high-resolution MS, and FT-IR spectroscopies.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis schemes of supramolecular photocatalysts. 
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) in a N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) solution is shown in Fig. 1a along with those of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ (mtpy = 4′-methyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) and [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ as models of the photosensitizer and catalyst units. Comparison with the model complexes clearly indicates that the Ru(II) photosensitizer unit of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) exhibits a 1MLCT absorption band at 450–550 nm and π–π* absorption bands of the mbip ligand and the tpy moiety at 340–355 nm and 310–320 nm, respectively. The absorption in the visible region was red-shifted compared to that of the frequently used [Ru(N⁁N)3]2+-type photosensitizer unit4 of supramolecular photocatalysts. This is because of the wider conjugation in the tridentate ligands of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO). Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 showed a similar absorption spectrum in the visible region (Fig. 1b). Since the model complexes of the catalyst units, i.e., [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ and Ru(dmb)(CO)2Cl2 (dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine), scarcely absorbed visible light at λ > 450 nm, selective excitation of the photosensitizer units can be achieved by irradiation with λex > 450 nm.

The photophysical properties of the synthesized complexes and [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ are summarized in Table 1. Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO), Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2, and [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ emitted at room temperature in DMA solutions. The emission spectra showed a broad band without a vibrational structure at λem ∼ 700 nm (Fig. 2) and the emission lifetimes were approximately 20 ns, which is a typical characteristic of the emission from the 3MLCT excited state. Note that the emission properties of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) and Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 are similar to those of the mononuclear model complex [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+.

The photocatalytic properties are summarized in Table 2. In a typical run of photocatalytic reactions, a DMA–H2O (9:1 v/v) solution containing Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (50 μM) and 1,3-dimethyl-2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BI(OH)H, 0.1 M) as a sacrificial electron donor7 was irradiated (λex > 500 nm) under a CO2 atmosphere for 20 h, affording CO (the turnover number for CO production (TONCO) was 134) as the main product with small amounts of formic acid (TONHCOOH = 11) and H2 (TONH2 < 1) (Fig. 3a). The quantum yield for CO formation was ΦCO = 2.1%. This photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction was higher than that using a mixed system of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ and [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ (TONCO = 118, TONHCOOH = 5, TONH2 = 1 after 20 h irradiation). On the other hand, using Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 instead of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) resulted mainly in the formation of formic acid (TONHCOOH = 181) along with CO (TONCO = 10) and H2 (TONH2 = 4) as minor products (Fig. 3b). The quantum yield for formic acid production was determined as ΦHCOOH = 11%. The photocatalytic activity results for CO2 reduction using a corresponding mixed system of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ and Ru(dmb)(CO)2Cl2 produced lower TONHCOOH = 115, TONCO = 13, TONH2 = 3 compared with those using Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2. The irradiation of a solution containing BI(OH)H and [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+, instead of the supramolecular photocatalysts, gave small amounts of products (TONCO = 10, TONHCOOH < 1, TONH2 < 1). The CO2 reduction products were not observed in the dark or in the absence of the sacrificial electron donor. In the supramolecular photocatalytic systems reported previously, triethanolamine (TEOA) was employed as a base to deprotonate the one-electron-oxidized electron donor,4,6 suppressing back electron transfer; however, in this system, photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a DMA solution containing 10% H2O instead of the DMA–TEOA mixture because the final target of this project is development of a hybrid photocatalytic system consisting of supramolecular and semiconductor photocatalysts that use H2O as an electron source. It is noteworthy that a high selectivity for the CO2 reduction products was achieved, even in the presence of H2O.

 Fig. 3  Photocatalytic formation of CO (), formic acid (), and H2 () as a function of irradiation time using (a) Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) and (b) Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2. CO2-saturated DMA–H2O (9:1 v/v, 2 mL) solutions containing the supramolecular complex (50 μM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) were irradiated at λex > 500 nm. 
To clarify the carbon source(s) of the CO and formic acid produced in the photocatalytic reactions, isotopic labeling experiments using 13CO2 were conducted. For CO as a main product, a DMA–D2O (9:1 v/v) solution containing Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (0.1 mM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) was irradiated under a 13CO2 (72.5 kPa) atmosphere at λex > 422 nm for 16 h. In the GC-MS analysis of the gas phase in the reaction vessel, a peak at m/z = 29 that is attributed to 13CO was observed, whereas a peak at m/z = 28 that is attributed to 12CO was nearly negligible (Fig. 4a). In the system where formic acid is the main product, a DMF-d7–H2O (9:1 v/v) solution of Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 (0.5 mM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) was irradiated under a 13CO2 atmosphere. In the 1H NMR spectrum obtained after irradiation, a doublet at 8.53 ppm (1J13C–H = 184 Hz) that is attributed to the methine proton of an equilibrium mixture of H13COO− and H13COOH was observed, although a singlet at 8.53 ppm that is attributed to the proton of the corresponding 12C products was scarcely observed (Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  (a) GC-MS analysis of the gas phase after irradiation: a DMA–D2O (9:1 v/v, 2 mL) solution containing 13CO2 (72.5 kPa), Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (0.1 mM), and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) was irradiated at λex > 422 nm for 16 h. (b) 1H NMR spectra of the reaction solution: a DMF-d7–H2O (9:1 v/v, 0.6 mL) solution of 13CO2 (72.5 kPa), Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 (0.5 mM), and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) was irradiated at λex > 422 nm for 16 h. 
These results clearly indicate that both CO and formic acid were produced by the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Therefore, we can conclude that the two new supramolecular photocatalysts with a [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+-type photosensitizer unit were successfully developed. They can reduce CO2 to CO and formic acid, respectively, with high selectivity, even in the presence of 10% H2O (eqn (1)). (1)
The reaction mechanisms of the photocatalytic reactions were also investigated. As described above, since both catalyst units do not absorb light in the photocatalytic reactions, only the [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+-type photosensitizer units transit from the ground state to the 1MLCT excited state by photon absorption. Rapid intersystem crossing proceeds, giving 3MLCT excited states of the photosensitizer units. In the presence of BI(OH)H, emission from the 3MLCT excited states is reductively quenched to afford the corresponding one-electron-reduced species (OERS) of the photosensitizer units (eqn (2)). The quenching rate constants were determined by Stern–Volmer analyses with the emission lifetimes as kq = 4.1 × 109 M−1 s−1 (Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO)) and 2.0 × 109 M−1 s−1 (Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2). The quenching fractions under the photocatalytic reaction condition, i.e., [BI(OH)H] = 0.1 M, are ηq = 87% (Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO)) and 81% (Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2). In the case of the photosensitizer model [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+, they were found to be kq = 2.1 × 109 M−1 s−1 and ηq = 80%, respectively. (2)
To explore the processes after the one-electron reduction of the photosensitizer units, UV-vis absorption spectra of the reaction solutions were analyzed during the photocatalytic reactions. In the case of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (Fig. 5a), the UV-vis differential absorption spectra clearly indicate that the change in absorption proceeded through two stages. Initially, a new absorption band increased at λmax = 520 nm during irradiation for 0–3 min (green arrow), after which two absorption bands appeared at λmax = 530 nm and 700 nm during irradiation for 3–18 min, with an absorption decrease at approximately 470 nm (red arrows). For identification of the accumulated species in the reaction solution during irradiation, electrospectroscopic measurements of the corresponding mononuclear model complexes, i.e., [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ and [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+, were conducted using a UV-vis OTTLE cell (Fig. 6). Electrolysis of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ at −1.78 V, attributed to its one-electron reduction, gave a new absorption band at λmax = 530 nm with an absorption decrease at approximately 480 nm (Fig. 6a). Since this new absorption band disappeared and the original absorption was recovered by reoxidation at 0 V, the species produced by electrochemical reduction should be the OERS of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+. In the case of [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+, on the other hand, a new absorption band appeared at λmax = 520 nm by electrochemical one-electron reduction; however, the original complex was not recovered by reoxidation at 0 V (Fig. 6b). For clarifying the new species produced after one-electron reduction of [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+, the solution was subjected to controlled potential electrolysis at −1.45 V for 15 min using a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) working electrode and subsequently analyzed by FT-IR and ESI-MS. The FT-IR spectra indicate that the electrolysis induced a decrease in the absorption band, attributed to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl ligand (Fig. S1†). The ESI-MS after electrolysis indicate a new peak at m/z = 307, attributed to the acetonitrile-coordinated species instead of the carbonyl ligand, i.e., [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(NCMe)]2+. Acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase in the ESI-MS measurement (Fig. S2†). These results strongly indicate that the one-electron reduction of [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ caused the ligand substitution of the carbonyl with a solvent molecule giving [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(solvent)]2+.
 Fig. 5  UV-vis differential absorption spectra between before and after irradiation of a DMA–H2O (9:1 v/v) solution containing BI(OH)H (0.1 M) and Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (a, 50 μM) or Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 (b, 50 μM) at λex = 480 nm for 0–18 min at 1 min intervals. The blue, green, and red lines represent the spectra before (blue) and after irradiation for 3 min (green) and 18 min (red). 
 Fig. 6  UV-vis differential spectra between before and after electrolysis (one-electron reduction) of (a) [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ and (b) [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+ (black lines). The complex (0.5 mM) dissolved in an Ar-saturated DMA solution containing Et4NBF4 (0.1 M) as an electrolyte was reduced at −1.78 V ([(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+) or −1.44 V ([Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)]2+) using a UV-vis OTTLE cell with a Pt-mesh working electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The red lines represent the spectra reoxidized at 0 V after the one-electron reduction. The green line in (b) shows the differential spectrum between after one-electron reduction (black line) and after reoxidation (red line). 
Based on these results, we can conclude that the absorption change of the reaction solution in the initial stage can be attributed to the formation of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(solvent) and accumulation of the OERS of the catalyst unit of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(solvent) and/or Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO). In the next stage, the OERS of [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]2+ also accumulates in the reaction solution.
The electrochemical properties of the complexes are summarized in Table 3. Since the first reduction potential of the catalyst unit (Ered1/2 = −1.32 V vs. Ag/AgNO3) was much more positive than that of the photosensitizer unit (Ered1/2 = −1.61 V), the intramolecular electron transfer from the OERS of the photosensitizer unit to the catalyst unit is an exergonic reaction and should be fast. This is likely the reason that the OERS of the catalyst unit accumulated in the reaction solution immediately after irradiation. Since the carbonyl ligand is a very strong electron acceptor, the substitution of the carbonyl ligand with a solvent molecule, i.e., DMA, H2O, or –OH induces a negative shift in the reduction potential of the catalyst unit. This might be a reason for the accumulation of the OERS of the photosensitizer unit after the one-electron reduction of the catalyst unit, whose ligand substitution may have partially proceeded.

Based on these results and investigations, the following mechanism for the photocatalytic reaction using Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) is proposed (Scheme 2). Photon absorption by the photosensitizer unit and the subsequent reductive quenching by BI(OH)H produce the OERS of the photosensitizer unit, followed by the exergonic intramolecular electron transfer to produce the OERS of the catalyst unit. In the reduced catalyst unit, the substitution of the CO ligand proceeds with a solvent molecule. The OERS of the solvento complex might capture CO2 and another electron injection gives CO. The solvento complex Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(solvent) may also work as a photocatalyst. The photochemical electron transfer process from BI(OH)H to the excited photosensitizer unit of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(solvent) may proceed in a similar manner to that of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) because the photosensitizer unit and the catalyst unit are connected via the non-conjugated ethylene chain.
 Scheme 2  Proposed reaction mechanism of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO). 

Fig. 5b shows the differential UV-vis absorption spectra of the photocatalytic reaction using Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 before and after irradiation. In contrast to the case of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO), the absorption spectrum scarcely changes during the photocatalytic reaction. This clearly indicates that the intramolecular electron transfer, and possibly the subsequent reduction process of CO2, rapidly proceeded during the whole of the photocatalytic reaction. This is probably one of the reasons the efficiency of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 was higher than that using Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO).
Conclusion
We established synthetic procedures for newly designed supramolecular photocatalysts with the [(mbip)Ru(tpy)]2+-type photosensitizer unit. The complexes photocatalyzed CO2 reduction with high selectivity, even in the presence of water. The main product of CO2 reduction can be controlled by changing the catalyst unit, i.e., CO with Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) or formic acid with Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2. Hybridization of these supramolecular photocatalysts with semiconductors is in progress in our laboratory.
Experiments
General procedures
Microwave irradiation for the synthesis of complexes was achieved using an EYELA microwave reactor, Wave Magic MWO-1000S, equipped with a pressure resistant vessel MWP-2000. 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL ECA400II (400 MHz) system to identify the synthesized compounds in solutions of chloroform-d or acetonitrile-d3. The residual protons of chloroform-d or acetonitrile-d3 were used as an internal standard for these measurements. Electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) was performed using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010A system with acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (ESI-TOFMS) was undertaken with a Waters LCT Premier, with acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a JASCO V-565 spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3-21 spectrofluorometer equipped with a NIR-PMT R5509-43 near infrared detector. Emission lifetimes were obtained using a Horiba FluoroCube time-correlated single-photon counting system. The excitation light source was a NanoLED-515L pulse lamp (510 nm). Emission quenching experiments were performed on Ar-saturated DMA–H2O (9:1 v/v) solutions containing the complexes and five different concentrations of BI(OH)H. Quenching rate constants kq were calculated from linear Stern–Volmer plots for the emission from the 3MLCT excited state of the photosensitizer units and their lifetimes. The redox potentials of the complexes were measured in an Ar-saturated DMA solution containing Et4NBF4 (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte by cyclic voltammetric techniques using an ALS/CHI CHI-720Dx electrochemical analyzer with a glassy carbon disk working electrode (3 mm diameter), a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode, and a Pt counter electrode. The supporting electrolyte was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 1 day prior to use. The scan rate was 200 mV s−1.
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were performed in a DMA–H2O (9:1 v/v) solution containing the complex (0.05 mM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M). After the solution was purged with CO2 for 20 min, the solution was irradiated. For TON measurements, a 2-mL solution in an 11-mL test tube (i.d. = 8 mm) was irradiated in a merry-go-round apparatus using >500-nm light from a high-pressure Hg lamp equipped with a uranyl glass and a K2CrO4 (30% w/w, light pass length: 1 cm) solution filter. During irradiation, the temperature of the solution was maintained at 25 °C using a constant-temperature system, EYELA CTP-1000. For quantum yield measurements, a 4-mL solution in a quartz cubic cell (11 mL, light pass length: 1 cm) was irradiated in a Shimadzu photoreaction quantum yield evaluation system QYM-01 using 480-nm light from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 480-nm (FWHM: 10 nm) bandpass filter. The temperature of the solution was controlled during irradiation at 25 °C using an IWAKI CTS-134A constant-temperature system. The gaseous products of the photocatalysis, i.e., CO and H2, were analyzed by GC-TCD (GL science GC323). Formic acid was analyzed using a capillary electrophoresis system (Otsuka Electromics Co. CAPI-3300I).
Labeling experiments using 13CO2
In the 13CO2 experiments, a DMA–D2O (9:1 v/v, 2 mL) solution containing Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) (0.1 mM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) and a DMF-d7–H2O (9:1 v/v, 0.6 mL) solution containing Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 (0.5 mM) and BI(OH)H (0.1 M) were prepared. The solutions were degassed using the freeze–pump–thaw method before 13CO2 (72.5 kPa) was introduced into the solutions and then were irradiated for 16 h using light at a wavelength >422 nm obtained using a 500 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter. In the case of the Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) system, the gas phase was analyzed using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra combined with an MS-5A column after irradiation. For analysis of the formic acid produced from the Ru–Ru(CO)2Cl2 system, 13C and 1H NMR spectra were measured before and after irradiation. The residual carbons and protons of DMF-d7 were used as an internal standard for these measurements.
Electrochemical spectroscopy
A UV-vis OTTLE cell (light pass length: 1.0 mm) equipped with a Pt-mesh working electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode, and a Pt counter electrode was employed for the UV-vis spectroelectrochemical experiments. UV-vis spectral changes were measured using a Photal MCPD-9800 spectrometer. The controlled potential electrolysis experiments were conducted in a DMA solution containing Et4NBF4 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte using an ALS/CHI CHI-720Dx electrochemical analyzer.
Controlled potential electrolysis
An RVC working electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode, and a Pt counter electrode were used for the controlled potential electrolysis. A DMA (1 mL) solution containing [Ru(mtpy)(Clbpy)(CO)](PF6)2 (1 mM) and NH4PF6 (0.1 M) was reduced at −1.45 V for 15 min and analyzed by FT-IR and ESI-MS.
