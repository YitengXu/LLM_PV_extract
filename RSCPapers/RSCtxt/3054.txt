    , Accepted 4th September 2020First published on 8th September 2020AbstractDye-functionalized polymers have been extensively studied to understand polymer chain dynamics, intra or inter-molecular association and conformational changes as well as in practical applications such as signal amplification in diagnostic tests and light-harvesting antennas. In this work, the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of dye-functionalized poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) was studied to evaluate the effect of dye positioning and polymer chain length on the FRET efficiency. Therefore, both α (initiating terminus)- or ω (terminal chain end)-fluorophore single labeled and dual α,ω-fluorescent dye labeled PEtOx were prepared via cationic ring opening polymerization (CROP) using 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene as the initiator and/or 1-pyrenebutyric acid or coumarin 343 as the terminating agent, yielding well-defined PEtOx with high labeling efficiency (over 91%). Fluorescence studies revealed that intramolecular FRET is most efficient for heterotelechelic PEtOx containing both pyrene and coumarin 343 fluorophores as chain ends, as expected. A strong dependence of the energy transfer on the chain length was found for these dual labeled polymers. The polymers were tested in both dilute organic (chloroform) and aqueous media revealing a higher FRET efficiency in water due to the enhanced emissive properties of pyrene. The application of dual labeled polymers as fluorescent probes for temperature sensing was demonstrated based on the lower critical solution temperature behavior of the PEtOx. Furthermore, these polymers could be successfully processed into fibers and thin films. Importantly, the fluorescence properties were retained in the solid state without decreasing the FRET efficiency, thus opening future possibilities for application of these materials in solar cells and/or sensors.
Introduction
Dye-functionalized polymers have been extensively studied for their use in various fields such as nonlinear optics,1,2 optical imaging,3,4 light harvesting,5 optical sensors,6,7 data storage8,9 and so on.10,11 Among them polymers that are end-functionalized with dyes have shown great promise in both theoretical areas for studying polymer chain dynamics, intra or inter-molecular association and conformational changes as well as in practical applications such as signal amplification in diagnostic tests and light-harvesting antennas.12–14 Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a very useful tool for the investigation of conformation transitions of a polymer chain and, thus, various sensors detecting the variation in the molecular environment can be constructed based on the judicious choice of the FRET pair of fluorophores.15–18 The FRET method has been extensively used in bio-related systems such as peptides, DNA, and proteins to obtain quantitative conformational information.19–23 Moreover, the FRET technique was also used to study the polymer functionality, architecture, colloidal properties and molecular weight.24–31 Furthermore, FRET probes are superior to single dye labeled probes due to their reduced sensitivity to concentration effects and possibility to monitor the process using two different wavelengths (i.e., ratiometric detection) which reduces the influence of different environmental parameters such as viscosity, pH, or polarity, thus allowing more accurate measurements. FRET analysis of α,ω-dye labeled synthetic polymers obtained by conventional radical polymerization offers only limited qualitative information due to the low labeling efficiency, complicated end-to-end distance distributions and artificial diffusion enhancement. Although well-defined heterotelechelic dye labeled polymers have been successfully obtained by means of controlled radical polymerization methods, their synthesis still remains laborious and involves several post-polymerization modification steps, generally resulting in low labeling efficiency.15,16,32–34 Consequently, finding and developing new strategies to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks represents the focus of ongoing research.
Poly(2-alkyl/aryl-2-oxazoline)s (PAOx) belong to a synthetic class of polyamides, that are obtained by living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 2-oxazoline monomers.35–41 These polymers are characterized by narrow molecular weight distributions, and various functional groups can be easily introduced at the α- and ω-chain ends through both initiation and termination, respectively.39 In the past decade, PAOx have attracted particular attention as versatile biomaterials, with poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) being the most frequently studied member of this class.42–46 Moreover PAOx have also been successfully used in the construction of solar cells, materials with multicolor emission and thermoresponsive photoluminescent materials.47–51 Therefore, single-labeled polymers have conveniently been synthesized using either the “terminator” or “initiator” method. Even though combining both methods would enable facile access to α,ω-dual labeled polymers, this has not yet been explored to study the FRET behavior of such polymers, to the best of our knowledge. Fluorophores must be adequately chosen to provide the correct and desired information about the investigated system. The fluorophores should have high molar extinction coefficients and quantum yields as well as good photostability. In addition, an optimal FRET pair should have: (i) large spectral separation between the donor and acceptor emission, and (ii) similar quantum yields and detection efficiencies. Consequently, in this work we focused our attention to pyrene and coumarin 343 as the FRET donor and acceptor, respectively. Previous reports have demonstrated that this fluorophore pair can be used for intramolecular FRET in peptides, and in synthetic polymer systems,52,53 making it an ideal system to study the effect of fluorophore positioning in dye-functionalized PEtOx.
Thus, in the present study, we demonstrate that the living CROP of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline allows facile access to single and/or dual labeled polymers. These polymers serve as the basis to study the effect of dyes-positioning as well as the polymer chain length on the FRET efficiency in different solvents. Finally, the applicability of these systems as FRET-based solution temperature sensors as well as for solid state applications based on energy transfer between the FRET dyes in thin films and nanofibers was assessed. The current study not only expands the synthetic methodologies to obtain well-defined heterotelechelic polymers by CROP but also paves the way for future applications for in vivo imaging and/or in vitro assay studies that are highly needed not only for PAOx homopolymers but also for copolymers in quest of moving forward towards advanced in vivo applications. Moreover, the optimized labelling protocol developed in this study could be easily transferred to amphiphilic PAOx block-copolymers, which are demonstrated to be promising candidates for the construction of drug delivery systems54–57 to obtain important information regarding the exchange dynamics which is difficult to acquire using other methods.

Instrumentation

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz at room temperature in chloroform-d (CDCl3) purchased from Euriso-top. The chemical shifts are given in parts per million (δ), relative to CDCl3 at 7.24 ppm.
Gas chromatography was performed on an Agilent 7890A system equipped with a VWR Carrier-160 hydrogen generator and an Agilent HP-5 column of 30 m length and 0.320 mm diameter. An FID detector was used and the inlet was set to 250 °C with a split injection ratio of 25:1. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1. The oven temperature was increased by 20 °C min−1 from 50 °C to 120 °C, followed by a ramp of 50 °C min−1 to 300 °C.
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC): Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Agilent 1260-series HPLC system equipped with a 1260 online degasser, a 1260 ISO-pump, a 1260 automatic liquid sampler (ALS), a thermostatted column compartment (TCC) at 50 °C equipped with two PLgel 5 μm mixed-D columns and a mixed-D guard column in series, a 1260 diode array detector (DAD) and a 1260 refractive index detector (RID). The used eluent was DMA containing 50 mM of LiCl at a flow rate of 0.500 mL min−1. The spectra were analyzed using the Agilent Chemstation software with the GPC add on. Molar mass and dispersity values were calculated against PMMA standards from PSS.
UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 Bio UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with a Cary temperature and stir control. Samples were measured in quartz cuvettes with a pathlength of 1.0 cm in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm.
Static fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer also equipped with a Cary temperature and stir control. The slit width of the excitation and emission was kept at 5 nm during the measurements.
Time correlated simple photon counting measurements were performed on a Horiba Fluoromax-4 with a TCDPC attachment and 345 and 430 nm nanoLED excitation devices, respectively. The instrument was set to analyze fluoresced light at specified emission wavelengths (410 or 480 nm, respectively). The solutions were prepared at 1 mg mL−1 polymer concentration in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ). All decay profiles were compared to the scattered light of a dilute LUDOX silica solution that scattered light at the wavelength of the nanoLED. Samples were analyzed in 1 cm quartz cuvettes at ambient temperature to generate pulsed emission spectra over an 800 millisecond time range (time calibration determined the instrument channel length to be 2.0793 × 10−10 seconds per channel. Data were recorded until 5000 counts were reached in the peak channels. These data were analyzed using Horiba DAZ6 software, with the decays fitted to a dual exponential fit using the following equation. I(t) = α1e−t/τ1 + α2e−t/τ2 + B(1)where I is the intensity at time t, τ1 and τ2 are the dual determined lifetime functions being determined, α1 and α2 are the respective intensities of the functions at time 0, and B represents the background emission of the system. This produced two fluorescence lifetime components with a reasonable quality fit to the emission, which could then be combined into a single average fluorescence lifetime using (2)Polymerization reaction mixtures were prepared in a VIGOR Sci-Lab SG 1200/750 glovebox system, with less than 1 ppm of O2 and H2O.
Polymerizations were conducted in a Biotage Initiator Microwave System with Robot Sixty in the temperature range of 40–250 °C equipped with a variable magnetic stirrer (300–900 rpm) utilizing capped reaction vials. These vials were heated to 200 °C overnight and allowed to cool to room temperature under vacuum and filled with nitrogen prior to use. All microwave polymerizations were performed with temperature control (IR sensor).
Deionized water was prepared with a resistivity less than 18.2 MΩ cm using an Arium 611 from Sartorius with the Sartopore 2 150 (0.45 + 0.2 μm poresize) cartridge filter.
Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager De STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with 2 m linear and 3 m reflector flight tubes, and a 355 nm Blue Lion Biotech Marathon solid state laser (3.5 ns pulse). All mass spectra were obtained with an accelerating potential of 20 kV in positive ion mode and in either reflectron or linear mode. The solutions were prepared using acetone and spotted on the plate in a trans-2-3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene malononitrile (>98.0%, TCI) matrix.
The polymeric films were obtained by spin coating a polymer solution in CHCl3 (10 mg mL−1) on quartz plates using a SPIN150 device. The applied spin coating parameters included a spin speed of 2000 rpm, an acceleration of 500 rpm s−1 and a spin time of 30 s.
The thickness of the mono and dual fluorescent dye labelled PEtOx was measured using a stylus contact profilometer (Dektak 8).
The dual α,ω-fluorescent dye labeled PEtOx with a degree of polymerization (DP) 100 electrospinning solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer (14 wt%) and high molecular weight PEtOx (11 wt%) in a mixture of water/ethanol (30/70 vol/vol), resulting in a solution with 25 wt% total polymer concentration and was subsequently stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Electrospinning experiments were performed on a mono-nozzle setup with an 18-gauge needle, a tip-to-collector distance of 10 cm and a flow rate of 1 mL h−1. The voltage was adapted in the range from 15 kV to 20 kV to enable a stable electrospinning process. The electrospinning process was performed in a climate chamber (Weisstechnik WEKK 10.50.1500) to maintain a relative humidity of 30% and a constant temperature of 25 °C.
Fiber morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200 F or FEI Phenom desktop SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Sample preparation was carried out using a gold sputter coater (Balzers Union SKD 030 or Emitech K550X). The nanofiber diameters were measured using UTHSCSA ImageTool version 3.0, developed by the University of Texas Health Science Center. The average fiber diameters and their standard deviations are based on at least 15 measurements per sample.

1H DOSY NMR spectra were measured and recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. Samples were prepared at 1 mg mL−1 in deuterated solvents (CDCl3, D2O). Samples were stationary (not spinning) and the gradient strength was increased linearly from 2% to 95% over 64 steps. The maximum gradient strength used was 0.535 T m−1. Bipolar rectangular gradients were used with a duration of 2.8 ms and the gradient recovery delay was 100 μs. Diffusion times were between 0.5 and 1.0 s. The spectrum was phased, and baseline corrected before 2D processing via Topspin 2.1.6 software (Bruker). The peak hydrodynamic radius (RHp) was calculated using the Stokes–Einstein equation. (3)where the sample viscosity (η) was determined via changes in the solvent diffusion compared to a blank solvent standard,54,58 and the Boltzmann constant (KBe-1) concentration via serial dilution.
Cloud point temperatures (TCPs) were measured on a Crystal16TM parallel crystallizer turbidimeter developed by Avantium Technologies connected to a recirculation chiller and dry compressed air. Aqueous polymer solutions (10 mg mL−1) were heated from 20 to 95 °C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C min−1 followed by cooling to 2 °C at a cooling rate of 0.5 °C min−1. This cycle was repeated three times. The TCPs are reported as the 50% transmittance temperature in the second heating run.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was measured on a Zetasizer Nano-ZS Malvern apparatus (Malvern Instruments Ltd) using disposable cuvettes. The excitation light source was a He–Ne laser at 633 nm and the intensity of the scattered light was measured at an angle of 173°. This method measures the rate of intensity fluctuation and the size of the particles is determined through the Stokes–Einstein equation. The concentration of the polymer solution was 1 mg mL−1 in all cases.
Synthesis

Synthesis of single ω-fluorophore labeled poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s. 
All polymers were synthesized under similar conditions. The monomer concentration was 4 mol L−1 in acetonitrile (ACN) for all polymerizations. The monomer/initiator [M]/[I] ratio was 10/1, 30/1, 50/1, 70/1 and 100/1, respectively. The solutions were prepared in a glove box under argon and the reactions were carried out in capped microwave vials. The polymerization mixtures were heated to 140 °C under microwave irradiation for 71 s ([M]/[I] = 10), 214 s ([M]/[I] = 30), 307 s ([M]/[I] = 50), 499 s ([M]/[I] = 70), and 713 s ([M]/[I] = 100) to reach almost full conversion. For the end-capping reactions, the vial was cooled down to room temperature and a solution of the corresponding acid in DMF 1.5-fold excess was added via a syringe through the septum of the capped microwave vial containing the living oligomers. Thereafter, TEA was added similarly in a two-fold molar excess relative to initiator. The given amounts were varied according to the used monomer to initiator ratios. The reaction solution was heated to 100 °C for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform and the solution was washed three times with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. Then the solution was washed with distilled water and brine, dried over MgSO4 and filtered. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure resulting in a foamy polymer. The polymers were dissolved again in chloroform, precipitated in ice cold diethyl ether, and centrifuged for 10 minutes (7500 rpm) at 5 °C. The liquid was removed and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in DCM and evaporated under reduced pressure resulting in a white or yellow foam for the polymers modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid or coumarin 343, respectively. Finally, the polymers were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50 °C. All homopolymers were obtained in high yields (>80%).

Kinetic investigation of the microwave-assisted homopolymerization of EtOx initiated with 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene. 
A stock solution consisting of monomer, initiator (1-(bromomethyl)pyrene) and solvent (acetonitrile) was prepared in a glovebox. The initial monomer concentration was 4 mol L−1 for all the experiments. After stirring for 10 minutes the stock solution was divided into separate 0.5–2.0 mL Biotage reaction vials in portions of 800 μL with automated pipettes. After preparing the polymerization mixtures, they were placed in the autosampler of the Biotage microwave and were left to react at 140 °C for varying times. The points of the kinetic studies are all based on individual polymerization reactions. The sample of 1 second was always included to determine the influence of the heating ramp. After the polymerizations, the polymerization mixture was diluted with 1 mL of chloroform and stirred for 10 minutes. Two samples of 100 μL were taken. The first 100 μL sample was taken for GC analysis and was further diluted with chloroform until a total volume of 1.5 mL. The second 100 μL was taken for SEC analysis and was further diluted with DMA until 1.5 mL. The samples were filtered over syringe filters with membranes made of hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with a pore size of 0.22 μm. SEC analysis was performed to determine the number average molar mass (Mn) and dispersities (Đ).


Synthesis of single α-pyrene labeled poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (iD). 
All polymers were synthesized under similar conditions. The monomer concentration was 4 mol L−1 in ACN for all polymerizations. The monomer (1-(bromomethyl)pyrene))/initiator [M]/[I] ratio was 10/1, 30/1, 50/1, 70/1 and 100/1, respectively. The solutions were prepared in a glove box under argon and the reactions were carried out in capped microwave vials. The polymerization mixtures were heated to 140 °C under microwave irradiation of 183 s ([M]/[I] = 10), 548 s ([M]/[I] = 30), 913 s ([M]/[I] = 50), 1279 s ([M]/[I] = 70), and 1827 s ([M]/[I] = 100) to reach almost full conversion. The polymerizations were quenched by the addition of a 1 M KOH solution in MeOH. The polymers were precipitated in ice cold diethyl ether and centrifuged for 10 minutes (7500 rpm) at 5 °C. The liquid was removed, and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in DCM and reprecipited in diethyl ether. Then the polymers were redissolved in DCM and evaporated under reduced pressure resulting in a white foam. Finally, the polymers were dried overnight in the vacuum oven at 50 °C. All α-pyrene labeled homopolymers were obtained with good purities and in high yields.


Synthesis of dual-labeled poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (DA). 
All polymers were synthesized using the same procedure presented above for α-pyrene labeled poly (2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s. For the end-capping reactions, the vial was cooled down to room temperature and a solution of the coumarin 343 in DMF 1.5-fold excess was added via a syringe through the septum of the capped microwave vial containing the living oligomers. Thereafter TEA was added similarly in a two-fold molar excess relative to initiator. The given amounts were varied according to the used monomer to initiator ratios. The reaction solution was heated to 100 °C for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform and the solution was washed three times with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. Then the solution was washed with distilled water and brine, dried over magnesium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure resulting in a foamy polymer. The polymers were dissolved again in chloroform, precipitated in ice cold diethyl ether, and centrifuged for 10 minutes (7500 rpm) at 5 °C. The liquid was removed and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in DCM and evaporated under reduced pressure resulting in yellow foam. Finally, the polymers were dried overnight in the vacuum oven at 50 °C. All dual labeled homopolymers were obtained with good purities and in high yields.

Synthesis of high molecular weight non-functionalized PEtOx. 
The high molecular weight non-functionalized PEtOx was synthesized at lower temperatures and a lower monomer conversion (75%) was targeted to reduce chain transfer reactions. The polymerization solution was prepared in a glovebox in a pre-dried and silanized 1 L schlenck flask. In short, 161.5 mL of EtOx (1333 equivalents, 1.6 mol) and 181 μL of MeOTs (1 equivalent, 1.2 mmol) were added to 238 mL of chlorobenzene to obtain a 4 M monomer solution. The solution was subsequently heated to 80 °C for 29 hours, until a monomer conversion of 75% was reached, which was determined by GC. The polymerization was terminated by the addition of 3 mL of a 1 M KOH solution in MeOH (2.5 molar equivalents relative to the initiator), and the resulting solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. Next, distilled water was added, 550 mL of milliQ water was added and the mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure, this procedure was repeated 5 times to remove chlorobenzene. The aqueous polymer solution was subsequently dialyzed (molecular weight cut-off 3.5 kDa) and freezedried to obtain the pure polymer.

FRET calculations. 
The Förster theory shows that FRET efficiency (EFRET) varies as the sixth power of the distance between two molecules (eqn (4)). To calculate the FRET efficiency, one has to determine the spectral overlap integral J and the interchromophoric distance r. (4)where R0 is the distance between the two molecules at 50% FRET efficiency and r being the interchromophoric distance for the experiment. R0 can be calculated using eqn (5). R0 = 0.02108(κ2ΦDn−4J)1/6(5)where ΦD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, κ2 is the orientation factor of transition dipole moment between the donor and acceptor; κ2 can take values between 0 and 4. In the present case we have considered κ2 = 2/3 (when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to isotropically oriented during the excited state lifetime), n is the refractive index of the medium, and J is the spectral overlap integral calculated as: (6)where εAcceptor(λ) is the acceptor molar extinction coefficient at wavelength λ, λ is the wavelength and  is the normalized emission spectrum of the donor. By integrating this over the entire spectrum one can calculate the J value, and the unit of J(λ) is M−1 cm−1 nm4. The quantum yield of the pyrene labeled polymers was determined as described in the next section.
The efficiency of FRET can be determined by steady-state measurements and is expressed as eqn (7). From this r can be calculated as follows: (7)where FDA and FD are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor respectively. The FRET efficiency was determined by the donor quenching method.
The actual distance r between donor and acceptor is given by: (8)
The quantum yield of the labeled polymers was determined via comparison with anthracene in ethanol which has a known quantum yield of 0.27.59 The quantum yield (ΦX) was calculated using eqn (9): (9)where X represents the analyte, ST the standard (anthracene/ethanol), Grad the gradient of integrated fluorescence emission/absorbance and n the refractive index of solvents.

A series of well-defined PEtOx polymers having a single donor or acceptor at the ω-chain end with varying degrees of polymerization were synthesized by CROP of EtOx initiated with methyl tosylate (MeOTs) followed by termination with either 1-pyrenebutyric acid (Py) or coumarin 343 (Cou343) (Fig. 1a). The obtained polymers showed narrow molar mass distributions (Đ ≤ 1.15) as well as high degrees of functionalization (>92%) as determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Table 1 and Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). Furthermore, the number average molecular weight (Mn) increased with the increasing target degree of polymerization (DP). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed a single polymer distribution in all cases and the exact masses of the corresponding peaks fit to a PEtOx structure with both methyl, and pyrene or coumarin end-groups (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). Taking advantage of the synthetic versatility of PAOx, α,ω-dual-functionalized PEtOx could be easily obtained by using 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene as the initiator instead of MeOTs in combination with termination with Cou343 (Fig. 1a). To investigate the suitability of 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene as the initiator for the CROP of EtOx, we performed a kinetic study with a polymerization temperature of 140 °C and a monomer concentration of 4 M in acetonitrile. The first-order kinetic plot of monomer consumption with respect to the reaction time revealed a linear relationship (Fig. 1b), thus demonstrating a constant amount of propagating species indicative of the absence of termination reactions. Moreover, Mn increased linearly with conversion, while the dispersity remained below 1.15, indicating the absence of significant chain transfer side reactions (Fig. 1c and Table 1). As such, it can be concluded that 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene is a good initiator for the CROP of EtOx resulting in a living polymerization.

The polymerization rate constant was calculated form the linear fit of the first order kinetic plot, assuming that the concentration of propagating species is equal to the initial initiator concentration, i.e., complete initiation. The value obtained is similar to kp that has been reported for the CROP of EtOx initiated with benzyl bromide under similar conditions.60 This method was subsequently applied for the preparation of dual-functionalized PEtOx having both pyrene and Cou343 end-groups.
The degree of functionalization was found to be over 90% by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which is comparable with the one obtained for single-labeled polymers obtained by termination (Table 1 and Fig. S7, ESI†). MALDI-TOF-MS and SEC-RI/UV analyses further proved the successful incorporation of both dyes (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). α-Pyrene functionalized polymers (Py PEtOx; iD10–100) were also synthesized with 1-(bromomethyl)pyrene as the initiator as control samples and used for evaluating the FRET efficiency in the dual labeled PEtOx. The polymers showed the expected molecular weight and low dispersities indicating their defined nature (Table S1 and Fig. S10, ESI†).
FRET analysis in solution
After the successful preparation of the dye-functionalized PEtOx, we focused our attention on their fluorescence behavior in solution to evaluate the FRET. The intermolecular FRET transfer between complementary ω-dye-labeled polymer chains was investigated in chloroform. The fluorescence emission spectra of the individual donor or acceptor labeled polymers (D10–100 and A10–100) displayed the same fluorescence as the corresponding organic fluorophores as expected, since the ester linkage to the polymer chain has a minimal influence on the conjugated system of the dyes (Fig. S11, ESI†). Unexpectedly, the emission spectra of the pyrene-initiated iD10–100 polymers were quite different from the pyrene-terminated D10–100 polymers (Fig. S14, ESI†). At the same fluorophore concentration, the fluorescence intensity of the Py initiated PEtOx was lower, while the ratio between I1/I5 decreased, thus suggesting a more hydrophilic microenvironment in the case of ω-Py labeled polymer. Such a behavior indicates a lower exposure of ω-Py units to the solvent compared to α-Py labeled PEtOx due to a higher shielding effect of the polymeric chains, also promoted by the propyl flexible spacer. This is a surprising observation as the chemical structures of these labels are distinct only by the covalent linker to the polymer backbone (ester linkage compared to methyl separator), however, the influence of the conjugation on the emissive properties cannot be completely ruled out.
Next, the dye-terminated polymers were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio between the fluorophores at 10 μM concentration, and after selective excitation of the donor at 345 nm, the emission spectrum showed the donor and acceptor emission, thus suggesting the occurrence of intermolecular energy transfer (Fig. 2). The FRET efficiency was rather low around 10%, independent of the DP of the PEtOx chains (Fig. 2 and Fig. S12, S13a, ESI†), which is similar to the FRET efficiency between the two fluorophores (i.e., 9.6% FRET efficiency) at 10 μM (Fig. S11 and S13b, ESI†). These results indicate that at this low concentration of 10 μM, the fluorophores are too far apart for efficient FRET. Consequently, connecting the two fluorophores together through a polymeric spacer should increase the FRET efficiency, by bringing them into closer proximity. Next, the fluorescence of α-Py labeled PEtOx was investigated.

Fluorescence spectroscopy of the donor–acceptor labeled polymers (DA10–100) demonstrated a significant increase in the emission of the acceptor, upon excitation of the donor (Fig. 3). This enhanced emission can be assigned to the intramolecular FRET taking place between the fluorophores, as we already demonstrated that intermolecular FRET efficiency is very low at the used 10 μM concentration. The FRET efficiency increases from 15.1% to 79.2% with a decrease in the degree of polymerization from 100 to 10, because of the smaller distance between the two fluorophores (Table 2). The energy transfer is affected not only by the chain length of the polymer but also by the solvent and the temperature. Consequently, we expanded our studies to other organic solvents and aqueous media because PEtOx is a biocompatible water-soluble polymer, which also displays thermoresponsive behavior in water. Moreover, FRET could represent an efficient and simple tool to determine the influence of the solvent on the conformational changes of PEtOx. The effect of solvent viscosity and/or polarity on the FRET efficiency has been investigated for DA30 as a representative member of the series. The FRET efficiency increased in solvents with high viscosity (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethylene glycol) (Table 2 and Fig. S15, ESI†) due to the suppression of internal conversion of Py excited species, thus leading to a higher fluorescence quantum yield. The FRET efficiency generally increased also with solvent polarity from 40.2% in CHCl3 to 68.1% in DMSO, although a lower value could be found in ethanol as compared to acetonitrile and DMSO. The emission maxima of Cou343 showed a bathochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity in the order: CHCl3 (468 nm), acetonitrile (479 nm), ethanol (481 nm), DMSO (484 nm) to ethylene glycol (488 nm).

An 8-fold increase in the emission intensity of the α-single pyrene labeled PEtOx was observed when switching from CHCl3 to water, while only a small variation was observed for Cou343 labeled PEtOx (Fig. S16, ESI†). This behavior can be explained by the higher quantum yield of Py–PEtOx in water as compared to CHCl3 (Table S1, ESI†) due to solvent pyrene-interactions as well as the change in conformation of the polymer chains, which restricts the collisional quenching of the fluorophore. The data are in accordance with the results previously reported by Winnik et al. demonstrating that going from an apolar to a polar solvent enhances the molar extinction coefficient of the O–O band of pyrene (Fig. S16, ESI†).61 For A50 we noticed a 25 nm bathochromic shift when switching from CHCl3 to water. Moreover, the emission band at 493 nm showed a hypsochromic shift (i.e., fluorescence quenching), which can be ascribed to the reduced solubility of the polymer in water and hydrogen bonding interactions.62 The FRET efficiency is greatly enhanced in water compared to CHCl3, suggesting a decreased distance between the fluorophores. The increased FRET can be ascribed to the decrease in solvent quality for the highly hydrophobic fluorophores, possibly leading to the formation of hydrophobic domains, which maximizes the FRET transfer. The FRET dependency on chain length follows the same, expected trend as in CHCl3, that a lower FRET efficiency is observed at higher DP. The lower intensity of the emission of Cou343 registered for DA10 could be explained by the reduced solubility of this polymer in water and the high tendency for aggregation, which leads to fluorescence quenching.

Fig. 4 shows the distance dependence of FRET efficiency for the donor–acceptor dual-labeled PEtOx, as calculated from the FRET efficiency obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy. The 50% transfer efficiency corresponds to a value of Förster radius (R0) of 4.5 nm in CHCl3 and 4.6 nm in water, respectively. Because chloroform is a better solvent for dye-labeled polymers, the PEtOx chains adopt a more extended conformation leading to a larger average donor–acceptor distance than in water (Table 2). If the chain end-to-end distance (r) is equated to the polymer RG, then information about the shape and compactness of the polymer can be determined if the hydrodynamic radius (RH) is also known.32 Consequently, DOSY-NMR measurements were performed (Fig. S19, ESI†) to determine the RH of the dual labeled polymers and the results are listed in Table 2. In CHCl3 the RH increases from 5 nm to 6.7 nm as the DP increases from 10 to 100, which is roughly in line with the chain end-to-end distance r. Comparatively in an aqueous environment the chain end-to-end distance increases from 2.5 nm and 4.5 nm while the diffusion measurements predict the polymers to have an RH ranging from 13 nm to 28 nm. Additional hydrodynamic radii of singly labeled polymers are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The ratio of ρ (RG/RH) in CHCl3 increases from 0.7 to 0.9, whereby theoretically a ρ of 0.778 corresponds to homogeneous hard sphere dissolved polymers while a ρ of 0.87 to 0.98 indicates oblate ellipsoid structures. These data suggest that the dual-labeled PEtOx is well solvated in chloroform while this does not appear to be the case in the aqueous systems. Due to the increased RH seen in the aqueous systems this would suggest a ρ of < 0.3, which is not feasible. The increased hydrodynamic radii in water compared to other solvents suggest that the dye labeled polymers either form minor aggregates, chain-to-chain intramolecular interactions artificially increase the hydrodynamic radii or the polymer chain ends are interacting and the polymer is no longer obeying the freely jointed chain model. To investigate this observation, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out (Fig. S20, ESI†) providing further evidence that in aqueous solution there is agglomeration of multiple polymer chains.

The fluorescence lifetime of the pyrene (donor) unit in these systems was determined by measuring their excited state lifetime in dilute aqueous medium. Both donor only and dual labelled donor–acceptor systems were studied as shown in Fig. 5. The pyrene moiety in the polymer system with only the donor was found to have a lifetime that decreased from 140–130 nanoseconds as the DP was increased from 30–100 (DP10 was not tested). For the donor–acceptor pair, however, the lifetime was significantly reduced and ranged from 77–111 ns for the same series – trending upwards from DP 50 to DP 100 in line with our expectation of increased molecular weight leading to an increased separation between the chain ends. Full data are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S23–S26 and Tables S3).

The lifetime of the Cou343 acceptor dye, when directly excited, was also tested and it was found that both the single as well as dual labeled Cou343–PEtOx exhibited a lifetime between 4 and 8 ns, and the trend for both the donor and donor–acceptor systems was comparable (A10 was not tested) (Fig. S27, ESI†). Full data are shown in the ESI† (Table S4).
Thermoresponsive FRET behavior
As PEtOx is thermoresponsive in aqueous solution, we studied the thermoresponsive behavior of the dual dye-labeled polymers to evaluate their use for potential sensing applications. Cloud point temperatures (TCP) and turbidimetry profiles of the PEtOx dye labeled polymers are provided in Table 1 and Fig. S21, S22 (ESI†). The presence of the hydrophobic dye end-groups reduced the polymer solubility in water, and most of the dye-labeled PEtOx displayed LCST behavior. The results are in accordance with the previous report of Jordan et al. showing that incorporation of hydrophobic end-groups decreases the TCP.63 As expected, the polymer solubility and, thus, the TCP increased with the increasing chain length, whereby A10, D10, and DA10 were not completely water soluble at the investigated concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The Py-functionalized PEtOx showed a lower TCP than the Cou343-functionalized PEtOx, which can be explained by the difference in the hydrophobicity of the two fluorophores. The dual-labeled polymers showed even lower TCPs, due to the higher overall hydrophobicity. Lower TCPs were registered for iD30–100 as compared to their counterparts D30–100 polymers (Fig. S21, ESI†) evidencing once more the importance of Py positioning on the polymeric chain.
The thermo-sensing ability of the fluorophore labeled PEtOx polymers was investigated by temperature controlled fluorescence spectroscopy at a polymer concentration of 1 mg mL−1. Single labeled Py polymers showed a marked decrease in the fluorescence intensity with increasing temperatures (Fig. S28a, ESI†). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of single labeled Cou343 PEtOx slightly increased with increasing temperatures (Fig. S28b, ESI†). The analysis of the fluorescence spectra of the DA polymers reveals a decrease of the Cou343 FRET emission and a 5 nm hypsochromic shift with the increasing temperature (Fig. 6 and Fig. S29, ESI†). The blue shift of the emission could be correlated with a change in the polarity of the local environment and disruption of hydrogen bonding between Cou343 and the solvent due to the collapse of the polymeric chains. The temperature-dependent emission that was observed for the DA PEtOx can be attributed to a decrease of FRET efficiency due to the lower fluorescence quantum yield of the pyrene with increasing temperature. Moreover, the threshold of the emission decrease is dependent on the chain length of the polymer, increasing from 40 to 60 °C. These threshold values nicely correspond with the TCP of the DA30–100 polymers (Fig. 6 and Fig. S29 and S30, ESI†), thus demonstrating the applicability of the dual labeled PEtOx polymers as fluorescent probes for temperature sensing. To determine the influence of the polymer concentration on the sensing ability, a solution of DA70 having a 0.1 mg mL−1 concentration was investigated as well by temperature controlled fluorescence spectroscopy. The same characteristic temperature-emission pattern can also be observed at 0.1 mg mL−1, although the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of Cou343 is found to be lower than at 1 mg mL−1 (Fig. S31, ESI†). Nevertheless, the determined threshold value is 60 °C, which is in accordance with the value found when a 1 mg mL−1 solution was used.
 Fig. 6  Fluorescence spectra as a function of temperature for (a) DA30, and (b) DA50, respectively. In all cases, the excitation wavelength was 345 nm, and the concentration of the polymer was 1 mg mL−1. 
DLS temperature sweep experiments were used to monitor the aggregation behavior during heating of the aqueous solution of DA dye-labeled polymers. The size versus temperature at 1 mg mL−1 concentration is shown in Fig. S32 (ESI†). Large aggregation was observed when the solution was heated above the TCP, in all cases. The DLS revealed very similar values of the TCP in accordance with the turbidimetry measurements (Fig. S30, ESI†).
FRET analysis in solid state
The energy transfer process of the dual labeled PEtOx polymers was also studied in the solid state (e.g., films and nanofibers) in order to investigate their potential to be used in practical applications. Thin films were obtained by spin-coating the DA10–100 polymers as well as the single labeled PEtOx–Py D10–100. The emission intensity (ID) of the D10–100 was used to calculate the FRET efficiency.16 A value of 0.476 was used for the orientation factor, which corresponds to dipoles randomly oriented in a rigid medium.64,65 The R0 distance in the film was determined to be 4.7 nm, while the calculated FRET efficiency was higher than 99%, regardless of the DP of the polymer. In the film, the two fluorophores were found to be in close proximity (i.e., r ≈ 1.4 nm), thus increasing the possibility of energy transfer.
Next, we investigated the use of DA100 for electrospun nanofibers due to its potential applications in photonics area as laser and/or optical sensors. Nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning of a polymer solution consisting of a mixture of DA100 (14 wt%) and a high molecular weight non-functionalized PEtOx (11 wt%; Mn: 70 kDa; Mp: 85 kDa; Đ: 1.39), which was added to aid to electrospinnability of the solution by enhancing its viscosity.66 The SEM analysis of the obtained nanofibers revealed the formation of homogeneous, smooth, uniform and beadless fibers with a diameter of 405 ± 84 nm. iD100 nanofibers were also prepared as the reference material. Fluorescence analysis revealed the FRET in the electrospun DA100 nanofibers (Fig. 7). Irradiation with 345 nm light led to Cou343 emission at 500 nm, while the emission of Py was strongly diminished. The inset in Fig. 7 also nicely illustrates the change in color of the nanofibers upon 345 nm light irradiation. A reference experiment was performed by electrospinning a solution containing a mixture of D100, A100, and non-functionalized high molar mass PEtOx. In line with the previous results, uniform nanofibers were obtained, showing a similar morphology as compared to DA100 nanofibers (Fig. S33, ESI†). The FRET efficiency in the D100–A100 nanofibers was found to be lower than in DA100 nanofibers demonstrating the importance of fluorophore positioning in the solid state. Moreover, the Cou343 emission in D100–A100 nanofibers showed a 10 nm hypsochromic shift as compared to DA100 and A100 only nanofibers (Fig. S33, ESI†), suggesting a more hydrophobic environment. These preliminary measurements unveil the possibility of further developing these materials for future applications in areas such as the detection of explosives, heavy metal ions, solar cells and/or bioimaging.

Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrated the synthesis of α- or ω-single and α,ω-dual fluorophore labeled PEtOx polymers with high yields, low dispersity, and a high degree of functionalization. As expected, the intermolecular FRET transfer between ω-labeled polymers was low and comparable with the energy transfer between the organic fluorophores. However, connecting the two fluorophores via a PEtOx chain resulted in high intramolecular FRET efficiency, which was more efficient for shorter polymers. Improved FRET efficiency was also demonstrated for the α,ω-dual fluorophore labeled PEtOx in aqueous media as compared to CHCl3 as the organic solvent. The use of these polymers as fluorescent probes for temperature sensing was demonstrated based on the change in FRET efficiency with increasing temperatures. The PEtOx optical thermometers showed a temperature sensing regime from 40 to 60 °C. Moreover, films and nanofibers were successfully obtained using these materials, while maintaining their emissive properties in the solid state, without altering the energy transfer efficiency. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the chain length and solvent effect on the FRET efficiency and demonstrated the importance of locating the chromophores on the same polymer. It is expected that these polymer structures could be used for investigating many photophysical phenomena, as well as the polymer chain conformation. Moreover, the near-quantitative labeling strategy expands the methodology for the preparation of poly(2-oxazoline)s with functional groups located at specific sites. Furthermore, these polymers could find useful applications in solar cells as well as in fluorescence microscopy, which is under current investigations in our lab.
