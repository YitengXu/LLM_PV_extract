    , Accepted 25th June 2019First published on 25th June 2019AbstractNonprecious metals with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are recognized as effective light harvesters owing to their merits of cost-effectiveness and tunable spectral response range. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a fascinating nonprecious metallic plasmonic photocatalyst Sn/SnO2−x with peapod-like hetero-nanostructures fabricated via an electrospinning-hydrogenation process. The hydrogenation gives rise to the simultaneous formation of metallic Sn nanoparticle peas and oxygen vacancies in SnO2 semiconductors. Metallic Sn generates unprecedented strong LSPR absorption in the visible light region, which significantly enhances the utilization of photon energies in a broad UV-vis region for the peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x hetero-nanostructure. In addition, the built-in semiconductor-metal Schottky junctions are of great benefit in promoting charge carrier separation and the oxygen vacancies are favorable for accelerating surface catalytic oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. As a result, the peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x hetero-nanostructure delivers an improved photoelectrochemical performance with a high photocurrent density of 245 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is seven times higher than that of pristine SnO2. It is believed that the present work will deepen the comprehensive understanding of the LSPR effect from nonprecious metals and open up new opportunities for other solar energy-related areas.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is of great significance to mitigate global environmental problems by harvesting and converting abundant solar energy into clean chemical energy.1–3 A typical PEC water splitting process involves the hydrogen evolution reaction at the photocathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the photoanode.4–6 It is important to note that the OER includes a four-electron transfer process, which is the rate-determining step of PEC water splitting.7,8 Therefore, the development of highly efficient photoanodes is the most critical yet challenging issue. Over the past few decades, immense efforts have been taken in the search for highly efficient photoanode materials. An optimal candidate should meet the rigid requirements of (i) capturing a substantial proportion of the solar spectrum and (ii) superior carrier mobility for improving catalytic reaction activity at the interface.9–12 Tin dioxide (SnO2) semiconductors are one of the most promising materials owing to their nontoxicity, suitable band structure, and earth-abundance.13,14 In particular, SnO2 possesses an impressive carrier mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1),15 which is significantly higher than that of TiO2 (0.1–1 cm2 V−1 s−1),16,17 WO3 (∼12 cm2 V−1 s−1),18,19 Fe2O3 (10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1),20 and BiVO4 (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1).9 The higher carrier mobility is favorable for accelerating charge transfer kinetics. However, the band gap of SnO2 is as large as ∼3.5 eV, making it poorly responsive to visible light, which covers 43% of the total solar spectrum. In addition, SnO2 is a direct band gap semiconductor, leading to the easy recombination of photogenerated carriers. To address these issues, enormous efforts have been dedicated to promoting light harvesting and charge generation/separation, including compositing with other band-level-matched semiconductors and heteroatom doping with nonmetallic elements.15,21,22 Despite these achievements, the performance of the SnO2-related PEC system is far from satisfactory, and more elaborate research activities are still necessary.
Plasmonics has been widely used as an effective light-harvesting technique in PEC water splitting.23–28 The plasmonic effect results from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which can enhance the local electromagnetic field to strengthen electron–light interactions and thus broaden the light response range.29–31 Upon light illumination, the collective oscillation of the free conduction electrons in a metal can promote significant generation of hot carriers. The generated hot electrons will overcome the band-gap limitation and inject into the conduction band of semiconductors immediately, or participate in chemical reactions directly.32–34 Additionally, the LSPR absorbance bands can be adjusted through changing the size, shape, and dielectric constant of the surrounding environment.35–37 Owing to these favorable features, integrating noble metal particles (such as Au) with semiconductors has been explored in various fields of biology, environment and catalysis. However, the conventional noble metal Au has low reserves on earth and high-cost. Therefore, it is intriguing and of utmost importance to develop low-cost and non-precious plasmonic materials as a replacement or complement for noble metals.
Tin (Sn), an earth-abundant and non-precious metal, has been theoretically calculated to show plasmonic properties similar to those of noble metals.38,39 It is demonstrated that the LSPR-induced light absorption range of Sn can be modulated from the ultraviolet to infrared region through controlling particle sizes. The plasmonic characteristics of metallic Sn have been utilized in the field of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection.40,41 However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of metallic Sn as a plasmonic booster in PEC water oxidation has never been reported.
In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the use of non-precious plasmonic Sn particles to boost the PEC water oxidation property of SnO2. Peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x heterostructures, which feature metallic Sn nanoparticles embedded within oxygen-deficient SnO2−x nanotubes, are fabricated by a facile electrospinning and hydrogenation process. When used as the photoanode catalyst for PEC water oxidation, the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure manifests a substantial enhancement in the performance. The enhancement can be attributed to the following: (i) the plasmonic effect of metallic Sn enables Sn/SnO2−x to show strong light absorption in a broader UV-vis range; (ii) the built-in Schottky junction between metallic Sn and SnO2−x reduces the electron–hole recombination rate; (iii) the hollow structure facilitates light scattering to increase the propagation length for more light harvesting and the porous nanotube could accelerate electrolyte diffusion; and (iv) the oxygen vacancies provide effective active sites for the surface OER. The present study will pave a new way for the application of SnO2-based photoanodes in solar energy driven fields and provide guidance for the investigation of the plasmonic properties of non-precious metals.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials synthesis
SnO2 nanofibers were fabricated by an electrospinning technique. In a typical synthesis, 2 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1300000) and 1.125 g SnCl2·2H2O were dissolved in a mixed solvent of ethanol (14 ml) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 11 ml). After being magnetically stirred overnight at room temperature, the precursor solution was loaded into a 25 mL syringe for electrospinning. During the electrospinning process, the flow rate of the precursor solution was maintained at 0.5 mL h−1. The applied voltage between the collector and the syringe tip was controlled at 18.0 kV. The electrospun nanofibers were collected on aluminum foil which was placed at a distance of ∼15 cm from the needle. Subsequently, the obtained electrospun composites were calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to remove PVP and obtain SnO2 nanofibers. Finally, the Sn/SnO2−x nanotube peapods were acquired through hydrogenation treatment of SnO2 at 500 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a 5% H2/Ar (30 sccm) flow.
2.2. Characterization
The crystal structure was analyzed using an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu-7000) instrument equipped with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer in an ultrahigh vacuum environment (Shimadzu Kratos, monochromatic Al Kα radiation). The binding energies were calibrated using the containment carbon (C 1s 284.8 eV). Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer through dispersing the samples in distilled water. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Verios G4) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded with a JEOL JES-X320 operating in the X-band frequency at room temperature. A capillary tube with a diameter of 0.9 mm and a length of 78 mm (volume: 50 mm3) was used as the sample container. The approximate loading volume of each sample was 19 mm3. The microwave power was 1 mW. The modulation frequency and width were 100 kHz and 0.5 mT, respectively.
2.3. PEC measurements
The photoelectrode was prepared by dispersing the active material (10 mg) in a solution containing Nafion (0.5 wt%, 50 μL) and ethanol (500 μL). After sonication for 30 min, the mixture (50 μL) was drop-casted onto an L-type glassy carbon electrode (area: 0.28 cm2) and dried under lamp irradiation. The PEC properties were evaluated using a three-electrode system, in which the as-prepared Sn/SnO2−x photoanode, a Pt plate, and Ag/AgCl were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7) solution was used as the electrolyte and bubbled with N2 gas for 0.5 h to remove the dissolved oxygen prior to the measurement. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique was used to record the photocurrent versus potential curve at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under solar light illumination (300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter, 100 mW cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded under an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) over the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz at an AC amplitude of 10 mV with light irradiation. Transient photocurrent density versus time curves were obtained under chopped light illumination with an on/off interval of 50 s at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a light source equipped with a monochromator at 0.6 V vs. RHE.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation procedure of the Sn/SnO2−x nanotube peapods is schematically displayed in Fig. 1a. Briefly, the conventional electrospinning technique was applied to fabricate a SnCl2–PVP precursor fabric. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the fabric is composed of uniform nanofibers with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 160 nm, constructing an interconnected network structure. Subsequently, a calcination process was carried out in air to remove PVP polymers and oxidize SnCl2 to SnO2. The SnO2 nanotube structure was formed after calcination, and the outer diameter of the nanofiber was decreased to approximately 100 nm (Fig. 1d, e and S1†). Finally, the SnO2 nanofiber fabric was treated under a H2/Ar atmosphere, resulting in the formation of Sn/SnO2−x products. It is observed that the nanofibers are broken into short segments with rough surfaces (Fig. 1f). More interestingly, open ends are clearly visible on the nanofibers (Fig. 1g), suggesting the generation of hollow structures.

More microstructural information of the Sn/SnO2−x hybrid was obtained by TEM imaging. Fig. 2a presents a low-magnification TEM image of Sn/SnO2−x, revealing that the Sn particles are encapsulated in SnO2−x nanotubes, forming a unique peapod-like structure. The average diameter of the Sn particles is about 180 nm. The nanotube walls are composed of nanoparticles and the wall thickness is around 15 nm. Lattice fringe spacings of 0.291 and 0.333 nm in the high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM, Fig. 2b) match well with the (200) planes of metallic Sn and the (110) planes of SnO2−x respectively.42,43 Moreover, the Sn/SnO2−x nanotube peapods are further confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 2c). The corresponding EDX images indicate that the inner particles are primarily composed of Sn elements and the tube walls homogeneously consist of Sn and O elemental signals. All the above results demonstrate the successful construction of peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x nano-heterostructures. It is believed that the porous SnO2 nanotubes would facilitate efficient electrolyte diffusion and ingress. In addition, the hollow voids could prolong the photon pathways by light scattering and metallic Sn interior may provide the plasmonic effect, thereby leading to improved light harvesting. Benefiting from these virtues, an enhanced PEC water oxidation performance is anticipated from the peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x heterostructures.

The phase structure of the as-synthesized Sn/SnO2−x is revealed by XRD. As shown in Fig. 3a and S2,† the strong diffraction peaks located at 26.6°, 33.9°, 37.9°, 39.1°, 51.8°, 54.8°, 57.9°, 62.0°, 64.8°, and 66.1° can be well indexed as the (110), (101), (200), (111), (211), (220), (002), (310), (112), and (301) planes of the tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase (PDF no. 41-1445), respectively.42 The four additional distinct peaks at 30.6°, 31.9°, 43.8°, and 44.9° are characteristic of the (200), (101), (220), and (211) crystal planes of the metallic Sn phase (PDF no. 86-2265), respectively. XPS was performed to analyze the surface composition and elemental states of the Sn/SnO2−x hybrid. Clear signals of Sn and O elements are present in the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S3†), which is consistent with the EDX results. As shown in the high-resolution Sn 3d spectrum (Fig. 3b), the two distinct peaks located at 494.5 and 486.1 eV can be attributed to Sn4+ 3d3/2 and Sn4+ 3d5/2 from SnO2, respectively.44,45 There are two additional minor peaks at 493.2 and 484.7 eV assigned to Sn 2d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 of Sn0, respectively, demonstrating the successful formation of metallic Sn.46 Meanwhile, the binding energies of Sn4+ 3d in Sn/SnO2−x show a negative shift of ∼0.2 eV, suggesting the drawing of electrons by the deficient oxygen atoms in the vicinity of Sn.47,48 The high-resolution O 1s spectrum in Fig. 3c can be well deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies centered at 530.4 eV of lattice oxygen (OL),49 531.7 eV of the oxygen vacancy (Ov),50,51 and 533.0 eV of chemisorbed or dissociated oxygen species (Oc),12,52 respectively. The Ov peak may represent the O-atoms in the vicinity of an Ov or the hydroxyl groups bonded to the metal cations in the oxygen deficient region, which makes it difficult to distinguish these two species. The integral-area ratios of the peak at 531.7 eV to the peak at 530.4 eV were calculated to be 0.291 and 0.172 for Sn/SnO2−x and SnO2, respectively, suggesting that Sn/SnO2−x possesses a higher concentration of Ov.53 The presence of Ov was further confirmed by ESR. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the peak-to-peak width of SnO2 and Sn/SnO2−x is 1.0877 mT and 0.5786 mT, respectively. Both samples exhibit an ESR signal at g = 2.002, which is ascribed to paramagnetic oxygen vacancies.23 It is important to note that the drastically stronger signal intensity of Sn/SnO2−x with double integral of the ESR peaks relative to that of pristine SnO2 confirms the higher Ov concentration,54 which is comparable to the XPS peak ratios. Oxygen vacancies are of great significance in enhancing the electronic conductivity of SnO2, providing surface active reaction areas, and promoting the surface catalysis reaction of PEC water oxidation.49,55–58

UV-vis absorption measurements were carried out to investigate the optical characteristics of Sn/SnO2−x. As exhibited in Fig. 4, pure SnO2 nanofibers show a strong response to UV light within the short wavelength region, which is attributed to its wide bandgap.44 In stark contrast, the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure demonstrates strong visible light absorption over the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, which is a typical result of the LSPR effect of Sn metal.38 This favorable plasmonic absorption feature is very similar to that of noble metal Au,25 and is expected to assist in improving the PEC water oxidation performance.

The PEC activity of the photoanodes was investigated in a three-electrode cell containing a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the LSV profiles of the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure and the control sample of pristine SnO2, which are recorded under standard light irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions. The current densities are negligible for both samples under dark conditions, indicating the intrinsically inactive nature. Upon illumination, it is encouraging to note that the photoanode based on the peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x heterostructures displays a photocurrent density of 245 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is almost seven times higher than that of bare SnO2. The significant difference in the current elucidates the effectiveness of hydrogenation treatment in enhancing the PEC water oxidation performance of SnO2.

(d) XRD and (e) high-resolution XPS spectra of Sn 3d after the stability test in Sn/SnO2−x. (f) ABPE plots of SnO2 and Sn/SnO2−x. 
Chronoamperometric i–t plots were constructed to identify the immediate light response ability of Sn/SnO2−x at 1.23 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Sn/SnO2−x photoanode achieves a fast photocurrent response to light switching, manifesting that photo-induced charge separation and transportation are efficiently enhanced. Additionally, the long-term durability of the Sn/SnO2 nanotube peapod photoanode was evaluated at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5c). Sn/SnO2−x demonstrates an enhanced stability compared with pristine SnO2. However, it should be noted that the activity shows a degradation of ∼25% within 60 min, which calls for further improvement of this issue. In addition, a small voltammetric peak is observed at about 0.92 V in the fresh electrode (Fig. 5a), probably due to the initial formation of an oxide layer on the Sn surface. The oxide layer could substantially prevent further oxidation to achieve an enhanced stability of the hybrid structure, which can be confirmed by the disappearance of the voltammetric peak after the stability test (Fig. S4†). It should be pointed out that the faradaic efficiency is not yet able to be confirmed probably due to the extremely small evolution amount of O2 (theoretical value of ∼2.25 μmol cm−2 h−1 when assuming that the faradaic efficiency is 100% at 1.23 VRHE). Hence, it is still not clear if 100% faradaic efficiency is attained before or after the stability test. The result indicates that the PEC performance of Sn/SnO2−x is still unsatisfactory, and further material modification is needed by elaborately controlling the structure and other parameters. Furthermore, to confirm the structural stability, post-mortem analysis was conducted on Sn/SnO2−x after the cycling test. As shown in Fig. 5d and e, the diffraction peaks of metallic Sn and the XPS peaks of the Sn0 state still exist with a relative lower signal intensity, underlining the superior anti-corrosion ability and good stability of Sn/SnO2−x. Finally, the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (η) is determined according to the equation η = I(1.23 − V)/Jlight. Here, I is the obtained photocurrent density, V is the applied potential (V vs. RHE), and Jlight is the light illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G). As displayed in Fig. 5f, the Sn/SnO2−x photoanode exhibits a significantly improved conversion efficiency compared with the bare SnO2 counterpart.
To reveal the inherent mechanism of the enhanced PEC activity, the IPCE of Sn/SnO2−x and pristine SnO2 was calculated at 0.6 VRHE (Fig. 6a). The IPCE curve of Sn/SnO2−x reveals a similar shape to the LSPR absorption spectrum (Fig. 4), displaying a strong correlation between higher IPCE values and the LSPR effect. To confirm the contribution from the plasmonic effect of nonprecious metallic Sn, the photoanodes were measured under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. 6b). Remarkably, Sn/SnO2−x shows an increased photocurrent density of 123 μA cm−2, which accounts for nearly 50% of the total value. The results demonstrate that the LSPR effect of metallic Sn contributes significantly to the PEC water oxidation performance of the Sn/SnO2−x hybrid. Furthermore, the charge transfer kinetics was evaluated by EIS at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE under light illumination. The resulting Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 6c indicate that the Sn/SnO2−x electrode presents a much lower charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/semiconductor interfaces than pristine SnO2. The lower resistance suggests a better charge separation ability and a higher transportation efficiency, which can be attributed to the built-in Schottky junctions and the enhanced electronic conductivity of the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure.59

Based on the above results and discussion, the enhanced mechanism of PEC water oxidation is proposed in Fig. 6d. The electrons in the valence band (EVB) of SnO2 can be excited under light illumination, which, however, is feasible in the ultraviolet region. Encouragingly, the inner metallic Sn particles would provide a strong LSPR effect to visible light, thereby generating a superior light response in the broad UV-vis region for the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure (Fig. 4). The hot electrons generated by LSPR would directly inject into the conduction band (ECB) of SnO2 and further transfer to the current collector immediately. Meanwhile, the energetic holes in the valence band of SnO2 and metallic Sn move to the surface for catalyzing water oxidation.32 In addition, the unique hollow structure could extend the photo pathways by light scattering to yield a better light harvest.60,61 Moreover, the built-in Schottky junction could promote charge separation and the oxygen vacancies in SnO2−x are favorable for accelerating the surface catalytic reaction kinetics. As a consequence, the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructure yields a significantly enhanced PEC water oxidation performance compared with pristine SnO2.
4. Conclusion
In summary, peapod-like Sn/SnO2−x heterostructures have been successfully fabricated by facile electrospinning in combination with hydrogenation treatment. The inner metallic Sn particles are demonstrated to generate a strong plasmonic effect, enabling effective UV-vis light harvesting for Sn/SnO2−x. In addition, the Sn/SnO2−x heterostructures provide built-in Schottky junctions for efficient charge separation, porous architecture for fast electrolyte diffusion, and rich oxygen vacancies for sufficient active sites. When used as the photoanode for PEC water oxidation, an improved current density of 245 μA cm−2 is achieved, which is seven times higher than that of pristine SnO2. The present work would open up new opportunities for developing nonprecious metallic Sn with a plasmonic effect for more solar energy-related applications.
