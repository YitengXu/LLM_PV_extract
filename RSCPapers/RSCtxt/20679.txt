    , Accepted 19th March 2017First published on 20th March 2017AbstractThe successful application of supercapacitors in energy conversion and storage hinges on the development of highly efficient and stable electrode materials. Herein, a composite of manganese oxide (MnO2) and N-doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCSs) was fabricated by a facile two-step process for supercapacitor electrodes. The MnO2–NHCS composite had a NHCS core and a shell composed of hierarchical birnessite-type MnO2 nanoflakes. The NHCSs in the composite serve not only as the template for the growth of MnO2 nanoflakes, but also as the electrically conductive channel for electrochemical performance enhancement. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the MnO2–NHCS composite were significantly enhanced as compared with those of MnO2 hollow spheres (MnO2 HSs). The asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) assembled with MnO2–NHCS anodes and NHCS cathodes exhibited a high energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 233 W kg−1, which is superior to those of the ASCs assembled with MnO2 HS anodes and NHCS cathodes (13.5 W h kg−1 at 229 W kg−1). The MnO2–NHCS ASCs also show superior cycling stability for 4000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the MnO2–NHCSs makes them a promising electrode material for application in supercapacitors and potentially other energy storage devices.
Introduction
With the potential exhaustion of fossil fuels and the serious environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel use,1–3 there is an urgent need to develop clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energies, along with advanced technologies for energy storage.4–9 Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also known as supercapacitors,10–12 with large power density and distinguished cycling performance play a promising role in energy conversion and storage devices,13 which can help to meet the ever-growing energy demand and alleviate environmental stress on the planet.
The development of eco-friendly electrode materials for supercapacitors with high energy density presents great challenges for practical applications. Supercapacitors can deliver a high power density for a few seconds.8,14 However, supercapacitors using commercial activated carbon as the electrode material suffer from limited energy density, which is much lower than that of batteries. The energy density of supercapacitors is closely related to the operating cell voltage and the specific capacitance. Therefore, two strategies can be considered to boost the energy density of supercapacitors, i.e., enhancing the specific capacitance of materials and broadening the operating voltage range.
Transition metal oxides have attracted widespread attention as alternative electrode materials, as their specific capacitance is usually 2 to 3 times higher than that of carbon/graphite electrode materials.15,16 Among these transition metal oxides, manganese oxide (MnO2) is considered as a promising supercapacitor electrode material candidate, owing to its low price, environmental friendliness, and high specific capacitance.17–19 More specifically, compared to other transition metal oxide materials, such as ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2), nickel(II) oxide (NiO) and cobalt (II, III) oxide (Co3O4), that are usually tested in strongly acidic or alkaline electrolytes, a wide potential window can be obtained for MnO2 electrodes in neutral aqueous electrolytes.20 Pure MnO2 with different morphologies have been synthesized and studied, such as nanorods,21 nanowires,22 nanoflowers,23 hollow spheres (HSs),24 and nanotubes.25 However, the low electrical conductivity of pure MnO2 limits its practical performance,26 and thus introducing conductive carbon substrates into MnO2 composites has become an effective solution to this issue.27–31 For example, Zheng and co-workers32 synthesized a graphene–MnO2 nanoflower composite and fabricated it into a symmetric device, which exhibited a high specific capacitance of 320.6 F g−1 and delivered a maximum energy density of 5.67 W h kg−1 in the voltage window of 0–1.0 V.
Another effective approach to enhancing the energy density is to increase the operating voltage window by constructing an asymmetric device, which is composed of a battery-type faradaic electrode and a capacitor-type electrode.33–37 Recently, a great deal of effort has been made in assembling asymmetric devices of carbon-based MnO2 electrodes and carbon electrodes.38–41 For instance, Lei et al.42 reported the growth of MnO2 nanofibers on graphite hollow carbon spheres (GHCSs) for a pseudocapacitor, which showed a high specific capacitance of 280 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Asymmetric devices were fabricated using this MnO2/GHCS composite as the anode and activated carbon as the cathode, which achieved an energy density of 22.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 100 W kg−1 with a cell voltage of 0–2 V. These results suggest that the synthesis of carbon-based MnO2 composites and fabrication of asymmetric devices can greatly enhance the energy density of practical supercapacitors.
Herein, we demonstrated that ultrathin MnO2 nanoflakes were successfully grown on the surface of N-doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCSs) by redox reaction between NHCSs and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in aqueous solution, where NHCSs also served as a substrate for the growth of MnO2 nanoflakes. Hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) as the electrode material have been attracting wide attention due to their large surface area, shortened ion diffusion paths and high conductivity. However, most of the HCSs, which usually have a disordered carbon structure, have a low capacitance in aqueous electrolytes. The incorporation of surface functional groups, such as O-, N-, and S-containing functional groups, is a useful method to enhance capacitive performance of carbon materials.43,44 In this work, NHCSs were fabricated by a facile one-step synthesis approach with dopamine as the carbon and nitrogen source and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a structure-directing agent. Moreover, an asymmetric cell was fabricated using the MnO2–NHCS composite as the anode and the NHCSs as the cathode, which exhibited much higher energy density than the asymmetric device composed of MnO2 HSs and NHCSs (MnO2 HS//NHCS) or the symmetric devices (NHCS//NHCS, MnO2 HS//MnO2 HS and MnO2–NHCS//MnO2–NHCS).
Experimental
Synthesis of the NHCSs
The NHCSs were prepared by a one-step synthesis method reported previously.45 Briefly, a mixture containing 1 mL of ammonia (25%), 24 mL of anhydrous ethanol and 80 mL of purified water was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h. One milliliter of TEOS was added into the mixture dropwise, and the stirring continued for an additional 15 min. Subsequently, 8 mL of dopamine hydrochloride (DA) aqueous solution (50 mg mL−1) was added dropwise into the above solution, which was kept stirring for 36 h. Brown SiO2@polydopamine (SiO2@PDA) spheres were obtained after centrifugation and washing with purified water three times. The brown material was dried at 60 °C and then calcined at 800 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. After etching with 10 wt% HF solution to remove the SiO2 core, the NHCSs were obtained.
Growth of MnO2 nanoflakes on the NHCSs
The MnO2–NHCSs were fabricated by introducing the NHCSs as a non-sacrificial hard template through a simple hydrothermal method as follows. First, 20 mg of the NHCSs was dispersed in 40 mL of 20 mM KMnO4 aqueous solution by sonication for 30 min. Then the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 140 °C for 2 h. MnO2–NHCS nanospheres were collected after centrifugation and washing with purified water. For comparison with the MnO2–NHCSs, MnO2 HSs were fabricated by employing SiO2 spheres as a sacrificial hard template via a simple hydrothermal method. Briefly, 0.2 g of SiO2 nanospheres46 were dispersed in 40 mL of 20 mM KMnO4 aqueous solution and maintained at 140 °C for 40 h. After washing with water and drying at 60 °C overnight, the as-prepared MnO2/SiO2 spheres were dispersed in 2 M NaOH solution and stirred for 12 h to dissolve the SiO2 core and obtain the MnO2 HSs.
Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The microstructures were characterized on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7500), transmission electron microscope (TEM, Titan G2) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM, Titan G2). Nitrogen sorption measurement was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 electron-energy spectrometer. Raman scattering analysis was performed using a Renishaw Raman microscope under λexc = 633 nm laser excitation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to determine the loading ratio of MnO2 on the NHCS using a Shimadzu DTG-60 instrument.
Electrochemical characterization
To make the working electrodes, a mixture of the as-prepared materials, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to prepare a slurry, which was brushed onto graphite paper and air-dried at 80 °C overnight. The mass loading of the active material for every electrode was about 1 mg cm−2. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A three-electrode cell configuration was used in these tests, with a platinum foil and Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) electrode as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
Fabrication and evaluation of the asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs)
ASCs were prepared by assembling the MnO2–NHCSs or MnO2 HSs as the anode and the NHCSs as the cathode with a glassy fibrous separator in a 2032 button cell, which were then investigated in a two-electrode configuration in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As with the individual electrodes, CV, GCD and EIS were also performed on a CHI 760E instrument. Cycle life measurement was performed on a battery testing system (LANHE CT2001A).
Results and discussion
Morphology, porosity and surface chemistry of the NHCSs
The morphology of the NHCSs was observed by FESEM and TEM (Fig. 1). Using uniform and monodisperse SiO2@PDA spheres with a diameter of approximately 360 nm on average (Fig. S1a†), spherical NHCSs with an average size of 300 nm were obtained (Fig. 1a). The broken sphere in Fig. 1a is indicative of the hollow structure. The decrease in diameter is mainly caused by the pyrolysis and carbonization of the shell of SiO2@PDA spheres and the shrinkage of the carbon shell after etching the SiO2 core with 10 wt% HF solution. Consistent with the FESEM images, the TEM images (Fig. 1b and c) further confirm the hollow interior structure of these carbon spheres, and the thickness of the thin shell is identified to be approximately 20 nm.
 Fig. 1  FESEM (a) and TEM (b and c) images of the NHCSs. (d) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the NHCSs and the inset exhibiting the pore size distribution. 
As shown in Fig. 1d, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the NHCSs can be classified as Type IV with a hysteresis loop of Type H2, characteristic of interconnected ink-bottle type mesopores.47,48 On the other hand, the high N2 adsorption at very low relative pressure (P/P0), which resembles a Type I adsorption isotherm, is attributed to the micropores within the carbon shells. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1d, the NHCSs exhibit a wide pore distribution from micropores to macropores, further confirming the hierarchical porous structure of this carbon material. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) and the pore volume of the NHCSs are 1271 m2 g−1 and 1.64 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table S1†). The hierarchical porous structure of the NHCSs with a large specific surface area and pore volume would not only accelerate the penetration and transfer of electrolyte ions within the electrode materials,49 but also increase the accumulation of electrical charges on the interface between the electrode material and electrolyte.
XPS was used to analyze the surface chemistry of the NHCSs. Fig. S2a† is the survey spectrum of the NHCSs, where three peaks are assigned to C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, demonstrating that nitrogen is incorporated into the carbon material. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s (Fig. S2c†) can be fitted into four peaks, which correspond to different N-containing functional groups: pyridinic-N (398.5 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.9 eV), quaternary-N (401.0 eV), and oxidized pyridinic-N (403.2 eV).
Growth mechanism and characterization of the MnO2–NHCSs
The growth mechanism of the MnO2–NHCS nanoarchitecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. Firstly, TEOS and DA can hydrolyze and polymerize to SiO2 and polydopamine (PDA) in ammonia solution, forming the core–shell structure of SiO2@PDA in which SiO2 and PDA are the core and shell, respectively. Then the NHCSs can be obtained after carbonization of PDA and etching of SiO2. Secondly, MnO2 nanoflakes were grown on the surface of the NHCSs. There are two main processes occurring during the MnO2 growth process: redox reaction between the NHCSs and KMnO4 (eqn (1)) and deposition of MnO2via the decomposition of KMnO4 (eqn (2)). 4MnO4− + 3C + H2O → 4MnO2 + CO32− + 2HCO3−(1) 4MnO4− + 2H2O → 4MnO2 + 4OH− + 3O2(2)
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of the MnO2–NHCS nanocomposite. 
The precipitation of nanocrystalline MnO2 on the surface of the NHCS substrate occurs first during the slow redox reaction, which leads to an enhanced interaction between the supported MnO2 and carbon templates, thus resulting in a low equivalent series resistance of the nanocomposite electrodes.19,29,42 Followed by the coating of the NHCS surface with MnO2 nanocrystallites, which could serve as nucleation sites, the decomposition of KMnO4 becomes faster than the redox reaction. Then a flaky morphology will be formed with the deposition of MnO2 along the ab plane of the layered birnessite-type MnO2.50 Through this hydrothermal method, MnO2 nanosheets supported on NHCSs can be facilely obtained.
The morphologies of the MnO2–NHCS composites and the MnO2 HSs are investigated by FESEM and TEM. The MnO2–NHCS nanospheres with a uniform diameter of 440 nm exhibit a flower-like structure assembled by numerous ultrathin MnO2 nanoflakes (Fig. 3a and b), while the shells of the MnO2 HSs also consist of packed nanoparticles or crystallites (Fig. 3c). In addition, some broken spheres were observed for the MnO2 HSs (Fig. 3d), but were rarely observed for the MnO2–NHCSs, owing to the improved structural stability of the NHCS substrate. The TEM images (Fig. 4a and b) reveal the hollow structure of the MnO2–NHCS nanocomposite with a diameter of 440 nm and a shell thickness of about 60 nm, while the corresponding dimensions of the MnO2 HSs are 400 nm and 30 nm (Fig. 4c and d). This is because the NHCS substrate could facilitate the growth of MnO2 nanosheets, which then results in a thicker shell for the MnO2–NHCS nanocomposite than for the MnO2 HSs. It is clearly seen from Fig. 4b that the MnO2 nanosheets are vertically assembled on the surface of the NHCSs. This architecture is beneficial for the penetration of electrolyte ions from the bulk solution outside to the interior of the MnO2–NHCSs. The thickness of the MnO2 nanosheets is about 5.5 nm (Fig. S3†), and these ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets could provide sufficient active sites for faradaic redox reactions. Fig. 4e and f are the HAADF-STEM image and the elemental mapping images of the MnO2–NHCSs, which show that Mn and O are uniformly dispersed on the shell, while C and N are slightly more enriched in the inner region, indicating the existence of the NHCSs.

The crystal phase of the as-synthesized materials was characterized by XRD (Fig. 5a) and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 5b). For the NHCS sample, the broad X-ray diffraction peak located at about 25° corresponds to the (002) plane, reflecting the presence of highly graphitized carbon.51 The four characteristic peaks of both MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs at 12°, 25°, 37°, and 66° are assigned to birnessite-type MnO2 (JCPDS 42-1317),52–55 and the broadened peaks indicate the low crystallinity of the MnO2. The (002) peak of the MnO2–NHCSs at 26° is broader than that of the MnO2 HSs, due to overlap with the corresponding peak of the NHCS substrate.

The Raman spectra of the NHCS and MnO2–NHCS composites are shown in Fig. 5b. The three Raman bands appearing at 1345 cm−1 (D band), 1595 cm−1 (G band) and 2645 cm−1 (2D band) can be observed for the pristine NHCSs. The D band and 2D band are the defect band and the overtone of the D band ascribed to the disordered carbon, while the G band is the E2g mode corresponding to the graphitic carbon. After the growth of MnO2 on the NHCSs, the intensity ratio between the D and G bands increased from 1.0 to 1.1, reflecting an increased amount of defects resulting from the redox reaction between KMnO4 and the carbon template. In the low wavenumber region, three weak peaks appearing at 504, 573 and 640 cm−1 were observed for the MnO2–NHCSs, which are assigned to birnessite-type MnO2 (ref. 56 and 57) and are in accordance with the XRD results.
The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 5c) further proves the presence of Mn, C, N and O elements on the surface of the MnO2–NHCSs, though the N 1s peak was not obvious due to the thick MnO2 layer. The high-resolution Mn 2p spectrum (Fig. 5d) exhibits two peaks at 642.2 and 653.7 eV, which can be ascribed to the binding energy of Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2, respectively.58 The spin-energy separation of 11.5 eV implies that the oxidation state of Mn is +4. From the TGA curves of the MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs (Fig. S4†), it can be calculated that the content of NHCSs in the MnO2–NHCS composite is about 8%.
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of both MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs are Type IV (Fig. S5†), with Type H3 hysteresis loops, which are ascribed to slit-like mesopores formed by the assembly of the MnO2 nanoflakes.47 As shown in Table S1,† the SBET of the MnO2–NHCSs (158.4 m2 g−1) is higher than that of the MnO2 HSs (119 m2 g−1), which is mainly caused by the existence of hollow carbon cores. The BJH pore size distributions of the MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs (inset of Fig. S5†) show wide pore size distributions, further proving the existence of a hierarchical pore structure, which consists of mesopores in the layered MnO2 shell and macropores in the hollow cavities.59
Electrochemical performance of the NHCS, MnO2–NHCS and MnO2 HS electrodes
The CV curves of the NHCSs exhibited a rectangular shape with a wide potential range of −0.9 to 0 V, at scan rates even up to 200 mV s−1 (Fig. S6a†). No reversible faradaic peaks were observed in the CV curves, demonstrating that electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) is the dominant capacitive behavior of the NHCSs. The change in the specific capacitance of the NHCSs with the scan rate is shown in Fig. S6b.† The NHCSs exhibited a high capacitance of 310 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which decreased with increasing scan rate but still remained at 134 F g−1 at 200 mV s−1, indicating the excellent rate capacity of the NHCS electrode. The high specific capacitance and extraordinary rate capacity suggest that the NHCSs can serve as an appealing electrode material for supercapacitors.
The CV curves of the MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 also possessed a rectangle-like shape without apparent redox peaks (Fig. 6a), revealing the fast and reversible faradaic reactions between MnO2 nanoflakes and the electrolyte. The integrated area of the MnO2–NHCS CV curve was obviously larger than that of the MnO2 HS curve, indicating that the MnO2–NHCS composite has higher capacitance than the MnO2 HSs. Similar trends were observed at other scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S7a and c†). This difference is mainly caused by the larger SBET of the MnO2–NHCSs and the hollow carbon core. Fig. 6b compares the GCD curve of the MnO2–NHCSs with that of the MnO2 HSs at a current density of 1 A g−1; the comparison of their GCD curves at various current densities is shown in Fig. S7b and d.† Obviously, the charge/discharge time of the MnO2–NHCSs was much longer than that of the MnO2 HSs, suggesting the higher specific capacitance of the MnO2–NHCSs. Moreover, the iR drop of the MnO2–NHCSs was smaller than that of the MnO2 HSs, demonstrating a fast I–V response and outstanding pseudocapacitance reversibility.
 Fig. 6  (a) CV curves, (b) GCD curves and (c) specific capacitance of the MnO2–NHCSs and MnO2 HSs in a three-electrode configuration. The CV curves were measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1; the GCD curves measured at a current density of 1 A g−1. 

Fig. 6c compares the specific capacitance of the MnO2–NHCS composite with that of the MnO2 HSs at different current densities. The specific capacitance of the MnO2–NHCS composite at 0.5 A g−1 was as high as 392 F g−1, and even remained at 222 F g−1 at 10 A g−1. In contrast, the pure MnO2 HSs show poor capacitance properties (249 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 70 F g−1 at 10 A g−1). On the one hand, ultrathin MnO2 nanoflakes supported on the surface of NHCSs with a large active surface area are beneficial for the fast redox reaction. On the other hand, NHCSs with high electric conductivity as the hollow core can accelerate electron transport, which is closely related to the good rate capacity of the material.
Electrochemical performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)
Considering the high specific capacitance and outstanding rate performance of the MnO2–NHCSs and NHCSs, an ASC was assembled with the MnO2–NHCSs and NHCSs as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively (Fig. 7a). Stable CV curves were obtained in the potential windows of −0.9 to 0 V for the NHCSs with ideal EDLC behaviors and from −0.1 to 0.9 V for the MnO2–NHCS composite with faradaic behaviors (Fig. 7b). To better optimize the electrochemical performance of the ASC, the optimal mass ratio between the MnO2–NHCSs and NHCSs was calculated to be 1:1 based on the charge balance theory (eqn S3 and S4 in the ESI†), while the ratio was 1.5:1 for the MnO2 HSs and NHCSs, because of the low specific capacitance of the MnO2 HS electrode (Fig. S8a†).

(b) CV curves of the NHCS and MnO2–NHCS electrodes tested in a three-electrode system with 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. (c) CV curves and (d) GCD curves of the as-assembled ASC device measured at different voltage windows. 

Fig. 7c demonstrates the CV curves of the NHCS//MnO2–NHCS ASCs at various operating voltages at 20 mV s−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The CV curves showed ideal capacitive behavior with rectangular shapes, even in voltage windows up to 1.8 V, indicating that the operating voltage of the ASCs could be extended to 1.8 V in aqueous electrolytes. It should be noted that gaseous emission at the cathode was observed at an operating voltage of 2.0 V, which is not conducive to the stability and safety of the ASCs. The GCD curves of the ASCs at 1 A g−1 with different voltage windows are shown in Fig. 7d. The symmetric shapes were well maintained in the GCD curves while the operating voltage went up to 1.8 V, further confirming that the ASCs can be operated in the voltage window from 0 to 1.8 V.

Fig. 8a shows the CV curves of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS ASC at various scan rates in the voltage range of 1–1.8 V in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. These CV curves displayed rectangular shapes, implying the fast charge/discharge performance of the prepared MnO2–NHCSs in the ASC. No obvious redox peaks in the CV curves can be detected, in virtue of the good match between the fast electrosorption of Na+ cations on the surface of the NHCS active material and the quick reversible pseudocapacitance reaction on the MnO2–NHCSs.60 In Fig. 8b, the GCD curves of the NHCS//MnO2–NHCS ASC at applied current density from 0.5 to 4 A g−1 show nearly a linear variation indicating their capacitor-like behavior. Based on the GCD curves of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS ASC (Fig. 8b) and MnO2 HS//NHCS ASC (Fig. S8d†), the calculated total specific capacitance of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS ASC reached a maximum of 59.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and remained at 22 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 8c), which is almost twice as large as that of the MnO2 HS//NHCS ASC (i.e., 29 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 9 F g−1 at 5 A g−1).

(d) Electrochemical impedance spectra of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS and MnO2 HS//NHCS ASCs. 
The inset of Fig. 8d shows the Nyquist plots of the two ASCs, both of which consist of a quasi-semicircle in the high frequency region and a linear curve in the low frequency region, representing charge-transfer resistance and capacitive behavior,61 respectively. The charge-transfer resistance of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS ASC is much smaller than that of the MnO2 HS//NHCS ASC, because the existence of the carbon core in the composite can facilitate electron transfer. Other parameters of EIS, such as equivalent series resistance and Warburg impedance, are similar between the two ASCs, due to the same configuration in terms of the electrolyte, current collector and negative electrode material.
To further explore the electrochemical properties of the ASCs, their power density and energy density have been calculated from the GCD curves at various current densities based on eqn S5–S7.†Fig. 9a shows the Ragone plots of the ASCs and symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) consisting of the three different electrode materials (i.e., MnO2–NHCSs, MnO2 HSs and NHCSs). The energy densities of the ASCs are much larger than those of the SCs at the same current density, mainly owing to the wide operating voltage window of the ASCs. Among these supercapacitors, the MnO2–NHCS ASC delivered the highest energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 233 W kg−1 and maintained an energy density of 9.6 W h kg−1 at 5824 W kg−1. The energy density of the MnO2 HS//NHCS ASC (i.e., 13.5 W h kg−1 at 229 W kg−1) was higher than those of the other supercapacitors, including MnO2–NHCS//MnO2–NHCS (5.6 W h kg−1 at 262 W kg−1), NHCS//NHCS (4.3 W h kg−1 at 256 W kg−1), and MnO2 HS//MnO2 HS (3.8 W h kg−1 at 139 W kg−1).

The stability of the MnO2–NHCS//NHCS ASC was characterized by using GCD cycles at 1 A g−1 with a voltage window of 0–1.8 V (Fig. 9b). The total capacitance of the ASC remained constant for the initial 1000 cycles, and then showed a slight decline with increasing cycle number. However, the capacitance retention ratio of the MnO2–NHCS ASC was still maintained at 95.2% after 4000 cycles, exhibiting an outstanding long-cycling life. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of the MnO2–NHCS ASC retains about 100% after up to 4000 cycles, indicating a greatly reversible redox reaction between MnO2 nanoflakes and the electrolyte.
The excellent performance of the ASCs should be attributed to the unique architecture of the MnO2–NHCS nanocomposite: (a) the NHCS core not only increases the electrical conductivity of the composite which benefits fast electron transfer during charge/discharge processes, but could preserve the structural integrity which favors the cycling stability performance. (b) The MnO2 hierarchical shells with numerous nanoflakes provide abundant electroactive sites for electrochemical reactions, leading to the efficient utilization of active materials.62–64 (c) The hollow interiors could serve as an ion reservoir, thus shortening the diffusion path of the electrolyte and providing enough ions for faradaic reactions at high rates.65,66
Conclusions
A MnO2–NHCS composite with a NHCS core and porous MnO2 shell has been successfully fabricated and shows excellent electrochemical performance. This core–shell MnO2–NHCS composite delivered a specific capacitance of 392 F g−1 (at 0.5 A g−1), which is almost 1.6 times higher than that of MnO2 HSs. The ASC assembled with NHCSs and MnO2–NHCSs in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte could be operated in a wide voltage window from 0 to 1.8 V, delivering a high energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 233 W kg−1. Moreover, the ASC exhibited a superior cycle stability with minimal capacitance drop (4.8%) and 100% coulombic efficiency after 4000 cycles. This unique hierarchical material with outstanding capacitive properties has great potential for energy conversion and storage applications.
