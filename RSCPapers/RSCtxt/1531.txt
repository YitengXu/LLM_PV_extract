    , Accepted 5th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have attracted tremendous attention for solar cell application due to their outstanding properties. However, further studies are still needed to fully address the carrier recombination issue at grain boundaries which lowers the device performance, and its environmental stability issues. Fluoride additive engineering is found to be a good method to successfully passivate defects in perovskite films. Here, we developed a simple method to improve the device power conversion efficiency as well as its environmental stability, by introducing the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) additive within the perovskite organic precursor in a two-step deposition method. The built-in electric field effect induced by PTFE induces the migration of photo-generated carriers, suppressing the electron–hole recombination, thus improving the short circuit current and then the photovoltaic performance. We obtained a maximum efficiency of 20.48% for PTFE 5%-based PSCs compared to the pristine one which was only 14.27%. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the PTFE-based PSC device exhibits strong environmental stability. The device presented only 5% PCE loss over 42 days of storage in an ambient environment.
1. Introduction
Due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties such as a high absorption coefficient, ideal bandgap energy of ∼1.5 eV, good tolerance to defects, high carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion length,1–5 hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells are drawing more and more attention. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells has increasingly jumped from 3.8% (ref. 6) to 25.2% (ref. 7) in the past decennia. The short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit potential (Voc) and fill factor (FF) acquired under different operating conditions are the values that characterize the device performance. They are compared to their corresponding theoretical maximums calculated from the Shockley–Queisser limit,8 which only presents a radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a single bandgap semiconductor.9 It is also well known that interface recombination and non-radiative recombination resulting from trap states or defects from poor film quality are mainly responsible for carriers' mobility limitation, leading to the reduction of electrical properties.10,11 It is therefore crucial to develop some techniques to improve the separation and collection of photo-generated carriers to improve the short-circuit current density (Jsc), which may consequently improve the device performance as already reported in previous research.12–14
Furthermore, despite the rapid increase of their PCE, perovskite solar cells still need considerable development due to their low stability in ambient environments, especially when exposed to light and humidity,15–17 which remain their main challenges. Currently, numerous studies are conducted to develop methods for PSC performance and stability improvement,18–22 including film encapsulation methods, optimization of material components, and film morphology control.23,24 However, the use of additives is broadly spread, and plays an important role in many PSC performance breakthroughs. These additives not only enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, but also reduce or eliminate the hysteresis, improving at the same time the stability of the devices.25–28 Different types of additives which are principally derived from the excellent combination capability of lead cations and iodide anions in halide perovskites can be used for PSC device fabrication. Among them are polymers, molecules, salts, and even nanoparticles,28–32 and their use for device fabrication may vary from each other. Some additives are added into the precursor anteriorly to the film preparation and some are added after its processing. Polymer additives have the advantage of possessing heterogeneous nuclei which can be used to modulate the morphology of halide perovskites, leading to a larger grain size.28 Moreover, they have been demonstrated to improve the perovskite solar cells' moisture stability due to their hydrophobic functions. For instance, in 2016, Zhao et al.33 used a hygroscopic PEG scaffold to stabilize the perovskite film and showed self-healing performance. Their un-encapsulated devices maintained a high output for up to 300 h in a highly humid environment (70% relative humidity). Other polymers such as multifunctional fluoropolymers have been confirmed to obtain considerably higher stability in PSCs without weakening the initial PCE.34 Indeed, Sun et al.35 first used a ferroelectric fluoropolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride)-trifluoroethyl (PVDF-TrFE) copolymer as an additive to MAPbI3 with the configuration TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Ag in a glove box, achieving a PCE of 12.5%, whereas Hwang's team36 first introduced the concept of hydrophobic passivation using a hydrophobic fluoropolymer named polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) deposited on the top of the perovskite solar cell by a spin-coating method. This hydrophobic passivation exhibited negligible degradation of the device after 30 days' storage in an ambient atmosphere.
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is essentially composed of –CF2− groups (Fig. 1). These highly polarized C–F bonds endow this polymer with outstanding chemical properties such as, a high specific surface area, high chemical resistance in harsh environments, high thermal stability, resistance to ultraviolet rays, excellent outdoor weather stability, low water adsorption (0.04% at room temperature), and low flammability (limiting oxygen index is 95%) to list a few. These exceptional properties make PTFE an excellent candidate for the stability improvement of perovskite solar cells. Yet, under heat or over long periods of exposure PTFE is still sensitive to electrophilic aggression which can lead to a loss of fluorine. Alkali metals such as cesium, sodium, lithium, and potassium, which are very reactive elements, could best induce this electrophilic attack.37,38

Herein, we develop an easy and efficient process to improve the built-in electric field effect in perovskite films. Indeed, by introducing the PTFE additive into the organic perovskite precursor via a two step deposition method for a planar structure of ITO/SnO2/HC(NH2)2–CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, we greatly improved our PSC performance parameters such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE. As a result, we obtained a champion PCE of 20.48% for the optimized PTFE-based device. Moreover, our device exhibits an excellent ambient air and photostability.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 depicts the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of perovskite films with and without PTFE at different volume ratios, and PTFE particles, which allows the examination of the morphology evolution of the obtained film after the use of the PTFE additive.

It is apparent from Fig. 2 that the perovskite film fabricated with integrated PTFE presents a compact morphology with a larger grain size and reduced pinholes (Fig. 2b–f), compared to pristine one (Fig. 2a). Based on previous reports, the large crystalline grains size could positively impact the device photovoltaic performances.39 Indeed, soft surface perovskite films with good coverage have been reported to reduce the shunt pathways between the ETL and HTL,40,41 and to enhance the contact between the perovskite layer and carrier layers.42 Moreover, it is noticed that the distribution of grains is influenced. With the increase of the PTFE additive volume ratio, the microstructure of the crystal appears to be coated with an external layer following PTFE particle distribution (Fig. 2g and h). The fluorinated elements are deposited on the perovskite surface as seen on all the microstructure images (Fig. 2b–f), which likely increase the device ambient air stability.
The effect of the PTFE additive on the perovskite-film crystal growth is surveyed via XRD diffraction measurement and presented in Fig. 3a. We found that identical diffraction peaks are observed for all films (with and without the PTFE additive). The (110), (202), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of FAMAPbI3 are detected at 14.1°, 24.5°, 28.2°,31.6°, 40.4°, and 42.9° respectively, corresponding to the FAMAPbI3 tetragonal phase,43 whereas the PbI2 peak is identified at 12.7° (ref. 44) which indicates unreacted PbI2.19 Some researchers have pointed out the importance of excess PbI2 in photovoltaic parameter improvement, even if it does not influence the device stability.45,46 Noteworthily, this peak intensity is progressively decreased with the increase of the PTFE volume ratio, indicating a more complete formation of the perovskite phase. The observation of these same diffraction patterns suggests that the PTFE additive is not entrenched in the perovskite crystal lattice and remains on the perovskite surface or grain boundaries.30,47 Moreover, from the half-height width of the perovskite film X-ray peak at 24.5° presented in Fig. 3b, we noticed that the increase of the PTFE volume ratio leads to a gradual decrease of FWHM, which implies an increase of the perovskite film crystallite size based on Scherrer's formula as presented in eqn (1): (1)where D is the crystallite size, K the Scherrer constant (0.9), λ the wavelength of the X-ray source, β the FWHM (radians), and θ the Bragg angle (radians).48,49 These results further confirmed that the PTFE additive positively impacts the perovskite film morphology as demonstrated by SEM results.

We also investigated the effect of the PTFE additive on perovskite film optical properties. Fig. 4a presents the UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films at different volume ratios. As shown in this figure, all perovskite films present the same stronger absorption intensities at a lower wavelength and stronger absorption intensities at a higher wavelength, where the increase of light scattering could explain this absorption decrease.50 Besides, it can also be observed that all PTFE-based films present approximatively the same optical absorption intensity between 500 and 550 nm wavelengths. We can therefore assume that the PTFE additive has no apparent effect on perovskite film absorption.

We monitored the steady photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films with PTFE treatment at different volume ratios to evaluate the charge recombination behavior. As presented in Fig. 4b, all peaks were centered around 800 nm which is close to the perovskite film bandgap energy of 1.55 eV, in accordance with the results of the absorption edge in UV spectra. Furthermore, the perovskite film treated with PTFE at a 5% volume ratio presents the highest PL intensity corresponding to a 10% increase of the integral area compared to the pristine one. This result indicates that non-radiative recombination defects in the perovskite layer have been largely reduced or suppressed.
To further study the effects of the PTFE additive on our perovskite solar cell devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the dark in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 106 Hz. Fig. 5 presents the Nyquist plots of PSCs with and without the PTFE additive, where one semicircle represents the recombination resistance based on previous research.51,52 The inset image illustrates the equivalent circuit where R1 is attributed to the internal resistance, R2 to the transfer resistance acquired from the first arc in the high-frequency region, and R3 resulted from the second arc corresponding to recombination resistance.53 The electron transfers at the interface between the HTM and perovskite layer explain well the recombination resistance.51 Interestingly, it is noticed that up to a 15% volume ratio, all PTFE-based PSCs exhibit higher ending resistance of the semicircles, compared to the pristine one, which suggests that the PTFE additive induces less recombination.

By using Z-view software, we also calculated the impedance fitting data of hybrid perovskite solar cells without and with the PTFE additive at different volume ratios (Table 1). We reported that except for the PTFE 20% PSC, all the PTFE-based PSCs present higher recombination resistance, confirming therefore that PTFE induces less carrier recombination in the device.44 This might be explained by the quality improvement of crystallization resulting in a perovskite film with few defects when using the PTFE additive. It is also interesting to note that the PTFE-based PSCs present a longer lifetime compared to the pristine one which may induce lower recombination at interfaces leading to an increase of device power efficiency.

The photovoltaic properties of the devices were characterized in a planar structure of ITO/SnO2/HC(NH2)2–CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 6a). The variation of the PTFE additive volume ratio has been found to greatly influence the performance of the devices. Fig. 7a illustrates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices with and without the PTFE additive at different volume ratios and measured under standard solar simulated light illumination (AM 1.5).

The performance parameters including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 7b. Herein, the perovskite devices fabricated without the PTFE additive were used as the control. For the control device, the obtained PCE was 14.27% with a Voc of 1.02 V, Jsc of 21.63 mA cm−2, and FF of 64.45%. By changing the volume ratio of the PTFE additive, we noticed that all PSC device performances were improved. However, the best performance of 20.48% PCE was achieved upon the addition of 5% PTFE, suggesting the optimum ratio in the perovskite layer, with a Voc of 1.06 V, Jsc of 24.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.94%. From Fig. 7b, there is an observation of a gradual increase of Voc with the increase of the PTFE volume ratio up to a maximum of 1.1 V at PTFE 10%. This open-circuit voltage enhancement is attributed to the gradual increase of the built-in electric field effect induced by the PTFE additive, which leads to a generation and collection of a high density of electrons at the ETL and perovskite layer interface. We can also observe the same evolution for the short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE which exhibit their highest values at 5% PTFE, followed by a decrease but still higher compared to the pristine ones. The considerable PCE improvement of ∼43% is surely attributed to the increase of all device parameters including the Voc, Jsc; and FF. We, therefore assume that the increase of the PCE should be correlated with the high electronegativity of PTFE in perovskite films and the suppressed non-radiative recombination. Indeed, when the perovskite material is exposed to light, there is an improvement of the built-in electric field induced by the PTFE additive, due to its high electronegativity which causes the good migration of photo-generated carriers, reducing recombination effects, and increasing then the device efficiency as well (Fig. 6b). This explanation corroborates well with previous reports that have already demonstrated the great influence of the built-in electric field on solar cell efficiency improvement.54 Yet, the decrease of photovoltaic parameters from 5% PTFE might be the result of thicker deposition of the polymer additive following the increase of the PTFE concentration, which inhibits the transmission of carriers from the perovskite film to the hole transport layer.55 Thus, we can conclude that excess PTFE will hinder the carrier transport and reduce the photovoltaic performance.

To verify the Jsc value obtained from the J–V test, we determined the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized PTFE-based perovskite device with monochromatic light over a wavelength range between 300 and 850 nm as illustrated in Fig. 7c. The EQE of the device exceeds 95%, and the integrated current density is 23.65 mA cm−2, which nearly corresponds to ∼3% mismatch to the value obtained from the measurement with a solar simulator as previously mentioned.
We further study the device long-term stability in an ambient environment as shown in Fig. 8a. In previous research, it was reported that GBs play a crucial role in perovskite film decomposition when placed in a humid environment. Indeed, it has been proven that perovskite degradation is accelerated due to moisture infiltration through GBs.56 When placed in an ambient environment without any encapsulation, we noticed that the PCE of PTFE-based perovskite solar cells exhibits an excellent stability and maintained 95% of its initial PCE with a much slower degradation rate, compared to the pristine one which has shown a fast decrease remaining at 67% from its initial value after storage for 42 days. These results therefore confirm the hydrophobic role of the PTFE additive at the perovskite surface and GBs, which allows one to obtain excellent environmental stability enhancement compared to other fluorinated polymers such as fluorinated polythiophene derivatives (FEH) used as a hole-transport layer (HTL) with 80% of its initial PCE retained over 500 h of exposure in an ambient environment.57 We also tested the perovskite film photo-stability at an ambient environment under continuous LED light soaking for 50 h (Fig. 8b and c). We found that the absorption intensity of the pristine perovskite film exhibits a high decrease compared to the PTFE-based film which dropped slightly. This may be due to the elimination of vacancy-assisted ion migration through a better film crystal quality with a reduced effect. We can therefore assume that the PTFE additive could act as a protective agent against ion segregation which causes film degradation when exposed to UV light. However, further studies need to be conducted to confirm this finding.

3. Experimental
3.1. Materials
ITO substrates were purchased from GULUO GLASS Technology co. Ltd. SnO2 colloidal dispersion (15%) and all solvents were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The rest of the chemicals were from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology corp., and they were directly used without further purification.
3.2. Device fabrication
ITO substrates were successively cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in isopropanol-acetone-isopropanol for 15 minutes respectively, and then treated with ultraviolet radiation for 10 min. An electron transfer layer tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticle film has been deposited on the treated substrate in ambient air at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min and finally treated again in ultraviolet radiation for 10 minutes. Previously SnO2 nanoparticle solution was prepared by colloidal dilution with deionized water from 15% to 2.67%. After the electron transport layer (ETL) deposition, the active perovskite layer was deposited onto it by a two-step deposition method. We first spin-coated in a N2 glove box 1.5 M PbI2 in a DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent mixture at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed it at 70 °C for 1 min. Secondly, a precursor solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (90 mg:9 mg:9 mg in 1 ml IPA) mixed with PTFE at different volume ratios (1–5–10–15–20%) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 minutes in ambient air. After cooling down the substrate at room temperature, the perovskite film was transferred into a glovebox for hole transport layer (HTL) deposition, where 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene, 35 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg mL−1) and 30 μL TBP solution was deposited at 3000 rpm for 30 s.18 Finally, an 80 nm Au top electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The device active area was 0.04 cm2.
3.3. Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU8010) was carried out to examine the morphology of the perovskite films. The XRD patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker-D8) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The data were collected with an accelerating voltage of 40 kV, electrical current of 40 mA, and step size of 0.02. Steady-state PL was achieved using a femtosecond laser system at a wavelength 532 nm with 35 fs pulses and a repetition operating rate of 1 kHz. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) linear absorption spectra were recorded using a Persee TU-1810 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Impedance spectroscopy was carried out in a dark state with the frequency from 1 Hz to 106 Hz. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were collected using a source meter measurement system (Keithley 2400) simulated under AM 1.5G illumination at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under ambient conditions. The EQE spectrum was characterized by using a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150-DSSC) and then was utilized to measure the integrated current of the PSC device. Impedance spectroscopy was carried out in a dark state with the frequency from 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz. Photo-stability tests were performed using a 50 W white LED lamp in ambient air.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated an efficient and highly stable hybrid perovskite solar cell, via a two step deposition technique, where the PTFE additive has for the first time been introduced into the organic perovskite precursor. Our research results reveal that the PTFE additive induces less recombination in the perovskite layer, which allows the increase of optical properties, and consequently the improvement of the device photovoltaic performances. A champion power conversion efficiency of 20.48% is achieved for PTFE-based PSCs with a Voc of 1.06 V, Jsc of 24.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.94%. Moreover, the PTFE-based PSC device shows strong environmental stability enhancement with only 5% PCE loss over 42 days in an ambient environment. Overall, this work provides a promising approach to further improve the PSC stability, and a good perspective for its commercial application.
