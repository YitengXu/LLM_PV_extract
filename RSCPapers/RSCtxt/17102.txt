    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 4th January 2018AbstractWe report the observations on the structural characterization and the optical properties of SnO2 nanowires post-treated under different annealing temperatures (300, 400, 500 & 600 °C) for 1 h. Well-aligned SnO2 nanowires with diameters of about 100–120 nm were deposited into alumina templates by means of the liquid phase deposition method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman patterns of the prepared samples were indexed to the rutile phase of SnO2 without any trace of an extra phase, which was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of annealing temperature on the optical properties of SnO2 nanowires was studied by using UV-vis and luminescence spectral data. The UV-vis spectra indicated that the absorption edge is blue shifted as the annealing temperature is raised and the bandgap was determined to be 3.32 eV to 3.88 eV. Photoluminescence measurements showed a broad dominant emission peak in the visible region around 450–650 nm. This suggests that the visible emission can originate from defect-related states, particularly oxygen vacancies induced during the formation of SnO2 nanowires.
1. Introduction
Tin oxide or SnO2 is one of the important n-type semiconductor materials, which combines high optical transparency in the visible range with low electrical resistance and excellent chemical stability.1–3 These unique properties make SnO2 a suitable material for many opto-chemical and -electronic applications, particularly as a light emitting diode (LED),4 as a field-emitter,5 in energy storage and conversion,6 as a gas sensor,7 a dye-sensitized solar cell,8 and a lithium-ion electrode material in batteries,9 in UV detectors,10 in digital display11 and as a photocatalyst.12 However, bulk SnO2 is not a luminescent material and shows very low emission efficiency at room temperature due to the nature of its band edge quantum states, which has prevented its potential short-wavelength optoelectronic applications.13–15 Morphology-based materials have attracted researchers, and many efforts have recently been devoted to synthesizing one-dimensional (1D) SnO2 nanostructures with unique morphology.16–19 Compared to conventional SnO2 nanoparticles, 1D SnO2 arrays in the form of nanorods, nanotubes, or nanowires show better properties that are required in photoelectronic applications, such as high electron mobility, long distance transport ability, enhanced light absorption and scattering, fast charge transport efficiency, high specific area, and good electron–hole separation power.20–22 Nowadays, 1D SnO2 nanostructures are attracting a great deal of attention due to their unique properties and novel applications. Various techniques including epitaxial growth,23 thermal evaporation24 electrospinning,25 hydrothermal,26 sol–gel,27 vapor–liquid-solution (VLS),16 and liquid phase deposition (LPD)28 methods have been developed for the fabrication of nanowires and nanotubes. Among these techniques, the LPD process is an innovative and novel chemical approach, which offers so many enormous advantages such as simple equipment requirements, low cost, and a very simple process. In this method, an anodic alumina template was used as a starting material and a scavenger, which leads to highly ordered 1D arrays via only a one-step reaction.29,30 Tin oxide or hydroxide nanoparticles can be deposited in situ on the alumina template by means of both a hydrolysis equilibrium reaction of Sn–fluoro complexation and an F− consuming reaction of the alumina template, which acts as a scavenger for F− according to the following reactions:30–33 [SnF6]2− + nH2O ↔ [Sn6−n(OH)n]2− + nH+ + nF−(1) [Sn6−n(OH)n]2− + nH2O ↔ [Sn(OH)6]2− + nH+ + nF−(2) Al2O3 + 12H+ + 12F− ↔ 2H3AlF6 + 3H2O(3)
Ligand exchange between [SnF6]2− and [Sn6−n(OH)n]2− is accelerated by the consumption reaction of F− ions in the treatment solution. Hydrous tin oxide is formed from the surface to the inner wall of the alumina template with prolonged reaction time, and thereby can turn into crystalline SnO2 nanowires after annealing. The annealing process is usually applied to improve the surface structure as well as the crystallinity and lattice mismatch, to reduce the intrinsic stress, and create longer mean paths for the free electrons to obtain better electrical conductivity.34 In nanostructured materials, surface defects provide active sites for surface interactions and reduce the activation energy of photochemical reactions. Therefore, the nature and position of surface defects define the light emission and photoelectrochemical properties.35 UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra present a deep insight about the structure, nature and concentration of defects in a material, and are useful tools for understanding the impacts of defects on the optical properties.35–37 It has been generally believed that the luminescence of SnO2 is mainly due to the presence of energy states in the band gap associated with defects such as tin interstitials, dangling bonds, and particularly oxygen vacancies.38–40 Hild et al.41 reported the luminescence properties of SnO2 thin films annealed in air at different temperatures between 600 and 900 °C. They observed a very weak band at around 415 nm and a large strong band at around 650 nm. The latter showed a strong temperature dependence, which was interpreted as a defect-related luminescence band; in contrast, the former demonstrated a lower temperature dependence, which was suggested to be associated with the recombination of free excitons. Therefore, it is important to further investigate the annealing temperature-dependence of the optical properties of SnO2 nanowires. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the annealing temperature and optical properties of 1D SnO2 nanowires have not been well studied nor clarified to date. With this aim, the influence of annealing temperature on the structure and optical properties of well-aligned 1D SnO2 nanowires is investigated.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Synthesis of well-aligned 1D SnO2 nanowires by the LPD process
The starting materials for SnO2 nanowires were chosen to be (NH4)2SnF6, deionized water, and alumina membranes as templates. Commercial alumina membranes having a diameter of 2.5 cm, a thickness of 60 μm and an average pore diameter of 100 nm were purchased from Whatman Company. The chemical regent (NH4)2TiF6 (Sigma-Aldrich; 99.99%) was dissolved in deionized water (18 MΩ cm) to produce a 100 mmol dm−3 aqueous treatment solution. The initial treatment solution was completely transparent, showing no signs of bulk precipitation. The well-aligned 1D SnO2 nanowires were thus prepared by immersing an alumina template into the treatment solution maintained at 45 °C for 240 min to increase the rate of hydrolysis of the cationic species present in solution. At the end of the reaction, the templates were taken out from the solution, washed carefully with ethanol and distilled water and dried at room temperature for 5 h. Since the resulting nanowires were amorphous, a subsequent annealing was necessary to convert tin oxide and hydroxide into the desired crystalline SnO2 nanowires. In this regard, for the thermal treatment, the samples were placed in a heat treatment furnace and annealed at 300, 400, 500 and 600 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The SnO2 nanowires were released by dissolving the templates in 20 ml of 4 M NaOH solution and were washed several times in water to ensure that the NaOH is fully removed.
2.2. Characterization of prepared SnO2 nanowires
The SnO2 nanowires were characterized by means of morphological, structural and optical analyses. The purity and the phase structure of the products were studied using a PANalytical X'pert Pro X-ray diffractometer equipped with intense CuKα (λ = 0.1542 nm). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a scan rate of 2° min−1 from 20° to 80°. The size of the crystallites was determined by the analysis of the main peak in the corresponding XRD patterns by the Debye–Scherrer method. The Raman measurements of the annealed SnO2 nanowires were obtained using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrometer at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 632.8 nm and the spectrometer was set at a spectral resolution of 0.4 cm−1 with a maximum power of 10 mW. Before measurement, the system was calibrated using the 521 cm−1 Raman line of a Si wafer. All Raman spectra were obtained in the region 400–800 cm−1 in the backscattering geometry. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN MIRA3) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmittance electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM30) were used to investigate the morphology and structure of the SnO2 nanowires. The prepared samples were sputter-coated with a thin gold layer prior to observation in the SEM. For TEM characterization, the SnO2 nanowires were first immersed in ethanol solution and subjected to ultrasound vibration for 5 min to disperse the nanowires homogeneously. Then, the precipitates were carefully extracted from the suspension and picked up using a carbon-coated copper grid. After drying under ambient conditions, the precipitates on the copper grids were directly observed under TEM operated at 200 kV. The crystalline structure of the nanowires was investigated by select area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis. The optical absorption properties of the SnO2 nanowires in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm were measured using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. The spectra were recorded with a 1 nm resolution at room temperature. The PL studies were carried out in the range 300–800 nm at room temperature using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer under a backscattering geometry. A xenon pulse lamp was used as the excitation source with an output power of 150 W at a wavelength of 325 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Studies of the structure and morphology of SnO2 nanowires

3.1.1. XRD and Raman. 
The X-ray diffraction analysis of the SnO2 nanowires was performed in order to identify the phase and crystal structure and to estimate the average crystallite size. The XRD diffraction patterns of the SnO2 samples prepared at different annealing temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 1. It is clear from Fig. 1(a) that there are no characteristic peaks at the annealing temperature of 300 °C, implying the amorphous nature of the SnO2 nanowires. When the samples were annealed at 400 °C, broad XRD peaks with low intensity appeared, indicating that the crystallization of SnO2 has started (Fig. 1(b)). At lower annealing temperatures, the SnO2 nanowires are in the initial phase of structural formation preventing full crystallization of the nanowires. Thus, it was proved that an annealing temperature of 400 °C was not high enough to form SnO2 nanowires with high crystalline perfection. As the annealing temperature is increased to 500 °C (Fig. 1(c)), the number of reflections and the degree of crystallinity increase, indicating that fully crystalline SnO2 nanowires are being annealed for 1 h at 500 °C. The peaks present in the spectrum of nanowires annealed at 500 °C confirm the polycrystalline nature of the nanowires and are in excellent accordance with single-phase tetragonal SnO2. The nanowires exhibited X-ray diffraction peaks at respective angles of 2θ = 26.5°, 33.9°, 51.6°, 64.8°, 66.0° and 78.8°, which were assigned to (110), (101), (211), (112), (301) and (321) planes, respectively. The peak positions matched well with those of the corresponding bulk rutile-SnO2 with standard JCPDS card no. 041-1445. No other crystalline impurities were detected in the pattern, indicating that the SnO2 nanowires annealed at 500 °C have a pure rutile structure with lattice parameters of a = b = 0.4740 nm and c = 0.3174 nm. Fig. 1(d) shows the crystallinity enhancement of the samples owing to the increase in the intensity of SnO2 diffraction peaks when the annealing temperature is increased to 600 °C. The relatively sharp diffraction peaks suggest that the fabricated SnO2 nanowires are highly crystalline. The average crystallite size (D) of the SnO2 nanowires was also estimated from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) intensity of the observed peaks by using the Debye–Scherrer equation in the form:42 (4)where k is the shape factor which is usually equal to 0.89, λ is the radiation wavelength of CuKα equal to 0.1542 nm, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is defined as β = (βObserved2 − βInstrument2)1/2. The instrumental broadening was taken into account, which was calibrated with standard Si samples. As regards the (110) diffraction peak, the FWHM values were found to be 1.3° and 0.87° for SnO2 nanowires annealed at 500 and 600 °C, of which the average crystallite sizes were calculated to be about 6.2 and 9.4 nm, respectively. As can be seen from the XRD patterns in Fig. 1, the width of the peaks decreases with increasing annealing temperature, indicating the growth of crystal size. The obvious broadening of the XRD peaks of SnO2 nanowires annealed at 400 and 500 °C suggests that these SnO2 crystals are of much smaller size in comparison with SnO2 nanowires annealed at 600 °C.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the SnO2 nanowire arrays annealed at different temperatures for 1 h. 
For the further investigation into the crystalline structure of SnO2 nanowires, Raman scattering spectroscopy was employed. Raman scattering is sensitive to the local structure and crystal surface area and is a powerful tool for the characterization of nanomaterials and a qualitative probe for the presence of lattice defects in solids.43Fig. 2 depicts the room-temperature Raman spectra of the SnO2 nanowires annealed at 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 2(a), as for the SnO2 nanowires annealed at 300 °C, there is no obvious Raman mode, consistent with its amorphous nature. After annealing at 400 °C (Fig. 2(b)), two Raman peaks were found at 631 and 772 cm−1, and their intensities had significantly increased when the annealing temperature was increased to 500 °C. On the basis of group theory,44 the normal lattice vibration of SnO2 at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone is defined as follow:45 Γ = Γ1+ (1A1g) + Γ2+ (1A2g) + Γ3+ (1B1g) + Γ4+ (1B2g) + Γ5− (1Eg) + Γ1− (1A2u) + 2Γ4− (B1u) + 3Γ5+ (Eu)(5)
 Fig. 2  Room-temperature Raman spectra of the SnO2 nanowire arrays annealed at different temperature for 1 h. 
A single SnO2 crystal with a tetragonal rutile structure indicates four Raman active modes, A1g, B1g, B2g, and E1g. In these modes, the oxygen atoms vibrate while the Sn atoms are at rest. The A1g, B1g, and B2g modes are nondegenerate and vibrate with displacements in the planes perpendicular to the c-axis, while the doubly degenerate E1g mode represents vibrations with displacements in the direction of the c-axis. The B1g mode consists of rotation of the oxygen atoms around the c axis, with all six oxygen atoms of the octahedron participating in the vibration.46,47 The single symmetrical A2u and the triply degenerate Eu modes are infrared (IR) active and two modes of symmetrical A2g and B1u are optically inactive. The silent modes of B1u and A2g are according to the vibrations of the Sn and O atoms in the direction of the c-axis and in the plane perpendicular to this direction, respectively.47 The Raman spectrum of the nanowires annealed at 500 °C for 1 h (Fig. 2(c)) shows the presence of five vibration peaks at 475, 560, 633, 694, and 774 cm−1. The peak positions could correspond to the E1g mode, S1 band, A1g, A2u (LO) and B2g vibrational modes of SnO2, respectively.48–50 It can also be seen from the Raman spectra that the A1g mode has the strongest relative intensity, followed by the E1g and B2g modes. These Raman bands further confirm the characteristics of the tetragonal rutile structure and the very small crystal size of the SnO2 nanowires, which is in agreement with the results of group theory analysis.48,49,51 The peak at 475 cm−1 can be associated with the vibration of oxygen, while the Raman shift peaks at 633 and 774 cm−1 can be induced by the contraction and expansion vibration of Sn–O bands and usually detected in bulk polycrystalline or single crystal SnO2.46,52 It is usually accepted that the downward shift of the vibration bands for SnO2 nanowires is due to the finite size effect of the structure.47,53 In addition, compared to the Raman peaks of the bulk rutile SnO2, the Raman peaks of the SnO2 nanowires are considerably broader. Besides these dominant classical vibration modes, two additional Raman scattering peaks at 560 and 694 cm−1 also appear in the pattern of nanowires, which are not detected in the bulk rutile SnO2. The weak peak at around 560 cm−1 may be attributed to the S1 band that resulted from the disorder activation of the acoustic, while the band at 694 cm−1 is assigned to the IR-active A2u (LO) mode (the mode of the longitudinal optical phones).47,54 These two peaks are usually believed to originate from the space symmetry of nanosized SnO2 with small grains, and may be explained as a possibility of the appearance of new modes in the Raman spectrum.55 This reveals the very small size of SnO2 nanocrystals in the nanowires. In nanocrystalline SnO2, the surface properties are related not only to the grain size and their distributions but also to the existence of vacant oxygen lattice sites and local lattice disorder.56 When the annealing temperature is increased to 600 °C, the vibration peaks can be clearly observed at 477, 561, 635, 697, and 775 cm−1, according to Fig. 2(d). These Raman peaks (especially the fundamental peak at 635 cm−1 assigned to the A1g vibrational mode) are sensitive to the grain size and shift to higher wave numbers with increasing annealing temperature.47,51


3.1.2. FESEM and TEM. 
The FESEM micrographs of the alumina template and well-aligned 1D SnO2 nanowires annealed at 600 °C for 1 h are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the alumina template. It is composed of many nanochannels, and the average size of the nanochannels is approximately 100 nm. The size and shape of the final product are deeply dependent on the size and shape of the template. Thus, a uniform template means regular and ordered guests. Fig. 3(b) exhibits a typical FESEM micrograph of SnO2 nanowires that have been prepared by the LPD process with alumina templates. The size distribution of the nanowires is all uniform over the entire area and the average diameter of the nanowires is about 100–120 nm. The diameter of the SnO2 nanowires is a little larger than the original channel of the alumina template due to limited dissolution of the template by the reactant. The inset in Fig. 3(b) depicts a side view image of the nanowires, indicating the alumina templates have been completely dissolved and the prepared nanowires are smooth, large-scale, and vertically well-aligned. The elemental concentration of the SnO2 nanowires annealed at different temperatures was detected by EDX analysis, and the results are given in Table 1. Clearly, all the samples contain oxygen and tin elements, and with the increase in annealing temperature from 300 to 500 °C, the oxygen concentration increased, and further increasing the annealing temperature up to 600 °C decreased the oxygen concentration.

Fig. 4(a) displays a bright-field TEM image of an individual SnO2 nanowire prepared by the LPD process and subsequently annealed at 600 °C for 1 h. It can be seen that the nanowire has a uniform and smooth surface morphology with a structurally perfect geometric shape. The average diameter of the nanowire is about 110 nm, which is limited by the pore wall of the template. The corresponding SAED pattern indicates the spotted Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings in reciprocal space, which were indexed to the (110), (101), (211) and (221) planes of the polycrystalline rutile SnO2 structure (Fig. 4(b)). These indexed patterns demonstrate that the prepared SnO2 nanowires are well crystallized, in good accordance with the XRD reflections described above.

3.2. Studies of the optical properties of SnO2 nanowires

3.2.1. Analysis by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. 
A high-energy shift of the absorption edge is generally expected for nanomaterials. To confirm this, the optical absorbance of the SnO2 nanowires has been investigated with the assistance of the UV-vis spectrophotometer. If light with intensity I0 is incident on a sample with thickness d, the intensity that is transmitted is expressed as a function of the absorption coefficient α by the Lambert–Beer–Bouguer law:57 I = I0 exp(αd)(6)

Eqn (2) can be simplified and the absorption coefficient can be calculated using the following relation: α = 2.303A/d(7)where A is the optical absorbance. Fig. 5a shows the optical absorbance spectra of the SnO2 nanowires as a function of wavelength for different annealing temperatures. These spectra exhibit that the nanowires have low absorbance in the visible region but show high absorption in the UV region between 200 nm and 300 nm. There is a sharp absorption increase at wavelengths shorter than ∼400 nm, corresponding to the energy threshold for band edge absorption of SnO2 nanowires. It must be noted that there is a blue shift in absorption edges of the nanowires towards shorter wavelengths as the annealing temperature increases from 300 to 600 °C. This may be expected due to the changes in surface structure, crystal size and crystal defects created during the transformation of SnO2 nanowires.58 The graphs show that the optical absorbance intensity increases with the increase in annealing temperature, which may be due to the increase in the scattering of photons by crystal defects.

3.2.2. Estimation of the optical energy band gap. 
The relation between the absorption coefficient of the SnO2 nanowires, A, at a certain value of wavelength and the incident photon energy (hν) is given by the following equation, known as the Wood–Tauc equation:59 (8)where k is the transition probability constant which is related to the effective masses associated with the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, Eg is the separation gap between the bottom of the CB and the top of the VB (energy band gap), and n is an exponent that assumes the values of 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, or 2 depending on the nature of the electronic transition.60 In order to estimate the optical energy band gap, the graph of (Ahν)nversus hν can be plotted by replacing n; for a direct transition, n = 2/3 or 2 depending on whether the transition is forbidden or allowed in the quantum mechanical sense. Similarly, n = 1/3 or 1/2 is for an indirectly forbidden or an allowed optical transition, respectively. In our case, the value of n = 2 was found to be the most suitable, since it provides the best linear curve in the band-edge region, which indicates a direct allowed transition in the SnO2 nanowires. The intercept of the tangent to the graphs gives a good approximation of the band gap energy for the direct band gap materials. Therefore, the energy band gap for the direct band gap of SnO2 nanowires was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the curves to the hν axis at zero absorption, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Along with a comparison with the published results of the energy band gap for SnO2 films annealed at different temperatures,61 the variation of the energy band gap with annealing temperature is listed in Table 2.

It is also observed that the Eg increased from 3.32 eV to 3.88 eV when the annealing temperature increased from 300 to 600 °C. The Eg values of the samples annealed at 500 and 600 °C, which are completely crystallized based on the XRD and Raman analyses, are shown to be higher than that of bulk SnO2 (3.62 eV). With increasing annealing temperature, the crystallinity of the SnO2 nanowires was improved, the number of grain boundaries decreased and caused a rapid reduction of the defect states near the bands, which led to the increase in Eg values.61 Since the nanowire diameter is much larger than the excitonic Bohr radius, which is ∼2.7 nm for SnO2,62 the band gap enhancement due to the quantum size effect is not expected.


3.2.3. Photoluminescence spectroscopy. 
The structure–property correlation of SnO2 nanowires is also reflected in their photoluminescence properties. PL is emission of light from a material under optical excitation and PL spectroscopy refers to the collection and analysis of this light emission. Fig. 6 shows the room-temperature PL emission spectra of the SnO2 nanowires annealed at different temperatures. As shown in the PL curves, one weak and broad visible light emission peak can be observed between 400 nm and 600 nm in the amorphous sample annealed at 300 °C. It becomes sharper and shifts to a longer wavelength centered at 532 nm, after being annealed at 400 °C. After having been annealed at 500 °C, a strong luminescence emission peak located at 573 nm is observed, which can be attributed to defect-related states generated during the formation of nanowires. The broad emission band between 500 nm and 600 nm from SnO2 nanowires can be ascribed to the energy states situated inside the band gap due to intrinsic defects such as oxygen or tin vacancies, and unoccupied electron states in the dangling bonds in the near-surface region of SnO2 nanowires that act as luminescence centers by trapping a hole and an electron.39,41 The excitation of the SnO2 nanowires is initiated with the creation of electron–hole pairs. The non-equilibrium electrons are elevated from the filled VB into the CB, leaving the holes in the VB. The electrons and holes can annihilate or recombine in two ways: (i) radiatively by emitting photons or (ii) non-radiatively by emitting phonons or by transferring energy to another particle.63,64 However, the emission peaks at around 500–600 nm (2.07–2.48 eV) are smaller than the band gap of bulk SnO2, and so the near band edge emission, which can be ascribed to a direct recombination of a conduction electron in the Sn4p band and a hole in the O2p valence band, is not detected in the PL spectra.65,66 Thereby, as mentioned by Luo et al.,67 these broad PL peaks cannot be attributed to the recombination of free excitons. It should be noted that the intensity of PL peaks increases with the increase in annealing temperature up to 500 °C. During the synthesis and annealing of SnO2 nanowires, the generation/existence of numerous dangling bonds and a high density of O and Sn vacancies may be expected. First principle calculations by Zhou et al.19 have shown that oxygen vacancies and tin interstitials have dramatically low formation energies and strong reciprocal interactions, and their formation is not energetically expensive in the host lattice. So, a high concentration of these defects located at SnO2 nanowires can be expected. The O vacancies, which may mainly exist at the surface of the nanowires, interact with interfacial Sn vacancies, which leads to the formation of a considerable amount of trapped states within the band gap;63,68 this results in a strong PL intensity. According to Zhou et al.,65 the oxygen vacancy-related surface states are located about 0.9 eV above the VB maximum and about 2.7 eV below the CB minimum. For all samples, the emission energy (2.1–2.2 eV) was less than the energy gap between the CB minimum and surface states. So they assumed that the electrons in the SnO2 nanowires can be grabbed from the CB by the trap levels below the CB and then recombine with the hole at the surface states, as shown in Fig. 7. Similar PL results were also reported by Kar et al.40 for the synthesis of SnO2 nanorods and nanoparticles via hydrothermal and microwave irradiation methods. They found that the PL emission and decay time strongly depend on the shape of the nanocrystals. In the crystal lattice of SnO2, some O2− ions can be trapped in the host lattice, leading to formation of oxygen vacancies that can trap electrons to form VO˙ states. The PL spectra indicate that the visible emission of SnO2 nanocrystals can be attributed to a transition of electrons from a level close to the CB edge to a deeply trapped hole in the bulk (VO˙˙). Gu et al.69 suggested that the active hole formed can be trapped at the VO˙ center directly to form the VO˙ center or at the surface of the particle. Then the surface-trapped hole may transfer back into the particle to recombine with an electron in a deep trap (VO˙) to form the VO˙ center. In optoelectronic devices, nanowire materials play an important role due to their effective charge separation, which minimizes the reflectance of incident light.

As the annealing temperature of 1D SnO2 nanowires increases up to 600 °C, the crystallite size becomes larger and the crystallinity becomes better, while the intensity of the oxygen vacancy-related luminescence peak (560 nm) is found to decrease. According to Table 1, with the increase in annealing temperature up to 500 °C, the concentration of surface oxygen increases and the further increase in annealing temperature is accompanied by a decrease in oxygen concentration, while the relevant crystalline performance is enhanced by a decrease in bulk defects.39 Chen et al.70 indicated that annealing at high temperature removes the surface oxygen vacancies; meanwhile some oxygen atoms are localized at the surface oxygen interstitial sites, hindering further diffusion of oxygen atoms into the deeper bulk of the nanoribbons.

4. Conclusion
The effect of annealing temperature on the structure and optical properties of well-aligned 1D SnO2 nanowires which were fabricated by the LPD process was investigated. The XRD, Raman and TEM results revealed the formation of a pure rutile SnO2 structure, whereas the degree of crystallinity and crystallite size increase as the annealing temperature increases. The UV-vis spectra exhibited that all the samples have high absorbance in the UV region, which may be attributed to the increase of photon scattering by crystal defects. The optical band gap values were found to increase from 3.32 to 3.88 eV as the annealing temperature rises from 300 to 600 °C. The photoluminescence characteristics of the SnO2 nanowires showed that there is one broad visible emission peak centered at wavelengths 450–650 nm. The nature of the transition may be due to energy states in the band gap associated with defects such as tin interstitials, dangling bonds, and particularly oxygen vacancies. With increasing annealing temperature, the crystallite size becomes larger and the crystallinity becomes better, while the intensity of the oxygen vacancy-related luminescence peak first increases for annealing temperature up to 500 °C and then decreases for 600 °C. Based on these results, it is suggested that such SnO2 nanowires have potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
