    , Accepted 17th April 2022First published on 18th April 2022AbstractAlongside highly efficient photocatalysts, high photovoltaic performance is also a key element for efficiently harvesting solar energy. Developing bifunctional materials which satisfy concurrently these two demands is an appealing strategy for solving the current serious energy and environmental issues. Based on first-principles and quantum transport calculations, we designed this kind of novel bifunctional material: Janus GeC/SnSSe van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH). We demonstrate that it is a highly efficient direct Z-scheme photocatalyst. However, unlike traditional direct Z-scheme photocatalysts, the GeC/SnSSe vdWH possesses a small energy separation between the low conduction band located in SnSSe and the high valence band residing in the GeC layer, which significantly fosters the interlayer charge transfer. Hence, its solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency reaches as high as 68.37%. Moreover, we also find that tensile strain promotes an astonishing increase in photovoltaic performance, e.g., 4% tensile strain leads to an increase of the photocurrent by 40%.
1. Introduction
The imperative demand for clean and renewable energy has prompted researchers to explore innovative highly efficient photovoltaic and photocatalytic materials.1–3 An ideal solar energy harvesting material should have the following characteristics: (I) high carrier mobility, (II) wide visible optical absorption range, (III) high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and (IV) environment-stability. Aside from these requirements, an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting also requires that the band edges straddle the water redox potentials.4–6 In recent years, with the advancement of two-dimensional (2D) materials synthesis, van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) assembled vertically using two or more different 2D materials via weak vdW interactions have become a promising platform for 2D material engineering.7–10 Very interestingly, by proper selection of the constituent materials, the bandstructure of the vdWHs might form type-II band alignments in which photogenerated electron–hole pairs are effectively separated into two distinct layers, reducing significantly the electron–hole recombination process.11–16 It improves the solar cell efficiency. However, the conventional type-II vdWH has weak redox ability for water splitting, which is not conducive to the photocatalytic performance.17 Remarkably, some heterostructures with type-II band alignment can serve as a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst with a “Z-shape” charge transfer route to generate hydrogen (oxygen) on the high (low) potential side of the heterostructure.18–20 Unlike the photocatalysts of conventional type-II vdWHs, these direct Z-scheme photocatalysts not only contain well-separated electrons and holes in different layers, but also possess high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. Recently, some direct Z-scheme photocatalysts have been successfully fabricated.21–23 Therefore, direct Z-scheme photocatalysts are promising materials for overall water splitting.
As a new member of 2D materials, Janus monolayers with different atoms on two surfaces, synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method,24–26 have recently attracted wide attention. Their asymmetric structure induces a larger inherent dipole and vertical piezoelectric response,24 which fosters significantly the separation of photogenerated carriers, and consequently prolongs the carrier lifetimes, rendering Janus vdWHs fruitful for optoelectronic devices27 and photocatalytic water splitting.28 SnSSe is a Janus 2D material and a proven electrode material for energy storage devices with excellent electrochemical advantages and abundant reserves.29 Recent studies demonstrated that the Janus SnSSe monolayer has a strain-tunable electronic structure, high mobility of holes, and exceptionally high absorption in the visible light region.29–35 As such it is an interesting material for photocatalysts. As is known, Janus MoSSe and WSSe monolayers have been successfully fabricated using the CVD method.24–26 In addition, monolayer SnX2 (X = S, Se) materials have also been synthesized.36,37 Then one can reasonably speculate that the Janus SnSSe monolayer may also be synthesized by selenizing a SnS2 monolayer or sulfurizing a SnSe2 monolayer through the CVD process similar to the methodology utilized in the synthesis of MoSSe. Besides the SnSSe monolayer, the germanium carbide (GeC) monolayer is worth noting as well. It is an IV–IVA semiconductor with a honeycomb lattice similar to graphene and can be prepared through several experimental methods.38,39 The GeC films possess a number of applications in temperature sensors and infrared optics.40,41 The theoretical studies show that the GeC monolayer has excellent stability and a direct bandgap of 2.07 eV.42,43 In addition, it is also a promising metal-free electrocatalyst for substituting Pt-based materials.44,45 Although extensive studies of the SnSSe and GeC monolayers have been performed, the photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of vdWHs based on GeC and SnSSe monolayers are yet to be reported.
In this work, we have designed a set of Janus vdWHs formed by graphene-like GeC and SnSSe monolayers as potential direct Z-scheme photocatalysts and photovoltaic devices based on density functional theory simulations. The electronic bandstructures show that the bandgaps of the vdWHs are smaller than those of their constituent monolayers due to the internal energy-level shift, which benefits optical absorption. Moreover, the vdWHs possess type-II band alignments, facilitating the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and enhancing sunlight absorption ability. The electron–hole recombination process can then be significantly suppressed, leading to the accumulation of the photogenerated carriers. We demonstrate that neither GeC nor SnSSe monolayer alone can accomplish overall water splitting, but noble-metal-free direct Z-scheme GeC/SnSSe vdWHs photocatalysts can achieve overall water splitting efficiently due to the built-in electric field. In addition, the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs possess energetic and thermodynamic stability. Astonishingly, unlike the usual direct Z-scheme photocatalysts, the GeC/SnSSe vdWH possesses a small energy separation between the low conduction band (CB) located in SnSSe and the high valence band (VB) residing in the GeC layer, distinctively fostering the interlayer charge transfer. As a consequence, its STH efficiency can reach as high as 68.37%. Furthermore, the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs-based photocatalysts can make water splitting in all varied pH environments possible. Therefore, they are all-around photocatalysts. Besides photocatalysis and optical absorption, we also evaluate the photocurrent in a GeC/SnSSe vdWH-based nanodevice irradiated with linearly polarized laser light. We find that, aside from the 2D-based systems’ good photoresponsivity, it also has an impressive external quantum efficiency. More interestingly, tensile strain can notably enhance the optical absorption and photocurrent of GeC/SnSSe vdWHs. The superior optical absorption coefficient, STH conversion efficiency, photoresponsivity, and external quantum efficiency in the visible light region make GeC/SnSSe vdWHs promising candidates as bifunctional materials for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications.
2. Computational methods
First-principles calculations under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were performed by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).46 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)47 scheme within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)48 hybrid functional was also applied for more accurate electronic structure, band alignment, and optical property calculations. The DFT-D349 method within the Grimme scheme was adopted to include the vdW interactions. The plane-wave cutoff, energy convergence tolerance, and force convergence on each atom during structural relaxation were set to be 500 eV, 10−5 eV, and −0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled on a 15 × 15 × 1 k-point grid using the Monkhorst–Pack method. The vacuum layer was taken to be at least 20 Å to avoid the interaction from image layers. Additionally, the dipole correction was included due to the existence of the dipole moment.50Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation51 was performed to estimate the thermal stability in a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell at 300 K with a time step of 2 fs for 10 ps. To confirm the reliability of our calculations, we performed similar calculations on similar but more studied vdWHs such as MoS2/WS2 using the same computational method. Comparing our calculated results (especially the bandstructure, STH efficiency, and photocurrent) with experimental observations in the literature, it is found that the calculated results agree well with the relevant experiments, further confirming the reliability of our methodology.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structures and stabilities
Both GeC and SnSSe monolayers have hexagonal structures (see Fig. 1). The calculated lattice constants are respectively 3.26 Å and 3.76 Å as listed in Table 1, which are in good accordance with the literature.30,52 Besides, consistent with the previous work,30,44 both monolayers are semiconductors. The GeC monolayer has a direct bandgap of 2.90 (2.07) eV, and the SnSSe monolayer has an indirect bandgap of 1.69 (0.93) eV at the HSE06 (PBE) level. And for the GeC monolayer, the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) identically resides at the K point, while the VBM is at Γ but the CBM at M points for the Janus monolayer, as shown in Fig. S1.† Therefore, the models and calculation accuracy we provide are valid. Then, we design the vdWH by placing the Janus SnSSe on top of the GeC monolayer. The stacking manner of the Janus 2D vdWHs is critical to their performance. Based on the two different species of chalcogen S and Se atoms on either side of Janus SnSSe, two representative stacking configurations are considered, named, GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs, respectively. To minimize the lattice mismatch for the GeC and Janus SnSSe monolayers, a 2 × 2 supercell for GeC and a  supercell for SnSSe are employed, and only a minor mismatch of about 0.1% is introduced. Such similar geometries of the two monolayers indicate the significant feasibility for establishing these vdWHs.

Stability is a necessary condition for the practical applications of theoretically designed materials. We calculate the binding energy using the formula: Eb = (EGeC/SnSSe − EGeC − ESnSSe)/N,(1)where EGeC/SnSSe, EGeC, and ESnSSe are the total energies of vdWH, GeC, and SnSSe monolayers, respectively, and N is the number of atoms. The calculated binding energies of both vdWHs are negative (GeC/SeSnS: −37.59 meV per atom, GeC/SSnSe: −35.58 meV per atom; see Table 1), suggesting that the attractive interfacial interaction between SnSSe and GeC is energetically favorable. The slightly greater (more negative) binding energies than that of bilayer graphene (−27.08 meV per atom) further indicate the possibility of experimental preparation.53 Interestingly, because binding energies are only slightly different, the two vdWHs can appear simultaneously. Moreover, the interlayer distances of the GeC/SeSnS (3.52 Å) and GeC/SSnSe (3.44 Å) vdWHs are also acceptable vdW interlayer spacing.
Furthermore, we perform AIMD at 300 K, as shown in Fig. S2,† and find that the total energy and temperature oscillation persistently remain at a limited value. Moreover, according to the snapshots of the two vdWHs at 10 ps, as respectively presented in the insets, we could find no bond-breaking and severe structural distortion in the final structures, indicating the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs are stable at room temperature. So, experimentally synthesizing the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs is viable in the future.
3.2. Electronic structures of vdWHs
Since the PBE method always underestimates the bandgap, which plays a crucial role in the optical properties, the following calculations are based on the HSE06 functional if no special instructions are mentioned. After stacking the two monolayers together, GeC/SnSSe vdWHs are indirect bandgap semiconductors. Because of the different chemical potentials and work functions inducing band offsets and charge transfer between the two layers, bandstructures from the two monolayers may be aligned in the type-II style for both stacking manners. As a result, the global bandgaps of both vdWHs reduce sharply compared with that of each monolayer. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (d), the bandgaps of GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs are 0.88 and 0.69 eV (see Table 1) with indirect bandgaps with the VBM at K and the CBM at M points, respectively.
 Fig. 2  (a) Projected electronic bandstructures, (b) projected density of states (PDOS), and (c) plane-averaged differential charge densities Δρ(z) along the z-direction for the GeC/SeSnS vdWH, obtained at the HSE06 level. Partial charge density for the CBM (cyan) and VBM (yellow) states are presented as insets in the PDOS plot, where the value of the isosurface is chosen as 0.005 eV Å−1. (d, e, and f) is the same as (a, b, and c), but for GeC/SSnSe vdWH. The positive (red) and negative (blue) values indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
To further understand the electronic properties of the vdWHs, we then project bandstructures and density of states (PDOS) to each layer, as plotted in Fig. 2(a, b, d, and e). Two vdWHs share similar characters, e.g., the CBM originates from the Janus layer, whereas the GeC layer contributes to the VBM. Such results are consistent with our calculated PDOS, which further demonstrates the type-II nature of the vdWHs. Note that the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes plays a significant role in an efficient photocatalyst. Therefore, we further examine the charge distribution of the VBM and CBM. The electron wave function of the VBM resides mainly on the GeC layer, while that of the CBM mainly stems from the Janus layer, which coincides with the above analysis of the projected bandstructures and PDOS. Indeed, the type-II band alignment formed at the vdWH interface can facilitate the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to a low electron–hole recombination efficiency and facilitating the application of these vdWHs in photocatalytic water splitting.
Furthermore, we analyze the charge transfer between GeC and SnSSe monolayers. The plane-averaged differential charge density (Δρ(z)) along the z-direction is calculated as: Δρ = (ρGeC/SnSSe − ρGeC − ρSnSSe),(2)where ρGeC/SnSSe, ρGeC, and ρSnSSe are the plane-averaged charge densities of vdWH, GeC, and SnSSe monolayers, respectively. In Fig. 2(c) and (f), we plot the Δρ(z) along the z-direction of the two configurations, and the positive (red) and negative (blue) values indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. In each vdWH, the electrons are majorly accumulated in the Janus layer, whereas depleted in the GeC layer. Bader charge analysis54,55 shows there are 0.081 (0.113) electrons transferring from the GeC to SeSnS (SSnSe) layer. Such small quantities of transferred charge further indicate weak interactions between the GeC and SnSSe monolayers, resulting in the formation of the interfacial electric field (Eint).
3.3. Effective electric field
Before discussing the interfacial electric field in the vdWHs, we first check the electrostatic potential distributions along the z-direction in the isolated SnSSe monolayer as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The different chalcogen atoms induce an intrinsic electric field (ESnSSe) pointing from the Se surface to the S surface, inducing an electrostatic potential difference of about 0.345 eV. Such a feature benefits the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In addition, the work function (defined as the energy difference between vacuum energy Evac and Fermi energy level EF) of the individual SnSSe monolayer is much higher than that of GeC. Hence, once either the GeC/SeSnS or GeC/SSnSe vdWH forms, and electrons can spontaneously transfer from the GeC layer to the SnSSe layer. With the charge transfer process proceeding, the EF of SeSnS (SSnSe) goes up, while that of GeC shifts down. Then they get closer and closer. Eventually, a crossover between them occurs, see the inset in the lower right-hand corner of Fig. 3(a) (Fig. 3(b)), obeying Anderson's rules.56 The resulting interfacial electric field (Eint) pointing away GeC towards SnSSe also consistently demonstrates itself in the higher electrostatic potential on the Janus side and the lower one on the GeC side, as depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b). Notably, the electrostatic potential distributions, globe work functions (−5.99 eV for GeC/SeSnS vdWH versus −5.52 eV for GeC/SSnSe vdWH), and interfacial dipole moments depend strongly on the stacking manners (Se or S surface facing the GeC layer). The underlying mechanism can be understood as follows. For GeC/SeSnS vdWH, there is a big electrostatic potential slope at the interface region, resulting in a large net effective electric field (Eeff), pointing to the SeSnS layer from the GeC layer, due to the same direction of ESnSSe and Eint. This intrinsic electric field increases the interlayer coupling and facilitates the electron transfer from the GeC to the SeSnS layer. As a result, the electrostatic potential of the GeC layer is 0.654 eV lower than that of the SeSnS layer see the inset in the lower left-hand corner of Fig. 3(a). Contrastingly, the electrostatic potential difference in the GeC/SSnSe vdWH is only 0.159 eV much smaller than that of the previous system as shown in the lower left-hand corner inset of Fig. 3(b). The reduction in ΔΦ is attributed to the fact that the interfacial electric field has been partially counteracted by the intrinsic polarization of the SnSSe layer, which can decrease the dipole moment. Therefore, stacking manners dominate the electrostatic potential of these vdWHs.

The horizontal arrow indicates the total built-in electric field from GeC to SeSnS or SSnSe. 
3.4. Direct Z-scheme photocatalysis
To further explore the potential applications of the Janus vdWHs as the photocatalysts, we perform the band alignment analysis for these vdWHs and monolayers relative to the redox potential of water, see Fig. 3(c) and (d), and Fig. S4.† The CBM and VBM of an individual GeC can only straddle the reduction potential (H+/H2). Hence, the GeC monolayer is only suitable for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In contrast, the individual SnSSe's CBM is lower than the reduction potential of water, so the HER cannot occur in the case of a single SnSSe. It only serves for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), see Fig. S4.† Hence, neither GeC nor SnSSe alone can realize overall water splitting.
When GeC/SnSSe vdWHs are irradiated under visible light, both constituents can absorb photons with energy greater than their corresponding bandgaps, exciting the electrons from VBs to CBs, while leaving holes in the VBs. Due to the effective interlayer field pointing towards the Janus layer, as indicated by the red horizontal arrows in Fig. 3, and the small energy separation between the VBs of the GeC and the CBs of SnSSe, the photogenerated electrons in SnSSe will migrate to the VBs of the GeC layer to annihilate the photogenerated holes there. Then there are more photogenerated electrons (holes) than holes (electrons) in the GeC (SnSSe) layer. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons lying in the CBs of GeC can realize the HER, meanwhile the photogenerated holes residing in the SnSSe layer can realize the OER. Therefore, the GeC/SnSSe vdWH is a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for water splitting. The spatial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes suppresses the energy loss due to the electron–hole recombination process. Consequently, the catalytic capability will be notably enhanced. Thus, both Janus vdWHs can serve as noble-metal-free direct Z-scheme photocatalysts. Furthermore, positive kinetic overpotentials (ΔEV and ΔEC) are necessary to drive the redox reaction. And the value of ΔEV and ΔEC would directly affect the photocatalytic efficiency and the number of active electrons and holes for overall water splitting.
Usually the pH value of the aqueous solutions affects considerably the efficiency of the photocatalytic water splitting process. Thus, most photocatalysts for water splitting are only active in a certain water environment such as acidic or neutral, or alkaline water. To gain complete insight into the GeC/SnSSe vdWH based photocatalytic water splitting, we investigate the effect of pH of the aqueous solutions on standard potential of oxidation and reduction reactions, using the Nernst equation:57 (3) (4)

Fig. 4 displays band alignments of GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs for four different pH values of aqueous solution. The redox potentials of water are located between the CBM and VBM for all four pH values in the cases of GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs. For individual monolayers (GeC and SnSSe), the situation changes. So, it is interesting to note that for the pH in the range of 0 to 10, the band edges of the vdWHs always meet the requirement for photocatalytic water splitting. Therefore, both GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs can be used as photocatalysts for water splitting under acidic, neutral, and even alkaline water environments.
 Fig. 4  Band edge alignments of GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs under diverse pH values. As a reference, the band edges of the corresponding individual monolayers (GeC and SnSSe) are also displayed. The data are obtained at the HSE06 level. The blue and red solid lines correspond to the band edge of the CBM and VBM, respectively. The dashed lines with different colors represent the redox potential of water at different pH. 
3.5. Optical properties and solar-to-hydrogen conversion
The optical absorption properties are essential for efficient solar energy harvesting materials. So, we carry out the calculation for the optical absorption coefficients of both vdWHs using the following equation:49,58 (5)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show that not only the GeC and SnSSe monolayers, but also the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs possess a broad range of optical absorption from the ultraviolet to visible, even to infrared, with an optical absorption intensity of about 105 cm−1. However, the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs host larger optical absorption coefficients than that of their constituent monolayers in the visible light region. Moreover, the charge transfer, interlayer coupling, and the hybridization of the electronic states between the two layers in the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs lead to a redshift of their absorption spectrum edge relative to that of the individual monolayers, which favors the visible light utilization.

The α in (a) GeC and SeSnS monolayers, and GeC/SeSnS vdWH, (b) GeC and SSnSe monolayers, and GeC/SSnSe vdWH, (c) GeC/SeSnS vdWH with different biaxial strain, (d) the same as (c) but for GeC/SSnSe vdWH. In (c) and (d), the α in the corresponding sample without strain (light orange filling) is also plotted, serving as a reference. The insets denote an enlarged view of α around the absorption edge. The data are obtained at the HSE06 level. 
Under biaxial strain, it was interesting to find that the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs maintain a type-II band alignment. And they are still the direct Z-scheme photocatalysts. However, mechanical deformations such as biaxial strain have a significant effect on the bandstructures and optical properties of GeC/SnSSe vdWHs, see Fig. S5–S7,† and Fig. 5. This may be attributed to the strain-induced change of the bandstructures of an individual material (GeC, SnSSe), interfacial distances, and interlayer couplings. As a whole, the compressive strain makes a more significant impact on the bandstructure than the tensile strains. The former shifts the CB edge upward notably and the VB edge downward slightly, leading to the enlarged bandgap. Under −4% compressive strain, the bandgap of GeC/SeSnS vdWH increases from 0.88 to 1.03 eV, changing by 17%. This leads to a blueshift on the absorption spectra, which reduces the effective absorption of lights of AM1.5G. In contrast, the tensile strain shifts the CB edge downward slightly and the VB edge upward notably, ultimately leading to a reduced bandgap. Under 4% tensile strain, the bandgap GeC/SeSnS vdWH decreases from 0.88 to 0.81 eV, changing by 8%. Therefore, the tensile strain induces a redshift and enhances the effective absorption, increasing the photocatalytic performance of water splitting for the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs. In brief, the sizable variation in the band edge positions, bandgaps as well as optical absorption indicates that the photocatalysis properties of the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs could be well-tuned by the in-plane biaxial strain.
As is known, the STH conversion efficiency is a vital character for applications. To improve it, one has to enhance hydrogen productivity and/or reduce the loss of solar energy. Next, we make a quantitative analysis of the STH process for the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs. The STH efficiency (ηSTH) is obtained as:59 ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu(6)where the ηabs and ηcu stand for the optical absorption and carrier utilization efficiency, respectively. Among them, ηabs is obtained as: (7)where Eg is the bandgap of the photocatalyst, and P(ħω) is the AM1.5G solar flux at the photon energy ħω. On the other hand, the efficiency of carrier utilization ηcu is defined as: (8)where ΔG is the potential difference of 1.23 eV for water splitting and E is the minimum energy of photons that can actually be utilized for water splitting. Due to the energy loss during carrier migration between different materials, the kinetic overpotentials required for the HER and OER are assumed to be ΔEC = 0.2 eV and ΔEV = 0.6 eV, respectively.60,61 With the values of Eg, ΔEC, and ΔEV at hand, the E can be determined as follows: (9)
Since the intrinsic electric field favors the electron–hole separation, considering this effect, then the STH efficiency becomes: (10)where ΔΦ is the electrostatic potential difference between the GeC and SnSSe surfaces, respectively.
Assuming that the optical absorption efficiency, carrier separation efficiency, and quantum efficiency are all 100%, the STH efficiencies in GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs are equal to 63.99% and 74.99% (see Table 2) much higher than that in the GeC monolayer. In order to incorporate the intrinsic electric field effects, we have made a correction for the STH efficiency based on eqn (10). The corrected STH efficiencies of GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs become 47.74% and 68.37%, respectively. It is worth recalling that these two STH efficiencies, especially the latter, are superior to many other reported vdWH structures, e.g., MoSe2/SnSe2 (10.5%), WSe2/SnSe2 (9.3%),62 PtS2/arsenene (49.32%),63 and MoTe2/BAs (56.32%).64 Therefore, GeC/SnSSe vdWHs are promising direct Z-scheme photocatalysts.

3.6. Photovoltaic devices
After studying the photocatalysts, let us focus our attention on the photovoltaic properties. They are studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function combined with the density functional theory (NEGF + DFT) method implanted in QuantumATK software.65,66 The electron–photon interaction is treated as a perturbation. The total Hamiltonian is expressed as: (11)

Ĥ
0, Â, and  are the self-consistent Hamiltonian without the electron–light interaction, polarization vector of the light, and momentum, respectively. The photocurrent (Jph) can be expressed as:67 (12)where Γ is the line-width function, and G(>/<)ph represents the greater/smaller Green's function, including electron–photon interaction.68 The photoresponsivity (Rph) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) are respectively defined as: (13)and (14)where Fph denotes the flux describing the number of photons irradiated per unit area per unit time, h, c, and λ are Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the wavelength of light, respectively.
We designed two nanoscale model junctions based on GeC/SnSSe vdWHs as central scattering areas as shown in Fig. 6(a) and set positive and negative doping levels in the left and right parts using a concentration of 1013 e cm−2, forming p–n junctions. Then we calculated the photocurrents by assuming that the central scattering region is illuminated by a linearly polarized light with a power of 16 μW mm−2. The total photocurrent densities are obtained from the current at each photon energy (see in Fig. 6(b)) weighted by the flux of the AM1.5G standard solar spectrum.69 The calculated (Jph) is up to 9.67 and 10.43 μA mm−2 for GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs-based devices, respectively.

Photocurrent densities in (b) GeC/SnSSe vdWHs illuminated by a linearly polarized light with a power of 16 μW mm−2 as a function of photon energy. (c) Strain evolution of total photocurrents in the GeC/SSnSe (blue) and GeC/SeSnS (red) vdWHs illuminated by the AM1.5G standard solar spectra. 
Based on the data shown in Fig. 6(b), we evaluate photoresponsivities (Rph) characterizing the efficiency of energy conversion for the two vdWHs. We find that GeC/SnSSe vdWHs have a maximum responsivity up to 0.1 A W−1 around 3.0 eV, which is superior to that of graphene (10−4 A W−1)70 and MoS2 (0.016 A W−1).71 The upper limits of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceed 31% and 29% for GeC/SeSnS and GeC/SSnSe vdWHs, respectively. Such excellent photoresponsivity and external quantum efficiency indicate the great potential of GeC/SnSSe vdWHs in photovoltaic applications.
The sizable tunability of the total photocurrent in the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs is displayed in Fig. 6(c). Interestingly, increasing photocurrent can be acquired for the GeC/SnSSe vdWHs when the biaxial strain is varied from −4% to 4%. The photocurrent is related to the effective light absorption tuned by strains. The tensile strain increases the effective light absorption and then enhances the photocurrent. In contrast, the compressive strain decreases the effective absorption and decreases the photocurrent. More importantly, in GeC/SeSnS vdWH, the photocurrent increases as high as 40% at a tensile strain of 4%. Thus, we can conclude that the total photocurrents of GeC/SnSSe vdWHs can be modulated by strain engineering, which provides a rational design for the tunable photovoltaic properties.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we report our first-principles, optical property, and quantum transport calculations about GeC/SnSSe vdWHs. We find that both vdWHs with opposite stacking manners can be utilized as direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for water splitting. Unlike the traditional direct Z-scheme photocatalyst, the GeC/SnSSe vdWH possesses a small energy separation between the low conduction band located in SnSSe and high valence band residing in the GeC layer, which fosters significantly the interlayer charge transfer. Hence, its solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency reaches as high as 68.37%, superior to that reported in the literature to date. In addition, both the optical absorption and photocurrent demonstrate sizable strain tunability. The bifunctionality together with high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency and high environmental stability make GeC/SnSSe vdWHs promising in clean and renewable energy applications. Therefore, our discovery is not only fundamentally intriguing to gain new insight into direct Z-scheme photocatalysts, but also practically appealing.
