    , Accepted 24th July 2020First published on 24th July 2020AbstractA novel two-dimensional (2D) oxysulfide, Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10, with a band gap of 1.34 eV was successfully synthesized. The device exhibits notable current density enhancement under irradiation (Jlight/Jdark = 38.7 at 10 V) as well as a steady and reversible on/off switching mode.
Semiconductor-based solar cells are a promising candidate for low-cost photovoltaics. Active exploration of new semiconductors is an essential approach to higher photoconversion efficiency. In the past few decades, many semiconductors such as GaAs,1 CdTe,2 Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS),3 and hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI34 have been developed as the absorber in solar cells. However, these absorbers suffer from their own weaknesses, like high cost of the raw elements (In in CIGS; Te in CdTe), high toxicity of As in GaAs and instability of the hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.5 Therefore, it is necessary to explore new earth-abundant and stable materials for solar absorption. Recently, 2D photoelectronic materials such as layered hybrid perovskites,6 chalcogenides,7,8 and mixed-anionic compounds9,10 have attracted increasing attention due to their efficient in-plane charge carrier transport and high stability, which has inspired the design of new low-dimensional photovoltaic materials.
The lead antimony sulfide (Pb–Sb–S) system is a new source of absorber material for solar cells.11–15 The np orbitals of p-block metal Pb and Sb benefit the large optical absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) of Pb–Sb–S materials.15,16 The Pb–Sb–S system possesses a complex phase diagram with at least 18 identified compounds.11 Among these materials, the plagionite group with a general formula of Pb9−xSb8S21−2x provides four species with suitable band gaps for photovoltaics, namely Pb9Sb8S21 (1.50 eV), Pb7Sb8S19 (1.41 eV), Pb5Sb8S17 (1.53 eV), and Pb3Sb8S15 (1.63 eV).17,18 Taking Pb5Sb8S17 as an example, it features a 3D crystal structure constructed by highly distorted [PbSx] (x = 4, 6) and [SbSx] (x = 3–5) polyhedra, as shown in Fig. 1a. Pb5Sb8S17 has already been used as the absorber in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells, while the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low (1.76% under 1 sun, 6.0% under 5% sun) at this stage.12,14 The low PCE originated not only from the unformed device manufacturing technology, but also the intrinsic drawback of the absorber material. Its complex crystal structure may result in excessive defects and lattice distortion, which ultimately cause trapping and scattering of the photoinduced charge carrier, facilitating the electron/hole recombination. Reorganizing the Pb–Sb–S motif to a more regular structure can be effective to achieve better photoelectric performance in this system.

In this work, alkali earth metal ion Sr2+ and anionic O2− are selected as templates to reconstruct the Pb–Sb–S motif. We have successfully developed several new 2D materials (SrOCuSbQ2 (Q = S, Se), SrOCuBiSe2) containing highly ionic [SrO] electronic insulating layers (EILs) and covalent chalcogenide charge transport layers (CTLs).19–21 The efficient in-plane charge transport in the CTLs makes them potential photoelectric or thermoelectric materials. Herein, a new 2D oxysulfide Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 containing regular Sb2Se3-type [PbSbS3]− layers as CTLs was successfully obtained. It possesses an optical band gap of 1.34 eV and notable enhancement of current density under irradiation.
The rod-shape Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 crystals were first synthesized via a solid state reaction of SrO, PbO, Sb2S3 and PbS at 650 °C. The single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated that it represents a novel structure type and crystallizes in the space group P21/m (no. 11) of the monoclinic system (Table S1, ESI†). The asymmetric unit contains one crystallographically unique Sr site, one Sr/Pb site (occupancy: Sr 75%, Pb 25%), two Sb/Pb sites (occupancy: Sb1 31%, Pb1 69%; Sb2 69%, Pb2 31%), two Sb sites, three O sites (O3 site is half occupied) and five S sites. The selected bond lengths, atomic coordinates, equivalent isotropic displacement parameters and anisotropic displacement parameters are shown in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†).
Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 exhibits a layered structure simplified as [ELF][SbPbS3]. It is constructed by Sb2Se3-type [SbPbS3]− layers and distorted PbO-type [SrSbO2]+ layers, intercalated by [Sb2OS2]4− pseudo-chains and mix-occupied Sr2+/Pb2+ ions (Fig. 1a). In [SbPbS3]− layers the [Sb/PbS6] octahedra are connected with each other via edge sharing (Fig. 1b). The Sb/Pb–S bond lengths are in the range of 2.510–3.281 Å, which are comparable with those in binary Sb2S3 (2.456–3.167 Å) and PbS (2.968 Å), as well as in ternary Pb5Sb8S17 (Pb–S: 2.745–3.164 Å, Sb–S: 2.436–3.266 Å)22 and Pb9Sb8S21 (Pb–S: 2.611–3.267 Å, Sb–S: 2.611–3.157 Å).23 The relatively long bond lengths of Sb1/Pb1–S4 and Sb2/Pb2–S3 represent the existence of a ns2-lone pair, which results in a loose-packing structure. The PbO-type [SrSbO2]+ layer is highly distorted caused by the significant difference between Sb–O (1.924–2.194 Å) and Sr–O (2.491–2.753 Å). The [SbO4]5− square pyramids interconnect by edge sharing, forming a chain stretching along the b axis (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a and b, ESI†). The [Sb2OS2]4− pseudo-chains are composed of [SbOS2]3− motifs joined by half-occupied O3 (Fig. 1d). The Sr1/Pb3 site possesses a seven-fold coordination with S atoms. The Sr1/Pb3–S bond lengths are in the range of 3.054–3.202 Å (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The loosing-packing crystal structure of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 can be reflected by a low packing factor (PF) of 0.53, which is lower than those of the reported photoelectric oxysulfides (0.66 for Bi2O2S, 0.64 for Bi9O7.5S6, 0.56 for SrOCuSbS2).20,24,25 In the low-PF materials there exists a strong momentary polarizing field which benefits efficient charge separation.26–30 This indicates the great potential of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 for photoelectric conversion applications.
Phase purity of the polycrystalline sample was clarified by comparing the experimental PXRD pattern with the simulated one, as shown in Fig. 2a. The experimental pattern matches well with the simulated one. The SEM/EDS mapping images and the ideal morphology on the basis of Bravais–Friedel and Donnay–Harker (BFDH)31,32 theory are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). All the five elements distribute uniformly conformed by EDS mapping analysis. The thermal behavior of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 was investigated using DSC-TGA analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†). The DSC cycle curves present a single endothermic peak at 665 °C on heating in the first cycle, along with a significant weight loss emerged by TGA. No obvious exothermic peak was observed on cooling. The endothermic peak at 665 °C becomes weaker in the second cycle. These results indicate that Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 melts incongruently. The XPS measurements reveal that the oxidation states of the elements in Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 are Sr2+, Pb2+, Sb3+, O2− and S2−, respectively (Fig. 2b and Fig. S4, Table S5, ESI†). The split Sb 3d3/2 (538.84 eV and 539.38 eV) and Sb 3d5/2 (529.45 eV and 530.12 eV) peaks indicate the different anions around Sb. The electronegative O2− in Sb–O bonds causes higher binding energy of Sb 3d compared with those in Sb–S bonds.

The optical absorption properties of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The absorption edge near 800 nm is consistent with the black color of the polycrystalline sample (Fig. 3a), indicating the semiconducting nature. The band gap value (Eg) was identified by an extrapolation method converted from the absorption spectrum (inset of Fig. 3a). The Eg of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 is 1.34 eV, which is near the optimal Eg (1.4 eV) for photoelectric applications. It is also close to the band gap of the plagionite group in the Pb–Sb–S system. The electrical resistivity measurements were performed in the range of 2–300 K (Fig. 3b). The resistivity increases rapidly with falling temperature, indicating thermally activated charge transport character. This confirms the semiconducting nature of this material. Three classical models for semiconducting transport, the Arrhenius dependence ρ(T) = ρ0exp(Ea/kBT) (ρ0 is a pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant.), the small polaron hopping (SPH) model (expressed as ρ(T)/T ∝ exp(Ep/kBT), Ep is activation energy) and the variable range hopping model (VRH) (expressed as ρ(T) ∝ exp(T0/T)1/4, T0 is characteristic temperature) were used to fit the curve (inset of Fig. 3b and Fig. S5, ESI†). The lnρ–T−1/4 curve shows a linear dependence (R2 = 99.8%) in the range of 50–265 K, which gives T0 = 13 K in the VRH model.

The semiconducting nature of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 with an optimal Eg (1.34 eV) implies its potential photoelectric properties. The photoelectric response of the Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10-based device (Fig. S6, ESI†) was measured under visible light irradiation at room temperature. The linear dependences of the magnified J–V curve in the dark indicate the ohm contact of the device (Fig. S7, ESI†). The current density versus voltage curves (J–V) in the dark and under illumination are depicted in Fig. 3c. Remarkably, the photocurrent density (Jlight) of the device shows significant increment to that of dark current density (Jdark). The drop casted film processes Jlight = 2.1 nA cm−2 with 1 V bias, which is 5.3-fold that of Jdark (0.4 nA cm−2). With the increase of bias voltage, the Jlight shows more obvious enhancement, achieving 38.7-fold that of the Jdark at 10 V. The Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10-based device exhibits a better photoelectric response than the CuSbS2-based device fabricated by a similar method.33 The current density enhancement (Jlight/Jdark) is also larger than the photoelectric devices based on other semiconductors such as KCu2SbS3 (Jlight/Jdark = 1.8, 1 V),34 SrOCuSbS2 (2.3, 1 V),20 Ba5Bi2Co2S10 (2.0, 1 V),35 Sr0.8Pb0.2CuSbS3 (3.5, 3 V),36 Bi9O7.5S6 (2.1, 1 V),24 and Bi2O2S (2.0, 10 V).25 On/off photocurrents were also measured with 10 V bias, as shown in Fig. 3d. The switching current is steady and reversible with an “on” state of 67 nA cm−2 and an “off” state of 2.7 nA cm−2. These results indicate that Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10 is a new candidate for the photoelectric conversion.
In order to investigate the electronic structure of Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10, first-principles calculations were performed using an ordered structure model (Fig. S8, ESI†) to represent the half-occupied O site, and the mixed-occupied Sb/Pb and Sr/Pb sites. In the as-built 1 × 2 × 1 Sr7Pb5Sb12O10S20 supercell, the [SbS6] chains and [PbS6] chains are arranged at intervals and extend along the a axis in the Sb2Se3-type [SbPbS3]− layers. The O3 sites are fully occupied to form [Sb2OS2]4− bi-triangular clusters. The electronic band structure is shown in Fig. 4a. The valence band maximum (VBM) is located between Γ and Z, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located between D and M, indicating the indirect-band-gap character of Sr7Pb5Sb12O10S20. It is noteworthy that the electron transition energy of Γ to Γ (the blue arrow, Eg = 1.45 eV) is close to that of the VBM to CBM (the red arrow, Eg = 1.41 eV). This quasi-direct-band-gap character implies a large optical absorption coefficient. The total density of states (DOS) and those of specific elements are shown in Fig. 4b. The electron transition mainly occurs in the Pb–S and Sb–S orbitals, while the Sr and O states make little contribution to the band edges. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the VBM is mainly composed of S 3p states, whereas the CBM is dominantly contributed by Sb 5p states and Pb 6p states. The O 2p states are mainly distributed below −1.5 eV. The densities of the Sb 5s and Pb 6s states are located near the VBM, indicating lone-pair character of these electrons. The partial DOS of Sb1 and Sb2 in the Sb2Se3-type [SbPbS3]− layers, as well as Sb3 in the [Sb2OS2]4− bi-triangular clusters are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The density of 5p states of Sb1 and Sb2 are higher than that of Sb3. Thus, the electronic structure of Sr7Pb5Sb12O10S20 near the Fermi level is dominated by the highly covalent [SbPbS3]− layers which act as CTLs.

Conclusions
In summary, Sr3.5Pb2.5Sb6O5S10, a new 2D oxysulfide with suitable band gap for photoelectric conversion was designed and synthesized via a solid state reaction. Single-crystal XRD analysis indicates that it exhibits a layered structure stacked by Sb2Se3-type [SbPbS3]− layers and distorted PbO-type [SrSbO2]+ layers, intercalated by [Sb2OS2]4− pseudo-chains and mixed-occupied Sr2+/Pb2+ ions. PXRD analysis confirms the phase purity of the polycrystalline product, and the oxidation states of elements are determined by XPS. The optical absorption and electrical resistivity measurements reveal the semiconducting nature of this compound, with a well-defined optical band gap of 1.34 eV. The quasi-direct-band-gap electronic structure near the Fermi level is dominated by the highly covalent [SbPbS3]− layers. The film device exhibits notable enhancement of the current density under irradiation (Jlight/Jdark = 38.7), as well as the steady and reversible On/off switching mode, suggesting its potential for applications of photoelectric conversion.
