    AbstractFixation of a 5-hexyl-2,2′-bithienyl unit on a conjugated BODIPY donor increases the conversion efficiency of the resulting molecular bulk heterojunction solar cells from 1.30 to 2.20%.
Thin-film organic solar cells are attracting considerable current interest motivated by the possibility to develop cost-effective energy sources by simple and low-environmental impact technologies.1–13 Donor–acceptor bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) combining soluble fullerene derivatives and conjugated polymers are the most efficient devices reported so far.3,4 However, conjugated polymers pose various problems related to the control of their structural regularity, molecular weight, polydispersity, end-group defects and batch to batch variations. Recently an alternative approach based on the use of soluble small molecules as donor material has been proposed.5–13 In fact, molecular donors present some specific advantages in terms of structural definition, reproducibility of synthesis and purification. Although initial prototypes of molecular BHJ exhibited modest performances,6 considerable progress has been achieved in a short time.7–13 Thus, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.40% has recently been reported for a cell based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor.8 Owing to a better absorption of visible light, C70 derivatives contribute to improving the PCE of solar cells compared to the most widely used C60-based parent compound (PC61BM).9 However, in order to compare new donors to already known results, it is necessary to refer to a standard acceptor material. In this context, it is noteworthy that only a few molecular donors have led to PCE higher than 2.00% with PC61BM as acceptor i.e. oligothiophene-DPP,9 benzothiadiazole vinylene compounds,10 merocyanines,11 and dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophenes.12
We have recently described the first examples of BHJ based on borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) donors.13 A PCE of 1.34% was obtained with a donor involving two styryl units (1), and 1.70% for a multi-donor cell.13 As shown by this latter result, the structural versatility of BODIPY makes it a particularly interesting platform for the design of new donors as it should in principle make it possible to tune parameters such as light-harvesting, open-circuit voltage or charge-transport with much less interdependence than in conjugated polymers.
In this context, we report here on a new BODIPY donor (2) in which a 5-hexyl-2,2′-bithienyl (BT) unit has been attached to the axial phenyl ring of compound 1. It was anticipated that the introduction of this short oligothiophene block could improve the hole-transport properties, as observed for other classes of compounds.14  
Compound 2 was synthesized in three steps as depicted in Scheme 1. A Stille cross-coupling of 615 with the stannic derivative 516 gave compound 4 in 95% yield. A Knoevenagel reaction using a dedicated aldehyde and established protocols17 gave 3 in 61% isolated yield. The last step uses a Grignard reagent to replace the fluorine atoms by a flexible ethynyl-residue18 affording 2 in 95% yield. As shown by 1H NMR, the 16.2 Hz proton–proton coupling constant for the vinyl-based signals is in keeping with the expected E configuration of the double bonds.‡

Thanks to the non-coplanarity of the axial phenyl ring with the main π-conjugated system and further twist angle associated with the thiophene–phenyl linkage, the BT group is expected to have a small impact on the electronic properties of the distyryl BODIPY system.

Table 1 compares the main optical and electrochemical data of compounds 1 and 2. Both compounds present high molecular extinction coefficients (εmax > 120000 M−1 cm−1). The UV-Vis absorption spectra present two absorption bands with maxima around 370 and 650 nm, slightly red shifted for compound 2.

Dye 2 is highly fluorescent (λem = 661 nm) with a higher quantum yield than compound 1 (ϕem = 0.63 vs. 0.46) and an excited state lifetime of 5.44 ns typical of a singlet emitter. The spectra of films cast on glass show a slight broadening of the absorption bands and red shift of λmax from 649 to 672 nm for 2 (see ESI†). The two compounds show quasi-identical spectra with, however, a slight intensification of the 370 nm band for compound 2 presumably due to the contribution of the BT chain. In both cases the low energy absorption edge leads to an optical band gap (Eg) of 1.70 eV.
Cyclic voltammetry shows that both compounds are reversibly oxidized and reduced through one-electron processes. A slight positive shift (50 mV) of the oxidation and reduction potential E0ox and E0red is observed for compound 2, confirming the small impact of the BT chain on the HOMO and LUMO levels of the conjugated system.
BHJ cells were realized by spin-casting chloroform solutions of compound 2 and PC61BM on ITO-coated glass substrates pre-coated with a 40 nm layer of PEDOT-PSS. A cursory optimization of the donor/acceptor ratio and cell thickness showed that the best results were obtained with in a 1:2 weight ratio (4 mg and 8 mg mL−1) donor 2:PC61BM and a cell thickness of ∼100 nm corresponding to an absorbance of ∼0.30 at 670 nm (see SI†).

Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of a cell based on donor 2 and the corresponding incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectrum. A first band peaking at 45% in the 350–500 nm region corresponds to the first absorption band of the donor with some contribution of PC61BM while a second band with a maximum of 36% covers the 550–730 nm region. Comparison with a cell based on donor 1 reveals an intensification of the IPCE for donor 2 but no significant difference in the spectral distribution (see SI†).

Fig. 2 shows the current density (J) vs. voltage (V) characteristics of a cell based on donor 2 under simulated solar illumination in AM 1.5 conditions. A clear rectification behaviour is observed in the dark. As expected, the open-circuit voltage (Voc = 0.75 V) is identical to that of cells based on compound 1. However, the short-circuit current density shows a strong increase from 4.40 to 7.00 mA cm−2. With a fill factor of 0.38 this leads to an increase of PCE from 1.34 to 2.17%.

Taking into account the very similar optical and electrochemical data of donors 1 and 2, and hence the fact the improved efficiency is not related to an increase of Voc nor of the light-harvesting properties the large increase of Jsc suggests that the BT side chain could contribute to improve the hole-transport properties of the donor.
In order to confirm this point, “hole only” devices ITO/Baytron/donor/Au have been fabricated and hole mobility (μh) has been measured by the space charge limited current technique giving μh values of 5.10 × 10−5 and 9.70 × 10−5 V cm−2 s−1 for 1 and 2, respectively (see SI†). These results confirm that the BT chain contributes to improve the hole-transport properties of the donor. Powder X-ray diffraction data of thin films of the two donors cast on glass from chloroform solutions show that whereas donor 1 is amorphous, films of donor 2 present some crystallinity (see SI†) which is consistent with the observed larger hole mobility.
To summarize, a BODIPY chromophore with covalently attached BT chain has been synthesized. Preliminary results on solar cells reveal a large increase of current density and a conversion efficiency of ∼2.20% which ranks among the highest reported to date for molecular BHJ based on PC61BM acceptor. Optical, electrochemical and electrical data support the conclusion that this structural modification has little effect on the energy levels and light-harvesting properties of the donor but improves its charge-transport properties. Of course, other parameters such as interfacial morphology, exciton diffusion length or charge recombination can also be affected by this structural modification and further work in this direction is needed.
Work focused on the fabrication of cells with PC71BM as acceptor and on the synthesis of other oligothiophene–BODIPY hybrid systems is now underway and will be reported in future publications.
