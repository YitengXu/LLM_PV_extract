    , Accepted 23rd February 2018First published on 23rd February 2018AbstractAn acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) triad based on a BODIPY acceptor and a benzodithiophene donor exhibited dual fluorescence and pronounced fluorescence solvatochromism because of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state formation. Furthermore, it showed a Stokes shift of ∼194 nm which is the highest known for any BODIPY compound with a readily tunable fluorescence and a high charge carrier mobility of 4.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Molecular design of twisted donor–acceptor (D–A) systems largely governs their photophysical properties in solution1–4 such as excimer formation,2 twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states5,6 and aggregate induced emission (AIE).7–11 Excimer emission in BODIPY12 based D–A molecules and their dimeric systems has been vastly explored.2,13 Depending upon the geometry and twisting of their D–A backbone and their decoupling by spacer units, they show intense solvatochromism14,15 as well as exciplex formation,16,17 mechanofluorochromism,18,19 AIE7 or TICT states.20 Hence, judicious molecular engineering of the D–A system with a spacer unit that decouples the donor and acceptor should lead to new fluorescent probes with interesting photophysical phenomena such as TICT and AIE. The TICT property can be exploited for designing new materials with potential applications in chemosensors, in lighting and display such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),21–23 nonlinear optics24 and optical waveguides. Moreover, such systems could have potential applications in biomedical imaging25 and optoelectronic devices such as in organic photovoltaics (OPV).26
Benzodithiophene (BDT) is an interesting candidate for OPV applications owing to its planar structure, deep lying HOMO levels and reportedly high hole mobilities as well as high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic and polymer solar cells.27–29 Recently, we reported regioisomeric D–A triads based on BDT donors and BODIPY acceptors, T1 and T2 (Fig. 1) that showed efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and possess appreciable charge carrier mobilities.30 D–A systems composed of BDT and BODIPY usually absorb in the ultraviolet (UV) and the visible region with a spectral coverage of up to ∼700 nm as a result of intramolecular charge transfer.13 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that their optical and redox properties can be extensively tuned either by changing substituents or by tuning the coupling position of the BDT donor at either the meso position or at α/β positions of BODIPY. But reports of BODIPY based TICT and AIE systems are rather scarce.31,32

Herein, we report the design, synthesis and photophysical properties of a new acceptor–donor–acceptor triad system A–D–A (Fig. 1) based on a BODIPY acceptor and a BDT donor whereby the BODIPY units are attached through their meso positions and are decoupled from the donor units by two flexible phenyl spacers. We intend to study the optical properties of A–D–A compared to the previously studied D–A–D compounds that showed efficient PET.30 The photophysical properties of the A–D–A triad were investigated using steady state absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetimes and solvatochromism. Moreover, the charge carrier mobility of this material was investigated in order to assess its suitability for optoelectronic applications.
The synthesis of A–D–A was carried out as outlined in Scheme 1. BODIPY 4 was synthesized starting from 4-bromobenzaldehyde and pyrrole in the presence of catalytic amounts of HCl in an aqueous medium according to a reported procedure34,35 for a different dipyrromethane (DPM) compound. However, it is to be noted here that this reaction in an aqueous medium has not been used earlier for the synthesis of DPM 3 and BODIPY 4 to the best of our knowledge. This method34 was advantageous in terms of yield (78%) compared to the conventional route of the condensation of pyrrole with aldehyde in the presence of catalytic amounts of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Distannylated BDT (5) was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure (see the ESI†).33 The synthesis of A–D–A was achieved by the Stille coupling of 422 (2 eq.) and 5 in dry toluene with catalytic amounts of tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium(0) Pd2(dba)3 and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine P(o-tol)328 and A–D–A was isolated in 56% yield (see the ESI† for details).

Fig. 2 shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra of model acceptor and donor compounds 4 and 5 and the triad A–D–A in dichloromethane (DCM). The donor 5 has an absorption maximum at 372 nm while the absorption maximum for the acceptor 4 occurs at 504 nm. The absorption spectrum of A–D–A is merely the sum of D and A absorption i.e., absorption maxima at 315 nm and 380 nm for the BDT donor and at 503 nm for the BODIPY unit, indicative of no electronic communication between the donor and acceptor components.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of A–D–A were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) method using the Gaussian 09 package by the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method.36 For A–D–A, the HOMO is entirely localized on the BDT unit and the LUMO is entirely localized on BODIPY with no overlap between the HOMO and LUMO (Fig. 3). Hence, no electronic communication was observed between BDT and BODIPY that is in agreement with the experimental absorption spectrum of A–D–A. The corresponding frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies are presented in Table S1.† Geometry optimization was carried out on the A–D–A structure and the torsion angles between BODIPY and phenyl spacer and between phenyl spacer and BDT unit were 54.1° and 32.2°, respectively, which render the molecule non-planar. Furthermore, charge distribution calculations were performed including dipole moments for the ground state and the excited state of A–D–A. Notably, the ground state dipole moment of 1.28 D was obtained for A–D–A whereas the dipole moment of the first excited state obtained was much higher at ∼1.94 D. This difference in dipole moments in the ground and excited state has important consequences in the optical properties of A–D–A as will be discussed (vide infra).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to determine the frontier orbital energy levels of A–D–A. Based on the first oxidation potential onset (Eonsetox) and first reduction potential (Eonsetred), the HOMO was calculated as, HOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.76) eV37 and LUMO = −(Eonsetred + 4.76) eV as summarized in Table S1.† Accordingly, calculated HOMO and LUMO levels at ∼−5.86 eV and ∼−3.89 eV were obtained, respectively, for A–D–A. The fluorescence emission spectra of A–D–A (Fig. 4a) were measured upon three different excitations at 315 nm, 380 nm (donor) and 503 nm (acceptor), respectively. Notably, upon excitation at 315 nm and 380 nm, apart from the donor emission at 405 nm, a broad but intense emission was observed at ∼698 nm, which is attributed to a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. Interestingly, a pseudo Stokes shift of ∼194 nm (51546 cm−1) was obtained, which is remarkable and much higher than previous reports of high Stokes shifts for BODIPY compounds.38–40 The fluorescence quantum yield was determined by an absolute method using an integrating sphere set-up upon excitation at 383 nm and a quantum yield of ∼0.03 was obtained for A–D–A (Table S2 in the ESI†). The formation of the TICT state is further justified by the high twist angles (BDP-phenyl and phenyl-BDT) in the structure as well as the difference in the DFT calculated dipole moments of the ground state and first excited state. These dissimilar dipole moments lead to the preferential stabilization of the excited state dipole over the ground state dipole of A–D–A in polar solvents. Therefore, the fluorescence shows a bathochromic shift in solvents of increasing polarity.14 Solvent dependent emission spectra were recorded for A–D–A (Fig. 4b) that showed a significant bathochromic shift of the emission maximum from 549 nm in toluene to 647 nm in chloroform (CF) and 700 nm in DCM.

Such a pronounced positive solvatochromism is attributed to the increased stabilization of a polar TICT state in polar solvents compared to a less polar ground state. Notably, the UV-Vis absorption of A–D–A in the same solvents did not show any noticeable change, which is consistent with the fact that the ground state of A–D–A is less polar than the excited state. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed for donor 5 and A–D–A in CF using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurement technique. The fluorescence lifetime of the donor D was measured upon excitation at 374 nm and the decay was fast with a short lifetime of ∼0.47 ns. The fluorescence lifetime of A–D–A was measured upon an excitation wavelength of 374 nm and decay profiles at an emission wavelength of 410 nm (corresponding to donor decay) and TICT emission at 700 nm were studied. The CT emission decay is known to exhibit a longer rise time that is characteristic of charge transfer and a slow component, which is characteristic of the lifetime of the equilibrated molecules.13 Accordingly, a slower decay was observed for A–D–A emission at 700 nm with a fluorescence lifetime of ∼3.41 ns as shown in Fig. 5a. Notably, the decay for the donor emission band of A–D–A at 410 nm was also fast with a lifetime of ∼0.79 ns, which corresponds closely to that of the neat donor 5. The fluorescence lifetime of A–D–A was also evaluated upon excitation at 469 nm and the lifetime of the TICT band at 700 nm was similar at ∼3.40 ns (see Table S3† for fluorescence decays, fitted parameters and lifetime values).

In order to understand the difference in the photophysics of A–D–A and the previously reported regioisomers T1 and T2, fluorescence lifetime measurements for T1 and T2 were performed. Lifetime measurements were carried out in CF upon excitation at 374 nm and 669 nm and the decay of emission bands at 726 nm and 729 nm was studied for T1 and T2, respectively. The decay lifetime for the CT band of T2 was ∼0.46 ns corresponding to a much faster decay compared to that of T1 for which a longer lifetime of ∼3.16 ns was obtained (see the ESI† for fluorescence decays, fitted parameters and lifetime values). The faster decay and the shorter lifetime values for T2 reflect the fact that PET is more efficient in it than that for T1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the lifetime of T1 (∼3.16 ns) was marginally shorter than the lifetime of A–D–A (∼3.41 ns), which corroborates the fact that TICT state formation in A–D–A is a slower process compared to PET that is occurring in T1.41
The formation of the TICT state takes place in polar solvents and the TICT state reverses to the local excited (LE) state as the solvent polarity is reduced.13 Emission measurements were performed in solvents of gradually decreasing polarity starting from 100% THF up to 99/1 (v/v) hexane/THF. The formation of TICT in A–D–A was justified by the fluorescence spectrum showing an emission maximum at 650 nm. Upon reduction of the solvent polarity by the gradual addition of hexane, the emission maximum shifted hypsochromically indicative of the formation of an LE state. Fig. 6a shows the shift of the emission maximum of A–D–A from 650 nm in 100% THF to 523 nm in 99/1 (v/v) hexane/THF.

Triads T1 and T2 both showed ICT bands and electron transfer was more efficient in the case of T2 owing to its planar conformation. Interestingly, the emission spectra of T1 in hexane/THF solvent mixtures showed a negligible hypsochromic shift in fluorescence upon going from 100% THF to the increasing percentage of hexane in the hexane/THF mixtures. A negligible shift of ∼4–5 nm was observed, which is attributed to the fact that the D and A units directly connected in T1 without a phenyl spacer led to restricted rotation of the units leading to no significant solvatochromism (see the ESI†). In the case of T2, fluorescence was severely quenched as a result of efficient electron transfer.
Aggregate induced emission (AIE) is another highly desirable property of D–A compounds separated by spacer unit(s) for their potential application in OLEDs.7,8 The AIE property was investigated in A–D–A by measuring fluorescence in solvent mixtures of water and THF. Upon increasing the fraction percentage of water (fw) (from 0% to 10% to 30% up to 50%), overall increased solvent polarity twisted the molecule and therefore shifted the equilibrium towards the TICT state leading to a bathochromic shift from 645 nm to 657 nm. However, it is worth noting that the fluorescence intensity is severely quenched at 30% fw and 50% fw mixtures (Fig. 6b). Upon increasing the fw to 75% and 90%, A–D–A preferably forms nanoclusters leading to restricted intramolecular rotation that causes the equilibrium shift towards the LE state. Thus, in these two solvent mixtures (75% fw and 90% fw), a hypsochromic shift of the emission maximum at 633 nm was observed along with an increased fluorescence intensity (Fig. 6b) because restricted motion lowered the pathways for non-radiative decay.
In order to assess the inherent charge transport properties of A–D–A, its hole mobility was measured using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method.42,43 The hole only device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (A–D–A)/Au was used to analyse J–V characteristics in the dark (see the ESI†). The hole mobility of A–D–A was extracted from the SCLC region of the curve as shown in Fig. 7. A hole mobility of 4.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for A–D–A. The higher mobility of A–D–A compared to the triads reported earlier (7.01 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for T1 and T2, respectively)30 can be attributed to the structure of A–D–A where electronically inactive alkyl chains are much less compared to those in the triads T1 and T230 and consequently leads to better packing in films.

In summary, a new acceptor–donor–acceptor triad A–D–A based on a BODIPY acceptor and a BDT donor separated by phenyl spacers was synthesized that showed no ground state interaction between BODIPY and BDT units and spectral coverage till 550 nm. Interestingly, A–D–A showed dual emission with an emission maximum at 700 nm that resulted due to the formation of a TICT state with a pseudo-Stokes shift of ∼194 nm. Furthermore, pronounced positive fluorescence solvatochromism was observed in solvents of increasing polarities due to the formation of the TICT state. The formation of the TICT state was further evident from emission measurements in solvent mixtures of THF and hexane where a hypsochromic shift in the emission of ∼127 nm was observed upon going from 100% THF up to 99/1 (v/v) hexane/THF. Aggregate induced emission was observed for A–D–A in solvent mixtures of hexane/water with emission intensity and wavelength varying with increasing percentage of water indicating its suitability for possible OLED applications. Finally, a high hole mobility of A–D–A of 4.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained that justified the suitability of this triad for (opto)electronic applications such as in OLEDs and in OPVs. At present, similar TICT based new molecules are being designed and their utility in (opto)electronic applications is being explored.
