    , Accepted 7th March 2014First published on 7th March 2014AbstractPhotoactive anodes consisting of Ru(bpy)3 type photosensitizer 1 and molecular catalysts 2 and 3 on nanostructured TiO2 have been assembled in functional devices for successful light driven water splitting. From their performance measurements we found that the photoanode TiO2(1 + 3) in which the molecular ruthenium catalyst and the phosphonate anchoring group are linked by a flexible –CH2CH2CH2– chain showed a significantly higher photocurrent density than the photoanode TiO2(1 + 2) with only –CH2– linkage. The possible reasons for the different water splitting performance of otherwise identical devices are discussed.
1 Introduction
Solar energy conversion into fuels, such as hydrogen production by water splitting, has become a very interesting research topic during the past few decades. The use of photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) in the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy has been considered as a practical method in recent years.1,2 However, the key challenge for this type of devices is the low performance of the visible light driven water oxidation process. Focusing on this challenge, some PECs have been designed,3–16 but most of them displayed quite low photocurrent densities, very likely due to the low efficiencies of water oxidation catalysts.3–15 We have developed some highly efficient molecular catalysts for water oxidation recently, and illustrated the possible reaction mechanisms for the O–O bond formation.17–20 Based on an efficient molecular ruthenium catalyst, a functional device was assembled together with the molecular photosensitizer 1 on nanostructured TiO2 by a co-absorption method.16 This PEC device displayed an unprecedented high photocurrent density and showed great potential for further development of this type of devices for light driven water splitting.
Considering the catalytic water oxidation mechanisms of our catalysts in homogeneous solutions, the PEC device achieved such a high photocurrent density on water splitting probably caused by the long flexible link between the anchoring group and the Ru catalyst.16 One possible explanation would be that the flexible link could make the catalytic centers swing easily during the water oxidation process and increase the opportunities of two catalysts to meet and to follow the O–O bond formation via a radical coupling mechanism. To confirm this assumption, two new molecular catalysts 2 and 3 with different lengths of flexible carbon links have been deliberately synthesized and used to assemble the photoanodes in functional devices; see the illustration of the PEC devices in Scheme 1. A positive conclusion can be drawn by investigating their performances in light driven water splitting.

2.3.5 Synthesis of photosensitizer 1. 
The photosensitizer 1 was synthesised according to the procedure described in the literature.21

2.4 Preparation of working electrodes (WEs)
A FTO electrode with a 12 μm thickness nano TiO2 film was made by doctor blading. The film was dried at 120 °C for 30 min in an oven, and then heated to 520 °C in a stove for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the film was cut using a glass cutter and the active area was made to 1 cm2. After that, the pieces (1.0 cm2 × 2 pieces) were immersed in 1.3 mg of catalyst 3 (2.0 × 10−6 mol) and/or 3.0 mg of photosensitizer 1 (4.0 × 10−6 mol) solution in a mixture of 10 mL of methanol and 5 drops of acetonitrile in a closed container for 2 hours. The films were washed with methanol and water several times and dried in dark at room temperature to obtain the working electrodes (WEs).
3 Results and discussion
The synthesis of the molecular catalysts was straightforward, as shown in Scheme 2. Pyridines with phosphonate esters linked via different carbon chains are used to replace the DMSO ligand in the precursor Ru(bda)(pic)(DMSO), forming catalysts c and d. Due to the stronger binding feature of the phosphonic acid to the surface of the TiO2 than the ester form, catalysts 2 and 3 are finally prepared by hydrolysis of c and d.

The PEC devices used in this study were prepared by immersing the TiO2-sintered FTO electrodes in a methanol solution with several drops of acetonitrile solution containing both molecular photosensitizer 1 (4 × 10−4 M) and molecular catalyst 2 or 3 (2 × 10−4 M) in a molar ratio 2:1, forming the WEs TiO2(1 + 2) and TiO2(1 + 3). Similarly, TiO2-sintered FTO electrodes adsorbed with only photosensitizer 1 (TiO2(1)), catalyst 2 (TiO2(2)) or 3 (TiO2(3)) have also been prepared as references for evaluation of the device performance.
3.1 Electrochemical study of the anodes
The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the WEs TiO2(1 + 2) (black line) and TiO2(1 + 3) (red line) were taken in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.4), using Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode as shown in Fig. 1a. The reversible peaks shown at E1/2 = 0.68 V (vs. NHE) are assigned to the RuII/RuIII redox couples of catalysts 2 and 3. The two irreversible oxidation peaks at ca. Epa = 1.40 V (vs. NHE) are assigned to the RuII/RuIII oxidation process of photosensitizer 1, which is riding on the onset potential of ca. 1.10 V (vs. NHE) of the catalytic water oxidation. When the amount of catalysts on the WEs increased, an additional oxidation process likely related to RuIV–OH/RuVO could be found at Epa = 1.20 V (vs. NHE) as an irreversible oxidation peak (Fig. 1b).17 These electrochemical results may indicate that light driven oxidation of the catalyst from RuII to RuIII–OH2, RuIV–OH and even RuVO species by a photogenerated RuIII photosensitizer is thermodynamically favored, according to our earlier studies of the reaction mechanisms of this type of catalysts.
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms of the WEs. (a) TiO2(1 + 2) (black line) and TiO2(1 + 3) (red line); (b) TiO2(1 + 3) with a high ratio of catalyst 3 and photosensitizer 1 (1:1); (c) TiO2(2) (black line) and TiO2(3) (red line) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.4), Pt wire is used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Scan rate 100 mV s−1. (ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.20, ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.20 + 0.0591 pH). 
As references, WEs TiO2(2) (black line, with only catalyst 2) and TiO2(3) (red line, with only catalyst 3) were also assembled. Under the same conditions, CVs of WEs TiO2(2) and TiO2(3) have been studied as shown in Fig. 1c. Similar reversible peaks of the RuII/RuIII redox couples appear for catalysts 2 and 3, but the catalytic water oxidation currents display significant differences. As alkane chains have insulating characters, a short alkane chain should have less influence on hindering electron transfer during the electrolyzation process. But in our measurements, the WE TiO2(2) with a short alkane chain displays lower catalytic current than the WE TiO2(3) with a long alkane chain. The result indicates that a bimolecular reaction should happen in the WE TiO2(3), which might be the main reason for the increase in catalytic current (Fig. 2).

In order to estimate the relative ratio of the photosensitizer and the catalyst on the surface of the working electrode, differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) of working electrodes TiO2(1 + 2) and TiO2(1 + 3) were taken in anhydrous acetonitrile solution, with Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode as shown in Fig. 3. Based on areas of the RuII/RuIII redox peak of the catalyst at ca. 0.7 V and the RuII/RuIII redox peak of the photosensitizer at ca. 1.5 V, the ratios of photosensitizer 1 and catalysts (2 or 3) on the surfaces of TiO2 are found to be ca. 5:1. By comparing the intensities of the RuII/RuIII redox peaks at either 0.7 V or 1.5 V, the amounts of photosensitizer 1 and catalyst 2 on the working electrode TiO2(1 + 2) are found similar to the amounts of photosensitizer 1 and catalyst 3 on the working electrode TiO2(1 + 3).

3.2 Photoelectrochemical study of the functional devices
Three-electrode PEC devices were constructed with the anode assembly TiO2(1 + 2) or TiO2(1 + 3) as the WE, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the cathode. The CV measurements of the PEC devices under light illumination have been performed as shown in Fig. 4. The photocurrent density of the PEC device with the WE TiO2(1 + 2) reached a high value of ca. 0.7 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V (vs. NHE) applied potential (Fig. 3, green line). When the WE TiO2(1 + 3) (pink line) was used in the PEC device, the photocurrent density reached a higher value of ca. 1.4 mA cm−2 at the same applied potential of 0.2 V (vs. NHE). Since the experimental conditions for both devices are identical, these results clearly show that the WE TiO2(1 + 3) has much better performance than the WE TiO2(1 + 2). Further scan of the applied potential led to increases of currents for both devices at ca. Epa = 0.68 V (vs. NHE), which are caused by the oxidation process (RuII/RuIII) of the catalysts 2 and 3 on the WEs.
 Fig. 4  The influence of light intensity on the photocurrent density of the devices with WEs TiO2(1 + 2) (black line) and TiO2(1 + 3) (red line) using a 300 W xenon lamp white-light source coupled to a 400 nm long-pass filter, with 0.2 V bias vs. NHE. 
The PEC devices with the WEs TiO2(1) (black line, with only the photosensitizer), TiO2(2) (red line) and TiO2(3) (blue line) were also assembled; the photocurrent densities were almost negligible, indicating that both the photosensitizer and the catalyst are necessary components of the WE in order to keep the PEC device functioning.
Light intensity control experiments of the functional devices were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 4. By controlling the light intensity from 100 mW cm−2 to 500 mW cm−2, with an external bias of 0.2 V (vs. NHE), the photocurrent densities of the WEs TiO2(1 + 2) (black line) and TiO2(1 + 3) (red line) are increased. The effect of photocurrent densities at lower light intensities is more significant than the effect of photocurrent densities at relatively higher light intensities. Therefore, a light intensity of 300 mW cm−2 was typically used in all related measurements.
Subsequently, an applied bias of 0.2 V (vs. NHE) and a light intensity of 300 mW cm−2 are chosen for the measurements of these PEC devices and the obtained photocurrent densities are shown in Fig. 5. With the WE TiO2(1 + 3) as the photoanode, a high initial photocurrent density of 4.2 mA cm−2 and a high final photocurrent density of 1.4 mA cm−2 were observed within 10 seconds of light illumination. When using the WE TiO2(1 + 2) as the photoanode, the initial and the final photocurrent densities are found to be about 2.5 mA cm−2 and 0.7 mA cm−2 respectively. In comparison, changing the WE to TiO2(1), TiO2(2) or TiO2(3) in the related devices, the photocurrent densities observed were nearly negligible. These results indicate that both the molecular photosensitizer and the molecular catalyst are necessary to be on the TiO2 surface of the WE in order to keep the device functioning. The contrasting results of different devices also demonstrate that the WE TiO2(1 + 3) works more efficiently than the WE TiO2(1 + 2) for light driven water splitting.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent densities of the PEC devices in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.4) with 0.2 V bias vs. NHE under illumination with a 300 W xenon lamp through a 400 nm long-pass filter (light intensity 300 mW cm−2), with TiO2(1) (black line), TiO2(2) (red line), TiO2(3) (blue line), TiO2(1 + 2) (green line) and TiO2(1 + 3) (pink line) as WEs. 
Repeated measurements showed that the PEC device with the WE TiO2(1 + 3) as the photoanode worked well for longer time illumination. In the initial time, the photocurrent density of the WE TiO2(1 + 3) appears as a sharp peak (Fig. 6, red line) followed by an instantaneous decline to ca. 1.5 mA cm−2. The photocurrent density keeps decreasing slowly from 1.5 mA cm−2 to ca. 1.25 mA cm−2 within 150 seconds under sustained light illumination. In contrast the decay curve of the WE TiO2(1 + 2) (Fig. 6, black line) shows the different trends of photocurrent density. With a similar initial value of ca. 1.5 mA cm−2, the photocurrent density decreases quickly to ca. 0.25 mA cm−2 within 150 seconds, which illustrates that the WE TiO2(1 + 2) loses the high activity after short time illumination. During visible light illumination, some clearly seen bubbles on the WEs and the Pt counter electrode have been confirmed by GC as the oxygen gas and hydrogen gas respectively. Based on the amount of generated hydrogen in the devices with the WEs TiO2(1 + 2) (0.46 μmol) and TiO2(1 + 3) (1.08 μmol), the faraday efficiencies were calculated to be ca. 75% and 85% respectively. These measurements confirm again that the WE TiO2(1 + 3) has much better performance than the WE TiO2(1 + 2) in terms of both photocurrent density and device stability.

4 Conclusions
Two functional devices based on photoactive anodes TiO2(1 + 2) and TiO2(1 + 3) have been assembled by a co-absorption method using a molecular photosensitizer 1 and a molecular catalyst 2 or 3. The photoelectrochemical study revealed that the functional device with the WE TiO2(1 + 3) has much better performance in visible light driven water splitting than the device with the WE TiO2(1 + 2). Since the only difference in these two functional devices is the length of the carbon link between the Ru catalyst and the anchoring group, the sharp increase of the photocurrent density and the photostability from the WE TiO2(1 + 2) to the WE TiO2(1 + 3) clearly indicate that the distance between the Ru catalyst and the surface of TiO2 plays a great role in the performance of a functional device for light driven water splitting.
The results of CVs and photoelectrochemical studies on WEs displayed that a long alkane chain could increase the opportunity of catalysts to undergo bimolecular reaction in WEs, which should be the main reason for making great improvement in photocurrent densities. Long alkane chains could also decrease the electron recombination between TiO2 and catalysts due to the insulating characters, which should be considered as another reason to improve the photocurrent densities. A more detailed study on the kinetics of the related electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 and subsequently electron transfer from the catalyst to the dye in different functional devices is in progress.
