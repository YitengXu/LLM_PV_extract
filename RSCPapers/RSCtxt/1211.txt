    , Accepted 13th March 2018First published on 15th March 2018AbstractHerein, two small molecule donors, BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP, compatible with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors were developed. Both molecules exhibited medium bandgaps with complementary absorption to and appropriate energy level offsets with typical acceptors like PC61BM and IDIC. The optimized devices showed the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.53% for fullerene organic solar cells and 5.48% for non-fullerene organic solar cells. Moreover, ternary devices containing blends of the small molecule donors, IDIC and PC61BM produced PCEs of 6.53% for BDTTT-DPP cells and 6.55% for BDTTVT-DPP cells, even higher than the binary ones.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture have drawn considerable attention from academia and industry, due to their unique advantages including low-cost, lightweight, flexibility and semitransparency.1 This field has made significant progress owing to the rapid development of photovoltaic materials and the advance of device optimization. Donor and acceptor materials are blended to fabricate the BHJ architecture and both types of materials are crucial for device performance.2–4 For the past two decades, fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM and PC71BM, have been the predominant electron acceptor materials owing to their high electron affinity and electron mobility, isotropic charge transport and easy form of phase separation.5,6 However, fullerene-based OSCs have entered a bottleneck period partly due to the inherent drawbacks of fullerene derivatives including their limited structure variation, weak absorption in the visible region, nearly fixed energy levels and poor stability.7 To achieve better photovoltaic performance of OSCs, much effort has been devoted towards exploiting novel non-fullerene acceptors.8–10 Among numerous non-fullerene acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) are very successful and are employed for non-fullerene OSCs (NF-OSCs) with excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), attributed to their enhanced and broadened absorption from the visible to near-infrared region, adjustable energy levels and less energy loss in the devices.11–15 Recently, NF-OSCs have achieved over 13% record PCEs in both single and tandem junction devices and their best PCEs have surpassed the performance of fullerene-based solar cells.16–18
Conjugated polymers or small molecules (SMs) are usually employed as donor materials.5,19–21 Donor–acceptor type and low bandgap polymers, with strong absorption, a good film-forming ability and optimal phase separation, are blended with PCBM to obtain high-efficiency OSCs. Compared with polymer donors, SM donors have a better-defined chemical structure and higher purity, which are desirable for commercial applications.22,23 Besides, from the fundamental aspect for understanding the structure–property–device performance relationships, SM-based solar cells are more ideal models than polymer-based solar cells. Recently, the highest PCE of fullerene-based small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) has reached over 11% and the highest PCE of non-fullerene all small molecule organic solar cells (NFASM-OSCs) is only about 10%.24–26 Overall, high-efficiency SM donors are still very limited, especially for NFASM-OSCs.
During the past few decades, fullerene derivatives have been considered as perfect model acceptor materials that can be blended with various donor materials, which allows researchers to concentrate on developing donor materials, studying interface layer engineering and optimizing blend morphologies. For donor materials, a few polymer donors like poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have been widely used in OSC studies, but their poor performances in both fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs limit further study.27–31 There are very few universal model SM donor materials compatible with diverse acceptor materials, which hinders the development of OSCs (Table 1).19,32–36 Thus developing universal model SM donor materials is highly desirable especially in the context of more and more emerging excellent non-fullerene acceptors, which can promote fundamental research and practical applications. Designing universal SM donors that can match well with different acceptors is very challenging, as several criteria should be met with a delicate balance. First, they should exhibit complementary absorption to different acceptors. The absorption range of typical fullerene acceptor PCBM is below 400 nm and the absorption ranges of typical non-fullerene acceptors (e.g., ITIC13 and IDIC14) are 600–800 nm. Thus medium bandgaps with absorption between 300 and 700 nm are appropriate for universal SM donors to ensure that enough light is absorbed in combination with either fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors. Second, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be higher than those of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors; thus appropriate energy offsets can produce driving forces for charge separation and reduce the energy loss. Third, like the structures of excellent polymer donors and non-fullerene small molecule acceptors, an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure is necessary for universal SMs to enhance intramolecular charge transfer and to obtain strong absorption.

Following the above consideration, we designed and synthesized two new A–D–A type medium bandgap small molecule donors (Fig. 1), BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP, which are expected to be compatible with different acceptors. Both molecules consist of a conjugated group substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moiety as the central unit, and two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moieties as the terminal electron-withdrawing units. Previous encouraging reports showed that BDT is a promising building block for polymer and SM donors due to its symmetric and planar structure. The Hou and Li groups developed an effective strategy for building two-dimensional structures by incorporating conjugated substituents into the BDT moiety.37 The donor materials containing substituted BDT units usually result in wide and strong absorption, high hole mobility and superior blend morphologies, thereby boosting the photovoltaic performance.38 We modified the BDT unit with the bithiophene group (BDTTT-DPP) and the (E)-1,2-di(thiophen-2-yl)ethane group (BDTTVT-DPP), and investigated how the different conjugated groups affect the device performance. The DPP unit is virtually planar and shows strong intermolecular interactions on account of hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking.39,40 The photovoltaic performances of the two SM donors for both SM-OSCs and NFASM-OSCs are systematically investigated.

BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction between bromo-DPP and organotin BDT compounds, respectively. Detailed synthetic procedures are presented in the ESI.† The two molecules exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc. Both molecules have excellent thermal stability up to 395 °C and 406 °C, respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that both molecules are thermally stable enough for application in solar cells. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level are conducted to gain insight into their optimal molecular geometries (Fig. 2). Both molecules exhibit planar geometries with linear backbones, which endow them with favorable molecular stacking and effective charge transport.
 Fig. 2  The optimized geometries and LUMO/HOMO of BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP determined using DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*). 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP in solutions and films are presented in Fig. 3b, and the optical data are summarized in Table 2. In diluted CHCl3 solutions, both molecules show broad and strong absorption with the highest molar extinction coefficient (λmax) of 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BDTTT-DPP and 1.07 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BDTTVT-DPP, respectively. Two well-defined absorption bands are found, corresponding to their 0–2 (350–450 nm) and 0–1 (500–680 nm) transitions. The 0–2 band is put down to the π–π* transitions, while the 0–1 band originates from the intramolecular charge transport.41 The more notable 0–2 band of BDTTVT-DPP comes from the vibration of the double bond. From solution to film, both molecules display red-shifted and broadened absorption with the appearance of a new absorption band of 0–0 (680–780 nm), ascribed to the strong intermolecular charge transport. The excellent film absorptions ensure absorption of enough photons and boost the photocurrent. The optical bandgaps of BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP are 1.69 and 1.67 eV, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels were determined to be −5.04/−3.46 eV for BDTTT-DPP, and −5.07/−3.43 eV for BDTTVT-DPP through cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Fig. S2, ESI†). The relatively low HOMO level of BDTTVT-DPP may give a high open circuit voltage (VOC). The bandgaps of both molecules estimated from CV curves are 1.58 and 1.64 eV, consistent with their optical bandgaps.

The typical fullerene acceptor PC61BM and non-fullerene acceptor IDIC were chosen as the acceptors to be blended with both SM donors to fabricate different types of devices, and their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 3a. It was expected that BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP should work well with these two acceptors according to the following considerations. First, the energy levels of PC61BM and IDIC match well with the two small molecules, which shall benefit charge separation. Second, the film absorptions of both molecules are in the range of 300–750 nm, while the film absorptions of PC61BM and IDIC are in the ranges below 400 nm and 600–800 nm, respectively. Thus the blends shall exhibit strong and complementary absorption in a cell, which is beneficial for utilizing enough photons and enhancing the short circuit current (JSC). Third, besides good electron mobility for PC61BM, IDIC exhibits a high electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1,14 which is close to the hole mobilities of 9.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 for BDTTT-DPP and 6.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 for BDTTVT-DPP measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S3, ESI†). The high and balanced mobility of the donor and acceptor can drive efficient charge transport in the blend film. Fourth, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), both PC61BM and IDIC can effectively quench the photoluminescence (PL) of the two small molecules. The PL of IDIC can also be quenched by the two small molecules. The high PL quenching efficiencies of the blend films further indicate the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer.42
The photovoltaic performances of BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP in both SM-OSCs and NFASM-OSCs are evaluated by fabricating conventional devices with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al structure. PDIN is used as the cathode interfacial layer, on account of its high conductivity, appropriate energy level and work function tuning effect.43 The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 3. For PC61BM cells, the best device for BDTTT-DPP gives a decent PCE of 5.53%, with a VOC of 0.828 V, a JSC of 10.92 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 61.05%. The best device for BDTTVT-DPP shows a relatively poorer PCE of 3.48%, along with low JSC ascribed to the low photoresponse in the visible range. For IDIC cells, the best device for BDTTT-DPP shows a PCE of 4.80%, with a VOC of 0.810 V, a JSC of 10.16 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 58.28%. The best device for BDTTVT-DPP shows a higher PCE of 5.48% with enhanced JSC and VOC. The fullerene and non-fullerene based cells present a close VOC value for the same donor, consistent with similar LUMO energy levels of PC61BM and IDIC. In fullerene cells BDTTT-DPP shows higher JSC than BDTTVT-DPP, while in non-fullerene cells the case is opposite. These adverse JSC values agree with the trend in blend film absorption and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The four as-cast devices give moderate FFs of about 60%, implying that most of the bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed. The device results indicate that developing universal small molecules compatible with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors is highly challenging as many factors need to be contemplated and balanced. Besides, the morphology optimization of SM-based devices is also challenging, as the high-crystallinity of SMs is good for ordered arrangement, but it is difficult to form proper phase separation domains especially in NFASM-OSCs. By the tactful post-treatment of the SM containing blend, the balance between crystallinity and phase separation may be further optimized.

To understand the different PCE performances of the two molecules, the UV-vis absorption (Fig. S5, ESI†) and EQE (Fig. 4a) spectra of the blend films were studied. For fullerene cells, the absorption of the BDTTT-DPP:PC61BM film is obviously higher for most wavelength values compared with that of the BDTTVT-DPP:PC61BM film, which stems from the enhanced charge transport and results in higher JSC. For non-fullerene cells, the absorption intensity of the BDTTVT-DPP:IDIC film is stronger than that of the BDTTT-DPP:IDIC film from 500 to 800 nm, thereby increasing the JSC value. The fullerene-based devices show a photoresponse in 300–750 nm and the BDTTT-DPP device shows a stronger response compared with the others. For non-fullerene devices, the EQEs of both molecules are in the 300–800 nm range and the BDTTVT-DPP device shows a stronger response. The EQE results are consistent with the trend of blend film absorption. The JSC values calculated from EQE curves are listed in Table 3, which are in good agreement with the JSC measured from the J–V curves (the error is <5%).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S6, ESI†) were performed to gain insight into the blend morphologies. The AFM images show that the surfaces of all four devices, BDTTT-DPP:PC61BM, BDTTVT-DPP:PC61BM, BDTTT-DPP:IDIC, and BDTTVT-DPP:IDIC, are smooth and uniform with root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of 2.03, 1.05, 1.36, and 2.14 nm, respectively. The smooth and uniform surface can improve the active layer/electrode interface contact and thus benefit charge extraction. Obvious nanophase separation with interpenetrating networks of domains tens of nanometers in size can be seen from their TEM images. Both fullerene and non-fullerene based devices can present optimal blend morphologies, which are beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transfer.

The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blend films were tested by the SCLC method (Fig. S7, ESI†). The hole/electron mobilities for BDTTT-DPP:PC61BM and BDTTVT-DPP:PC61BM blends are 1.5 × 10−3/1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.3) and 7.2 × 10−4/3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 2.1), respectively. The hole/electron mobilities for BDTTT-DPP:IDIC and BDTTVT-DPP:IDIC blends are 2.0 × 10−4/3.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 0.6) and 4.7 × 10−4/4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.1), respectively. For BDTTT-DPP:PC61BM and BDTTVT-DPP:IDIC devices with better PCEs, higher and more balanced mobilities are good for effective charge transport and thus acquire excellent JSC and FFs.
Like most small molecule organic solar cells, the relatively low JSC values of the devices largely deteriorate the PCEs, possibly due to their less continuous network skeleton and strong tendency of the small molecules to crystallize. We propose that ternary blends containing SM donors, fullerene acceptors and non-fullerene acceptors may overcome these problems and at the same time provide even better light absorption. To verify this hypothesis, we fabricated SM-ternary devices with blends of the SM donors (D), IDIC (A1) and PC61BM (A2), and optimized the D/A1/A2 ratio to achieve higher PCEs (Tables S10, S11 and Fig. S8, S9, ESI†). For BDTTT-DPP (D1) cells, the ternary device with the D1/A1/A2 ratio = 1:0.6:0.4 produced the best PCE of 6.53%. For BDTTVT-DPP (D2) cells, the ternary device with the D2/A1/A2 ratio = 1:0.8:0.2 produced the best PCE of 6.55%. Compared with the binary cells, the corresponding ternary cells showed obviously enhanced performance due to increased JSC and FF, originating from their superior morphologies and complementary absorption.36
Conclusions
In summary, two medium bandgap small molecule donors, BDTTT-DPP and BDTTVT-DPP, consisting of benzodithiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole units were designed and synthesized. With complementary absorption and appropriate energy level offsets, both small molecule donors are well paired with typical fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors (PC61BM and IDIC) to fabricate SM-OSCs and NFASM-OSCs, respectively. The best PCE of 5.53% for fullerene cells was produced from the BDTTT-DPP:PC61BM device, while the best PCE of 5.48% for non-fullerene cells came from the BDTTVT-DPP:PC61BM device. Moreover, ternary devices containing blends of the SM donors, IDIC and PC61BM produced PCEs of 6.53% for BDTTT-DPP cells and 6.55% for BDTTVT-DPP cells, much higher than the corresponding binary ones. Both molecules are rare examples that can exhibit decent PCEs in fullerene, non-fullerene and mixed acceptor type solar cells. Further effort will focus on rational design of the compatible small molecule donors and morphology optimization in the ternary devices. It is believed that this attempt to exploit universal high-efficiency small molecule donors compatible with diverse acceptors shall facilitate deep mechanistic understanding and practical applications in organic solar cells.
