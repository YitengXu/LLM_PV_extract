    , Accepted 23rd October 2014First published on 23rd October 2014AbstractA novel bi-functional cobalt carbonate hydroxide supported on a carbon (CCH/C) catalyst has been synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method to meet the demand for the widespread commercialization of the energy conversion and storage technologies, which was used for the first time in ORR and OER. Furthermore, the newly discovered phase-dependent electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of CCH/C are demonstrated.
Oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are the key barriers in various electrochemical devices such as metal–air batteries,1 fuel cells2 and electrolysers.3 Finding stable and efficient oxygen electrocatalysts which drive both reactions is difficult, because good catalysts for ORR often tend to be poor for OER and vice versa. At present, precious metals4 and their alloys5 have been found to give the best bi-functional electrocatalysts; however, the scarce resources and high cost of these metals limit their large-scale applications. Therefore, the development of a new non-precious metal bi-functional electrocatalyst with high activity, long-term stability and low cost to supersede precious-metal electrocatalysts is of paramount importance.
Cobalt-based materials such as cobalt oxides6 (CoO, Co3O4) have been widely investigated as non-precious metal electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. However, the electrocatalytic activities of cobalt-based materials are still less competitive compared to precious metal electrocatalysts. An appropriate cobalt-based material structure is believed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER. Chen et al.7 selectively synthesized of tetragonal or cubic CoxMn3−xO4 and the relationship between phase and electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics was interpreted. Jin et al.8 also reported that transition metal hydroxide could be indeed improved by tuning the morphology and composition. These results have demonstrated that the development of a nanostructure suitable for the highly efficient catalysis of ORR/OER is therefore of paramount importance. Inspired by this understanding, herein, cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CCH),9 a cobalt-based mineral salt with a stable structure, was for the first time employed as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. The experimental results indicate that CCH supported on carbon black (CCH/C) exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity and stability in an alkaline electrolyte when compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (40 wt% platinum on Vulcan XC-72), and offers a small overpotential of 0.509 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in OER, thus leading to a new highly efficient bi-functional oxygen electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. Additionally, phase-dependent electrochemical characteristics have been investigated; we found that increasing the hydrothermal reaction time can significantly alter the crystalline phase of CCH in CCH/C, eventually modulating their ORR and OER activity via changing the hydrothermal conditions.
To investigate the composition and the structure of the obtained product, the XRD patterns of the CCH, CCH-2/C, and CCH-16/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of CCH and CCH-2/C catalysts show the characteristics of the orthorhombic cobalt hydroxide carbonate Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O (JCPDS no. 48-0084), excepting the increasing intensity of the broad peak on the XRD patterns of CCH-2/C (the same for CCH-16/C) at around 24° which was derived from the existence of carbon black. When the hydrothermal time was extended to 16 h, the orthorhombic cobalt hydroxide carbonate is the major phase and the monoclinic cobalt hydroxide carbonate Co2(OH)2CO3 (JCPDS no. 29-1416) begins to appear, which is the same with a previous work of Wang et al.9c It implies that there is a phase transition with increasing hydrothermal time. Comparing CCH with CCH-16/C, we note that CCH and CCH-16/C have different phases at the same hydrothermal time, suggesting a possible role of carbon black during the monoclinic cobalt hydroxide carbonate formation.

The morphologies of the as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2 illustrates the SEM and TEM images of CCH, CCH-2/C and CCH-16/C catalysts. The obtained product of the CCH-2/C catalyst mainly consists of nanorods with average diameters of about 20 nm and carbon spheres (Fig. 2a, c and e). Moreover, the influence of the hydrothermal reaction time on the morphology of CCH/C can also be observed in Fig. 2b, d and f. With the time of hydrothermal reaction increasing, CCH in CCH/C transformed from nanorods into the mixture of nanorods and nanosheets. And the nanorods and nanosheets are corresponding to the orthorhombic CCH and the monoclinic CCH, respectively.9a,c Thus the phase transformation may be accompanied by the changing morphologies of the product. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the SEM images reveal CCH having well-defined nanorod morphologies. The different morphologies of CCH and CCH-16/C are likely due to the presence (CCH-16/C) or absence (CCH) of carbon black during the hydrothermal reaction.

The electrocatalytic activities of CCH + C, CCH-2/C and CCH-16/C catalysts for ORR were first examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with N2 or O2. As shown in Fig. 3a, in comparison with the electrochemical response in a N2-saturated electrolyte, CCH + C, CCH-2/C and CCH-16/C catalysts display an apparent cathodic peak in an O2-saturated electrolyte, respectively, which is attributed to the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen on the electrode. To more quantitatively evaluate the effect of CCH phase on ORR activity, a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) measurement was carried out. From the polarization curves in Fig. 3b, a well-defined sharp decrease of half-wave potential (E1/2) (20 mV) is observed as the catalyst is changed from orthorhombic CCH (CCH-2/C) to a mixture of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases (CCH-16/C). For a better understanding of the ORR activities of the different catalysts, the kinetic current (jk) associated with the intrinsic activity of each catalyst was obtained by constructing Koutecky–Levich plots for oxygen reduction with the different catalysts. At 0.85 V vs. RHE, the jk for CCH-2/C and CCH-16/C catalysts were estimated to be 3.53 mA cm−2 and 1.97 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3d). Considered together with the observed E1/2 values, these data show that the CCH-2/C catalyst drastically out-performed the CCH-16/C catalyst. Because of the small difference of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the prepared representative CCH-2/C catalyst (98 m2 g−1) and CCH-16/C catalyst (72 m2 g−1), the featureless specific surface area has little influence on the ORR activity. Thus, such activity change could be largely attributed to the phase transformation. Meanwhile, it is worth pointing out here that the catalytic activity of the CCH-2/C catalyst is superior to that of the physical mixture of free CCH and C, as shown in Fig. 3b. Moreover, the average electron transfer number (n) of the CCH-2/C catalyst was calculated to be 3.75 from the slopes of K–L plots, compared to ORR catalyzed by a CCH + C catalyst measured in the same 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (n ∼ 3.31) (Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that there is conducive interaction between CCH and C during the hydrothermal reaction. Although we cannot find more difference in the crystalline structure between CCH-2/C and CCH + C, the better dispersion of CCH on C powders in the case of CCH-2/C than in the case of CCH + C is at least one contributor for such difference in electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, it can be seen that the value E1/2 on an CCH-2/C catalyst electrode is only 24 mV negative than that for Pt/C in Fig. 2b, indicating that the electrocatalytic activity comparable to the JM Pt/ C catalyst can be achieved by the Co-based catalysts present. Additionally, The CCH–C hybrid material has excellent tolerance towards methanol and high durability, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). These results indicate that the CCH-2/C catalyst is an excellent ORR catalyst.

Fig. 3c shows the OER activities of CCH + C, CCH-2/C, CCH-16/C and Ir/C catalysts investigated by dynamic voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH. All the investigated catalysts almost show the same activity for the OER, suggesting that the phase transformation has a little effluence on the OER activity. The Tafel data of the as prepared CCH-2/C catalyst and CCH-16/C on OER are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which shows that the kinetics of OER on the CCH-16/C is almost as good as that on the CCH-2/C. Precisely, the CCH-2/C catalyst shows extraordinary OER activity, which demonstrates a much lower overpotential before the OER current reaches 10 mA cm−2, a reference current density in evaluating OER catalysts especially for solar water splitting. The small overpotential for CCH-2/C to reach this reference value is 0.509 V, which is similar to that of CoO/C (Fig. S7, ESI†), more negative than that of Pt/C and only 65 mV less active than Ir/C. In a word, the CCH-2/C catalyst is a promising candidate as a cathode OER catalyst.
The overvoltage between ORR and OER means the loss in efficiency and is therefore a very important parameter for evaluating the bi-functional electrocatalytic activity of a given catalyst.10 The figure of merit used to quantify ORR is the half-wave potential. And activities for the OER are judged by the potential required to oxidize water at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The smaller the overvoltage between ORR and OER, the better the catalyst serves as a reversible oxygen electrode. By this metric, as shown in Fig. 3e and f, the oxygen electrode activities (ΔE) of CCH2-C, Pt/C, and Ir/C catalysts are found to be 0.895, 1.203 and 0.936 V respectively. CCH-2/C is the best one as a bi-functional catalyst compared with precious metal catalysts Pt and Ir. Hence, the superior electrocatalytic behaviour of CCH-2/C towards both ORR and OER can be attributed to two parts. On the one hand, thanks to the inherent stable structure of mineral salts and one dimensional nanostructure, relatively high electrocatalytic activity and durability are achieved. On the other hand, the conducive interaction between CCH and C contributed to the ORR activity of the CCH-2/C catalyst.
On the basis of the results and discussions presented above, the proposed mechanism for the electrocatalytic activity of the CCH-2/C catalyst is presented in Fig. 4. The relatively high ORR activity of the CCH-2 catalyst may be attributed to the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couples, by means of which the O2 molecules are decomposed to O2−/O2− species. Co(II) reacts with O2 to form Co(II)–O2, and then Co(II)–O2 converts to Co(II) again via the 4-electron ORR process. And the possible mechanistic origin of OER at the CCH-2 catalyst might be likely Co(OH)2.11 Co(II) is formed with extra OH− species in the alkaline solution, resulting in the formation of Co(III). The Co(III) reacts with OH− species producing Co(IV)–O2 and H2O subsequently. Finally the oxygen evolution reaction occurs, in which the absorbed O2 to Co(IV) species is desorbed from Co(IV).

In summary, a new high-performance bi-functional electrocatalyst composed of the CCH/C catalyst was proposed for the first time. This inexpensive and earth-abundant catalyst exhibited excellent bi-functional oxygen electrode activity similar to that of the best known precious metal catalysts: Pt and Ir. The superior performance can be attributed to the inherent stable structure and one dimensional nanostructure of CCH. And the crystalline phase of CCH transforms from the orthorhombic phase into a mix of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases along with the increase of hydrothermal time, leading to a great loss of ORR activity and a little enhancement of OER activity. This work has revealed a new structure in preparation of cobalt-based materials as electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries, unitized regenerative fuel cells, and alkaline electrolyzers, and provides an opportunity to develop a new generation of electrocatalysts.
