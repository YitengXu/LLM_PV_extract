    , Accepted 2nd February 2016First published on 3rd February 2016AbstractHierarchical anatase titania (TiO2) with a hollow spherical architecture decorated with functionalized carbon dots (CF@THS) was synthesized by a solvothermal decomposition of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) in the presence of a solution mixture containing thiourea and citric acid. Interestingly, the concomitant presence of thiourea and citric acid has been found to be essential to obtain such hierarchical hollow architecture because individual constituents produced non-hollow spheres when hydrothermally treated with TTIP. The co-existence of these two constituents also accelerates the growth of hollow spheres. BET surface area study of CF@THS revealed the existence of a slit like mesoporosity with a surface area value of 81 m2 g−1. Time dependent FESEM and TEM studies confirmed the formation of nanoflake like structures in the intermediate stages followed by the growth of a hollow spherical architecture. We proposed that these nanoflakes get accumulated on the bubble surface to form such hollow spherical morphology. The PL spectral study and Raman shift of the as prepared CF@THS confirmed the presence of functionalized graphitic C dots on the surface. A thorough XPS analysis was conducted to explore the nature and relative atomic concentration of the functional groups (–COOH, –CONH2, –NH2). This CF@THS sample showed very fast and selective dye (methylene blue and methyl violet) adsorption ability (even from a mixture of two different dye solutions) due to these δ-site containing functional groups on the surface. As CF@THS showed only two times reusability for adsorption, the dye adsorbed CF@THS was calcined at 450 °C in air to yield organic free anatase TiO2 hollow spheres (THS) with a retention of the original structure. THS was recycled as an efficient and a reusable photocatalyst (k = 9.36 × 10−2 min−1) as well as a photoanode in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) having Jsc value of 19.58 mA cm−2 with overall efficiency of 6.48%.
1. Introduction
Recently, the synthesis of TiO2 nanomaterials with desired morphologies such as hollow, dimensionally controlled (1D, 2D, 3D) nano-structures and core–shell nano/microstructures is being considered as the key challenge in the field of materials science due to their novel properties like high specific surface area, low density, and higher loading capacity.1–9 Particularly, the design of hollow spherical structures has been receiving much attention due to their application in catalysis, nanoreactors, drug delivery and so on.3,10 This is due to the fact that the void space within the hollow-structure facilitates catalysis reactions because of easy introduction and release of the reactant and product molecules to the reactive sites.11,12 Notably, TiO2 nano-materials with high surface area, suitable pore structure, surface chemistry and morphology have been explored in the field of adsorption for water purification.13–16 Additionally, for photocatalysis, effective adsorption and diffusion of reactant molecules on the surface of TiO2 is essential prior to electron transfer;17 whereas in the case of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) application, strong attachment of sensitizer dye molecules on the surface of the photoanode through covalent bonding is the primary criterion. Thus the hollow spherical morphology has been found to be suitable for dye adsorption, photocatalysis, DSSC, hydrogen evolution and gas sensing. To date several methods have been reported for the development of TiO2 hollow spheres by using hard templates such as silica spheres, polymer spheres, carbon and CaCO3 spheres18–21 or soft templates like colloidal templates, surfactants or polymer assembly.22–24 These template assisted approaches are quite prolonged as they consist of multi-steps including template removal. Therefore template free approaches for the synthesis of hollow nanostructures can be implemented as relatively simple and advantageous methods to design a hollow architecture.3,25,26 Basically, for this kind of synthetic strategy, the generation of void space is controlled by the reagents used.10 Likewise, several reports can be found on this template-free methodology for the formation of TiO2 hollow nanostructure and is still desirable as an efficient route.6,10,23
In the present work we report a unique template free approach for the fabrication of hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres with functionalized C dots having very fast and efficient selective dye adsorption ability. Electronic spectral analysis revealed that solvothermal decomposition of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) with a synchronous presence of thiourea and citric acid only can produce such hollow architecture. Whereas, individual presence of the reagents with TTIP formed solid spheres without any accumulation of functionalized C dots on the surface. As the surface of the as prepared TiO2 hollow spheres was found to be decorated with functionalized graphitic C dots (CF@THS) a thorough XPS analysis of CF@THS was done to evaluate the nature of the functional groups present. It was found that, this CF@THS showed a very fast and selective dye adsorption due to the presence of these functionalized C dots on the surface of the spheres. Whereas, the products obtained from individual components did not show such significant dye adsorption due to the absence of functional groups on the surface. It is noteworthy to mention here that, adsorption is a more effective way to remove organic pollutants from water than that of photocatalytic dye degradation because photodegradation of dye results in some organic molecules as side products which may also contaminate water; but adsorption can remove the total dye content without the formation of any secondary pollutant molecules. In this report we not only investigated the growth mechanism of our sample but also explored its multifunctional properties which include selective dye adsorption and photochemical activities. Thus basically, novelty of our work can be attributed to such very fast dye adsorption ability of CF@THS with high adsorption efficiency and selectivity. The adsorption isotherm and the kinetics were further investigated to understand the actual adsorption mechanism. The equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be 102.04 mg g−1 which is higher than some earlier reports where mesoporous materials such as silica and silica–titania were used as adsorbents.27,28
To recycle the dye adsorbed material, organic free hollow spherical anatase TiO2 was prepared by calcining the dye adsorbed CF@THS. This calcined product i.e. pure titania hollow sphere (THS) without any morphological deformation was further used as an efficient photoanode in DSSC and as a reusable photocatalyst. Very recently, Li et al. have reported the synthesis of C dots and the TiO2 nanohybrid composite as a photocatalyst under UV light (λ = 254 nm).23 But our THS showed a high rate (9.36 × 10−3 min−1) of photodegradation of methylene blue under very low power (7 mW cm−2) and less harmful 365 nm (UV A) light source. It was also used as an efficient photoanode in DSSC with light to energy conversion efficiency of 6.48%.29,30 The efficiency of THS as a photoanode was found to be higher when compared with commercially available P25 grade TiO2 under similar experimental conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals used
The following analytical grade purity chemicals were purchased and used in this study without further purification: titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR), methyl violet (MV), I2 and lithium iodide (LiI) (Aldrich); thiourea (TU) and absolute ethanol (EtOH) (Merck); rhodamine B (RhB) and citric acid (CA) (s.d. fine chem Ltd); TiO2 P25 (Reinste Nanoventure, India), N719 dye and 1,2 dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (solaronix).
2.2 Synthesis of CF@THS
The as prepared C dot-functionalized titania hollow sphere composite was synthesized using TTIP as the TiO2 precursor, thiourea and citric acid as capping agents. Initially an ethanolic solution of citric acid (1.36 g in 20 ml ethanol) was added to TTIP (1 g) under stirring conditions and stirring was continued for another 5 min. Saturated thiourea solution (0.536 g in 20 ml ethanol) was then mixed and allowed to stir for 2 h. After that the whole mixture was sealed into a teflon-lined autoclave followed by heating at 180 °C for 12 h. The resulting greenish brown powder was collected by membrane filtration and washed thoroughly with ethanol and acetone many times. The collected powder sample was dried at 60 °C and labeled as CF@THS. Control experiments were performed to understand the synchronous effect of citric acid and thiourea towards the architectural design of TiO2. For this purpose, TTIP was solvothermally treated individually with ethanol solution of thiourea and citric acid, under the same experimental conditions and the products obtained were marked as TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2, respectively.
2.3 Dye adsorption study
To check the adsorption ability of CF@THS at room temperature (25 °C), 1.8 mg of the CF@THS powder sample was dispersed in 10 ml of a 0.50 × 10−4 (M) MB solution and allowed to stir continuously. Progress of dye adsorption on CF@THS was monitored by recording UV-Vis spectra (using Cary Scan 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer) with a specific time interval. The same sample was further used without any washing for reusability test. Additionally, selectivity towards dye adsorption was checked by performing the same experiment with MV, MO, CR and RhB solutions of same molar concentration. A dye adsorption study of MB was also performed with the control samples TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2.
2.4 Synthesis of THS
Dye adsorbed CF@THS was calcined at 450 °C for 6 h to obtain organic free anatase TiO2 hollow spheres which were labeled as THS.
2.5 Characterization
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern of the powder samples were recorded with a Rigaku smartlab diffractometer using 200 mA and 45 kV (9 kW) and Cu-Kα radiation at a scan rate 4° 2θ min−1 with powder mode attachment. The Raman spectrum of the sample was acquired with Renishaw InVia micro Raman spectroscopy. Photoluminescence emission spectra of CF@THS were recorded with a Photon Technology International QM-30 spectrometer. FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet 380) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 by the KBr pellet method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was done with a PHI 5000 Versa probe II XPS system having a source of Al Kα and charge neutralizer at room temperature. The base pressure was maintained at 6 × 10−10 mbar with an energy resolution of 0.6 eV. For the field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) study, ethanol suspension of the powder was drop cast on a single side polished silicon wafer and analysis was done with a Zeiss Supra 35VP field emission Scanning Electron microscope to check the surface morphology of the samples. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis was done with a Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV. For this purpose a tiny drop of the ethanol suspension was placed on a lacey carbon coated copper grid, dried and observed through TEM. The energy dispersive X-ray scattering (EDS) analyses of the samples were done by the EDS facility attached with FESEM. Photocurrent measurements using THS as the photoanode (for detail of cell fabrication see ESI.1†) were done with a Keithley instrument (4200 SCS) attached with a solar simulator (model SS50AAA-EM) of Photo Emission Tech., Inc. (Camarillo, California).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 GIXRD study
The formation of the titania anatase phase was first confirmed by the XRD study of the CF@THS. Phase identification was confirmed by ICDD materials library. The high angle XRD pattern of CF@THS (Fig. 1a) showed a relatively broad peak due to the formation of small crystallites. The observed peaks at 2θ values 25.58, 48.51, 55.04, 62.780 correspond to the (101), (200), (211), (204) reflections, respectively of the anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 01-075-2552). The average crystallite size of CF@THS (Fig. 1a) was calculated by using Scherrer's equation based on the (101) diffraction peak and the crystallite size was found to be ∼1.5 nm (CF@THS).

3.2 Raman spectroscopic study
The Raman spectrum of the CF@THS is shown in Fig. 1b. Interestingly, the presence of characteristic bands of graphitic carbon material was observed in the Raman spectrum of CF@THS (Fig. 1b).31 The bands at 1370 (D band) and 1582 cm−1 (G band) with ID/IG > 1 for CF@THS are assigned for the surface functionalized graphite like C dots residing on the TiO2 surface.32 In the control experiments we observed that hydrothermal treatment of citric acid and thiourea solution mixture (without TTIP) cannot produce graphitic C dots.33,34 In addition to C related peaks the Raman spectrum of CF@THS also shows bands at 144 (Eg), 399 (A1g), 518 (B1g) and 639 cm−1 (an overtone of Eg) due to anatase TiO2.35 Thus the Raman study supports the formation of anatase TiO2. Also, the Raman study supports the formation of anatase TiO2 functionalized with graphitic C.
3.3 Photoluminescence (PL) spectral study
A PL spectral study was carried out to confirm the presence of graphitic C dots on the TiO2 surface. The PL spectrum of CF@THS is shown in Fig. 2a. For this purpose the dilute ethanol dispersion of the sample was excited at 365 nm. CF@THS showed a characteristic emission band at around 453 nm (Fig. 2a) confirming the surface state emission of C dots.32 The images of the ethanol dispersions of CF@THS under normal and UV light (λ = 365 nm) are shown in the inset of Fig. 2 and S1,† respectively.

3.4 FTIR study
The FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2b) of CF@THS shows several peaks related to amide and carboxylic acid groups along with Ti–O–Ti vibrations. The bands at 3400–3100 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching frequencies of O–H and N–H groups formed during the condensation reaction of thiourea and citric acid.33 The shoulder peak observed at 1710 cm−1 can be assigned to the CO group originating from the functionalized carboxylic acid. The existence of amide CO at 1633 cm−1 with the N–H and C–N bond stretching frequencies at 1396 and 1183 cm−1, respectively confirm the presence of the –CONH2 group.36 The appearance of broad absorbance bands in the range of 700–400 cm−1 can be assigned to the Ti–O–Ti stretching in TiO2.37 Thus from the FTIR study of CF@THS, it can be concluded that the C dots present on the TiO2 surface are functionalized with groups like –COOH, –CONH2 and –NH2.
3.5 XPS analysis
As the FTIR spectral study of CF@THS showed the presence of functional groups on the surface of the C dots a thorough X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) study of CF@THS was performed to analyze the exact nature of the functional groups along with their atomic concentrations. The surface survey scan along with the high resolution spectra of C 1s, N 1s and Ti 2p are shown in Fig. 3. The survey scan (Fig. 3a) of the product shows the peaks at 284.5, 400.6, 458.5 and 531.5 eV corresponding to C 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s respectively.38 This indicates that the CF@THS is mainly composed of C, N, O and Ti. A deconvolution of the high resolution C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) by the Voigt function39 shows distinguishable peaks for CC, C–C, C–N, C–O and CO groups at 284.35 (graphitic C dots), 284.85, 285.6 (amine and amide), 286.6 (attached O–H), 287.9 (amide) and 288.8 eV (acid) respectively.31,34,38,39 In addition, the peak for π–π* interactions of the C–C bond at 290.6 eV reveals the graphitic nature of the carbon dots.39 This data supports the results of the FTIR analysis regarding the existence of functional groups. Fig. 3c shows the deconvoluted high resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s. Here the peaks appeared at 399.5 and 400.2 eV which can be assigned to the amide and surface amine groups attached to the C dots, respectively.34 The XPS spectrum of Ti 2p (Fig. 3d) shows two energy levels at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV for Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 respectively.2 The atomic ratio of Ti, C, N, O were obtained from the area of the corresponding peaks and found to be 1:2.8:0.59:3.09.40 From XPS the overall atomic concentration of carbon present in the sample was calculated to be ∼37%. The estimated atomic % of carbon including graphitic C dots associated with different functional groups is summarized in Table 1.

3.6 Structure evolution through electron microscopic study
FESEM studies of CF@THS revealed the formation of uniform hollow spheres of diameter 1–2 μm with a hierarchical nanostructure. A series of TEM and FESEM studies of CF@THS were carried out to understand the growth mechanism as well the dual role of capping agents towards designing. It was found from TEM that the co-existence of both thiourea and citric acid was crucial to obtain the hollow architecture. It is noteworthy here that non-hollow crystalline TiO2 spheres were obtained when TTIP was solvothermally treated individually with thiourea or citric acid under similar experimental conditions (Fig. S2†). Interestingly, when thiourea and citric acid were simultaneously introduced with TTIP, hierarchical hollow spheres were formed (Fig. 4). The 12 h solvothermal treatment of the reaction mixture at 180 °C resulted in CF@THS as a product. Under such conditions the formation of hollow spheres is controlled by two factors namely Oswald ripening and bubble templating.6,26,41 Oswald ripening is a relatively long process where the formation starts with the generation of solid spheres which further transform into a hollow structure by the dissolution of inner crystals and its recrystallization to the outer part, whereas in the case of bubble templating the generated crystallites undergo accumulation on the bubble surface resulting in the formation of a hollow structure. Thus in the cases of individual components Oswald ripening could be the predominating path as observed by the electron microscopic studies (Fig. S2†). Whereas the formation of CF@THS involved the bubble templating process as the controlling factor. To understand the mechanism of hollow sphere formation, TEM and FESEM studies were performed with the products formed at different reaction time intervals (1.5 h, 5 h and 12 h) and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. S3 and S4†). On the basis of our observations the whole process can be schematically represented as shown in Fig. 5. Here the reaction started with the formation of small nanoparticles which possessed high surface energies. These nanoparticles further underwent oriented assembly and formed nanoflakes/sheets. Jiang et al. reported that when the surface energy of the solid–liquid interface is isotropic, the reaction would end up with spherical nanoparticles as a product because spheres possess the lowest surface energy. On the other hand, anisotropic size distribution with different surface energy leads to the formation of modified nanostructures (1D, 2D and 3D nanostructures) upon the aggregation of the nanoparticles.42 The presence of anisotropic nanoparticles with irregular shape can be observed from the TEM image (Fig. S3b†) of the product obtained after 1.5 h. It is expected that the nanoflake/sheet like structure of TiO2 was formed due to the aggregation of these anisotropic nanoparticles. TEM and FESEM images shown in Fig. S3a and b,† respectively for the product obtained after 1.5 h also support this explanation. With further progress of the reaction (after 5 h), the preformed TiO2 minimize the interfacial energy and form spherical hollow nanostructures.41 Actually, there are plenty of gaseous bubbles (formed due to the reaction between TU, CA; see Fig. S5†) present in the reaction medium due to the thermal decomposition of thiourea and citric acid. The presence of these bubbles in the airtight autoclave formed a gas–liquid equilibrium which facilitated the accumulation of TiO2 nanoflakes/sheets on the bubble surface.43 The FESEM and TEM images of the product after 5 h reaction are shown in Fig. S3c and d,† respectively. The magnified portions of the corresponding images shown in the inset clearly reveal the stacking of the nanoflakes/sheets assembled around the gas bubbles. Finally, after 12 h the spheres get ruptured unveiling the hollow interior formed (Fig. 4). Moreover, the images acquired in STEM mode (inset of Fig. 4b and S4†) also clearly show the stacking of nanoflakes/sheets making the architecture. Interestingly, the polymeric compound formed from thiourea and citric acid under the hydrothermal conditions resulted in functionalized C dots (Fig. S5†)33 which were accumulated on the surface of the spheres forming a coating layer on it (CF@THS). For better understanding of the formation of C dots, a TEM study of the filtrate part of the hydrothermal product CF@THS was undertaken. The TEM image (Fig. S6†) clearly shows the presence of C dots. EDS area mapping (Fig. S7†) of CF@THS performed during FESEM showed a uniform distribution of C, Ti, N which again supports the presence of a homogeneous distribution of functionalized C dots on the TiO2 surface.

3.7 BET analysis
Nitrogen sorption analysis was undertaken to obtain the information about the specific surface area, porosity and pore size distribution of CF@THS. Fig. S8† shows the adsorption–desorption isotherm with the corresponding pore size distributions obtained from the respective desorption branch of the isotherms. CF@THS shows a type IV isotherm (Fig. S8†) characteristic for typical mesoporous materials. The hysteresis loop present here can be identified as a type B hysteresis loop classified by de Boer or the IUPAC specified type H3 loop.44,45 This type of hysteresis loop signified the presence of slit like pores formed by the assembly of plate/sheet like units.46 The surface area of CF@THS was found to be 81 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution of CF@THS was calculated from a desorption branch of the isotherm by applying the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Here, the narrow pore size distribution (inset of Fig. S8†) revealed the existence of uniform pores with an average diameter of ∼3.8 nm generated from the interspace between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the other relatively broad distribution for larger pores are due to the interspace between the nanoflakes/sheets.47,48
3.8 Dye adsorption study
The as prepared CF@THS attains a high adsorption capability due to the presence of functionalized graphitic C dots on its surface which is the crucial factor for such high adsorption rate. It may also be noted that TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2 prepared under the same conditions showed only insignificant dye adsorption (Fig. S9†) due to their non-hollow structures and the absence of suitable carbonaceous matter. A comparative study of FTIR spectra of TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2 (Fig. S10†) clearly revealed the significant absence of functional groups on the surfaces. It was further confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S11†) of the samples where significantly less weight loss was observed for TU–TiO2 (5%) and CA-TiO2 (10%) than CF@THS (44%) due to the decomposition of organics. It was also observed that unlike CF@THS the dye adsorbed at the initial stage on CA–TiO2 spontaneously reverted back after a certain time (Fig. S9†) thus causing a problem in the adsorption process. A detailed study (section 2.3) of adsorption capability was done with CF@THS. Fig. 6a shows the UV-Vis spectral study of MB (0.50 × 10−4 M) adsorption by CF@THS. Only 1.8 mg sample was sufficient for 10 ml 0.50 × 10−4 (M) MB solution. It took only 6 min to consume 98.6% of the dye present in the solution. The adsorption capability (qt) of the sample was calculated using eqn (1)49 and the qtvs. time plot is shown in Fig. 6b. (1)where C0 (mg L−1) is the initial concentration of MB and Ct (mg L−1) indicates the concentration after time t (min), V (L) is the volume of MB solution. m represents the amount of adsorbent (CF@THS) used.
 Fig. 6  Time dependent UV-Vis spectral analysis of the MB adsorption by CF@THS (a) and adsorption capacity vs. time plot (b). Inset of (a) shows the reusability of CF@THS as adsorbent for two successive adsorptions. 
To understand the manner of interaction between the adsorbent and dye molecules Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models were tested. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm can be correlated to the localized monolayer adsorption where all the active sorption sites are assumed to be identical with constant surface energy,13,49,50 whereas the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model is considered for the non-ideal multilayer adsorption of adsorbate molecules on the heterogeneous surface energy system.13,49,50 The linear form of the mathematical expressions of these models along with the experimental data obtained from the respective plots are summarized in Table 2. In the expressions qe (mg g−1) is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and Ce (mg L−1) is the residual concentration of the dye at equilibrium. For Langmuir models KL is the Langmuir constant corresponding to the adsorption energy and qm is the maximum adsorption capacity. In the case of the Freundlich model KF is the Freundlich constant and 1/n is the heterogeneity factor. It is to be noted here that larger the n value, the adsorption isotherm will be more nonlinear. The experimental data for MB adsorption were fitted with both the models and is shown in Fig. 7. The correlation coefficient (R2) for the plot fitted with the Langmuir model (Fig. 7a) was found to be 0.99413 which is considerably higher than that obtained from the Freundlich model (Fig. 7b) (R2 = 0.93026). Thus, it was found that the Langmuir model showed a satisfactory fitting compared to the Freundlich model and this also implies the monolayer adsorption of the dye molecules on the CF@THS surface.49

Further evolution of adsorption kinetics and the rate of MB on CF@THS were done by employing two kinetic models and the corresponding equations are shown in Table 2. For both the models qe and qt are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and any time t (min), respectively. In the case of the Lagergren pseudo-1st order model (Fig. 8a) k1 (min−1) is the pseudo-1st order rate constant and t (min) is the contact time between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Whereas, for the pseudo-2nd order model (Fig. 8b) k2 (g mg−1 min−1) is the corresponding rate constant and t is the time. All the experimental data obtained from the fitted plots are summarized in Table 2. From the value of fitted correlation constant R2 it was assumed that the pseudo-2nd order kinetic model was suitable for MB adsorption on CF@THS. Accordingly, the value of qe calculated for 18.69 mg L−1 MB solution from the pseudo-2nd order plot was found to be 106.16 mg g−1 which is in agreement with the experimental value (qe, exp = 102.04 mg g−1). However, there was a significant variation between these two values for the pseudo-1st order kinetic model. This result reveals involvement of chemical adsorption50 of MB on CF@THS which could be due to the interaction of δ− site of C dots residing on the surface of CF@THS with δ+ site of MB (Fig. 9b). Interestingly this basic requirement makes CF@THS selective towards MB and MV. From Fig. S12† it can be easily understood that there is no adsorption of CR, MO and RhB on CF@THS. Here we are assuming that although RhB has a +ve site (Fig. S13†), successive presence of δ− site makes it inert towards CF@THS. The selectivity test was performed with a solution mixture of MO and MB of the same molar concentration (each 5 × 10−5 M in the mixture) where CF@THS showed a very selective adsorption of MB over MO (Fig. 9a and b).

 Fig. 9  (a) UV-Vis spectral analysis for selective dye adsorption and (b) a schematic representation showing plausible mechanism. The schematic fig. shows that the negative charges on functionalized carbon (CF) dots repel the dye molecules with negative charge (MO), and adsorbs selectively the dye (MB) with a positive charge. 
For a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism with diffusion, the intra-particle diffusion kinetic model based on Weber and Morris was employed.14 In the empirical equation shown in Table 2, kdi is the intra-particle diffusion rate constant (mg g−1 min−1) and the intercept c represents the thickness of the boundary layer. If this intra-particle diffusion process is the rate determining step then the qtvs. √t plot would be a linear one. But here we obtained a tri-linear plot (Fig. 8c) implying the existence of three successive adsorption steps.14,50 The sharp 1st region relates to the instantaneous external surface adsorption step where the high concentration of MB was the driving force, such high adsorption rate was followed by a relatively slow step involving the intra-particle diffusion which is basically the rate limiting step. The final region is for the equilibrium stage where intra-particle diffusion rate slowed down due to a very low concentration of the dye molecules. Table 2 summarizes all the experimental data for these three steps obtained from the linearly fitted plot (Fig. 8c). To check the reusability after 1st cycle adsorption, the same adsorbed CF@THS sample was further used for another cycle without any washing and it still showed an effective adsorption capacity thus ensuring reusability. As the sample was already adsorbed in 1st and 2nd consecutive cycles, the 3rd cycle shows relatively less dye adsorption. The inset of Fig. 6a shows the % of dye adsorbed in the consecutive two cycles.
3.9 Recycling of dye adsorbed CF@THS
As CF@THS can only be used for two cycles, we thought to calcine this dye adsorbed CF@THS in order to obtain organic free anatase TiO2 hollow spheres (THS) for further recycling as a photocatalyst and a DSSC photoanode. For this purpose the dye adsorbed CF@THS was heat-treated at 450 °C in air for 6 h. The FTIR spectrum (Fig. S14a†) of the calcined THS revealed complete removal of organic related matter and showed only O–H and Ti–O–Ti related peaks. The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S14b†) shows signature of anatase TiO2 with relatively sharper peaks suggesting better crystallization. The average crystalline size is calculated using (101) reflection to be 8 nm which is larger than the crystallite size of TiO2 (1.5 nm) in CF@THS (see Fig. 1a). Interestingly, the TEM studies of THS (Fig. 10) revealed crystalline anatase TiO2 hollow architecture with similar morphology like the original CF@THS. The HRTEM image and the SAED pattern of THS are shown in Fig. 10b and its inset, respectively. The presence of continuous and curvy fringe patterns (Fig. 10b) of the calcined THS sample reconfirms the fact that the nanoflakes/sheets were originally assembled to form the hollow spheres. The distance between these lattice fringes (0.35 nm) corresponds to the d value of the (101) plane as also observed in XRD (Fig. S14b†). BET analysis of THS shows that the surface area of the THS has been increased to 126 m2 g−1) upon heat treatment at 450 °C in air because of the removal of organics from the dye adsorbed CF@THS. Fig. S15a† shows the type IV adsorption–desorption isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop confirming the existence of the unaltered structure i.e. stacking of nanoflakes/sheets.47 Here also the pore size distribution (Fig. S15b†) is not uniform and the pore sizes are clearly divided into two regimes. The smaller pores of diameter ∼3.5 nm are from the original spacing between the nanoparticles and the larger pores centered at ∼9 nm with broad distribution are due to the interspace between the nanoflakes/sheets.48 THS has been further employed as a DSSC photoanode as well as a reusable photocatalyst.

3.9.1 Photocurrent measurement using THS as photoanode. 
The presence of functionalized C dots restricted the adhesion of CF@THS paste on the FTO coated glass surface and for that reason DSSC photocurrent measurement of CF@THS could not be performed. The photocurrent density (Jsc)–voltage (Voc) characteristics of the DSSC photoanodes were measured with THS and P25 having an active area of 0.08 cm2 and a film thickness of ∼6–7 μm. These films were prepared according to the procedure reported by Grätzel et al.51 and are discussed in section SI.1.† The cells were illuminated under a 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 light source. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 11a and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSSCs assembly with THS as an electrode showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.636 V, short-circuit-current density (Jsc) of 19.58 mA cm−2 and overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.48%. However, the control P25 exhibited Voc of 0.540 V, Jsc of 14.38 mA cm−2 and η 4.50%. So under a similar experimental set up the efficiency of THS was found to be higher than P25. Considering the earlier reports, this improved Jsc value for THS with respect to P25 as the control could be rationalized by the better dye adsorption and light scattering in the case of THS.25 The higher amount of dye loading can be understood due to a high specific surface area of THS (126 m2 g−1) in comparison with the P25 grade TiO2 (50 ± 10 m2 g−1).24 Whereas, improvement in Voc for THS can be attributed to the better light scattering due to its unique morphology.

3.9.2 Photocatalytic dye degradation study with THS. 
As a model experiment photocatalytic activity of THS was checked with the photodegradation of the MB dye while, the photocatalytic activity of CF@THS could not be conducted due to the fast adsorption of the dye molecule by the catalyst. The photocatalytic activity was measured with the decomposition of a 1.25 × 10−5 (M) methylene blue (MB) solution, with 1.5 mg of each (THS, TU–TiO2, CA–TiO2) TiO2 powder photocatalyst. For this purpose UV-A (λ = 365 nm) light source was used for irradiation which nicely matches with the band gap (3.2 eV) of TiO2 and the detail has been explained in our earlier report.35 The dye decomposition was monitored by the UV-Vis spectroscopic study as shown in Fig. 11b. Initially, although a little amount (∼20%) of dye adsorption was observed (Fig. 11b (i, ii)) but after completion of the reaction there was no signature of MB adsorbed on THS. Assuming the photodegradation process is a pseudo-first order reaction, the rate constant (k) was calculated from the slope of −ln(C/C0) vs. time plot and found to be 0.0936 min−1 (Fig. 11b (iii)). The sample was further reused for another three cycles, and the result shows no significant deterioration of photocatalytic activity. The reusability of the THS as a photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 11b (iv). XRD of the recovered sample after four consecutive cycles was checked and found to be similar as that of the initial one (Fig. S14b†). Further, nearly similar rate constant values in four consecutive catalytic cycles confirm the stability of the material. To justify the advantage of a hollow structure over the non-hollow, control experiments were also performed with TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2. It was found that in comparison with THS, the dye degradation efficiency of TU–TiO2 and CA–TiO2 (Fig. S16†) is insignificant. This result thus revealed that the presence of a void space within the structure was advantageous over that of non-hollow structures. Essentially, the hollow interior within THS facilitates the faster diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the active sites resulting in such enhanced photocatalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
In this work we have shown that functionalized C-dots decorated hierarchical hollow TiO2 spheres can be prepared by the solvothermal decomposition of titanium tetraisopropoxide in the presence of citric acid and thiourea. The dual existence of citric acid and thiourea is the key factor to designing such hollow architecture which was formed through the bubble templating mechanism. The presence of functionalized C dots with δ− site on hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres (CF@THS) makes it a very selective and fast dye adsorbent towards dyes (MB, MV) with +ve end. After the dye adsorption the organic content of the sample was burnt off to obtain crystalline anatase TiO2 hollow spheres (THS) without any deformation of the original structure. Such hierarchical THS showed improved photocatalytic activity and was found to be suitable as an efficient photoanode for DSSCs.
