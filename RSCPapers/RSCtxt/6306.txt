    , Accepted 3rd February 2018First published on 8th February 2018AbstractThe introduction of a carboxylate function into porphyrins allows a variety of modifications, including coordination and conjugation, which are central to enhance the efficiency of macrocycles in photonic materials and biological applications. Herein, a synthetic strategy to obtain 5-(4′-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin and its pyrrolidine-fused chlorin derivative was developed by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a carbomethoxyphenyl substituted porphyrin with an azomethine ylide, followed by hydrolysis under thermal acidic conditions. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the carbomethoxyphenyl porphyrin with N-methyl nitrone was also performed to give an isomeric mixture of isoxazolidine-fused chlorins, revealing lower selectivity and lower yields; in addition, retrocycloaddition of the isoxazolidine-fused chlorins was observed under the hydrolysis conditions. The resulting carboxyphenyl macrocycles were characterized using 1H and 19F NMR, ESI-MS and SC-XRD for 5-(4′-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin. In order to study the influence of coordination to a metal ion on the electronic properties of carboxyphenyl substituted porphyrins, a series of metal complexes of 5-(4′-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin and its pyrrolidine-fused chlorin derivative were synthesized by microwave-mediated metallation with Fe(III), Cu(II) and Zn(II) salts. EPR spectroscopy was particularly relevant to the characterization of the Cu(II) complexes of both macrocycles and to study the coordination chemistry of these ligands with Cu(II) ions.
Introduction
The excellency of porphyrin macrocycles as metal-complexing ligands is mainly due to the presence of a central N4 core. The coordination of this core with various metal ions has prompted several studies from a wide range of disciplines. Inspired by the diversity of uses found for metalloporphyrins by living organisms, the main focus for chemical research has been to fine-tune and control the physicochemical properties and functions of tetrapyrroles.1–3
The introduction of a metal ion into symmetric porphyrins (such as 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin) typically leads to an increase in the macrocycle planarity and molecular symmetry (e.g., D2h to D4h), causing changes in the electronic spectral features in the visible region (500–650 nm). The most evident of these alterations is the collapse from primarily four bands (due to partially overlapping x and y transitions) to a two-banded spectrum (wherein the x and y transitions are degenerate). For a chlorin (dihydroporphyrin), insertion of a metal does not cause a symmetry change, but it does typically cause a hypsochromic shift in the long-wavelength absorption band (620–650 nm).4 These spectral features render chlorins (as well as other porphyrins and hydroporphyrins) as promising photosensitizers (PS) in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer.5 Some examples of clinically approved porphyrinic PSs include 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (marketed in the EU as Foscan®),6 used in head and neck cancer patients,7 and chlorin e6,8 which showed anti-tumor effects in superficial squamous cell carcinoma patients.9 The fluorinated bacteriochlorin (7,8,17,18-tetrahydroporphyrin) Redaporfin®,10 is currently in clinical trials, and is being revealed to be effective against head and neck cancer11 as well as pigmented melanoma.12
Although the metal complexes of these macrocycles have been less explored, the palladium bacteriochlorin TOOKAD® is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of prostate cancer patients.13
Access to peripherally functionalized porphyrins, chlorins and their metal complexes has been widely pursued using natural,14 and semi-15 or totally synthetic macrocycles.16,17 In the solar cells research area, the design of porphyrins with an anchoring functional group has proven to be crucial for a stable coupling between the semiconductor and dye, as well as for an efficient electron injection between the latter two.18–20
Regarding potential biological applications, the design of porphyrins with a carboxylate anchoring group has shown promising results for the anchoring of porphyrin PSs to lipid membranes,21–23 nanoconjugated synthesis with amphiphilic porphyrins,24 and the synthesis of porphyrin–peptide conjugates.25
The use of fluorinated porphyrins ensures several advantageous features such as greater efficacy of singlet state electron transfer, a long-lived triplet state and oxidation resistance.26 In fact, fluorinated Fe(III) and Cu(II) porphyrins are efficient and resistant oxidation catalysts for relevant processes that use environmentally compatible conditions,27–29 whereas diamagnetic complexes such as Zn(II) porphyrins are known photocatalysts.30 Regarding dihydroporphyrins, novel stereo and electronic effects due to the asymmetry of metallochlorins31 can condition the approach of substrates to these macrocycles’ metals and determine stereoselectivity or, in the case of light-driven processes, the different absorption characteristics can improve the efficiency of the processes.32 In the development of advanced catalytic systems, the presence of an anchoring functional group is important for the heterogenization and recyclability of the catalysts.33
Bearing in mind the importance of these anchor porphyrins, we describe our latest results involving the synthesis of 5-(4′-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 1 and its conversion into isoxazolidine-fused chlorin 2 and pyrrolidine-fused chlorin 3.
We employed a series of tetrapyrrole macrocycles carrying two distinct functionalities: (i) a carboxyphenyl moiety, which enables a high variety of derivatizations including coordination and conjugation, and (ii) three pentafluorophenyl rings, which confer suitable reactivity to the porphyrin for it to be used as a dipolarophile in 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions (1,3-DCs);34,35 the addition of a nitrone and an azomethine ylide would provide chlorins 2 and 3 incorporating an isoxazolidine- or pyrrolidine-fused ring, respectively. Regarding the synthetic amenability, stability and ease of preparation, the pyrrolidine-fused chlorin 3 was chosen to be used in coordination studies involving the three biologically important metal ions Fe(III), Cu(II) and Zn(II), in a comprehensive comparison with the parent porphyrin 1.
Two major contributions in coordination studies involving pyrrolidine-fused chlorins include: (i) the studies by the R. Herges group,36 focusing on the use of Ni(II) complexes of pyrrolidine-fused chlorin and isobacteriochlorin as promising platforms for spin-state switching systems for applications in functional medical imaging; and (ii) the use of Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes of the same chlorin and glycoconjugated derivatives, as efficient 1O2 generators, proposed by the M. Tanihara and S. Yano groups.37,38
A simple approach to obtain metallochlorins incorporating the pyrrolidine-fused ring might be the use of 1,3-DC of a metalloporphyrin with an azomethine ylide. However, previous results revealed that the insertion of Zn(II) into the porphyrin leads to a substantial decrease in the metalloporphyrin reactivity and consequently, the corresponding Zn(II) complex of the chlorin is obtained in a very low yield.39 Now we are describing a broadly applicable method for metallating tetrapyrrolic macrocycles 1 and 3, involving the use of a microwave irradiation protocol and acetonitrile as the solvent. An evaluation of the spectroscopic properties of the metal free forms and complexes was performed. EPR spectroscopy was used to characterize the macrocyclic ligand coordination sites.
Results and discussion
I. Synthesis

A. Porphyrin 1 and 1,3-DC reaction with 1,3-dipoles. 
Acknowledging the different reported procedures,19,40 we decided to carry out the synthesis of the 5-(4′-carbomethoxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 1a by the general method of pyrrole condensation with methyl 4-formylbenzoate and pentafluorobenzaldehyde, in a mixture of nitrobenzene/acetic acid.41
The initial studies leading to the synthesis of chlorins were performed using porphyrin 1a and N-methyl nitrone as a 1,3-dipole (Scheme 1, route A). Due to the asymmetry of both precursors, this reaction would lead to the formation of four possible isomeric chlorins incorporating an isoxazolidine-fused unit at adjacent or opposite β-pyrrolic positions regarding the 4-carbomethoxyphenyl group, with two possible orientations. In fact, after purification by flash chromatography (silica), the products isolated included: an isomeric mixture of chlorins 2a and b in 29% yield (which could not be separated by chromatography) and two minor chlorins 2c and 2d, while no bisadducts were detected. The ESI-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectra) of chlorins 2a–d show the same [M + H]+ peak at 1002.16, confirming the structures proposed (see the ESI,† Fig. S30–S32).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic approach to obtain porphyrin 1, chlorins 2 and 3 and selected metal complexes. Reagents and conditions: (i) 1:2 mixture of TFA/HCl 37% v/v, 90 °C (70 °C for 2a,b); (ii) 10 molar equivalents of metal salt (FeCl2·4H2O; Cu(OAc)2·H2O; or Zn(OAc)2·H2O), acetonitrile, microwave irradiation; (iii) N-methyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride, paraformaldehyde, K2CO3, 60 °C, toluene, 48 hours under nitrogen atmosphere; and (iv) N-methylglycine, paraformaldehyde, 120 °C, toluene, 9 hours under nitrogen atmosphere. 
A comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of these chlorins revealed, in addition to the expected signals, interesting features for the inner NH protons, namely: (i) a broad singlet at −1.70 ppm in chlorins 2a and b; (ii) two broad singlets at −2.03 and −2.08 ppm in chlorin 2c and (iii) two broad singlets at −2.03 and −2.11 ppm in chlorin 2d (see the ESI,† Fig. S3, S6 and S9). Such signals suggest higher deformations in the core shape of chlorins 2c and 2d, leading to the deformation of the macrocycle from planarity, which is in agreement with the isoxazolidine-fused ring located in the adjacent position to the p-COOMeC6H4 group, but less deformed structures for chlorins 2a and b, suggesting the localization of the isoxazolidine-fused ring between two C6F5 rings. The 19F NMR spectra provided additional information necessary to identify the orientation of the isoxazolidine-fused ring in these chlorins. The number of non-equivalent pentafluorophenyl rings, expressed by the integral values of o-fluorine atoms, decreases in the following order: (i) four sets of signals in a 1:1:3:1 ratio are perceptible in chlorins 2a and b; (ii) three sets in a 1:4:1 ratio in chlorin 2c and (iii) two sets in a 1:5 ratio in chlorin 2d (see the ESI,† Fig. S4, S7 and S10). A comparison with the 19F NMR data for the analogue resulting from the 1,3-DC of the symmetric 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (TPFPP) with N-methyl nitrone42 allows the assignment of the signal (double) at −139.70 ppm in chlorin 2c to the neighbouring o-F, since it is more influenced by the electronegativity of the oxygen atom of the isoxazolidine ring (−139.51 ppm in the former chlorin). Since this signal is collapsed to a multiplet at −136.62 to −137.28 ppm in chlorin 2d, it may be concluded that the oxygen atom of the isoxazolidine is oriented towards the p-COOMeC6H4 group. In the spectrum of chlorins 2a and b, a sum of signals is perceptible, which is in accordance with the presence of an isomeric mixture of chlorins containing the two possible oxygen orientations.
Taking into consideration the low yields obtained for chlorins 2a–d and the number of isomers that can be formed, we decided to replace the asymmetrical N-methyl nitrone with a symmetrical azomethine ylide. This synthetic approach would be more convenient since only two isomeric pyrrolidine fused-chlorins can be formed (Scheme 1, route B).
After chromatographic purification, we were pleased to verify that chlorin 3a was isolated as the main product (50% yield), while the isomeric chlorin 3b was obtained in a substantial minor amount (both exhibiting [M + H]+= 1000.18) (see the ESI,† Fig. S33 and S34). In addition, a complex mixture of isomeric isobacteriochlorins (iBC) bisadducts was obtained, with [M + H]+ = 1057.23 and λmax = 574 and 652 nm.
The formation of six isomeric iBCs was expected, as indicated in Fig. 1, but iBC 4a was isolated as the most abundant isomer (see the ESI,† Fig. S18). A less deformed structure was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of chlorin 3a, evidenced by the appearance of three signals belonging to the 6 protons linked to the sp3 carbons and a broad singlet at −1.57 ppm attributed to the inner NH protons (see the ESI,† Fig. S12). This clearly contrasts with the spectrum of chlorin 3b, which exhibits a split of signals (five signals) corresponding to the 6 protons linked to the sp3 carbons and two broad singlets at −2.02 and −1.94 ppm, consistent with a more deformed structure (see the ESI,† Fig. S15).

B. Ester hydrolysis and microwave-mediated metallations. 
The hydrolysis of the methyl protecting group of porphyrin 1a was performed by a thermal treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and conc. HCl (1:2) to give porphyrin 1 with a 93% yield. The same treatment (thermal acidic hydrolysis) was applied to the isomeric chlorins 2a and b providing two products. Here, after separation by preparative TLC, the product with a lower Rf was identified as the target chlorin 2 (35% yield), while the product with a higher Rf was porphyrin 1 (45% recovered), the latter probably resulting from concomitant hydrolysis and retrocycloaddition processes.
The thermal instability associated with the occurrence of retrocycloaddition in nitrone-derived mono- and bisadducts has already been observed in previous work42 and has been pointed out as a major drawback of this synthetic route. On the other hand, with chlorin 3a, the hydrolysis successfully afforded chlorin 3; here no retrocycloaddition was observed.
The metallation of tetrapyrrolic macrocycles is often recognized as an apparently simple reaction, however depending on the nature of metal ions, for instance Fe(III), the reaction may require long reaction times, the use of high temperatures and harmful or corrosive solvents.
In this work, the metallation of the porphyrinic macrocycles 1 and 3 with FeCl2·4H2O was carried out under microwave irradiation (Table 1, entries 1 and 4) according to the protocol of Rebelo et al.,43 replacing N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with acetonitrile as the solvent, thereby preventing the nucleophilic substitution of the p-fluorine atoms of the pentafluorophenyl rings by dimethylamine, which is generated by the thermal decomposition of DMF.44

In addition, it was found that stirring the reaction mixture with iron(II) chloride prior to heating, favours the metallation of the porphyrin, with this metal ion being subsequently oxidized to Fe(III) during heating.43 Microwave-mediated metallations with Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Zn(OAc)2·2H2O were similarly carried out (Table 1, entries 2, 3, 5 and 6), affording the corresponding complexes within a few minutes, with yields of up to 76%.

II. Characterization of compounds

A. Crystal structure properties of porphyrin 1. 
It was possible to obtain crystals of porphyrin 1, with enough quality for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystalline structure was determined in the monoclinic system and C2/c space group (Fig. 2). The asymmetric unit comprises a molecule of porphyrin 1 and one and a half molecules of n-hexane, as the crystallization solvent. Comparing the crystallographic data of TPFPP45 with the data from porphyrin 1, a slight distortion of the meso carbon atoms from the plane defined by the four central N-atoms of porphyrin 1 can be observed. The dihedral angles of the meso aryl substituent groups relative to this same four N-atom plane were calculated to be 72°, 79°, 79° and 80°. It was also observed that the adjacent porphyrin molecules interact through hydrogen bonds (O–H⋯O) from the two carboxyphenyl groups, leading to the formation of dimeric species (see the ESI,† Fig. S45a). Additionally, these dimers are involved in an extended network of weak hydrogen bonds, namely C–H⋯F (not represented), leading to a global packing with spaces (channels and pockets) occupied by n-hexane molecules (see the ESI,† Fig. S45b and c).

B. Photophysical properties. 
Porphyrin 1 has an etio type absorption spectrum, where the Q bands III and I have a significant decrease in intensity. The absorption spectral features of this porphyrin are very similar to those of TPFPP,46 with a Bx(0,0) band at 409 nm and a shoulder at 370 nm, corresponding to By(0,0). The Q bands appear at 505, 536, 582 and 653 nm, with Q bands IV and II having the highest intensity. The absorption features of the 1Fe spectrum (for example, its broadness) might be explained by the influence of methanol. This influence has been comprehensively established through the work of A. T. Bell's group on the chloroiron(III) complex of TPFPP,47,48 which was shown to exhibit methanol-facilitated dissociation into cations and anions (i.e., FeTPFPP+ and Cl−), and therefore a very different absorption spectrum from the molecularly dissolved chloroiron(III) complex in an aprotic solvent (e.g., acetonitrile). The position of the B(0,0) bands of both these metal complexes is practically unchanged, with only a slight hypsochromic shift observed in 1Cu and a 9 nm bathochromic shift in 1Zn, compared with the porphyrin 1 spectrum. As expected, the Q bands of these spectra collapse from 4 to 2 bands, after metal ion insertion. In addition, the lowest ε value for the B(0,0) band was observed for 1Fe (ε ≈ 65.000 M−1 cm−1), while the highest value was observed for 1Zn (ε ≈ 346.000 M−1 cm−1), both in methanol (see all determined absorption and emission coefficients in the ESI,† Table S2).
The absorption spectrum of chlorin 3 shows a 9 nm bathochromic shift of the Bx(0,0) band and a high intensity Qy(0,0) band at 647 nm (ε ≈ 35.000 M−1 cm−1), as expected for this class of hydroporphyrins. The ε value determined for the Bx(0,0) band of chlorin 3 in methanol was ε ≈ 115.000 M−1 cm−1, which is slightly lower than observed for porphyrin 1. The spectra of all metal complexes of chlorin 3 in methanol preserve the high intensity Qy(0,0) band, although in the spectra of 3Cu and 3Zn a 30 nm hypsochromic shift of this same band was observed (Fig. 3). It was also observed that for the 3Zn Qy(0,0) band, the ε value increased (from ε ≈ 35.000 M−1 cm−1 to 50.000 M−1 cm−1) with respect to the value obtained for the Qy(0,0) band of chlorin 3.
 Fig. 3  Absorption and emission spectra of macrocycles 1 and 3 and their metal complexes in methanol: absorption spectra in the Q band region of porphyrin 1 and metalloporphyrins 1Fe, 1Cu and 1Zn (a); emission spectra of porphyrin 1 and the corresponding metal complexes (b); absorption spectra in the Q band region of chlorin 3 and the corresponding metal complexes (c); and emission spectra of chlorin 3 and metallochlorin 3Zn (d). The spectral lines of macrocycles 1, 3, 1Fe and 3Fe are represented as dashed lines for an easier interpretation. 
The emission spectrum of porphyrin 1 in methanol (ϕF = 0.051, 25 °C) shows a Qx(0,0) band at 642 nm and a Qx(0,1) band at 708 nm, both corresponding to the S1 → S0 transition (Fig. 3b). For the paramagnetic metalloporphyrins (1Fe and 1Cu, with ϕF = 0.010 and ϕF = 0.008, correspondingly), a very low intensity emission spectrum was observed (as expected for paramagnetic metal ions), while the spectrum of 1Zn (ϕF = 0.033) shows the same two bands observed in porphyrin 1, but with a 40 nm hypsochromic shift.
The emission spectrum of chlorin 3 in methanol (ϕF = 0.157, 25 °C) shows a highly intense band at 648 nm corresponding to Qy(0,0) and a lower intensity band at 714 nm corresponding to Qy(0,1). As expected, the paramagnetic metallochlorins in methanol (3Fe and 3Cu, with ϕF = 0.007 and ϕF = 0.008, correspondingly) exhibit a very low intensity emission spectrum. As observed for 1Zn, the emission spectrum of 3Zn (ϕF = 0.079, 25 °C) shows a 40 nm hypsochromic shift of the two bands observed in chlorin 3 (Fig. 3d).


C. Characterization of the macrocyclic ligand coordination sites by EPR spectroscopy. 
In order to access information about the coordination sites of the new ligands (1 and 3) we performed EPR studies on Cu(II) (1Cu and 3Cu) and Zn(II) (1Zn and 3Zn) complexes.
The EPR spectra of complexes 1Cu and 3Cu obtained in DMSO/toluene (1:1) at 100 K are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  X-band EPR spectra of porphyrin 1Cu (red line) and chlorin 3Cu (black line) obtained in a DMSO/toluene (1:1) frozen matrix. 
The signals are characteristic of copper metalloporphyrins, presenting a one electron (S = 1/2) Cu(II) system, and clearly exhibit lines due to the hyperfine interaction of the unpaired electron with the copper nucleus (I = 3/2) and superhyperfine interaction with the four nitrogen atoms (I = 1) of the macrocycle.49 Computer simulation of the experimental spectra and the Spin-Hamiltonian parameters are presented in the ESI,† in Fig. S46 and S47, and Table S3, respectively.
Complex 3Cu presents a rhombic spectrum (gx ≠ gy), a fact that we interpret as due to the loss of planarity occurring upon introduction of the pyrrolidinic ring.
In order to characterize a possible coordination site associated with the carboxylic acid in the periphery of the macrocycle, we recorded the EPR spectra of the zinc(II) complexes (1Zn and 3Zn) upon addition of copper(II) (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  X-band EPR spectra of porphyrin 1Zn (red line) and chlorin 3Zn (black line) obtained in a DMSO/toluene (1:1) frozen matrix, after addition of a solution of copper(II) ten times more concentrated. 
The signals are very similar and clearly different from those shown in Fig. 4. These spectra are similar to others obtained for copper(II) complexes coordinated to O-donor ligands49,50 and their Spin-Hamiltonian parameters are presented in Table S3 in the ESI.† A titration of porphyrin 1 with excess copper was also performed. The results indicate a clear preference for copper coordination to the N4 coordination sphere of the porphyrin. Further modification of the signal was only observed after the addition of copper(II) in a 1:10 molar ratio, where the coordination to the O coordination sphere can be detected (Fig. S48 in the ESI†). Computer simulation confirmed that the experimental spectrum is the superposition of the two signals previously identified in Fig. 4 and 5 (see the ESI,† Fig. S49 and Table S3). These observations confirm the accessibility of metal ions to the carboxylate function of the new macrocycles thus suggesting the possibility of further reactions using this group.

Conclusions
The present study describes the synthesis of 5-(4′-carbomethoxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 1a and its behavior as a dipolarophile in 1,3-DC reactions using two distinct routes. The results obtained with N-methyl nitrone (route A) allowed us to conclude that extended reaction times (48 h) are required to give four isomeric chlorins 2a–d, with demanding purification. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the isolated methyl ester of isoxazolidine-fused chlorins 2a and b exhibited limited thermal stability under acidic hydrolysis conditions, since retrocycloaddition was observed. In contrast, the 1,3-DC with an azomethine ylide (route B) was shown to be more advantageous, allowing shortened reaction times (9 h) for the selective synthesis of the methyl ester of chlorin 3a (minor amounts of chlorin 3b and isobacteriochlorins were also obtained), which was efficiently hydrolyzed under thermal acidic conditions. For metallation of the different compounds a microwave-mediated protocol was developed, which allowed the synthesis of the Fe(III), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of carboxyphenyl substituted porphyrin 1 and chlorin 3. With this method it was possible to achieve reaction times as low as 1 minute (for the zinc complexes), with isolated yields between 50% and quantitative, while avoiding the use of traditional harmful or corrosive solvents. The photophysical behavior of the different porphyrins was evaluated, including the absorption and emission wavelengths, quantum yields and absorption extinction coefficient of 1, 3 and the respective metal complexes. Here, chlorin 3 stands out as a good candidate for use as a PS in PDT, exhibiting absorption properties (λmax = 647 nm and ε ≈ 35000) that are comparable to some of the clinically used PSs such as Photofrin® (λmax = 630 nm and ε ≈ 3000),51 and Foscan® (λmax = 652 nm and ε ≈ 30000).52,53 EPR spectroscopy revealed the availability of the carboxylate function for metal ion coordination, even though binding to the N4 coordination sphere was found to be preferred. The accessibility of the carboxylate suggests that these molecules are good candidates for further functionalization. Altogether, these results are currently prompting us to continue to explore this family of porphyrins and chlorins, and in the future, to study the coordination to other metals.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
A selected single crystal of porphyrin 1 was mounted on a cryoloop using an adequate oil.54 The diffraction data were collected on a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) area-detector diffractometer controlled using the APEX2 software package:55 Mo Kα graphite-monochromated radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å; crystal positioned at 40 mm from the detector and using 100 s of exposure time per image. The acquisition was performed at 150 K using a cryostream controlled remotely using the interface Cryopad software.56 Image sets were processed with SAINT+,57 and the multi-scan method implemented in SADABS58 was used to correct of absorption effects. The structure was solved using the algorithm implemented in SHELXT-2014,59,60 and all the non-H-atoms were refined using anisotropic displacement parameters by successive full-matrix least-squares cycles on F2 using the latest SHELXL-v.2014.59,61
H-atoms bonded to carbon were placed at their idealized positions using appropriate HFIX instructions in SHELXL: 43 for the aromatic carbons, 23 for the CH2 and 137 for the CH groups. All these atoms were included in subsequent refinement cycles in riding-motion approximation with isotropic thermal displacements parameters (Uiso) fixed at 1.2 or 1.5 × Ueq of the relative atom. Significant electron density was found on the data of the crystal structure, possibly due to additional disordered solvent molecules occupying the spaces created by the packing arrangement of the complexes. Efforts to accurately locate, model and refine these residues were ineffective, and the investigation for the total potential solvent area using PLATON62,63 confirmed the existence of cavities with potential solvent accessible void volume. Therefore, the original data sets were treated with SQUEEZE,64 which calculates the contribution of the smeared electron density in the lattice voids and adds this to the calculated structure factors from the structural model when refining against the hkl file.
Unit cell parameters, structure solution and refinement details for the crystal structure of porphyrin 1 are summarized in the ESI,† Table S2. Further crystallographic details can be found in the CIF file provided in the ESI.† Crystallographic data for this structure have been deposited to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) as supplementary publication no. CCDC 1588230.
EPR studies
EPR spectra were recorded using an X-band (9 GHz) Bruker ELEXSYS E 500 spectrometer equipped with a variable temperature unit (ER 4B1 VT), available at Laboratório de Ressonância Paramagnética Electrónica (Centro de Materiais da Universidade do Porto) and obtained under the following general experimental conditions: a microwave frequency of 100 kHz, a microwave power of 20 mW, a modulation amplitude of 8 G, a gain of 60 dB, and an acquisition time of 300 s, at 100 ± 1 K. The samples were prepared by dissolution of the compound in a mixture of dried DMSO/toluene in a 1:1 ratio, placed in a capillary that was placed in a quartz tube and frozen. Regarding the samples for the titration with copper(II), different solutions were prepared by mixing the right amounts of porphyrin or chlorin and copper(II) solution in the ratios 1:1, 1:2; 1:4; 1:8 and 1:10. The copper(II) solution was prepared by dissolution of its acetate salt in DMSO. A concentration range of 2 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−2 M of Cu(II) salt was used. The spin Hamiltonian parameters were determined by simulation of the experimental spectra using the computer program Bruker WinEPR/SimFonia.
