    , Accepted 16th July 2017First published on 18th July 2017AbstractThe environmental instability of perovskite solar cells caused by the ultraviolet photocatalytic effect of metal oxide layers is a critical issue that must be solved. In this paper, we report improved environmental stability of ZnO film-based planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, by suppressing photocatalytic activities induced by the ZnO electron transfer layer. The photovoltaic performance and stability in an ambient environment under continuous illumination are effectively improved by applying an aluminum oxide interlayer on the ZnO film to suppress the photocatalytic degradation of perovskites. The highest efficiency of solar cells has increased from 14.62% to 17.17%, and after 250 h of continuous exposure under full spectrum simulated sunlight in air, the efficiency remains as high as 15.03%. The results suggest that effective suppression of photocatalytic degradation of perovskites with a modified electron transfer layer is a new solution to improve the long-term environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organometal trihalide perovskite materials have attracted great attention over the past few years because of their outstanding photovoltaic properties. In 2009, Kojima et al. developed the first perovskite solar cell (PSC), while they only gained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.1 Following their research, a series of methods, such as the sequential deposition method,2–6 one-step method,7–9 solvent engineering,10,11 anti-solvent method,11–13 vapor deposition, etc., have been developed to improve the quality of perovskite films, leading to a drastic increase of PCEs.14,15 In addition to the improved fabrication methods, new perovskite compounds such as FA1−xMAxPb(I1−yBry)3,4,16–19 FAPbIx,20,21 CsPbX3, etc.,22–24 where FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium, and X = Cl, Br, and I, were used to replace the original MAPbI3, and the PCEs of PSCs were further improved. Until now, the highest PCE of PSCs based on TiO2 has surged to remarkably 21.1%.25
Taking advantage of the high electron mobility (205–300 cm2 V−1 s−1 for bulk ZnO),26,27 ZnO appears to be a competitive alternative to TiO2 (0.1–4 cm2 V−1 s−1) as the electron transport material (ETM) for PSCs.28 In addition, ZnO with various microstructures can be produced using many simple methods at low temperature.29,30 The first ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells reported in 2013 showed a PCE of 5% owing to the limitation of using a traditional DSSC structure.31 By replacing the surface sensitization structure with a heterojunction structure, Son et al. fabricated a ZnO nanorod-based bulk heterojunction PSC with a PCE of 11.13%.32 Planar heterojunction PSCs with low-temperature processed thin ZnO nanoparticle films prepared by Liu et al. showed a PCE of 15.7%.30 Furthermore, Mahmood et al. increased the PCE of PSCs to 16.1% by using polyethyleneimine- (PEI) modified nitrogen-doped ZnO nanorods as the ETM.33 Our previous study also showed a record high efficiency of PSCs based on ZnO nanorods exceeding 17% by passivation of the ZnO ETM by the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3.34,35 Recently, Tseng et al. reported the first Al-doped ZnO- (AZO) based planar heterojunction PSC with the highest PCE of 17.6%.36
The rapid development of ZnO-based PSCs shows the great potential of ZnO as an ETM, but the efficiency and stability of ZnO-based PSCs are still inferior to those of TiO2-based PSCs. The low PCE of ZnO-based PSCs is mainly attributed to the serious charge recombination at the interface between the ZnO nanostructure and the perovskite.37 Surface passivation is an efficient method to solve this problem.33,34,37 On the other hand, the poor long-term stability also severely limits the performance of ZnO-based PSCs. This instability includes two aspects: thermal decomposition and ultraviolet (UV) degradation. The thermal decomposition process has been extensively studied, and many methods have been used to overcome this problem.38–40 However, compared with the widely studied thermal decomposition, the studies on UV degradation are still insufficient. UV degradation is a common problem for both ZnO and TiO2-based PSCs. In 2013, Leijtens et al. reported the UV degradation phenomenon in TiO2-based PSCs.41 They found that photocatalysis of TiO2 rapidly degrades the performance of PSCs after long-time illumination. By replacing the UV sensitive TiO2 with Al2O3, PSCs with high stability were obtained. The UV degradation was also restrained by using defective TiO2 and CsBr surface modification.42,43 The UV degradation of ZnO-based PSCs is more severe than that of TiO2-based PSCs because of the stronger UV catalytic activity of ZnO. Surface hydroxyl groups and chemical residues left over on the solution-processed ZnO surface cause a photochemical reaction and accelerate the decomposition of perovskite.44,45 Hence, there is an urgent need to enhance the UV resistance of ZnO-based PSCs.
In this paper, we report the first direct evidence (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, FTIR) for effective suppression of the photocatalytic decomposition of MAPbI3 in efficient planar PSCs based on an undoped ZnO film. Using a ZnO ETM modified by an ultrathin AlOx interlayer (marked as Al–ZnO), the solar cell efficiency has been improved from 14.62% of a control device using the bare ZnO (marked as RF–ZnO) to a high PCE of 17.17%. In addition, the ultrathin AlOx interlayer effectively inhibits ZnO-assisted photocatalytic reactions in PSCs. After 250 h of full spectrum solar illumination in ambient air, the PCE slightly decreased to 15.03%, representing the long lifetime of ZnO-based PSCs. The FTIR spectroscopy and dark current results obtained from different aging stages confirmed that the AlOx interlayer not only passivates the ZnO surface, but also improves the environmental stability by suppressing the ZnO-assisted photocatalysis of perovskites.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
PbI2, CH3NH3I and the all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used as received.
2.2 Device preparation
Patterned FTO glasses were cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, ethanol and DI water in an ultrasonic bath before use.
A compact 20 nm ZnO film was deposited on FTO by RF sputtering with a ZnO target. To prepare the ZnO film with an AlOx interlayer (Al–ZnO), a 1–2 nm Al film was deposited on the compact ZnO by an E-beam evaporation system, and due to the low reduction potential of Al and the ultrathin layer thickness, the Al film was oxidized and formed an ultrathin AlOx interlayer on the ZnO surface once the film was exposed to air. A solution containing ZnO nanoparticles was also employed to prepare ZnO film (S–ZnO) by a spin-coating process.30
The samples were then transferred to a N2-filled glove box to deposit perovskite films (MAPbI3) using the single-step method.47 A precursor solution was prepared by using 78 mg of DMSO and 600 mg of DMF to completely dissolve 461 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of CH3NH3I (MAI). The prepared solution was spin-coated on the ZnO surface at 4000 rpm for 25 s, and 0.5 mL of chlorobenzene was added dropwise on the film surface in 15 s before the end of the spin-coating process. The sample was then annealed at 65 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 2 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the hole-transport material (spiro-OMeTAD solution with the addition of TBP, Li-TFSI and a Co salt) was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 surface.2 Finally, a 60 nm Au metal electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area for all solar cells was 0.09 cm2.
To examine the defect concentration in perovskite films, electron-only devices were fabricated. The electron-only devices consisted of FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag. To fabricate the electron-only devices, after the perovskite layer was prepared, a 20 nm [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 surface, and the precursor solution was made by dissolving 20 mg of PCBM in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. A 50 nm Ag film was deposited as an electrode by thermal evaporation.
2.3 Measurement and characterization
Current–voltage characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2400 under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar 3A Class AAA, 64023A). The AM 1.5G sunlight was calibrated using a standard Si-solar cell (Oriel, VLSI standards).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed employing a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, made by PV Measurements, USA) with a dual-grating monochromator with computer control.
The XRD tests were carried out using a Bede D1 system with Cu Kα radiation. The surface and cross-sectional morphology were obtained from the field emission fitting SEM (FEI-Inspect F50, Holland). The UV-vis absorption spectrum was measured using an UV-vis spectrophotometer (Schimadzu UV-3101 PC). The FTIR spectrum was obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific). The XPS spectra were measured using the Kratos XSAM 800 X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer.
Photoluminescence (PL) was measured with an F-4600 FL fluorescence spectrophotometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the samples were measured using a Fluorolog-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For PL and TRPL tests, samples with structures of FTO/ZnO(RF sputtering)/Al/perovskite (for Al–ZnO), FTO/ZnO(RF sputtering)/perovskite (for RF–ZnO) and FTO/ZnO(solution process)/perovskite (for S–ZnO) were prepared.
To examine the UV degradation process, the PSCs without encapsulation were illuminated by AM 1.5G sunlight from a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar 3A Class AAA, 64023A) under room temperature in air (25 °C, 30% RH). Air flow was used to maintain the temperature of the devices. The exposure time was 250 h.
To study the photocatalytic activity, 5 mg L−1 of aqueous methylene blue (MB) solution was used in the presence of different ZnO films under the UV illumination at room temperature. A 4 cm2 ZnO film was immersed in 10 mL of MB solution. Before irradiation, the solution was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium. In the degradation process, the solutions were irradiated from the top with a UV light (360 nm, 25 W) and stirred during the whole process. The concentration of MB solution was determined by the UV-vis spectrometer every 20 min.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the diagram of PSCs after AlOx interlayer modification, and the energy level diagram of FTO/ZnO(Al)MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD is shown in the inset.45–47 As shown in Fig. S1,† the AlOx interlayer hardly affects the optical transmittance. To study the degradation of PSCs caused by UV light, we exposed a number of PSCs to full spectrum AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). As a control sample, a PSC based on a sol–gel ZnO film is also prepared (marked as S–ZnO).

(b) J–V curves of the best-performing solar cells with/without AlOx interlayer modification before UV aging. (c) The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best-performing PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO before UV aging. (d) The evolution of solar cell parameters during the UV aging process. 

Fig. 1(b) exhibits the J–V curves of the best-performing PSCs based on RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO before UV illumination and the J–V curve of the PSC based on S–ZnO is shown in Fig. S2(a).† The device based on S–ZnO shows the lowest PCE of 9.2%, with FF = 60%, VOC = 1.06 V, and JSC = 14.4 mA cm−2. By using the RF–ZnO film as the ETM, the PCE of the device increases to 14.62%, with an FF of 68.25%, a VOC of 1.05 V and a JSC of 20.4 mA cm−2. The use of an AlOx interlayer further increases the PCE to 17.17%, with an FF of 75.9%, a VOC of 1.053 V and a JSC of 21.55 mA cm−2.

Fig. 1(c) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performing PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO. Both curves show a strong light response in the range from 350 nm to 700 nm. For the PSC based on RF–ZnO, the spectrum intensity decreases slightly in the range from 500 nm to 700 nm. As for S–ZnO, the EQE spectrum is shown in Fig. S2(b).† Compared with the spectra of PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO, the whole spectrum intensity of the PSC based on S–ZnO decreased significantly. The differences between the EQE spectra of Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO mainly come from the different properties of MAPbI3 films and the interface between the ZnO surface and the perovskite film, which will be explained in detail later. In addition, the JSC of the PSC based on Al–ZnO calculated from the EQE data is 21 mA cm−2, and for the PSCs based on Al–ZnO and S–ZnO, the calculated JSC are 20.1 mA cm−2 and 14.4 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the measured results from the J–V test.
In addition, the J–V curves of the best-performing PSC based on Al–ZnO measured by forward and reverse scans are shown in Fig. S3.† As can be seen from the figure, a PCE of 16.93% was obtained from the forward scan and a PCE of 17.17% was obtained from the reverse scan, which shows a small hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans. This can be attributed to the effective improvement of the crystallinity and grain size of MAPbI3 films and the modified interface between MAPbI3 and ZnO. Fig. S4† shows a steady-state photocurrent output of the best-performing PSC based on Al–ZnO. The stable current density measured at the maximum power point at 0.82 V is 20.8 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured result. And the stable PCE corresponding to this current density is 17.05%, which represents the actual power output and efficiency.

Fig. 1(d) shows the performance deterioration of planar PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO over 250 h of continuous illumination under the full spectrum solar simulator in air (30% relative humidity (RH), 25 °C). The PSCs based on Al–ZnO films showed improved stability under UV exposure, and the PCE had a minor decrease from 17.17% to 15.03% after the aging test. Other photovoltaic parameters, especially the JSC, degraded slightly. However, the performance of PSCs based on RF–ZnO degraded drastically. The PCE decreased from 14.62% to 7.07% after 250 h of illumination. As shown in Fig. S5,† the solar cells based on S–ZnO show even poorer stability. A complete device failure is observed in the first few hours of the aging test. The detailed photovoltaic data of these solar cells are shown in Table S1.† According to the results, the PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO showed much better initial performance and stability than PSCs with S–ZnO. The poor performance of the S–ZnO device mainly came from the high defect density of the ZnO film because of the incomplete conversion of Zn precursors to ZnO during the solution process.44 The poor stability should be attributed to the much stronger photocatalytic activity of S–ZnO. Thus, by replacing the solution process by RF sputtering, the ZnO material properties were improved. With AlOx interlayer modification, the surface recombination of RF–ZnO was further suppressed. Therefore, the RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO devices showed better performance than the S–ZnO device.
To further investigate the degradation mechanism of PSCs based on different ZnO materials, we carried out an UV aging test. The UV aging test was carried out by illuminating the unencapsulated PSCs with sunlight from a solar simulator (contains about 4.6 mW cm−2 of UV light less than 400 nm in the spectrum) under room temperature in air (25 °C, 30% RH).43 The exposure time was 250 h and cool air flow was used to maintain the temperature of the samples. In addition, according to previous reports, the visible light (>400 nm) cannot fully stimulate the photocatalysis of ZnO under common conditions. Furthermore, according to the research studies of Leijtens et al. and Li et al., the MAPbI3 itself can remain stable under visible light.41,43 As a result, no filter was used during the aging process. FTIR analysis was used to monitor the evolution of MAPbI3 during the UV aging processes. As per the results reported by Antonio Abate et al., the commonly considered unstable spiro-OMeTAD can maintain stability once the oxidation reaction is complete.49 Thus, the degradation of the PSC performance is mainly attributed to the UV light induced photochemical reaction at the interface between ZnO and MAPbI3.
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the FTIR spectra suggest the improved UV stability of the MAPbI3 film on Al–ZnO. All the samples obviously show the N–H stretching and C–H stretching vibrations at around 3250 cm−1 and 2987 cm−1, respectively, which can be attributed to the CH3NH3+ radical in the MAPbI3 film. The C–N stretch and C–H bend, which correspond to the MA cations in the MAPbI3 film, are also observed. The light illumination causes marginal changes in the FTIR spectra of the MAPbI3 film on Al–ZnO. However, all the vibration modes in the MAPbI3 film on RF–ZnO decrease evidently. For both Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO, there are no new peaks. As for S–ZnO, apart from the obvious decrease of the spectral intensity, we also observed the appearance of strong O–H stretching vibrations. The presence of hydroxyl groups means that the MAPbI3 has significantly decomposed. The hydroxyl group on the surface of ZnO is another reason for the decomposition of perovskites caused by the UV photocatalysis.44 Hence, FTIR was used to determine the hydroxyl group residue on the Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO surfaces too. The FTIR spectra of the Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO films are shown in Fig. 2(b). As can be seen, an evident broad peak between 3250 cm−1 and 3750 cm−1 can be observed in the S–ZnO spectrum, while for the Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO films, no evident peaks can be distinguished at the same position. This result indicates that there are fewer hydroxyl group residues on the RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO surfaces. The hydroxyl group residues mainly originated from the chemical solution fabrication process of S–ZnO, which reacted with perovskite and enhanced the UV decomposition process. Fig. 2(c) and (d) exhibit the decomposition process of perovskite on different ZnO films. When the ZnO film without modification was used as the ETM, due to the UV catalysis and reactive surface of the ZnO film, the perovskite film can be decomposed in air under UV illumination. But once the ZnO surface was covered by the AlOx interlayer, as shown in Fig. 2(d), the decomposition can be efficiently suppressed.

Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the MAPbI3 film are used to exhibit the details of the change of the optical properties during this process. Fig. 3(a) shows that the UV-vis absorption of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO decreases only slightly in the range of 500–750 nm during the UV aging test. The optical band gap of perovskite remains steady at about 760 nm. The missing absorption peak of PbI2 demonstrates the high UV stability of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO.50 The UV stability of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO is further confirmed by the photographs in Fig. 3(a) in which the color of MAPbI3 is still dark brown after the aging test. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the absorption features of MAPbI3 on RF–ZnO in the range of 500–750 nm decrease rapidly. The optical band gap of perovskite is not steady at 760 nm owing to perovskite decomposition in the UV aging process. At the same time, the background absorption of the perovskite film increases over time during the aging test, which is because of the large crystals formed by the decomposition of MAPbI3.51
 Fig. 3  (a) and (b) show the UV absorption spectra of Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO. The insets are the photos of the perovskite film aging over time. (c) and (d) XPS patterns of Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO. (e) and (f) O1s peak of Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO. 
In addition, the color of the MAPbI3 film changes from dark brown to pale yellow gradually because of the decomposition of MAPbI3 induced by UV photocatalysis as shown in the insets of Fig. 3(b). As shown in Fig. S6,† the MAPbI3 film on S–ZnO turns yellow in a short time owing to its much faster degradation. The dark brown color of the MAPbI3 film on Al–ZnO is stable under UV illumination. The result suggests that the environmental stability of MAPbI3 films on Al–ZnO is drastically improved because of the suppressed UV photocatalysis.
To further unravel the role of the AlOx interlayer, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out on RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO films. As can be seen from the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 3(c), only two peaks located at the binding energies of 1021.88 eV and 1044.98 eV are observed, corresponding to the Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2, respectively, related to the Zn ion in the wurtzite ZnO. The XPS spectra of the Al2p peaks of Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO are shown in Fig. 3(d). There is no Al2p peak in the XPS spectrum of RF–ZnO. As for Al–ZnO, a weak, but distinct peak for Al2p located at a binding energy of 74.68 eV corresponding to AlOx is detected, which reveals the existence of alumina oxide. The results indicate that the deposited Al reacts with O2− on the surface of ZnO and ambient O2 to form an ultrathin AlOx layer on the ZnO surface, which is consistent with our assumptions.45 AlOx usually has a much larger bandgap (about 8–9 eV) than ZnO (3.37 eV). Therefore, the UV light in the solar spectrum is unable to activate the photocatalysis of AlOx. Additionally, the AlOx passivation inhibits ZnO surface trap states and decreases the oxygen vacancy concentration. As illustrated in Fig. 3(e), the O1s peak in Al–ZnO can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.46 eV, 530.87 eV and 532.25 eV, respectively. The higher binding energy (532.25 eV) is related to the oxygen vacancy and chemisorbed oxygen on the surface. Another peak that appeared at 530.46 eV is associated with O atoms in the ZnO lattice. The peak at 530.87 eV corresponding to the O atoms bonded with Al. The integrated peak intensity ratio of Al–ZnO is 1.56 (S530.46/S532.25). As shown in Fig. 3(f), the O1s in RF–ZnO can be deconvoluted into two peaks, corresponding to the oxygen vacancy and chemisorbed oxygen at 532.06 eV and O atoms in the ZnO lattice at 530.52 eV. The integrated peak intensity ratio of these two peaks is 1.01 (S530.52/S532.06). The higher ratio in Al–ZnO reveals that AlOx interlayer modification can efficiently reduce the amount of oxygen vacancies and chemisorbed oxygen. The AlOx interlayer is thus favorable for suppressing the UV instability of perovskite on the ZnO surface in the atmosphere.36
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the rapid decomposition of MAPbI3 on S–ZnO and RF–ZnO is mainly attributed to the photocatalysis of the ZnO surface. The simulated sunlight used in the study contains about 3% UV light with a wavelength less than 400 nm, which excites the photocatalytic activity of ZnO.27,52 Under the illumination, electrons transit from the valence band to the conduction band to generate free electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate on the surface of ZnO and react with H2O and O2 adsorbed at the ZnO surface or in the ambient air, leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and O2−.53,54 Both groups show strong oxidizability and oxidize the MAPbI3 materials on the ZnO surface.

(e) Photocatalytic degradation rates of methylene blue by Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO under UV irradiation. 
As the reaction continues, besides that from the reaction, H2O in the air further aggravates the decomposition of MAPbI3 and destroys the MAPbI3 crystal structure. H2O is extremely unfavorable for the stability of MAPbI3 due to the following reaction:554CH3NH3PbI3 + 2H2O → (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2
In addition, when MAPbI3 comes into contact with ZnO, a deprotonation reaction takes place. The possible mechanism for this process is shown as follows:44CH3NH3PbI3 → PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI
On the other hand, there are many oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZnO and the oxygen vacancies interact with O2 and H2O in air. In particular, a higher oxygen vacancy concentration is on the surface of S–ZnO due to the incomplete oxidation. In addition, chemicals and solvents that remain on the surface of ZnO films are unavoidable for solution processes. As it is confirmed by the FTIR spectra in Fig. 2(b), the oxygen vacancies and chemical residues lead to a much higher concentration of surface hydroxyls. For S–ZnO, a broad peak is clearly shown at around 3500 cm−1, corresponding to the O–H stretching vibrations, i.e. the hydroxyl group. The improved quality of RF–ZnO causes the absence of the broad peak ascribed to the O–H stretches. The high concentration of hydroxyls on the surface of ZnO enhances the UV activity of the ZnO surface.44,45
In order to intuitively verify the inference, the photocatalytic properties of Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO are evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV irradiation. The concentration evolution of MB solution during UV degradation can be monitored by measuring its characteristic absorption at 665 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the absorption of MB solution on Al–ZnO has no significant change during 1 h of UV exposure. Meanwhile, the absorption intensities of MB solution on RF–ZnO and S–ZnO decline rapidly under UV illumination, as exhibited in Fig. 4(c) and (d). MB itself is stable on its own and cannot be degraded by UV light. As a result, the absorption evolution, which is directly related to the concentration change, is mainly caused by the UV degradation introduced by ZnO. In addition, the degradation speed of MB on different ZnO films is shown in Fig. 4(e), where C0 and C correspond to the initial concentration of MB and concentration of MB at different times, respectively. The decomposition rate of MB on S–ZnO is the fastest while the Al–ZnO shows the slowest decomposition rate. The stable characteristic absorption and slow degradation speed of MB show that the catalytic activity of the Al–ZnO is much lower than that of RF–ZnO and S–ZnO, which means that AlOx modification is effective to inhibit the photodegradation and suppress the UV photocatalysis.
To gain further insight into the device degradation, the evolution of fundamental diode parameters of the Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO devices is analyzed during the UV aging process. The PSC is a non-ideal diode in darkness. The Shockley diode equation explains the basic parameters of this diode as follows:56 (1)where J is the current density of a diode, J0 is the reverse saturated current density, JP is the photocurrent density, q is the electron charge, V is the applied bias, RS is the series resistance, RSH is the shunt resistance, A is the area of the device, n is the ideality factor of the junction, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the Kelvin temperature. Considering the negligible RS and huge RSH in darkness, we derive an approximate relation of J, J0, and n from eqn (1), and the equation is expressed as follows: (2)
The natural logarithm plots of J versus V of RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO devices under dark conditions are shown, respectively, in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The dark current of the RF–ZnO PSC increases obviously over time and the dark current of Al–ZnO remains roughly stable and lower than that of the RF–ZnO device at the same time. The J0 and n are estimated from the dark current curves by exponential fitting according to eqn (2) (the temperature used here is 298 K).18 The results are shown in Fig. S7.† As exhibited in the figure, prior to the aging test, the ideal factor n and reverse saturated current density J0 of the Al–ZnO device is 1.71 and 2.01 × 10−11 mA cm−2, and for RF–ZnO, the two factors are 1.84 and 1.2 × 10−10 mA cm−2, respectively. Usually, for a high-performance heterojunction solar cell, the ideal factor is generally within the range of 1.3–2.56 A bigger ideal factor means more non-radiative recombination (e.g. Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination via defects).18 The reverse saturated current density J0 relates to the recombination at the interface of MAPbI3/ZnO. The AlOx interlayer passivation of ZnO reduces the ideal factor of PSCs within the range of 1.3–2 and decreases the reverse saturated current density, indicating that the recombination is efficiently suppressed. As the aging process continues, the n and J0 of both types of devices increase with time. At the end of the aging test, the n and J0 of the Al–ZnO device just slightly increase to 1.98 and 6.29 × 10−10 mA cm−2, respectively. This reveals that the basic diode properties are almost unaffected, and the decomposition of MAPbI3 is suppressed because of the AlOx interlayer modification. Meanwhile, the n and J0 of the PSCs based on RF–ZnO increase to 2.1 and 1.75 × 10−9 mA cm−2, respectively, after UV exposure. The result confirms that recombination in the RF–ZnO device increases, and MAPbI3 on RF–ZnO continues to decompose under UV illumination.57,58

The introduction of the AlOx interlayer not only improves the long-term stability, but also improves the perovskite film quality. Fig. 5(c) and (d) show the surface morphology of MAPbI3 on RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO, respectively. The average grain size of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO is 384 nm, which is much larger than the average grain size of MAPbI3 on the RF–ZnO surface (310 nm). The grain size of MAPbI3 on RF–ZnO obviously shows wider distribution as well. The cross-section of FTO/Al–ZnO/perovskite shown in Fig. 5(g) reveals that Al–ZnO is fully covered by a compact and well crystallized MAPbI3 film. Fig. S8† shows that the grain size of MAPbI3 on S–ZnO decreases to 200 nm, and the S–ZnO is not fully covered by the perovskite film. As per the previous report, the coverage evolution is mainly driven by the change of surface energy, and a higher surface energy leads to lower coverage.59 The S–ZnO shows much higher surface energy than RF–ZnO and Al–ZnO, because it is composed of the ZnO nanoparticles.60 The poor coverage decreases the light absorption and results in shunt paths in the perovskite film, which causes a drop in the photovoltaic performance.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO are shown in Fig. 5(e). The absence of PbI2 peaks of both samples means full conversion of MAPbI3 precursors. The XRD result of MAPbI3 on Al–ZnO shows peaks corresponding to the (100), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), and (314) planes, respectively. As for MAPbI3 on RF–ZnO, the XRD spectra show similar diffraction patterns except for the slightly decreased peak intensity and wider peak width ascribed to the decrease of the grain size, which coincides with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) result. The large grain size can decrease grain boundaries in MAPbI3 films, resulting in the improvement of carrier transport and carrier extraction efficiency. The large perovskite grain is also favorable for the decrease of the series resistance and the increase of the FF. In addition, the large perovskite grains enhance light scattering and absorption, leading to the increase of JSC.3
To further investigate the effects of the AlOx interlayer on ZnO, we measured the I–V curves of unipolar devices with only electron charge carriers (FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag), as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(f). The semilog plot of the I–V curves indicates that the current increases linearly with voltage at the low-bias voltage region. At the higher bias voltage region, the current increases at a much higher slope. The transition point is the ohmic to trapfilled limit transition point (VTFL) and related to the trap density (nt) linearly. The value of the VTFL increases as electrons are trapped. The trap-state is given by the following formula (3):61 (3)where L is the thickness of MAPbI3, ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3 (28.8) and the vacuum permittivity, respectively.62,63 With the similar thickness of MAPbI3, the nt is proportional to the VTFL. As indicated by the I–V curves, the VTFLs of the device based on Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO are 0.24 V, 0.65 V and 0.7 V, respectively (Fig. S9†). The results suggest that the trap density in the MAPbI3 film on Al–ZnO is drastically suppressed, and thus the performance of PSCs is improved. This result was further proved by the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra shown in Fig. S10.† Fig. S10(a)† shows the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite on Al–ZnO, RF–ZnO and S–ZnO. The characteristic PL peak of perovskite can be observed at around 775 nm. The perovskite film on S–ZnO shows the highest PL intensity and the perovskite film on Al–ZnO shows the weakest. According to a previous report, the electron extraction time in perovskite has been measured to be 0.4 ns.64 However, the radiative recombination in perovskite occurs in tens to hundreds of nanoseconds time scale,65 as a result, the PL intensity is largely determined by the carrier extraction. Hence, the weakest PL intensity of perovskite on Al–ZnO indicated that the electron extraction efficiency and quality of the perovskite film on Al–ZnO were higher than the perovskite films on RF–ZnO and S–ZnO. The TRPL spectra shown in Fig. S10(b)† also prove this result. Compared with the S–ZnO and RF–ZnO samples, the Al–ZnO sample shows the shortest emission decay time, which indicates a good carrier extraction behavior of the perovskite/Al–ZnO interface and the high quality of the perovskite film.
To further demonstrate the improved performance of PSCs based on Al–ZnO, we prepared two batches of planar PSCs based on Al–ZnO and RF–ZnO films. As shown in Fig. 6, the AlOx interlayer modification increases the average PCE from 12.94% to 16.74%, the average VOC from 1.017 V to 1.049 V, the average JSC from 19.27 mA cm−2 to 21.44 mA cm−2, and the average FF from 65.96% to 74.39%. Obviously, when Al–ZnO is used as the ETM, the solar cell performance is improved with high reproducibility. This result suggests that, after ZnO is modified by the AlOx interlayer, the surface defects are efficiently passivated and recombination is suppressed. At the same time, the defect concentration in the perovskite deposited on Al–ZnO is obviously decreased, and the carrier transport in the device is improved.

4. Conclusion
Planar PSCs based on the undoped ZnO ETM modified by an ultrathin AlOx interlayer yield a high efficiency of 17.17%. The PCE is only reduced to 15.03% after 250 h of continuous illumination in an ambient environment. The AlOx interlayer modification not only prevents ZnO-induced photocatalysis, but also enhances the performance of PSCs. The results obtained from FTIR, UV-vis absorption and diode parameter calculations demonstrate that the introduction of the AlOx interlayer on the surface of ZnO suppresses the defects and photocatalytic degradation, and hence improves the environmental instability of ZnO ETM-based PSCs. Since the defects and environmental instability of ZnO can be effectively inhibited by the AlOx interlayer, we provide a valid approach to overcome the barrier by using ZnO as the ETM for high-performance planar PSCs.
