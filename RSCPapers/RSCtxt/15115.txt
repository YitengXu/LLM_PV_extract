    , Accepted 9th January 2022First published on 10th January 2022AbstractA salicylaldehyde Schiff base hybrid lead iodide perovskite [SAPD]PbI3 (SAPD = 1-((2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)pyridin-1-ium) was found to show a robust nonlinear optical response and large spontaneous polarization. We expect this work to inspire researchers to investigate the optical control of ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskites.
Ferroelectric materials are a significant category of materials that display innate spontaneous polarization (Ps), and for which the polarization orientation can be reversibly flipped by an applied external electrical field.1 The first discovery of ferroelectricity was made a century ago for Rochelle salt,2 and then the flourishing development of ferroelectric materials benefited chiefly from investigations of perovskite oxides and organic polymers represented by barium titanate, lead zirconate titanate and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), with their ferroelectric characteristics leading to their technologically important applications in piezoelectric sensors, memory devices, solar cells, etc.3–8 In recent decades, molecular ferroelectrics with innate characteristics of being lightweight and structurally flexible have attracted great attention as alternatives to inorganic counterparts, and are experiencing a new renaissance.9–14
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as a promising class of solution-processable semiconductors and are highly desirable nowadays due to their application prospects in photovoltaics and optoelectronic devices.15–17 They not only retain the respective natures of the inorganic and organic components but also strikingly generate fantastic performance as a result of their synergy. Accordingly, the features of easy processing, viable chemical tailoring, structural flexibility, and versatility in hybrid perovskites offer a fairly wide array of possibilities for designing functional materials as desired.18 The past decade has witnessed a blossoming in the diversified development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. In particular, Pb-based ABX3 (A = monovalent organic cations, B = divalent metal ions, and X = halogen ions) perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 with a three-dimensional (3D) architecture has shown great potential in solar cell applications, and as a result of the use of state-of-the-art film and device fabrication technologies, has shown constantly improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).19,20 However, the study of ferroelectricity in 3D CH3NH3PbI3 is still incomplete. Beyond 3D hybrid perovskites with their relatively small number of examples, one-dimensional (1D) ABX3 hybrid perovskites demonstrate a higher degree of structural diversity and flexibility. Their organic parts serve as structural and chemical stabilizers and display relatively high tunability, a feature promoting the discovery of intriguing functionalities, especially desirable ferroelectric semiconducting behavior. By pursuing strategies involving low-dimensional perovskites, notable progress has been made in the many works on hybrid lead halide perovskite ferroelectrics. Xiong and co-authors have discovered numerous advanced perovskite ferroelectrics using important chemical design principles.21–27 Moreover, heterostructure engineering of multilayer perovskite ferroelectrics for promising opto-electronic applications has also been widely investigated.28–31 Of these materials, several 1D ABX3 lead halide perovskite ferroelectrics have been documented. For instance, enantiomers of the 1D lead iodide perovskite (R/S)-1-(cyclohexylethylammonium)PbI3 demonstrate a combination of chirality, semiconducting and switchable photoferroelectric properties.32 Using precise molecular modifications, a 1D lead iodide perovskite, [(CH3)3NCH2I]PbI3, showing room-temperature ferroelectricity, namely, has been successfully designed.33 Despite the excellent performances of organic–inorganic hybrid halides, few works have been reported on 1D lead iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors displaying large spontaneous polarizations; such semiconductors would be expected to be competitive candidates for use in future smart devices.
In this work, we report the first 1D salicylaldehyde Schiff base organic–inorganic hybrid lead iodide perovskite, which exhibits large spontaneous polarization. This perovskite, denoted as [SAPD]PbI3, specifically exhibits a spontaneous polarization of ca. 10 μC cm−2, a value higher than those of most lead iodide perovskite ferroelectrics. Besides this, [SAPD]PbI3 shows a strong nonlinear optical response, more than twice that of KDP. The ferroelectric [SAPD]PbI3 also exhibits a semiconductor bandgap of 2.31 eV. It is worth noting that under photoirradiation, organic salicylaldehyde Schiff bases in general tend to exhibit significant photochromism resulting from the photoexcited intramolecular proton transfer of the hydroxyl proton and enol–keto structural isomerization.34 With this purpose, we might achieve a class of unprecedented organic–inorganic hybrid photochromic lead halide perovskite ferroelectrics with such photo-triggered isomerization. Although no photochromism was observed in the current study, the successful synthesis of the first salicylaldehyde Schiff base lead iodide perovskite is expected to play an important role in promoting future investigations of the optical control of ferroelectric properties.35
The synthesis of [SAPD]PbI3 is described in detail in the supporting information (Fig. S1, ESI†). The corresponding synthetic procedure and 1H NMR results are described in detail in the ESI† (Fig. S1, ESI†). The purity of [SAPD]PbI3 was confirmed by comparing its measured powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern with a simulated PXRD pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†). The thermogravimetric analysis that was carried out showed that the [SAPD]PbI3 sample tested was stable up to 494 K (Fig. S3, ESI†). The single-crystal structure of [SAPD]PbI3 was determined at 298 K and 173 K. The [SAPD]PbI3 crystallizes in the monoclinic non-centrosymmetric space group Ia (point group m) in each case but with cell parameters of a = 7.8102(2) Å, b = 14.2865(4) Å, c = 16.1155(4) Å, β = 100.552(2)°, V = 1767.77(8) Å3 at 173 K and a = 7.8475(3) Å, b = 14.3845(6) Å, c = 16.1929(6) Å, β = 100.385(4)°, V = 1797.95(12) Å3 at 298 K. The crystal structure refinement data are given in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1, the unit cell of [SAPD]PbI3 at 298 K was observed to consist of one orderly arranged [SAPD]+ cation and 1D chainlike skeleton [PbI3]n− extending indefinitely along the a-axis (Fig. S4, ESI†), and constructed from face-sharing PbI6 octahedra, with each octahedron containing a Pb atom and six I atoms. Pb–I bond lengths between 3.1888(9) Å and 3.2530(8) Å were measured for the crystal obtained at 298 K, and the adjacent I–Pb–I bond angles were measured to vary from 83.97(2)° to 96.39(2)°, indicating high distortion of the PbI6 octahedron. The corresponding information about atom coordinates, bond lengths, and bond angles are provided in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). At 173 K, [SAPD]PbI3 displayed a structural model and parameters similar to those at 298 K (Table S4, ESI†). The PbI6 face-sharing octahedra were observed to be similar to those of the NiO6 moieties in BaNiO3, which shows a typically hexagonal perovskite stacking. Therefore, [SAPD]PbI3 can be classified as a 1D ABX3 hybrid lead iodide perovskite material. The structural features of [SAPD]PbI3 was found to also be comparable to those of other 1D lead iodide ABX3 perovskites such as [(CH3)3NCH2I]PbI3, (4-fluoropiperidinium)PbI3, (4-fluorohexahydroazepine)PbI3 and so on.33,36–38 In the SAPD cation, two non-planar six-membered rings were found to be formed by pyridine and benzene rings related by a dihedral angle of 45.6° (Fig. S5, ESI†) and stabilized by a strong intramolecular O–H⋯N hydrogen bond (Table S5, ESI†). In Fig. 1b, the channels along the a-axis formed by adjacent SAPD cations were occupied by chain skeletons. [SAPD]I crystallized in the centrosymmetric space group P21/c (point group 2/m) with the cell parameters a = 12.5159(2) Å, b = 7.52770(10) Å, c = 13.7218(2) Å, β = 106.358(2)°, V = 1240.48(3) Å3 at 298 K (Table S1, ESI†). Its asymmetric unit was observed to contain an SAPD cation and an iodine anion connected by a strong intermolecular O–H⋯I hydrogen bond (2.595 Å). The dihedral angle of [SAPD]I was measured to be 56.9° (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurement is the most straightforward path for detecting inversion center symmetry in a crystal. The SHG signal is only active when the crystals crystallize in the non-centrosymmetric point groups excluding the 432, 622, and 422.39 As shown in Fig. 2a, the detected SHG signal intensity of [SAPD]PbI3 was about twice that of KDP, a result further confirming the non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the structural analysis. The strong SHG response was greater than those of some traditional nonlinear optical materials such as inorganic Rb2Ba3(P2O7)2 (0.3× KDP) and KBBF (1.24× KDP).40,41 The SHG intensity of [SAPD]PbI3 offers a significant advantage in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This is because the SHG signal intensity of most hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics is far lower than that of KDP, such as the robust piezoelectricresponses of TMCMCdCl3, [(CH3)3NCH2I]PbI3, and several homochiral lead iodide perovskite ferroelectrics.23,27,32,33

To further investigate the ferroelectricity of [SAPD]PbI3, we used the double-wave method to take polarization–electric (P–E) field hysteresis loop measurements of its thin film at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 2b, it showed a standard P–E hysteresis loop, in which two opposite peaks indicated two stable states having opposite polarizations, directly proving the ferroelectricity. The experimental value of saturation polarization (Ps) was measured to be about 10 μC cm−2, a value comparable to the theoretically calculated value of 11.8 μC cm−2 based on the point charge model (Fig. S7, ESI†). The Ps of [SAPD]PbI3 was found to be much larger than those of many other organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics (Table S6, ESI†).
The ferroelectricity of the [SAPD]PbI3 thin film was confirmed from the results of domain mapping as well as local polarization manipulation using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM).14 The PFM images including the lateral and vertical phase and amplitude response of the thin film are shown in Fig. 3a–d, along with the topographic images acquired simultaneously (Fig. 3e and f). The PFM data clearly indicated a polydomain structure, one having no apparent crosstalk with the surface morphology of the thin film. The purple and yellow color tones in the lateral PFM phase image represent the domains with the different in-plane components of polarization. While in the vertical PFM phase image, the color distributions denote the domains with the different out-of-plane components of polarization. The observed domain pattern demonstrated the occurrence of spontaneous polarization in the [SAPD]PbI3 thin film.

To further test the ferroelectric characteristics of the [SAPD]PbI3 thin film, we carried out local polarization manipulation experiments. Fig. 4a–c show the topographic image and corresponding lateral PFM amplitude and phase images before electrical switching was performed. Then the region in the white box was first subjected to a +150 V tip voltage, as shown in Fig. 4f. It clearly shows that partial of the phase contrast in the scanned region is opposite, which reveals partial in-plane polarization direction was switched. The same region was further subjected to an opposite tip voltage of −150 V. An obvious switching between the purple domains and the yellow domains was observed; this switching, although just partial, indicated that the thin film can be reversibly switched between two ferroelectric states.

From the perspective of the crystal structure, organic–inorganic hybrid lead iodide perovskites are expected to exhibit semiconducting properties. We took ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra measurements for [SAPD]PbI3 to determine the optical bandgap. As shown in Fig. 5, we observed a strong UV absorption edge at about 500 nm, a result consistent with the crystal color. The absorption spectrum showed the characteristics of indirect bandgap semiconductors and the bandgap (Eg) was calculated to be 2.31 eV from the Tauc plot.

In summary, we have demonstrated a 1D organic–inorganic hybrid lead iodide perovskite ferroelectric [SAPD]PbI3. It was observed to exhibit an evident SHG signal intensity stronger than that of KDP. It also displayed a large spontaneous polarization with a value of ca. 10 μC cm−2, superior to those of most molecular ferroelectrics of the organic–inorganic hybrid system. PFM tests with polarization switching further confirmed the ferroelectric properties of [SAPD]PbI3. [SAPD]PbI3 also showed a bandgap of 2.31 eV, indicating a potential semiconducting ferroelectric material. Developing materials displaying the fascinating feature of coupling light with ferroelectricity is a long-sought goal. Salicylaldehyde Schiff bases tend to undergo enol–keto isomerization under photoirradiation and to show significant photochromism. Light as a contactless and remote-controlled medium can effectively trigger this process in the solid state of the target material. Ferroelectrics must crystallize in ten polar point groups to be one of the ten polarity point groups. On the premise of satisfying the above basic element, light induced specific reversible structural isomerization can realize optical control of ferroelectric polarization.35 As a result, the coupling of photoisomerization and light-induced changes of ferroelectric-related properties in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is expected to produce an unprecedented class of photoswitchable hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics, indicating great prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices. Unfortunately, [SAPD]PbI3 does not exhibit typical photochromic behavior. We will be continuing to investigate the photo-triggered ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskites based on this work. We expect to publish the results of these investigations in due course.
