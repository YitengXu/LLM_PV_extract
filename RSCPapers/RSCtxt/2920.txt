    First published on 28th February 2013AbstractTriplet photosensitizers (PSs) are compounds that can be efficiently excited to the triplet excited state which subsequently act as catalysts in photochemical reactions. The name is originally derived from compounds that were used to transfer the triplet energy to other compounds that have only a small intrinsic triplet state yield. Triplet PSs are not only used for triplet energy transfer, but also for photocatalytic organic reactions, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photoinduced hydrogen production from water and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion. A good PS should exhibit strong absorption of the excitation light, a high yield of intersystem crossing (ISC) for efficient production of the triplet state, and a long triplet lifetime to allow for the reaction with a reactant molecule. Most transition metal complexes show efficient ISC, but small molar absorption coefficients in the visible spectral region and short-lived triplet excited states, which make them unsuitable as triplet PSs. One obstacle to the development of new triplet PSs is the difficulty in predicting the ISC of chromophores, especially of organic compounds without any heavy atoms. This review article summarizes some molecular design rationales for triplet PSs, based on the molecular structural factors that facilitate ISC. The design of transition metal complexes with large molar absorption coefficients in the visible spectral region and long-lived triplet excited states is presented. A new method of using a spin converter to construct heavy atom-free organic triplet PSs is discussed, with which ISC becomes predictable, C60 being an example. To enhance the performance of triplet PSs, energy funneling based triplet PSs are proposed, which show broadband absorption in the visible region. Applications of triplet PSs in photocatalytic organic reactions, hydrogen production, triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion and luminescent oxygen sensing are briefly introduced.

1. Introduction
1.1. General background
Upon photoexcitation, an excited singlet state of an organic chromophore will be initially populated. Usually the lowest excited singlet state S1 is involved in the subsequent photophysical processes (Kasha's rule). For example, radiative S1 → S0 decay produces the fluorescence.1–3 The triplet state of the chromophore can be populated via S1 → Tn intersystem crossing (ISC, n ≥ 1), thus efficient ISC is essential for triplet photosensitizers (PSs). Triplet PSs should show strong absorption (large molar absorption coefficient, ε) of visible or UV light and efficient ISC to produce the triplet excited state.
In comparison to the studies of fluorophores,4–9 the investigation of triplet excited state-related chromophores or the photophysical process is less developed (Fig. 1).10–12 Chromophores with the triplet excited state that has been populated upon excitation (not necessarily limited to photoexcitation) can be used in many areas, such as electroluminescence,13–20 phosphorescent bioimaging or molecular sensing,21–23 photodynamic therapy (PDT, via sensitization of singlet oxygen, 1O2),24–27 photoinitiated polymerization and more recently photocatalytic organic reactions.28–31 Different from the fluorophores, which are mainly used for luminescence purposes, triplet PSs are mainly used as triplet energy donors to initiate photochemical and photophysical processes, such as PDT,24–27 photocatalytic organic reactions,28–31 and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion (UC).32–34 An ideal triplet PS should show strong absorption of visible light, high triplet state quantum yields (effective ISC) and a long-lived triplet excited state.35,36
 Fig. 1  Comparison of the number of publications on the singlet excited states and triplet excited states related studies. Data are from SciFinder (as of Dec 31, 2012), searched with the keywords (a) ‘fluorescence’, ‘phosphorescence’. (b) ‘fluorophore + preparation’ and ‘triplet photosensitizer + preparation’. 
It is still a challenge to design a triplet PS, i.e. a chromophore with predetermined ISC property, especially the chromophores without any heavy atoms. This difficulty is mainly due to the lack of established relationships between the ISC and molecular structures.1
Chemical modification of a known chromophore, the method widely used for preparation of new fluorophores,4–7 is often not applicable to triplet PSs. ISC can disappear with subtle derivatization of a known triplet PS.1,3 For example, one may postulate that anthracene and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) will show similar fluorescence properties because of their similar π-conjugation frameworks. However, anthracene and DPA show drastically different photophysical properties. Anthracene shows a fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) of 27% (in ethanol), due to the efficient S1 → T2 ISC.1 But for DPA, ΦF is up to 95%. The reason for these differences is the fact that phenyl substitution shifts the T2 state above the S1 state, thus changing the ISC quantum yields (ΦISC) of anthracene from 73% to less than 5% for DPA.1,37
The principal photophysical processes involved in fluorescence, i.e. S0 → S1 → S0 (simplified consideration, Fig. 2), are usually quantum mechanically allowed. The triplet excited state related processes (S0 → S1 → T1 or S0 → S1 → Tn → T1), however, are basically quantum mechanically forbidden.

Photoexcitation and radiative decay are marked as solid lines and the non-radiative processes are marked as dotted lines.1,2 
This review article will give a brief introduction to ISC of organic chromophores, and will focus on molecular design methods and the principal photophysics of triplet PSs.1 Typically, newly developed triplet PSs will also be discussed. Moreover, the methods for the design of triplet PSs that show strong absorptivity of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states will be summarized. We will also present some new ideas for the design of heavy atom-free organic chromophores that show predetermined ISC property, and triplet PSs that show broadband absorption in the visible spectral region. The limitations of these methods will also be discussed.
1.2. To produce the triplet excited states of organic chromophores: ISC
Population of the T1 state of an organic chromophore requires a non-radiative transition S1 → Tn or S1 → T1, i.e., ISC. This transition involves two different spin states. Energy and the total angular momentum (orbital and spin) have to be conserved during ISC. The most important interaction that couples two spin states and that provides a means of conserving the total angular momentum is the coupling of the electron spin with the orbital angular momentum, i.e., the spin–orbit coupling (SOC).1
In the following sections we will briefly introduce the triplet PSs and discuss various factors that enhance ISC.1

1.2.1. Triplet PSs based on the heavy atom effect. 
Atoms with large atomic number can induce strong SOC, and as a result, enhance ISC. An electron moving in the vicinity of a nucleus with positive charge Z will be accelerated to relativistic velocity. As a result the coupling of the spin (μS) and the orbital (μL) magnetic momentum is strong. This heavy atom effect is actually a nuclear-charge effect,1 and scales with Z4 (Z is the nuclear charge). This mechanism is used for the design of the heavy atom-containing triplet PSs (see later sections). Typical heavy atoms include Ir, Pt, Ru, Os, Re, Rh, I and Br, etc.1
Therefore, one straightforward approach to prepare triplet PSs is to attach heavy atoms to a chromophore. Various transition metal complexes have been prepared following this line, but mainly for electro-luminescence.38,39 These complexes can be used as triplet PSs if the absorption in the visible region is strong. Unfortunately most of the complexes show small molar absorption coefficients (ε) in the visible spectral range (e.g. ε < 10000 M−1 cm−1). Triplet PSs with iodo- or bromo-substituents and the transition metal complexes belong to this category.24,40,41


1.2.2. Chromophores with low-lying n–π* transitions. 
Similar to the radiative transitions between different electronic states, selection rules apply to ISC.1 For example, the energy and angular momentum must be conserved in ISC.1 Perturbation theory requires that the energy difference between the two states involved in the transition should be small and close to the perturbation energy. If the S1 and T1 states originate from the same electronic configuration, the energy difference between these states is twice the electron exchange integral J for the pair of singly occupied orbitals.1J will decrease exponentially as the separation of the orbitals increases.
For n–π* transition, the exchange integral and consequently the S1/T1 states energy gap is small. ISC is much easier for these compounds, such as benzophenone.1 The exchange integral for π–π* transitions is usually much larger. As a result the energy difference between the S1 and T1 states is large for the compounds with low-lying π–π* transitions. Therefore ISC is weak in normal organic aromatic chromophores with large π-conjugation frameworks. According to El-Sayed's selection rule for ISC,1 S1 (n, π*) → T1(π,π*) is an allowed transition because the angular momentum is conserved and the S1/T1 state energy gap is small. The El-Sayed rule states that S1(π–π*)–T1(π–π*) is a forbidden transition. Thus most aromatic chromophores are fluorescent and the S1 → T1 ISC is ineffective. As a result, these compounds cannot be used as triplet PSs.
Equations are available to estimate the ISC rate constants (e.g.eqn (1)),42 where HSO is the Hamiltonian for the spin–orbit coupling and ΔES1–T1 is the energy gap between singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states. ISC can be modeled by a mixing of T1 with S1 states due to SOC, and the rate constant can be expressed as eqn (1). This equation indicates that the ISC takes place between singlet and triplet excited states with a small energy gap. (1)


1.2.3. Chromophores with exciton coupling. 
When two identical chromophores were incorporated into one molecule in close vicinity, but without π-conjugation, then the exciton coupling, i.e. the interaction of the transition dipole moments of the chromophores, leads to two delocalized excited states for every local excitation of the single chromophore. If the lower of the two singlet exciton states is closer in energy to the triplet state, ISC can be enhanced.1,43,44 Exceptions do exist. For example, it was found that ISC of a Bodipy dimer is not dependent on the exciton coupling effect.26,45


1.2.4. Triplet PSs based on an intramolecular spin converter. 
Without the heavy atom effect, it is difficult to predict the ISC property of a chromophore from the point of view of organic chemists, i.e. the molecular structures. Therefore, development of a general molecular motif for triplet PSs is highly desired. With the general molecular motifs, ISC should become predictable and the chemical modification of the molecular structure should be feasible, and it should not eliminate the ISC property.
Concerning this aspect, a dyad as a triplet PS can be constructed, in which an intramolecular energy acceptor with intrinsic ISC property is used as a spin converter together with a light-harvesting energy donor. The most promising aspect of this strategy is that the ISC of these heavy atom-free chromophores is predictable. At present C60 is used as such a spin converter.46–53 Recently we attached antennae to C60 and the resulting dyads/triads were successfully used as triplet PSs for 1O2 photosensitization and TTA UC.49–53
Furthermore, most of the available triplet PSs are based on a single chromophore molecular structural profile, which cannot effectively harvest the excitation energy of a panchromatic light source, for example, solar light. In this review we will also describe a method for enhancing the efficiency of triplet PSs, i.e., an energy funneling strategy based on multi-intramolecular energy transfer (EnT) from the antenna to the energy acceptor. These triplet PSs show broadband absorption in the visible range. However, it should be pointed out that intramolecular electron transfer is a competitive channel to the EnT to dissipate the excited state energy of the energy donor.


1.2.5. Spectroscopy for the study of triplet excited states. 
Different from the singlet excited state, the triplet excited state of a chromophore is not definitely populated upon photoexcitation of a chromophore. Some triplet PSs are phosphorescent,13,20,35,54,55 but some are non-phosphorescent, thus appropriate spectroscopy is crucial for studying the non-luminescent triplet excited states, as well as the lifetime of the T1 state. Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a typical method for such a purpose (Fig. 2).1,56–58
TA spectroscopy is based on the pulse–probe (or pump–probe) method. Two light sources were used for acquiring the TA spectrum. One beam from a xenon lamp is for monitoring the absorption change, another pulsed laser is for pump purposes. TA spectroscopy can be used for studying the localization of the triplet excited states of molecular dyads.49,51,59,60 Note that transient species other than those at the triplet excited state can also be detected by TA spectra, such as charge separated species, the cation/anion radicals.
A complementary method for studying the triplet excited state to TA spectroscopy is the time-resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy, or laser induced optoacoustic spectroscopy, which are based on the photothermal methods. These methods have been used for studying the lifetime as well as the quantum yield of triplet excited states of some chromophores.61


1.2.6. Applications of the triplet PSs. 
The applications of fluorophores are normally based on their luminescent ability. However, different from the fluorophores, the applications of triplet PSs are usually based on the triplet–triplet-energy-transfer (TTET) from the PS to the acceptor, or photoinduced electron transfer (ET) between the triplet PSs and the reactants. At present, the applications are still limited by using the triplet PSs that show weak absorption of visible light, such as in the photocatalytic organic reaction, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 is still the most popular photocatalyst, although it gives weak absorption in the visible region.13–28 Thus development of new triplet PSs that show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states is highly desired. Conventionally transition metal complexes, which show weak absorption in the visible region and short-lived triplet excited states but high phosphorescence quantum yield, were usually used for electroluminescence.14,38 Visible light-harvesting Ru(II) polyimine complexes were widely used as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).62 It should be pointed out that organic dyes, without producing triplet excited states upon photoexcitation, were also used for DSCs.62g,h These applications will not be discussed in this review article.
One of the major applications of triplet PSs is PDT.24–27 In this case the energy is transferred from the triplet excited state of the PSs to the O2 molecules that are in the ground state (which is the triplet state), and the product singlet oxygen (1O2) is highly reactive for oxidation. 1O2 quantum yield (ΦΔ) is an important parameter for characterization of the efficiency of a triplet PS to produce 1O2 upon photoexcitation. The visible light-harvesting ability, both wavelength and molar absorption coefficients (ε) and the triplet state quantum yields (ΦISC) are also crucial for triplet PSs.
Triplet PSs were also used for triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion and the detailed mechanism of TTA upconversion has been discussed in recent literatures.32–34 The visible light-harvesting ability, lifetime of the triplet excited state and the triplet state quantum yield of triplet PSs are crucial for TTA upconversion. Therefore, as we have proved with Ru(II), Pt(II) and Ir(III) complexes, triplet PSs with strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet states are desired for TTA upconversion.35a
Another newly developed application of the triplet PSs is the photocatalytic preparative organic reactions.28–31 Currently most of the reported triplet PSs are those un-derivatized on-the-shelf compounds. We believe that designing of tailored organic triplet PSs for photocatalytic organic reactions will be flourishing. More detailed discussion of the application of triplet PSs will be disclosed in the later section.

2. Transition metal complexes as triplet PSs
Due to the heavy atom effect of transition metal atoms such as Pt(II), Ir(III), Ru(II), etc., efficient ISCs were usually observed for these complexes.12–15,63–65 Conventionally these complexes were used for electroluminescence.14,38,39,66,67 The molar absorption coefficients (ε) in the visible spectral region are small, which is a significant drawback for these transition metal complexes to be used as triplet PSs for the new applications such as photocatalysis,36,68–70 luminescent molecular probes,21–23,71–74 and TTA upconversion.32–35 Therefore, most of these complexes are actually not suitable to be used as triplet PSs, although these complexes are still being used in photocatalysis.36,68–70
The weak absorptivity of the transition metal complexes in the visible spectral region is due to at least two reasons, first, the lack of coordination ligands that show strong absorption of visible light. For example, the typical diimine ligand, 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), shows absorption only in the UV region; second, the typical S0 → 1MLCT transition is featured by weak absorption.13,15,63–65 Furthermore, these complexes usually show short T1 state lifetime (less than 10 μs).
The traditional application, i.e. electroluminescence, does not require strong absorption of visible light and a long-lived T1 state (a long-lived T1 state is actually detrimental to electroluminescence).13,14,75 However, new applications of transition metal complexes have been developed, such as photocatalysis,36,68–70 phosphorescent molecular probes,21,22 phosphorescent bioimaging,21–23,71–73,76 and recently TTA UC.32–34,77 Concerning all these new applications, strong absorption in the visible range and/or a long-lived triplet excited state is crucial.35
A straightforward approach to prepare a transition metal complex that shows strong absorption in the visible region is to attach a visible light-harvesting chromophore, a typical fluorophore, such as boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy),4,5,9 to the coordination centre.79–81 Fluorophores usually exhibit strong absorption of visible light.2–7 However, very often this method does not lead to the transition metal complexes that show the effective strong absorption of visible light, i.e. the excitation energy harvested by the chromophore cannot be funnelled efficiently to the coordination centre or the triplet excited state manifold.79 As a result, complexes may show strong absorption of visible light, but the production of triplet excited states may not be enhanced.79–82
Based on the reported results, including those from our own group,35,63–65,83 two methods are available for preparation of transition metal complexes that show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states. (1) To dangle, or to tether, a visible light-harvesting antenna to the coordination centre, i.e. there is no π-conjugation between the coordination centre and the light harvesting ligand. In this case, the energy level of the ligand-localized singlet state (1IL state) have to be higher than the 1MLCT state of the coordination centre, otherwise the EnT from the ligand to the coordination centre will be frustrated. Note that the direct ISC (1IL → 3IL) is not efficient because the electrons in the frontier orbitals of the antenna are far away from the heavy atom. As a result, there is a limitation on the absorption wavelength for this method, i.e. the absorption wavelength of the ligand cannot be longer than the absorption wavelength of the coordination centre; and (2) to attach a visible light-harvesting ligand to the coordination centre by a π-conjugation bond, such as a CC bond,60,84–87 or direct metalation of a fluorophore (the antenna as the carbon donor of the C–metal bond).80,88–90 In this case the limitation of the first method can be eliminated, and the effective absorption wavelength can be easily extended.57,60b,80,89,90 However, limitations do exist for this approach either, that is, with increasing bulkiness of the visible light-harvesting antenna, the ISC will become less efficient and the indication for this effect is the significant residual fluorescence of the ligand.86,91
Besides the strong absorption of visible light, the long-lived triplet state is also important for triplet PSs, for example, in TTA UC,77,92 and luminescent O2 sensing,60,85,93 for which the TTET process is the crucial step. The methods for prolongation of the T1 state lifetime include either establishment of triplet states equilibrium between the 3MLCT excited state and the ligand-localized excited state (3IL state),35,60,94,95 or switching of the T1 state from 3MLCT to the 3IL.35,60,64,95 Readers are suggested to refer to some recent reviews on this subject.35,63,64,95
2.1. Ru(II) complexes as triplet PSs
Typical Ru(II) polyimine complexes show moderate absorption at ca. 450 nm, e.g. Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2.65 Coumarin-containing Ru(II) complex 1 (Fig. 3) shows strong absorption at 341 nm.96 The molar absorption coefficients (ε = 78700 M−1 cm−1) increased by 5-fold compared to the model complex 2 (ε = 14000 M−1 cm−1).
 Fig. 3  (a) Ru(II) complex 1 with a coumarin light-harvesting ligand and the model complex 2.96 (b) Energy level diagram describing the photophysical processes of complex 1. 
For 1, the energy level of the coumarin 1IL state is higher than the 1MLCT state, thus efficient EnT, or internal conversion (IC), from coumarin to the coordination centre occurs.96 The energy level of the 3IL state of coumarin (2.70 eV) is substantially higher than the 3MLCT state, thus the phosphorescence lifetime (τP) and the quantum yield (ΦP) were not perturbed by the ligand.97 On the other hand, the photophysical properties of the coordination centre will be profoundly altered given the 3IL state energy level is close to or much lower than the energy level of the 3MLCT state.63,94,97
A Ru(II) complex with pyrene units tethered to the coordination ligand (Phen) was reported (3, Fig. 4).98 The absorption in the 300–350 nm region is enhanced due to the pyrene units. The 3IL state energy level is close to the 3MLCT state, as a result a triplet state equilibrium is established, the lifetime of the triplet excited state (τP = 148 ± 8 μs) is greatly extended vs. complex Ru(phenyl-phen)3[PF6]2 (τP = 1.15 μs). Similar enhanced absorption of visible light and a long-lived triplet state (τT = 115 μs) were observed for the Ru(II) polyimine complex with other chromophores, such as 4-piperidinyl-1,8-naphthalimide (4, Fig. 4).64,94,95
 Fig. 4  Ru(II) complexes 3 and 4 with the 3IL state energy level close to the 3MLCT state.94,98 
The 3MLCT state of the coordination centre will be quenched given the 3IL state energy level is much lower than the 3MLCT state, which can be demonstrated by complex 5 (Fig. 5).79 Bodipy is a well-known fluorophore for its strong absorption of visible light and high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF), as well as versatile derivatization chemistry.4–6,99 The 3IL state energy level of Bodipy (ca. 1.72 eV) is lower than the 3MLCT state of the Ru(II) coordination centre (1.94 eV), therefore the phosphorescence from the 3MLCT state is completely quenched by 3MLCT → 3IL.79 The TA spectrum indicated that the triplet state is localized on the Bodipy unit.79 The upward 1IL → 1MLCT EnT is unlikely because the 1IL state energy level is lower than the 1MLCT state. In other words, the strong visible light absorption of 5 (ε = 66000 M−1 cm−1 at 523 nm) is not much helpful to improve the production of the triplet excited state. No application of this complex in the photophysical process was reported.

2.2. Cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes as triplet PSs
Another method for preparation of transition metal complexes that show strong absorption in the visible region is by establishment of π-conjugation between the coordination centre and the light-harvesting antenna,56,60,86,87 or by direct metalation of the light-harvesting ligand (complexes 6–8, Fig. 6).80,88–90 The energy level diagram in Fig. 5 indicated that if the absorption of the ligand is more red-shifted than the coordination center, the 1IL → 1MLCT EnT will be frustrated. Therefore, another intramolecular EnT channel, i.e. the direct 1IL → 3IL ISC, has to be efficient to ensure efficient production of the triplet excited state. Concerning this aspect, the most efficient method is to maximize the heavy atom effect by direct metalation of the ligand (the antenna, Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Ir(III) complexes 6–8 with directly metalated Coumarin 6 ligand.88 
The dipyrrinato ligand was used for preparation of Ir(III) complexes that show strong absorption of visible light (complexes 9–15, Fig. 7).80 Dipyrrinato is the chromophore of the fluorophore of Bodipy.4,5 All the complexes show strong absorption of visible light at 470–485 nm (ε = 38000 M−1 cm−1). RT phosphorescence at 658–685 nm was observed (τT = 12.9−23.1 μs). Production of the 3IL state was proposed for these complexes, but the applications of the complexes were not reported.80

Similar to the visible light-harvesting Ru(II) complexes,100 we used coumarin ligands for preparation of Ir(III) complexes (complexes 18–19, Fig. 8).101 The triplet state lifetimes of 18 and 19 (75.5 μs and 73.6 μs, respectively) are much longer than that of the corresponding Ru(II) complexes 16 and 17.100 With TA spectroscopy, emission spectra at 77 K and spin density analysis, the T1 states of 18 and 19 are identified as the coumarin–imidizole localized 3IL state. These complexes were used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion and ΦUC values of 21.3% and 23.4% were observed.101 Recently, these complexes were proved to be highly effective as visible light-harvesting photocatalysts for ring-opening photopolymerization of epoxides102 and photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxylnaphthalene.103

Bodipy-containing Ir(III) complexes which show strong absorption of visible light (ε = 83600 M−1 cm−1 at 501 nm) and a long-lived Bodipy-localized 3IL state (τT = 25 μs) were reported (complex 20, Fig. 9).81 However, the π-core of the Bodipy unit is not directly linked to the coordination centre, thus the heavy atom effect is not efficient; moreover, the Bodipy-localized 1IL state energy level (2.43 eV) is lower than the 1MLCT state energy level, thus 1IL → 1MLCT EnT (or IC) is frustrated. Experiments show that (1) the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand is not completely quenched and (2) RT phosphorescence of Bodipy is absent, which is to some extent an indication of weak ISC.81
 Fig. 9  Bodipy containing Ir(III) complexes 20, 22, 23 and the model complex 21.81,82 The complexes are positively charged and the cations ([PF6]−) were omitted for clarity. 
Connecting the π-core of Bodipy to the Ir(III) coordination centre via CC bonds may improve the ISC. Following this line, we prepared two Ir(III) complexes (Fig. 9).82 The Bodipy unit is tethered to the ligand in 22 (no π-conjugation exists between the coordination centre and the Bodipy unit). In 23, however, the π-core of the Bodipy unit is directly π-conjugated to the coordination center via a CC triple bond (Fig. 9).82 Strong absorption of visible light was observed for both 22 (ε = 71400 M−1 cm−1 at 499 nm) and 23 (ε = 83000 M−1 cm−1 at 527 nm). Fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand is more significantly quenched in 23 than in 22. RT phosphorescence of the Bodipy unit was observed at 742 nm for 23, but not for 22. TA spectra and spin density analysis indicated Bodipy-localized 3IL states for both 22 and 23, but the triplet state lifetimes are different (23.7 μs and 87.2 μs, respectively). 22 and 23 were used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion and the ΦUC value of 23 is 2-fold that of 22, which indicated that the ISC in 23 is more efficient. ΦΔ values indicated the efficiency of the ISC. For 23, ΦΔ = 97%, which is ca. 2-fold that of 22 (ΦΔ = 52%). These results indicate that attaching a fluorophore to the coordination centre via a π-conjugation linker is a useful method for design of Ir(III) complexes that show effective strong absorption of visible light.

          N⁁N Pt(II) bis(acetylide) complexes as triplet PSs
The fascinating aspect of these complexes is that the photophysical properties can be readily changed by using different acetylide ligands and the preparation of the complexes is facile.13,56,66,104,105 Recently these complexes were used for photocatalytic H2 production.106 However, usually N⁁N Pt(II) complexes show very weak absorptivity in the visible region and the T1 state lifetime is short,13,56,66 thus much room is left to develop new visible light-harvesting complexes.
A way to enhance the absorptivity and to prolong the T1 state lifetime is to attach fluorophores to a metal centre. Following this line, acetylide fluorophores were attached to the Pt(II) centre of the N⁁N Pt(II) bisacetylide complex to enhance the absorption in the visible range (Fig. 10).57,60b,86,107,108 The preparation of 24 follows the method of direct metalation of the chromophore.57 Strong absorption in the visible range was observed (ε = 68000 M−1 cm−1 at 570 nm). However, the T1 state lifetime is short (246 ns) and no RT phosphorescence was observed.

Recently we prepared a series of N⁁N Pt(II) complexes with naphthalenediimide (NDI) acetylide,86 rhodamine and fluorene acetylides.107–110 Strong absorption in the visible region and long-lived T1 states were observed for these Pt(II)bisacetylide complexes.35 The complexes were used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion.35,77
A complex with two Pt(II) coordination centres connected to one Bodipy unit 25 was reported (Fig. 11).60b The heavy atom effect of Pt atoms is expected to be maximized in 25, to ensure efficient ISC. Strong absorption of visible light (ε = 53800 M−1 cm−1 at 574 nm) and a long-lived T1 state (τT = 125.8 μs) were observed for 25. In contrast, the model complex 26 shows very weak absorption in the visible range (ε = 16200 M−1 cm−1 at 414 nm) and a short T1 lifetime (τT = 6.5 μs).60b Notably, with 25, the RT phosphorescence of Bodipy was observed for the first time.79,81,11125 was used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion and a ΦUC of 5.2% was observed (excited with 635 nm laser).60b

We prepared red-light excitable fluorescent bis(trialkylphosphine) platinum(II) bis(aryleneethynylene) complexes.60c Ethynyl Bodipys were used as acetylide ligands. The complexes show weak residual fluorescence of the Bodipy ligands. For the complexes with two Pt(II) coordination centers attached to one Bodipy ligand, RT phosphorescence of the Bodipy moiety was observed. These complexes show strong absorption of visible light (ε = 42300 M−1 cm−1 at 643 nm), and the lifetime of the 3IL state is up to 72.4 μs. TTA upconversion quantum yields are up to 19.0%.60c The designing of these complexes follows the method of direct metalation of organic chromophores, to maximize the ISC effect.
Bodipy–benzoporphyrin platinum complex 29 was reported, which contains two isolated chromophores, i.e. the Bodipy and Pt(II) benzoporphyrin (Fig. 12).112 The Bodipy parts give absorption at 450–550 nm and the benzoporphyrin-Pt coordination center gives absorption in the regions of 400–450 nm and 600–650 nm. Bodipy shows a S1 state with higher energy level than the Pt-benzoporphyrin unit, thus the Föster EnT from Bodipy to the coordination center was observed. Furthermore, the energy level of the 3IL state of the Bodipy unit is close to that of the Pt(II) coordination centre, as a result, an equilibrium between the Bodipy-localized 3Bodipy* state and the 3Por* state is established and long-lived phosphorescence (67 μs) was observed at 772 nm. The model complex 27 gives a τP of 30 μs. The designing of this complex demonstrated that (1) by attaching Bodipy units to the coordination centre and the concerted energy levels of both the singlet state and the triplet state of the two parts of the dyads, panchromatic absorption in the visible region occurred, which is helpful to improve the performance of triplet PSs, especially where a panchromatic excitation light source was used, such as solar light; (2) forward singlet EnT from the antenna to the coordination center and backward triplet EnT were observed, which is impossible for fluorescent molecular arrays.6,9

2.4. Re(I) tricarbonyl chloride complexes
Re(I) complexes have been widely used for phosphorescent biolabeling or bioimaging, as well as photocatalysis.22,76,113–115 However, normally Re(I) complexes show very weak absorptivity in the visible spectral region and the triplet state lifetime is short (only a few μs).76,113 The aforementioned molecular design strategies are also applicable to the designing of Re(I) complexes that show strong absorption of visible light.
A napthaleneimide (NI)-containing Re(I) complex was reported (30, Fig. 13),116 which shows enhanced absorption in the blue range (centred at 408 nm) compared to [Re(phen)(CO)3Cl]. An excited state equilibrium was established between 3IL and 3MLCT states. τP of up to 651 μs was observed for 30.116
 Fig. 13  Re(I) complex 30 with intramolecular ‘ping-pong’ EnT and the model complex 31.116 
Direct metalation of dipyrrinato was used for preparation of Re(I) complexes (complexes 32–37. Fig. 14).117 The complexes show strong absorption in the 470–490 nm range, ε is up to 42100 M−1 cm−1, which is much stronger than the known Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes.76,113 The lifetime of the triplet excited state was not reported.117

Recently we prepared Re(I) complexes with coumarin as the visible light-harvesting ligand (complex 38, Fig. 15).118a38 shows much stronger absorption (ε = 60800 M−1 cm−1 at 473 nm) than 39. With TA spectroscopy and spin density analysis, we proved that the T1 state of 38 is localized on the coumarin part (3IL state), which is responsible for the weak emission of 38 (ΦP = 0.03%, λem = 605 nm) but long-lived triplet state lifetime (τT = 86.0 μs), compared to 39 (ΦP = 23.4%, λem = 554 nm, τT = 2.2 μs). These Re(I) complexes were used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion. ΦUC values of 17.0% and 16.9% were observed for 38 and 40, respectively. Thus the weak emission does not necessarily deter the complexes from being used in the TTET process. No upconversion was observed with 39.118a

The visible light-harvesting ability of the complexes is important. The overall upconversion ability (or apparent brightness, η = ε × ΦUC) of 38 and 40 are different.7738 is with stronger absorption at the excitation wavelength (ε = 60700 M−1 cm−1 at 473 nm) than 40 (ε = 1580 M−1 cm−1). Therefore, despite the same ΦUC values, 38 and 40 have drastically different upconversion ability (η = 10320 M−1 cm−1 and 267 M−1 cm−1, respectively). This 38-fold different upconversion capability is clearly visible to unaided eyes (Fig. 15).118a
Recently we prepared Re(I) tricarbonyl chloride complexes with the Bodipy π-conjugated bpy ligand.118b These complexes show large molar absorption coefficients in the visible spectral region (ε = 64600 M−1 cm−1 at 574 nm) and the lifetime of the triplet excited state is up to 127.2 μs. The Re(I) complexes were used for singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitization and TTA upconversion. The 1O2 quantum yield is up to 88% and the TTA upconversion quantum yield is up to 8.5%.
It should be pointed out that the design and application of transition metal complexes that show strong absorption of visible light are still in their very early stages. For example, currently most of the transition metal complexes used as photocatalysts in the H2 production from water (see later section) are still Pt(II) or Ir(III) complexes that show weak absorptivity in the visible spectral region,36,69,70,106,119,120 and the most popular photocatalyst for photocatalytic organic reactions is still Ru(bpy)3Cl2.28–31 Recently we used the transition metal complexes that show strong visible light absorption for TTA UC and photooxidation, and the results demonstrated that the performance of the new complexes is much better than the complexes that show weak absorptivity of visible light.35,77,103
3. Iodo- or bromo-substituted organic chromophores as triplet PSs
Besides the transition metal atoms, iodo and bromo atoms can also be used for the heavy atom effect purpose.1,3 Therefore, some organic chromophores with iodo- and bromo-substitution have been used as triplet PSs.24,25,40,41,121
Rose Bengal and Eosin Blue have been known for a long time, but mainly for staining in microscopy, rather than as triplet PSs (Fig. 16). These compounds were used as triplet PSs for generation of 1O2.123 Eosin Y 46 was used as a triplet PS for photocatalytic aerobic cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions.124 However, it is inconvenient to modify the π-conjugation framework of the xanthane core to change the absorption wavelength.125 Therefore, preparation of PSs with derivatizable molecular structures are desired.
 Fig. 16  Representative iodo- or bromo-containing triplet PSs 41–46.122 
2,6-Diiodo-Bodipy 47 was used as an organic triplet PS (Fig. 17).40ΦF decreased from 70% of the unsubstituted Bodipy (in MeOH) to 2% for 47, indicating enhanced ISC in 47. ΦΔ of 47 was reported to be 1.6-fold that of the Rose Bengal (ΦΔ = 0.76 for RB in MeOH). 47 was used for the intracellular photodynamic study.40 The ISC will be much less efficient if the iodo atom is far away from the π-core of the Bodipy chromophore. For example, 48 and 49 (Fig. 17) show a ΦF of 0.69 and 0.78, respectively.126–128 These high fluorescence quantum yields indicated less efficient ISC in 48 and 49, compared to that in 47 because ΦF + ΦISC = 1 (the non-radiative decay channel is neglected).
 Fig. 17  Iodo-Bodipy 47–49.40,126–128 The crucial difference in the compounds is the position of iodo-substituents. Note 47 is a good triplet PS but 48 and 49 are not. 
Aza-bodipy, which shows longer absorption wavelength than the normal Bodipy, was used to prepare triplet PSs that show absorption in the near IR range (Fig. 18).24,25,41,12951 shows strong absorption at 666 nm (ε = 69900 M−1 cm−1). The triplet state quantum yield (ΦT) of 51 was 78% (τT = 1.6 μs). The ΦΔ of 51 was 70%.129 Similarly other NIR absorbing triplet PSs were reported (Fig. 19).41a Its ΦΔ values were determined to be in the range of 70–80%.

 Fig. 19  NIR absorbing triplet PSs 52–55.41a 
The absorption wavelengths of the aforementioned triplet PSs are relatively fixed at a specific wavelength, i.e. the absorption wavelength cannot be readily changed by chemical modification. To address this drawback, recently we prepared a small library of iodo-Bodipy triplet PSs that show different absorption wavelengths for TTA upconversion (compounds 56–62, Fig. 20).13056 and 57 show much lower ΦF (3.6% and 2.7%, respectively) than the unsubstituted Bodipy (71.2%), indicating the enhanced ISC with iodination. The ΦF of the residual fluorescence became higher for the compounds having a larger π-conjugation framework, such as 58–62. The increased residual fluorescence indicates less efficient ISC,130 which was confirmed by the ΦΔ values. The ΦΔ values of 58, 60 and 61 were determined to be 21%, 45% and 48%, respectively.
 Fig. 20  Iodo-Bodipy derivatives 56–62 as triplet PSs with strong and variable absorption wavelength in the visible region.130 
We used a thienyl unit to prepare the organic triplet PSs that show more red-shifted absorption than 57 (Fig. 21) to (1) study the red-shifting of the absorption upon thienyl substitution; (2) investigate the effect of iodo-substitution on the thienyl moiety on ISC and other photophysical properties, such as the T1 state lifetime (Fig. 21).131 The thienyl unit was widely used as a π-conjugation linker in the PSs of dye-sensitized solar cells.132–137
 Fig. 21  (a) Iodo-thienyl-bodipy 63 and 64 as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion.131 (b) TTA upconversion photos with 63, 64 and 57 as triplet PSs and perylene as the triplet acceptor. With addition of perylene, the emission color changed due to the upconverted fluorescence of perylene. Reproduced with permission from ref. 131. 
Interestingly, τT values of 63 and 64 (94.7 μs and 95.2 μs, respectively) are longer than 57 (56.3 μs). The τT values of the triplet PSs are crucial for the TTET process, which is the key step in TTA upconversion. ΦUC values of 16.5% and 10.3% were observed for 63 and 64, respectively (for 57, ΦUC = 4.5%).131 Therefore, besides the strong visible-light absorption, it is also important to prolong the triplet excited state lifetime (τT) of the triplet PSs.
Besides Bodipy, very few other chromophores were used to prepare triplet PSs by bromination/iodination. Recently we used naphthalenediimide (NDI) for this purpose (Fig. 22).55 NDI was widely used in fluorescent molecular probes and molecular assemblies,138–142 but it was rarely used for triplet excited state studies. Populations of the triplet states of some simple NDI derivatives were reported,143,144 but those compounds showed absorption in the UV range. The absorption of the NDI chromophore can be shifted to longer wavelengths by attaching an amino group to the NDI core,138,145–148 thus we prepared 66, 68 and 69 (Fig. 22).55
 Fig. 22  Bromo-naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives 65–70 as triplet PSs.55 
Long-lived triplet excited states were observed for 66, 68 and 69 (6.1, 11.1 and 51.7 μs, respectively). Interestingly, RT phosphorescence was observed for 66 and 68. Observation of RT phosphorescence of organic chromophores in fluid solution is rare. Note that no RT phosphorescence was observed for iodo-Bodipys.24,40,129,130 These bromo-NDI chromophores were used as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion, and a ΦUC of up to 18.5% was observed with 69.55
Considering the great amount of the organic fluorophores that show strong absorption of visible light, we envisage that more triplet PSs can be prepared following this strategy.
4. Heavy atom-free triplet PSs
Without the heavy atom, it is very difficult to predict the ISC of organic chromophores.1 In this section we will introduce some new methods for designing of heavy-atom free organic triplet PSs that show predictable ISC.
An intramolecular spin converter can be used to address the aforementioned challenge. A spin converter is a chromophore that undergoes efficient ISC, but does not necessarily have to show strong absorption of visible light, rather, a low S1 state energy level is crucial for the spin converter. The principle of this method is to attach a visible light-harvesting unit (intramolecular energy donor) to a spin converter (intramolecular energy acceptor). Upon photoexcitation of the light-harvesting unit, the singlet EnT to the acceptor (i.e. the spin converter) will occur, as a result the S1 state of the spin converter will be populated, and in turn the triplet excited state will be produced via the ISC of the spin converter (Fig. 23, exemplified with C60 as the spin converter), thus the spin converter–chromophore dyads can be used as triplet PSs.
 Fig. 23  Simplified Jablonski diagram depicts the photophysics of a heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizer based on a spin converter, herein exemplified with a C60-antenna dyad (C60 as the spin converter). The different T1 state energy level of the antenna will change the feature of the triplet excited state of the dyad. The charge separated state of the C60 dyad is omitted. 
With this method, more flexibility in molecular design of triplet PSs will be gained, for example, the absorption wavelength of the triplet PSs can be readily changed by using different visible-light antennae, and at the same time, ISC of the dyad becomes predictable. C60 can be used as such a spin converter. Thus heavy atom-free triplet PSs can be easily designed. However, the spin converter is not limited to C60, and any other chromophores that show a similar photophysical property are suitable to be used as spin converters.
4.1. C60–chromophore hybrids as heavy atom-free triplet PSs
Fullerene C60 is an ideal candidate as a spin converter. First, C60 shows efficient inherent ISC (ΦISC close to 100%).149 Second, C60 shows a low S1 state energy level (1.72 eV), thus the absorption wavelength of the energy donor (antenna) can be tuned in a wide range from UV up to ca. 700 nm. Despite the efficient ISC, C60 itself shows very weak absorption in the visible range (e.g. the absorption at 536 nm is 710 M−1 cm−1).149 Therefore, C60 alone is not a good triplet PS.
One method to address this problem is to attach a visible-light-harvesting antenna onto C60.59,150–153 The energy level of the S1 state of the antenna should be higher than the S1 state of C60 (ca. 720 nm).59a Otherwise the S1(antenna) → S1(C60) EnT (or internal conversion) will be frustrated (Fig. 23). The symmetry prohibited S0(C60) → S1(C60) transition of C60 does not necessarily mean a weak S1(antenna) → S1(C60) transition. In other words, the S1(antenna) → S1(C60) process may be highly efficient. Note that this EnT is not simply a Föster process because the spectral overlap between the fluorescence emission of the antenna and the UV/Vis absorption of C60 is not significant, due to the very weak absorption of C60 in the visible region.
The energy level of triplet excited states of the antenna and C60 will determine the localization of the triplet excited state of the dyads (Fig. 23). The T1 state will localize on C60 if the energy level of the T1 state of the antenna is higher than that of C60. Conversely the T1 state will be localized on the antenna, via the backward triplet EnT from C60 to the antenna. The localization of the T1 state can be studied by TA spectroscopy or by using DFT calculations on the spin density surfaces of the C60–organic chromophore hybrids.49,50,80 Localization of the T1 state on the antenna or the C60 part may have a substantial effect on the lifetime of the triplet excited state, which in turn may affect the TTET efficiency significantly. For example, we prepared styryl-Bodipy–C60 and C60–PBI hybrids and the triplet excited state is localized on styryl-Bodipy or PBI, not C60 (indicated by the nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectrum).49,50 This is a rare case in that the energy level of the S1 state of the antenna is higher than C60, but the T1 state energy level of the antenna is lower than the T1 state of C60.49,59b
C60–chromophore dyads or triads were reported, and some show strong visible light absorption. However, the application of these visible light-harvesting dyads to sensitize a photophysical process, such as 1O2 production, or TTA upconversion, is still in its very early stage.47,49–53
Fullerene-o-quinodimethane dyads for 1O2 photosensitization were reported (Fig. 24).154 Without any visible light-harvesting antennae, these compounds show very weak absorptivity in the visible range. ΦΔ values of compounds 71, 73, 75, 76 were determined as 0.64, 0.27, 0.52 and 0.48, respectively.
 Fig. 24  C60-o-quinodimethane bisadducts 71–76.154 
A water soluble C60–γ-cyclodextrin adduct was reported to show a ΦΔ of 77%.155 The water-soluble C60–NVP copolymer was studied for 1O2 photosensitization,156 however the absorption in the visible range is very weak. A star-shaped multi-photon absorption chromophore–C60 derivative was reported (compound 77, Fig. 25).48 The compound shows weak absorption in the visible range. A C60-localized triplet excited state was observed upon photoexcitation. The compound was used for 1O2 photosensitization, but quantitative data are unavailable.
 Fig. 25  Star-shaped multi-chromophore-C60 derivative 77.48 
Fluorene–C60 dyads with fluorene units as 1O2 PSs were reported (Fig. 26).47 C60 dyad 78 shows an absorption maximum at 405 nm (ε = 40400 M−1 cm−1), and the C60 dyad 79 shows absorption at 487 nm (ε = 23500 M−1 cm−1). The fluorescence of the antenna was quenched in the dyads, due to the intramolecular EnT to C60. TA spectra indicated that the T1 states are localized on C60. 1O2 photosensitization is highly dependent on the visible light-harvesting ability of the dyads. For example, the 1O2 photosensitization of compound 82 is 6-fold that of 80. However, the 1O2 photosensitizing ability disappeared in highly polar solvents, such as MeCN and DMF, which indicates that intramolecular ET from the antenna to the C60 become dominant in polar solvents. The ΦΔ values were not reported.47

Subphthalocyanine–fullerene ensembles 83–85 that show strong absorption in the 572–575 nm region (ε is ca. 12600 M−1 cm−1) were reported (Fig. 27).157 The fluorescence of the antenna, i.e. iodo-subphthalocyanine (585 nm, ΦF = 0.08), was substantially quenched in the dyads. TA spectra indicated singlet EnT from subphthalocyanine to C60. The triplet excited states were not investigated.157 Similarly, subphthalocyanine–C60 dyads and subphthalocyanine fused dimer–C60 dyads with strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states were reported.150,158
 Fig. 27  Subphthalocyanine–fullerene ensembles 83–85.157 
C60–Bodipy dyad 86 which shows strong absorption at 502 nm was reported (Fig. 28).59a The antenna fluorescence was significantly quenched in the dyad. The energy level of the charge-transfer state (CTS) can be significantly affected by the solvent polarity. Only in non-polar solvents such as toluene the singlet EnT from the antenna to the C60 unit is dominant.59a In turn the triplet excited state of C60 was produced. TA spectra indicated triplet EnT from the C60 unit to Bodipy, although the 3C60* state is dominant. In polar solvents, e.g. PhCN, the energy level of the CTS is lower than the S1 state of the C60 unit. The charge recombination process can produce the triplet excited state of C60. However, the triplet excited state was not used for photochemical or photophysical processes.59a

Styryl-Bodipy shows more red-shifted absorption than the unsubstituted Bodipy.4,6,159–163 Styryl-Bodipy–C60 dyad 87 was reported (Fig. 29).59b The fluorescence of the antenna at 662 nm quenched to a large extent, indicating intramolecular EnT. ET from the antenna to the C60 unit is an exothermic process in both PhCN (ΔG = –0.68 eV) and toluene (ΔG = −0.40 eV). Bleaching of the antenna at 620 nm was observed in TA spectra, therefore, the styryl-Bodipy-localized triplet state was populated.59b
 Fig. 29  Styryl Bodipy-C60 dyad 87.59b 
Aza-Bodipys show more red-shifted absorption wavelength than the normal Bodipy.24,164–166 The Aza-Bodipy–C60 dyad 88 with strong absorption at 640 nm was reported (Fig. 30).151 The aza-Bodipy fluorescence at 682 nm was quenched in the dyad. The S1 state energy level of aza-Bodipy (1.82 eV) is higher than the S1 state energy level of C60 (1.72 eV),59a thus intramolecular EnT from aza-Bodipy to C60 is likely,167 although the intramolecular ET cannot be excluded. A long-lived aza-Bodipy-localized triplet excited state was observed for 88 (τ = 83 μs).
 Fig. 30  Aza Bodipy-C60 dyad 88151 and the near IR-absorbing azulenocyanines-C60 derivatives 89 and 90.152 
Azulenocyanine–C60 derivatives showing absorption in the near IR region were prepared (Fig. 30), but the triplet excited state was not studied.152 Azulenocyanines are probably not the appropriate antennae for intramolecular EnT because their S1 state energy level is much lower than that of C60, thus the light harvested by the azulenocyanines cannot be efficiently transferred to the C60 unit. However, this rule does not apply to the dyads with the purpose of photoinduced charge separation.
C60–dyads are ideal triplet PSs, because (1) the molecular structure as well as the photophysical properties such as the visible light-absorption can be readily changed by using different antennae; (2) the ISC is predictable; (3) without any heavy atoms in the dyads, the dark toxicity may be low if the compounds were used as PDT reagents. Such combined advantages are unprecedented for triplet PSs. However, preparation and application of such visible-light-harvesting C60 dyads is very rare.
Recently we used C60-dyads that show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states as triplet PSs in photooxidation of organic compounds (1,5-dihydroxylnaphthalene, DHN) (Fig. 31),49,50 and in TTA upconversion.51–53

We used amino-substituted PBI to access red-shifted absorption in 91 (ε = 43700 M−1 cm−1 at 537 nm) and 92 (ε = 25400 M−1 cm−1 at 634 nm) (Fig. 32).50 For compound 91, the antenna fluorescence (λem = 575 nm) was significantly quenched (by 98.1%). Interestingly, the antenna fluorescence in 92 was quenched to a much lesser extent (ca. 62%). The less efficient EnT in 92 is due to the inappropriate S1 state energy level of the antenna of 92 (approximated as 1.70 eV, based on fluorescence), which is slightly lower than the S1 state energy level of the C60 unit (1.72 eV).59a

The 1O2 production of C60 dyads was evaluated using DHN as the 1O2 scavenger (Fig. 31). Production of 1O2 can be followed by monitoring the decrease of UV absorption at 301 nm.168 The two dyads show more efficient 1O2 production than the known PSs methylene blue (MB), but are not as efficient as TPP, which shows strong absorption at 418 nm (ε = 476000 M−1 cm−1). Furthermore, the 1O2 production rate constant of 92 is 73% of that of 91.
In order to enhance the visible light-absorption, we prepared styryl-Bodipy–C60 dyads, triads and tetrads (Fig. 33),49 which show a strong absorption in the 600–650 nm range and ε is up to 120000 M−1 cm−1. Different numbers of C60 were attached to light-harvesting antenna. Our study shows that one C60 unit is sufficient for the intramolecular EnT to trap the photoexcitation energy of the antenna, to undergo ISC, as well as for 1O2 production.49

These C60 derivatives show strong absorption in the 600–650 nm range (e.g. ε = 65300 M−1 cm−1). The fluorescence of the antennae is significantly quenched in the dyads. TA spectra proved that the T1 state of 93–95 is localized on the styryl-Bodipy unit, which means that backward triplet EnT from the C60 unit to the styryl-Bodipy unit occurred.50,59b,151 Notably, the τT (up to 123.2 μs) is much longer than the T1 state lifetime of C60 (ca. 40 μs).149 These results proposed a useful molecular structural design strategy for C60–chromophore dyads, that is, to select an antenna with a lower T1 state energy level than the C60 unit, so that the triplet state will finally reside on the antenna, and as a result the T1 state lifetime will be much longer than the T1 state that localizes on C60 itself. TTET can be enhanced with these long-lived triplet excited states. The 1O2 production rate constant of 95 is 2.7-fold that of MB, and 1.8-fold that of TPP. To the best of our knowledge, no triplet PSs have been reported to show higher 1O2 production ability than TPP and MB.
The application of these triplet PSs is not limited to produce 1O2. These PSs can be used for any photophysical processes that require a triplet excited state to initiate, for example, TTA UC.32,33,77 Previously triplet PSs for TTA UC were Pt(II) and Pd(II) porphyrin complexes.37,77,126,169–175 and Ru(II) polyimine complexes.37,92,100,176 Recently our group developed a series of visible light-absorbing Pt(II),60b,86,107–110 Ir(III),101,177–179 Ru(II),92,100,176 and Re(I) complexes,118 as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion.35,77 We also prepared bromo- and iodo-atom-containing organic compounds as triplet PSs for TTA upconversion.55,130,131 However, all the ISCs of these compounds are based on the heavy atom effect.
Butanedione was used as an organic triplet PS for TTA upconversion, but its absorption is in the UV/blue range.180 2,4,5,7-Tetraiodo-6-hydroxy-3-fluorone TIHF was used as a triplet PS for TTA upconversion. DPA was used as a triplet acceptor.181 Recently we prepared C60–Bodipy dyads as heavy atom-free triplet PSs for TTA upconversion (Fig. 34).51–53
 Fig. 34  C60-Bodipy dyads 96 and 97 used for TTA upconversion and the antennae 98 and 99.51 

96 and 97 show absorption at 515 nm (ε = 70400 M−1 cm−1) and 590 nm (ε = 82500 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The fluorescence of the antennae is quenched in dyads. Population of the C60-localized T1 state was confirmed by TA spectra. τT of 33.2 μs and 35.2 μs were determined for 96 and 97, respectively. These lifetimes are close to the intrinsic lifetime of C60 (ca. 40 μs).149 With perylene as the triplet PS, ΦUC values of 2.9% and 7.0% were determined. The ΦΔ values of 96 and 97 were 73% and 80%, respectively. These results indicated that the ISC in 96 and 97 is efficient. The photophysical properties of 98 and 99 were studied for comparison (Fig. 34).
We prepared a series of C60–Bodipy dyads that show different absorption wavelengths (100–103, Fig. 35). The triphenylamine or carbazole-linked Bodipy in 100–103 shows more red-shifted absorption than the unsubstituted Bodipy. TTA UC was observed with these triplet PSs. However, generally the ΦUC decreased with increasing electron-donating ability of the antenna, which may be due to the intramolecular ET (Fig. 35).52,53
 Fig. 35  C60-Bodipy dyads 100–103 as heavy atom-free triplet PSs for TTA upconversion.52,53 
The molecular structures of most triplet PSs are based on the mono-chromophore profile. Thus the absorption in the visible region is narrow (usually there is only one major absorption band in the visible spectral region), which is a disadvantage for harvesting the excitation light of a panchromatic light source, such as solar light. Triplet PSs with broadband absorption are desired. The straightforward approach is to design triplet PSs with intramolecular EnT, or energy funneling. A similar approach has been widely used for fluorescent molecular assemblies,6,9,78,163 but was never used for triplet PSs. Previously a similar strategy was used for a Bodipy–Porphyrin–Pt multi-chromophore molecular assembly and panchromatic absorption was observed. That compound was not used for any photochemical reactions.112
To address this challenge, we prepared Bodipy–C60 triads/tetrads which contain different Bodipy units (Fig. 36),182 which give different UV/Vis absorption, thus the C60 compounds show panchromatic, or broadband absorption, in the visible region. For example, both Bodipy and styryl-Bodipy were used in 104, as a result, 104 shows strong absorption at 517 nm and 629 nm (ε = 61000 M−1 cm−1 and 83000 M−1 cm−1, respectively).182 Tetrad 105 was prepared, in which three different light-harvesting antennae were incorporated together. TA spectroscopy indicated that the T1 state is localized on the styryl-Bodipy. This conclusion was supported by the analysis of the spin density surface. T1 state lifetimes of 95.3 μs and 132.9 μs were observed for 104 and 105, respectively.
 Fig. 36  Energy funneling based C60-Bodipy triplet PSs 104 and 105 that show broadband absorption.182 
The photooxidation of DHN with these heavy atom-free panchromatic absorbing triplet PSs were compared with that of the normal mono-chromophore triplet PSs such as TPP and MB. The ΦΔ values of 104 and 105 were determined as 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. The new panchromatic absorbing triplet PSs are at least 8.9-fold more efficient than the normal triplet PSs such as TPP and methylene blue.
4.2. Small organic molecules as heavy atom-free triplet PSs
It is more challenging to design small organic molecules as heavy atom-free triplet PSs. The mechanism of the ISC of these compounds vary from one to another (Fig. 37), thus it is difficult to predict the ISC of the organic chromophores.
 Fig. 37  Heavy atom-free organic triplet PSs with absorption bands in UV or blue range.1,3,194 
Some aromatic hydrocarbons show effective ISC (compounds 106–109, Fig. 37).1,3 However, chemical modification of the structures often induce unpredictable photophysical properties. Besides the aforementioned anthracene/DPA, another example is pyrene. Pyrene was extensively used in fluorescent molecular probes.183–188 The luminescence of pyrene is exceptionally long-lived (τF = 450 ns, in cyclohexane),3 which is due to the forbidden nature of the S1 → S0 transition.1 Note that P-type delayed fluorescence can be observed for pyrene at high concentrations. Attaching π-conjugation moiety to pyrene will produce a new fluorophore.188 In these cases the fluorescence of the pyrene becomes normal, for example, the prompt fluorescence was observed and the τF is a few ns, hence the emission is no longer sensitive to O2.186,188,189
Porphyrins have been known for a long time to show the triplet excited state upon photooxidation, thus these compounds are weakly fluorescent at RT (compounds 113–117, Fig. 38).27 For the free base porphrin, the ΦF value is only about 5%. The ΦISC value is up to 90%.190 However, no RT phosphorescence was observed for porphyrin.
 Fig. 38  Porphyrin derivatives 113–117 as triplet PSs.190 
The ISC mechanism of porphyrin is controversial. Recent studies suggested that vibration of the molecule, including excited state intramolecular proton transfer, may facilitate the ISC.190 Porphyrin derivatives were used for PDT.27,191 However, porphyrin-based organic triplet PSs that give large ε values at the lower energy side of the absorption spectrum are highly desired.35,112
Some aromatic ketones show efficient ISC, due to the low-lying n–π* transition, for which the SOC is strong. S1(n–π*) → Tn(π–π*) transition obeys El Sayed's rule.1 For example, ΦISC of benzonphenone (110 in Fig. 37) is ca. 100%.1,192 Benzophenone can be used as a photo-initiator in UV-curing applications. Butadione shows a similar property,180,193 as well as some ketocoumarins (Fig. 37 and 39).194 Ketocoumarins show strong absorption in the UV range (e.g. 350–392 nm, ε is up to 43000 M−1 cm−1).194 The ISC efficiency of these compounds is as high as 0.96 (Fig. 39). The triplet state energy levels of these PSs are in the range of 2.43–2.52 eV.195 However, some aromatic carbonyl compounds, such as phenothiazine derivatives, give strong fluorescence,196 indicating the complexity of the photophysical properties of these compounds.
 Fig. 39  Ketocoumarins 118–124 as triplet PSs.194 
Difluoroboron dibenzoylmethane showing RT phosphorescence in the solid state was reported (126. Fig. 40).54125 gives a strong absorption at 397 nm (ε = 53000 M−1 cm−1). 126 shows similar absorption (ε = 50100 M−1 cm−1 at 396 nm). In solution, both 125 and 126 give fluorescence at 436 nm (ΦF = 0.95 and 0.89). In solid state, 125 shows red-shifted emission at 512–540 nm (fluorescence). For 126, fluorescence at 440 nm was observed. With gated or delayed measurement, long-lived phosphorescence was observed at 509 nm for 126, as well as the delayed fluorescence at 450 nm. The luminescence lifetime is 170 ms. The phosphorescence disappeared if the temperature of the polymer film increased above the glass transition temperature (Tg = 52 °C).54 The same authors proved that the RT phosphorescence disappeared if poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as the matrix instead of PLA.197 Interestingly, the RT phosphorescence is restored for the PCL–polylactide block copolymer.

With increasing actide units in the polymer chain, the fluorescence bands become more significant. Reproduced with permission from ref. 198. 
The relative intensity of the fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emission of a similar difluoroboron dibenzoylmethane polylactide can be tuned by changing the molecular weight of the polymer.198 With increasing molecular weight, the fluorescence emission band becomes more significant than the phosphorescence (127–129, Fig. 40). The phosphorescence can be quenched by O2, but the fluorescence emission is inert to O2, thus ratiometric O2 sensing can be achieved for in vivo hypoxia imaging of tumours.198
Fused PBIs were reported to show efficient ISC (Fig. 41).199 The compounds give strong absorptivity in the visible range, for 130, ε = 72400 M−1 cm−1 at 414 nm, ε = 43600 M−1 cm−1 at 614 nm and ε = 77600 M−1 cm−1 at 671 nm. 131 shows slightly blue-shifted absorption at 408 nm (75900 M−1 cm−1), 601 nm (30900 M−1 cm−1) and 655 nm (61700 M−1 cm−1). Both compounds show weak fluorescence (ΦF = 0.03 and 0.07) and short τF (0.61 and 0.71 ns). The fluorescence bands are at 683 nm and 665 nm, respectively. Based on TA spectroscopy, it was proposed that the triplet excited states were populated and the ΦISC are 0.94 and 0.91. The ΦΔ values are 0.67 and 0.59, respectively. The efficient ISC was proposed due to the twisted molecular skeleton.199,200 Phosphorescence was observed at 1130 nm and 1120 nm for 130 and 131 (77 K), respectively.

Some Bodipy-dimers were reported to show the exciton coupling effect (Fig. 42),43 that is, the absorption band of the monomer split into two absorption bands in the dimer. 133 shows a ΦF of 0.69.43 No study on the triplet excited state was reported. Similar Bodipy dimers showing the exciton coupling effect were reported (135, Fig. 42).44 The dimers show a ΦF of 0.67–0.76. ΦΔ of 135 was determined as 0.4 (with TPP as standard, ΦΔ = 0.70 in aerated toluene).

Recently Bodipy dimers based on a different structural profile were reported (Fig. 43).26 The dimers show no splitting of the UV/Vis absorption bands, thus the exciton coupling mechanism is excluded. The ISC in these Bodipy dimers is believed to be due to the closely-lying or degenerated S1 states of the two isolated yet identical chromophores in the molecule. The ΦΔ values of the dimers 137–139 are 0.51, 0.46 and 0.21, respectively. Later it was shown that application of this approach to the red-absorbing dimers is not straightforward.45

5. Applications of the triplet PSs
5.1. Photodynamic therapy reagents
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) reagents are unique in that the PDT reagents alone are inactive, it is the 1O2 produced by these triplet PSs upon photoexcitation that cure the disease. The important properties of the PDT reagents are the UV/Vis absorption and ISC efficiency, thus their 1O2 production ability. However, the dark toxicity, ability to penetrate tissues and pharmacokinetics of the PDT reagents have to be considered.122,191,201 Usually absorption in the long wavelength region (near IR) is desired, however, this is not always the case and triplet PSs with a short excitation wavelength can also be used as PDT reagents for treatment of skin cancer or lesions. Some of the triplet PSs discussed in this review article have been tested for PDT application, such as the iodo-Bodipy or the iodo-aza-Bodipy derivatives.24–26,40,129,202
Conventionally the PDT reagents are the porphyrin derivatives, due to the near IR absorption and the efficient ISC.27,191 However, the preparation (especially the purification) of these reagents is difficult, and the molecular structures cannot be readily modified. Recently, Bodipy based compounds have attracted much attention for the PDT purposes.24–27,41 The application of the Bodipy chromophore for this purpose is due to its good photostability, readily derivatizable molecular structures, as well as its tunable photophysical properties, such as the absorption wavelength.4,5,9 Absorption ranging from green (500 nm) to near IR can be easily accessed by chemical modification.4,5,9,99,160 Furthermore, the aza-Bodipy shows more red-shifted absorption than the normal Bodipy.5a,24a,41,129,165 However, most of the Bodipy-based triplet PSs are dependent on the heavy atom effect, thus iodine or bromine atoms have to be attached to the π-core of Bodipy.25,41
Visible-light harvesting organic chromophore-C60 hybrids are known for the population of the triplet excited state, but this property was rarely studied for the PDT purpose.45,59,151 Recently we prepared new organic chromophore–C60 hybrids and the compounds were used for TTA upconversion and photosensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2). However, the PDT effect of these compounds was never investigated. It is still a substantial challenge to ‘design’ a heavy atom-free triplet PS for the PDT purpose. Removal of the heavy atom effect may reduce the dark toxicity of the compounds, which is desired for PDT purposes.27,191
5.2. Photoinduced catalytic H2 production
Photoinduced catalytic H2 production from water has attracted much attention.69,70,119,203,204 For the typical mechanism (Fig. 44), firstly the PS was photoexcited, then ET occurs, for example, from a SR to the PS. The electron will transfer to the WRC to produce H2 by reduction of H+. The property of PS, such as visible light-harvesting ability and the triplet excited state lifetime, are crucial for H2 production. However, most of the currently used transition metal complex triplet PSs show weak absorptivity of visible light and short-lived triplet excited states. Therefore, PSs with large molar absorption coefficients (to harvest the excitation energy more efficiently) and long-lived excited states (to allow efficient electron-transfer to occur) are highly desired.36 It should be pointed out that the singlet excited states may be also possible for the photocatalysis.
 Fig. 44  Mechanism for the photoinduced H2 production. PS stands for photosensitizer, SR stands for the sacrificial reductant, WRC stands for the water-reduction catalyst.70 Reproduced with permission from ref. 70. 
Cyclometalated Ir(III) diimine complexes as PSs for photoinduced H2 production were studied (Fig. 45).36,120 The sacrificial reductant is triethanolamine and the electron relay is [Co(bpy)3]Cl2. A blue LED (465 nm) was used for photoexcitation. The complexes show weak absorption at the excitation wavelength, with ε smaller than 1800 M−1 cm−1. Furthermore, the triplet excited state lifetimes of these complexes are generally shorter than 2 μs.

140–145 as PSs for photoinduced H2 production.36 
Ir(phenylazole)2(bpy)]PF6 was used as the PS for H2 production (Fig. 46).70 NEt3 was used as the SR and HFe3(CO)11 was used as the WRC. The absorption of PSs in the visible range is improved. For example, the absorption of 150 is centred at 438 nm (4900 M−1 cm−1). The lifetime of the phosphorescence is slightly extended, but is still less than 10 μs. Turn over numbers (TONs) are 837–1614.70
 Fig. 46  Ir(phenylazole)2(bpy)]PF6 complexes 146–151 as PS for catalytic H2 evolution from water.70 
The photoinduced H2 production of triplet PSs is closely related to the visible light-harvesting (Fig. 47).106152–154 were used as triplet PSs together with the catalyst Co(dmgH)2PyCl and the sacrificial electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA). Complexes 152–154 show different visible light absorption, for example, the ε values at 442 nm are 4330, 5830 and 9370 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Accordingly the H2 production of the complexes within 1 h of irradiation is 18.4 μmol, 23.9 μmol and 32.9 μmol, respectively.

N⁁N⁁N Pt(II) alkynyl complexes as triplet PSs for H2 production.106 

Intramolecular ET will be more efficient than the intermolecular ET. A unique molecular motif was proposed by L. Sun et al. for photocatalytic H2 production (Fig. 48).205,206 The use of [Ru(terpy)2]2+ is due to its geometry which is favourable for the construction of the molecular array. Attachment of the ethynyl moiety to tertpy prolong the excited state lifetime. A long-lived triplet excited state is beneficial for the ET from the Ru(II) center to the active site. The UV/Vis absorptivity of the complex in the visible region is moderate, the ε is ca. 40000 M−1 cm−1 at 510 nm. The luminescence lifetime of the complex was determined as 6.5 ns, which is much longer than the unsubstituted [Ru(terpy)2][PF6]2 (less than 1 ns).206
 Fig. 48  Ru(II) complex covalently linked to the biomimetic iron hydrogenase active site.205,206 
The Pt(II) alkynyl–Fe2S2 active site dyad was used to mimic the [FeFe] hydrogenase subsite (Fig. 49).207 The trident Pt(II) alkynyl coordination center was used as an electron donor. In the proton source (HOAc) and the sacrificial electron donor (MeOH), H2 was produced upon photoexcitation of the complexes, for which the key step is the photoinduced ET from the Pt(II) coordination center to the Fe2S2 active site.207 However, the ε value is small and on the scale of 103 M−1 cm−1 in the range of 390–500 nm. Furthermore, the τT of the trident Pt(II) center is only 519 ns. We envisage that the H2 production can be improved by using a electron donating Pt(II) coordination center that shows strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states. It should be pointed out that the redox potential of the triplet PSs has to be considered for the H2 production.

5.3. TTA Upconversion
TTA upconversion shows advantages over the other upconversion methods, such as those using rare earth materials208–211 and two-photon absorption dyes.212 TTA UC requires a triplet PS to harvest the excitation energy, then via TTET, the T1 state of the triplet acceptor is produced; in turn the S1 state will be populated via TTA.32,33,37,77,169,171,181,213 The photophysical processes involved in TTA upconversion can be summarized in Fig. 50. It is clear that triplet PSs with strong absorption of excitation light and a long-lived triplet excited state are desired.
 Fig. 50  Jablonski Diagram illustrating the mechanism of TTA upconversion. The effects of the light-harvesting and the excited state lifetime of the triplet PSs on the efficiency of the TTA upconversion are shown. E is energy. GS is the ground state (S0). 3MLCT* is the metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer triplet excited state. TTET is triplet–triplet EnT. 3A* is the triplet excited state of the triplet acceptor. 1A* is the singlet excited state of the annihilator. The emission bands observed for the upconversion are the delayed fluorescence from the acceptor. 
Normally the triplet PSs for TTA UC are Ru(dmb)3[PF6]2 and the Pt(II)–Pd(II) porphyrin complexes.32,77 In order to increase the diversity of the triplet PSs for TTA upconversion, we developed a series of complexes that show strong absorptivity in the visible spectral region and long-lived triplet excited states,77 such as Ru(II) complexes,92,100,176 Pt(II) complexes,60b,86,89,90,107–110,214,215 Ir(III) complexes101,177–179 and Re(I) complexes.118 We also prepared iodo-Bodipy triplet PSs and bromo NDI derivatives for TTA upconversion,55,130,131 with which the excitation wavelength can be readily tuned in the range of 450 nm–650 nm.
Recently we used C60–Bodipy dyads as heavy atom-free triplet PSs for TTA upconversion (Fig. 51. The molecular structure of 97 is presented in Fig. 34).51 C60 was used as the intramolecular energy acceptor and the spin converter. The photoexcitation energy harvested by the Bodipy part is transferred to C60. The singlet excited state and in turn the triplet excited state of C60 will be produced, via the intrinsic ISC of C60. We demonstrated that triplet PSs with strong absorption of visible light and a long-lived triplet excited state are beneficial for TTA upconversion. However, the electron-donating antenna in the C60 dyad may facilitate the ET to C60 (a well-known electron acceptor), and the TTA upconversion can be diminished.52,53 This finding is helpful for future design of heavy atom-free triplet PSs that are based on C60 dyads.

TTA upconversion has been successfully used to enhance solar cells,216 photocatalytic H2 production,217 luminescent O2 sensing,218 and luminescent bioimaging.174 We believe that this new upconversion method and its application will flourish in future, for which the design of efficient triplet PSs is one of the crucial aspects.
5.4. Photoredox organic reactions
Recently triplet PSs were used in catalytic photoredox organic reactions,28,219 such as aerobic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic catalyzed by Ru(II) complexes,220 intermolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of cyclopropylamines with olefins catalyzed by Ru(II) complexes,29 C–C bond formation by photocatalytic aerobic oxidation catalyzed by Ru(II) complexes,221 or an organic triplet PS catalyzed aerobic cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions.124 Most of the triplet PSs used in these studies are limited to the normal, unsubstituted model complexes. Generally the absorptivity of these transition metal complexes in the visible region is moderate or weak.28
For example, oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids catalyzed by [Ru(bpy)3Cl2]·6H2O was reported (Fig. 52). The crucial step is the oxidation of amine by the Ru(II) complex at the T1 excited state, in turn the [O2]˙− is produced.220 We envisaged that the bimolecular reaction between the photoexcited catalyst (PS) and the amine is dependent on the T1 state lifetime, as well as the visible light absorbing ability of the triplet PS, therefore the photoreaction may be promoted with Ru(II) complexes that show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited state.35,219,221,222
 Fig. 52  Mechanism of the aerobic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids catalyzed by [Ru(bpy)3Cl2]·6H2O.220 Reproduced with permission from ref. 220. 
Ir(III) complexes were used as triplet PSs for photooxidation.168 The triplet PS is responsible for production of 1O2. However, similar to the normal Ir(III) complexes,15 these photocatalysts show weak absorption in the visible range. The molar extinction coefficients are smaller than 10000 M−1 cm−1 in the region beyond 400 nm.
We used Ir(III) complexes 18 and 19 (Fig. 8) that show strong absorption and a long-lived T1 state for photooxidation of DHN,103 and these new complexes are up to 5-fold more efficient than the model complexes reported in the literature (Fig. 53). We also used an organic triplet PS for this photooxidation, for example, with bromo-NDI derivatives 65−70 (Fig. 22),55 and C60-organic chromophore dyads.49,50 With a C60—styryl-Bodipy dyad, we demonstrated that the photooxidation ability of the heavy atom-free triplet PS are 19-fold more efficient than the normal Ir(III) complexes.49
 Fig. 53  Photooxidation of DHN with Ir(III) complexes 159–164 as triplet PSs.168 
It should be pointed out that fluorescent lamp was sometimes used as the excitation source for photoreactions. However, since the emission spectrum of the typical fluorescent lamp with rare earth phosphor is not continuous in the visible region (which is different from the incandescent lamp or xenon lamp), only part of the emission of the fluorescent lamp can be harvested by the photocatalysts, therefore this practice is not as ‘green’ as it looks.
5.5. Luminescent O2 sensing
Luminescent O2 sensing is important for chemical, biological and environmental science.12,223,224 Phosphorescence transition metal complexes can be used for O2 sensing because the phosphorescence can be quenched by O2.2,225–227 Conventionally the O2 sensing materials are Pt(II)–Pd(II) porphyrin complexes.228 Some of these complexes show strong absorption of visible light and the τP is usually up to a few dozens of μs or even ms. We proved that the O2 sensing can be improved by using transition metal complexes that show long-lived triplet excited states.60,84,85,93,107,206,229 Recently red-light excitable complexes were developed for O2 sensing. These complexes are mainly Pt(II)–Pd(II) complexes.230,231 The phosphorescence lifetimes are up to 286 μs.231
One of the trends in this area is to develop a ratiometric luminescent O2 sensor.91,198,232–237 For this kind of O2 sensors, the sensing material should show fluorescence and phosphorescence dual emission, with the fluorescence band inert to O2, whereas the phosphorescence can be quenched by O2. There are two methods to achieve ratiometric response. One method is to combine a fluorescent dye with a phosphorescent compound, either by mechanical mixing or by linking together the two chromophores by a non-π-conjugation covalent bond.232–234 Another method is to use a compound that shows fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emission.91,198,235
For the ratiometric O2 sensors that are based on two chromophores (fluorophores and phosphors), the following requirements are necessary for observation of dual emission: (1) the fluorescence and phosphorescence bands should exhibit good spectral separation, the singlet EnT from the fluorophore to the phosphor should not be efficient, otherwise the fluorescence will be quenched; (2) reverse triplet EnT from the phosphor to the fluorophore should not occur, otherwise the phosphorescence will be quenched; (3) no ET quenching should occur, otherwise both emission will be diminished; (4) a sufficient intracellular uptake for in vivo application.233
A coumarin-Ir(III) ratiometric O2 sensor was reported (165, Fig. 54).233 The sensor can be excited at 405 nm, where the coumarin 343 part shows much stronger absorptivity than the Ir(III) coordination center, however the singlet excited state of the Ir(III) center can be populated via the singlet EnT from the coumarin 343 to the Ir(III) coordination center. The τP of the BTP moiety is 5.9 μs. The fluorescence cannot be quenched by O2 but the phosphorescence band can be significantly quenched by O2 (Fig. 54). The sensor was used for O2 sensing in living cells.233

(b) Emission spectra of 165 in CH3CN under aerated and Ar-purged conditions (λex = 405 nm) and (c) photo of the emission under different O2 partial pressure.233 The fluorescence is non-sensitive to the presence of O2, whereas the phosphorescence is dependent on the O2 concentration. Thus the emission color will change with varying O2 concentration. Reproduced with permission from ref. 233. 
Similarly a fluorene – Pt(II) porphyrin dual emissive copolymer for ratiometric O2 sensing was reported.234 The fluorescence bands of the fluorene parts overlap with the absorption of Pt(II) porphyrin part, therefore, intramolecular EnT is possible and indeed the authors observed that the fluorescence bands become weaker with increasing contents of the Pt(II) porphyrin part (energy acceptor). The ratiometric O2 sensing was carried out with the emission intensity profile.
Ratiometric O2 sensing can also be achieved by mechanical mixing of a fluorescent dye and a phosphorescent material, such as a Pt(II) porphyrin complex with quantum dots.232,238 or two phosphorescent compounds with different τP.239
It is challenging to design a mono-chromophore dual emissive compound as a ratiometric O2 sensor. In this case the ISC has to be delicately balanced otherwise only fluorescence or phosphorescence can be observed.86,91,235 It is more likely to observe the fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emission given the bulkiness of the ligands is increased (Fig. 55). The fluorescence and the phosphorescence emission of 171 and 172 are at 502/683 nm and 521/692 nm, respectively; furthermore, the heavy atom effect of Ir(III) is more significant than the Pt(II) atoms.91 These findings are useful for design of monochromophore fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emissive compounds.
 Fig. 55  Fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emissive complexes 166–177.91,235 
Inspired by recently reported dual emissive Pt(II) and Ir(III) complexes (Fig. 55),91 we used cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes that give fluorescence–phosphorescence dual emission for ratiometric O2 sensing.235
Besides the above applications, phosphorescent complexes were also used for photoinduced charge separation, for example, with N⁁N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes58,240 and the Ru(II) polyimine coordination center.241–243 Ir(III) complexes were used for photoinduced polymerization.244 Moreover, compounds with triplet states that become populated upon photoexcitation are also useful for optical power limiting and non-linear optics.245–248
6. Conclusion
We summarized the molecular design rationales for triplet photosensitizers to efficiently access the triplet excited states of chromophores, as well as some typical structures of triplet photosensitizers, including transition metal complexes, iodo- or bromo-substituted organic chromophores, and some recently developed heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizers. Applications of the triplet photosensitizers, such as in photosensitization of 1O2, photoredox reactions, luminescent O2 sensing, triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion, and photocatalytic H2 production, were briefly discussed.
It is still a substantial challenge to ‘design’ an efficient triplet photosensitizer, especially those without any heavy atoms because it is difficult to predict the intersystem crossing (ISC) of a chromophore, in particular those without any heavy atoms. The structure–property relationship inferred from the fluorescence is not applicable to the triplet state related paradigm. Furthermore, normally the transition metal complexes show weak absorptivity of visible light and short-lived triplet excited states, which are detrimental for the complexes to be used as triplet PSs.
In order to address these challenges, two methods for preparation of transition metal complexes that show strong absorptivity of visible light are proposed. One is to directly metalate an organic chromophore (organic chromophore as the C- donor for the C–M bond), or establish π-conjugation between the chromophore and the coordination centre; the second is to tether an organic chromophore on the coordination center (without π-conjugation between the two parts, but the two parts should have matching excited state energy levels). The lifetime of the triplet excited state is usually prolonged given the ligands have an appropriate T1 state energy level. The limitations of these methods were also discussed.
The crucial molecular structural design strategy for iodo- or bromo-organic chromophores is to attach the heavy atoms (I or Br) at the π-core of the chromophore to maximize the heavy atom effect, thus to ensure efficient ISC. The limitation is that when the bulkiness of the chromophore increases, the ISC will become less efficient.
Intramolecular spin converters can be used to construct heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers that show predictable ISC. For example, the C60–organic chromophore dyads can be used as general molecular motifs for heavy atom–free organic triplet photosensitizers with C60 as the spin converter. The absorption of these dyads can be easily tuned and the ISC is predictable. Furthermore, energy funneling can be used for preparation of triplet photosensitizers that show panchromatic absorption. Most of the currently available triplet PSs are based on a mono-chromophore profile, which results in only one major absorption band in the visible spectral region.
This review article took a preliminary step toward summarizing the design rationales for triplet photosensitizers and we hope that more chemists will join the exploration of this fascinating area. The study of triplet photosensitizers is crucial for the development of photocatalytic organic reactions, photodynamic therapy (PDT), triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion, as well as for the study of photochemistry and photophysics.
