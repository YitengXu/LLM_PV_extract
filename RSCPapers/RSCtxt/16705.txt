    , Accepted 6th June 2017First published on 8th June 2017AbstractThe insatiable energy demand asks for the maximum conversion of green renewable sources. Herein, we propose the first NIR-assisted glucose/air bio–photoelectrochemical (BPEC) cell comprising a rare earth up-conversion microcrystal (UCMC)-based polyterthiophene (pTTh) cathode. Upon irradiation with a 980 nm laser, UCMCs emit robust luminescence in the visible range, which can efficiently excite pTTh, catalyzing the reduction of oxygen and generating photocurrent. Coupling with a glucose oxidation bioanode, this assembled BPEC cell exhibits a maximal output power density of 40.6 μW cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.53 V. This success is an essential conceptual steppingstone towards the comprehensive utilization of whole sunlight and offers alternative solutions for multiple energy conversions.
Introduction
With the dramatic increase of world energy demand, and the environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion, the exploration and development of efficient renewable energy sources have become crucial. Sunlight energy is the most abundant renewable resource available on earth and the energy delivered to the earth far exceeds the human energy consumption every year.1,2 Until now, more and more attention from both the energy industry and scientific research has been drawn to the efficient capture, conversion and storage of solar energy.1,3,4 Among the applications, photovoltaic devices (i.e. different types of solar cells) could be regarded as the most successful examples.5,6 In addition, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, an integrated system tailoring both light energy conversion and chemical energy conversion, are powerful and encouraging options for light energy utilization as well as promising power output enhancement.7–9 Willner and his colleagues reported integrated photo–bioelectrochemical cells with electrically contacted photosystem II-functionalized photoanodes, generating light-induced electrical power during water–O2–water recycling without any substrate sacrifice.10 Minteer's group employed thylakoid to construct a bioanode for a bio-solar cell, which generated a short circuit photocurrent density of 14.0 ± 1.8 μA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.720 ± 0.018 V.11 We reported an ethanol/air biofuel cell composed of both a visible light excited bioanode and cathode, and cell performances were compared to the reported biofuel cells with a photo-driven single electrode.9 It should be noticed that light harvesting in the present photovoltaic devices concentrates on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light regions,12–17 which accounts only for 53% of the total sunlight spectrum. The same phenomena also happen in photosynthesis processes.18,19 A large portion of energy, mainly near infrared (NIR) and infrared light (IR) at longer wavelengths, would be lost as heat due to the spectral mismatch between the incident solar spectrum and the spectral response of solar cells.20 Hitherto only a few research studies have attempted to integrate NIR light into solar cells, including crystalline silicon solar cells,21 organic solar cells22 and dye-sensitized solar cells,23–25 but few reports on photoelectrochemical cells which utilise NIR are available. Thus, it should be vigorously pursued.26,27
To improve light-harvesting in the NIR region, rare earth up-conversion nanomaterials are ideal alternatives, which convert two sub-bandgap, lower-energy photons into one above-bandgap, higher-energy photon.25,28 Doping of rare-earth materials into photovoltaic devices results in a better absorption of the long wavelength light in the solar spectrum, thus enhancing the performance of solar cells. Among these up-conversion nanomaterials, rare earth fluorides (like NaYF4) are investigated as a class of excellent host lattices due to their high refractive index, low phonon energy and adequate thermal and chemical stabilities,27,29,30 and hexagonal β-NaYF4 is reported to be better than the cubic α-NaYF4 because of the properties of luminescence,31,32 which would be beneficial for the light utilization efficiency in photoelectrochemical devices.
In the present work, a novel NIR-assisted BPEC cell has been successfully established by an elaborate configuration design (Scheme 1A). A specific composition of up-conversion microcrystals (UCMCs, β-NaYF4, 20% Yb3+, 2.0% Tm3+, 0.2% Er3+) synthesized by a hydrothermal method was employed in the fabrication of a polyterthiophene (pTTh)-based cathode. As shown in Scheme 1B, UCMCs absorb the near-infrared part (>800 nm) of the solar spectrum, and emit visible light (<750 nm).25,28 Since the visible emission matches well with the absorption spectrum of pTTh, a p-type organic semiconductor, pTTh is excited and accordingly catalyzes the cathodic oxygen reduction. At the bioanode, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) has been immobilized onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the oxidation of glucose. This NIR-assisted BPEC cell represents an essential concept toward the utilization of the whole spectrum of solar light and expands our knowledge of solar electrochemical cells.

Experimental section
Materials
Rare earth oxides (99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China) and rare earth chloride stock solutions of 0.4 M were prepared by dissolving the corresponding metal oxides in hot hydrochloric acid. 2,2′,5′,2′′-Terthiophene (TTh) and NAD+ were obtained from J&K Scientific Ltd. The single-sided indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass (30–60 Ω cm−2) was purchased from Nanbo Display Technology Co., Ltd, China. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Pseudomonas sp. (E.C.1.1.1.47, 235.3 U mg−1) and chitosan were bought from Sigma. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 95%, 20–50 nm, Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co. Ltd) were treated with a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 (v/v, 1:3). Glucose stock solution was left at room temperature for 24 h to mutarotate before use. 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.0) was used as the supporting electrolyte. All of the other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corporation and used without further purification. Millipore Milli-Q water was used throughout unless otherwise stated and all of the experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C).
Synthesis of UCMCs
UCMCs (β-NaYF4, 20% Yb3+, 2.0% Tm3+, 0.2% Er3+) were synthesized according to the literature30,33 with a little modification: the concentrations of each of the rare earth chloride stock solutions, consisting of 0.4 M. 1.945 mL YCl3, 500 μL YbCl3, 50 μL TmCl3 and 5 μL ErCl3 solutions, were added into 2.5 mL ultrapure water and stirred for 10 min, followed by the dropwise addition of 10 mL sodium citrate solution (1 M) in order to form a metal-citrate complex. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, 20 mL aqueous solution containing 0.5 g sodium fluoride was added to the above homogeneous solution and continuously stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, the mixture solution was adjusted to be acidic (pH = 3) by the addition of 1 M HCl and then transferred into a Teflon liner in a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 2 h. The obtained white precipitate was centrifuged, washed with ultrapure water several times, and vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight, noted as UCMCs. Morphology and structure characterization was performed using an XL30 ESEM field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Low-to-high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a D8 Advance (Germany) with Cu K (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The up-conversion luminescence spectra were recorded on an F-4500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Co., Japan) equipped with an external CW NIR laser excitation source (λ = 980 nm, BWT Beijing, China).
Preparation of the NIR-activated cathode
TTh was first electropolymerized onto clean ITO electrodes by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile solution containing 40 mM TTh and 0.1 M LiClO4. Perforated scotch tape was used to control the electrode diameter at 4 mm. The applied potential was scanned between −0.2 V and 1.1 V for 20 cycles with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Afterwards, the electrode was thoroughly rinsed with acetonitrile and ultrapure water successively and allowed to dry under nitrogen. The obtained electrode was denoted as the pTTh/ITO electrode. UV/Vis absorption measurements of pTTh were performed on a Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrometer (Varian). UCMCs were ultrasonically dispersed in ultrapure water to form a 5 mg mL−1 colloid solution, and 20 μL of the dispersion followed by 3 μL Nafion (0.2%) were spread onto the pTTh/ITO electrode. The naturally dried electrode was denoted as the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode (i.e. NIR-activated cathode).
Preparation of the GDH/CNT bioanode
The acid-treated CNTs were ultrasonically dispersed in ultrapure water to form a 1 mg mL−1 colloid solution, and 10 μL of the dispersion was spread onto the ITO electrode (perforated scotch tape was used to control the electrode diameter at 2 mm). After that, the electrode was covered with 5 μL of GDH solution (1 mg mL−1 dissolved in 10 mM PBS containing 1% chitosan). By evaporation of the solvent at 4 °C overnight, the bioanode (i.e., GDH/CNT/ITO electrode) was obtained.
Electrocatalysis evaluation and NIR-assisted BPEC assembly
Before the NIR-assisted BPEC cell assembly, the photoelectrocatalysis at the cathode and bioelectrocatalysis at the anode were studied in detail. The electrochemical measurements were carried out at an electrochemical workstation CHI 832B (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corporation, China) with a conventional three-electrode cell comprising modified ITO as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. For the photoelectrocatalytic measurements, the NIR laser equipped with a wide aperture beam expander (collimating mirror, d = 5 ± 0.2 mm) was used as the light source.
A homemade PMMA photoelectrochemical flow cell setup was applied for the cell assembly and measurements. The bioanode and the NIR-activated cathode were placed clinging to the adjacent inner walls vertically, and the 980 nm NIR laser source was placed with the light beam striking the cathode as efficiently as possible. A recycling electrolyte flowing system equipped with an external cooling unit was employed to avoid the NIR thermal effect. The same flowing rates at the inlet and outlet were manipulated to keep the electrolyte volume constant. 30 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing 10 mM NAD+ and 30 mM glucose under an air-saturated atmosphere was used as the biofuel solution. As the control, the present NIR-assisted BPEC cells with the pTTh/ITO electrode or UCMC/ITO electrode as the cathode, without NIR light irradiation or without glucose as the fuel supply, were also tested. The output power density of each BPEC cell was normalized according to the anodic geometric area.
Results and discussion
Hydrothermal treatment as a typical solution approach has proven to be an effective and convenient process in the preparation of various inorganic materials with a variety of controllable morphologies and architectures. Up-conversion nanomaterials, especially NaYF4 inorganic luminescent materials with various morphologies have been successfully prepared by employing this method, with which structures of a large size are easier to form due to the highly anisotropic nature of the crystal phase.26,34 Compared to the commonly-used thermal decomposition under drastic experimental conditions (i.e., oil phase, high temperature above 300 °C, toxic gas emission and complicated procedures),35,36 this accessible hydrothermal method ensures the good hydrophilicity and water-dispersibility of the synthesized microcrystals, and their photoluminescence efficiency is also comparable to the ones synthesized in organic solvents. Even in the solid state, the UCMCs exhibit intensive photoluminescence upon the excitation of the NIR laser. Fig. 1A shows the SEM image of the prepared UCMCs, highly uniform, monodispersed, and hexagonal prismatic microstructures, which could be observed clearly. It is clear, from both the SEM image and TEM image (Fig. 1B), that the prismatic crystals possess the concave ends with the average diameter of 200∼300 nm and the length ranging several micrometers. Since it is a crystal-growth process during the hydrothermal treatment, the presence of the concave ends is assumed to be the result of the faster growth rate of the prismatic side facets than that of the top/bottom facets.37 High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization (inset of Fig. 1B) reveals that the UCMCs are of single crystalline nature. The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.297 nm correspond to the (110) facet of hexagonal β-NaYF4.38 Typical XRD patterns (Fig. 1C) show that all the reflection peaks, including the positions and intensities, can be readily indexed as the pure hexagonal crystalline phase β-NaYbF4 (JCPDS 16-0334), in accordance with the HRTEM characterization results. It should be mentioned that high crystallinity usually results in stronger luminescence.39Fig. 1D displays the up-conversion luminescence spectrum of UCMCs. Sensitized by Yb3+ ions and activated by Tm3+/Er3+ ions, these UCMCs emit an overall blue-green luminescence (the inset photograph in Fig. 1D) with the six emission peaks at 407 nm, 450 nm, 475 nm, 521 nm, 539 nm and 652 nm, respectively, upon the excitation of a 980 nm NIR laser, suggesting the effective doping of Yb3+, Tm3+ and Er3+ into the host lattices of β-NaYF4. As indicated in Scheme 1B, the blue emission (peaks at 450 and 475 nm) is caused by the transitions of 1D2 to 3F4 and 1G4 to 3H6 of Tm3+ doping,40 while the other four peaks (407 nm, 521 nm, 539 nm and 652 nm) are assigned to the transitions from the energy levels of 4H9/2, 4H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ doping, respectively.41 Among them, the peaks at 521 nm and 539 nm are mainly attributed to the green emission. The relative peak intensities could be fine-tuned by precisely manipulating the ratio of dopants in host lattices. Because the NIR-activated electrocatalysis at the cathode would depend predominantly on the photoelectrocatalytic activity of pTTh, the ratio of the dopants was optimized as NaYF4, 20% Yb3+, 2.0% Tm3+, and 0.2% Er3+ in order to give the maximum visible emission overlapping the absorbance of pTTh (discussed in the following section).

It has been reported that pTTh is able to serve as a high-efficiency cathodic catalyst for oxygen reduction upon visible light illumination in our previous work.8 However, it is unable to absorb light beyond the visible light region (i.e., NIR or IR region). Therefore, the introduction of UCMCs into the pTTh/ITO electrode is studied. From the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2A), it is clearly observed that pTTh keeps its rough facial morphology and also maintains the hexagonal prismatic structure of UCMCs, even though the layers look disorganized. These disordered structures may enhance the light reflection and refraction and thereby improve the light utilization efficiency. Moreover, the dense contact and even the tight insertion of UCMCs into pTTh facilitate the sufficient energy or electron transfer.

To investigate energy transfer between UCMCs and pTTh, the up-conversion emission spectra of UCMCs on the ITO electrode were measured before and after pTTh modification, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, upon excitation by the 980 nm Laser, UCMCs on the ITO electrode exhibit their typical blue-green emission (curve a) similar to the photoluminescence in the aqueous dispersion state. With the introduction of the underlying deposited pTTh, a dramatic intensity decrease of the four peaks (i.e., at 450 nm, 475 nm, 521 nm and 539 nm, curve b) was observed because of the strong absorption of pTTh between 400 nm and 600 nm (curve c), suggesting the high utilization efficiency of up-conversion fluorescence. In addition, the digital photographs (g to i) upon NIR irradiation also well demonstrate this result. Totally different from the bright blue-green emission of pristine UCMCs (g), the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode exhibits yellow emission, which we reasoned as the summed effect of the decreased blue and green emission and the remaining red emission (at 650 nm). As the catalytic activity of pTTh towards oxygen reduction is dependent heavily on visible light excitation, such a prominent light energy transfer from UCMCs to pTTh suggests the possibility to activate the photoelectrocatalytic activity of pTTh.
Linear sweep voltammetric experiments were carried out to evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode towards oxygen reduction. Fig. 3 displays the catalytic behaviours of the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode as well as the pTTh/ITO electrode under the normal circumstances and upon NIR laser irradiation. For the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode upon 980 nm laser irradiation, the cathodic catalysis commences from 0.43 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the catalytic current reaches 156 μA cm−2 at −0.1 V (curve b), and without NIR laser irradiation, no obvious catalytic current can be observed. This could be considered as the successful fabrication of the NIR-activated cathode as well as its availability in PEC cells. As a comparison, in the pTTh/ITO electrode without UCMC coverage, much lower catalytic current (ca. 88.5% decline) at −0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is obtained (curve d). Such a considerable difference between the UCMC/pTTh/ITO electrode and pTTh/ITO electrode suggests: (1) pTTh is relatively inert towards the NIR laser; (2) efficient coupling occurs between pTTh and UCMCs, which results from the good overlap between the absorption of pTTh and the up-conversion fluorescence emission of UCMCs; and (3) upon visible light derived from the up-conversion effect of UCMCs, pTTh is excited to induce charge separation and thereby exhibits excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity.

At the bioanode, GDH/CNTs is employed for the bioelectrocatalytic glucose oxidation. In general, redox mediators, usually electroactive small molecules or polymers, are requested to mediate GDH-related glucose electro-oxidation and accelerate the electron communication between GDH and electrode substrate. Herein, it should be noticed that the electrode fabrication is free from the redox mediators. The electrocatalysis responding to glucose oxidation occurs at as low as −0.09 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, Fig. 4), which is comparable to the value with respect to many mediated-bioelectrocatalyses. The catalytic current density increases with the increase of glucose concentration and achieves 315 μA cm−2 (0.3 V) at 30 mM glucose, demonstrating that a highly-desired direct electron transfer between GDH and the electrode substrate has been promoted via this simple bioanode structure without the relay of redox mediators. This is presumably due to the high specific activity of GDH as well as the enhanced electron transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic activity of CNTs.
 Fig. 4  The polarization curves of glucose oxidation obtained at the GDH/CNT/ITO anode in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing 0 (a), 15 mM (b), and 30 mM (c) glucose and 10 mM NAD+. Scan rate is 1 mV s−1. 
The NIR-activated cathode and the bioanode were coupled into a home-made polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) photoelectrochemical flow cell. As shown in the scheme (Fig. 5A) as well the setup photograph (Fig. 5B), the NIR-activated cathode was placed against the internal wall of the cubic cell, so that the 980 nm NIR laser beam could hit at the electrode vertically with the minimum light energy loss. The bioanode was positioned against the adjacent wall of the cubic cell to avoid the influence of NIR laser irradiation. That means the crossover effect of the NIR laser on anodic bioelectrocatalysis could be eliminated definitely. Moreover, it has been well investigated in our previous work8 that the existence of glucose didn't affect the cathodic photoelectrocatalytic activity of pTTh. Therefore, it proves to be feasible to establish a one-chamber PEC cell without the additional separation by any supplementary membrane. As the photothermal effect is inevitable by using the NIR laser, which usually gives rise to the increase of solution temperature, changes the reaction kinetics, and even deactivates or kills the biological organisms (i.e. cells and enzymes), an external cooling unit was introduced into the circular flowing system. 30 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing 10 mM NAD+ and 30 mM glucose under an air-saturated atmosphere is used as the biofuel solution. The heated biofuel solution is pumped out and cooled using the cooling layer. Then the cooled biofuel solution was re-pumped into the cell. Relatively slow but the same flowing rates at the inlet and outlet were manipulated to keep the biofuel solution volume constant.
 Fig. 5  Schematic illustration (A) and photograph (B) of the NIR-assisted PEC cell configuration; (C) the photograph of the working cathode activated by the 980 nm laser. 
The detailed principle of this NIR-assisted BPEC cell operation is illustrated as follows: glucose is oxidized by GDH and gives electrons to the electrode, CNT/ITO in the presence of NAD+, and the electrons pass through the external circuit and migrate to the cathode. At the cathode, UCMCs are excited by the 980 nm laser and emit visible light with a wavelength of at 407 nm, 450 nm, 475 nm, 521 nm, 539 nm and 650 nm. Since the absorption of pTTh ranges from 400 nm to 600 nm, it is excited to induce charge separation by absorbing most of the emission of UCMCs (450 nm, 475 nm, 521 nm and 539 nm). The photo-excited electrons reduce oxygen, while the holes in the valence band accept the electrons from the external circuit and finally return to the ground state. In this process, NIR excitation is of crucial importance, otherwise, UCMCs would not up-convert visible light emission, and all the subsequent reactions would be interrupted.
The power output and cell voltage as a function of current density is shown in Fig. 6A. Upon NIR laser illumination (16.4 mW cm−2, the photograph in Fig. 5C), the assembled BPEC cell yields a maximum output power density (Pmax) of 40.6 μW cm−2 at 0.35 V in air-saturated PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing 30 mM glucose and 10 mM NAD+, and achieves an open circuit potential of 0.53 V, which is close to the difference between the anodic (−0.09 V) and the cathodic (0.43 V) onset potential. It is noteworthy that the obtained Pmax is still higher than the reported value in different kinds of visible-light PEC cells even though under NIR irradiation.10,11 Apparently, because this BPEC cell is potentially visible-light responsive attributed to pTTh, the power output is able to gain further enhancement if the whole spectrum was applied. Additionally, the long-term storage stability has been investigated by testing the power output of the NIR-assisted glucose/air BPEC cell every five days. As shown in Fig. 6B, there is no obvious decrease in the first 10 days and the power output still retains 80% after 30 days of storage, suggesting the sufficient stability and robust construction of this NIR-assisted glucose/air BPEC cell. The successful operation of this NIR-assisted BPEC cell proves the feasibility to establish a NIR-assisted electricity generation device and indicates a proof of concept to utilize efficiently the NIR region of the whole solar spectrum.

In order to interpret the NIR-assisted BPEC cell more comprehensively, several control NIR-assisted BPEC cells have also been assembled and tested. The power outputs and cell voltages as a function of current densities are plotted in Fig. 7. In each case (pTTh cathode, UCMC cathode, NIR laser absence or biofuel absence), the output power density never exceeds 4 μW cm−2, suggesting the performance failure of BPEC cells. In addition to the fact that the inertness of pTTh towards NIR light and the poor electrochemical activity of UCMCs are validated, it is definitely difficult for this BPEC cell to output electricity without NIR activation or without a biofuel, glucose. Moreover, one should keep in mind that the present power output value and the photo-to-electricity conversion efficiency (ca. 0.25%) are not sufficient enough for practical application, and herein, we would like to propose several points for further optimization as follows: (1) water adsorption should be alleviated by using laser sources with an appropriate wavelength away from the water adsorption region; (2) because of the sharp instead of wide fluorescence emission peaks, the percentage of overlap between the absorption of pTTh and the fluorescence emission of UCMCs cannot reach 100%, even though it is already the optimized results. Thus, it is of crucial importance to change/add the doped rare earth metal ions to obtain higher fractions of overlap and thereby activate the photoelectrocatalyst more efficiently; (3) as the apparent charge recombination in pTTh is still severe, which can be deduced from its low photoelectrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction, modifying pTTh appropriately and/or synthesizing directionally pTTh derivatives with lower charge recombination are also good options.

Conclusions
In this work, UCMCs with a precise ratio of doped rare earth metal ions have been synthesized and applied in the fabrication of a NIR-activated cathode with the assistance of a photoelectrocatalyst, pTTh. Attributed to the good overlap between the absorption of pTTh and the fluorescence emission of UCMCs, the cathode exhibits good catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction upon NIR laser irradiation. On this basis, a novel NIR-assisted glucose/air BPEC cell has been established with a maximum output power density of 40.6 μW cm−2 and an open circuit potential of 0.53 V. Considering that this is the first example of employing NIR light for electricity generation, this work can be regarded as a successful proof-of-concept trial. It predicts the possible utilization of the whole solar spectrum, and provides alternative avenues for multiple energy conversions in photoelectrochemical cells. To achieve their practical applications, further optimization and reformation are on the way.
