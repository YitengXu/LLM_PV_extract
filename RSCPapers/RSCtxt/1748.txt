    , Accepted 10th October 2018First published on 11th October 2018AbstractMetal sulfides have attracted considerable interest owing to their notable electrochemical properties and multiple application areas, such as solar cells and supercapacitors (SCs). This paper describes the design and synthesis of nickel foams decorated with different metal sulfides, such as CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF electrodes for SCs. The FeS/NF coral reef-like nanostructure exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance in SCs with a high specific capacitance (2007.61 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), good cycling stability (only 3% loss after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1), excellent rate capability (52.27% capacity retention at 20 A g−1), and higher energy density (54.88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1) compared to other electrodes. The elevated performance of the FeS/NF was attributed mainly to the coral reef-like nanostructure with a relatively high specific surface area, which offers a large interfacial area between the electrode and electrolyte and sufficient physical cavities for rapid ionic diffusion. These results suggest that the coral reef nanostructure can be used not only in large energy density applications, but also in large power density fields, such as energy storage devices, flexible electronics, and electric vehicles.
1. Introduction
Research related to energy storage, production and distribution is vital due to the rapid consumption of nonrenewable energy resources. Supercapacitors (SCs) are one of the most ideal device-candidates for green energy storage because of their high power density, excellent reversibility, long cycle life, stability, safety and environmental friendliness.1–3 Benefitting from all these noticeable advantages, SCs have many applications, such as in aviation, electronics, transportation, and communication. Moreover, extremely high capacity energy storage devices are also needed due to the rapid development of hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronics, and implantable biomedical devices.4 SCs are categorized mainly into three groups: electric double layer capacitors, which store charge at the surface or sub-surface regions of electrodes through electrostatic adsorption; pseudocapacitors (the redox reactions take place at the surface of the electroactive material); and hybrid electrochemical capacitors.5–7 On the other hand, SCs suffer from a relatively lower energy density (∼10 W h kg−1) than batteries (∼100 W h kg−1), which limit their practical applications.8 In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to solve this problem by extending the cell voltage window, enhancing the specific capacitance, and improving the electrochemical performance of SCs by synthesizing nanostructured electrode materials.
Until now, conducting polymers, carbon-based materials, and transition metal oxides/hydroxides have been studied intensively as efficient electrode materials for SCs and quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Transition metal oxides, including MnO2 and RuO2, are the most promising electrode materials for SCs owing to their remarkably high specific capacitance (theoretical value of ∼1370 F g−1 for MnO2 and 1500–2200 F g−1 for RuO2), reversible charge–discharge features, wide potential window, and good electrical conductivity of ∼105 S cm−1 for RuO2.2,8,9 On the other hand, the poor electronic conductivity (10−5–10−6 S cm−1) and low rate performance of MnO2 and the high processing and material costs of RuO2 ($30–$70 per g for RuCl3·xH2O and $50–$80 per g for RuO2 nanoparticles) electrode materials seriously restrict their practical applications.2 The major disadvantages include the following: the low electrical conductivity of transition metal oxides, which increases the overall resistance of the device; the poor cycling stability of conducting polymers; low specific capacitance of carbon-based materials; the difficult synthesis of transition metal nitrides due to the formation of NN bonds; and the instability in air and humid atmosphere.10–12 Nevertheless, it is essential to synthesize other efficient electrode materials with desirable electrochemical properties, such as good electrochemical stability, porous structure, and high electrical conductivity to further enhance the performance of SCs. Commonly, platinum (Pt) is a widely used CE material in traditional DSSCs.13 On the other hand, the use of a Pt CE in conjunction with a polysulfide redox electrolyte is inappropriate in QDSSCs owing to the suppression of electrical conductivity and surface activity of Pt CE caused by the chemisorption of sulfur ions in the redox electrolyte as well as CO or HCO species, leading to the rapid loss of electrocatalytic activity.14,15 Moreover, the limited availability and very high price of Pt limit its further commercialization.
In recent years, transition metal sulfides (TMS) have attracted increasing attention as electrode materials owing to their unique electrochemical properties, low cost, abundance, stress-free production, and high theoretical capacities, making them potential substitutes for noble metals in a range of fields with high effectiveness.15,16 The structure, profile, and particle size of the TMS have an important effect on the electrocatalytic applications and catalytic performance of metals. The larger surface area of these materials enhances the catalytic reaction rate in DSSCs and QDSSCs. These TMS electrode materials exhibit higher conductivity than that of TMO because of their narrow band gap and the faradic reaction being involved in the charge–discharge process.17,18 In particular, the electrochemical activity of TMS is higher than that of TMO due to the substitution of oxygen with sulfur atoms, which possess higher ionic conductivity.19 In addition, TMS have greater ionic diffusivity due to their higher anionic polarizability, which arises from the larger size of S2− ions. Among the TMS investigated, cobalt sulfide (CoS), copper sulfide (CuS), iron sulfide (FeS), and nickel sulfide (NiS) are important multifunctional semiconductors with potential applications in solar energy devices, lithium ion batteries, and gas sensors because of their high activity.20 For example, many researchers have used these materials as a cathode material in the counter electrodes of QDSSCs owing to their promising redox reaction with the polysulfide redox electrolyte and as rechargeable batteries with high charge/discharge stability for up to 1000 cycles.19,20
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been very few studies on the application of these TMS in SCs. Wei Li et al. utilized single-crystal β-NiS nanorod arrays with a hollow structured Ni3S2 framework as an electrode, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 1158 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 in a three electrode cell.10 Ke-Jing et al. performed the one-step solvothermal synthesis of CuS nanosheets with different morphologies and reported a specific capacitance of 833.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a KOH solution.21 Runsheng Gao et al. prepared amorphous nickel sulfide@CoS double-shelled polyhedral nanocages with a specific capacitance of 2291 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous solution.18 Liyuan Pei et al. synthesized a self-assembled a flower-like FeS2/graphene aerogel composite that exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 313.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which is almost twice that of bare FeS2 (163.5 F g−1).22
In the present study, novel hierarchical structures of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF were fabricated using a facile hydrothermal approach, as shown in Scheme 1. The effects of the deposition time, temperature, reagent, and sulfide source were examined. The formation of a hierarchical structure of FeS/NF and NiS/NF gives rise to better electrical conductivity, faster electrolyte diffusion, and rapid electron pathways compared to that of CoS/NF and CuS/NF. The as-fabricated CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF electrodes exhibited several desirable electrochemical features for SCs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no reports on the use of the different metal sulfide electrodes with the same procedure for energy storage and conversion.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF and NiS/NF hierarchical structures
Prior to synthesis, the nickel foam (NF) was etched carefully with a concentrated HCl solution (37 wt%) by sonication for 10 min and then cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol and deionized water (DI) for 10 min each. In a typical synthesis procedure of CoS, a solution with a concentration of 0.1 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.4 M thiourea in DI water (40.0 mL) was prepared. Subsequently, a 0.7 M acetic acid solution was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for about 30 min. The thoroughly mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 160 °C for 6 h and then cooled naturally to room-temperature. The CoS powder was collected, washed several times with ethanol and DI water and dried at 100 °C for 10 h. The working electrode was fabricated by mixing the CoS material, binder PTFE (poly-tetrafluoroethylene), and acetylene black with weight ratios of 80:5:15; coating on a piece of NF (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm); and pressing it to a thin foil at a pressure of 5.0 MPa. For comparison, CuS/NF, FeS/NF and NiS/NF thin films were also fabricated with the same experimental procedure using different metal sources, such as Cu(NO3)2·3H2O for CuS/NF, FeSO4·7H2O for FeS/NF, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O for NiS/NF, and dried at the same temperature and time.
2.2 Characterization
The TMS on nickel foam were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi: SU-70) at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to identify the phase, crystallinity, and composition of the material, respectively. Symmetrical configuration cells were used for the Tafel polarization measurements under dark conditions using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France). The detailed fabrication of the cells is reported elsewhere. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the QDSSCs were investigated under one-sun illumination using an ABET technologies apparatus (USA, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements and calculation
The electrochemical tests were conducted at room temperature in a conventional three-electrode system in a 2 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte, where the as-prepared TMS on nickel foam (CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF), Pt wire, and Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The weight of the active material was calculated using a microbalance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg and ranged from 5 to 5.5 mg cm−2 for all electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques were conducted using a SP-150 BioLogic science instrument to observe the capacitance. The specific capacitance, and the energy and power densities of the electrode were calculated from the GCD curves using the following formulas. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying an AC voltage of 5.0 mV over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at the open circuit potential. (1) (2) (3)where Cs is the specific capacitance (F g−1); i is the discharge current (mA); m is the mass of the electrode (mg); ΔV is the voltage window during the discharge process (V); Δt is the discharge time difference (s); E is the energy density (W h g−1 or W h cm−2 or W h cm−3); and P is the power density (W g−1 or W cm−2 or W cm−3).
3. Result and discussion
XPS was carried out to examine the surface composition and chemical states of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF, as shown in Fig. 1a–d. The survey spectrum of CoS/NF (Fig. 1a) showed seven elements, S2p, Cl2p, C1s, N1s, O1s, Co2p3, and Ni2p3 at 161.79, 198.13, 284.6, 399.87, 531.37, 780.76, and 855.81 eV, respectively, which concur with the elemental composition of CoS/NF. Similarly, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF showed six (Na1s, Cu2p3, Ni2p3, O1s, C1s, and S2p at 1071.88, 933.91, 856.36, 531.51, 284.6, and 162.67 eV), four (Fe2p3, O1s, C1s, and S2p at 707.61, 531.76, 284.6, and 162.6 eV), and five (Na1s, Ni2p3, O1s, C1s, and S2p at 1072.03, 856.3, 531.41, and 168.26 eV) peaks, respectively. In the high-resolution spectrum of Co2p (Fig. 2a), the sharp peaks at 780.97 and 998.49 eV were assigned to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 in CoS/NF and the spin–orbital splitting was 17.52 eV.23,24 In the case of CuS/NF (Fig. 2b), two main peaks separated by 19.86 eV at 933.91 eV and 953.77 eV were assigned to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively.25Fig. 2c shows the two main peaks of Fe2p at 707.7 eV and 720.46 eV, which were assigned to Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2, respectively.26 The spectrum of Ni2p (Fig. 2d) displayed the composition information and consisted of two spin orbit doublets at binding energies of 856.27 and 873.1 eV, which correspond well to Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2.27

HR-SEM was used to examine the structure of the CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF and NiS/NF electrodes. Fig. 3a, a1 and a2 present a typical HR-SEM image of CoS/NF taken at different magnifications, indicating that the film has a worm-like nanostructure covering non-uniformly the entire nickel foam substrate. Fig. 3b shows the particle size and typical morphology of the as-synthesized CuS/NF electrode. The CuS/NF micro/nanostructure exhibited sand-like nanostructures and displayed many unwanted particles with a scissor-cut-like surface with many micro/nanogaps, which led to a decrease in charge transport and electronic conductivity compared to those of the other electrodes.28Fig. 3c, c1 and c2 present a HR-SEM image of FeS/NF, which shows that the FeS nanoparticles decorated the nickel foam surface uniformly and the electrode exhibited a coral reef-like nanostructure. The uniformly decorated FeS resulted in an increase in the number of reactive sites for the reaction. This resulted in improved electronic conductivity between the substrate and FeS sample, and facilitated electrolyte access into the electrode, yielding more defects and an improvement of the charge transport process that should enhance the capacitance compared to that of the CoS/NF, CuS/NF and NiS/NF electrodes.29Fig. 3d–d2 show low and high magnification images of the NiS/NF electrode. The images show that the film consists of a densely packed group of Brussels sprout-like formations in a cauliflower-like nanostructure with a large surface area; each Brussels sprout was ∼200–500 nm in size. These results confirm that a change of the metal source can critically affect the surface morphology of the micro/nanostructure.

TEM was carried out to examine the surface morphology further, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4c presents a TEM image of FeS/NF showing that the electrode is composed of many coral reef-like nanorods of FeS decorating the nickel foam substrate. This unique structure is favorable for electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer, which promotes the electrochemical activity of FeS/NF. Fig. 4a, a1, b, b1 and d, d1 show TEM images of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, and NiS/NF, respectively. The electrodes contained uniform nanoparticles, which is in good agreement with the FE-SEM images.

3.1 Electrochemical characteristics
Electrochemical properties of the electrodes, such as CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF, were examined by CV, GCD, and EIS in a three-electrode system. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the different electrode materials at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1 over the potential range of −0.4 to 0.8 V. All CV curves showed a pair of redox peaks, confirming the pseudocapactive behavior that may have originated from the faradic redox processes of Ni2+/Ni3+, and Co2+ transitions associated with OH−. At 30 mV s−1, FeS/NF (444.05 mA, −378.71 mA) exhibited a larger integral area with higher oxidation and reduction currents than that of CoS/NF (123.99 mA, −107.17 mA), CuS/NF (218.83 mA, −183.84 mA) and NiS/NF (365.71 mA, −326.63 mA). This may be due to the uniform coral reef-like nanostructure on nickel foam, which is conducive to the penetration of the KOH electrolyte into the electrode that promotes charge and electron transfer. Fig. 5c (CoS/NF), Fig. 5d (CuS/NF), Fig. 5e (FeS/NF) and Fig. 5f (NiS/NF) present the CV curves at various scan rates, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90 and 100 mV s−1. The shapes of the FeS/NF and NiS/NF curves show a slight distortion and the current response increases with increasing scanning rate, showing that the unique structures of the as-prepared FeS/NF with a coral reef-like nanostructure and NiS/NF with a group of Brussels sprout-like formations with a cauliflower-like nanostructure are beneficial to greater charge separation and electron transport.30,31 Furthermore, the anodic and cathodic peaks shifted towards higher and lower potential sides with increasing scan rates, revealing the higher power character and better electrochemical reversibility of the resulting electrodes.32

Fig. 6a presents the GCD curves of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF over the potential range of 0.45 to 0 V at a current density of 2.0 A g−1. The FeS/NF curve has no obvious IR drops compared to the other three electrodes, illustrating excellent capacitive reversibility. For any type of electrode material, low internal resistance is an essential property for high-performance SCs and solar cells.33 The FeS/NF and NiS/NF is predicted to have low charge transfer resistance because the band gap affects the electron transfer efficiency. FeS and NiS have lower band gaps (0.95 eV for FeS and 0.5 eV for NiS) than those of CoS (1.6 eV) and CuS (2.1 eV).34–36 The FeS/NF electrode showed a higher specific capacitance of 2007.61 F g−1 compared to 395.85 F g−1 for CoS/NF, 718.48 F g−1 for CuS/NF, and 1298.66 F g−1 for NiS/NF, owing to its greater surface morphology and electron transfer efficiency. Fig. 6b (CoS/NF), Fig. 6c (CuS/NF), Fig. 6d (FeS/NF), and Fig. 6e (NiS/NF) show the variation of the specific capacitance of different electrode materials with various current densities; the values are displayed in Table 1. The FeS/NF electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 2007.61, 1940.98, 1924.8, 1599.64, 1463.33, 1456.53, 1322.84, 1185.77, and 1074.8 F g−1 at current densities of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance reached a maximum of 2007.61 F g−1 and 1298.66 F g−1 for FeS/NF and NiS/NF, respectively, at 2.0 A g−1. In contrast to the reported iron sulfide and nickel sulfide-based electrodes, including Ni3S2@β-NiS material (1158 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), NiS hollow spheres (927 F g−1 at 4.08 A g−1), NiS (1076 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), NiS/rGO nanocomposites (715.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1), NiCo2S2 nanoparticles (972 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), NiS2 nanotubes (695 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1), GA–FeS2 aerogel composite (313.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), Cu-doped FeS2 (866 mA h g−1 at 90 mA g−1), and FexSy/C composite (274.68 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1), the coral reef-like nanostructure of FeS/NF and the Brussels sprout-like nanostructure of the NiS/NF electrodes in this study showed much better performance without any other dopants, additives or conductive materials.37–45 The electrode fabricated using FeS/NF also exhibited excellent rate performance as its capacitance decreased 52.27% with increasing current density from 2 to 20 A g−1. The extremely good rate performance can be attributed to the uniform coral reef-like nanostructure of the FeS/NF electrode, which may reduce the pathways for rapid and efficient ion transport.

The EIS spectra of the four as-prepared electrodes were analyzed at the open-circuit potential to study the resistive and capacitive behaviors over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an AC perturbation of 5 mV. The EIS curves in Fig. 7a exhibited a semicircle and a steep linear curve at the high and low-frequency regions, respectively; the former represents almost ideal capacitive performance and the latter indicates charge transfer resistance (Rct). From the spectrum, at the low frequency region, Rct, which is used to characterize the redox reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface, was calculated to be 2.00 Ω for CoS/NF, 1.95 Ω for CuS/NF, 1.00 Ω for FeS/NF and 1.20 Ω for NiS/NF. In contrast, at the low frequency region, ionic diffusion of FeS/NF and NiS/NF was greater than those of CoS/NF and CuS/NF. This shows that the FeS/NF and NiS/NF electrodes are faster, which resulted from their higher electronic conductivities and are beneficial for the ion and electron transfer rate.46

A Ragone plot is a chart used for a performance comparison of various energy storage devices and these parameters (energy and power density) are important for evaluating the performance of SCs. The energy and power densities were calculated using the GCD data attained at various current densities according to eqn (2) and (3) in the Experimental section. The energy density of the CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF and NiS/NF samples was 13.36, 24.24, 54.88, and 35.50 W h kg−1, respectively, at a current density of 2 A g−1 and power density of 500 W kg−1. Importantly, the FeS/NF coral reef-like nanostructure-based electrode can offer a higher energy density, even at a high power density, and the energy density reached 26.19 W h kg−1 at a power density of 4500 W kg−1, highlighting its potential as an electrode material for high-performance SCs.
In addition to the energy and power density, the cycling performance is also very important for SCs. Fig. 8a compares the cycling performance of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, FeS/NF, and NiS/NF as an electrode material in SCs at a current density of 2 A g−1. The initial capacitance of FeS/NF was 2007.61 F g−1 and the capacitance was 2047.76 F g−1 after 1000 cycles, showing that the electrode exhibited reversible redox behavior and outstanding long-term electro-chemical stability. The increased capacitance may be due to electroactivation during the repeated charge–discharge cycles.47 After 3000 cycles, approximately 97.0% of its initial capacitance was retained. Such good electro-capacitive performance may be due to multiple factors. The coral reef-like nanostructure on nickel foam favors electron transport, which might increase the electrical conductivity. In particular, a nanostructure with a relatively high specific surface area will have a large interfacial area between the electrode and electrolyte as well as a sufficient number of physical cavities for rapid ionic diffusion. In addition, FE-SEM of FeS/NF (Fig. 8d) after 3000 cycles showed that the coral reefs were still visible on the substrate, which demonstrated higher structural stability. On the other hand, in the case of CoS/NF, CuS/NF, and NiS/NF, the structure changed completely and a large percentage of material was peeled off from the nickel substrate. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, these obtained values for the FeS/NF are higher than or approximately equal to that of the bare or composite based electrodes (see Table 2).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a coral reef-like nanostructure of FeS/NF was prepared for use in SCs by simple hydrothermal synthesis. The as-prepared samples exhibited pseudocapactive characteristics and a high specific capacitance of 2007.61 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, compared to 395.85 F g−1 for CoS/NF, 718.48 F g−1 for CuS/NF, and 1298.66 F g−1 for NiS/NF. The FeS/NF electrode displayed superior specific capacitance, good cycling stability (only 3% loss after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1), greater energy density of 54.88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1, and excellent rate capability compared to the other electrodes. The outstanding supercapacitive behaviors of FeS/NF and NiS/NF were attributed mainly to their unique coral reef and Brussels sprout-like structures, which can provide a good access to electrolyte ions, short ion diffusion paths, more free space to accommodate volume changes, and higher conductivity. The FeS/NF electrode is expected to have applications in other fields, such as Li ion batteries, photocatalysis, and solar cell devices, owing to its good electrochemical properties, low toxicity, low-cost, and simple operation.
