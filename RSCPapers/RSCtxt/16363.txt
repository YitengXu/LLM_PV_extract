    , Accepted 5th November 2020First published on 20th November 2020AbstractAs a promising idea to design high-efficiency organic photovoltaics, singlet fission (SF) mechanism, i.e., generating two triplet excitons out of a single photon absorption, has recently come into the spotlight. Even though much effort has been devoted to this arena, accurately accounting for the SF process from the theoretical perspective has proven to be challenging. Herein, the SF energetics have thoroughly been investigated with the help of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSHs) in both gas and solvent phases. Taking a series of experimentally known SF chromophores as working models, we have proposed and validated several variants of OT-RSH approximations for the reliable prediction of the energy levels which match the crucial criteria for the SF process, namely, the negative singlet–triplet and triplet–triplet energy gaps. We scrutinize the role of the OT-RSH ingredients, i.e., the underlying density functional approximations, short- and long-range exact-like exchange, as well as the range-separation parameter, for our purpose. The newly designed OT-RSHs outperform the standard RSHs and other related schemes such as screened-exchange approximations as well as other density functionals from different rungs for describing the SF energetics. More importantly, it is unveiled that although the OT-RSH coupled with the polarizable continuum model, OT-RSH-PCM, as well as the screened versions, OT-SRSHs, which account for the screening effect by the electron correlation through the scalar dielectric constant have some advantages over gas-phase computations using OT-RSHs, the energetics criteria of the SF process may not necessarily be satisfied. This in turn corroborates the idea of performing both the optimal tuning procedure and subsequent computations of the SF relevant energetics using OT-RSHs as a more reliable and affordable framework, at least for the present purpose. The applicability of the proposed models is also put into broader perspective, where they are used for the computational design of several chromophores as promising candidates prone to utilization in the SF-based materials. Hopefully, our recommended OT-RSHs can function as efficient models for both the theoretical modeling of SF chromophores and confirming the experimental observations in the field.
1. Introduction
The incidence of a photon on the chromophore layer of photovoltaic devices leads to the creation of one singlet exciton. This exciton may also diffuse to the chromophore interface, where due to the charge separation, a pair of free charge carriers can be formed. Because of the possibility of radiative and radiationless decay paths to the ground state, singlet excitons are usually short-lived and can lower the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Nonetheless, with certain relations among the energies of the excited states of the chromophores, the singlet exciton may fission into two triplet excitons through a photophysical process called singlet fission (SF),1–6 resulting in twice the number of excitons with a longer life. Multiple exciton generation within the SF process provides a potential route to exceed the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit in conventional photovoltaic cells (∼30%),7 where the photoelectric transformation efficiency of a single-junction photovoltaic device can increase up to 46%.8 Besides, the external quantum efficiency above 100% has also been predicted in the SF-based organic solar cells, suggesting promising applications of SF-based materials for achieving extraordinarily high efficiency.9–11
The first mention of SF dates back to more than half a century ago, when this process was used to explain fluorescence quenching in crystalline anthracene.12–14 Since then, the SF process has been further characterized in other crystals and polymers.15–27 However, inspired by the work of Hanna and Nozik,8 where SF was proposed as a possible mechanism to enhance the efficiency of photoelectric conversion, the interests toward the SF idea as one of the most promising multiexciton generation mechanisms for solar energy conversion have been strongly revitalized in the recent years.28–50Scheme 1 shows the key pathways and the corresponding electronic rearrangements in the SF process.

In general, the SF process requires two or more chromophores to reside in close proximity and to satisfy certain energetic constraints. One molecule in the ground state (S0) is excited to its first singlet excited state by the absorption of high-energy photons (hν). The resulting molecule in the singlet excited state (S1) interacts with a nearby ground state molecule, leading to an excimer where one molecule is in its excited state and another is in its ground state. Herein, three pathways can come into play. As one possible route, direct internal conversion from the singlet exciton to a bound triplet–triplet biexciton, 1(TT), as a two-electron process without including charge transfer states, can be noted. The latter biexciton is a pair of triplet states that are coupled to form an overall singlet and its generation can be occur within a time scale as short as a subpicosecond. In turn, this process outcompetes the S1 radiative and radiationless decays, which usually occurs on the nanosecond or longer timescales; therefore, molecules with ultrafast S1 to S0 decay cannot be considered as appropriate SF chromophores.
There are still two other indirect ways towards 1(TT). One is through the charge transfer-mediated path, where the charge transfer states as the virtual states assist the formation of 1(TT) in a superexchange mechanism. Another route is via the excimer-mediated pathway, namely, sequential two one-electron transfer steps, local and charge transfer, with the charge transfer state as a real intermediate effectively populated prior to the generation of 1(TT). Finally, the SF process is completed when the triplet–triplet biexciton dissociates further into a pair of free triplets (T1) with a time scale of about a microsecond. The resulting triplets may also relax down to the corresponding ground state by emitting phosphorescence. Note, however, that due to the spin-conservation selection rule of the decay channels, these triplet excitons do not decay to the ground state rapidly.
Accordingly, an efficient SF requires certain relations among the excited state energies of the chromophores. Two important energy level matching criteria are as follows.1–6 E(S1) ≥ 2E(T1)(1) E(T2) ≥ 2E(T1)(2)where E(S) and E(T) denote the energy of the excited states in the singlet and triplet spin manifolds, respectively, and the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the first and second excited states. The inequality in eqn (1) ensures that the fission of singlet excitons into triplet excitons is exoergic and thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, the inequality in eqn (2) guarantees that the fusion of T1 excitons to T2 exciton is endoergic and thermodynamically unfavorable. Imposing the latter condition is, however, important not only to avoid non-fission decay into the triplet manifold but also for suppressing the triplet–triplet annihilation process, where a singlet high-energy exciton can be created by two low-energy triplet excitations. Notice, however, that based on earlier experiences in the field, it would be relatively easier to satisfy eqn (2) than eqn (1); consequently, the latter equation can be considered as a primary criterion for SF chromophores. We mention in passing that although, in terms of spin angular momentum addition treatments, two triplet excitons may also fuse to give one quintet exciton, the energy of the latter exciton is usually greater than that of the former; therefore, the channel towards the quintet manifold is hindered.
Owing to its importance in energy science, green chemistry, photovoltaics, etc., SF is a rapidly advancing research field. As can be witnessed from the literature, there is a rich collection of references in this regard, providing a much deeper knowledge regarding this peculiar photophysical phenomenon. For some review articles dedicated to the field of SF, we refer the interested reader to the references.1–6 Among a multitude of related research reports, it is difficult to disregard the importance of theoretical and computational chemistry. As a matter of fact, quantum chemical computations have greatly improved our understanding in this context. The role of such studies was found to be essential for different purposes, among which we can note some representative examples such as appreciating the most relevant factors for the efficiency of the process, properties of the corresponding electronic states, the potential fission mechanisms, and the key parameters controlling the rate and dynamics of the SF process. Notwithstanding earlier efforts, theoretically predicting the SF relevant energetic criteria, which in turn allows us to propose potential candidates for practical purposes, is still an unaccomplished task. In this context, choosing an appropriate level of theory that is able to provide a reliable description of the SF process is an important issue. The computational cost of wave function-based methods can, however, become prohibitive for medium and large systems. As a workaround for this bottleneck, time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (DFT),51–57 as an alternative with affordable computational cost and reasonable accuracy, is of interest. As the cornerstone of the present contribution, we present a detailed investigation on the TD-DFT modeling of the SF process. To do so, we considered a different approach to address the issue, where our work is not limited to assessing the available DFT approximations through a benchmarking study against the experimental data. Instead, we propose the optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSHs),58–61 without invoking fitting procedures and only based on the satisfaction of the inherent constraints of density functionals, for describing the excited states energetics involved in the SF process. Perusing the ingredients of the proposed models, we plan to unveil whether there exists an OT-RSH with superior performance compared to the earlier approximations for the computational modeling of the SF process. To the best knowledge of the present authors, there has been no detailed and systematic analysis in this regard as yet. Lastly, the best proposed models will also be employed for the computational design of several chromophores as promising candidates that can be utilized in SF-based materials.
2. Theoretical framework
In this section, we give a brief overview on the theoretical basics of the methodology under study. Further details can be found in the original papers referenced below.
A. Range-separated hybrid density functionals
In RSHs (long-range corrected (LC) functionals),62,63 the electron repulsion operator r12−1 is split into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) domains as follows.64–66 (3)Here, r12 is the interelectronic distance between electrons 1 and 2, and μ denotes the range-separation parameter controlling the interplay between the SR and LR parts. Notice that μ−1 can be considered as a characteristic length scale for switching between the two domains. Damping DFT exchange and complementing it with HF exchange are controlled by erf (standard error function), where erf(x) is expressed as  and varies smoothly from 0 (erf(0)) to 1 (erf(∞)).62,64,67
Treating the SR and LR regimes using the DFT and Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange terms, ESRx,DFT and ELRHF, respectively, and adding the DFT correlation term, Ec,DFT, to them, the resulting XC energy expression, Exc, can be written as follows. Exc = ELRHF + ESRx,DFT + Ec,DFT(4)A more general partitioning scheme for r12−1, called Coulomb Attenuating Method (CAM), can be defined using two extra parameters α and β as follows.68 (5)Here, α and β satisfy the 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ α + β ≤ 1 inequalities. Considering eqn (5), the XC energy expression takes the following form. Exc = αESRHF + (1 − α)ESRx,DFT + (α + β)ELRHF + (1 − α − β)ELRx,DFT + Ec,DFT(6)Based on eqn (6), the HF exchange contributions at the SR and LR domains are flexible as α and α + β, respectively, whereas eqn (4) leads to fixed amounts of 0 and 1 for these terms. Even though by imposing α = 0 and β = 1 in eqn (5) and (6) we arrive at eqn (3) and (4), respectively, the presence of extra parameters provides more flexibility for examine the effects of the SR and LR exchange contributions on the properties under study.69–77 Moreover, since the governing parameters for the limiting behavior of the HF exchange are α/r for r → 0 and (α + β)/r for r → ∞, enforcing α + β = 1 ensures the correct r−1 asymptotic tail of the exchange–correlation potential in the LR regime. To obtain such a correct description for the potential in the LR regime, it should be modeled only by the HF exchange. This means that the coefficients of the ELRHF and ELRx,DFT terms in eqn (6) should equal to 1 and 0, respectively, which in turn leads to a simpler working equation as compared to eqn (6). Exc = αESRHF + (1 − α)ESRx,DFT + ELRHF + Ec,DFT(7)In this work, considering the RSHs with full HF exchange at the asymptotic distance, α + β = 1, and adopting different combinations of the α and β parameters, we propose new variants of the RSHs for our goal. However, another parameter, namely, the range-separation parameter μ, is also to be determined. For this purpose, we have relied on the optimal tuning procedure, as explained below.
B. Optimal (non-empirical) tuning procedure
The optimal or non-empirical tuning procedure for obtaining the range-separation parameter uses no reference data from the experiment or high-level theoretical approaches but relies on the agreement between the ionization and orbital energies (ionization energy theorem).58–61 In practice, for each value of μ, the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) are calculated via delta self-consistent field (ΔSCF) procedure as IPμ(N) = Eμ(N − 1) − Eμ(N) and EAμ(N) = Eμ(N) − Eμ(N + 1), respectively, where the differences are between the energies of the ground state for the N and N ± 1 electron systems. Considering these latter relations, one has EAμ(N) = IPμ(N + 1). On the other hand, for the exact XC functional, IP(N) = −εHOMO(N), where εHOMO is the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy. However, there is no similar relation that can equate EA with −εLUMO(N), where LUMO denotes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. In fact, the derivative discontinuity of the exchange–correlation potentials leads to a difference between the two quantities. Nonetheless, this discontinuity can be removed by considering the IP of the anion instead of the EA of the neutral system, i.e., IP(N + 1) = −εHOMO(N + 1).78–80
Because of the approximate nature of the density functional approximations (DFAs), there are still differences between the IPs and orbital energies, where these differences can be considered as the two minimizing conditions through the relations j(N;μ) = εμHOMO(N) + IPμ(N) and j(N + 1;μ) = εμHOMO(N + 1) + IPμ(N + 1). However, a reliable minimization should include both the neutral and ionic systems; therefore, the latter functions should be minimized simultaneously, leading to a more general minimization procedure using a function defined as J = j(N;μ) + j(N + 1;μ).69–77 Finally, depending on the dependencies of the HOMO and total energies on the range-separation parameter, the values of μ are close to the minima of the j(N;μ) and j(N + 1;μ) functions; thus, the minimization of the following target function has been suggested.58–61 (8)During this work, the values of the range-separation parameter in the proposed OT-RSHs are optimally tuned through the minimization of the target function defined in eqn (8).
3. Computational details
Several experimentally known SF chromophores and theoretically designed molecules to be used in SF-based materials have been investigated. For choosing these systems, various factors such as molecular diversity, variety of energy gaps, and efficiency of the SF process have been taken into account. The considered experimental proven-to-work SF chromophores include well-known molecules in the field, namely, tetracene,81–83 pentacene,84,85 and 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene (rubrene).82,86–90 Moreover, we have also studied several recently synthesized SF chromophores, namely, 5,11-dicyano-6,12-diphenyltetracene (TcCN),91 bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TP), 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)anthradipyridine (ADPD), 8,9,10,11-tetrafluoro-6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1-azapentacene (4F1NTP), and 8,9,10,11-tetrafluoro-6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1,4-diazapentacene (4F2NTP).92 This class of compounds, which in turn can be considered as the derivatives of tetracene, pentacene, and N-heteropentacene, enables us to explore the SF energetic criteria and compare their trend on an equal footing. The chemical structures of these experimentally known SF chromophores are shown in Fig. 1.

For clarity, hydrogen atoms and the corresponding bonds with carbon atoms have been omitted. The numbers given below the structures are used to refer the corresponding compounds in the text. 
On the other hand, and as will be discussed in the following sections, considering the point that the molecules satisfying the energetic criteria in eqn (3) and (4) to be involved in the SF pathways are not abundant, computationally-assisted systematic efforts to design SF molecules seems to be important. Note, however, that although the excitation energies in the corresponding energetic criteria may be utilized as a common practice in the literature for the design of SF molecules, in order to more conclusively judge whether a molecule is a good candidate, the structural reorganizations of the excited states should also be accounted for. Nonetheless, several other molecules to be utilized in SF-based materials have also been designed theoretically during our work. To that end, inspired by the literatures regarding the effects of different substituents and other aspects such as the presence of heteroatoms for the computational modeling of SF-based molecules, we have proposed new derivatives of experimentally known molecules with various substituents and heteroatoms such as –S, –N, –CN, –F, and –COOH. The chemical structures of these theoretically predicted chromophores are also shown in Fig. 2. The accountability and applicability of these molecules as candidates to be employed in SF-based materials will be explored based on the energy criteria for designing molecules with high SF efficiency, i.e., eqn (1) and (2), using the proposed OT-RSHs.

Before computing the SF relevant energetics for these chromophores using the proposed OT-RSHs, we first performed the tuning procedure to obtain the optimal values of the range-separation parameter. The value of the range-separation parameter, with an approximate range from 0.05 to 0.30 bohr−1 in increments of 0.05, is varied until its optimal value is obtained by minimizing the target function in eqn (8). Moreover, the range of changes for the SR HF exchange should also be determined. In many earlier studies, the minimization process and even property calculations were often performed with α = 0.0 and consequently β = 1.0. However, in our calculations, to examine the effect of SR HF exchange on the computed SF energetics, we have considered different percentages for this term. The SR HF exchange values can be determined either from the first principles arguments93–96 or by empirical fittings against standard databases. It has been repeatedly shown that α ≈ 0.2 leads to satisfactory results for various properties.97–100 However, since this choice may not necessarily work well for all purposes, we have included a broader range for SR HF exchange, ranging from 0% to 20% with intervals of 5%.
Note, however, that for very large values of SR HF exchange, the corresponding range-separation parameter satisfying Koopmans theorem to a meaningful accuracy may not be found. This is because there is also a limit to the extent of SR HF exchange that can be employed, while still maintaining compatibility with the correlation expression.101 Finally, although we have considered different SR HF exchange contributions, in all the cases, the full exchange at the asymptotic distance, namely, the constraint of α + β = 1, has been imposed.
The DFAs in the energy expression of the OT-RSHs need also to be specified. As our earlier studies have demonstrated,71,72,74,75 irrespective of the DFAs, generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) or meta-GGAs, used during the optimal tuning of the range-separation parameter, almost similar optimally tuned values for μ are obtained. We have relied on the widely used GGA, namely, BLYP,102,103 for the exchange and correlation terms during all the optimal tuning processes. However, in addition to the BLYP approximation, other DFAs, namely, PBE104 and TPSS,105 have also been considered for SF energetics calculations using the developed OT-RSHs.
Following the previous thorough analyses and suggestions in the field, we used the widely adopted B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set for geometry optimization and frequency calculations.35,101,106,107 On the other hand, it has been found earlier that the optimally tuned values of the range-separation parameter obtained based on different geometries are qualitatively consistent, where there is no substantial dependence on the choice of basis sets and their extension.108,109 It has also been shown that for TD-DFT calculations, a double-zeta basis set gives results close to convergence and it is probably not necessary to use larger basis sets when modeling low-lying excited states, as in our case.110 Accordingly, following the recent efforts, we have used the 6-31+G(d) basis set in this work. This choice, in turn, gives us an opportunity to make a consistent comparison between the results presented herein and the previously related published data. For computations in solution, the solvent effects have been modeled through the polarizable continuum model (PCM)111–113 in the integral equation formalism (IEF)114–116 with the same solvents as the ones used in the corresponding experiments, namely, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, and toluene, for I, II, III, and IV–VIII, respectively. Since it has been previously shown that the optimal tuning procedure in the solvent may lead to unrealistic values for the range-separation parameter, we have alternatively performed the optimal tuning of range-separation for isolated chromophores in vacuum and then added the solvation model for subsequent calculations.69,117,118
Standard continuum solvation models, however, work by adding an external potential due to the surface charges induced by the charge distribution of the molecule to the gas-phase Hamiltonian.113 The resulting solvation from such a framework, missing out on the correlation-induced screening, has small effects on the orbital energies.69 In order to account for the screening effects, we have also relied on a different approach, where the polarization can directly be introduced into the framework of RSHs without resorting to solvation models.69,99 The screening effect by electron correlation can simply be modeled by modifying α + β = 1 to α + β = 1/ε, where the asymptotic potential is appropriately screened by the scalar dielectric constant ε as 1/εr as compared to 1/r in the gas phase. This approach has, in turn, some advantages, where it can not only account for dielectric screening while using the same range-separation parameter as the one tuned for gas phase calculations but parameter β can also be determined as β = (1/ε) − α using the preset values of α for systems in the gas phase.119 The OT-RSHs constructed upon this screening condition are called as OT-SRSHs in our discussion.
From the methodological side, Tamm–Dancoff approximation120 has been used in our calculations, mainly due to its lower computational cost and avoiding the triplet instability problem.121 Vertical excitation energies from the ground state to the first singlet excited state as well as to the first and second triplet excited states have been computed as E(S1) = [E(S1)/E(S0)] − E(S0), E(T1) = [E(T1)/E(S0)] − E(S0), and E(T2) = [E(T2)/E(S0)] − E(S0), respectively, where E(S1)/E(S0), E(T1)/E(S0), and E(T2)/E(S0) denote the energies of the respective excited states at the optimized geometry of the ground state. Accordingly, the SF energy gap of the chromophores as the driving force for singlet exciton fission and the triplet–triplet (TT) energy gap can be expressed as ΔESF = 2E(T1) − E(S1) and ΔETT = 2E(T1) − E(T2), respectively.
Most of the runs during this work were implemented in the GAUSSIAN09 suite of codes.122 Moreover, for some other analyses and TD-DFT computations using specific functionals, we also used the ORCA quantum chemistry package.123 As the metrics for comparing the performances of the functionals, we have used mean signed deviation (MSD), , mean absolute deviation (MAD), , maximum absolute deviation (MaxAD), MaxAD = max|xi|, minimum absolute deviation (MinAD), MinAD = min|xi|, and root mean square deviation (RMSD), , where xi is the deviation of the computed results from the reference data and the summations are run over the set of the considered chromophores, n.
4. Results and discussion
Our main results and the corresponding discussions will be presented in the Sections A–E.
A. Determination of the range-separation parameter using the optimal tuning procedure

Fig. 3 shows the plots of the target function J2 as a function of the range-separation parameter μ using BLYP DFA and different combinations of the α and β parameters for the experimental SF chromophores I–VIII. As can be seen from the plots, even though there are similarities among the curves for each of the combinations of the α and β parameters, their minima do not exactly coincide, indicating more dependency of μ on the considered chromophores. Looking at the curves, we can also observe that there are both flat and sharp regions around the minima, where the former region is more pronounced for chromophores I and II without any substitutions and heteroatoms, namely, pentacene and tetracene. However, a distinct minimum can be determined for each of the chromophores in all the considered combinations of the α and β parameters. To this end, the polynomials fitted to the data points of the corresponding curves were minimized, leading to optimally tuned values of the range-separation parameter. The corresponding numerical data have been reported in Table 1.

The data in the table show that the optimally tuned values of μ are within the range of about 0.12–0.22 bohr−1. As a result, for these chromophores, we have μ ≲ 0.22 bohr−1, indicating that the LR HF exchange takes effect when r12 ≳ 4.5 bohr. Moreover, we find that for each of the chromophores, the optimally tuned values of μ decrease as the α and β parameters change from 0.0 and 1.0 to 0.2 and 0.8, respectively, highlighting a negative correlation between SR HF exchange and the optimally tuned values of the range-separation parameter. Accordingly, for smaller (larger) values of the range-separation parameter, less (more) DFT contributions become short-ranged. For all the considered combinations of the α and β parameters among the systems under study, the chromophores II and V have the largest and smallest optimally tuned value of range-separation, respectively. This can, however, be rationalized. On the one hand, the partitioning schemes of the electron repulsion operator in eqn (3) and (5) show that the SR term decays exponentially on the length scale of μ−1. On the other hand, the characteristic distance for switching between the SR (r12 ≤ μ−1) and LR (r12 ≥ μ−1) domains can also be reflected by μ−1. Therefore, larger (smaller) optimally tuned values of μ can be associated with smaller (larger) chromophores. This is consistent with the fact that for chromophores such as II with a smaller conjugation path and less delocalization as compared to other chromophores such as V, transition from DFT exchange to HF exchange occurs at smaller r12; therefore, the spatial ranges at which the HF exchange corrections are needed become smaller. Earlier efforts have also shown that there is a linear correlation with a positive slope between the inverse of the range-separation parameter and electronic spatial extent as a measure of the molecular size.73,77 As another point regarding the optimally tuned values of μ, we find that their numerical values are smaller than that empirically determined for the corresponding standard models,124 sometimes by a factor of about 2, such as 0.33 bohr−1 for first- to third-row atoms65 and 0.47 bohr−1 for larger sets of small molecules.125 Thus, the importance of a detailed tuning procedure to obtain an optimal value of μ for each of the chromophores is underscored once again. However, the optimally tuned values of μ for some chromophores such as I and II and specially in the cases of smaller SR HF exchange are close to that reported for other RSHs such as LC-ωPBE0,98 ωM05-D,126 and M11127 with the values of the range-separation parameter of about 0.20, 0.20, and 0.25 bohr−1, respectively. The obtained results are also consistent with those recently reported for emitters exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence, sensitizers and annihilators in the triplet–triplet annihilation mechanism, and different types of fluorophores.75,77,128 This in turn indicates that it is possible to recommend a more general applicable range-separation parameter for describing the related photophysical phenomena.
B. Proposing OT-RSHs for describing the SF relevant energetics
Having optimally tuned the values of the range-separation parameter, they were used for the calculations of the energetic criteria of the SF chromophores based on the two constraints in eqn (1) and (2). The computed values of the first singlet excitation energies as well as the first and second triplet excitation energies of the SF chromophores under study using OT-RSHs based on the BLYP, PBE, and TPSS DFAs for all the combinations of α and β parameters have been tabulated in the ESI,† Tables S1–S3. Furthermore, the resulting numerical values of the SF and TT energy gaps have also been provided in the ESI,† Tables S4 and S5. To have a better picture for the analysis of these data, we have shown the visualization maps of the SF and TT gaps using all the proposed models in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Visualization maps for the SF (a) and TT (b) energy gaps for the experimentally known SF chromophores under study using the proposed OT-RSHs based on different DFAs, i.e., BLYP, PBE, and TPSS, for all the combinations of the α and β parameters. The positive and negative gaps are represented based on the color bars. 
As displayed on the map, each proposed OT-RSH, including a combination of the α and β parameters and a DFA, given on the horizontal axis, has been used to compute the SF and TT energy gaps for all the chromophores shown on the vertical axis. Moreover, according to the color bars, the light gray to dark red spectra represent the shift from the negative computed values of the SF and TT gaps toward the positive values. We can see from map (a) in the figure that the negative values of the SF energy gap for all the chromophores can well be reproduced using the OT-RSH based on the TPSS DFA with α = 0.10, β = 0.90 as well as the PBE- and TPSS-based OT-RSHs with both the combinations of α = 0.15, β = 0.85 and α = 0.20, β = 0.80. On the other hand, we find from map (b) that the proposed OT-RSHs based on different DFAs under study show nearly equivalent performances for reproducing the negative TT energy gap. However, it seems that larger contributions of SR HF exchange lead to better performance of the OT-RSHs, at least for the present purpose. On going from left to right, where the SR HF exchange contribution increases, the TPSS-based OT-RSH with α = 0.20, β = 0.80 emerge as an approximation providing the negative TT energy gaps for most of the chromophores. There are, however, some chromophores for which the latter gap is still predicted as a small positive value.
By considering these observations on the one hand and analyzing the corresponding statistical metrics on the performance of the proposed OT-RSHs in reproducing the experimental SF energy gaps (Table S4, ESI†) on the other hand, we can propose the most reliable model for our purpose. Accordingly, after confirming the accountability of some models mentioned above for satisfying the energetic criteria of SF chromophores, statistical analyses have also been carried out for further assessing their performance and choosing the best performers. The corresponding statistical metrics for the performance of these OT-RSHs in the calculations of the SF energy gap for all the considered chromophores have been provided in Table 2.

From the results in the table, we see that there is a tendency of underestimating the SF energy gaps using all the developed OT-RSHs, as can be clearly seen from the reinforced negative MSDs. On the other hand, based on not only other statistical metrics in the table but also looking at our numerical data across all the combinations of the α and β parameters, we find that although the accuracy of these models are comparable, TPSS- and PBE-based OT-RSHs with the combinations of α = 0.10, β = 0.90 and α = 0.15, β = 0.85, respectively, can be recommended as the models to reliably account for the energetic criteria in the SF process.
What does this outcome tell us about the ingredients of the OT-RSHs for describing the SF relevant energetics? It can be unequivocally underlined that the two extremes of the SR HF exchange, α = 0.00 and α = 0.2, do not necessarily work well for the present purpose but a particular compromise between the parameters α and β is needed to obtain good and reliable accuracy. However, we find out from these findings that imposing some portions of the SR HF exchange in the OT-RSHs and consequently mitigating the self-interaction error, more reliable descriptions for the problem of the concern are achieved. On the other hand, regarding the considered DFAs, we notice that apart from the widely used PBE DFA, not only the use of TPSS including a correlation component free of self-interaction as the underlying DFA in the proposed OT-RSHs is important for our goal but comparing the results obtained from the TPSS-based OT-RSHs with respect to those obtained from other approximations can also disclose the role of the kinetic energy density for the SF energetic criteria. The reliability and competitive role of the OT-RSHs based on meta-GGAs along with some contributions of SR HF exchange for other related purposes such as describing the sensitizers in triplet–triplet annihilation photon upconversion have also been illustrated in earlier efforts.77
C. Benchmarking the proposed models against other DFT approximations
In addition to the comparisons made among the developed OT-RSHs based on different DFAs, their capability with respect to other approximations belonging to different rungs has also been checked. We first present a comparative analysis on the results of our proposed OT-RSHs and their standard counterparts, other RSHs, and some representative examples of the recently proposed Minnesota functionals including the so-called screened-exchange (SX) functionals,129–131 where the HF exchange decreases from SR to LR interelectronic separation in such a way that it vanishes at the LR regime. The statistical metrics on the performance of these functionals for predicting the SF energy gap of all the considered chromophores have been presented in Table 3.

Also given in the table are the corresponding data for the standard counterparts as well as other RSH and SX functionals

Some important conclusions regarding these comparisons can be drawn. (i) As compared to the standard LC functionals with the ingredients of (α, β, μ) as (0.00, 1.00, 0.47),66 the proposed OT-RSHs give smaller deviations with respect to the experimental data. Note that although all the functionals satisfy the α + β = 1.0 condition, an optimally tuned value of the range-separation parameter (not default value) as well as small contributions of SR HF exchange are necessary for well-describing the SF energy gap of the chromophores. This is also indeed the case when comparisons are made with respect to other tested RSHs such as LC-ωPBE (0.00, 1.00, 0.40)67,132 and ωB97 series of functionals, namely, ωB97 (0.00, 1.00, 0.40),133 ωB97X (0.157706, 0.842294, 0.30),133 ωB97X-D (0.222036, 0.777964, 0.20),134 and ωB97X-V (0.167, 0.833, 0.30),135 where computations using the latter functional as an RSH approximation augmented with non-local correlation have been implemented in the ORCA program.123 (ii) The comparison with the M11 functional (0.428, 0.572, 0.25)127 points out that the origin of larger deviations of this functional as compared to our proposed OT-RSHs may be related to a larger contribution of about 43% of the SR HF exchange. However, the differences among the DFAs used in the construction of the XC functionals should also be taken into account. (iii) The superior performance of the proposed models herein with respect to CAM-B3LYP (0.19, 0.46, 0.33)68 again underlines the role of imposing correct full asymptotic HF exchange, α + β = 1.0, as compared to other options such as α + β = 0.65 in CAM-B3LYP for the description of the SF process. (iv) Finally, the superiority of the OT-RSHs with α + β = 1.0 as compared to the MN12-SX (0.25, −0.25, 0.11) functional,130 where α + β = 0.0, shows that the tuned functionals based on the LC approach can outperform the approximations designed upon SX formalism, at least for the present purpose.
Based on the discussions we have conducted so far, the efficiency of the proposed OT-RSHs for the reliable prediction of the SF energetic criteria can be safely asserted. Nonetheless, we have also expanded our comparisons by including more data obtained from different model chemistries for the chromophores that were available.41 To that end, the results of the SF energy gap obtained using some conventional and widely used hybrid functionals, namely, B3LYP,102,103 B3PW91,102,136 PBE0,137 BHandHLYP,138 and M06-2X,139 including fixed percentages of HF exchange as 20, 20, 25, 50, and 54, respectively, with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set, have been considered in our comparisons. Note that the BHandHLYP and M06-2X functionals have been recommended for SF sensitizers, where for the former method, the spin–flip TD-DFT framework140 has also been considered.41 The values of the SF energy gap using these five functionals were found to be respectively −0.18, −0.35, −0.63, −0.48, and 0.14 eV for tetracene and −0.72, −0.95, −1.55, −0.91, and −0.42 eV for pentacene. Our best estimates of the SF energy gap for tetracene and pentacene were found to be −0.11 and −0.47, respectively. Comparing all these results with the experimental reference data, −0.07 and −0.40 eV, respectively, we find that the accuracy of our proposed models is better than or comparable to that of others. Such comparisons also provide a path to further check the relative performances of DFT approximations across the hierarchy of functionals,141 where we can see that the applicability of the models for the SF relevant energetic criteria is improved when going from the conventional hybrids with a fixed amount of HF exchange (α ≠ 0, μ = 0) to the OT-RSHs with interelectronic distance-dependent HF exchange (α ≠ 0, μ ≠ 0). Note that in addition to the sign of the predicted values and the corresponding statistical analyses, the individual numerical data of the SF energy gaps for each of the chromophores should also be taken into account. Our numerical data reveal that the order of the predicted SF gaps for most of the considered chromophores matches well with the trend of the experimental data. It can thus be concluded that the wide range of the negative SF energy gaps can be well-estimated using the proposed OT-RSHs; consequently, these models may be introduced as promising candidates for modeling new tailored SF-based molecules. It should be mentioned in passing that although our main focus has been based on the description of SF process, the excitation energies used to compute the SF energetic criteria should also be taken into account. With more details, it would be of importance to compare the performance of the proposed OT-RSHs and their standard counterparts to reproduce the singlet and triplet excitation energies individually. In other words, it is possible that the corresponding excitation energies predicted by the model have large deviations with respect to the reference data but their differences show no such deviations. An accurate description of the singlet and triplet components should, however, be accounted for. Scrutiny in this line not only enables us to disclose the components that are better reproduced but it is also unveiled that what excitation energies govern the good performance of the OT-RSHs for the prediction of the SF energetics. The numerical data of the singlet and first triplet excitation energies obtained using the best proposed OT-RSHs in this work and their standard versions as well as the corresponding experimental data used as reference have been provided in the ESI,† Tables S6 and S7. Related statistical analyses have also been presented in the ESI,† Table S8. We find that the newly designed and standard models provide comparable results for the triplet excited states and show nearly equivalent performances. In this context, the adiabatic treatment regarding the triplet excited states of the SF chromophores under study has also been considered. More specifically, after optimizing the corresponding structures at the triplet excited state, the adiabatic triplet excitation energies have been computed as the difference between the optimized ground state and the triplet excited state using the proposed approximations. All the numerical raw data as well as the corresponding statistical analyses have also been presented in the same tables. Comparing this data with those obtained earlier, we find that there are some slight differences among the numerical values within the vertical and adiabatic treatments, where for some SF chromophores, smaller deviations with respect to the reference data are obtained from the adiabatic considerations, while in some other cases, the vertical analysis is the winner. Furthermore, although the results of the statistical analysis of both the vertical and adiabatic treatments are consistent, the statistical descriptors of the latter scheme are, however, comparable to or larger than that obtained from the former, which in turn can lead to larger deviations from the derived SF energy gaps.108 However, from the obtained data regarding the adiabatic analysis, it was found out that the performance of the proposed model based on TPSS DFA is slightly outperformed by the PBE-based approximation. On the other hand, regarding the singlet excitation energies, the related analyses unambiguously demonstrate that as compared to the standard LC approximations, our OT-RSHs provide more accurate data, which is consistent with earlier reports.142 Summing up, it seems that the accountability of the proposed OT-RSHs can be disclosed not only for the SF energetics criteria but also for the corresponding individual transition energies.
We have also compared our results on the singlet and triplet excitation energies as well as some of the corresponding energy gaps with those obtained with other high-level wave function-based approaches, where besides the employed methods, the observed discrepancies may, however, be related to other factors such as optimized geometries and basis sets. For instance, the values of the singlet excited electronic state energy for pentacene were found to be 2.17,143 2.31,144 and 2.2145 eV using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-CASPT2, multi-reference Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MRMP)/general multiconfigurational quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (GMC-QDPT), and GW/Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches, respectively, as compared to our results using the OT-RSHs, which was 2.6 eV. Moreover, the energy gap between the two lowest triplet excited states of pentacene was found to be 1.2 eV using the combination of the GW method and BSE,146 and 1.24 eV using the MRMP,147 which is comparable to that found in the present study, i.e., 1.1 eV. Finally, the values of the first triplet excitation energy for pentacene calculated at the corresponding optimized structure were found to be 0.87144 and 0.85147 eV based on the variants of MRMP computations, which is in close agreement with our findings using the proposed OT-RSHs based on TPSS (α = 0.10, β = 0.90) and PBE (α = 0.15, β = 0.85) as 0.83 and 0.85 eV, respectively.
D. Solvent effects: OT-RSH-PCM and OT-SRSH models
We now deal with the effects of the dielectric medium. In general, the interplay between the solvation models, solvents, and their matching with the OT-RSH framework to describe the experimental environment and the photophysics is not very straightforward. However, for the sake of completeness, we have also carried out all the calculations by accounting for the solvent effects. In this regard, although a slight effect on the photophysical properties may be expected when using solvents with small dielectric constants, the solute–solvent interactions are, however, strong in highly polar solvents with large dielectric constants. We have computed the SF energy gap of all the chromophores in the solvent phase using the best proposed approximations in our calculations and called the resulting models as OT-RSHs-PCM to distinguish them from the OT-RSHs calculations in the gas phase. Furthermore, we have also carried out all the calculations with the modification of the parameters and equations based on OT-SRSHs in toluene as the solvent. The numerical raw data have been tabulated in the ESI,† Tables S9–S13 and the corresponding statistical analyses have been presented in Table 4.

Comparing the computed results in the gas phase with respect to those obtained in the solution, we find that the slight improvements are achieved when going from the gas phase to the solvent phase, though with an additional computational cost. This may, however, be understandable, where because of the charge-transfer nature of the transitions of concern, one can expect that the polarity of the environment will affect the excitation energies. Regarding the functionals ranking in different environments, we can also see that the relative ordering does not change in the solvent, where the two models have nearly equivalent performance.
More importantly, note, however, that the sign of the predicted SF and TT energy gaps should be consistent with the constraints given in eqn (1) and (2). Accordingly, regarding these comparisons and the superior performance of some approximations in the solvent phase based on statistical analyses, one should also be cautious. As a matter of fact, we found from our numerical data that in some cases, the energetic criteria in eqn (1) and (2) are not satisfied for some of the SF experimentally known chromophores such as II, III, and IV when using OT-SRSHs as well as for IV when using OT-RSHs-PCM, where the sign of the SF energy gaps obtained from the solvent phase calculations is positive. In another effort, to examine the effects of geometrical changes in the solvent on these findings, all the optimal tuning processes and subsequent calculations on the excitation energies and the corresponding SF energy gaps using OT-RSHs-PCM and OT-SRSHs in the same solvent as the one used in the corresponding experiments have been performed on the optimized geometries in the solvent. All the corresponding results have been provided in the ESI,† Table S14, where we observed no significant changes with respect to our earlier obtained results. With more details, it was found that neither the computed numerical data for both the excitation energies and the corresponding SF energy gaps nor the associated statistical analyses were significantly altered. It seems that for the present case, the combination of the optimally-tuned approximations with the solvation models is not straightforward to account for. Putting all the findings together, it can be concluded that although the statistical analyses show some improvements for OT-RSHs-PCM and OT-SRSHs, performing both the optimal tuning procedure and subsequent computations on the SF energetics using the OT-RSHs is a more reliable and affordable framework, at least for the present cases.
E. Computational design of SF chromophores using the proposed models
Given the paucity of SF materials, computationally-assisted systematic efforts to properly figure out the design rules of materials and mechanisms involved in the SF pathways seems to be important. Accordingly, as a computational modeling in this context, we have also tried to design several SF chromophores based on the earlier experiences. This in turn guides us to screen the SF-based target structures without performing the related experimental works, resulting in potential SF materials for enhancing the power-conversion efficiencies. Although one obstacle for the application of the SF phenomenon in photovoltaics is that the molecules meeting the corresponding energetic criteria are not abundant, there are still motivations and clues to design more SF chromophores. For instance, and of particular relevance to our study, introducing heteroatoms and substituents as one of the approaches to design SF chromophores should be mentioned.148–150 For illustrative examples of the SF compounds designed based on this and other strategies in the field, the interested reader is referred to some recently published papers and references therein.151–153
We have proposed and validated new derivatives of experimentally known molecules with various substituents and heteroatoms such as –S, –N, –CN, –F, and –COOH (see Fig. 2). Similar to what we have done earlier, all the corresponding computations regarding the optimal tuning procedure and SF energy gap calculations of these molecules have been performed based on our best proposed models. The corresponding plots of J2 as a function of μ are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding optimally tuned values of the range-separation parameter for all the designed molecules have also been collected in Table 5.

We can see from this data that the optimally tuned values of μ for the theoretically designed molecules are in the range of 0.12–0.18 bohr−1, which is consistent with those found earlier for the experimentally known chromophores, where most of the values are concentrated at about 0.14 bohr−1. These findings demonstrate again that not only is the optimal tuning of μ necessary for the reliable description of these chromophores but it may also be possible to propose a more general applicable range-separation parameter for describing such systems. The computed values of the first singlet excitation energies as well as the first and second triplet excitation energies of all the designed chromophores using the best OT-RSHs in this work have been given in the ESI,† Tables S15–S17. In addition, the corresponding numerical values of the SF and TT energy gaps have also been reported in the ESI,† Table S18. In order to make the key features more visible, the graphical representation of our results has been displayed in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Graphical representation of the computed values of the SF and TT energy gaps using the best OT-RSHs proposed in this work based on the TPSS and PBE DFAs for all the theoretically designed chromophores. 
Considering the two energetic conditions in eqn (1) and (2) as the criteria for designing molecules with high SF efficiency, we find that most of the designed molecules can be introduced as promising candidates in SF-based materials. However, this is not indeed the case for some molecules, where our proposed OT-RSHs predict positive energy gaps for rubrene derivatives, namely, chromophores XIII and to some extent XIV, which in turn have been designed by introducing a heteroatom (N) and a substitution (–COOH) in rubrene, respectively. It is noted here that based on the thorough discussions presented in the related literature, there are two possible isomers for rubrene, namely, planar-backbone rubrene (C2h) and twisted-backbone rubrene (D2).154–157 Although it has been found that the crystalline structure in the backbone is planar as a result of non-covalent interactions, the twisted isomer has been determined as not only the minimum energy geometry in the gas phase but also as the preferential configuration in amorphous films.35,42,154–157 Accordingly, the latter isomer has been considered during our analyses. We have further examined the capability of the predicted chromophores to be employed in the SF material. To this end, the relationships of the SF energy gap and its ingredients, singlet and triplet excited state energies, and the HOMO–LUMO (HL) energy gap for these molecules have been investigated. We can see from the correlations given in Fig. 7 that there exist linear correlations among the quantities with regression coefficients larger than 0.95. From these regression analyses, we also find that when the HL energy gaps are smaller than 2.5 eV, E(S1) is larger than 2E(T1), leading to negative ΔESF values, consequently to the thermodynamically favorability. This is in agreement with the earlier reports regarding other systems with diradical character, where it has been found that small HL gaps are related to small SF energy gaps.106,158,159 However, when the HL energy gap increases, such as for XIII and XIV chromophores, a reverse trend between the excited state energies is in place, where the values of ΔESF become positive; therefore, the corresponding molecules are thermodynamically unfavorable. These findings, in turn, unveil the role of the HL energy gap for proposing chromophores that can be used in SF-based materials. Putting all these findings together, the developed models in this work should hopefully be applicable for the modification of existing systems for optimizing the SF process as well as for searching new and optimal candidates prior to their challenging synthesis.

To wrap up, we would like to outline some of the subjects inspired from the present study to be followed in the future works. Detailed comparisons among the long-range correction scheme and other schemes, where either the percentage of the exact-like exchange decreases from SR to LR and vanishes at LR132–134 or increases from SR to a maximum value at the medium-range and then decreases to zero at LR,160,161 deserve to be made. Whether or not these latter approaches can improve the description of the SF process as well as their comparisons with the related wave function-based approaches162 remain to be further examined. Last, it would also be of interest to check the efficiency of other recently proposed range-separation parameter tuning schemes163–165 for the present purpose. There is still room along these lines and other aspects, whose results may be appeared elsewhere.
5. Concluding remarks
With the objective to design new theoretical approaches for the investigation of singlet fission process, in this work, we proposed to use optimally tuned range-separated density functional theory for the purpose. We have presented several variants of the optimally tuned range-separated approximations for predicting the singlet fission relevant energetic criteria for a series of experimentally known and theoretical designed chromophores. Based on the results of our study, it has been shown that the newly developed optimally tuned range-separated functionals lead to a reliable theoretical description of the singlet fission process. Moreover, the imperative roles of range-separation parameter tuning as well as short- and long-range exact-like exchange were highlighted. Taking all the comparisons together, we found that although the optimally tuned range-separated functionals coupled with the solvation models as well as the screened-exchange versions show some improvements from the statistical analysis viewpoint, satisfying the energy levels matching the criteria of the SF process should also be taken into account. Accordingly, performing both the optimal tuning procedure and subsequent computations on the energetics of the SF process in the gas phase can be considered as a promising protocol with affordable accuracy-to-computational cost ratio for the present purpose. Comparisons against recent literature unveiled that the newly proposed models outperform the conventional counterparts as well as other hybrids with both fixed and interelectronic distance-dependent exact-like exchange portions. The accountability of the presented models was further validated as a useful tool for the theoretical design of the chromophores that can be utilized in the singlet exciton fission materials.
