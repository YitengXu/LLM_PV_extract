    , Accepted 4th May 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractRecently, halide perovskites have become one of the most promising materials for solar cells owing to their outstanding photoelectric performance. Among them, metal halide all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3; where X denotes a halogen) show superior thermal and light stability. In particular, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) based on a CsPbX3 active layer has shown a steady increase from 2.7% to 19.03% with the improvement of the CsPbX3 crystal quality. In this review, we summarize methodologies that have been employed for controlling the growth of all-inorganic perovskite films so far, including precursor solution deposition, substrate modification, composition doping, and surface engineering. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of the perovskite crystal characteristics on defects and the perovskite film morphology, both of which are closely related to device performance. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are presented along with useful guidelines for developing all-inorganic pero-SCs with high PCE and robust stability.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have achieved considerable progress with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25%. However, hybrid perovskite materials are very unstable under humidity and thermal stress, because their volatile organic cation components such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) make the crystals easily decompose, thus hindering their further development. To overcome this intrinsic instability, inorganic cations such as cesium (Cs+) were proposed to completely replace the organic ions. The stability of the resultant all-inorganic perovskite materials was greatly improved, particularly at high temperature, and they could even bear 400 °C. Pursing high PCE and overall improved stabilities, which are highly dependent on the perovskite film quality, is the current primary task to promote the state-of-the-art all-inorganic pero-SCs toward practical application. Therefore, in order to attract the perovskite community's attention to this important direction, recent methodologies of crystal growth and related scientific issues for high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films have been summarized. This review comprehensively and clearly sorts out critical factors influencing the perovskite film quality, which will undoubtedly promote all-inorganic pero-SCs toward high performance and even large area.

1. Introduction
Perovskites have become a research hotspot because of their low binding energy, long carrier lifetime, and low defect density.1,2 In recent years, perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) based on organic metal halide perovskite materials have taken a leading role in attaining high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which already exceed 25%.3 Organic metal halide perovskites have the generic formula ABX3, where A denotes organic cations (methylammonium cations (MA+), formamidine cations (FA+), or a mixture of both cations), B is mostly Pb ions (rarely Sn ions), and X represents halogen ions. However, organic metal halide perovskites generally have the disadvantages of poor moisture and thermal stability.4 Many approaches have been successfully promoted for overcoming the low tolerance to moisture, and they include controlling the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films,5 using a two-dimensional perovskite layer,6 synthesizing a water-resistant hole transport layer (HTL),7 and replacing the cations at the A sites with hydrophobic ammonium cations.8 Thermal instability is usually caused by the decomposition of the perovskite film because of the high volatilization of organic cations under high temperatures (over 200 °C),9 and it hampers the long-term and thermal stability of solar cells.10,11 Although strategies such as using an encapsulated carbon electrode and partially replacing the organic component with cerium or rubidium ions can effectively slow down the decomposition process, the process cannot be prevented as long as organic cations are present.12–14 Fortunately, the thermal stability can be dramatically improved by completely replacing the A-site organic ions with inorganic cesium ions (Cs+), which results in the formation of an all-inorganic perovskite material with the generic formula CsPbX3. This perovskite can easily withstand temperatures above 400 °C without any degradation.15,16 Moreover, all-inorganic pero-SCs possess unique advantages for future application.17–22 For example, their energy bandgap (Eg) can be tuned by controlling the halogen content to selectively absorb photons of various wavelengths, and semitransparent and tandem devices can be easily fabricated.23 Additionally, their high stabilities, such as thermal stability24,25 and photostability (even under UV illumination),26 and moisture resistance27 render them suitable for practical applications. Excitingly, the PCE of all-inorganic pero-SCs has shown an increasing trend. In particular, a series of breakthroughs have led to a PCE exceeding 19% for the CsPbI3 perovskite.28 Although the PCE of all-inorganic pero-SCs still lags behind that of organic–inorganic hybrid pero-SCs, the comparable mobility, longer charge lifetime, and lower defect concentration of the former are expected to lead to the achievement of new milestones in photovoltaic technology in terms of both efficiency and stability. One of the key factors for such an achievement is the quality of the inorganic perovskite materials used in pero-SCs. A deep understanding of the relationship between the crystal quality and photophysical properties is imperative for further boosting the device performance.
A low quality crystal is known to generally lead to poor carrier-transporting ability and high charge recombination, which drastically deteriorate the device performance.29 Therefore, controlling all-inorganic perovskite film growth or ensuring the formation of perfect crystals is especially important. Fortunately, conventional fabrication methods for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films, such as solvent engineering,30,31 interface engineering,32,33 and defect passivation,34–36 have been successfully used for preparing all-inorganic perovskite films. However, all-inorganic perovskites have demerits that are not observed in the processing of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. For example, (1) the poor solubility of Cs-based precursors considerably limits the thickness of all-inorganic perovskite films and hinders the realization of favorable morphology, resulting in the light absorption and current density being insufficient, and (2) I-rich perovskites easily undergo a phase transformation to a non-perovskite phase because of their high moisture sensitivity, which is detrimental to the stability of photovoltaic devices. The above issues can be addressed by using either pure dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which is characterized by high solubility of precursors, or using another precursor pair to increase the film thickness for achieving sufficient photon absorption;37,38 these steps can also effectively slow the crystallization rate, facilitating the precise control of crystal growth. In addition, the introduction of organic and two-dimensional compounds in all-inorganic perovskites leads to the participation of these components in the crystallization process during film formation, resulting in the enhancement of the moisture and phase stability of the resulting film.39–41 Owing to the large difference in precursor solubility, thermochromism, and thermal resistance among all-inorganic perovskites, multistep spin coating,27 thermally driven, moisture-mediated reversible phase transition,42 and high temperature thermal annealing43 methods have been used to improve the morphology and phase purity, tune the light transmission, harness solar energy, and stabilize the cubic α-phase. Through ingenious crystal control methodologies, well-formed inorganic films with suppressed recombination and high charge carrier mobility have been obtained, and this has resulted in the realization of high-performance all-inorganic pero-SCs.
Herein, we discuss recently developed crystal growth methodologies for all-inorganic pero-SCs. As shown in Fig. 1, this review is divided into five parts. In the first section, we will briefly introduce the fundamental information regarding CsPbX3 perovskites. In the second section, we summarize and discuss conventional deposition methods for preparing perovskite films, focusing on low-temperature deposition, vacuum deposition, antisolvent treatment, tuning of the precursor solution composition, control of crystal growth, and post-treatment of precursor films. In the third section, we systematically summarize the effect of the substrate on perovskite film growth. The fourth section shows the strategies of doping engineering, and the fifth section discusses surface engineering, including the initiation of secondary growth and the provision of mechanical coating for passivation. Finally, conclusions and perspectives on the future development of all-inorganic CsPbX3 pero-SCs are provided.

2. Fundamental information regarding CsPbX3
CsPbX3 (X: iodine or bromine) possesses an octahedron-structure crystal lattice, in which Pb2+ and X− ions form a three-dimensional (3D) network of corner-sharing PbX6 octahedra, and the Cs+ ions occupy the octahedral voids created by the halogens.44 CsPbX3 has four types of crystal polymorph, i.e. the cubic phase (α-, Pm3m), the tetragonal phase (β-, P4/mbm), the orthorhombic phase (γ-, Pbnm) and an orthorhombic non-perovskite double chain phase (δ-, Pnma).22,45 Since the different tilt angles of the PbX6 octahedra of the polymorphs significantly influence their optoelectronic properties and crystal stabilities, the type of CsPbX3 phase is closely related to the photovoltaic properties and device stability. In addition, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is usually employed to predict the phase stability of a perovskite,46 which is given by ,where rA, rB, and rX are the ionic radii at the A, B, and X sites, respectively. In general, a stable cubic perovskite phase can be obtained when the t value is between 0.9 and 1, and the perovskite structure will be distorted as the t value decreases below 0.9 due to the titling of PbX6. Meanwhile, a t value >1 or <0.8 will lead to a non-perovskite phase.
Before starting to systematically review the crystal growth of all-inorganic perovskites and its effects on the photovoltaic properties, we briefly introduce the distinct phase stabilities stemming from CsPbX3 with various halogen content. It would of course facilitate the community to clearly understand the following sections about crystal growth methodologies for improved crystal quality and enhanced phase stability. In the various CsPbX3 perovskites, the I-rich CsPbI3 with complex phase stability needs to be highlighted. Generally, due to the small Goldschmidt tolerance factor of 0.81, CsPbI3 shows a yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-phase) at room temperature, which has a wide Eg of 2.82 eV and a low carrier mobility below 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.47,48 Therefore, δ-CsPbI3 is not suitable in solar cell application. Upon heating δ-CsPbI3 to 360 °C, the yellow phase will convert to the black cubic phase (α-phase), enabling an Eg decrease to 1.73 eV and mobility increase to 25 cm2 V−1 s−1.48,49 When cooling down α-phase CsPbI3, it tends to convert to a tetragonal β-phase at 260 °C and an orthorhombic γ-phase at 175 °C, successively. Notably, both β and γ are black phases, which also easily transfer to the δ-phase when kept at room temperature for a few days.50 In spite of this, these black phases provide the feasibility for use as photovoltaic active layers. Regarding the thermodynamic instability of black-phase CsPbI3 (most commonly the α-phase), substantial crystal growth methodologies were used to improve the phase stability. For example, (1) doping the lattice to increase the Goldschmidt tolerance factor; (2) reducing the crystal size to decrease the surface free energy; and (3) incorporating organic components to coordinate with the perovskite for inhibiting the undesirable phase transition (detailed discussion in Section 5).
Partial substitution of I− with smaller Br− can increase the Goldschmidt tolerance factor and stabilize the black phase; more attention is focused on mixed halogen inorganic perovskites. Cubic α-phase CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 perovskites as the two most studied components possess an optical Eg of ∼1.92 eV and ∼2.05 eV, respectively,22,51 presenting tremendous potential in semi-transparent and tandem solar cells.52 Different from CsPbI3, the mixed halogen inorganic perovskites exhibit superior black α-phase stability at room temperature but inevitably transfer to the non-perovskite δ-phase upon exposure to high humidity. This phase transformation is reversible upon heating to 350 °C in a dry environment.53 Besides, photoinduced phase separation is another reason for the degradation of all-inorganic perovskites due to light induced ion migration,54 and this behavior could also be observed in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (0.4 < x < 1).52 Fortunately, theoretical calculations reveal that CsPbI2Br has a stable alloy phase owing to the strong Coulomb interactions in the ionic perovskite lattice, and an improved crystal quality can suppress this phase separation.55,56 Thus, more efforts were devoted to investigating the crystal growth mechanism of all-inorganic perovskites, for example, managing the crystallization (Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6), optimizing the crystal seed formation (Section 4), exploring secondary growth methods (Section 6.1), etc.
CsPbBr3 with full Br− substitution features outstanding long-term stability upon moisture, heat,27 and light.26 CsPbBr3 crystals present three different phases, including the orthorhombic γ-phase, tetragonal β-phase and cubic α-phase. In contrast to CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 exhibits a stable orthorhombic γ-phase at room temperature. Upon heating γ-phase CsPbBr3, it prefers to convert to a tetragonal β-phase at 88 °C and a cubic α-phase at 130 °C,57 and the α-phase could be well kept even at 580 °C.58 After cooling to room temperature, cubic α-phase CsPbBr3 will return to the γ-phase. It is worth mentioning that the geometric structures of CsPbBr3 change little between the different phases due to the smaller radius of bromide compared to iodine, resulting in similar electronic structures among the different phases, especially in terms of Eg.59 Due to its superior stability and high conduction band, CsPbBr3 is expected to produce a high-open circuit voltage (Voc) device through precisely controlling crystal growth for reducing film defects (Section 3.5).
Based on the above fundamental information, we have realized that there are a number of challenges in simultaneously improving the stability and efficiency of CsPbX3-based pero-SCs. Although some strategies like optimizing the device structure, and rationally selecting interface and encapsulation materials can address this issue to some extent, it is urgent to promote the development of this important field from fundamental levels, such as crystal growth and the underlying mechanism (Fig. 2).

3. Deposition engineering
The CsPbX3 perovskite is usually obtained by the reaction between precursors related to it (CsX and PbX2). Among the various deposition methods, solution processing is the most commonly adopted method because of its low cost, simplicity, and suitability for large-scale fabrication. In the method, the precursors are dissolved in solution, and this is followed by a coating and thermal annealing process. In addition, vacuum deposition methods, including co-evaporation, sequential evaporation, and the combination of a solution process and evaporation, have also been explored for crystal growth. For the realization of a high-quality perovskite film, research efforts should focus on improving crystal growth, including nucleation, crystal growth rate, film thickness, and morphology optimization. In this section, we discuss the following precursor deposition methods and film modification strategies: low-temperature deposition, vacuum deposition, antisolvent treatment, tuning of the precursor solution composition, control of the crystal growth process, and post-treatment of the precursor film.
3.1 Low-temperature deposition
A black-phase all-inorganic perovskite crystal is usually obtained through thermal annealing at a relatively high temperature (above 300 °C), which not only leads to high energy consumption but also causes difficulties in crystal formation. These problems especially limit large-scale fabrication and flexible device application. Several methods have been proposed to overcome the above issues, and they include additive engineering, acquisition of a distorted phase, and solvent engineering. Additive engineering is an effective way to decrease the thermal annealing temperature of all-inorganic perovskite films.63 Eperon et al. showed that adding hydroiodic acid (HI) to CsPbI3 precursor solution successfully lowered the thermal annealing temperature to 100 °C.60 They found that HI could induce CsPbI3 crystal growth and the formation of smaller grains, which presumably resulted from an increased crystallization rate, since HI could be driven off more rapidly than pure N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The smaller grains would cause enhanced strain in the lattice, leading to a lower-temperature phase transition (Fig. 3a). The resultant device with a planar heterojunction architecture exhibited a PCE of 2.9% (see Table 1). Zhao et al. developed a low-temperature deposition method at 100–150 °C by using PbI2·xHI (x > 1.3) as a precursor. The HI in the PbI2·xHI adduct could decrease the crystallization energy barrier for the formation of α-CsPbI3.39 Hu et al. added trace amounts of HI and H2O to the CsPbI3 precursor solution. They found that H2O molecules promoted the ionization of HI in the DMF·xHI complex to liberate H+ and I− as free ions, which could reduce the size of the colloid and form corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra. As a result, orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 with robust stability was achieved at a low processing temperature of 100 °C.64 After understanding in-depth the role of HI, the addition of HI has become a universal approach for CsPbI3-based solar cell systems.65–68 Zhang et al. added 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) to CsPbI2Br precursor solution and obtained a high-crystallinity α-CsPbI2Br perovskite after thermal annealing at 100 °C (Fig. 3b).40 The reduced annealing temperature was ascribed to a reduced crystallization rate resulting from the influence of the nonvolatile additive ABA. ABA induced the formation of a film with interconnected CsPbI2Br grains, and the terminal groups of ABA, which was anchored onto the surface of the CsPbI2Br crystal, bridged adjacent CsPbI2Br crystals. Moreover, the anchored ABA could protect the CsPbI2Br film from moisture attack, enhancing the air stability of the film. Consequently, a fully printable mesoscopic device with a PCE of 8.44% was realized. We can conclude that a more volatile additive can accelerate the crystallization process, thereby reducing the energy required, while less or non-volatile additives (generally organic components) may be used to connect perovskite precursors by their functional groups. The formed chemical bonds (such as cross-linking or chelation) will induce perovskite crystal growth and reduce the activation energy. Apart from this, small molecule additives can also be tailored with bifunctional groups, which are able to interact with multiple precursors, and can precisely induce the crystallization process at low temperature. Notably, a distorted 3D CsPbI3 phase (γ-CsPbI3) was found to appear at a low annealing temperature of 60 °C.69 Furthermore, Márquez et al. found that distorted γ-phase CsPbI3 can be synthesized directly at a low temperature (50 °C) under cesium iodine (CsI)-rich growth conditions.48 The resulting film exhibited an excellent carrier lifetime (longer than 70 ns) and high charge carrier mobility (above 60 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Solvent engineering is also a useful strategy for reducing the annealing temperature required for film fabrication. For example, Rao et al. used a room-temperature (RT) solvent annealing method involving DMSO solvent. The DMSO vapor molecules condensed on precursory perovskite grain boundaries to facilitate the dissolution and rearrangement of the perovskite grains, thereby catalyzing the growth of perovskite crystals. After further thermal annealing at 120 °C, a uniform and void-free CsPbI3 film was obtained (Fig. 3c), and a rigid pero-SC incorporating the CsPbI3 film delivered a PCE of 10.4%. Importantly, this low-temperature processing technology facilitated the growth of CsPbI3 on a plastic electrode (polyethylene terephthalate/indium tin oxide (PET/ITO)), and a solar cell fabricated with this electrode showed a PCE of 7.3% and high bending stability.61 The effects of different solvent vapors or mixed solvent vapors on perovskite crystal growth are worth exploring for further understanding of the process. Interestingly, the Liu group added DMSO to CsPbI2Br precursor solution, and the Lewis base DMSO-adduct formed provided a low-activation-energy route to form CsPbI2Br perovskite films, which resulted in the annealing temperature being reduced to 120 °C. The low-temperature-processed CsPbI2Br pero-SCs fabricated by the authors showed significantly improved PCEs of 13.54% and 11.73% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively.70 After that, they further used these adducts to fabricate large-scale CsPbI2Br pero-SCs by the blade-coating method in ambient air conditions.71 The negative influences from moisture and the Bénard–Marangoni convection in the drying ink layer were effectively reduced by keeping the blade-coating temperature at 80 °C. As a result, a uniform and pin-hole-free CsPbI2Br film was obtained after sequential 150 °C thermal annealing, giving a PCE of 12.5% at an area of 1.0 cm2. It is worth noting that the thermal annealing temperature was obviously decreased, and the related PCE was even higher than that of the 1.0 cm2 pero-SC (11.61%) based on spin-coating CsPbI2Br at an annealing temperature of 200 °C.72 Similarly, a CsPbI2Br submodule with an area of 25 cm2 was successfully fabricated at a low thermal annealing temperature of 160 °C, and the corresponding PCE is as high as 11.58%.73 These results indicate that a low thermal annealing temperature and high perovskite crystal quality are necessary for achieving high-performance large-scale all-inorganic pero-SCs. More recently, Liu et al. used 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the precursor solvent, which offered enhanced solubility for cesium lead halide precursors and weak coordination affinity for lead compounds. Under vacuum assistance, the NMP solvent was extracted from the film rapidly and a CsPbI2Br film was formed quickly but with a low crystallization rate. The CsPbI2Br film quality could be improved even at room temperature and in atmospheric conditions with this method,62 rendering the fabrication of flexible pero-SCs feasible. The flexible pero-SC fabricated by the authors not only achieved a PCE of 6.5% but also showed high bending durability, the device retaining about 80% of its initial PCE after 200 bending cycles with a radius of 4.05 mm (Fig. 3d). The solvent can not only dissolve the perovskite precursor, but also can act as a repairing agent and precisely control the used amount. Then, an adduct could be synthesized via the chemical reaction between the solvent and precursors, which consequently reduced the activation energy for the targeted perovskite. In addition, with the change of external environmental factors (temperature, atmosphere, pressure etc.), the physical properties of the solvent could be well optimized (boiling point, solubility etc.). Anyway, it is a challenging but interesting task to realize low-temperature-controlled growth of all-inorganic perovskites. A hot-substrate (maintained at 55 °C) deposition method was also investigated for lowering the post-annealing temperature in the fabrication of CsPbI2Br films to 120 °C, and a pero-SC based on a CsPbI2Br film prepared by the method showed a PCE of 12.5%, which was comparable with that of a device annealed at a high temperature (180 °C).74 Low-temperature-processed all-inorganic perovskites have attracted tremendous attention because of their continuously increasing PCE and low energy consumption. More importantly, a low-temperature process can potentially facilitate large-scale processing and the fabrication of flexible devices. However, such a process sacrifices energy consumption for crystal growth, and therefore it may not produce a high-quality perovskite film for achieving a significantly high PCE because of the trade-off between crystal quality and temperature to a certain extent.
3.2 Vacuum deposition
Vacuum deposition methods are usually performed in a vacuum chamber and involve the sublimation of precursors, such as metal halides. The precursors preliminarily react during the deposition process followed by a subsequent thermal annealing process to promote crystal growth. In these methods, the precursor ratio and deposition rate are critical factors influencing the final film morphology and quality because of their close relationship with the nucleation, growth, and composition of crystals. It should be noted that vacuum deposition has been demonstrated to be an effective method for obtaining high-quality perovskite films, and it offers advantages such as high uniformity, high reproducibility, and mature industrial fabrication facilities.78–81 In particular, this method does not require a solvent, eliminating the possibility of solvent damage to the underlying layer. Ma et al. were the first to use the dual-source vacuum evaporation method; they used it to deposit a CsPbIBr2 film. By synergistically controlling the preheated substrate temperature and post-annealing temperature, they achieved a crystal size that ranged up to one micrometer and compact morphology (Fig. 4a).75 It is important to study the nucleation and growth of perovskites during evaporation, and it is also meaningful to explore the grain changes during the post-annealing process. Chen et al. revealed the importance of the precursor stoichiometric molar ratio to the performance of inorganic pero-SCs.82 They fabricated pure iodine perovskite films by using accurately measured amounts of PbI2 and CsI and found that films with nonstoichiometric precursors displayed poor absorption ability, which limited the device performance. In their study, a stoichiometrically balanced CsPbI3-based solar cell delivered a highest PCE of 9.4%. Pioneers showed that mixed halide cesium-based perovskites were more stable than pure iodide CsPbI3 perovskites. Accordingly, they fabricated CsPbI2Br pero-SCs by co-depositing stoichiometrically balanced PbI2 and CsBr. Excitingly, an efficient all-vacuum-deposited CsPbI2Br pero-SC delivered a PCE of 11.8% and a Voc of 1.13 V and showed high stability. Later, Ma et al. intensively studied the effect of the stoichiometry on the stability of inorganic cesium lead mixed-halide pero-SCs. They found that the air stability of the CsPbI2Br film strongly depended on the deposition ratio (i.e., the molar ratio) of the precursors (CsBr and PbI2).83 A device containing a CsBr-rich perovskite film showed higher air stability because of a smaller grain size compared with the stoichiometric-precursor-based device; however, the PCE of the former device was lower. Through optimizing the excess amount of CsBr, they may improve the moisture stability of the device without sacrificing the efficiency. Later, we demonstrated that the co-evaporation rate of PbBr2 and CsBr with a stoichiometric ratio had a significant influence on the morphology of the resultant CsPbBr3 inorganic perovskite film.26 For a low co-evaporation rate, the CsPbBr3 film showed few defects, compact morphology, and a large grain size. The pero-SC based on the co-evaporated CsPbBr3 film achieved an increased PCE of 7.78%, a remarkable Voc of 1.44 V and robust UV stability. More importantly, in a four-terminal tandem solar cell, a semitransparent CsPbBr3 pero-SC could completely filter UV light and protect the bottom organic solar cell from being damaged; the tandem solar cell showed superior UV stability and a PCE of 14.03% (Fig. 4b). It is obvious that the precursor stoichiometric molar ratio is a prerequisite for the target perovskite, and a slower evaporation rate can ensure the full reaction between perovskite precursors to obtain high-quality films. However, as mentioned by Ma et al. above, non-stoichiometric films are more stable than stoichiometric films. This might be caused by the formation of by-products, and these by-products may have unique properties, such as excellent stability and superior conductivity. Hence, how to effectively control the formation and distribution of these by-products in perovskite films may have a certain potential value for the overall improvement of the film properties. Above all, the conventional vacuum deposition method used for fabricating high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films has been demonstrated to be controllable, and both the precursor ratio and evaporation rate play critical roles in realizing a high-performance device.

3.3 Antisolvent treatment
Among the various fabrication techniques for all-inorganic perovskite films, one-step solution deposition is the most common technique. However, the commonly used precursor solvents have a high boiling point, which is likely to reduce the evaporation rate during the spin-coating process. This may lead to nonuniform nucleation when a film with residual solvent is directly annealed at a high temperature, making it difficult to realize a pinhole-free film with uniform characteristics. Therefore, an antisolvent (ATS) with a relatively low boiling point, such as chlorobenzene (CB), toluene, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate (EA), is usually employed to promote perovskite nucleation and growth. In this technique, the precursor solubility in solution rapidly decreases, thereby accelerating the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite. Luo et al. fabricated black-phase CsPbI3 by dipping a yellow-brown-phase film (Cs4PbI6) in hot isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution and then thermally annealing it.65 The resultant film could maintain its phase stability over 72 h in ambient air conditions. Dong et al. used a green EA solvent with a low boiling point of 77 °C to fabricate a high-quality inorganic perovskite film.84 Compared with a film treated with the commonly used toxic antisolvent CB (boiling point: 132 °C), the EA-treated film showed more compact morphology and a larger grain size because of the small amount of EA residues in the precursor film, both of which facilitated perovskite crystal growth. Accordingly, a solar cell containing the EA-treated film showed better performance than that with a CB-treated film. In addition, the authors used a green ATS (ethanol) to treat a PbI2 precursor film and fabricated a porous PbI2(DMSO) film.76 The porous film was coated with multiple layers of CsBr to ensure interdiffusion for sufficient reaction between the PbI2 and the CsBr precursors. Compared with the EA-treated film, the ethanol-treated film exhibited higher porosity and randomly distributed crystals. These two features provided more diffusion paths and contact interfaces for the CsBr precursors, leading to a CsPbI2Br film with a highly pure phase, full coverage, large grain sizes, and high crystallinity (Fig. 4c). Pero-SCs based on this film achieved a champion PCE of 10.21%. However, we should mention that it is difficult to precisely control the reaction between a porous PbI2 film and CsBr; there may be some by-products or partially incomplete reaction during the reaction process. Recently, we used an ATS along with the gradient thermal annealing (GTA) method to precisely control the crystal growth process of a CsPbI2Br film.77 As illustrated in Fig. 4d, a CsPbI2Br film without ATS treatment showed irregular crystals and stripes along the edge because of the solvent edge effect. By contrast, ATS treatment could wash away the residual DMSO, which showed weak coordination with the CsPbI2Br precursor, resulting in the deposition of the perovskite precursor and its homogeneous dispersion on the substrate. We also found that an antisolvent with a low boiling point and high viscosity could improve the homogeneity of the CsPbI2Br precursor film; high homogeneity is a precondition for the formation of a high-quality α-CsPbI2Br film after the GTA process. When IPA was used as an ATS, a record PCE of 16.07% was achieved. More importantly, a device with the high-quality CsPbI2Br film showed dramatically improved device stability; 95% and 90% of its initial PCE were maintained after aging in ambient air conditions (30% humidity) for over 1000 h and under UV light irradiation for 120 h, respectively. Above all, although an ATS can contribute to crystal growth and morphology optimization, it usually has a very narrow operation window that is considerably influenced by the solvent component and external conditions.85 Therefore, while on the one hand more efforts should be focused on developing an ATS processing technology for highly repeatable fabrication, on the other hand green ATSs with high universality should be identified for future practical application.
3.4 Tuning the precursor solution composition
The solvent in solution-processed all-inorganic perovskites plays a particularly important role in the film quality. As discussed above, ATS treatment has been used to eliminate the effect of the residual solvent on crystal growth. Actually, the rate and uniformity of solvent evaporation are closely related to the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals during the film forming process.88 It is well known that precursors of inorganic perovskites (cesium halides and lead halides) are usually dissolved in a polar solvent, namely, DMF, DMSO, NMP or a mixture of these solvents. Zhang et al. found that the volume ratio between DMF and DMSO could dramatically influence the crystallization and morphology of CsPbI2Br films;86 the DMSO molecule and CsI coordinated with PbX2 to form an intermediate, PbX2–DMSO–CsI (Fig. 5a). The intermediate released DMSO gradually during the annealing step, promoting the crystallization of high-quality perovskite films.89 A solvent with high hydrophobic DMSO content could reduce adhesion to the substrate,90 which was likely to result in the formation of a poor-quality all-inorganic perovskite film with voids and a small crystal size. When the volume ratio of the DMSO solvent was 40%, the DMSO/DMF mixture showed balanced properties in terms of both coordination and wettability, which were beneficial for high-quality CsPbI2Br film growth. It is worth mentioning that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of solvents on a substrate have a great influence on the subsequent crystal growth process, which will be thoroughly discussed in Section 4.1. Bai et al. demonstrated that the precursor solution temperature had a significant effect on crystallization, including the nucleation process and crystal growth rate.87 Depositing the precursor solution at 100 °C reduced the number of CsPbI2Br nuclei. This implied that the CsPbI2Br had considerable space to grow, which was favorable for the formation of large-grain crystals and a thick film (Fig. 5b). Finally, a CsPbI2Br solar cell fabricated in the study exhibited a PCE as high as 14.81% and showed negligible PCE degradation under the operating conditions employed (25 °C and a relative humidity (RH) of 25–35%). The solvent temperature has an influence on the crystallization thermodynamics and solvent evaporation rate, which are related to the crystal nucleation and growth process, respectively.

(d) Optical images of CsPbI2Br films with and without DMSO adducts stored in a glovebox for different times. Reproduced from ref. 72 with permission from (2018) Wiley-VCH. 
The precursor species also plays a critical role in the fabrication of high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films. Cs-Based precursors such as CsBr are known to have poor solubility in commonly used polar solvents, and this considerably limits the perovskite film thickness, resulting in a film with insufficient light absorption and low current density.91 To overcome this issue, Jiang et al. investigated a new precursor pair, cesium acetate (CsAc) and hydrogen lead trihalide (HPbX3). This precursor pair enabled the precursor solution concentration to be increased up to 1.3 M. Such a high concentration facilitated the formation of a thick perovskite film showing sufficient light absorption.38 Further, by adding large-radius organic cations of phenylethylammonium (PEA) into the precursor solution, the researchers doped a reduced-dimensionality (quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D)) perovskite into 3D CsPbI3. The doped 3D CsPbI3 could suppress the undesirable phase transition, and consequently a state-of-the-art PCE of 12.4% was obtained for quasi-2D CsPbI3-based pero-SCs with high storage stability (Fig. 5c). Recently, Yin et al. employed the Lewis base adducts PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) as precursors (Fig. 5d) to achieve a high precursor concentration.72 The adducts slowed the rapid reaction and reduced the crystal nuclei density. Owing to the lower activation energy of the grain boundaries in the DMSO-adducted precursors, the nuclei showed a low growth rate. This allowed more time for crystal growth, and the resulting crystal showed large grain sizes and low defect densities.92 A pero-SC based on this CsPbI2Br film showed tremendously improved stability in ambient air conditions compared with a device without DMSO adducts, and a remarkable PCE of 14.78% was achieved. Through applying different precursor species, the solubility of the precursors was increased for a thick film, and the nucleation growth process was optimized for a high-quality film simultaneously. Based on this, it should be considered that the properties of the introduced functional groups (such as the group size, volatility, physicochemical properties, etc.) in the new precursors have an influence on the crystallization kinetics, including the nucleation and growth process.
The precursor ratio is a key factor in solution composition engineering. Deviation from a stoichiometric ratio may influence the passivation behavior. Liu's group has been focusing on improving the efficiency of CsPbI2Br pero-SCs over the past two years by following stoichiometric rules.87,93–95 The researchers found that a nonstoichiometric precursor also had a positive role in reducing defects in all-inorganic perovskite films. Li et al. fabricated a CsPbBr3 film by adding a slightly excess amount of PbBr2 to the precursor solution.96 They observed that a derivative CsPb2Br5 phase formed at the CsPbBr3 crystal grain boundary effectively passivated surface and boundary defects. As a result, the CsPbBr3 film formed showed enhanced electron-transporting ability. Similarly, excess CsI introduced in the CsPbI3 precursor solution promoted the formation of a heterostructure consisting of zero-dimensional (0D) Cs4PbI6 and 3D CsPbI3. The 0D Cs4PbI6 was suggested to surround black-phase CsPbI3 grains and to thereby passivate defects and enhance the phase stability.97 As mentioned above in the vacuum deposition section, a nonstoichiometric precursor sometimes plays an important role in further improving the film performance, but the key factor lies in the deep understanding of the distribution and properties of the by-products.
Above all, the quality of solution-processed all-inorganic perovskite films is affected by many factors other than the precursor solution composition, and they include the solvent type, solution temperature, precursor species, and the precursor ratio. All these not only determine the perovskite film thickness, but also influence the crystallization process. Therefore, precisely controlling the precursor solution composition is particularly important for obtaining high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films.
3.5 Controlling the crystal growth process
Apart from optimizing the solution composition, tremendous work has been devoted to controlling the subsequent growth of all-inorganic perovskite crystals. Kulbak et al. developed a precisely controlled method to produce high-quality CsPbBr3 perovskite films.99 They first spin-coated a single PbBr2 layer and thermally annealed it. The PbBr2 layer was then dipped face up in a heated (50 °C) CsBr solution for further reaction, and the resultant CsPbBr3 film was treated with IPA, dried with N2, and annealed at a high temperature for crystal growth. The growth process of the CsPbBr3 crystal was precisely controlled, and a device based on this film showed a PCE of 5.95%, which was the highest PCE for a CsPbBr3-based solar cell at that time. Later, Liang et al. further optimized this fabrication process and obtained a dense and uniform CsPbBr3 film. By coating a carbon electrode on the film, they achieved a higher PCE of 6.7%, as well as outstanding thermal and moisture stability.24 Although the above studies improved the PCE, Teng et al. found that the PbBr2 film dipped in the CsBr solution rapidly reacted with the solution, resulting in CsBr being deposited on the film. This deteriorated the perovskite morphology. In addition, the formed CsPbBr3 precursor film easily decomposed before completely transforming to the CsPbBr3 phase.98 In order to address this issue, the researchers adopted a face-down growth method that could effectively suppress the decomposition of CsPbBr3 films through liquid-space restriction (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the CsPbBr3 film formed with this method showed smooth and uniform morphology with larger grains, which could significantly increase the performance of devices based on the film. Although the face-down dipping method could improve the perovskite quality, the film formation process was cumbersome and difficult to control, which limited its practical application. Recently, Duan et al. investigated a multistep spinning method for preparing CsPbBr3 films.27 By varying the number of CsBr coatings on a PbBr2 layer, they found that the purity of the CsPbBr3 film could be significantly improved when four coatings were provided (Fig. 6b). By further optimizing the surface energy level, they achieved a PCE of 9.72% and a Voc of 1.458 V for a CsPbBr3 all-inorganic pero-SC, which considerably exceeded the performance of previously reported devices. It is noteworthy that the multistep spinning method has high reproducibility and is widely used for fabricating CsPbBr3 films, and recently the PCE has exceeded 10% with an ultrahigh Voc of ∼1.6 V.100–103 Recently, Yu et al. further optimized this method104 by replacing the PbBr2 layer with a PbBr2/PbI2 composite layer. The precursor solution was obtained by dissolving the precursors in a DMSO/DMF mixture. The PbBr2/PbI2 layer was dried under vacuum conditions to remove the residual solvent, and subsequently DMSO was doped into CsBr methanol solution to increase the CsBr solubility. The PbBr2/PbI2 layer was made to spin, and the obtained precursor solution was dripped onto the spinning layer. Finally, a compact and pinhole-free CsPbBr3 perovskite film was obtained. The small amount of DMSO not only improved the solubility of CsBr, but also helped CsBr penetrate the PbI2/PbBr2 film, which increased the reaction efficiency. Excitingly, a PCE as high as 13.27% was achieved with this optimized method. Zhu et al. proposed a facile intermolecular exchange strategy for promoting CsPbIBr2 crystal growth. The strategy involved spin-coating CsI solution onto a CsPbIBr2 precursor film.105 Compared with the conventional one-step solution route, this strategy could produce a more compact and pinhole-free film with the preferred (100) orientation. Pero-SCs based on this intermolecular exchange CsPbIBr2 film not only showed an enhanced PCE but also exhibited improved device stability and could maintain 90% and 97% of the initial PCE in ambient air conditions (45% humidity) for over 60 days and at 85 °C for over 7 days, respectively. There are various methods for controlling crystal growth, and it is particularly important to select a suitable method based on the composition of the all-inorganic perovskite. For example, for the CsPbBr3 system, it is better to use two-step or multi-step methods due to the poor solubility of the precursors. Subsequently, in order to further improve the film quality, one or two precursors could be modified for full reaction between precursors. As for the other CsPbX3 systems, a one-step solution method was preferred following the orthogonal solvent principle, and the uniform mixing of precursors can also ensure film uniformity.

3.6 Post-treatment
Usually, an inorganic perovskite film can hardly exhibit perfect morphology even when the crystallization process is carefully controlled. Because a precursor solvent such as DMSO has a high boiling point and is not easily volatilized during the spin-coating process, the film can be effectively improved through ATS treatment. Interestingly, the residual DMSO has been found to enhance the mass transport and diffusion of precursors, which enhances the film quality for a relatively low evaporation rate. Wang et al. used a solvent-controlled growth (SCG) method to fabricate CsPbI3 films (Fig. 7a).106 A key step was to hold up the as-prepared film for several tens of minutes before thermal annealing. This post-treatment provided sufficient time for the vertical mass transport of the precursors in the CsPbI3 film, which resulted in pinhole-free morphology and the formation of grains with a size as large as five micrometers. A pero-SC based on this film showed a significantly high PCE of 15.7% and could tolerate continuous light soaking over 500 h. At the same time, Zhang et al. employed a hot-air-flow (HAF) post-treatment that caused uniform rapid heating of the perovskite film and induced DMSO to rapidly volatize in the vertical direction.107 A wide processing window, including a large range of solvent components (DMSO fraction ranging from 15% to 55%) and precursor concentrations (0.7–1.2 M), could be employed for a CsPbI2Br film by optimizing the vapor pressure (Fig. 7b). A high PCE, up to 12.52%, was achieved with a remarkable Voc of 1.315 V. Apparently, the above methods show that post-treatment can significantly enhance the vertical mass transport of precursors. While the role of precursor mass transport in the horizontal direction is always neglected, it plays an equally important role in the fabrication of uniform films. Zai et al. prolonged the spin-coating time as post-treatment and observed an enhanced driving force of crystallization in the horizontal direction.108 This process induced precursor mass transport in the horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously, thereby promoting the formation of a high-quality film. By incorporating a CsPbI2Br film fabricated with this strategy in pero-SCs, a stable PCE of 14.31% was achieved along with remarkable light and thermal stability. We may assume that each detail in the experiment has a scientific basis.

The temperature and duration of the post-thermal annealing process have been found to considerably affect the perovskite film quality. For the CsPbI2Br film, Nam et al. revealed that a high annealing temperature of 280 °C could dramatically enhance crystallization, resulting in a defect-free all-inorganic perovskite film.109 Sutton et al. investigated a two-step post-thermal annealing method for cesium lead halide CsPbIxBr3−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) perovskites. For I-rich films, successive annealing at 250 and 350 °C increased the perovskite film quality.23 Recently, many studies have investigated the effect of the post-thermal annealing temperature on the characteristics of perovskites, including the iodine bromide content, additives, solution composition, and other conditions discussed above. The post-thermal annealing temperature has been varied from room temperature up to temperatures beyond 300 °C.60,62,106,110 This wide temperature range can be ascribed to the superior thermal stability of all-inorganic perovskites.42 Studies have also varied the post-thermal annealing duration. Gao et al. annealed a CsPbI2Br precursor film for just 10 s at 240 °C on a hot plate,111 while Zhu et al. aged a CsPbIBr2 precursor film for three weeks before annealing it at 100 °C on a hot plate.112 Interestingly, both methods yielded high-quality inorganic perovskite films, indicating that all-inorganic perovskites have a wide thermal annealing window owing to their superior thermal stability. Recently, we developed a gradient thermal annealing method to address the issue of nonuniformity.77 By simultaneously controlling the annealing temperature and annealing time, we fabricated a high-purity uniform α-CsPbI2Br film. Although a large number of annealing methods are available for fabricating high-quality inorganic perovskite films, future efforts should focus on developing annealing methods that can further improve the device performance.
4. Substrate engineering
Evidently, the quality of all-inorganic perovskites is considerably influenced by their internal condition, as discussed above. Owing to their sensitivity, the crystal growth process may be affected by the external environment. For example, in Fig. 8a, the perovskite grown on bare TiO2 exhibits many exposed cracks and pinholes. These defects can be removed by modifying TiO2 with SmBr3, and the perovskite grown on the modified TiO2 shows a homogeneous and fully covered morphology.113 This suggests that substrate properties such as wettability and roughness may also influence all-inorganic perovskite crystallization. We present a detailed discussion on the relationship between the substrate properties and crystallization.

4.1 Substrate wettability
As mentioned above, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the substrate have a great influence on the nucleation and crystal growth. Yang et al. developed an In2S3 electron transport layer (ETL) by using the chemical bath deposition method.114 The wettability of the ETL differed with the deposition duration, and an 85 min-deposited In2S3 film exhibited the smallest contact angle. When CsPbIBr2 was grown on the 85 minute-deposited In2S3 ETL, a CsPbIBr2 film with uniform and compact morphology was obtained. This suggested that a high-wettability ETL surface could facilitate all-inorganic perovskite growth. The reduced Gibbs free energy of the surface promoted the formation of a heterogeneous and pinhole-free perovskite film (Fig. 8b). Although a wettable substrate is beneficial for nucleus formation, the presence of too many nuclei reduces the crystal size because of the limited growth space. Moreover, the number of grain boundaries increases with the number of nuclei, and this would inevitably increase nonradiative recombination.117 In order to optimize the substrate wettability, Tian et al. coated a hydrophobic amino-functionalized polymer film, PN4N, onto a SnO2 layer;115 the film was expected to reduce the substrate hydrophilicity to a certain extent. As expected, the number of CsPbI2Br perovskite nuclei was suppressed, providing considerable space for crystal growth (Fig. 8c), and the resultant CsPbI2Br film exhibited high crystallization with a low defect density. A pero-SC based on the film could attain a PCE as high as 16.2% (Table 2). Therefore, the substrate wettability has a significant effect on the number of nuclei and subsequent crystal growth, and it is a non-negligible external factor determining the all-inorganic pero-SC performance.

We note that more than 90% of published studies on all-inorganic perovskite films grew the films on n-type metal oxides, which have a highly wettable surface compared with p-type metal oxides and organic hole transport layers.37,118–121 This phenomenon can probably explain the relatively low efficiency of inverted structure devices (less than 16%). The rational modification of an organic HTL interface can facilitate the growth of all-inorganic perovskite films with an inverted structure.122 In addition, surfactants have been employed to alter the fluid drying dynamics of solution-processed perovskites for enhancing their adhesion to non-wettable substrates.123 For the fabrication of large-area all-inorganic perovskite films, a substrate with good wettability is particularly important to achieve large-scale uniformity.
4.2 Substrate roughness
The substrate roughness is another key factor that influences the film morphology. Guo et al. treated an SnO2 film with SnCl2 solution.124 Consequently, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the SnO2 film decreased from 7.05 nm to 4.21 nm, possibly because of the passivation effect of SnCl2. SnCl2 treatment also effectively prevented the aggregation of SnO2 nanocrystals during the thermal annealing process. It was also found that the resultant smooth surface enhanced the transmittance of the ETL because of its low reflectivity and facilitated the growth of a high-quality CsPbIBr2 film with compact morphology. As expected, the PCE of a pero-SC based on the film increased considerably from 4.73% to 7.00%, and it was accompanied by a high Voc of 1.31 V. Similarly, the passivation of the ETL surface for reducing the RMS roughness was demonstrated by Liu et al. They coated a SnO2 layer obtained from SnCl2·2H2O ethanol solution onto a TiO2 layer (Fig. 8d).116 These authors also found that an ETL with a low RMS was beneficial for providing electrical contact between the ETL and a perovskite film. Providing electrical contact would enhance the charge carrier transport. The grain size of CsPbBr3 grown on the bilayer ETL reached 1.18 μm, which was consistent with the findings of previous work that a low-roughness substrate was favorable for all-inorganic perovskite crystallization.125 On the basis of this strategy, a PCE as high as 8.79% was realized. In addition, the improved CsPbBr3 showed robust moisture and thermal stability, and no degradation was observed after storing it in ambient air for over 1000 h and at 60 °C for a month. It can be concluded that a substrate with low roughness is beneficial to subsequent perovskite growth since it increases the interface contact, the grain size, and crystallization and reduces charge recombination. For further reducing the RMS roughness of the substrate, maybe we can fabricate another small particle layer to fill the gap of the transporting layer, or we can optimize the size of nanoparticles, thus realizing improved charge mobility and reduced surface roughness, simultaneously.
5. Doping engineering
Doping engineering is a critical factor determining the performance of all-inorganic pero-SCs, including A-, B-, and X-site doping and organic component doping. To obtain a black-phase CsPbX3 perovskite, the value of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor should be in the range of 0.8 to 1 as mentioned above. When the value is less than 0.8, the A site is too small for perovskite formation.126 Usually, the incorporation of large cations at A sites and ions with smaller radii at the B and X sites will increase the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which in turn increases the perovskite lattice stability.127 In addition, organic component doping has a great influence on the crystal quality, even improving the perovskite lattice stability, depending on their functional groups and the interactions. Hence, the choice of species at A, B, and X sites and doped organic components affects the crystal growth, which is the theme of this section, and thereby influences the associated device performance.
5.1 A-site doping
Nam et al. added potassium cations to the precursor solution to fabricate a CsPbI2Br film.131 Clear shifts in the binding energy in X-ray photoelectron spectra demonstrated that potassium cations, which have a smaller radius than cesium cations, could be successfully used to dope a perovskite lattice; they would be introduced at the A sites. Such doping would lead to a decrease in the PbX6 octahedral volume, thereby enhancing the phase stability. Moreover, this doping method is beneficial for improving the perovskite film and providing it with smooth morphology and large crystals. Li et al. investigated the effect of alkali metal cations doped in a cesium lead halide crystal lattice.128 Because of the smaller radius of the alkali metal cations, a consistent result was observed: a larger grain size was achieved and charge recombination was suppressed (Fig. 9a). A pero-SC based on a Rb-cation-doped Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 film exhibited a PCE up to 9.86% and robust stability, and the PCE was almost unchanged after aging over 700 hours in an 80% relative humidity atmosphere, ascribed to the slightly reduced Eg and high-quality crystals (Table 3).

5.2 B-site doping

5.2.1 Effect on morphology. 
As discussed in Section 5.1, an A-site doped cation with a smaller radius can increase the grain size and decrease the crystal lattice volume and thereby enhance the crystal phase stability. For B-site doping, it has been found that a cation with a smaller radius than Pb2+ (119 pm) has the opposite effect on the film morphology. The resultant small grain size as well as a slightly decreased Eg plays a critical role in the formation of stable black-phase perovskites by the B-site doping method. For example, in a study, Bi3+ (103 pm) was incorporated at the B-sites of the CsPbI3 lattice. The resulting perovskite showed a reduced crystal size, which indicated the formation of a stabilized black phase, and a pero-SC with this perovskite delivered a PCE of 13.21%.132 A similar strategy was used for a CsPbI2Br system by Liu et al., who used smaller-radius In3+ (80 pm) as the dopant at the B sites of CsPbI2Br.118 With an increase in the doping amount, the grain size tended to decrease, which might be ascribed to multiple order crystal orientation growth. This behavior facilitated charge transport in multiple directions (Fig. 9b). As a result, InCl3:CsPbI2Br pero-SCs exhibited a PCE of 13.74% for a small-area device and a PCE of 11.4% for a square-centimeter-scale device. The researchers also found that B-site doping can increase the stability of the perovskite lattice because of the increase in the tolerance factor, and a pero-SC based on the doped perovskite showed an almost unchanged PCE after being aged for 80 h in air (30% humidity), and slight degradation after thermal annealing at 60 °C for 100 h. In another study, the precursor solution was doped with 30% of Ge2+ (73 pm). As expected, the resultant CsPb0.7Ge0.3I2Br film showed a smaller crystal grain size and smoother morphology, which could induce lattice strain to stabilize the black phase and enhance the performance of devices by providing better interfacial contact with the HTL.133 The use of much smaller Nb5+ cations (64 pm) as the dopant in the CsPbI2Br system was also found to reduce the crystal size and film roughness, and this could be attributed to the lower viscosity of the precursor solution containing Nb5+ resulting in enhanced mass transfer.134
Apart from reducing the crystal size for achieving high phase stability, the substitution of smaller-radius cations at the B sites can also repair pinholes and optimize the film morphology. For example, in a study, Zn2+ (74 pm) was employed to partially replace Pb2+ in CsPbI2Br. The researchers found that Zn2+, which shows higher chemical activity than Pb2+, could slow the crystallization process, increasing the time available for crystal reconstruction. Consequently, the fully grown CsPbI2Br exhibited a larger grain size and a negligible number of pinholes (Fig. 9c).129 Upon the addition of 10% Zn2+, the resultant CsPb0.9Zn0.1I2Br pero-SCs exhibited an improved PCE of 13.6% compared with 11.8% for the undoped CsPbI2Br device. Excitingly, the doping of even 0.25% of Ca2+ (100 pm) in the CsPbI3 precursor solution reduced pinholes and facilitated the fabrication of a compact all-inorganic perovskite film. This trace doping method can also enhance crystallization, which is beneficial for the photovoltaic performance.69 Liang et al. showed that incorporating Mn2+ (67 pm) in a CsPbIBr2 film could lead to vertical branches on the surface of the perovskite film (Fig. 9d). These vertical branches protrude into the upper carbon electrode to increase the contact area and thereby facilitate hole transfer.130


5.2.2 Effect on nucleation. 
The effect of B-site doping on the morphology originates from the crystallization process, which is largely determined by the nucleation. Bai et al. found that Mn2+ dissolved in the precursor solution did not dope the CsPbI2Br lattice. Instead, it occupied the interstices of crystals, and this was evidenced by the expansion of the crystalline lattice. This state of Mn2+ suppressed nucleation and decreased the crystal growth rate (Fig. 10a), and it led to the grain size of CsPbI2Br crystals increasing to 1.2 μm.135 This result is contrast to the Mn2+ doping mentioned in the “Effect on morphology” section, which may be ascribed to the different doping amount and fabrication methods. More efforts should be devoted to investigating the mechanism of element doping into the film morphology. Recently, Duan et al. attempted to dope a CsPbBr3 lattice by using B-site ions.103 They found that lanthanide ions with a gradually changing ionic radius could induce larger colloidal seeds when dissolved in CsPbBr3 precursor solutions (Fig. 10b) because of the strong interaction between Ln3+ and Br−. These colloidal seeds capped with Ln3+ could serve as nuclei in the subsequent crystal growth process, leading to a larger crystal size and compact morphology. This strategy helped increase the PCE of the CsPbBr3 solar cell beyond 10%. More excitingly, the device showed negligible degradation when aged in an 80% RH atmosphere over 110 days and at 80 °C over 60 days. Ba2+ can also be incorporated into the lattice of CsPbIBr2, and it facilitates the formation of colloidal seeds in the precursor solution, Therefore, this ion can be used for increasing the crystal size and decreasing the perovskite film roughness.51 Optimizing the size and number of colloids may further benefit the nucleation process. As expected, a pero-SC based on a CsPb(Ba)IBr2 active layer showed a PCE of 10.51%. The addition of copper(II) bromide (CuBr2) to the precursor solution was found to induce lattice distortion owing to the smaller atomic radius of Cu compared with that of Pb. CuBr2 was found to effectively suppress the nucleation rate during the annealing process, resulting in a larger crystal grain size and fully covered morphology.138 A CsPbI2Br pero-SC exhibited a remarkable PCE of 16.15%. Thus, it can be concluded that the optimization of the nucleus formation process can facilitate the fabrication of all-inorganic perovskite films exhibiting uniform morphology and superior performance.

5.2.3 Effect on surface oxide. 
Apart from influencing the film morphology and nucleation process, some B-site doping metals have been found to enrich the upper surface of perovskite films, forming an oxide layer and passivating the surface. For example, when strontium cations (Sr2+) were added to the precursor solution, snowflake-like particles appeared on the perovskite film surface, possibly because of the oxidation of Sr. The formed SrO was demonstrated to passivate the surface, thereby increasing the charge carrier lifetime (Fig. 10c).136 Similarly, when Ca2+ was used as a dopant, it was found to be oxidized and to form an oxide layer (CaO) on the perovskite film surface as a result of the reaction between Ca2+ and DMSO or H2O in DMF. CaO, which has a wider bandgap than PbI2, provided surface passivation similar to that provided by excess PbI2.139 A pero-SC based on CsPb0.995Ca0.005I3 exhibited a stable PCE of 13.3%. Although the above oxides formed at the perovskite surface passivated the surface, leading to an increased carrier lifetime, their intrinsic insulating nature seriously inhibits the carrier-transporting ability of the perovskite film, thereby hampering the device performance.

5.3 X-site doping
As mentioned above, the X site of an inorganic pero-SC generally comprises iodine, bromine, or a mixture of these elements, and the ionic radii of I− and Br− are 2.20 and 1.96 Å, respectively. By varying the ratio I/Br, we can easily tune the absorbance onset and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of all-inorganic perovskites as mentioned in Section 2. In this section, halogens with a smaller radius (Cl and F) have been used to dope CsPbX3 to fine tune the crystal structure and phase stability. Li et al. used PbCl2 to dope the CsPbBr3 precursor solution. The chloride ion, which has a small radius, can act as a crystal structure controller for the phase transition of CsPbBr3 from orthorhombic to cubic. Moreover, the chloride ion can be also used to promote CsPbBr3 film growth for realizing a film with a fully covered surface and uniform crystal size distribution.140 A similar strategy was employed for another CsPbX3 system. Fu et al. introduced fluorine (F) ions at the X-sites of the CsPbI2Br perovskite to modulate the phase.141 Two α and δ phases were found to form a heterojunction structure, which was beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. Furthermore, greater coverage and fewer pinholes were observed with an increase in the F content. A pero-SC based on CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 showed a 20% increase in the PCE. In the case of the CsPbI3 system, doping with Cl ions optimized the crystallization dynamics and improved the surface morphology and crystal orientation (Fig. 10d).137 A remarkable PCE of 16.07% was obtained for the γ-phase CsPbI3, and the device showed negligible efficiency loss under continuous light soaking for 200 h. Recently, You et al. incorporated Cl ions into the CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite and improved the phase stability. Consequently, the black phase could be maintained for 120 h in ambient air with 40% RH. With the assistance of LiF interface modification, a remarkable PCE of 18.64% was achieved.142 Although some studies reported that F and Cl could participate in the all-inorganic perovskite lattice, thereby increasing the tolerance factor for enhanced stability, different opinions assumed that their atomic radius was too small to support the octahedral structure. Anyway, these atoms play a critical role in tuning the phase structure, thereby stabilizing the crystal lattice. Additionally, they were also used to optimize the crystallization process and improve the crystal quality. More efforts should be devoted to determining the distribution of X-site doping elements through lattice parameters and theoretical simulations.
5.4 Organic component doping
All-inorganic perovskites are expected to exhibit higher thermal stability compared with hybrid perovskites. However, the cubic phase (black phase) of CsPbX3 tends to transform to the orthorhombic phase at room temperature when the iodine content is increased, especially for CsPbI3 since the tolerance factor approached the lower limit (t = 0.8). Several methods, as mentioned above, have been investigated to stabilize the black phase and improve the morphology, and they include component doping, solvent engineering, and interface engineering. Recently, the use of organic components with specific functionalities has been investigated for stabilizing the cubic phase of CsPbX3. The perovskite has been doped with an organic component, and such doping has been found to form a low-dimensional component, suppress the octahedral tilting, lower the surface energy, and reduce the crystal grain size.
Zhang et al. used a trace 2D EDAPbI4 perovskite containing ethylenediamine (EDA) cations to stabilize the black phase of CsPbI3, following which the perovskite could be maintained at room temperature for several months.39 They found that EDAPbI4 may connect the crystallites, thereby facilitating carrier transfer and passivating defects. This strategy led to an increase in the PCE from 7.66% to 11.8%. Furthermore, organic components with steric hindrance groups such as 2,4-dibutoxy phenyl have been found to suppress the octahedral tilting of [PbI6]4− units in cubic CsPbI3 (Fig. 11a). The steric hindrance groups maintained the linearity of Pb–I–Pb bonds, preventing lattice distortion and increasing the energy barrier of phase transition.121 The effect of the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on CsPbI3 crystallization was investigated in a previous study. PVP molecules with a large number of acylamino groups were found to be anchored at the surface of CsPbI3, providing more coordination polymer units for interactions between oxygen, nitrogen in the acylamino groups, and cesium ions of the inorganic perovskite. With the growth of CsPbI3, the interactions between N–CO of the acylamino groups and Cs+ of the inorganic perovskite increased. This led to an increase in the negative field in the Cs+–PVP complex and the electron cloud around Cs+ of CsPbI3. The increase in the electron cloud density could lead to low surface tension, which would then considerably reduce the surface energy of CsPbI3 and stabilize the cubic CsPbI3 (Fig. 11b).143 Ding et al. found that a small amount of the triple cation NH3+C2H4NH2+C2H4NH3+ (DETA3+) could stabilize α-phase CsPbI3 because of the following effects of organic components:41 (1) a reduction in the grain size, (2) suppression of octahedral tilting at the surface or grain boundary of the CsPbI3 perovskite, and (3) an increase in surface hydrophobicity. Later, a series of phenylethylammonium derivatives, including phenylethylammonium chlorine (PEACl),94 phenylethylammonium iodide,66 and phenylethylammonium (PEA),144,145 were investigated, and all of them were found to be effective for stabilizing the CsPbX3 perovskite.

Some strategies involving the use of organic components for stabilizing the morphology of all-inorganic perovskites have been investigated. Lu et al. introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) into a CsPbI2Br film to serve as a supporting matrix.146 It was found that the perovskite crystal aggregation was restrained because of the reduced crystal growth rate, and a film with uniform and pinhole-free morphology was realized. Wang et al. incorporated CsXth into the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbIBr2, and the doped CsXth was completely decomposed into sulfides during the thermal annealing process (Fig. 11c).43 The obtained sulfides had strong coordination with CsPbIBr2, facilitating perovskite growth with a compact and negligible grain boundary. The resulting perovskite showed high ambient air (RH of 65%) stability. We may assume that organic component doping benefits the phase stabilization of inorganic perovskites and improves the film quality. It is vital to understand the effects of specific functional groups of organic components on the stability of the perovskite phase and crystallization kinetics. If organic component doping is combined with the above-mentioned crystal growth methods, it will certainly be able to further improve the film quality.
6. Surface engineering
Although the above methodologies are effective for controlling the crystal growth of inorganic perovskite films, the presence of surface defects, including vacancies, interstitials, and antisite defects (known as trap states), can induce surface charge recombination, thereby degrading the device performance. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient methods or interface layer materials to further optimize the surface composition and surface defects of all-inorganic perovskite films.
6.1 Secondary growth
Generally, an as-grown perovskite film exhibits poor crystallization and a high surface trap density. Secondary growth methods have been proposed for crystal rearrangement and surface/bulk composition optimization for improving the perovskite film quality and device performance.149

6.1.1 Organic halide assisted secondary growth. 
There is an efficient method to engineer an inorganic perovskite film surface by using an organic halide. Xue et al. treated a crystallized CsPbI2Br thin film with ammonium iodide isopropanol solution. The treated perovskite film showed a larger grain size, which can be attributed to the secondary grain growth process, which can decrease the surface energy of the crystal facet to provide the driving force for surface anisotropy. The resultant highly anharmonic lattice with low-frequency modes and a small elastic modulus made the perovskite highly “flowable”, which facilitated perovskite grain growth in a favorable direction to reduce the energy of the entire system. A remarkable PCE of 16.58% was obtained (Table 4).150 Zhao et al. used phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) to treat a CsPbI3 film surface. The treatment led to the Br/I ion-exchange reaction between PTABr and CsPbI3 crystals, and residual phenyltrimethylammonium organic cations anchored on the CsPbI3 crystal surfaces, protecting the surfaces from moisture attack (Fig. 12a). A void-free CsPbI3 film with a larger grain size was obtained by this synergistic effect.147 A PCE of 17.06% was obtained with the film, which showed enhanced α-phase stability. By replacing PTABr with phenyltrimethylammonium chloride (PTACl), the researchers further increased the PCE to a remarkable value of 19.03%, which is the highest PCE reported for all-inorganic pero-SCs so far.28 Recently, a secondary growth method was used to construct a 2D/3D heterostructure based on the inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br. The researchers added a small amount of DMSO to butylammonium iodide (BAI) solutions for the post-treatment of the grown CsPbI2Br film. The DMSO dissolved a thin layer of the 3D CsPbI2Br film, which enabled the film to undergo a cation exchange process involving BAI. The process led to the formation of 2D perovskites in the surface region. A 2D/3D CsPbI2Br pero-SC showed a PCE of 14.5% with significantly enhanced stability.151 We can assume that the small amount of DMSO can not only repair the pinholes, but also dissolve the organic halide for secondary growth. Through this methodology, maybe we can reasonably locate the distribution of the secondary growth component.

6.1.2 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite assisted secondary growth. 
Another method is organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite assisted secondary growth. As shown in Fig. 12b, Shao et al. added a certain amount of MAX to the CsPbX3 precursor solution, which made the as-formed perovskite film absorb MA gas more rapidly. By this method, the Cs-based perovskite structure was likely to transform into a liquid intermediate phase that would facilitate perovskite film growth with a smooth surface.152 After the subsequent thermal annealing process, the sacrificial organic component further induced an Ostwald ripening process that promoted a more uniform and compact film.148 With this strategy, the PCE of a CsPbI2Br solar cell was improved from 10.0% to 13.1%. Ho-Baillie et al. reported a simple cation exchange growth method for fabricating high-purity CsPbI3 films by adding the MAI additive (CsI:MAI molar ratio of 1:1) to the precursor solution. MAPbI3 was first formed at 100 °C and it acted as a perovskite template to induce CsPbI3 growth. With an increase in the thermal annealing temperature, cation exchange occurred whereby the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 were replaced by Cs+. This process produced a high-quality CsPbI3 film.153 Hybrid perovskite assisted secondary growth is novel but lacks simplicity, where the crystal growth and cation exchange processes require precise control. Maybe we can substitute the hybrid perovskite with some other volatile component with no crystallization, which will simplify the secondary growth process.


6.1.3 Precursor assisted secondary growth. 
Precursors can be also used to assist the secondary growth of all-inorganic perovskite films. Parida et al. incorporated Br− into a CsPbI3 lattice by dynamically spin-coating CsBr solution onto a room-temperature-dried CsPbI3 precursor film. The surface morphology and crystallinity of the resultant CsPbI3−xBrx (x < 0.7) film were greatly improved, and this led to reduced trap densities at the grain boundary,154 which was beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite phase. A vacuum evaporation method was also investigated for reconstructing the perovskite surface composition. CsBr evaporated on an as-grown Pb(Ac)2-doped CsPbI2Br surface reacted with the excess Pb at grain boundaries. As expected, a passivation effect occurred at the grain boundaries, effectively reducing CsPbI2Br defects and nonradiative recombination in the related device. A remarkable PCE of 16.37% was obtained together with a Voc of 1.27 V.155
These secondary growth strategies demonstrated that crystal rearrangement across the entire film or film surface is critical for improving the all-inorganic perovskite film quality. Based on the above discussion, we propose to grow a wide-bandgap film on a narrow-bandgap perovskite, which may effectively improve the stability of the perovskite, whereas producing a narrow-bandgap film on a wide-bandgap perovskite may further improve the short current density (Jsc) and PCE of the device. The most critical point lies in how to precisely control the secondary growth process.

6.2 Mechanical coating layer
As mentioned above, secondary growth is achieved through crystal rearrangement for tuning the film composition and improving the film quality. In the surface mechanical coating method, although the coating layer does not induce crystal rearrangement, the film quality is improved through defect passivation.

6.2.1 HTL passivation. 
Although all-inorganic pero-SCs have been shown to have excellent light and thermal stability, their efficiency is limited by their wide bandgap and high energy loss. In particular, the presence of a large number of defects is probably one of the most critical reasons for the high energy loss (Eloss). Recently, organic components containing Lewis acid-based moieties were found to coordinate with defects present at a perovskite film surface. This coordination process can help achieve effective surface passivation. Zeng et al. spin-coated an organic semiconductor layer poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) onto CsPbI2Br to serve as the HTL.156 The electronic structure calculated on the basis of density functional theory indicated that the sulfur (S) in P3HT would bond with Cs atoms on the CsPbI2Br(110) surface and passivate the interfacial positively charged under-coordinated Cs+ ions. Simultaneously, S atoms would also bond with Pb2+ for passivating the antisite defects (Fig. 13a). The Voc value of a pero-SC based on the CsPbI2Br perovskite was significantly increased to 1.32 V. Similarly, a dopant-free polymer, poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT), was used as the HTL in a CsPbI2Br solar cell.115 The passivation effect was observed to occur between N–Cs, S–Cs, N–Pb, and S–Pb, resulting in a consistent Voc enhancement and a promising PCE as high as 16.2%. Importantly, a series of dopant-free polymeric hole-transporting materials, such as poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl], poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethyl-hexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl],158 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA),159 poly-triarylamine, poly-fluoren-8-triarylamine, and poly-indenofluoren-8-triarylamine (PIF8-TAA),160 have been successfully used as HTLs for passivating all-inorganic perovskite film surfaces. The passivation strategy, which was adopted from organic semiconductors with lone-pair-electron moieties, is effective in reducing Eloss of pero-SCs. A dopant-free polymer is suitable for application in all-inorganic perovskite systems because it can perform well at relatively high temperature. More novel polymers with high mobility and thermal resistance properties should be developed.

6.2.2 Intermediate layer passivation. 
Intermediate layers with ultrathin characteristics have been incorporated between a perovskite film and an HTL/ETL to block recombination between electrons and holes at the interface. They have also been found to enable passivation of surface trap states. Liao et al. introduced carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and red phosphorus quantum dots as intermediaries at TiO2/CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces to passivate interfacial defects and thereby suppress charge recombination.161 The resultant solar cell exhibited a PCE of 8.2% with almost no degradation in 80% RH ambient air for 1056 h. Almost at the same time, Pb(NO3)2 was investigated for use as an intermediate layer between a perovskite and an HTL to suppress the surface deep traps of Pb vacancies (VPb) and I interstitials (Ii) for a CsPbI2Br perovskite film.157 The introduction of Pb2+ led to these ions combining with Ii, arising from the excess I ions, and filling the VPb on the perovskite surface (Fig. 13b). As a result, a CsPbI2Br film with a low defect state density was obtained. Zhang et al. post-treated QDs with formamidinium iodine (FAI) solution for coating a CsPbI2Br film.162 After the coating, an ultrathin iodine-ion-enriched perovskite layer was formed at the QD/perovskite interface. Through this treatment, both the QD surface and perovskite grain boundary could be passivated simultaneously, and this increased the PCE of the pero-SC based on the coated CsPbI2Br film to 14.12%. The use of nonconjugated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as an intermediate layer between CsPbI2Br and the carbon electrode was also explored.163 Interestingly, the cracks and pinholes at the CsPbI2Br grain boundary were filled by PMMA. Furthermore, PMMA was demonstrated to effectively reduce the trap density of the CsPbI2Br film as well. Similarly, choline iodine (CHI) was spin-coated on the surface of the CsPbI3 perovskite. It was found that CHI penetrated the bulk film, possibly through pinholes and cracks, and not only passivated the surface trap states of the perovskite but also led to the energy levels at the interfaces being well matched. Surprisingly, this surface modification resulted in an ultrahigh PCE of 18.4%.164 Recently, a dye molecule, 5,15-[bis(2,6-dioctoxyphenyl)-10-(bis(4-hexylphenyl)-amino-20-4-carboxyphenyl ethynyl)porphyrinato]zinc(II) (YD2-o-C8), with a low bandgap was introduced between a CsPbIBr2 layer and an HTL for enhancing absorption. The results indicated that the YD2-o-C8 intermediate layer could also passivate the perovskite surface. This was also evidenced from a ultrahigh Voc of 1.37 V.165

7. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review article, we have summarized recent crystal growth methods for all-inorganic perovskite films and the PCE evolution (Fig. 14) indicates the skyrocketing improvement of all-inorganic pero-SCs. Preparation of a void-free and reduced trap density inorganic perovskite film is critical for fabricating high-performance pero-SCs. Some key points are summarized as follows: low-temperature processing of all-inorganic perovskite films is an efficient way of realizing high-performance flexible and large-area pero-SCs; the quality of vacuum-evaporated perovskite films is highly dependent on the precursor stoichiometric ratio and evaporation rate; antisolvent selection, the precursor solution, and post-thermal annealing methods significantly influence the solution processed crystal quality; both substrate wettability and roughness play determining roles in nuclei formation and crystal growth, an in-depth study of crystal growth on p-type HTLs should be conducted for realizing high-performance inverted pero-SCs; and the doping strategy considerably influences the lattice stability and film morphology, particularly for organic dopants, which can optimize the crystal growth process and exhibit intensive coordination with the perovskite because of their chemical tailoring property. Finally, surface engineering techniques, including secondary growth and mechanical coating, were discussed as an efficient method for further improving the quality and optoelectronic properties of all-inorganic perovskite films. Although the above strategies have been successfully explored, all-inorganic pero-SCs still show relatively lower PCEs and poorer phase stability than those of organic–inorganic hybrid devices due to their limited light harvesting ability and crystal-quality controlling methods.
 Fig. 14  PCE evolution based on different crystal growth methodologies (some representative studies). 
Some important issues pertaining to the crystal growth of all-inorganic perovskite films should be addressed for further improvement of all-inorganic pero-SCs. (1) A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of crystal growth at low temperatures is necessary toward their application in flexible and large-area all-inorganic pero-SCs. Therefore, devising ways to reduce the activation energy of crystal growth without sacrificing crystal quality is particularly important. For example, the investigation of new additives and precursor adducts should be deeply performed; fully utilizing external driving forces like environment temperature, solvent vapor etc., and internal energy (lattice expansion force, shear stress etc.) during the crystal growth process may also facilitate the reduction of the deposition temperature. In addition to the indispensable thermal annealing process, the solvent type is closely related to the crystal nucleation and growth process. Therefore, an in-depth study of the intermediate reaction between precursors and solvents is necessary for accurately controlling the nucleation process. It is noteworthy that pure DMSO solvent can not only effectively increase the solubility of precursors for obtaining a thick film, but also slow down the crystallization process for expanding the operation window and improving the crystal quality. More solvents should be investigated for their role in intermediate formation and crystal growth. (2) Considering that the number of nuclei is severely dependent on the substrate wettability, thus greatly influencing the crystal size and film morphology, more attention should be focused on fabricating perovskite films on p-type organic HTLs with fine-tuned wettability due to their easily tailored chemical structures. As a result, the number of nuclei can be precisely controlled and the crystal quality can be improved. (3) An in-depth study of doping elements, including their valence, radius, and distribution, is necessary for devising techniques to stabilize the morphology and lattice of perovskite films. The organic component doping method involving a molecular template and passivation agent has also been shown to play an important role in crystal growth and reconstruction. Further, precisely controlling the molecular structures with appropriate sizes and targeted functional groups should be continuously explored. (4) Secondary growth is a useful strategy for further improving the crystal quality. It usually involves ion exchange, surface reactions, and crystal rearrangement. The secondary growth method enhances the stability of 2D/3D and 2D all-inorganic perovskite films, which is an important point for further improving all-inorganic pero-SCs. In addition, further exploration of mechanical coating layer materials with specific functional groups is necessary for sufficiently passivating the surface defects of inorganic perovskite films. Among these materials, some narrow-bandgap organic semiconductors may have great potential in extending the absorption ability of photoactive layers for increasing the current density.
Last, it is also worth mentioning that the poor moisture stability of all-inorganic perovskites (for I-rich content) is another bottleneck hindering their application. The following aspects should be paid more attention as possible ways to address this issue: (1) stabilizing the crystal lattice through coordination bond connection by incorporating organic dopants with strong coordination functional groups; (2) developing perovskite growth methods for obtaining large grain sizes and dense morphology, and simultaneously constructing continuous organic or inorganic transport layers with high moisture blocking capability to reduce the water intrusion pathways; and (3) constructing secondary growth of water-resistant 2D or lower surface free energy components on top of the perovskite.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have achieved considerable progress with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25%. However, hybrid perovskite materials are very unstable under humidity and thermal stress, because their volatile organic cation components such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) make the crystals easily decompose, thus hindering their further development. To overcome this intrinsic instability, inorganic cations such as cesium (Cs+) were proposed to completely replace the organic ions. The stability of the resultant all-inorganic perovskite materials was greatly improved, particularly at high temperature, and they could even bear 400 °C. Pursing high PCE and overall improved stabilities, which are highly dependent on the perovskite film quality, is the current primary task to promote the state-of-the-art all-inorganic pero-SCs toward practical application. Therefore, in order to attract the perovskite community's attention to this important direction, recent methodologies of crystal growth and related scientific issues for high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films have been summarized. This review comprehensively and clearly sorts out critical factors influencing the perovskite film quality, which will undoubtedly promote all-inorganic pero-SCs toward high performance and even large area.
