    , Accepted 31st May 2018First published on 4th June 2018AbstractNumerous modifications strategies are applied to spinel ZnFe2O4 nanorods with a band gap energy of ∼2.0 eV to enhance their activity as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. First, hybrid microwave annealing (HMA) imparts high crystallinity to ZnFe2O4 nanorods, while preserving the formed nanostructure and maintaining high electric conductivity of F:SnO2 (FTO) substrate. This is in contrast to conventional thermal annealing (CTA) at 800 °C that causes aggregation of ZnFe2O4 and degradation of FTO. Second, insertion of a TiO2 underlayer blocks charge recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface and serves as a source of Ti doping. Third, hydrogen treatment yields oxygen vacancies that increase charge carrier density and cause surface passivation. Last, a NiFeOx co-catalyst promotes hole injection into the electrolyte to improve catalytic water oxidation activity. These synergistic modifications lead to enhanced photocurrent density from 0.025 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE for pristine ZnFe2O4 nanorods prepared by CTA to 0.92 mA cm−2 for a fully modified HMA photoanode: a 37-fold increase in photocurrent density. There is also a cathodic shift of the onset potential down to 0.62 VRHE. The multiple modifications enhance bulk charge separation efficiencies from mere 2% to 30% and surface charge separation efficiency from 40% to 80%.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using metal oxide semiconductors has been extensively studied and has made unprecedented rapid progress during the last decade.1,2 Metal oxide semiconductors have the advantages of excellent stability in water and ready availability as they are made of earth-abundant elements. However, they also have limitations of large band gaps and poor charge mobility that lead to low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency when used as a light absorber in solar water splitting.3,4 However, there are a small number of oxide semiconductors with small band gaps of 1.6–1.9 eV that give theoretical STH efficiencies as high as 20–30%.5–7 Therefore, the search is still on for new photoelectrode materials that meet the rigorous criteria of small band gap, proper band position, (photo) electrochemical stability and cost effectiveness.
In this regard, spinel ferrites could be a class of promising candidates as photoelectrode materials because most of them have small band gaps allowing absorption of a large fraction of solar spectrum (1.6–2.1 eV), suitable band edge energies especially for reduction of protons, electrochemical stability and low cost.6–13 In spite of the substantial potential, there have been only a few studies on these materials as photoelectrodes based on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates because their synthesis in a crystalline form requires high temperatures above 1000 °C where TCOs degrade. Hence, to date, most ferrite photoelectrodes on TCOs are synthesized by expensive vacuum deposition techniques such as sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapour deposition and atomic layer deposition.9,10,13 Therefore, it is essential to find an alternative procedure to synthesize ferrite photoelectrodes on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates by an inexpensive process under mild temperatures for application of these materials. The ferrite materials synthesized at such a low temperature usually have poor charge transport properties and application of various modification strategies is inevitable to improve their photo-activity to a meaningful level.
Here, we employ an all solution-based synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanorods on a FTO substrate and a multitude of modifications strategies to improve their PEC water splitting efficiency: (1) nanostructuring by forming a nanorod morphology to improve charge carrier transfer;11,12 (2) hybrid microwave annealing (HMA) to preserve the nanostructure and to maintain FTO conductivity without degradation;12,14,15 (3) formation of a TiO2 underlayer to block back electron injection into the electrolyte and to induce extrinsic Ti doping by self-diffusion from the underlayer to ZnFe2O4;16–19 (4) hydrogen treatment to create oxygen vacancies that increase charge carrier density and to passivate surface states;11,20,21 (5) co-catalyst loading to enhance the kinetics of hole transfer at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. Due to these multiple modification strategies, the PEC water oxidation activity increased remarkably by ∼37 times relative to the pristine ZnFe2O4 nanorods prepared by conventional thermal annealing (CTA) at 800 °C. The remarkable improvement corresponds to enhanced bulk charge separation efficiencies from just 2% to 30% and surface charge separation efficiency from 40% to 80%.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanorod photoanodes by hybrid microwave annealing
The nanostructured ZnFe2O4 photoanode was prepared by a simple solution method. First, as a starting material, amorphous β-FeOOH (akaganeite) nanorods (NR) were grown on FTO glass (PECTM 8, 6–9 Ω, Pilkington) at 100 °C using an aqueous solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3·6H2O (97%, Sigma Aldrich) and NaNO3 (99%, Sigma Aldrich) for 6 h followed by rinsing with abundant deionized water to obtain a yellow coloured β-FeOOH thin film. Then, 80 μL of 60 mM Zn(NO3)·6H2O (98%, Sigma Aldrich) aqueous solution was added drop-by-drop on a 1 cm × 1 cm β-FeOOH thin film. HMA was used for transforming the anode to ZnFe2O4 nanorods instead of high temperature, conventional thermal annealing (CTA) in a muffle furnace. The reactor was filled with 5 g of graphite powder as a susceptor, on which the wet electrode was loaded and subsequently treated in a home microwave oven at 2.45 GHz and 1 kW for various durations. The microwave treatment turned the β-FeOOH nanorods into ZnFe2O4 nanorods wrapped with an excess ZnO surface layer. This ZnO skin was removed by soaking into 100 mL of 1 M NaOH solution (Samchun) for 12 h with stirring. The procedure resulted in pure ZnFe2O4 nanorods on FTO.
2.2. Deposition of TiO2 underlayers
Diluted titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution with isopropoxide (75 wt% in isopropoxide, Sigma Aldrich) was used to deposit a thin underlayer on the FTO substrate by spin coating (3000 rpm for 30 s), which was then moved to a muffle furnace right away and heated at 250 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the TiO2 underlayer on the FTO surface was controlled by dilution with isopropoxide from 10 mM to 40 mM. The samples with TiO2 underlayer were denoted by the Ti-precursor concentrations, e.g., TZF-100 mM for the 100 mM precursor. The thickness of TiO2 was determined by a surface profiler (KLA Tencor, P6).
2.3. Hydrogen treatment and co-catalyst deposition
To form defective oxygen vacancies, the electrodes were subsequently post-treated in a furnace under H2 atmosphere at 200 °C for 2 h.
The precursor solution for thin NiFeOx films was prepared by mixing iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate (50% w/w in mineral spirits, Sigma Aldrich), nickel(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (78% w/w in 2-ethylhexanoic acid, Alfar Aesar) and hexanes. Approximately 10 μL cm−2 of precursor solution was pipetted on a ZnFe2O4 photoelectrode. The electrode was irradiated with 1 sun illumination for 10 min to form NiFeOx and moved to an oven at 100 °C for 30 min.2,22
2.4. Characterization of the electrodes
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a PW3040/60 X'pert PRO machine (PANalytical) with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, JEOL), and X-ray (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS, ThermoFisher using Al-Kα source) were used to observe the morphology and electronic structure. The sheet resistance of thermally treated FTO substrate was measured by Hall effect measurements (AMP55). The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were conducted on the 7D beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV, 350 mA), Pohang, Korea. The radiation was monochromatized using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements were performed with a potentiostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies) using a three electrode cell with the ZnFe2O4 film, Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl), and Pt mesh as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. NaOH (1 M) purged with oxygen-free Ar gas was used as the electrolyte for the measurements. All the PEC experiments to obtain photocurrent (J)–voltage (V) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out under the one-sun condition (100 mW cm2) by a solar simulator (91160, Oriel) with an AM 1.5 G filter. The applied voltage was swept in the range of 0.6–1.7 VRHE with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The EIS was measured at a DC potential of 1.23 VRHE and AC potential frequency in the range 10000–0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed by sweeping from 0.3–1.7 VRHE with an AC frequency of 10 kHz and amplitude of 10 mV under dark condition. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurement was conducted under illumination with a 300 W xenon lamp coupled to a grating monochromator.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hybrid microwave synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanorods
The starting material for the synthesis of the ZnFe2O4 NR photoanodes was a highly anisotropic β-FeOOH akaganéite NR film that was first precipitated from an aqueous FeCl3 and NaNO3 solution at 100 °C onto a FTO substrate. Aqueous Zn(NO3) solution was then added and the wet electrode was transferred to a muffle furnace for CTA or home microwave oven for HMA, to transform β-FeOOH to ZnFe2O4 (ZF) NR photoanodes.11,12 Details of the HMA treatment and the properties of the formed ZnFe2O4 NR (ZF-HMA) are provided as a note in the ESI.† The superficial ZnO layer that formed on the ZnFe2O4 NR was selectively removed by soaking in a 1 M NaOH solution. To obtain ZnFe2O4 NR by CTA (ZF-CTA), an annealing condition of 800 °C for 20 min was chosen to achieve high crystallinity while minimizing the degradation of FTO conductivity. For HMA, graphite was used as a susceptor and annealing was performed only for 2 min with a 1 kW microwave heater. Thus, the graphite susceptor was initially heated rapidly by efficient microwave absorption, and its heat was transferred to the semiconductor to raise its temperature. Then, the sample starts to absorb the microwave radiation effectively due to the changed dielectric properties and attenuation distance at the elevated temperature.12,14 The operating time of HMA (2 min) was optimized considering the PEC performance as shown in Fig. S1.†

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns and XAFS of ZnFe2O4 NR photoanodes prepared by the two annealing treatments. The peaks at 2θ = 30° and 35.2° represent (220) and (311) crystal planes, respectively of the cubic spinel ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS: 01-089-1010) with the space group Fd3m. In spite of the very short annealing time, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the XRD peaks for ZF-HMA (0.3° and 0.28° for (220) and (311)) are very similar to those of ZF-CTA (0.28° and 0.27° for (220) and (311)), indicating highly efficient heating by HMA. X-ray near-edge structures (XANES) for the Fe K-edge of both ZF-HMA and ZF-CTA in Fig. 1b, which reflect an electric dipole transition from 1s core level to empty p states, are the same as those of the standard ZnFe2O4 powder but distinctly different from that of the precursor β-FeOOH NR. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra in Fig. 1c show slight differences in shape as well as in intensity of the first peak at 0.8–2.0 Å due to Fe–O bonding. The ZF-HMA shows significantly higher peak intensity relative to ZF-CTA and ZnFe2O4 powder. The ZF-CTA shows an asymmetric peak shape, indicative of the different Fe–O bonds present. The structural parameters extracted from EXAFS fitting are listed in Table S1.† The decrease in the Debye–Waller factor by about half and the shortened bond distance for ZF-HMA suggest that ZnFe2O4 NR are formed with better ordering by HMA. Thermal annealing at 800 °C for 20 min distorts the FeO6 octahedron in the ZnFe2O4 structure, resulting in two kinds of Fe–O bonds. In addition, Sn was observed by XPS analysis only for ZF-CTA in Fig. S2† because unlike HMA, CTA provides enough time for Sn to diffuse from the FTO substrate to the photocatalyst.

The HR-SEM images in Fig. 2 show that β-FeOOH NRs on FTO have a diameter of ∼50 nm and a length of ∼400 nm roughly perpendicular to the FTO substrate. Upon annealing, nanorods preserve their rod-like nanostructure, but they are slightly enlarged and the smooth surface of β-FeOOH becomes irregular in ZnFe2O4. The diameter of ZF-CTA increases to ∼80 nm and the rough surface shows many surface grain boundaries. On the other hand, ZF-HMA has a smaller diameter of ∼60 nm and smoother surface topology. Also, the sheet resistances of FTO substrates annealed by CTA and HMA were determined by Hall effect measurements as in Table S2.† The CTA causes large increases in sheet resistance after 10 min and 20 min of annealing, whereas HMA does not change the resistance for 2 and 3 min treatments, and the resistance starts to increase rapidly only after 5 min. Thus microwaving at a high power for a short time (1 kW for 2 min) is an optimum HMA condition to maintain the FTO conductivity while obtaining similar ZnFe2O4 crystallinity to that of ZF-CTA obtained at 800 °C and 20 min.

Photoelectrochemical water splitting was conducted under 1 sun with a ZF-CTA or ZF-HMA photoanode, Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl), and Pt mesh as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively, in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The photocurrent density (J)–potential (V) curves of those photoanodes are presented in Fig. 1d. The dark current onset potential due to the direct electrochemical oxidation of water was 1.6 VRHE for ZF-HMA and 1.7 VRHE for ZF-CTA. Pronounced photocurrent generation under illumination was observed from 0.8 VRHE and 0.9 VRHE for ZF-HMA and ZF-CTA, respectively, and the water oxidation photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE was ∼4 times higher (0.025 vs. 0.10 mA cm−2) for ZF-HMA than for ZF-CTA. Given the above results, the improved performance of ZF-HMA should be attributed to the preserved nanostructure (higher surface area), undamaged FTO conductivity and few defects or surface grain boundaries due to more efficient microwave heating.
3.2. Insertion of TiO2 underlayer
The next modification strategy involved the introduction of a thin TiO2 underlayer between the FTO and ZnFe2O4 NR film. The FTO glass was spin-coated with a Ti precursor solution and annealed at 250 °C for 30 min to form a TiO2 layer. Then, the FeOOH NR film was grown on top of the underlayer, which was transformed to ZnFe2O4 by HMA. This underlayer is known to induce several effects such as morphology change, suppression of electron recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface and self-diffusion of Ti into the semiconductor lattice for doping.16–19,23,24 The thicknesses of the TiO2 underlayer prepared using precursor solutions with concentrations ranging from 10 mM to 40 mM was measured to be 2–7 nm using a surface profiler, and are very similar to previously reported values.16
The SEM images in Fig. S3 and S4† present the morphology of the FeOOH nanorods on TiO2 underlayers of different thicknesses formed on the FTO substrate. The thick TiO2 underlayers formed with high Ti precursor concentrations (0.2 M, 0.4 M in Fig. S3†) give non-uniform FeOOH nanorod films, while the thin TiO2 underlayers formed with 5–100 mM yield uniform nanorod films as shown in Fig. S4.† However, the morphology change is not as significant as reported previously.16,17 The effects of the TiO2 layer on J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3. The thicker TiO2 layer causes decreased dark currents and larger anodic shifts of their onset potentials. The behaviour of the dark currents indicates that the TiO2 underlayer plays a role of a blocking layer by suppressing electron back injection from FTO to the electrolyte.19,24 The reduced current density for TZF during O2 bubbling also reveals the suppression of back reaction relative to ZF in Fig. S5.† In other words, this underlayer prevents a short circuit between the electrolyte and FTO substrate.
 Fig. 3  (a and b) J–V curves of TiO2 underlayered samples in darkness and under 1 sun irradiation. (c) J–V curves of ZF (w/o underlayer) and TZF (w/20 mM TiO2) samples under front and back side illumination. (d) The scheme of photo-induced electron transfer in the presence of TiO2 underlayer. At low potentials (E < 1.2 VRHE), the electron is difficult to be injected to TiO2 layer because the conduction band of TiO2 is higher, but it can successfully pass at high potentials (E > 1.2 VRHE) because of tunnelling effect by reduced barrier potential width. 
Another role of the TiO2 underlayer is to act as a source of Ti that can diffuse into ZnFe2O4 for n-type doping.16 Insertion of the TiO2 underlayer does not change XRD patterns in Fig. S6a.† Fe K-edge XANES spectra of all samples do not show any significant difference either (Fig. S6b†). However, the first EXAFS peak at 0.8–2.0 Å in Fig. S3c† corresponding to the shortest Fe–O scatterings in ZnFe2O4 shifts to a longer distance with increasing TiO2 concentrations. The structural parameters extracted from EXAFS curve fitting in Table S3† clearly show that as TiO2 concentration increases, Fe–O bond distance increases. As Ti4+ with a smaller atomic radius is doped into Fe3+ lattice in ZnFe2O4, Fe–O distance is elongated to accommodate the new short bond. The TiO2 underlayer also disturbs structural orderings as indicated by the increase in Debye–Waller factor. XPS (Fig. S6d†) detected elemental Ti in photoanodes with 40 mM and 100 mM TiO2 underlayers, but not in samples with lower concentrations of TiO2 underlayers. Maybe there is not enough time and/or amount of Ti to diffuse to the surface because of the short HMA time.14 The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results in Fig. 4 show the presence of the TiO2 underlayer. Unfortunately, it is difficult to clearly observe the thin TiO2 layer with the STEM image, but the EDS mapping shows the presence of the layer at the ZnFe2O4/FTO interface and some Ti elements diffused into ZnFe2O4 nanorods during HMA.

Fig. 3b and S7† depict the photocurrent response and Mott–Schottky plots of various underlayered ZnFe2O4 photoanodes. Among them, the 20 mM TiO2 underlayered photoanode shows the highest photoactivity and donor density. It was difficult to determine flat band position and donor density of some prepared photoanodes because of the slope transition near 0.8–1.0 VRHE in the Mott–Schottky plot, which is associated with abundant surface trapped states.25,26 However, the trend is obvious; photocurrent, donor density and the anodic shift of flat band potential increase with increased TiO2 concentration. Too thick an underlayer could impede the electron transfer from ZnFe2O4 to FTO.12,27 An interesting observation was made when PEC performance was measured under the illumination from the front or the back side of the electrode. As shown in Fig. 3c, ZF (without underlayer) exhibits the higher photo-response over the whole potential range for the back side illumination. However, TZF (20 mM TiO2) shows nearly the same photocurrents for back and front side illumination until 1.2 VRHE, while the back illumination shows higher photocurrents at higher bias potentials. The behaviour showed that the photo-induced electrons are difficult to inject from ZnFe2O4 to the TiO2 underlayer at a lower bias potential due to the large offset of the conduction band edges at the TiO2/ZnFe2O4 interface. However it can successfully pass at high enough potential by tunnelling through the TiO2 underlayer as depicted in Fig. 3d.19,28 Therefore, the observations are consistent with the roles of this thin TiO2 underlayer; to block back electron injection into electrolyte and to induce extrinsic Ti doping by self-diffusion from the underlayer.
3.3. Hydrogen treatment of underlayered ZnFe2O4 nanorods
In order to further improve the bulk charge transport properties of ZnFe2O4 (ZF), the TZF (20 mM TiO2-underlayered ZnFe2O4 NR) electrode was annealed under H2 atmosphere at 200 °C for 2 h (denoted as TZF-H2). Our previous studies revealed that this treatment created oxygen vacancies to increase the majority carrier concentration and passivated surface defects.11,20,21,29 An optimum oxygen vacancy concentration is critical to ensure their role as electron donors and not as electron trap sites.
XRD and UV-Visible spectroscopy in Fig. S8† show that the treatment does not change the crystal structure and light harvesting property. However, the XPS of O 1s in Fig. 5a, b, S9 and Table S5† reveals generation of the oxygen vacancies in the near surface region of ZnFe2O4 NR after the treatment. The O 1s peak could be deconvoluted into three peaks: the lattice O2− ions (OL), the native defects of O2− vacancies (OV) and H2O or –CO3 bonds on the surface (OC).11,30 The fraction of Ov in the TZF photoanode increases from 0.137 to 0.208 upon H2 treatment indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies. The treatment does not change Fe K-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 5c, but EXAFS results in Fig. 5d and Table S4† show that the first Fe–O peak at 0.8–2.0 Å of the ZF sample is shifted to a longer distance by 0.031 Å after undergoing H2 treatment. The generated oxygen vacancies or incorporated hydrogen may enlarge the lattice parameters in ZnFe2O4 upon H2 treatment.31,32 For the TZF sample, the effect of H2 treatment is not very apparent probably because Ti4+ that has diffused into the ZF layer may already have altered the structural environment of Fe significantly such that the influence of the H2 treatment is not revealed. The surface structure of the TZF sample was probed by HR-TEM before and after the H2 treatment. As in Fig. S10,† the TZF sample exhibits well-resolved lattice fringes up to the surface before the H2 treatment, while TZF-H2 clearly shows a disordered layer that is ∼2 nm. This surface amorphization is commonly observed in reduction-treated semiconductors.33–35 Based on the XPS, EXAFS and HR-TEM analyses, it can be concluded that the H2 treatment induces oxygen vacancies in the bulk as well as near the surface of ZnFe2O4 nanorods.

The TZF-H2 sample exhibits remarkably improved photocurrents in PEC water oxidation under 1 sun at 1.23 VRHE; TZF-H2 (790 μA cm−2), TZF (220 μA cm−2) and ZF-HMA (110 μA cm−2), ZF-CTA (∼30 μA cm−2) as shown in Fig. 6. We can deduce that the improved photo-activity originates from the increased majority carrier density by generated electrons for charge neutralization as revealed by their Mott–Schottky plots. To further investigate the changed charge transfer properties by the H2 treatment, EIS was performed at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation. The Nyquist plots are fitted to a two RC-circuit model in Fig. S11.† The largest impedance usually appears at the ZnFe2O4/electrolyte interface, and thus R2 and CPE2 could be assigned to the charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance there, respectively, while R1/CPE1 is assigned to the internal resistance and depletion capacitance in the bulk of the ZnFe2O4.12,14 Both resistances are greatly reduced after underlayer formation and H2 treatment. The underlayer effects such as suppression of back electron injection and diffusion of Ti elements are reflected in R1, which is reduced from 11814 to 8300 Ω, and further reduced to 3360 Ω after H2 treatment. Also, the charge transfer resistance (R2) is reduced from 6759 Ω to 4690 Ω and then to 600.3 Ω due to underlayer and H2 treatment of the ZnFe2O4 photoanode.

Hence, the H2 treatment enhanced solar water oxidation performance of ZnFe2O4/TiO2/FTO by improving bulk charge transfer property (increased charge carrier density) and passivating surface defects such as dangling bonds or lattice disorders formed after ZnO removal11. The band alignment of ZF is suggested in Fig. S12† based on the measured valence band position by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and band gap by UV-Vis diffuse spectra. The band alignment does not show any change even after TiO2 insertion and H2 treatment.
3.4. Deposition of co-catalyst
The last modification strategy of ZnFe2O4 involved the deposition of NiFeOx as an oxygen evolution co-catalyst to the TZF-H2 photoanode in order to boost the hole injection kinetics to the electrolyte for water oxidation. The amorphous NiFeOx co-catalyst was prepared by a photochemical route.2,22 The HR-TEM, STEM, EDX and XPS analyses in Fig. S10(c) and S13† show that NiFeOx was properly deposited on the surface of TZF-H2. The J–V curve for NiFeOx/TZF-H2 in Fig. 7a exhibits a large cathodic onset shift (∼0.22 V) relative to TZF-H2 without the co-catalyst, while enhancement of photocurrent at high bias potentials (>1.2 VRHE) is relatively small. In Fig. S14,† the onset potential shift and improvement of photocurrent was also observed on NFO coated ZF, ZF-H2 and TZF.

The efficiency of (c) bulk charge separation (ηbulk) and (d) interfacial charge separation (ηsurf) of ZF-based electrodes determined by adding 100 μL of H2O2 as a hole scavenger. 
The charge separation efficiencies on the surface and bulk of the modified ZnFe2O4 photoanodes were estimated through photo-oxidation of H2O2 as a hole scavenger according to the procedure described in detail in Fig. S15† and our previous publications.11,12,36 In Fig. 7c and d, the interfacial charge separation (ηsurf) and bulk charge separation (ηbulk) for all photoanodes are plotted. The ηbulk value is low at 1–2% for the ZF-CTA photoanode, which increases to ca. 30% at 1.23 VRHE upon underlayer formation and post H2 treatment. The TiO2 underlayer and H2 treatment make similar contributions to the enhanced ηbulk. However, loading the NiFeOx co-catalyst does not bring additional improvement in ηbulk. The ηsurf value increases from 40% for ZF to 80% at 1.23 VRHE after all modifications. This trend in ηsurf and ηbulk is in line with the remarkably reduced charge transfer resistances (R1 and R2) in EIS analysis. Moreover, the calculated photocurrent density with the charge separation efficiency and the measured photocurrent density correspond well (Fig. S16a†).
Finally, we carried out IPCE measurements, stability tests and determined the hydrogen/oxygen evolution using the final modified ZnFe2O4 photoanode with and without NiFeOx at 1.23VRHE as shown in Fig. 7b and S17.† The shape of IPCE curves basically followed the trend of the light absorption ability in Fig. S5† and the NiFeOx/TZF-H2 photoanode showed the highest IPCE among all prepared photoanodes over the entire wavelength spectrum, which indicates the significant beneficial effects of the underlayer, H2 treatment and co-catalyst on the PEC water splitting efficiency. The intergrated photocurrents based on the IPCE data are consistent with the measured photocurrent densities in Fig. S16b.† In order to confirm that the generated photocurrent is indeed due to water splitting, the gas evolution (H2/O2) was measured with NiFeOx/TZF-H2 and TZF-H2 under 1 sun irradiation at 1.23 VRHE. As shown in Fig. S18,† both gases evolved linearly with time with a ratio close to 2:1. Faradaic efficiency values of ∼90% were obtained through the whole measurements, indicating that most of generated photocurrents contribute to water splitting.
The stability of the representative photoanodes was tested under 1 sun condition under continuous operation over 10 h at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. S17†). The TZF-H2 photoanode exhibits a transient behavior of slightly increasing and decreasing photocurrents with time, but was stabilized after 5 h of operation. No such transient behavior is observed during the whole operation time after NiFeOx deposition. Thus these photoanodes show excellent photoelectrochemical stability in the basic electrolyte.
4. Conclusions
A facile and low-cost synthesis method for 1-D nanostructured ZnFe2O4 photoelectrode was developed based on HMA with graphite powder as a susceptor. Relative to CTA at 800 °C, HMA preserved the 1-D nanostructure and electric conductivity of FTO substrate, resulting in higher PEC water oxidation performance. A multitude of modification strategies were applied; (i) TiO2 underlayer for blocking electron back injection from FTO to electrolyte, and providing Ti4+ for doping, (ii) H2 treatment to form oxygen vacancy, and (iii) co-catalyst (NiFeOx) loading. The modifications improved interfacial and bulk charge transfer efficiency and eventually led to improved PEC performance. As a result, the photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun was dramatically increased by 37 times from 0.025 mA for pristine ZF-CTA to 0.92 mA and the onset potential was greatly reduced to 0.62 VRHE after all modifications (NiFeOx/TZF-H2). The remarkable improvement corresponds to enhanced bulk charge separation efficiencies from just 2% to 30% and surface charge separation efficiency from 40% to 80%. This result shows the highest photocurrent and the earliest onset potential reported so far (Table S6†). However, in spite of multiple modifications, there is still a huge gap between the measured and theoretical photocurrents due to limitations, in particular bulk charge recombination.37 Efforts are therefore needed to improve this material and reveal further intrinsic properties. For example, there are nearly no reports about divalent site substitution (Zn).
