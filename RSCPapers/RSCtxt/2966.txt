    , Accepted 1st August 2019First published on 1st August 2019AbstractIn this work, the effect of photochemically modifying nanoporous bismuth vanadate in Co2+ solution in acetate buffer (abbreviated as Co–Ac) on water oxidation was thoroughly studied. Modification of photoanode surfaces with the electrocatalyst Co–Ac has yielded a ∼450 mV cathodic shift in the onset potential and more than threefold higher photocurrent density at 1.23 V than that of pristine BiVO4. Structural and mechanistic studies indicate that Co–Ac effectively acts as a true catalyst on BiVO4 in that Co–Ac can boost the photoelectrochemical properties of the BiVO4 underlayer by mediating hole extraction across the photoexcited semiconductor–electrolyte interface. With Co–Ac as the catalyst, water oxidation becomes much more facile by overcoming the unproductive surface electron–hole recombination. This work considers the potential application of this simple surface modification approach for other candidate photoanodes.
1. Introduction
With the increase in serious environmental problems, the ever-increasing shortage of energy supply and the urgent worldwide demand for renewable energy in recent decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is now being considered as one of the attractive and highly feasible approaches for directly converting solar energy into highly efficient, eco-friendly and sustainable hydrogen energy.1 However, for the evolution of one oxygen molecule, four holes must be injected from the photoanode into the electrolyte, which is a thermodynamically uphill reaction.2 Consequently, the tough oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process retards the oxygen evolution rate and incurs severe charge recombination. A predominant strategy for reducing the potential barriers in surface kinetics is to combine well-established electrocatalysts with photoelectrodes.3 The search for a high-performance water oxidation cocatalyst (WOC) is therefore of vital importance and is the key issue in eliminating the bottleneck of the inadequate PEC water splitting performance.4 Recently, research on WOCs consisting of 3d transition metals has been of great interest rather than traditional noble-metal-based catalysts5 when elemental abundance and especially cost efficiency are taken into account.4 Although various WOCs have been widely developed, only moderate cases have been implemented in the PEC OER under illumination due to a number of concerns (e.g., the parasitic absorption of the catalyst, the deposition method restrictions, and the intimate contact between WOC/semiconductor).4 In particular, since the pioneering work reported by Kanan and Nocera in 2008,6 amorphous cobalt–phosphate (“Co–Pi”) has emerged as a pioneering cocatalyst candidate for PEC cells on account of its high catalytic behavior, ease of synthesis and eco-friendliness. Since then, this catalyst has attracted tremendous interest and become one of the research hotspots. Except for Co–Pi, other metal phosphates, such as Ni–Pi,7,8 Fe–Pi,8,9 Mn–Pi10 or Ir–Pi,11 are also observed to be capable of facilitating PEC water oxidation. Unfortunately, although metal phosphate has been successfully applied to PEC water splitting as a high-performance cocatalyst, its dissolution in electrolyte solution remains a challenging task.12–15 Furthermore, the poor solubility of Co2+ salts in phosphate electrolytes makes the formation of Co–Pi a tedious and time-consuming process, thus limiting its large-scale preparation.16 Given that a high concentration of Co2+ is advantageous because the rate of electrodeposition can be enhanced and also layers of the catalyst can be deposited in a shorter time, the demonstration of cobalt-based catalysts in alternative buffer solutions where high concentration of Co2+ salts can be dissolved is in great demand. More recently, Dey et al. reported that a suitable choice of buffers can control the chemical composition of cobalt-based materials and greatly enhance the OER activity.17 For instance, electrodeposition of a more active and stable catalyst, namely, a cobalt–acetate complex (Co–Ac), by replacing the phosphate electrolyte with a neutral acetate buffer solution containing high concentrations of Co has been reported recently by Irshad and co-workers.16
With these facts in mind, in this study, we demonstrate a facile and rapid photochemical deposition strategy for directly integrating ultrathin Co–Ac as a high-efficiency cocatalyst onto a conventional bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanoporous photoanode. It is found that the introduction of Co–Ac offers considerable support to efficient hole transfer and consumption against the unproductive and energy-wasted surface charge recombination, thus resulting in a reduction in surface kinetics barriers and lowering of the water oxidation onset potential. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that acetate anions in the Co–Ac layer could also have a synergistic effect on promoting the multiphoton-coupled electron-transfer process for the PEC water oxidation and can function as effective linkers between BiVO4 and cobalt cations. This work would provide feasible routes for the design and synthesis of high-performance bismuth vanadate-based PEC nanomaterials for water splitting.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of porous BiVO4 photoelectrodes
BiVO4 (BVO) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was prepared using the common electrodeposition procedure as previously reported by Choi and co-workers.18 First, a film of BiOI nanosheets was deposited on an FTO substrate coated glass substrate via an electrochemical synthesis route. Excess vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) was subsequently used to convert BiOI to BVO, while the vanadium oxide by-product was removed by etching in alkali solution.
2.2 Surface modification with a cobalt-based cocatalyst
Nanoporous BVO was photochemically modified in 3 mM Co2+/0.1 M acetate buffer (Ac) aqueous solution by illuminating with a 500 W Xe lamp as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The light power at the surface of the electrode as measured using an optical power meter (Model 843R, Newport) was 30 mWcm−2. After deposition, samples were washed with double distilled water, dried in air and kept in a desiccator under dark conditions (denoted as BVO/Co–Ac). Several electrodes were prepared by varying the illumination time to monitor the effect of increasing coverage on the photoelectrochemical performance.

2.3 Material characterization
Morphologies and chemical compositions were determined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) equipped with an INCA energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyzer operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, TECNAI G2 F20) operating at 200 kV. An X-ray diffractometer (Bruker) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source was employed to check the crystallinity of the photoanodes. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using Kα radiation (XPS, Thermo VG ESCALAB250). The optical band gap was estimated from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (V650, Jasco) with an FTO substrate as a reference. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using a Bio-Rad FTS 3500 spectrometer in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. The data were recorded in the 400–4000 cm−1 range. The catalyst loading amount on the photoelectrode as well as the cobalt residue in the electrolyte after the water oxidation reaction was studied using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Jobin Yvon JY-2000).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical performances of the as-prepared anodes were measured in a standard three-electrode system, with the anodes as the working electrodes, a platinum mesh (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode controlled using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm). Simulated solar illumination was achieved by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp (Model 66905, Newport) equipped with an AM 1.5 filter, and the power intensity of the incident light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 7, KPi) was used as the electrolyte unless otherwise stated. The photocurrent was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The data were collected by back-illumination. The potentials measured vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials using the Nernst equation. For calculating the charge injection efficiency, the photocurrent was measured using 1 M Na2SO3 as the hole scavenger; the ratio of the photocurrents with and without the hole scavenger gave the charge injection efficiency of the photoanode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed over a frequency range of 105–0.1 Hz under AM 1.5G light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). In order to achieve more accurate and reliable evaluation on the capacitance and resistance of different electrodes without under/overestimation, impedance was measured with an identical driving force of 200 mV, which means that the applied potential was 200 mV more positive than the onset potential of each sample (refer to Table S1† for details). Data were then fitted to an appropriate equivalent circuit by using Nova software (version 1.11) to derive the resistance values.
Transient photocurrent (J–t) measurements were performed at an applied potential of 1.23 V under chopped light irradiation (light on or off cycles: 10 s). The long-term stability of the photoanodes for the OER was evaluated by chronoamperometry with a controlled potential for several hours. The solution was gently stirred to circulate the electrolyte and remove bubbles from the film surface. Simultaneously, O2 and H2 evolution of the photoanodes and the amount of gas were detected using a gas chromatograph (YL6500GC, Young Lin Instrument Co., Korea) with a thermal conductivity detector every 10 min. The Faradaic efficiency was calculated according to the integrated charge (Q) passed and the amount of O2 evolved.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were obtained by collecting the photocurrent recorded under monochromatic light irradiation (Oriel Cornerstone 130, Newport) using the same three-electrode system as described above. The power intensity of the monochromatic light at each wavelength λ (Pmono(λ)) was measured using a wand-style calibrated silicon photodiode coupled with a power meter (843-R, Newport). A fixed potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE was applied to the photoelectrode while the resulting current was recorded. The photoconversion efficiencies were calculated from the J–V curves using the equation η = [(1.23 − V) × (Jlight − Jdark)/Plight] × 100%, where V refers to the applied potential, Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, and Plight is the power density of the incident light.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase structure and morphology
To visually investigate the morphology and nanostructure of the photoanodes, SEM and TEM images of the obtained samples before and after modification in Co2+/acetate were recorded. As shown in Fig. 1(a), BVO exhibited wormlike-shaped particles with an average diameter of 100–150 nm. After coating with Co–Ac, the obtained Co–Ac covering the BVO surface maintained the inherent structure of the initial worm-like BVO, without obvious nanoparticles on the BVO surface, suggesting that the Co–Ac layer is ultrathin. The typical TEM image of BVO/Co–Ac shows that the surface of BVO has been encapsulated with an ultrathin amorphous layer with a thickness of less than 10 nm (Fig. 1d and e). Moreover, EDS mapping unambiguously confirmed the presence of Co, as presented in Fig. S1,† for BVO modified by illumination in Co2+/acetate buffer. The loading amount of Co on the electrodes was also quantified to be 0.42 μg cm−2 according to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2(a) reveals the similar phase structures of BVO/Co–Ac to those of bismuth vanadate, without diffraction of cobalt species, implying the amorphous nature of the photochemically deposited Co–Ac catalyst and its low loading amount. It is important to note that it was not possible to detect directly the characteristic infrared absorption bands of the acetate functional group attached to the BVO film in the ATR-FTIR mode. Therefore, to identify accurately the presence of Co–Ac, the photodeposition time was extended to 120 min. Apparently, the vibrations at 1721 cm−1, 1419 cm−1 and 1296 cm−1 correspond to the CO stretching and in-plane O–C–O bending of the carboxylate group of the acetate anion. This indicates the presence of Co–Ac− anions in the material. Previous studies reported that the carboxylate group can interact with the protonated surface hydroxyl groups of BVO over the ester linkage formation whereas the methyl group likely bound to the cobalt centers in the deposited material.17,19

The nature of cobalt species loaded on the BVO photoanodes was further studied using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) as shown in Fig. 3. The Co 2p spectrum showed two spin–orbit coupling energy states of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 780.8 and 795.9 eV and both Co2+ and Co3+ cations can be found on the surface. The strong peak at 529.9 eV in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) can be assigned to lattice oxygen species. There are two overlapping peaks at 531.3 and 532.8 eV representing the 1s ionization of oxygen atoms from adsorbed hydroxyl and acetate, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, the C 1s spectrum can be fitted to three peaks located at 284.8, 286.2, and 288.4 eV, corresponding to C–C, C–O and CO from the acetate, respectively.17

To explore the influence of Co–Ac decoration on the optical absorption properties of the BVO photoanode, which is one of the most important factors in controlling the photoelectrocatalytic activity, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the bare BVO films had an absorption band edge at approximately 500 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.45 eV, which is in agreement with a previous report.18 After being decorated with Co–Ac, the absorption spectra showed essentially the same absorption edges as those for pure BVO, suggesting that the presence of Co–Ac does not alter the UV-vis spectra to any appreciable extent owing to its low loading amount.5
3.2 Photoelectrochemical studies of BVO/Co–Ac
The effect of different Co–Ac loading amounts on the PEC performance was examined in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7) by measuring J–V characteristics with chopped light, which generates both the dark current and the photocurrent during a single linear sweep. As can be seen in Fig. 4(a), all the samples modified with Co–Ac exhibited enhanced photocurrents in comparison to bare BVO. The photocurrent tended to increase when the photodeposition was prolonged from 30 s to 60 s, which is directly proportional to the amount of cobalt deposit (Fig. S2†). However, the photocurrent decreased with a further increase in the deposition time of Co–Ac. This decrease in photoresponse is most likely because the excess Co–Ac deposit can also act as the trap site that facilitates the charge carrier recombination at the semiconductor surface.20 Apparently, the appearance of an obvious negative spike in transient measurements which corresponds to the recombination of bulk electrons with surface-accumulated holes indicates that the thick deposition of Co–Ac obstructs the facile diffusion of holes to the electrolyte. By contrast, under the same conditions, BVO/Co–Ac (60 s) exhibited a large photocurrent density without obvious transient spikes over a wide potential range, implying that the BVO/Co–Ac (60 s) layer is able to efficiently reduce the charge recombination and augment the water oxidation kinetics. Hence, a deposition time of 60 s was the optimum for photooxidation under the present experimental conditions and was used for further studies hereafter. Fig. 4(b) shows the LSV curves of BVO and BVO with an optimized loading amount of Co–Ac. Under continuous illumination with simulated light, the bare BVO exhibited a typical response with a photocurrent density of 0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Evidently, the photocurrent can be considerably enhanced upon loading of Co–Ac. A photocurrent density of 2.05 mA cm−2 is achieved at 1.23 V, which is 3.4 times higher than that of bare BVO. In addition, there is an apparent cathodic shift from ∼0.8 V of BVO to 0.32 V of BVO/Co–Ac, implying a positive catalytic water oxidation effect of Co–Ac. To prove further the intrinsic catalytic activity of Co–Ac for water oxidation, the electrocatalytic OER curves were recorded under the dark conditions and shown in Fig. S3.† Co–Ac exhibited an electrocatalytic water oxidation performance preferable over bare BVO, as demonstrated by the lower overpotential and higher current density, which suitably matched with the observed photoelectrocatalytic performance data. To explore the synergism of Co–Ac, photoelectrochemical activities of BVO modified with Co2+ in the absence of Ac (BVO/Co) and with just Ac (BVO/Ac) are also presented in Fig. 4(b). BVO/Co featured a shape similar to that of BVO/Co–Ac but with lower photocurrents, hinting that the improved photoelectrocatalytic performance is not just due to the presence of cobalt cations on the surface but the predominant electrocatalytic activity of Co–Ac. The BVO/Ac sample hardly contributed significant current to the overall performance. In addition, it is reported that the oxidation reaction of acetate (ca. 2.20 V vs. NHE) is thermodynamically less favorable than the oxygen evolution reaction.21 Therefore, water oxidation is the only dominant reaction and the contribution of adverse acetate oxidation can be ruled out.

To provide a relative comparison in the performance of the Co–Ac catalyst, the PEC behavior of various cobalt-based WOC-loaded BVO photoanodes that have recently been reported is tabulated in Table 1. Obviously, BVO/Co–Ac exhibits higher photocurrent density than most of the other single cocatalyst-decorated BVO. As an example, through loading a Co–Bi cocatalyst by electrodeposition, Ding reported that the onset potential was cathodically shifted by 320 mV while the photocurrent of the BVO electrode is increased by about four-fold.22 Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical behavior of Co–Ac was greater than that of Co–Pi with a less pronounced anodic transient spike than that of Co–Pi (Fig. S4†) which is probably due to the modest stability of Co–Pi. Indeed, Zhong et al. reported that, although modification of BVO photoanode surfaces with Co–Pi has yielded a very large (∼440 mV) cathodic shift in the onset potential, it still suffered from unsatisfactory stability.13 As one of the most efficient catalysts, hydrothermally synthesized three-dimensional CoOOH induced a cathodic onset potential shift of ∼0.4 V, higher IPCE of 65% at 450 nm and good stability,23 superior to the typical Co3O4 and Co–Pi cocatalyst-modified BVO photoanodes. Our results also highlight the importance of the interface between the oxygen evolution catalyst and photoanode. Specifically, most electrocatalysts based on IrOx,24 silver,25 metal–organic frameworks,26 graphene oxide27 or metal phosphide28 were prepared in the form of powder which may lead to limited contact between the catalyst and light absorber and immensely increase the interface resistance. Although we cannot quantitatively use these data to sustain the overall superior catalytic activity because the catalyst might perform differently with different fabrication processes, it is clear that Co–Ac is at least photocatalytically competitive, with the additional advantages described above.

On the basis of the J–V results, the maximum ABPE for BVO/Co–Ac was calculated to be 0.78% at 0.67 V, which is approximately 10 times higher than that of bare BVO (0.08% at 1.05 V). Both higher ABPE at the same potential and smaller potential for the maximum ABPE are highly desired for better PEC water splitting performance as well as for achieving self-biased operation in a tandem cell.34 Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the ABPE attained by BVO/Co–Ac is still inferior to the record-high ABPE (2.2%) reported recently for N2-treated nanoporous BiVO4 electrodes coupled with FeOOH and NiOOH as oxygen evolution catalysts,35 highlighting that there is still much room for ABPE improvement by focusing on maximizing both charge separation and injection of BiVO4 at low applied bias potential.36
The wavelength dependence of the IPCEs for the BVO/Co–Ac and bare BVO photoanodes was examined at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4(c)). BVO/Co–Ac revealed a similar photocurrent response spectrum to the bare BVO, indicating that the primary photoresponse was from the nanoporous BVO electrode rather than from Co–Ac, which is in accordance with their uniform response in the absorption spectra (Fig. 4(d)). At 450 nm, the IPCE value of the BVO/Co–Ac photoanode reached approximately 60% while that of the BVO electrode was only 20%. The low IPCE for the photoanode lacking Co–Ac coating further suggests that the majority of electron–hole pairs recombine and thus no significant free charge carriers are transferred to the electrolyte. However, in the presence of Co–Ac behaving as an electrocatalyst, a higher IPCE is obtained due to better utilization of the photoinduced charges.
3.3 Mechanism of PEC on the BVO/Co–Ac photoanode
Based on the preceding discussion, it can be stated that conformal deposition of Co–Ac on the BVO surface brought significant enhancement in photocurrent density. These results motivated us to carry out a comprehensive investigation on the origin of such an extraordinary enhancement, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the functionality of the cobalt acetate catalyst. Firstly, impedance measurements conducted on BVO and BVO/Co–Ac in 0.1 M KPi electrolyte in the dark allowed the construction of Mott–Schottky plots from which the flat-band potentials (Vfb) of the two materials were extrapolated from the x-axis intercept. Fig. S5† shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the BVO and BVO/Co–Ac electrodes measured at 1 kHz. Upon Co–Ac modification, the flat band potential only shifted slightly negatively (∼100 mV), indicating that Co–Ac deposition does not induce a significant effect on band bending at the surface but mainly on the promotion of surface reaction kinetics. Therefore, the possibility of forming a heterojunction between the co-catalyst and the semiconductor which could promote the charge separation and transfer can be ruled out. Similar behaviors were observed for cobalt- or iron-containing catalyst deposition on the BVO photoelectrode.9,37,38 To gain further evidence to prove the above conclusion, the interface charge transport behavior of the electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained under AM 1.5G irradiation. Fig. 5(a) shows typical Nyquist plots of the obtained two electrodes, which were fitted by an equivalent circuit (the inset of Fig. 5a) with their results listed in Table S1.† Both spectra consist of a semicircle, which is characteristic of the charge-transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct). Co–Ac-modified BVO exhibits a nearly two-times smaller Rct than bare BVO, suggesting that the presence of Co–Ac on BVO can make charge transfer on the electrode/electrolyte more efficient, minimize the hole accumulation and inhibit the adverse recombination process. Additionally, as shown in Table S1,† a slight increase in capacitance with depositing Co–Ac can be attributed to hole storage with Co–Ac, confirming the hole transfer from BVO to Co–Ac. This is in accordance with the conclusion previously reported for Co–Pi.39–41
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra of BVO and BVO/Co–Ac measured in phosphate buffer; (b) transient J–t measurements performed with chopped light at 1.23 V; (c) J–V curves of BVO/Co–Ac and bare BVO in 0.1 M KPi (solid lines) and after addition of hole scavenger Na2SO3 (dashed lines) under AM 1.5 G light illumination; (d) calculated charge injection efficiency of BVO and BVO/Co–Ac. 
To verify this assumption, polarization curves under chopped illumination with a light on and off duration of 10 s were recorded (Fig. 5(b)). As for BVO, the positive striking spike indicates the presence of surface recombination processes in which the initial hole accumulation at the photoanode/electrolyte interface is followed by some degree of electron–hole recombination. Comparing the transient profile of BVO/Co–Ac to that of BVO, the anodic spike value is apparently reduced. This is sufficient evidence for the efficient suppression of the hole–electron recombination by providing a facile route through which photogenerated holes can be trapped and injected into the electrolyte as soon as they reach the surface.
For better demonstrating the role of Co–Ac in facilitating hole injection to the electrolyte, photocurrent measurements were reassessed in the presence of a hole scavenger, i.e., Na2SO3. Because the sulfite oxidation is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than water oxidation, it is assumed that there is no recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and that the hole injection efficiency (ηinj) is generally considered to be 100%. Fig. 5(c) shows both water oxidation and sulfite oxidation J–V curves of BVO and BVO/Co–Ac. In good agreement with previous studies, there is a big photocurrent gap in the entire potential range between the photocurrents obtained with and without the hole scavenger, indicating that sluggish water oxidation kinetics is one of the current-limiting factors for bare BVO.5,14 When the Co–Ac catalyst is deposited, the difference between the photocurrents obtained with and without the hole scavenger is significantly narrowed, indicating the role of Co–Ac in enhanced charge-transfer kinetics.5 Nonetheless, both curves do not overlap, suggesting that there is still room for further optimization. A quantitative analysis was carried out by dividing the photocurrent measured in KPi (Jph) by the photocurrent (Jscav) value measured in a hole-scavenger electrolyte42 and the results are shown in Fig. 5(d). The hole injection yield (ηinj) of BVO/Co–Ac is about 70% at an applied bias of 1.23 V, which is much higher than that of 20% in BVO. This extraordinary improvement indicates that Co–Ac partially overcomes the kinetic limitation of water oxidation.
To this end, it is reasonable to conclude that Co–Ac acts as both a hole collector and a water oxidation catalyst, resulting in enhanced charge transfer kinetics to the solution5 and significantly lower onset potential. Although multiple competing mechanisms on the exact role of cobalt-based materials in enhancing the PEC performance exist and are still under debate,43,44 herein, a tentative mechanism of the OER on Co–Ac-deposited BVO is suggested and illustrated in Fig. 6. Under solar light irradiation, the electrons are excited from the valence band of BVO to its conduction band and then transported to the counter electrode under applied potential to generate hydrogen. While the valence band holes of BVO can directly oxidize water, in the absence of an appropriate cocatalyst such as Co–Ac, these holes may suffer from severe charge recombination due to the low consumption rate of holes. Co–Ac was used as an effective cocatalyst to improve the reaction kinetics of water oxidization due to timely extraction of the photogenerated holes accumulated at the surface of the photoanode/electrolyte similar to that of another analogous cobalt-based cocatalyst.45 Namely, the low-valence of Co2+/Co3+ in Co–Ac can be charged by the photogenerated holes in BVO to form Co3+/Co4+ due to the lower formation energy barrier.45,46 These high valence states of Co species further oxidized water releasing oxygen, and were simultaneously reduced to the low-valence Co2+, which completed a catalytic cycle for the oxygen evolution.39,41,47–50 This self-healing reaction between Co2+ and Co3+ is believed to promote the hole transportation efficiency, leading to dramatically enhanced PEC performance. While metal cations have been generally recognized as the actual sites in the oxygen evolution reaction, the role of anions remains unclear. In a recent study, Risch et al. suggested that the redox chemistry of a cobalt catalyst may be modulated by anions such as acetate or phosphate and that these anions are most likely not involved in the chemistry of the water oxidation process.51 Yet, the way in which anions affected the catalyst was not addressed directly, and further study is necessary.

3.4 PEC stability of the composite photoanode
Finally, long-term stability under prolonged illumination of the BVO/Co–Ac electrode was investigated at 0.67 V vs. RHE (potential at which the ABPE reached a maximum) in different electrolytes, i.e., phosphate buffer (KPi, pH 7) and borate buffer (KB, pH 9.4). Chronoamperometry curves reported in Fig. 7(a) show that the photocurrent quickly drops by 70% of its initial value when the BVO/Co–Ac photoanode is irradiated in contact with the KPi solution. By contrast, when KB buffer was employed as the electrolyte, BVO/Co–Ac appears to possess higher photocurrent stability than in KPi solution, which maintained a quasi-stable state for at least 6 h. It was intended to carry out an investigation on the reasoning behind such difference in durability behavior of Co–Ac in phosphate and acetate buffer electrolytes. The morphology and composition changes of the electrodeposited material before and after electrolysis in the phosphate electrolyte were thoroughly analyzed by XPS and SEM at high magnification (Fig. S6†). While there is no significant variation in the morphology of BVO/Co–Ac after the stability test in borate electrolyte, the presence of a rougher surface together with the detection of P 2p signals after electrolysis in phosphate buffer solution implied that there might be a partial exchange of acetate present in the Co–Ac catalyst with the phosphate group in the electrolyte (Fig. S6†). In addition, a slightly higher photocurrent density was obtained in phosphate buffer compared to that of in acetate buffer, further suggesting a synergistic catalytic activity in phosphate solution, resulting in the formation of a Co–Ac–Pi catalyst (Fig. S7†). Nevertheless, it is also important to note that this partial substitution or in situ deposition of Co–Pi during the long-term water splitting process might cause the poor stability of BVO/Co–Ac in phosphate buffer due to overloading of the catalyst as discussed in the earlier section. Different durability behaviors of BVO/Co–Ac may also be attributed to the dependence of photogenerated hole utilization on solution chemistry, i.e., the identity of buffered anions and pH. Indeed, as shown in Fig. S8,† both photocurrent density and hole injection efficiency of BVO/Co–Ac in KB are higher than those in KPi. This is partially because the oxygen evolution reaction is more favorable at higher pH where the OH− group traps holes to form OH radicals more efficiently. Another scenario is that the specific adsorption of borate ions on the surface might facilitate charge transfer across the electrode–electrolyte interface as evidenced by the smaller interface charge transfer resistance.52,53 Additionally, Kuang et al. reported that the borate buffer played an important role in reducing the electrical resistance of the solution and facilitating mass transfer.54 These observations disclosed the noticeable influence of the identity of buffered ions on the PEC performance and durability.
 Fig. 7  (a) Time-dependent photocurrent densities of BVO/Co–Ac at 0.67 V under AM 1.5G irradiation in phosphate (pH 7) and borate (pH 9.4) buffers; (b) amount of evolved O2 (red dot) and H2 (green dot) and faradaic efficiency of O2 produced from water oxidation for the BVO/Co–Ac photoanode under illumination at 0.67 V vs. RHE in borate buffer. Red and green dashed lines are the theoretical amount of O2 and H2, respectively. 
To confirm that the photocurrent enhancement is due to the enhancement in O2 evolution, not by other photooxidation reactions, the evolved O2 was detected quantitatively using gas chromatography. For BVO/Co–Ac, a high Faradaic efficiency of 98% was obtained for oxygen production, indicating an approximate theoretical maximum value based on charge transfer (Fig. 7b). In contrast, as shown in Fig. S9,† the bare BVO electrode exhibited a lower Faradaic efficiency of 82%, which could be also attributed to the presence of unwanted side reactions such as photocorrosion under consecutive light illumination. These results indicate that Co–Ac serving as a water oxidation catalyst can not only enhance the photocurrent but also selectively increase the water oxidation kinetics via a four-electron-transfer process.
4. Conclusion
In summary, through a simple photodeposition approach, a new type of cobalt-based electrocatalyst was decorated on nanoporous bismuth vanadate. BVO/Co–Ac exhibits a high photocurrent of 2.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and a 450 mV cathodic shift in the onset potential, comparable to the best performance attained by BVO-based photoanodes. Through modification with a cocatalyst, the charge-transfer kinetics is significantly ameliorated, and surface recombination is indeed suppressed. Co–Ac showcases advantages such as low competitive light absorption and higher stability compared to the typical Co–Pi. Our work points out that the elegant design of the catalytic material can produce synergetic effects improving the PEC performance, and the cobalt acetate or a family of transition metal acetates can have enormous potential to solve the dilemma of current investigations on PEC water splitting both in the lab and in industry.
