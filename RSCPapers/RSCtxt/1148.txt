    , Accepted 21st January 2016First published on 1st February 2016AbstractA new microporous robust zirconium metal–organic framework (Zr-MOF), NNU-28, has been synthesized and employed as a visible-light photocatalyst for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to produce formate. NNU-28 is constructed by using a visible light responsive organic ligand derived from an anthracene group. Studies reveal that the as-prepared Zr-MOF shows desirable characteristics including excellent chemical and thermal stability, high CO2 uptake, broad-band visible light absorption and efficient photoinduced charge generation. Remarkably, NNU-28 is highly efficient for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction with a formate formation rate of 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1, which is among the highest performances of Zr-MOFs. Both photocatalytic experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies reveal that both the inorganic building unit Zr6 oxo cluster and the anthracene-based ligand contribute to the highly efficient photocatalysis of CO2 reduction. The dual photocatalytic routes are demonstrated here to be more efficient for visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction than that typically relying on a ligand-to-metal charge transfer process, illustrating a new strategy to design and synthesize novel visible-light photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with high efficiency.
Introduction
Global warming is already underway with consequences that must be faced today as well as tomorrow. Global warming is primarily a problem of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere trapping heat and warming the earth.1 Therefore, the capture and conversion of CO2 have become hot and urgent research topics. One of the most promising techniques is to convert CO2 into various chemical feedstocks using clean solar energy.2 In this context, developing efficient photocatalysts to fulfill the vital mission of photochemical conversion of CO2 becomes a top priority. Inorganic semiconductors such as TiO2,3 CdS,4 ZnS,5 ZnGa2O4,6 and ZnGe2O4 (ref. 7) have been investigated to serve as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction; however these materials show potential drawbacks including a large band gap and fast recombination of the photoinduced excitation state of electron–hole pairs. An ideal visible light photocatalyst for CO2 conversion features the characteristics of multifunctional integration, including efficient visible light absorption, long-lived charge separation of the photoinduced excited state, effective charge migration to the CO2 activators, etc.8 It remains a great challenge to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for solar-driven CO2 conversion.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are inorganic–organic hybrid crystalline compounds that feature diverse structures and permanent porosity.9 Extensive studies have shown that MOFs with an ultra-high surface area and various pore structures are excellent materials to capture and store CO2 molecules.10 Recent studies have demonstrated that some visible-light-responsive MOFs are effective catalysts for CO2 conversion.11–20 Followed by the self-assembly process of crystallization, the rational choice of optically functionalized organic linkers and inorganic metal ions showing variable redox states could introduce simultaneously the photon absorption and catalytic center into the coordinated frameworks of MOFs.21,22 By incorporation of amine groups (–NH2) into terephthalic acid, a series of Zr-MOFs with UIO-type structures have been synthesized and applied for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO2 to formate by taking advantage of the process of linker-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).13,17 These zirconium MOFs are ideal photocatalysts because of their high thermal and chemical stability. The coordination interaction between zirconium ions and carboxylate ligands is strong enough for the as-prepared MOFs to survive the harsh base catalytic conditions for CO2 photoreduction.23 Meanwhile, the inorganic building blocks of Zr6 oxo clusters, sensitized by the excited state of ligands upon visible light absorption, show intervalence redox states from Zr(IV) to Zr(III), supporting catalytic centers.13,17,24 Even though strategies including mixed ligands and/or mixed metal ions have been investigated, it still seems difficult to further increase the photocatalytic efficiency of CO2 reduction by Zr-MOFs, primarily due to the very few choices of photoactive organic ligands. Besides, important issues concerning photocatalytic efficiency such as the broad-band absorption in the visible light region, efficient photoinduced charge generation, the charge transfer pathways etc. are still less understood and difficult to control in MOF materials.
We herein report the synthesis and characterization of a new Zr-MOF, denoted as NNU-28, and its application as a highly efficient photocatalyst for visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO2 to formate. NNU-28 is constructed using a carboxylate ligand derived from an optically active chromophore of anthracene, which shows a high surface area and good thermal and chemical stability. The as-prepared MOF material is highly efficient for CO2 photoreduction with a formate formation rate of 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1, which is among the highest performances of Zr-MOFs. Studies reveal that the photocatalysis of NNU-28 relies on not only the Zr6 oxo cluster sensitized through the LMCT process, but also the anthracene-based ligand by radical formation.
Results and discussion
The carboxylate ligand H2L, 4,4′-(anthracene-9,10-diylbis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))dibenzoic acid was synthesized from the anthracene group by the Sonogashira coupling reaction (see the Experimental section). Orange cubic-shaped single crystals of Zr-MOF NNU-28 with a formula of [Zr6O4(OH)4(L)6]·6DMF were then prepared by a solvothermal reaction of ZrCl4 and H2L in the presence of benzoic acid as a modulator in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that NNU-28 crystallizes in trigonal space group Rm. The Zr4+ ion adopts a square-antiprismatic geometry coordinated to eight oxygen atoms. The inorganic building unit Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 clusters are bridged by anthracene-based ligands showing the isostructure of UIO-66 with fcu-c topology (Fig. 1a and e). Different from the structure of UIO-66, NNU-28 is two-fold interpenetrated due to the use of longer ligand H2L which is elongated by two alkynyl groups (Fig. 1b). Actually, Zr-MOFs with 2-fold interpenetrated networks have been reported previously as PIZOFs by using dicarboxylate ligands with an almost identical length to H2L,25 whereas NNU-28 is different from PIZOFs as π–π stacking interactions between anthracene moieties are observed in NNU-28. The face-to-face distance is ∼3.5 Å. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, these π–π interactions redistrict the total void space of NNU-28 into two distinct cages, the concave and convex cages, with inner diameters of ca. 1.3 and 1.9 nm, respectively.

The purity of the as-prepared Zr-MOF is confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern which fits well with the simulated one from the crystal structure (Fig. S1, ESI†). As evidenced also by the PXRD study, NNU-28 is highly chemically stable as it maintains its structure in either acid or base aqueous solutions with pH values ranging from 0 to 10 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The thermogravimetric (TG) curve suggests that NNU-28 is stable up to 450 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†). The first weight loss of 11.58% at 150 °C corresponds to the removal of DMF molecules in the void space (anal. calcd: 11.23%). The following weight loss (69.70%) from 450 °C to 550 °C is attributed to the decomposition of ligands (anal. calcd: 69.73%).
The solvent accessible volume of NNU-28, calculated by PLATON/SOLV, is 61.6% after being activated.26 N2 sorption isotherms have revealed that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of NNU-28 is 1490 m2 g−1 (Fig. 2a) and the calculated void space is 0.62 cm3 g−1. This void space is also accessible to CO2 molecules. As shown in Fig. 2b, the CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 298 K and 273 K under 1 atm were measured, where it shows CO2 uptakes as high as 33.42 cm3 g−1 and 63.43 cm3 g−1, respectively.

NNU-28 exhibits broad-band visible light absorption up to 650 nm, which is desirable for photocatalytic applications (Fig. 2c). The optical absorption of NNU-28 shows obvious broadening compared to the ligand (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is common for MOFs due to the coordination between the metallic building unit and ligand.27–29 The photoinduced charge generation of NNU-28 upon visible light absorption was then elucidated by means of surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy. The SPV technique is a contactless and nondestructive approach to study photocatalysts based on the illumination-induced change of surface voltage, providing information on photoinduced charge generation.30 NNU-28 displays a wide-range SPV response from 420 nm to 580 nm, indicating its visible-light-induced charge generation. Notably, MOFs with photoinduced charge generation in such a wide visible light region are very rare.31 As shown in Fig. 2d, the SPV spectrum of NNU-28 shows three peaks centered at 436 nm, 466 nm and 491 nm, which is in good accordance with the SPV spectrum of the ligand, suggesting that the photoinduced charge generation in NNU-28 is based on the visible light responsive ligand. The SPV studies suggest that NNU-28 is a potentially visible-light-responsive photocatalyst.
Inspired by its excellent chemical and thermal stability, high CO2 uptake, broad-band visible light absorption and efficient photoinduced charge generation, NNU-28 was examined as a photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2. Previous studies showed that the formate anion of HCOO− is the default product for CO2 photoreduction in acetonitrile when Zr-MOFs were used as photocatalysts.13,17,24 TEOA was typically used in the reaction not only to provide an alkaline medium, but also serves as an electron donor and hydrogen donor to recycle the catalytic process where the aldehyde form is its oxidative product.12,24 The visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO2 by using NNU-28 as the photocatalyst was conducted under the same conditions as those described in the literature, except that the dosage of TEOA was optimized.13 As shown in Fig. 3, the concentration of HCOO− in the reaction, detected and quantitatively analysed by ion chromatography, exhibits a time-dependent increase under continuous visible-light illumination. A total amount of 26.4 μmol formate anions was produced within 10 hours (Fig. S5, ESI†), where the estimated average formation rate of HCOO− is 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1. As summarized and listed in Table 1, it is notable that NNU-28 exhibits a high performance of visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction to formate among the reported Zr-MOF photocatalysts in the system of CH3CN/TEOA, even though strategies including mixed ligands and/or mixed metal ions have been applied for these MOFs to promote their photocatalytic efficiencies.13,17,24 Control experiments were designed to investigate the photocatalytic reaction. Results showed that no formate was produced when the reaction is either in the dark or in the absence of NNU-28. The inhomogenous NNU-28 can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction by centrifugation. PXRD studies suggest that the separated NNU-28 retained its crystal structure (Fig. S6, ESI†). Besides, the concentration of HCOO− remained constant when NNU-28 was removed during the reaction, suggesting the good stability of NNU-28 to survive from the base catalytic conditions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that NNU-28 can be reused for the photoreduction of CO2 without an obvious decrease of activity within three recycling (Fig. S7, ESI†).

It is surprising that NNU-28 exhibits a high efficiency for CO2 photoreduction in the family of Zr-MOFs. This is attributed to the contribution from the anthracene-based ligand. For Zr-MOF photocatalyst NH2-UiO-66, according to the previous reports, the organic ligand of aminoterephthalic acid (H2ATA) serves as an antenna for the visible light harvesting, which is silent itself for the CO2 reduction.13 The only catalytic route in these materials is on the Zr6 oxo cluster where the catalytic efficiency is determined by the LMCT charge transfer process, whereas the anthracene-based ligand in NNU-28 is itself photoactive, as evidenced by the SPV study, which might contribute to the resultant catalytic performance of the Zr-MOF. Control experiments of the anthracene-based ligand showed that 7.2 μmol formate anions can be produced within 10 hours under the same conditions, where the dosage of the ligand was set to be equimolar with that in NNU-28. It is notable that the anthracene-based ligand accounts 27.3% for the total CO2 conversion, if the activities of ligands either in NNU-28 or in solution are assumed to be identical. In order to ensure that the formate anion is only produced by CO2 conversion rather than the decomposition of the ligand, a control experiment of the ligand was carried out where the reaction solution was pre-degassed by N2 instead of CO2. Results showed that there were no detectable HCOO− anions, indicating only conversion from CO2. Besides it is worth noting that the as-prepared Zr-MOF shows three times efficiency compared to the ligand, demonstrating the superiority of the MOF photocatalyst.
The aforementioned studies indicate both the ligand and the Zr6 oxo cluster are catalytic routes for the CO2 photoreduction. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were then carried out in order to interpret the photocatalysis process. The anthracene-based ligand was first studied in the dark where it shows a very weak EPR signal at g = 2.003 assigned to free electrons without coupling, indicative of the radical generation of ligands during the synthesis and/or preservation procedures.32,33 And then the EPR spectrum of the ligand was in situ monitored when the sample was exposed to an external visible light source. As shown in Fig. 4a, a sharp and narrow EPR signal at the same position of g = 2.003 was observed when the ligand was illuminated for several minutes by visible light. This phenomenon confirms the visible-light-induced radical formation of the ligand,34 which explains the photoreduction of CO2 by the ligand. In contrast, the amino ligand of H2ATA shows a weak EPR signal at g = 2.004 under visible light irradiation due to the spatially confined amino group, but it does not show the photoactivity of CO2 reduction.12,13

The freshly prepared crystalline Zr-MOF was subsequently investigated in the dark, where it showed no EPR resonance. As expected the characteristic EPR signal for the radical at g = 2.003 was detected once the MOF sample was in situ exposed to visible light (Fig. 4a). The observation of this signal at g = 2.003 illustrates that free radical formation of the ligand is retained in the MOF structure. The time-evolution in situ EPR measurements of NNU-28 under continuous visible light illumination are shown in Fig. 4b. The intensities of the signals of radicals increased dramatically under continuous visible light illumination and reached the maximum at about 4 min. It is interesting that two new EPR signals at g = 2.009 and 2.030 were gradually observed, which did not occur for the ligand (Fig. S8, ESI†). According to previous studies, these two signals are shown by UIO-66(Zr) and ZrO2 upon absorption of ultraviolet photons, which are attributed to the intervalence change of the Zr6 oxo cluster via a LMCT process (for UIO-66) or the direct excitation (for ZrO2).35,36 In our case, the direct excitation of inorganic building units of the Zr6 oxo cluster in NNU-28 by visible light is hindered by its large band gap (ca. 5.0 eV); hence the EPR signals at g = 2.009 and 2.030 shown by NNU-28 are rationally attributed to the sensitization of the Zr6 oxo cluster through the LMCT process. Therefore, the EPR studies demonstrate clearly that dual catalytic routes exist in NNU-28 where both the anthracene-based organic ligand and the inorganic building unit of the Zr6 oxo cluster through the LMCT process contribute to CO2 photoreduction.
A plausible photocatalytic mechanism of dual catalytic routes in NNU-28 is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 1. Upon the visible light absorption, the anthracene-based ligand in NNU-28 not only acts as an effective visible light harvester to the sensitized Zr6 oxo cluster through the LMCT process, but also generates photoinduced charges by radical formation. The two catalytic routes contribute simultaneously to the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, accounting for the high catalytic performance of NNU-28. It is worth noting that the large conjugacy of the anthracene-based ligand is the origin of the unexpected optical performance for the as-prepared MOF. This verifies that it is a feasible method to design new visible light photocatalysts of MOFs by incorporation of optically functionalized organic chromophores.

Conclusions
In summary, anthracene-functionalized zirconium metal–organic framework NNU-28 was constructed and demonstrated as an excellent photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to give formate. Remarkably, it shows a high formate formation rate of 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1 among the reported photocatalysts of Zr-based MOFs. Studies revealed that both the anthracene-based organic ligand and Zr6 oxo cluster serve as photocatalytic centers for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. The dual catalytic routes in NNU-28 have been demonstrated to be more efficient than the typical photocatalysis based only on a ligand-to-metal charge transfer process, illustrating a new strategy to design and synthesize novel visible light responsive MOF photocatalysts with high efficiency.
Experimental section
Materials
Zirconium(IV) chloride (ZrCl4, 99.5%) was purchased from Strem. Benzoic acid (98%) was purchased from TCI. Acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.9%) was purchased from Acros. Other reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
Synthesis of NNU-28 ([Zr6O4(OH)4(L)6]·6DMF)
A mixture of ZrCl4 (90 mg, 0.39 mmol), H2L (120 mg, 0.26 mmol) and benzoic acid (1200 mg, 9.83 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (18 ml), followed by stirring for 30 min at room temperature. And then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon autoclave at 100 °C for 3 days to give orange cubic-shaped crystals. Yield: 60% (based on the ligand). IR (KBr cm−1): 3643 (w), 3042 (w), 2200 (w), 1650 (w), 1596 (s), 1533 (m), 1409 (s), 1170 (m), 762 (m), 636 (s), and 466 (w).
Synthesis of ligand H2L
The anthracene-based carboxylate ligand H2L was synthesized following the literature procedure with minor revision.37 Ethyl 4-ethynylbenzoate (2.0 g, 11.49 mmol), 9,10-dibromoanthracene (1.74 g, 5.18 mmol), Pd(Ph3)2Cl2 (90 mg, 0.13 mmol) and CuI (45 mg, 0.24 mmol) were added into the DMF and Et3N mixed solution (40 ml, v/v = 1:1) under a N2 atmosphere. After being stirred at 80 °C for 48 h, the reaction product was quenched with water, extracted with CHCl3, washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. Recrystallization of CHCl3 gave the product as a red solid. To this product (0.708 g, 1.92 mmol) dissolved in THF/methanol/H2O (1:1:1, 45 mL), KOH was added (1.74 g, 12.64 mmol) and the resulting solution was stirred under reflux for 24 h and monitored by TLC. The mixture was acidified with aq. HCl, and then the precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water.
Characterization
UV-Vis spectra of solid state samples were measured on a HITACHI U-4100 spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D-MAX 2550 diffractometer using Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 0.15417 nm) with 2θ ranging from 3° to 40°. Surface areas were measured by using N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy was carried out on an instrument equipped with a xenon lamp of 500 W, precision monochromators, a SR-830 Lock-in amplifier and a chopper. The SPV measurements were conducted with the sample in a sandwich cell (ITO/sample/cathode) using the light source-monochromator-lock-in detection technique in the range of 300–800 nm. EPR spectra were obtained on a JES-FA 200 EPR spectrometer; scanning frequency: 9.45 GHz; central field: 340 mT; scanning width: 40 mT; scanning power: 0.998 mW; scanning temperature: 25 °C. The in situ EPR experiments were carried out using a 500 W xenon arc lamp where a 420 nm optical filter was used to cut off ultraviolet light. The stable radical of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a standard for the calculation of g values. The formed formate was detected by using a Dionex ICS-1000 IC system. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer.
Crystal structure determination
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collection of the compound NNU-28 was performed on a Bruker Smart ApexII CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. Absorption corrections were applied by using the multiscan program SADABS. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 with anisotropic displacement using SHELXTL.38 The zirconium ions were easily located and then non-hydrogen atoms (O and C) were placed from the subsequent Fourier-difference maps. Because guest solvent molecules in the large void space are highly disordered and could not be modeled properly; thus the SQUEEZE program of PLATON was applied to remove contributions to scattering from these guest molecules. The reported structure is refined as the guest-free structure. The details of the data collection and the refinement are supported, see Table S1.† The X-ray crystallographic coordinates of NNU-28 reported in this article have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), under deposition number CCDC 1412713.
Photocatalytic reactions
The freshly prepared NNU-28 was washed with DMF (20 mL × 3) to remove the adhesive ligand molecules on the crystals, followed by a solvent exchange process by soaking crystals in dry methanol and dichloromethane for 1 day, respectively. The crystals were then evaporated under vacuum at 100 °C for 4 hours and stored under a CO2 atmosphere at room temperature for further use. NNU-28 (50 mg, 14.4 μmol) or H2L (40.2 mg, 86.4 μmol, the same amount as that in NNU-28) was added into the CH3CN/TEOA mixed solution (60 mL, v/v = 30/1) which has been pre-degassed with CO2 to remove the dissolved O2 for 30 min. The photocatalytic reactions are under a CO2 atmosphere at ambient pressure, except the control experiment under N2. The concentration of formate was detected by using a Dionex ICS-1000 IC system and 8 mM NaOH solution was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 303 K. The light source is a 300W Xe lamp where UV and IR filters were used to remove light less than 420 nm and larger than 800 nm.
