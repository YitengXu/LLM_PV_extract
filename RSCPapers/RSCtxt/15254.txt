    , Accepted 1st March 2022First published on 1st March 2022AbstractBiomass-derived carbohydrates are selectively converted into platform chemicals such as levulinic acid (LA) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Among those platform chemicals, LA is one of the most promising and sustainable chemicals. LA can be upgraded into oxygenated fuels, chemicals, and polymers which is of tremendously significant interest for a decrease in dependence on fossil fuel resources and to resolve environmental issues. Biomass-derived alkyl valerate esters such as methyl, ethyl and pentyl valerate esters have potential applications in renewable additives for diesel fuels and gasoline. A previous review focused primarily on reports of the conversion of LA to γ-valerolactone (GVL) and valeric esters (VE). Here we have concentrated mainly on the direct transformation of LA to valeric acid (VA) and GVL to VA synthesis which is a significant pathway in biorefinery industrial development. VA is the most crucial platform molecule for the synthesis of valeric biofuels. This review can provide valuable information for the research and exploitation of LA to VA synthesis via a one-pot synthesis over noble and non-noble metal-supported catalysts and electrocatalytic systems. GVL to VA synthesis has been reported. Thus, this systematic review on the catalytic conversion of VA from LA and GVL will offer guidelines for designing efficient catalysts for biomass conversion.

1. Introduction
Renewable resources are alternative sources for the substitution of fossil resources, which is a predominant challenge for our society. Fossil fuel feedstock mainly contributes to natural gas, petroleum and coal which are mainly produced by the natural anaerobic decomposition of buried organisms.1 In biorefinery technologies, agro-biomass is recognized as a renewable source for the production of chemicals and fuels. In the petrochemical industry, methanol and lower olefins such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene, and aromatics like benzene, toluene, and xylene are produced as main chemicals and then further converted into industrial products.2–7 The world's utilization of fossil fuels and chemicals which are derived from non-replaceable petroleum resources has increased remarkably. The depletion of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons increases environmental pollution and the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere, which leads to climate change.8 According to recent reports, the greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) that emerge from the use of petroleum-based resources are one of the alarming challenges confronting our human society.9 World demand for energy is predicted to rise by up to 48% until the year 2040. The Department of Energy, of the United States is representing a range of 549 to 815 quadrillion British thermal units of consumption in its reports.10 Solar, wind and hydro power generation are obtained from renewable resources when compared to biomass which is an alternative, carbon-neutral and attractive energy source in our industrial society.11 Lignocellulosic biomass has been transformed into chemicals and fuels and it has a meager price, is renewable, abundant, non-toxic, biocompatible and non-edible.12,13 Biomass mainly contributes three main components: hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin.14 For commercial production, challenges mainly pertain to renewable chemicals and biofuels.
From the above criteria, lignocellulose could be utilized in different ways. In the first step, lignocellulosic biomass is fractionated into three major components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin with different chemical properties which produce different products. Whereas in the second step, biomass is transformed into either a complex liquid or gasified form. These can be further converted into a gaseous mixture of products. Cellulose is a biopolymer with a combination of glucosidic linkages, whereas hydrolysis is very difficult because it is a stable molecule. Compared to cellulose, hydrolysis of hemicellulose to produce arabinose and xylose is very easy. It is a very important source of green, renewable chemicals and biofuels. These components are further converted into different value-added products. In 2004, the U.S. Dept. of National Renewable Energy Laboratory identified 12 platform chemicals: 1,4-diacids such as fumaric, succinic and maleic acids, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid, glutamic acid, glucaric acid, aspartic acid, LA, itaconic acid (IA), 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, sorbitol, glycerol and xylitol/arabinitol.15 LA is produced from cellulose via an acid catalytic process through an HMF intermediate and this can be rehydrated to produce LA and formic acid (FA).16–18 The reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

In the past decade, different strategic plans have been applied to convert these building blocks such as HMF, LA and sorbitol into various products such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, propane and other oxygenated fuels like alcohols and ethers.19–36 These platform chemicals act as bridges between liquid fuels and chemicals.37,38 HMF is converted into various promising chemicals, such as 2,5-dihydromethylfuran and 2,5-dihydromethyltetrahydrofuran, which are used as monomers in the synthesis of polyesters, 5-(ethoxymethyl) furfural, an excellent additive in the synthesis of diesel fuel, and 1,6-hexanediol, which is used as a diol in the synthesis of caprolactone and caprolactam.39–43 While LA is one of the most important biomass-derived chemicals which can be converted into a wide range of other chemicals, including solvents, fuels, monomers for polymers, surfactants, plasticizers, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, n-octane and valeric anhydride.44,45 LA contains carboxylic acid and keto reactive groups. It can be selectively converted into different chemicals. The hydrogenation of LA produces 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), which is an additive in the gasoline component,46–53 and LA also produces γ-valerolactone (GVL), VA, dimethyltetrahydrofuran and 1,4-pentanediol. GVL is considered as a sustainable and green solvent for the synthesis of carbon-based consumer products.54–60 Mixture of ethanol (EtOH) and GVL, the ratio of 10 v/v% EtOH or GVL and 90 v/v% 95-octane gasoline compounds.55 GVL is a transportation fuel that can be utilized for the synthesis of lubricants, plasticizers, flavors and solvents for insoluble resins. Among those chemicals, the hydrogenation of the keto group can produce VA which can be used for the synthesis of various products like refrigerants, flavors, valerates, n-octane, valeric anhydride and also other downstream products of natural gas.61 MTHF is used as a commercial solvent and can be produced from renewable resources and its properties are placed between those of THF and diethyl ether.62 In organometallic reactions, THF can be replaced with MTHF.62 Ethyl levulinate (EL) is synthesized by esterifying EtOH with LA both of which are biomass-derived chemicals.63,64 EL can be used in the flavoring, aroma and fuel sectors of industry, etc. It is miscible in diesel biofuel and 5 wt% is used in diesel car engines.65,66 Among those chemicals, VA is useful in commercial products and it is an intermediate in the manufacture of perfumes, cosmetics, flavors, ester-type lubricants, plasticizers, refrigerants and vinyl stabilizers. Furthermore, it is also used as a food additive and in synthetic flavoring substances. The transformation of levulinic acid to different value-added chemicals is shown in Fig. 2.

2. Structure and properties of VA
VA is also called pentanoic acid (PA). It is a straight-chain saturated alkyl carboxylic acid containing five carbon atoms and its chemical and physical properties are listed in Table 1. It is an important platform chemical for synthesizing chemical intermediates and biofuels. The high energy density of ethyl valerates and methyl valerates showed better fuel performance than EtOH, n-butanol, EL, GVL and MTHF.48,67 A combination of these two esters could be used as agents in both diesel and gasoline fuels.68–72 VA can also be used as a feedstock for the sustainable production of cellulosic transportation fuels and alkanes.39,73,74

Generally, LA contains carbonyl and acid groups. The keto group is selectively hydrogenated to produce VA. The upgrading of LA to VA synthesis using thermocatalytic hydrogenation (TCH) systems has gained a lot of attention in recent years because it can be used as a precursor for producing VE which has a good smell. It is used in the manufacture of perfumes and the cosmetic industry, with VA having a very unpleasant smell.75 It has its origin in the flowering plant valerian.74 The main usage of VA is the synthesis of its esters.48 EV and pentylvalerate (PV) have a fruity flavor that can be used in food additives.76 Moreover, VA is transformed into 5-nonane (dibutyl ketone) which is an industrial solvent in the paint and resins industry and also an important biofuel precursor in gas-phase ketonization technology.77 Currently, VA is synthesized industrially from 1-butene and syngas via an oxo-process with the oxidation of aldehyde to produce VA.78 Recently, VA has been formed as an intermediate in cellulosic biofuels.79 Reaction schemes for VA to value-added chemicals are shown in Fig. 3.

Synthesis of VA using various feedstocks is available, mainly using LA and GVL.
3.2 Transformation of LA to VA using TCH systems
Thermocatalaytic biomass conversion systems are studied in the liquid phase and vapor phase. Table 2 gives more information about the differences between the vapor phase and liquid phase.
Table 2 Comparison between vapor-phase and liquid-phase reactions




Vapor-phase reactions
Liquid-phase reactions




Vapor-phase reactions are more efficient and environmentally benign because they require lower H2 pressure, and have continuous operation and easy product separation80
Compared to vapor-phase reactions, liquid-phase reactions require high pressure; it is difficult to separate the product; and they are not continuous processes


Compared to liquid-phase reactions, they could give lower yields and require high temperatures economically
To enhance the high yield and increase the selectivity, they require mild reaction conditions and this is beneficial for the design of new catalysts


In a vapor-phase reaction, the resistance time is very low and the diffusivity is in the order of 1 × 10−9
In the liquid-phase reaction, the resistance time is higher and the diffusivity is in the order of 1 × 10−5 at room temperature


The wall effects are much more important in vapor-phase reactions whereas diffusion is faster than in liquid-phase reactions
In liquid-phase reactions, leaching is a major problem and it leads to both a decrease in activity and pollution of the product stream81





3.2.1 LA to VA synthesis by noble metal-supported catalysts. 
Noble metal-supported catalysts have gained more attention because of their wide range of utilizations in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and oxidation reactions. Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt and Au supported catalysts are mostly used for the LA to GVL synthesis. Noble metals supported on acidic zeolites are highly efficient and beneficial for synthesizing VA and VE from LA.40 The hydrogenation of LA to VA using water as a solvent which goes through several tandem reactions and intermediates was also achieved. The following steps are involved in the synthesis of VA:48 (i) hydro-cyclization of LA to GVL using a hydrogenation catalyst and acid sites, (ii) ring-opening of GVL on acid site catalysts to form pentanoate ester isomers and (iii) further subsequent reduction to produce VA. In recent years, the challenges of integrating these consecutive reactions into a single-step process using a bifunctional catalyst have received significant interest. The conversion of LA to VA requires metallic sites with a reducing property and active acid sites.82–84 Lange et al. have reported the synthesis of valeric biofuel, which consisted of acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to form LA. This LA was hydrogenated to produce GVL and VA was esterified to produce valerate esters. Here, lignocellulosic biomass was converted into LA by H2SO4 and LA was converted to GVL by Pt/TiO2 catalysts and the selectivity was 95%. VA was synthesized from GVL using Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts with a selectivity of 90% obtained at a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 2 h−1 at a temperature of 250 °C and H2 pressure of 10 bar. The reaction was kept for 1500 h and the catalysts were regenerated by hot H2 strips at 400 °C and 10 bar.48 Lou et al. reported that LA to VA synthesis using a 1% Ru/HZSM-5 catalyst yielded VA + VE mixtures with a 45.8% yield at 4 MPa H2 and 200 °C for 10 hours in dioxane solvent. Moreover, the Ru/HZSM-5 was quickly deactivated, owing to the leaching of the Ru and Al species because of the highly corrosive and polar nature of LA.74 The decrease in catalytic activity can be examined with fresh and used catalysts to find any changes in the morphology of the metal particles, supported by using some characterization techniques such as XRD, BET, TEM and 27Al MAS NMR analysis. From the TEM analysis, the particle sizes of the fresh and spent catalysts were examined which showed that the particle sizes of the spent catalyst had slightly increased. In the liquid phase the leaching of the Ru catalysts was analysed by AAS. The Ru/ZSM-5 catalysts showed the highest loss compared to the other catalysts. XRD analysis gave information about the spent catalysts which showed that the shift in 2θ values demonstrated expansion of the unit cell. Whereas the pyridine FT-IR suggested that the spent catalysts showed a higher number of Lewis acidic sites compared to the fresh catalyst, which was attributed to framework dealumination. This dealumination was identified by 27Al MAS NMR and also from the BET surface area that showed that the spent catalysts exhibited a lower BET surface area and pore volume. The same group reported Ru effects with extra-framework cations of H+ and NH4+ and Si/Al ratio in ZSM-5 zeolite for the synthesis of VA from LA at 200 °C, 4 MPa and H2 in dioxane with a reaction time of 10 h. With increasing number of acid sites on the zeolite support, which is favorable for an increase in VA + VE yield, with 91.3% and leads to coke formation and decrement of the yield of 66.4%. The decrease in catalytic activity is mainly attributed to high Brønsted acidity can be easily cause coke formation. The proximity effect between metal and acid sites is key factor for higher catalytic performance in one-step synthesis.82 The catalyst was regenerated by coke burn-off at 500 °C with a flow of diluted hydrogen. After regeneration, the spent catalyst gave 81.2 mol% of VA, indicating that the catalyst could be completely recovered after coke burn-off. From the bimodal particle size distribution of the Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-TEM) exhibited small particles <2 nm as well as larger particles, such as 4–5 nm, observed on the external surface of ZSM-5. During the regeneration process, strong acidity was also retained and the TPD results suggested that Al leaching is very low under the reaction conditions and deposited coke is no block to the accessibility of acidic sites for NH3. The overall strength of the acidic sites should decrease upon first and second runs. Some of the strong acidic sites could be converted into weak acidic sites and the remaining strong acidic sites are on average less strong. Better control of the density of strong acidic sites playing a key role in achieving high selectivity of VA from LA. Pan et al. developed a 5 wt% Ru doped SBA–SO3H catalyst for LA to VA + VE synthesis, and 94% yield was obtained at 240 °C, 4 MPa H2, and 6 h of reaction time. This is mainly due to the efficient conversion of GVL over Brønsted acid sites. Significant loss of sulfur occurred, up to 45.7% from SBA–SO3H in LA conversion, resulting in a loss of catalyst acidity and a decrease in VA + VE yield. In addition, non-noble metal Cu and Ni-based bifunctional catalysts with 5% loadings were also applied. Under the co-catalysis of Ni/SBA-15 and SBA-SO3H, VA and EV with a yield of 33% were obtained with 100% conversion of LA and a decrease in the yield might be attributed to Ni having a lower hydrogenation property compared to the Ru particles.83 Kon et al. further studied the LA to VA synthesis on Pt/HMFI at 200 °C and H2 pressure of 8 bar for 6 h in solvent-free conditions, which showed a 99% yield of VA. A lower reaction temperature would lead to an obvious decrease in selectivity for VA: a higher GVL yield of 68% and a lower VA yield of 13% were obtained at 150 °C. In methanol solvent at 200 °C with 0.8 MPa H2 for 3 h, the catalysts produced 87% methyl valerate.84 A synergistic effect existed between Pt and Brønsted acidic sites of HMFI. Herein, the first step was hydrogenation of LA which occurred on the Pt surface to form GVL which underwent protonation and ring-opening by HMFI and finally formed VA on the Pt catalyst surface. After the reaction was complete, the catalyst recovered during the third cycle yielded 52% VA. CO adsorption experiment result on the Pt/HMFI after the third-cycle showed an average Pt particle size of 6.8 nm, while the fresh catalyst particle size is 1.9 nm. This result indicates that the sintering of Pt particles is responsible for the decrease in activity. The ICP-AES analysis showed an Al content of 28 ppm, indicating that dealumination was found during the reaction, which can be supported by previous results.74 The dealumination could decrease the interaction between the HMFI support and Pt cluster, resulting in the sintering of Pt particles. The dealumination also contributes to a decrease in the number of Brønsted acid sites. In biomass conversions, Pt-based catalysts suffer carbon deposition, but the amount of carbonaceous species and deposits do not correlate directly with the loss of activity, or it may be the transformation of smaller Pt species into larger Pt species which is responsible for the loss of catalytic activity. The deactivation can be suppressed with a small amount of Sn atomically dispersed on the support surface in the spent catalyst, which helps in the redispersion of Pt. The role of Sn is to help in the regeneration of Pt by providing nucleation sites on the support surface.85 Zhou et al. reported on different metal triflates used as organic Lewis acid and Pd/C catalysts. A Pd/C-Zr(OTf)4 catalyst demonstrated LA conversion >99% and VA selectivity of 85% with a reaction temperature of 150 °C and H2 pressure of 5 MPa for 6 h with n-octane. From a comparison of these two Zr triflates and Pd/C-Hf(OTf)4, the latter showed a 92% VA yield under the same reaction conditions. The separation of the metal triflates is difficult due to their homogeneous solubility after completion of the reaction and Pd leaching. Coke formation occurring on the catalyst surface blocks the accessibility to active acid sites and metallic sites and decreases the VA selectivity when the catalyst is reused.86 Wang et al. reported that Pd nanoparticles were encapsulated in the mesoporous structure of AlMCM-41 when the reaction was conducted at 270 °C with 6 MPa H2 pressure and 10 h reaction time in an n-octane solvent with a high, >99%, LA conversion, but the yield of VA was as low as 45%.87 Gu et al. investigated a Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst which was synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and tested for LA to VA synthesis.88 The catalyst is good and highly active, a stable bifunctional catalyst which can be used up to five cycles with 91.4% yield of VA in H2O solvent. The formation of VA correlates with the strong interaction between Pt and H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The H-ZSM-5
zeolite structure and its acid sites were not affected by the addition of Pt nanoparticles. These Pt particles were located in HZSM-5 channels and the results reveal that the ALD technique is beneficial for the protection of the zeolite structure. Whereas in the case of the impregnation method the HZSM-5 zeolite pore structure might be easily damaged.89,90 However, by treatment with the ALD technique, some Pt nanoparticles are deposited in the microporous channels of HZSM-5. The microporous structure and acidic sites of HZSM-5 remain stable, which indicates that ALD is an important technique for protection of the zeolite structure in catalyst preparation. Mariscal et al. reported that different acidic supports on Pd catalysts had an influence on the performance of LA to VA synthesis and their esters. Amorphous SiO2–Al2O3 as well as several commercial zeolites were investigated. With different metal loadings of 0, 1, 2 and 4 wt% at a reaction temperature of 240 °C, 4 MPa H2, the reaction time was 8 h with EtOH. It showed 100% LA conversion and 92% VA + EV yield was obtained with the 2% Pd/ZSM-5 catalyst. A sufficient number of acidic sites can significantly impact the ring-opening of GVL for the further production of VA.91 The Shell Company has received a patent for the conversion of LA to GVL and subsequent GVL conversion to VA with 70% yield over a Pt/H-ZSM-5/SiO2 catalyst.92 Dumesic et al. reported LA to VA and 5-nonanone synthesis via a GVL intermediate over Ru/C for LA to GVL synthesis and over Pd/Nb2O5 for GVL to VA and 5-nonanone.93 The acid-functionalized neutral materials were used as a support for Ru-based bifunctional catalysts. Compared to the parent Ru/OMC catalyst, the Ru catalyst supported on H3PO4 modified with ordered mesoporous carbon (Ru/OMC-P) exhibited higher VA selectivity. The selectivities for GVL and VA were 62% and 35% obtained over Ru/OMC-P with nearly complete conversion of LA. However, further opening of GVL on Ru/OMC is very difficult.94 Bhanu et al. reported that Pt–WO3/γ-Al2O3 was synthesized by using a simple wet impregnation method with Pt loadings ranging from 0.5 to 3 wt% and 10 wt% of WO3. Among all the catalysts, the 2% Pt–10WO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited VA with 58% and 91% LA conversion. The higher activity is mainly due to the availability of a higher number of surface acidic active sites and Pt active sites on the catalyst surface.95 The effect of TOS was studied for up to 60 h and for a reaction time of 5 h, the highest LA conversion and selectivity for VA exhibited by the catalysts were 91% and 58%, respectively. However, the maximum conversion and selectivity remained stable up to 25 h and subsequently decreased over time. The TOS result reveals that deactivation might be attributed to the blocking of active acid sites by coke formation, which can be identified by CHNS techniques. From the BET analysis, the BET surface area values of the used catalyst decreased compared to those of the fresh catalyst. Al-Naji et al. investigated the preparation of Pt/ZrO2 catalysts and conducted experiments in aqueous-phase LA to GVL synthesis using FA. A 1.6% Pt/ZrO2 catalyst at a higher reaction temperature of 260 °C tends to shift the reaction equilibrium from GVL to VA with a yield of 22% after 24 h.96 The LA to VA synthesis using FA was tested over a 2% Pt/ZSM-5(11) catalyst. At a reaction time of 6 h at 270 °C, FA was completely converted. The LA conversion gradually increased with reaction time and there was also an increase in both GVL and VA yield. With reaction times of 6 h and 12 h, the GVL yield remained constant at 50%. The VA yield gradually increased from 20 to 40%. LA was completely converted in a period of 24 h; the GVL yield decreased from 50 to 30%; and at the same time the yield of VA increased to 68%.97 The support has a significant influence on the catalyst activity. To enhance the reaction efficiency and selectivity, different catalyst systems were used as supports. The reaction was conducted with 3 ml of hexane and 12 ml of H2O, with a temperature of 240 °C/4 h for LA to VA synthesis over Pt/Al2O3, Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/ZrO2 as catalysts. LA was completely converted in 4 h and the product yields of VA were 69.8, 77.1 and 78.8%, whereas the yields of n-butane were 14.7, 7.5 and 7.2%.98 For the catalytic activity of LA with formic acid converted into GVL, a 2.6% Pt/0.7La–Y(ss) catalyst with autogenous pressure, at 220 °C for 24 h demonstrated the highest GVL selectivity while also facilitating VA formation with a yield of 7%, which was not observed for a 2.7% Pt/Y catalyst. VA is obtained by GVL ring-opening, which strongly depends on the presence of active metal sites and acid sites.74 The 2.6% Pt/0.7La–Y(ss) catalyst demonstrated that VA is obtained from LA, implying that doping of La3+ cations increases hydrothermal stability and can preserve the activity of metal/acidic sites of 2.6% Pt/0.7La–Y(ss) for a longer reaction time, allowing for the subsequent reaction of GVL to PA.99 Reaction over Ru or Ni-supported catalysts showed LA to GVL, VA and PE were achieved. 3% RuZrMCM and 3% RuTiMCM catalysts showed the conversion and GVL yields reached 90% with a small amount of VA, <5%, being formed. When HZSM-5 was used as a strong acidic support, a 3% NiHZSM catalyst performed similarly to a 3%NiTiMCM catalyst where GVL is the main product with a yield of 93.1%. Surprisingly, for an Ru/HZSM catalyst under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst exhibited a mixture of VA and VE with a yield of 85.7% and GVL with a 1.2% yield.100
The complete elimination of catalyst deactivation is not possible, but we can minimise the rate of damage by understanding the mechanisms, thereby enabling control over the deactivation process, such as control over catalyst properties, through processing conditions like temperature, pressure, feedstock impurities, methods of contact, and process design. While the feed can be taken by using guard beds, scrubbers, or filters. Fouling, thermal degradation, and chemical degradation can be minimized through careful control over process conditions: for example, lowering the temperature to lower the sintering rate or adding steam, oxygen, or hydrogen to the feed to gasify carbon or coke-forming precursors.101 Mechanical degradation can be minimized by a careful choice of carrier materials, coatings, and/or methods of catalyst particle formation. Coke formation can also be minimized by appropriately selecting the catalyst support and also the catalyst modifier. Mechanical modes of deactivation such as attrition have also been minimised by modifying the reactor design and the shape and structure of the catalysts. Modifications to the reactant feed makeup and reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, have also been investigated as excellent approaches to reducing catalyst deactivation, as was catalyst encapsulation to prevent catalyst deactivation. Important parameters such as the synthesis of catalysts by ALD, strong metal–support interaction, non-hydrolytic sol–gel, and core–shell methods are useful for catalyst coating, which is beneficial for enhancement of its stability.102 For LA to VA synthesis, strong acidity is beneficial for the ring-opening of GVL, but at the same time controlling coke formation requires a weakening of the strong acidic sites, so it is necessary to establish stable and prominent bifunctional catalysts. Whereas in catalyst preparation methods, the acidity of the zeolite is tuned via the Si/Al ratio,103 pH value, and calcination temperature.104 And also, alkali or alkaline earth metals can be introduced by the ion exchange method, stream treatment and aging in hot water.105


3.2.2 LA to VA synthesis over non-noble metal catalysts. 
Recently, several studies have focused on the development of bifunctional catalysts and various reaction conditions have been established for the direct transformation of LA to VA. Many reports have shown that noble metal catalysts can be supported by acidic oxides. They are highly active for hydrogenation reactions but they come at a high price and also suffer from deactivation by coke formation and deposition on the surface of the catalyst. These drawbacks can be prevent their technological implementation in future biorefineries.71–73,106 Compared to noble metal-based catalysts, there have been very few reports of non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts. Direct conversion of LA into VA over non-noble metal catalysts is a great approach for a comparison of their costs with those of noble metal catalysts.107 Sun et al. reported an LA to VA and EV synthesis on a Co@HZSM-5 catalyst in batch and fixed-bed reactors with a reaction temperature of 240 °C, 3 MPa H2 in H2O or EtOH as a solvent. As a reactant EtOH achieved 100% LA conversion with a yield of 97% VA + VE. The CoNPs were encapsulated in HZSM-5 zeolite, which shows high stability and prevented the suppression, leaching and sintering of Co in liquid-phase reaction conditions.108 Later they also reported on coke formation on the K-doped Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst. The addition of K is beneficial for decreasing the strong acidity and tuning the Brønsted acidity/Lewis acidity. The acidity reduction with the addition of K can reduce the heavier coke component to a lighter one, thus the prolonging the lifetime of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst. The best catalyst, Ni/K0.5/HZSM-5, showed a longer catalyst lifetime of 80 h, while Ni/HZSM-5 was deactivated after 20 h.109 The relationship between the nature of the coke deposits and tuning of catalyst acidity could help to produce a better understanding of catalyst deactivation and the selection of a stable catalyst for the upgrading of biomass and its platform molecules. Ni-Based catalysts are prone to deactivation of their active surface sites by S and C species contained in the gas feed to the reactor.110 For LA to VA synthesis, this is a key factor for their use in successive reaction–regeneration cycles with reproducible behavior. According to the TPS-N2 of used catalysts, the soft coke can be easily removed after sweeping. A minimum temperature is required to remove soft coke. This sweeping is a prior step for coke combustion and aims to remove most of the compounds confined within the porous structure of the catalyst, whose uncontrolled combustion may generate hot spots and irreversible deterioration in catalyst acidity. Around 90% of the carbonaceous species retained on the spent catalysts can be attributed to this soft coke. The incomplete recovery of the initial activity may caused by the presence of hard coke formed during the reaction and by the aging of soft coke to form hard coke under sweeping at high temperature. Thus the hard coke remaining after sweeping requires a subsequent combustion step for its complete removal.111,112 The effect of W on a 20 wt% of Ni/TiO2 catalyst was investigated for LA to VA synthesis at ambient H2 pressure and 270 °C/6 h. Among those catalysts, a 1.5 wt% W-20 wt% Ni/TiO2 catalyst showed 73.3% LA conversion and 48.5% VA while 36.3% of GVL and the remaining other products were obtained.113 Kumar et al. investigated the LA to VA synthesis over different supported systems, such as Ni–W/Al2O3, Ni–W/SiO2, Ni/HZSM-5 and Ni–W/H-ZSM-5 at 270 °C. The W-doped Ni/H-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited ∼40% LA conversion and selectivity of ∼65% PA with a reaction time of 6 h. Whereas Ni–W/SiO2 and Ni–W/Al2O3 catalysts showed lower selectivity towards VA. The increase in VA production over the Ni–W/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was mainly contributed by the strong acid sites and a higher number of surface Ni ion species. A synergistic effect existed between Ni and W species which was beneficial for an enhancement in VA production.114 Novodárszki et al. reported that when Ni supported on silica catalysts was tested under solvent-free conditions, LA conversion at 250 and 275 °C, and 1–13 bar pressure had a space-time range of 0.1–1.0 gcat g−1 LA h. LA was first dehydrated to form an α-angelica lactone (AL) intermediate at 250 °C and 1 bar reaction pressure, which was further hydrogenated to form GVL as a product. A space-time of 0.25 gcat g−1 LA h with 82% GVL selectivity and 100% LA conversion was achieved. GVL can be partially converted into PA with a selectivity of 36.6%.115 Recently, Kim et al. tested Nb–Cu/Zr incorporated silica at 150 °C and 3 MPa H2 for 4 h in an H2O solvent. The catalyst showed 99.8% VA yield. Both Lewis and Brønsted acidity could improve the adsorption of LA and VA on the catalyst surface, preventing metal leaching and coke formation.116 The weaker acid strength can be beneficial for prevents the deactivation of the catalyst by fouling with coke formation, which may prolong the catalyst lifetime. The incorporation of promoters into the support can change its acidic properties, which is required for the development of well-planned and stable catalysts. Recently, Bhavani et al. reported on the one-pot conversion of LA to VA over different rare earth metals such as La, Pr, Er, Nd, Sm, Y, and Ce doped on Ni supported TiO2 catalysts, investigated at ambient pressure.117 The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectra of adsorbed FA indicate that its surface basicity was enhanced upon modification of Ni/TiO2 with an La promoter. Among them the La-doped Ni/TiO2 catalyst showed promising activity and stability for VA synthesis. The doping of La into the Ni/TiO2 catalyst, which is beneficial for the reduction behavior of Ni species and acid-basic nature, affects the hydrogenation activity to produce GVL and VA. The sintering of Ni particles also contributes to the deactivation of the catalysts.118 The regeneration of the catalysts has attracted great attention due to its importance for the economic viability of VA synthesis. The catalysts can be regenerated by calcination in air at 600 °C for 3 h, and also removal of S by stream treatment at a high temperature of 700–800 °C.119,120 The experimental results reveal that the high-temperature oxidation process was the most effective process for regenerating the poisoned catalyst.121 The La-doped Ni/TiO2 catalyst showed VA selectivity of 41.6% and then the Pr-modified Ni/TiO2 catalyst showed 14.2% selectivity for VA. The remaining catalysts were found to be selective towards GVL. The higher VA selectivity was explained due to a synergistic interaction between Ni and La species. The ring-opening of GVL on the La-modified Ni/TiO2 catalyst was investigated by DRIFT spectra and N2O analysis.122 Seguel et al. investigated Ag effects on substitution in La1−xAgxCoO3 catalysts in LA conversion, conducted at 250 °C in a batch reactor with 50 bar of H2 pressure. The higher catalytic activity of non-substituted LaCoO3 is mainly attributed to the high number of surface Co2+ species. Ag substitution enhances the stability of the perovskite in a reducing atmosphere was studied, with xAg = 0.05 being the most stable. LA conversion increases at lower reaction times, followed by HPA dehydration to form GVL and further hydrogenation to produce VA. The reduction of cobalt species and basic sites on Ag-substituted perovskites promotes LA conversion and higher compound selectivity during hydrogenation.123 Golubeva et al. recently investigated LA to VA synthesis over Ni-TOP catalysts, and at 350 °C and 6 h of reaction time, the VA selectivity was found to be 94%.124 We have summarized the noble and non-noble supported metal catalysts for hydrogenation of LA to VA and the reaction conditions are presented in Table 3. Among the various transition metal-based catalysts in LA to VA synthesis, Pt-based catalytic systems have been the most extensively applied because of the synergistic interaction between Pt and the acid sites of zeolites which is beneficial for the selective synthesis of VA.82,83 Compared to all the transition metal-based catalysts, the Ni-based catalyst showed the best conversion and selectivity for VA.109

3.3 Transformation of GVL to VA
GVL is a relatively stable molecule under the hydrogenation reaction conditions for the GVL to VA synthesis, which is a key step in a one-step synthesis. LA to VA synthesis via the GVL route is shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Selective hydrogenation of LA to VA synthesis. 
From GVL to VA synthesis over bifunctional catalysts which contains both hydrogenation and acidic functionalities (Table 4). Serrano-Ruiz et al. synthesized a series of Pd/Nb2O5 catalysts for the GVL to VA synthesis conducted under different reaction conditions of Pd loading, the effect of temperature, partial hydrogen pressure and WHSV, etc., all of which have a significant impact on their catalytic behavior. The catalysts showed higher selectivity for VA with 0.1 wt% Pd/Nb2O5 catalysts conducted at 325 °C, 50 wt% GVL in water and hydrogen diluted in helium gas. They achieved VA with 92% selectivity and lower selectivity for COx of 1% and 5% for C4–C5 alkanes.90 The Pd/Nb2O5 catalyst was studied for GVL to VA synthesis with reaction conditions of 275 °C, 14 bar and a WHSV of 0.3. The catalyst showed 99% GVL conversion and 88% selectivity for VA.125 Dumesic et al. reported GVL to VA synthesis by a carbon-supported Pd–NbCe catalyst. The reactions were conducted at 325 °C and 34 bar pressure. Thus, the selectivity for VA was 90% for all the catalysts. The differences are mainly due to their catalytic activity. The Pd–NbCe catalyst converts at 18%, the Pd–Nb and Pd–Nb–C catalysts at 60% and the Pd–NbCe–C catalyst at 90%. The Ce-free catalysts showed similarities irrespective of support by activated carbon but the active species on catalysts of Ce were of great importance. GVL was ring-opened by niobia acid sites whereas pentenoic acid hydrogenation produces VA on the surface of Pd metal.126 In the presence of acid sites on the catalyst, GVL is ring-opened to pentenoic acid, which can be further hydrogenated or decarboxylated to produce VA and its esters. Yun et al. also investigated hydrodeoxygenation of GVL to VA with different metal phosphide supported catalysts and a Pd/Al2O3 commercial catalyst at 0.5 MPa pressure. The comparison of catalyst activities was based on TOF from the chemisorption of CO at 50 °C. The order of catalytic activity is Ni2P/MCM-41 > CoP/MCM-41 > Pd/Al2O3 ≈ MoP/MCM-41 > WP/MCM-41. The Ni2P/MCM-41 catalyst achieved 18% GVL conversion and 73.3% VA selectivity under 250 °C reaction conditions.127 GVL was selectively converted to PV and pentane in a one-step synthesis over a bifunctional Pd/HY catalyst. The reaction was conducted at a temperature of 260 °C, 30 h and 80 bar H2. The catalyst showed 99% GVL conversion and the yield of PV was 60.6% and 22.9% of pentane was achieved in a single step. Furthermore, when the temperature and pressure were reduced to 240 °C and 40 bar H2, the catalysts yielded 73% VA.57 The catalytic performance of the Pt-loaded SiO2/HZSM-5 catalyst was tested for GVL to VA synthesis, where the catalyst showed 90% VA selectivity could be obtained. It was also shown that Pt supported on SiO2–Al2O3 exhibited relatively weak product selectivity, but the stability of Pt/SiO2–Al2O3 was higher than that of bifunctional catalysts using zeolites as acidic supports.48 The Cu/α-Al2O3 catalyst was applied for GVL to VA synthesis with reaction conditions of 200 °C, 5 MPa H2, 6 h, in EtOH. The catalysts exhibited 14% GVL conversion with a yield of 46% VA + VE.128 A Co/HZSM-5 catalyst was used for GVL to VA synthesis with reaction conditions of 240 °C, 3 MPa H2, 3 h, and EtOH solution, which showed 93% GVL conversion and 22% VA selectivity, whereas selectivity for EV was 69% EV.99 Zhu et al. conducted GVL to VA synthesis on a metal triflates + Pd/C catalyst with a reaction temperature of 135 °C and 1 atm H2 pressure for 12 h under solvent-free conditions. Metal triflates and oxophilic catalyst contained strong Lewis acid sites which promote the ring-opening of GVL. The reaction proceeds by H˙ free radicals being produced by Pd/C catalysts and showed 99% selectivity of VA and GVL conversion reached 99%.129 Catalysts with Cu supported on ZrO2 with ZnAl2O4 were investigated for GVL to valeric biofuels. The catalyst showed 26% of GVL conversion and 29% selectivity for VA + VE.130 Kumar et al. reported an investigation of La-doped Ni/TiO2 catalysts for GVL to VA synthesis where the catalysts demonstrated 3.4% GVL conversion and 99% VA selectivity.122

4. Electrocatalysis for LA to VA synthesis
Electrocatalysis is used for LA to VA synthesis. Electrocatalysis is the heterogeneous catalysis of electrochemical reactions that takes place in the electrode–electrolyte interface in which the electrode serves as both an electron donor and acceptor and as a catalyst.131–135 Electrocatalyst activity, affordability, durability, and stability are critical factors in practical applications. Moreover, a good catalyst support with a high surface area for catalytic dispersion and precise chemical stability in diverse (alkaline/acidic/neutral) electrolytes and good electronic conductivity is also required.131–135 Xin et al. investigated the electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of LA to VA by using a non-precious Pb electrode, which exhibited VA with 90% yield. With the tuning of the electrolyte pH and applied potential would be beneficial for the reduction processes. In this reaction, lower overpotentials are favorable for GVL synthesis and higher overpotentials would benefit an acidic electrolyte with pH = 0. Selectivity for VA of 95% under neutral electrolyte at pH 7.5, and GVL with 100% selectivity were obtained.136 ECH of LA to VA was conducted under ambient conditions. These can be utilized by replacement of the thermocatalytic hydrogenation at high pressure and high temperature. Here the usage of different metallic electrodes was investigated for LA studies in an H-type divided cell. The potential effect, reactant concentration, electrolyte concentration, and temperature effect on catalytic performance and faradaic efficiency (FE) were investigated. LA conversion of 93% and the selectivity for VA of 94% with an FE of 46% were obtained in a metallic lead electrode in 0.5 M of H2SO4 electrolyte containing 0.2 M LA with an applied voltage of −1.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) over 4 h. During the recycling, some degree of corrosion occurred in the metallic lead cathode with the strongly acidic nature of the environment. So, it is necessary to improve the leaching resistance of the cathode in the ECH of LA, when LA to VA synthesis is conducted in an H-type cell and water is the source of hydrogen. The effects of cathode, potential, electrolyte and reactant concentrations, and temperature on the catalytic performance and FE were studied. The LA to VA synthesis and the formation of reaction products on the cathode electrolyte were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using HPLC with a refractive index detector. H2SO4 solution was used as an eluent for product separation,. The reaction products were identified by comparison with standard calibration samples. Standard curves were drawn for the quantitative analysis.70 The ECH of VA was continuously used for the same time, and the surface of the metallic Pb cathode became rough which may have exposed more active sites for the ECH of LA to VA. However, some degree of poisoning occurred on the metallic Pb cathode in a strong acid environment. The reaction mechanism of this reaction generally proceeds through acidic electrolytes. First the adsorbed LA is activated by the H on the metallic Pb surface and cleavage of the CO group to produce the intermediate of 4-hydroxy VA. This intermediate was further cleaved at the C–OH group to produce VA, which then desorbed from the surface of metallic Pb.137 VA synthesis from LA and GVL occurs through two major pathways: TCH and electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH). The TCH system requires severe reaction conditions, such as high temperature and pressure where the price of the catalyst is also high. Compared to TCH, the ECH system has emerged as a promising tool in biomass valorization because of its green and sustainable characteristics138,139 such as least damage to the climate/environment and the flexibility to operate directly on aqueous feedstocks, encompassing reaction conditions to push simple transformations with high productivity and selectivity. The operability is close to ambient conditions, and likewise works at a more a modest scale and with intermittent processing with fading support on heat recovery. Oxidative or reducing equivalents are generated without the use of external reagents. Through changing electrical potentials, thermodynamic driving forces such as bringing down the activation energy barriers of half-cell reactions can be adjusted as needed, prompting further improvements in reaction rates was beneficial for the selective production distribution,138,139i.e., the ECH process is milder and product controllability is higher via tuning electrolytic cell parameters including pH and potentials. These parameters are allow us to avoid the utilization of chemicals to convey reductive or oxidative power and presents better and more secure processing conditions because of the decoupling of the chemical reaction into half-reactions, and a bountiful and maintainable water supply can be well utilized as a hydrogen and oxygen source rather than the costly necessity for the use of hydrogen gas and chemical oxidants in the TCH process. This exceptional possibility stems from the ability of ECH technologies to harness electricity generated through renewable sources for the motive of driving biomass transformations sustainably. ECH fulfills many of the principles of green chemistry, but direct applications of such processes in industry continue to be scarce.
5. Conclusion and outlook
A large number of catalytic systems were investigated in the synthesis involving LA to GVL and the conversion of GVL to VA. Direct one-step synthesis of VA from LA is a more economically feasible process and in a simple approach the purification and separation of the reaction intermediates from the unreacted feed and the formation of byproducts and use of catalysts can be avoided. From the above discussion, much more significant advances were obtained in LA conversion by using non-noble metal and noble metal catalysts. Compared to noble metal catalysts, non-noble metal-based catalysts show lower activity and stability and there are still many challenges to be addressed. In order to improve the research, many opportunities have been improved for existence. Herein, we would like to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities that LA conversion into VA presents over non-noble metal catalytic systems.
(i) Use of noble metal-based catalysts is significant and they exhibit excellent catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions. Ru-based catalysts are efficient for promoting the LA to GVL synthesis and Pt and Pd-based catalysts have been proven to be efficient catalysts in GVL to VA synthesis and also their conversion into their esters. Moreover, the bifunctional catalysts made from metals such as Cu, Ni, and Co are active metal catalysts that have been gradually developed over recent years.
(ii) The lower catalytic activity of non-noble metal catalysts is a great challenge for enhancing their activity by using bimetallic or multimetallic catalytic systems and utilizing different functional support materials.
(iii) Another challenge for non-noble metal catalysts is to improve catalyst stability. Tuning the active species of non-noble metal catalysts in some functional materials is an effective strategy for improving the activity.
(iv) The usage of non-noble metal catalysts should be decreased because novel catalytic techniques can be used, such as atom layer deposition (ALD) technology and single-atom technology to improve atom utilization.
(v) The novel catalytic routes for the LA to VA synthesis and also the present routes should be optimized to achieve higher activity under milder reaction conditions.
(vi) Ionic-liquids can be used for new reactions and some biomass-derived solvents can also be applied to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity.
(vii) More attention should be paid to novel conversion technologies, such as photocatalytic reactions, microwave irradiation and electrochemical methods.
(viii) Reaction pathways of LA conversions via using different catalysts with specific roles should be studied. We should concentrate on multifunctional catalysts for the direct utilization of cellulose and glucose as substrates for the synthesis of VA-based products.

Vapor-phase reactions are more efficient and environmentally benign because they require lower H2 pressure, and have continuous operation and easy product separation80	Compared to vapor-phase reactions, liquid-phase reactions require high pressure; it is difficult to separate the product; and they are not continuous processes
Compared to liquid-phase reactions, they could give lower yields and require high temperatures economically	To enhance the high yield and increase the selectivity, they require mild reaction conditions and this is beneficial for the design of new catalysts
In a vapor-phase reaction, the resistance time is very low and the diffusivity is in the order of 1 × 10−9	In the liquid-phase reaction, the resistance time is higher and the diffusivity is in the order of 1 × 10−5 at room temperature
The wall effects are much more important in vapor-phase reactions whereas diffusion is faster than in liquid-phase reactions	In liquid-phase reactions, leaching is a major problem and it leads to both a decrease in activity and pollution of the product stream81
