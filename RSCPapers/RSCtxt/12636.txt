    , Accepted 4th March 2022First published on 5th March 2022AbstractAnodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes with self-ordered nanochannels have become promising candidates for applications in the aspects such as structural coloration, photonic crystals, upconversion luminescence and nanofluidic transport. Also, self-ordered AAO membranes have been extensively used for the fabrication of functional nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanorods and nanopillars. Geometries of nanochannels are crucial for the applications of AAO membranes as well as controlling growth (e.g., nucleation, direction and morphology) and in applications (e.g., optics, magnetics, thermoelectrics, biology, medicine, sensing, and energy conversion and storage) of the functional nanostructures fabricated via AAO template-based methods. However, observation of whole nanochannels with nanometer-resolution in thick AAO membranes remains a fundamental challenge, and the nanochannel geometry has not yet been sufficiently elucidated. Here, for the first time, we use depth-profiling transmission electron microscopy to reveal the truncated conical geometry of whole nanochannels of 70 μm in length. Such shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels leads to different reflectance properties of the different depths of the nanochannels along their long axis for one AAO membrane, which suggests that the nonuniformity result in some effects on applications of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we introduce a shape factor to evaluate the shape nonuniformity and demonstrate that the nonuniformity can be remarkably removed by an effective etching method based on a temperature gradient regime.
1. Introduction
Self-ordered anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes grown under a self-ordering growth regime have become promising candidates for versatile applications in structural coloration,1 photonic crystals,2 upconversion luminescence,3 nanofluidic transport,4 separators in Li–S batteries,5 membrane separation,6 virus detection and ultrafiltration,7,8 biosensors,9,10 and drug release,11 and AAO membranes are becoming a key component in the construction of functional nanostructures (e.g., nanowires,12–23 nanotubes,24–27 nanoparticles,28–31 nanorods,32–35 nanopillars,36,37 heterostructures38,39 and mesostructures40,41) that are driving advances in fields as diverse as optics,1–3,27,42 magnetics,13,14 thermoelectrics,15 biology,17 medicine,27 sensing,32,35 and energy conversion and storage18,19,25,29,37 due to their controllable nanochannel dimensions. The nanochannel geometry is essential to the functional applications of AAO membranes, which has been demonstrated in the following three aspects.
First, the properties and applications of AAO membranes strongly depend on the nanochannel geometry. For instance, it is found that the enhancement factor of upconversion luminescence depends strongly on the pore diameter of AAO,3 and it increases gradually and more rapidly with the increase of pore diameter in the range of 60–90 nm; the third-order optical nonlinearity of AAO membranes is considerably influenced by the nanochannel (or pore) geometry, increasing pore size has brought improvements in the optical nonlinearity and the nonlinear response doubles when the pore size increases from 25 nm to 62 nm.43 Moreover, the thermal conductivity of AAO membranes relies on the pore diameter and the porosity based on the measurements by a photoacoustic technique.44 The acid–base properties of AAO membranes by the EPR of pH-sensitive spin probes is affected by the pore diameter of AAO, the EPR titration curve for a 58 nm pore diameter is essentially the same as for the corresponding bulk solution with a pKa,int value of 6.11 ± 0.05, decreasing the pore diameter leads to a larger regular shift of the EPR titration curves, and the pKa,int value increases to 6.38 ± 0.05 for a pore diameter of 29 nm.45 Also, a unique barcode toward optical biosensors is related to the nanochannel geometry by means of an oscillation in the photoluminescence spectrum,9 and the width and position of each bar associated with the PL oscillations can be adjusted by the nanochannel diameter; label-free detection of telomerase activity in urine based on steric hindrance changes induced by confinement geometry in the nanochannels of AAO, indicating that the pore diameter of AAO had a considerable effect on the current drop ratio,10 and it is found that the current drop ratio for 25 nm diameter is 13% while it increases to 30% for 55 nm diameter, large current drop corresponding to the high detection sensitivity of telomerase in urine.10 In addition, control of the nanochannel geometry allows for accurate estimation of the mass transport resistance in nanofluidic molecules.4 It is observed that the ionic current rectification ratio based on a 70 μm thick AAO membrane is mainly determined by the nanochannel size, and the membranes with small nanochannel sizes exhibit better rectification behavior than those with large sizes.46
Second, the nanochannel geometry significantly influences on the controlling growth of the nanostructures embedded into AAO membranes. For example, confinement effects of AAO templates have a strong influence not only on the physical processes of polymers (crystallization and dynamics) but also on the chemical process (polymerization kinetics, molecular weight, etc.), the effect on the synthesis of PMMA becoming more pronounced as the pore size decreases from 60 nm to 35 nm for the same pore distance of 105 nm with a pore length of 100 μm.20 Furthermore, the crystallization of isotactic poly(propylene) shows a transformation from a predominantly heterogeneous to predominantly homogeneous nucleation at a pore diameter of about 65 nm;33 The β-PBA crystals formed in an AAO template with a pore diameter of 30 nm melt directly while the β-crystals transform to α-crystals in the template with the pore diameter larger than 70 nm;26 the Tc of AgI in AAO can be finely tuned by precisely controlling the pore size of AAO at the nanoscale level, and the Tc↑ regions of interfacial AgI gradually decrease with increasing the pore size, and disappear when the pore size reaches 50–60 nm.38 Also, our previous investigation on the growth mechanism of single crystal silicon nanowires demonstrates the growth direction of the nanowires for different pore diameters is quite different based on the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism.12 Additionally, a systematic study of the assembly of silver inverted mesostructures illustrates, when the nanochannel diameter gradually varies from 64, 51, 45 to 40 nm, the morphology presents evolutions from the S-helix, core–shell triple-helix, D-helix and to S-helix with a straight core channel.40 For confining precipitation of drugs within the nanochannels, the size of VM-26 PNDs can be tuned by the pore size,28 and the PND size increases with the increase of both the pore size and the concentrations of drug solutions.
Third, the nanochannel geometry has remarkable effects on the properties of assembled nanostructures based on the AAO template-based approach. For instance, it is demonstrated that the fluorescence efficiency of the molecules within pores monotonically increases with decreasing the pore diameter from 50 nm to 20 nm and has a strong superlinear dependence on the inverse of the pore diameter.16 Moreover, measurements of the magnetic behavior of Ni nanowire arrays show the remanence increases from 30 to 100% and the coercive field shifts towards 1200 Oe with reducing the pore diameter from 55 to 30 nm,13 and the average derived demagnetization field is about −1750 Oe for 55 nm pores, −920 Oe for 40 nm pores, and −520 Oe for 30 nm pores. As the diameter is deceased to 48 nm or lower, the Bi nanowire arrays embedded in AAO become semiconductors, exhibiting a semimetal to semiconductor transition.15 When comparing the effects of the pore diameter on the fibronectin molecular strain, decreasing the pore diameter progressively decreases the mean Förster resonance energy transfer index, suggesting that fibronectin gets more stretched.17 Furthermore, for metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structures as capacitor arrays, two treatments of AAO membranes can dramatically reduce leakage currents, the first treatment is a pore widening step to increase the pore diameters to 80 nm, and the second treatment is to add an barrier to reduce the pore diameter to 50 nm before the MIM is deposited;25 consider the electrochemical performance of a full-cell device of an all-in-one nanopore battery array, it is predicted high volumetric energy and power density with optimized nanochannel geometry,19 and extending the design to larger pore dimensions may considerably improve the power and energy; the photocurrent can be increased to more than 70% in the entire potential scanning region when the diameter of CdTe/TiO2 is increased from 30 to 90 nm, and extensive data show that the enlargement in the diameters of the nanostructure arrays can not only improve the absorption efficiency of the structure but also can reduce the resistance of the system.18 It is found that the power-conversion efficiency of nanopillar perovskite solar cells shows a significant decrease from 9.32% to 7.52% and then to 6.67% as the pore size of AAO decreases from 66.6 nm to 53.2 nm and then to 41.0 nm.37
It is significant to investigate the nanochannel geometry because it plays key roles in the functional applications of AAO membranes as described above. The nanochannels are generally considered as cylinders with uniform diameters based on conventional electron microscopy observations in small localized regions.33,47–50 Particularly, the assumption is only appropriate for thin AAO membranes.33,50 In contrast, for thick AAO membranes with tens of micrometers, the case becomes remarkably different, the reason for the different results is previous observations on the nanochannels in thick AAO membranes are concentrated on the local cross-sectional regions of the nanochannels rather than the whole areas. Although great efforts have been made in the formation mechanism47,51–57 and the fabrication techniques58–65 of the nanochannels in AAO membranes, the nanochannel geometry has not been investigated and sufficiently elucidated, so far it is a fundamental challenge to precisely observe the geometry of the whole high aspect-ratio nanochannels in thick AAO membranes.
In addition, it is known that self-ordered AAO membranes have been fabricated using hard anodization (HA) and mild anodization (MA) techniques, corresponding to the interpore distances of 220–300 nm at 110–150 V and those of about 103 nm at 40 V, respectively, for an oxalic acid-based anodization process.66 The HA process produces AAO membranes at 25–35 times faster growth rates in comparison to the MA process.66 Nevertheless, the porosity (∼10%) of AAO membranes fabricated by the MA technique67 is much larger than the porosity (3.3–3.4%) of those fabricated by the HA technique.59 In this work, considering the general MA process, we investigate the geometry of the whole nanochannels in thick AAO membranes. The electron-transparent areas of the whole cross-sectional membrane with 70 μm thickness can be successfully observed by depth-profiling transmission electron microscopy (DPTEM), which have revealed that the nanochannels grown under the self-ordering conditions are truncated cones rather than commonly accepted cylinders. As compared to the shape uniformity of the cylindrical nanochannels, such shape nonuniformity of the truncated conical nanochannels leads to different reflectance properties of the different depths of the nanochannels along their long axis for the same AAO membrane, this may result in some effects on their functional applications. Here, we define a dimensionless parameter – shape factor – to evaluate the nonuniformity of the nanochannel geometry. Furthermore, we can sharply decrease the shape factor of the truncated conical by using an effective etching technique based on a temperature gradient regime; for the as-prepared AAO membranes with different thicknesses of 27, 60, 70 and 93 μm, the shape factors exhibit remarkable decreases from 0.18, 0.28, 0.32 and 0.47 (as-prepared nanochannels) to 0.003, 0.04, 0.01 and 0.08 (after etching), respectively, therefore, the nonuniformity of the nanochannel geometry has been removed significantly.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of AAO membranes through a two-step anodization method in the steady-state growth process
First, high-purity aluminium sheets (99.999%, 0.3 mm thick) were degreased in acetone, and then an annealing treatment under vacuum (10−4 Pa) was carried out at 500 °C for 5 h to remove the mechanical stress and make the grains grow up. The aluminium sheets were electropolished at 23 V in a 1:9 mixture solution of perchloric acid and ethanol at 2 °C. Second, the aluminium sheets divided into four groups were anodized at a constant voltage of 40 V in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 0 °C for 24 h, 11 °C for 10 h, 13 °C for 10 h, and 17 °C for 10 h, respectively. After that, the anodic oxide layers formed on the sheets were removed in a mixture solution of 6% H3PO4 and 1.8% H2CrO4 at 60 °C. Subsequently, these sheets were correspondingly anodized again at a constant voltage of 40 V in the 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 0 °C for 660 min, 11 °C for 720 min, 13 °C for 640 min, 17 °C for 660 min, respectively. Note that the temperatures of the electrolyte solution during the second anodization are the same as those during the first anodization. In particular, for one anodization process, the anodization parameters such as anodization voltage, temperature and electrolyte solution in the whole anodization process are unchanged to keep the nanochannels stable, wherein, the anodization voltage was controlled by a high precision power supply and the temperature is the same through the whole anodization process by using a thermostatic bath with water circulation refrigeration. Then, the aluminium substrates were removed in a SnCl4 solution. Third, the through-channel AAO membranes were achieved by the entire channel-opening of the nanochannels in a 5% H3PO4 solution at 30 °C for about 40 min. Finally, the through-channel AAO membranes prepared through the second anodization at 13 °C for 640 min were chemically etched in a 5% H3PO4 solution at 30 °C for 0, 10, 35, and 60 min, respectively.
2.2 Preparation of the TEM specimen of the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels
For TEM observations of the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels in the thick AAO membranes, the fragile AAO membranes with 70 μm thickness were directly prepared by the ion milling technique in a precision ion polishing system (PIPS) (Gatan, Model 691), where the sliced membranes were supported by Gilder aperture molybdenum grids (Type: GA1000 M, 1.0 mm hole, 3.05 mm O.D.), and the ion milling was carried out in double sector milling mode while fixing the two guns towards the bottom or the top surfaces of the membranes to correspondingly obtain the TEM samples of the top or the bottom surfaces. To achieve large electron-transparent areas for the TEM observations without radiation damage and amorphous samples, control of the milling parameters including beam energy, milling angle, and temperature is important. For example, the TEM sample of the top surface of the as-prepared 70 μm thick AAO membrane without etching was prepared at a beam energy of 4.6 keV for 315 min and sequentially 4.0 keV for 340 min with a milling angle of 7°, followed by 3.5 keV for 60 min with a milling angle of 4°, and finally 3.5 keV for 60 min with a milling angle of 3°. While, the TEM sample of the top surface of the AAO membrane after etching for 60 min was prepared at 4.5 keV for 220 min with a milling angle of 7°, 4.0 keV for 15 min with a milling angle of 4°, and finally 3.5 keV for 10 min with a milling angle of 3°. The milling parameters of the top surfaces of the AAO membranes through etching for 10 and 35 min were selected between those of the membranes after etching for 0 and 60 min. Also, the milling parameters of the bottom surfaces of the AAO membranes through etching for 0, 10, 35 and 60 min, respectively, were close to those of the top surfaces of the membranes. Finally, these TEM samples were cleaned in a Gatan advanced plasma system (Solanus™, Model 950) for 40 min with an Ar/O2 gas mixture for the removal of the contamination.
2.3 Preparation of the depth-profiling TEM specimen of the whole nanochannels
For depth-profiling TEM (DPTEM) observations of the whole nanochannels in the as-prepared 70 μm thick AAO membrane without etching, a cross-sectional TEM sample was fabricated by the following steps: first, several slices with 2 mm width and 4 mm length were cut out of the AAO membranes, then the slices were glued together with G2 epoxy consisted of a mixed hardener and resin in a ratio of 1:10 and sandwiched between two silicon substrates to produce a stack of layers. Second, the glued and stacked section was cut into a 2.7 mm cylinder using a TPC-Tool ultrasonic cutter (Gatan, Model 601), and then the cylinder was further placed into a 3 mm thin copper tube filled with the epoxy. Third, the tube was sliced into disks with a thickness of 300 μm by a low speed diamond saw (MTI Corporation, SYJ-150). Fourth, the disks were thinned down to 60 μm by a disc grinder (Gatan, Model 623). Fifth, the thin disks were fixed on a Gilder aperture molybdenum grid, and then the sample was thinned by the ion milling technique in a double sector milling mode while fixing the two guns towards the top and bottom surfaces of the membrane, respectively, the ion milling were carried out at a beam energy of 4.5 keV for 230 min with a milling angle of 7° and sequential 3 keV for 60 min with a milling angle of 4°. Finally, the cross-sectional TEM sample was cleaned in a Gatan advanced plasma system for 40 min with an Ar/O2 gas mixture.
2.4 Characterization
The nanochannels on the top and bottom surfaces and the depth profiles of the nanochannels in the thick AAO membranes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010). The sizes of the nanochannels both on the surfaces and at the different depths of the AAO membranes were measured by using the Gatan DigitalMicrograph (DM) software. The membrane thicknesses were measured using an optical microscope (Leica, DM2500 M, 50× objective (N.A. = 0.75), MS 20 encoded stage).
2.5 Optical measurements
The optical reflection spectra of the cross sections of AAO membranes were measured using a confocal microscope with an imaging spectrometer (iHR550) (Fig. S1, ESI†). A white-light beam from a fiber-coupled halogen lamp was focused down to a 5 μm diameter spot on the cross section of an AAO membrane at normal incidence by an microscope objective (Olympus, 100×), and then the reflected light from the top, middle and bottom regions of the nanochannels was collected with the same objective onto the imaging spectrometer by moving the spot of the incident beam along the nanochannel axis to obtain the reflection spectra.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 TEM observations of the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels
For TEM observations of the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels in the 70 μm thick AAO membranes, the fragile AAO membranes were directly prepared by the ion milling technique in a PIPS (see the Experimental section). Fig. 1 shows the TEM images of the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels in the 70 μm thick AAO membranes prepared at a voltage of 40 V in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 13 °C, it is found that the nanochannel walls are sandwich-like structures, consisting of dark hexagonal inner layers and bright outer layers (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  High magnification TEM images of the top (a) and bottom (b) surfaces of the nanochannels in the same as-prepared AAO membranes, respectively, the sandwich-like structures represent the walls of the nanochannels, including bright outer layers/dark hexagonal inner layers/bright outer layers. 
The chemical mapping based on energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) of the TEM specimen supported with a molybdenum grid shows that the as prepared AAO membrane covers the elements of Al, O and C (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the chemical composition in the AAO membrane. Since the elements of Al and O are distributed in the whole area of the nanochannel walls, aluminium oxide is localized in both the inner and the outer layers of the nanochannel walls, and the carbon intensity increases around the edge of the nanochannels (pores), indicating that there are more incorporated oxalic species in the edge region of the nanochannels.

Moreover, the sizes of the nanochannels on the top surfaces are prominently larger than those on the bottom surfaces for each AAO membrane (52.7 ± 1.5 nm in Fig. 1a and 40.2 ± 1.3 nm in Fig. 1b, 52.9 ± 3.0 nm in Fig. 3a and 37.1 ± 2.0 nm in Fig. 3e for the as-prepared AAO membranes, 64.6 ± 3.6 nm in Fig. 3b and 54.8 ± 2.4 nm in Fig. 3f for the 10 min etched AAO membranes, 75.0 ± 2.2 nm in Fig. 3c and 62.9 ± 3.0 nm in Fig. 3g for the 35 min etched AAO membranes, and 82.6 ± 3.0 nm in Fig. 3d and 72.6 ± 3.7 nm in Fig. 3h for the 60 min etched AAO membranes).

(a), (b), (c) and (d) top surfaces of the nanochannels in the AAO membranes formed after etching the through-channel membranes immersed in a 5% H3PO4 solution at 30 °C for 0, 10, 35, and 60 min, respectively. (e), (f), (g) and (h) bottom surfaces of the nanochannels in the same membranes formed after etching the through-channel membranes for 0, 10, 35, and 60 min, respectively. 
For example, statistic measurements of the nanochannel sizes of the as-prepared AAO membrane (without chemical etching), based on the DigitalMicrograph (DM) software, demonstrate that the mean top diameter of the nanochannels is 52.9 ± 3.0 nm, which is much larger than the mean bottom diameter of 37.1 ± 2.0 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, the average diameters of the nanochannels on both the top and bottom sections increase when increasing the etching duration from 10 min to 35 min then to 60 min in the same 5% H3PO4 solution at 30 °C: it has been noted that both the bottom and the top nanochannels are opening up completely, nevertheless, the diameters on the top sections are distinctly larger than those on the bottom sections for the same membranes (Fig. 3, Fig. S2 in the ESI†). These TEM observations demonstrate that the nanochannels in the thick AAO membranes are not cylindrical.
Furthermore, the crystalline evolution of the AAO membranes is investigated. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the AAO membranes present diffuse rings, indicating that the AAO membranes are amorphous (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3†), which is confirmed by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 4e and 4j). It is found that the diffuse rings become indistinct slightly with increasing the nanochannel sizes for the top surfaces (Fig. 4a–d) and the bottom surfaces (Fig. 4f–i), especially the diffuse rings are very weak for the maximum nanochannel sizes (Fig. 4d and i), which indicates that the amorphous degree is strengthened for the AAO membranes with the maximum nanochannel sizes (corresponding to the regions of the inner layers in the nanochannel walls).

3.2 Depth-profiling TEM observations of the cross section of the whole nanochannels in the thick AAO membrane
We further observed the geometry of the whole nanochannels in the as-prepared thick AAO membrane without chemical etching by the depth-profiling TEM (DPTEM) technique. Fig. 5a shows a low magnification cross-sectional TEM image of the whole 70 μm thick membrane, the marginal part of the image is the electron-transparent area across the whole nanochannels, where the thickness of the sample is less than 100 nm. Four different positions (e.g., 1, 2, 3 and 4 marked in Fig. 5a and b along the depth profiles of the whole nanochannels were selected for high-magnification observations (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5c shows a part of the nanochannels, this is because that, during the preparation of the depth-profiling TEM specimen of the whole nanochannels using the ion milling technique, the formed very thin regions of the AAO membrane for TEM observation are not along the length of one nanochannel but along the enveloping curves of the cross section of the nannochannels (Fig. 5a). Additionally, the nanochannel sizes are different over the entire nanochannel length. It is found that the mean size of the nanochannels decreases from 52.8 ± 4.8 nm, 48.4 ± 2.5 nm, and 45.1 ± 2.3 nm to 40.5 ± 2.9 nm (Fig. 5d), corresponding to positions 1, 2, 3 and 4 along the channel axis from up to down by the line-profile measurements based on the DM software (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, statistic measurements of around 300 nanochannel spacings for every AAO membrane by the DM software illustrate the average spacings between the adjacent nanochannels on both the top and bottom surfaces for the same membrane are almost invariable (Fig. S4, ESI†), which implies that the nanochannels are parallel to each other. Therefore, these observations indicate that the nanochannels have a truncated conical geometry (Fig. 5b).

3.3 Reflection spectra of the different depth regions of the nanochannels in the AAO membranes
The optical reflection spectra of the cross sections of the AAO membranes were measured using a confocal microscope with an imaging spectrometer (see the Experimental section and Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The optical measurement results for the reflection spectra of the three different depth micro-regions on the cross sections along the long axis of the nanochannels in the same AAO membrane indicate that the reflection spectra are different for the three depths of the same AAO membrane, and the reflectance enhances with increasing the depths from the top and middle to bottom regions of the nanochannels (Fig. 6a), which can also be confirmed by the normalized reflection spectra (Fig. 6b). This is because that the bottom section has thick nanochannel walls corresponding to smaller nanochannel sizes, whereas the top section has thin nanochannel walls related to larger nanochannel sizes. Therefore, the different regions of the nanochannels exhibit different reflectances owing to the nonuniformity geometry of the truncated conical nanochannels. It can also be observed that the reflectance of the bottom surface of the AAO membrane is stronger than that of the top surface by measuring the reflection spectra from the two surfaces of the same AAO membrane (Fig. S5, ESI†).

(a) The black, red and blue curves denote of the reflectance from the bottom, middle and top regions of the cross section of the nanochannels, respectively. (b) The corresponding normalized reflection spectra. 
Moreover, it is suggested that the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels may have some effects on the functional applications of the AAO membranes. For example, X. Zhang et al. have demonstrated the non-uniformity in the pore sizes, shapes and lattice regularity makes the fabrication of materials with good optical quality a great challenge. In order to further improve the optical performance, it is critical to create pore arrays with high uniformity.68 For the optical response of the metamaterial influenced by the filling ratio of the metal nanowire in the AAO dielectric matrix, the non-uniform size of the pores causes the fluctuation of effective permittivity throughout the material, resulting in material properties deviated from the design.68 On the other hand, different pore diameters lead to different ion transportation rates during the electro-deposition process, which may result in a very short nanowire or even no nanowires in some pores. The pores without nanowires are optical defects in the material, which induce unexpected scattering and create artefacts in the characterization process.68 Therefore, the removal of the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels in the AAO membranes is of significance to improve their functional applications.
3.4 Defining a shape factor to evaluate the nonuniformity of the nanochannel geometry
To evaluate the shape nonuniformity of the geometry of the truncated conical nanochannels, we define a dimensionless parameter − shape factor – η to determine the shape nonuniformity η = (DT,t − DB)/DT,t(1)where DT,t and DB represent the size of the nanochannels on the top and bottom sections, respectively, the subscript t means the second anodization time during the two-step anodization process. As η varies from 0 to 1, it indicates the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels. It has been noted that there are two specific geometries, η = 0 represents a perfect uniformity of the nanochannels with a cylinder shape, while, η = 1 exhibits an absolute nonuniformity of the nanochannels with a cone shape. It is observed that the nanochannel sizes on the top sections are much large than those on the bottom sections for very thick AAO membranes, the shape factors of the nanochannels become rather large, that is, the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels becomes more obvious in the thick AAO membranes. Consider the nanochannels of the 70 μm thick AAO membrane without chemical etching (i.e. the etching duration of 0 min) (Fig. 3a and e), the shape factor η is 0.30, which is calculated from the average sizes of the nanochannels on the top and bottom surfaces of the same as-prepared AAO membrane (Fig. S2-a1 and S2-a2, ESI†). For the AAO membranes formed through etching the as-prepared AAO membrane for 10 min (Fig. 3b and f), 35 min (Fig. 3c and g), and 60 min (Fig. 3d and h), respectively, the shape factors of the nanochannels correspond to 0.15, 0.16 and 0.12. It can be seen that the shape factors of the nanochannels after the etching treatments decrease in comparison with that of the nanochannels in the as-prepared AAO membrane, which indicates that the shape uniformity of the nanochannels can be improved by the conventional etching treatment (i.e., immersing the as-prepared through-channel AAO membrane in 5% H3PO4 solution at 30 °C). However, the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels has not been mainly removed by the normal etching treatment.
3.5 Formation mechanism of the truncated conical nanochannels in the thick AAO membrane
The formation mechanism of the nanochannels (or nanopores) in the AAO membranes under the steady-state growth conditions has been thoroughly investigated in pioneering work, including field-assisted dissolution51 and its extended mechanism,52,53 volume expansion,54 equifield strength,55 viscous flow of oxide,56 morphological instability47 and stress induced by electrolyte anion57 models. However, previous models mainly focus on nanochannel formation and the self-ordered arrangement of nanochannel arrays. Here, we present the formation origin of the truncated conical geometry of the nanochannels in the self-ordered AAO membranes. Consider a typical anodization process based upon the self-ordering regime (e.g., at a constant anodization voltage of 40 V in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 13 °C), the current density almost remains constant (Fig. S6, ESI†), the size deviation between the top and bottom nanochannels becomes more obvious as the anodization time or the nanochannel length increases (Fig. 7a), this is because the walls of the nanochannels are simultaneously dissolved along the short axis in the acid solution when the nanochannels grow along the long axis.
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic illustration of the growth process of a truncated-conical nanochannel with the anodization time during the second anodization, the size of the top nanochannels is larger than that of the bottom nanochannels. (b) Lateral dissolution process of the nanochannel walls along the short axis of the channel during the steady-state growth, the curve represents the dissolution time with the position of the nanochannel along the long axis from up to down. (c) Size increase rates of the top nanochannels relative to the bottom nanochannels at different electrolyte temperatures. 
Moreover, the lateral dissolution time for the nanochannel walls gradually reduces from top to bottom (Fig. 7b), and the dissolution rate of the nanochannel walls is invariable from up to down owing to the constant temperature of the acid solution, and as a result, the nanochannels formed during the anodization process have a truncated conical geometry. If considering the same thick AAO membranes fabricated by the HA and MA techniques, the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels for the HA process may be not obvious, the truncated conical geometry of the nanochannels becomes weak for the HA process when compared with that for the MA process, this is because that the extent of the lateral dissolution of the nanochannel walls for the HA process with the short-time anodization is much weaker than that for the MA process with the long-time anodization. This formation process of the truncated conical nanochannels in the AAO membranes seems to be similar to that of the conical nanopores in polymer membranes synthesized using the track-etch process,69 where etching along the damage track begins at the membrane surface in contact with the etch solution, but when this etchant breaks through to the other surface it is neutralized by the stop-etch solution. As a result, a conical-shaped pore is obtained with the large-diameter opening (“base” opening) in contact with the etch solution and the small-diameter opening (“tip” opening) in contact with the stop-etch solution. In terms of eqn (1), the shape factor of the truncated conical nanochannels can be written as η = 1 − DB/(DB + νt)(2)where DT,t = DB + t, ν denotes the enlarging rate of the top nanochannels, which is proportional to the dissolution rate of the nanochannel walls along the short axis, and t is the anodization time. The experimental results illustrate that the enlarging rate (i.e. size increase rate) of the top nanochannels rapidly increases from 0.61 to 2.63 nm h−1 with increasing the electrolyte temperature (i.e., anodization temperature) from 0 to 17 °C (Fig. 7c), consequently, the shape factors of the nanochannels fabricated at higher anodization temperatures are larger than those of the nanochannels formed at lower anodization temperatures. In this case, using the lower anodization temperatures can suppress the nonuniformity of the nanochannels; however, it is only applicable for the thin AAO membranes because the growth rate of the nanochannels (i.e. membrane thickness) along their long axis is dependent on the current density: dh/dt = h0i and it reduces with decreasing the anodization temperature, which can be understood by the viscous flow model,56 where h and t are the membrane thickness and growth time, h0 is a constant, and i is the current density. For the film–solution interfacial reactions and the metal/oxygen ion transport during the self-ordering (i.e., steady-state) growth process, Newtonian viscous flow should be incorporated into the equation of current density: i = −2FJO + 3FJM, where JO and JM represent the fluxes of oxygen and metal ions, respectively, F is the Faraday constant. Jj = −(DjCj/RT)∇μj, j = O and M, where μj is chemical potential, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Cj is the ion concentration, and uj0 and jump distance a are empirical parameters. In terms of our fitting data for the films formed at a constant voltage (i.e., 40 V), the relationship between the current density and the anodization temperature can be simply expressed as: i = −iOexp(−α/T) + iMexp(−β/T)(3)where iO, iM, α and β are constants at a given anodization voltage. According to the current density dependence on the anodization temperature, the experimental data can be fitted by the equation (Fig. S7, ESI†). On the other hand, to achieve the thick AAO membranes, higher anodization temperatures and/or longer anodization time are indispensable conditions during the anodization process, so the shape factors of the truncated conical nanochannels in the thick AAO membranes are still high according to eqn (2), which indicates that the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels is inevitable during the anodization process.
3.6 Significant reduction in the shape nonuniformity of the truncated conical nanochannels
Consider the conventional chemical etching by immersing through-channel AAO membranes into acid solutions, the shape nonuniformity cannot be suppressed effectively. Here, we present an etching method based on a temperature gradient regime to significantly remove the shape nonuniformity of the truncated conical nanochannels. The as-prepared through-channel AAO membranes through a drying treatment were floated on the surface of a 5% H3PO4 solution (Fig. S8, ESI†), where the H3PO4 solution was placed in a Petri dish that was partially immersed into a digital-control water bath with a temperature of 30 °C by control of a heating element, the temperature of the bottom surface of the AAO membranes equals to that of the H3PO4 solution, which can be measured by a thermocouple fixed into the water bath. The digital-control water bath was placed into a horizontal refrigerator with a surrounding temperature of 8 °C, the surrounding temperature can be controlled by the refrigerator, and the temperature of the top surfaces of the AAO membrane exposed to the surrounding were measured by a mercury thermometer. The bottom surfaces of the membranes are in contact with the surface of the solution with a high temperature of 30 °C while the top surfaces are exposed to the surrounding with a low temperature of 8 °C, this gives rise to a temperature gradient of the solution in the nanochannels from down to up based on a capillary phenomenon. In the case, the enlarging rate of the nanochannels on the bottom segment is larger than that on the top segment during the etching process, which results in the decrease of the original size deviation along the long axis of the nanochannels (Fig. 8a). For the as-prepared through-channel AAO membranes with different thicknesses (e.g., 27, 60, 70 and 93 μm), the shape factors of the nanochannels achieved from Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI† are 0.18, 0.28, 0.32 and 0.47, respectively, which has clearly shown that the uniformity of nanochannel size becomes worse as the membrane thickness (i.e., nanochannel length) increases (Fig. 8b). However, after etching for 2 min based on the temperature gradient regime, the shape factor of the nanochannels in the 27 μm thick membrane decreases from the initial 0.18 to 0.003; while, the shape factor for the 60 μm thick membrane reduces from 0.28 to 0.04 through etching for 5 min, and the factor for the 70 μm thick membrane decreases from 0.32 to 0.01 through etching for 10 min, For the very thick membrane of 93 μm, the factor reduces from the initial 0.47 to 0.08 through etching for 40 min (Fig. 8b). It is clear that the shape nonuniformity of the truncated conical nanochannels has been mainly removed by the etching method based on the temperature gradient principle (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). Furthermore, the results indicate that the etching time for thin membranes is less than that for thick membranes to obtain the shape uniformity of the nanochannels (Fig. 8c). It has been noted that for the very thick membrane of 93 μm, the etching time becomes very long, because the size difference (e.g., 28.9 nm) between the top and bottom surfaces of the nanochannels in the very thick membrane is much larger than that in the thin membrane (e.g., 6.7 nm) (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). It has been noted that he nanochannels may enlarge along the channel axis from up to down by increasing the voltage; however, the nanochannel shape becomes very irregular and the self-ordered arrangement between the nanochannels has been damaged substantially owing to the non-self-ordering growth regime, especially the nanochannel structures between the bottom and top sections are extremely different, and as a result, the cylindrical nanochannels cannot be obtained by changing the anodization voltage (ESI section 11 and Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). In contrast, our self-ordering growth and subsequent etching based on the temperature gradient regime method allows to obtain the self-ordered arrangement of AAO membranes with regular shape and constant spacing of nanochannels (ESI section 11 and Fig. S11, S12 and S15, ESI†), thus we can achieve cylindrical nanochannels by our etching method based on the temperature gradient regime.

(c) Size changes of the top and bottom nanochannels after the etching treatments compared with those of the as-prepared AAO membranes. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have revealed the geometry of the whole nanochannels in the thick AAO membranes by TEM observations, and it is found that the size of the nanochannels on the top sections is much larger than that on the bottom sections for each AAO membrane; moreover, the observation of the electron-transparently cross-section of the whole membrane demonstrates that the nanochannels formed under the steady-state growth are truncated cones rather than generally accepted cylinders. The formation origin of the truncated conical geometry is that the walls of the nanochannels are simultaneously dissolved along the short axis in the acid solution when the nanochannels grow along the long axis, and it is indicated that the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels is inevitable during the anodization process. Similarly, the truncated conical geometry has also been observed in titania nanotubes fabricated by anodic anodization of titanium foil under some anodization conditions such as tuning electrolyte solution.70,71 Moreover, it is found that the reflection spectra are different for the different depths of the AAO membrane, and the reflectance increases with increasing the depths from the top, middle to bottom regions of the nanochannels, which illustrates that the shape nonuniformity of the truncated conical nanochannels have some effects on the characteristics of the AAO membrane itself. Therefore, control of the shape uniformity of the nanochannels is indispensable for the development of the functional nanostructures. We introduce a non-dimensional parameter − shape factor – to evaluate the shape nonuniformity of the nanochannels, the shape factors of the as-prepared truncated-conical nanochannels in the 27 μm, 60 μm, 70 μm and 93 μm thick AAO membranes are 0.18, 0.28, 0.32 and 0.47, respectively, nevertheless, the shape factors can be correspondingly decreased to 0.003, 0.04, 0.01 and 0.08 by the etching method based on the temperature gradient regime, and as a result, the nonuniformity of the nanochannels has been significantly removed. These investigations provide significant evidence for understanding the nanochannels in the AAO membranes especially their functional applications.
