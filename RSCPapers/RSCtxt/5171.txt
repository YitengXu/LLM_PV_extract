    , Accepted 28th December 2020First published on 27th January 2021AbstractThe depletion of the traditional fuels and unavoidable seasonal intermittence in solar/wind energy has made an urgent call to develop suitable energy conversion and storage systems. Since both the efficiency and cost of these systems are greatly impacted by electroactive materials, designing an efficient material through a scalable methodology is indispensable. Keeping these things in mind, we demonstrated the synthesis of Co3O4 nanoflakes via the anionic (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide; CTAB) and cationic (sodium lauryl sulphate; SLS) surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method at different annealing temperatures (350 °C and 500 °C). The uniform surface morphology and crystallinity of the as-synthesized nanoflakes were analysed via field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. Further, the electrochemical charge storage performances of these nanoflakes were explored in a three-electrode electrochemical measurement. The CTAB-assisted Co3O4 showed an impressive charge storage performance in terms of higher specific capacitance (777.45 F g−1), energy (32.66 W h kg−1) and power (39.8 kW kg−1) densities (ED and PD) compared to that derived through SLS. Further, the CTAB-500 °C showed better cyclic durability with 83% retention of the initial capacitance after 5000 repeated cycles. Therefore, we presume that the present synthetic strategy will be a scalable and efficient method for the synthesis of Co3O4 that can be used as a future energy storage material for sustainability.
1. Introduction
In current era the synthesis of nanoparticles has received considerable attention because of their unique high surface to volume ratios, significant electronic and optoelectronic properties, tiny sizes and shapes. Nanoparticles find numerous eco-friendly applications such as green catalysts, green adsorbents, pharmaceutical industries for targeted drug delivery and biomedical imaging as well as in electronics such as sensors and chips.1,2 In the synthesis of nanoparticles, the particle sizes and distributions are predominantly controlled by the use of surfactants in a wide range of temperatures. The main advantage of using surfactants over other methods is to have good control over the size of nanoparticles.3 Surfactants are structure-directing reagents, and with their own functional groups as well as by virtue of their nature, they tend to reduce the surface tension of the liquor, thereby preventing the agglomeration of the particles. They channelize the building units of the crystal slowly, thus controlling the morphology. They can be classified as cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic depending on the surface charge of the hydrophilic group. Surfactants have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends.4 Depending on the charge, there are three types of surfactants: cationic, anionic, and non-ionic. The positively charged hydrophilic head of the surfactant adsorbs onto the negatively charged surface while keeping its hydrophobic end away from the surface. Thus, the hybrid surface repels polar solvents, including water. Similarly, the hydrophobic surface is formed again when anionic surfactants get adsorbed onto a positively charged surface.5 Apart from the structure, the concentration of the surfactant also plays an important role.6 In a particular study, Bao et al. have studied the effects of the surfactant concentration on the nucleation and growth of cobalt nanoparticles, where the Co system was used as a model.7 Recently, researches on different morphologies of cobalt oxide, which include one dimensional (1D) to three-dimensional (3D) cobalt oxide, are under progress. The 3D structures vary with variation of synthesis method. The nickel foam based 3D shape appear like a start fish, mesoporous cobalt oxide prepared by solvothermal method are of core-shell structure and hydrothermal synthesis leads to gem like structure.6,8,9
Supercapacitors are current devices for energy storage and are potential candidates exhibiting high power density, extended cycle life, and a wide window of operational temperature.10–12 Supercapacitors can be categorized into (i) electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and (ii) pseudocapacitors. EDLCs follow the electrostatic adsorption/desorption process for charge storage, whereas, in the pseudocapacitors, it is due to swift faradaic redox reactions.13–16
Cobalt oxide nanoparticles are the most favourable materials for technology relevant applications such as information storage devices, magnetic fluids, and catalysts.17 Cobaltite oxide is the most widely used material in electrochemical capacitor applications among cobaltous oxide (CoO), cobaltic oxide (Co2O3), and cobaltite oxide (Co3O4).18 The black tricobalt tetraoxide, Co3O4, is usually a product of the thermal treatment of cobalt hydroxide, Co(OH)2, at temperatures above 300 °C.19,20
Co3O4 is a new type of electrode material for electrochemical capacitors with a high reversible specific capacity. Due to the high predicted capacitance, cobalt oxide is the most preferred material for pseudocapacitor behaviour.21,22 It is reported that a specific capacitance of 220 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density was observed for Co3O4 nanocubes, and a specific capacitance of 675.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density was observed for Co3O4–graphene composite nanospheres.23,24 A comparative study was carried out where some of the cobalt oxide samples prepared by different methods produced different structures and shapes as well as the capacitance was also different (Table S1, ESI†).23,25–29 Normally, 3D structures possess a higher surface area as compared to 1D and 2D structures. Similarly, 2D structures possess more surface area as compared to the 1D nanostructures. The capacitance obtained in this case is 777.45 F g−1, which is higher than that of cobalt oxide nanocubes (350 F g−1) and quite comparable with 960 F g−1. The specific capacitance values of cationic and anionic surfactant-assisted cobalt oxide materials were 777.45 F g−1 and 250.9 F g−1, respectively, compared to 263 F g−1 of cobalt oxide prepared without using any surfactant.26 The capacitance values of the cationic and anionic surfactant-assisted cobalt oxide are different due to the difference in the flake arrangement.
In the present study, Co3O4 nanostructures were synthesized using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), followed by calcination at various temperatures. The crystallinity and surface morphology of the nanostructures were analysed by powder X-ray diffraction, FESEM, and HRTEM techniques. Further, the surface functionalities and thermal stability of the samples were demonstrated by FTIR, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy. After systematic physicochemical characterizations, the electrochemical charge storage performance of all the samples (CTAB-uncalcined, CTAB-350 °C, CTAB-500 °C, SLS-uncalcined, SLS-350 °C and SLS-500 °C) was demonstrated in a two-compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell via cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Cobalt(II) nitrate monohydrate Co(NO3)2·H2O, urea [(H2N)2-CO], cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), cetrimonium bromide [(C16H33)N(CH3)3Br], sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) [CH3(CH2)11SO4Na], absolute ethanol, acetone, and Nafion were of analytical reagent grade and obtained from SD Fine Chemicals Ltd, India. All the chemicals were used without any further purification. Double-distilled water was used for the preparation of solutions.
2.2 Synthesis procedure
In a typical process, 0.5 M Co(NO3)2·H2O and 25 mM urea were put into 40 ml of distilled water at room temperature to form a homogeneous solution, followed by the addition of 0.05 g of CTAB, and then the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 60 ml capacity. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. After that, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The rosy pink products were collected via filtration, washed several times using distilled water and absolute ethanol to remove impurities, and then dried under a vacuum at 60 °C for 3 h. Accordingly, another batch of the sample was synthesized using 0.05 g of SLS instead of CTAB while keeping all other conditions same. The resultant samples were then calcined at temperatures 350 °C (CTAB-350 °C, SLS-350 °C) and at 500 °C (CTAB-500 °C, SLS-500 °C) for 2 h to form cobalt oxide from the cobalt hydroxide sample. Here, the uncalcined samples thus formed using CTAB and SLS were named as CTAB-uncalcined and SLS-uncalcined, respectively. The detailed synthetic process is presented in Scheme 1.

2.3 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples prepared by different synthetic methods were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Model: RIGAKU ULTIMA IV) in the 2θ range of 5–80° at a scan rate of 3° min−1 and applied voltage of 30 kV using Cu Kα as an X-ray source. The thermal analysis, i.e., both thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements, was carried out using a Mettler–Toledo TGA/SDTA851e thermo analyser in the temperature range of 25–1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air flow (50 ml min−1). The surface morphology was studied via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Model SUPRA 55 ZEISS). A transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Model: FEI, TECNAI G2 20, TWIN) operated at 200 kV was used to study the morphological and lattice imaging features of the as-synthesised samples. For the TEM analysis, a very dilute dispersion of the as-synthesised sample (in acetone) was put on a carbon-coated Cu grid and dried under a lamp. In order to calculate the diameter of the nanoparticles, the Image-J software was used. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 on an FT-IR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd, Kolkata) using KBr as a reference. Here, an optimum amount of KBr and synthesized samples were mixed properly, and the as-prepared pellets were then subjected to FT-IR analysis. Raman spectra were recorded using a RENISHAW Raman spectrometer, where an argon ion laser beam was used as the excitation source at 540 nm. A UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100, model; EL 96043181) was used to measure the absorbance in the range 200–2500 nm using boric acid as the reference. The specific surface area of CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C were determined by the Brunaeur–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption/desorption method at 77 K using Quanta chrome Instruments (version 5.21).
2.4 Electrochemical study
The electrochemical characterization was carried out using a Biologic instrument (VSP-200 in a two-compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell comprising the sample-modified glassy carbon, a bare platinum wire, and an aqueous alkaline Hg/HgO solution as the working, auxiliary, and reference electrodes, respectively). At first, the glassy carbon electrode (GCE; 3 mm diameter) was sequentially polished to a mirror surface with alumina slurry (1, 0.3, 0.05 μ), followed by washing by bath sonication in deionized water. Moreover, an optimized amount of the sample (CTAB-uncalcined, CTAB-350 °C, CTAB-500 °C, SLS-uncalcined, SLS-350 °C, and SLS-500 °C) and Nafion was added to ethanol and mixed properly via ultrasonication for 5 min (here, this mixture is termed as ink). An optimized volume of the ink was drop cast onto the mirror-polished GCE and dried in a vacuum desiccator prior to the measurement. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded by sweeping the working electrode at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0–0.55 V vs. Hg/HgO in 5 M KOH electrolyte. Similarly, the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles were recorded in the potential range of 0–0.4 V at different applied current densities. The specific capacitance (Cs), energy density (ED), and power density (PD) of the electrode material was calculated from the cyclic voltammogram using the following equations.30,31 (1) (2) (3)Here, I, dV, θ, and m are the current, potential window, sweep rate, and mass of the electrode material taken for the measurement, respectively. Further, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz at an amplitude of 5 mV, and presented as real vs. imaginary impedance (Nyquist impedance).
3. Result and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical characterization
The PXRD patterns of the samples synthesized in the presence of different surfactants and at different calcined temperatures are shown in Fig. 1. All the diffraction patterns of SLS-uncalcined and CTAB-uncalcined were indexed to mixed phases of hexagonal (Wyckoff positions of the space group: Pm1 (164)) β Co(OH)2 and cubic (Wyckoff positions of the space group: Fdm (227)) β-Co3O4, which are in good agreement with the standard references (JCPDS No. 01-074-1057 and JCPDS No. 03-065-3103). However, the diffraction patterns of CTAB-350 °C/SLS-350 °C and CTAB-500 °C/SLS-500 °C are well-indexed to the cubic phase [space group: Fd3m(227)] of Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 76-1802). No characteristic peaks of impurity phases such as CoO and CoOOH are present, indicating the high purity of the final products. From the diffraction data, the grain diameter was calculated, compared, and presented in Table 1. The data revealed that the grain diameter of the uncalcined CTAB and SLS-assisted samples was 11.15 nm and 11.14 nm, respectively. After calcination at 350 °C, the hydroxide phase got converted into the oxide phase, and thus a decrease in the grain diameter was observed (10.41 nm and 10.42 nm, respectively), which further increases to 12.15 nm and 11.22 nm, respectively, with the increase in the calcination temperature to 500 °C for both CTAB and SLS-assisted samples.

The surface functionalities of the uncalcined and calcined (at 500 °C) samples synthesized using different surfactants was studied via FTIR spectroscopy (as shown in Fig. 2a and b). The peaks observed near 1548 and 1342 cm−1 were due to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of carbonyls.32 Peaks that appeared near 830 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra of the samples can be assigned to δ(CO3).33 The broadband observed at 3100–3550 cm−1 was due to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups present in the composition of the deposit, i.e., OH groups of cobalt hydroxides and adsorbed water molecules.34 The band near 2361 cm−1 was due to the CC conjugated and CC bond. The absorption peaks at 655 and 494 cm−1 were assigned to the ν(Co–O) modes.35 The Raman spectra of cobalt oxides formed by different surfactants are presented in Fig. 3. Four Raman active modes were found for the spinel structure of Co3O4, i.e., A1g, Eg, F2g, and T2g, out of which A1g (674 cm−1) is the most prominent one. The peaks at 189 cm−1 and 513 cm−1 correspond to the F2g and T2g mode of Co3O4.36 The peak present at 470 cm−1 is due to the Eg mode of the Co3O4 crystalline phase of the CTAB-assisted route and is consistent with previous investigations.37,38

In the Co3O4 spinel, Co2+ (3d7) and Co3+ (3d6) are located at tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. Four active Raman modes located approximately at ∼190, ∼470, ∼512, and ∼671 cm−1 can be clearly observed. All observed modes are in agreement with the values of pure Co3O4 with an average shift of the order of Δν = ∼5 cm−1 (191, 470, 510, 608, and 675 cm−1) for both the cases. The shift may be attributed to the size factor or surface stress. The intensities of the Raman bands are higher for the calcined sample of the CTAB-assisted cobalt oxide as compared to those of the SLS-assisted cobalt oxide. The reason is attributed to the presence of a comparatively greater number of voids in the case of CTAB-assisted cobalt oxide after calcination when the organic group was burnt at 500 °C. More number of voids help in developing a higher surface area and lower density, and hence, more number of molecules can be accommodated and excited to higher energy levels.
Further, the thermal behaviour of the samples synthesized in the presence of different surfactants was studied via thermogravimetry and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses (Fig. 4). In the case of CTAB, only two phases of the mass loss were observed. The first phase of the mass loss was before 200 °C, and it was mainly due to the removal of physiosorbed and chemisorbed water molecules. The main weight loss was observed between 400 °C and 600 °C, and it may be ascribed to the endothermic dehydroxylation of Co3O4 and exothermal combustion of the residual organic part.25 In the temperature range of 400–600 °C, first, the brucite-like layer will collapse. Then, the anions present in between the layers decomposed.39,40 The maximum weight loss occurred in this region, which thereby confirmed that organic anions were accommodated in between the interlamellar space. Similar phenomenon was observed in the case of SLS. However, in the case of SLS, another weight loss of 1.07% was found between 800 and 900 °C, which was due to the presence of sulphate ions.

The surface morphologies of the as-prepared samples were studied via FESEM and TEM analyses (Fig. 5). The layered-like structures were formed in the presence of both CTAB and SLS, as shown in Fig. 5(a and d). However, the BET surface area analysis shows the availability of more specific surface area in the case of CTAB-500 °C (29 m2 g−1) compared to that of SLS-500 °C (13 m2 g−1) (Fig. S1, ESI†). These layered architectures were made up of extremely thin nanoflakes with smooth surfaces. Fig. 5(b, c, e, and f) depict that the 3D layer-like morphologies were built from the intergrowth of Co3O4 nanoflakes. Irrespective of the type of surfactant used, nanospheres of Co3O4 were first developed after the thermal treatment. Subsequently, these tiny spheres aggregated to form nanoflakes, which exhibited flaky and porous structures (Fig. 5g and h). The micrograph reflects the fact that calcined particles had smooth and porous structure, whereas denser, non-porous, and smoothed-layered morphology was observed for the Co3O4 sample before the thermal treatment. On the other hand, after Co3O4 formation, excess OH− and water molecule evaporated during the thermal treatment, thus leading to the generation of some defects at the surface through the etching process, which might have enhanced the electrochemical properties of the nano Co3O4 particles.

Further, the transmission electron microscopy was employed to characterize the lateral dimension and crystal lattices of the as-synthesized Co3O4 particles. As shown in Fig. 6a and d, both CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C are composed of tiny spherical particles. In addition, the d-spacing calculated from the fringes observed in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of these nanospheres was found to be ∼0.47 nm (Fig. 6b and e),which is closely related to the d-spacing for the (111) orientation of a cubic Co3O4 [JCPDS: 98-006-9366]. The higher crystallinity of the sample was conferred from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern that clearly indicates that numerous crystallographic planes of spinel Co3O4 well-matched with the above-discussed powder X-ray diffraction spectrum (Fig. 6c and f). Moreover, the elemental composition of these two samples was verified by the energy dispersive spectra (EDS), which confirm the presence of Cu, Co, and O elements (Fig. S2, ESI†).

The UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the as-synthesized sample and peaks corresponding to typical Co3O4 transitions are presented in Fig. 7(a). The figure displays two broad absorption regions at around 475 nm and 1702–2150 nm. The absorption band at 475 nm was due to the O2− → Co2+ ligand to metal charge transfer transition, while the broad absorption region of 1702–2150 nm may be observed due to crystal field transitions and intervalence charge-transfer of Co2+ → Co3+, thereby representing an internal oxidation–reduction process in the sample. Fig. 7(b) shows the Tauc plot drawn for both the cobalt oxide samples synthesized using two different surfactants. From the Tauc plot, it can be observed that in the case of CTAB-synthesized Co3O4, the curve can be linearly fitted into two lines with two intercepts, thereby revealing the dual bandgap nature. These two intercepts at around 0.92 and 2.26 eV can harvest both in the NIR and visible regions, whereas the SLS-synthesized Co3O4 shows a bandgap value of around 1.5 eV, which lies only in the NIR region.

3.2 Electrochemical characterization
After the systematic physicochemical characterizations, the charge storage performance of the as-synthesized surfactant-modified Co3O4 was determined via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques, in which a three-electrode electrochemical cell with 5 M KOH electrolyte was used. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammograms of CTAB and SLS-modified Co3O4. The figure clearly shows that among the three samples, CTAB-uncalcined, CTAB-350 °C, and CTAB-500 °C, the CTAB-500 °C sample shows better performance in terms of higher specific capacitance values. Similarly, among SLS-uncalcined, SLS-350 °C, and SLS-500 °C, SLS-500 °C shows better specific capacitance values. Therefore, we conducted the detailed electrochemical characterizations of CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C and compared their charge storage performances. The cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic discharge profiles of CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C are presented in Fig. 8.

A pair of distinguished redox peaks (characteristic redox peak of cobalt oxide) found in CVs demonstrated the dominating pseudocapacitive behaviour of the material, as observed in previous reports.41,42 Interestingly, on increasing the sweep rate from 1 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1, the current increases (with positive and negative shifts of the anodic and cathodic peaks) while retaining the shape of the CV curve, demonstrating the reversible redox behaviour of the material (Fig. 8a and c). CTAB-500 °C shows a specific capacitance of 777.45 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1, which is higher in comparison to that of SLS-500 °C (250.9 F g−1) and previously reported cobalt oxides (as calculated from the CV). Fig. 8(b and d) shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles for CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C at different applied current densities (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 A g−1). The values of specific capacitance were close (750.50 F g−1 for CTAB-500 °C and 243.40 F g−1 for SLS-500 °C at 2 A g−1 applied current density) to that calculated from the charge–discharge profiles (Fig. 8b and d). The excellent capacitive characteristics make CTAB-500 °C a suitable material to be employed as active electrode material in future energy storage systems. The energy storage efficiency of CTAB-500 °C was also accessed by calculating the energy and power densities as per eqn (2) and (3). CTAB-500 °C shows higher ED (32.66 W h kg−1) and PD (39.8 kW kg−1) compared to those of SLS-500 °C (10.54 W h kg−1 and 9.85 kW kg−1), which supports the above observation.
The EIS spectra of CTAB-500 °C and SLS-500 °C can be divided into three segments: solution resistance, charge-transfer resistance, and diffusivity of the material (Fig. 9a). The intersection of the x-axis with the curve shows the solution resistance (Rs) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, whereas the incomplete semicircle at the higher frequency region and the slope of the line at the lower frequency region signifies the electron transfer resistance (RCT) of the induced charge on the electrode surface and the diffusivity of the electrode material, respectively. In comparison to SLS-500 °C (8.47 Ω), CTAB-500 °C (3.78 Ω) shows a lower Rs value, which can be attributed to the presence of CTAB in the form of Co3O4. Further, CTAB-500 °C shows a larger slope, thereby indicating lower charge transfer resistance compared to SLS-500 °C. The better conductivity improves the charge transfer rate, and the porous morphology shortens the ion diffusion path, facilitating the improved charge storage performance of CTAB-500 °C. Since the cyclic stability is an important parameter of an electroactive material for practical applications, the stability of CTAB-500 °C was determined by performing the cycling test at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 9b. The CTAB-500 °C-modified electrode shows ∼83% retention of initial capacitance after 5000 repeated cycles, demonstrating its suitability for practical applications.

Here, Co3O4 was synthesized via the hydrothermal method coupled with high-temperature annealing with CTAB and SLS as structure-directing surfactants. Both the samples were recognized as the suitable charge storage material; however, the CTAB-assisted Co3O4 sample that annealed at 500 °C showed better specific capacitance compared to Co3O4 derived via SLS. The inclusion of a structure-directing reagent builds up the crystal structure by itself being a part of the building blocks. Further, the calcination of the sample dissociates the organic groups creating voids. It is normally observed that bigger molecules create bigger voids, thus availing higher surface area compared to a smaller one. Here, the dominant charge storage activity of CTAB-500 °C might be due to the (a) lower charge transfer resistance of CTAB-500 °C that reduced the path length of the charge transfer, facilitating the reversible redox behavior compared to that of SLS-500 °C, (b) a layered-like surface morphology in the case of CTAB-500 °C, as observed in the FESEM images, compared to SLS-500 °C, and (c) higher specific surface area of CTAB-500 °C (29 m2 g−1) that avails more exposed surface towards the access of electrolyte compared to SLS-assisted cobalt oxide (13 m2 g−1). Therefore, CTAB-500 °C showed higher charge storage performances compared to that of SLS-500 °C.
4. Conclusions
Cationic (CTAB) and anionic (SLS) surfactant-assisted cobalt oxides were synthesized hydrothermally, and the corresponding electrochemical potential was studied. The effect of the calcination temperature on the structure of Co3O4 was studied systematically, and the preliminary studies of its electrochemical activity presented that they are an excellent material for energy storage. The specific capacitance of CTAB and SLS-assisted cobalt oxide was found to be 777.45 F g−1 and 250.9 F g−1, respectively, at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in 5 M KOH. The CTAB-assisted Co3O4 films exhibited excellent supercapacitor behaviour.
