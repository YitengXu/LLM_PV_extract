    , Accepted 22nd April 2017First published on 28th April 2017AbstractThe first example of employing thiophene as the coordination center to assist C–H functionalization via a palladium catalyst has been described. The synthetically challenging penta-substituted benzylamines with five different functional groups could be easily achieved by taking advantage of transitive oxalyl amide/thiophene-directed C–H functionalization, which highlights its versatility in the construction of multiply-substituted arenes. The penta-substituted benzylamine displays its potential nature as a hole-transporting material.
Introduction
Multiply-substituted benzylamines1 are important synthetic units in biologically active molecules of pharmaceuticals and materials chemistry (Fig. 1).2 In these important biologically active molecules, most contain the thiophene moieties.3 However, only a few protocols for constructing multiply substituted thiophenyl-containing benzylamines have been disclosed.4 One of the general approaches is the transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling5 with pre-functionalized benzylamine derivatives. Thus, the development of highly regioselective C–H functionalization to synthesize multiply-substituted thiophenyl-containing benzylamines is challenging.
 Fig. 1  Examples of significant functional molecules containing thiophenes. 
In 2012, for the first time a pioneering work by Zhang's group6 employed thioether as a coordination center to realize ortho-olefination with palladium as a catalyst. This result revealed that a sulphur atom could realize site selective C–H activation. Later, Shi and co-workers reported a thioether directed ortho-olefination of benzyl thioethers with rhodium(III) as a catalyst in 2013.7 Moreover, the PS group and the 1,3-dithiane group have been demonstrated to have excellent assisting abilities in realizing arene oxidative olefination reactions with the rhodium(III) catalyst, which were disclosed by Miura's group.8 In 2014, Zhang and co-workers reported a sulfoxide directed ortho selective olefination reaction by employing palladium as the catalyst.9
Our group has demonstrated that the ortho-thiophenyl-containing benzylamines could be prepared through an oxidative C–H/C–H cross-coupling of oxalyl amide protected benzylamine derivatives and thiophenes (Scheme 1).10 Inspired by the recent development in thioether and sulfoxide moiety directed C–H functionalizations,11 we speculated that the thiophenyl moiety of ortho-thiophenyl-containing benzylamine might promote selectively C–H functionalization and build multiply-substituted thiophenyl-containing benzylamines. Herein, we report that a thiophene directed C–H olefination and alkynylation reactions and sequential C–H functionalization of benzylamine afforded hexa-substituted arenes through transitive oxalyl amide/thiophene directing. Besides, these full substituted benzylamines showed the potential nature act as charge transport molecules.

Results and discussion
We commenced our studies by exploring the effects of solvents, oxidants, and time on the palladium-catalyzed regioselective oxidative olefination of ortho-thiophenyl-substituted benzylamine 1a with ethyl acrylate 2a (Table 1). In an initial attempt, 1a (0.05 mmol) was treated with 2a (0.1 mmol) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (5.0 mol%) and Ag2CO3 (0.075 mmol) in dichloromethane at 80 °C for 18 h. The desired ortho-olefinated product 3a was obtained in 53% yield (Table 1, entry 5). Subsequently, we screened some other solvents, such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), toluene, tert-amyl alcohol (t-AmylOH) and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), however, all gave unsatisfactory yields (entries 1–4). To our surprise, great improvement was observed when AgOAc was used as an oxidant, product 3a was obtained in 91% yield (entry 6). Besides, other oxidants such as Ag2O, BQ, K2S2O8, and Cu(OAc)2 were all tested, at last AgOAc turned out to be the best (entries 7–10). When the reaction time was 12 h, the yield of 3a was reduced to 83% (entry 11).

With the effective conditions in hands (Table 1, entry 6), we explored the scope of substituted thiophenes amenable to this directed alkenylation (Table 2). Various substituents, such as chloro, bromo and ester were tolerated, affording the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (3a–3c). Benzo[b]thiophene was also compatible with this transformation (3d). More impressively, styrenes, for which there are few examples of palladium-catalyzed C–H olefination, were well tolerated, affording the corresponding products in moderate to good yields (3g–3i).

We subsequently demonstrated thiophenyl-directed C–H alkynylation with the ortho-heteroarylated benzylamines (Table 3). Initially, we treated the ortho-thiophenyl-substituted benzylamine 1e with acetylenic bromide (TipsccBr) 4a to investigate the optimum conditions. After screening the reaction conditions in terms of solvents, bases and oxidants (for detailed information, see the ESI†), the desired product 5c could be obtained in 81% isolated yield in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol%), AgOAc (1.0 equiv.), and CsOAc (2.0 equiv.) in toluene at 100 °C for 12 h (see the ESI†). All of the reactions proceeded well, affording the corresponding products in moderate to good yields under mild conditions, which further demonstrated the excellent directing ability of the thiophene substituents (5a–5g).

The development of this transitive C–H functionalization motivated us to explore sequential C–H functionalization for the construction of hexa-substituted arene rings (Scheme 2). When 1i was employed as a substrate under the standard alkenylation conditions, dialkenylated 3jdi was obtained as the major product in 62% yield, along with 28% yield of monoalkenylated 3jmono (Scheme 2). The analogous dialkynylated product 5g (Table 3) was observed in 67% yield. We achieved monoalkynylation of substrate 1i to give the penta-substituted benzylamine 5h in 61% yield under the reaction conditions. The synthetically challenging 5i was finally obtained in acceptable yield (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of penta-substituted benzylamines. 
It was demonstrated that the penta-substituted benzylamine derivative 3jdi could be applied as the hole-transporting materials in OPV (organic photovoltaic) devices. Preliminary study revealed that 0.39% of PCE (power conversion efficiency) could be achieved (Fig. 2). We believe that the PCE could be increased further by optimizing the testing procedure.

J–V characteristics of a solar cell using a 3jdi hole transporting material. 
Inspired by the coordination ability of thiophene, we devised a general approach to construct various substituted arenes through transitive C–H functionalization. For example, substrate 6a could be easily prepared through oxidative C–H/C–H cross-coupling according to You's report.12 Then we treated 6a with ethyl acrylate under the alkenylation conditions, and thereby the alkenylated product (7a) was obtained in 64% yield (Scheme 3). The first example of palladium-catalyzed ortho-C(sp2)–H arylation was developed by using thiophene as the directing group. The ortho-arylation 8a was achieved in 86% yield by treating 6a with iodobenzene.13 The results indicated that thiophenyl substituents are excellent directing groups in assisting C–H functionalization, offering a direct approach for the further modification of the molecular structure.
 Scheme 3  Directing group compatibility in thiophenyl-directed C–H functionalization. 
Subsequently, we investigated the two coordination centers involved in the oxalyl amide/thiophene-directed C–H functionalization. Substrate 1a was treated with 1.0 equivalent of Pd(OAc)2 in [D6] dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature and at 60 °C for 6 h, by monitoring with 1H NMR (see the ESI†). The results indicated that the palladium directly coordinated with the thiophenyl sulfur atom, rather than the interaction with the oxalyl amide coordination center. The obtained results imply that the oxalyl amide directing group did not affect the thiophene-directed C–H functionalization. Thus, we proposed the mechanism shown in Scheme 4. The thiophene-directed C–H activation through a concerted metalation–deprotonation (CMD) pathway afforded palladium intermediate A.14 The subsequent migratory insertion of olefin 2 may generate intermediate B, which undergoes β-hydride elimination to give the final products 3.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a new approach to prepare multiply-substituted arenes. Thiophenes have shown an excellent assisting ability in directing C–H functionalization. Transition-metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization of thiophene with different functional groups has been successfully performed, affording the synthetically challenging hexa-substituted arenes with five different functional groups. Preliminary study revealed that penta-substituted benzyl amines could be applied as the hole-transporting materials in OPV (organic photovoltaic) devices. The mechanistic studies indicated that the thiophenyl sulfur atom directly coordinates with palladium, rather than the oxalyl amide directing group.
