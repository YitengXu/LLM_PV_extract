    , Accepted 13th June 2016First published on 13th June 2016AbstractWater splitting allows the storage of solar energy into chemical bonds (H2 + O2) and will help to implement the urgently needed replacement of limited available fossil fuels. In particular, in a neutral environment electrochemically initiated water splitting suffers from low efficiency due to high overpotentials (η) caused by the anode. Electro-activation of X20CoCrWMo10-9, a Co-based tool steel resulted in a new composite material (X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4) that catalyzes the anode half-cell reaction of water electrolysis with a so far, unequalled effectiveness. The current density achieved with this new anode in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M phosphate buffer is over a wide range of η around 10 times higher compared to recently developed, up-to-date electrocatalysts and represents the benchmark performance which advanced catalysts show in regimes that support water splitting significantly better than pH 7 medium. X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 exhibited electrocatalytic properties not only at pH 7, but also at pH 13, which are much superior to the ones of IrO2–RuO2, single-phase Co3O4- or Fe/Ni-based catalysts. Both XPS and FT-IR experiments unmasked Co3O4 as the dominating compound on the surface of the X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 composite. By performing a comprehensive dual beam FIB-SEM (focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy) study, we could show that the new composite does not exhibit a classical substrate-layer structure due to the intrinsic formation of the Co-enriched outer zone. This structural particularity is basically responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance.

Broader context
The exploration of promising renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources for the future, capable for implementing the urgent replacement of fossil fuels, is one of the significant challenges for scientists and engineers concerned with research on energy issues. The implementation of a hydrogen economy is seen as the mainstay for the reorganization of our current energy sector. Electrocatalytically initiated splitting of water realized using solar energy is considered to be the most promising route for the large-scale production of hydrogen fuel. It is well known that the effectiveness of this attractive solar to fuel conversion route is severely restricted by the high overpotentials caused by commonly used electrode materials on the anode side. This is particularly true when the electrochemical cleavage of water is carried out at neutral pH. The scarcity of oxygen-evolving catalysts that are inexpensive, stable, based on earth-abundant elements, easy to fabricate in large areas and highly active under neutral conditions is a serious obstacle. Our efforts regarding the generation of steel-based electrocatalysts culminated in a composite consisting of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel and a Co-oxide based ceramic which proved to be outstandingly efficient for the anodic conversion of water into oxygen in the neutral regime.

In spite of the drastic oil price collapse in the second half of 2014 resulting in a price below 30 $ per barrel in January 2016,1 the exploration of promising renewable energy sources for the future is one of the significant challenges for scientists and engineers concerned with the research on energy issues. Splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen by exploiting solar energy transforms water to an inexhaustible and environmentally friendly fuel source.2–9 Electrocatalytically initiated hydrogen and oxygen formation from water is considered an important realization of this solar to fuel conversion route10–12 but is typically hampered by the high overpotentials of oxygen evolution on the anode side.13,14 This is particularly true when the electrochemical cleavage of more or less untreated water is intended, i.e., when the splitting procedure is carried out at neutral pH. Noble metals like Pt, Ir, Ru, and Au as well as noble metal containing compounds like IrO2, IrO2–RuO2, IrNiOx, and RuO2–NiO are famous for their comparatively low overpotential when used as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in the neutral regime15,16 but incur high acquisition costs. Therefore, non-noble metal based OER electrocatalysts have been of interest for decades and the elaboration of the list of potential candidates suitable to ensure a stable and reasonable high oxygen evolution based current in the neutral regime at potentials as close as possible to Nernstian potentials (1.228 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at standard temperature and pressure) is a field with significant activity.17–24Scheme 1 gives some idea of the position of current heterogeneous catalysts in terms of their efficiency regarding OER in the neutral regime.
 Scheme 1  The performance of recently developed heterogeneous catalysts for OER in a neutral environment. (*This work) 
Very recently, we reported on surface oxidized mild steel S 235 as a prospective electrode material for the anodic splitting of water under neutral conditions. We determined η = 462 mV for the OER on iron oxide-based layers in 0.1 M phosphate (pH 7) buffer solution at 1 mA cm−2 current density25 which is still far below the OER performance of up-to-date electrocatalysts shown in the alkaline regime.26 Iron based films,27,28 Ni-(oxy)hydroxide-borate,29 cobalt phosphate compounds,30,31 cobalt borate/graphene,32 nano-scaled cobalt oxide based catalysts like Co3O4 nanowire arrays33 and graphene Co3O4 nanocomposites42 are among the non-noble-compounds for which a slightly better OER activity with overpotentials down to 492 mV at 10 mA cm−2 has been demonstrated (Scheme 1). However, very rarely long-term voltage–current behavior or Faradaic efficiency has been shown. In addition, some of the protocols reported are laborious and precursors are costly. Thus, motivated by the superlative, sheer unrivalled properties of spinel Co3O4, which are limited in any case to OER electrocatalysis,34–39 we intended to gain an intrinsically grown, Co3O4-based ceramic–alloy composite which has substantially better properties than the “dream-like” Co3O4 starting from simple steel. An outstanding electrocatalytically active and stable X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 composite was created via a straightforward electro-oxidation of, a Co-based tool steel under harsh conditions.

OER properties in neutral medium

Fig. 1 represents a comparison of the electrochemical OER properties of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel which had been anodized prior to electrocatalysis in 7.2 M NaOH at 1875 mA cm−2 for 300 min, henceforth referred to as sample Co-300, with untreated X20CoCrWMo10-9, designated as sample Co, in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. It should be mentioned at this point that electrochemical measurements were carried out without any correction of the ohmic voltage drop with the exception of the measurements on which the Tafel plots shown in the ESI† are based.
 Fig. 1  Overview of the electrochemical OER properties of non-treated X20CoCrWMo10-9 alloy (sample Co) and surface oxidized X20CoCrWMo10-9 (sample Co-300) in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. (a) Cyclic voltammetric plots of sample Co/sample Co-300 at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. (b) Long term chronopotentiometric measurement of sample Co-300 and chronopotentiometric measurement of sample Co performed at 10 mA cm−2 current density. Average overpotential for the OER obtained through 40000 s plot: 298 mV (Co-300). Average overpotential for the OER obtained through 2000 s plot: 829 mV (Co). 
A significant improvement of the voltage–current behavior can be observed from both, the non-steady state (Fig. 1a) and the steady state polarization (Fig. 1b) experiments. The CV of sample Co-300 showed along the entire curve a substantially stronger current to voltage ratio than the CV of sample Co and reached, at an upper voltage limit of 1.9 V vs. RHE, an impressive current density of 28 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1a). A reasonable current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved at only 1.45 V vs. RHE which corresponds to 222 mV overpotential (Fig. 1a). With regard to the steady state performance in the neural regime, Co-300 fulfilled our expectations based on the outcome of the CV experiments. Catalysis of oxidative water splitting was outstandingly efficient and stable resulting in an unusually low overpotential (298 mV) required to realize 10 mA cm−2 current density for 40000 s at pH 7 (Fig. 1b). To the best of our knowledge, such a strong current voltage ratio has never been shown before, neither in cyclic voltammetric nor in chronopotentiometric measurements performed at pH 7. Moreover, it represents the level of performance of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in regimes that support water splitting much better than pH 7 buffer solution, like acids and bases. Thus, electro-activated steel AISI 304 which we reported on recently exhibited a comparative behavior in 0.1 M KOH.26
In general, most of the established OER electrocatalysts show at overpotentials of around 500 mV an OER current density that is approximately ten times lower (1 mA cm−2).18,25,27,30,40,41,45 Exceptions are rare. Thus, for instance, Co3O4 nanowire arrays developed by He et al. showed in polarization measurements33 an unusually strong voltage–current behavior at pH 7.2 (η ∼ 480 mV at 5 mA cm−2). The absence of steady state measurements performed at pH 7.2 and the absence of experiments quantifying the oxygen formation make it difficult to conclusively assess the OER performance. Even slightly better properties have been shown for graphene–Co3O4 nanocomposites under neutral conditions (498 mV at 10 mA cm−2).42 Unfortunately, no long term voltage–current behavior was shown and the release of oxygen was not quantified.42 To confirm the assumption that the chosen electro-activation procedure creates, on the steel surface a passivating oxide layer that sufficiently protects the metal matrix below the layer against further oxidation and to confirm that the current determined using electrochemical measurements is exclusively due to oxygen evolution, the oxygen formation was quantified and the mass loss was determined. No mass loss occurring during long term operation at 10 mA cm−2 and 5 mA cm−2 was obtained (Table S1, ESI†) and the charge to oxygen conversion rate after 2000 s operation time (Table S2, ESI† and Fig. 2a, b) amounted to 75.6% (10 mA cm−2), and 83.2% (5 mA cm−2), thus, reflecting a similar outcome when compared to the findings we extracted from OER experiments with Ni, Fe-oxide coated AISI 304 steel in 0.1 M KOH.26 The Faradaic efficiency of a variety of OER electrocatalysts under neutral conditions has been investigated by several groups, but in most cases at significantly lower current densities.31 Manganese oxide based OER electrocatalysts as a model system for the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II were frequently studied and based on head space measurements, the Faradaic efficiency amounted to 78% after 90 min of OER at lower current density in pH controlled Na2SO443 solution. Low Faradaic efficiencies at higher current densities do not necessarily indicate an oxidation/dissolution of the catalysts themselves but can up to some extent be caused by inaccurate measurements. We assume that at relatively high current densities, undissolved oxygen gas bubbles are generated, i.e. oxygen cannot be dissolved with the speed with which it is formed. Thus, significantly lower Faradaic efficiencies were obtained by Qiu et al. (2014) for Ni–Fe containing nanoparticles in 1 M KOH by increasing current densities (from 97% at 1 mA cm−2 to 43% at 10 mA cm−2).44

Electrode area: 2 cm2; correlation of oxygen evolution on sample Co-300 in 0.1 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (blue curve) with the charge passed through the electrode system (the red line corresponds to 100% Faradaic efficiency). (a) Amount of the electrolyte: 2.3 L; start value of dissolved oxygen: 0.06 mg L−1 (t = 0 s); end value of dissolved oxygen (t = 2000 s): 0.66 mg L−1 (nominal value (100%): 0.781 mg L−1). Faradaic efficiency of the OER after 2000 s runtime: 83.2%. (b) Amount of the electrolyte: 2.3 L; start value of dissolved oxygen: 0.07 mg L−1 (t = 0 s); end value of dissolved oxygen (t = 2000 s): 1.16 mg L−1 (nominal value (100%): 1.51 mg L−1). Faradaic efficiency of the OER after 2000 s runtime: 75.6%. 
A comparison of the OER properties of our steel samples at pH 7 with the corresponding characteristics of noble metal containing catalysts is a sine qua non for an in-depth evaluation of these materials. We chose commercially available IrO2–RuO2 sputtered on titanium as the reference sample (sample Ir/Ru) for OER activity and stability at pH 7. A direct comparison of the OER performance of samples Co, Co-300 and Ir/Ru can be derived from Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of the electrochemical OER properties of sample Co/sample Co-300 with sample Ir/Ru in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. (a) Cyclic voltammetric plots of sample Co-300 and sample Ir/Ru at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. (b) Tafel plots of samples Co, Co-300 and Ir/Ru based on 200 second chronopotentiometry scans at current densities 0.65, 1.33, 2, 2.66, 4, 5.33, 6.66, 8, 10, 13.3, 16.6 and 20 mA cm−2. 
The CV curve of sample Co-300 (Fig. 3a, blue curve) was found to be substantially steeper than the CV curve of sample Ir/Ru, thus over the entire range of overpotentials sample Co-300 exhibited superior electrocatalytic OER activity when compared to Ir–Ru (Fig. 3a, red curve). As expected, a similar outcome can be derived from the corresponding Tafel lines of samples Co-300 and Ir/Ru, showing a horizontal shift of around 220 mV (Fig. 3b). This represents enormous progress, taking into consideration that our group had significant problems with substantially improving the OER properties of steel by surface oxidation to a level that makes it competitive to IrO2–RuO2 with regard to the water-splitting properties under neutral conditions.25,45
A substantial horizontal shift (∼450 mV) of the Tafel line of sample Co-300 (blue squares) compared to the corresponding Tafel line of untreated steel Co (black squares) towards lower potentials (Fig. 3b) proved what we already derived from Fig. 1: meaningful enhancement of the OER relevant electrocatalytic properties under neutral conditions by the applied surface oxidation. This horizontal shift between Tafel lines assigned to the Co sample and the Co-300 sample can only be explained by a change in the chemical nature of the surface during surface oxidation, whereas an increase of the active surface during the surface oxidation would lead to a vertical shift of CV curves or Tafel lines.
AFM experiments done with Co/Co-300 (Fig. S1, ESI†) helped to further exclude this kind of strong “surface area” effect. In order to obtain more meaningful results covering the whole surface area we performed in addition multiple point nitrogen gas adsorption BET measurements (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). As expected, there are no substantial differences with regard to the surface area (Co: 0.353 m2 g−1; Co-300: 0.368 m2 g−1) or the adsorption/desorption plots of both samples (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†).
Interestingly, at current densities <5 mA cm−2 the Tafel line belonging to sample Co-300 was substantially steeper (slope 140.8 mV dec−1) than the one assigned to IrO2–RuO2 (slope 225.8 mV dec−1) (Fig. 3b). The Tafel plots of samples Co-300 and Ir/Ru showed a slight dual Tafel behavior with lower slopes in the lower overpotential region (Co-300: 140.8 mV dec−1; Ir/Ru: 225.8 mV dec−1) and higher slopes in the higher overpotential region (Co-300: 674 mV dec−1; Ir/Ru: 682 mV dec−1). In principle, the dual Tafel characteristics could be a kind of artifact due to the lack of voltage drop compensation (IR compensation), where R is the sum of contributions of both electrolyte and electrode resistances. We therefore performed an IR compensation on the OER polarization measurements on which the Tafel plots are based in order to achieve more reliable testimony (Fig. S3, ESI†). As also obtained by other groups,46 IR compensation performed using a standardized software was found to be too strong, i.e. led to an anomalous voltage–current behavior (reduced current at increased potential) in the high potential region, we corrected ohmic losses as shown in one of our previous reports25 manually by subtracting the ohmic voltage drop from the measured potential on the basis of an electrolyte (pH 7 buffer solution) resistance of 3.4 Ω at a 0.5 mm electrode distance.47 The dual Tafel behavior was found to be less pronounced but remained in the plots based on IR corrected data for samples Co-300 and Ir/Ru (Fig. S3, ESI† blue and red curve). Independent from the correction of the voltage drop, untreated steel X20CoCrWMo10-9 exhibited a single Tafel behavior (Fig. 3b and Fig. S3, ESI† black curve). A slope of 181 mV and 235.9 mV dec−1 was obtained under neutral conditions for the IR corrected (Fig. S3, ESI† black curve) and non-IR corrected data of sample Co (Fig. 3b, black curve), respectively. Due to the fact that this single Tafel behavior occurs at quite high overpotential we assume that the dual Tafel behavior obtained for samples Co-300 and Ir/Ru at significantly lower potential does not simply indicate the bottleneck effect due to mass transport limitations. The onset of diffusion limitation of the electrocatalytic OER depends on many parameters but is considered not to occur below 20 mA cm−2.48
Significantly reduced Tafel slopes were obtained for all samples when IR corrected data were utilized. For instance, a slope of 97.8 mV dec−1 and 291.1 mV dec−1 was determined for Co-300 in the lower overpotential region and the higher overpotential region (Fig. S3, ESI† blue curve), respectively. This agrees very well with values determined recently for the OER on graphene–Co3O4 nanocomposites in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at lower overpotentials (98 mV dec−1).42 Evolving oxygen bubbles may block electrochemical active sites as reported by Lu et al.49 and could cause a higher Tafel slope at higher potential, i.e. a transition between regions with different slopes. Of course, increased Tafel slopes at increased potentials might also be a sign of degradation of the catalyst, but this origin can be excluded here in the case of all three samples tested (Fig. 3b and Fig. S3, ESI†), as repeated determination of the Tafel plots did not lead to other findings. Besides these “technical effects”, dual Tafel characteristics could imply a different OER mechanism, different catalytically active species, or a different rate-determining step for the OER at different overpotentials on the surface of Co-300.50
The origin of the high catalytic activity
In our recent report, we unmasked a dissolution process to be likely responsible for the enrichment of catalytic active species on the surface of AISI 304 steel during electro-activation.26 A substantial mass loss of around 6 mg took place whilst the electro-activation of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel as well as the formation of a black-grey layer on the Pt-counter electrode could be observed (Table S3, ESI†). These findings clearly prove parallels with regard to the process by which a hypothetical layer formation is based when AISI 304 and X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel are electro-oxidized in strong alkaline medium. We investigated the electrolyte (7.2 M NaOH) as well as the precipitate formed on the counter electrode during altogether five electro-activation procedures of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel via ICP OES. The results can be found in detail in the ESI† (Table S4). During activation the steel significantly lost Fe and Cr as well as Mo. Interestingly, no substantial amounts of Co could be detected either in the electrolyte used for the electro-activation or in the layer formed on the counter electrode (Table S4, ESI†). Thus, based on the outcome of these investigations, we assumed the formation of a Co-oxide layer on the surface of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel upon hard anodization. Obviously, a drastic enrichment of Co via suppression of Fe, Cr, W and Mo on the periphery of the Co-based tool steel had taken place at strong oxidative potential in alkaline solution. From an XPS study performed with sample Co and Co-300 after carrying out long term polarization experiments, we hoped to manifest this assumption and we wanted to identify which species are present on the surface of untreated and oxidized X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel.
A cursory glance at Fig. 4 is sufficient to detect the huge differences in samples Co and Co-300 with regard to the Co and Fe content on the surface. A low Co content on the surface of Co and a low Fe content on the surface of Co-300 can already be revealed from the low signal to noise ratio in the high resolution Co-2p and Fe-2p XPS spectra (Fig. 4b and d). Indeed, while Fe is the predominant metal element on the surface of sample Co (63.5 at%, Table S5, ESI†), Co clearly dominated on the surface of sample Co-300 (71.6%, Table S5, ESI†), which impressively exhibited the enrichment of Co/suppression of Fe on the surface of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel during electro-oxidation. Besides Fe, Cr was also found to be depleted on the surface upon hard anodization (Table S5, ESI†). The Co 2p3/2 binding energies and the overall peak shape of the Co 2p core level spectra of sample Co-300 (Fig. 4c) agree very well with the corresponding data derived from the XPS analysis of Co3O4 reported by Biesinger et al.51 The Co 2p3/2 related peaks are located at binding energies of 780 eV, and 786.4 eV, and the Co 2p1/2 peak is located at 795.2 eV. The charge transfer satellite which is characteristic for Co3O4 is also visible around 789.5 eV. Based on these findings, we intend to unmask spinel-type Co3O4 as the catalytic active compound on the surface of Co-300. With regard to the overall catalytic activity, we consider the impact of Mn oxide species, an admixture in the layer on Co-300 to be low (Table S5 and Fig. S4, ESI†). The same should apply to iron oxide compounds (very likely FeOOH) which could be detected in traces on the surface of Co-300 (Fig. 4b). Details of the outcome from the XPS study performed with samples and Co-300 can be found in the ESI† (Fig. S4).

Fitting results for sample Co at peak positions 780.603 eV and 795.624 eV. 
Binding energies of the corresponding reference compounds were extracted from the literature.51–53 Herewith, the discussion should be limited to the finding that all relevant alloying ingredients, such as Fe, Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, and W could be detected on the surface of untreated steel X20CoCrWMo10-9 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4c–e, h, Table S5, ESI†), whereas, for instance, W, Mo and Cr were completely suppressed on or close to the surface of sample Co-300 (Table S5, ESI†). Due to the electrochemical experiments in KOH/phosphate buffer solution performed with our samples prior to the XPS study the surface was contaminated with K and P (Fig. S4g, ESI†).
A FTIR spectroscopic study carried out with sample Co-300 after completion of long term polarization tests should be sufficient to obtain direct evidence for the existence of molecular Co3O4 on the surface of electro-activated X20CoCrWMo10-9. IR-measurements were performed in ATR (attenuated total reflection) mode as this technique allows direct detection of molecular species on the surface of solids. Unfortunately, we could not extract a meaningful FTIR spectrum from the oxide containing surface of Co-300 upon direct measurement of the specimen. We had already discussed this experience before when surface oxidized steel S235 or AISI 304 was studied.25,26,45 As the evanescent wave penetrates only up to a few microns into the sample a good contact between ATR diamond and the sample is crucial, and obviously was not ensured. Therefore, the active outer sphere of Co-300 was mechanically removed and the resulting powder was used for the FTIR study. Co3O4 is known to show two absorption bands with medium amplitude at specific positions (∼550 and 650 cm−1) due to the stretching vibration of the metal–O bond.54–56 Indeed, these absorption bands can be clearly seen in our spectrum (Fig. 5) indicating that Co is octahedral surrounded by oxygen. This finding represents the desired proof for the structural confirmation of Co3O4. Absorption bands positioned at somewhat higher wavenumbers suggest the existence of oxide, or hydroxide oxide species as well (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  FTIR spectra of the oxide based powder which was mechanically removed from the surface of specimen Co-300. IR-measurements were performed in ATR (attenuated total reflection) mode. 
The outcome of the XPS and the IR studies gives us some idea about why sample Co-300 shows this enormous activity towards catalytically initiated OER at pH 7 (Fig. 1–3). However, it should not go unmentioned that other, for instance upon electrodeposition, generated Co3O4 based OER electrocatalysts were found to be substantially less active33,42 than Co-300, which raises the suspicion that the existence of Co3O4 on the top of our electro-oxidized steel is a necessary but not a sufficient requirement for our findings. We assumed that the intrinsic formation of the Co3O4 based outer sphere of the electro-activated steel is besides the generally high catalytic activity of Co3O4 as such responsible for the very sufficient initiation of OER on Co-300. Thus, we expected a lower catalytic activity in the case in which X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel was coated by a Co3O4 layer, i.e. when the composition Co3O4 on the periphery of the sample was not implemented from the “inside of the material itself” but through a conventional coating process. We decided to perform an additional experiment in order to provide more valuable insights into this issue. X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel was coated with a Co3O4 layer designated as sample Depos-30.
Sample Depos-30 was generated using a two-step electrochemical approach consisting of cathodic electrodeposition of Co(OH)2 on the X20CoCrWMo10-9 substrate (Fig. 6a, pink curve) similar to the procedure described in the literature57 subsequently followed by electrochemical oxidation of the thin layer using chronopotentiometry performed at 10 mA cm−2 for 4000 s (Fig. 6a, blue curve). XPS analysis of the surface of sample Depos-30 confirmed the expectation that the layer basically consists of Co3O4 (Fig. S5, ESI†).

(b) Comparison of the non-steady state electrochemical OER properties of samples Co, Co-300 and Depos-30 in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M H2PO4/K2HPO4. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. Cyclic voltammetric plots of samples Co, Co-300 and Depos-30 at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. 
The Co 2p3/2 binding energies and the overall peak shape of the Co 2p core level spectra of sample Depos-30 (Fig. S5, ESI†) agree perfectly with those of sample Co-300 (Fig. 4c). Two 2p3/2 peaks located at binding energies of 780.5 eV and 785.4 eV can be obtained. The Co 2p1/2 peak is located at 795.8 eV. The charge transfer satellite which is characteristic of Co3O4 is also visible at around 790 eV. Despite a comparable surface composition, Depos-30 was found to be substantially less active toward electrochemically initiated oxygen formation at pH 7 than Co-300, as can be seen in the corresponding CV plots (Fig. 6b, green curve), and the chronopotentiometry plot (Fig. 6a, blue curve). The reader should keep in mind that η = 298 mV was required to initiate a stable OER current density of 10 mA cm−1 at pH 7 on the surface of Co-300 (Fig. 1b). Over the entire potential range, Co-300 exhibited a considerably higher current density than Depos-30 which lies perfectly in between sample Co-300 and sample Co (blue, green and black curve, Fig. 6b). Notably, an overpotential of around 500 mV was required to ensure a constant OER current density of 10 mA cm−2 for sample Depos-30 in pH 7 corrected buffer solution (blue curve, Fig. 6a) that agrees very well with the overall OER activity found for graphene/Co3O4 by Zhao et al.42 in the neutral pH regime. In addition, the non-steady state voltage current behavior of Depos-30 (h = 495 mV at 5 mA cm−2, Fig. 6b, green curve) at pH 7 is the same as that reported for Co3O4 nano-wire arrays at pH 7.2 by He et al. (η = 480 mV at 5 mA cm−233). Thus, although the composition of the surface of Depos-30 and Co-300 does not differ significantly, the OER performance does and the high catalytic activity of sample Co-300 cannot be solely explained by the fact that it's “outer sphere” consists basically of Co3O4. Since the base material of both samples is the same (X20CoCrWMo10-9), it suggests that the conditions in the gap between the substrate and the surface play a major role in determining the ability of the material to act as a good OER electrocatalyst. In addition, the very often obtained “island-like” growth of electrodeposited layers in combination with a coverage degree significantly below 100% could also be responsible for the lower OER performance of sample Depos-30. Nocera and co-workers, for instance, investigated an ITO electrodeposited Co based electrocatalyst and could still see the ITO substrate through cracks in the film using a SEM.30 In contrast to these findings, the surface of sample Co-300 proved to be compact and homogeneous (Fig. 7a and b). As expected, the surface of the alloy was completely oxidized and the bare metal cannot be seen after 300 min of electro-oxidation under harsh conditions (Fig. 7a). There is no contrast in the SEM image of sample Co-300 achieved using a back scatter detector (BSD) (Fig. 7b) clearly showing that there are no areas with different compositions. The finding was completely different when a Co-based oxide layer on the surface of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel was created upon electrodeposition (Fig. 7c–f). Remarkable differences with regard to the composition of the surface of Depos-30 can be revealed from the contrast in SEM images whenever a BSD detector was used (Fig. 7d and e). The longitudinal grooves of the bare steel surface caused by the grinding pretreatment can be clearly seen in the SEM image shown in Fig. 7f. Moreover, it turned out that the electrodeposited layer was incompact and exhibited cracks (Fig. 7e). It is reasonable to assume that the significantly lower OER electrocatalytic activity of sample Depos-30 when compared to Co-300 is partly caused by the lower coverage degree and the cracks of the deposited layer (Fig. 7c and f).
 Fig. 7  SEM images showing the topography of sample Co-300 (a and b) and sample Depos-30 (c–f), respectively. The accelerating voltage was adjusted to 10 kV and the SEM images were acquired using a secondary electron detector SESI (a, c and f) and back scatter detector NTS BSD (b, d and e), respectively. The NTS BSD detector was used for qualitative compositional imaging. Areas of the sample with heavier elements appear brighter. Ion (Ga) beam settings: current: 240 pA, voltage: 10 kV, duration: 25 min. 
Cross sectional analysis (vertical plane imaging) of samples Depos-30 and Co-300 was performed by the dual beam FIB-SEM technique in order to get detailed information about the specific gap between the substrate and the surface and to exhibit the expected “intrinsic” differences between Depos-30 and Co-300. The focused ion beam was used to cut out a trapezoidal trough in the surface deep enough to cover the complete outer zone of the specimen in which the composition and the microstructure of the material vary. Fig. 8a–d show the SEM images of the rear wall of the trapezoidal trough thus representing the cross sections of Co-300 (a and b), and Depos-30 (c and d). Notably, the low contrast in the SEM image (Fig. 8a) of sample Co-300 recorded using an energy selective backscattered detector (ESB) suggests that there is no abrupt change in the composition of Co-300 along the area investigated and the metal–ceramic transition can hardly be seen. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out and the spectra recorded along the FIB machined cross section of Co-300 (Fig. S6a, ESI†) confirmed this quantitatively (Fig. S6b–f, ESI†). The Cr- and Mn concentrations were below the detection limit. Closer to the surface iron was suppressed, whereas the Co, K, P, and O contents were found to be increased in the outer zone (Fig. S6b–f, ESI†), which is in perfect agreement with the XPS results (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4, Table S5, ESI†). The increment of K and P contents towards the surface (Fig. S6e, f and S7c, d, ESI†) can be easily explained by the electrochemical measurements carried out with samples Co-300 and Depos-30 in KOH and PO43− electrolyte prior to the FIB-SEM and EDS studies. The concentration of Co and O in the surface of Co-300 increased almost linearly by ∼four times (seven times) along a distance of 8 μm towards the surface (Fig. S6b and d, ESI†). The outer Co3O4 zone of Co-300 was found to be compact in a way that there is no access anymore from the outside to the substrate (Fig. 8a and b), i.e. there are no vertical tunnels, which agrees very well with the plane-view SEM images taken from Co-300 (Fig. 7a and b). A substrate-layer structure cannot be assigned to electro-oxidized steel X20CoCrWMo10-9 as can be seen from the SEM image achieved using a secondary detector (SESI, Fig. 8b) as well. It is reasonable to assume that this specific microstructure is caused during the electro-oxidation under harsh conditions. In deep contrast to sample Co-300, the cross section of sample Depos-30 exhibited a classical substrate-layer structure (Fig. 7c and d) with a sharp metal–ceramic transition (Fig. 8c) and an abrupt change in the composition of the material at the substrate-layer junction (Fig. 8c). Furthermore, the cracks seen in the plane-view images (Fig. 7e) could be confirmed (Fig. 8d) and definitely allow the electrolyte to access the bare metal during OER experiments which will certainly reduce the OER performance. The rapid change in the composition could indeed be confirmed by the EDS spectra recorded along the cross section of Depos-30 as well (Fig. S7, ESI†). In particular, the Fe and the Co contents were found to be rapidly decreased (increased) at the substrate-layer junction towards the surface of the specimen (Fig. S7e and f, ESI†). In the case of sample Co-300, the concentration of Co and O changed by ∼four times (seven times) along a distance of 8 μm towards the surface (Fig. S6b and d, ESI†), the classic substrate-layer structure of Depos-30 exhibited a change in the Co (O) concentration by three times (nine times) along a distance of only two μm towards the surface (Fig. S7b and e, ESI†).
 Fig. 8  SEM micrograph of a FIB machined cross section of sample Co-300 (a and b) and sample Depos-30, respectively (c and d). The rear wall of the trapezoidal trough is shown. This wall is orientated perpendicular to the surface of the specimen thus presenting a cross section of samples Co-300 and Depos-30. The accelerating voltage was adjusted to 10 kV and the SEM images were acquired using a secondary electron detector SESI (b and d) and energy selective backscattered detector ESB (a and c) respectively. Ion (Ga) beam settings: current: 240 pA, voltage: 10 kV, duration: 25 min. 
Thus, starting from the same steel-substrate the electro-oxidation-approach resulted in an intrinsic growth process in a composite material (Co-300) with a completely different microstructure and substantially better electrocatalytic OER properties than the electrodeposition approach (Depos-30) did.
OER properties in alkaline medium
Multiple pH characteristics of electrode materials will definitively support the widespread application of these materials. In addition to experiments performed under neutral conditions, we checked the suitability of surface oxidized X20CoCrWMo10-9 as an OER electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KOH as well (Fig. 9). Again, sample Co-300 showed superior oxygen evolution properties when compared to sample Co under both steady state and non-steady state conditions. The significant horizontal shift of the CV of sample Co-300 towards lower potentials by more than 300 mV relative to the CV of sample Co can be clearly seen in Fig. 9a. Sample Co-300 exhibited an impressive current density of 50 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE (Fig. 9a) that exceeded the current density/voltage ratio of electro-activated AISI 30426 and 316L steel58 and is superior to the OER performance of most catalysts recently developed.13,59 Outstanding current–voltage performance was proved in low potential regions as well: an ultralow overpotential <100 mV resulted in j = 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9a). Ni3S2 nanorods developed by Zhou et al. showed at η = 157 mV onset of OER.60 Data derived from chronopotentiometry measurements also confirmed that sample Co-300 is a fantastic OER electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KOH: the average overpotential amounted to 230 mV with 40 ks of OER at j = 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9b), whereas activated AISI 304 required η = 269.2 mV under the same conditions.26
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the electrochemical OER properties of sample Co with sample Co-300 and Ir/Ru in 0.1 M KOH. Electrode area of all samples: 2 cm2. (a) Cyclic voltammetric plots of sample Co/sample Co-300 at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. (b) Long term chronopotentiometry measurement of sample Co-300 and chronopotentiometry measurement of sample Co performed at 10 mA cm−2 current density. Average overpotential for the OER obtained through 40000 s plot: 230 mV (Co-300). Average overpotential for the OER obtained through 2000 s plot: 421 mV (Co). (c) Cyclic voltammetric plots of sample Co-300 and sample Ir/Ru at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. (d) Tafel plots of samples Co, Co-300 and Ir/Ru based on 200 second chronopotentiometry scans at current densities 0.65, 1.33, 2, 2.66, 4, 5.33, 6.66, 8, 10, 13.3, 16.6 and 20 mA cm−2. (e) Cyclic voltammetric plots of sample Co-300, Depos-30 and sample Co at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and 2 mV step size. 
As expected, sample Co-300 showed a much stronger current/voltage behavior compared to sample Ir/Ru at pH 13 (Fig. 9c and d). The Tafel line of Co-300 was found to be much steeper than the one of Ir/Ru or Co with a slope of 47.1 mV dec−1 in the lower overpotential region (Ir/Ru: 121.3 mV dec−1, Co: 57.3 mV dec−1). A dual Tafel behavior was obtained for the non-IR corrected data throughout the sample series Co-300, Co and Ir/Ru with slopes up to 429 mV dec−1 (Ir/Ru) in the higher potential region (Fig. 9d, red curve). However, to eliminate the influence of both electrolyte and electrode resistances on the Tafel behavior at pH 13, IR compensation of the ohmic voltage drop was also performed on these data as can be seen from Fig. S8 (ESI†). We corrected ohmic losses manually by subtracting the ohmic voltage drop from the measured potential on the basis of an electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) resistance of 2.5 Ω at a 0.5 mm electrode distance between RE and WE.47 The dual Tafel behavior was found to be less pronounced upon consideration of the ohmic losses but remained for all three samples Co-300, Co and Ir/Ru (Fig. S8, ESI† blue, red and black curve). The Tafel slopes of all samples were found to be significantly reduced in the higher overpotential region when compared to the corresponding slopes derived from non IR corrected data (Fig. 9d) and amounted to 137.7 mV dec−1 (Co-300), 334.6 mV dec−1 (Ir/Ru) and 148.9 (Co) (Fig. S8, ESI†). As expected, the influence of IR compensation on the Tafel behavior at lower potentials was weaker resulting in almost unchanged slopes determined for sample Co-300 (50.4 mV dec−1) and sample Ir/Ru (115.2 mV dec−1) and the same slope for sample Co (57.3 mV dec−1). The transition between the Tafel lines at lower and higher potential occurs for all samples before 10 mA cm−2 current density is achieved (Fig. S8, ESI†). As was suggested by Lyons et al.,48 the onset of diffusion limitation in the case of OER on iron electrodes should be at around 25 mA cm−2 current density in the diluted alkaline regime. We therefore claim that the dual Tafel behavior obtained by us based on IR corrected data of the electrocatalytically initiated OER at pH 13 on our samples is not due to increasingly limited mass transport at higher overpotentials. Furthermore, a change in the catalytically active species upon applying different potentials is to our understanding very unlikely and therefore the dual Tafel characteristics seen in Fig. S8 (ESI†) rather imply a different OER mechanism or a different rate-determining step for the OER at different overpotentials on the surface of Co-300. Lyons et al. reported cyclic voltammetric- and steady state studies of electrocatalytically initiated OER on fresh and altered Co electrodes in alkaline media.50 A slight dual Tafel behavior has been noticed for all Co electrodes investigated with slopes of 38–60 mV dec−1 in the lower overpotential region depending on the pretreatment and the concentration of the NaOH electrolyte used.50
Although sample Co-300 exhibited a sophisticated overall OER performance not only at pH 7, but also at pH 13, it turned out that via electrodeposition modified steel X20CoCrWMo10-9 (Depos-30) is substantially weaker in supporting OER at pH 13. Depos-30 was proven to be just slightly better than untreated steel X20CoCrWMo10-9 (sample Co), as can be seen in Fig. 9e, green curve.
Conclusions
The enlargement of the list of potential candidates suitable to efficiently and stably catalyze the anode half-cell reaction of the water splitting process is one of the most hotly contested subareas in “state of the art” energy science. Co3O4 has proven to be the most promising compound particularly when cleavage of water under neutral conditions is envisaged. Our efforts with regard to the generation of steel-based, outstandingly efficient, and stable OER electrocatalysts culminated in a composite consisting of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel and a Co-oxide based ceramic. We investigated the performance of this composite material for anodic water splitting at pH 7 and pH 13. The efficiency at pH 7 was found to be higher than that of any other material which has been tested by us ever and to the best of our knowledge it is substantially better than the capability of current noble- and non-noble OER electrocatalysts at pH 7 reported in the literature so far. In addition, the material exhibited better OER key values at pH 13 than highly active, surface modified AISI 304 steel which we reported recently.26 The outcome of our XPS and FTIR studies on this new material can be reasonably explained by the formation of a Co3O4 containing “outer zone” on top of the steel. By performing a FIB-SEM study we could however show that the existence of Co3O4 solely does not explain the outstanding OER properties of sample Co-300. The existence of a classical substrate-layer structure with a substantial demarcation between the periphery and the substrate, typically characteristic of the specimen achieved from electrodeposition based approaches (sample Depos-30) could not be proven in the case of sample Co-300. A metal–ceramic transition can hardly be defined and an abrupt change in the composition is completely suppressed by this intrinsic “from within itself” formation of the X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel//Co3O4 composite. This particular microstructure is likely responsible for the unusual OER efficiency at pH 7 and pH 13. Considering the fact that the applications of Co3O4 are by far not restricted to electrocatalysis, we believe that our new X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel//Co3O4 composite holds big promises in terms of most diverse applications.
Experimental section
Preparation of the Co-300 samples – electro oxidation of stainless steel at a constant potential
Samples with a total geometry of 70 × 10 × 1.5 mm were constructed from 1.5 mm thick X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel purchased from WST Werkzeug Stahl Center GmbH & Co. KG, D-90587 Veitsbronn-Siegelsdorf, Germany. Pre-treatment: prior to each surface modification the surface of the metal was cleaned intensively with ethanol and polished with grit 400 SiC sanding paper. Afterwards, the surface was rinsed intensively with deionized water and dried under air for 50 min at room temperature. The weight was determined using a precise balance (Sartorius 1712, 0.01 mg accuracy) prior to electro-activation. For the electro-oxidation, a two-electrode set-up was used consisting of the steel sample as the WE, and a platinum wire electrode (4 × 5 cm) used as the CE. The WE (anode) was immersed exactly 2.1 cm deep (around 4.8 cm2 geometric area), and the CE (cathode) was completely immersed into the electrolyte.
The electrolyte was prepared as follows: in a 330 mL glass beaker, 57.6 g (1.44 mol) of NaOH (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) were dissolved under stirring and under cooling in 195 g deionized water. The solution was allowed to cool down to 23 °C before usage. The anodization was performed in 200 mL of this electrolyte filled in a 300 mL glass beaker under stirring (450 r min−1) using a magnetic stirrer and a stirring bar (21 mm in length, 6 mm in diameter). The distance between WE and CE was adjusted to 6 mm. A power source (EA-PSI 8360-15T, Electra Automatic, Vierssen, Germany) which allows delivery of a constant high current for a longer operating time was used for the electrochemical oxidation. The procedure was carried out in current controlled mode. The current was set to 9 A according to ∼1875 mA cm−2 current density. The voltage was varied during the electro-activation. At the beginning of the experiment it amounted to around 7.5 V but was reduced over a period of 300 min to around 4.6 V. These data proved to be reliably reproducible for all 10 replicates. If, however, for some reason the decrease of the voltage is more abrupt, i.e. the voltage drops down to 4.6 V earlier, the activation procedure should be stopped when this value is reached. The electro-activation procedure should be stopped after 315 min at the latest. The temperature of the electrolyte increased within the first 30 min and reached a value of 323 K. Approximately 2.5 mL of fresh 6 M NaOH were added hourly to the electrolysis vessel in order to compensate for the loss due to evaporation. After 300 min of electro-activation the CE and the WE were taken out of the electrolyte and rinsed intensively with tap water for 15 min and then with deionized water for a further 10 min. The used NaOH electrolyte was transferred quantitatively into a plastic bottle and was stored for further analysis. The counter electrode, which was covered by a black layer, was immersed into 60 mL of 2 M HCl for 12 hours. The acidic solution was stored for further analysis. Prior to the electrochemical characterization the samples were dried under air at ambient temperature and the weight was determined using a precise balance as described above. The sample preparation was repeated ten times, i.e. in total 11 samples of Co-300 have been prepared this way. The electrolytes used in the 5 activation procedures have been investigated via ICP OES, see ESI.†
Preparation of Depos-30 samples
The substrate with a total geometry of 70 × 10 × 1.5 mm was constructed from 1.5 mm thick X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel. Pre-treatment: prior to each surface modification the surface of the metal was cleaned intensively with ethanol and polished with grit 800 SiC sanding paper. Afterwards, the surface was rinsed intensively with deionized water and dried under air for 50 min at room temperature. The substrate was coated using a two-step electrochemical approach consisting of (I) the electrodeposition of Co(OH)2 and (II) the electrochemical oxidation of Co(OH)2 to Co3O4. The electrodeposition of Co(OH)2 was performed similar to a protocol described in the literature by Jagadale et al.57
Electrochemical measurements
A three-electrode set-up was used for all electrochemical measurements. The working electrode (WE) with a total geometry of 70 × 10 × 1.5 mm was constructed from 1.5 mm thick X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel, on which an apparent surface area of 2 cm2 was defined by an insulating tape (Kapton tape). The IrO2–RuO2 sample (10 micrometer layer deposited on titanium) with a total geometry of 100 × 100 × 1.5 mm was purchased from Baoji Changli Special Metal Co, Baoji, China. An electrode area of 2 cm2 was defined on the plate by Kapton tape. To avoid additional contact resistance the plate was electrically connected using a screw. A platinum wire electrode (4 × 5 cm geometric area) was employed as the CE, a reversible hydrogen reference electrode (RHE, HydroFlex, Gaskatel Gesellschaft für Gassysteme durch Katalyse und Elektrochemie mbH. D-34127 Kassel, Germany) was utilized as the reference standard, and therefore all voltages were quoted against this reference electrode (RE). For all measurements the RE was placed between the working electrode and the CE. The measurements were performed in a 0.1 M KOH solution (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) and in a pH 7 corrected 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 solution (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) prepared as follows: aqueous solutions of 0.1 M K2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) were mixed until the resulting solution reached a pH value of 7.0. The distance between the WE and the RE was adjusted to 1 mm and the distance between the RE and the CE was adjusted to 4–5 mm. All electrochemical data were recorded digitally using a Potentiostat Interface 1000 from Gamry Instruments (Warminster, PA 18974, USA), which was interfaced to a personal computer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out without any correction of the ohmic voltage drop with the exception of the measurements on which the Tafel plots are based (Fig. S3 and S7, ESI†). We corrected ohmic losses within the chronopotentiometry plots manually by subtracting the ohmic voltage drop from the measured potential on the basis of electrolyte resistances reported in the literature.47 The resistances reported for a 10 mm RE–WE distance were corrected accordingly taking into consideration a different electrode geometry, i.e. a 0.5 mm distance between WE and RE. IR-corrected potentials are denoted as E-IR.
Cyclic Voltammograms (CV) were recorded in 90 mL of electrolyte (pH 7 corrected 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 and 0.1 M KOH) in a 100 mL glass beaker under stirring (450 r min−1) using a magnetic stirrer (21 mm stirring bar). The scan rate was set to 20 mV s−1 and the step size was 2 mV for all OER related CV measurements. The potential was cyclically varied between 1 and 1.9 V vs. RHE for OER measurements at pH 7 and between 1 and 1.7 V vs. RHE for OER measurements at pH 13.
Chronopotentiometry scans were conducted at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 90 mL of electrolyte for measuring periods <2000 s, and in 800 mL of electrolyte for measuring periods ≥40000 s, in 100 mL and 1000 mL glass beakers, respectively. The scans were recorded under stirring (450 r min−1) using a magnetic stirrer (25 mm stirring bar) for measuring periods <2000 s, and a magnetic stirrer (40 mm stirring bar) for measuring periods ≥40000 s.
Tafel plots
Average voltage values for the Tafel plots were derived from 200 second chronopotentiometry scans at current densities of 0.65, 1.33, 2, 2.66, 4, 5.33, 6.66, 8, 10, 13.3, 16.6 and 20 mA cm−2 for measurements carried out at pH 7 and pH 13. The arrangement of RE, WE and CE for recording the chronopotentiometry plots was as mentioned above (see paragraph Electrochemical measurements).
Determination of Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 2 and Table S2, ESI†) was carried out in close accordance with the procedure described by Schäfer et al. (Energy Envirnon. Sci., 2015, 8, 2685). The Faradaic efficiency of OER was calculated by determining the dependence of the oxygen concentration in the electrolyte during chronopotentiometry at constant current densities of 5 mA cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2 in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 solution under stirring. The distance between RE and WE was adjusted to 1 mm, and the distance between CE and RE was adjusted to ∼7 mm. The volume of electrolyte was 2300 mL. The working compartment was completely sealed with glass stoppers before starting chronopotentiometry at 0.07 mg O2 per L (j = 10 mA cm−2) and 0.06 mg O2 per L (j = 5 mA cm−2).
The results can be found in Fig. 2 and Table S2 (ESI†). The red line in Fig. 2b corresponds to 100% Faradaic efficiency with a line equation: Y = 7.20965 × 10−4x + 0.07 with y = dissolved oxygen (mg L−1); x = time (s) for the measurement performed at 10 mA cm−2. The red line in Fig. 2a corresponds to 100% Faradaic efficiency with a line equation: Y = 3.60483 × 10−4x + 0.06 with y = dissolved oxygen (mg L−1); x = time (s) for the measurement performed at 5 mA cm−2. The Faradaic efficiency amounted to 75.58% (10 mA cm−2) and 83.2% (5 mA cm−2) respectively.
XPS spectroscopy (samples Co-300-, Co)
The XPS instrument used for measurements was a Multilab 2000 (ThermoVG Scientific) using a Mg X-ray source for the incident X-rays. Experiments were conducted at room temperature under ultra high vacuum conditions. Samples were etched using an Ar beam to remove adventitious carbon from the surface. Co samples required 5–65 minutes of etching depending on the element detected. No argon etching was applied to Co-300 samples.
XPS spectroscopy (sample Depos-30)
XPS measurements were performed using a Phoibos HSA 150 hemispherical analyzer equipped with a standard Al Kα source with a 0.3 eV full width at half-maximum. The measurements were recorded with the samples at room temperature. The spectra were calibrated using the carbon 1s line of adsorbed carbon (EB = 285.0 eV).
FTIR spectroscopy
IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 equipped with the ATR system, Golden Gate. For the preparation of the powder, sample Co-300 was ground by using grit 800 sanding paper till the black outer zone was completely removed from the specimen. The sanding paper loaded with the material was subsequently put into double distilled water and the powder removed from the sanding paper by ultrasonication. The water was evaporated.
Electron microscopy
The plane-view SEM images of samples Co-300 and Depos-30 were taken using a Zeiss Auriga scanning electron microscope.
Cross sectional analysis (vertical plane imaging) of samples was realized by a dual beam FIB (focused ion beam)-SEM technique. The SEM images of the cross sections were taken using a Zeiss Auriga scanning electron microscope equipped with a Cobra FIB-column and a Ga ion source using the Feature Milling software module for modeling. The accelerating voltage was adjusted to 10 kV and the SEM images were acquired using a secondary electron- or back scatter detector.
AFM experiments
AFM measurements were performed in semi-contact mode on a NT-MDT model NTEGRA Probe NanoLaboratory. The V-shaped cantilevers had nominal lengths of 140 μm, force constants of 25–95 N m−1, and a resonance frequency of 242 kHz (within the range of 200–400 kHz). The tip radius was 10 nm. The AFM images were processed by using the software Nova Px.
Gas sorption
Gas sorption experiments (adsorption/desorption) were carried out using a Quantachrome Autosorb AS-1C. Physisorption was determined at 77 K and 100 K for N2 (Linde Gas, purity >99.999%) with dynamic p0-determination using a p0-cell at p = 760 mmHg and an Oxford Instruments cryostat model Optistat MK1 equipped with an Oxford Instruments controller model ITC 503. The analyses and interpretation of data were carried out utilizing the Quantachrome AS1Win software package, version 2.11. Prior to the determination, the samples were activated at 100 °C and pressures of 1 × 10−6 mbar for 10 h (sample Co) and 1.5 × 10−9 mbar for 22 h (sample Co-300). All samples were treated in the outgas station until outgassing rates were below 3 microns per minute pressure increase and subsequently contacted with He (Linde Gas, purity >99.999%) before the analyses were carried out. An equilibration time of 10 min per analysis point was used and ten points were recorded each for adsorption and desorption.

Broader context
The exploration of promising renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources for the future, capable for implementing the urgent replacement of fossil fuels, is one of the significant challenges for scientists and engineers concerned with research on energy issues. The implementation of a hydrogen economy is seen as the mainstay for the reorganization of our current energy sector. Electrocatalytically initiated splitting of water realized using solar energy is considered to be the most promising route for the large-scale production of hydrogen fuel. It is well known that the effectiveness of this attractive solar to fuel conversion route is severely restricted by the high overpotentials caused by commonly used electrode materials on the anode side. This is particularly true when the electrochemical cleavage of water is carried out at neutral pH. The scarcity of oxygen-evolving catalysts that are inexpensive, stable, based on earth-abundant elements, easy to fabricate in large areas and highly active under neutral conditions is a serious obstacle. Our efforts regarding the generation of steel-based electrocatalysts culminated in a composite consisting of X20CoCrWMo10-9 steel and a Co-oxide based ceramic which proved to be outstandingly efficient for the anodic conversion of water into oxygen in the neutral regime.
