    , Accepted 2nd November 2022First published on 2nd November 2022AbstractUltrafast dynamics of tetracene molecules in THF solution were investigated using sub-8 fs ultraviolet pulse lasers and ab initio calculations. The time trace of absorbance changes exhibited ultrafast decay with a time constant of 165 ± 10 fs because of the relaxation from a vibronically hot excited state to the potential minimum in the S1 state. From the signals of absorbance changes in the negative time region, we obtained the electronic dephasing time of 31.27 ± 1.63 fs. Inverse Fourier transform of stationary absorption spectra exhibited rapid decay with 2.1 ± 0.08 fs. From these data, we estimated the ratio of total dephasing time to homogenous and inhomogeneous broadening as 6.7% and 93.3%, respectively. Impulsive Raman spectra reflect the wave packet dynamics of vibrational modes. Although inhomogeneous broadening blurred the phase jump across the resonance peak in the spectral range, 1156 and 1680 cm−1 vibrational modes exhibited a phase jump from −π to ∼π and −0.5π to ∼0.5π, respectively. The amplitude profiles of these vibrational modes agree with simulated vibronic progressions of combination bands. Time–frequency analysis revealed coupling dynamics between low- and high-frequency modes, where high-frequency modes are in-plane motions and low-frequency modes are out-of-plane motions. Therefore, these coupling dynamics induce symmetry-breaking of the molecular framework, which fastens the singlet fission process.
1. Introduction
With the recent development of replacing silicon with organic/inorganic materials, solar cells have progressed rapidly.1–11 Many materials such as organic blend polymers3 and perovskites4 have been proposed and investigated for high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability at low cost. Recently, PCEs of organic thin films5 and perovskite6 have exceeded 18% and 25%, respectively, reaching the Shockley–Queisser limit (33%) in single-junction devices.12 In this context, singlet fission material is one of the candidates to achieve PCE of more than 40% in single-junction cells.7–11
Singlet fission is a process in which a molecule in the S1 state transfers excess energy to a neighbouring molecule in the S0 state after photoexcitation, resulting in the formation of a triplet pair, which then dissipates as electrons and holes or is annihilated.13–15 Because singlet fission can create a multi-exciton state from a single photon, singlet fission materials will exhibit very high PCE when used in solar cells. External quantum efficiency above 100% and internal energy conversion of up to 200% have already been reported for singlet fission solar cells.16,17
Acenes are well known for showing singlet fission,13–18 and since the first report of singlet fission in anthracene crystals in 1965,18 many experimental and theoretical studies have been reported.13–43 The energy relation E(S1) ≥ 2E(T1) is a minimum requirement for singlet fission. In pentacene and rubrene with the energy relation of E(S1) ≥ 2E(T1), singlet fission occurs on a time scale of a few femtoseconds by efficiently converting the excess energy to produce singlet fission. However, tetracene, which has E(S1) less than 2E(T1) by approximately 0.2 eV, exhibits both singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation.21,22 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the singlet fission in tetracene, including the contribution of high energy levels in the S0 state,22 hot bands in the S1 state,22 entropy effects23 and vibronic coupling.21 Experimentally, tetracene and its derivatives, including monomers in solutions, thin films and crystals, have been investigated using resonance Raman spectroscopy,19 time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy,23–26,29,31,34,42–44 transient absorption spectroscopy,26,30–32,36,44–48 two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy28 and impulsive Raman spectroscopy.40 From these, it is a common insight that the contribution of molecular vibrations is important; for example, the multiple pulse excitation at 275 fs intervals improved the singlet fission yield by approximately 20%,35 and resonance Raman experiments have also suggested that high and low frequency vibrational modes couple during internal conversion.19 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports that directly observe the vibronically hot states in the S1 state in tetracene with the ultrashort time scale after photoexcitation.
We have constructed sub-8 fs pulse laser in the ultraviolet (UV) region and used them in pump–probe experiments.49–51 In addition, with the advance of ab initio calculations, it has become easier to interpret the experimental evidence by theoretical simulations.
Here, we show the ultrafast spectroscopy of tetracene in Tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution using a sub-8 fs UV pulse laser, along with ab initio calculations, to reveal the ultrafast dynamics of tetracene molecules in vibronically hot states in the S1 state.
2. Experimental
The experimental details have been described in previous studies.49–51 The outputs of the regenerative amplifier system (800 nm, 2.5 mJ and 25 fs, Legend Elite, Coherent Inc.) were used to generate 400 nm pulses by the second-harmonic generation in a BBO crystal. The 400 nm pulses were guided to the Ar-filled hollow core fibre (length: 60 cm, Ar pressure: 0.8 atm) to broaden the spectra. The output pulse width was reduced to ∼7.5 fs using a pulse compressor system composed of a prism pair and a grating-deformable mirror system.50 The ultrashort UV pulses were divided into pump and probe pulses to perform ultrafast spectroscopy, keeping the stability over 3 hours.49–51 The delay time between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a 10 nm-resolution feedback stage (FS-1020X, Sigma Tech, Inc.). Both pump and probe pulses were focused on the sample with pulse energies of 36 and 3.6 nJ, respectively. The transmitted probe pulse was spectrally dispersed using a polychromator (SpectraPro2300i, Acton Research, Inc.) and guided to the 128-channel lock-in amplifier system (7210/90, Ametek Inc.) through a custom-made 128-bundle fibre (Fiber Tech Optica, Inc.). The spectral range used in this study was 359–440 nm (corresponding to the photon energy range of 2.82–3.45 eV with a resolution of ∼1.5 nm).
A commercially available tetracene sample (sublimed grade, Sigma-Aldrich Inc) was used without purification. The tetracene was dissolved in THF solution (0.65 mM). The sample was measured with 1 mm thick cell. Stationary absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using an absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-3101PC) and a fluorophotometer (Hitachi, F-4500), respectively.
Time-dependent density functional theory calculations of tetracene molecules have been performed in the BMK/aug-cc-pvdz level with a polarised continuum model in THF solution using the Gaussian16 package.52
3. Results and discussion.
3.1 Stationary absorption spectra of tetracene

Fig. 1 shows the stationary absorption spectra of tetracene in THF solution. The absorption peak at 0–0 transition from the S0 (1A1g) to S1 (1B2u) states appears at 2.62 eV. In the photon energy range overlapped with the laser spectra, the maximum absorbance is 0.9 at 2.97 eV in this study. The discrete vibronic progressions appear at 2.80, 2.97 and 3.13 eV. The energy differences between neighbour double bands are 0.177 eV (1428 cm−1), 0.174 eV (1404 cm−1) and 0.161 eV (1301 cm−1). The peaks corresponding to the transitions from the S0 (1A1g) to S2 (1B1g) states appear above 3.3 eV, overlapping with the higher vibronic states in the S1 state.

The simulated stationary absorption spectra(black dot) and fluorescence spectra(blue dot) due to TDDFT calculations. Laser spectra (red line). All spectra are normalised. The molecular structure of tetracene is displayed in the inset of the figure. 
The fluorescence spectra also exhibit vibronic progressions with the mirror symmetry to the absorption spectra. The energy difference of 0–0 transition peaks between absorption and fluorescence spectra is 68 meV, indicating that the Stokes shift due to the solvation is considerably small.
The TD-DFT calculation (black dot line) without scaling reproduces the stationary absorption spectra well.64 The energy difference in the 0–0 transition between the experiment and theory is 70 meV. The assignment of the composed vibrational modes in the vibronic spectra is described in the theoretical section in detail. The simulated fluorescence spectra also reproduces the experimental results well. In that sense, the excited state dynamics such as mode mixing during the transition and reorganization due to solvent can be described well. Therefore, we concluded that the theoretical calculation level and basis set used in this study is valid.
The laser spectra (red line) used in this study are also depicted in Fig. 1. We observed the ultrafast dynamics of tetracene molecules with higher vibronically excited states in the S1 state.
3.2 
          Ab initio calculations of tetracene molecules
Before analysing the results of the impulsive Raman study of tetracene, we would like to introduce the quantum chemical calculation results. DFT calculations of tetracene molecules in THF solution have been performed to clarify the vibronic coupling in the S0–S1 transition.
Natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis was performed for the S0–S1 transition in tetracene.62 NTOs provide a compact and state-specific description of the excitation. The morphology of the NTO pair in the transition is depicted in Fig. 2(a). It is found that the NTOs are almost composed of HOMO/LUMO orbitals (>98%). The nodes exist in-plane and parallel to the short axis in the plane of tetracene in both hole and electron NTOs, showing the π → π* character in the transition from the S0 to S1 states.15

Tetracene has 84 vibrational modes, and because of the highly symmetric D2h structure, the vibrational modes exhibit infrared (IR)-Raman alternative selection rules. Frequency analysis of tetracene in the S0 and S1 states in THF solution has been performed. All vibrational modes are listed in the ESI.† Raman spectra of tetracene in the S0 and S1 states without scaling are shown in Fig. 2(b) (IR spectra are depicted in ESI†). The spectra computed by DFT are simply the off-resonant Raman spectra,not resonance Raman. Raman signals appear at 317, 501, 765, 1016, 1190, 1223, 1425, 1471, 1593 and 1670 cm−1 in the S0 state, whereas they appear at 314, 882, 1047, 1238, 1400, 1451, 1546 and 1593 cm−1 in the S1 state. These modes belong to the total symmetric Ag character in the D2h point group, except 501, 1190 and 1670 cm−1 belonging to B3g. Using these data, we can generate vibronic absorption spectra and resonance Raman spectra.
The transition dipole moments can be expanded in the Taylor expansions, as follows: (1)
The truncation only to the first term is called Franck–Condon (FC) approximation, and the case including the second term is Hertzberg–Teller (HT) approximation. Because the HT effect appears in acenes24,27 and the highly symmetric molecules,63 we calculated and compared both the FC and FCHT approximations through the simulation of vibronic spectra and simulated resonance Raman spectra.

Fig. 3(a) shows vibronic spectra with the FC and FCHT approximations. For the comparison, the photon energies of 0-0 transition and its intensities in the simulated vibronic spectra with FC and FCHT approximations are scaled to the experimental data. The transition intensities in the vibronic progression are slightly different between the FC and FCHT approximations. The intensity of the 0–0 transition is slightly higher in the FCHT approximation than in the FC approximation, but others show a reverse relation. The transition energies are the same as expected. Fig. 3(b) shows resonance Raman spectra at an incident photon energy of 3.13 eV, which is a similar condition to the resonance Raman spectroscopy of tetracene, except for the solvent.19 From the figure, the resonance Raman spectra in the FCHT approximation appear at 504, 1192 and 1672 cm−1, whereas these are not observed in the FC approximation. These modes belong to B3g symmetry and are experimentally observed in resonance Raman spectroscopy,19 indicating that the FCHT approximation is appropriate in the transition from the S0 to S1 states in tetracene.

The vibronic spectrum with the FCHT approximation was simulated by the convolution of the Gaussian distributions of the vibronic progressions with full width at half maximum bandwidth of 135 cm−1 at 300 K.64 Because the simulated vibronic spectra reproduce experimentally observed stationary absorption spectra well, we focus on the vibronic progressions obtained from ab initio calculations. The vibronic progressions with their transition energies and intensities are shown as the stick bars in the simulated vibronic spectrum (Fig. 4(a)). There are two typical peaks centred at 2.90 and 3.09 eV in the simulated stationary absorption spectrum. The top seven transitions from the highest intensity at each peak are listed in Table 1. The labels of |i〉 and |i′〉 (i and i′ correspond to the vibrational mode number in the Sp0 and S1 states, respectively) are used to label the vibrational modes listed in ESI.† High-frequency Raman active vibrational modes such as |59′〉, |62′〉, |66′〉, |68′〉 and |70′〉 (corresponding to 1403, 1451, 1510, 1546 and 1593 cm−1, respectively) exhibit the combination bands in both peaks. Low-frequency vibrational modes such as |1′〉 and |2′〉 (corresponding to 47 and 81 cm−1, respectively) can couple these combination bands with their hot bands depending on the population at the temperature. Comparing the two peaks at 2.90 and 3.09 eV, there are two combinations of high-frequency modes at the 2.90 eV peak, for example, |0〉 → |62′〉1|59′〉1 transition at 2.902 eV. Meanwhile, there are three combinations at the 3.09 eV peak, such as |0〉 → |62'〉2|59'〉1 at 3.0759 eV. According to previous studies, these vibrational progressions in the stationary absorption spectra are simple overtones of a single vibrational mode.19,25,30 However, our simulation indicates that the complex combination bands are involved in the stationary absorption spectra.

The differences in the location of the minimum and the curvature of the potential energy surface between the S0 and S1 states induce the displacement and rotation of the coordinates of normal modes. These are described as the shift vector and Duschinsky matrix.64 The vibrational modes with large shift vectors are listed in Table 2. The shift vector is the geometry shift (displacement) from initial to final state equilibrium geometries expressed in the mass-weighted normal coordinates of the initial state (the dimension is , where me is the electron mass). Huang–Rhys factors Si of the i-th vibrational mode ωi is related to the shift vector Δi as Si = ωi/2Δi2. The reorganisation energy λi was calculated using Huang–Rhys factors (Si = λi/ħωi). These values are almost consistent with the previous resonance Raman study.19

Fig. 4(b) shows the contour map of the Duschinsky matrix. The index in the bottom is the initial (ground) state, and the left corresponds to the vibrational modes in the electronically excited state. The order of vibrational modes depends on the vibrational frequency. The off-diagonal peaks in the figure indicate that the order of vibrational modes is changed or that mode mixing among vibrational modes occurs during the transition. The typical diagonal and off-diagonal contents of the Duschinsky matrix are listed in ESI.† As mentioned before, the mode mixing happens due to the displacement (shift vector) and rotation of the coordinates (Duschinsky matrix). To evaluate the contribution of Duschinsky matrix in the mode mixing, we simulated the vibronic spectra with and without Duschinsky matrix (Fig. S3, ESI†). The overall shape of absorption spectra can be reproduced well even without Duschinsky matrix. Comparing the simulated results, we found that the simulated spectra without Duschinsky matrix overestimates the intensity distributions above 0–0 transition rather than the spectra with Duschinsky matrix. Anyway, we concluded the mode mixing happens mainly due to the large displacement (shift vector). These induce the combination bands that appear in the simulated stationary absorption spectra.
3.3 Ultrafast spectroscopy of tetracene in THF solution

3.3.1 Excited state dynamics of tetracene in the positive time range. 

Fig. 5(a) displays 2D transient absorption spectra ΔA(ω,t) of tetracene molecules. The time traces of ΔA at probe photon energies of 2.968, 3.029, 3.134 and 3.319 eV and ΔA at delay times of 200, 500 and 1000 fs were depicted in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. From the figure, ΔA(ω,t) has a negative value because of photobleach in mostly the entire spectral domain in the positive time regime.
 Fig. 5  (a) Two-dimensional display of ΔA(ω,t). Horizontal and vertical axes correspond to the probe photon energy and delay time, respectively. The colour represents ΔA. (b) Real-time trace of ΔA(ω,t) with photon energy at 2.968 (black), 3.029 (blue), 3.134 (red), and 3.319 (green). The exponential fitting with time constant of 165 fs is plotted (orange). (c) Time-resolved ΔA(ω,t) with the delay time of 200 (black), 500 (red) and 1000 fs (blue). 
However, around the 3.13 eV peak, we found a rapid decay in the time trace of ΔA(ω,t). To analyse the dynamics, we fitted ΔA(ω,t) with a single exponential decay (ΔA(ω,t) = A × exp(−t/τ) + c, c: constant). The resultant photon energy dependence of the time constants and their coefficients (A and c) are depicted in Fig. 6(a). Both time constants and their coefficients sensitively depend on the photon energy because of the damping effect due to vibronic coupling. The constant of the decay component (A) shows zero at the photon energy of 3.134 eV. Considering the photon energy region above 3.134 eV, the probe photon energy dependence of A is similar to that of time constants. At 3.159 eV, the absolute value of A becomes maximum and its time constant shows 165 fs. When we see the time constants in the photon energy region below 3.134 eV, it also shows 165 fs at the same absolute value of A. Therefore, benefiting from a large signal size and long-time constant, the time constant of rapid decay could be determined as 165 ± 10 fs with reasonable precision.
 Fig. 6  (a) Probe photon energy dependence of the fitting results with single exponential decay to ΔA(ω,t). The coefficients of decay (A) and constant (c) components (black and green, respectively) and time constants (blue) are shown with respect to the photon energy. The error bars are included. (b) Decay-associated spectra. The fast and slow decay components (black and blue, respectively) with respect to the photon energy are shown. The reverse of stationary absorption spectra is also shown (red). 
Based on this value, the global fitting to the experimental data with a single exponential decay, along with a constant, was applied, and the decay-associated spectra (DAS) were reconstructed (Fig. 6(b)). The fast decay component in DAS shows first derivative-like spectra peaked at 3.13 eV in the stationary absorption spectra. It is possible that the negative ΔA observed in this study is due to stimulated emission from higher lying state to lower state, not S1–S0 state as observed in fluorescence spectra. However as can be seen the DAS spectra of 165 fs component, the spectral shape seems first derivative like of stationary absorption spectra. From this, we concluded that the rapid decay with a time constant of 165 fs is due to the relaxation from hot vibronic states to the potential minimum in the S1 state. Ab initio calculation indicated that the maximum overlap in Franck–Condon happens at photon energy of 2.87 eV (70 meV is added to the theoretical value). Therefore, the photon energy region in this study is above FC region. The density of state of vibrational manifolds in S0 state is less effective in this higher energy region. And also, the effect due to S2 state is less because the photon energy is low enough. Additionally, as seen in Fig. 1, the solvation is quite small, indicating that the interaction between tetracene and its surrounding THF molecules is small. Therefore, we could find the vibronically not cooling state with long lifetime with 165 fs in hot S1 state. The same kind of relaxation in the S1 state has been reported previously.53,54 The other vibronic states such as the 2.97 eV peak in the stationary absorption spectra are thought to relax faster than 50 fs because we could not analyse the data due to the strong coherent artefact in regions shorter than 50 fs. The constant component spectra in DAS show the reversed shape of the stationary absorption spectra, but the bandwidth is significantly broader than that of the stationary absorption spectra. This spectral difference indicates that the vibronically hot states are created in the S1 state after photoexcitation.


3.3.2 Electronic dephasing dynamics of tetracene molecules in solution. 
In the ‘negative’ time region (probe pulse precedes pump pulse) in the transient absorption spectra, the polarisation created by the probe pulse is kicked to the pump laser fields. This process is called a perturbed free-induction decay (PFID),55–57 and we reported the extended interpretations of PFID when using few-cycle pulses.58–61 In these reports, we mentioned that because the pulse duration of the laser pulse is sufficiently short compared with both electronic dephasing time and molecular vibrational periods, the observed electronic dephasing time is not entirely electronic but a vibronic dephasing time.
The PFID in the two-level system is described as follows:56 (2)where T2 represents the effective dephasing time and  represents the peak photon energy of hole burning. By modulating PFID based on molecular vibration, eqn (2) can be modified as follows, (3)here, the modulation due to the molecular vibrational mode with frequency  and initial phase ϕ is considered. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show PFID spectra with the electronic dephasing time T2 of 50, 20 and 10 fs, with/without modulation due to the molecular vibration of 150 cm−1 with 0.5π. The spectra show hyperbolic features, which are typical in PFID. However, the feature seems less effective when T2 decreases. Typical features in vibronic PFID include a signal exhibiting oscillations because of the molecular vibrations with node and reverse signs in the time trace, in addition to the hyperbolic feature of PFID.
 Fig. 7  (a) 2D simulated PFID. Horizontal and vertical axes correspond to the probe photon energy and delay time, respectively. The electronic dephasing times used in the simulation are 50, 20 and 10 fs, respectively, from the left to right in the panel. (b) Simulated PFID spectra with the modulation of molecular vibration (ωv = 150 cm−1, ϕ = π/2). The electronic dephasing times are the same as (a). 
ΔA(ω,t) signals in the negative time region (Fig. 5(a)) with the photon energy region of ∼3.0–3.4 eV exhibit hyperbolic features. By fitting ΔA(ω,t) signals with a convolution between instrument function assuming a Gaussian distribution with 7.5 fs FWHM and a single exponential decay function (see ESI†), the photon energy dependence of the vibronic dephasing time is obtained (Fig. 8(a)). The dephasing time is not a constant but a structured feature. Because of the modulation due to molecular vibrations and overlapping of the PFID signals originating from consecutive peaks, the vibronic dephasing time does not remain constant in the entire spectral range. However around the peak at 3.33 eV, the electronic dephasing time shows almost constant within error bar and longest dephasing time. Therefore, we determined the electronic dephasing from the average value, 31.27 ± 1.63 fs.

The dephasing rate 1/Te2 is composed of three components, as follows: (4)where Te1 represents the population decay term, and  and  represent the pure electronic dephasing time and electronic phase relaxation time due to the inhomogeneous broadening, respectively. For simplicity, we estimated  to be significantly longer than the other time constants from the significantly broader electronic spectrum of the ground state, i.e.. From the analysis of the time trace of ΔA(ω,t) in the negative time region, we determined Te2 as 31.27 fs. From the time trace of ΔA(ω,t) in the positive time region, population decay from the S1 to S0 states is longer than 1.8 ps, which is the longest delay time in this study. Therefore, we estimated the pure dephasing time to be  using eqn (4).

Fig. 8(b) shows the inverse Fourier transform of stationary absorption spectra of tetracene. It shows a damping oscillator with a peak at 24.3 fs (corresponding to the molecular vibration of 1430 cm−1). By fitting the single exponential decay to the rapid decay component in the spectra, the total (homogenous + inhomogeneous) dephasing time is determined as 2.1 ± 0.08 fs. From these electronic dephasing times, the contributions from homogenous and inhomogeneous dephasing to the total dephasing time are 6.7% and 93.3%, respectively.


3.3.3 Wave packet dynamics of tetracene in THF solution. 
Two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) power spectra of ΔA(ω,t) spectra are shown in Fig. 9(a). In FFT, we used a Blackman window to ΔA(ω,t) spectra in the time range from 50 fs to 1800 fs with zero padding of 2.13 The FFT power spectra at photon energies of 2.96 and 3.13 eV are shown in Fig. 9(b). The vibrational modes with 317, 545, 740, 1034, 1156, 1217, 1347, 1408, 1505 and 1680 cm−1 appeared with the precision of 4 cm−1. The strong peak at 915 cm−1 is due to THF solution(labelled with asterisk). These values are consistent with the simulated Raman spectra. Especially, 545, 1156 and 1680 cm−1 corresponding to 504, 1192 and 1672 cm−1, respectively, in simulated resonance Raman spectra with the FCHT approximation are found. This indicates that the impulsive Raman spectroscopy of tetracene directly observes the FCHT effect. And also, these vibrational modes are consistent with the simulated vibrational mode in S0 state(see ESI†). These are reasonable because ΔA(ω,t) shows negative value due to photobleach.

The dynamics of wave packets in the ground state and/or excited state induced by ultrashort pulses are reflected in the probe photon energy dependence of the amplitude and phase of the vibrational modes.65–69 However, the ambiguity of the estimated phase is significant in low-frequency vibrational modes. For example, if the period of 317 cm−1 is 94.6 fs and the observed time range in this study is 1.8 ps, the accuracy of the phase becomes as large as 0.1π even with relatively high precision. Therefore, we analysed only high-frequency modes.
The ideal photon energy dependence of amplitude and phase exhibits a dip at the resonance position in the amplitude profile with a phase jump of π or 2π depending on the wave packets created in the ground state or excited state.65,66 This feature has been observed in experiments.67–74 However, as the contribution of inhomogeneous broadening increases, the dip in amplitude disappears and the phase jump blurs or shifts.65,66 In this study, because we mentioned in Section 3.3.2 that the contribution of inhomogeneous broadening is sufficient, several vibrational modes such as 1217, 1347 and 1408 cm−1 do not exhibit a clear phase jump. Only 1156 and 1680 cm−1 exhibit a phase jump around the 2.96 and 3.13 eV peaks in the stationary absorption spectra, respectively (Fig. 10). The amplitude profiles show a peak and phase change from −π to ∼π and −0.5π to ∼0.5π in the 1156 and 1680 cm−1 vibrational modes, respectively, at around the 2.96 eV peak. Indeed, the amplitude profile does not exhibit a dip at the peak position. However, when we extract the combination bands involving |48′〉 and |70′〉 modes for 1156 and 1680 cm−1, respectively, from the simulated vibronic transition tables, as shown in the bottom panel in Fig. 10, they seem consistent with the experimentally observed amplitude profiles. The theoretical models described by Kumar et al. in ref. 65 and 66 come from a line shape function with a single vibrational mode with damping factors. Although it can be extended to multi-mode cases, it does not consider mode-mixing dynamics. Meanwhile, at the 3.13 eV peak, 1156 cm−1 exhibits a constant phase across the peak, indicating its off-resonance nature. The 1680 cm−1 vibrational mode exhibits the same resonance feature as that at 2.96 eV.

3.3.4 Mode coupling dynamics in tetracene. 
Time-frequency analysis of transient absorption spectra reveals the vibrational dynamics in real time. Spectrogram analysis has been done with the condition of a time step of 10 fs, Blackmann window of 280 fs FWHM window width and zero padding of 2.13Fig. 11(a) depicts spectrograms of ΔA(ω,t) at the photon energy of 2.96, 3.13 and 3.30 eV. To obtain the dynamic information in detail, peak tracking analysis was applied to high-frequency vibrational modes such as 1240 and 1400 cm−1 at 2.96 eV, 1370 cm−1 at 3.13 eV and 1230 and 1470 cm−1 at 3.30 eV. Although the instantaneous frequency is almost constant even when tracking the maximum intensity, the time trace of the instantaneous intensity of each vibrational mode at each photon energy shows oscillation (Fig. 11(b)). To clarify the modulation component, FFT was applied (Fig. 11(c)). The 1240 and 1400 cm−1 vibrational modes at 2.96 eV exhibit modulation values of 37, 98 and 160 cm−1 and 58, 98 and 160 cm−1, respectively; 1370 cm−1 at 3.13 eV exhibits modulation frequencies of 55 cm−1 and 1230 and 1470 cm−1 at 3.30 eV exhibit modulation values of 48 and 85 cm−1 and 78 cm−1, respectively. These low-frequency modes agree well with ab initio calculations. In addition, these are consistent with the simulated vibronic transition, i.e. the transition table involves the coupling of high- and low-frequency modes (see Table 1). Interestingly, although high-frequency modes considered here show in-plane motion, these low vibrational modes represent out-of-plane motions (see ESI†). Therefore, the coupling between low and high frequency modes induces symmetry-breaking behaviour during the relaxation process. This symmetry-breaking behaviour is a key factor in singlet fission materials to accelerate the fission dynamics.75

Fig. 12 shows the spectrograms of ΔA(ω,t) in negative times at 2.96, 3.13 and 3.30 eV. From these spectra, we also found both low and high vibrational modes such as 317 and 1250 cm−1, along with the electronic dephasing time in tetracene. Because the PFID process is a non-rephasing process in the electronically excited state, these vibrational coupling dynamics reflect the excited state dynamics, particularly dephasing dynamics.

4. Conclusions
Ultrafast dynamics of tetracene molecules in THF solution have been investigated using sub-8 fs UV pulse lasers. The time trace of absorbance changes exhibited an ultrafast decay component with a time constant of 165 ± 10 fs around a photon energy of 3.13 eV due to the relaxation from the vibronically hot excited state to the potential minimum in the S1 state. By global fitting with 165 fs to create DAS, the fast component in DAS exhibited first derivative-like spectra of stationary absorption spectra. The slow component showed the reverse shape of the stationary absorption spectra with significantly broader bandwidth due to the hot band after photoexcitation. The electronic dephasing time derived from the absorbance change data in the negative time region could be estimated to be 31.27 ± 1.63 fs. Inverse Fourier transform of stationary absorption spectra showed rapid decay with a 2.1 ± 0.08 fs time constant with 24.3 fs period (1430 cm−1) oscillation. From these data, because the population decay time in the S1 state is sufficiently long, we estimated the ratio of total dephasing time to homogenous and inhomogeneous broadening as 6.7% and 93.3%, respectively. Impulsive Raman spectra reflect the wave packet dynamics of vibrational modes. Although the inhomogeneous broadening obscured the phase jump across the resonance peak, the 1156 and 1680 cm−1 vibrational modes exhibited a phase jump from about −π to ∼π and −0.5π to ∼0.5π, respectively. The amplitude profiles of these vibrational modes did not exhibit any typical dip at the resonance position; however, the experimental results were accurately reproduced by the simulated vibronic progressions that generated combination bands in the stationary absorption spectra. Time-frequency analysis by spectrograms revealed coupling dynamics between low and high frequency modes. The high frequency modes were in-plane motions, whereas the low frequency modes were out-of-plane motions. Therefore, these coupling dynamics induced symmetry-breaking motion that could accelerate the singlet fission process.
Complementary to the experimental findings, ab initio calculations were also performed in this study. Vibronic spectra and resonance Raman spectra of tetracene molecules in THF solution could be reproduced well with high accuracy. For high accuracy, precise coupling dynamics were discussed, particularly mode mixing during the transition. Because the experimental absorption spectra exhibited broad bandwidth, the precise transition could not be observed. Thus, precise simulations facilitate correct interpretation.
Many interesting findings in the ultrafast spectroscopy of tetracene in THF solution were clarified. Crystals and/or thin films of tetracene will be investigated with this system in future studies.
