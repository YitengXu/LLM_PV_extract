    , Accepted 1st February 2021First published on 1st February 2021AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been widely developed to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The highest PCE has reached over 18% in binary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) NFA-OSCs, approaching the threshold for commercial applications, while the most stable NFA-OSCs have been inferred with a potential lifetime of 22 years. The instability of NFA-OSCs has not been paid enough attention and becomes one of the major barriers to their commercialization. Herein, we present a systematic discussion on degradation mechanisms of NFA-OSCs, in which we focused on the fundamentals of instability in NFA-OSCs, including photo-oxidation, morphology instability, and interlayer induced instability. Meanwhile, the recent progress and promising strategies to improve the stability of NFA-OSCs are presented in the themes of their molecular design, a third component in the blend film and passivation of the interlayer. We believe that a study on their stability should be the next focus in the field of NFA-OSCs.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted substantial attention over the past 20 years, owing to their advantages of light weight, flexibility, and semitransparency.1–4 Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been widely studied in recent years for their unique advantages like abundant chemical structures, tunable energy levels, light-harvesting properties, and easy solution-processing, which make NFAs one of the most popular materials in the OSC field.1,2,5 A rapid enhancement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) has been achieved (17–18%) in NFA-OSCs.6–10 However, the instability of high performance NFA-OSCs remains the major barrier toward commercialization of OSCs nowadays.11–13 NFAs with diverse chemical structures show various reactive sites and aggregation behaviours in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films, causing difficulties and challenges to investigate the degradation mechanisms and strategies for high-stability NFA-OSCs.14,15 Although a few studies have demonstrated the device lifetime up to several years under constant illumination, the intrinsic mechanisms are still needed to be shed light on.16,17
Studies on degradation mechanisms and strategies to improve the stability of NFA-OSCs have attracted more and more attention in past years.15,18 The inherent instability of NFA materials is one of the major obstacles to realize the long term stability of NFA-OSCs.12 Several studies have been dedicated to illustrating the degradation mechanisms of NFA-OSCs, mainly focusing on the photo-oxidation process of NFAs,19–21 thermodynamically stable morphology of blend films,22–25 and the interaction between the active layer and interfacial layer.26–29 Some research revealed that the reaction between NFAs and oxygen/interlayer can damage the conjugated structures of NFAs and form charge traps in blend films, resulting in enhanced exciton and/or charge carrier recombination and increased the degradation of OSC devices.20,21,30 Besides, the unstable morphology and over aggregation within the active layers of NFA-OSCs under the thermal stress can disturb exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport in blend films, leading to deteriorated device PCEs.31 Furthermore, several strategies were developed to improve the device stability of NFA-OSCs. For example, fluoro-substitution of NFAs improves the resistance of photo-oxidation of NFAs;20,32 introducing a third component into the active layer stabilizes the morphology of blend films;33–36 interface engineering in devices restrains the reaction between the NFA active layer and interface layer.
This review summarizes the up-to-date progress for understanding the degradation mechanisms and then research efforts for improving the stability of NFA-OSCs (Scheme 1). First, we introduce the origin of degradation fundamentals in NFA-OSCs, including photo-oxidation, morphology instability, and interlayer-induced degradation. Second, the strategies to improve the stability of NFA-OSCs are discussed, such as molecular design of NFAs, employing a third component into blend films, and interface engineering of devices. Finally, we detail on how to achieve the high stability of high performance NFA-OSCs for future industrial manufacturing.

2. Mechanism of instability/degradation of NFA-OSCs
2.1. Oxygen and irradiation
NFA-OSCs are operated under sunlight irradiation in air, thus both oxygen and irradiation are inevitable factors for limiting the stability of NFA-OSCs. Although the commercial encapsulation materials, like glass and ultraviolet (UV)-cured epoxy, can provide a sufficient barrier layer to oxygen, it is not easy to completely avoid the exposure of photovoltaic materials to air during the large-scale fabrication process such as roll-to-roll printing.37 On the other hand, the substrates used in flexible OSC devices such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(ethylene naphthalate) only provide a limited restriction to oxygen.38 Thus, understanding the mechanism of instability of oxygen sensitive devices, and then designing inherently stable photovoltaic materials can simplify the fabrication process, reduce the encapsulation cost, and prolong the lifetime of NFA-OSC devices.
Oxygen in air penetrates the active layer, then reacts with NFAs and damages the conjugated structures through the photo-oxidation reaction.39 Meanwhile, the penetrative oxygen in active layer films can affect the electronic structure of organic semiconductors as well, even though there is no illumination.30 To explore the influence of absorbed oxygen on NFAs, Fahlman et al.30 employed the photoelectron spectroscopy approach and analyzed energy level changes of O-IDTBR and p/m-ITIC without illumination (Fig. 1). The NFAs were spin-coated on Al and characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Strong interactions were observed between three NFAs and oxygen. Taking O-IDTBR as an example, the work function of O-IDTBR increased from 3.94 eV to 4.17 eV, and the peaks of the frontier electronic structure featuring around 2.7 eV disappeared after one hour of exposure to oxygen in the dark. Meanwhile, the highest occupied molecular orbital signal of O-IDTBR was bleached completely after 200 minutes of exposure to oxygen. The same thing happened in p/m-ITIC neat films as well, which indicated that the energy level can be shifted by absorbing oxygen. The changed energy level can disturb the energy alignment between the donor and NFA in the active layer, inducing a decrease of the PCE. Meanwhile, the core level features of O (1s) of O-IDTBR shifted about 0.1 eV to higher binding energy in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, illustrating the variation of electron structures after oxygen exposure, suggesting a strong reaction between oxygen and those NFAs as well.

Besides the reaction between oxygen and NFAs in the dark, the photo-oxidation process is a more important factor which induces the relatively fast degradation of NFAs. According to the study of Sperlich et al.,40 excited singlet oxygen generated in NFA neat films after exposure to both illumination and air, which could result in oxidation reactions in the active layer and induce degradation of OSC performance. They utilized photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance and electrically detected magnetic resonance to analyze the spin states of ITIC films under illumination in air. In the neat ITIC film, the incident light excited photovoltaic molecules and generated singlet excitons, which could recombine, dissociate into free charges via a charge transfer state or undergo intersystem crossing to the triplet state (Fig. 2a). Then the triplet oxygen could be excited to reactive singlet oxygen by triplet excitons, and singlet oxygen could further induce photo-oxidation of photovoltaic films. Tsoi et al.21 employed transient absorption spectroscopy to analyze the photo-oxidation process of O-IDTBR films as well. They fitted transient absorption decays by a single exponential function, finding that the monomolecular decay of triplet excitons in O-IDTBR films was quenched by oxygen. It is worth noting that fewer triplet excitons were observed in blend films than in neat films due to more efficient charge extraction than intersystem crossing to the triplet excitons in the donor and acceptor blends. Although the limited triplet excitons in blend films cannot generate reactive singlet oxygen efficiently, it is also possible that the large pure domain or the incompatible donor–acceptor interface may suppress the charge transfer and promote singlet oxygen resulting in the photo-oxidation process.

Different from the photo-degradation of neat NFA films, the photo-oxidation process of the blend films is meanly induced by superoxide ions (O2−) which has a relationship with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of NFAs. Tsoi et al.21 analyzed the origin of the great photo-oxidation stability of P3HT: O-IDTBR blend films (Fig. 2b). Under illumination in dry air, they observed O2− generation in blend films by transient absorption kinetics fitting. Meanwhile, hydroethidine as the fluorescent probe was employed to discover the formation of O2− in P3HT: O-IDTBR blend films (Fig. 2c). With longer illumination time, blend films with hydroethidine exhibited enhanced fluorescence which indicated increased superoxide generation in blend films as a function of illumination time. The generation ability of superoxide is strongly correlated with the energy of the LUMO levels of the NFAs. Relative to PC71BM, the most widely used NFAs like ITIC and O-IDTBR, possessed a shallower LUMO level close to the electron affinity (3.75 eV) of oxygen, thus promoting the generation of more superoxide like O2− and deteriorating NFAs in blend films. The photo-degradation of P3HT in the blend films also have a relationship with the LUMO levels of the NFAs. The shallower LUMO levels of the acceptor can generate more O2− inducing faster photo-degradation of P3HT in blend films which were confirmed by transient absorption measurements (Fig. 2d). In contrast, NFAs with deeper LUMO levels could suppress the charge transfer between NFAs and oxygen, quenching photo-oxidation for both donors and acceptors in blend films.
As discussed above, the LUMO level of NFAs plays an important role in the photo-oxidation process in blend films. However, the molecular structures are highly related to oxidization reactivities, which are crucial for the stability of NFAs. Min et al.20 investigated the photo-oxidation of ITIC and analyzed the relationship of structure-stability. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to investigate the photo-oxidated products of ITIC films after exposure to light in air. After 10 hours of illumination, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were detected in the ITIC film (Fig. 3a). The MOLDI-TOF results indicated that the molar mass of photo-oxidated products of ITIC increased (with up to 4 oxygen atoms) after photo-oxidation compared with that of initial ITIC. Furthermore, a reduction of molar mass of degraded products was observed probably due to bond scission at molecular chains. Mass spectra showed some peaks of the fragment of molecules without cyano ending groups, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy absorption spectra showed the decreased intensity of identical signals of CC stretching and CN stretching, which indicated that the rupture of the terminal groups resulted from the photo-oxidation of ITIC films.17,20 These results suggest that the molecular structures similar to ITIC films could possess multiple active photo-oxidation reaction sites, including the double bonds, thiophene, benzene, the side chains, and so on (Fig. 3b). Karakawa et al.41 elucidated the changes in the chemical structures of terminal groups of EH-IDTBR after 100 hours of light-soaking, and found a conversion of CS to CO on terminal groups (Fig. 3c). The chemical structure variation induced the blue shift of the absorption spectra of EH-IDTBR after light-soaking, and also formed defects as the charge recombination centres in blend films.

Besides the type of building block of NFAs, molecular conformation, especially the backbone planarity, is closely related to the photo-degradation of NFAs in OSCs. O-IDTBR and its analogue IDFBR were compared by Kim et al.42 to figure out the relationship between the backbone planarity and stability of NFAs. O-IDTBR was constructed with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit, while IDFBR consisted of an indenofluorene (IDF) core unit adopting a more twisted conformation than IDT. The IDFBR neat film decomposed much faster than O-IDTBR under illumination either in N2 or in air. A three-phase degradation mechanism was proposed to explain the difference in stabilities between two similar NFAs, through in situ resonant Raman spectroscopy monitoring the vibrations related to the molecular structure and conformation (Fig. 3d and e). In detail, the incident light first excited the NFAs and induced a conformational change by increasing the dihedral angle between the IDT (IDF) core and nearby benzothiadiazoles. Then the twisted linkage broke up and the conjugate structure turned into fragments. The dihedral angle played an important role in this degradation process because more twisted backbones were prone to be broken and resulted in rapid photo-degradation. The backbone planarity with a small dihedral angle also increased the crystallinity and prevented the film from oxygen permeation, resulting in better photo-stability of IDTBR than IDFBR in air. More interestingly, IDFBR with a more twisted structure could disrupt P3HT crystallinity and lead to instability of P3HT (Fig. 3f).
The NFAs were much more sensitive to the UV part in the sunlight spectrum, relative to visible and infrared light, considering the chemical stability.41 UV light with high energy always leads to photochemical reaction in blend films.19 An additive like 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is one kind of photosensitive compound which can generate free radicals under UV illumination and further react with NFAs. Brabec et al.19 revealed that DIO can accelerate the degradation of ITIC under illumination. MALDI-TOF results suggested the generation of covalent bonding between ITIC and C8H16I* radicals (Fig. 4a). Another independent work conducted by Doumon et al.43 also proved that DIO accelerated the degradation of NFA-OSCs under UV illumination (Fig. 4b). Compared with UV light, the light with long wavelength can induce relatively slight but constant degradation of NFA-OSCs. The incident low energy photon highly possibly induces thermal effect, and then the high temperature changes the morphology of the BHJ blend, inducing burn-in degradation and slow long-term decrease in PCEs of NFA-OSCs. The morphology effects on degradation will be discussed in the next section.

As discussed above, light and oxygen induced reactions in active films are crucial for deterioration progress in NFA-OSCs. Thus, the nature of the NFA including energy levels, active groups and unstable molecular conformations plays a key role in the design of photo-oxidation resistant NFA structures. At the same time, reactions in blend films between additives and photoactive materials showed a negative effect on the stability of OSCs. Rational design of molecular structures with inert reactivity properties could be a promising strategy for improving the stability of NFA-OSCs, which will be detailed in Section 3.
2.2. Metastable morphology
Almost all the high-performance OSCs utilized the BHJ structure in which the mixed donor and acceptor form a nanoscale bicontinuous morphology with multiple carrier transport channels, which promotes efficient exciton dissociation and decreases the charge recombination.44–46 The optimum BHJ morphology can be achieved by tuning the compatibility between the donor and acceptor, and adapting some post-treatments like thermal annealing, the usage of additives, and so on.3 NFAs are prone to local crystallization/aggregation in a small area of the mixed region.25 When the composition of the mixed region is far away from that of the thermodynamic equilibrium state, aggregation/reorganization of either polymers or NFAs will aggravate morphological variations (Fig. 5a), leading to the imbalance of electron/hole mobility and then severe charge trapping and recombination losses.25 The photo-induced phase separation can be observed by grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements. For example, Brabec et al.17 observed obvious changes in the GISAXS profiles of PBDB-T: ITIC-DM blends before and after light-soaking. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of illuminated PBDB-T: ITIC-DM blends clearly showed a new emission peak from the polymer, indicating a phase separation in the mixed region. The fast morphological changes in the initial stage of degradation mainly reduced the fill factor (FF); meanwhile the short-circuit current density (JSC) could also be affected with long term light-soaking, reducing the performance of NFA-OSCs continuously.47 The material compatibility, the mobility of NFAs in the mixed regions, and the interplay between the polymer and NFA in the initial morphology of the mixed region significantly influence the degradation process.31

Thermal annealing is a general method to optimize the morphology of BHJ blend films to acquire high performance of OSCs. However thermal treatment or high operation temperature can cause morphology deterioration, thereby playing a crucial role in the degradation of NFA-OSCs. Ade et al.48 studied the thermodynamics of the morphological variation of BHJ blends and revealed a relationship between burn-in degradation and thermal-induced deterioration. In the BHJ blend, the morphology is normally comprised of three phases, accepter-rich domain, donor-rich domain, and mixed domain. The composition corresponding to the lowest limit of electron transport in BHJ is named percolation threshold.46 When the mixed domains have a donor/acceptor ratio close to the percolation threshold, the charge carriers can transport smoothly and then devices acquire the optimized PCE. When the morphology of the blend film with optimized efficiency is far from that of either meta-stable state or thermodynamically stable state, serious phase separation happens and results in burn-in degradation of OSCs under high operation temperature. Ade et al.48 investigated the thermal-stability of several blends, such as P3HT: EH-IDTBR, and FTAZ: EH-IDTBR, and FTAZ: ITIC. The different crystallinity and diffusion abilities of the material significantly affected the morphology stability. The diffusion coefficients of EH-IDTBR in P3HT and FTAZ were estimated to be 1.7 × 10−17 and 2.0 × 10−18 cm2 s−1, respectively. Compared with EH-IDBTR in FTAZ, the higher diffusion coefficient of EH-IDTBR in P3HT enabled demixing in P3HT: EH-IDTBR blend films, which induced severe burn-in degradation in both as-cast and annealed devices. Being different from amorphous polymer FTAZ, P3HT was a semi-crystalline polymer, and thus showed worse miscibility with EH-IDTBR, leading to stronger phase separation in P3HT: EH-IDTBR blend films with thermal annealing at 160 °C for 48 hours (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the cold crystallization temperature of EH-IDTBR (121 °C) was much lower than that of ITIC (200 °C), because of which FTAZ: EH-IDTBR showed worse thermal-stability than FTAZ: ITIC with thermal annealing at 120 °C. As discussed above, polymer donors with different crystallinities can affect the miscibility of NFAs in blends and further impact the morphology stability of OSCs. However, the variation of polymer donor domains can also induce a performance decrease in NFA-OSCs. Müller-Buschbaum et al.49 observed the growth of polymer domains in PBDB-T-SF: IT-4F blend films by GISAXS. (Fig. 5c). The reduced interface-to-volume ratio of polymer domains inhibited the probability of exciton dissociation, and then decreased the JSC of OSCs.
Besides the phase-separation and domain size variation in the interpenetrating networks of the BHJ active layer, the molecular orientation is also related to charge separation and transport, and thus the device stability for NFA-OSCs. For example, the (100) lamellar peak of ITIC films blended with PBDB-T decreased in the in-plane direction, but increased in the out-of-plane direction after light-soaking, resulting in a PCE decrease.17 It should be noted here that very few reports focused on the effect of molecular orientation transformation on device degradation to date, which required a more thorough understanding.
The morphology variation of blend films affects the Jsc and FF in long term because the blend film morphology is usually quenched from the non-equilibrium state which induces phase separation to approach thermodynamic equilibrium. Meanwhile, the molecular orientation change in the blend film deteriorates the carrier transport and thus induces instability of OSCs as well. Therefore, methods to achieve stable morphology like introducing intramolecular interactions and modifying molecular aggregation behaviours could be possible ways to enhance the stability of NFA-OSCs, which will be particularly discussed in Section 3.
2.3. Interfaces
In addition to chemical degradation and morphology deterioration within active layers, interlayer materials that directly come in contact with the active layer have nonnegligible effects on the instability of NFA-OSCs as well. Some widely used interlayer materials like poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) and zinc oxide (ZnO) could interact with NFAs of active layers, resulting in NFA decomposition, and hence a decreased PCE of OSCs.15
ZnO is a typical electron transport layer (ETL) used in an inverted device to efficiently extract the photo generated electrons from active layers, because of its several advantages, such as sufficient transmittance, good electronic conductivity, easy fabrication through solution-process and low cost. However, ZnO suffers from the intrinsic ultraviolet response photocatalytic ability which has been found to damage the active layers and results in poor stability of OSCs under illumination. Son et al.28 investigated the photo-stability of the NFA-OSC on the ZnO interlayer and proposed a photocatalytic degradation mechanism of NFA on the ZnO layer. Under illumination, the UV photo-generated electrons of the ZnO film reacted with active layers deposited on the ZnO. Furthermore, the widely used sol–gel-derived ZnO films easily absorb H2O and O2 during thermal-annealing in air. Then the adsorbed H2O and O2 became hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) under illumination and subsequently attacked NFAs nearby. Taking ITIC films as an example, the vinyl group of enone in ITIC films reacted with hydroxyl radicals by an addition reaction, which produced ITIC radicals. The ITIC radical continuously reacted with another ITIC molecule and formed ITIC dimers, or broke into other fragments (Fig. 6a). These reactions changed the original structure of the ITIC film, disturbed electron extraction and reduced the electron collection from the active layer to electrodes.

Besides ZnO, some polymers are developed as ETLs for application in NFA-OSCs. Both PEI and PEIE contain abundant amine groups, offering surface dipoles on the ITO surface and facilitating effective charge transfer from the active layer to electrodes. However, too many amines act as a two-edged sword, which is beneficial for efficient electron collection to the electrode but damages the active layer. Zhou et al. did a series of research on the reaction between PEI and NFAs (Fig. 6b).26,50,51 The widely used NFAs, including ITIC, IT-M, IT-4F, IEICO-4F and Y6, were employed to react with bases like OH− or amine. The vinyl group of enone in NFAs was broken when adding sodium hydroxide to the solution of NFAs. However, the degradation was reversible. By adding acetic acid in the decomposed solution of NFA, the colour of NFAs could recover and the conjugated structure of NFAs is rebuilt (Fig. 6c).
Although acid will not react with NFA directly,50 Zhu et al.29 reported that the acidic PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layers (HTLs) could interact with ITIC in the conventional device and decreased the PCE with a long light-soaking time. The absorption spectra of a pristine ITIC layer and the bilayer ITIC/PEDOT:PSS were recorded before and after illumination. These results indicated that the absorption in the long wavelength region of pristine ITIC and bilayer ITIC/PEDOT:PSS films changed after exposure to light. The absorption of the ITIC/PEDOT:PSS film decreased much faster than that of the pristine ITIC film at the same aging time. The Raman spectroscopy measurement was also applied to analyze the change in the quinoidal configuration of the PEDOT:PSS in the OSCs. There was a characteristic peak shift of quinoidal configuration from 1456 cm−1 to 1452 cm−1 observed in bilayer ITIC/PEDOT:PSS films, indicating the reaction between ITIC and PEDOT:PSS. In addition to the interaction between PEDOT:PSS and ITIC, Zhou et al.52 investigated the reaction between widely used additive DIO and PEDOT:PSS. Under the acidic environment of PEDOT:PSS, the iodine–carbon bonds in DIO could break into HI, then formed I2 by oxidization of PEDOT:PSS. Meanwhile, the reduction of PEDOT:PSS resulted in a decrease in the work function and then inhibition of efficient hole collection.
As discussed above, reactions induced by traditional interlayers damage photoactive layers and then induce deterioration of NFA-OSCs. These reactivities could originate from alkalinity or acidity and catalysis of interlayers. Reliable strategies to eliminate these damages, including modification of interlayers and new invented interlayers, will be discussed in the following section.
3. Strategy to improve the stability of NFA-OSCs
3.1. Molecule design
Most NFAs are constructed with three parts: the conjugated core, terminal end group and side chain. The conjugated core can be divided into a fused-ring core and an unfused-ring core. The fused-ring core like IDT and its derivatives has the advantage of good planarity facilitating intermolecular stacking. While the unfused-ring core like benzoazole possesses a single bond or π-bridge between the molecular core and the terminal groups, inducing twisted structures and preventing NFAs from over-aggregation in blend films. Terminal groups play an important role in optimizing the energy levels and intermolecular stacking. The terminal groups with strong electron-withdrawing ability can effectively shift down the LUMO level of the NFAs, and enhance the interaction between terminal groups resulting in increased crystallinity of NFAs. Additionally, side chains of NFAs can change the morphology of blend films and thus affect the stability of NFA-OSCs. Molecular engineering on the conjugated core, terminal end group and side chain determines the chemical properties and aggregation behaviours, and thus intrinsically regulates the stability of NFA-OSCs. The chemical structures of NFAs discussed in this section are summarized in Fig. 7.

There have been several research studies focusing on chemical structure design to improve the photo-stability of NFA-based OSCs (Table 1). Min et al.20 found that the conjugated length of the fused-ring cores has a close relationship with the instinct stability of NFAs. A series of NFA films were exposed to air under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and their absorption spectra were recorded after different irradiation times to estimate the photo-oxidation rate. By comparing the absorption variation of NFAs with similar fused-ring structures, it was clear that extending the core size from seven-fused rings (IT-4F) to eight-fused rings (F8IC) improved the photo-oxidation stability of NFAs.

The symmetry of the fused-ring core can also impact the stability of NFA-OSCs. Wang et al.53 developed a pair of isomers of fused-octacyclic NFAs, named N65-2FIC and N66-2FIC. Specifically, N65-2FIC possesses an asymmetric naphthalene-bisthieno[3,2-b]thiophene core while N66-2FIC has an axisymmetric naphthalene-bisthieno[3,2-b]thiophene core. The OSC devices based on PBDB-T-2F: N65-2FIC retained 85% of initial performance after 1500 hours of LED illumination in N2, while the control device based on the N66-2FIC electron acceptor only retained 60% of initial performance under the same conditions. N65-2FIC exhibited higher crystallinity in blend films than N66-2FIC according to grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. The higher crystallinity induced limited diffusion of N65-2FIC in the as-cast blend film and resulted in better stability of N65-2FIC based OSCs, relative to N65-2FIC based OSCs.
Besides the widely studied fused-ring core based NFA, some unfused-ring core based NFAs attract attention for possessing more diversified structures with smaller building blocks. The stability of the unfused-ring core based NFA has been studied as well. Benzoazole derivatives with a strong quinoid character were used to construct NFAs. Chen et al.54 fabricated four NFAs named SSTI, SNTI, NTI and NTTI, which had different benzoazole derivatives as unfused-ring cores. The strength of the quinoid effect in line of SSTI > SNTI > NTI > NTTI significantly influenced the photo-stability of their corresponding OSC devices. The photo-stability was detected by recording the changes in the absorption of solution or films of these NFAs under illumination. As a result, SSTI exhibited the worst photo-stability compared with the other three counterparts, because SSTI could transfer into chemical reactive species under illumination through the quinoid resonance effect owing to the “pro-quinoid” core (a π-allyl radical). However, NTTI exhibited great stability in both solution and film states because of the less electron-withdrawing ability and weak quinoid effect of azole fused benzene rings. Then the photo-stability of the PBDB-T: NTTI based device was investigated as well. However, the photo-stability of the PBDB-T: NTTI based device was not good, and the PCE of the PBDB-T: NTTI based device decreased 70% after light-soaking for 23.3 hours. This result indicated that in addition to the intrinsic photo-stability of NFAs, there were other inevitable factors that controlled the photo-stability of NFA based OSCs.
The planarity of the fused-ring core is another factor that influences the photo-stability of NFAs. According to the study of Kim et al.,42 O-IDTBR had a more planar fused-ring core, and thus exhibited better photo-stability than IDFBR. Under illumination with a LED for 120 hours under an N2 atmosphere, the P3HT: O-IDTBR based device maintained ca. 90% of its initial PCE, while the P3HT: IDFBR based device only retained ca. 60% of its initial PCE. This result indicates that a better planar geometry is beneficial to the photo-stability of NFAs which should be considered in the design of the NFAs based on the fused-ring core. Lee et al.55 synthesized a 3-D shape NFA, named SF-HR, with spirobifluorene as the centre core. The encapsulated OSCs based on P3HT: SF-HR retained only 72% of the initial PCE under illumination for 100 hours. Compared with the planar O-IDTBR, this 3-D shape NFA showed less photo-stability as well.
Terminal end groups play an important role in constructing NFAs through adjusting the molecular energy level, band gap and aggregation in blend films. 2-(3-Oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) (IC) is a widely used terminal group in NFAs for OSCs. The decoration of halogen and methyl on the IC group can change the photo-stability of NFAs impressively. According to Min et al.,20 ITIC derivatives with methyl-IC, dimethyl-IC, thiophene fused IC, methyl-thiophene fused IC and chlorine-thiophene fused IC exhibited the same order of photo-degradation rate, which were far less stable than chlorine-substituted IC and fluorine-substituted IC end-capped NFAs under illumination. Meanwhile, ITIC derivatives based on chlorine-substituted IC groups are much more stable than ITIC derivatives based on fluorine-substituted IC units under illumination. Brabec et al.17 compared the photo-stability of ITIC, ITIC-DM, and IT-4F based OSC devices under LED illumination in N2. It turned out that the device based on PBDB-T: IT-4F blend films maintained its original performance over 85% after 1600 hours of illumination and the estimated T80 (the time required to reach 80% of the initial PCE) of the PBDB-T: IT-4F device was over 11000 hours. However, the ITIC based control device only possessed near 64% of initial performance after 1600 hours of illumination and tended to undergo a continuous decrease. The ITIC-DM in which IC end groups were substituted with methyl groups exhibited the worst stability which only retained ca. 10% of the initial PCE after 1600 hours of photo-degradation test. It is clear that the fluorinated IC terminal groups played important roles in the photo-stability of NFA based OSCs. Tang et al.56 designed and synthesized CZTT-IC with IC terminal groups and its counterpart CZTT-4F with fluorinated IC terminal groups. The PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-4F based device exhibited better photo-stability than the other devices. PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-4F based devices retained 78.7% of the initial PCEs under 100 hours of illumination, while the PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-IC, PBDB-T: CZTT-IC and PBDB-T: CZTT-4F based devices only retained 59.9%, 56.6% and 62.2% of their initial performance, respectively. Furthermore, the position of the halogen decoration on IC groups influenced the stability of NFA-OSCs. He et al.57 modified the ITIC by adding chlorine atoms to different positions of IC to form isomers: ITIC-2Cl-δ and ITIC-2Cl-γ. The PBDB-T-2F: ITIC-2Cl-γ based device retained 85% of the initial PCE after 200 hours of illumination, showing better photo-stability than the counterpart device based on ITIC-2Cl-δ (80%).
The benzothiadiazole–rhodanine terminal group is promising for designing highly stable NFAs. For example, O-IDTBR and its derivatives capped with benzothiadiazole–rhodanine groups showed high photo-oxidation resistance in neat films.20 Meanwhile, these kinds of NFAs also exhibit good stability in OSC devices. Brabec et al.58 reported P3HT: O-IDTBR based OSCs showing about only 5% PCE loss after 2000 hours of illumination of LEDs under a N2 atmosphere. Durrant and Gasparini et al.16,59 prepared EH-IDTBR and fabricated OSC devices by blending with PffBT4T-2OD and PTB7-Th as the donors, respectively. Both kinds of devices showed enhanced photo-stability in contrast to their fullerene-based counterparts. The PffBT4T-2OD: EH-IDTBR based device showed negligible burn-in efficiency loss after illumination for 60 hours. Then the PCE of the PTB7-Th: EH-IDTBR based device was maintained at about 70% after 100 hours of illumination of AM 1.5G light and at 90% after 1000 hours of illumination of LED light, respectively. Yip et al.60 also investigated the photo-stability of PTB7-Th: EH-IDTBR devices, which retained 96% of PCE after illumination for 500 hours and the T80 was calculated to be 2132 hours. The EH-IDTBR showed optimal miscibility with the PTB7-Th donor, resulting in a stable morphology and good photo-stability of NFA-OSCs.
The side chains also played a crucial role in the photo-stability of NFAs. For example, the alkoxybenzene substituted l-IDTBTRh is more stable than the octyl-substituted O-IDTBR; when compared with ITIC, better photo-stability was observed in ITC6-IC with terminal hexyl chains on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties.20 Similarly, ITIC-Th with alkylthiophene substituted side chains in the PBDB-T: ITIC-Th device showed better photo-stability (85%) than that of alkylbenzene-substituted ITIC in PBDB-T: ITIC (64%).17 Zhang et al.61 designed an alkylated donor core and synthesized highly crystalline C8-IT-4F. The PCE of the OSCs based on PBDB-T-2Cl: C8-IT-4F was retained at 87% after continuous illumination for 1060 hours under LED illumination in N2. The composition of C8-IT-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl in blend films in the mixed region was close to the percolation threshold of the blend system, and thus the morphology of the PBDB-T-2Cl: C8-IT-4F blend reached the equilibrium state with the best PCE performance simultaneously, which induced great stability of the NFA-OSCs employing PBDB-T-2Cl: C8-IT-4F under continuous irradiation. Tang et al.62 designed several asymmetric NFAs by attaching varied 2-D side-chains on the thieno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol (IPT) core, including IPT2F-Th with thiophene, IPT2F-Ph with benzene, and IPT2F-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) sidechains. The PBDB-T: IPT2F-TT based device exhibited 87% of initial performance, which was higher than the counterpart device based on IPT2F-Th and IPT2F-Ph during the photo-stability test under AM 1.5G light aging for 100 hours.
The thermal-stability and shelf-stability of OSCs can be affected by molecular structures through optimized interactions between molecular and adjusted aggregation behaviours in blend films (Tables 2 and 3). Brabec et al.63 reported that O-IDTBR reduced the energy disorder and suppressed the burn-in process in P3HT: O-IDTBR based OSCs, which maintained 73% of initial PCE after being exposed to air for 1200 hours. The EH-IDTBR has a similar structure to O-IDTBR and exhibited good thermal-stability as well.16 The PffBT4T-2OD: EH-IDTBR based device showed a PCE loss of only 16% after thermal treatment at 85 °C for 160 hours. Zheng et al.64 applied indenothiophene as an asymmetric fused-ring core to fabricate NFA named ITDI. The epoxy encapsulated PBDB-T: ITDI based device exhibited over 93% of the original performance in ambient air for more than 720 hours. Zhang et al.65 used single alkylthio-substituted thiophene as a π-bridge to design an asymmetrical NFA named IDST-4F. The PBDB-T-2F: IDST-4F based device exhibited better stability than the control devices based on symmetrical ID-4F with both dark storage and thermal treatment. After being stored under dark in air for 1200 hours, the PBDB-T-2F: IDST-4F based device retained 92% of initial performance, and in contrast, the PBDB-T-2F: ID-4F based device only retained 85%. Meanwhile, the original PCE value of the PBDB-T-2F: IDST-4F based device and PBDB-T-2F: ID-4F based device remained 82% and 61% under thermal treatment at 150 °C for 20 hours, respectively. Compared with ID-4F, IDST-4F underwent an additional S⋯S noncovalent interaction between the sulfur atoms on the alkylthio and the thiophene units, which facilitated planar conformation of IDST-4F. Meanwhile, the weak S⋯S noncovalent interaction could be broken under high temperature, resulting in a twisted geometry to avoid over aggregation in blend films, and thus improve the thermal-stability and shelf-stability of OSC devices dramatically.

Chen et al.66 synthesized an NFA named DF-PCIC which contained an unfused-ring core attached to 2,5-difluorobenzene and two cyclopentadithiophene units. The OSCs based on PBDB-T: DF-PCIC retained 86.2% of initial performance after thermal treatment at 150 °C for 12 hours, and in contrast, the PBDB-T: ITIC based device only retained PCE less than 70% of the initial value under the same conditions. Because of F⋯H noncovalent interactions between 2,5-difluorobenzene and cyclopentadithiophene, DF-PCIC possessed a nearly planar molecular geometry which induced high crystallinity in the as-cast blend film. On the other hand, DF-PCIC would adapt a twisted molecular geometry since the F⋯H noncovalent interactions were destroyed under high temperatures, which induced better thermal-stability of DF-PCIC based OSCs than ITIC based devices. Some other NFAs with twisted conformation was designed to acquire high stability at high temperature. Jung et al.67 developed di-PBI, a bay-linked perylene bisimide derivative, to construct OSCs by blending with PBDTTS-TTffBT. They found that the PBDTTS-TTffBT: di-PBI based NFA-OSCs could maintain over 70% of its initial PCE after thermal treatment at 100 °C for 3.3 hours. Besides, SF-HR, designed by Lee et al.,55 possessed amorphous features because of four alkyl-chains which prevented further aggregation of SF-HR in blend films under continuous heating. Thus, the OSCs based on P3HT: SF-HR retained 83% of its initial performance after thermal treatment at 120 °C for 100 hours.
Tang et al.56 designed and synthesized CZTT-IC with IC terminal groups and its counterpart CZTT-4F with fluorinated IC terminal groups. The PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-4F based device showed improved thermal-stability compared with the PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-IC based device, in which PBDB-T-2F: CZTT-4F and CZTT-IC based OSCs preserved 90.1% and 74.4% of their initial PCEs under 100 hours of thermal annealing at 85 °C, respectively. The same trend was also observed in PBDBT: CZTT-IC and PBDB-T: CZTT-4F devices. The CZTT-4F with a fluorinated IC terminal group exhibited relatively lower miscibility with PBDB-T-2F, preventing aggregation of CZTT-4F in the blend film during aging, which could improve the thermal-stability of the OSCs. Furthermore, the position of the chlorine decoration on IC groups influenced the stability of NFA-OSCs. He et al.57 modified the ITIC by adding chlorine atoms to different positions of IC to form isomers: ITIC-2Cl-δ and ITIC-2Cl-γ. In the thermal-stability test, the PBDB-T-2F: ITIC-2Cl-γ based device maintained PCE close to 90% of the initial value, but the PBDB-T-2F: ITIC-2Cl-δ based device retained about 80% of the initial PCE under 80 °C treatment in N2. The PBDB-T-2F: ITIC-2Cl-γ based device showed better photo-stability as well. The different positions of the chlorine atoms on terminal groups had an extraordinary impact on the molecular orientation and packing in the film. In the ITIC-2Cl-δ single-crystal structure, only a linear stacked structure was observed, whereas in the ITIC-2Cl-γ single-crystal structure, a 3-D interpenetrating network was presented by horizontal and perpendicular stacking directions. The 3-D rectangular structure contributed to the stable morphology of ITIC-2Cl-γ in the active layer and thus endowed the ITIC-2Cl-γ based OSCs with better thermal-stability than ITIC-2Cl-δ based OSCs. Zheng et al.68 used cyclopentadithiophene as the central core and benzothiadiazole-rhodanine as a terminal group to construct an NFA, named SSBR. The PTB7-Th: SSBR device exhibited excellent shelf-life stability with a loss of only 7.8% relative to its initial PCE after storing in the dark for 4320 hours. Xu et al.69 designed and synthesized IDT-BT-R and IDT-BT-R-CN with terminal groups of benzothiadiazole-rhodanine derivatives. After thermal treatment at 150 °C for 60 min, both PTB7-Th: IDT-BT-R and PTB7-Th: IDT-BT-R-CN based devices showed an increased PCE, which indicated that IDT-BT-R and IDT-BT-R-CN showed optimized miscibility with PTB7-Th in blend films under high temperature, thus exhibiting better thermal-stability in NFA-OSC devices.
Side chains can change the aggregation behaviour and induce different thermal and shelf -stabilities of NFAs. Yang et al.70 reported a strategy by decorating fluorine atoms at the ortho-alkyl and meta-alkyl positions of the phenyl side chains of ITIC, and synthesized two NFAs, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, respectively. The PBTIBDTT: mF-ITIC based devices showed 92% of initial PCE after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 96 hours, while PBTIBDTT: ITIC and PBTIBDTT: oF-ITIC based devices only retained 82% and 67% of their initial performance, respectively. The mF-ITIC displayed the weakest crystallinity in both pristine films and blend films with polymer donors, leading to less aggregation under annealing at 150 °C, which mainly contributed to the highest thermal-stability, compared with the other two kinds of devices. This result disclosed that the side chain can efficiently tune the intermolecular stacking, and side chain engineering could be a promising way to realize the high thermal-stability of NFA-OSCs. Tang et al.62 designed asymmetric NFAs with varied 2-D side-chains, including IPT2F-Th with thiophene, IPT2F-Ph with benzene, and IPT2F-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) sidechains. Different sidechains led to great differences in thermal-stability. The PBDB-T: IPT2F-TT based device exhibited high device stability in both thermal aging tests, with an efficiency retention of about 90% under 85 °C annealing for 100 hours. However, IPT2F-Th and IPT2F-Ph possessed the worse stability, retaining less than 80% of initial PCE in thermal aging tests. The 2-D side-chains substituted with TT could generate uniform and ordered phase separation morphology than those substituted with thiophene and benzene, featuring good thermal-stability and photo-stability of NFA-OSCs.
Through molecular engineering, the LUMO of NFAs can be moderated to a deeper level which is beneficial to improve the stability of OSCs. For example, Choi et al.71 used dicyanovinylene (DCV) and tricyanovinylene (TCV) as the strong electron-withdrawing terminal groups and IDT/IDTT as electron-donating groups to construct NFAs with different LUMO levels. Both PTB7-Th: IDT(TCV)2 and PTB7-Th: IDTT(TCV)2 based devices exhibited increased PCEs after storing in the dark for 1000 hours without encapsulation in air, while the PCE of the PTB7-Th: IDT(DCV)2 based device decreased to less than 50% of initial efficiency under the same conditions. Due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the TCV than DCV, IDT(TCV)2 and IDTT(TCV)2 possessed deeper LUMO levels (−4.18 and −4.06 eV) than that of IDT(DCV)2 (−3.65 eV). Deeper LUMO energy probably played an important role in high oxidization resistance of IDT(TCV)2 and IDTT(TCV)2 based OSC devices.
The engineering of molecular structures can efficiently tune the energy levels and aggregation behaviours of NFAs, thereby optimizing the OSC efficiency and stability. The planar main chain showed an advantage in increasing the oxidization stability while the twisted core has the potential to prevent aggregation of NFAs under thermal treatment. The side chains could control the conformation and aggregation of NFAs in blend films, further adjusting the morphology stability of the NFA-OSCs. The terminal group was used to enhance the stability of NFAs through adjusting the LUMO level and forming strong intermolecular interactions in blend films to improve thermal and photo-stability in NFA-OSCs. Thus, molecules should be comprehensively considered and designed to regulate energy level resisting photo-oxidation, and enhance intermolecular interactions acquiring robust morphology.
3.2. Additional components
Adding a third component to the BHJ films is a promising strategy for the high-performance of NFA-OSCs, which can induce broader absorption and optimized morphology of BHJ. More importantly, some studies have reported that the third component can improve the photo-stability of OSCs and stabilize the unstable binary blend morphologies to improve the thermal and shelf-stabilities of NFA-OSCs (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Additives for improvement of stabilities in OSCs. 
The DIO as a solvent additive has been used to improve the PCEs of OSCs with varied active layers, but DIO easily reacts with the materials of the active layer and/or interlayer of OSCs under irradiation, causing instability of the NFA-OSC devices. Meanwhile, DIO is hardly removed from blend films entirely because of the relatively high boiling temperature (167–169 °C/6.0 mmHg).72 Therefore, some studies focused on developing alternative materials to replace DIO in OSCs (Table 4). For example, Yang et al.36 applied 9,10-anthracenedione (BDT-1) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDT-2) to optimize the morphology of the PBDB-T-2F: TPT10 blend film. After 520 hours of illumination in N2, the BDT-1 additive treated NFA-OSCs presented better stability with 86.2% of PCE retention than that of the device with DIO (75.8%). For photo-stability in air, Tong et al.73 utilized TPPI-TPE as a morphology regulator in the PTB7-Th: ITIC based device. The device with the additive showed a decrease of PCE of 27% while the device without the additive exhibited a more decay of PCE of 61%. More interestingly, the instability caused by photo-oxidation can be suppressed by the third component intentionally. Min et al.20 found that adding 2% of nickel dibutyldithiocarbamate in the blend film could effectively restrain the photo-degradation of the J71: ITIC based BHJ film, and then improve the photo-stability of the NFA-OSC device, even though the embed nickel dibutyldithiocarbamate formed a few traps in the BHJ device.

The main function of additives in the stability improvement of OSCs is to modify the morphology and interaction between molecules in blend films, resulting in melioration of thermal and shelf-stability (Tables 5 and 6). Moon et al.74 developed a co-additive method to enhance the device stability. They incorporated 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (4-FBD) with DIO as co-additives in PBDB-T: ITIC based OSCs and found that the device employing co-additives exhibited better shelf-stability in air than the control device with only DIO additives. The better stability of the device with co-additives was mainly attributed to locked interpenetrating morphology in NFA-OSCs. Li et al.75 proposed 1,4-difluorobenzene (DFB) with a low boiling point of 88.8 °C as an additive for J71: m-ITTC based NFA-OSCs. The devices with additive treatment performed the long-term shelf-stability with 87% retention of PCE after 200 hours storage, higher than that of the device without additive (80%). Chen et al.76 investigated the effect of two low boiling point additives, 1,1-dimethoxyethylbenzene and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol, on the stability of PTB7-Th: EH-IDTBR based devices. They found both 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MHA) and 1,1-dimethoxyethylbenzene (DMB) helped in achieving higher performance and better long-term shelf-stability than the control device without additive treatment. After storage in the dark for 800 hours, the NFA-OSCs based on PTB7-Th: EH-IDTBR with MHA and DMB additives, retained 94% and 92.5% of the initial performance respectively, while the device without additives retained only 87.5% of the initial PCE.

Besides the liquid additives mentioned above, solid additives were also proposed to enhance the performance and stability of NFA-OSCs. Yang et al.36 applied 9,10-anthracenedione (BDT-1) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDT-2) to optimize the morphology of the PBDB-T-2F: TPT10 blend film. The OSC device with the DIO additive maintained 69.0% of the original PCE under a constant thermal treatment at 60 °C for 505 hours, and in contrast, the devices with solid additives, BDT-1 and BDT-2, exhibited 79.2% and 76.5% of their initial efficiency, respectively. A volatilizable solid additive (SA-1) with a similar structure to IC end groups of NFAs was investigated by Hou et al.77 SA-1 can be easily removed under thermal aging because of a low volatilization temperature of 140 °C, enabling better long-term shelf-stability than the NFA-OSCs with DIO.
Some small molecules with complementary absorption with photovoltaic materials in blend films were applied as additives, which can enhance the light harvesting capability and increase the PCE of NFA-OSCs. Tong et al.73 utilized TPPI-TPE as the morphology regulator in PTB7-Th: ITIC based devices. After thermal annealing at 80 °C for 4 hours in air, the device with TPPI-TPE additives retained 71% of the initial PCE, but the devices without additives maintained only 38% of the initial PCE. The additive had a rigid planar structure, which promoted the crystallization of the polymer donor in blend films. Tao et al.78 added coumarin 7 to the PTB7-Th: ITIC based device, resulting in enhanced thermal-stability of the unencapsulated devices. The device with coumarin 7 retained 80% of the initial PCE after thermal annealing at 80 °C for 180 min, while the control devices retained only 40% of initial PCE. The significant improvement of stability is related to the introduced intermolecular hydrogen bonds between ITIC and coumarin 7. In addition to small molecular solid additives, Yang et al.79 reported a nonconjugated polymer additive poly-(pentafluorostyrene) (PPFS) and added it to the PBDB-TT5: ITIC based OSCs. It turned out that the PPFS acted as a morphological locking-in agent in the active layer, contributing to a more stable morphology and showing both enhanced thermal-stability and long-term shelf-stability compared with the control device with traditional DIO additives.
The additional photovoltaic materials were utilized to form ternary NFA-OSCs, which had advantages of broader absorption, improved charge separation, and better stability than binary NFA-OSCs.80 Fullerenes can be used as an effective stabilizer in an NFA-OSC system to enhance the stability.35,81,82 For example, Koster et al.83 fabricated ternary OSCs with the PBDB-T: ITIC: PC71BM system and proved an enhancement in photo-stability. Sun et al.84 applied PC71BM as the third component into the PBT1-C: IT-2F based binary blend and reported the improvement of retention of PCE from 92% to 96% after 1440 hours of storage in air. Furthermore, Ko et al.85 summarized that the PC71BM in ternary blends could suppress the domain growth during the thermal aging process and resulted in a more stable morphology. Some NFAs like ITIC, IDTBR, Y6 and their derivatives were introduced into binary NFA-OSCs to form ternary OSCs.86–92 Baran et al. found that O-IDTBR could improve the photo-stability of the PBDB-T-2F: Y6 device. The addition of 15% O-IDTBR led to a negligible PCE decrease of the PBDB-T-2F: Y6: O-IDTBR device, while the PBDB-T-2F: Y6 binary device showed a severe efficiency reduction of over 60% after 225 hours of illumination. The O-IDTBR with high crystallinity was selectively miscible within Y6 and thus resulted in a new mixed domain, which was beneficial to increase the stability of the device.
Furthermore, some studies employed additional polymer acceptor materials to create a more robust morphology of the NFA-OSC device. Yang et al.93 applied N2200, one of the most popular polymer acceptors, as the third component into the PBDB-T: ITIC binary blend to fabricate ternary OSCs. It was found that the PBDB-T: N2200: ITIC based device showed good air stability with ca. 80% PCE of the original performance after 1000 hours of storage in air, while the PBDB-T: ITIC binary devices retained an initial PCE of 74%. N2200 was prone to generate a fibrillar structure and form the continuous interpenetrating networks in the ternary system. The fibred N2200 settled the other two components and restrained the morphology of the ternary active layer, leading to enhanced stability of the ternary device. Similarly, So et al.94 introduced N2200 to both PBDB-T-2F: IT-4F and PBDB-T: ITIC-M based devices and demonstrated that N2200 can improve the photo-stability of those NFA-OSCs, in which the N2200 acted as a morphology stabilizer in the BHJ blend and thus enhanced the stability of the active layer.
Additional components in blend films lead to unexpected results in stabilizing NFA-OSCs. Some additives acted as morphology stabilizers to prevent phase separation, and others worked as chemical quenchers to restrain the photo-degradation of NFA-OSCs. Comparing to design new photovoltaic materials with good stability, investigating additional components in improving stability of OSCs is the more low-cost and more efficient strategy.
3.3. Passivation of interlayers
The interlayer plays an important role in charge extraction and collection in OSCs. The chemical instability of the interlayer could damage the interface between the active layers and interlayer, resulting in the degradation of OSCs under long term operation. However, as discussed in Section 2.3, the widely used bottom interlayer ETLs, like ZnO, in an inverted device suffering from its photocatalyzed ability; and HTLs, like PEDOT:PSS, in a conventional device exhibits strong acid and oxidization ability. The chemical reactivities of ZnO and PEDOT:PSS usually have negative effects on the stability of the active layer. Several studies solved chemical instability by modifying the existing interlayer or designing new interlayer materials instead of them. The photovoltaic stability characteristics of devices with different interlayers discussed in this section are listed in Tables 7 and 8.

Constructing hybrid conjugated polymer/inorganic nanocomposite interlayer is a possible method to modify the interfacial properties of ZnO as well as to improve the device performance in NFA-OSCs. Kim et al.95 used a sol–gel processed ZnO precursor containing poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz) to fabricate a hybrid ETL. The ZnO: PEOz hybrid ETL based device possessed better photo-stability compared with its pristine ZnO ETL counterpart. After 15 hours of illumination, the device with an active layer of PBDB-T: ITIC and ETLs of ZnO: PEOz maintained ca. 60% of the initial PCE, while the control device with neat ZnO ETLs only possessed less than 10% of the initial PCE. The enhanced adhesion between the PBDB-T: ITIC layer and ZnO: PEOz hybrid ETLs contributed to improved device stability. Vasilopoulou et al.96 applied lithium doped ZnO to reduce the electron extraction barrier and suppressed zinc interstitial defect sites, thus enhancing the device performance and boosting the stability of PTB7-Th: IT-4F based NFA-OSCs. The retained PCE of the ZnO: Li ETL based device was 81% of the original value, while the ZnO ETL based device only retained 60% of the original PCE after 1000 hours of storage. Besides polymer and inorganic materials, small molecule PDINO, a popular top ETL used in the conventional device was applied to improve the stability of the ZnO ETL in inverted devices reported by Zhu et al.97 The retention of PCE of the PBDB-T-2F: Y6: PC71BM based NFA-OSC increased from 70% to 80% of the initial value by using the ZnO: PDINO hybrid ETL instead of the ZnO ETL.
Surface passivation of ZnO was also used to improve the photo-stability of NFA-OSCs with ZnO ETLs. Zhan et al.98 introduced triethanolamine to passivate ZnO, realizing improved PCE and stability of the NFA-OSCs (Fig. 9a). The PTB7-Th: FOIC based OSC with triethanolamine capped ZnO ETLs preserved 99% of the initial PCE under illumination at one sun AM 1.5G light for 180 min, while the PCE of the devices with pristine ZnO ETLs decreased to 89% after the same irradiation. Li et al.99 provided a strategy for modifying ZnO with a self-assembled monolayer which could alternate the ZnO surface from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic, inducing electron extraction and avoiding photo oxidization of NFA blend films (Fig. 9b). The modified ZnO ETLs enhanced the photo-stability of the PBDB-T: ITIC based device with 70% retention of the initial PCE, while the ZnO without modification maintained only 35% of the initial PCE after under illumination at one sun AM 1.5G light for 180 hours. A similar self-assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy was applied to PTB7-Th: IEICO-4F based OSCs by Yip et al.,100 achieving great success in improving the stability of the NFA-OSCs (Fig. 9c). In that work, C60-SAM was deposited onto ZnO films and passivated surface hydroxyl groups, resulting in an ETL surface with low surface energies which strengthened the interfacial interactions between the ETL and BHJ active layer. The PTB7-Th: IEICO-4F device with ZnO/C60-SAM ETLs was exposed to illumination for 1800 hours with a negligible PCE loss. The T80 of ZnO/C60-SAM-contained NFA-OSCs reached 34000 hours, which is much longer than that of the control OSCs based on a pure ZnO ETL (2500 hours). Vasilopoulou et al.101 also proposed a small molecular decoration method to passivate ZnO and improve the photo-stability of the NFA-OSCs. Pyrene-bodipy dye (Py-BDP) was applied as an organic modifier on ZnO, acting as a physical barrier between ZnO and the active layer, preventing the active layer from photocatalytic reaction induced by pristine ZnO. The device based on PBDB-T-2F: IT-4F was exposed to illumination in air, and then Py-BDP improved the retention of the PCE from 41% to 70% after 9 hours of light soaking. Then, some polymers like poly-lysine and CP-I were designed to modify ZnO and improve both the thermal- and photo-stability of NFA-OSCs.102,103

Several alternatives of ZnO have been developed to solve the photocatalytic oxidation problem.104,105 Zhou et al.105,106 replaced ZnO by SnO2 in NFA-OSC devices (Fig. 9d). SnO2 is not UV light-sensitive because of a relatively wide band gap. The PBDB-T-2F: IT-4F based device with SnO2 as the ETL retained 89% of the initial PCE after illumination for 24 hours, while the PCE of the corresponding device with the ZnO ETL only retained 39% of the original PCE value. Nian et al.107 demonstrated aqueous-solution-processed organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) as an ETL in NFA-OSCs. OSiNDs can effectively reduce the work function of ITO, inducing good energy level alignment between ITO and the active layer. Meanwhile, OSiNDs possessed weak absorption in the wavelength between 300 and 400 nm and thus avoided serious photocatalysis of NFA blend films. PBDB-T-2F: Y6 based devices with OSiNDs as the ETL showed a retention of 96.1% of the initial PCE after 10 hours of irradiation, and in contrast, the device with the ZnO ETL only preserved 67.2% of the initial PCE under the same conditions. Meanwhile, PEI or PEIE can passivate the surface defects of ZnO and also replace ZnO acting as the ETL. However, the strong basicity of PEI or PEIE can damage the conjugated structure of NFAs. Some strategies were developed to neutralize PEI or PEIE to improve their stability as ETLs in NFA-OSCs. For example, Zhou et al.108 utilized the protonation method to passivate the reaction between the PEIE and the NFAs. When adding phosphoric acids into the PEIE ETLs, the PTB7-Th: IEICO-4F based device maintained over 68% of original performance after 116.6 hours of illumination.
PEDOT:PSS acting as the bottom HTL suffered high acidity and hygroscopicity, inducing poor stability of NFA-OSCs. Koster et al.27 used neutralizing PEDOT:PSS to fabricate PBDB-T: IT-F based devices and found the performance of the device to be decreased to ca. 10% of the original value compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS based counterpart device (ca. 70%), which indicated that neutralization may not be a probable method to improve the stability of PEDOT:PSS based devices. Li et al.109 provided a hybrid method to improve stability in PEDOT:PSS HTL based NFA-OSCs. MoO3 was introduced into the PEDOT:PSS HTL for oxidation doping of PEDOT:PSS, which reduced the intramolecular charge transfer effect between PEDOT units and the IC terminal groups of NFAs at the HTL/active layer interface (Fig. 9e). The hybrid PEDOT:PSS: MoO3 HTL prolonged the long-term shelf-stability of PBDB-T-2F: IT-4F based OSCs with the retention of PCE increasing from 37% to 50% after storage in the dark for 1920 hours, compared with the device based PEDOT:PSS HTL. Be different from modification of PEDOT:PSS, some studies developed new bottom HTLs to replace PEDOT:PSS, avoiding chemical reactions at the interface and improving the stability of NFA-OSCs.110 Anthopoulos et al.111 applied small molecular 2PACz as the HTL instead of PEDOT:PSS to increase the work function of ITO (Fig. 9f). Because 2PACz has a higher transmittance, the NFA-OSC with 2PACz HTL exhibited a higher PCE than the device with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. Meanwhile, the 2PACz based device can retain 74% of initial performance after 120 hours of illumination, which is over three times better than that of the PEDOT:PSS based device (20%).
Modification of widely used interlayers like ZnO and PEDOT:PSS can effectively improve the stability of NFA-OSCs. The inorganic materials, small organic molecules and polymers were applied to passivate the unstable acidic/basic interface, preventing catalytic activity and other chemical reactions of interlayers with active layers. Some successful methods, like ZnO/C60-SAM as the ETL, can improve the NFA-OSC operation stability up to 22 years according to estimated solar irradiance for China.100 These improvements indicate that designing and fabricating chemical stable interfaces is one of the promising routes to realize stable NFA-OSCs. However, most interlayers cannot survive from oxygen in air and moisture in environment because they are designed as water or alcohol dissolved, which means the degradation induced by interlayer is easy to happen when the encapsulation is broken. Thus it is necessary to design more stable interlayer in the future.
4. Conclusion and outlooks
In summary, the main factors that impact the stability of NFA-OSCs can be concluded as oxygen and irradiation, metastable morphology, and interfaces. In other words, chemical reactions happened in or on blend active films, induced by the photo-oxidation process between oxygen and photoactive materials or by the reaction between the interface and photoactive materials, irreversibly degrades the photoactive materials, forming defects in OSCs and inducing deterioration of OSCs. Meanwhile, the complex formation progress of blend films results in the unstable morphology of OSCs, conducing deterioration of OSCs. Photochemical stability, especially photo oxidization stability, is bound up with the structure of NFAs. Although some regularities in the photo-stability of NFAs have been revealed, there still exists a mismatch between the best stability and the highest performance of the NFA OSCs. Besides intrinsic chemical stability, it appears that molecular packing plays an important role in the miscibility and aggregation behavior. Several strategies like intramolecular non-covalent bonds, unfused conjugated cores, and asymmetric structures can improve the crystallinity and restrain the morphology variation under light or heat. The interlayer is another crucial factor for the stability of NFA-OSCs. PEDOT:PSS and ZnO are the most widely used interlayers but suffer from high reactivity with active layers. While some approaches have been studied, the universality and repeatability of these new methods and new materials are not investigated clearly. Although research on the stability of NFA-based OSCs is complex and difficult, as we have discussed above, there are some regular principles we can use to make a more reasonable design in enhancing the stability of NFA-OSCs.
Here we outline several promising strategies for design considerations of NFA-OSCs: (1) design photochemically stable materials (e.g., both donor and acceptor with deeper LUMO), which can be verified simply. Min et al.20 have systematically compared the photo-stability of NFAs and found some relationships between the photobleaching rate and molecular structures, however these strategies still lack practical and accurate guidance to solve the photo-degradation issue fundamentally. As discussed in Sections 2.1 and 3.1, multiple factors of structure designs can affect the stability of NFAs, which brings some inspiration to discover new NFAs with better inert stability and drives us to further construct detailed theoretical principles and practical approaches to prove the stability of NFA-OSCs. (2) Finely optimizing side chains, symmetry and planar structure of the conjugated core, and high crystalline end groups enable sufficiently high glass transition temperatures and robust morphology in blend films. Suitable miscibility between the polymer donor and NFAs with robust crystalline behaviour is crucial to realize effective exciton separation and transportation. Although many fabrication processes can regulate the morphology to achieve the highest efficiency of the BHJ devices, the mismatching morphologies between performance and thermodynamic equilibrium are one of the fundamental reasons for the low stability of NFA-OSCs. On one hand, stable morphology can be realized by designing NFAs compatible with donor polymers; on the other hand, it is easier to stabilize the blended phase in BHJ films by the third components, which is a promising method to improve the thermal-stability of NFA-OSCs. (3) Inventing stable interlayer with good adhesion and ability modifies the work function of electrodes. The effort on improving the stability of the interface is not enough. The bottom interlayer like PEDOT:PSS and ZnO with severe corrosivity to NFAs can be passivated or replaced by newly generated materials, while the reactions between NFAs and top interlayers like PDINO and MoO3 are not very clear. It is important to pay more attention to reveal the interlayer induced instability of NFA-OSCs.
Furthermore, stability test conditions like the light source, operation temperature, atmosphere, encapsulation, additives, evaluation time, and lifetime baseline are miscellaneous, which bring difficulties to enable comparison of different studies. A standard operation guideline has been proposed in 2011 named ISOS,12 which sets instructions for the stability test of OSCs under different conditions such as dark, indoor weathering, outdoor, and thermal cycling. However, few studies strictly abide by ISOS to test the stability of the device due to experimental limits. The further exploration in the stability research should standardize test procedures to accelerate the reliable studies of stability of NFA-OSCs. Meanwhile, the instability of NFAs during device fabrication is rarely considered which is a practical problem in industrial production and commercialization.20,54 It is necessary to realize fabrication under illumination in air for reducing the cost which means that photovoltaic materials should be stable upon exposure to ambient conditions. Thus, it might be reasonable to investigate the stability of NFAs in the solution and final device separately.
