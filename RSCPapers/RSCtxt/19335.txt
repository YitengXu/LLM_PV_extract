    , Accepted 6th November 2014First published on 6th November 2014AbstractThe solar-to-hydrogen generation from the TiO2–CdS–ZnS–MoS2 (TCZM) heterointerface was demonstrated. We found that a Pt-free CdS quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 mesoporous electrode with a metallic-type 1T MoS2 co-catalyst resulted in 0.11 ml cm−2 h−1 H2 fuel generation in unassisted potential mode, which was strikingly improved to 1.47 ml cm−2 h−1 under 1 V applied potential.
Energy generation from fossil fuel sources, foremost having issues regarding existing undesirable CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and depletion of resources from the earth, also expects a huge demand in energy consumption. Therefore, generating inexpensive, pollution-free fuels (hydrogen and oxygen) is a challenging task for mankind. Hydrogen (H2) is the easiest multisource component with regards to gaseous fuel or electron-rich precursors to liquid transportation fuel. Though hydrogen fuel generation from water using solar energy through an ‘artificial photosynthesis’ process was demonstrated four decades ago,1 recent energy demand fosters ‘solar fuel conversion’ as an emerging technology. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are also considered as a powerful tool in transforming solar light into hydrogen fuel with appropriate electrolyte and semiconductor electrodes.2 However, the challenging task in the PEC process is designing visible light semiconductors for trapping major fractions of solar energy with effective charge separation (e− and h+) at electrode/electrolyte interfaces.3
Recently, the combinatorial approach of assembling low-dimensional semiconducting ‘quantum-dots’ (QDs: CdS, CdSe, PbS, etc.) with wide band gap metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, and WO3) showed striking PEC H2 generation performance owing to the unique properties of QDs (high absorbance coefficient, multiple carrier generation and fast charge separation).4 In this line of study, new types of electrode architectures like the ‘quasi artificial leaf’, ‘panchromatic (QD/dye) sensitizer’ and ‘high light reflector’ explored with Pt counter electrodes realize QDs as a future candidate in PEC H2 generation.5 Conversely, in view of fabricating low-cost, Pt-free photocatalytic assemblies for hydrogen generation, a broad range of metal sulphides (CdS, CdSe, Cd1−xZnxS, Zn1−xCdxS, Zn1−xInxS)6 were explored in the form of solid solution; nevertheless only very few works were reported on electrode architecture.7 Despite the above-mentioned Pt-free metal sulphide photocatalyst systems showing feasible quantum yield, their performance is still inferior to the Pt catalyst systems. One of the prospective approaches is enhancing the catalytic active sites by implementing atomic scale layered co-catalysts on the photocatalyst assemblies. In this context, a thin atomic layer of MoS2 received great attention as a graphene-analogue layered transition metal dichalcogenide.8 The striking features of the edge-controlled MoS2 catalytic properties render its performance effective in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.8c,9 Previous studies on CdS/MoS2 in the form of a suspended photocatalyst endorse new pathways in MoS2 based solar fuel generation.10 However, limited internal surface area for dual functionality of the water oxidation (with sacrificial donor) and reduction process on the same CdS/MoS2 solid interfaces limits the solar fuel yield and necessitates implementation as a separate counterpart in the form of an electrode.
In the present work, we demonstrate the TCZM heterointerfaces in tandem electrode configuration and accomplish their solar-to-hydrogen fuel generation as illustrated in Scheme 1a. CdS/ZnS and CdS/MoS2 were assembled on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes and configured as photoanode and counter electrode, respectively. It can be envisioned that this approach may be employed in controlling the properties of each layer independently compared with one-pot synthesized powder-type samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that showcases the application of TCZM heterointerfaces in a tandem electrode configuration for solar hydrogen fuel generation. For further experimental details of preparing TiO2 mesoporous electrodes, CdS QDs sensitization and coating of chemically exfoliated MoS2 sheets on TiO2/CdS QDs refer to section S1 (ESI†) and the SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Under visible light irradiation (>400 nm), excitons (e−/h+) were generated in CdS and the electrons were transported to the charge collector through the TiO2 layer. Conversely, holes were scavenged by electrolyte species and produced H+ carriers in the electrolyte. Concurrently, the fraction of the light illumination transmitted through the photoanode will reach the TiO2/CdS/MoS2 counter electrode (CE) and perform an analogous function with the photoanode. Under unassisted bias condition, the photoelectrons collected from the anode will be directed to the CE side, where they will recombine with the photoholes at the TiO2 surface through the Z-scheme mechanism (Scheme 1b). The remaining photoelectrons generated in CdS (CE side) will be injected into the MoS2 co-catalyst and perform reduction of H+ ions into hydrogen fuel. The schematic photocatalytic mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 1b.

The TEM image of chemically exfoliated MoS2 is presented in Fig. 1(a), and it seems to have a two dimensional (2-D) few-layer stacked sheet-like morphology with a lateral dimension of ∼500–700 nm. At high magnification (2 nm) scale (Fig. 1b), a single layer of 2-D MoS2 exhibits biphasic crystalline structure with clear grain boundaries (see S3, ESI†). According to Eda et al.,11 the honeycomb lattice structure (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicates a trigonal prismatic (2H) and hexagonal lattice corresponding to octahedral geometry (1T). This clearly demonstrates that exfoliated 2-D sheets can produce atomically thin layers of the (002) crystal facet of MoS2. The lattice space values of the 2H and 1T layers were estimated using the fast Fourier transform and were found to be 0.30 and 0.26 nm, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Further, the (002) crystal facet of exfoliated MoS2 is confirmed from the predominant peak exhibited at 2θ = 14.4° in the XRD spectra and no other crystal orientations were noticed compared with bulk MoS2 (see S4a, ESI†). Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the HRTEM images of CdS QDs and 2D-MoS2 coated TiO2 at two different locations. It clearly implies that TiO2 exhibited an anatase phase with (101) and (004) crystal orientations and was confirmed through lattice space values of 0.35 and 0.23 nm, respectively. The crystalline structures of the TiO2 and TiO2/CdS QDs composite electrodes were further examined with XRD (see S4b, ESI†). Among the two crystal phases (2H and 1T) of MoS2 observed from Fig. 1b, only a 1T MoS2 layer was noticed on the TiO2/CdS QDs interface (Fig. 1c and d). Lin et al. explored the phase transformation of 2H to 1T MoS2 by the gliding of atomic planes during high temperature treatment; however, to confirm this in the present work more investigation is needed. Recent reports corroborate that the 1T MoS2 phase has the best performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen production with substantial stability in water medium compared to 2H MoS2.8c,12 Therefore, from Fig. 1(c) and (d), it is expected that 1T MoS2 layer-coated TiO2/CdS QDs interfaces may perform efficient photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. The elemental mapping at TiO2/CdS/MoS2 was recorded (Fig. 1(e)), which confirms the presence of Ti, O, Cd, Mo and S elements with uniform distribution.

The optical absorbances of pristine TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/MoS2 electrodes were evaluated from the Kubelka–Munk equation (F(R)1/2 = [(1 − R2)/2R]1/2) using optical diffused reflectance spectra (Fig. 2a). The optical absorbance edge of TiO2 at 380 nm is extended to ∼495 nm upon deposition of CdS QDs (4 SILAR cycles). Owing to their high absorbance, CdS QDs enhanced the optical density of TiO2 in this region. For 2 SILAR coated CdS cycles, the absorbance edge is blue-shifted to ∼450 nm due to the fewer CdS deposition cycles. A significant band edge of MoS2 (between 600 to 700 nm) is not observed in Fig. 2a.13 This may be attributed to a lesser quantity of MoS2 loading on TiO2/CdS QDs or to the metallic nature of 1T MoS2 not exhibiting a band gap as in exfoliated MoS2 solution (see S5, ESI†). It is noteworthy to discuss that the electrode geometry could influence the optical absorbance of the back electrode which depends on the light transmittance allowed by the front electrode (see S6, ESI†). In order to decipher the generic mechanism of visible light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen fuel generation from TiO2/CdS/ZnS/MoS2 (TCZM) interfaces, we explored the photoelectrochemical properties of this structure under dark and light conditions. Here, we used a two electrode based PEC configuration with TiO2/CdS(4 cycles)/ZnS as the photoanode and TiO2/CdS(2 cycles)/MoS2 as the counter electrode (CE) (see S1(d), ESI†). The aqueous electrolyte of 0.25 M Na2S with 0.35 M Na2SO3 as sacrificial hole scavenger was used for PEC experiments. The electrodes were illuminated with artificial solar light (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator with a 400 nm UV cut-off filter.

The resultant PEC performance of the TCZM CE is compared with the Pt CE in Fig. 2(b). At zero potential, the TCZM showed ∼0.8 mA cm−2 and is almost comparable to the performance of a similar photoanode configuration with Pt as the CE. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of these electrodes was estimated using the following equation:5b (1)where jsc is the short-circuit current, E° represents the thermodynamic reaction potential (0.21 V) for oxidation of the sacrificial agent (G = 38600 J mol−1), ηF is the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen generation under standard conditions and Ptotal is the incident solar irradiation (W m−2). The STH efficiency of the TiO2/CdS/MoS2 CE was found to be 0.45% and is comparable to a Pt CE-based system (STH = 0.44%). Comparing the conversion efficiency of the MoS2 catalyst to other previous reports on photocatalytic (PC) hydrogen generation, Zn0.8Cd0.2S showed a STH efficiency of 0.36% with a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) catalyst.14 This implies that the 1T MoS2 had performed as co-catalyst on TiO2/CdS(2 cycles) for generating hydrogen through the Z-scheme under unassisted bias. Further, by applying electric potential between the two terminals of TiO2/CdS/ZnS and Pt, the resulting photocurrent was found to be enhanced up to 2.2 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs. RHE. This indicates that the applied potential facilitates the charge separation process at TiO2/CdS interfaces by extracting the electrons away from the CdS conduction band to TiO2 and subsequently reach the CE terminal. In the case of the TCZM heterointerface, the applied potential enhances the Z-scheme process (Scheme 1b) and generates a higher photocurrent density of 5.7 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE, compared to the Pt CE (2.2 mA cm−2). This clearly evinces that photocurrent generation at the TCZM heterointerface depends on the charge separation process at the TiO2/CdS cathode interface and shows photocurrent generation competitive with the Pt CE. The photoexcited electrons in the CdS conduction band (CB) can reduce the H+ ions to hydrogen owing to their negative conduction band position. However, this leads to photocorrosion on the CdS surface. This undesired reaction was overwhelmed by the MoS2 co-catalyst layer, which protects the CdS layer from the water reduction process through modifying the CdS/electrolyte interfaces. The modification of the electrochemical TiO2/CdS QDs interfaces by MoS2 coating was analyzed using Mott–Schottky plots (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The flat band potential (Vfb) position of the TiO2/CdS interface was found to be slightly modified from 0.05 ± 0.03 V vs. RHE to 0.09 ± 0.03 V vs. RHE by MoS2. More positive values of Vfb position resulting from MoS2 coating indicate that the large band bending at the MoS2/CdS interfaces (depletion layer) facilitates the photoelectron flow from the CB of CdS to the electrolyte for catalytic reduction of H+ ions on MoS2 sites. Further, to examine the influence of the MoS2 coating on the TiO2/CdS interfaces the PL spectra were recorded (Fig. 2c). The emission band shoulder around 530 nm was noticed for the TiO2/CdS interface, which can be attributed to the band–band PL phenomenon of the CdS surface. This PL emission mostly originates from the sulphur vacancies of CdS which act as recombination centres for the photoelectrons.15 Under identical excitation power, the MoS2-coated TiO2/CdS interface showed higher PL emission. One of the plausible reasons for the enhanced PL emission is that the surface states at the CdS grain boundaries are reduced by the occupying MoS2.10b This suggests that MoS2 can effectively passivate the CdS surface.
The output gas product from PEC experiments was collected for one hour and examined through gas chromatography (GC). The output product was found to be hydrogen gas from the TiO2/CdS heterointerface and the quantity varies (Fig. 2d) with counter electrodes and the applied potential condition (see S8, ESI†). Under unassisted potential, the Pt CE showed almost a similar rate of hydrogen gas (0.13 ml h−1 cm−2) to the TCZM heterointerface (0.15 ml h−1 cm−2). In striking contrast under identical conditions, the TCZM heterointerface exhibited 1.47 ml h−1 cm−2 of hydrogen gas under 1 V vs. RHE applied potential, which is 150% higher than the hydrogen generated using Pt as CE (0.97 ml h−1 cm−2). This is in line with the J–V results shown in Fig. 2b, which ensured applied potential dependent hydrogen generation at the TCZM heterointerface. Another significant observation is that the electrode-based TCZM heterointerface maximises fuel generation even with less material consumption (MoS2 coated CdS QDs) compared to the earlier reports on solid state suspended photocatalysis. These results have significant implications in designing MoS2 co-catalyst based visible light semiconductor electrode architectures for hydrogen fuel generation with the aid of external bias from renewable sources (solar cells or solar batteries). The synergetic composition of 1T MoS2 with previously-reported CuS or CuO-based electrodes will be future Pt-free cathodes to QD-sensitized metal oxide photoanodes in search of effective photoelectrodes in quasi-artificial photosynthetic leaf.7,16
In summary, the 1T metallic type MoS2 nano-sheets were successfully assembled on a TiO2–CdS electrode. Under visible light irradiation, a TiO2–CdS–MoS2 electrode exhibits efficient co-catalytic performance in hydrogen generation in configuration with a TiO2–CdS–ZnS photoanode. This tandem electrode configuration (TCZM) showed higher hydrogen fuel generation of 1.47 ml h−1 cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE applied potential, which is 150% higher than when using Pt as CE. In addition, 1T MoS2 sheet passivation at the TiO2–CdS interface beneficially reduced charge recombination with the electrolyte through uncovered CdS sites on TiO2. Improving the photoanode counterpart with a highly porous network-based electron transport framework (fibers, inverse opal) in association with narrow band gap semiconductors as co-sensitizers is anticipated to enhance hydrogen fuel generation. Different-temperature processed 1T MoS2 are also expected to promote hydrogen generation through fine-tuning their catalytic activity through modifying their edges.
