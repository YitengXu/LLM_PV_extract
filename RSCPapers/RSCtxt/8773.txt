    , Accepted 2nd November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractA photocatalytic material, NiCo2S4@Ni2P, with a unique hollow core–shell structure based on hollow spherical NiCo2S4, which has a structure that is greatly advantageous for heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions, was successfully prepared. The unique hollow core–shell structure formed a homogeneous surface heterojunction, which caused the composite photocatalytic material to exhibit better photocatalytic HER activity and stability than the initial NiCo2S4 in the dye-sensitized system. The photocatalytic HER rate of the optimal photocatalytic material, NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%, reached 77.97 μmol h−1via the optimization of the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. XRD and XPS were used to study the crystal structure and valence state of the photocatalytic material, respectively. Additionally, its morphology and structure were observed by SEM and TEM, respectively. The CB and VB potentials were derived by combining empirical formulas based on the UV-vis DRS data. Finally, the photocatalytic HER mechanism was investigated by photoelectrochemical and PL tests combined with the above data.
1 Introduction
Photocatalytic technology for solar energy conversion is an effective and sustainable means for obtaining clean energy. Among the many clean energy sources, hydrogen energy has attracted wide attention due to its high energy density and non-polluting characteristics.1–3 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda realized that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred on a TiO2 photoanode under ultraviolet light.4 Since then, the use of semiconductor photocatalytic materials to produce clean energy, i.e. hydrogen, has been widely reported by researchers.5–7
Among the different semiconductor materials, transition metal sulfides have a suitable band structure and great visible light response, and thus these materials are widely used in photocatalytic HER such as CdS,8,9 MoS2,10,11 and others.12–14 Especially, bimetallic sulfide NiCo2S4 has attracted wide interest in the electrocatalysis,15,16 supercapacitor17,18 and other electrochemical fields due to its excellent catalytic effect and unique properties. Wang and Xiao reported that the electron density of NiCo2S4 nanowires could be modulated with the incorporation of nitrogen for the HER.15 It has been reported that an integrated flexible electrode NiCo2S4@g-C3N4–CNT was designed to study the synergistic effect between metallic sites and N dopants of bimetallic systems.19 However, NiCo2S4 has been reported less in the field of photocatalysis. In fact, NiCo2S4 has a suitable band edge, and thus its application in the field of photocatalysis needs further study.20
In the design of photocatalytic materials, the formation of a heterojunction between different semiconductors is an effective and common method to enhance the photocatalytic activity of materials.21 The premise of heterojunction formation is the effective contact between the surfaces of two semiconductor materials. However, common methods for constructing heterojunctions such as physical mixing, in situ hydrothermal method, and vapor deposition method are relatively random to load the co-catalyst on the surface of the main catalyst, and thus it is difficult to form a uniform and stable heterojunction. Nano core–shell structured materials have been widely used in heterogeneous catalysis, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and industrial catalysis, due to their unique properties.22–25 These materials can achieve uniform contact between the surfaces of the outer layer material and the inner layer material,26–28 which is a unique advantage in the construction of heterojunction.29–31 In addition, compared with the yolk–shell structure, hollow core–shell structure catalytic materials have a small bulk density and are more easily dispersed uniformly in the heterogeneous system, which is beneficial for the heterogeneous surface catalytic reaction.32–34
As a non-precious metal material, Ni2P possesses a relatively narrow band gap (Eg ≈ 1 eV),35 and thus it exhibits a unique metal-like characteristic. This property can effectively reduce the overpotential of the HER, and thus Ni2P has received extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis.36–40 In the field of photocatalysis, Ni2P theoretically cannot absorb enough photon energy for water splitting due to its narrow band gap. However, the electron enrichment effect due to its metal-like property makes this material an effective co-catalyst to reduce the overpotential of photocatalytic HER. This enhances the photocatalytic HER activity of the material to a great extent. Guo et al. reported that the photocatalytic HER ability of core–shell CdS@TiO2 is effectively improved due to the electron enrichment ability of Ni2P by loading Ni2P particles on its surface.36 As an excellent non-precious metal co-catalyst, Ni2P has broad research prospects in the field of photocatalysis combined with its unique electron enrichment characteristic.
Herein, hollow spherical NiCo2S4 was synthesized via the solvothermal method and applied for the photocatalytic HER. Due to its unique physical structure, this material exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties with EY sensitization. Accordingly, an Ni2P shell layer was further in situ grown on the surface of NiCo2S4via the solvothermal method to construct a hollow core–shell structure. On the one hand, the hollow core–shell structure is not only more suitable for heterogeneous surface photocatalytic reaction, but also makes the surfaces of the two materials uniformly contact, which forms a stable type-I heterojunction and effectively inhibits the recombination of charges and holes. On the other hand, the property of electron enrichment of the metal-like phase Ni2P reduces the overpotential of the photocatalytic HER. Simultaneously, the Ni2P shell provides protection for NiCo2S4, which inhibits the occurrence of photo-corrosion and improves its stability.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Eosin Y (EY), Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, CH4N2S, red phosphorus, and sodium acetate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Triethanolamine (TEOA) ethylene glycol, ethylenediamine and all of the above reagents were AR grade.
2.2 Preparation of samples

2.2.1 Preparation of NiCo2S4. 
NiCo2S4 hollow spheres were prepared using a previously reported method.41 Specifically, 1 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 2 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 5 mmol CH4N2S and 0.20 g sodium acetate were dissolved in 60 mL ethylene glycol. The mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined reactor (100 mL), and then naturally cooled after reacting at 200 °C for 10 h. The black powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h after being washed with deionized water (DW) and absolute ethanol.


2.2.2 Preparation of NiCo2S4@Ni2P. 
0.10 g NiCo2S4 black powder, a certain amount of red phosphorus and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were uniformly mixed in 60 mL ethylenediamine. The molar ratio of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O to red phosphorus was 1:5. NiCo2S4@Ni2P composite materials with different mass ratios were prepared by adjusting the mass ratio of NiCo2S4 to Ni2P. The amount of each substance added is shown in Table 1. The uniformly dispersed mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined reactor (100 mL) and reacted at 140 °C for 10 h, and then cooled naturally. The product was washed and dried as the previous methods.

2.2.3 Synthesis of bulk Ni2P. 
Further, bulk Ni2P was prepared using the same method as above. Specifically, 25 mmol of red phosphorus and 5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O without NiCo2S4 were added to 60 mL ethylenediamine and uniformly stirred. The reaction was carried out at 140 °C for 10 h. The product was washed and dried as above (Scheme 1).

2.3 Characterization
A Rigaku D X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was utilized to characterize the crystal texture of the powder samples, with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, 5° min−1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a ZEISS EVO 18. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples were taken using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% were performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (Al Kα). The optical properties of the different photocatalysts was studied using a Shimadu UV2550 UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV-vis DRS) with a BaSO4 background. The BET specific surface area (SBET) of the different samples was measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the different samples were obtained using a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax-4. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) data and fluorescence lifetime decay curves were obtained using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Data Station HUB with an LED diode emitting pulses as the excitation source (370 nm, 1 MHz repetition rate).
2.4 Photocatalytic HER activity characterization
The photocatalytic HER activity characterization was carried out using a Perfect PCX50B multi-channel illumination system to maintain the consistency of the reaction conditions. The light source was a 5 W LED lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The reaction was realized in a 65 mL quartz reaction flask. Specifically, 0.01 g photocatalyst and 0.02 g EY were dispersed evenly in 30 mL TEOA–H2O solution (10%, v/v, pH = 10) by ultrasonication for 15 min and the pH of the solution was 10. Before illumination, the air in the flask was displaced by nitrogen for 15 min. The gas in the reaction was analyzed using a Ruili SP-2100 gas chromatography with a 13× column and TCD detector (N2 carrier) and collected every 0.5 h. Finally, the photocatalytic HER activity characterization was continued for 3 h as a complete set of tests, and the stability experiment for NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% involved four complete tests. The new reaction solution was replaced to ensure that the initial concentration of EY and TEOA remained constant during each cycle of the stability tests. The aim of the stability tests was to study the intrinsic stability of the photocatalytic material.
The apparent quantum yield (AQY) experiments were performed using a 300 W xenon lamp with narrowband filters of different wavelengths (420 nm, 450 nm, 475 nm, 500 nm, 520 nm, and 550 nm). Specifically, 0.03 g of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% composite photocatalytic material and 0.06 g EY were uniformly dispersed in a 200 mL photocatalytic reaction flask containing 90 mL 10% TEOA–H2O solution. As in the previous hydrogen production experiment, the air in the reaction flask was replaced with nitrogen for 30 min before illumination. The gas in the reaction flask was collected every 30 min for analysis within 3 h. The above experiments were repeated after replacing the filter. The AQY calculation formula is as follows:  
2.5 Photoelectrochemical characterization
Preparation of working electrode: 5 mg powder photocatalytic material was uniformly coated on an ITO glass using 100 μL ethanol containing 10μL 5% Nafion, and the effective area of the working electrode was about 1.0 cm2. The electrochemical activity tests on the different photocatalytic materials were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Chen Hua CHI660E) in a three-electrode cell. The working electrode was a photoanode and 0.2 mol L−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution was the conductive medium. In addition, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode, and a Pt disk electrode was utilized as the counter electrode. A 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 420 nm) was used as the stabilized light source for the tests to obtain the transient photocurrent response curve (I–T) and the bias was 0.5 V. The scan rate of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was 10mV s−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst structure study

3.1.1 XRD tests. 
The XRD patterns of the different photocatalytic materials are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of NiCo2S4 has obvious diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.83°, 31.59°, 38.32°, 47.41° and 55.33°, corresponding to JCPDS Card No. 20-0782. This indicates that the cubic phase NiCo2S4 was successfully prepared via the solvothermal method. At 2θ = 40.70°, 44.6°, 47.31° and 54.23°, sharp diffraction peaks belonging to Ni2P can be observed. This indicates that bulk Ni2P crystal with great crystallinity was successfully formed in ethylenediamine via the solvothermal method. For the composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%, diffraction peaks belonging to NiCo2S4 (2θ = 31.59° and 38.32°) and Ni2P (2θ = 40.70° and 44.60°) can be observed in its XRD pattern. However, the diffraction peaks belonging to Ni2P at 2θ = 40.70° and 2θ = 44.6° are relatively diffuse compared with that of bulk Ni2P. This is due to the fact that the shell in situ formed by Ni2P coats the outer layer of NiCo2S4, and its crystal size is smaller than that of bulk Ni2P; thus, the diffraction peaks of Ni2P (2θ = 40.70° and 44.60°) are more diffuse than that of bulk Ni2P synthesized separately. Furthermore, the positions of the diffraction peaks of the (1 1 1) facet and (4 0 0) facet are close to each other, thus the diffraction peak corresponding to the (1 1 1) facet belonging to Ni2P overlaps with the diffraction peak corresponding to the (4 0 0) facet belonging to NiCo2S4. It further affects the peak shape of the diffraction peak corresponding to the (1 1 1) facet. In addition, the relatively low Ni2P loading (10 wt%) also makes it difficult to observe the diffraction peak of Ni2P in the XRD pattern of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. Thus, the above analysis shows that NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was successfully synthesized via the two-step solvothermal method. This material is crystalline and has relatively high crystallinity.

3.1.2 SEM and TEM analysis. 
As shown in the SEM image of NiCo2S4 (Fig. 2(a)), NiCo2S4 has a hollow spherical structure, and the diameter of the hollow spheres is about 300–500 nm. This indicates that NiCo2S4 with a hollow sphere structure was successfully prepared via the solvothermal method. As shown in Fig. 2(b), it is apparent that NiCo2S4 synthesized via the hydrothermal method has a solid spherical structure and a large particle size. Fig. S1 (ESI†) further indicates that the hollow spherical NiCo2S4 obviously has higher photocatalytic HER activity. This fully demonstrates the advantage of the hollow spherical structure in the heterogeneous photocatalytic HER. The hollow sphere structure effectively reduces the bulk density of the macroscopic photocatalytic material, which makes the photocatalyst disperse more uniformly in the reaction solution, and enhances the activity of the heterogeneous photocatalytic HER.

Fig. 3(a) shows the TEM image of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. In Fig. 3(a), it is obvious that NiCo2S4 hollow spheres are covered with an Ni2P shell, which makes the composite material exhibit a hollow core–shell structure. In Fig. 3(b), clear lattice fringes can be observed in the HRTEM image of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%, which also prove that the composite material has high crystallinity. The d-spacing between two adjacent lattice planes is 0.27 nm, which belongs to the (2 2 2) lattice plane of NiCo2S4. In addition, the lattice planes spacing of about 0.22 and 0.20 nm should be attributed to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 1) crystal planes belonging to Ni2P, respectively. The TEM and HRTEM images verify that the composite material is a composite of NiCo2S4 and Ni2P, and Ni2P is grown as a shell on the surface of NiCo2S4 to contribute a hollow core–shell structure.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping in scanning TEM (STEM) was used to further study NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM image of the composite material is displayed in Fig. 3(c) with the corresponding STEM-EDX elemental mappings. In Fig. 3(c), the strong signal of Ni, Co and S elements is attributed to NiCo2S4. The signal of the P element is uniformly distributed on the composite photocatalyst surface, which suggests that Ni2P is evenly coated on the outside of NiCo2S4 as the shell to construct the core–shell structure. In addition, the signal of the P element is clearly weaker compared with that of Ni, Co and S. This is owing to the very small Ni2P loading (10 wt%). The STEM-EDX mappings of the different elements further suggest that Ni2P coated on the surface of NiCo2S4via in situ growth, which further proves that Ni2P is not attached to the outside of the NiCo2S4 in a granular form, combined with the TEM and HRTEM images.


3.1.3 XPS analysis. 
The composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was further tested using XPS to analysis the chemical environment of its different elements. Fig. 4(a) shows the survey XPS spectrum of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. It indicates that NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% has the same elements, which is also consistent with the EDX mapping results. In Fig. 4(b), data calibration was performed using the C 1s binding energy at 284.6 eV. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the different elements were fitted using the Gaussian method. There are three double peaks in the region of Ni 2p. The peaks at 853.2 eV and 870.1 eV correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively. The spin double peaks present at the two sites indicate that Ni2+ is present in NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. Simultaneously, the sub-peaks at 856.4 eV and 875.2 eV indicate the presence of Ni3+. Further, the double peaks located at 861.3 eV and 879.5 eV are the corresponding satellite peaks. There are four sub-peaks in Co 2p, including two self-selecting split bimodal. Among them, the spin splitting peaks at 778.5 eV and 780.2 eV correspond to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. This indicates the presence of Co3+ in the composite material. Similarly, the double peaks at 794.8 eV and 796.5 eV indicate the presence of Co2+. The XPS experimental results are the same as previously reported for NiCo2S4,16,20 in which two different valence states of Ni and Co are present in the crystal lattice. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the S element mainly exists in the form of S2− (160.9 eV and 161.9 eV) in the composite material. S2− should be present in the lattice of NiCo2S4. In addition, the spin double peaks at 163.1 eV and 164.1 eV indicate the presence of a small amount of S22− ligand on the surface of the composite material.42 Simultaneously, the spin double peaks at 167.8 eV and 168.8 eV prove the existence of sulfate on the surface of the composite material. This is due to pyrolysis and oxidation of thiourea during the solvothermal process.43 The XPS fine spectra of the Ni, Co, and S elements together with the XRD patterns confirm that NiCo2S4 with high crystallinity was successfully synthesized. In the P 2p region, the obvious spin–orbit bimodal appear at 130.1 eV and 130.8 eV. According to previous reports, this exhibits that P element belonging to the Ni2P phase exists in the composite material.44 In addition, there is a peak at 134.3 eV, which is owing to phosphate on the surface of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%.35,36 The self-disproportionation of the phosphorus source causes this phenomenon in ethylenediamine. Some of the red phosphorus reacts with Ni2+ to form Ni2P and another portion to form phosphate. In addition, some of the red phosphorus is oxidized to form phosphate during the solvothermal reaction. The XPS results further display that the composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was successfully synthesized.

3.1.4 
            S
BET and pore size distribution analysis. 
The nitrogen adsorption isothermal (77 K) curves are displayed in Fig. 5(a). As shown in Fig. 5(a), NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% also have obvious IV isotherm characteristics with H3 hysteresis loops. However, for the bulk Ni2P, its isothermal N2 adsorption–desorption curve does not have a significant hysteresis loop. This indicates that both NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@Ni2P have a certain porous structure, while the bulk Ni2P surface only has a few pores. This is similar to the result shown in Fig. 5(b). Table 2 shows the specific surface area data for the different samples calculated using the BET equation. The pore volume and pore size distribution data were obtained from the BJH method. According to Table 2, NiCo2S4 has the largest SBET and pore volume, and bulk Ni2P has the smallest SBET and pore volume, which are the same as the results shown in Fig. 5(a). In addition, for the composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%, its SBET is significantly reduced compared to NiCo2S4 alone. When Ni2P is supported on the surface of the hollow spherical NiCo2S4 in a particulate form, the SBET of the material should be further increased. Thus, the relatively small SBET of the NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% composite material compared to the NiCo2S4 hollow sphere indicates that Ni2P is coated on the surface of the hollow spherical NiCo2S4 instead of being loaded on the surface of NiCo2S4 as particles. The results of the N2 isothermal adsorption experiments further verify that the composite NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was successfully synthesized.

3.1.5 UV-vis DRS test. 
In the UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 6(a)), NiCo2S4 has the highest light absorption intensity, and bulk Ni2P has the lowest light absorption intensity in the range of 200–800 nm. The composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% after Ni2P coating showed a slight decrease compared with the light absorption of NiCo2S4 alone, which further proves that Ni2P was successfully coated on the surface of NiCo2S4.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-vis DRS spectra of the different photocatalytic materials and (b) Tauc plots of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. 
The band gap values of the different photocatalytic materials were obtained using the Tauc plots based on the UV-vis DRS spectra. Fig. 6(b) shows that the band gap of NiCo2S4 is 2.50 eV, and that of the composite photocatalytic material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% is about 2.49 eV, which is similar to NiCo2S4. This indicates that the coating of Ni2P does not have a direct influence on the optical properties of the raw material.


3.1.6 AQY analysis. 
AQY was used to investigate the photoresponse of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% under different wavelengths of illumination in the EY sensitized system. As shown in Fig. 7, the reaction system exhibited the highest AQY at a wavelength of 520 nm, which is 2.64%. This is because the maximum light absorption wavelength of EY is 520 nm, which is similar to the previous report.45

3.2 Sample photocatalytic activity analysis of HER

3.2.1 HER activity optimization. 
Firstly, the effect of different loadings of Ni2P on the photocatalytic HER activity of the composite material was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the composite photocatalyst, NiCo2S4@Ni2P, had the highest HER activity when the loading of Ni2P reached 10%, and the amount of H2 evolved reached 233.92 μmol after 3 h (77.97 μmol h−1). This indicates that Ni2P is an excellent non-precious metal co-catalyst, which effectively enhances the photocatalytic HER activity of NiCo2S4 when it is uniformly coated on the surface of NiCo2S4. The photocatalytic HER activity of the NiCo2S4@Ni2P composite material improved with an increase in the Ni2P loading compared with NiCo2S4 alone. However, when the loading of Ni2P exceeded 10%, the photocatalytic HER activity of the composite photocatalyst began to decline. This indicates that the excessively high loading has an inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P. This is because the Ni2P shell formed by the excessive loading affects the photo-responsiveness of NiCo2S4, thereby attenuating the photocatalytic HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P.
 Fig. 8  (a) Photocatalytic HER curves and (b) photocatalytic HER rate of the different samples. 
The pH of the reaction solution has a significant effect on the photocatalytic HER activity according to previous reports.2 The pH of the original 10% TEOA aqueous solution was 11.18 and the photocatalytic HER rate of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% in this environment was 60.88 μmol h−1. Its photocatalytic HER activity was further optimized by adjusting the pH of the reaction solution. As shown in Fig. 9(a), when pH = 10, NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% displayed the highest HER rate. When the pH further increased, the HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% began to decline. Especially when the pH reached 12, the HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was significantly lowered in the strong alkaline environment. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the concentration of protons that can be reduced is lowered in an environment of excessive pH,46 thereby suppressing the photocatalytic HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%.
 Fig. 9  (a) HER rate of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% with a change in pH and (b) HER rate of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% with a change in EY concentration. 
Finally, the photocatalytic HER activity was optimized by adjusting the concentration of EY in the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the photocatalytic HER rate of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% exhibited an increasing tendency within a certain concentration range and then this tendency weakened. Especially the NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% composite photocatalytic material displayed the optimal photocatalytic HER activity with 20 mg EY added in 30 mL TEOA–H2O solution (about 0.96 mmol L−1). When the concentration of EY was lower than the unsaturated adsorption concentration of photocatalyst, the photocatalytic HER rate improved with an increase in the EY concentration. In addition, it is clear that an excessive concentration of EY reduced the photocatalytic HER rate. This is owing to the shielding effect of EY.47 Specifically, the free EY molecules in the reaction solution hinder the light absorption of the photocatalyst and EY molecules adsorbed by the photocatalyst. Only the EY molecules on the photocatalyst surface can provide electrons to the photocatalytic material after being excited, thus the shielding effect of the dye caused by a high EY concentration reduces the photocatalytic HER rate.


3.2.2 Stability study. 

Fig. 10 shows the results from the photocatalytic stability tests of NiCo2S4 and composite photocatalyst NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. On the one hand, the photocatalytic HER rate of NiCo2S4 exhibited a slightly decreasing trend during the stability tests. This is most likely due to the photo-etching of the transition metal sulfide under illumination. On the other hand, after four cycle stability tests, the NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% photocatalytic HER rate did not decrease significantly. This indicates that Ni2P effectively enhances the photocatalytic stability of the composite material compared with NiCo2S4 alone. The outer layer of Ni2P inhibits the photocorrosion of the inner layer NiCo2S4, which causes the composite material to have a higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency through the construction of a heterojunction, and further prolongs the service life of the composite material. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% before and after the stability experiments. In Fig. S2 (ESI†), the XRD pattern of the composite does not change significantly compared to the initial state after the stability test, which indicates that the crystal structure of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% does not change after prolonged illumination. This further demonstrates that the composite has great photocatalytic stability.

4 Photocatalyst HER mechanism of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% in EY sensitized system
4.1 PL experiments
The effect of the Ni2P shell on the photoinduced electron transfer of NiCo2S4 was investigated via steady-state PL experiments. Fig. 11(a) shows the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of TEOA–H2O solution (10%, v/v, pH = 10) with different photocatalysts (0.05 mg mL−1) and EY (1 × 10−6 mol L−1). As shown in Fig. 11(a), a high emission peak at 538 nm (480 nm excitation) can be observed when only EY (1 × 10−6 mol L−1) is present in the solution. When NiCo2S4 photocatalytic material was added to the solution, an emission peak appeared at the same wavelength, but the intensity of the emission peak significantly decreased. This indicates that the interaction between the excited EY molecules and the photocatalytic material NiCo2S4 produces the fluorescence quenching phenomenon.48 Furthermore, a lower emission peak was observed when the photocatalytic material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% was added to the solution. This fully demonstrates the cladding of 10 wt% Ni2P, which enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers to a great extent.
 Fig. 11  (a) Steady-state PL spectra and (b) fluorescence lifetime decay curves. 
The mechanism of fluorescence quenching between the different photocatalytic materials and EY molecules in TEOA–H2O solution was further studied by time-resolved photoluminescence. The relevant data was obtained by fitting the fluorescence decay curves of TEOA–H2O solution containing the different samples with EY in Fig. 11(b). As shown in Table 3, when EY exists in TEOA–H2O solution without the photocatalytic material, the decay curve conformed to the single-exponential fluorescence decay model under the excitation condition. This exhibits that there is only one fluorescent species in the TEOA–H2O solution. The lifetime of the fluorescent species is 0.116 ns. After adding NiCo2S4 to the solution, the fluorescence decay curve of the system could be fitted by the double-exponential fluorescence decay model, which indicates that there are two fluorescent species in the solution. This further exhibits that the presence of NiCo2S4 causes excited EY molecules to be dynamically quenched. In this system, the average fluorescence lifetime of the fluorescent species was extended to 0.124 ns. In addition, when EY and NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% coexisted, the average lifetime of the photoluminescence species in the system was further extended to 0.136 ns after excitation. The time-resolved photoluminescence test results show that the Ni2P shell on the surface of NiCo2S4 can effectively prolong the lifetime of the single-excited state EY. This is attributed to the formation of a heterojunction between the uniformly distributed Ni2P shell and NiCo2S4. The strong interaction between the in situ grown Ni2P shell and the surface of NiCo2S4 forms a heterojunction, which effectively extended the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and enhanced the electron transfer rate.

4.2 Photoelectrochemical tests
To further study the electron migration mechanism of the composite photocatalytic material, transient photocurrent response tests (I–T) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed on ITO glass with the different samples. Fig. 12(a) shows the I–T curves for the different samples. Under visible light illumination and 0.5 V bias, the presence of a photo-generated current was not observed in the ITO glass without any photocatalysts. It is clearly obvious that a significant photocurrent appears in Fig. 12(a) when the ITO with NiCo2S4 is the photoanode. Further, the photoanode of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% has a higher photocurrent density than NiCo2S4 alone. This indicates that the electrons on the surface of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% transfer more rapidly to form a stronger photo-generated current under illumination. The transient photocurrent tests prove that the outer layer of Ni2P distributed on the surface of NiCo2S4 effectively improves the transfer rate of photogenerated electrons.
 Fig. 12  (a) I–T curves and (b) LSV curses of the different samples. 
The LSV curves of the different samples are shown in Fig. 12(b). It is observed no significant cathode current appears in the individual ITO glass under a certain applied bias voltage. However, after coating a sample of the photocatalytic material on the ITO glass as a photoanode, the cathode current, which occurs due to the H+ reduction reaction, was apparent. Among them, the current density of NiCo2S4 and bulk Ni2P photoanode was significantly lower. When Ni2P was uniformly coated on the surface of NiCo2S4 by the in situ solvothermal method, the overpotential of the composite material was significantly reduced compared with NiCo2S4. The lower overpotential for the HER caused the NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% composite photocatalytic material to display a superior electrochemical H2 evolution performance. This is also consistent with the result from the photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment. The lower overpotential is also more conducive to the electron transfer of the composite, thereby effectively improving the photocatalytic HER activity of the material. The lower overpotential should be attributed to the metal-enriched effect of the metal-like Ni2P.
4.3 The mechanism of photocatalytic HER reaction
It is a widely accepted theoretical method to estimate the valence band and the conduction band values of semiconductor materials using empirical formulas.49,50 Accordingly, the conduction band and valence band values of NiCo2S4 and Ni2P were calculated using empirical formulas. (Detailed formulas and calculation process are given in the ESI.†) The results of the calculation show that the ECB and EVB of NiCo2S4 are −0.42 eV and 2.07 eV, respectively. The ECB and EVB of Ni2P are −0.23 eV and 0.42 eV, respectively.
Based on the photoelectrochemical tests, PL study and band gap calculation results of the different samples, combined with previous reports, the following photocatalytic HER mechanism for composite material NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% in the EY sensitized system was proposed. As shown in Fig. 13, the sensitizer EY initially reaches adsorption equilibrium on the surface of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%. Then EY absorbed on the surface of NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10% absorbs the photon energy. Subsequently, the singlet excited state EY1* is generated. However, the single-excited state EY1* is unstable and tends to transform into EY3*, which is more stable through spontaneous intersystem transitions.46 When TEOA as an electron sacrificial agent is present in the reaction system, EY3* is reduced by TEOA to form EY−˙ with strong reducibility.47 Simultaneously, TEOA is oxidized to TEOA+. Due to the strong reducing power and lower reduction potential of EY−˙, electrons are rapidly transferred from EY−˙ to the conduction bands of NiCo2S4 and Ni2P. This effectively reduces the conduction band potentials of NiCo2S4 and Ni2P, while EY−˙, which loses electrons again, forms EY molecules. Since Ni2P has a higher original conduction band potential (−0.23 eV) than that of NiCo2S4 (−0.42 eV), electrons further migrate from the conduction band position of NiCo2S4 to the conduction band of Ni2P, and holes are also transferred from NiCo2S4 to the Ni2P shell. Electrons and holes accumulate in the Ni2P shell layer, forming a type-I heterojunction on the surface of NiCo2S4. H+ is reduced to H2 by the aggregated photogenerated electrons on the Ni2P shell, while holes are consumed by TEOA on the Ni2P shell simultaneously. The formation of the heterojunction between Ni2P and NiCo2S4 effectively enhances the separation of the photogenerated carriers, and thus the composite material has more excellent photocatalytic HER activity than NiCo2S4 alone.

5 Conclusion
In summary, Ni2P with high crystallinity was uniformly distributed on the surface of bimetallic sulfide NiCo2S4via a simple solvothermal method to form a unique hollow core–shell material, NiCo2S4@Ni2P. Due to the hollow spherical structure of NiCo2S4, NiCo2S4@Ni2P has a smaller stacking density and better suspension in the liquid. This property is advantageous for heterogeneous surface photocatalytic HER. The Ni2P shell layer is in uniform contact with the surface of the NiCo2S4 hollow sphere to form a surface heterojunction, which effectively enhances the photocatalytic HER activity of NiCo2S4@Ni2P by increasing the degree of separation of photogenerated carriers and reducing the overpotential of the HER. In addition, the uniformly coated Ni2P shell layer also protects NiCo2S4 to a certain extent, which weakens the photo-corrosion phenomenon of the transition metal sulfide, and causes the composite material to have better photocatalytic stability.
