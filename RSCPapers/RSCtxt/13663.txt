    , Accepted 31st May 2014First published on 4th June 2014AbstractVertically oriented graphene (VOG), with graphene sheets perpendicular to the substrate, exhibits meritorious electrocatalytic properties due to the fully exposed graphene (or graphitic) edges and other plasma introduced defects, even without any heteroatom functionalization. We report the growth and electrocatalytic properties of VOG by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using methane and nitrogen as source gases. Nitrogen was adopted as plasma ancillary gas to obtain a higher plasma temperature that promotes VOG growth with better electrocatalytic performance, as comparative studies demonstrated. Electron transfer dynamics measurement using a Fe(CN)63−/4− redox couple found reduction and oxidation peak-to-peak separation as low as 70 mV, indicating rapid electron-transfer kinetics. The electrocatalytic activity of the VOG electrode on an I−/I3− redox couple was found approaching that of platinum. Using VOG as the counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.63% was demonstrated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic study further discloses the impact of VOG properties on DSSC performance.
1. Introduction
The development of sustainable technologies requires minimizing the consumption of precious materials and this is especially true for the development of cost-effective dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 a promising alternative to the semiconductor p–n junction based photovoltaic devices. Although the photoanode is the most critical component of a DSSC to determine the device efficiency, and has been under extensive investigation,2–8 the issues related to the platinum-based cathode must also be addressed. A typical design of DSSCs consists of a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode sensitized by dye molecules, a counter electrode (CE) as the cathode, and an iodide–triiodide (I−/I3−) redox pair based electrolyte. After interfacial electron injection from the photo-excited dye molecule into TiO2, the sensitizer must be regenerated through electron donation from the neighboring I−/I3− redox pair as a mediator; subsequently, the oxidized iodide ion diffuses to the CE and is catalytically reduced by acquiring an electron passing through the external circuit from the photoanode. Since the CE determines the reduction rate of the I−/I3− redox pairs, which further determines the regeneration rate of dye molecules, a material with high reduction activity is essential for the CE. Ideally, this material should possess a large surface area with enough active sites, low reduction overpotential and high electronic conductivity to minimize potential loss, and chemical stability for a long device lifetime. A nanoparticulate platinum film has been used for this purpose to achieve highly efficient DSSCs. However, substitution of platinum with earth abundant materials is essential for the development of sustainable and cost-effective DSSC technology. To this end, a variety of carbonaceous nanomaterials has been actively investigated.9–12
Graphene, due to its sharp edges with active bonds or intentionally functionalized in-lattice or out-of-plane heterobonds, possesses strong catalytic activity. It is generally argued that due to the large surface area with high-density active sites, high electronic conductivity, in addition to the abundance and chemical stability of carbon, graphene might be a promising candidate as the counter electrode material for DSSCs.13 In particular, the application of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets, due to easier production through liquid phase exfoliation, as the CE of DSSCs has been drawing considerable attention in recent years.14 However, the progress is not satisfactory considering that the resultant DSSC has a much smaller fill factor (FF) and hence a lower conversion efficiency when compared with cells using Pt-based CEs.15 This may be understood based on the following reasons: (1) the catalytic activity of RGO comes from oxygen-related bondings, while these heterobonds significantly diminish the electronic conductivity of graphene. A compromise must be made between conductivity and catalytic activity; (2) during drying of the randomly stacked RGO sheets formed by liquid phase exfoliation, the surface tension of the retreating liquid meniscus causes an individual sheet structure collapse into a “bulk” structure, significantly reducing surface area and active sites; (3) the superior electron transport property of graphene lies in its 2D plane, while in the electrode formed by laterally oriented graphene (LOG), electron must transport in the perpendicular out-of-plane direction, leading to a significant resistive loss; (4) the lateral orientation further blocks ion transport in the perpendicular direction from accessing the catalytic active sites on those RGO sheets lying in the deep; (5) long-term mechanical stability of the electrode is in question when a binder, which is highly resistive, is not used; (6) contact resistance between graphene sheets and metallic foil support is another issue. Although employing mixtures of RGO with other nanoparticles or nanowires16 or other composites17 may partially relieve these restrictions, an optimized approach to the design of graphene based electrodes in general, and the CE for DSSCs in particular, is greatly demanding. Very recently, a new format of graphene based electrodes, such as graphene nano-foam,18 nitrogen-doped graphene foam,19,20 graphene aerogel,21 and 3D honeycomb-like structured graphene,22 have been reported to overcome several issues related to the LOG structure. A vertically oriented multilayer graphene (VOG) film, directly deposited on a metallic foil by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is another format of graphene and it does not contain oxygen heteroatom.23 VOG has attracted great attention to develop ultrafast electrical double layer capacitors to work at hundreds to kilohertz frequencies.24,25 It is interesting to investigate its capability as the CE of DSSCs to overcome the above limitations of the LOG based CE. To this end, we report the electrochemical study and DSSC performance using VOG films as the CE for high performance DSSCs. Fig. 1 schematically compares electron and ion transport paths in LOG and VOG based CEs. It is clear that the above limitations related to the LOG based electrode can be eliminated by the VOG electrode. The large electronic conductivity of VOG in its vertical sheet facilitates fast charge transport with a minimum potential loss. VOG also possesses a large surface area to provide abundant active sites and a straightforward porous geometry to offer fast mass transfer of the redox species, essential for fast redox reaction. These merits of VOG ensure achieving an electrode with high electronic conductivity, facilitating ion transport and increasing the density of catalytic active sites, which will minimize potential loss, provide high rate iodine reduction for fast regeneration of dye molecules, and hence lead to a high power conversion efficiency.

In this work, VOG films were deposited on molybdenum (Mo) foils in a microwave plasma CVD (MPCVD) reactor with CH4 and N2 as source gases. Due to the very high growth temperature (>1200 °C), nitrogen atoms were not incorporated into the VOG lattice. Unlike the previous reports that the catalytic reduction of the I−/I3− redox pairs of graphene or RGO is mainly related to nitrogen or boron doping or oxygen-containing functional groups,18,19,21,26,27 our VOG films, without intentional dopants or functional groups, possess the catalytic function mainly due to the fully exposed sharp edge planes and other in-plane defects.23
2. Experimental section
2.1. VOG film preparation
A 1.5 kW microwave plasma CVD system from Seki Technotron was used for VOG sample deposition. It was found that a high substrate temperature (>1200 °C) is essential to achieve a high growth rate and a quasi-vertical sheet morphology, and therefore molybdenum (Mo) foil was selected as the substrate for VOG deposition in a gas mixture of methane and nitrogen. Introduction of nitrogen gas can significantly increase the plasma temperature. In order for the substrate to be directly heated to a high temperature by plasma heating, a thermal-insulating pedestal was used to lift up the 15 mm × 15 mm Mo substrates from the water-cooled substrate holder. All the source gases used, including CH4, N2, and H2, have a purity of 99.999%, with H2 gas further passed through a palladium-based hydrogen purifier. Prior to growth, the substrate heater temperature was ramped up and maintained at 650 °C. The substrate was cleaned using hydrogen plasma for 5 minutes with a hydrogen flow rate of 300 sccm, a chamber pressure of 30 Torr, and a microwave power of 1 kW. After that, the growth was carried out at a microwave power of 1 kW and a pressure of 45 Torr in a gas mixture of methane and nitrogen, with a methane flow rate of 50 sccm and a variable nitrogen flow rate of 100, 200, and 300 sccm. Correspondingly, the samples grown under these different nitrogen flow rates are called S1, S2, and S3. During the growth, the substrate heater was maintained at 650 °C, however, since the Mo substrate was kept on a thermal-insulating pedestal and intruded into plasma, the accurate substrate temperature was unknown. However, it did increase as the nitrogen flow rate was ramped up since higher nitrogen flow strongly increased plasma intensity. All growth lasted 30 minutes.
2.2. Characterization
The morphology of vertically oriented graphene was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Raman spectra were recorded using a Bruker SENTERRA dispersive Raman microscope spectrometer with an excitation laser beam wavelength of 532 nm. The chemical composition and bonding states were studied using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS).
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical study was carried out using an electrochemical workstation at room temperature. The electron-transfer dynamics study between VOG films and the electrolyte was conducted using the Fe(CN)63−/4− redox couple by cyclic voltammetry in an electrolyte of 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.25 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1). To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the VOG electrode as to an I−/I3− redox couple, the cyclic voltammogram of the VOG electrode was measured in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. A three electrode configuration was employed with Pt wire as the counter electrode and a non-aqueous reference electrode (ANE) as the reference electrode. The custom-made non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ reference electrode consists of glass tubing with a porous Teflon tip and a Teflon cap with a silver wire. Acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.01 M silver nitrate was prepared to fill the compartment (both the glass tubing and the Teflon cap). To assemble the ANE, air bubble trapped in the tubing was removed, and then the glass tubing was slowly inserted into the cap with a silver wire. The potential of the custom-made ANE was calibrated in a bulk solution made from acetonitrile containing a 2.5 mM ferrocene redox couple supported by 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). A three electrode configuration was used with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and a Pt disc as the working electrode. The measured redox potential of Fc+/Fc was +102 mV vs. ANE compared to the previously reported +87 mV by Pavlishchuk et al.,28 who also reported a potential difference of 542 mV between their ANE in acetonitrile and SHE. Thus, we determined that the difference between our ANE electrode and SHE is +557 mV.
2.4. DSSC fabrication
Dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated as detailed elsewhere.29 In brief, a thin compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on a cleaned fluorine-doped SnO2 glass substrate (TEC8), using 0.2 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in isopropanol by spray pyrolysis, followed by heating at 450 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films were deposited via the screen-printing technique using a paste of 22 nm sized TiO2 nanoparticles on a TCO substrate and then sequentially sintered at 325 °C for 5 minutes, 375 °C for 5 minutes, 450 °C for 15 minutes, and 500 °C for 15 minutes. This film was then soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes, rinsed with distilled water, and finally sintered again at 500 °C in air for 30 minutes. This film was then immersed in a solution of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) containing 0.5 mM [RuL2(NCS)2]:2TBA (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid; TBA = tetrabutylammonium; also known as the N719 dye) and 0.5 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for 15 h. The electrolyte was comprised of 1.0 M PMII (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) and 0.1 M GNCS (guanidinium thiocyanate) in a solution of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). The average TiO2 film thickness was about 10 μm as measured with a surface profiler (KLA Tencor Alpha-Step 500).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructure and composition of VOG films

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the three samples (S1, S2, and S3) under two different magnifications to show the surface morphologies. From the inset high magnification images, it can be noticed that all samples consist of quasi-vertically oriented multilayer graphene (MLG) sheets and the thickness (number of layers) varies from sheet to sheet in the same sample. Some sheets are much thicker, on which thinner sheets are nucleated, and all the sheets form an interweaved network. The low magnification images indicate that the nitrogen gas flow ratio during sample growth has great impact on the surface morphology. S1 has a relatively “smooth” surface at a large scale with a lowest sheet density; S2 has a cauliflower-type “particulate” surface with each “particle” consisting of closely packed interconnected sheets; S3 has a “cluster” structure, and in each cluster, there exists a few large (thicker and longer) sheets through which high-density small sheets are connected. These morphologies are similar to the morphologies previously reported by other groups.23,24 SEM cross-sectional images indicate that these three samples have a similar average thickness of ∼30 μm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), giving a growth rate of ∼1 μm per minute. We want to emphasize that from the film bottom to the top surface, many new branches of graphene sheets can nucleate and grow, and each sheet typically has a thick root and thin top with a gradually reduced number of graphene layers, or a tapering shape.

Although we do not have accurate temperature measurement during VOG growth, the estimation from an optical pyrometer indicates a temperature above 1200 °C, and the temperature increases as the nitrogen flow rate ramps up. The brightness of the plasma also indicates the increase of temperature. Since the temperature has a significant effect on the crystal quality of carbon graphitization, it is expected that for the three MLG samples S1, S2, and S3, in addition to the morphology and MLG sheet density difference, their crystal quality could also be different. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to characterize single and multi-layer graphene sheets. Fig. 3(a) presents the Raman spectra of these VOG samples. They were recorded under the same conditions using the 514.5 nm line of an argon laser with an excitation laser power of 5 mW and an integral time of 5 s. They all show the characteristic peaks of graphene at ∼1352 cm−1 (D band), ∼1586 cm−1 (G band), and ∼2705 cm−1 (2D band), in addition to a weak D′ peak on the right shoulder of the G band. This D′ peak, which is attributed to the graphene edge effect30 and typically not obvious for lateral graphene, is discernible for VOG due to the fully exposed graphene edges. Furthermore, the same edge effect causes the D band, the lattice-disorder induced phonon mode, to become obviously stronger than that of the typical lateral graphene. It should be emphasized that unlike for electronic applications, when graphene is used for catalytic function, a strong D band does not mean a low performance. In fact, for undoped graphene, a strong catalytic capability is attributed to its edge effect and other defects, and in this sense, stronger D and D′ bands indicate a better catalytic performance. Comparing the spectra of the three samples, they exhibit an obvious difference in Raman scattering intensity and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for their characteristic peaks. It suggests that the overall lattice quality of S3 is the best among these three samples in catalytic function.

Since the aim of this study was to investigate the intrinsic catalytic properties of VOG, to avoid the contribution from other functional groups related to heteroatom doping such as oxygen and nitrogen, the chemical composition of these samples was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Considering the detection limit of the instrument, the composition of the three samples was found to be the same with 0.9–1.0 at% oxygen adsorbates on the surface. Fig. 3(b) shows the representative XPS survey spectrum, with a strong C 1s peak at 284.6 eV and a very weak O 1s peak at 532.6 eV, in addition to an O KLL Auger band. The high resolution C 1s asymmetric peak is shown in Fig. 3(c), in conjunction with peak fitting to identify the different chemical bonds. Based on the common fitting method using the Gaussian–Lorentzian function, the C 1s peak can be deconvoluted into six peaks corresponding to the sp2 C–C bond at 284.6 eV, defect at 285.0 eV, the C–O bond at 286.6 eV, a weak CO bond at 288.1 eV, COOH groups at 289.7 eV, and π–π* shake up at 291.4 eV.31 In Fig. S2 of the ESI,† the O 1s spectrum is fitted with two Gaussian peaks, corresponding to the C–O bond centering at 531.8 eV and the CO bond at 532.9 eV. The chemical bonding analysis is consistent with data in ref. 23. Two striking points should be emphasized: one is that there is no detectable amount of nitrogen in the samples, even though these samples were grown in a plasma mixture with a high concentration of nitrogen, which is not surprising since at such a high growth temperature (>1200 °C) the chemical bonds between carbon and nitrogen are not stable, and hence nitrogen cannot be doped into the sp2 carbon lattice;32 secondly, the oxygen concentration in VOG is trivial. The growth chamber has a base pressure of 1 mTorr and high purity methane and nitrogen were used as source gases. It is believed that most of the trivial oxygen concentration detected by XPS is due to physical adsorption after exposing samples to air and these oxygen impurities probably are electrochemically inert. Therefore, it can be concluded that the electrocatalytic functions of these VOG samples are their intrinsic capabilities, not due to heteroatom or other functional group doping.
3.2. Electron transfer and electrocatalytic study
A facile electron transfer process between an electrode and the electrolyte requires a high density of electrons above the Fermi level in the electrode materials that have enough energy to transfer to a close redox pair. It is known that the edge plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite has an electrochemical reactivity several orders of magnitude higher than its basal plane due to a large amount of defects at the edge that produce a high density of defect states near the Fermi level. Due to the high density of MLG with fully exposed edges, and further considering that even though some sheets are too thick to be called graphene, their vertically tapering shape reveals many steps or edges of each atomic layer. These atomic edges or steps are the potential adsorption sites of redox species in the electrolyte and sites of electron transfer. In addition, plasma bombardment may also introduce a large amount of defects in the basal plane that further enhance the catalytic capability. Therefore, with such a morphology and high density of defects at the edge or in the plane, VOG films, even without any heteroatom doping, may also possess useful electrocatalytic capability.
The electron-transfer reaction between VOG films and the electrolyte was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in an electrolyte of 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.25 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1). A Fe(CN)63−/4− redox couple was used since it has been extensively employed to study the electron transfer dynamics of different carbon allotropes, including graphene. Fig. 4(a) presents the cyclic-voltammograms (C–V) of VOG S3 at different scan rates from 20 to 200 mV s−1 (the C–V profiles for S1 and S2 are plotted in Fig. S3 of the ESI†). Fig 4(b) compares the C–V profiles of these three samples at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrochemical measurements indicate that all the samples exhibit a perfect reversible response, a characteristic of VOG electrodes with rapid electron-transfer kinetics; however, the reduction and oxidation peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of these samples is different. For S1, Epp is in the range between 108 mV and 189 mV, while for both S2 and S3, this value is similar, from 70 mV to 100 mV, depending on the scan rate. Fig. 4(c) shows the anodic and cathodic current density as a function of the square root of scan rate for the three samples, with S3 displaying the highest current density. The obtained linear relationship between the current density of electrodes and the square root of the scan rate is in agreement with the modified Cottrell equation (j = ks1/2, where s is the scan rate and k is the collection constant determined by the electrochemical system), which provides evidence for the diffusion controlled electrochemical reaction and fast electron transfer at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Our measured small values of Epp, especially for S2 and S3 at low scan rates, reveal that these samples can provide facile electron transfer to and from the electrolyte. This is because in this single-electron Nerstian process with the reaction rate controlled by the electrolyte diffusion, Epp is correlated with the electron transfer coefficient, and single-electron reaction has an ideal value of 59 mV. As emphasized above, these VOG samples have no heteroatom functionalization, and their electrocatalytic capability is due to the large density of fully exposed graphene edges and in-plane defects. On the other hand, the physical property differences in morphology, graphene sheet density, and crystalline quality of the three samples, due to the growth condition variation, are accompanied by electrocatalytic performance disparity, reflected by peak-to-peak potential separation and electrode current density. These electron transfer dynamic study results suggest that S3 would be the best counter electrode for DSSCs for I−/I3− reduction and S1 would be comparatively the worst counter electrode.
 Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the S3 electrode in the 0.25 mM ferrocouple electrolyte with different scan rates from 20–200 mV s−1; (b) comparison of C–V profiles of S1, S2 and S3 at the same scan rate of 50 mV s−1; (c) anodic and cathodic peak current density as a function of the square root of scan rates for S1, S2 and S3. 
This is confirmed by the I−/I3− redox reaction study. To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the VOG electrode on the I−/I3− redox couple, the cyclic voltammogram of each VOG electrode was measured in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. This solution has a much lower concentration than the typically used electrolyte of the DSSC to clearly resolve the redox peaks. Three-electrode configuration was employed for this measurement with Pt wire as the counter electrode and a non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (ANE) as the reference electrode. Fig. 5 presents the C–V profiles of the VOG electrode for I−/I3− redox study. In addition to the three VOG samples, the platinized FTO electrode that is commonly used as the counter electrode of DSSCs is also measured for comparison. Two pairs of redox peaks were observed for all samples. The relative positive and negative pairs can be assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3− and I3−/I−, respectively.14,19 Since the reduction of I3− to I− is the actual reaction occurring at the counter electrode in a DSSC, our analysis is focused on the negative pairs. The peak to peak separation (Epp) values for the three VOG electrodes of S1, S2 and S3 were found to be 708 mV, 599 mW, and 552 mV, respectively, indicating that the electrocatalytic capability of S3 was the best. This is in consistence with the above electron-transfer dynamic study results. However, the Epp value of S3 (552 mV) is still higher than that of the platinized FTO electrode (477 mV), suggesting a relatively lower redox reaction rate by comparing VOG with platinized FTO. On the other hand, the porous structure of VOG samples gives them much larger apparent surface area and active catalytic sites, leading to a higher current density than the platinized FTO electrode.

3.3. DSSC characterization
We examined the effectiveness of using VOG as counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs based on different VOG samples (S1, S2 and S3). The J–V characteristic of a standard DSSC using the Pt counter electrode is also shown as a reference for comparison. The details of the photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF, and η) for all these cells are given in Table 1. When S1 was used as a counter electrode, the cell displayed an efficiency of 4.17% with a fill factor of 0.365. The cell performance improved from 4.17% (S1) to 5.58% (S2) to 7.63% (S3), resulting primarily from an improved fill factor from 0.365 (S1) to 0.494 (S2) to 0.665 (S3). As shown in Table 1, the device performance of the best, S3-based, cell is slightly inferior to that of the Pt-based DSSC. The increase of fill factor is consistent with the better catalytic properties of different VOG samples as shown and discussed above.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to understand the effect of different counter electrodes on the charge transfer kinetics at the counter electrode. Fig. S4 in the ESI† shows the typical impedance spectra of VOG-based DSSCs measured at two different bias voltages at open circuit under illumination. From EIS study, two features of the impedance response can be identified: (1) a large semicircle at low frequencies (approximately <10 Hz), which corresponds to the back charge-transfer process at the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface with a recombination resistance Rct and (2) a small semicircle at high frequencies (approximately >30 Hz), which is associated with the charge-transfer process at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface with a charge-transfer resistance Rp. Normally, there is a linear region with 45° slope at medium frequencies, which is characteristic of the transmission line model and can be used to derive the transport resistance of the TiO2 electrode. However, this feature is not obvious in the current study. This would not affect our understanding on the charge transfer kinetics at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. It is evident that Rct decreases with increasing bias voltage, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies.33 In contrast, the small semicircle associated with charge-transfer at the counter electrode does not change significantly with the bias voltage. Analysis of the impedance spectra indicates that the Rp value decreases from about 153 Ω to 81 Ω to 53 Ω for the three samples S1–3. Smaller charge-transfer resistance corresponds to a faster kinetics. These impedance results are consistent with the impact of the nitrogen flow rate on the morphological changes and electrochemical studies of the VOG films as discussed above.
4. Conclusions
This study demonstrated that VOG films grown by MPCVD at high temperature, with their fully exposed graphene edges that produce a high density of defect states, in addition to the in-plane defects, exhibit superior intrinsic electrocatalytic properties. Comparative studies found that as the growth temperature increased due to the nitrogen ratio increase in the source gas, the structure and electrocatalytic properties of VOG changed. Electron transfer dynamics measurement found that VOG electrodes can provide rapid electron-transfer kinetics, while the electrocatalytic activity study indicated that the reduction activity of VOG on the I−/I3− redox couple can approach that of platinum. Using VOG as counter electrodes for DSSCs, a power conversion efficiency of 7.63% was demonstrated. This study suggested that VOG has the potential as a promising electrocatalyst to replace Pt for DSSCs and other applications.
