    , Accepted 12th December 2022First published on 19th December 2022AbstractPerovskites based on CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have promising applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. In this paper, the phase stability of inorganic metal halide perovskite CsPbCl3 under hydrostatic pressure and anion substitution is studied using density functional theory (DFT), and this modification is explained by the interaction of the octahedrons and transformation of the bond-orbital coupling. In addition, two space groups, P4/mbm and Amm2, which are stable under stress, are subjected to anion substitution; then, the structural stability and band gap change of CsPbCl3−yXy (X = Br, I; y = 0, 1, 2, 3) are analyzed after applying stress; finally, the electronic structures and optical properties of the six most stable components are presented. The effect of stress and anions on the components’ optoelectronic properties is closely linked with the crystal's structural alteration mechanism. These results show that stress and anion modulation can significantly change the optoelectronic properties of materials, which make these materials have broad application prospects. Furthermore, stress can be used as an effective tool for screening the most stable material structure.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite materials have attracted significant attention because of their extraordinary optoelectronic properties, including broad absorption spectra, enhanced optical absorption, tunable band gaps, extended charge diffusion, high charge carrier mobility, and a low carrier effective mass, which make them attractive for use in solar cells.1,2 Most of the perovskites that perform well are composed of plumbum (Pb). These metal halide perovskites are inexpensive and abundant on Earth. Therefore, halide perovskite semiconductors are more suitable for solar cells than silicon-based photovoltaic technologies.3 Researchers have confirmed that these perovskite materials have wide applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, and solar electronic devices.4,5 The power conversion efficiency of solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 25.6% since the first metal halide perovskite solar cells were reported.6–8 Most solar cells with a high-power conversion efficiency adopt organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA) and formamide (FA). Despite the increased work conversion efficiency, their commercial application has many limitations due to the volatility of organic components and poor thermal stability at high temperatures. When perovskites are used as photovoltaic absorbers, the organic components have little effect on perovskites. The PbX3 framework mainly determines the charge carrier mobility and lifetime. All inorganic perovskite materials have been extensively studied to solve the problem of the poor stability of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material MAPbX3 (MA = methylammonium; X = Cl, Br, I). A series of perovskite crystals with a high stability, such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), has been developed by replacing MA + ions with cesium ions.9–11
The band gap of perovskites is significant for evaluating the ability to absorb light in the solar spectrum. It can be adjusted in several ways: temperature-induced phase transitions,12 hydrostatic pressure applications, chemical modification,13 and metal doping. B-site metal cation doping is typical for metal doping and substitution, such as Cu2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Sb3+, Ce3+, and Bi3+.14–16 These dopants also change the band gap of metal halide perovskites. However, it is often difficult to synthesize experimentally because the doping ratio cannot be too high,17,18 and the regulation of the band gap is limited. The application of pressure is a green and facile method to achieve wide-range band gap adjustment.19 It shows great potential in the engineering of photovoltaic (PV) perovskites. Previous calculations have shown that many halide perovskite systems undergo structural changes at high pressures and result in exotic properties, such as band gap modulation.20 Squeezing halide double perovskites leads to enhanced emission. In addition, the phase transition of CsPbI3 at high temperatures can be achieved by using pressure to adjust the octahedral inclination of the high temperature perovskite phase, which is beneficial to maintaining the structure under environmental conditions, resulting in a more stable perovskite configuration.3
In higher order optics research, researchers are most interested in the modulation engineering of the optical band gap (Eg) and the definition of the structure evolution with pressure. For 3D perovskites, the most studied systems are MAPbX3 compounds, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, and CsPbBr3,16 and some common (high-pressure) HP characteristics of Eg have been observed. In particular, the band gap is first red-shifted and then blue-shifted. If found within a few gigapascals, the blue shift is usually associated with a structural phase transition to a more distorted crystal structure.14,21 This trend is widely accepted, and it is believed that the shortening of the Pb–X bond length caused by the first redshift leads to an increase in the orbital coupling. The blue-shift transition comes from a more distorted octahedral structure, which is connected to the Pb–X–Pb bond angle to bend and reduce orbital coupling.22,23 In addition, some researchers have found that anion substitution (X = Cl, Br, I) can significantly change the lattice parameters. The structural transformation brought about by the difference in the polarity of the anion results in a massive change in the optical properties, thus realizing the band gap adjustment.24–28 However, because there are few studies on this subject, the band gap adjustment range is not known, and there is no good solution to the stability of these structures. The influence mechanism of the phase transition on electronic structure and optical properties under this condition is not clear.
Therefore, we propose that stable compounds with suitable optoelectronic properties can be screened under the combined effect of a wide range of stress (hydrostatic pressure and tensile force) and anionic substitutions (X = Br, I); we discuss their phase transition mechanism and the relationship between their electronic structure and optical properties. In this work, four defect-free CsPbCl3 compounds were used: one with a tetragonal structure, P4/mbm (a = 7.968 Å, c = 5.811 Å); one with an orthorhombic structure, Amm2 (a = 8.086 Å, b = 8.086 Å, c = 5.764 Å); one with a cubic structure, PMM (a = 5.734 Å); and one with a trigonal structure, R32 (a = 5.732 Å).29 The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1. The first-principles calculation system was used to examine the effects of large-scale stress on the stability of the four structures and the evolution of the band gap properties. The stress models were all simulated by scaling factors that changed the lattice constants. Then, anion substitutions were performed on the two most stable space groups, P4/mbm and Amm2, in the theoretical environment, and the relationship between the electronic structure and optical properties of CsPbCl3−yXy (X= Br, I; y = 0–3) and the stress was also investigated. The stable compounds with an excellent performance were selected for application in high-performance solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Computational methods
The first-principles calculation used the plane wave pseudopotential30,31 implemented in the VASP code to optimize the geometric structure of the crystal and find the minimum energy (stable) position. The crystal exhibited its actual properties in stable positions. The geometry optimization was carried out by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is a form of the GGA functional for exchange–correlation interactions.32 The total energy was obtained by the self-consistent solving of the Kohn–Sham equation. In all our calculations, the plane wave cut-off energy of the halide perovskite was 500 eV, all structural high symmetry points (k-points) were generated using Vaspkit,33 the structure was optimized and the accuracy was (0.03) × 2π Å−1 using the Gamma Scheme, and the optical properties were calculated with an accuracy of (0.015) × 2π Å−1. All structures were fully relaxed using the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state until the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. In finite strain theory, stress is modeled by applying a uniform set of strains (a scaling factor of the lattice constant) to relax the freedom of the atoms, thereby calculating the resulting external stress.34 The anion positions are kept consistent and randomly selected on the main phase, and reasonable calculations show that changes in the anion atomic positions in the monomer do not change the final gap values and energy band structure when the anion atomic density ratio is constant.27
As described in the literature, the density functional theory (DFT) PBE yields an apparent underestimation of the band gap calculations compared to experimental measurements. Spin–orbit coupled GW quasiparticle correlation (soc-GW) and HSE-SOC are advanced, computationally expensive methods that are accurate for band gap calculations.35 However, DFT-PBE is still valid for the discussion of this work. This is because the soc-GW and HSE-SOC neither change the band-edge orbital properties nor the band gap position in k-space compared with the band structures calculated by DFT-PBE. Therefore, DFT-PBE can qualitatively describe the evolution of the band gap properties under stress.19,36
Results and discussion
Stress regulation of CsPbCl3
First, the evolution of the structure and band gaps of four different structures of CsPbCl3 (P4/mbm, Amm2, PMM, and R32) under stress was investigated. We used scaling factors for scaling down and scaling up the lattice constant to simulate the hydrostatic pressure and tensile force. The calculation results show that the most stable structures, P4/mbm, Amm2, and PMM, are all direct band gap semiconductors, and only R32 is an indirect semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 2a, their band gaps gradually decrease with the increasing hydrostatic pressure and increase with the increasing tensile force. The band gap size is an important measure of the ability of a substance to absorb light. The experimental results of Zhang et al. show that the first absorption edge of CsPbCl3 red-shifts and blue-shifts (corresponding to the decrease and increase of the band gap) as the applied pressure increases,37 and also a similar experimental phenomenon was found by Jing et al.38 The above experiments are consistent with our calculation results. For the same lattice constant scale factor, the mutation of the band gap of PMM and R32 structures is the most obvious, changing from 1.51 eV to 2.60 eV and from 1.69 eV to 2.59 eV, respectively. The maximum mutation value is close to 1.1 eV. The band gap evolution of the other two structures, P4/mbm and R32, is not so significant under the same set of strains, which may be related to their structural stability. To study the effect of stress on the stability of the four CsPbCl3 types, the formation energy of CsPbCl3 was calculated using the following equation: Ef = E0 − μCs − μPb − μCl(1) (2)In this equation, E0 is the total energy of CsPbCl3, μCs is the Cs atomic energy, μPb is the Pb atomic energy, μCl is the Cl atomic energy, and E(Cl2) is the Cl2 molecular energy.
 Fig. 2  (a) Variation of the band gap with stress for the four structures of CsPbCl3: the solid shapes represent the direct band gap, and the hollow shapes represent the indirect band gap. (b) Variation of four structure formation energy of CsPbCl3. 
As shown in Fig. 2b, under the same strain conditions, the formation energy of structure R32 is comparable to that of PMM but more extensive than that of P4/mbm and Amm2. In other words, the structure of P4/mbm and Amm2 is generally more stable. In addition, the lattice constant scaling factor 0.99 is used as a cut-off point. Below the lattice constant scaling factor 0.99 (hydrostatic pressure), Amm2 is more stable than P4/mbm structure, and above the lattice constant scaling factor 1.00 (tensile force), P4/mbm is more stable than Amm2 structure, which indicates that the structural stability trends of these two structures under hydrostatic pressure and tensile force are not the same.

Fig. 2a shows that the band gap of the Amm2 structure is higher than that of the other three structures in the whole strain range, which is related to its unique orthorhombic structure. In addition, when the scale factor of the lattice constant is 0.95, the Amm2 structure changes from a direct band gap to an indirect band gap. The band gap value of the structure P4/mbm changes very slowly under the tensile stress. When the scale factor is 1.03–1.05, the band gap value first blue-shifts and then red-shifts. The band gap change of the structure R32 suddenly slows when the scale factor is 0.98–0.97, while the band gap decreases sharply when the scale factor is 0.97–0.95. More interesting is the indirect–direct–indirect–direct mutation of the band gap when the scale factor is 1.01–1.05. Compared with direct semiconductors, indirect semiconductors tend to have longer carrier lifetimes because the electrons generated by light energy cannot be directly separated from the conduction band (CB) to the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor, which is beneficial to improving the photovoltage.39
The most stable band structures of Pb/mbm and Amm2 under stress are plotted in Fig. 3a and b, where the dashed line represents the Fermi level. According to the semi conductivity theory, the surrounding band of the Fermi level is crucial to the physical properties of solid matter. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the structure Pb/mbm and structure Amm2 are located at the high symmetry point Z, indicating that both structures have direct band gaps with values of 2.39 eV and 2.42 eV, respectively. Fig. 3c and d show the partial wave density of states (PDOS) corresponding to the structure Pb/mbm and structure Amm2. It was found that only the Pb and Cl orbitals contribute to CBM and VBM for these two inorganic perovskite materials. Their VBM is the antibonding hybridization between Pb 6s and Cl 3p orbits. The CBM is affected by the Pb 6p and Cl 3p orbits, where the Cl 3p orbit only accounts for a small proportion. The interaction between the Pb and Cl orbitals in the valence band (VB) is powerful. The change of the band gap is due to the application of the hydrostatic pressure, which causes the entire CB to shift significantly; on the contrary, the whole CB moves up obviously with the increase of the tensile force, while the valence band moves much less than the conduction band. The absolute shift of the CB corresponds to the increase and decrease of the band gap.

Anion substitution
As shown in Fig. 2b, two relatively stable structures, the tetragonal structure P4/mbm and the orthorhombic structure Amm2, were selected for anion substitution, in which the general structural formula is CsPbCl3−yXy (X = Br, I; y = 0–3). The first-principles calculations were performed using the DFT-PBE under stress. In addition, the lattice constant scaling factors for the hydrostatic pressure and tensile force were determined by the most stable structure (the location of the lowest energy). In view of the previous study of the band gap variation trend under a wide range of stress (see Fig. 2), the stress after each anion substitution was limited to a relatively small range, considering the constraints of computational cost. In addition, in order to study the difficulty of anion substitution, the formation energy of anion y (y = Br, I) substitution was calculated using the following equations: Ef = ED − E(host) − [yμx − (3 − y)μCl](3) (4)here, ED is the total energy after the anion substitution, E(host) is the total energy of the intact structure, μx is the Br or I atomic energy, and E(x2) is the total energy of the corresponding gas molecules.
From Fig. 4a and c, it can be seen that the Cl, Br, and I formation energy increases sequentially, and the stability gradually decreases. Some researchers reported the best stability of CsPbCl3 in thermodynamic stability tests, followed by CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 is more prone to phase transitions,40–42 which is also consistent with the conclusion of our calculations. This is because the coupling polarity of Cl is the strongest, followed by that of Br, and that of I is the weakest, and the difference between the formation energies of CsPbCl2I and CsPbBr3 is minimal. In addition, under the same composition, the most stable main phase of CsPbCl2Br and CsPbI3 is the tetragonal structure P4/mbm. The main phase structure of CsPbClBr2, CsPbBr3, CsPbCl2I, and CsPbClI2 is the orthorhombic structure Amm2 (see Table 1). Fig. 4b and d show the band gap change diagrams under the combined action of anion substitution and stress, indicating that the anion substitution decreases with the band gap value of Cl, Br, and I, and the effect of stress on the band gap change is similar to the previous one, with the maximum mutation value close to 0.8 eV. There are some studies showing that with the order of substitution of Cl, Br, I, the absorption edge and PL emission peaks are sequentially red-shifts, where CsPbI3 has a significant light absorption coefficient, and our calculations also explain these works theoretically.40,43 Under the combined action of anions and stress, the desired band gap value can be adjusted more easily and the absorption band can cover the entire visible light band, or potentially even more.

In addition, Fig. 4b shows that the band gap suddenly increases when the scale factor of the lattice constant of CsPbCl2I is 1.03 (the scale factor of the stable structure is 1.04). It is the same as the changing trend of the applied tensile force, which may be related to the more severe structural distortion of the structure under the hydrostatic pressure. For CsPbClI2, shown in Fig. 4d, there is an indirect band gap both in the theoretical environment and under tension (the corresponding lattice constant scale factors are 1.08 and 1.09, respectively). However, after applying the hydrostatic pressure (the lattice constant scale factor is 1.06), it suddenly becomes a direct band gap, and the band gap is raised. This indicates that stress can be used as a cleaning tool to adjust the band gap type, which can compensate for the performance loss caused by other approaches, such as doping substitution.

Fig. 5 and 6 show the band and PDOS structures of all of the more stable six structures under the combined action of anions and stress. Fig. 5(a–f) shows that the CBMs and VBMs of CsPbCl2Br, CsPbClBr2, CsPbBr3, and CsPbCl2I are located at high symmetry point B, which are all direct band gap semiconductors with band gap values of 2.18 eV, 2.14 eV, 1.98 eV, and 2.29 eV, respectively. In Fig. 5e, CsPbClI2 is an indirect band gap with a band gap value of 2.11 eV, while the difference in Fig. 5e is that although CsPbI3 is a direct band gap with a band gap value of 1.69 eV, both CBM and VBM are located at the high symmetry point Z, which indicates that a phase transition occurs, leading to different paths of the high symmetry points.

Fig. 6(a–f) shows the PDOS of these six structures, and the VBM is the antibonding hybridization between Pb 6s and halide p orbitals. The CBM is affected by the interaction between Pb 6p and halide p orbitals. However, the effect of Br on the whole VB structure is more vital than that of I. It is worth noting that the anion substitution can significantly reduce the CBM, but the VBM does not change significantly; thus, the regulatory effect of anions on the band structure is mainly realized by adjusting the CB.
Phase transition mechanism analysis
To further explain the mechanism of the change of the band gap and electronic structure of CsPbCl3 under the action of stress and anions, it is necessary to analyze the evolution process of the structure. Lattice contraction and octahedral rotation, which compete with each other, can significantly affect the band gap. The bond length of Pb–Cl can describe the lattice shrinkage of the four CsPbCl3 structures, the angle between Pb–Cl–Pb can be used to evaluate the rotation of the octahedron, and the connection between the two can well reflect the structural change.

Fig. 7a shows that the increase of the hydrostatic pressure decreases the Pb–Cl bond length; with the strengthening of the tensile force, the Pb–Cl bond length increases. This change is consistent with the band gap size because the main component of CBM is the nonbonding localized state of the Pb 6p orbital. In VBM, the coupling effect between the Pb 6s and Cl 3p orbitals determines the band gap size. Shortening the Pb–Cl bond length will benefit the coupling effect, improve the VBM, and narrow the band gap. On the contrary, increasing the Pb–Cl bond length will reduce the coupling effect and the VBM and increase the band gap. Several researchers have analyzed the transformation of the crystal structure of CsPbCl3 by in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, with increasing pressure Bragg diffraction peaks are constantly moving toward a larger 2θ, with further increasing pressure diffraction peak height decreases, while original Raman modes evidently broaden and dramatically decrease in intensity. These results confirm that pressure can modulate the tilt and distortion of the PbCl6 octahedra, which in turn produces favorable conditions for the change of electronic structure.37,44
 Fig. 7  (a) Relationship between the Pb–Cl–Pb angle and Pb–Cl length under stress for P4/mbm, Amm2, R32and PMM, (b) crystal structure of CsPbClI2, in which cyan is Cs, black is Pb, green is Cl, and purple is I. 
In addition, several particular points of band gap change are also consistent with the interval of Fig. 7a(I–V). In the interval I, the band gap of the P4/mbm structure anomalously decreases (the lattice constant scale factor is transformed from 1.04 to 1.05); in interval II, the band gap type of the structure Amm2 is transformed into an indirect band gap (the lattice constant scale factor is changed from 0.96 to 0.95); in interval III, the band gap of the structure Amm2 increases sharply (the lattice constant scale factor changed from 1.02 to 1.03); in interval IV, the band gap of the R32 structure decreases slowly (the lattice constant scale factor changed from 0.98 to 0.97); moreover, in interval V, the structure R32 mutates from a direct band gap to an indirect band gap (the lattice constant scaling factor changes from 1.02 to 1.03). The reason for these mutations may be that the Pb–Cl bond length first decreases with the increase of the hydrostatic pressure and then increases with the increase of the tensile force. However, if the angle between Pb–Cl–Pb cannot match the change of the bond length due to the limitation of the lattice, the octahedron will rotate violently. When this effect exceeds the bond length, it will lead to the changing trend of the band gap and even to the change of the band gap type. It is noteworthy that the PMM structure band gap variation is more stable. This is because PMM is a standard cubic structure, as shown in Fig. 1c, with Pb atoms occupying the center of the primitive cell (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and PbCl6 octahedra also occupying the lattice center. With the change of stress, only the Pb–Cl bond length will change and the rotation key parameter Pb–Cl–Pb angle between the constant octahedra is always 180°. Therefore, we do not observe the phase transition of PMM structure.

Table 2 shows the crystal phase changes of the six most stable structures, CsPbCl2Br, CsPbClBr2, CsPbBr3, CsPbCl2I, CsPbClI2, and CsPbI3, before and after doping under the combined action of stress and anions. With the substitution of anions, the original defect-free structure is transformed into another space group, in which CsPbCl2Br, CsPbCl2I, and CsPbClI2 are transformed into the PM space group; CsPbClBr2 is transformed into PMC21; CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are transformed into P4/mbm. In addition, XRD reported by some researchers shows that with the difference of anion substitution content, the diffraction peak shifts significantly to the left (I > Br > Cl), which indicates that anion substitution increases the lattice parameters of perovskite, providing conditions for phase transition.45,46

When substituting with Br and I, the bond lengths of Pb–Br and Pb–I increase significantly compared with that of Pb–Cl, and the bond length of Pb–I is greater than that of Pb–Br. This is different from the relationship between the bond length and band structure under stress, in which the bond length increases and the band gap decreases instead. Combined with PDOS, the anion substitution affects the band gap mainly by influencing the CB, not the VB, where Pb is more strongly coupled to the anion orbital. The angles of Pb–Cl–Pb are significantly reduced after anion substitution compared with its defect-free structure, indicating that the change of the band gap caused by anion substitution is strongly related to the distortion between internal octahedrons. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the distortion of the crystal structure of CsPbClI2 is the most severe, which creates the conditions for the transition from the direct band gap of CsPbCl2I to the indirect band gap of CsPbClI2. There is also a possible explanation for the direct and indirect band gap interconversions in which CBM/VBM is directly involved: the structural transformation caused by stress and anions leads to a strong Coulomb interaction between Cs and Pb, which can be identified by the Pb 6p orbital and may keep CBM away from point B.19,47
The evolution of the band gap depends on three competing structural change parameters: bond length change, octahedral tilt, and cation shift. These three changes occur simultaneously, and one controls the other, depending on the specific structure.22,36 At a lower stress, the main parameter is the shortening of the bond length. In comparison, at a higher stress, octahedral tilt and cation displacement begin to play an important role. Compared with inorganic perovskites, organic cations play a dominant role in hybrid perovskites.36
Optical properties
The light absorption coefficient is a crucial criterion for measuring the ability of a substance to absorb light, thus providing important information for solar energy conversion efficiency and other practical applications of photovoltaic devices.48 This is necessary for the practical application of the material in high-performance solar cells and other photovoltaic devices.2 The light absorption coefficient refers to the amount of light penetrating the material before it is absorbed in a specific energy (wavelength). The absorption spectra of the two most stable main phase structures, P4/mbm and Amm2, and their six most stable substitution structures are shown in Fig. 8, using an energy range from 0 eV to 5.5 eV. The absorption spectrum is in the ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-Vis), and the light wavelength ranges from 300 to 800 nm.

(a) Relationship between the absorption coefficient and incident photon energy. (b) Relationship between the light absorption coefficient and wavelength. 

Fig. 8a shows the relationship between the optical absorption coefficient and the incident photon energy, whereas the optical absorption is achieved primarily through higher energy transitions and carrier recombination.49 In the low energy region, the absorption coefficient is close to zero, indicating that the absorption is not obvious when the photon energy is deficient. In addition, the main phase structures P4/mbm and Amm2 have comparable light absorption capabilities, while the main phase structure P4/mbm is more stable. However, with the increase of the substitution ratio of anion Br to I, the absorption edge of the perovskite metal halide shifts to the low-energy region (redshift), which enhances the light absorption in the visible region. The substitution of anions Br and I enhances the light absorption ability in the energy range of 0–5.5 eV. Specifically, CsPbI3 and CsPbClI2 have broader absorption peaks and higher light absorption coefficients. The results show that CsPbI3 and CsPbClI2 have good application prospects in solar cells and photoelectric detection.

Fig. 8b shows the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient, providing further insight into the light absorption properties of the most stable structures in the visible region under the combined action of stress and anions. Fig. 8(b) shows that the two main phase structures of CsPbCl3, P4/mbm and Amm2, have little absorption in the visible region. However, the substitution of anions Br and I enhances the optical absorption in the visible region, and different compositions have different sensitivities to specific wavelengths. It is worth noting that the optical absorption properties of CsPbI3 and CsPbClI2 are significantly improved, especially in the short wavelength range.
Conclusions
In summary, the structural stability and band gap evolution mechanism of four different space groups, P4/mbm, R32, PMM, and R32, of inorganic metal halide perovskite CsPbCl3 under stress were investigated by first-principles calculations based on the DFT. The two most stable main phase structures, P4/mbm and Amm2, under stress, were substituted with anions Br and I. A small range of stress was applied to screen the six most stable components, CsPbCl2Br, CsPbClBr2, CsPbBr3, CsPbCl2I, CsPbClI2, and CsPbI3, for the phase transition mechanism and analysis of the electronic structure and optical properties. The results show that the band gap decreases and increases with the increase in hydrostatic pressure and tensile force, respectively. The substitution of anions with Br and I can significantly increase the lattice volume and reduce the band gap, and the effect of I is more vital than that of Br. Both stress and anionic substitution induce direct and indirect band gap interconversion, which is associated with the disorder of the crystal structure. Stress and anionic substitution differ in the way they affect the electronic structure. The stress mainly affects the VB orbital coupling by adjusting the bond length of Pb and anions and the degree of octahedral rotation, thereby changing the band gap, while the anion substitution mainly controls the CB shift. Finally, through the combined effect of stress and anion substitution on the CsPbCl3 structure, a P4/mbm structure with comparable optical properties but a more stable system was screened. The most stable structures, CsPbClI2 (based on the main phase structure Amm2) and CsPbI3 (based on the main phase structure P4/mbm), were selected. Due to their excellent absorption coefficients, these structures can be applied in a variety of applications, such as solar cells. The methods provided in this paper are instructive for studying the properties of other types of perovskites and device materials with excellent photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties.
