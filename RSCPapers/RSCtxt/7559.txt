    , Accepted 15th February 2017First published on 15th February 2017AbstractA low-cost, hyper-branched, carbazole-based polymer (HB-Cz) was designed and synthesized by a facile “A3 + B2” one-pot Suzuki polycondensation reaction. Due to the hyper-branched structure and carbazole unit, HB-Cz is a promising candidate for a hole-transporting material, which was confirmed in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with a configuration of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HB-Cz/Ag. The films of poly-(3-hexylthiophene) and linear poly[N-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl] were also used as hole-transporting layers (HTLs) in the reference devices. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra indicate that HB-Cz has the fastest charge regeneration. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that HB-Cz could reduce carrier recombination effectively, improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor of the PVSCs. A PCE of 14.07% obtained from the HB-Cz-based device was much higher than those of devices based on P3HT (9.05%) and PCz (6.60%), and this is attributed to the superior hole-transporting property and surface smoothing effect of the HB-Cz HTL.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have recently taken the photovoltaic research world by storm, and displayed high certification power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 22% in only 7 years.1,2 At present, most high efficiency PVSCs have been achieved from the conventional device structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL/Ag,3–9 in which mesoporous or compact TiO2 is used as the electron-transporting layer (ETL). The hole-transporting layer (HTL) of the PVSCs is equally important to facilitate and balance the carrier transport.10–12 There are several interesting studies on the new and promising hole-transporting materials (HTMs) of PVSCs,9,13–18 among which 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the first organic HTM affording PCEs around 20%.9,18 It is well known that spiro-OMeTAD has some shortcomings including low hole mobility, complex synthesis process, and poor crystallinity, and therefore its derivatives emerge endlessly.18–26 With high hole mobility, carbazole moieties were identified as effective HTMs over twenty years and poly(vinyl carbazole) (PVK) was widely used in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Because of the different solvent selectivity from the perovskite active layers, carbazole-based polymers and small molecules are the most suitable candidates to serve as HTMs for PVSCs.27–34 Wang and Wu reported a carbazole-based small molecule R01 synthesized by a one-step palladium-catalyzed Suzuki reaction and the resulting PVSCs presented a PCE of 7.47%.31 Several star-shaped carbazole-based small molecule HTMs linked with phenylene-derived central core units afforded PCEs of PVSCs from 10.96% to 14.79%.32,33 The carbazole-based small molecule HTM containing a 3,3′-biphenyl central core was used in PVSCs, and a PCE of 4.53% was obtained.34 Compared with small organic molecules, polymeric HTMs present the much better film formation ability from solution. Linear poly(2,7-carbazole) is thought to be a better HTM than linear poly(3,6-carbazole) due to the higher hole mobility and the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level.27 Hyper-branched polymers are highly branched three-dimensional macromolecules, which have received much attention due to their advantages of facile synthesis, low cost, variety, low viscosity, and good solubility. The hyper-branched polymers containing carbazole moieties are typical p-type semiconductors with saturation regimes and well-defined conformation. They have been widely used as light-emitting materials and HTMs in OLED,35,36 but their application in PVSCs is rare. Therefore, in this study, a new hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz constructed with fully π-conjugated carbazole moieties was synthesized by an “A3 + B2” one-pot Suzuki polycondensation. As a potential candidate for an HTM, optical, electrochemical, hydrophobic and hole-transporting properties of HB-Cz are checked comprehensively with two reference HTMs: poly-(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and linear poly[N-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl] (PCz). The superior properties of HB-Cz as an HTM are confirmed further from the device performances of the PVSCs.
In these PVSCs, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) was prepared by a modified two step method,37 and compact planar-TiO2 films were obtained by a low temperature method.38 The resulting device, based on HB-Cz, gave a PCE of 14.07% with a fill factor (FF) of 69.91%, a current density (Jsc) of 20.88 mA cm−2, and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, while the reference devices using P3HT, PCz and W/O HTL presented maximum PCEs of 9.05%, 6.60% and 3.78%, respectively.

2.2. Synthesis of hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz
Hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz was synthesized from carbazole monomers and phenylboronic acid. The catalyst Pd(0)(PPh3)4 (0.023 g, 0.02 mmol), base K2CO3 (0.83 g, 6.0 mmol), monomers 3,6-dibromo-9-(4-bromophenyl)-9H-carbazole (1, 0.096 g, 2.0 mmol) and 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9-(undecan-5-yl)-9H-carbazole (2, 0.172 g, 3.0 mmol) were added to the Schlenk tube equipped with a stirring bar in air. The Schlenk tube was fitted with a rubber septum, evacuated, and then refilled three times with nitrogen. Toluene (10.0 mL) was added via a syringe, and then the mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 110 °C. When the reaction solution became opaque, the end-capped phenylboronic acid was added and then stirred at 110 °C for another 48 h. Excess absolute methanol was poured into the mixture, which was then filtered. The solid obtained was dissolved again in absolute THF, and the insoluble solid was filtered out. After removal of all the solvent, the solid residue was purified again by several precipitations from absolute THF into methanol; hydrazine hydrate (10%) was used for removal of trace Pd metal and the obtained solid residue was washed with excess acetone and next with methanol. In the end, the resultant HB-Cz polymer was obtained as gray powder with an yield of 85% (after purification), Mw = 6.4 × 103, PDI = 2.12 (GPC, polystyrene calibration). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) of HB-Cz: δ (ppm) 0.81–0.83 (–CH3), 1.19–1.34 (–CH2–), 1.58 (–CH2), 2.08 (–CH2), 4.80 (–N–CH–), 7.30–7.81 (Ar-H), 8.21–8.61 (Ar-H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 14.05, 22.61, 26.95, 29.25, 29.40, 29.53, 31.79, 33.90, 56.46, 107.64, 110.23, 127.03, 127.11, 127.30, 127.38, 127.86, 128.82, 129.01, 129.94, 134.90, 136.59, 137.77, 139.89, 140.31, 140.80, 141.44, 142.56, 143.28. Thermal properties of HB-Cz were tested via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
2.3. Synthesis of CH3NH3I
CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized according to the reported method.39 10.0 mL of methylamine (40% in water) was added into 11.0 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water) for 2 h with stirring under air and maintained in an ice-water bath. Afterwards the mixture obtained was evaporated at 50 °C for around 2 h and white powder formed during this process. This was then washed with absolute diethyl ether three times and the as-obtained solid was re-dissolved in 10.0 mL absolute ethanol and precipitated with the addition of 125.0 mL absolute diethyl ether; this procedure was repeated three times. The white powder was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
2.4. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The PVSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone and IPA, and finally treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 10 min. First, TiO2 precursor was spin-coated on top of ITO glass at 7000 rpm for 30 s in the glove box, and then baked at 130 °C for 1 h in air. The resulting TiO2 films was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 3 min and then transferred to the glove box. PbI2 was dissolved in dry DMF with a concentration of 463 mg mL−1, and MAI was dissolved in anhydrous IPA at 10 mg mL−1. MAPbI3 active layer was prepared through a modified solvent annealing two-step method developed by us.37 PbI2 precursors were spun onto compact TiO2-covered ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 40 °C for 10 min; furthermore, MAI was spin-coated on top of the PbI2 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s after 120 s loading time. MAPbI3 perovskite layers were thermally annealed on the heating panel at 90 °C for 30 min to form and crystallize the MAPbI3 active layer. Then, HB-Cz, P3HT or PCz was deposited by spin-coating a 10–20 mg mL−1 CB solution at 1000 to 3000 rpm for 30 s and the obtained films were annealed at 90 °C for another 5 min. Finally, the devices were transferred to a vacuum chamber and finished by evaporation of an 80 nm Ag electrode through a shadow mask. The devices were encapsulated in glass by UV-curable resin in the glove box, and measurements were taken in air.
2.5. Measurement and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra data were recorded on a Bruker AVIII-400 NMR spectrometer at room temperature and were expressed in parts per million (ppm) relative to the internal standard. Molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene standard calibration (Waters high pressure GPC assembly model 1515 pump, refractive index detectors, eluent solvent THF). UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermal apparatus (Switzerland) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was run on a TA Instrument Q20 with scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured by a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc.) in the frequency range between 1 and 106 Hz with perturbation amplitudes of 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using a three-electrode cell under N2 atmosphere with CHI 660 electrochemical workstation. The polymer films on a glassy carbon electrode (working electrode) were scanned anodically and cathodically in 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in dry acetonitrile solution with Ag/AgCl and a Pt-wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The tests were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system with the assumption that the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is 4.8 eV under vacuum. The crystal phase of the samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker, D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) from 2θ = 5° to 60° at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1 at room temperature under ambient conditions. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was obtained via Perkin Elmer photoluminescence. The fluorescence decay traces were measured using a time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh) excited with a 397 nm EPL picosecond pulsed diode laser with a pulse width of 50 ps at room temperature in air. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension Edge SPM System) were performed to characterize the surface morphology of different films.
Solar-simulated AM 1.5 sunlight was generated with a NEWPORT Sol3A class solar simulator (Newport Corp., Irvine, CA USA) calibrated to give 100 mW cm−2 using a NREL-calibrated KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated to be less than 1%. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400. The active areas of the solar cells were defined with a metal aperture mask of about 0.04 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the solar cells were measured (Enlitech QE-R3011, Enlitech Co. Ltd., Taiwan) at room temperature.
Hole mobility of the different HTMs was measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/MoO3/Ag. The values of hole mobility were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott–Gurney law.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route of HB-Cz is shown in Scheme 1. Hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz was obtained from the reaction of 3,6-dibromo-9-(4-bromophenyl)-9H-carbazole (1), and 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9-(undecan-5-yl)-9H-carbazole (2) and phenylboronic acid, in which Pd(0)(PPh3)4 was used as catalyst and K2CO3 was used as base. Monomers (1) and (2) are charge-carrying species in prototypical organic HTMs of OLEDs. The substituted carbazol-9-yl group of monomer (1) can be considered as a phenylamino group planarized by a carbon–carbon bond between the 2,3-positions of the two segments, and carbazole bisborate ester derivative (2) provides an electron donor group.
 Scheme 1  The synthetic process for HB-Cz, and the chemical structures of P3HT and PCz. 
The “A4 + B2” approach via a Suzuki one-pot polycondensation reaction was used to synthesize carbazole-constructed hyper-branched polymers.35 Herein, with three bromine atoms in monomer (1), the “A3 + B2” approach via a Suzuki one-pot polycondensation reaction was utilized. Compared with the four-brominated tri-carbazole compound, monomer (1) has a higher solubility in the common organic solvents, which is in favor of polymerization. For this polycondensation, the cross-linking reaction is the main competing reaction, and hence a diluted toluene/K2CO3 solution (carbazole monomer concentration was about 0.002 M) is used to inhibit this side reaction. In addition, feed ratio of the starting materials, reaction time, temperature and stirring speed were also optimized to decrease cross-linked insoluble byproducts. The resultant HB-Cz was obtained as light gray powder in a yield of 85% (after purification) with Mw of 6.4 × 103 (Table S1†) and PDI of 2.12 (GPC, polystyrene calibration).35 The desired chemical structure of HB-Cz is shown in Scheme 1. Of course, not all the Br atoms of (1) react with borates of (2) since some may react with phenylboronic acid. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the presence of the broad peak at δ of 4.80 ppm was due to the carbazole N–CH bridge proton in HB-Cz, and the 13C NMR spectrum showed a single peak at δ of 56.46 ppm, which corresponds to the N–CH carbon. The obtained product is soluble in common organic solvents, such as toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The DSC curve of HB-Cz displays a glass transition temperature of 107 °C. The TGA curve indicates that HB-Cz is thermally stable up to 390 °C (Fig. S2†). Both data confirm that the HB-Cz possesses high thermal stability, which favours its application in PVSCs.
3.2. Optical, electrochemical, hydrophobic and hole-transporting properties
The UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra of the different HTM films are plotted in Fig. 1a and S3,† respectively. The maximum absorption of HB-Cz is located at 350 nm displaying an absorption edge at 410 nm, which ensures a high incident light absorption of the active layer. The absorption peaks of PCz and P3HT are found at 380 nm and 525 nm, displaying absorption edges at 425 nm and 660 nm, respectively. Compared with the linear polymer PCz, the absorption peak and absorption edge of HB-Cz are blue-shifted, indicating a shorter conjugation length due to the twist configuration of hyper-branched structure and an inhibition of aggregation in the hyper-branched polymer. HTL can also filter UV light to alleviate the degradation of PVSCs.40 In this study, HB-Cz presents higher UV light absorption than that of P3HT and PCz and acts as a better protection screen of perovskite active materials.41
 Fig. 1  (a) UV-visible absorption spectra of HB-Cz, P3HT and PCz films, (b) CV curves of the HB-Cz, P3HT and PCz, (c) J–V curves of hole-only devices with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/MoO3/Al, inset: water contact angles of HB-Cz, P3HT and PCz films, (d) XRD spectra of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/HB-Cz. 
CV curves are plotted in Fig. 1b. The onset of the irreversible oxidation wave (Eox) is 0.38, 0.80 and 0.52 eV for P3HT, PCz and HB-Cz respectively, and their HOMO levels could be estimated to be −5.18, −5.60 and −5.32 eV from the onset oxidation potential according an empirical formula [EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) (eV)], while their LUMO levels are estimated from the optical band gaps and HOMO levels. The HOMO energy level of HB-Cz is 0.14 eV deeper than that of P3HT,42,43 and therefore, hole transport from MAPbI3 (−5.43 eV) to the HTM is more favored. Moreover, PCz has a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.60 eV, which may result in a hole-injection barrier between MAPbI3 perovskite and PCz. The well matched HOMO energy levels between HB-Cz and MAPbI3 perovskite not only facilitate hole transfer and extraction but also reduce the energy loss. At the same time, HB-Cz can also serve as the effective electron blocking layer because the conduction band edge of MAPbI3 (−3.93 eV) is much lower than the LUMO energy level of HB-Cz (−2.42 eV).
Recent studies suggested that the relatively hydrophobic polymer HTLs can more efficiently shield moisture than the HTL obtained from small molecules, which will be contributed to the stable PVSCs.44 The as-cast P3HT and PCz exhibit a contact angle of 105.8° (105.3°)45 and 101.5° respectively (Fig. 1c, inset). Furthermore, HB-Cz exhibits a larger contact angle of 114.2° (Fig. 1c, inset), which may be attributed to the super-molecular structure of hyper-branched polymers.
Hole mobility of different HTMs can be studied from J–V characteristics of the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/MoO3/Ag. Hole mobilities of the HTMs HB-Cz, PCz and P3HT were calculated to be 8.2 × 10−4, 5.8 × 10−4 and 9.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively based on the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. 1c).46 Based on these data and the literature,47–49 hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz presents a higher hole mobility than P3HT, PCz and spiro-OMeTAD, attributed to the three-dimensional network channels for hole transportation.
3.3. Photovoltaic properties
For the functional layers formed from solution layer by layer, the fabrication process of HTL should not have any negative effect on MAPbI3 perovskite film, which can be checked from XRD patterns (Fig. 1d). Almost the same XRD patterns are shown from MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/HB-Cz.50 Three characteristic peaks at 14.1°, 28.4° and 32.1° are seen from both samples and are consisted with the lattice planes 110, 220 and 310, respectively, of the MAPbI3 thin films, revealing a random crystallographic orientation.51
Based on the optimized fabrication conditions of TiO2 and MAPbI3, PVSCs were studied by changing the thickness of HTL. It is found that there is an optimal thickness for each HTM. A thinner HTL will not give a full coverage of MAPbI3 and a thicker HTL will affect the carrier transport. As expected, the best device performances were achieved from HB-Cz HTL with a thickness of 140 nm, in which a PCE of 14.07% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 20.88 mA cm−2, and FF of 69.91% are observed (Fig. 2b). The device based on 130 nm P3HT displays a PCE of 9.05% (Table 1, entry 2), which is close to the value reported by Di Carlo (9.30%).52 The device based on PCz HTL presents the maximum PCE of 6.60% (Table 1, entry 3) with a thickness of 135 nm and the control device without HTL gives a low PCE of 3.78% (Table 1, entry 4). There is a 0.1 V gap between Voc of the PVSCs based on HB-Cz (0.97 V) and P3HT (0.87 V). In general, Voc of the PVSCs is determined by the HOMO energy level of HTM, or by the gap between the quasi-Fermi level of holes in HTL and that of the electrons in ETL.29,53 Therefore, the higher Voc in the HB-Cz-based device is attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of HB-Cz.54 Moreover, the LUMO energy level of HB-Cz is higher than those of PCz and P3HT, and the resulting higher electron-blocking effect contributes to a higher Voc.20 Higher hole mobility of HTL and better ohmic contacts between MAPbI3, HTMs and metal electrode can increase FF of the devices.55,56 The high Jsc of 20.88 mA cm−2 obtained from the HB-Cz-based PVSCs devices can be attributed to the low injection barrier between HTL and the active layer (0.1 eV) and the relatively higher hole mobility of HB-Cz.

EQE spectra of the PVSCs devices based on the different HTLs are shown in Fig. 2c. It is found that the device with HB-Cz HTL presents higher EQE values in nearly the entire UV-visible wavelength range (350–800 nm) than other ones. The integrated photocurrents of the PVSCs using HB-Cz, P3HT, PCz, and W/O HTL are 20.80, 17.08, 13.26 and 12.38 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the measured Jsc of 20.88, 16.97, 13.20 and 12.23 mA cm−2 under standard 1 sun AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation. The margin of error between Jsc from EQE and J–V measurements is within ±5%. At the same time, the reproducibility of the performance of the PVSCs based on HB-Cz HTL was checked with 50 separate devices; most of the devices gave the values of PCE over 13% (Fig. 2d).
3.4. Study on steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) of MAPbI3/HTL
To further check the effect of different HTLs upon MAPbI3, steady-state PL measurement was first conducted for bare MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 covered with different HTMs (Fig. 3a). The most effective PL quenching of MAPbI3 was observed from HB-Cz, which indicates that carriers created in the excited MAPbI3 layer are efficiently extracted,26 and this is highly consistent with the higher hole mobility of HB-Cz.10 TR-PL was carried out using the samples of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL (Fig. 3b). The rate of radiative recombination of holes and electrons can be obtained from the TR-PL decay of these samples. PL decay of MAPbI3/HB-Cz is much faster than that of MAPbI3/PCz and MAPbI3/P3HT, which suggests that holes of MAPbI3 could more efficiently inject into HB-Cz HTL and a faster charge regeneration occurs.32 Using the following equations (1) (2)charge-transfer times (τCT) and charge-transfer efficiencies (CTE) of the samples were calculated, as listed in Table 2.32 From PCz, P3HT to HB-Cz, there are decreasing trends of the average charge-transfer time (τave) and τCT, whereas the CTE value increases in the same order of the HTLs (Table 2), which is in good agreement with the device performances based on the different HTL (Table 1).

3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis

V
oc is determined by the electron density in TiO2 and the potential of the conduction band edge, which are closely related to the charge recombination and surface charge.57 Bigger Voc is usually connected with the suppression of charge recombination or the negative shift of conduction band edge.58 EIS analysis of the PVSCs based on different HTMs was conducted to clarify the effect of HTL on Voc in dark in different bias (Fig. 4 and S4†). The RC arc is usually attributed to the resistance of hole-transporting in HTM and the charge transfer in the interface of HTM/MAPbI3. As expected, HB-Cz-based PVSCs have a smaller interface contact resistance (Rct) compared to that of the cells with P3HT, PCz-based, and W/O-HTL PVSCs (MAPbI3/HTL), and the decreased Rct results in higher Voc.59 The RS of the device is related to the resistance of the ITO, external wires, and other additional contributions,60 which can be obtained from the starting point at the real part of the Nyquist plot.61 The RS values in the device with HB-Cz as HTL were about 10, 25 and 230 Ω lower than that of P3HT, PCz-based-HTL, and W/O-HTL devices (Fig. 4a, lower-left inset), which are consistent with the various hole mobility of these HTMs. The lowest RS value must contribute to a rational explanation for the higher FF and lower loss in Voc for the HB-Cz-based PVSC,59 which corresponds to its best device performances.

(b) Nyquist plots of PVSCs based on HB-Cz under dark at various bias voltages. 
3.6. Surface morphology
Morphology of MAPbI3 with/without HTL are studied by SEM and AFM. First, smooth, compact, continuous, and full-coverage MAPbI3 film formed upon the TiO2 layer (Fig. 5a). MAPbI3 film displayed clear grain boundaries with grain sizes from 300 nm to 500 nm, which are close to the thickness of the active layer and helpful for balancing the light absorption and the charge transporting.62,63 The surface modification effect is the other important function of HTL for decreasing current leakage and attaining better ohmic contact with the cathode. Optimal interface morphology between the active layer and the metal electrode can be partly confirmed by the surface quality of HTL,26 which will give an overall enhancement of Jsc, Voc and FF. The best film formation ability of HB-Cz among the three HTMs confirms the contribution from the hyper-branched polymeric structure; hyper-branched polymers possess spherical three-dimensional conformation, which restrains the regular fluffy packing effectively, and present better solubility than their linear counterparts. Higher solubility of HB-Cz increases pore filling in the MAPbI3 layer64 and consequently improves the performance of PVSCs, although HB-Cz possesses relatively low molecular weight (Table S1†).65 Morphology of these samples was studied further by AFM. MAPbI3/HB-Cz presents a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 4.78 nm (Fig. 5b), while pure MAPbI3, MAPbI3/P3HT and MAPbI3/PCz give Rq roughness values of 24.5, 17.6 and 10.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 5b–d). Therefore, the optimized interface morphology is demonstrated for the MAPbI3/HB-Cz bi-layer film, in which the boundaries between grains of MAPbI3 are filled completely, facilitating carrier transport to the electrodes.66

4. Conclusions
In this study, hyper-branched polymer containing carbazole moieties is used as an HTM for PVSCs for the first time. HB-Cz constructed fully with carbazole moieties was synthesized by a convenient one-pot synthetic route with high isolated yield and easily processable molecular weight. Using HB-Cz, a PCE of 14.07% was demonstrated from devices with a structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL/Ag, while PCEs of 9.05%, 6.60% and 3.78% were achieved from reference devices with P3HT, PCz and W/O HTL, respectively. The superior device performances are attributed to the merits of the hyper-branched polymer HB-Cz, including good UV light absorption, deep HOMO energy, high LUMO energy, high hole mobility and good and smooth surface effects. Thus, low-cost, easily obtained, undoped HB-Cz will cast light on hyper-branched carbazole-based polymers for high efficiency PVSCs.
