    , Accepted 6th April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractWhile colloidal quantum dot based solar cells (CQDSCs) have recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 11.3%, the CQD active layers are fabricated almost exclusively by a combined process of in situ solid-state ligand exchange (SSE) with multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition, which has been a major obstacle to high-throughput processing. In this work, we developed, for the first time, high-efficiency CQDSCs without using either the SSE or LbL technique. The fabrication of n–p quantum dot junctions by SSE-free direct coating was achieved using n-type CQD ink and p-type CQD ink. The ink based devices achieved a PCE of ∼11%, which is comparable to the current state-of-the-art performance. The CQD inks enabled, for the first time, use of the doctor-blade coating method for device fabrication. Notably, the PCE of the bladed CQDSCs was remarkably high, at >10%, which suggests its potential use in other industrially friendly processes.

Broader context
Colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising types of solar cells, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been expanded to >11% by the efficient use of photons up to the near-infrared regime. In most reported high-efficiency CQD solar cells, however, the fabrication of the CQD active layers has been limited by the cumbersome multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process, with iterations of the in situ solid-state ligand exchange (SSE), creating a critical obstacle to high-throughput processing techniques. In this report, for the first time, high-efficiency CQD solar cells were fabricated without the use of either SSE or LbL techniques, using pre-exchanged p-type and n-type CQD inks. Using these CQD inks, the device fabrication of CQD solar cells becomes as simple as the fabrication of organic solar cells, with the benefits of processing methods at low temperature. CQD solar cells with a PCE of ∼11% were achieved by direct spin-coating methods. Using these p-type and n-type CQD inks, a high-throughput doctor-blade coating technique was readily applicable achieving a PCE of >10%. This solid-state-ligand-exchange free CQD film deposition may pave the road for commercialization of CQD based optoelectronic devices.

Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted great interest in recent years because of their special properties, including a size-tunable bandgap, solution processability, high charge carrier mobility, and multiple charge generation.1–4 Potential CQD applications have been demonstrated in various optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors,5 solar concentrators,6,7 light-emitting diodes,8,9 lasers,10 and solar cells.11–14 In the field of CQD based solar cells (CQDSCs), significant advances have been accomplished in recent years, including the development of CQD surface defect controls11,12,14 and device architecture,15 which have enabled the achievement of certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.3% and 13.4% for PbS-based and perovskite-based CQDSCs, respectively.11,16 Recent reports on the improved stability of CQDSCs under air-storage15,17 and photo-irradiation18 also increase their potential use for next-generation low-cost power sources.
Despite the steady development of device efficiency, a crucial drawback remains that must be resolved for CQDSCs to reach the next level of commercialization. In most reports of high-efficiency CQDSCs, the fabrication of the CQD active layers has been performed by a combined method of multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) depositions using in situ solid-state ligand exchange (SSE) processes.7,19–21 During the SSE process, the original long chain alkyl-ligands are replaced by shorter ligands by exposing the as-prepared CQD layers to exchanging ligand solutions, by spin-coating or dip-coating. The exchanging ligand solutions have a finite penetration depth, which also causes a volume change within the CQD layers. As a result, there is a limit to the thickness that can be achieved with a single deposition (a few tens of nanometers).
The combination of post-synthetic SSE with LbL steps has produced desired optoelectronic properties and enhanced electronic coupling among CQDs with sufficient layer thicknesses. However, the re-exposure of the CQD layers to exchanging ligand solutions can potentially cause significant surface defects, which later act as charge trap sites.22,23 Furthermore, from an engineering point of view, performing multiple LbL depositions via a cumbersome iteration of SSE steps (>10 times) is a big obstacle to preparing CQD layers in commercial high-throughput deposition processes.24,25
One intuitive strategy to decouple the post ligand exchange steps from the film deposition process is to prepare high performance pre-exchanged CQD inks. This allows direct single-step deposition of sufficiently thick CQD layers using conventional coating techniques such as spin-coating, spray-coating, doctor-blading, etc.. Recently, a couple of key achievements were made in the preparation of pre-exchanged CQD inks. Sargent and coworkers have reported hybrid organic–inorganic n-type character PbS–CQD inks (nQD-ink) via a solution exchange method using a triple ligand of PbI2, PbBr2, and ammonium acetate.11 Parallel to that report, our group also developed iodide-capped nQD-inks by the phase-transfer-exchange (PTE) method using PbI2 as the exchanging ligand. The nQD-inks had a considerably reduced defect density because of high surface passivation, and it was possible to readily prepare n-type CQD layers with the desired thickness (several hundred nanometers) by direct single-step spin-coating. These nQD-ink based CQDSCs, which were constructed with n–p quantum junction active layers (n-type CQD layer/p-type CQD layer junction), achieved a PCE of 11.3%.11 In those n–p quantum junctions, the n-type layers were constructed by direct-coating with nQD-inks, however, the p-type CQD layers were still prepared by the SSE step, using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) as the exchanging ligand, just as in other reported high-efficiency CQDSCs.3,11,14,15
To date, high-performance directly coatable pre-exchanged p-type CQD inks (pQD-ink) and the fabrication of high-efficiency SSE-free CQDSCs using them, have never been published. The development of a high performance pQD-ink would enable the direct fabrication of high-efficiency CQDSCs without using the SSE process, which is beneficial for commercial high-throughput processes.
In this study we developed, for the first time, high-efficiency CQDSCs containing n–p quantum junctions fabricated by SSE-free direct coating methods, using both nQD-ink and pQD-ink. While the organic dispersible nQD-ink was prepared following our reported method,12 the aqueous pQD-inks were developed by capping 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) on PbS–CQDs using the PTE method. Sufficient dispersion of the MPA-capped CQDs over a range of aqueous solutions was achieved through a combination of water, a high dielectric constant (εr) solvent, with butylamine (BA), a high donor number (DN) chemical. The aqueous processable pQD-inks showed suitable optoelectronic properties, and direct coating of sufficient thickness was readily possible. The fabrication of the n–p quantum junctions was achieved by the simple successive coating of the nQD-ink and pQD-ink at low temperature, a process analogous to the fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices.26–33 The direct spin-coated SSE-free CQDSCs achieved a PCE of 10.9%, which is comparable to the current state-of-the-art performance. We also successfully fabricated CQDSCs by the direct doctor-blade coating method, a favorable technique for continuous and large-area film deposition. The PCE of the bladed devices was comparably high, 10.01%, which is an unprecedently remarkable result for processes other than spin-coating.34
Results and discussion
pQD-ink preparation by PTE
The pQD-ink was synthesized by the PTE method as illustrated in Fig. 1a. In the PTE process, 12.6 mM of MPA solution in dimethylformamide (DMF) was added to an 8 mg mL−1 solution of conventional oleate-capped PbS–CQDs (o-CQD) in octane. After brief shaking of the mixture (<10 s), the CQDs in the nonpolar phase (octane) were transferred to a polar phase (DMF), which indicates the ligand exchange from oleate to MPA. After washing two times with neat octane, the DMF phase was centrifuged to separate MPA-capped CQDs from the excess unbound MPA ligands. The solid MPA-capped CQDs were collected and redispersed in water:BA mixtures (95:5 by vol%) to prepare the pQD-inks. The MPA-capped CQDs were dispersible in up to ∼200 mg mL−1 at various volume% of BA in water (5–95%). The pQD-inks could also be prepared in various aqueous systems containing polar solvents such as ethanol or DMF. For example, water:BA (95:5), water:BA (5:95), water:DMF:BA (50:45:5), water:MeOH:BA (15:80:5), and water:ETOH:BA (15:80:5) by volume ratio, were all feasible to yield pQD-inks. Images of the pQD-inks in various aqueous systems are shown in Fig. 1b. In this study, the pQD-ink in water:BA (95:5), shown in Fig. 1a, was used as the default pQD-ink for further characterization and device fabrication in the later sections.

The BA plays the important role of ensuring the dispersion of MPA-capped CQDs in the aqueous solvents. It can efficiently capture the carboxyl hydrogens in the MPA, forming electrical double layers between the carboxylate anion and butylammonium cation at the CQD/solvent interfaces, as shown in Fig. 1a.35,36 The combination of a high DN chemical with a high εr solvent enabled the dispersion of the MPA-capped CQDs at relatively high concentrations, which is a prerequisite for the deposition of sufficiently thick films. The preparation of MPA-capped CQDs by solution-phase exchange in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been previously reported a few times, however the concentration of the CQD dispersion was too low (0.75 mg mL−1) to form thick enough films using conventional coating techniques.37,38 In the previous reports, the requirements for electrostatically dispersed MPA-capped CQDs (solvent system with high εr and DN) were discussed,39,40 however solvent systems capable of fulfilling such requirement are rare. Solvents with moderate εr and DN such as DMSO and DMF are unable to achieve good dispersion of MPA-capped CQDs at high concentrations. In our mixed aqueous solvents, the high DN of BA (DN of 33) accomplished the efficient deprotonation of MPA, while the high εr water (εr of 80) stabilized the electrical double layers.
General characterization of the pQD-ink
The zeta-potential value of the pQD-ink was −52 mV, confirming its good dispersion (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1, ESI†). The negative zeta-potential value verified the formation of carboxylate anions on the surface of the CQDs, which is consistent with the electrical double layers of carboxylate anions and butylammonium cations.40 The optical properties of the pQD-ink are shown in Fig. 2b. The first excitonic peak of the o-CQD solutions appeared at ∼920 nm, as shown in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrum (the black line in Fig. 2b). The peak of the pQD-ink was red-shifted by ∼20 nm due to the change in solvent dielectric constant, in accordance with other reported MPA-capped CQDs.12,37,41,42 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pQD-ink exhibited a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) similar to that of the o-CQD solution (Fig. 2b) indicating no significant CQD aggregation.43 The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra in Fig. 2c show that the oleate-ligands of the o-CQDs have been completely removed by PTE. The C–H, CC, and CO stretching peaks around 2800–3200 cm−1, from the oleate-ligand in the o-CQDs, are no longer present in the pQD-ink, indicating their near-quantitative removal. For comparison, we also prepared a conventional MPA-capped CQD layer by SSE (pQD-SSE)43,44 as a control sample. As shown in Fig. 2c, the removal of the oleate-ligands in the pQD-ink was as efficient as in the pQD-SSE.

(f) J–V curve of CQDSCs with pQD-ink as the active layer. The structure of the inverted device is shown in the inset. The concentration of the o-CQD solution and pQD-inks for ζ-potential measurement was 0.2 mg mL−1. 
For further surface characterization, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on the pQD-ink and pQD-SSE films. The pQD-ink films and o-CQD films were fabricated by direct spin-coating, and the pQD-SSE films were prepared by the SSE method. As shown in the wide-scan spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) and C 1s spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†), effective removal of the oleate-ligands was achieved in both the pQD-ink and pQD-SSE films. The N 1s XPS spectra of the pQD films revealed that there is no residual BA after formation of pQD-ink films (Fig. S4, ESI†). The atomic ratio obtained from wide-scan spectra (Table S1, ESI†) revealed that the pQD-ink and pQD-SSE films have very similar surface characteristics. Analysis of the S 2p spectra in Fig. 2d and Table S2 (ESI†) indicated thiolate bound with similar coverage (component ratio of 0.28) on both the pQD-SSE and pQD-ink films. The O 1s XPS spectrum, shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), typically provides information about trap state density on the CQD surface based on the occurrence of Pb–OH species.18 The pQD-ink and pQD-SSE films had the identical Pb–OH component ratio of 0.20. Based on the O 1s and Pb 4f XPS spectra analysis (Fig. S5 and S6, Tables S3 and S4, ESI†), the water in the pQD-ink solution does not induce any additional oxidation of CQD. This result, combined with other surface information from XPS analysis, revealed that both the pQD-SSE and pQD-ink films possess a comparable surface quality (Table S3, ESI†).
The energy levels of the pQD-ink films were investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The Fermi energy level and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the pQD-ink films were obtained from the cut-off region and valence band region (Fig. S7, ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level was determined using optical bandgap values determined from the first excitonic absorption peak (1.32 eV) and the HOMO level. The HOMO, Fermi, and LUMO levels of the pQD-ink were −5.15 eV, −4.69 eV, and −3.85 eV, respectively, revealing p-type characteristics. The energy levels of the pQD-SSE counterpart were very similar to those of our pQD-ink, as well as other reported values.45,46 The energy levels of the CQDs used in this study are shown in Fig. 2e. In order to investigate the photoactivity of the pQD-ink, we fabricated heterojunction CQDSCs employing the pQD-ink as the active layer. The device structure was indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/pQD-ink/ZnO/Al as shown in the inset of Fig. 2f. CQD active layers with a thickness of ∼150 nm were achieved by one-step spin-coating at 800 rpm using a pQD-ink solution, thus confirming the feasibility of the direct coating process. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G one sun illumination indicated a decent solar cell device behavior. The PCE of the devices was 3.36% with a VOC of 0.59 V, a JSC of 10.24 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55 (Fig. 2f and Fig. S8, ESI†).
Performance of ink-based CQDSCs
In the literature thus far, most of the reported high-efficiency CQDSCs have employed the SSE method combined with LbL deposition for CQD layer fabrication.11,15,47 Very recently, a few studies have reported SSE-free fabrication of n-type CQD active layers using nQD-ink, however the p-type CQD layers were still prepared only through the SSE method.11,12 Combining the aqueous pQD-ink developed in this work with the previously developed nQD-ink,12 we then fabricated SSE-free CQDSCs containing an n–p quantum junction active layer.3,11,15 The structure of the CQDSCs was ITO/ZnO/nQD-ink/pQD-ink/Au as shown in the inset in Fig. 3a and Fig. S9 (ESI†). We designated the CQDSCs which contained nQD-ink/pQD-ink junctions “ink-devices”, to distinguish them from other control devices fabricated in this study. In the ink-devices, each nQD-ink layer and pQD-ink layer was fabricated by direct single-step coating, and no additional SSE was applied. We also fabricated control devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/nQD-ink/pQD-SSE/Au (designated “SSE-devices”) for comparison. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the device performance with respect to the thickness of the pQD-ink and pQD-SSE layers. The PCE of the CQDSCs was optimized at an nQD-ink layer thickness of ∼220 nm in both types of devices (Fig. S11, ESI†). There were no discernable effects associated with the p-type CQD layer thicknesses: the device performance was similar when the p-type CQD layer thickness was between ∼20 nm and ∼50 nm. We also fabricated the ink-devices using pQD-ink solution in various solvent systems (Fig. 1b). All devices using various pQD-ink solutions exhibited comparable performance (Fig. S12, ESI†).

(c) Statistical analysis of device PCE. 30 devices are used for each analysis. (d) Air-storage stability test results. All devices were stored under ambient air conditions without encapsulation. 
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CQDSCs under AM 1.5G one sun illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The ink-device achieved a PCE of 10.91% with a VOC of 0.64 V, a JSC of 23.90 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.71. We also estimated the JSC values from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b), which showed only ∼2% of mismatch, confirming the validity of the device efficiency. The measured PCE of ∼11% is comparable to the state-of-the-art performance in CQDSCs, and is an unprecedently remarkable result compared to other reported SSE-free CQD based devices.38,42 The control SSE-device showed a comparable PCE of 10.94%. The results of the J–V curves and EQE spectra are summarized in Table 1. The statistical analysis of the device performance revealed that the ink-devices exhibited a higher average PCE with narrower performance distribution than the control SSE-devices (Fig. 3c and Table 1). As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the direct coating using pQD-ink can effectively prevent the crack formation due to the volume shrinkage that occurred during the SSE process. Both the ink-devices and SSE-devices also exhibited negligible hysteresis, as depicted in Fig. S14 and Table S5 (ESI†). The ink-devices also demonstrated good air-storage stability, with ∼80% retention of the original PCE after 100 days of storage in an ambient air atmosphere without encapsulation (Fig. 3d).

Ink-devices fabricated by the doctor-blade coating method
From an engineering point of view, the ability to apply direct coating without SSE steps offers versatility for device processing. To fully capitalize on the potential benefits of the SSE-free ink-devices, we fabricated devices using a doctor-blade coating method, which is important for the continuous processing of large area devices. The schematic illustration of the blade coating technique is shown in Fig. 4a (see Experimental section for more details). To optimize the blade-coating conditions, the concentrations and the solvent systems of the pQD-ink and nQD-ink were modified. The concentration of the pQD-ink was lowered to 40 mg mL−1 (vs. 80 mg mL−1 for spin-coating). The solvent system for the nQD-ink was also changed from BA to DMF:BA (50:50 by vol%) to modify its surface wettability on ZnO buffer layers. Various solvent systems could be used as long as the BA vol% was lower than 50%. The use of a BA ratio higher than 50% rendered excessive wetting of the nQD-ink solutions on the ZnO buffer layers, which made it impossible to set the blading condition. The wetting properties of the nQD-inks on the ZnO layer using different solvent systems are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). Overall, the blade coating was readily achievable without sophisticated modification. The images of the bladed films with pQD-ink and nQD-ink on various glass substrates (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm and 2.5 cm × 7.5 cm) are shown in Fig. 4b. The bladed films showed high uniformity over the entire coated substrates.

The scale bars indicate 1 cm. (c) J–V curve of the bladed ink-device with the device parameters in the inset, and (d) statistical analysis of the PCE of the bladed ink devices. The number of devices measured for the statistical analysis was 50, and the inset photograph shows the bladed ink-device. 

Fig. 4c shows the J–V curve of the CQDSCs produced by the blade coating technique under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. The bladed devices achieved a PCE of 10.01%, with a VOC of 0.59 V, a JSC of 27.75 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.62. The negligible mismatch (∼1%) between the integrated JSC from the EQE spectra (27.45 mA cm−2) and the JSC from the J–V characteristic (27.75 mA cm−2) confirmed the high efficiency (Fig. S16, ESI†). The performance of the bladed ink-device was reasonably comparable to that of the spin-coated ink-devices with a relatively lower VOC and FF due to increased charge recombination (Fig. S17 and Table S6, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4d, a statistical analysis of the bladed devices confirmed the reproducibility of the device performance. The average PCE of 50 devices was 9.08 ± 0.39%. The blade-coated devices showed optimum PCE at a higher nQD-ink layer thickness (∼450 nm) compared to the spin-coated devices, which resulted in a higher JSC with a lower FF (Fig. S18, ESI†). The increase in optimum nQD-ink layer thickness in the bladed device compared to the spin-coated device is attributed to the change in the solvent system, in which 50% of higher boiling point DMF was included. However, the bladed devices containing thicker nQD-ink layers still achieved consistently high PCEs because of the benefits of our nQD-inks, with high charge diffusion length.12
We also fabricated devices with larger active area by blade coating. The PCEs of the devices were slightly decreased as the active area increased due to suboptimal CQD layer quality (Fig. S19, ESI†). The inclusion of a substantial amount of a high-boiling point solvent, DMF, in the nQD-ink may hinder the uniformity of nQD layers. Since we used a simple home-made blade coater, the remaining DMF in the nQD-ink films was dried by a post thermal treatment at 105 °C, which is a suboptimal condition to prepare highly uniform films. Application of the blade coaters with meticulous control of the fabrication conditions (constant blading speed at various substrate temperatures) and the use of alternative low boiling point solvents for the nQD-ink coating may further improve the quality of the bladed films. Nevertheless, this is the first report of CQDSCs fabricated by the doctor-blade method, and the resulting high PCE suggests the outstanding potential of the ink-devices with other industrial-friendly processes.
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, CQDSCs with an efficiency of ∼11% were successfully fabricated by SSE-free direct-coating methods. The fabrication of SSE-free devices was enabled by developing aqueous pQD-inks and combining them with nQD-inks to complete the fabrication of the n–p quantum junction active layer. We achieved pQD-inks by manipulating the solvent systems to form stable electric double layers, and the resulting aqueous pQD-ink showed suitable photoactivity. The ink-devices were fabricated by simple direct-coating methods without using any SSE step, and exhibited a PCE of ∼11%. This result is one of the state-of-the-art performances for CQDSCs, and is an unprecedently remarkable result when compared with other reported SSE-free CQD based devices. Because of the simple processability of the CQD inks, ink-device fabrication by doctor-blade coating was also achievable. Notably, this is the first report of CQDSCs fabricated by the doctor-blade method, and the resulting PCE of >10% suggests its outstanding potential use in other industrially friendly processes. The development introduced in this study makes the fabrication of CQDSCs at low temperature as simple as that of organic solar cell devices, which may open new avenues in the field of CQDSC processing for various optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
Colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising types of solar cells, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been expanded to >11% by the efficient use of photons up to the near-infrared regime. In most reported high-efficiency CQD solar cells, however, the fabrication of the CQD active layers has been limited by the cumbersome multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process, with iterations of the in situ solid-state ligand exchange (SSE), creating a critical obstacle to high-throughput processing techniques. In this report, for the first time, high-efficiency CQD solar cells were fabricated without the use of either SSE or LbL techniques, using pre-exchanged p-type and n-type CQD inks. Using these CQD inks, the device fabrication of CQD solar cells becomes as simple as the fabrication of organic solar cells, with the benefits of processing methods at low temperature. CQD solar cells with a PCE of ∼11% were achieved by direct spin-coating methods. Using these p-type and n-type CQD inks, a high-throughput doctor-blade coating technique was readily applicable achieving a PCE of >10%. This solid-state-ligand-exchange free CQD film deposition may pave the road for commercialization of CQD based optoelectronic devices.
