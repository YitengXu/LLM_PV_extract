    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 10th May 2023AbstractMetal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) possess huge potential due to their high power conversion efficiency. However, instability is still a key factor limiting their applications. Therefore, we have found a feasible strategy to improve the light stability of PSCs. Specifically, a core–shell material with a silicon nanosphere core and a nickel oxide nanosheet shell serves as the hole transport layer in our PSCs. Due to the selective absorption of ultraviolet light by the silicon nanoparticles, the ultraviolet light content of the natural light that reaches the perovskite layer is reduced. Compared with a control device (without Si), the PSCs with the silicon/nickel oxide hole transport layer possessed a higher current density of 22.09 mA cm−2 and a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.54%, with both values increased by 2.7% and 6.1%, respectively. More importantly, the PSCs based on a silicon/nickel oxide hole transport layer maintains 85% of its initial power conversion efficiency value after 700 hours of natural light exposure. These results indicate that the silicon/nickel oxide hole transport layer is an important functional component of the PSCs, which improves the photovoltaic performance and reduces ultraviolet light-induced photodegradation, thereby improving the device stability.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as ideal photovoltaic cells owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, low cost and ease of fabrication.1 At present, perovskite solar cells are of immense interest to researchers who are investigating various aspects, such as enhancing charge carrier mobility, improving the light absorption coefficient, extending carrier recombination time, commercialization and encapsulation.2,3 The performance of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells is continuously improving and their photoelectric conversion efficiency has reached 25.5%, which is comparable to silicon-based solar cells.4 However, organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs have poor environmental stability and are extremely susceptible to moisture, oxygen, temperature and light, which severely restrict their large-scale industrial production and applications.5,6 Encapsulation can greatly reduce the decomposition of perovskites by moisture and oxygen. However, encapsulation methods cannot prevent photodegradation because light is the most common environmental factor encountered by photovoltaic devices.7,8 As is well known, ultraviolet light irradiation has a destructive effect on organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.9,10 On the one hand, ultraviolet light will decrease the ability of the perovskite material to produce CH3NH3+ ions, which will cause the key layer of the PSCs device to decompose.11 On the other hand, ultraviolet light will cause unnecessary oxygen defects and vacancies in the PSCs, which will eventually lead to performance degradation.12 Therefore, reducing the proportion of incident UV light on the perovskite layer is a means of improving the photostability of the PSC.
In order to improve the PSC light stability, especially ultraviolet light stability, organic compounds that absorb ultraviolet light have attracted much attention.13,14 The main types of UV absorbers are benzotriazoles, benzophenones, triazines, salicylates and substituted acrylonitriles, etc.15 Molecular structures based on C–F bonds and Si–O bonds have strong ultraviolet light absorption properties.16 However, during the preparation process, organic compounds are more difficult to control than inorganic compounds and are less resistant to high temperature which is not conducive to the fabrication of PSCs.17 Inorganic materials, including silicon, phosphors and rare metals, are thermally stable and convenient to synthesize and have specific ultraviolet light absorption properties. Research into silicon solar cells shows that silicon not only absorbs visible and infrared light, but also demonstrates specific ultraviolet light absorption. Moreover, ultraviolet light is absorbed on the surface of silicon due to its low wavelength and poor ability to penetrate elements. There are two main aspects: one is that the absorption coefficient of silicon or other semiconductors increases toward the ultraviolet band and the other is that the surface states of semiconductor materials cause strong absorption of light on their surfaces.18,19 Nickel oxide (NiO) is one of most widely used hole transport layers (HTLs) because of its high transmittance, wide band gap and considerable stability. In addition, NiO is a hole transport layer material commonly used in PSCs because it has excellent hole extraction ability, and its crystal morphology is convenient to control. Therefore, the adoption of Si/NiO heterostructure nanospheres not only slows down the decomposition of perovskites under natural light, but also improves the interface hole extraction efficiency.
In the present study, we used NiO, commonly used in PSCs, as the main material to maintain hole transport performance while using elemental silicon to absorb ultraviolet light. A new type of UV-absorbing material was developed. Utilizing this hole transport layer material enables the selective absorption of ultraviolet light when sunlight enters the perovskite light-absorbing layer, reducing the degradation of the perovskite material caused by ultraviolet light and prolonging the service life of the device. Compared control PSCs without silicon, the PSCs based on a silicon/nickel oxide hole transport layer (Si/NiO HTL) show a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), with a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) that increases from 16.61% to 17.44%.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2), methylammonium iodide (MAI), and PC61BM were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The 40–60 nm silicon nanoparticles were purchased from Aladdin. Other materials were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without any further purification.
2.2. Preparation of Si/NiO nanospheres
First, 1 mmol of Si nanoparticles was added to 50 mL of deionized water, and then sonicated at high frequency (100 Hz) for 10 minutes and stirred for 30 minutes. After that, 1 mmol of Ni(NO)3, 10 mmol of CH4N2O, and 30 mL of ethanol were added and stirred for 30 minutes. Finally, the solution was maintained at 85 °C for 10 h via a hydrothermal method. The intermediate was obtained by centrifugation and washed to neutrality. Then, the collected intermediate was heated in an Ar atmosphere at 450 °C for 4 h and the final Si/NiO nanospheres were obtained.
2.3. Preparation of Si/NiO nanospheres HTL
Patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Then, the dried FTO was subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 minutes. To adhere the Si/NiO nanospheres firmly to the FTO glass substrate, a NiO thin layer was prepared by spin coating a Ni(NO)3 solution (3 mmol of Ni(NO)3 and 0.2 mL of acetylacetone were dissolved in 20 mL of 2-methoxyethanol at 45 °C for 1 h) on the FTO substrate (3500 rpm for 30 s), which was then heated at 270 °C for 40 min. After that, 0.6 g of the Si/NiO nanospheres were thoroughly mixed into 1 g of terpineol and 10 mL of ethanol. The solution was then spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 40 s onto a thin layer of NiO, and then annealed in N2 at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The NiO nanospheres used as the hole transport layer were grown on the FTO glass substrate using a solvothermal method, and a perovskite solar cell was fabricated as a comparison sample.
2.4. Fabrication of the perovskite solar cells
First, 1 mmol of PbI2 and 1 mmol of CH3NH3I were added into 600 mg of DMF and 80 mg of DMSO solvent and stirred at 60 °C for 4 h. The solution was spin-coated on the hole transport layer at 60 °C (2000 rpm for 10 s). Then, 200 μL of anhydrous chlorobenzene was quickly injected onto the film and left for 3s, followed by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to form a perovskite crystal film, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. An anhydrous chlorobenzene solution containing 20 mg mL−1 of PC61BM was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 seconds on the perovskite film. Finally, a Ag electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporation method and PSCs containing a Si/NiO nanosphere HTL and a NiO HTL were obtained.
2.5. Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Ultra 55, Zeiss, Germany), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, USA), and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) were employed to systematically investigate the morphology and structure of the samples. Furthermore, a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV1102II6812011, China) was utilized to measure the absorption and transmission properties of the samples. A spectrofluorometer (FS5, Edinburgh instruments) with a 465-nm pulsed laser was employed to characterize the photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved PL (TRPL) of the samples. A potentiostat (Im6ex/Zahner) was used to conduct the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization. The photoelectric performance was investigated using a source meter (2400-SCS, Keithley) with an AM 1.5 filter with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation process of the Si/NiO heterostructure nanosphere particles for use as a hole transport layer material is illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, silicon nanoparticles (Fig. 1c) with a diameter of 40–60 nm were uniformly dispersed using ultrasound. Then, the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell was grown on the surface of the Si nanosphere particles. After that, the Si/Ni(OH)2 nanospheres were transformed in situ into Si/NiO nanospheres by annealing at 450 °C for 4 h in Ar (Fig. 1d). Clearly, the NiO covers the Si nanosphere particles well. TEM (Fig. 1b) analysis shows that the shell of NiO is closely anchored on the Si nanospheres. Furthermore, the characteristic (111) lattice fringes of the NiO shell are observed with a spacing of 0.247 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e), indicating its good crystallinity.

Fig. 2a illustrates the crystalline nature of the Si, NiO and Si/NiO nanospheres. It can be observed that the crystal diffraction peaks (2θ) at 28.4°, 47.3°, and 56.1° correspond to the (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes of silicon (JCPDS No. 00-0787), and the diffraction peaks (2θ) at 34.4°, 43.4°, and 63.2° correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the NiO crystal (JCPDS No. 01-1239). The XRD results further indicate the successful formation of NiO with good crystallinity, which is beneficial for the improvement of the electrical properties of semiconductor materials.20 The chemical states of the Si/NiO nanospheres were characterized using XPS measurements (Fig. 2c). It can be seen that the surface elemental composition of the samples is made up of O, Si and Ni. In Fig. 2c, we can observe that the Si 2p peak is at 289 eV and that the O 1s peak is at 530 eV. The intensity of the O 1s peak is unchanged, indicating that the O 1s peak is mainly derived from NiOx and that Si is still in a single crystal state. The Ni2+ peak is at a higher intensity at 885 eV and the NiO is mainly found in the NiOx shell. This structure can sustain hole transport and plays a key role in the absorption of ultraviolet light irradiated on the PSC devices.

The hole transport layer is the substrate on which the deposition and growth of the perovskite occurs. Consequently, the influence of the Si/NiO nanospheres on the quality of perovskite film was studied. Fig. 3a and d show SEM images of the perovskite film on the NiO nanospheres HTL and Si/NiO HTL, respectively. All perovskite films show a uniform and hole-free surface morphology. The difference is that the average grain size of the Si/NiO HTL is 416 nm, which is higher than that of the NiO HTL (342 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films on both NiO and Si/NiO are consistent, and have the same crystal structure, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As demonstrated by the XRD study, the MAPbI3 films on the Si/NiO HTL demonstrate better perovskite phase purity and crystal orientation. The surface morphologies of the perovskite films on the Si/NiO HTL and NiO HTL were further evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 3b and e show that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite film is slightly reduced from 18.6 nm to 16.2 nm by the introduction of Si. These all show better perovskite film purity and crystallinity.21 This is because, compared to FTO, a thin pre-coating layer of NiO can provide a larger surface area and better solution compatibility for NiO nanospheres, which provides a good foundation for the deposition of Si/NiO nanospheres.22 This provides a good foundation for the deposition of NiO nanospheres and creates an excellent hole transport layer. The larger grain size and smaller grain boundary density caused by the Si/NiO HTL lay the foundation for improving the charge transfer efficiency of the perovskite films.23

The Si/NiO nanosphere materials were used as HTLs for the PSC devices. The schematic configuration of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 4a, and they consist of a FTO anode, the Si/NiO nanosphere HTL, the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, PC61BM as an electron transport layer (ETL) and an Ag cathode, with the thickness of each component being 340 nm, 112 nm, 400 nm, 80 nm and 130 nm, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Compared with the control device (Fig. 4b), the increase in the PL intensity of the device based on the Si/NiO nanospheres illustrates a stronger quenching effect and proves that an increase in hole mobility occurred.24 Likewise, the results of the TRPL study show that τ1 and τ2, which are respectively related to the non-radiative recombination induced by the interface trap and the carrier recombination in the monolithic perovskite, are reduced from 7.69 ns and 50.74 ns to 5.24 ns and 43.44 ns after the incorporation of Si/NiO (Fig. 4c).25,26 This finding means that the holes are more efficiently extracted from the perovskite to the HTL interface. Therefore, the Si/NiO configuration can effectively optimize trap reorganization and reduces interface trap density. In order to further study the charge carrier recombination behavior inside the devices, EIS was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 4d with the equivalent circuit diagram shown in the inset. The semicircular width curves shows that the Si/NiO device has higher recombination resistance (Rrec) than the control device, which is related to the interface between the HTL and the perovskite. A larger Rrec means that the recombination of charge carriers is more difficult, leading to easier extraction of electrons and holes at the interface by the materials on both sides.27 This is generally consistent with the PL and TRPL results.

Fig. 5a and Table S1 (ESI†) show the J–V curves of the devices with Si/NiO HTL and NiO HTL. From these J–V curves, the PCE of the control device is 17.61%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.71 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 74%. For the Si/NiO based device, the Jsc is 22.09 mA cm−2, the Voc is 1.10 V, the FF is 78%, and the PCE jumps to 18.54%. These findings strongly indicate that the Si/NiO HTL is a promising choice for the development of high-efficiency devices. It is observed from incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve in Fig. 5b that there is a difference in the IPCE between 350 and 400 nm where the Si/NiO device exhibits a higher IPCE than the NiO device. This is confirmed by the increase in the integrated Jsc from 21.71 mA cm−2 for the NiO device to 22.09 mA cm−2 for the Si/NiO device. The discrepancy in the Jsc value acquired from the J–V scan and IPCE spectrum suggests that they are in good agreement. This improved PCE is mainly attributed to the good quality of the perovskite film and the higher recombination resistance, both of which provide excellent interface hole extraction efficiency. Maximum power point (MPP) tracking measurements were used to further evaluate the stable power output of the PSC device (Fig. 5c). The PCE value of the PSC with Si/NiO HTL is 17.44% and the current density is 21.09 mA cm−2, while the PCE of the control device is 16.61% and its current density is 20.65 mA cm−2. This is consistent with the J–V results, proving that the PSC device with Si/NiO HTL has a higher PCE and stability than the control device.

A previous study found that 280–315 nm ultraviolet light has the greatest influence on PSC devices.28 Perovskite films will decompose under ultraviolet light irradiation, thereby reducing their light absorption rate and causing the device performance to decline, however they can remain stable under irradiation with visible light in the 400–760 nm range.29 Therefore, it is very important to produce PSCs with high ultraviolet light stability. Here, in order to study the ultraviolet light stability of the PSCs, the control PSC and Si/NiO based PSC were continuously irradiated with natural light for 700 hours. As shown in Fig. 6a, after 700 hours of natural light irradiation the control PSC only retained 56% of its initial PCE value. However, the Si/NiO based PSC maintains 85% of its initial PCE in the same environment, indicating that the Si/NiO based PSC is more resistant to ultraviolet light. It can be seen from Fig. 6b–d, that compared with the initial data, the Voc of the control PSC device does not decrease significantly over time while the Jsc decreases rapidly, which leads to a more significant decrease in FF. For the PSC based on the Si/NiO HTL, Voc and Jsc decrease slowly. This shows that the Si/NiO HTL reduces the ultraviolet content of the natural light before it is incident on the perovskite material, thereby protecting the PSC device. Therefore, the introduction of Si/NiO HTL can reduce the ultraviolet light content of the incident light, thereby inhibiting the damage caused by ultraviolet light to the perovskite material, thus playing a vital role in improving the photostability of the PSC.30

4. Conclusions
In summary, we report a feasible strategy to improve the photostability of perovskite solar cells by using Si/NiO hole transport layer materials, a core–shell structure consisting of silicon nanosphere cores and nickel oxide nanosheet shells. The Si nanoparticles can absorb ultraviolet light before the incident natural light is absorbed by the perovskite film. Compared with a control device (without Si), the Si/NiO based PSC achieves a higher light collection efficiency and a higher PCE (18.54%). Importantly, the Si/NiO based PSC can maintain 85% of its initial PCE value after 700 hours of natural light exposure, thus successfully improving the UV stability of the PSC. These results show that the Si/NiO hole transport layer material achieves an improvement in the PSC durability to meet the requirements needed for long-term application of PSCs.
