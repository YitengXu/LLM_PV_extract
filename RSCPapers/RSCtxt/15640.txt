    , Accepted 23rd August 2022First published on 30th August 2022AbstractHigh-performance photovoltaics (PVs) constitute a subject of extensive research efforts, in which silicon (Si)-based solar cells (SCs) have been widely commercialized. However, the low carrier mobility of Si-based SCs can limit the effective charge separation, thereby negatively impacting the device performance. Here, via calculating the physicochemical and PV performance based on density functional theory, we demonstrate SCs based on two-dimensional (2D) group IV and V compounds with an AX3 configuration. Firstly, the cleavage energies of AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) are calculated to be less than 1 J m−2, providing an experimental feasibility to be exfoliated from the corresponding bulk. Secondly, electronic and optical properties have been systematically investigated. To be specific, the band gap of monolayer AX3 falls in the range of 1.11–1.27 eV, which is comparable with that of Si. Significantly, the electron mobility of monolayer AX3 can reach as high as ∼30000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of Si. Furthermore, the optical absorbance of monolayer SiAs3, SiP3 and GeAs3 exhibits high coefficients in visible light. Therefore, we believe that our designed AX3-based PV systems with power conversion efficiency of 20% can offer great potential in the application of high-performance two-dimension-based PVs.
1 Introduction
With the increasingly serious environmental and energy problems, solar cells (SCs) have been widely studied and applied due to their cleanliness and flexibility.1,2 Heterojunction SCs have high conversion efficiency and great potential, expected to be designed as the promising next-generation photovoltaic (PV) technology.3 However, a high-quality heterojunction SC requires both donor and acceptor semiconductors with suitable band gaps to absorb solar radiation, along with high carrier mobility to promote efficient carrier transport to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE).4,5 Consequently, it is essential to seek appropriate semiconductors with ideal band gap and high carrier mobility to improve the PV performance of heterojunction SCs.
Extensive research has been devoted to preparing silicon (Si)-based SCs, including single-junction and multi-junction sub-cells.6–8 The band gap of Si is approximately 1.1 eV, which can facilitate sunlight absorption with relatively low load.9 However, the low carrier mobility (∼1400 cm2 V−1 s−1) of Si can severely limit the effective extraction of charges.10 Therefore, the Si-based SCs usually exhibit low photocurrent and PCE, which suggests an urgent need to replace Si by materials with comparable band gaps and high charge carrier mobilities.
Ever since the successful exfoliation of graphene by the mechanical cleavage method, the past years have witnessed great research interest in 2D materials.11–14 Subsequently, various 2D materials, such as silicene, phosphorene, borophene, and a series of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have been predicted theoretically and synthesized experimentally.15–20 2D materials hold promising potential for developing efficient PV devices due to the appropriate band gap range.21 Recently, a 2D material GeP3 with tunable band gap depending on layer thickness has been predicted by Jing et al.22 Meanwhile, 2D GeP3 possesses higher carrier mobility compared with Si. Moreover, bulk GeP3 is a layer structure material with van der Waals interaction similar to bulk antimony, which has been experimentally synthesized.23 Hence, GeP3 can be exfoliated into monolayer from bulk-like graphene and phosphorene and exhibits semiconducting properties like antimonene.24,25 It has been reported that monolayer GeP3 exhibits excellent device performance, such as photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties.26,27 Therefore, 2D Group IV and V compounds with AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) are worth studying and expected to possess comparable or even superior properties to those of monolayer GeP3.
In this work, the electronic and optical properties of AX3 monolayers have been systematically investigated comprehensively via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrate that single-layer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) are promising candidates for designing highly efficient heterojunction SCs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. The band gap of AX3 falls in the range of 1.11–1.27 eV, which closely resembles that of Si. Furthermore, the mobility of AX3 is higher than that of Si. The optical absorbances of monolayer SiAs3, SiP3 and GeAs3 exhibit high coefficients in visible light. Thence, we designed AX3-based PV systems with the calculated power conversion efficiency of 20%. The 2D materials-based SCs are expected to bring new attempts towards large-scale high-efficiency energy devices in the future.
2 Theoretical methods
First principles calculations were employed using DFT as carried out in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).28 The depiction of electron exchange and correlation functionals were estimated utilizing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.29 Electron–ion interactions were demonstrated by projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.30 The valence electrons for AX3 monolayers consisted of Si 3s23p3, Ge 4s24p3, P 3s23p3, As 4s24p3, and Sb 5s25p3, respectively. An energy cutoff of 500 eV was adopted. All the AX3 monolayers were completely optimized performing a conjugate gradient method until the energy and force convergence criteria were less than 10−5 eV and 0.005 eV Å−1, respectively. The vacuum space of 15 Å along the z direction was used to eliminate interlayer interactions between periodic boundary conditions. Because of the undervalued band gap for the PBE functional ascribed to the artificial self-interaction,31 the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)32 functional with 25% Hartree–Fock exchange energy contribution was introduced to obtain more accurate band gaps. The Brillouin zone was sampled using 21 × 21 × 1 and 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids for electronic structure calculations in the PBE and HSE06 functionals, respectively. The van der Waals interaction between the layers was adopted by Grimme's33 correction to our functionals. Moreover, to check the thermal stability of the AX3 monolayers, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were implemented under an NVT ensemble with the temperature controlled by the Nosé–Hoover method.34 The initiating structures of the AX3 monolayers were used as 3 × 3 supercells (18 A and 54 X atoms) and each molecular dynamics calculation lasted for 5.0 ps within a time step of 2.0 fs.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structures of monolayer AX3
The optimized structures of monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) with the space group of P-m1 are shown in Fig. 1(a). Each A atom is connected to three adjacent X atoms to form a bond, and each X atom forms one A–X bond and two X–X bonds in the primitive cell. The relaxed lattice constants, bond lengths, and buckling heights of the monolayer AX3 are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, the lattice parameter of monolayer GeP3 is optimized to be a = b = 6.99 Å, which agrees well with previous results in the literature.22,25
 Fig. 1  (a) Atomic structure of monolayer AX3 in top and side views. The dashed lines stand for the rhombus primitive cell. Meanwhile, the 2D and 3D ELFs of monolayer SiP3 are presented in (a and b), respectively. 
For deeper understanding of the bonding nature in our systems, the electron localization function (ELF) is calculated.35 The 2D and 3D ELFs of monolayer AX3 are displayed in Fig. 1(a and b) and Fig. S1, S2, (ESI†) which can describe intuitively the chemical bonds. The ELF is in the scope of 0–1, meaning the extent of electron localization. The ELF = 0 and 1 stand for the electrons that are fully delocalized and localized, respectively. Note that plenty of electrons are localized around the X atom instead of the A atom, which illustrates an ionic nature of the A–X bond (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, S2, ESI†). This is in perfect consonance with the 3D ELFs, as shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†). Meanwhile, the Bader charge Q is calculated to further demonstrate that abundant charges are delivered from A to X atoms except monolayer XSb3 as listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
3.2 Stability of monolayer AX3
Stability is critical for practical applications of computationally designed materials,36,37 which can be verified primarily from cleavage energy and cohesive energy (Ecoh). First, the cohesive energies of monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) are calculated by eqn (S1) (ESI†). The cohesive energies of monolayer AX3 range from 3.76 to 4.96 eV per atom (Table S1, ESI†), which are bigger than 2.60 eV per atom,38 meaning the realizability of the formation of single-layer AX3. The cohesive energy decreases with the X element varying from P to Sb when the A element is fixed. Meanwhile, all the Ecohs of AX3 monolayers are larger than that of silicene (2.49 eV per atom) and phosphorene (3.69 eV per atom).39
Next, we further check the stabilities of monolayer AX3 by cleavage energy calculation. Mechanical cleavage40 and liquid phase exfoliation41 are the most commonly used methods to strip single layer materials. The first method is suitable for materials with strong interlayer interaction between layers, whereas the other method is suitable for materials with weak interlayer relationships. To assess the possibility of monolayer AX3 through mechanical exfoliation or liquid phase exfoliation from bulk counterparts, the cleavage energy (Ecl) is calculated by: Ecl = E1L + Ebulk-1L − Ebulk(1)where E1L, Ebulk-1L and Ebulk are the total energies of single-layer AX3, bulk after exfoliation, and bulk before exfoliation, respectively.
In view of the three layers of the bulk AX3, different stacking configurations should be considered comprehensively. There are nine possible stacking patterns for bulk AX3, which sign as AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB and ACC presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All of these stacking patterns can be realized by translating the ABC stacking that has been synthesized experimentally. To confirm the most stable stacking for bulk AX3, the cohesive energy differences (ΔEcoh) in residual stacking and ABC stacking are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). From the calculated results, we find that the most stable pattern for bulk AX3 is ABC stacking. Therefore, ABC stacking is taken as the research object in the calculations of cleavage energy.
To estimate the possibility of mechanical or liquid phase exfoliation, the cleavage energy of one-layer AX3 from a five-layer slab is chosen as the model of bulk AX3 as shown in the insets of Fig. 2.22 With enlarging the distance between the stripping one-layer and the bulk, the Ecl enhances as demonstrated in Fig. 2. All of the AX3 configurations do achieve convergence at about 4 Å. The calculated cleavage energies for monolayer AX3 are in the range of 0.51–0.92 Jm−2, which are in the same range as that of the common experimentally synthesized 2D materials as displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In particular, the cleavage energies of monolayer AX3 are all less than 1.41 J m−2 of blue phosphorene.42,43 Moreover, the cleavage energies of our designed monolayer AX3 are comparable to those of other monolayers. For instance, the cleavage energies of layered Ga2N and GeS2 are 1.09 and 0.52 J m−2, respectively.44,45 Based on the above conclusions, we believe that our monolayer AX3 can be synthesized experimentally in the near future.

3.3 Electronic properties of monolayer AX3
For 2D materials applied in SCs, band gap is an important factor to determine PCE. The band structures of monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) under both PBE and HSE06 functionals are systematically calculated, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is observed that monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) are semiconductors with band gaps between 0.76 and 0.92 eV by the PBE level as presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). While monolayer GeSb3 and SiSb3 exhibit a zero band gap, as listed in Table S1, (ESI†) which is not suitable for PV devices. Due to the underestimation of the band gap in the PBE method, the HSE06 method is also adopted to obtain more accurate values (Fig. 3). All the electronic band structures under the HSE06 functional display the analogous band shapes as with the PBE functional. The band gaps of ASb3 calculated by the HSE06 functional are still proved to be semi-metallic with bands spreading across the Fermi level. Significantly, we find that the band gaps of monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) range from 1.11 to 1.27 eV, which are very close to that of Si. Therefore, our AX3 with suitable gaps may become promising candidates in single-junction SCs. In particular, the band gap of 1.11 eV for monolayer SiP3 is very close to that of Si, which has been widely used in single-junction SCs.46

Next, we further analyze the bonding characteristics of AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) monolayers by the projected density of states (PDOS). Fig. S6(a) (ESI†) displays that the valence band maximum (VBM) of single-layer SiX3 is primarily contributed to the 3pz orbital of Si and npz (n = 3, 4) orbital of X with a strong hybridization, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly occupied by the npz orbital of X. For single-layer GeX3, the orbital contribution in the CBM is the same as single-layer SiX3, as shown in Fig. S6(b), (ESI†), while the states near the VBM are mainly occupied by a strong hybridization of Ge-4pz and X-npx orbitals in single-layer GeX3. Our PDOS results can reveal that orbitals of neighboring A and X atoms are remarkably overlapped in their orbitals in low energy level (see Fig. S6, ESI†).
Ascribed to the semiconducting characteristics and suitable band gaps used in single-junction PV devices of AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) monolayers, it is indispensable to explore whether the semiconductors can be utilized under actual conditions at room temperature. Hence, AIMD simulations are carried out to confirm the thermodynamic stability of AX3 monolayers. To accurately simulate the real stability situation, sufficient 3 × 3 supercells for AX3 monolayers are employed (Fig. S7, ESI†). Note that the geometrical integrities remain fully maintained, associated with A–X and X–X bonds being not broken, meaning the kinetic stabilities of the AX3 monolayers. Meanwhile, the honeycomb systems are retained after 5.0 ps at room temperature as shown in the inset of Fig. S7 (ESI†). In view of the larger cohesive energy, smaller cleavage energy and complete structural integrity during dynamics, we are quite confident about the experimental implementation of AX3 monolayers.
3.4 Optical properties of monolayer AX3
To reveal the potential PV applications, the optical absorption of the monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) based on GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation calculation (GW + BSE)47–49 is performed. As low band gap semiconductors can absorb more sunlight in the visible range, we predict that the 2D AX3 monolayers show significant optical performance with band gaps in the fundamental range. The prediction has been confirmed that our semiconductors attain the 105 cm−1 optical absorption intensity in the visible light region as illustrated in Fig. 4. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents that the optical absorption intensity of AX3 monolayers are all superior to representative 2D materials (monolayer MoS2). In particular, the absorption coefficient of single-layer SiAs3 can reach as high as 106 cm−1. Due to GW + BSE calculations including electron–hole interactions, the optical absorption spectra of our AX3 monolayers are significantly enhanced. The excitonic effect gives rise to red-shifts of the absorption spectra, whereas the quasi-particle (QP) correction brings about the increment of the band gap and then results in blue-shifts of the absorption spectra.38 The first bright excitonic energies (optical gap, EI), direct HSE06 band gaps (EHSEd) and binding energy of excitons (Eb) are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It is found that the EIs are competitive with the direct band gaps calculated by the HSE06 functional (EHSEd). Furthermore, Table S1 (ESI†) also shows that the Ebs of AX3 monolayers (0.28–0.65 eV) are parallel to those of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, 0.51–0.62 eV),50 and less than those of monolayer M2N3 (M = Al, Ga, In; N = S, Se, 0.69–1.09 eV).38 Eventually, AX3 monolayers are efficient solar-harvesting materials in visible light under GW + BSE calculations. Hence, our designed AX3 monolayers can be of huge potential to apply in single-junction PVs.

3.5 Mobility of monolayer AX3
Considering suitable band gaps and excellent optical absorption, monolayer AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) are suitable for PV devices. The carrier mobility is also one of the important performance indicators in designing SCs.51 Attributed to the necessity in achieving the carrier mobility, the rectangular supercell that reflects the carrier conduction along the zigzag (x) and armchair (y) directions in an intuitive way is constructed as illustrated in Fig. S8(a)(ESI†). The electronic band structures and the 2D elastic constant evaluation for single-layer AX3 in a rectangular supercell are also provided in Fig. S8(b–e) and S9 (ESI†). According to the deformation potential (DP) theory,52 associated with eqn (S5) and related methodology in the ESI,† the effective masses m*, DP constant E1i, elastic constant C2D, and carrier mobility μ of single-layer AX3 along the x and y directions have been estimated (Table S3, ESI†). The calculated results show that the carrier mobilities of single-layer AX3 are anisotropic, particularly single-layer XP3. The predicted hole mobility of single-layer SiP3 along the x direction is 1798 cm2 V−1 s−1, about 1.67 times higher than that along the y direction, while due to the smaller  than , the hole mobility of single-layer SiAs3 along the y direction is 1967 cm2 V−1 s−1, about 2.06 times higher than that along the x direction. The anisotropic characteristic is particularly reflected in electron mobility of single-layer SiAs3. It is 31447 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the y direction, about 613 times larger than that along the x direction. For single-layer GeAs3, the hole mobility along the x direction is up to 5768 cm2 V−1 s−1, only 1.15 times higher than that along the y direction, which is attributed to the smaller difference between E1x and E1y than those in single-layer XP3. For single-layer GeP3, mainly owing to the hole and electron E1is along the x and y directions being five and ten times higher than those of single-layer GeAs3, respectively, the mobilities of GeP3 along the x and y directions are at least 10 times smaller than those of single-layer GeAs3, respectively. Analysing the above results, except for single-layer GeP3, the mobilities of single-layer AX3 are higher than that of Si.53
3.6 PCEs of AX3-based SCs
With the characteristics of appropriate band gaps, high mobility and excellent optical absorption, the SiP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3-based SCs are studied. The suitable 2D structures have been selected to form heterojunctions of SiP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3 to be applied in SCs, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). In the light of the designed PV devices presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†) and in combination with eqn (S6), (ESI†) the maximum PCEs of SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based single-junction SCs are calculated. In fact, a heterobilayer including single-layer SiP3 (SiAs3, GeAs3) and ZnO (MoTe2, WS2) can perfectly form a type-II donor–acceptor interface band heterojunction, as presented in Fig. 5a and Fig. S12(a) (ESI†). According to Scharber et al.,54 the PCEs of SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based PV systems can reach 22.15%, 18.52% and 18.08%, respectively, as highlighted in Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S12(b) (ESI†). The PCEs of the SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based single-junction PVs and other existing 2D heterojunction SCs were compared (Table S4, (ESI†) including BTPV-4F/PTB7-Th tandem SC (16.4%),55n-CdS/p-Si heterojunction SC (18.72%),56 CH3NH3PbI3 SC (21%),57 α-AsP/GaN SC (22.1%),36 MoSe2/Ψ-phosphorene SC (20.26%),58 TiNF/TiNCl SC (22%),59 Ti3C2Tx-based silicon heterojunction SCs (20%),60 functionalized silicene/graphene SC (23.34%),61 Te/WTe2 SC (22.5%),62 Te/MoTe2 heterojunction SC (20.1%),62 α-Sb2TeSe2/HfSe2 (22.5%) and β-Sb2TeSe2/BiOI SCs (20.3%).63 Therefore, the proposed SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based heterojunctions SCs are comparable with existing 2D heterojunction SCs.

(c) The graphic description demonstrating light absorption in a single-junction SC. (d) Thermalization losses and below Eg losses in the AX3-based single-junction SCs. (e) Responses of the solar spectra in AX3-based single-junction PV systems. 
Then, the reasons for such results are investigated. Firstly, photons with energy under the band gaps (Eg) of photoactive semiconductors (Eg > Ephoton in magenta, Fig. 5(c and d)) cannot be exploited and then generate below Eg loss. Secondly, photons with energy surpassing the Eg of our semiconductors (Eg < Ephoton in orange in Fig. 5(c and d)) can be assimilated and the induced carriers possess an energy equal to Eg. The superfluous energy vanishes via thermalization loss owing to excited electrons withdrawing to the CBM. The detailed relationships between these parameters are displayed in Fig. S12(b) (ESI†). It is found that the below Eg losses of single-layer SiP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3 increase gradually, while the thermalization losses decrease. Actually, the below Eg losses of single-layer SiP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3 achieve 18.9%, 21.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the thermalization losses of the above monolayers are up to 32.0%, 29.7% and 28.2%. Due to such two losses, the PCEs of SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based SCs cannot exceed lower than the Shockley–Queisser limit. However, the output power of single-layer SiP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3 still reaches 48.9%, 48.5% and 47.9%, respectively, which is the main reason of our designed AX3-based PV systems with PCE of 20%. Furthermore, the optical responses in three single-junction PV systems are shown in Fig. 5(e). It can be observed that 81.0%, 78.3% and 76.2% of the solar spectrum can be utilized in SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based single-junction PVs, respectively. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned quantitative PCEs, our SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based single-junction SCs can realize 22.15%, 18.52% and 18.08%, respectively. Moreover, despite the SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based single-junction PVs being atomically thin, a thicker multilayer (50–100 nm) can be obtained in the form of stacking such heterojunctions to enhance the sunlight absorbance efficiency.64,65 Our freshly proposed single-junction SCs could provide new horizons to exploit binary composition nanomaterials in high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.
4 Conclusions
We have systematically studied the applications of AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As, and Sb) monolayers in PV devices through DFT calculations. The calculated results show that the band gaps of SiP3, GeP3, SiAs3 and GeAs3 range from 1.11 eV to 1.27 eV, which can facilitate light absorption to achieve high photoelectric conversion. In addition, the high absorption coefficients of AX3 (A = Si, Ge; X = P, As) in the visible light range are found. In particular, the absorption ranges of monolayer GeAs3, SiAs3 and SiP3 perform a wider range of strong light absorption. Moreover, the mobilities of GeAs3, SiAs3 and SiP3 are all higher than that of Si. Based on these results, we design SiP3-, SiAs3- and GeAs3-based PV systems with PCEs up to 22.15%, 18.52% and 18.08%, respectively.
