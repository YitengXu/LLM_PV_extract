1. Introduction
With the increasing development of our society, searching for alternative and effective energy supplies has attracted immense attention from both industrial and academic communities, mostly due to the increasing demand for energy sources and the depletion of traditional fossil energies.1 It is reported that the annual energy input of solar irradiation on Earth (5% UV, 43% visible, 52% IR) actually exceeds the annual energy consumption of the world by several orders of magnitude.2 As we all know, solar energy possesses the characteristics of inexhaustibility and no pollution, and is regarded as the most promising renewable energy of the future.3
Recently, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have become highly attractive, due to the fact that they have numerous potential advantages over traditional silicon-based solar cells,4,5 such as low cost, flexibility, large-area capability, easy processing and so on.6 The working principle of organic solar cells relies on the conversion of solar emissions into electrical charges, which are collected in an external circuit.7 The main steps of operation are as follows. (i) Light absorption: light is absorbed in the organic layer and generates electron–hole pairs (excitons); the absorption characteristics of the organic layer should match the solar spectrum as closely as possible. (ii) Exciton dissociation: excitons then have to be dissociated, that is, charge separated; for the charge-separation process to be efficient, the reverse process, which is called charge recombination, must be limited properly. (iii) Charge transport: the charges that remain separated (and hence do not recombine after exciton dissociation) have to drift in the organic layer under the influence of the electric field, which is generated by the equalization of the Fermi energies of the two electrodes. (iv) Charge collection: the charges ultimately have to be collected at the electrodes.1 In other words, the key process set forth above is the dissociation of the photogenerated excitons into separated charges.8
The exciton dissociation and charge recombination both correspond to the charge-transfer reaction and their corresponding rates can be estimated using the weak coupling limit of Marcus theory and extensions thereof.9 What's more, Marcus theory has been widely employed to describe the dynamics of charge transfer and charge recombination in any donor–acceptor system, including organic solar cells.10 The theory is valid, based on the assumption that the system has to reach the transition state for the transfer to occur, though it neglects tunneling effects that can assist the transfer, especially at low temperatures.11 As a development of the Marcus theory, the Marcus–Levich–Jortner energy transfer rate expression emphasizes the vibrationally quantized energy transfer reaction.12 This formula introduces the population of the vibrational state density in the initial reactant and the final product, i.e., the Franck–Condon and intramolecular charge transfer electronic states.13 In the following review, the above discussed formulas both have two forms for the situation without an external electric field and with an external electric field, respectively. It is surprising that one recent paper noted that energy transfer coupled with electron transfer is a convenient approach to mimic photosynthesis in light energy conversion.13
It has been reported that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can significantly enhance the light harvesting and photocurrent generation in solid-state dye sensitized solar cells,14,15 because of both exciton energy transfer and nanoscale charge generation in the blend via the formation of an excited state complex with charge transfer character.16
The tools and techniques of visualization have become extremely attractive to understand and explore the optoelectronic properties of solar cells. There are several elaborate theoretical approaches that have been used to inspect visually all molecular orbitals contributing to the excitation for large conjugated carotenoids and polymers.17 One is the two-dimensional (2D) real-space analysis of the transition density matrix, representing the electronic transition between the ground state and the electronically excited state,18–25 which is used to analyze the electron–hole coherence and the excitation delocalization of conjugated molecules.17 Another one is the three-dimensional (3D) real-space analysis of the transition density (TD) and charge difference density (CDD),18,21 which has been used to analyze the charge and energy transfers in several conjugated polymers. The combination of 2D and 3D real-space analysis methods has been widely used to study the excited-state properties of polymers.18,21,26,27
In this review, we review the available methods of photoinduced charge transfer and the visualization methods of several systems including one-photon, two-photon and charged systems, respectively. This review will not only promote a deeper understanding of the available theories and methods of photoinduced charge transfer, but also advance further developments in this field.
2. Theoretical method of PICT
2.1 Semi classical Marcus theory for photoinduced charge transfer (PCT)

2.1.1 Semiclassical Marcus theory for PCT without an external electric field. 
Marcus has published a series of essays about electron transfer reactions since 1956 and created the electron transfer reaction theory called Marcus theory:9 (1)where λ is the reorganization energy, VDA is the electronic coupling (charge-transfer integral) between the donor and acceptor, ΔG is the free energy change for the electron transfer reaction, kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and T is the temperature.
Marcus theory has been widely employed to describe the dynamics of charge transfer and charge recombination in any donor acceptor system, including organic solar cells. As an example, Sun et al. calculated the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination using Marcus theory when they studied theoretical characterization of the PC60BM:PDDTT model for an organic solar cell.
The charge transfer integral (electronic coupling matrix) can be calculated with the Generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model,28 and in the two-state (S0 and Sn states) formulation: (2)where μtr is the calculated transition dipole moment along the y axis (see Fig. 1), ΔE is the vertical excitation energy, and Δμ is the dipole moment difference between the two states and can be estimated by using a finite field method based on the excitation energy:29 (3)where Eexc(0) = ΔE is the excitation energy at zero field and Δα is the change in the polarizability. The reorganization energy λ consists of inner reorganization energy and outer reorganization energy, while the latter is not easy to estimate quantitatively in the solid state, so Kavarnos et al. only calculated the inner reorganization energy and reported that upon electron transfer it consists of two terms:30λ = λ1(A) + λ2(D)λ1(A) = E(A−) − E(A) λ2(D) = E(D) − E(D+)(4)Here, E(A−) and E(A) are the energies of the neutral acceptor A at the anionic geometry and optimal ground-state geometry, respectively, and E(D) and E(D+) are, accordingly, the energies of the radical cation at the neutral geometry and optimal cation geometry. In the exciton dissociation and charge recombination, ΔG = ΔGCT and ΔGCR, respectively. The ΔGCR can be estimated with: ΔGCR = EIP(D) − EEA(A)(5)where EIP(D) and EEA(A) are the ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor, respectively. These quantities are normally estimated from the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the donor and acceptor, respectively.31 The ΔGCT can be estimated with the Rehm–Weller equation:31 ΔGCT = −ΔGCR − ΔE0–0 − ΔEb(6)where ΔE0–0 is the energy of the lowest excited state of the free-base donor and Eb is the exciton binding energy.

Sun and coworkers calculated rates of photoinduced charge transfer and the charge recombination in the donor–acceptor system of PDDTT–PC60BM (see Fig. 1). The excited state properties of the charge transfer density revealed that S1 and S2 of the PDDTT–PC60BM complex are localized excited states of PDDTT, and S3 is the lowest charge transfer excited state (see Fig. 2), and VDA in eqn (2) was estimated with S3. Note that the S3 and S4 charge transfer excited states are degenerate in energy, so the authors also considered the three-state Mulliken–Hush model. Finally, VDA = VDA(S3←0) + VDA(S4←0) = 66.0 cm−1, and the calculated inner reorganization energy is 0.194 eV. The calculated ΔGCR = −1.388 eV and ΔGCT = −0.272 eV.10 Note that the negative ΔGCT means that electron transfer is thermodynamically favorable. From the above, the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination were calculated with eqn (1) (T = 300 K in this calculations) and the results indicated that this donor–acceptor heterojunction has fast charge transfer (5.77 × 1011 s−1) and slow charge recombination (3.76 × 105 s−1).10

The Marcus equation for the nonadiabatic electron transfer has also been developed. The nonadiabatic electron transfer rate between two centers held at a fixed distance and orientation is defined as:31,32 (7)where A is a constant (2.5 × 10−2), kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the room temperature, β is the attenuation factor, r is defined by the distance from the donor moiety (the central nitrogen atom) of the dye to the TiO2 interface, and ΔG0 is the energy difference between the LUMO of TiO2 and the HOMO of the dye. λ is the inner reorganization energy, which contains the solute part λsen and the solvent part λsol: (8)Accordingly, λsen can be defined as  and , where  are the calculated energies from the excited state in the form of the cation, the energies of the relaxed excited state, the cationic energies calculated in the geometry of the excited state and the energies of the relaxed cationic state, respectively.1 For solvents as a dielectric continuum, the reorganization energy is simply: (9)where RD, RA, R, ε∞, and εs are the radii of the donor and acceptor, the distance between their centers, the optical frequency, and static relative dielectric constants of the solvent, respectively.1
As we known, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs is determined by the short-circuit current density (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and the fill factor (FF), and is defined as follows:33 (10)Here, Pin is the solar power incident on the cell. The JSC is the integral of the short-circuit photocurrent density, which can be expressed as:33 (11)Here, the factor Φinj is the electron injection efficiency and ηcoll is the electron collection efficiency. LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency at the maximum wavelength, which can be approximately described as:34 LHE = 1 − 10−f(12)where f is the oscillating strength at the maximum absorption peak (λmax) in this equation. The electron injection efficiency (Φinj) is related to the free energy change during the electron-injection process. This free energy change can be obtained using the injection driving force (ΔGinject):35 ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB(13)Here, Edye* is the excited state oxidation potential, and ECB is the reduction potential of the conduction band of the semiconductor. Edye* can be calculated using the following equation: Edye* = Edye − E00(14)Here, Edye is the ground state oxidation potential for the isolated dye, and E00 is the vertical transition energy.10 Because the real short-circuit current density is restricted by complex factors, Sun et al. further estimated the other two items: the adsorption energy (Eads) and the lifetime (t) of the first excited state (S1). Eads is defined as: Eads = Edye+TiO2 − (Edye + ETiO2)(15)where Edye, ETiO2, and Edye+TiO2 are the total energies of the isolated dye, TiO2, and dye–TiO2, respectively. The excited state lifetimes of the dye sensitizers can be calculated by the equation: t = 1.499/(fE2)(16)where E (cm−1) is the excitation energy of the different electronic states, and f is oscillator strength of the electronic state.36 Besides the JSC, the overall conversion efficiency is also determined by the open circuit voltage (VOC), which can be described as:37 (17)where (18)Here, ECB is the conduction band edge of TiO2, Eredox is the redox potential of the electrolyte, kbT is the thermal energy, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the CB, NCB is the accessible density of CB states, and ΔECB is the shift in CB when the dye adsorbs on the surface of TiO2. For the description of ΔECB, ε0 and ε are the permittivity of the vacuum and the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer, respectively. As for ΔECB, it can be expressed by the formula: ΔECB = ΔECB,solv + ΔECB.ions + ΔECB,dye(19)where ΔECB,solv, ΔECB.ions, and ΔECB,dye stand for the shifts induced by the solvent, ions and adsorbed dye, respectively.
The Marcus equation for the nonadiabatic electron transfer has been used in the systems of XY1, XY2 and XY3 (see Fig. 3). Their geometric structures reveal that dyes XY1 and XY2 are D–A–π–A structures, and dye XY3 is considered as a D–π–A–A structure. The μnormal is the component of the dipole moment grafted on the surface of the semiconductor, as shown in Fig. 4(a), and the value of ΔECB is mainly determined by the structure of the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 4(b), because the influence of the solvent and ions can be regarded as constant under the same experimental conditions.1

For the D–A–π–A system in a DSSC, there are mainly two paths of charge recombination, and one of the paths is between the injected electrons and the dye cation (inner-path recombination). The Marcus rate of this path can be calculated with eqn (7) (T = 298.15 K, β = 0.7 Å−1) (see Table 1). Note that the kET of XY2 (1.49 × 108 s−1) is significantly lower than that of XY3 (1.98 × 1011 s−1) by about 3 orders of magnitude. The slower electron recombination rate of XY2 and XY1 compared with the kET of XY3 indicates that the D–A–π–A configuration is more prominent in reducing electron losses. Finally, the highest conversion efficiency is 6.69%, which is obtained by XY2.1

From the above discussion, it is not difficult to find that the method of calculating the Marcus rate is more convenient in the second case, because only λ, including λsen and λsol, needs to be calculated, but the first example requires not only the calculation of λ and ΔG, but also the calculation of VDA through Δμ. Therefore, the second method is worthier of our appreciation in terms of simplicity.


2.1.2 Semiclassical Marcus theory for PICT with an external electric field. 
We have discussed the semiclassical Marcus theory for PICT without an external electric field. Next, let's talk about the situation with an external electric field. As shown in eqn (1), the electron transfer rate can be calculated in an organic solar cell, but there are many changes that take place under the influence of an external electric field. One of the key points is evaluating the external field effect on the electronic coupling VDA. For a given pair of diabatic states corresponding to the donor and acceptor, the external electric field dependent electronic coupling matrix element can be expressed using the GMH model:38 (20)where μij is the transition dipole moment between the adiabatic electronic states i and j, ΔE = Ej − Ei is the vertical excitation energy, μi − μj = Δμ is the difference between the stationary dipole moments, and μa − μd is the difference between the stationary dipole moments of the diabatic donor and acceptor states. All of the parameters depend on the external electric field. Using a finite field method on the excitation energy, the transition energy dependence on the static electric field Fext can be expressed as:29 (21)where Eexc(0) = ΔE = Ej − Ei is the excitation energy at zero field, Δμ is the change in the permanent dipole moment upon electronic transition, and Δα is the polarizability change. The electronic coupling matrix element can also be expressed as:38 VDA(Fext) = γVDA(0)(22)γ provides a convenient diagnostic indicator of the influence of the external electric field on the electronic coupling matrix element VDA. If two limiting cases, (Δμ)2 ≪ 4(μij(Fext))2 and (Δμ)2 ≫ 4(μij(Fext))2, need to be considered, the external electric field dependent electronic coupling VDA in eqn (6) can be simplified as:38 (23)For the exciton dissociation and charge recombination, ΔG = ΔGCT and ΔGCR, respectively. ΔGCT(Fext) can be estimated by two different methods, one of which is shown below:38,39 ΔGCT(Fext) = ED+(Fext) + EA−(Fext) − ED*(Fext) − EA(Fext) + ΔEcoul(24)with (25)where ED*, ED+, EA and EA− represent the total energies of the isolated donor in the equilibrium geometries of the lowest excited state and the cationic state, and the total energies of the isolated acceptor in the equilibrium geometries of the ground state and the anionic state, respectively. Another method is as follows:38 ΔGCT(Fext) − ΔGCT(0) = −ΔμCTFext(26)ΔGCR can be estimated from expressions similar to eqn (5), but involving the charge-separated state and the ground state:38 ΔGCR(Fext) = ED(Fext) + EA(Fext) − ED+(Fext) − EA−(Fext) + ΔEcoul(27)where (28)The reorganization energy includes two contributions. (i) The inner part, λi, which describes the changes in the geometry of the donor and acceptor moieties upon charge transfer. λi can be calculated as:39 (29)where λi1 and λi2 refer to the difference between the energy of the reactants in the geometry characteristic of the products and that in their equilibrium geometry and the difference between the energy of the products in the geometry characteristic of the reactants and that in their equilibrium geometry, respectively:λi1 = [ED*(QP) + EA(QP)] − [ED*(QR) + EA(QR)] λi2 = [ED+(QR) + EA−(QR)] − [ED+(QP) + EA−(QP)](30)where QR and QP refer to the equilibrium geometries of the reactants and products, respectively. (ii) The outer reorganization energy, λs, which can be estimated by: λs(Fext) − λs(0) = −ΔμFext(31)For the two methods of ΔGCT(Fext), see Fig. 5, eqn (31) provides an effective method to evaluate the external electric field-dependent free energy, because optimization of the structure of the ground-state donor–acceptor system at different external electric fields is not used. This will speed up the calculations considerably.38
 Fig. 5  Gibbs free energy of the exciton dissociation and charge recombination reaction (ΔGCT and ΔGCR) plotted versus the external electric field: (a) calculated by using eqn (7) and (9); (b) calculated by using eqn (8).38 
For the BHJ solar cell materials, the polymer bulk heterojunction is structurally disordered without any preferred orientation of the field with respect to the junction. Therefore, Sun et al. carried out the calculations for both positive and negative values of the field. Fig. 6 reveals that the changes in Vda with the field (visualized via γ) for LE(F) and LE(QT) are rather small, while in the ICT state the coupling strength between the donor and acceptor increases substantially following the increase of Fext. Obviously, the vector properties of Fext should be considered when the effect of the external electric field is taken into account. It has been reported that ΔGCT(Fext) for exciton dissociation upon donor photoexcitation becomes increasingly negative when the external electric field is increased (going from −0.62 eV at Fext = −20 × 10−5 to −0.75 eV at Fext = 20 × 10−5 a.u.). At the same time, ΔGCR(Fext) for charge recombination becomes less negative following the increase of the electric field (see Fig. 7). Note that the inner reorganization energy is insensitive to the external electric field from Fig. 8a, and λiCT = 0.371 eV, and λiCR = 0.233 eV at Fext = 0. Furthermore, the values of the outer reorganization energy of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend (see Fig. 8b) are found to decrease from 0.434 eV to 0.309 eV and from 0.296 to 0.171 eV for the exciton dissociation and charge recombination, respectively, following the increase of Fext in the range of −20 to 20 × 10−5 a.u. As shown in Fig. 9, the rate of exciton dissociation in the lowest ICT excited state of the PCDTBT (PC70BM blend (∼1011 s−1)) increases by a factor of ∼5 when varying the electric field from Fext = −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 a.u. Furthermore, the rate of charge recombination is smaller than the corresponding rate of charge separation. The relative slowness of the recombination process originates from the vanishingly small electronic couplings and from the fact that recombination occurs deep in the inverted Marcus region (|ΔGCR| = 2.029 eV ≫ λCR = 0.467 eV, at Fext = 0).8

From the comparison between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 discussed above, we can see that the external field mainly influences the electronic transition energies and charge transfer integral for the charge transfer excited states, but there is little influence on the electronic transition energy for the local excited states, inner reorganization energy, and free energy changes. In any case, we can analyze specific problems and adopt appropriate methods to calculate them accordingly.

2.2 Marcus–Levich–Jortner's formalism for PICT

2.2.1 Marcus–Levich–Jortner's formalism for PICT without an external electric field. 
The expression of charge-transfer rate in the semiclassical limit of Marcus theory has been discussed, but it neglects tunneling effects that can assist the transfer, especially at low temperatures, while Marcus–Levich–Jortner's formalism takes these factors into consideration and the electron-transfer rate is written as:40 (32)where VRP can be expressed as eqn (32), with just a change in the subscript. ΔG0 has been estimated as the energy difference of the constituents in their final and initial states and the equations for exciton dissociation are shown as eqn (7). The internal part of the reorganization energy λi can be estimated in either of two ways as shown as eqn (29) to eqn (31). The external part of the reorganization energy λs is calculated as:40 (33)where εs is the static dielectric constant of the medium and ε0p is the optical dielectric constant; RD and RA are the effective radii of the Pc and PTCDI molecules.
For a full quantum-chemical treatment in model donor/acceptor pairs for organic solar cells, the transmission direction is a vertical transition from the initial to the final state,41,42 and the value of the electric field is tuned in the INDO/SCI calculations to reproduce the same ratio for the energies of the DA → D*A and D*A → D + A-transitions, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The variation in the magnitude of the electronic coupling between the two processes is driven by the symmetry of the relevant molecular orbitals (see Fig. 11).43,44 For the exciton dissociation, the electronic coupling reflects the degree of overlap between the LUMO/LUMO+1 level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor, while for the charge recombination, it is the overlap between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. Note that the free-base Pc molecule exhibits two close, low-lying excited states separated by just 0.09 eV and polarized perpendicularly to one another along the two main branches of the conjugated core, see Fig. 12, but Lemarus et al. assumed that the energetics of the two states are the same,11 because their energy differences are very small, which means that they can be seen as energy degeneracy.
 Fig. 10  Potential energy curves of the donor/acceptor pair in the ground state (DA), the lowest intramolecular excited state (D*A), and the lowest charge-transfer state (D + A−). We illustrate the nature of the transitions calculated at the AM1-CI/COSMO level and the dielectric constants chosen to do so in order to calibrate the location of the CT state in the INDO/SCI calculations for the two processes.11

 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of perylene bisimide (PTCDI, left) and phthalocyanine (Pc, right). The arrows represent the polarization directions of the lowest two excited states of Pc.11 
Note that the electronic coupling increases from ∼500 to ∼800 cm−1, when the energy of the CT state is raised, and the same behavior is obtained from CI calculations mixing only the HD → LD and HD → LA configurations (see Fig. 13), and David et al. obtained an electronic coupling of 472 and 775 cm−1 for static dielectric constants of 3 and 5, respectively. As shown in Fig. 14, ΔG0dis becomes increasingly negative when the dielectric constant is increased (going from −0.23 eV at εs = 3 to −0.41 eV at εs = 5) even though the Coulombic term ΔEcoul is reduced by screening effects (from −0.49 eV at εs = 3 to −0.29 eV at εs = 5). In contrast, ΔG0rec becomes less negative when the polarity of the medium increases, as a result of the increasing stabilization of the charge separated state. The sum of ΔG0rec and ΔG0dis has an almost constant value (on the order of 1.9 eV, which is consistent with the energy of the lowest excited state of Pc) because the separation between the ground state and the intramolecular excited state is only slightly affected by the medium polarity. The reorganization energies λi1 and λi2 are equal to 0.147 and 0.285 eV, respectively, yielding an average value of 0.216 eV. ε0p has a typical value of 2.25, RD = 4.06 Å and RA = 3.45 Å. The λs reorganization energy evolves from 0.237 to 0.524 eV on going from a static dielectric constant of 3 to 5 and it increases with the medium polarity. Consequently, it can be calculated that when εs = 3, λi = 0.055 eV, ΔG0 = −1.16 eV, VRP = 373 cm−1, and k = 1.1 × 1010 s−1; and then when εs = 5, λi = 0.055 eV, ΔG0 = −1.34 eV, VRP = 544 cm−1, and k = 2.7 × 1011 s−1.20

2.2.2 Marcus–Levich–Jortner's formalism for PICT with an external electric field. 
As a development of the Marcus theory, the Marcus–Levich–Jortner ET rate expression emphasizes the vibrationally quantized ET reaction, and can be expressed as eqn (14), where the Huang–Rhys factor S characterizes the electron–vibration coupling, which is directly related to the inner reorganization energy λi, and the inner reorganization energy can be expressed as:12 (34)The effective Huang–Rhys factor can be defined by the effective high-frequency ωeff using the equation:12 (35)
For a PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in an external electric field, the qualitative vibration–relaxation-related potential energy curves are shown in Fig. 15.12
 Fig. 15  Qualitative vibration–relaxation-related ET-reaction potential energy curves.12 
Note that the value of ΔGCS increases with the increase of Fext, while the situation of ΔGCR is the opposite. The effect of Fext on λs is larger than that of λi. For Vda, the electronic coupling for the CR process is more significantly affected by Fext than that of the CS process, and the fact that electronic coupling increases with Fext indicates that the external electric field can increase the charge transfer efficiency in the oriented system (see Table 2).12 The vibration-resolved CS and CR rates of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in the lowest ICT excited-state, at different Fext strengths, are shown in Fig. 16a. The CS process is significantly accelerated under the bias of Fext along the direction of the ET reaction for the forward ET reaction, and the kCS value in the low-frequency region (−2.0 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 a.u.) is clearly larger than that in the high-frequency region. The calculated rate of the CR process significantly increases in the high-frequency vibrational region, see Fig. 16b, and the calculated rate of the CR process is so small that it can be neglected when compared with the corresponding rate of CS in the low-frequency region.12 From Fig. 17, kCR and kCS were calculated using the Marcus and Marcus–Levich–Jortner equations (ωeff = 1500 cm−1, and the Seff values were 1.004 and 1.105 for CR and CS, respectively, see Fig. 18), and we found that the low-frequency approximate semiclassical Marcus theory overestimates the CS rate by approximately one order of magnitude and the Marcus theory was found to underestimate the CR rate by approximately at least four orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is essential to consider the influence of the vibrational excitation and perturbed nucleus–electron interactions for ET reactions.12

2.3 PICT for FRET
It has been reported that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can significantly enhance the light harvesting and photocurrent generation in solid-state dye sensitized solar cells.45,46 Therefore, photoinduced charge transfer accompanied by FRET may be a feasible way to improve the performance of organic solar cells. There is a relation as follows:13−ΔGCT = 2VDA = λCTs1 = λCTs2 = (EF(D) + λCRs(R)) − (EF(A) + λCRs(P))= (EF(D) − EF(A)) + (λCRs(R) − λCRs(P)) = ΔEF − λCRs(A)(36)ΔEF = EF(D) − EF(A), where EF(D) and EF(A) are the fluorescence energy of the donor and fluorescence energy of the acceptor, and λCRs(R) and λCRs(P) are the reorganization energies for the reactants and product, respectively, and for FRET, λCRs(R) = λCRs(D) and λCRs(P) = λCRs(D) + λCRs(A), so λCRs(R) − λCRs(P) = −λCRs(A). In FRET systems, the Marcus–Levich–Jortner formalism in eqn (32) can be simplified as:13 (37)If ΔG + λs + ħω = 0 in eqn (32), eqn (37) can be further simplified as:13 (38)The rate of charge recombination can be calculated with:13 (39)where ΔGCR = −(EF(A) + λCRs) and λCRs = λCRs(A) + λCRs(D). Here, ħω can be ignored, since EF(A) ≫ ħω. Therefore, the simplified rate of charge recombination can be written as:13 (40)
For the J51(D) and ITIC(A) system, there are two fluorescence peaks in the donor; one is at about 560 nm with a weak peak of fluorescence, and the other is at about 625 nm with a strong peak of fluorescence (see Fig. 19a).13 There is a strong fluorescence peak of the acceptor at around 730 nm (see Fig. 19b). From Fig. 20a–d, with the increase of the acceptor, the fluorescence peaks at 560 and 730 nm gradually increase, while the fluorescence peak at about 630 nm gradually decreases. The comparison of the relative increase of the fluorescence energy at around 560 nm and 630 nm demonstrates that FRET mainly occurs between the fluorescence peak of the donor in the region of 600 to 650 nm and the absorption peak of the acceptor in the same region. It can be concluded that the FRET results from the fluorescence peak at 630 nm, and not from the fluorescence peak at 560 nm (see Fig. 21).13 That is to say, FRET mainly occurs in the channel with low energy. However, there are two PICT channels and two FRET channels (see Fig. 22), but in general, S1 is the most important channel for PICT, because the inner reorganization energy is the smallest via vibrational relaxation. Therefore, the PICT and FRET can promote each other in organic solar cells, the nature of which can be interpreted with Fig. 23a.13

As we have discussed above, there are many theoretical methods for PICT, and here we have provided the three typical ones. In my opinion, one of them might be more advanced and convenient, namely FRET, but every coin has two sides, and it is more important that the methods be evaluated on a case by case basis.
3. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization methods
3.1 Two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization methods of one photon
Recently, several elaborate theoretical approaches have been used to inspect visually all molecular orbitals, in order to study the relationship of chemical structure and optoelectronic properties. One is the two-dimensional (2D) real-space analysis of the transition density matrix, which is used to analyze the electron–hole coherence and the excitation delocalization of conjugated molecules.19,20,24,47–49 Another one is the three-dimensional (3D) real-space analysis of transition density and charge difference density, which has been used to analyze the charge and energy transfers in several conjugated polymers.29,32 The combination of 2D and 3D real-space analysis methods has been used to study the excited-state properties of polymers.18,26,27
In order to characterize the excited state by observables, two matrices are defined:50–52 (41)where the vectors CCIn,ai are based on the configurations of the unoccupied and occupied molecular orbitals a and i, respectively. cLCAOaμ and cLCAOiv are the coefficients that represent the molecular orbitals given by linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs) μ and v in turn. There are two different representations of the matrices Q(n)μv and P(n)μv for visual characterization of the excited states.17
(1) Real-space representation
In real-space the oscillating CEO coordinate and momentum are given as:17 (42)If r = r′ (43)where (44)The transition density contains information about the spatial location of the excitation and is directly related to the transition dipole:17 (45)Besides the transition density, there is another significant quantity for real-space characterization of excitons, which can be expressed as: (46)where ρnn(r) represents the difference in electron distribution between the excited state |Sn〉 and the ground state |S0〉.
(2) Site representation
The site representation of the CEO coordinate and momentum can be expressed as: (47)where  gives the atomic sites A and B where electrons and holes oscillate from and to, while  is a measure of the delocalization of the exciton as a whole (Fig. 24).17
 Fig. 24  The chemical structures of compounds 9 and 11.17 
For compounds 9 and 11, their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 25. Note that the density of the HOMOs is mainly delocalized on the benzene ring, while the density of the LUMO is localized on the whole polymer (see Fig. 26). It can be concluded that the electrons transfer from the central benzene ring to the two pyridyl rings from the situation that all the holes are localized on the benzene ring and all the electrons are localized on the two pyridyl rings in the absorption processes from Table 3.17 The dipole moment in the fluorescence is larger than that in the absorption (see Table 3), due to the delocalization of the electrons and holes. Note that employing the 2D real-space analysis with transition density matrices to study the electron–hole coherence, see Fig. 26, one finds that electron–hole pairs are mainly localized on the benzene rings.17 And due to the protonation and subsequent intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the electron–hole pairs are more delocalized on the two pyridyl rings for compound 11. The electron–hole coherences in the fluorescence are much weaker than those in the vertical absorption and the electron–hole coherences mainly localized on the two pyridyl rings by comparing the electron–hole coherence of absorption and fluorescence at the first excited states for compound 9. Note that the electron–hole coherences on the benzene ring of compound 9 become weaker, and the electron–hole coherences on the two pyridyl rings become stronger, so the electron–hole pairs are more delocalized, and compound 11 exhibits a similar tendency.17,53

3.2 Two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization methods of two-photons
The TPA cross section is defined as:54–56 (48)where a0 is the Bohr radius, c0 is the speed of light, α is the fine structure constant, ω is the photon energy of the incident light, and g(ω) denotes the spectral line profile, which is assumed to be a δ function. Γf is the lifetime broadening of the final state.57δtp can be calculated as: δtp = 6(Sxx + Syy + Szz)2 + 8(Sxy2 + Sxz2 + Syz2 − SxxSyy − SxxSzz − SyySzz)(49)where Sαβ is the two-photon matrix element for the two-photon resonant absorption of identical energy. Sαβ can be calculated with sum-over-state formulas:58 (50)where |g〉 and |f〉 denote the ground state and final states, respectively, |j〉 means all the states, ωj is the excited energy of the excited states, and μ is the electronic dipole moment.58 If j = j′: (51)where θj is the angle between the vector 〈f|μ|j〉 and 〈j|μ|g〉, μfg = 〈f|μ|f〉 − 〈g|μ|g〉 is the difference between the permanent dipole moments of the excited and ground states, and ϕ is the angle between the two vectors μfg and 〈f|μ|g〉.58
The singlet Bu (OPA allowed) and Ag (TPA allowed) excited states can be written as:59 (52)and (53)where |ψk(Ag)〉− and |ψk(Ag)〉+ stand for the second and the higher Ag (two-photon allowed) excited states, respectively.59 So the electronic state dipolar transitions from |ψj(Bu)〉 to |ψk(Ag)〉 can be written as: (54)The relation between the transition dipole moment and transition density is:60 (55)The transition density on the electronic transition between the excited states for TPA can be written as:58 (56)where φm(φu) and φn(φo) stand for the unoccupied and occupied molecular orbitals. The charge difference density on the electronic transition from the j excited state to the k excited states for TPA can be written as:58 Δρ±,k,j = Δρ±,m,u ± Δρ±,n,o(57)where Δρ±,m,u and Δρ±,n,o are: (58)and (59)The probability amplitudes |ψj(Bu,q,r)〉 (OPA allowed) and |ψk(Ag,q,r)〉± have one charged particle in atomic orbital q on site x and the second in atomic orbital r on site y given by:58 (60)and (61)where |ψk(Ag,q,r)〉− and |ψk(Ag,q,r)〉+ stand for the second and the higher Ag two-photon allowed excited states, respectively. CLCAOq(h+) and CLCAOr(e−) are the corresponding linear combination of atomic orbital coefficients in the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in the lth configuration. CCIl is the associated configuration-interaction (CI) expansion coefficient. The orthonormalization of the basis set imposed by the ZDO approximation ensures that:63 (62)
The singlet Bu and Ag excited states can be seen from Fig. 27. The simulated TPA spectrum is shown in Fig. 28 (the damping constant is set to 0.1 eV), the third excited state is the strong absorption in TPA, and there are two channels for this excited state, δtp(S3 ← S2 ← S0) and δtp(S3 ← S1 ← S0). μ2←0 is small, though μ3←2 is large (Table 4), so δtp(S3 ← S2 ← S0) should be small.47 The absorption strengths of the lowest two singlet excited states are very weak (see Table 4). The transition dipole moment 〈1|μ|0〉 is large (see Table 5), while 〈2|μ|1〉 is vanishingly small (see Table 4), so δtp(S2) is very small. For the ZINDO calculation, the calculated orientation of the transition density for S2←1 is from the F to E unit of BTD (see Fig. 29). μ3←1 > μ1←0, so the charge transfer capability for S3←1 is larger than that of S1←0 (see Fig. 30), and the exciton size of S3←1 is larger than that of S1←0 (see Fig. 31).58

3.3 Two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization methods for charged systems
The above discussion is on the 2D and 3D methods in neutral systems; in fact, these methods are also suitable for a charged system.
Sun and coworkers studied the electronic structure and charge transfer of ppp cation radicals theoretically. It was found that most extra positive charges move to two outer units upon excitation (see Fig. 32), which were mostly localized on the two central units in the ground state.61 Therefore, direct visual evidence for quinoidal charge delocalization in the PPP cation radical can be clearly derived. From Fig. 33, the exciton for S1 is within two adjacent units (AB units and CD units, see |Q|2), while the electron–hole oscillation is between AB units and CD units, so S1 is a strong charge transfer (between AB and CD) excited state (see |P|2). Note that the exciton of S8 is not strongly localized within two adjacent units (AB units and CD units) but rather is very delocalized (see Fig. 33) and the ability of charge transfer between the units of S8 is much weaker than that of S1 (see Fig. 32). The real space transition densities for S1 show significantly different characteristic features from that of S8 (see Fig. 34). Therefore, the transition dipole moment of S1 represents mesoscopic dipole antennae, while the transition dipole moment of S8 should rather be represented by a series of small transition dipoles, one per monomeric unit.62

 Fig. 34  The transition densities of S1 and S8, where the green and red stand for the holes and electrons, respectively.61 
Another example is the model of poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene)s in neutral and various oxidation states, which was made by Sun et al.63 From Fig. 35, the charge distribution on the ground state and the orientation of charge transfer on excitation are completely opposite to each other by considering the results of the +2e and +4e ProDOT dodecamer, and charge transfer on excitation can compensate for charge localization at the ground state, when combined with the charge distribution and the orientation of charge transfer together.62 This can also be seen in the atomic site representation from the plots of |Q|2 and |P|2 shown in Fig. 36. Note that the real space transition densities for the first excited state of the neutral and charged species show significantly different characteristic features (see Fig. 37).63 The transition density for the lowest excited state of the neutral ProDOT dodecamer alternates in sign on the conjugated chain, while that of the +2e ProDOT dodecamer is divided into two regions with a constant sign and a node in the central ring. There are two nodes in the central ring for the +4e ProDOT dodecamer, and the transition density is similar to that of the +2e ProDOT dodecamer for the +6e ProDOT dodecamer.63

4. Conclusions and perspectives
We have already reviewed photon induced charge transfer by one and two phonon absorption in organic solar cells in detail, including the theoretical methods of PICT and two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization methods in one-photon, two-photon and charged systems. However, there are still many challenges ahead of us that should be overcome in order to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of organic solar cells, because the main factor that impedes the development of organic solar cells is still their low photoelectric conversion efficiency. Therefore, in the future, it will be necessary for us to do more experimental and theoretical research so as to achieve the full potential of enhancing PICT in various ways. For example, designing more rational FRET systems to make full use of their advantages for promoting PICT and searching for new effective means to promote the process of PICT. More convenient theoretical calculation methods should also be used, since a perfect theoretical calculation is half of the battle. What's more, more intuitive and precise visualization methods should be applied to the presentation and analysis of experimental image results, which would be of benefit to understand the experimental phenomena intuitively.
