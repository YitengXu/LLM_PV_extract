    , Accepted 25th March 2013First published on 26th March 2013AbstractTwo new heteroleptic Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes MH06 and MH11 were designed, synthesized and characterized for DSSCs. While the ancillary ligand of MH06 was molecularly engineered with a strong electron donating group coupled with an extended π-conjugated system, the ancillary ligand of MH11 contained a longer π-conjugated system only. Molecular modeling, photophysical, and photovoltaic properties were compared under the same experimental conditions against the benchmark N719. In an effort to understand the structure–property relationship, their photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties including Jsc, Voc, ground and excited state oxidation potentials, UV-Vis absorption, and molar extinction coefficients were studied. The UV-Vis results showed intense MLCT absorption peaks of MH06 and MH11 in the visible region with a red shift of 12 and 18 nm, respectively, with significantly higher molar extinction coefficients compared to N719. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) substituted MH11-TBA demonstrated the most efficient IPCE of over 90% in the plateau region covering the entire visible spectrum and extending into the near IR region (ca. 890 nm), which showed a solar-to-power conversion efficiency (η) of 10.06%, significantly higher than that of the benchmark N719 dye (9.32%). The superior performance in terms of the IPCE and Jsc of MH11 can be attributed to the bulky and highly hydrophobic nature of the pyrene-based ancillary ligand, which behaves as a shielding barrier for hole-transport recombination between TiO2 and the electrolyte. In addition, the IMPS results showed that the contribution of dyes to the conduction band shift of the TiO2 level is almost similar, regardless of different substitutions on the bipy-moiety. This implies that the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) increases with reduced charge recombination in the presence of a thick layer of tetrabutyl ammonium ions (TBA) of the dye anchored on the surface of TiO2.
1. Introduction
Fossil fuel resources are limited and will significantly be diminished within the next fifty years. Therefore, sustainable and renewable energy sources are vital to fulfill the increasing global energy demand. Solar energy is abundant and ideal for remote and mobile applications. During the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention as a promising alternative source of renewable energy.1–4
In 1976, a new approach to photovoltaic energy conversion by dye-sensitization was reported by Tsubomura. He demonstrated a solar-to-power conversion efficiency (η%) of 1.5% using Rose Bengal as a dye-sensitizer and zinc oxide (ZnO) as a semiconductor.5 Nearly two decades later, in 1991, O'Regan and Grätzel achieved a remarkable efficiency of 7.9% using a Ru(II) bipyridyl complex (N3) as a sensitizer and TiO2 as a semiconductor.6 To date the maximum efficiency achieved for DSSCs is 12.3% by co-sensitization of an organic (Y123) and a Zn–porphyrin complex (YD2-o-C8), using a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl) based redox electrolyte,7 which is about half of silicon-cell efficiency with module efficiencies ranging from 15% to 20%8 and comparable to thin-film technologies, which have achieved module efficiencies of 10–12.5%.7 The best performance of DSSCs on a modular scale both in terms of overall conversion efficiency and stability was achieved using Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes9–11 owing to their strong metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) properties12–14 in the visible region between 400 nm to 600 nm,15–17 thermodynamically favorable ground and excited state oxidation potentials, long excited state lifetime,18–21 and photostability. Among the Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, Ru(II) [cis-dithocyanato-bis-2,2′-bispyridyl-4,4-dicarborylate (N719, 11.20% η) has become the paradigm of a heterogeneous charge transfer (MLCT) sensitizer and has been extensively used in DSSCs technology. However, N719 is hydrophilic, owing to the presence of four COOHs and the absence of bulky ancillary ligands, which renders inferior hydrolytic stability, has a very low molar extinction coefficient and an inferior absorption in the NIR region of the solar spectrum. Preferably, a promising sensitizer for a single junction photovoltaic cell should be panchromatic and absorb energetic photons across a wide range of the solar spectrum, especially from 400 nm to 920 nm to effectively convert solar energy to electricity.
With the aforementioned in mind, we molecularly designed and synthesized two Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes MH06 and MH11 containing two different ancillary ligands with extended π-conjugation. MH06 contains a strong electron donor coupled with an extended π-conjugated system (methoxynaphthalene) while MH11 comprises an ancillary ligand of a longer π-conjugation (pyrene) with no electron donors. The structure–property relationship of these complexes was studied in terms of photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties and compared to that of the benchmark N719, under the same experimental conditions. The aim of introducing strong electron donating groups and extending the length of π-conjugation was to produce amphiphilic properties and accomplish better light harvesting across the visible region extending into the near-IR region, using a monolayer of dye-sensitizer molecules. The enhanced light harvesting was achieved while maintaining the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) of the dye thermodynamically favorable for electron injection into the CB edge of the TiO2 and the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) of the dye more negative (−) than that of the electrolyte to regenerate the neutral dye.22–27Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the thermodynamically favorable interfacial electron transfer processes in dye-sensitized solar cells.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes
The synthesis of all ligands is provided in the ESI.† The solvents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America, and used as received. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Fisher Scientific.


cis-(4,4′-Dicarboxy-2,ipyridine)(-bis-[2-(4-methoxy-naphthalen-1-yl)-vinyl]-2,2′]bipyridine)(dithiocyanate)ruthenium(II) (MH06). 
The synthesis of MH06 was carried out in a one-pot three-step reaction. The reactions were carried out in a 250 ml reaction flask equipped with a condenser and magnetic stirrer bar under argon. The flask was charged with anhydrous DMF (100 mL), dichloro-(p-cymene)-ruthenium(II) dimer (0.30 g, 4.899 × 10−4 mol) and 4,4′-bis-[2-(4-methoxy-naphthalen-1-yl)-vinyl]-[2,2′]bipyridiyl (0.5100 g, 9.797 × 10−4 mol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 4 h. Then, 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid was added (0.239 g, 9.797 × 10−4 mol) and the temperature was increased to 130 °C and allowed to run for 6 hours. After 6 hours, excess of NH4NCS (0.5 g) was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to run for another 4 h at 130 °C. The last two steps of the reaction were monitored for completion by taking aliquots from the reaction mixture every 60 minutes and measuring its absorption spectrum until there was no increase in the absorbance of the MLCT peaks with respect to the π–π* peak. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and DMF was removed using a rotary evaporator. Water was added to the flask, and the insoluble solid was vacuum filtered and washed with de-ionized water and ether. The product was dried overnight to give the crude product in 97% yield with respect to the starting material. The purification was carried out on a column using Sephadex LH-20 as the stationary phase and methanol as the mobile phase. 1H-NMR, MH06 (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, 40 °C): δ/ppm 4.02 (s, 6H, –OCH3), 7.07 (d, 2H, J = 8.05 Hz and 7.89 Hz (d, 2H, J = 18.00 Hz, CHCH) 7.1–7.85 (m, 10H, ArH) 7.92 (s, 2H.

MH11 was prepared using the same procedure in 94% crude yield. The purification was performed in a column using Sephadex LH-20 as the stationary phase and methanol as the mobile phase. 1H-NMR, MH11 (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, 40 °C): δ/ppm 7.51 (d, 2H, J = 6.3 Hz, and 7.83 Hz (d, 2H J = 15.95 Hz, CHCH), 7.85–8.50 (m, 16H, ArH), 8.54 (d, 2H, J = 8.30 Hz, ArH), 8.50 (s, 2H, ArH), 8.70–9.2 (m, 6H, ArH), 9.30 (s, 2H, ArH), 9.52 (d, 2H, J = 6.1 Hz, ArH), 13.12 (s, 2H, vs. weak, –COOH). ESI-MS: mass 910.0453, [M − 2H + TBA]−1, theo. m/z = 1310.3974, found m/z = 1310.4038, error = −4.884 ppm. FT-IR (ATR): 2101 cm−1 (–NCS stretch, N-bonded isomer, very strong); 1718 cm−1 (CO stretch of –COOH).

2.2. UV-visible and emission properties

Fig. 3 illustrates a comparison between the UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of MH06 and MH11 compared to N719, measured in DMF at a concentration of 2 × 10−5 M, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Both MH06 and MH11 showed intense MLCT absorption peaks in the visible region at 541 nm (21450 M−1 cm−1) and 547 nm (27000 M−1 cm−1), with a red shift of 12 and 18 nm as compared to N719 of 530 nm (14200 M−1 cm−1), respectively. Because MH06 and MH11 comprise more extended π-conjugation and strong electron donating ancillary ligands, the metal based HOMO (t2g) was destabilized, which furnished a better light harvesting as the result of a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap. In addition, the emission spectra demonstrated that the incorporation of strong electron–donor ligands furnished significantly stronger emission and more red shifted spectra than that of N719. Table 1 shows a summary of the absorption and emission properties of complexes MH06 and MH11 compared to N719.

Absorption spectra of MH06 and MH11 measured in DMF and after adsorption on transparent TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption spectra profiles of both complexes in carboxylic acid form (in DMF) and carboxylate form (anchored-TiO2) are almost similar and showed two broad absorption bands in the visible region, which originated from the MLCTs. The higher energy MLCT band is due to the charge-transfer transition from Ru → substituted bipyridyl-ligand and the lower energy MLCT band is due to a charge transition from Ru → 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid.29 However, the deprotonation of carboxylic acid while anchoring to TiO2 leads to a blue shift of the lower-energy MLCT band due to an increase in the energy of the LUMO of the 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic ligand as a consequence of destabilization of the LUMO. These findings are in agreement with the previously reported results for similar heteroleptic complexes.30 Also, it can be clearly seen that MH11 anchored to TiO2 showed significantly better light harvesting properties than MH06, which can be attributed to the longer π-conjugation of MH11.

2.3. Ground and excited state oxidation potential properties
The ionization potential (IP) of MH06, MH11 and N719 anchored to TiO2 film was measured using a photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-3E), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) energy values relative to the position of the TiO2 conduction band are very important and determine the electronic coupling efficiency between the dye and the semiconductor. For a given species, the lowest singlet-to-singlet vertical electronic excitation (E0–0) is defined as the difference between the excited and ground state oxidation potentials. Experimentally, the excited state oxidation potentials (ESOP) of MH06, MH11 and N719 can be estimated from eqn (1). E0–0 = ESOP − GSOP(1)
The experimental ionization potential (IP) values for MH06, MH11 and N719 were −5.51, −5.49 and −5.76 eV. The IP values confirmed that the HOMO of these dyes is thermodynamically favorable for electron replenishment and efficient regeneration of the dye through reaction with the redox couple I3−/I− (−5.20 eV).31 The experimental excited-state oxidation potentials E* (Ru3+/*) of MH06, MH11 and N719 were −3.66, −3.61 and −3.77 eV, respectively, which lay above the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV).32 Hence, efficient electron injection from the excited state of these dyes into the CB edge of TiO2 is favorable, owing to the energetically favorable excited states of the dyes.

Table 2 also shows the calculated lowest singlet-to-singlet vertical electronic transition (E0–0), using B3LYP/DGDZVP, of MH06, MH11, and N719, which are in excellent agreement with experimental results. Both the experimental and calculated transitions (E0–0) demonstrated that MH11 exhibited more energetically favorable ESOP and are better light harvesting sensitizers than N719, owing to its smaller E0–0.
Calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces of MH06 and MH11 (Fig. 5) showed that the HOMO electron density of MH11 was considerably longer than that of MH06 as it extended all the way through the conjugated system of the ancillary ligand, which explains the superior light harvesting of MH11. The LUMO hole distribution is mainly located on the bipyridyl carrying the carboxylic groups in both compounds.

2.4. Photovoltaic device characterization
The photovoltaic performance of complexes MH06, MH11 and N719 on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using an electrolyte with a composition of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.3/0.5 M 4-ter-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile. Fig. 6 shows the incident-photon-to-current efficiency conversion (IPCE) spectra for the cells fabricated with complexes MH06, MH11 and N719, where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values are plotted as a function of wavelength.

The photocurrent action spectra of a solar device containing complex MH11 demonstrated the most efficient sensitization over a broad wavelength range including the entire visible spectrum and extended into the near IR region (ca. 890 nm), with an impressive quantum efficiency of over 90% in the plateau region. It was also demonstrated that MH11 exhibited more superior quantum efficiency in the visible as well as NIR regions than N719. Moreover, MH11-TBA showed better Jsc and hence IPCE due to the increase in ESOP, which led to more negative free energy between the ESOP and CB edge of TiO2 and hence more efficient electron injection. While MH11-TBA achieved the maximum IPCE of 90% in the plateau region, MH06 furnished a low IPCE of 70% in the same region.
The photovoltaic characteristics of MH06, MH11, MH11-TBA and N719 were studied under simulated one sun illumination under standard conditions (AM 1.5, 1.00 W m−2).
The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factors (ff) and overall cell efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 3.

The solar cell sensitized with MH11 showed a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 19.7 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.671 V, and a fill factor of 0.664, resulting in an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 8.78% with the electrolyte containing 0.5 M TBP. It is likely that TBP is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface to form a more protective layer between the electrolyte and the dye that also suppresses the recombination between the injected electron and the electrolyte at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte junction. As a result, Voc, Jsc and solar-to-power conversion efficiency of the device increased significantly. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) substituted complex MH11-TBA furnished a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.54 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, and a fill factor of 0.68, resulting in an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 10.06%. This impressive increase in performance is because of the deprotonation of one carboxylic acid. The fully protonated MH11 transfers most of its protons to the TiO2 surface upon binding to Ti, thus decreasing Jsc due to the positive shift of the TiO2-CB level. When compared to MH11-TBA under the same experimental device conditions, N719 exhibited a Jsc of 16.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.749 V, and a fill factor of 0.739, resulting in an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 9.32%. Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves obtained for solar cells fabricated using MH06, MH11, MH11-TBA and N719 at standard AM 1.5 irradiation.

2.5. CEM and IMVS characterization
Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) is a powerful tool to investigate the band edge level of TiO2 and charge recombination kinetics in DSSCs. In a previous study, charge recombinations between the N3 dye and the electrolyte were investigated and an analytical expression relating the Voc to the interfacial recombination kinetics was derived.33 In the present study, a theoretical IMVS model that considers a charge trapping–detrapping mechanism during the charge diffusion in the semiconductor and charge transfer from the CB-semiconductor to redox species at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface was used. This model is invaluable in elucidating the change in the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) because of the surface modification of the semiconductor oxide. IMVS measurements of MH06, MH11, MH11-TBA and N719 showed a linear increase in Voc as a function of electron density for all dyes, illustrated in Fig. 8. In addition, the result indicated that dyes contribution to the band edge shift is almost similar as the plots for all dyes overlapped with each other, regardless of different substitutions on the bpy-moiety. This implies that the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) is more likely dependent on charge recombination reactions rather than molecular structures of the dyes. Hence, the Voc for all DSSCs containing MH06, MH11, MH11-TBA should be attributed to the extent of charge recombination which is ultimately related to the electron lifetime (τ) in TiO2. Fig. 9 shows the electron lifetime (τ) as a function of Voc. It can be clearly seen that TBA substituted complexes of N719 and MH11-TBA showed impressive longer electron lifetime than MH11 and MH06. This can be attributed to the formation of a compact thicker layer of TBA on the TiO2 surface, which reduces the concentration of I3− ions in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface, which explains the electrons longer lifetime and significant suppression of the charge recombination reactions at the electrolyte (I3− ions)/TiO2 interface. Furthermore, from Fig. 9, it can be inferred that the electron lifetime of MH11 in CB-TiO2 is longer than that of MH06. This confirms that the use of bulky pyrene as an antenna in MH11 acted as a shielding barrier between the redox and TiO2. Fig. 10 shows a schematic diagram of MH11 anchored onto a slab of the TiO2 (101) surface demonstrating the plausible mechanism of the reduction in charge recombinations between TiO2 and the electrolyte for dye MH11 owing to the bulky pyrene antenna, which resulted in a significant increase in the Jsc of MH11.

2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool for characterizing the interfacial charge transfer process at TiO2/electrolyte and Pt/electrolyte interfaces in DSSCs. The EIS Nyquist and Bode plots for the DSSCs based on MH06, MH11, MH11-TBA and N719 are shown in Fig. 11 and 12. The EIS Nyquist plots exhibited three characteristic peaks, the response in the intermediate frequency indicating that the electron recombination resistance increased in the order of N719 > MH11-TBA > MH11 > MH6. This is due to the formation of a thick layer of TBA on the TiO2, which reduces charge recombinations.

 Fig. 12  EIS Bode plots for DSSCs sensitized with MH11, MH11-TBA, MH06 and N719. 
In Fig. 12, the frequency response plot is in the range of 1–100 Hz, which is indicative of the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2 and is related to the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2. The electron lifetime depends on the density of charge traps, which is ultimately related to Voc. The middle-frequency peaks of the DSSCs based on N719 and MH11-TBA shifted to lower frequency, owing to the presence of a thick layer of TBA, relative to that of MH11 and MH06, indicating a shorter recombination lifetime for the latter case. This trend is in agreement with the τ vs. Voc results, implying that the formation of a thicker compact layer using TBA increases the lifetime of electrons in CB-TiO2, hence reducing the rate of charge recombination with the triiodide ions I3−.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, the incorporation of strong electron donating groups and extension of the length of π-conjugation in the bipyridyl moiety furnished highly efficient light harvesting properties and bathochromic shift in the UV-Vis spectrum compared to the benchmark N719 dye. The photovoltaic performance of MH06, MH11 and MH11-TBA showed that MH11-TBA exhibited a significantly higher efficiency η(%) of 10.06 than N719 (9.32) and MH06 (6.70). Comparison of the photovoltaic performance of MH06 and MH11 showed that the structure of the ancillary ligand can have a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance of the sensitizer, as longer extended π-conjugation based on pyrene was shown to be significantly more effective than an electron donor with less π-conjugated ancillary ligand of methoxynaphthalene. In addition, the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy results showed that the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) is more dependent on the charge recombination process, where the charge recombinations were reduced owing to the thick layer of TBA, which resulted in an increase in the lifetime of electrons in CB-TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results showed that incorporation of a TBA unit into the molecular structure of dyes significantly suppressed the recombination process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
