    , Accepted 17th September 2015First published on 17th September 2015AbstractPorous CuO/Cu2O composite hollow octahedrons were synthesized simply by annealing Cu-based metal–organic framework templates. When evaluated as anode materials for sodium ion batteries, they exhibit a high maximum reversible capacity of 415 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1 with excellent cycling stability and good rate capability.
Over the past several decades, the increasing consumption of fossil fuel resources has caused severe energy crisis and environmental problems. Renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, have received intensive attention as the most promising substitutes, but their irregular energy output requires energy storage systems.1 Rechargeable batteries, owing to their flexibility and high energy conversion efficiency, have been considered as the promising devices for successful development of energy storage and conversion systems.2–4 Currently, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are the leading candidates for such utilization. However, mass production of huge LIBs would rapidly deplete the limited and unevenly distributed Li resources in earth's crust.
Recently, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused enormous attention as potential alternatives to LIBs for large-scale energy storage systems because of the relatively low cost, the abundance of sodium resources and a similar chemistry between sodium and lithium.3,5,6 Unfortunately, sodium ions have larger radius compared with lithium ions. Therefore, typical graphite materials, which have been used as commercial anodes for LIBs, are not suitable candidates for SIBs because their interlayer distance is too small to accommodate sodium ions.7 Therefore, exploring advanced anode materials for SIBs to achieve superior electrochemical performance is urgently desirable but remains a great challenge. To date, many attempts have been made to find suitable anode materials for SIBs, including various carbonaceous materials,8 metal nitrides,9 metal oxides,10 phosphors,11 and alloys.12 Among various anode materials, transition metal oxides have been proven to be possible candidates because of their high theoretical capacities and widespread availability. In particular, Cu-based oxides, such as CuO and Cu2O, have attracted much attention due to their abundance, affordable price, chemical stability, and nontoxic nature.9,13 However, similar to the other metal oxides, the practical application of Cu-based oxides for SIBs is still hindered by large volume change during cycling due to the conversion reaction mechanism, which leads to dramatic capacity fading and poor rate performance. Huang et al. demonstrated that CuO could be employed as an anode material for SIBs with a high capacity in the initial few cycles, but the cycling stability and rate performance were still unsatisfied and needed to be improved.14 Klein et al. reported that Cu2O used for SIBs exhibited a high capacity of ∼600 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C but it decreased quickly to 300 mA h g−1 at the fifth cycle.6
To alleviate the volume change during cycling, an effective method is to fabricate hollow or porous structure materials, which can accommodate the volume change and facilitate the contact between active materials and electrolyte due to their interior space. To date, CuO or Cu2O with porous or hollow structures, such as porous nanorods, mesoporous nanoparticles, and hollow nanospheres, have been fabricated using various methods.15–18 Despite continuous efforts that have been made, the rational design and synthesis of anisotropic hollow structures with complex hierarchical architectures remain a big challenge. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of porous materials consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic molecules, have attracted much attention due to their diverse structural topologies, tunable functionalities and versatile applications in gas storage and separation,19,20 catalysis,21 biomedicine,22 sensing,23 and energy storage and conversion.24–26 Recently, MOFs have been proved to be ideal precursors or templates for the synthesis of porous hierarchical metal oxides27 and carbon nanostructures28–30via thermal decomposition under different atmospheres or chemical etching16 due to their unique structure, high specific surface area, porosity and nanosized cavities. Studies have shown that porous metal oxides such as Fe2O3,31,32 CuO18 and Co3O433 constructed from MOF precursors exhibited excellent lithium storage properties. Nevertheless, as excellent members of metal oxides, hollow CuO/Cu2O nanostructures derived from MOFs have been seldom reported for SIB applications by now.
Herein, we report a simple and convenient method to synthesize porous structured CuO/Cu2O composite hollow octahedrons (CHOs) using Cu–MOFs ([Cu3(btc)2]n, btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) as the template. The experimental details can be found in the ESI.† The Cu–MOFs have an octahedral structure with a size of several micrometers (Fig. S1, ESI†) and their X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†) is in agreement with that of [Cu3(btc)2]n.34,35 The CHO samples obtained from pyrolysis of the MOFs at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C were denoted as CHO-1, CHO-2 and CHO-3, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CHO-1, CHO-2 and CHO-3. It can be seen that the peaks in the patterns of CHO-1, CHO-2 and CHO-3 are ascribed to CuO (JCPDS card no. 65-2309) and Cu2O (JCPDS card no. 05-0667), indicating the existence of the CuO/Cu2O composite in CHOs. Further measurement using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†) shows that the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 can be assigned to Cu2+ (934.1 eV) and Cu+ (932.4 eV), and the ratios of Cu2+ to Cu+ are about 4.43, 5.41 and 11.32 for CHO-1, CHO-2 and CHO-3, respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of CHO samples. 
As shown in field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of CHO-1 (Fig. 2a and b), CHO-1 exhibits a typical porous octahedron structure that consists of clustered nanoparticles with a size of tens of nanometers. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2c) shows the hollow structure inside CHO-1. It can be observed from Fig. 2d that the measured lattice fringe distances are 0.27 nm and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (002) and (111) lattice planes of CuO and Cu2O, respectively. The bright spots in the selected area electron diffraction pattern of CHO-1 (Fig. S5, ESI†) indicate good crystallinity of the CHO-1 nanostructure. When the calcination temperature is increased to 350 °C (CHO-2), the octahedron porous structure collapses to form a cluster structure (Fig. S6a, ESI†). At a higher temperature of 400 °C, the octahedral structure entirely disappears and non-regular agglomerates are obtained (Fig. S6b, ESI†). The porous structure of CHOs was further characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†). It is found that the CHO samples display a broad pore-size distribution (inset in Fig. S7, ESI†) and a moderate specific surface area, which are similar to the previous report.36 The specific surface areas, pore volumes and mean pore diameters of the samples are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). CHO-1 exhibits the largest surface area and pore volume, which can facilitate the sodium ion insertion and rapid diffusion during the electrochemical reactions. The surface areas and pore volumes of CHO-2 and CHO-3 are observed to decrease, which should be ascribed to more pores closed at higher calcination temperature.

The electrochemical properties of porous CHO electrodes for SIBs were investigated by using the standard half-cell configuration. Fig. 3a shows the first three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of CHO-1 in the range of 0.005–3 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. It is found that there is a broad and irreversible cathodic peak located at 0.84 V in the first discharge cycle, which corresponds to the decomposition of the organic electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.17,37 In the subsequent cycles, the cathodic peaks at 1.83, 0.54, and 0.12 V during the discharging process involve three reversible electrochemical reactions: the formation of Cu(II)1−xCu(I)xO1−x/2, and further reduction of Cu2O into Cu and Na2O, respectively.38 Furthermore, in the charging processes, the anodic peaks at 1.3 and 2.18 V correspond to the reaction 2Cu + Na2O → Cu2O + 2Na and the oxidation of Cu2O to CuO, respectively.39 Notably, after the first cycle, CV curves exhibit good repeatability, indicating high reversibility of the subsequent reactions.17 The galvanostatic charge/discharge test was carried out to investigate the electrochemical performances of CHO electrodes. Fig. S8a–c (ESI†) show the charge/discharge profiles at 1st, 2nd, and 10th cycles in the voltage range of 0.005–3 V and at a current density of 50 mA g−1 for CHO-1, CHO-2, and CHO-3, respectively. A large irreversible capacity is observed in the first cycle for all electrodes, which is typical for such conversion type anodes.6 The irreversible capacity loss is consistent with CV measurements, in which the decrease of area during cycling is noticed due to decomposition of the electrolyte and subsequent formation of SEI.17,37 In the subsequent cycles, the charge/discharge curves of all electrodes overlap well, indicating high reversibility of the materials. However, CHO-2 and CHO-3 show an unsatisfied sodium storage capacity due to the collapse of the hollow nanostructure and their relative low specific surface area. The cycling performance together with the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of CHO electrodes is shown in Fig. 3b at a current density of 50 mA g−1. The initial CE of ∼45% is relatively low, which may be attributed to the formation of a SEI layer on the CHO surface. Remarkably, after several cycles, the CHO electrodes exhibit excellent cyclic stability and their CE remains more than 98%. The specific charge/discharge capacity of CHO-1 maintains well with the increased cycles and a reversible capacity of 415 mA h g−1 can be obtained after 50 cycles. However, CHO-2 and CHO-3 samples display reversible capacities of only 248 and 185 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively, much lower than that of CHO-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the kinetics of CHO electrodes.40 Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the EIS curves of the samples measured at different temperatures. The Nyquist plots can be fitted and interpreted well based on the equivalent electric circuit.40,41 The large semicircle is related to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE2). Another indistinct small high-frequency semicircle stemming from Rf and CPE1 is ascribed to the SEI layer. Table S2 (ESI†) lists the fitted values of Rct. The Rct is found to decrease when the temperature increases, indicating that better electrochemical kinetics is obtained at a higher temperature. It can be seen that CHO-1 exhibits a smallest Rct among all samples measured at the same temperatures, showing that electrochemical reaction occurs easily in CHO-1. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for the intercalation of sodium can be calculated by the following equations:42,43i0 = RT/nFRcti0 = Aexp(Ea/RT)where i0 is the exchange current, A is the temperature-independent coefficient, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of transferred electrons and F is the Faraday constant. Fig. S9d (ESI†) shows the corresponding Arrhenius plots of −ln(T/Rct) versus 1000/T. Ea is equal to the slope of the fitting straight line multiplied by R. The calculated values of Ea are 35.73, 50.46 and 66.75 kJ mol−1 for CHO-1, CHO-2 and CHO-3 samples, respectively. The lowest Ea value of CHO-1 indicates the best sodium intercalation ability in CHO-1, which further confirms the superior capacity of CHO-1 for sodium ion storage. The reason should be ascribed to the following: (i) the more porous structure of CHO-1 is beneficial to the increase of contact between the electrode and electrolyte, which facilitates the intercalation of Na ions into the active materials and accelerates their diffusion velocity. (ii) The hollow structure can efficiently enhance structural integrity with voids for buffering stresses caused by the volume change during cycling. (iii) The synergistic effect between CuO and Cu2O contributes to the high capacity.44–46

Fig. 3c shows the rate performance of the CHO-1 electrode at different current densities from 50 to 2500 mA g−1. The corresponding charge/discharge curves of the CHO-1 electrode are displayed in Fig. 3d. It is clearly seen that CHO-1 exhibits the specific capacities of 440, 395, 349.3, 273.5, 217.2 and 153.8 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2500 mA g−1, respectively. The specific capacity recovers to ∼410 mA h g−1 when the current density returns back to 50 mA g−1, indicating that the unique porous hollow structure of CHO-1 can preserve the integrity of the electrode material. To evaluate the long cycling performance, the CHO-1 electrode was measured for more than 1000 cycles at high current densities. Fig. 3e displays the cyclability of CHO-1 after the tests at 50 mA g−1 for the first 30 cycles, at 1 A g−1 for the subsequent 400 cycles and at 2 A g−1 for the final 600 cycles. Clearly, the porous CHO-1 shows an excellent performance with a capacity of ∼212 mA h g−1 when cycled at 1 A g−1 after 400 cycles. The capacity can remain ∼165 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. During the cycling, the CE of ∼99% is achieved after the first several cycles, further demonstrating the superior stability for sodium storage capability of the porous CHO electrode.25
In summary, CHO samples were successfully synthesized via thermal decomposition of Cu–MOFs and used as anode materials for SIBs for the first time. They exhibit excellent sodium storage capacity of 415 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles and superior cyclability at higher current density as well as good rate capability, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect between CuO and Cu2O and excellent stability of their porous hollow structure. CHOs should be promising anode materials for SIBs.
