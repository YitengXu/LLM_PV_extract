    , Accepted 21st June 2016First published on 21st June 2016AbstractElectron transporting materials based on ternary metal oxides (TMOs) are the best electron transport layers (ETLs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the present investigation, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) grafted highly porous zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) (ZSO) nanofiber scaffolds have been synthesized by a single step electrospinning technique and successfully used as ETLs for mixed halide PSCs whose perovskite material is composed of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (MA: methyl ammonium and FA: formamidinium). The fabricated optimized perovskite solar cells having FTO/Bl-ZSO/rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA/Au devices exhibited a 13.41% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.036 V, a current density (JSC) of 19.62 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66 under AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) which is higher than that of bare Zn2SnO4 nanofiber (η = 7.38%) based PSCs. The optimized conditions were further used for formamidinium lead halide (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x (x = 0.15) perovskite and our optimized results show η = 17.89% PCE (JSC = 22.50 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.046 V, FF = 0.76) for the FTO/Bl-ZSO/rGO–ZSO0.7–(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/PTAA/Au device configuration. The role of rGO grafting and electron transfer mechanisms are investigated with complementary characterization, including photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements. The TRPL results revealed that the grafting of rGO in ZSO scaffolds reduces the slow decay lifetime which facilitates efficient electron injection from the perovskite conduction band (CB) to the rGO Fermi level to the CB of ZSO compared to the bare ZSO ETL. Furthermore, the stability of these devices based on various configurations has been discussed. This improvement is achieved due to the high conductivity of rGO and grafting with high porosity Zn2SnO4 nanofibers which make them promising new ETLs for the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
The development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on different electron transporting layers (ETLs) and a variety of organo-metal halides has demonstrated a breakthrough power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 So far, various aspects have been implemented in ETLs and perovskites in order to push power conversion efficiency up to 22.1%.5 ETLs, perovskite absorbing layers (MAPbX or FAPbX, where X = I, Br, Cl), hole transporting layers (HTLs) and counter electrodes are essential requirements for the fabrication of a complete PSC device. So far, Bl-TiO2,3 Bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2,4 Y:TiO2,5 Mg–TiO2,6 Sn:TiO2,7 ZrO2,8 SrTiO3,9 ZnO nanorods,10 TiO2 nanorods,11 Al2O3,12 TiO2 nanotubes,13 and graphene/TiO2 (ref. 14) have been used as ETLs for PSCs. Seok et al. used Zn2SnO4 (ZSO) nanoparticles and demonstrated 7.02% (ref. 15) and 14.85% (ref. 16) PCEs for MAPbI3 based PSCs. We have also successfully synthesized ZSO nanofiber scaffolds by using an electrospinning technique and demonstrated 7.38% PCE for the first time. The main aim of the implementation of ternary metal oxides (TMOs) in PSCs is because of the following reasons. ZSO ternary metal oxide is an n-type semiconducting material having very similar properties to anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV) with a higher band gap of 3.7 eV. This n-type semiconductor TMO has a small electron effective mass of 0.23me and a high-electron Hall mobility of 10–30 cm2 V−1 s−1.17–21 The charge injection and electron diffusion efficiency of this material is much higher than that of the TiO2-based photoanodes. On the other hand, the wide band gap (3.7 eV) reduces photobleaching and presents a lower electron-triiodide recombination rate.22 Moreover, ZSO shows a high electron mobility of 10–30 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 23) with excellent chemical stability for acid/base and organic solvents.
On the other hand, the incorporation of graphene or rGO based nanocomposites has attracted great interest in optoelectronic applications. The graphene based nanocomposites facilitate high conductivity and excellent interface electric contact which makes them promising ETLs for PSCs.24–26 The implementation of rGO in ZSO will help improve the optoelectronic properties. Owing to its exceptional optical, physical and electrical properties as well as its low production cost graphene has risen as a promising candidate for optoelectronic properties. So far, rGO or graphene has been used in various layers of PSCs such as rGO in mp-TiO2 or replacement of HTMs.26 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time rGO has been used in the ZSO ETL as a recombination inhibitor. In the present investigation, we developed a new synthesis process for reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by Hummer's method followed by in situ reduction via annealing processes during ZSO synthesis. The present synthesis process of rGO is free from toxic hydrazine treatment.27 The detailed synthetic procedure has been discussed in the Electronic supporting information S1 Experimental section.† The present synthesis process is much easier than the process reported so far and fabricated PSCs based on the rGO–ZSO ETL configuration show excellent power conversion efficiency to date. The grafting of rGO in ZSO scaffolds improves electronic properties, which translate into a higher photocurrent density, open circuit voltage and fill factor. It is also found that the grafting of rGO in ZSO scaffolds improves the electronic properties and retards electron–hole recombination resulting in an improvement in the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) as confirmed by time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. Hence, the synthesis of rGO–ZSO nanocomposites for use as ETLs is a promising approach toward efficient PSCs.
Here, we report PSCs comprising electrospun ZSO, a rGO–ZSO nanofiber composite as an ETL with a MAPbI3, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite absorbing layer, spiro-MeOTAD as a hole conducting layer and Au as the electrode. The present synthesis process of rGO is free from a toxic hydrazine treatment for the reduction of GO and facilitates the synthesis of rGO–ZSO nanocomposites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an electrospun rGO–ZSO nanofiber scaffold ETL has been used in PSCs with >17% efficiency.1 The optimized device exhibits 17.89% efficiency which is much higher than that of our reference cell (7.38%).
2. Results and discussion
Initially, we prepared GO by using Hummer's method28 as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A represents the schematic process involved in the preparation of GO from graphite powder. More details are mentioned in the Electronic supporting information S1 Experimental section.† The prepared vacuum dried GO flakes were further used for the preparation of GO solution. In this process, we have dispersed GO in DMF solution and the desired amount was mixed with a Zn2SnO4 + PVP + DMF precursor solvent for electrospinning (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 1B(a) shows the digital photograph of the prepared GO cake after the vacuum drying process. This cake is highly brittle and spongy in nature. Fig. 1B(b) shows the photograph of the GO powder after grinding the GO cake. This ground GO powder was used for FESEM, XRD and Raman analyses. Fig. 1B(c and d) show FESEM images of GO flakes which revealed aggregated reduced graphene oxide platelets. Fig. 1B(e) shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared GO with a characteristic (001) peak at 2θ = 10.5°, having an interlayer distance of ∼8.35 Å. This relatively large size compared to the interlayer spacing (7.76 Å) in the parent GO indicates a single-layer feature with a large dimension (several hundred nanometers to tens of micrometers); also several tiny pieces of GO nanosheets have been observed.
The oxygen functional groups attached to both sides of the graphite flakes create atomic defects (sp3 bonding) in the graphite structure and tend to exfoliate to a few layers or individual layers of GO in an aqueous medium. For comparison, rGO was obtained by a thermal annealing process. The prepared GO was annealed at 550 °C for 30 min in order to obtain rGO. Fig. 1C shows TEM images of GO after the thermal annealing process i.e. rGO. After high temperature annealing at 550 °C, the GO is transformed into rGO with d002 = 4.85 Å due to reduction of graphene oxide. This reduction of graphene oxide was further analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements.

Fig. 2A shows the schematic representation of the electrospinning technique for the synthesis of ZSO and rGO–ZSO samples. Here, we have used 17 kV applied potential during electrospinning. The prepared ZSO/PVP and GO–ZSO/PVP composites were further annealed at 700 °C. Fig. 2B shows the XRD patterns of GO, rGO, ZSO and nanocomposites of rGO with ZSO nanofibers. It is well known that GO shows a strong peak at 10.5° (001). From the XRD patterns of GO and rGO, it is clear that the sharp peak 2θ = 10.5° (001) has vanished and a new peak appears at 2θ = 24.5° (002) due to the reduction of GO and the restoration of C–C (sp2) bonding. All ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples exhibited a crystalline nature with a perfect phase of porous Zn2SnO4 nanofibers. Both rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples show very similar XRD patterns to the bare ZSO sample.1 The calculated lattice parameters of ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 showed similar ‘d’ values. From this it is clear that the implementation of GO/rGO did not influence the crystal structure of the ZSO porous nanofibers. It is also observed that there is no significant characteristic peaks for rGO. This may be due to low concentration of GO in the precursor solution. Further, bare ZSO (220) and rGO (002) XRD peaks are located at 2θ = ∼29° (sharp peak) and 2θ ∼ 25° (broad peak); it is hard to distinguish both peaks as a result of the broad reflection from the rGO. In order to confirm the grafting of rGO in the ZSO sample, we have recorded micro-Raman spectra of ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 nanofibers (Fig. 2C). The strong Raman shift peaks at 669.1(A1g), 530.2(F2g) and 435.85(Eg) cm−1 correspond to well-known Zn2SnO4 peaks. Two more additional peaks at 1595 cm−1 and 1360 cm−1 have been observed for the rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples. This indicated the sample having rGO content. The presence of all three peaks with high intensity indicates the good crystallinity of the ZSO nanofibers.

Fig. 3A shows FESEM images of the as-spun and annealed GO–ZSO nanofibers with different GO concentrations. The FESEM images of the as-spun GO–ZSO0.7–PVP show a relatively rough surface with an average diameter of 550 nm (Fig. 3A(a–c)). After calcination (Fig. 3A(d–f)), the average diameter of the nanofibers shrank to 330 nm with a relatively rough surface. Fig. 3A(g–i) show FESEM images of the as-spun GO–ZSO1.5–PVP showing a relatively smooth surface with an average diameter of 500 nm (Fig. 3A(a–c)). After calcination (Fig. 3A(j–l)), the average diameter of the nanofibers shrank to 253 nm with a very rough surface. This may be due to a higher concentration of GO in the precursor solution. It is also noted that as the GO concentration increases, the diameter of ZSO nanofibers decreases from 350 nm to 250 nm. On the other hand, during the calcination process of the GO–ZSO–PVP composite at 700 °C, GO transformed to rGO and rGO–ZSO scaffolds were formed.

HRTEM images and SAED patterns were recorded to analyze the crystal structures of rGO–ZSO nanofibrous composites. Fig. 3B(a–c) show TEM analyses of the rGO–ZSO0.7 sample at different magnifications. The TEM images in Fig. 3B(a–b) show that the rGO is grafted in ZSO nanofibrous scaffolds. The SAED pattern revealed the highly crystalline nature of rGO–ZSO composites. Fig. 3B(c) shows the HRTEM image of a rGO–ZSO0.7 nanocomposite at the selected area. The crystalline rGO has been well-dispersed on the surfaces of the ZSO scaffold. The HRTEM image shows the characteristic lattice fringes of rGO sheets in the ZSO scaffold matrix. The different lattice fringes match well with those of rGO and ZSO, respectively.

Fig. 3B(a–e) show TEM analyses of the rGO–ZSO1.5 sample at different magnifications. At a glance, it is clear that the rGO sheets are decorated on the surface of ZSO scaffolds; this may be due to a higher amount of rGO. The further higher magnified TEM image shows that the rGO sheets are highly crystalline in nature with ∼50 nm sheet length Fig. 3C(b and c). For further study, we have recorded HRTEM images of this sample at the selected area. The ZSO nanofibrous scaffold grafted onto rGO sheets clearly indicates the different lattice fringes (denoted by yellow dotted circles). The ZSO scaffold shows 3.12 Å, 2.72 Å and 5.21 Å along the (220), (311) and (111) planes, respectively, which is consistent with the cubic inverse spinel phase crystal structure of Zn2SnO4 (Fig. 3C inset). The grafted rGO is highly crystalline in nature having a lattice spacing d = 4.38 Å as shown in Fig. 3C(e). Continuous bright long lattice fringes reveal the formation of highly crystalline rGO. This d-spacing of rGO is lower than that of pure graphite (∼9 Å) revealing the formation of pure rGO.
The surface chemical composition of synthesized ZSO and GO–ZSO nanofibers using XPS measurements has been performed. As shown in Fig. 4a, the ZSO nanofibers exhibited peaks at 1044.89 and 1020.88 eV for the ZSO sample which could be ascribed to Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2, respectively. The Zn2p region can be decomposed into several contributions corresponding to the different oxidation states of zinc. Each contribution consists of a doublet between the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks. For each doublet, the ratio of the area of the two peaks A(Zn2p1/2)/A(Zn2p3/2) is equal to 0.5 and the binding energy difference, ΔEb = Eb(Zn2p1/2) − Eb(Zn2p3/2) is 22.1 eV, 23.01 eV and 23.11 eV for the ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples, respectively. The binding energy difference for Sn2p peaks is 8.39 eV, 8.30 eV and 8.35 eV for the ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples, respectively.

A peak shift toward higher energy has been observed for the rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples. The rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples exhibit respective peaks at 1021.47 and 1044.57 eV and 1021.58 and 1044.69 eV. The Sn3d3/2 and Sn3d5/2 core level spectra of ZSO nanofibers are at 485.54 and 493.93 eV, which could be ascribed to Sn3d3/2 and Sn3d5/2, respectively. The rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples exhibit respective Sn3d core levels at 494.66 eV and 486.36 and 486.36 eV and 494.71 eV, respectively. Fig. 4c represents the core level O1s spectra of ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 samples. At a glance, it is clear that the bare ZSO sample has more hydroxyl group OH− (531.28 eV) species compared to other rGO–ZSO samples. These results indicate that rGO–ZSO samples have fewer OH− species and also they are free from carboxylic (–COOH) groups. These OH− species vanish due to the annealing process with ZSO materials. More detailed analysis is needed for this anomalous behavior of O1s core level spectra. More detailed analysis is needed for further confirmation. In the present case, our rGO–ZSO based ETL photoelectrodes show a higher PCE. Fig. 4d shows the C1s signal of the prepared ZSO, GO–ZSO0.7 and GO–ZSO1.5 samples. This signal was fitted by three components: CC & C–C (46.8%, 284.6 eV), C–O (43.1%, 286.7 eV) and OC–OH (5.1%, 288.26 eV). The estimated C/O ratio is ∼2.4. These features are consistent with those described in the previous studies.
In the present investigation, we have fabricated perovskite solar cells with and without rGO and the energy level diagram with different layers is shown in Fig. 5a. The particle size of rGO sheets is very small; therefore, we can refer them as graphene quantum dots (GQDs).

(d) Schematic representation of the energy band diagram of ZSO, rGO, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, PTAA, Au and its charge transfer mechanism. Energy levels of FAPbI3 perovskites were adopted from previous reports.35,44,45 (e and f) J–V and IPCE plots of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. The IPCE data were collected under the constant energy DC mode with a delay time of 10 ms under 50 μW cm−2 light intensity. The integrated photocurrents were calculated from the overlap integral of the IPCE spectra. 
Therefore, comparing energy levels reported by Yu et al.,29 Zhu et al.30 and Yan et al.,31 the conduction band (CB) of rGO QDs can be varied between 3.8 eV (ref. 31) and 4.5 eV.29 On the other hand, these GQDs serve as electron reservoirs to trap photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of P25 or photosensitizers, respectively, under UV and visible light illumination.29 Here, Bl-ZSO/ZSO and Bl-ZSO/rGO–ZSO scaffolds act as ETLs for PSCs and spiro-MeOTAD acts as the HTL. Absorbing perovskite materials i.e. MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, x = 0.1) were used. The band gap of the mixed halide perovskite has been calculated using equation Eg(x) = 1.57 + 0.39x + 0.33x2, where Eg is the band gap of the perovskite in eV and x is the amount of Br relative to the amount of I.33–35 The Bl-ZSO/rGO–ZSO/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 on an FTO coated substrate acts as a working electrode. Here, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 nanoparticles act as the absorber layer which were deposited onto rGO–ZSO nanofibrous scaffolds. Fig. 5a shows the schematic energy level diagram of fabricated PSCs based on rGO grafted ZSO scaffolds and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 absorber. When photonic energy illuminates this device, the photogenerated electrons and holes are separated at the interface of the ETL and HTM. The excited electrons travel from the CB of the perovskite to the rGO Fermi level to the CB of ZSO, while holes travelled from the valence band (VB) of the perovskite to the Au contact through HTM. Here, the rGO layer acts as a bridge between the perovskite and ZSO nanofibers to enhance fast charge transfer. The bare ZSO nanofiber ETL and MAPbI3 absorber based PSC device show a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.68 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.986 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.59 leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) η = 7.38%. The graphene grafted rGO–ZSO0.7 sample exhibits JSC = 14.04 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.978 V, FF = 0.59 leading to η = 8.53%. This increment in efficiency is due to the increment in the FF and JSC values of rGO–ZSO0.7 nanofibers. Further, the rGO–ZSO1.5 + MAPbI3 sample shows small decrement in the FF up to 0.54. Fig. 5b shows J–V curves using an MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 absorbing layer. The ZSO + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 PSC exhibits little increment with JSC = 17.04 mA cm−2, FF = 0.56 and η = 9.62% PCE. The rGO–ZSO0.7 + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample exhibits η = 12.85% with VOC = 0.993 V, JSC = 20.38 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.64. The rGO–ZSO1.5 + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample exhibits η = 10.83% with VOC = 0.958 V, JSC = 18.44 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.61. In the present case, we have used a bottle-to-bottle approach for the synthesis of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3. We have prepared the MAPbI3/GBL and MAPbBr3/DMSO solutions separately and the hybrid perovskite solution has been prepared with a fixed amount of MAPbBr3/DMSO solution in MAPbI3/GBL solution. Therefore, the final solution contains GSL/DMSO (7:3 v/v). The prepared MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 solution was spin cast in two steps at 1000 rpm and 4500 rpm onto ZSO or rGO–ZSO electrodes. During the second spin coating step, one drop of toluene was dripped onto the substrate since toluene solvent is immiscible with the perovskite materials. Seok et al. demonstrated that this toluene dripping process facilitates the formation of an MAI–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase that has longer interplanar distances, which are different from those in the DMSO–PbI2–DMSO complex, by the substitution of MAI for DMSO.32 At the initial stage during spinning, the film is composed of MAI and PbI2 dissolved in the DMSO/GBL solvent mixture, whereas in the intermediate stage, the composition of the film is obtained by the evaporation of GBL. Then the toluene droplets lead to the immediate freezing of the constituents on spinning via the quick removal of the excess DMSO solvent and the rapid formation of the MAI–PbI2–DMSO phase, leaving a uniform and transparent thin layer. The role of DMSO in the MAI–PbI2–DMSO phase is to retard the rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process.33 For the GBL/DMSO solvent evaporation and crystallization of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, the spin-coated samples were dried on a hot plate; later, these samples were used in further processes. Finally, the extremely homogeneous flat film is converted into a pure crystalline MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite layer after annealing at 100 °C. Therefore, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 based devices show a higher current density.
The improved solar cell performance has been observed for the rGO–ZSO0.7 + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample due to the key role of rGO in fast transportation. Here the rGO could play a dual role as an excellent electron acceptor as well as an effective pathway between the perovskite and ZSO scaffolds that can enhance the charge injection from the perovskite to ZSO. However, the FF of the rGO–ZSO1.5 + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample reduced up to 61.52%. This can be attributed to the much higher grafting of ZSO scaffolds by a higher amount of rGO sheets. These rGO sheets may act as recombination centres. Therefore, our rGO–ZSO1.5 + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample shows a decrement in PCE.36–39
In order to verify this, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded. Fig. 5c represents the IPCE spectra as a function of wavelength for the respective devices. The IPCE spectra would offer detailed information on the effective light harvesting capability of the perovskite based solar cells. All devices show strong absorption in the 500 to 770 nm region. However, the rGO–ZSO + MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 based devices showed an increment in the region between 550 nm and 700 nm compared to our old device and rGO–ZSO + MAPbI3. These results indicate that the recombination loss in both thin devices is very low compared to ZSO–MAPbI3 based PSCs.
In order to verify our method towards different perovskites, we have synthesized formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) and prepared its mixed-halide with MAPbBr3. The preparation of a mixed halide FAPbX perovskite is described in the ESI (Experimental section S1.6 and Fig. S3†). The optimization of the annealing temperature for FAPbI3 and (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskites is summarized in Fig. S3.† From XRD analysis, it is clear that annealing temperatures of 160 °C for FAPbI3 and 100 °C for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 are enough for phase formation. In the present investigation, for comparison we have only used two composition (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x films with x = 0, 0.15. Fig. S4a† represents the XRD patterns of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x, x = 0, 0.15. The reason for the selection of this composition is that a previous study demonstrated that the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 composition shows much higher and stable efficiency.40 The sample deposited at x = 0 shows a hexagonal non-perovskite (P63mc) polymorph of FAPbI3 since we have used lower temperature (<100 °C). It is now well known that for the perfect phase formation of a perovskite, a minimum annealing temperature of 160 °C is needed. The sample annealed at 100 °C show a hexagonal non-perovskite (P63mc) phase (sharp peak observed at 11.80°). However, the FAPbI3 sample annealed at 170 °C shows a trigonal (P3m1) perovskite phase and the 11.8° peak shifted toward a higher theta value and appears at 14.02°. In the case of (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)x (x = 0.15, 0.30) mixed-halide composition, the perovskite films annealed at 100 °C show strong peaks at 14.58° and 14.76° respectively for x = 0.15 and 0.30 confirming the trigonal perovskite phase (P3m1) (ESI S3 and S4†).
The UV-Vis optical absorption spectra of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x, (x = 0, 0.15, 0.30) are shown in Fig. S4.† The bare (FAPbI3) sample annealed at 160 °C exhibited band absorption at ∼835 nm (Eg = ∼1.48 eV) while (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and (FAPbI3)0.70(MAPbBr3)0.30 samples exhibited absorption edges shifted towards shorter wavelengths of ∼ 800 nm (Eg = ∼1.55 eV) and ∼765 nm (Eg = 1.62 eV). (Please note that the band gap was determined assuming direct bandgap transition.)

Fig. 5d shows the typical energy level diagram of rGO–ZSO ETL PSCs based on the –(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite absorbing layer. The FAI energy levels are adopted from the available literature41 and band gap calculation.35,42Fig. 5e shows the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells based on ZSO and rGO–ZSO ETLs using the (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)x absorbing layer. These details are summarized in Table 1. The bare ZSO nanofiber based perovskite device shows JSC = 21.79 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.045 V, and FF = 0.72 leading to PCE η = 16.39%. The rGO–ZSO0.7 ETL sample exhibits JSC = 22.50 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.046 V, and FF = 0.76 leading to η = 17.89%. Further, the rGO–ZSO1.5 ETL based sample shows a small decrement in FF up to 0.68 with 15.78% PCE, JSC = 23.01 mA cm−2, and VOC = 1.009 V. The calculated integrated currents under the IPCE curve matched well with the JSC values from the J–V plots.

The champion devices were further used for studying the hysteresis behavior. The hysteresis behavior of the fabricated devices was studied with a 40 ms scanning delay. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves recorded under forward and reverse bias conditions. The inset table summarizes the extracted JSC, VOC and FF parameters. The champion rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au PSC exhibits PCE values of 9.40% and 12.85% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively. The reverse scan exhibits VOC = 0.993 V, JSC = 20.38 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.64, with η = 12.85%. The forward scan exhibits a decrement in PCE to 9.40% (VOC = 0.930 V, JSC = 19.82 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51). The FF was the main cause of the decrement in the PCE. From the hysteresis study, it is clear that this device shows hysteresis with an average PCE of 11.13%.

Furthermore, we have used our best optimized conditions for the poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) HTM for rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and also studied its hysteresis analysis. Fig. 6b shows the J–V curves recorded under forward and reverse bias conditions. The inset table summarizes the extracted JSC, VOC and FF parameters. The champion rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA/Au PSC exhibits PCE values of 11.40% and 13.41% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively. The forward scan exhibits VOC = 1.007 V, JSC = 19.51 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.58%, with η = 11.40%. The reverse scan exhibits a little increment in PCE to 13.41% with VOC = 1.036 V, JSC = 19.62 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.62. As per previous reports, the PTAA based device should show ≥1.100 V open circuit voltage. However, in the present case, our device showed VOC = 1.0125 V and lower FF = 0.62. This may be due to the random orientation of rGO–ZSO0.7 nanofibers and irregular deposition of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite.

Fig. 6c shows the hysteresis analysis of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 using a rGO–ZSO0.7 ETL based PSC. The optimized sample shows 17.89% and 17.77% efficiency for the reverse and forward scans, respectively. The reverse scan exhibits VOC = 1.046 V, JSC = 22.50 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.76, with η = 17.89% PCE. The forward scan exhibits a negligible decrement in PCE to 17.77% (VOC = 1.033 V, JSC = 22.52 mA cm−2, FF = 0.75). These hysteresis results exhibit an almost hysteresis-free PCE of 17.83% as compared to that of the reference cell (7.38%).
In order to analyse the electron dynamics and lifetime measurements in bare and rGO grafted ZSO ETL based PSCs, we estimated photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolution photoluminescence (TRPL) lifetime measurements of the perovskite deposited with rGO–ZSO ETLs. Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra and TRPL spectra of the of MAPbI3, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskites based on ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 scaffold ETLs. All PL and TRPL data were recorded without a HTM coating. All three samples based on ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 scaffolds exhibit a PL peak at 775 nm and 725 nm arising, respectively, from the MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite under the same experimental conditions. The PL measurements of MAPbI3 samples revealed that the emission peak at 775 nm has been drastically reduced for rGO–ZSO0.7 scaffolds and a little increment has been observed for rGO–ZSO1.5. Similarly, for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 samples, the emission peak at 725 nm has been drastically reduced for rGO–ZSO0.7 scaffolds and very small increment has been observed for rGO–ZSO1.5. It is known that PL significant quenching happens by significantly enhanced charge carrier extraction arising from the rGO grafting. These rGO-grafted ZSO scaffolds act as an electron acceptor. In the case of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskites, the emission peak appears around 765 nm which is drastically reduced for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/rGO–ZSO0.7 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/rGO–ZSO1.5 samples. This could be attributed to the effective electron transfer from the CB of the perovskite to rGO to the CB of the ZSO scaffold.

The figures on the right show the respective schematic illustration of electron generation and extraction at ZSO/perovskite and rGO–ZSO/perovskite interfaces. 
To further examine the influence of rGO on the charge dissociation, transfer rate and recombination processes, we performed TRPL (Fig. 7). The TRPL decay profile data are well fitted to a bi-exponential function that revealed the lifetime decay to be in nanoseconds. This bi-exponential decay function includes a fast decay lifetime (τ1) component and one slow decay lifetime (τ2) component.43–45 The fast decay would originate from the quenching of charge carriers, meaning that the free carriers generated from the perovskite region were transported to the respective hole or electron contacts, and the slow decay component could be attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers before the charge collection. It is also reported that non-radiative recombination mainly arises from two major competing processes regarding charge transport, namely, carrier recombination (τperovskite) and charge-carrier transfer (τCT), following the relationship 1/τheterojunction = 1/τperovskite + 1/τCT.41
The TRPL detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. The bare ZSO–MAPbI3, rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPbI3, and rGO–ZSO1.5–MAPbI3 perovskite electrodes show fast decay lifetimes of 6.055, 5.699 and 5.452 ns, respectively, while the slow decay lifetimes of the respective electrodes are 62.672, 58.204, and 60.891 ns. The ZSO–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, rGO–ZSO0.7–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, and rGO–ZSO1.5–MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite electrodes show fast decay lifetimes of 1.174, 1.141 and 1.222 ns respectively, while the slow decay lifetimes of the respective electrodes are 58.211, 4.295, and 4.428 ns. The calculated fraction values f1 for fast lifetime decay were 0.41 to 0.42 while f2 values decreased from 0.59 to 0.58 for MAPbI3 electrodes. In the case of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite, the f1 value increased very rapidly from 0.53 to 0.71 for τ1 and f2 decreased from 0.47 to 0.29 for τ2 lifetime decay. The ZSO–(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, rGO–ZSO0.7–(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, and rGO–ZSO1.5–(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, perovskite electrodes show fast decay lifetimes of 1.503, 1.39 and 1.296 ns, respectively, while the slow decay lifetimes of the respective electrodes are 16.676, 4.003, and 4.261 ns. The calculated fraction values f1 for the fast lifetime decay were 0.56 to 0.46 while f2 values decreased from 0.29 to 0.09 for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 electrodes. These results clearly indicate that τ1 and τ2 lifetime decay and the weight fraction of slow decay were shortened due to rGO grafting in ZSO scaffolds. The bare ZSO sample showed the longest charge carrier lifetime of 62.72 ns (for MAPbI3/ZSO), whereas rGO–ZSO0.7 as the ETL showed the fastest decay τ2 = 58.204 ns. On the other hand, a higher concentration of rGO in ZSO i.e. a rGO–ZSO1.5 ETL shows a relatively longer lifetime (60.891 ns). In the case of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 based PSCs, the pristine ZSO sample exhibited 58.211 ns which is reduced to 4.295 ns and further small increments up to 4.428 ns for rGO–ZSO1.5/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3.

Similar observations have been made for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 based perovskite solar cells and showed 16.676 ns, 4.003 ns and 4.264 ns, respectively, for ZSO, rGO–ZSO0.7 and rGO–ZSO1.5 based ETLs. These details are schematically represented in Fig. 7C. From these TRPL results, we concluded that the electron extraction of the photogenerated electrons from the CB of perovskites to the CB of rGO–ZSO is relatively more efficient as compared to that of the bare ZSO ETL. Therefore, rGO facilitates efficient charge dissociation in the perovskite. From TRPL analysis, it is clear that the rGO grafted on ZSO facilitates the fast electron extraction from the conduction band (CB) of the perovskite (either MAPbX or FAPbX) to the CB of ZSO. This process can be expressed as (1) (2)while, the rGO based device shows modified fast transportation (3)
Furthermore, we have studied the stability of the fabricated devices based on various compositions of ZSO nanofibrous scaffolds and MAPbI3 (Fig. S6†), MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (Fig. S7†) and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 based PSCs (Fig. S8†). The MAPbI3 based perovskite devices show exponential decay in photocurrent density at the initial stage, while after 30 min, they show a stable photocurrent density (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the FF of these devices decreased; therefore, these devices show a decrement in PCE. This may be due to the easy decomposition of perovskite in the presence of moisture of the hygroscopic amine salts.

In the case of hybrid MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 based perovskite solar cells, the JSC and FF values are stable up to 500 min and a little decrement has been observed later. This may be due to low sensitivity of mixed halide perovskites to the humidity of the cells, which might be associated with their compact and stable structure.35,44,45 Seok et al. demonstrated that the substitution of larger I atoms with smaller Br atoms in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 leads to the reduction of the lattice constant and a transition to a cubic phase.35 Since the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 shows a pseudo-tetragonal phase which is much stable than the tetragonal phase, our MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 based devices show more stability.
Devices based on the rGO–ZSO0.7 ETL exhibited superior PCE with relatively lower standard deviation in PCE (Fig. S9†). These results demonstrate that our developed method is promising and reproducible. Fig. 9 shows the average device performance of the champion cells (10 devices each) based on different bare and rGO grafted ZSO ETLs with pristine and mixed halide perovskite absorbers. At a glance, it is clear that the incorporation of rGO into ZSO ETLs facilitates improvement in PCE of many types of devices in comparison with those of controlled ZSO ETL based PSCs. This enhancement is mainly attributed due to improved photocurrent density and higher FF. The rGO serve as a bridge between perovskite and ZSO for fast electron transportation and low recombination rates. This phenomenon has been studied by PL and TRPL analysis.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, for the first time we have demonstrated the successful synthesis of GO and used it for the synthesis of rGO–ZSO nanofibers by an electrospinning process. Here, our GO + ZSO–PVP + DMF composite was directly converted into a rGO–ZSO porous nanofiber scaffold. These nanofibers were further used as an electron transporting layer (ETL) for MAPbI3, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)3−x(MAPbBr3)x based perovskite solar cells. The optimized rGO–ZSO0.75 nanofiber shows 13.41% and 17.89% power conversion efficiency for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskites, respectively. This efficiency is much higher than that of the bare ZSO ETL. The underlying mechanism of the rGO grafted ZSO scaffolds and the corresponding improved device performances were investigated carefully by TRPL analysis and the results revealed that rGO facilitates better charge collection with fast electron transportation and low recombination rates. The TRPL results shows that the average lifetime of the respective electrodes were 8.76 ns and 3.90 ns which are further decreased up to 8.25 ns and 2.47 ns, respectively, for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite based solar cells. These results confirm that the implementation of rGO in ZSO nanofibers facilitates low recombination rates and fast electron transportation. The grafting of rGO in ZSO scaffolds could serve as a highway-track for electrons to facilitate the electron injection from a perovskite into the conduction band of ZSO, leading to significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency. This successful finding indicates the toxic hydrazine free process for manufacturing rGO and its nanocomposites with highly porous ternary metal oxide nanofibers for use as promising alternative ETLs for PSCs.
