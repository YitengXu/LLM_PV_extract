    , Accepted 1st August 2018First published on 1st August 2018AbstractRealization of the absorption and conversion of wide band infrared light have been a challenge in the field of upconversion luminescence. Herein, a facile physical approach is reported to realize the cooperative absorption and conversion of dual-band infrared light by NaGdF4:Er3+ nano-glass ceramics by employing a dual-mode excitation source (980 nm + 1545 nm). A synergistic effect of infrared photons induced by dual-wavelength infrared excitation is observed. The dual-mode excited red emission intensity is 2.76 times the total red emission intensities from 980 nm and 1545 nm single excitation. This upconversion synergistic effect can be modulated by adjusting the single excitation power, and it is proved to originate from ground and excited state absorption, in which the Er3+ ions in metastable states excited by 980 nm (or 1545 nm) photons are excited again by the 1545 nm (or 980 nm) infrared photons. A rate equation model is established to simulate the dynamic process in the dual-mode infrared upconversion process. The synergistic effect provides us with a way to convert two low-energy infrared photons into middle-energy visible photons to enhance the upconversion efficiency of rare earth ion doped glass ceramics.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the scope of investigation of rare earth ion doped materials has been extended to the absorption and conversion of infrared photons for potential applications in solar cells, infrared-pumped visible lasers, color displays, optoelectronics, photocatalysis, and bioimaging,1–7 since upconversion materials can convert lower-energy photons into higher-energy ones. The response wavelength of amorphous silicon ranges from 350 nm to 750 nm, which means that most of the infrared energy (over 25%) is lost.8–10 Current research on photocatalysis has been focused on converting light from the ultraviolet and visible regions into longer-wavelength emission.11–13 However, few researchers have addressed the problem of how to manufacture luminescent materials that can simultaneously absorb and convert infrared photons with different frequencies. It is necessary to develop a phosphor that shows an optimized broad and efficient absorption band in the infrared region.
As reported, for the absorption of infrared light, the Yb3+ ion mainly absorbs 960–-1100 nm infrared light since it consists of only two levels and has only one electronic excited state, 2F5/2, that is located in the 980 nm near infrared region.14,15 The Er3+ ion has a 4f11 electronic configuration and dense energy levels located over a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to infrared, which is suitable to absorb ultraviolet, visible and infrared luminescence.16 For example, the energy gap between the ground level 4I15/2 and the first excited level 4I13/2 is about 6400 cm−1, which matches well with the absorption of about 1.54 μm photons.17,18 The energy gap between 4I15/2 and 4I11/2 matches well with the energy of 980 nm photons. Thus, the Er3+ ion is a good candidate to achieve the cooperative absorption of 980 nm and 1545 nm infrared photons. It was reported that the upconversion process relies on the excitation power of infrared light.19 After the absorption of infrared light at 980 and 1545 nm by the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states of Er3+ ion, respectively, a competition upconversion process will occur under dual-mode excitation light due to the different absorption cross-sections of the different energy levels.20 Er3+ ions in the 4I13/2 long-lifetime state from the nonradiative relaxation process in the 980 nm upconversion route will be excited again by the 1545 nm infrared photons in the upconversion route. The infrared photon–photon interactions will occur by manipulating the order and the excitation power of the single infrared photon. The study of this competition process has been reported rarely,6,7 and it will provide a method to realize the upconversion of dual-mode infrared light.
Hexagonal NaGdF4 was reported to be another efficient upconversion material with low phonon energy, as a compound isostructural with β-NaYF4.21–26 The synergistic effect of infrared photons of 980 nm and 1545 nm will be achieved in Er3+ doped NaGdF4. Glass ceramics containing fluoride nanocrystals can protect the fluoride luminescent centres from oxidization at high temperature, and also from non-radiative decay caused by some surface defects.23,24 Thus, in this work, a NaGdF4:Er3+ nano-glass ceramic is synthesized to study the properties of upconversion luminescence and the modulation mechanism of fluorescence intensity under single 980 nm, single 1545 nm and dual-mode (980 nm + 1545 nm) excitation power. The photon synergistic enhancement effect was pleasantly found. The competition mechanism of dual-mode infrared light is analyzed by simulating the process of luminescence kinetics with a rate equation model.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of samples
All starting materials are SiO2 (AR), Na2O (AR), Al2O3 (AR), AlF3 (AR), NaF (AR), Gd2O3 (99.99%) and Er2O3 (99.99%). All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification. The nominal mass composition of a glass sample was 70.1SiO2–4.3Al2O3–1.8AlF3–2.3Na2O–18.5NaF–2.7Gd2O3–0.3Er2O3. 20 g of the analytical grade raw materials was well mixed and melted at 1550 °C for 45 minutes in a furnace. Then, the melt was poured onto cold stainless steel to obtain a transparent glass. The glass was heat-treated at 700 °C for 2 h. Then, the obtained Er3+ doped glass samples were polished for optical measurements.
2.2 Measurements and characterization
The structures of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X'TRA (Switzerland ARL) instrument provided with a Cu tube with Kα radiation at 1.54056 Å. The size and shape of the samples were observed by using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Luminescence spectra were recorded using an Acton SpectraPro Sp-2300 Spectrophotometer with a photomultiplier tube equipped with a dual-mode infrared laser of 980 nm and 1545 nm as the excitation source.
2.3 Optical setup
To investigate the dual-mode optical modulation of up-conversion fluorescence, we used a coaxial optical path coupling two laser beams with a pump combiner to excite samples in the sample chamber, as shown in Fig. 1. The fluorescence signal was collected through an optical lens and sent to the spectrograph and the data collector. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 illustrates the XRD pattern, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the transparent NaGdF4:Er3+ glass ceramic. The structure of the resulting transparent nano-glass ceramics was obtained by analyzing the XRD pattern in Fig. 2 (left). One can find that the position and relative intensity of all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to hexagonal NaGdF4 according to the PDF card (No. 27-0699). The TEM image in Fig. 2 (right) shows homogeneously distributed NaGdF4 spherical crystallites precipitated in an oxyfluoride glassy matrix. The size of the NaGdF4 crystallite in the transparent ceramic is about 27.78 nm. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2 (right) confirms the well-defined lattice and good crystallinity of the resulting nano-glass ceramic. The interplanar distance d value measured through two separated crystal planes from the HRTEM image is about 0.334 nm, which can be ascribed to the (100) crystal plane of NaGdF4 crystals.

Fig. 3(a) shows the room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of NaGdF4:0.6%Er3+ glass ceramic under single 980 nm excitation. Three emission bands of Er3+ are observed at 529, 542, and 661 nm, which are ascribed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. With the increase of 980 nm excitation power, the emission intensities are enhanced, and no spectral shifts of the emission bands occur for various 980 nm excitation powers. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the 542 nm emission intensity increases sharply with the increase of the 980 nm excitation power, while the red (661 nm) emission intensity increases slowly with the increase of the 980 nm excitation power. Fig. 3(c) shows the intensity ratio of the red to green emission (IR/IG), which decreased at low power and irregularly changed at high power greater than 400 mW mm−2. In order to study the effect of different 980 nm excitation powers on the spectral properties of the Er3+ ions, the effective bandwidth Δλeff was obtained by using the following equation: (1)where I(λ) is the emission intensity at wavelength λ and Imax is the emission intensity at the peak emission wavelength.21

Fig. 3(d) shows the 980 nm excitation power-dependent effective bandwidth Δλeff of 529, 542 and 661 nm emissions. On the one hand, with the 980 nm excitation power increasing from 91.6 mW mm−2 to 232.8 mW mm−2, the Δλeff values for 529 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 661 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) show a downward trend, while the Δλeff values for 542 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) increase slowly. The Δλeff values for the three emission bands change a little at high excitation powers more than 300 mW mm−2. The Δλeff value can be used as a probe to show the spectral characteristics induced by the excitation or local ligand fields around Er3+ sites.25
The changes of Δλeff values reveal that the spectral properties of NaGdF4:Er3+ nano-glass ceramic are relatively easily modified by controlling the excitation power at low excitation powers. Similar results can be observed for the NaGdF4:Er3+ nano-glass ceramic at single 1545 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 4. Differently, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the 661 nm emission intensity increases at the fastest pace with the increase of 1545 nm excitation power. The intensity ratio of the red to green emission (IR/IG) from Fig. 4(c) first increases and then decreases. With the 1545 nm excitation power increasing from 35.6 mW mm−2 to 156.4 mW mm−2, the Δλeff values for the three emission bands show a decreasing trend. The Δλeff values for the three emission bands change a little at high excitation powers more than 200 mW mm−2, as shown in Fig. 4(d).

Notably, an unusual phenomenon is observed under the dual-mode (980 nm + 1545 nm) excitation, as shown in Fig. 5. Compared to single excitation, the emission intensities increase when the dual-mode excitation power increases, and no spectrum shift of the emission bands occurs, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The Δλeff values for green emission bands oscillate up and down at 17 nm in Fig. 5(c). The total emission intensity increases with the increase of 1545 nm excitation power.

The values of IR/IG are dependent of the 1545 nm excitation power, as shown in Fig. 6. The values of IR/IG increase and then decrease when the 980 nm excitation power is fixed at 24.8 mW mm−2, 91.6 mW mm−2, and 160.8 mW mm−2. With the increase of the 980 nm excitation power by more than 160.8 mW mm−2, the values of IR/IG show an increasing trend. The maximum value of IR/IG is 1.37. The CIE chromaticity in inset a of Fig. 6 shows that the emission color is tunable from greenish-yellow to green with the increase of the 1545 nm excitation power upon low 980 nm excitation. The CIE chromaticity in inset b of Fig. 6 shows that the emission color is tunable from green to greenish-yellow with the increase of the 1545 nm excitation power at a high 980 nm excitation power. Compared with Fig. 3(c) and 4(c), IR/IG induced by dual-mode excitation shows a different trend. This means that the populations of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states can be adjusted by controlling the excitation powers of the 1545 nm and 980 nm lasers.

The inset shows CIE(X, Y) chromaticity coordinate diagrams (a) at a low 980 nm excitation power and (b) at a high 980 nm excitation power. 
In order to explore the spectral modulation induced by the dual-mode excitation, it is necessary to calculate the relative enhancement rate for the green (or red) emission under dual-mode excitation. The relative enhancement rate (Φ) of green (or red) emission under dual-mode excitation is defined as follows: (2)where I1, I2, and I3 are the integrated emission intensities induced by single 980 nm excitation, single 1545 nm excitation, and dual-mode excitation (980 nm + 1545 nm), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(a), when the 980 nm excitation power was fixed at 160.8 mW mm−2 and the 1545 nm excitation power was adjusted from 35.6 mW mm−2 to 759.6 mW mm−2, the values of Φ first increased and then decreased with the maximum Φ = 81.12% at P1545 = 214 mW mm−2. Since the maximum values of Φ appeared mainly at low dual-mode excitation, we further studied the changes of Φ in detail by fixing the 980 nm excitation power at low values and varying the 1545 nm excitation power from 35.2 mW mm−2 to 232.8 mW mm−2, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The values of Φ first increase sharply and then irregularly decrease with the increase of 1545 nm excitation power. One can find that there is a maximum value Φ = 95.52% when the 980 nm and 1545 nm excitation powers are fixed at 209.6 mW mm−2 and 214.0 mW mm−2, respectively.

It is obvious that when I3 >(I1 + I2), the intensities of emission under dual-mode excitation are greater than those under single excitation. Similar results are observed for the 661 nm red emission, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). Notably, the maximum value reaches 172.05%. This means that the infrared photon–photon interaction occurs under dual-mode excitation. The great enhancement of green and red emissions is attributed to this unusual interaction. Similar spectral properties are observed when the 1545 nm excitation power was fixed and the 980 nm excitation power was adjusted step by step. The maximum value of relative enhancement rate reaches 176.9% for red emission and 97.36% for green emission.
To explore the origin of the emissions induced by dual-mode excitation, the relation between the total emission intensity I and the infrared excitation power P is expressed as I ∝ Pn(3)where n is the number of photons absorbed to pump the population at a particular level in the upconversion process.27 It was reported that the populations of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states needed two 980 nm infrared photons or three 1545 nm infrared photons.15,28 Based on the above analysis on the origin of emissions induced by single 980 nm or 1545 nm excitation powers, we further studied the dependences of intensities of green and red emissions on the dual-mode excitation powers, as shown in Fig. 8. It can be observed that the n values are dependent on the 980 nm excitation power, and they decrease slowly with the increase of 980 nm excitation power. Similar results can be observed when the 1545 nm excitation power is fixed. The change in the n value means that the populations of 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states of Er3+ ion can be controlled by changing the interaction of the two infrared photons.

To comprehend the enhancement mechanism of the green and red emissions, Fig. 9 shows the single mode infrared up-conversion. It is obvious that for the single 980 nm excitation corresponding to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 two-photon upconversion of Er3+, the green emission is ascribed to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition, and the red emission is ascribed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Under 1545 nm single excitation, for the 4I15/2 → 4I13/2 → 4I9/2 → 2H11/2 three-photon upconversion of Er3+, the green emission is ascribed to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition, and the red emission is ascribed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. A theoretical model was built to gain a deeper understanding of the energy transfer process under single 980 nm (or 1545 nm) excitation. We supposed that the 2H11/2/4S3/2 energy levels are the same levels in the case of the changed excitation power. The CR effect between Er3+ is neglected.29 The corresponding rate equations under single 980 nm excitation power are as follows: (4)where N0, N1, N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 are the population densities of the 4I15/2, 4I13/2, 4I11/2, 4I9/2, 4F9/2, 2H11/2/4S3/2, and 4F7/2 levels of Er3+, σi−980 is the 980 nm light absorption cross-section of the Ni states, and ρ980 is the incident 980 nm pumping power density. The terms of Wij represent the nonradiative decay rates between the levels i and j, and Aij is the radiative transition rates between the levels i and j.
 Fig. 9  Upconversion process of Er3+ (a) under 980 nm excitation and (b) under 1545 nm excitation. 
By solving the above equations, we have (5)
The corresponding rate equations under single 1545 nm excitation power are as follows: (6)where σi−1545 is the 1545 nm light absorption cross-section of the Ni state and ρ1545 is the incident 1545 nm pumping power density.
By solving the above equations, we have (7)
It can be seen that the values of IR/IG under single excitation depend on the nonradiative decay rates between the energy levels 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 and the radiative transition rates between the energy levels 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4I15/2.
As shown in Fig. 10(a), when P980 is fixed, Er3+ in the ground state will absorb energy and transfer to a high energy level, leading to various degrees of population of Er3+ in various energy levels through radiation relaxation and non-radiation relaxation processes. When P1545 is adjusted step by step, Er3+ ions need to absorb energy from not only the ground state to the high energy level, but also the other energy levels that are populated owing to 980 nm excitation, as long as the energy difference between the energy levels is satisfied. Under low 1545 nm excitation, firstly, the few Er3+ ions in the ground 4I15/2 state can be excited by the three 1545 nm INR photons in the up-conversion route. The 4I11/2 state was proved to be the long-lifetime intermediate metastable state to store energy.30,31 Secondly, the Er3+ ion in the long-lifetime 4I11/2 state from the 980 nm excitation can be excited again to 4F9/2 and 2H11/2 by one and two 1545 nm photons, respectively, in the up-conversion route. Thirdly, the Er3+ ion in the 4I13/2 state from the nonradiative relaxation process in the 980 nm up-conversion route can be excited again by two 1545 nm photons in the up-conversion route and induce the 4I13/2 → 4I9/2 → 2H11/2 and 4I13/2 →4I9/2,4I11/2 → 4F9/2 transitions. The energy consumption induced by nonradiative relaxation in the 980 nm excitation process is eliminated, achieving one plus one is greater than two results. The coexistence of the above three processes results in the upconversion process involving less than two photons on average to contribute green and red emissions under low 980 nm and 1545 nm excitation. When the 980 nm excitation power is increased, the ground state absorption will be enhanced. Thus, the two-photon up-conversion process induced by 980 nm excitation is enhanced, leading to the increase of slopes at high P980. On the other hand, the intermediate excited states 4I13/2 and 4I11/2 will be populated by more and more Er3+ ions with the increase of 1545 nm excitation power. Thus, the one-photon up-conversion processes 4I11/2 → 2H11/2 and 4I13/2 → 4F9/2 are also enhanced, leading to a decrease of the whole slopes at high P1545, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 10  Energy diagrams presenting energy transfer upconversion processes of Er3+ under dual-mode excitation with (a) fixed P980 and changed P1545, and (b) fixed P1545 and changed P980. 
Similarly, as shown in Fig. 10(b), when P1545 is fixed in a low range and P980 is adjusted step by step, firstly, the few Er3+ ions in the ground 4I15/2 state can be excited by two 980 nm photons in the up-conversion route. Secondly, the Er3+ ion in the long-lifetime 4I11/2 state from the nonradiative relaxation process in the 1545 nm up-conversion route can be excited again to 2H11/2 by one 980 nm photon. Thirdly, the Er3+ ion in the 4I13/2 state from the 980 nm excitation can be excited again by one 980 nm photon. The energy consumption induced by nonradiative relaxation in the 1545 nm excitation process is eliminated, achieving one plus one is greater than two results. The coexistence of the three processes results in the upconversion process involving two photons on average to contribute green and red emissions under low 980 nm and 1545 nm excitation. As the 1545 nm excitation power is increased, more Er3+ ions in the 4I11/2 state relax to the 4I13/2 state at high P1545, since the thermal relaxation from the 4I11/2 to 4I13/2 state becomes active.32 Thus, the two-photon up-conversion process is enhanced, leading to the increase of slopes at high P1545. On the other hand, the intermediate excited states 4I11/2 and 4I9/2 will be populated by more and more Er3+ ions. Thus, one-photon up-conversion processes 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 and 4I9/2 → 2H11/2 are enhanced, leading to the decrease of whole slopes at high P980. The corresponding rate equations under the dual-mode excitation power with fixed 980 nm excitation power are listed as follows: (8)
It can be seen that N4, N5 and IR/IG are dependent on the complex common effect of dual-mode excitation power. Under low dual-mode excitation power, the nonradiative relaxation processes from the 4I9/2 state to the 4I11/2 state and the 4F9/2 state to the 4I9/2 state can be neglected.1,20,28 By solving and simplifying the above equations, we have (9)
For the green emission, (10)
By transforming the relationship between Φ and N5, it is clear why Φ is greater than zero, as shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, for the red emission, we can also have: (11)
To investigate the dynamic change process of Φ values, the experimental Φ values for green and red emissions were fitted by using eqn (10) and (11), respectively, as shown in Fig. 11 and 12. The Φ values are dependent strongly on the 1545 nm excitation power when the 980 nm excitation power is fixed. With the increasing 1545 nm excitation power, the Φ values for green and red emissions increase firstly and then decrease. The relation between Φ and P1545 can be determined through fitting the experimental data.

 Fig. 12  1545 nm excitation power dependent Φ values for 661 nm emission. Circles show the experimental data and the red line shows the fitting line using eqn (11). 
Similar results can be obtained under dual-mode excitation power with the fixed P1545 as follows: (12)
Differently, under low dual-mode excitation power, the nonradiative relaxation processes from the 4I11/2 state to the 4I13/2 state (W21) and the 4F9/2 state to the 4I9/2 state (W43) can be neglected.1,20,28 By simplifying the above equations, we have (13)
For the green emission, (14)
Similarly, for the red emission, we can also have: (15)
The experimental data in Fig. 13(a) and (b) can be fitted by using eqn (14) and (15). The Φ values are strongly dependent on the 980 nm excitation power when the 1545 nm excitation power is fixed. With the increasing 980 nm excitation power, the Φ values for green and red emissions increase firstly and then decrease. The result shows that the theoretical analysis is in good agreement with the experimental results and the proposed model is reasonable and effective. The relation between Φ and P980 can also be determined through fitting the experimental data. From Fig. 11–13, one can find that the threshold points of the laser excitation power are different to obtain the maximum Φ values for the green and red emissions. This is attributed to the different upconversion routes under dual-mode excitation controlled by different excitation powers.30–32 This means that the synergistic effect of infrared photons can be achieved through changing the excitation powers.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an effective approach to achieve absorption and conversion of dual-mode infrared light at 980 nm and 1545 nm in NaGdF4:Er3+ nano-glass ceramic. The upconversion route can be modulated by controlling the 980 nm or 1545 nm infrared excitation power. The synergistic effect of 980 nm and 1545 nm dual-mode infrared upconversion is observed. Under dual-mode infrared excitation, a 172% absolute enhancement of the 661 nm red emission can be realized. The photon synergistic enhancement effect was the major dynamic evolution reason for this optical modulation of up-conversion fluorescence. A rate-equation model was developed to determine the relation between Φ and ρ980 or ρ1545. This work offers a method to widen the absorption of the solar spectrum from the visible–infrared waveband in photovoltaic conversion.
