    , Accepted 18th July 2016First published on 19th July 2016AbstractAn electrochemical method is presented to study the nature of the defect states in sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide nanoflake photoanodes used in water splitting. First, stoichiometric/sub-stoichiometric tungstate nanoflake arrays were deliberately developed via annealing under different atmospheres (air, O2, and H2) in different sequences. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Tauc analysis indicated the presence of oxygen vacancies, which was also confirmed via XRD and Raman analysis, with samples annealed in an air/O2 sequence resulting in the most stoichiometric monoclinic structures. A defect sensitivity factor was proposed to explain the nature of defects whether they are deep or shallow. Mott–Schottky analysis was used to confirm the expected defect donor densities, as well as to confirm the nature of the developed oxygen vacancy defect states. The tungstate photoanodes were tested in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells and their photoconversion efficiency was demonstrated and discussed in detail.
1. Introduction
It is widely accepted that oxygen vacancies are the major contributors of photocurrent in n-type metal oxide semiconductors.1 In analogy to donors in extrinsic semiconductors, these point defects form inter-bandgap states below the conduction band minimum (CBM), providing extra charge carriers under illumination. In addition, because of electron trapping processes occurring within such shallow defect states, their net effect is to increase the photoelectrons' lifetime,2 which is very beneficial upon the use of such materials in solar water splitting. The increased lifetime would allow more time for photogenerated holes in the valence band to move towards the electrode/electrolyte interface and take part in catalysis reactions, resulting in increased photocurrents. However, detrimental effects may arise in the case of deep defect states, where increased neutralization of the positive charge on the cation decreases its energy with respect to vacuum3i.e. the defect state would move farther away from the CBM, and deeper towards mid-gap. In such a case, a substantial amount of energy would be required to de-trap electrons and excite them to the CBM. In addition, the decreased crystallinity of defected structures entails lower stability, besides decreasing photocurrents due to greater scattering effects.4
To this end, defect-engineering has been an issue of interest in recent years, where the optimum extent of oxygen deficiency would lead to an increased amount of charge carriers without deteriorating crystallinity or photocurrents. Emerging recently as promising photoanodes for water splitting, tungsten oxides have been thoroughly studied from that perspective owing to the stability of a number of oxygen-rich/deficient forms, including WO3, WO2.9, WO2.8, WO2.72, and WO2.5,6 In fact, the occurrence of undesired surface reactions, such as the formation and dissolution of peroxo-species on the surface of tungsten oxides, has been shown to decrease with oxygen deficiency making its presence vital to the stability of such electrodes as photoanodes in water splitting.7 As a result, many efforts have been directed towards controlling the defect structure of tungstates through annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. Liu et al.8 studied the effect of 30 minute hydrogen treatments at variable temperatures on the defect structure of tungstate powders previously calcinated in air. An increase in absorption at energies smaller than the fundamental bandgap was attributed to the formation of metallic HxWO3, where hydrogen intercalation between WO6 octahedra was believed to create inter-bandgap states. The deterioration in structural integrity of the samples at high annealing temperatures, as evidenced from X-ray diffraction, was attributed to an increase in the defect density inside the material. Wang et al.,7 performing similar treatments on tungstate nanoflakes, interpreted the inter-bandgap states as being W5+ states (oxygen vacancies), due to the low stability of tungsten bronzes. Their results agreed with a careful study conducted by Cong et al.6 Furthermore, across a wide temperature range, hydrogen treatment caused an increase in photocurrent density compared only to air annealing, with the enhancement decreasing with annealing temperature. This was attributed to the formation of WO2.9 at high annealing temperatures (400–450 °C), which exhibits low activity towards the water oxidation reaction. Working on tungstate nanoplates, Yang et al.9 observed an increase in the photocurrent in tungstate samples annealed in a H2 atmosphere for 2 h at 400 °C. This phenomenon was also attributed to the increased shallow oxygen vacancy defect states during the annealing process via the following reaction: WO3−x + yH2 → WO3−x−y + yH2O(1) In contrast, a more recent study10 by the same group on tungstate nanoflakes presented a decrease in photocurrent density in samples calcinated in pure hydrogen gas for 2 h at 450 °C. This deterioration was connected with the decrease in conductivity owing to the increase of the electron transport barrier within oxygen-deficient WO3 nanoflakes. In this sense, another phenomenon connected with the deteriorating role of oxygen vacancies in tungstates is the decreased photon absorption within the space-charge region, where the abundance of donor states is known to decrease the depletion region width (WSC),10,11i.e. (2)such that ND is the donor density. For materials with indirect bandgaps such as tungstates, and thus low absorption coefficients, this decrease in depletion region width renders most of the incident light being absorbed in the bulk of the material, where the favorable effects of surface polarization cease to exist.10
Evidently, a full understanding of the reasons behind photocurrent enhancement/deterioration in oxygen-deficient tungstates seems to be lacking, and the exact role of oxygen vacancies in charge carrier dynamics inside tungstate electrodes is yet to be fully comprehended. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, studies on hydrogen-annealed WO3 nanoflakes show scattering in terms of annealing conditions. Herein, we present a careful study of defect engineering inside nanostructured tungstate electrodes, offering a step towards understanding the interplay between defect states and photoconversion efficiencies. In particular, using a cheap one-step thermoacidic route towards the synthesis of the promising WO3 nanoflakes, the effect of annealing under different gases is studied, and the optimum annealing conditions to achieve the highest photocurrent possible are identified.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Photoanode preparation
Tungsten sheets (0.25 mm thick, 99.9% purity, Alfa Aesar) were cut into 2 × 1 cm2 foils, which were mechanically polished using a SiC sandpaper, then degreased by sonication in acetone, ethanol and distilled water each for 10 min. In order to produce WO3 nanoflake photoanodes, W foils were placed perpendicularly in aqueous solutions containing 1 M HNO3 and heated up to 90 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared samples were annealed under different gases (air, H2 and O2) for 2 h at 450 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. Additional treatments included annealing in air under the aforementioned conditions, then in O2 or H2 for 30 min at 350 °C.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies of the annealed samples were examined using a Zeiss SEM Ultra 60 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The crystalline phases were detected and identified using an X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) on an X'Pert PRO MRD with a copper source at a scan rate (2θ) of 1° s−1. The optical characterization of the films was performed using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a solid sample holder and an integrated sphere for reflectance measurements. Raman measurements were performed on a Raman microscope (ProRaman-L Analyzer) using an excitation laser beam wavelength of 532 nm. Photoelectrochemical properties were investigated in 1 M H2SO4 solution using a three-electrode configuration with the WO3 nanoflake samples as working electrodes, Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) as the reference, and a platinum foil as the counter electrode. A scanning potentiostat (Biologic SP-200) was used to measure dark and illuminated currents at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1, with an applied bias from 0 V to 1.2 V vs. SCE supplied to the anode. Sunlight was simulated using a 300 W ozone-free xenon lamp and an AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm−2. Impedance spectra were measured at different applied potentials versus SCE. Z-fit software was used to fit the spectra to equivalent circuits.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–e shows the FESEM top-view images of the fabricated WO3 nanoflake thin films. The thermoacidic treatment resulted in the formation of consistent nanoflakes with dimensions of about 350 × 550 × 55 nm3. Annealing the nanoflakes at 450 °C under streams of different gases conserved their structure and dimensions (Fig. 1a–e). Note that the thickness of the nanoflakes is within the proximity of the minority carrier diffusion length (150 nm).12,13 This should play a role in decreasing charge carrier recombination, where photogenerated holes would easily reach the surface and take part in water splitting reactions before recombining with electrons. Fig. 1f shows the color change in annealing atmosphere. The as-prepared sample exhibited a greenish color. Annealing under different atmospheres resulted in a color change to dark blue, with the samples annealed in a pure hydrogen atmosphere showing the darkest appearance. This color variation upon annealing could be ascribed to the possible modification in the crystal structure.8 In particular, blue color indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies and the formation of sub-stoichiometric WO3−x.7,14

In order to gain more insights into the effect of thermal treatment on the optical properties of tungstate nanoflakes, room temperature UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) as well as Tauc plots of the annealed WO3 nanoflakes were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the annealed samples exhibited low reflectance in the UV region due to sample absorbance and lack of scattering.8 Moreover, all DRS spectra showed similar absorption edges around 450 nm, as well as absorption tails in the visible and near-infrared regions. It is widely accepted that these absorption tails are ascribed to absorption of electrons in interband states, such as oxygen vacancies, produced during thermal annealing.7,15 Similar absorption tails were also attributed to localized surface plasmon resonances that come about from the metallic behavior of defected WO3−x with x > 0.1.16 In order to calculate the optical band gap of the tungstate samples, the Kubelka–Munk transfer model was used, i.e. (3)
 Fig. 2  (a) UV-Vis absorbance spectra for samples annealed under different atmospheres. (b) The respective XRD patterns of the samples. 
Assuming the reflectance (R) and scattering (s) coefficients being λ-independent, f(R) would then be proportional to the absorption coefficient (α), and Tauc plots can be drawn using f(R) in place of α (Fig. S1, ESI†). Thus, the optical band gaps (Eg) were determined by extrapolation of the linear region of the plot of (fhν)1/nversus photon energy (hν) (n equals 2 for allowed indirect transitions between O 2p and W 5d orbitals). The band gap values are listed in Table 1.

As presented in Table 1, the band gaps of all annealed samples lay within the upper limit of the values reported in the literature.17–19 This was attributed before to distortions in the WO6 octahedra building blocks of the crystal lattice,20 a case known to occur in highly-defected tungstates such as WO2.72.7 Thus, visual and optical analyses point towards the formation of defected structures in all annealing atmospheres.
In order to investigate the effect of annealing atmospheres on the structural characteristics of the WO3 nanoflakes, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed. Fig. 2b and Table 2 show the XRD patterns and peak information of the annealed WO3 thin films, respectively. The spectra of the annealed films showed diffraction peaks that can be indexed to the monoclinic phase of WO3 [space group P21/n with lattice constants a = 7.309 Å, b = 7.522 Å, c = 7.678 Å and β = 90.92° (ICDD 32-1395)], which is the most stable and photoactive phase of WO3 except for the one annealed under only a stream of H2.14 For samples annealed in air, a preferential growth in the (002) over (200) planes was observed, with contributions from the (020) plane appearing as a tail between both peaks. This relative decrease in the intensity of the (200) plane is a characteristic feature for the formation of WO2.9 and WO2.82.8 In such a case, the intense peak at the smaller 2 theta side is more appropriately ascribed to the (010) plane of a defective oxide structure rather than the (002).7,17 However, given the plethora of peaks indicating a monoclinic phase in the air-annealed sample as shown in Fig. 2b, it is hard to confirm the presence of a defective oxide phase in our samples from XRD. As expected, annealing in a pure O2 atmosphere leads to an enhancement in crystallinity as concluded from the narrowing of the (002) dominant peak (Table 2). Surprisingly, following air annealing of the samples with a 30 min-thermal treatment in O2 showed the same peak narrowing in the (002) plane, as well as the narrower (200) peaks, indicating a more stoichiometric phase. In addition, a preferential growth over the (200) plane was observed. On the other hand, following air-annealing with a 30 min treatment in H2 leads to little peak sharpening in both peaks, resulting in a structure similar to the air-annealed sample. Also, notable in this sample is the low contribution from the (020) plane. Annealing in a pure H2 atmosphere, however, leads to a disappearance of all monoclinic peaks, with a very broad peak centered near 24°, indicating the formation of a highly-defective phase.

The average crystal size (D) was calculated based on the dominant growth orientation, according to Scherrer's equation: (4)where β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) intensity, k is a constant (0.90), and λ is the incident X-ray wavelength. As presented in Table 2, because grain growth indicates enhanced crystallinity, it can be inferred that dominance of a stoichiometric monoclinic phase in the samples showed the following order: air + O2 > O2 > air + H2 > air > H2. Raman spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) confirmed the presence of the monoclinic phase with the characteristic peaks corresponding to vibrational modes of tungstates centered at 267, 708 and 804 cm−1 for all samples except that annealed only under H2 stream. It is notable that a monoclinic-characteristic peak centered at 319 cm−1 was very weak in all samples, with the sample annealed in O2 after air showing the most intense peak. This confirms the perception of a defected structure in all samples, with the (air + O2) sample showing the greatest extent of crystallinity.
Both UV-Vis spectra and XRD patterns confirm the presence of defective oxide layers. However, neither can infer the nature of such defects. It has been established that high current densities in the dark are indicative of the presence of donor defect states,21 where the added photogenerated electrons may easily jump into the conduction band forming current without the need for a substantial amount of energy. In tungstates, such surface states are known to originate from oxygen vacancies, where lower-valence Wx+ (x = 5, 4,… etc.) states form beneath the CBM.7,17 In particular, the W5+ shallow states act as donor states and are expected to increase the photocurrent density by supplying charge carriers to the CB at a low cost of energy. On the other hand, electrons trapped in deeper states, such as W4+, would need a substantial amount of energy to get excited to the CBM and take part in photocurrent development. Until this point, with the presented analyses showing a defective structure in all samples, an increase in photocurrents should be indicative of the presence of more shallow donor W5+ states, and less deep W4+ states. In contrast, a decrease in photocurrent would indicate either a reduction in shallow donor states, or an increase in deep trap states, or both. To investigate the nature of the defect states in tungstate nanoflake samples annealed under different atmospheres, J–V plots were recorded (Fig. 3a). As shown, the performance of the samples annealed in air was superior to that of the other electrodes with a photocurrent density reaching 1.33 mA cm−2 at 1.2 VSCE. Dark currents for air-annealed samples also showed high values relative to all samples except for the one annealed in H2, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3a and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Both observations are consistent with increased shallow defect states (e.g. W5+ states).

(c) Mott–Schottky plots of the tungstate nanoflakes except the sample (air + O2), which was removed due to low stability during testing. 
On the other extreme, samples annealed in a pure H2 atmosphere showed the lowest photocurrent and the highest dark current. These observations align well with the optical and structural analyses, where a highly defected structure, mostly composed of deep lower-valence Wx+ states, evolves in the long H2 treatment. The rest of the samples showed decreased photocurrents, which suggests either an increase in deep defect states, or a decrease in shallow ones, or both. To analyse those samples, a current density shift term is defined (C) measuring the ratio of the current density of a sample annealed under any gas stream to that of a sample annealed in air, i.e. (5) Based on that term, a defect sensitivity factor is proposed as follows: (6)where Cdark and Clight are the corresponding ratios in the dark and under illumination, respectively. This factor illustrates the decrease in dark current versus the decrease in photocurrent under any given annealing conditions. Fig. 3b shows the defect sensitivity factors for tungstate nanoflakes annealed under different conditions. As shown, treating air-annealed samples with O2 caused a decrease in dark currents substantially greater than the decrease in photocurrents (with the ratio Cdark being smaller than Clight). This is a direct indication of decreased defect states in the sample, which agrees well with XRD and Raman results showing increased crystallinity. Annealing samples only in pure O2 also resulted in a similar effect, but for higher dark and photocurrents overall compared to the O2-treated, air-annealed samples. These higher photocurrents indicate more abundance of shallow surface states feeding the CB with electrons, which is confirmed by the higher dark currents that are a direct indication of inter-band states. All in all, both samples showed decreased dark and photocurrents indicating the enhanced crystallinity compared to air-annealed samples, in accordance with XRD data. Finally, following air annealing by a H2 treatment leads to an increase in dark currents and a decrease in photocurrents (a defect sensitivity factor exceeding unity). This can be attributed to an increase in deep defect states, which act as deep electron traps making it difficult for photogenerated electrons coming from the VB to reach the CBM. In turn, these trapped electrons substantially contribute to dark currents given they are now nearer to the CBM. Fig. 3b also shows schematic band diagrams for the three samples illustrating the proposed nature of defects in these samples.
Based on the J–V data, the following can be inferred on the arrangement of the samples according to the abundance of defect states: H2 > air + H2 > air > O2 > air + O2, well agreeing with structural analysis of the samples. The fact that the samples treated with oxygen after air annealing showed the structure closest to stoichiometry, which was also confirmed from photocurrent transients (Fig. S3, ESI†), where this particular sample showed a decreasing photocurrent density with time, and it is well-known that stoichiometric tungstates are less stable than their sub-stoichiometric counterparts, even in acidic media.8,22 The analysis of photocurrent density data was also confirmed by Mott–Schottky analysis. Fig. 3c shows the Mott–Schottky plots for samples annealed in air, oxygen and hydrogen, as well as samples treated with H2 after air annealing. Samples treated with O2 after air annealing were too unstable to give reliable results, especially in the 5 hour-long Mott–Schottky experiments. As shown, all the samples exhibited positive slope characteristic of n-type semiconductors. Flat band potentials (VFB) and donor densities (ND) were extracted from the plots at frequencies high enough, where capacitance is independent upon frequency, via the following relation: (7)where CSC is the space charge capacitance, and VApplied is the applied potential bias. Table 3 shows the extracted data. Donor density data show a decrease in donor states in O2-annealed samples compared to air-annealed ones, as well as an increase in donor states with hydrogen treatments, agreeing well with the photocurrent data. More importantly, samples annealed in H2 or treated with H2 after air annealing showed more anodic VFB, indicating some sort of Fermi level pinning, which is known to occur with the abundance of trap states.23 As expected, this phenomenon is stronger in samples annealed in pure H2, where a greater abundance of deep defect states would push the Fermi level farther away from the CBM. On the other hand, decreasing the defect states with O2 annealing reduced the Fermi level pinning allowing it to move closer to the CBM, resulting in more cathodic VFB for such samples compared to the air-annealed counterpart. Therefore, treating tungstate nanoflakes in a hydrogen atmosphere increases the defect states (shallow and deep). With the increase in shallow states enhancing photocurrent densities, and the increase in deep defect states having more detrimental effects on photoactivity, the development of contradictory results in the literature is expected under different treatment conditions (e.g. H2 gas flow rate, temperature…etc.). Thus, optimization of the hydrogen treatments on tungstate nanoflakes is needed to reach the greatest amount of shallow donor states, with the least amount of deep trap states.

Finally, to compare the samples developed in this study to those in the literature, it is interesting to note that samples only annealed in air, and those treated with H2 afterwards showed photocurrent densities (1.33 and 1.24 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V) that are superior to those reported for triple-layered nanostructured WO3 (0.9 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V),12 hydrothermally-prepared plate-like WO3 (0.87 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V),24 dual-etched and reduced WO3 photoanodes (1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V).25 The solar-to-chemical power conversion (photoconversion) efficiencies of all samples are shown in Fig. 4. The photoconversion efficiency η was calculated using the following formula:26 (8)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpEorev is the total power output, jp|Eappl| is the electrical power input, and Io is the power density of incident light (100 mW cm−2). The applied potential Eappl = Emeans − EOCP, and Erev equals 1.23 VNHE. The maximum photoconversion efficiencies for the synthesized nanoflakes, under AM 1.5G illumination, are shown in Table 4. Samples annealed only in air and the ones treated in H2 afterwards exhibited the maximum photoconversion efficiencies of 0.43% and 0.33%, respectively. Both are higher than the 0.2% maximum photoconversion efficiency reported for Au nanoparticle-decorated WO3 nanorod arrays.27

4. Conclusion
This study demonstrates a facile electrochemical method to investigate the nature of oxygen vacancy defect states in tungstate nanoflake arrays. Annealing under different gas atmospheres was used to engineer the defects in the material. UV-Vis spectra and XRD patterns confirmed the presence of defected tungstate structures in all samples, with the samples annealed in air followed by a 30 minute O2 treatment showing the most stoichiometric monoclinic structures. The J–V plots in the dark and under illumination were used to investigate whether the oxygen vacancy states were deep or shallow in nature. It was concluded that the defects in the material increased in the following order of annealing gases: air + O2 < O2 < air < air + H2 < H2. This order was confirmed using the donor density values extracted from the Mott–Schottky analysis. Also, the estimated flat band potentials were used to confirm the fact that treating tungstate nanoflakes with H2 induced both shallow and deep defect states in the material. The enhanced stoichiometry of the samples treated with O2 after air annealing was confirmed using photocurrent transients.28
