    , Accepted 7th September 2018First published on 10th September 2018AbstractThe interactions between poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and graphene oxide (GO) have endowed the P3HT/GO composite with excellent properties. Controlling these interactions is important to improve the performance of P3HT-based devices. In this work, ultrasonication was used to regulate the nanostructures of P3HTs (high Mw and low Mw), and further strongly affected the interactions between P3HTs and GO. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) were used to study the effects of ultrasonication on the interfacial interactions between P3HTs and GO. With prolonged ultrasonication time, the molecular order of high Mw P3HT nanofibers increased, but that of low Mw P3HT nanofibers decreased. Molecular order is a crucial factor affecting the interfacial interactions between P3HTs and GO, and the amounts of P3HT nanofibers absorbed onto the GO surface increased with the decreased molecular order of the nanofibers. After absorption, the overall molecular order of P3HT/GO composite nanofibers was determined by the nanofibers absorbed onto the GO surface and the nanofibers nucleated by GO. Compared with the molecular order of the nanofibers before absorption, the overall molecular order of the composites with high Mw P3HT increased, but that of composites with low Mw P3HT decreased. These findings can help to understand and modulate the interactions between P3HT nanofibers and GO to provide more information in the field of interfacial engineering of conjugated polymers in polymer-based devices.
Introduction
Graphene is a two dimensional semi-metal that is made up of sp2 hybridized carbon, which is a “zero-band gap” semiconductor possessing high conductivity and exhibiting a large ambipolar electric field-effect, enabling electron or hole doping via electrostatic gating.1,2 The thickness of graphene is a single atomic layer, but the lateral sizes range from a few to hundreds of micrometers.3–5 These unique properties endow graphene with the ability to have charge transfer interactions with diverse molecules, especially conjugated polymers.6–8
Graphene oxide (GO) is graphene interspersed with polar oxygenated domains. The strong π–π interactions between poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) and GO allowed P3HT/GO composites to be formed.9,10 Many research groups have investigated the interactions between P3HT and GO and used P3HT/GO composites in polymer photoelectric devices. For example, Samori et al. investigated the surface potential of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and P3HT through Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), and correlated the surface potential with the mobility of P3HT/RGO based field-effect transistors (FETs).11 They found that the addition of RGO could significantly improve the hole mobility. Yang et al. found that P3HT molecules could adhere to the GO surface to form P3HT crystals due to the strong π–π interactions between P3HT and GO.12 P3HT crystals prevented GO sheets from aggregating and greatly improved the GO dispersibility in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). Wang et al. prepared the P3HT/GO hybrid via π–π interactions between P3HT and GO and found that the hybrid had a broad-band absorption and enhanced photocatalytic properties.13 Wang et al. prepared a P3HT-coated GO composite (P-GO) and found that bulk heterojunction P3HT:[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) solar cells exhibited a close to 18% power conversion efficiency enhancement in the presence of P-GO.14 These reports verify that the interactions between GO and P3HT have endowed the P3HT/GO composite with excellent properties, which neither of them had. However, although most of these groups verified the strong interactions between GO and P3HT and found that the interactions are the critical factors in improving the performance of devices, controlling these interactions is still a challenge. Yu et al. prepared P3HT nanofibers with different structures and intrachain orders by using different solvents.15 They found that GO can be differently doped when GO interacted with different P3HT nanofibers. They also found that stronger interfacial interactions between P3HT and GO occurred after thermal annealing due to the changes in the P3HT chain conformations and packing order.16 Yu's work demonstrated that the nanostructures of P3HT strongly affected the interactions between P3HT and GO.
Ultrasonication is a common method used to regulate the crystallization behavior of conjugated polymers.17–20 Amassian's group reported that P3HT chains could be gradually disentangled in a marginal solvent via the ultrasonication of the polymer solution, leading to improved diffusivity of precursor species, enhanced aggregation, and intramolecular order of P3HT in solution.21 Reducing the chain entanglements of P3HT in solution increased the carrier mobility up to ∼20-fold. Han et al. found that ultrasonication could promote the order–disorder transformation of P3HT in solution, and substantially improve crystallinity in the P3HT film.22 Our previous work reported that ultrasonciation could cause the concentration of the P3HT solution to fluctuate and promote the disentanglement of P3HT chains simultaneously at the crystallization temperature in a marginal solvent, and these two effects of ultrasonication were beneficial to the crystallization of P3HT.23 The Reichmanis group reported that ultrasonication could regulate the crystallization of P3HT and increase the mobility of FETs.24,25 Although ultrasonication is a frequently-used operation during the fabrication of devices, and GO is often used in devices to improve the performance, no one has reported the effects of ultrasonication on the interactions between P3HT and GO. In this work, we regulate the crystallization and molecular order of P3HT (low and high Mw) nanofibers in a marginal solvent via ultrasonication and investigate the interactions between different P3HT nanofibers and GO by using AFM, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The molecular order of P3HT nanofibers is revealed to be a critical factor in determining the interactions between P3HT and GO.
Experimental section
Materials
Low Mw P3HT (Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1, dispersity 1.83, H-T regioregularity ≥96%) and high Mw P3HT (Mw = 7.9 × 104 g mol−1, dispersity 1.24, H-T regioregularity ≥90%) were purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. The Mw and dispersity of the P3HTs were obtained from gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Anisole was purchased from Acros Organics, toluene was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company, and GO was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co. All materials were used as received.
Preparation of P3HT nanofibers and P3HT nanofiber/GO composites
A P3HT solution with a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 was prepared by dissolving P3HT in anisole:toluene (volume ratio 3:1) mixed solvent. The solution was stirred at 85 °C for 1 h and then quenched to 20 °C. The solution was ultrasonicated with a frequency of 40 kHz and a power of 100 W (KQ-100E ultrasonic cleaner) at 20 °C for 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min. Afterwards, the P3HT solution was maintained at 20 °C for 2 h (Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1) or 24 h (Mw = 7.9 × 104 g mol−1) for complete crystallization. The P3HT solution crystallized at 20 °C under quiescent conditions (without ultrasonication) was also prepared. A GO/water suspension with a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 was ultrasonicated for 10 min. The supernatant liquid of the GO suspension was diluted five times, and a GO monolayer film was prepared by dropping 30 μL of diluted GO suspension onto a Si substrate (or quartz plate) and drying it in air at room temperature. After the Si (or quartz) was coated by the GO monolayer film, it was dipped into finished crystallized P3HT solutions for 5 min (for AFM measurement) or 24 h (for UV-vis, GIXRD or Raman measurement), followed by immersion in anisole:toluene mixed solvent for 1 min to remove the unabsorbed P3HT nanofibers.
Characterization
UV-vis spectra were acquired on an Angilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. The UV-vis absorbance at wavelength λ = 350–700 nm was collected. AFM (Nanoscope VIII MultiMode, Bruker) measurements were taken in tapping mode, and triangular silicon tips (TESP) (radius is 6.5 nm) with a resonance frequency of ∼300 kHz and a spring constant of approximately 40 N m−1 were used. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM Aramis (Horiba Jobin Yvon Company). The excitation wavelength was 532 nm. The conventional potassium bromide (KBr) method was used to measure the infrared spectra of GO, and the infrared spectrum was recorded on an AVATAR 360 FTIR spectrometer with a wave number resolution of 4 cm−1 in the frequency of 4000–400 cm−1. GPC (PLGPC50) was used to measure Mw and the dispersity of P3HTs. The solvent used was tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the flow rate was 1 mL min−1; the measurement temperature was 40 °C. Narrow linear polystyrene (PS) is used as the standard sample. GIXRD measurements were performed at 1W1A (λ = 0.1549 nm) at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator and a photon energy of 8.0049 keV. An incident angle of 0.1° was chosen to ensure probing of the samples. The GIXRD images were normalized for exposure time during data processing, and the sample thickness was normalized for treating GIXRD data.
Results and discussion
Ultrasonication can dramatically affect the crystalline morphology and structure of P3HT. In order to study this, the ultrasonicated P3HT solutions were allowed to rest until their UV-vis absorbance spectra showed no further change suggesting that assembly was complete. In this work, we denote these solutions as “finished crystallized P3HT solutions”. 50 μL of these finished crystallized high Mw P3HT solutions were spin-coated at 1500 rpm onto silicon wafers to form P3HT films. The crystalline morphologies of high Mw P3HT ultrasonicated for different times were observed by AFM, as shown in Fig. 1. High Mw P3HT forms nanofibers in the anisole:toluene mixed solvent with or without ultrasonication. Under the quiescent crystallization, P3HT molecular chains entangle to restrict nucleation and crystallization, resulting in a low amount of P3HT nanofibers and entanglement of some nanofibers. In our previous work, we found that ultrasonication could promote the disentanglement of P3HT chains and cause the concentration of the P3HT solution to fluctuate.23 Here, after ultrasonicating the solution, the disentanglement of long polymer chains helps the molecular packing to crystallize, meanwhile, the concentration fluctuation helps the molecular chains to nucleate and crystallize in the high-concentration region. The disentanglement and concentration fluctuation effects lead to more nanofibers forming with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, as shown in Fig. 1. The AFM data indicate that ultrasonication increases the amount of high Mw P3HT nanofibers in the mixed solvent at 20 °C.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of high Mw P3HT films spin-coated from finished crystallized P3HT solutions. The P3HT films show optical absorption peaks at ∼510 nm (0–2 absorption) corresponding to π–π absorption, and at ∼550 nm (0–1 absorption), and ∼600 nm (0–0 absorption) corresponding to shoulders for two vibronic absorptions of P3HT in the solid state.26,27 The absorption intensity of the high Mw P3HT films increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, indicating that the amount of nanofibers of high Mw P3HT increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time; these results are in accordance with the AFM results. The absorbance ratio of A0–0/A0–1 relates to the molecular order of P3HT nanostructures. An increase in the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio corresponds to a decrease in interchain exciton coupling and an increase in intrachain excitonic coupling, therefore an increase in the conjugation length and intramolecular order of P3HT nanofibers.28Fig. 2b and Table S1 (ESI†) show that the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, indicating that ultrasonication increases the intramolecular order of high Mw P3HT nanofibers.

Raman spectroscopy is a simple and powerful technique to study the molecular order of conjugated polymers and their blend films.29,30 In Raman modes of P3HT, the main in-plane ring skeleton modes are at ∼1450 cm−1 (symmetric CC stretch mode) and ∼1386 cm−1 (C–C intraring stretch mode).31 The more ordered P3HT phase can be identified by a large shift to lower wavenumber in the CC mode peak position and a much narrower full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) of the CC mode.32 We used Raman spectra to investigate the variation of the molecular order of high Mw P3HT induced by ultrasonication. Fig. 3 shows that the peak position of the CC mode is shifted to lower wavenumber from ∼1454 cm−1 for quiescent crystallized P3HT to ∼1448 cm−1 for P3HT crystallized after ultrasonication for 10 min. It is reasonable to consider that the molecular order of high Mw P3HT nanofibers increases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time. Moreover, the fwhm of this CC mode of P3HT films decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, reflecting the higher molecular order of P3HT films ultrasonicated for long times. The CC peak positions and fwhms of high Mw P3HT films with different ultrasonication times are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†).

The increased amount of P3HT nanofibers with ultrasonication shown in AFM images and UV-vis spectra is expected to lead to higher crystallinity of P3HT. GIXRD was used to investigate the crystallinity of high Mw P3HT films prepared from solutions ultrasonicated for different times, as shown in Fig. 4. In all P3HT films there is a diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.5° which is the (100) lattice plane, indicating that ultrasonication cannot change the crystal form of P3HT. The peak area can be used to compare the crystallinity. Fig. 4 shows that the crystallinity of high Mw P3HT increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time.

The data above suggest that ultrasonication improves the crystallization of high Mw P3HT. The amount of nanofibers, the crystallinity, and the molecular order of P3HT increase with the increase of ultrasonication time. Polymer chains are known to form entanglements in both solution and molten states, which hinder molecular motion and impact the molecular assembly in the solid state. The formation of high quality P3HT crystals with higher order is related to the solvent properties and the molecular weight of P3HT.21 The anisole:toluene mixed solvent is a marginal solvent of P3HT; with the decrease of the solubilizing capability of the solvent (the solution was quenched from 85 °C to 20 °C), the solvophobic forces increase, making the interactions and entanglements among the polymer chains become strong.23 The molecular weight of P3HT also affects the chain conformation and entanglement in the marginal solvent. Stingelin et al. found that the viscosity of a 0.1 wt% P3HT solution in ODCB (21 °C) exhibited a sharp upturn when Mw ≧ 3.5 × 104 g mol−1, namely, P3HT molecular chains began to entangle when Mw ≧ 3.5 × 104 g mol−1.33 Here, Mw of P3HT is 7.9 × 104 g mol−1; a higher molecular weight leads to a longer contour length, a decreased effective hydrodynamic volume, and therefore a higher chance to form binary hooking which results in more entanglements. When the high Mw P3HT in marginal solvent was ultrasonicated at 20 °C, the disentanglement of the P3HT chains in solution via ultrasonication facilitates the movement of polymer chains by alleviating the suppression and hindrance from surrounding polymer molecules, resulting in increased freedom of polymer chains. The concentration fluctuation makes disentangled P3HT chains nucleate and crystallize quickly in the high-concentration region. These kinetic factors in solution are shown to promote the formation of high Mw P3HT nanofibers with local and long-range order, namely, the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio increases, the CC peak position decreases and the fwhm narrows with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time.
We prepared GO sheets and investigated GO morphology by using AFM, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). AFM measurement indicates that the GO monolayer sheet is about 1.0 ± 0.1 nm in thickness, in good agreement with the characteristic value of the GO monolayer reported previously.3,12 The chemical characterization of GO was carried out using Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and GIXRD, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In the Raman spectrum, the position of the D band, G band and 2D band of GO is ∼1350 cm−1, 1580 cm−1 and 2700 cm−1, respectively. The Fourier infrared spectrum shows a peak at 1360 cm−1 denoting the CC stretching vibration and the characteristic absorption peak at 1730 cm−1 denotes the CO stretching vibration. The GIXRD curve shows only one peak at 2θ = 10.1°, which is the characteristic peak of GO. Incidentally, there is no peak at 2θ = 26.0°, which is the characteristic peak of graphite, indicating that the degree of oxidation of GO is high. Si coated by a GO monolayer was dipped into finished crystallized high Mw P3HT solutions for 5 min, then it was immersed in the corresponding mixed solvent for 1 min to remove the unabsorbed P3HT nanofibers.15 AFM was used to observe the morphologies of the high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites, as shown in Fig. 5. It shows that some P3HT nanofibers exist on the GO surface, indicating that there are attractive interactions between high Mw P3HT nanofibers and GO.15 AFM results show that the amount of high Mw P3HT nanofibers absorbed onto the GO surfaces decreases dramatically with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, indicating that these interactions are much stronger between the high Mw P3HT crystallized under quiescent conditions and GO.
 Fig. 5  AFM images of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites with nanofibers prepared in the solutions ultrasonicated for different times: (a) 0 min, (b) 1 min, (c) 5 min, and (d) 10 min. 
UV-vis measurements were performed, and the A0–0/A0–1 ratios of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites were calculated to investigate the interactions between different P3HT nanofibers and GO. Fig. 6a shows that all the UV-vis absorption spectra of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites exhibit peaks at ∼510, ∼550, and ∼600 nm, which are in accordance with those of high Mw P3HT nanofibers before absorption. The light-absorption intensity of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, verifying that the interactions between high Mw P3HT nanofibers and GO are strong for P3HT crystallized under quiescent conditions. Namely, the interactions are strong for P3HT with low molecular order. Fig. 6b and Table S1 (ESI†) show that the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites increases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, and the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of the composites is higher than that of nanofibers before absorption. We will discuss this aspect in the following section.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra and (b) the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. P3HT nanofibers were prepared in the solutions ultrasonicated for different times. 
Raman spectra were used to investigate the interactions between different high Mw P3HT nanofibers and GO, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 and Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). Notably, after the GO introduction, all the CC bands in these high Mw P3HT nanofibers shifted to low frequencies, indicating that high Mw P3HT nanofibers interact with GO.15,32 The shift is slightly larger for the nanofibers crystallized under quiescent conditions, indicating that the interactions between nanofibers crystallized under quiescent conditions and GO are the strongest. Fig. 7b shows that all the fwhms of this CC mode become smaller compared with those of nanofibers before absorption. It is reasonable to consider that the degree of molecular order of P3HT nanofibers increases after absorption onto the surface of GO. This fact is consistent with the increased A0–0/A0–1 ratio in UV-vis results. The difference of the fwhm (Δfwhm) of high Mw P3HT nanofibers before and after absorption (Δfwhm = fwhmP3HTnanofibers/GO − fwhmP3HTnanofibers) decreases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, even verifying that the interactions between high Mw P3HT nanofibers and GO decrease with the increase of the molecular order of P3HT nanofibers.

In summary, we find that (1) the amount of the absorbed high Mw P3HT nanofibers on the GO surface decreases with the increase of the molecular order of the nanofibers; and (2) the molecular order of P3HT nanofibers in the high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites increases compared with that of the nanofibers before absorption. In this work, the high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composite films used for the UV-vis and Raman measurements were prepared by first drop-coating GO onto the substrates, followed by dipping the substrates already coated with GO into the finished crystallized P3HT solutions for 24 h. The pre-existing nanofibers in solution will absorb onto the GO surface by the interactions between GO and nanofibers. The molecular order of pre-existing nanofibers does not change during the dipping process.15 Thus, the increased A0–0/A0–1 ratio, and the decreased peak position, and fwhm of the CC mode are not related to the pre-existing nanofibers. In the finished crystallized P3HT solution, the amounts of the dissolved molecular chains and the nanofibers reach a balance. In general, these dissolved molecular chains cannot further crystallize in the solution. However, there are strong interactions between GO and P3HT molecular chains. Yang et al. reported that P3HT crystallized on GO in ODCB (a good solvent for P3HT) due to the strong π–π interactions between them.12 Here, once GO was dipped into the finished crystallized P3HT solution, the P3HT molecular chains would adhere to the GO surface forced by the strong π–π stacking interactions and then grow on the GO crystal cores to form P3HT nanofibers. The UV-vis spectra of the finished crystallized P3HT solution before and after GO physisorption are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The UV-vis absorption intensity of the peak at 450 nm (the absorption peak of dissolved P3HT chains in the solution) should decrease if P3HT chains nucleated on GO after GO was dipped into the finished crystallized solution. There are no obvious absorption peaks at 450 nm in Fig. S3 (ESI†); we speculate that the reason is that the aggregate degree is high. However, it can be observed that at λ ∼ 450 nm the UV-vis absorption intensity of the solution after GO physisorption decreases in comparison to that before GO physisorption, indicating that the amount of dissolved P3HT chains decreases after GO physisorption, namely some dissolved P3HT chains nucleate on GO. In order to further verify this point, the UV-vis spectra of P3HT films dropped from the finished crystallized solutions before and after GO physisorption are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Fig. S5c (ESI†) shows an example of the peak fit method used to separate out the aggregate peaks and the amorphous peak (dissolved P3HT peak). The amorphous peak area was related to the amount of the dissolved P3HT chains in the solution. Fig. S5d (ESI†) shows that the ratios of the amorphous peak area after and before absorption were below 1, verifying that the dissolved P3HT chains in the finished crystallized solution nucleate and aggregate on the GO after GO was dipped into the solution. A0–0/A0–1 of the P3HT nanofiber films dropped from the finished crystallized solution after GO physisorption is slightly higher than that before GO physisorption, verifying that the nanofibers with higher molecular order remain in the solution after GO physisorption. The concentration of the dissolved molecular chains is low with nearly no entanglements between these molecular chains in the finished crystallized P3HT solution. Thus, the formed P3HT nanofibers, which nucleated on GO, have high molecular order and then this improves the overall degree of molecular order of P3HT nanofibers in the high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. Moreover, the amount of the dissolved P3HT molecular chains in the solution decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, resulting in the amount of P3HT nanofibers nucleated on GO being low in the solution ultrasonicated for a long time. Here, with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, on one side, the molecular order of high Mw P3HT nanofibers increases. On the other side, the amount of high Mw P3HT nanofibers nucleated on GO decreases. Thus, the total amount of P3HT nanofibers of the high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, as seen in Fig. 5 and 6a.
To verify the effects of the molecular order of nanofibers on the interactions between the P3HT nanofibers and GO, we regulate the crystallization of low Mw (Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1) P3HT nanofibers by ultrasonication and investigate the interactions between different P3HT nanofibers and GO. Fig. 8 shows that low Mw P3HT forms nanofibers in the anisole:toluene mixed solvent with or without ultrasonication. The entanglement is low for the low Mw P3HT in the mixed solvent. After ultrasonicating the solution, the concentration fluctuation helps the molecular chains to nucleate and crystallize in the high-concentration region, leading to an increased amount of nanofibers formed with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time. The AFM data indicate that ultrasonication increases the amount of nanofibers of low Mw P3HT in the mixed solvent at 20 °C. This finding is in accordance with that of high Mw P3HT. GIXRD was used to investigate the crystallinity of low Mw P3HT films prepared from solutions ultrasonicated for different times, as shown in Fig. 9. In all P3HT films, a diffraction peak is observed at 2θ = 5.5°, which is the (100) lattice plane, indicating that ultrasonication cannot change the crystal form of P3HT. The crystallinity of low Mw P3HT increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time.

Fig. 10 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of low Mw P3HT films spin-coated from finished crystallized P3HT solutions. The absorption intensity of the P3HT films increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, indicating that ultrasonication improves the amount of P3HT nanofibers. This result is similar to that of high Mw P3HT films. Fig. 10b shows that the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio obtained from UV-vis spectra decreases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, contrary to the variation of the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of high Mw P3HT films. AFM, GIXRD, and UV-vis results show that for low Mw P3HT, the amount of nanofibers and the crystallinity increase, but the molecular order decreases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time. The molecular weight of P3HT affects the chain conformation and entanglement in marginal solvent. P3HT with Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1 should be comparatively less entangled than P3HT with Mw = 7.9 × 104 g mol−1 at 20 °C in the anisole:toluene mixed solvent. During the nanofiber formation, P3HT solutions display a color change from transparent orange to purple (low Mw P3HT) or crimson (high Mw P3HT). It can be observed that the solution color varies in less than 10 min for low Mw P3HT but it needs more than 1 h for the solution color variation for high Mw P3HT. The crystallization kinetics of low and high Mw P3HT in the mixed solvent at 20 °C were measured by in situ UV-vis spectra, and the results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Low Mw P3HT crystallizes much faster than high Mw P3HT despite the good solubility of low Mw P3HT in the mixed solvent. Fast crystallization kinetics and high crystallinity of low Mw P3HT indicate that the low Mw P3HT crystallizes more easily than high Mw P3HT. This finding is in accordance with that reported by Amassian's group.21 In our previous work, we found that ultrasonication accelerated the crystallization of low Mw P3HT in marginal solvent at the crystallization temperature.23 The effect of concentration fluctuation on the crystallization of P3HT is much more evident than that of disentanglement due to the lower entanglement of low Mw P3HT molecular chains. In the high-concentration region, crystallization accelerates. Fast crystallization kinetics provides the chains less time to order, giving them a low likelihood of finding the lowest energy position in the crystal. This phenomenon suggests several defects and less molecule order for nanofibers formed after ultrasonication. Thus, for low Mw P3HT, the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio decreases dramatically with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time. Moreover, due to the lower entanglement of chains, the molecular order, namely, the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio of low Mw P3HT nanofibers, is generally higher than that of high Mw P3HT nanofibers under quiescent conditions.

Fig. 11 shows the AFM height images of the low Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. The preparation method of these composites is the same as that of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. For the low Mw P3HT nanofibers crystallized under quiescent conditions, shown in Fig. 11a, nearly no nanofibers absorb onto the GO surface. In the magnified AFM image, such as in Fig. 11c, only a few short P3HT nanofibers are observed on the GO. For P3HT nanofibers ultrasonicated for 1 min, shown in Fig. 11b and d, absorbing onto the GO surface is also difficult for them, and the amount of P3HT nanofibers on the GO surface is low. Fig. 11e and f show that P3HT nanofibers crystallized in the solutions ultrasonicated for 5 min and 10 min can easily absorb onto the GO surface, and the amount of P3HT nanofibers increases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time. AFM data verify that the interactions between P3HT nanofibers and GO increase with the decrease of the molecular order of nanofibers.

Fig. 12a shows the UV-vis spectra of low Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. For the composite with P3HT nanofibers crystallized under quiescent conditions, no obvious absorption peak appears in the UV-vis spectrum, indicating that the amount of P3HT nanofibers absorbed onto the GO surface is very low, in accordance with the AFM result. For the composite with P3HT nanofibers crystallized with ultrasonication, the UV-vis curves show three absorption peaks at ∼510, ∼550, and ∼600 nm, verifying that P3HT nanofibers absorb onto the GO surface. The UV-vis absorption intensity increases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, indicating that the interactions between P3HT nanofibers and GO increase with the ultrasonication time. This result verifies that the interactions between P3HT nanofibers and GO increase with the decrease of the molecular order of nanofibers. Fig. 12b and Table S1 (ESI†) show that the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of low Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composites decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, and the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of the composite is lower compared with that of P3HT nanofibers before absorption. These findings are contrary to those of high Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO systems. The molecular order of pre-existing low Mw P3HT nanofibers does not change. The variation of the A0–0/A0–1 ratio is related to the P3HT nanofibers nucleated on GO when the GO–Si substrate is dipped into the finished crystallized P3HT solution, as shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). The nucleation effect of GO can effectively accelerate the crystallization growth rate of P3HT, giving the chains a low likelihood of finding the lowest energy position in the crystal. The molecular order of these P3HT nanofibers nucleated by GO decreases, resulting in the lower overall A0–0/A0–1 ratio of the low Mw P3HT nanofiber/GO composite compared with the nanofibers before absorption.

Conclusions
In this work, we prepared P3HT nanofibers with high and low Mw in anisole:toluene mixed solvent at 20 °C and regulated the molecular orders of P3HT nanofibers by ultrasonication. Based on the disentanglements and concentration fluctuation effects caused by ultrasonication, the molecular order of high Mw P3HT increases, but the molecular order of low Mw P3HT decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time. When these different P3HT nanofibers were absorbed onto the GO surface, the interactions between P3HT and GO increase with the decrease of the molecular order of nanofibers. With the prolongation of ultrasonication time, the amount of absorbed P3HT nanofibers decreases in high Mw P3HT/GO composites but increases in low Mw P3HT/GO composites. The dissolved P3HT chains may nucleate on the GO to form P3HT nanofibers when the GO–Si substrate was dipped into the finished crystallized P3HT solutions to prepare the P3HT nanofiber/GO composites. The molecular chain conformation and the crystallization rate of dissolved P3HT chains affect the molecular order of the following GO nucleated nanofibers. The overall molecular order of the nanofibers of the P3HT/GO composites is determined by both the absorbed nanofibers onto the GO surface and the nanofibers nucleated by GO. Compared with the P3HT nanofibers before absorption, the overall molecular order of nanofibers increases in the high Mw P3HT/GO composite but decreases in the low Mw P3HT/GO composite.
