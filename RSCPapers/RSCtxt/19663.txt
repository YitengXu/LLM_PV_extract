    First published on 13th April 2021AbstractThis work provides an overview of the recent advances in the field of two-photon absorbing chromophores active in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectral range. Herein the common strategies and main structure–property relationships that lead to near-infrared (NIR) electronic absorption of chromophores are described. A complete review of the molecules that feature two-photon absorption (2PA) beyond 1100 nm is presented for the purpose of further use in optical power limiting applications in the SWIR band. Recent progress in the development of optical power limiting in this particular spectral region is reported with emphasis on the use of the two-photon induced excited state absorption (ESA) process as an optical power limiting enhancer.

Introduction
Sixty years ago, T. Maiman fired the first laser beam of history.1 Since then, thanks to continuous development of photonics and optronics, lasers are blooming in critical sectors such as aeronautics, defence, industry and medicine. Among the numerous discoveries that followed this event, Kaiser and Garrett used this newly available powerful coherent light to prove experimentally the existence of two-photon absorption (2PA), a third order nonlinear optical (NLO) phenomenon that consists in the simultaneous absorption of two photons of the same frequency ω or different frequencies ω1 and ω2via a virtual state (Fig. 1) that was theoretically predicted in 1931 by Maria Göppert-Mayer (Fig. 2).2

Since all nonlinear optical phenomena can be only observed under very intense light irradiation, the experimental demonstration was only achieved in 1961 by observing the excited luminescence of Eu(II) ions in CaF2:Eu using Maiman's ruby laser.3 Upon irradiation at 694 nm, the blue emission of europium(II) at 425 nm is observed and its intensity is proportional to the square of the incident laser intensity, which is a characteristic signature of two-photon excited luminescence. Two years later in 1963, Peticolas and co-workers reported the TPEF of hydrocarbon crystals under ruby irradiation in a paper entitled “Double Photon Excitation in Organic Crystals”,4 which set the beginning of the design of organic chromophores for nonlinear optical applications, a currently wide and very active field of research.
Since these seminal reports, the development of NLO in general and 2PA in particular is closely related to technical laser improvements and their availability for academic or industrial researchers. The 70s and the 80s were dominated by the famous nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm. During this period, two-photon spectroscopy remained confidential and was mainly focused on inorganic semiconducting materials, atoms or small molecules; the synthetic organic chemistry community was mainly focused on the design of chromophores for second order NLO phenomena like second harmonic generation,5–8 onto which two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) could superimpose and was considered as a parasite effect.
The 1990s, with the increasing availability of femtosecond-pulsed Ti:Sapphire tunable lasers in the 700–900 nm spectral range (now extended to 700–1050 nm), marked the explosion of TPEF organic dyes under the impulsion of several researchers around the world including the groups of Belfield, Blanchard-Desce, Marder, Prasad, Van Stryland, and our group (arbitrary list established according to SciFinder), who set the molecular engineering rules for 2PA optimization.9–14 This research area was strongly stimulated by the new applications that appeared during this period, taking advantage of the intrinsic advantages of two-photon excitation: (i) its confocal character giving rise to 3D-resolution and (ii) the excitation at half energy localized in the near-infrared spectral range (NIR, ca. 700–1100 nm). In 1996, Webb and co-workers set the basis of two-photon microscopy for bio-imaging applications, a technique nowadays present in many universities and hospital imaging platforms.15–20 Several other important applications were developed during the same period including 3D microfabrication21–25 and optical data storage,26–28 two-photon photodynamic therapy29–31 or anion sensing,32 and finally optical power limiting (OPL),33–35 which consists in the nonlinear absorption of high intensity light in order to protect optical detectors.
During the last decade, tunable fs-lasers based on the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) technology became available, extending the excitation range into the short-wavelength infrared range (SWIR), from ca. 1100 nm up to 2500 nm. This technological evolution triggered the design of new organic dyes featuring optimized 2PA in this emerging spectral range, which could be used for deep bioimaging. Moreover, recent research in aeronautics and civilian transportation explored the possibility of laser assisted guiding systems thanks to active imaging and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) technologies. These new developments, in particular concerning autonomous vehicles, will be accessible in the near future to a large audience and make one fear the temporary or permanent damaging of on-board optical devices by a high intensity light beam from hostile laser sources or just from parasite reflections on environmental elements. Since the beginning of the 2000s, these security concerns stimulated the broad use of eye-safe laser sources working in the SWIR and the new search for OPL devices in this particular spectral range.
In this review, we summarize the research endeavours, mainly conducted in the last two decades, to displace the 2PA of chromophores into the SWIR and to optimize their efficiency. In Section 1, the classical molecular engineering rules governing 2PA optimization in the 700–900 nm range are recalled using selected relevant examples; in Section 2, the different strategies to shift one-photon absorption (1PA) far into the red are illustrated and the classical NIR dye families are described. In Section 3, chromophores featuring 2PA in the 1100–1700 nm range are compiled in view of their potential use for 2PA-based optical power limiting, an emerging application in this spectral range at the centre of Section 4.
1. Two-photon absorption: principles and molecular engineering rules
A detailed description of all the physics describing the two-photon absorption phenomenon is beyond the scope of this article and, since this aspect was already extensively reviewed,9–14,36,37 only a broad outline is presented here. Basically, the attenuation of a light beam of irradiance I through an isotropic medium along the z axis follows the propagation eqn (1): (1)where α1, α2 and α3 represent the linear (1PA), two-photon (2PA) and three photon (3PA) absorption coefficients, respectively. The linear absorption coefficient α1 is related to the molar extinction coefficient ε. Under very intense laser irradiation and assuming that no linear absorption occurs at the incident wavelength, nonlinear contributions can be observed and eqn (1) is generally approximated to its second term, underlining that the 2PA process is proportional to the square of the incident irradiance. At the molecular level, the 2PA cross-section, σ2PA, is related to the 2PA coefficient α2 according to relationship (2): (2)where hν is the incident photon energy (in J), N0 the molecular density, Na the Avogadro constant and C the concentration in mol L−1. σ2PA is generally expressed in Göppert-Mayer (GM, 1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s) and can be measured by several techniques, including the most popular open-aperture z-scan and two-photon excited fluorescence ones (vide infra). The 2PA cross-section is linked to the 3rd order polarizability tensor γ through eqn (3).38 (3)Then, using a perturbative approach, it was shown that this expression can be approximated by the Orr and Ward39 sum-over states relationship (4) over all excited states, where P(i,j,k,l; −ω;ω,ω,−ω) is a permutation operator, |0〉 is the ground state, and |m〉, |n〉 and |p〉 are excited states. 〈0|μi|m〉 and  correspond respectively to components μi0m and μimn of the transition dipole moment between |0〉 and |m〉 and between |m〉 and |n〉 along axis i of the molecule;  is the component of the static dipole moment difference μinn = Δμi0n along the axis. ℏωm0 is the energy E0m of the excited sate |m〉, while Γm0 is the homogeneous width associated with the state |m〉. (4)The three-level model40 allows one to express (4) for the lowest 2PA state in the case of dipolar or symmetrical molecules, respectively, according to (5): (5)where μ01 is the transition dipole moment between the ground state and the lowest excited state S1, E01 the corresponding energy transition, Γ01 the associated damping factor, fixed at a constant value, and Δμ01 the difference between the dipole moment of the ground state S0 and the excited state S1.
Expression (5) consists of three terms: (i) the negative term (N), contributing only for a one-photon resonance and being neglected for 2PA; (ii) the two-photon term (2P), related to a 2PA resonance with the excited state |2〉 and specific to centrosymmetric molecules Fig. 3, right; and (iii) the dipolar term (Dip), which cancels out for symmetrical systems and corresponds to a 2PA resonance with the lowest singlet excited state |1〉, as shown in Fig. 3, left. This expression can rationalize the role of the molecular symmetry for most of the two-photon active non-centrosymmetric dyes. A spectral overlap between the lowest linear transition and the 2PA with a half scale is observed in most cases, while, for centrosymmetric molecules, the 2PA selection rules differ from those of linear absorption and higher excited states are mostly involved (Fig. 3).

Experimentally, the 2PA cross-section can be measured using various methods, the most common ones being nonlinear transmission, open aperture z-scan, two-photon excited fluorescence and non-degenerate 2PA. The nonlinear transmission (NLT) method enables the simple recording of the transmitted light intensity as a function of the incident intensity. While this ratio is constant in the case of linear absorption, a deviation is observed for nonlinear absorption.41 This method leads to the determination of α2 and hence σ2PA using eqn (2). The principal disadvantage of this method is the difficulty to differentiate the nonlinear absorption caused by 2PA from other nonlinear phenomena such as higher multiphonic absorption and second harmonic generation or, especially when long laser pulses are used (i.e. >10−12 s), the nonlinear absorption caused by excited state reabsorption at the incident laser wavelength; these competing processes can therefore lead to high overestimations of the 2PA cross-sections.41,42
The open-aperture z-scan method is a variation of the NLT technique.9,43,44 The transmitted intensity is measured as a function of the z coordinates of a one-dimension axis from the focal point. The real and imaginary parts of the third order polarizability can be calculated separately and the σ2PA value is determined viaeqn (2). Again, much effort has to be made to differentiate 2PA from other phenomena when doing the measurement to avoid overestimated results.
Another common technique consists in measuring two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF).45,46 The experiment requires the external calibration of the fluorescence excitation spectrum using a set of references with known cross-section over the studied spectral range. The measurement gives access to the product of the fluorescence quantum yield and 2PA cross-section (Φ × σ2PA). The main disadvantage is that the method is limited to fluorescent molecules and requires a preliminary determination of the quantum yield Φ. When this Φ value is low, which is generally the case for NIR dyes, the uncertainty of this measurement can have a dramatic influence on the global precision of the σ2PA determination process.47 Moreover, it cannot be applied in a region where 1PA also occurs and solvent overtones can have an influence on the measurement.
Finally, non-degenerate 2PA (ND-2PA) is measured using a pump–probe configuration with two beams.48 The pump consists of an intense and monochromatic infrared laser beam, whereas the probe is a white-light continuum beam (WLC) of weaker intensity. This method allows the simultaneous absorption of two photons that differ in terms of energy. Since the irradiation energy from the pump is known, the analysis of the probe spectral changes gives access to the relative ND-2PA spectrum of the sample. It is worth noting that, due to the intrinsic error of the different methods used and the difficulty to differentiate all nonlinear phenomena, σ2PA values must be preferably compared when the measurement methods and conditions are the same. Nevertheless, similar trends are generally observed between the different methods.
The basic structure–property relationships in 2P-absorbing organic dyes have been previously described in the literature;9,12 thus, only a few key examples that are necessary for the general understanding of the concepts will be detailed in the following paragraphs. Like all NLO effects, 2PA is highly related to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and the design of non-centrosymmetric dipolar molecules, i.e. electron-donating (D) and electron-withdrawing (A) extremities linked by a π-conjugated bridge, was explored in the first instance (Fig. 4).33 The most common donor groups are tertiary amine, ether or thioether, whereas typical acceptors are nitro, aldehyde, cyano or trifluoromethanesulfonyl functions.12 As an example, introduction of ICT via incorporation of a dibutylamino electron-donor and a nitro acceptor function on trans-stilbene 1 drastically enhances the nonlinear optical properties of the molecule. The 2PA cross-section is increased by one order of magnitude, from 8 GM for 1 to 108 GM for dimethylamino-4′-stilbene 2, and the maximum of nonlinear absorption is shifted towards lower energies.49,50

The series 3a–b illustrates the influence of the electron-withdrawing strength of the acceptor moiety on the 2PA cross-section: replacement of a weak phosphonate acceptor with a stronger nitro function results in a significant increase of the σ2PA value from 650 GM (3a) to 1300 GM (3b), accompanied by a red-shift of the 2PA maximum wavelength.48 In both cases, the main 2PA band can be superimposed on the lower energy 1PA band with a half-energy scale, as a consequence of the non-centrosymmetry of the system. The nature of the electron-donating function also plays an important role: while compound 4b, incorporating a moderate electron-donor, exhibits 2PA of 95 GM at 880 nm, the introduction of a tertiary amine in dye 4d leads to a noticeable red-shift of the nonlinear absorption and an enhancement of the cross-section (176 GM at 1050 nm).51 Not surprisingly, the comparison between 4a–d and 4e–f shows that the lengthening of the π-conjugated backbone results in a red-shift of the electronic transitions, accompanied by a remarkable enhancement of the 2PA cross-section, up to 600 GM at 1190 nm for the extended dipole 4f.
A quadrupole corresponds to a centrosymmetric molecule which possesses two identical donor or acceptor groups linked by a π-conjugated system (generally denoted A–π–A or D–π–D), as depicted in Fig. 5 and illustrated in Fig. 6. In this particular case, the Dip component of eqn (5) is cancelled out. However, the possible resonance with an intermediary state close to half the energy of the final state, i.e. a low Δ value (see Fig. 3), leads to an enhanced value of the 2P term and a strong improvement of the 2PA performances.52 The overall molecular polarizability can be intensified by the introduction of one or several auxiliary donor or acceptor moieties within the conjugated chain. If the incorporated D or A fragment has the same electronic influence as the extremities (i.e. structures like A–π–A′–π–A or D–π–D′–π–D), the modulation of the 2PA cross-section is weak, as illustrated in Fig. 6 with quadrupoles 5 (D–π–D) and 6a (D–π–D′–π–D). For the latter compound, both the central and distal moieties are electron-donating groups, which results in a weak increase of the cross-section compared to 5, from 635 to 900 GM.49 In contrast, the 2PA efficiency is strongly increased when the electronic influence of the central group differs from the peripheral ones due to the induction of ICT, as exemplified by compound 7b, which displays a remarkably high 2PA cross-section of 1940 GM. In addition, Brédas, Marder and Perry have demonstrated that the position of the acceptor on the bridge strongly affects the linear and nonlinear absorption properties.53 Distyrylbenzene 7c, featuring cyano electron-withdrawing substituents on the vinyl bridge, exhibits a 2PA cross-section about two times lower than 7b, substituted on the central phenyl. According to quantum chemical calculations, the difference was attributed to a distortion from planarity in the ground state and a lower distance between the donor and acceptor.53 It is noteworthy that the multiplication of auxiliary fragments is a straightforward strategy for the optimization of the quadrupole 2PA cross-sections. For instance, 8 incorporates two highly electron-withdrawing extremities separated by three phenyl rings bearing auxiliary alkoxy donor functions and is characterized by an important σ2PA of 4400 GM at 975 nm.

The quadrupolar structures paved the way for the conception of branched molecules possessing no permanent dipole moment called octupoles (Fig. 5).54,55 These compounds, initially developed for second order NLO because of their non-centrosymmetry,54–56 present as well interest for 2PA. Their structures are generally composed of an electron-donating (respectively electron-withdrawing) group branched out into three parts bearing acceptor (respectively donor) identical groups. A representative example was described by Prasad and co-workers who reported the elevation of the 2PA properties on the branched trigonal chromophore 11 (Fig. 7). This octupole displays a cross-section six times higher than the related linear monomer 9 and almost three times higher than 10, which indicates that the 2PA cross-section increases faster than the number of branches.57 Such an enhancement is due to a cooperative effect and is interpreted as electronic coupling between the branches, called excitonic coupling. This strategy was widely used to enforce 2PA properties,58,59 in particular for fluorene oligomers60,61 and dendrimers.62

The nature and length of the conjugated backbone are also key parameters for the optimization of the 2PA cross-section of dipoles, quadrupoles and octupoles. In line with the previously described quadrupoles 6a–b, Marder and co-workers proved that the σ2PA values of a family of quadrupolar diphenyl polyenes 12a–d (Fig. 8) increase with the number of vinylene units within the conjugated chain, from 240 GM (12a, n = 1) to 410 GM (12d, n = 5).63 This phenomenon is enhanced when the additional conjugated units involve auxiliary electron-donating (or withdrawing) units.64 In fact, the 2PA cross-sections reported for monomer 13a and trimer 13b increase from 240 GM to 710 GM upon tripling the number of fluorene motifs, and a large enhancement is determined for tetradecamer 13c, which displays a cross-section of 6800 GM at 600 nm. However, in this last example, the angle introduced in the π system by the geometry of the nitrogen atoms can be detrimental to the delocalization and this explains the fact that the maximum 1PA and 2PA wavelengths are poorly red-shifted upon oligomerization. In fact, the position of the π-bridge connection is relevant within donor–acceptor chromophores. It was reported that meta-linked electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups result in a decrease of the electronic delocalization and less efficient ICT between the two moieties in the series of dipoles 14a–d.65 In this series, σ2PA varies from 15 GM for 14a (two meta-linked units) to 120 GM for 14d (two para-linked units).

It was reported that the replacement of triple bonds in quadrupole 15 with double bonds in compound 16 weakly influences the 2PA cross-section (Fig. 9).66 This slight effect can be explained by the decrease of the conjugation in the acetylenic derivative. The planarity of the chromophore plays an important role and can be optimized to enhance the conjugation along the π system. This phenomenon is illustrated by comparison of molecule 16, for which free torsion is allowed between the two central phenyl rings, with compound 17, incorporating a central stiffened fluorenyl moiety, or molecule 18, which has two phenyl rings maintained in the same plane. Promoting the planarity of the dyes induces noticeable increases of 2PA cross-sections, going from 1040 GM for 16 to 1260 and 1730 GM for 17 and 18, respectively.66,67

Recently, Tian, Lu and co-workers synthesized chromophores 19a–c and showed that the use of a disilanyl linker is an efficient alternative to ethynyl bridges.68 The authors show that the Si–Si σ orbitals have higher energy than the CC π orbitals, which consequently leads to improved delocalization and strongly enhanced ICT. This phenomenon is illustrated by compound 19c constituted of a tertiary amine extremity linked to an acceptor boron dipyrromethene core through disilanyl bridges which yields impressive 2PA cross-sections ca. 4.2 × 105 GM (Fig. 10). As a comparison, the analogous chromophore 19a without electron-donating groups has a reported cross-section of only 1080 GM, proving the enhancement of ICT thanks to the disilanylene bridge. However, these promising 2PA results are the only ones reported for chromophores bearing disilanylene bridges, and further study should be conducted to confirm them.

This section demonstrated the importance of molecular engineering for the optimization of the 2PA wavelength range and cross-section within the visible region. However, it is worthy of note that external parameters such as the solvent (see Section 3),69–71 the pressure72 or the temperature have also to be taken into account for the optimization of the 2PA cross-section.73,74 Theoretical38 and experimental11 structure–property relationships are nowadays well established and are effective tools for the design of chromophores exhibiting large 2PA in the 700–1050 nm range, where Ti:Sapphire lasers operate. Since the last decade, the development of OPO lasers operating in the SWIR permits one to shift the spectral range of interest beyond 1100 nm. This perspective triggered the elaboration of new red-shifted chromophores and gave an extra dimension to “old” NIR dyes exhibiting linear absorption beyond 650 nm.
2. Engineering of near-infrared chromophores
Achieving 2PA in the NIR or SWIR necessarily requires a shift of the linear absorption towards the far-red and NIR regions (beyond 700 nm). Thereby, this section aims to introduce and illustrate the classical strategies for the development of NIR absorbers. Particular attention will be focused on a few specific families of dyes, which will be further developed in Section 3 of this review, dedicated to 2PA in the SWIR.
Historically, the design of chromophores featuring red-to-NIR-absorbing properties was widely developed for applications such as textile dyeing, photocopying and laser printing.75 During the last decades, NIR dyes were also introduced as molecular materials in organic lasers,76 as panchromatic photosensitizers or non-fullerene acceptors in solar cells,77–81 or as photoemissive, photoacoustic or PDT photosensitizer probes for bioimaging and/or therapy.82–87 The energy gap between the highest and lowest occupied molecular orbitals, generally referred to as the HOMO–LUMO gap (HLG), governs the optical and electronic properties of conjugated organic molecules. Thus, the red-shift of the lowest energy transition can be tuned by molecular engineering playing on several parameters, for instance the extension of the conjugation length, the aromaticity or planarity of the system, the lowering of the bond length alternation (BLA), or the introduction of charge transfer through push–pull functions (Fig. 11). Two important reviews by Roncali88 and Wang et al.78 describe in depth these molecular engineering rules and the inescapable families of NIR dyes. Consequently, the following section aims to illustrate non-exhaustively the most common strategies to develop NIR dyes, which are also relevant for the design of efficient NIR 2P-absorbers.

Linear extension of the conjugation
A seminal strategy used to decrease the HLG of an organic molecule consists in the extension of its π-system length. A representative molecule to illustrate this approach is trans-polyacetylene for which a zero band gap is expected for infinite delocalization.89 When the chain length of 21 varies, the HLG (Eg) can be tuned from 5.7 to 1.8 eV, corresponding to a red-shift of the absorption band from 220 to 690 nm (Fig. 12). However, torsions of the chain inducing loss of planarity, together with isomerization and oxidation processes, prevent the polymer's electronic absorption from reaching higher wavelengths. To tackle these drawbacks, an alternative consists in the introduction of (hetero)aromatic units within the conjugated chain, a strategy that led to the development of conjugated polymers such as poly-p-phenylene, poly-pyrroles 22 and poly-thiophenes 23.90 Their (photo-)chemical stabilities are greatly enhanced but the absorption maximum rapidly reaches a plateau and the optical properties of an infinite polymer are most often comparable to those of oligomers containing few tens of units. Meier and co-workers empirically rationalized this phenomenon in poly-p-phenylenevinylenes 24 for which the plateau is reached for eleven repeated units (Fig. 12).91 The absorption maximum is then governed by the effective conjugation length (ECL), which is influenced by the torsion phenomenon of the double bonds and the confinement of the electronic density on the aromatic units. The most red-shifted optical properties are reached using heterocycles that feature low aromaticity and promote delocalization, such as thiophene units 23, which reaches an absorption maximum at 725 nm for an infinite polymer.

Fully planar architectures can be designed using fused aromatic moieties, exemplified in the acene series 25 or rylene series 26, widely used in organic electronics (Fig. 13).92–94 On one hand, the acenes consist of a succession of linearly fused benzene rings starting from small naphthalene and anthracene derivatives to the famous pentacene, up to hepta and nonacene.96 Obviously, the longer compounds are the most difficult to synthesize and may exhibit weaker (photo)-stability, but the absorption spectra are well structured and regularly red-shifted upon homologation, e.g. from 660 nm for pentacene 25a to about 850 nm for functionalized heptacene 25e. On the other hand, the general rylene structure consists of a succession of fused naphthalene units and can be named poly(peri-naphthalene), according to the polymer nomenclature. These molecules are highly stable and the introduction of amide extremities and lateral substituents ensures good solubility in organic or aqueous solvents, making them suitable for photonic or imaging applications.95 The very rigid structure of these compounds enables the extension of the conjugation while conserving the planarity, resulting in a 953 nm absorption maximum in the instance of four linked naphthalene units in chromophore 26.97,98 This bathochromic shift is accompanied by a hyperchromic effect, i.e. the increase of the molar extinction coefficients up to 293000 M−1 cm−1. The introduction of bulky electron-donating substituents allows additional tuning of the optical properties and the extension of the central naphthalene to tetracene moieties, as performed in molecule 27, shifts the maximum of absorption to 1050 nm.99 A recent review by Freudenberg, Bunz and co-workers compiled the important work that was achieved in the development and property screening of larger (hetero)acenes.100 It is also noteworthy that the conjugation can be extended in two-dimensions within polycyclic (hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons. The molecular design of these systems and heterocyclic nanographenes was extensively reviewed by Stępień et al. in 2017,101 and a few examples of fused NIR dyes belonging to this family are shown in Section 3.

Intramolecular charge transfer
For a given polyene chain, the HLG can be decreased by introduction of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties, resulting in the hybridization of the frontier orbitals of the π-conjugated chain together with the donor and acceptor groups. Consequently, the HOMO is destabilized and the LUMO is lowered in energy. The establishment of strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) thus implies a red-shift of the lower energy transition, generally characterized by a broad, intense and structureless absorption profile which is strongly affected by the solvent polarity.102 The magnitude of the bathochromic shift depends on the nature of the substituent as illustrated by series 28 (Fig. 14). For a given chromophore incorporating a dialkyl-amino donor group and a diphenylethylene π-conjugated bridge, the absorption is strongly red-shifted upon increasing the strength of the acceptor function, starting from 366 nm for the molecule without a terminal acceptor, up to 670 nm for the most electron-withdrawing tricyanoethylene moiety.103 Not surprisingly, the extension of the conjugated bridge will further red-shift the absorption towards the NIR as in series 29, reaching absorption beyond 800 nm upon elongation of the conjugation.104 It is noteworthy that the design of highly electron-withdrawing groups such as benzo-bis-thiadiazole allows one to shift the absorption wavelengths towards the NIR within push–pull and quadrupolar derivatives such as 30.105

Polymethine approach
Among the common strategies used to prepare NIR dyes, the polymethine approach is particularly powerful. It consists in linking two electron-donating (respectively electron-withdrawing) moieties via an odd number of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, allowing the cationic (respectively anionic) charge to be symmetrically delocalized between the two extremities. Note that polymethines can also exist as dissymmetrical structures incorporating distinct terminal groups. When the electronic contribution from each of the two terminal groups is equal, a key electronic structure called the “cyanine state” is reached, corresponding to the ideal and symmetrical delocalization of the charge along the polymethine bridge (Fig. 15). Polymethines in the cyanine state present a degenerate ground state structure, resulting in fully delocalized charge over the π-conjugated skeleton, a BLA reaching zero, and consequently a particularly sharp and exceptionally intense absorption band with a characteristic vibronic shoulder at higher energy. It is possible to further red-shift this so-called cyanine-type absorption band upon increasing the strength of the donor or acceptor end groups (indolenine, benzothiazole, pyran, tricyanofuran…) and stiffening or lengthening the conjugated bridge.106–108 However, although this ideal cyanine state is conserved until a certain π-conjugation length, the symmetry may be broken due to Peierls-type distortions for particularly long and unrigidified streptocyanines.109–112 Note that several parameters are also able to promote the stabilization of blue-shifted polyene-like (i.e. dipolar) structures, including the solvent polarity,113,114 ion-pairing effects115–119 or substitution of electron-donating moieties at the centre of the polymethine chain.120–122

The design of polymethines is a foolproof strategy to reach NIR absorption with strong extinction coefficients; thus, the chemistry and optical properties of polymethines have thrilled scientists for decades.106,123 Polymethine structures are ubiquitous in the design of red to NIR dyes, as exemplified by the famous Indocyanine Green 31, an FDA-approved cationic heptamethine which features strong absorption in the NIR, with molar extinction coefficient εmax ∼ 194000 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 16).124 The polymethine family is extremely broad and also includes anionic structures (e.g. oxonols),125–127 neutral D–A merocyanines (e.g.32),128–132 and zwitterionic squaraine (e.g.33)133–137 or croconaine (e.g.34) dyes138,139 featuring squaric or croconic acid cores, respectively. This family also encompasses related polycyclic charged systems such as the well-known fluorescein, rhodamines140 and other xanthene dyes (eosin, erythrosine, rose Bengal…) like analogous 35 and 36, featuring a fused polycyclic skeleton.141–143
 Fig. 16  Examples of NIR-absorbing polymethine structures. 
The last decade has been prolific for the design of polymethines presenting original skeletons or efficient electron-rich extremities. For instance, it was shown that the conformational restraint within polymethines is helpful to slightly red-shift the absorption while significantly improving the radiative deexcitation rate in heptamethine 37 or julolidine-based cation 38.144–146 Heterocyclic extremities such as azaazulene,147,148 indolizine,149 flavylium150–152 or xanthylium153 were also developed and demonstrated stronger abilities to red-shift the absorption compared to classical indolenium or pyridinium moieties. The flavylium and xanthylium series 39 and 40 show that NIR wavelengths are straightforwardly reached with only a trimethine-long bridge.
Boron dipyrromethene154,155 (bodipy, e.g.41156) and aza-boron dipyrromethene157,158 (aza-bodipy, e.g.42159) are rigidified monomethines incorporating a boron difluoride bridge (Fig. 17); they exhibit very similar cyanine-like absorption profiles and therefore belong to the classification of polymethine dyes. Within these two families, it is possible to induce a significant bathochromic shift up to the NIR using several approaches such as introduction of electron-donating substituents,160,161 creation of a six-membered ring by B–O chelation (e.g.43), extension of conjugation or fusion of the core (e.g.44),156,159,162–165 rigidification of the conjugated backbone by annelation,166,167 or replacement of the boron centre by a carbon atom, in recently disclosed cardipy dyes.168 According to theoretical predictions, the combination of these approaches would lead to highly red-shifted absorption, up to ca. 1000 nm for the most optimized structures.169
 Fig. 17  Examples of NIR-absorbing bodipy, aza-bodipy and pyrrolopyrrole derivatives. 
In 2007, the original boron complexes of a pyrrolopyrrole dye 45a was prepared, showing NIR absorption and a marked red-shift when replacing the fluorine ligands (45b) with phenyls on the boron atoms (45c) that is due to the steric hindrance of the BPh2 groups causing a twist of the chromophore.170,171 Later, A–D–A triads constituted of two analogues of 45b linked through a bisbenzothiazole or a cyclopentadithiophene unit showed that the absorption could be pushed further into the NIR, beyond 900 nm.172,173
Linear oligomerization strategies were reported for bodipy arrays 46, prepared via successive cross-coupling reactions and with tunable absorption depending on the number of units, up to the NIR-II domain for the hexamer (Fig. 18).174 In contrast, the rigidified oligomers 47, conveniently obtained in only two consecutive oxidative steps (i.e. oligomerization and fusion), show that the ECL is limited, an absorption plateau being almost reached ca. 950 nm for the arc-shaped octamer.175

Chromophores where a cationic charge is delocalized through an extended bidimensional structure, such as historical Malachite Green or Crystal Violet (48) (Fig. 19), can be considered as distant members of the polymethine family.176 A significant red-shift towards the NIR is achieved upon planarization of the phenyl moieties as illustrated by the fluorene derivative 49.177 In addition, the extended methylium salt series 50 exhibits absorption maxima up to 864 nm, depending on the chain length,178 and an additional bathochromic shift up to 1068 nm can be obtained using stronger electron-donating groups like ferrocenyl or dialkylamine.179,180 Note that structures analogous to Crystal Violet can be identified in dimethoxyquinacridinium cations, such as 51, which are helicenium dyes that commonly display far-red to NIR absorption.181,182

Macrocyclic approach
The elaboration of cyclic π-conjugated architectures enables reaching aromatic macrocycles with low HLG. For instance, annulene derivatives,183 composed of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, can easily reach the NIR range, as illustrated in the case of compounds 52 and 53, which possess eighteen delocalized π electrons and present absorption properties around 800 nm (Fig. 20).184 To gain stability, the most efficient strategy is to introduce various heterocycles within cyclic π-conjugated systems. Porphyrinoids, including porphyrins, phtalocyanines and other related macrocycles, are widely studied chromophores that possess eighteen π electrons delocalized through four pyrrolic units linked by (aza-)methine bridges.
 Fig. 20  Annulene rings and porphyrinoid systems. 
They are characterized by multiple absorption transitions: the intense Soret band generally found around 400 nm and Q bands in the 600–800 nm range, responsible for the far-red absorption found for series 54 and 55.75
Starting from these archetypal architectures, it is possible to shift the absorption towards the NIR in various ways, unexhaustively listed here and deeply illustrated in Section 3 of this review. First, periphery functionalization in meso or pyrrolic positions, together with the insertion of a metal in the cavity, allows one to tune the photophysical properties and shift the absorption to lower energies. Second, increasing the number of delocalized π electrons by incorporating a higher number of pyrrolic heterocycles efficiently lowers the HLG, such as in sapphyrin (5 units), amethirine (6 units), NIR-absorbing cyclo[8]pyrrole,185 or SWIR-absorbing cyclo[10]pyrrole.186 Third, the further annellation of these extended porphyrin derivatives stiffens the structure and induces an additional bathochromic shift, as illustrated by cyclo[4]naphtoindole 56 absorbing ca. 1300 nm.187 Eventually, the design of planar porphyrin tapes remarkably shifts the Q bands far into the NIR and SWIR regions. Nevertheless, when the oligomers are linked together by only one carbon–carbon bond in the meso–meso position, the conformation is twisted, nearly perpendicular between the consecutive porphyrin units. This phenomenon is illustrated by series 57 where the Q bands absorption maximum remains around 600 nm, even for a dodecamer (Fig. 21). However, if the planarity is forced by fusion of two consecutive units via intramolecular oxidative coupling,188 a spectacular bathochromic shift is obtained, up to 2800 nm for the dodecamer of series 58 (Fig. 14).189,190 These exceptional studies initiated by Osuka and co-workers have triggered the exploration of fused porphyrinoids and conjugated porphyrin arrays, notably for NLO and as molecular wires, and the numerous designs imagined by the community were reviewed in depth in 2013 and 2015.191,192

The chemistry of porphyrinoids and related macrocycles is extremely rich and it is out of the scope of this review to list exhaustively the countless approaches employed to access the many NIR-absorbing candidates. The interested reader is invited to consult the relevant reviews on the topics of N-confused porphyrins,193 heteroporphyrins,194 carbaporphyrins,195,196 expanded and contracted porphyrins,185,197–199 porphycenes,200 subporphyrins,201 bacteriochlorins202 and exotic bodipy-based macrocycles.203
Diradicals
Importantly, it was shown that radical transfer within a conjugated molecule can be as efficient as the delocalization of a charge to shift the absorption properties towards NIR wavelengths. Hydrocarbon 59, reported in 2005, presents a 1PA maximum at 746 nm due to two unpaired electrons delocalized in each extremity of the resonant aromatic centre (Fig. 22). This open-shell ground state electronic structure was evidenced through single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations that estimated a singlet diradical character γ = 0.75 for 59.204 The lengthening of the molecule with a central naphtoquinoid unit induces a bathochromic shift towards 865 nm and an increase of the 2PA, attributed to a larger diradical character (γ = 0.83) and a more spin-localized system in the case of phenalenyl 60 (see Section 3 for details).205,206 The various strategies developed to design diradicaloids were extensively reviewed in 2015 and 2018 by Wu and co-workers.207,208 Recently, original radicaloid NIR-absorbers were reported using fluorene,209,210 carbazole,211,212 bisanthene,213 diketopyrrolopyrole214,215 or diindenopyrene216 units.

Coordination complexes
Coordination complexes of nickel, palladium or platinum(II) incorporating non-innocent dithiolene ligands can adopt a square planar molecular geometry that allows electron delocalization through the whole structure.217,218 Thus, the metal and ligand frontier orbitals contribute to the optical transitions and the linear maximum absorption is localized in the NIR. Dithiolene complexes 61 (Fig. 23) can be compared to polymethines: the second oxidation degree of these complexes presents a bond length alternation close to zero and the presence of the metal in the central position induces delocalization through an odd number of atoms. The functionalization of the ligands, the variation of the metal centre and the exchange of the sulphur atom with the heavier selenium atom219 provide possibilities of fine tuning of the optical properties between 700 and 1100 nm.220,221 Another example of highly delocalized complexes includes 2,5-diaminobenzoquinonediimine, a non-innocent ligand that was used to prepare Ni(II) coordination tapes 62, featuring absorption spanning over the NIR region for the tetrameric complex.222,223 Recently, a mononuclear Pt(II) complex featuring two di-substituted quinoidal ligands showed absorption ca. 900 nm due to a unique delocalization pathway in trans fashion across the metal centre.224
 Fig. 23  NIR-absorbing coordination complexes. 
In the light of these selected examples, we illustrated that a few families of dyes absorbing in the NIR exist and that their designs rely on established strategies comparable to the one used for the enhancement of 2PA. In fact, it appears that the most used techniques to shift the optical properties are the optimization of the ICT, the stiffening of the structure and the extension of the π-conjugation, possibly through (macrocyclic) oligomerization. This section also highlighted that the electronic absorption in the NIR emerges from other particular transitions, such as Q bands in porphyrins, the cyanine state in polymethines, or delocalized radicals.
3. Dyes for two-photon absorption in the SWIR region
During the last two decades, more than a hundred examples of organic molecules possessing a 2PA maximum beyond 1100 nm were reported in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. This third section aims to provide an exhaustive compilation of these dyes, including their linear and nonlinear absorption maxima in a given solvent, the corresponding 2PA cross-sections and the measurement methods used (data compiled at the end of Section 3).
Table 1 Summary of the linear absorption (λ1PA and corresponding extinction coefficients ε, when available) and nonlinear absorption (λ2PA and corresponding cross-sections σ2PA) for the reported chromophores that show 2PA beyond 1100 nm. The solvent, rate and method used for recording the 2PA are provided so that the cross-section values can be compared with caution

Dipoles and quadrupoles
The first example of 2PA in the NIR using a dipolar chromophore was reported in 2004: a photorefractive polymer composite doped with chromophore 63 was excited at 1550 nm by a 2PA process but no molecular cross-section was recorded (Fig. 24).225 In the following year, the groups of Marder and Van Stryland have developed a family of D–D′–A′–A dipoles incorporating electron-rich pyrrole rings and moderately electron-poor thiazoles, respectively, as auxiliary donor and acceptor units along the conjugated backbone and reported the first molecular σ2PA of 1500 GM at 1440 nm for 64 (Fig. 24).226 This new dye settled the benchmark level of activity for this whole emerging field of research. The same group also published in 2007 a series of quadrupolar A–D–A dyes incorporating central thiophene (65) or pyrrole rings (66).227 Such chromophores present strong electron-withdrawing extremities and an extended π system rigidified by weakly aromatic intermediary groups, these factors being known to highly optimize the ICT. The pyrrole-containing molecule 66 exhibits narrow and intense 1PA in the 600–800 nm range; however, because of the centrosymmetry of the quadrupole, the 2PA is blue-shifted and shows a maximum cross-section of 5900 GM at 1240 nm. Moderate 2PA beyond 1100 nm was also reported for several other thiophene-containing polyenes that feature dicyanovinyl (see 4f in Fig. 4),51 pyridinium228 or quinolinium229 acceptors. Interestingly, the methylpyridinium-terminated compounds 67 and 68 depicted in Fig. 24 illustrate well the strong 2PA enhancement (a three-fold increase in this example) that occurs on going from dipolar to quadrupolar structures.

In 2010, Coe and co-workers developed two series of dipolar and bis-dipolar salts incorporating diphenylamino(phenyl) electron-donor group(s) and a strong electron-withdrawing diquaternized bipyridyl core (69 and 70) which feature 2PA in the 1000–1200 nm range.230 Elongation of the conjugation path leads to higher σ2PA values when going from 69a to 69b and 70a to 70b, whereas the lengthening of the diquaternized bridge results in a dramatic decrease of the 2PA efficiency due to the possible torsion between the two pyridinium units. Importantly, the mono-functionalized analogues 70a–d exhibit higher σ2PA values at lower energy, certainly due to the stronger electron-withdrawing character of the mono-functionalized diquat moieties compared to the bis-dipolar structures.
Several studies of the 2PA of perylene-bisdicarboximides are present in the literature; however, since these chromophores generally absorb in the green-yellow region, their nonlinear absorption is located ca. 700–800 nm. Nevertheless, Wasielewski and co-workers synthesized donor-substituted dyes and showed that the substitution in positions 1 and 7 using dialkylamino (71) or p-aminophenyl-ethynyl (72) moieties is efficient to red-shift the 1PA absorption beyond 700 nm and thus record 2PA in the NIR (Fig. 25).231 Compound 72 exhibits a cross-section of 700 GM ca. 1350 nm, which is significantly lower than the ones of the previously presented D–A–D oligophenylenevinylenes. According to the 2PA selection rules for centrosymmetric molecules, the 2PA maximum is blue-shifted compared to the S0 → S1 transition.

New generations of quadrupolar chromophores were more recently developed and introduce nitrogen- or sulphur-containing fused heterocyclic electron-donor cores. In 2017, a highly electron-rich pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole was attached to two azulenyl polyaromatic hydrocarbons to form the quadrupolar A–D–A chromophores 73 and 74 (Fig. 26).232 In contrast with the previously reported 2PA properties of pyrrolopyrroles,233 these two examples show nonlinear absorption in the SWIR due to strong ICT, with however modest 2PA cross-sections varying between 100 and 200 GM in the 1200–1600 nm range for 73. In 2020, the latest studies by Perry and Marder were dedicated to fused-ring quadrupoles introducing indacene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene electron-rich cores that show exceptionally strong 2PA due to the particularly efficient ICT.234 Consequently, while cross-sections higher than 6000 GM are measured for the smallest compounds, the most extended quadrupoles 75 and 76 present huge values reaching 14000 and 27000 GM around 1345 nm.
 Fig. 26  Quadrupoles featuring fused heterocyclic cores. 
This subsection shows that it is possible to reach impressive 2PA cross-sections with quadrupolar structures, especially if they incorporate electron-rich (fused) thiophene units. However, this approach appears to be limited by the intrinsic 2PA selection rules for centrosymmetric molecules and requires particularly extended structures, and thus synthetic efforts, to locate the 2PA maximum wavelength around 1500 nm. It is worth mentioning here that several dipolar and quadrupolar dyes incorporating benzo-bis-thiadiazole moieties show NIR absorption and are widely used for the development of several NIR-II imaging agents (with fluorescence beyond 1000 nm);87 however, their NLO properties are still to be investigated and they are expected to present 2PA in the SWIR. As an example, a series of polyenes incorporating thiophene rings, strong benzothiadiazole acceptors and chiral non-conjugated decorations was theoretically found to exhibit two-photon circular dichroism (2PCD) in the 1200–1300 nm range.235
Polymethine dyes
Polymethine dyes rapidly appeared as attractive candidates for 2PA in the SWIR due to the optimal delocalization of their π electrons along an odd number of carbon atoms. In 2008, Rebane proposed to use Styryl 9M (77, Fig. 27) as a standard for 2PA cross-section determination using the TPEF method in the NIR. This fluorescent merocyanine exhibits a maximum 2PA cross-section of 780 GM at 1240 nm, which however drops to 8.4 GM at 1550 nm.46

The 2PA of a series of symmetrical polymethine dyes was then systematically investigated by Van Stryland and co-workers (Fig. 28).236–239 Their comprehensive studies highlighted that all polymethines exhibit analogous 2PA profiles with two bands that were rationalized as follows: the lower energy 2PA band is generally weak and can be superimposed on the S0 → S1 one photon transition.240 This indicates that the transition towards the first excited state is forbidden using two-photon excitation for symmetry reasons but becomes partially allowed due to vibronic coupling, which induces symmetry breaking of the ground state electronic structure.240 The second 2PA transition is intense and blue-shifted and is assigned to a dark state, inactive in one-photon excitation, but that is fully allowed using two-photon excitation. This behaviour is well illustrated by trimethine 78a (Fig. 28) displaying two 2PA bands with cross-sections equal to 50 and 280 GM at 1030 and 664 nm, respectively. In this series, the 2PA maximum is red-shifted by about 140 nm for every two carbon atom elongation of the polymethine chain. This bathochromic shift is accompanied by a strong increase of the 2PA cross-section, which reaches 200 GM at 1310 nm for the heptamethine 78c. The best result of the series is measured in the case of heptamethine 79c incorporating indolenium extremities (σ2PA = 600 GM at 1330 nm). Quite surprisingly, the stiffening of the conjugated skeleton in 80 leads to a blue-shift of 2PA and a reduced cross-section compared to 78b. This observation is possibly explained by the reduction of vibronic phenomena due to partial cyclization of the bridge. Heptamethines 79c and 81 confirmed this tendency, with a 600 GM cross-section for the non-rigidified dye and 60 GM for the stiffened analogue. Finally, nonamethine 82 presents the most intense and red-shifted 2PA of the series, with 600 GM around 1500 nm.

Heptamethines 83–86 depicted in Fig. 29 were developed by our group for optical limiting applications at around 1500 nm (see Section 4).241,242 Surprisingly, within this series of polymethines rigidified using a tert-butylcyclohexenyl framework, no detrimental effect of the stiffening is observed, in contrast with compounds 80 and 81. The symmetrical indolenium-heptamethine 83 presents a significant 2PA cross-section of 544 GM ca. 1500 nm. The impact of ion-pairing occurring in a nonpolar solvent (toluene) between a polymethine analogue of 83 and a small bromine anion was recently investigated and reveals a slight blue-shift of the 2PA maximum and a lower σ2PA value with 310 GM at 1400 nm, mainly due to the loss of the cyanine electronic structure for a dipolar polyene-like one.119 Dissymmetrical heptamethine 84 exhibits a profound modification of its electronic structure from cyanine to dipolar upon decreasing the solvent polarity. This equilibrium implies a broadening of the 1PA spectrum, and thus this merocyanine shows broad 2PA from 1200 to 1700 nm with a maximum of 790 GM at 1445 nm. Of particular interest, the rare example of anionic polymethine 85, featuring strongly electron-withdrawing tricyanofuran end groups, displays red-shifted 1PA at 900 nm and thus important 2PA with a maximum cross-section of 890 GM at 1600 nm.126,242 It is noteworthy that various salts of anionic polymethine 85 were used as dopants in polycarbonate-based thin films for all-optical signal processing applications and demonstrated enhanced third order nonlinearities at 1550 nm in silicon-organic hybrid waveguides, compared to inorganic blends.243

A positive effect of the substitution of the polymethine bridge at the central position is observed for compound 87, studied by Achilefu, Berezin and co-workers for its potential use as a molecular probe in two-photon bioimaging experiments.244 Indeed, the 2PA cross-section around 1550 nm is nearly doubled upon introduction of a central diphenylamine substituent, by comparison with the substitution with an oxygen atom in 86. It is worthy of note that this study also reports the 2PA of Indocyanine Green 31 (see Fig. 16), with σ2PA = 590 GM at 1552 nm, and a decorated analogue 88 (Fig. 29), which also features a substantial increase of the 2PA cross-section (900 GM at the same wavelength) upon central substitution with a phenyl moiety.
Marks and Prasad reported that tictoid twisted systems such as 89a can be coupled to polymethine structures at the central position to enhance the third order nonlinear response (Fig. 30).245–247 The 2PA of cationic 91 shows a cross-section of ca. 45 GM at 1305 nm and an additional weak band at 1410 nm, which highlight a cooperative coupling effect that occurs in the dyad compared to the corresponding thiopyrylium-based heptamethine 90. It is worth underlining that the latter compound has linear absorption peaking at ca. 1040 nm, and thus it is reasonable to expect that its 2PA maximum should be located beyond 1600 nm.

The first studies of the third order nonlinear optical properties of bis-dioxaborine-containing polymethines, including 93 and 94, were reported in 2006 by Marder, Perry and co-workers for all-optical signal processing applications (Fig. 31).248 In this context, Padilha and colleagues described in 2009 D–A polymethine 92b, which shows strong solvent-dependent absorption spectra, like merocyanine 85 (Fig. 29), which confers to the compound dipolar polyene-like absorption in toluene (ε ∼ 124000 M−1 cm−1 at 712 nm) and a cyanine-like one in acetonitrile (ε ∼ 232000 M−1 cm−1 at 777 nm).249 Consequently, a strong ten-fold modulation of the cross-section is observed when measuring 2PA in toluene (4700 GM at 960 nm) or acetonitrile (10000 GM at 980 nm). However, the impact of this electronic reorganization is less pronounced for 2P transitions measured ca. 1300 nm. In 2010, Padilha, Van Stryland and co-workers extended the scope of anionic polymethines using coumarin-dioxaborine extremities in 93a–c.250 The lengthening of the conjugation path allows reaching large cross-sections with 1100 GM at 1450 nm for 93c and 2200 GM at 1600 nm for the nonamethine analogue 94. Impressively, the second two-photon band reaches impressive values, with 15000 to 17000 GM around 1100 nm within this series. The elevation of the 2PA cross-section is probably due to the extension of the end group conjugation given by the coumarin-dioxaborine extremities, as well as the ICT enforcement afforded by the terminal diethylamine donors.251,252

Van Stryland and colleagues prepared a cationic 2-azaazulene 95 featuring a strepto (i.e. unrigidified) polymethine bridge with a 2250 GM cross-section at 1800 nm in dichloromethane (Fig. 32).253 Optical measurements in acetonitrile solution show the presence of symmetric and asymmetric forms of the dye due to the symmetry breaking that occurs in polar solvent for this unstiffened polymethine chain.110,112,240 This equilibrium results in the broadening of the 1PA spectrum and a blue-shift of the lower energy transition. The authors demonstrate that, for the symmetric form, the 2PA band has a purely vibronic origin and appears at higher energy compared to the S0 → S1 transition. In the asymmetric form, 2PA becomes coincident with the main one-photon transition due to lowered symmetry related to the variation of the permanent dipole moment upon excitation.

The influence of the nature of the π-conjugated bridge was explored in alkyne-pentamethine 96, which was compared to its alkene-pentamethine analogue 97 (Fig. 33).254 Despite exhibiting large bond-length alternation, the alkyne carbocation shows characteristics analogous to cyanines, such as intense and sharp near-infrared absorption (ε ∼ 76000 M−1 cm−1 at 785 nm). However, the low-energy 2PA transition of 96 found ca. 1600 nm (σ2PA < 50 GM) is superimposed on the one-photon allowed transition. This behaviour is closer to the one of octupolar triarylmethyl cations such as Crystal Violet (see 48, Fig. 19) and Brilliant Green.60 In contrast, the alkene polymethine analogue 97 (ε ∼ 69000 M−1 cm−1 at 704 nm) has a weaker 2PA transition localized above the lowest energy 1PA band and shows 200 GM at 1300 nm.

The nonlinear absorption band of classical pentamethine 98 is compared to the related squaraine (99) and tetraone (100) dyes featuring identical conjugation length in Fig. 34.237,255 These three structures exhibit characteristic cyanine-type absorption spectra and, consequently, the lower energy 2PA band can be superimposed with the vibronic shoulder of the one-photon main transition. Both squaraine 99 and tetraone 100 have a 650 GM cross-section, but respectively localized at 1250 and 1150 nm. The 2PA of zwitterionic squaraines can be enhanced by structural modifications, as illustrated below.

The first study of the 2PA properties of polymethine squaraines beyond 1100 nm was realized in 2002 by Scherer and co-workers.256 Monomer 101 displays two 2PA bands in the NIR region: a first long wavelength and low intensity band, denoted as E2 in Fig. 35 (σ2PA = 483 GM at 1240 nm), that matches well with the shoulder of the linear maximum absorption, and a second blue-shifted band with a higher cross-section, denoted as E3 (σ2PA = 5065 GM at 898 nm). In 2012, the structure of squaraine 101 was modified to introduce terminal indole rings substituted by ethylhexyl chains.257 The study reports a lower energy 2PA band at 1160 nm exhibiting a 1490 GM cross-section, and the high stability of this dye allowed the elaboration of an organic glass that holds promise for insertion in devices operating in the SWIR. The 2PA spectra of squaraine oligomers 102a–d show an important increase of the 2PA cross-section with the unexpected disappearance of the lower energy band (E2), accompanied by the intensification, red-shift and broadening of the second band (E3), presumably due to the multiplication of vibronic side bands (Fig. 35). In 2016, the groups of Belfield and Van Stryland reported the synthesis of a star-shaped molecule 103 incorporating three squaraine units that show weak interactions together.258 Such a design results in the measurement of a high 2PA cross-section of 1000 GM at 1200 nm, which shows a three-fold enhancement of 2PA per squaraine arm (σ2PA/n ∼ 333 GM) compared to the centrosymmetric unit 104, which features 100 GM at the same wavelength.259

In 2006, Brédas, Marder, Perry and co-workers optimized the squaraine structure through the elaboration of the extended compound 105, featuring auxiliary heterocycles and electron-donating dibutylaniline end groups (Fig. 36).52 This chromophore presents cyanine-shaped linear absorption (ε ∼ 300000 M−1 cm−1 at 832 nm), a first 2PA band at 1500 nm with a 800 GM cross-section and a second more intense transition at 1100 nm (18000 GM). Following the idea of mixing high ICT and extended conjugation, Duan, Zhan and co-workers prepared a low band-gap polymer based on the squaraine and pyridopyrazine units.260 Copolymer 106 exhibits a 2PA cross-section of 2300 GM per repeated unit in a spectral range spanning from 1400 nm to 1650 nm, which is more than three times higher than the constitutive unit 107. The authors justify these results by the high degree of conjugation and the strong delocalisation within the copolymer.

The octupolar cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione 108 (Fig. 37), which is somehow reminiscent of the quadrupolar tetraone structure 100 (Fig. 34), can be seen as a tris-merocyanine dye and also displays several 2PA bands.261 The less intense 2PA transition lies at 1200 nm and is attributed to the lower energy transition S0 → S1, while the second band is blue-shifted, has a ten times higher intensity and is correlated to the S0 → S2 transition.60 The introduction of stronger electron-donor extremities such as benzothiazoles shifts the first band to lower energies but no 2PA cross-section was determined because of the limited spectral range related to the recording method.

In 2016, Lambert, Vauthey and co-workers reported the effect of exciton coupling on the 2PA of linear and branched indolenine-squaraine oligomers.262 In this series of squaraines, 109 and 110 show a batchochromic shift of the nonlinear absorption band from ca. 1200 to 1300 nm upon replacement of the oxygen atom of the squaric acid units with dicyanovinylene moieties. However, the 2PA cross-sections are estimated lower than for the squaraine trimer 104 (Fig. 35), branched via a tri-substituted phenyl ring.
As mentioned in Section 2, (aza-)bodipy dyes can be considered as rigidified monomethine analogues and their structure can be tuned to reach absorption in the 700–800 nm range. Thus, they are attractive candidates for 2PA in the 1.3–1.5 μm range and the first examples were reported simultaneously ca. 2009 by Prasad263,264 and our group265 (Fig. 38). Molecules 111, 112 and 113 exhibit strong ICT from the electron-donor extremities towards the central electron-withdrawing (aza-)bodipy core via an extended conjugation pathway. The lower energy absorption band becomes broader compared to unsubstituted (aza-)bodipy dyes as a result of the mixing between charge transfer and cyanine-like transitions.169,266 The 2PA recorded for 113 presents a relatively similar profile to that of cyanines with two transitions: a broad one spreading over the whole 1200–1600 nm range with a 600 GM cross-section at 1500 nm and a very intense one at higher energy. Due to its high solubility in organic solvents and excellent chemical and photo-stability, this compound is particularly attractive for further use in optical power limiting devices (see Section 4). As expected, reducing the strength of the donor end group in 112 results in a dramatic decrease of the 2PA efficiency. Further investigations on dissymmetric and methoxy- or carbazole-substituted (aza)-bodipys report weaker cross-sections between 1200 nm and 1450 nm, proving once again the need for strong ICT to generate consequent 2PA within this family.267–269 In 2013, comparative ZINDO and DFT calculations supported the importance of aza-bodipy core functionalization to achieve fine tuning of the linear and nonlinear optical properties.270 This theoretical study predicted that introduction of thiophene and fluorene linkers, as well as the elaboration of aza-bodipy dimers, could allow reaching cross-section maxima up to 5000 GM.

In 2019, the introduction of different electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on the aza-bodipy core was investigated at different positions to rationalize the effect of ICT on the 2PA properties.271 In Fig. 39, it can be seen that the substitution with nitrofluorenyl moieties on positions 3,5 of the aza-bodipy centre (114) results in weak 2PA corresponding to the lowest energy linear absorption. This band is attributed to a cyanine-type transition, which is two-photon forbidden. In contrast, substitution on the same position with highly electron-donating dihexylamino(dihexylfluorenyl)ethynyl moieties in 115 enables strong ICT towards the aza-bodipy core, which results in broadened and red-shifted linear absorption. The ICT is responsible for the high 2PA cross-sections measured at 1490 nm (1125 GM) and 1210 nm (3000 GM). It has been shown very recently that a combination of electron-donating dihexylaminophenylethynyl groups and strongly electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole moieties further increases the ICT with a maximum cross section of 4520 GM recorded at 1300 nm.272 Theoretical calculations unravel that the increase of the 2PA cross-section in the SWIR is due to a mixed ICT and cyanine character of the lower energy transition, while the NIR band features the strongest σ2PA and shows a pure ICT character. Upon substitution in positions 2,6 of the aza-bodipy core (116), a noticeable red-shift of the linear absorption is recorded; however, the pseudo-quadrupolar structure of the dye results in a blue-shift of the unique 2PA band compared to the corresponding 1PA transition.

This overview of polymethine derivatives points out that it is not trivial to retain important 2PA in the SWIR using such structures. The major reason is that the cyanine transition is not two-photon allowed for symmetry reasons; it is necessary to play with various parameters to achieve a high 2PA cross-section: (i) increase vibration phenomena by increasing the length of the conjugated chain (see 79a–c, Fig. 28), (ii) induce symmetry breaking (see 95, Fig. 32), (iii) increase the number of chromophore units (see Fig. 35 and 36), or (iv) introduce strong ICT (see 115 in Fig. 39).
Porphyrinoids
The wide family of porphyrinoids and related aromatic macrocycles was extensively studied for several aspects of nonlinear optics including second harmonic generation, two-photon absorption in the visible or nonlinear microscopy for bioimaging.273–277 Naturally, the first 2PA studies were performed in the classical 700–900 nm region to take benefit from the exceptionally intense Soret band. However, the Q bands localized in the far-red region also offer a great opportunity to carry out 2PA studies in the NIR spectral range. In 2003, Rebane et al. recorded the 2PA of tetraphenylporphyrin 117 between 1100 nm and 1400 nm but only a very low cross-section was measured (Fig. 40).278 Interestingly, in spite of the centrosymmetric character of the porphyrins, the 2PA band is coincident with the vibronic structure of the Q bands. Following these preliminary results, the 2PA of porphycenes 118a, a constitution isomer of porphyrin 117, was recorded at 1100 nm.279 The 2PA cross-sections of free base 118a and chelated compound 118b are comparable, with a slight increase for the Pd(II) derivative (19 GM at 1100 nm), underlining the minor effect of the metalation for this macrocycle. In 2008, Gryko and Rebane investigated corrole free-bases, which are contracted porphyrinoids, and estimated their nonlinear absorption corresponding to the Q bands within the 1040–1360 nm range, with cross-sections lower than 5 GM.280 Reports of the 2PA properties of phtalocyanines are scarce in the literature, and only a few of them were measured as standards in the NIR range, with notably a zinc tetrakis(phenylthio)phthalocyanine (13 GM at 1270 nm) and silicium naphthalocyaninedioctyloxide 119, which shows 2PA peaking at 1400 and 1280 nm with cross-sections of 35 and 48 GM, respectively.46 Note that the presence of a nonlinear optical response of dysprosium(III) and lutetium(III) bisphtalocyanines was recently observed at 1550 nm.281

In 2006, Kuciauskas and Humphrey reported that the charge transfer from the tetraphenylporphyrin ligand to the metal centre increases the nonlinear absorption.282 While no cross-section enhancement was measured for the electropolymerized film of the Co(II) complex, a one order of magnitude elevation was observed for the Fe(III) and Mn(III) ones compared to the free base. Wen and his group reported in 2003 the 2PA at 1300 nm of a solid matrix doped with Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III), Sn(II) or Pb(II) metalloporphyrins.283 This study pointed out that the influence of the nature of the central metal/metalloid ion is negligible with modest 2PA cross-sections between 26 and 77 GM at 1200 nm and 25 and 36 GM at 1350 nm, as exemplified by symmetrical indium porphyrin 120 (Fig. 41). The slight increase of the nonlinear absorption compared to 117 is explained by the presence of methoxy donor groups; however, the angle between the porphyrin core and the peripheral groups limits the establishment of effective ICT. A similar assumption can be made in the case of the Fe(III) tetrahydroxyphenyl-porphyrin derivative, which was reported to exhibit a 2PA cross-section of 82 GM at 1150 nm.284 In the same period, Drobizhev and co-workers published a complete 2PA investigation of a series of porphyrinoids, ranging from benzoporphyrins to chlorin.285 In this study, the characteristic low 2PA cross-section of the Q-band region, about 1–10 GM, was attributed to partial symmetry breaking of the excited state. Afterwards, theoretical simulations clearly underlined that introduction of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing moieties via extended conjugated linkers, in particular at the meso-position, results in the establishment of ICT and strongly increases the NIR 2PA efficiency.287–290 These concepts are illustrated by the tetra-substituted porphyrin base 121 incorporating ethynyl-linked peripheral nitrophenyl moieties as acceptors and mild alkoxy donors, which exhibits a 2PA cross-section of 70 GM at 1240 nm.291–293 Following this approach, Osuka and co-workers developed a series of azulene-based porphyrins 122–125 enabling strong ICT between the donor and acceptor extremities.286 The most efficient chromophore was the dipolar Zn(II) porphyrin 125 with a 2PA cross-section of 8030 GM at 1400 nm. Nevertheless, the A–π–A chromophore 124 shows the most red-shifted 1PA of the series and consequently 2PA peaking at 1430 nm (5490 GM). In addition, it was shown by Gryko et al. that the coupling of two porphyrins to an electron-withdrawing diketopyrrolopyrrole core in 126 results in the strong increase of the 2PA cross-section in this D–A–D architecture, with σ2PAca. 1500 GM beyond 1300 nm.294

The decoration of porphyrin with fused azulene rings proved to be useful to enrich and extend the conjugated system as shown in Ni(II) fused porphyrinoid 127, presenting an impressive bathochromic shift of 1PA (λmax reaching 1200 nm) for a monomeric structure and with a σ2PA of 7170 GM at 1310 nm (Fig. 42).295 This high σ2PA value can be explained by the NIR 2PA originating from the Soret band and not the Q bands, as illustrated by the previous examples. Indeed, the azulene-fused porphyrin 127 exhibits unusual red-shifted Soret and Q bands, respectively found at 684 and 1036 nm. The authors attribute the high 2PA to a very effective π-electron delocalization pathway through the macrocycle. In 2012, a fused quinoidal porphyrin 128 was prepared by Kim, Wu and co-workers,296 for which the extension of the conjugation leads to a reduced cross-section (510 GM at 1200 nm) compared to the previous examples.
 Fig. 42  Fused Ni(II) porphyrins showing 2PA in the SWIR region. 
Another approach to extend the electronic delocalization in porphyrinoid systems consists in the increase of the number of pyrrolic units per macrocycle. For that purpose, expanded porphyrins like pentaphyrin 129, sapphyrin 130 and isosmaragdyrin 131 were studied and present strong 2PA ca. 3000 GM between 1300 nm and 1600 nm (Fig. 43).297 Furthermore, hexaphyrins 132a-d298 and 133299 reported by Kim, Osuka and co-workers offer the possibility to monitor the impact of the aromatic or non-aromatic character of the molecule.300 Importantly, it was demonstrated that the 2PA cross-section increases when the ring is aromatic. In the case of 133, the larger central cavity allows the insertion of two Au(III) atoms and a 12700 GM 2PA cross-section is recorded at 1410 nm. Macrocycle 134 is a contracted and doubly N-confused hexaphyrin radical whose stability is ensured by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the whole structure.301 This compound shows a remarkable increase of the maximum 2PA cross-section (2100 GM at 1500 nm) compared to the uncontracted analogue N-confused hexaphyrin at the same wavelength (900 GM). This observation allowed one to foresee the strong impact of π-radical structures on the 2PA properties (vide infra). In this context, additional studies reported the formation of aromatic expanded porphyrins with a Möbius loop topology, a specific case of a non-planar conformation adopted by the Pd(II) bimetallic complex 135, featuring a 6400 GM cross section at 1440 nm.302–305In silico studies on octaphyrin theorized in 2020 that the Möbius topology led to higher second order hyperpolarisabilities, and thus higher 2PA, compared to the Hückel one.306
 Fig. 43  Pentaphyrins, hexaphyrins and octaphyrins with 2PA in the SWIR. 
Always within the porphyrin family, an alternative strategy to achieve giant 2PA cross-sections consists in the design of oligomeric architectures. Indeed, the formation of conjugated oligomers leading to an increase of the π-electron delocalization and consequently to the improvement of 2PA was already illustrated in the visible region.273 Osuka and co-workers generalized this observation in the SWIR region and demonstrated the importance of the planarity between successive porphyrin units in oligomers via the modulation of the dihedral angle (θ) that defines the relative spatial alignment of the π orbitals between the porphyrin units. To underline the direct relation between the 2PA and the dihedral angle formed between meso–meso-linked porphyrin arrays, the authors developed a series of zinc porphyrins 136a–f where this angle is controlled by the length of an aliphatic side chain linking the two macrocycles of the dimer (Fig. 44).307 This elegant study clearly evidences the increase of the 2PA cross-section with the decrease of dihedral angle θ towards planarity.
 Fig. 44  Study related to the influence of the planarity of porphyrin oligomers and the structure of fused porphyrin and corrole dimers. 
Thus, it is assumable that optimized π-conjugation is achieved for rigidified meso–meso, β–β and β′–β′ triply linked porphyrins. In 2005, a study of fused porphyrin dimers reported substantial cross-sections at 800 nm (2PA excitation of the Soret band) depending on the transition metal, showing an increase in the following order: Cu(II) (12000 GM), free base (13000 GM), Zn(II) (14000 GM) and Ni(II) (15000 GM) porphyrin dimers.308 This evolution is justified by an enhancement of the electronic delocalization over the two fused rings. In parallel, the 2PA of the Ni(II) dibenzoporphyrin dimer 137 was measured following excitation of the Q bands and revealed a larger cross-section of 15400 GM at 1260 nm.309 Doubly linked corroles 138a–b present strong interactions between the molecular orbitals of the two adjacent macrocycles that give rise to exceptionally red-shifted Q bands (λ1PA beyond 1300 nm). Thus, these compounds show considerable 2PA in the SWIR region with cross-sections below and above 4000 GM for the free base and the Zn(II) complex, respectively.310,311 Note that corrole 138a was converted to its reduced analogue (X = 3H), which shows significantly blue-shifted linear and nonlinear absorption, the 2PA maximum being found at 1400 nm (1100 GM).
In this context, optimized π-conjugation is achieved for rigidified meso-β and β-meso linked oligomers 139a–d312 or meso–meso, β–β and β′–β′ triply-linked oligomers 140a–c (Fig. 45).307 For instance, 139a and 139d are a dimer and pentamer that feature 2PA maximal cross-sections of 8000 and 41400 GM at 1400 and 2100 nm, respectively. In these families of fused oligomers, the increase of the elementary unit number n leads to a red-shift of the linear and nonlinear optical properties accompanied by a regular increase of the molar absorption coefficient and of the global 2PA cross-section, the highest value being 93000 GM for trimer 140c. It is noteworthy that the cross-section evolution per unit does not remain constant and a cooperative effect between the monomers is observed. A comparison between 139d and 140c highlights the strong enhancement of σ2PA/n, with 8280 and 23400 GM, respectively, depending on the linking pattern. However, it is relevant to underline that the 2PA measurements for such porphyrin oligomers can be overestimated because of the overlap of the 2PA and the Q band 1PA at ca. 1200 nm. To overcome such uncertainty, the 2PA cross-sections of 140b and 140c were measured at 2300 nm, still giving the largest values measured at this wavelength, with 18500 and 41200 GM, respectively.313 This approach was also undertaken for the 2D-extended porphyrins trimer 141 and tetramer 142, which present cross-sections of 8700 and 35700 GM at 2300 nm, where there is no contribution from 1PA. These values highlight that the 2D extension of the delocalization in porphyrin arrays is not a pledge of larger 2PA and the authors underline that the molecular polarizability is the important parameter to consider for increasing the cross-sections.
 Fig. 45  Fused porphyrin oligomers with 2PA in the SWIR. 
Surprisingly, the tetrameric porphyrin sheet 143 shows only a cross-section of 2750 GM at 1600 nm, which is a rather modest value compared to the linear and 2D tetramers 140c and 142.314 The authors suggested that the delocalization pattern was significantly different within these two architectures. The reader interested in a deeper analysis and comparison of the 2PA of porphyrin arrays is invited to consult the complete review by Osuka, Kim and co-authors published in 2008.274
Rebane and co-workers synthesized the original supramolecular ladder-shaped porphyrin oligomers 144a–c, obtained from the association of two diethynyl-porphyrin oligomers and 4,4′-bipyridine linkers (Fig. 46).315 Compared to the single-strand arrays, the peak cross-section per macrocycle (σ2PA/n) is magnified by the ladder structure, and reaches σ2PA/n = 8900 GM at 1325 nm for 144c, whereas the non-organised oligomer does not exceed 6400 GM per unit at 980 nm. The measured effective cross-sections are impressive; nevertheless, the use of such supramolecular assemblies remains challenging for the elaboration of materials. Porphyrins were also used in conjunction with other dyes within alternating conjugated oligomers. As an example, the 2PA values of the alternating Zn(II) porphyrin–perylene diimide 146316,317 or zinc porphyrin-dithienocoronene diimide in oligomers 147318 are larger than that reached with the pure meso–meso-linked lead porphyrin polymer 145.319 Regarding the 2PA cross-section per repeated unit, these values are some of the highest measured in the 1300–1600 nm spectral range, with σ2PA/n reaching ca. 7800 GM at 1520 nm for 146 and 147.

Smaller porphyrin structures were designed so that the lowest energetic transitions (Q bands) can overlap with the electronic absorption transition of a second dye, enabling additional electronic coupling in a hybrid conjugated form of these two compounds. For instance, Zn(II) bisporphyrin 148, linked via a squaraine unit, shows a 2PA cross-section superior to 780 GM through the 900–1600 nm range, unlike the constitutive porphyrin or squaraine, which exhibit σ2PA values inferior to 100 GM beyond 900 nm (Fig. 47).320 This effect is mainly due to the superimposition of several allowed two-photon transitions. In the case of 149, the positive charge is delocalized along the molecule and 2PA reaches 3100 GM at 1550 nm.321 The conjugated bridge differs from classical cyanines since the double bonds are replaced with triple bonds, yielding better electronic coupling between the two porphyrins and avoiding possible torsions.

Besides their limited synthetic availability, porphyrinoid derivatives appear to be the most promising candidates for 2PA in the NIR/SWIR since they offer multiple possibilities of structural optimisation to enhance the 2PA cross-sections, including (i) the introduction of ICT, (ii) the extension of conjugation via fusion strategies, and (iii) the design of oligomers introducing other NIR-absorbing dyes. So far, the tetrameric array 140c and polymers 144–147 hold the records of the highest 2PA cross-sections in the SWIR region.
Diradicals
Singlet diradicals322 are molecular species of particular interest for 2PA. Their diradical character γ, an index falling between 0 and 1 and extracted from theoretical calculations, directly impacts their third order nonlinear response.323–325 In 2007, the first 2PA properties of two stable open-shell singlet diradicals were reported in the SWIR. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 59 and 60 (Fig. 22) are not substituted by either donor or acceptor moieties but present a stable diradical form and feature exceptionally strong 2PA cross-sections compared to typical hydrocarbon chromophores, up to 850 GM at 1500 nm for 60.204–206 A comparable 2PA efficiency of 760 GM is measured for less rigid tetrabenzo-Chichibabin hydrocarbon 150 at shorter wavelengths (Fig. 48).326 In heptazethrene 151 and octazethrene 152, the most reactive sites can be blocked by the insertion of triisopropylsilylacetylene groups, enhancing the stability of the diradical form.327 These Z-shaped chromophores present closed-shell (γ = 0.16) and open-shell (γ = 0.43) structures, respectively, and 2PA comparison shows an enhancement of the cross-section increasing from 920 to 1200 GM going from molecule 151 to 152. The impact of the singlet diradical character is more striking in the instance of dibenzoheptazethrene isomers 153 and 154.328 This combined experimental-theoretical study reports that compound 154 has a marked diradical character (γ ca. 0.58) due to the stabilization of a five aromatic sextet ring structure, and thus presents a remarkable increase of the 2PA cross-section, with 2800 GM at 1600 nm. This tendency was later on confirmed in more simple and unsubstituted dibenzozethrene derivative 155, which presents 2PA around 1200 nm with cross-sections as high as 1770 GM.329 Note that a quarteranthene hydrocarbon, whose structure is closely related to zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons, exhibited weak but unquantified 2PA lying between 1600 and 2400 nm.330

A series of bisindeno-thienoacenes 156–158 was reported in 2014 as antiaromatic species featuring a null to small singlet diradical character (Fig. 49).331 Interestingly, due to the different fusion pattern, both 156 and 158 have red-shifted 1PA (λmaxca. 685 nm) compared to 157 (λmax = 606 nm). In consequence, the 2PA maxima are found at 1200 nm (420 GM) for 157 and at 1400 nm for 156 and 158, with moderate cross-sections of 340 and 520 GM, respectively.

The series of p-quinodimethane derivatives 159a–f332 reported by Wu, Kim and co-workers is particularly interesting: while the monomer 159a is a closed shell quinoidal compound, singlet biradical structures are found for the dimer 159b (γ = 0.85), trimer 159c (γ = 0.99) or tetramer 159d (γ = 0.99), and higher oligomers 159e–f are triplet biradicals (Fig. 50). On one hand, monomer 159a (λmax = 626 nm) exhibits an inherent large 1300 GM 2PA cross-section at 1200 nm, which the authors explain by a contribution of the quinoidal electronic structure, which may generate high hyperpolarisabilities.296 On the other hand, varying the length of the oligomers leads to a red-shift of the one-photon lowest energy transition (λmax between 900 and 930 nm), shifting the 2PA into the 1650–2100 nm region, with however a σ2PA of 1060, 770, 710, 730 and 710 GM for chromophores 159b–f, respectively. Such results may suggest that large 2PA is favoured when the biradical indices have intermediate values, i.e. when the species do not have pure closed- or open-shell character.

Analogous dipolar structures 160a–c were prepared by linking a benzo-1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene donor to a dicyanomethylene acceptor through one or several N-annulated perylene-quinodimethane units (Fig. 51).333 In addition to the expected closed-open shell equilibrium, these push–pull dyes may be stabilized in a zwitterionic structure in polar solvents, especially in the case of the smallest oligomer. However, the 2PA properties show similar tendencies to the pull–pull series, with the exception that slight decreases of the maximum cross-sections are observed upon increasing the solvent polarity, e.g. from 1300 GM in toluene to ca. 900 GM in DCM/DMSO for 160a.

In 2015, Kim and Würthner isolated a stable perylene diimide derivative 161via the chemical oxidation of the corresponding dianion (Fig. 52).334 This species is a stable diradical with a half-life ca. 54 hours in solution and shows a moderate σ2PA of 350 GM at 1550 nm. In 2012, a comparative 2PA study was achieved between the bis-acridinium singlet diradicaloid 162a (γ = 0.682) and its closed-shell counterpart 162b (γ = 0) having the exact same atom composition and backbone structure.335 At 1200 nm, the diradicaloid dimer exhibits a 3600 GM 2PA cross-section, whereas the closed-shell equivalent obtained via chemical reduction presents a very small value of 10 GM. In 2016, Kim and Wu reported two bodipy-based fused dimers 163 and 164 that feature linear absorption around 1100 nm.336 It was found that the structural isomerization, using p- or m-quinodimethane bridges, influenced strongly the diradical character and the optical properties of the bodipys. Despite their moderate diradical character, 163 and 164 feature large 2PA at 2200 and 2300 nm, with a σ2PA of 1300 and 1500 GM, respectively.

In 2013, Shi, Kim, Wu and co-workers designed an elegant bis-porphyrin structure built around a p-quinodimethane bridge (165) that shows extended conjugation over the two units due to a closed-shell ground-state (Fig. 53).337 Consequently, its linear absorption is red-shifted at 955 nm compared to the keto-bridged p-phenylene dimers 166a–c (λmax between 800 and 920 nm), and its 2PA reaches 2080 GM at 1800 nm. Series 166a–c exhibits lower cross-sections that strongly depend on the transition metal incorporated. While the Ni(II) porphyrin shows a σ2PA of 650 GM at 1500 nm, the Zn(II) and Mg(II) ones are characterized by cross-sections ca. 1500–1600 GM at 1800 nm. In 2019, the porphyrin dimers were modified to introduce 2,6- or 1,5-naphtoquinodimethane bridges in 167 and 168.338 Both compounds have open-shell structures, nevertheless the high diradical index of 168 (γ = 0.77) leads to moderate 2PA at 1600 nm (1750 GM), whereas dimer 167, with an inbetween γ value of 0.5, has a two-fold larger cross-section of 3500 GM.

Metal complexes
The 2PA properties of NIR-absorbing metal complexes have scarcely been investigated and only two examples with 2PA beyond 1100 nm are described here. Large 2PA was reported in the literature for the NIR-absorbing nickel(II) bis(dithiolene) 169, a square-planar and centrosymmetric coordination complex with electron-donor extremities that exhibits 5300 GM at 1200 nm (Fig. 54).339 The lowest energy transition was attributed to a metal centred d–d transition. In addition, the organometallic diruthenium(II) complex 170 possesses weak 2PA with 133 GM at 1408 nm.242 Its conjugated structure involves the full delocalization of a cationic charge through a seven carbon unsaturated bridge; thus, the species displays broad and intense absorption (ε764 = 109000 M−1 cm−1 in CH2Cl2),340 and can be therefore considered as an organometallic polymethine.

Numerous structures were presented exhibiting efficient 2PA in the SWIR region (see the summary in Table 1); however, the range of available chromophores is still limited and many molecular structures can be envisaged in the future, including the new generations of NIR-absorbers developed for photovoltaic and bio-imaging applications. 2PA cross-section optimization is necessary to elaborate effective materials, but additional factors have to be taken into account for further applications: the stability and appropriate solubility and processability of the species, as well as simple and flexible synthetic methods allowing large-scale production. In the last section, we will focus on the application of SWIR nonlinear absorbers for optical power limiting.
4. Optical power liming in the SWIR band
Due to the serious danger for human eyes that Nd:YAG based systems represent,341 these laser sources tend to be replaced by eye-safe lasers operating around 1550 nm (Fig. 55), which facilitates the use of optronic systems in new fields. Indeed, recent research on autonomous vehicles is studying the possibility to use eye-safe laser systems for on-board LIDAR to determine their position in real time. This particular wavelength is also of great interest for defence applications as it is located in the transparency window of the atmosphere (Fig. 55), and is also less impacted by perturbations such as clouds, fog or smoke, which makes it particularly useful for active imaging applications, guiding systems or telemetry. The switching of optronic systems at this new wavelength does not remove the need for optical power limiting (OPL) devices as on-board detectors need to be protected from potentially dangerous radiation. Even for civilian applications where hostile radiation could be excluded, there is still a risk of potential jamming or destruction of the detectors from self-irradiation caused by laser beam reflections, for example on road-signs or other reflective surfaces present in our daily life.

To answer this particular challenge, the OPL device must fulfil some essential requirements (Fig. 56):343 (i) the highest transmission below the critical threshold intensity, (ii) maximum transmission (Imax) inferior to the detector damage threshold, (iii) a fast and auto-activated response, (iv) activity over the broadest spectral and temporal range, (vi) the ability to stay active at an input intensity far greater than the threshold intensity, and finally (vi) full reversibility of the OPL process. Several photophysical processes are known to produce OPL effects, namely multiphoton absorption, reverse saturable absorption, nonlinear refraction and nonlinear scattering. In 2016, Dini, Calvete and Hanack wrote a very complete review344 listing the molecular optical limiting systems utilizing all the different phenomena listed above for the visible-NIR range and the reader is invited to read this reference article for exhaustive information.
 Fig. 56  Principle of optical power limiting. Two representations are mostly used in the literature: transmitted vs. incident intensity (or fluence, top) and transmittance vs incident intensity (or fluence, on a log scale, bottom). 
Among all OPL processes, multiphoton absorption – and particularly 2PA – based OPL systems show many advantages compared to others as they present: (i) negligible linear attenuation with nearly complete transmission for low intensity incident energy, (ii) an auto-activated and instantaneous response to higher energy of the input laser signal, and (iii) no saturation phenomenon. In addition, multiphoton absorption-based OPL devices rely on a molecular process and therefore the active dye has to be stable enough to overcome high light intensities and must exhibit good solubility in organic media since OPL experiments require high concentrations (ca. 0.1 M). Consequently, large amounts of dyes are generally required and ideally their synthesis would present good overall yields with a limited number of steps. The following paragraph will be only focused on multiphoton absorption-based OPL in the SWIR range.
Three-photon based OPL
The first examples of SWIR OPL were based on three-photon absorption (3PA) as this technique permitted one to use dyes that were initially developed for 2PA in the NIR and valorise them for 3PA in the SWIR. The three-photon absorption phenomenon needs very high photon flux to occur, several orders of magnitude higher than for 2PA, and consequently generally requires the use of ultra-short laser pulses (10−15–10−12 s).
Prasad and co-workers described among the first examples of 3PA-based OPL devices above 1064 nm using dipolar chromophores 171, 172345 and 173346 (Fig. 57) absorbing in the visible spectral range (λmax = 394, 400 and 510 nm, respectively, recorded in chloroform for compound 171 and 172 and in benzyl alcohol for compound 173). As explained above, it is possible to trigger 3PA in the SWIR band for this type of dye using femtosecond laser pulses, which therefore induce an OPL behaviour at 1300 nm, as illustrated in Fig. 57. The maximum 3PA cross-section for these dyes is obtained for 171 (σ3PA = 3.75 × 10−25 cm6 GW−2 at 1260 nm), but the maximum OPL efficiency is obtained for 173. In fact, if this very simple liquid dye shows a lower 3PA cross-section, its fluid form and high miscibility with benzyl alcohol permitted one to reach concentrations as high as 1 M, which resulted in a high 3PA coefficient (α3 = 1.6 × 10−5 cm3 GW−2 at 1300 nm) and consequently a better OPL behaviour.

Quickly after, the same group reported the 3PA OPL behaviour of a series of branched chromophores (Fig. 58).347–350 In this context, the series 174–176, based on fused fluorene moieties, proved the efficiency of cooperative enhancement observed for octupolar chromophores in order to increase 3PA and consequently give OPL performances with a reported α3 = 4.3 × 10−6 cm3 GW−2 at 1310 nm for 176 (Fig. 59).347 Satisfactory OPL performances were also recorded for similar quadrupolar and octupolar compounds 177348 and 178.350 Using this approach, the best OPL performances based on 3P-absorbers were reported by Cui et al., with 179,349 a dye originally described by Prasad et al. for 2PA around 800 nm.57 For this octupole, a 3PA cross-section σ3PA = 2.16 × 1023 cm6 GW−2 and a 3PA coefficient of α3 = 1.6 × 10−4 cm3 GW−2 at 1250 nm were reported (Fig. 58 and Table 2). However, comparisons must be made with extreme caution, as different measurement methods were used to obtain α3 values. Finally, it is worth noting that CdSe quantum dots were described for OPL based on 3PA for femtosecond pulses at 1300 nm.339

As demonstrated above, it is possible to turn a 2PA based OPL in the NIR into a 3PA based OPL in the SWIR, taking advantage of the great number of 2P-absorbers described for NIR applications. However, these devices can only be efficient by using femtosecond lasers, producing a sufficient amount of instantaneous light intensity to trigger the 3PA process. Nowadays, lasers used for LIDAR systems and active imaging are based on nanosecond lasers whose pulse widths are too long to trigger such a 3PA process, hence prohibiting the use of such 3PA-based OPL devices. It is therefore necessary to switch to 2PA-based OPL systems using 2P-absorbers in the SWIR, as described in Section 3.
Two-photon based OPL in the SWIR range
The first example of a 2PA based optical limiting system working in the SWIR band was reported by Prasad and co-workers in 2007, not from organic dyes, but using CdTe quantum dots.351 80% attenuation was measured for an incident intensity of 10 μJ at 1300 nm. However, the measured 2PA coefficient was quite low with a reported value of α2 = 0.02 cm GW−1. Concerning organic dyes, the same group reported in 2009 the OPL characteristics of the bodipy derivative 111 (Fig. 38) at 1310 nm and used it to reduce laser pulse fluctuations (Fig. 60).264 This compound is of first importance because of the possible introduction of various functions at the meso position for further elaboration of a device. Nevertheless, no optimization of the 2PA properties was carried out for this dye family and 111 presents a 2PA coefficient of only 0.06 cm GW−1. It is worth mentioning that for these two examples all OPL measurements were reported only with femtosecond laser pulses and not nanosecond pulses, as used in real applications.

All the examples reported in the literature that will be described hereafter were developed for nanosecond laser pulses. With such a pulse duration, multiphoton absorption is hardly ever the only photophysical phenomenon contributing to the transmission loss observed in OPL experiments. To fully describe and explain the OPL performances, all photophysical processes must be decorrelated to provide some insights into the importance of each parameter and guide further dye development.
As already observed in the visible spectral range,344 the most common mechanism explaining the OPL behaviour for nanosecond pulses in the SWIR range is a stepwise three-photon absorption process: 2PA followed by 2PA induced excited-state absorption (ESA). In fact, in the case of a nanosecond pulsed laser, reabsorption from an excited state is temporally possible and this additional absorption process generally enhances the whole optical limiting effect.35,352,353 A common model to represent the 2PA induced ESA mechanism is depicted in Fig. 61 where ESA occurs from the lowest excited singlet state (S1) towards a higher singlet state (Sn), or after intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) from the lowest excited triplet state (T1) towards a higher triplet excited state (Tn). It is however possible to observe some ESA from a singlet excited state of higher energy before relaxation to S1.319 It is important to note that both processes occur during the same laser pulse (ns), and consequently at the same wavelength, and thus the best OPL systems will be obviously obtained with the joint optimization of the efficiency and spectral overlap of the two processes,354 which is extremely challenging.

The combination of 2PA and ESA processes in the SWIR range and more specifically at 1550 nm was nicely highlighted by Perry and co-workers with a lead(II) porphyrin polymer 145 (Fig. 46).319 This material presents very effective OPL behaviour in solution with 40% transmission for an incident energy of 50 μJ at 1550 nm (Fig. 62). The detailed transient absorption experiment carried out between 1000 and 1600 nm allows identifying the different excited states involved in the ESA process and clearly shows the importance of the 2PA and ESA spectral overlap for reaching high OPL efficiency.

In this context, our group studied polymethines dyes for their OPL properties using nanosecond pulses. In 2007, heptamethines 83, 84 and 86 (Fig. 29),241 together with closely related compounds, allowed measurement of the OPL properties at ∼1500 nm (Fig. 63) thanks to the exceptionally high solubility of the dyes (a high concentration in DCM was reached up to 320 g L−1). 50% transmission was obtained within a 7–10 J cm−2 fluence range depending on the dye used. Once again, the importance of ESA was highlighted by the difference between the simulated pure 2PA OPL and the experimental data (respectively blue and green lines, Fig. 63).

Later on, an analogue heptamethine structure was decorated with 2,2-bis(methylol)propionic acid dendrons, which help in reducing possible aggregation and interaction between chromophores without deterioration of the OPL properties.355 The efficiency of 2PA induced ESA for OPL was also further studied on cationic 83, anionic 85 (Fig. 29) and organometallic polymethine 170 (Fig. 54).356 The latter compound, despite having a significantly smaller 2PA cross-section, exhibits the best OPL efficiency thanks to higher ESA at the wavelength of interest, 1500 nm (Fig. 64). Nevertheless, such OPL results appear to be less satisfactory than the previously studied cyanine with a maximum attenuation of around 30% at the maximum input fluence of 2 J cm−2.

Aza-bodipy dyes were also studied by our group in the 1300–1600 nm spectral range.265 For example, dye 113 (Fig. 38) produced laser beam attenuation up to 60% at 1350 nm for a fluence of 7 J cm−2 (Fig. 65). This chromophore presents OPL characteristics similar to that of the best cyanines and this result opened the way to fine chemical engineering of this family to optimize their NLO properties, since aza-bodipys have the great advantage to present several positions for possible substitutions to optimise their photophysical properties.

In a recent study, we reported the OPL, 2PA and ESA properties over the 1300–1600 nm region of a series of aza-bodipys functionalized with strong electron-donating substituents.271 In concentrated solution and under 1400 nm ns-laser irradiation, compounds 113, 115, 180 and 181 are efficient optical limiters, with 50% transmission obtained with compound 181 at an input fluence of only 2 J cm−2, while showing good linear transmission (>90%) at low fluences (<0.2 J cm−2, Fig. 66). In addition, the tetra-functionalized aza-bodipy 181 presents broadband OPL over the whole 1200–1600 nm range.

Excellent maximum attenuations ca. 60% and 80% were recorded for fluences of 1.6 and 5.2 J cm−2, respectively. These results were also rationalized by the adequate spectral overlap between 2PA and ESA for compound 181 revealed by ultrafast transient absorption experiments.
The remarkable chemical stability of the aza-bodipy family enabled the design of the first solid-state material for OPL in the SWIR by introduction of these dyes as dopants in sol–gel monolithic matrixes in 2014, using dye 113. Unfortunately, the doping ratio was limited to 8 wt% due to the modest compatibility of the dye with the matrix.357 Solid state OPL performances using aza-bodipys were further improved with class-II sol–gel materials where the covalent grafting of dye 182 permitted a great increase of the maximum dye concentration in the matrix up to 40 wt%, resulting in strong enhancement of the OPL performances, with 50% transmission reached for an input fluence of 5 J cm−2 (Fig. 67).358

Concluding remarks
Sixty years after the discovery of the laser and the experimental proof of 2PA, chemists and physicists have been working together to design, engineer and produce a tremendous amount of two-photon absorbing dyes whose absorption is continuously drifting toward the red, NIR and SWIR spectral ranges. The introduction of “eye-safe” laser sources contributed to a regain of interest for 2PA dyes absorbing in the SWIR and renewed the challenge for synthetic chemists. In this review, a huge diversity of dyes has been described with 2PA cross-sections spanning from a few tens to tens of thousand GM in this particular spectral range. Yet optimization is still to be done to find chromophores that not only present high 2PA cross-sections but also fulfil the entire set of requirements for practical photonic applications in the SWIR.
As usually observed, extension of the spectral range of lasers generally triggered simultaneously the development of new materials to protect related detectors or human eyes. That is the reason why OPL in the SWIR was the first application developed during this last decade. These studies were initially stimulated by applications in defence aeronautics, where LIDAR telemetry in the SWIR was developed, but find nowadays a new perspectives for civil applications in guiding systems of autonomous vehicles. The challenges for scientists to prepare efficient 2PA-based OPL devices are multiple: (i) from a synthetic point of view, it requires one to build highly concentrated, perfectly homogenous materials featuring both photochemical and mechanical stability to be polished and incorporated in an optical set-up subject to high intensity laser radiation; and (ii) from a fundamental point of view, it has been demonstrated that 2PA induced ESA is an extremely straightforward process to optimize the OPL efficiency of the material. However, whereas chemists are capable today of designing dyes with high 2PA cross-sections following the engineering rules described in the literature, it is still challenging to control the efficiency and the spectral position of ESA. Dye engineering rules for ESA are still to be found, from the visible to the SWIR, and advances in this field could lead to a breakthrough in the future for OPL in the SWIR.
From a long-term perspective, the SWIR range presents exceptional potentialities in terms of transparency (and scattering) of the atmosphere, silica or biological media that will offer numerous opportunities for other types of applications in materials science and biology. As an example, the design of luminescent molecular probes for deep imaging in the second transparency window (NIR-II region) for biphotonic microscopy imaging in the SWIR244 is an emerging field of research that will require optimization of the two-photon brightness, which is the product of the two-photon cross-section in the SWIR and the emission quantum yield in the NIR. Another example concerns the development of 2PA-based photochemistry in this spectral range, as illustrated by recent photopolymerization at telecommunications wavelength,359,360 but many other applications can be envisaged. All these perspectives will encourage chemists to design new molecules combining 2PA in the SWIR with other properties (emission, ESA, electron transfer…) and further take into account all the constraints for the targeted application (solubility in biological medium or organic solvents, stability, functionalisation for bio-conjugation or grafting…).
Finally, if this last decade started the exploration of 2PA in the SWIR, one can clearly anticipate for the next decade a rapid development of advanced molecules for innovative and surprising applications in this spectral domain where a lot remains to be discovered.

Simon Pascal
	Simon Pascal studied molecular chemistry at the University of Rennes, and then obtained his PhD in 2014 at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Lyon, developing polymethine dyes for nonlinear optics, under the direction of Dr C. Andraud and Dr O. Maury. After a postdoctoral stay at the University of Geneva, investigating cationic helicenes with Prof. J. Lacour, he was appointed Chargé de Recherche CNRS in 2016 at the Interdisciplinary Centre of Nanoscience in Marseille (CINaM) in the team of Dr O. Siri, where he is exploring the chemistry of colourful quinones and macrocycles.

Sylvain David
	Sylvain David studied organic chemistry and chemical engineering at Ecole Centrale in Marseille and University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He then graduated from his PhD in 2020 at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon where he worked on an industrial project conducted by Thales LAS company under the supervision of Dr C. Andraud and G. Berginc. His research project focused on the design of aza-bodipy based optical power limiting devices.

Chantal Andraud
	Chantal Andraud obtained a first PhD at the University of Clermont-Ferrand on spectroscopic properties of lanthanide fluorides in the KY3F10 matrix and a second one at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris on spectroscopic studies of lead defects in a unilamellar inorganic system, during which she was appointed as Chargée de Recherche in CNRS in 1983. She moved to the Laboratory of Chemistry of Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon in 1990, where she was appointed as Directeur de Recherche in CNRS, and where she created the team “Chemistry for Optics”. She has been at the head of the Laboratory for ten years. She develops molecular engineering, particularly in the NIR, for different photoinduced effects, and particularly in the field of nonlinear optics, such as multiphoton absorption, for various applications in telecommunications, defense and biology.

Olivier Maury
	Olivier Maury graduated from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Paris in 1993 and obtained a master's degree in inorganic and physical chemistry. He completed his PhD in 1997 under the supervision of Dr M. Ephritikhine in Paris on low-valent uranium organometallic chemistry. After a post-doctoral position with Dr J.-M. Basset in Lyon in organometallic supported catalysis, he got a CNRS position as Chargé de Recherche in 1999 at the University of Rennes in the group of Dr H. Le Bozec where he started exploring the nonlinear optical properties of lanthanide complexes. In 2004 he moved to the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon in the team of Dr C. Andraud. His current research interests concern the design of lanthanide containing molecular materials and NIR chromophores with optimized spectroscopic properties towards optical limiting purposes, biological imaging, protein crystallization and photodynamic therapy applications.
