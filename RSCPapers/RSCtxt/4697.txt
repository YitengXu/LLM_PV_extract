    , Accepted 15th December 2015First published on 16th December 2015AbstractIn this work, highly conductive, optically transparent and low work-function hydrogen-doped boron-doped ZnO (BZO:H) cathode electrodes were prepared by a hydrogen post annealing treatment of the as-deposited boron-doped ZnO (BZO) samples. It was found that hydrogen post annealing at temperatures around 200 °C resulted in the formation of electrode materials which exhibited higher conductivity and carrier concentration, reduced sheet resistance and significantly increased optical transparency compared with their non-annealed BZO counterparts. In addition, hydrogen incorporation in the material lattice caused a significant reduction in their work function which may be beneficial for device operation. As a result, polymer solar cells using BZO:H films as transparent cathode electrodes exhibited higher efficiencies compared to those obtained for devices using the non-annealed counterparts. In particular, devices based on the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) system as the photoactive layer exhibited a PCE of 3.90%, whereas those based on the poly[(9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT):PC71BM and poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):PC71BM as the active components reached high PCE values of 5.90 and 7.25%, respectively, which are comparable or even higher than reported efficiencies obtained for devices using doped ZnO-based transparent electrodes.
1. Introduction
Growing concerns about global warming demands the expansion of renewable energy sources as viable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based technologies. This could explain the increasing amount of research devoted to new types of solar energy conversion devices, such as those based on semiconducting polymers, which fall into the category of polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–4 To date, organic solar cells based on interpenetrating networks of low bandgap polymer-donors and fullerene acceptors have exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 9% for single-junction PSCs5–8 and 11% for tandem-junction cells consisting of stacks of individual cells with complementary absorption.9–12 However, to promote the PSCs in the viable applications, further enhancements in the efficiency are urgently required. Besides the design and synthesis of low-bandgap polymer materials with higher absorption efficiencies and charge mobilities13,14 and/or the interface modification by using suitable interfacial layers for efficient charge collection by the electrodes15–18 replacing the conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) with alternative transparent conducting electrodes remains one of the major challenges for single-junction and tandem PSCs. These electrode materials should be highly conductive and optically transparent; moreover, they should also be low cost and enable new attractive features.
Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films have been extensively applied to optoelectronic devices,18 chemical sensors,19 and solar cells.20 Doped zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films, in particular, have been investigated as promising transparent conducting layers for photovoltaic devices as an alternative to indium tin oxide thin films because the impurity doping significantly improves the electrical and optical properties of these films.21 The group III elements, such as boron (B),22 aluminum (Al),23 gallium (Ga),24 and indium (In)25 have been intensively investigated for the doping of ZnO. It was demonstrated that the group III elements could work as n-type dopants for ZnO to replace Zn sites and generate free electrons.26 Because the indium element in ITO films is comparatively rare, the doped ZnO films have been investigated as an alternative to ITO due to their excellent compromise on electrical and optical properties, low price, abundance of raw materials and simplicity of the fabrication process.27–30 Due to their obvious benefits, ZnO-based TCO films have been introduced into inverted polymer solar cells as either charge transport interfacial layers31–41 or bottom electrode materials.42–49 Among the various doping methods, aluminum and gallium doping are well-known approaches to enhance the conductivity of ZnO layers for use as bottom electrodes in inverted PSCs.44–49 Nowadays, well-performing inverted PSCs based on Al or Ga doped bottom electrodes with modified crystallinities and optical properties have been demonstrated. However, up to now the successful application of boron doped ZnO (BZO) layers as transparent electrodes in PSCs has not been demonstrated.
In this work, we report on the electrical, optical and structural/electronic properties of boron-doped ZnO (termed hereafter as BZO) thin films before and after hydrogen post annealing for use as bottom cathode electrodes in inverted PSCs. It was found that hydrogen annealing at temperatures around 200 °C (and above) resulted in the formation of hydrogen-doped BZO electrodes (termed hereafter as BZO:H) which exhibited significantly improved conductivity, carrier concentration, Hall mobility and optical transparency and also presented a reduced work function value compared with their non-annealed counterparts. As a result, PSC devices using BZO:H films as cathode electrodes and the well-known poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) system as the photoactive layer exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.9% which was 20% improved relative to that exhibited by the reference device with the conventional FTO cathode (PCE = 3.30%) and these devices also exhibited exceptional environmental stability. In addition, by using poly[(9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT):PC71BM and poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):PC71BM as the active components in the solar cells high PCE values of 5.90% and 7.25%, respectively, were achieved, which were higher than those of the reference devices using either the non-annealed BZO or FTO cathodes. Based on these results, we believe that our prescription for the control of optical and electronic properties of ZnO-based electrode materials using a hydrogen post-annealing treatment, constitute a step forward in the engineering of electrode materials which is a necessary achievement for the selection of the most suited properties to be exploited not only to PSCs but also in the different kinds of optoelectronic applications.
2. Experimental details
Synthesis of BZO and BZO:H films
BZO films — 100 nm thick — were fabricated on glass substrates using metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Diethylzinc and H2O vapor were used as the precursors with flow rates of 180 sccm and 110 sccm, respectively. In addition, diborane was used as a doping gas. The growth temperature was kept constant at approximately 150 °C, and the pressure in the deposition reactor was 0.02 Torr. The B doping ratio of BZO films was changed by adjusting the flow rate of diborane with respect to the flow rates of the precursor gases. Next, BZO films were hydrogen doped (to formulate BZO:H films) by annealing at elevated temperatures in a pure hydrogen environment.
Device fabrication
PSC devices were fabricated on TCO coated glass substrates. The FTO/glass substrates with a mean thickness of 100 nm, a sheet resistance of ∼13 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 82–84.5% in the visible wavelength region were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and served as the cathode electrodes in the reference devices. The BZO and BZO:H electrodes were deposited on glass substrates similar to FTO films. Prior to deposition, glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a standard solvent regiment (15 min each in acetone and isopropanol). Next, a ZnO layer with a thickness of approximately 40 nm was deposited, following a sol–gel method,50,51 to serve as the electron transport layer followed by an approximately 100 nm photoactive layer. The active layer consisting of the P3HT:PC71BM (1:0.8 wt% ratio) or PCDTBT:PC71BM blend (1:4 wt% ratio) was spin-cast on top of the ZnO film from a 20 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution. After being spin-coated, the active layer was annealed at 140 °C (P3HT:PC71BM) or at 70 °C (PCDTBT:PC71BM) for 10 min in air. In the case of PTB7:PC71BM (10 mg mL−1 for PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 for PC71BM blend in chlorobenzene) a 3% per volume of DIO was added in the solution. After spin coating, the photoactive layer was annealed at 70 °C for 20 min in air. Then, an approximately 20 nm-thick under-stoichiometric molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layer was deposited on top of the active layer, using the previously reported hot-wire deposition method,34,35 to serve as the hole extraction layer. The devices were completed with a 150 nm thick aluminum anode, deposited in a dedicated thermal evaporator at a pressure of 10−6 Torr through a shadow-mask, which defined the device active area to be equal to 12.56 mm2. The devices were then measured in air at room temperature without additional encapsulation. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used with no further purification.
Characterization
The valence band spectra of different TCO and ZnO films were evaluated after recording the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS). For the UPS measurements, the He I (21.22 eV) excitation line was used. A negative bias of 12.28 V was applied to the samples during UPS measurements in order to separate the sample and analyzer high binding energy (BE) cut-offs and estimate the absolute work function value from the high BE cut-off region of the UPS spectra. ZnO-based TCO film surface elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Φ 5600ci X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using a nonmonochromatized MgKα excitation source (1253.6 eV). The binding energy shifts were corrected by assigning a value of 284.8 eV to the C 1s line of adventitious carbon. To validate the luminescence properties for BZO and BZO:H films, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed at room temperature using a 325 nm He–Cd laser line. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was also conducted using a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire layer (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent Inc.) operating at 350 nm with a 150 fs pulse duration and a repetition rate of 80 MHz, with the 2nd harmonic produced by the β-BaBO4 crystal in order to clearly elucidate the recombination dynamics from the observed emission features in these films. The film thickness was estimated by ellipsometry. The EQE measurements were carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat, with a 300 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel 1/8 monochromator for dispersing light in an area of 0.5 cm2. A Thorlabs silicon photodiode was used for the calibration of the spectra. The structural characterization of the samples was carried out by wide angle X-ray diffraction (reflection mode) using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with an Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) equipped with a LynxEye position sensitive detector. The surface morphology was probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements using a FEI Inspect instrument equipped with Genesis Spectrum v.4.52 software for X-ray microanalysis (EDAX). The capacitance–voltage measurements were recorded on devices exhibiting the same architecture as described above (OPVs) at a frequency of 100 KHz and an AC bias of 25 mV by using a Keithley 4200-SCS DC characterization system. The measurements were performed in air at room temperature. Absorption and transmittance measurements were taken using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The current density–voltage characteristics of the fabricated solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The cells were illuminated using a Xe lamp and an AM 1.5G filter to simulate solar light illumination conditions with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), as was recorded using a calibrated silicon photodiode. To accurately define the active area of all devices, we used aperture masks during the measurements with their area equal to those of the Al contacts (12.56 mm2).
3. Results and discussion
The electrical properties of the as-deposited boron-doped ZnO (BZO) films with various B contents are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Overall, significant changes were observed in electrical parameters such as electrical resistivity and carrier concentration (Fig. 1a), Hall mobility and sheet resistance (Fig. 1b) when B doping was increased from 0% up to about 3%. The resistivity of BZO films decreased from 3.0 × 10−3 to 2.4 × 10−4 Ω cm with the increase of the B content from 0 to 2%, due to both, the increase of carrier concentration from 1.74 × 1017 cm−3 to 3.02 × 1020 cm−3 (which indicates that part of the incorporated B atoms act as donors and provide free carriers to ZnO) and Hall mobility from 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 38.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. With the increase of B doping up to about 3%, the resistivity of BZO films slightly increased while the carrier concentration and Hall mobility were decreased. However, it is hard to interpret that the amount of such variation is meaningful. In addition, there is a large decrease in the sheet resistance of the BZO films as the B content increases from 0 to 2% (from 65 Ω sq−1 to 20 Ω sq−1); note that reduced sheet resistance is a prerequisite for using these films as electrode materials. From the above results it becomes evident that an amount of about 2% of B content in BZO films is sufficient to obtain adequate electronic properties of these films. However, further enhancement of these properties was achieved after annealing in a hydrogen environment at elevated temperatures, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. When annealed in hydrogen at temperatures from 0 to 200 °C (the duration of annealing was kept constant at 30 min) the BZO films exhibited a further significant decrease in resistivity and sheet resistance reaching values of 1.5 × 10−4 Ω cm and 10 Ω sq−1 whereas their carrier concentration and Hall mobility were increased to 5.25 × 1020 cm−3 and 58.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This increase in carrier concentration and Hall mobility can be due to the incorporation of the hydrogen donor in the ZnO crystal. However, one should argue that at high substrate temperatures oxygen might be desorbed or removed by reaction with hydrogen, forming oxygen vacancies and decreasing the resistivity of BZO, although this is not expected to be observed at relatively low temperatures. However, since the resistivity of BZO films starts to decrease with the increasing substrate temperature just above the room temperature during annealing, the formation of oxygen vacancies should not be the major (or at least the only) mechanism in enhancing the conductivity of BZO:H films. This is also supported by the small reduction in carrier concentration and Hall mobility (followed by an increase in resistivity and sheet resistance) at temperatures above 200 °C. Therefore, our results indicate that the hydrogen donor is responsible for the increase of carrier concentration in BZO, as theoretically suggested by Van de Walle52,53 and experimentally confirmed by S. Cox et al.54

In Fig. 2a the steady-state PL spectra of the BZO (with 2% B content) and BZO:H films (formed by annealing the BZO films in H2 at 200 °C) are shown. It is apparent that the spectra of the non-annealed B-doped samples, except for the band-to-band sharp UV emission peak, are dominated by a broad emission in the visible wavelength region, while the scan for the annealed H-doped BZO samples is only governed by the band-to-band emission. The time-resolved PL spectral plot used to determine exciton lifetimes is given in Fig. 2b. As evident in the figure, the B-doped samples exhibit a fast decay time of 80.8 ps. According to previous reports on undoped ZnO thin films, a fast recombination time of less than 74 ps is associated with the non-radiative recombination of non-radiative defects in ZnO, including vacancy complexes that include Zn vacancies.55,56 Therefore, as-grown B-doped ZnO films displaying similarly short lifetimes are more likely to maintain non-radiative recombination centers with pristine ZnO films. However, the hydrogen annealed B-doped ZnO films exhibit radiative recombination lifetimes (as determined by fitting bi-exponential decay curves) of 102 ps and 922 ps. The suppressed visible emission of the steady-state PL spectra and the longer lifetime of the H-doped B-doped ZnO films reflect a reduction in defects that serve as carrier traps. This is an additional advantage of these materials when used as electrode materials in optoelectronic applications. UV-visible spectroscopy was also employed to measure the optical transmittance of BZO films, as-deposited and after hydrogen annealing at 200 °C. As shown in Fig. 2c, the transmittance of the as-grown BZO films fell off steeply with the decreasing wavelength around 380 nm, which is a characteristic of high quality ZnO-based films. The BZO films exhibit adequate transparency with the transmittance varying between 82% and 85.6% in the visible wavelength region. However, when H2 is inserted inside the material lattice, the transmittance is significantly increased and varies between 88% and 96%. Note that, the reduced transmittance of both films in the near infrared region is attributed to absorption and reflection by free carriers. In addition, the transmittance edge shifts to a lower wavelength. The phenomenon might be due to the Burstein–Moss effect57 pointing out that the Fermi level inside the conduction band moves upward with the increasing donor concentration due to the filling of the conduction band by the increase of electron carriers and, consequently, electrons can no longer be excited from the valence band maximum to the minimum of the conduction band. Instead higher energies are needed to reach unoccupied states. This so-called Pauli blocking leads to an increase of the optical band gap (Fig. 2d). The increase of carrier concentrations in the BZO:H films is thus concluded from the as measured UV-visible spectra in consistency with the electrical properties determined by electrical measurements. From the above analysis it is deduced that the electrical and optical properties of hydrogen-annealed BZO films were significantly improved in comparison with the non-annealed counterparts.

To probe possible structural differences between the BZO and BZO:H films their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained and are presented in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. It is seen that both XRD patterns exhibit a small peak at 31° attributed to the (100) plane and a large peak at around 34° attributed to the (002) plane. These results suggest that these films consist of crystallites with preferred orientation along the c axis. Upon annealing in hydrogen the (002) peak increases in intensity and is shifted to a higher 2θ value (from 33.78 to 34.20°), indicating a decrease of the interplanar distance. The mean values of grain size R of the BZO-based films were evaluated from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (002) peak using Scherrer's formula58 and were found to be 26.1 nm and 27.2 nm for BZO and BZO:H films, respectively. The increase in R with annealing in hydrogen confirms the improved crystalline quality of the BZO:H films. This trend is in agreement with the results derived from SEM surface images presented in Fig. 3c and d for BZO and BZO:H films, respectively. It is obvious that both films showed a pyramid-like morphology which remained nearly unaffected by the hydrogen annealing treatment. The BZO films exhibited a slightly more dense morphology and a smaller surface grain size compared with the BZO:H films in agreement with the XRD results. Moreover, from XRD patterns the crystalline plane distance (lattice parameter), d, was also calculated from the Bragg diffraction equation: λ = 2dsinθ, where λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54 Å) and θ is the diffraction angle of the (002) peak. In particular, the lattice parameter d in the BZO films is about 2.611 Å, and the d value of hydrogen-annealed BZO:H films is 2.603 Å.

The texture coefficient for the (002) orientation was estimated from the following equation:59 (1)where TC(002) is the texture coefficient of the (002) plane, I(hkl), I(002) are the measured intensities of the (hkl) and (002) peaks, respectively, I0(hkl) and I0(002) are the recorded intensities on a completely random sample taken from a powder diffraction file card; and N is the number of diffractions considered in the analysis. A sample with randomly oriented crystallite yields TC(hkl) = 1, while the larger this value, the larger abundance of crystallites oriented at the (hkl) direction. The calculated texture coefficients TC(002) are 3.7 and 4.1 for BZO and BZO:H films, respectively. It can be seen that the highest TC is obtained for the (002) plane of the BZO:H thin films. The higher value of texture coefficient reveals that the zinc oxide film crystallinity is improved.
Next, in order to investigate the chemical states of elements in the BZO-based films for clarifying the mechanisms for improvement in resistivity, XPS measurements were performed. In the beginning of the XPS measurements, the binding energy of the photoelectron was calibrated by assigning 284.8 eV to the C 1s peak corresponding to adventitious carbon. Fig. 4a–c show the core level peaks of the XPS spectra of Zn 2p, of B 1s and O 1s, respectively, taken in BZO and BZO:H films. The core level peaks of binding energies of Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 for zinc ions are located at 1044.1 and 1022.0 eV, respectively, in the as-deposited BZO films. The intensities and area ratios of Zn 2p components exhibit no changes after hydrogen annealing (Fig. 4a). However, the component peaks are slightly shifted towards the higher energy side in the hydrogenated films, revealing possible formation of Zn–H bonds in these films.60 The binding energy peak located at approximately 192.1 eV is associated with B3+ in the B2O3 structure (Fig. 4b), which provides the evidence for the incorporation of boron into zinc oxide.61 The intensities and area ratios of this peak remains quite similar for both films which is an indication that the boron content is not affected by hydrogen annealing. Fig. 4c shows the O 1s XPS spectrum of the BZO and BZO:H films. The profile of the O 1s spectrum was fitted using the Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. The binding energy peaks located at 530.0 and 531.1 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen (Zn–O bonds) and hydroxyl ions (Zn–OH), respectively.62 The presence of hydrogen atoms (in the form of –OH anions bonded to Zn cations) is evident in the case of the hydrogen annealed sample which is a strong indication of hydrogenation of this sample during annealing. These results suggest that the incorporation of H impurities may play the key role in the improvement in current conduction in the amorphous BZO:H films.

Next, in order to explore the electronic properties of the BZO-based samples ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed. In Fig. 4d and e the secondary electron cut-offs and the valence band spectra of BZO and BZO:H films are shown. Note that, for comparison, the spectrum of an FTO film with the same thickness is also included in these figures. FTO and BZO films possess a WF of 4.7 eV and 4.4 eV, respectively, while BZO:H shows significantly reduced WF with a decreased value of 0.3 eV comparing with BZO. The most widely used theory to explain the WF decreasing phenomenon is the formation of an interfacial dipole when the materials interact (through adsorption, chemisorption or other) with electron-donating elements, such as hydrogen. In our case, during hydrogen annealing, H atoms may be bonded to oxygen atoms present on the surface of BZO forming hydroxyl groups as evidenced by the XPS measurements and also by FTIR transmittance spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) taken on BZO and H2 annealed-BZO films. As a strong electron-donating compound, the H atom could form a strong interfacial dipole on the ZnO surface when it is bonded to the oxygen atom on the surface of the Zn–O lattice, resulting in a decrease of the work function of the hydrogen treated oxide surface relative to its non-treated counterpart, as shown in Fig. 4d. The above data indicate an additional benefit of BZO:H for use as the low-work function cathode electrode contact in PSC devices.
We next investigated the effect of incorporating the BZO films described previously as bottom cathode electrodes in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs based on different donors, such as the well-known P3HT, and the recently introduced small band gap donors PCDTBT and PTB7, and the PC71BM acceptor. The device structure was glass/BZO or BZO:H or FTO (bottom cathode electrode)/ZnO (40 nm) (electron extraction layer)/active layer/MoOx (20 nm) (hole extraction layer)/Al (top anode electrode). The device architecture and chemical structures of organic semiconductors used in this study are shown in Fig. 5a. Note that the electron extracting ZnO layer was fabricated using a solution based sol–gel method which resulted in the formation of a ZnO film consisting of nanoparticles with a rod-like morphology (Fig. S2, ESI†) and exhibiting a surface roughness of 4.9 nm. Several ZnO film thicknesses were evaluated (not shown) with the thickness of 40 nm delivering the highest device efficiency which was attributed to the uniform coverage and smoothening of the rough surface of bottom electrodes. The UPS spectrum and Tauc plot (as derived from absorption measurements) of these films are also shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and were used for the estimation of their energy levels. In Fig. S4 (ESI†), the UPS spectrum and Tauc plot of a MoOx film which was used as the hole extraction layer, are also shown. The selection of MoOx as the anode buffer layer was due to its well established hole extracting capabilities in order to enhance the efficiency of hole harvesting at the anode. The electronic structure of this oxide was previously investigated, and was found to be a very high work function n-type oxide, doped by oxygen vacancies.63,64 According to UPS and absorption measurements the energy level alignment (before contact) of materials used at the different layers in our devices are shown in Fig. 5b and c in the cases of FTO and BZO:H bottom cathode electrodes, respectively. It is obvious that in the case of the FTO cathode a large electron extraction barrier between this electrode and the ZnO buffer layer of about 0.6 eV can be concluded which may deteriorate the device performance. However, this is not the case for the BZO:H/ZnO interface where a nearly barrier free electron extraction is derived from the energy level alignment presented in Fig. 5c. Taking into account that the Fermi level of ZnO is expected to be pinned with the LUMO of PC71BM,65 Ohmic electron extracting cathode interfaces may be formed upon using the BZO:H electrode. Indeed, such a speculation is confirmed by the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics taken under simulated 1.5 AM solar illumination in our devices and shown in Fig. 6a for the case of the P3HT:PC71BM active layer (PSC 1) (Table 1 also summarizes the operational characteristics of devices). From the J–V curves it becomes evident that devices based on the same active layer and different BZO anode electrodes show significant improvement in their short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) upon using hydrogenated BZO:H as the transparent cathode. For PSC 1 (Fig. 6a), the device with the BZO electrode exhibits a PCE of 2.80%, whereas the one with the BZO:H electrode shows a PCE of 3.90% (which represents a 40% improvement); the PCE value obtained in the reference device with the FTO cathode is 3.30%. Note that the value PCE of 3.90% is also higher than the value of 3.01% which was obtained for previously reported P3HT:PC71BM based inverted PSCs using an aluminum-doped zinc oxide cathode and a low-temperature aqueous solution processed zinc oxide electron extraction layer.42 The efficiency enhancement is a direct result of improved Jsc and also Voc and fill factor (FF) in the BZO:H incorporating device compared with the BZO and FTO-based ones. The enhancement of Jsc and FF is reflected in the considerable reduction of the series resistance, Rs, of BZO:H based devices as evidenced from the increased slopes in the dark current measurements of the diodes based on P3HT:PC71BM (Fig. 6b). Reduced Rs suggests an improved contact between the active layers and cathode, which facilitates free charge-carrier extraction and therefore enhanced Jsc and FF in the devices with the hydrogen-annealed BZO electrodes compared with the ones using the BZO or FTO cathodes. In addition, high external quantum efficiency (EQE) values were observed in the devices using the BZO:H cathode (Fig. 6c). This enhancement in EQEs suggests that the photon-to-electron conversion processes are very efficient in these devices. The improved EQE spectra provide clear evidence for the enhanced charge generation/extraction and suggest that charge separation and carrier extraction are significantly enhanced, thus resulting in an increase of the device photocurrent and can be attributed to higher transparency of the hydrogenated BZO cathodes. Note that the significant enhancement in the absorption of the P3HT:PC71BM film upon deposition on top of the BZO:H layer (Fig. S5a, ESI†) may explain the increase of EQE. Such enhancement is derived from the increased transparency of the specific electrode material and not from improved film nanomorphology (Fig. S5b, ESI†).

To further demonstrate that the improved quality of cathode electrodes is the main reason for the improved performance obtained in the devices using the hydrogenated BZO:H electrodes compared with the devices using the BZO ones, we fabricated electron-only devices (with the structure BZO or BZO:H or FTO/ZnO (40 nm)/P3HT:PC71BM (100 nm)/Al) and measured their J–V characteristics, which are shown in Fig. 6d. The hole current in these devices is completely suppressed by subtracting the MoOx interlayer from the top contact. It is observed that the current density in the devices can be manipulated within the range of about two orders of magnitude by changing the BZO electrode to FTO and, especially, to BZO:H ones. We have analyzed our electron-only devices using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model to fit the experimental results using analogues of Child's Law66 which describes single carrier currents in a trap-free insulator and predicts that the current density (J) varies by the square of the applied bias (V) and inversely by the cube of the film thickness (L) according to eqn (2): (2)where εr is the dielectric permittivity and μh is the hole mobility of the active layer. Note that to include the electric field dependency of the mobility, eqn (2) can be appropriately modified according to the Mott–Gurney law (eqn (3)): (3)where  (Poole–Frenkel mobility law), μh,0 is the zero-field mobility, and β is the field activation factor of the mobility. From Fig. 6d, the calculated electron mobilities were 1.92 × 10−4 and 4.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.77 × 10−4 for the devices using the BZO, FTO and BZO:H electrodes, respectively. The enhanced electron mobility and remarkable overall device performance obtained in the device using the hydrogen annealed BZO electrode originates from the formation of a better (Ohmic) contact at the cathode interface and from the reduced electron injection barrier as derived from the electron-only device analysis.
To gain more insight into the above differences between the devices with the different cathode electrodes we measured their capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics in the dark (Fig. 6e). C–V measurements of devices based on organic semiconductors usually exhibit Mott–Schottky characteristics and can be used to evidence the device built-in field (Vbi) which is also related to the presence of charge extraction barriers at electrode contacts. In Fig. 6f the Mott–Schottky characteristics of our devices as derived from their C–V measurements are shown, where C−2 = (2/qεN) (Vbi − V), ε ≈ ε0 is the permittivity of the blend, N is the doping level and q is the elementary charge. Mott–Schottky analysis in Fig. 6f allowed us to determine the device built-in field from the intercept of the linear relationship with the voltage axis, and simultaneously the doping level from the C−2–V slope. For the devices with the BZO cathode we obtained a Vbi of 0.45 V, while for the one with the FTO cathode the estimated Vbi to be 0.44 V. However, the use of BZO:H as the cathode contact delivered an increased Vbi of 0.56 V. This increase in Vbi matches the increase in Voc and indicates that the use of the BZO:H cathode electrode induces large strengthening of the device built-in field. This is due to the higher work function difference between both contacts (bottom TCO cathode and MoOx anode) achieved in the case of low work-function BZO:H.67
We also confirmed that the better quality of the cathode contact of our hydrogen annealed BZO-based devices also results in superior environmental stability compared to the reference device with the FTO cathode. In Fig. 7a–d the variations of PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF of the devices are presented as a function of the storage time under ambient conditions. A faster decrease in operational characteristics of the reference device was observed, while the device with the BZO:H cathodes exhibits better stability with nearly unaffected original values, even after storage in air for more than 2500 hours. The slower degradation rate of the latter solar cell may be a result of exceptional environmental stability of the BZO:H layer, as concluded from the stability study presented in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It is expected that the device stability and lifetime could be further improved by the use of some more advanced encapsulation technologies for organic solar cells.

Finally, in order to demonstrate the universality of our approach we fabricated devices based on the recently introduced small bandgap donor polymers PCDTBT and PTB7. In Fig. 8a and d the photocurrent and in Fig. 8b and e the dark current J–V characteristics of PSCs with the structure glass/cathode/ZnO (40 nm)/PCDTBT:PC71BM or PTB7:PC71BM (90 nm)/MoOx (20 nm) Al, are shown. The results are also summarized in Table 2. The use of BZO:H electrodes was proven again beneficial for the device performance. The devices with the BZO anodes and PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM active layers gave PCE values of 4.0% and 5.30%, respectively, whereas those with the BZO:H electrodes exhibited high PCE values of 5.90% and 7.25%, respectively, (which were better than the 5.10% and 6.75% obtained in the reference devices with FTO cathodes). Note that, previously a structurally identical PTB7:PC71BM-based PSC having an AZO bottom cathode electrode and ZnO and MoOx electron and hole extraction layers, respectively, yielded an efficiency of 6.15% which was the highest reported for a PSC using a doped ZnO-based transparent electrode, but lower compared with the 7.25% reported here.41 Enhanced EQEs (Fig. 8c and f) and electron currents (Fig. S7, ESI†) were also obtained in the devices with the BZO:H cathodes. The calculated electron mobilities for the measurements taken in PCDTBT:PC71BM based electron only devices were 7.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the device with the BZO cathode and 2.91 × 10−4 and 7.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices using the FTO and BZO:H electrodes, respectively, whereas the corresponding values obtained in PTB7:PC71BM based electron only devices were 3.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the device with the BZO cathode and 9.31 × 10−5 and 1.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices with FTO and BZO:H electrodes, respectively. Our findings suggest that in devices with hydrogen annealed BZO used as bottom cathode electrodes substantially improved cathode contacts and enhanced electron mobilities were simultaneously obtained.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utility and effectiveness of hydrogen-doped boron-doped ZnO (termed as BZO:H) films which exhibited high conductivity and optical transparency and low work function values for application as bottom cathode electrodes in polymer solar cells using either P3HT:PC71BM or PCDTBT:PC71BM photoactive layers which gave efficiencies of 3.9% and 5.9%, respectively. These values were higher from the corresponding values obtained in the devices using a conventionally used FTO cathode. Our findings from the detailed analysis performed in this work provide evidence for the incorporation of hydrogen dopants within the BZO lattice during post-annealing in hydrogen which increases the n-type conductivity of the oxide. Our work demonstrates the first successful implementation of BZO-based transparent conductive oxides as cathode electrode materials in organic optoelectronics. We anticipate that understanding and controlling the electronic and physical properties of electrode materials are the key requirements in order to achieve a major increase in efficiency of polymer solar cells. To this end, the ability to control the electrical, optical and electronic properties of ZnO-based TCOs via hydrogen doping will spur progress in the development of ITO-free organic optoelectronic devices.
