    , Accepted 8th September 2022First published on 23rd September 2022AbstractFacile stoichiometric and phase selective synthesis of doped/alloyed metal chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots has been an important pursuit because of the opportunity for tunable photoconductivity. Herein, the structural and optical properties of relatively monodispersed copper indium sulphide incorporated with Ag+ ions, i.e., AgxCuyInS2 (Ag:CIS) quantum dots (average diameter of 4.9 ± 0.6 nm) synthesized via a hot-injection colloidal method are investigated. The Ag:CIS quantum dots exhibit a degree of wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase change with increasing Ag+ concentration (1.1–6.8%) under primarily kinetic synthetic conditions at 180 °C for 10 minutes using copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate, indium(III) and silver(I) diethyldithiocarbamate precursors. The indium-rich and copper-deficient quantum dots are close to the CuInS2 stoichiometry with tunable bandgaps between 1.60 and 1.81 eV influenced by Ag+ concentration, intrinsic defects, minimal quantum confinement and structural permutations. They exhibit broad photoluminescence emission via a dual radiative pathway with long decay lifetimes, τ1 (0.68–2.11 ± 0.02 μs) and τ2 (3.37–7.38 ± 0.20 μs), implicating donor–acceptor pair transitions of indium interstitials,  and/or indium–copper antisites,  to copper vacancies,  for low Ag+ concentrations but primarily silver interstitials,  to  for higher Ag+ concentrations. Importantly, this study is the first involving Ag+ ion-dependent wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation of CIS quantum dots and with their long radiative emission lifetimes are potentially effective photo-absorbers in quantum dot solar cells.
Introduction
Metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) have various salient features such as high electrical conductivity, high charge carrier concentrations, high optical absorptivity, excellent photoemission properties and tunable bandgaps.1–5 Among the different classes, synthesis and application of binary II–VI and ternary I–III–VI metal chalcogenide QDs have been widely investigated with tremendous interest in those composed of the elements, copper, zinc and cadmium which are inexpensive, abundant and with the exception of cadmium, environmentally friendly.6–11 In particular, the I–III–VI copper-based congeners, copper indium disulphide and diselenide, CuInS2 (CIS) and CuInSe2 (CISe) QDs exhibit high absorption coefficient in the range ∼105 cm−1 and comparatively narrow bandgaps that are spectrally requisite for solar energy absorption.12 In particular, CIS is of interest as its optoelectronic properties can be tuned solely by intrinsic lattice defects due to the large range of anion and cation off-stoichiometry tolerance.13 Congruent with other reports involving the defect chemistry of CIS,14,15 recently we reported various intrinsic defect states implicated in the broad photoluminescence emission of slightly off-stoichiometric undoped CIS QDs.13 Since shallow energy states from some of these defects act as trapping states suppressing conductivity and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CIS-based solar cells,16 it has been shown that strategic doping and alloying are useful in tailoring their morphological, optical and electrical properties,3,9,10 for more spectrally adaptive thin film and quantum dot solar cells.17,18 Therefore, synthetic strategies must be tailored for successful doping or alloying rather than the commonly reported QD surface adsorption19 for effective tunable optical and conductive properties.
Importantly, the extent to which optical properties of the doped or alloyed nanocrystals are controlled depends primarily on the type of metal ion. Notably, relatively few examples of heterovalent ion impurity inclusion in metal chalcogenide colloidal nanocrystals have been reported,19–27 with homovalent ion impurity inclusion seemingly more achievable. Indeed, impurity doping has been difficult to achieve in semiconductor nanocrystals, with early accounts claiming that they were not “dopable” due to thermodynamically-controlled self-purification.28,29 However, there have been recent successes involving the careful control of the synthetic chemistry leading to efficient doping.29 An essential benefit of impurity ions is their influence on the charge carrier separation and recombination dynamics to enhance the PCE of solar cells.17 A variety of impurity transition metal ions have been employed to enhance the PCE of chalcogenide QD-sensitized solar cells.30–33 Most notably, radiative emission lifetimes up to several microseconds have been reported for Mn-doped metal chalcogenides rendering efficient charge separation,2,34 and there are several reports on the role of Mn2+ in effecting optoelectronic tunability, due to its characteristic spin and orbital forbidden electronic d–d (4T1 ← 6A1) transition.12,17,34–42
Notwithstanding the attractive properties of CIS, the highest recorded PCE of ∼8.5% for a CIS-based solar cell43 is not as competitive as silicon, thin film or quantum dot-based cells.44 Facile tunability of structural and optoelectronic properties is one strategy towards spectrally adapting CIS-based solar cells for improved efficiency, achievable through metal ion doping or alloying. In this regard, it has been shown that Ti-doped CIS incorporated in solar cells improved open-circuit voltages and efficiency, whilst Al-doped CIS exhibited a high absorption coefficient.45 Though photocurrent collection in solar cells with Zn and Mg-doped CIS is diminished at high dopant concentrations, at low concentrations, open-circuit voltage improved.45,46 Also, Klenk and co-workers46 demonstrated that Ga-doped CIS improved cell efficiencies. These cases show promising outcomes with heterovalent impurity ions but there are relatively few accounts involving homovalent impurities incorporated into CIS, for example with silver(I) ions, considering their effect on the electrical properties of absorber hosts.28,46–48 In one case, Werner and co-workers49 reported better cell output for CIS incorporated with low Ag+ concentrations. Most recently, we reported that pure tetragonal phase Ag-doped thin films prepared by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition exhibited tunable morphology, composition, and near-infrared absorption for small dopant content,50 though we were not able to assess their effect on device PCE. Notwithstanding these promising outcomes, it is notable that there are no reports on Ag:CIS QDs, suggesting an opportunity for investigation beyond thin films. However, the main challenge in this context is simultaneously achieving facile optoelectronic tunability and desirable structural quality.
On that basis, in our previous work,13 we demonstrated facile synthesis of relatively monodispersed, off-stoichiometric, tetragonal phase colloidal CIS QDs (diameter of 3.8–5.6 nm) across a range of particle growth temperatures, exhibiting tunable bandgaps of 2.25–2.32 eV. The copper-deficient QDs exhibited broad photoluminescence emission featuring a combination of surface, donor and acceptor (,  and ) defect states. Importantly, time-dependent wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation was achieved as a unique route towards tunable structural and optical properties. Since successful doping or alloying requires kinetic-control rather than thermodynamic-control, we have employed the facile hot-injection approach from our previous work in this case to synthesize relatively monodispersed Ag:CIS colloidal QDs under primarily kinetic conditions to modulate their stoichiometric, structural, and optical properties. The effect of composition and defect chemistry on the structural and optical properties is investigated, primarily the interplay of the Ag+ ions and intrinsic defects on the electronic band structure and radiative decay dynamics. Importantly, Ag+ ion-dependent wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation during growth at constant temperature is investigated as an alternative, new route towards tunable structural and optical properties. Herein, our singular aim and scope of work are to demonstrate a facile and effective approach towards tunable optical properties of Ag:CIS QDs based on their structural and defect chemistry.
Results and discussion
Composition and structure of Ag:CIS quantum dots
Tunable optical properties of CIS nanoparticles can be achieved by manipulating its defect chemistry.31,32,51,52 Therefore, in synthesizing Ag:CIS, 2–20 mol% of Ag(dedtc) precursor replaced Cu(hfacac)2·xH2O. Herein, we first confirm Ag+ inclusion in the CIS nanoparticle samples before discussing their structural properties. Accordingly, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) data in Table 1 (representative spectrum in Fig. 1) show CIS samples, CIS-0, CIS-1.1, CIS-1.5, CIS-2.2, CIS-5.0 and CIS-6.8 corresponding to 0, 1.1, 1.5, 2.2, 5.0 and 6.8% Ag+ respectively, incorporated and confirm structures of the general stoichiometry, AgxCuyInS2 (where, x + y ≈ 1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) spectra in Fig. 1 confirm Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 states with binding energies at ∼932 and ∼952 eV, respectively and peak splitting energy of ∼20 eV expected for Cu+ ions.53–55 Also, In 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states with binding energies of ∼445 and ∼452 eV, respectively with peak splitting energy of ∼8 eV confirm In3+ ions. Binding energies for S 2p3/2 at ∼162 eV and 2p3/2 at ∼163 eV with peak splitting at ∼1.0 eV are attributed to S2− ions. Slightly higher values around 166–168 eV may be indicative of S from capping ligand and/or QD surface. Additionally, binding energies at ∼368 and ∼374 eV with peak splitting of ∼6.0 eV confirm the Ag+ ions.56–58 However, a peak at ∼169 eV in all samples except for CIS-5.0 is attributed to oxidized sulphur. Both EDS and XPS used in tandem show a linear increase in Ag+ content corresponding to a relatively linear decrease in Cu+ content as shown in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 2. The disparity in Ag+ content between EDS and XPS is attributed to the sampling depth of the techniques, the grazing angle of incident X-rays of the XPS and nanoparticle composition inhomogeneity, in terms of its surface with organic capping ligand relative to its inorganic core.28,59 Therefore, it is assumed that the lower contents from the soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reflect mainly the surface region composition of the quantum dot, whilst the EDS gives bulk composition. Therefore, the difference in values was used to estimate the efficacy of Ag+ inclusion though the EDS content was used to calculate stoichiometry since we are not able to confirm the difference and effect of Ag+ in the surface region versus Ag+ incorporated in the QD core. Accordingly, Table 1 shows an average efficiency of Ag+ inclusion of ∼28% with a maximum of 45% and Fig. 2 shows a strong linear correlation of the quantities of Ag+ measured versus input synthetically, suggesting a degree a predictability in incorporating Ag+ ions into CIS QDs in this case, and that the synthetic approach employed is a route towards tunable properties. Additionally, the disparity in the Ag+/Cu+ ratio is partly attributed to their ionic radii (114 pm/74 pm) indicating that each Ag+ ion may substitute ca. 1.5 Cu+ ions; however, there is the possibility of copper vacancies, , silver interstitials,  and indium–copper antisites,  in the CIS lattice. Cu+ vacancies could arise since Cu+ ions are more mobile than In3+ ions. Since the ionic radius of In3+ (80 pm) is similar to that of Cu+, excess In3+ may more readily than Ag+ ions substitute Cu+, rendering a fair amount of  and  sites in the CIS lattice, especially considering its large range off-stoichiometry tolerance. Inevitably, with this trend in Ag+/Cu+ ratio, the number of  sites increases as Ag+ content increases.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (representatives, CIS-0 and CIS-6.8 in Fig. 3(a and b)) show quasi-spherical nanoparticles of sizes 4.1 ± 0.5 to 6.8 ± 1.1 nm for the series of samples (Table 2). Lattice spacings of 3.32–3.34 Å for CIS-0 to CIS-5.0 confirm the characteristic (100) lattice plane of the hexagonal wurtzite structure, whilst 3.13 Å for CIS-6.8 confirms the characteristic (112) lattice plane of the tetragonal chalcopyrite structure,60–64 suggesting a wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase change. Additionally, Fig. 3(c) shows overlaid powder X-ray diffractograms for CIS with reference patterns for hexagonal and tetragonal structures of CuInS2, Cu2S and In2S3 in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The diffractograms show broad reflections typical of nanostructures in which those for CIS-0 to CIS-2.2 correlate well with the wurtzite CIS structure (ICDD reference no. 01-077-9459). However, the diffractogram for CIS-5.0 is slightly different with the (100) and (101) reflections at ∼26.9° and ∼29.2° strongly overlapping into a broad band with a slight shoulder, though still correlating with a wurtzite structure. Additionally, there is a subtle blue-shift of the (100) reflection for CIS-2.2 and CIS-5.0 (∼27.0°) relative to CIS-0, CIS-1.1 and CIS-1.5 (∼26.6°). There is also a subtle red-shift from ∼29.8° to ∼29.2° for CIS-0 to CIS-5.0. Moreover, the diffractogram for CIS-6.8 shows a new (112) reflection at ∼28.0° typical for the chalcopyrite structure (ICDD reference no. 00-027-0159). There is also absence of the reflection at ∼38° for CIS-6.8 relative to CIS-0 to CIS-5.0. With these observations, it is not unreasonable to assume that the peak characteristics mainly for CIS-5.0 suggests a polytypic nanostructure of primarily wurtzite phase with chalcopyrite domains and that for CIS-6.8 there is a marked transformation to primarily chalcopyrite phase. The absence of p-XRD reflections as well as Raman vibrational modes typically at ∼474 and ∼323 cm−1 (Fig. 3(d)) associated with impurities, Cu2S and In2S3 suggests phase pure QDs.65,66 Moreover, the Raman spectra display broad bands some of which are shifted relative to each other or change in intensity with an increase in Ag+ content, providing further evidence of the wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase change. In particular, for CIS-0 to CIS-1.5 the band at ∼287 cm−1 attributed to the E mode caused by In–S vibration, primarily associated with the wurtzite phase67 is now shifted for CIS-2.2 to CIS-6.8 to ∼293–295 cm−1 which is associated with the S2− ion A1 mode of a chalcopyrite phase.15,68,69 The lower intensity band in the region 302–305 cm−1 attributed to the *A1 vibrational mode of the chalcopyrite phase seems to overlap with the more intense band of the A1 mode (293–295 cm−1), forming a broad band which becomes slightly more prominent with increase in Ag+ content. This observation is not unusual since the chalcopyrite phase accompanies the primary wurtzite phase.70,71 The region 332–342 cm−1 shows a broad band for the E1LO mode with maximum shifting from ∼341 to ∼334 cm−1 for CIS-0 to CIS-6.8, possibly suggesting a phase change from wurtzite to chalcopyrite. Indeed, this E1LO vibrational mode has been reported for the chalcopyrite phase observed at 337 cm−1 by Wang et al.,72–74 attributing it to a copper deficient state, possibly involving . Also, the very weak band in the region 254–267 cm−1 attributed to the B2 mode of the wurtzite phase diminishes with increasing Ag+ concentration. Interestingly, the collective intensities of bands from 254 to 305 cm−1 are lower than for the band around 332–341 cm−1 except for CIS-6.8, further suggesting a phase permutation from primarily wurtzite to more chalcopyrite in nature of polytypic CIS. Overall, these collective structural data correlate to indicate a degree of wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation of Ag:CIS quantum dots and to the best of our knowledge is the first such account, suggesting a new route for tunable structural properties of CIS.

Formation mechanism and phase transformation
As previously reported,13 colloidal synthesis of undoped CIS quantum dots involved a dynamic interplay of kinetic and thermodynamic factors, in which fast nucleation and low particle growth rate influenced formation of the kinetically metastable wurtzite phase with eventual transformation to the thermodynamically stable chalcopyrite phase at equilibrium. However in this work, HRTEM, p-XRD and Raman spectral data imply gradual structural permutations from a predominantly wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase as Ag+ content increases above a threshold. Indeed, Koo and co-workers75 were the first to report polytypic nanostructures in which predominantly wurtzite phase nanodisks featured stacking faults along their edges consisting of a mixture of wurtzite and chalcopyrite phases. Similar outcomes reported by Xie and co-workers76 showed that a gradual increase in particle growth temperature induced transformation from primarily wurtzite to chalcopyrite phases. Therefore, as in our previous report,13 we suggest that formation of wurtzite Ag:CIS in this case likely proceeds via a wurtzite phase Ag:Cu2S intermediate, AgxCu2−xS, since the soft Lewis acid ions, Ag+ and Cu+ would proportionally coordinate with the dodecanethiol ligand, a soft Lewis base. Subsequent decomposition of this in situ complex to AgxCu2−xS nanoparticles is followed by cationic exchange with In3+ to form AgxCuyInS2 QDs stabilized by the capping ligand. However, it has also been proposed that formation of chalcopyrite CIS proceeds via an in situ Cu–In thiolate precursor.53,77 Therefore, we suggest that at lower Ag+ concentrations, metastable wurtzite Ag:CIS is formed via a metastable kinetic intermediate, wurtzite AgxCu2−xS depicted via the P1 pathway in Fig. 4 and the chalcopyrite phase proceeds via a secondary P2 pathway involving the higher energy transition state, Ag–Cu–In thiolate complex. In effect, the predominantly metastable kinetic wurtzite product is the initial phase from which the thermodynamically stable chalcopyrite Ag:CIS QDs emerge via the P1 pathway. Since AgInS2 exists in the chalcopyrite phase,78,79 and primarily kinetic conditions of short reaction time and constant, relatively low temperature exists in this case, it is reasonable to assume that lattice distortions due to the size disparity between Cu+ and substituting Ag+ ions, likely alter the energetics of particle growth as Ag+ concentration increases. This induces a phase transformation from the metastable wurtzite to the thermodynamically stable chalcopyrite phase. Alternatively, the presence of Ag+ and Cu+ ions may have a synergistic effect on the formation of the Ag–Cu–In thiolate complex, propelling increased nucleation of the chalcopyrite Ag:CIS phase via the P2 synthetic route as Ag+ concentration increases. Indeed, primarily kinetic conditions instead of sustained thermodynamic conditions limit the full extent of the phase change from wurtzite to chalcopyrite, rendering likely polytypic CIS QDs mainly at higher Ag+ concentrations.

Absorption and photoluminescence properties
Investigation of the stoichiometric and phase dependent optical tunability of CIS quantum dots is important for solar cell applications. Therefore, absorption and photoluminescence properties are investigated to determine the influence of these on the as-synthesized Ag:CIS QDs. Accordingly, UV-vis-NIR absorption data in Fig. 5 and Fig. S3 (ESI†) show broad range tunable absorption with band edges between 685 and 775 nm and shoulders around 300–320 nm correlating with increasing Ag+ content. Closer examination of the spectra and corresponding Tauc plots show evidence of Urbach tails associated with intra bandgap states, characteristic for defected, doped, bulk or surface modified semiconductors.80 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), a modified method80 for more accurate estimation of the bandgap was applied involving the intersection of linear fits above and below the fundamental absorption. Tables 1 and 2 along with Fig. 2 show that the increase in Ag+ content corresponds to a general decrease in Cu+ content and Cu+/In3+ ratio in relation to the bandgap and could be attributed to the Ag+ ion induced structural permutations. Though the bandgaps depict a red-shift with increasing Ag+ fraction for the series, those for CIS-1.1 to CIS-2.2 are slightly blue-shifted relative to CIS-0, whilst those for CIS-5.0 and CIS-6.8 are correspondingly red-shifted. The combination of a higher Cu+/In3+ ratio, no Ag+ ions and a stoichiometric S2− content for CIS-0 are factors to consider for the blue and red-shifts of the bandgap for CIS-1.1–CIS-2.2 and CIS-5.0–CIS-6.8, respectively in relation to CIS-0. Indeed, it has been established that the electronic band structure for CIS comprises a valence band of Cu 3d and S 3p energy states from Cu–S bonds, whilst the conduction band comprises Cu 4s, S 3p and In 5s antibonding states.13,81 Since Laporte and spin-allowed direct bandgap transitions are influenced by nanoparticle size, composition and structure,50,82 a decrease in Cu+ content would reduce its density of electronic states, thereby lowering the valence band maximum and widening the bandgap.50,83 However, since this contradicts the trend (Fig. 2), it is likely that defects associated with Ag+ ions and excess In3+ ions increase the density of electronic states in the region of the band edges, thereby narrowing the bandgap. Additionally, PL spectra for CIS-1.1 to CIS-5.0 in Fig. 5(c) are slightly blue-shifted (∼932 nm) relative to 946 nm for CIS-0, whilst CIS-6.8 is red-shifted to 984 nm. This trend does not correlate with that of the absorption band edges suggesting several factors in addition to the defect chemistry, influencing the optical properties. It is reasonable to assume that since WZ phase CIS typically has a wider bandgap than CH phase CIS, then the difference in structure between CIS-1.1 to CIS-2.2 (WZ) and CIS-6.8 (CH) is also influential on the optical properties. Notably, the polytypic nature of CIS-5.0 with primarily WZ phase and CH domains relates to its red-shifted bandgap. However, since the particle diameter for CIS-6.8 (Table 2) is larger (6.8 ± 1.1 nm) than the others (average of 4.5 ± 0.5 nm), it is reasonable to assume that a there is a dynamic interplay of quantum-sized effects (since the Bohr exciton radius for CIS is ∼4.1 nm),53 structural differences and defect chemistry, influencing the optical properties. Notwithstanding this, the most interesting features of the absorption and emission are the corresponding shoulders in the 300 and 1100 nm regions, respectively, which slightly red-shift and intensify with increasing Ag+ fraction. Whilst broad absorption and emission for CIS in the NIR region have been attributed to donor–acceptor pair (DAP) defect states,13,43,53,84 the corresponding absorption and emission shoulders suggest an influence on the electronic structure by energy states associated with Ag+ ions. Furthermore, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) ranging between 171 and 201 nm for these broad emissions are typical for CIS nanostructures and can be attributed to recombination involving defect states, with some contribution from particle size distribution.85–87

In addition to the emission shoulder at around 1100 nm for CIS-2.2 to CIS-6.8, there is also a slight shoulder at around 860 nm. As shown in Fig. 5(e, f) and Fig. S4 (ESI†), and summarized in Table 3, Gaussian deconvolution of the emission peaks confirms two component peaks at 932–939 and 942–978 nm for CIS-0 to CIS-1.1 but three components at 847–858, 935–979 and 1109–1113 nm for CIS-2.2 to CIS-6.8 with the dominant component at 935–979 nm as shown from the peak fractions for all QDs. This suggests that there are competing radiative pathways for recombination. Based on the stoichiometry, it is likely that the additional sources of emission are associated with intra bandgap states related to Ag+, including interstitials, . To further probe the dynamics of the recombination pathway, time-resolved photoluminescence decay curves shown in Fig. 5(d) are evaluated, which fit well to a bi-exponential function: IPL(t) = I0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2. Here, τ1 and τ2 describe the radiative lifetimes, and A1 and A2 the respective radiative fractions of associated transitions. This function compares well with the emission band Gaussian deconvolution for CIS-0 to CIS-1.1, suggesting two recombination pathways. However, this is different for CIS-2.2 to CIS-6.8 and could be because the additional radiative component derived from the deconvolution at ∼860 nm has a similar decay rate to another route, which cannot be decoupled. This is likely associated with the Ag+ ions either directly for example from  states or indirectly from states such as  formed by the decrease of Cu+ ions and Cu+/In3+ ratio due to increasing Ag+ ions. From the decay function, the I0 term is related to non-radiative recombination with a lifetime constant of τNR. The radiative lifetimes, τ1 and τ2 are found to be 0.68–2.11 and 3.37–7.38 μs, respectively for the series (Table 3) which are much longer than previously reported13 for CIS. There is no trend in the decay times with respect to Ag+ content and the differences in values are not significant and likely attributed to the collection statistics from the instrument. Though we are not able to assess this, it can be suggested that the Ag:CIS QDs are potentially effective photo-absorbers in solar cell devices because their longer-lived charge carriers are likely more readily extracted before detrimental recombination. These findings are notably different from our previous report13 in which undoped chalcopyrite CIS displayed very fast triple pathway recombination (1.5–70.8 ns) featuring surface trapping states, intrinsic populated core states and DAPs, i.e.,  and . The most dominant radiative recombination channels involved the faster decays between band edges and surface defects and/or  with transition involving DAPs contributing significantly less to the emission. Unlike chalcopyrite CIS, there have been only few photoluminescence studies conducted on wurtzite CIS. However, Leach and co-workers60 concluded that the recombination mechanism of wurtzite CIS was due to an  to valence band transition with associated energy of 1.31 eV equivalent to the range of 1.26–1.34 eV for Ag:CIS in this work. Other authors13,60,88–91 have reported for copper deficient metal chalcogenides, that shallow donor levels associated with  and  as well as shallow acceptors of  have been implicated as intrinsic intra bandgap states. Therefore, considering the indium-rich and copper-deficient nature of the Ag:CIS QDs in this work, we suggest that a transition from  and/or  to  states is the dominant emission pathway associated with τ1 (A1 = 77.9–90.4%). It is not certain the nature of the secondary recombination channel, which is several orders longer than the primary pathway and extremely long in comparison to previous findings.17,83,92 However, we speculate that this may be associated with spin and/or orbital forbidden electronic transitions of defect states.10,17,30–37,93 Indeed, the number of defect sites, nd is related to the electronic spin configurations accordingly:  where Nsite is the number of lattice sites, gp is the degeneracy factor of charge state associated with spin configuration, ΔHf is the point defect formation enthalpy, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.94 Accordingly, the  defects for example, may likely adopt two different electronic configurations, the dominant singlet state, and a smaller fraction of a triplet state. This therefore renders spin-forbidden transitions involving the conduction band minimum to ionized  triplet donor trapping states. These along with orbital forbidden d–d transitions between In 4d states and the Cu 3d valence band maximum, and/or ionized  acceptor trapping states to valence band maximum, may be responsible for the much longer lifetimes associated with the secondary recombination (Fig. 6). Furthermore, for Ag:CIS with higher concentrations of Ag+ (above a threshold), the presence of  donor states95 of possibly lower energy relative to the  donor states could emerge as the dominant pathway for recombination as shown in Fig. 6, especially since the PL maximum and bandgap for CIS-6.8 are slightly red-shifted. It appears that Ag:CIS with higher Ag+ concentrations may be displaying similar NIR emission characteristics to AgInS2 nanoparticles involving long emission lifetimes up to several hundred nanoseconds.56,96–99 Furthermore, it is likely that Cu+/Ag+ ratios governing the defect chemistry are more influential on the electronic band structure than the analogous wurtzite and chalcopyrite structures, especially since they differ only in terms of the packing sequence of cations. This assumption is supported by work conducted by Lei and co-workers100 in which CIS zinc blende, wurtzite and spinel structures displayed bandgaps of 1.55, 1.54 and 1.51 eV, respectively. Overall, it could be argued that higher concentrations of Ag+ ions are accommodated by the high defect tolerance of the off-stoichiometric chalcopyrite phase. Though PL recombination pathways proposed for these Ag:CIS are reasonable assumptions, transient absorption/emission spectroscopy would be helpful in further probing the excited state dynamics of the electronic transitions.

Experimental
Materials
1-Dodecanethiol (DDT, Aldrich, >98%), 1-octadecene (ODE, Aldrich, 90%) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, Aldrich, ≥99.9%) were used as purchased, whilst methanol, acetone and toluene were distilled and dried using standard methods. Copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate [Cu(Hfacac)2·xH2O], sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (Nadedtc·3H2O), silver diethyldithiocarbamate [Ag(dedtc), ≥99%] and indium(III) chloride (InCl3) were used as purchased from Aldrich. Indium(III) diethyldithiocarbamate, In(dedtc)3 was prepared as described following.

Synthesis of indium(III) diethyldithiocarbamate precursor. 
Indium(III) diethyldithiocarbamate, In(dedtc)3 was prepared according to a literature method.101 InCl3 (8.9 mmol, 1.9761 g) was dissolved in a minimum amount of distilled water, cooled and then added dropwise to a 40 mL 1:1 mixture of methanol and water of Nadedtc·3H2O (26.7 mmol, 6.0158 g) with constant stirring. In(dedtc)3 crystals were filtered, washed repeatedly with methanol, recrystallized from toluene and air dried. Elemental analysis, found (%): C, 33.02; H, 5.53; N, 7.39; S, 34.24; In, 20.47. Elemental analysis, calculated for C15H30InN3S6 (559.63 g mol−1) (%): C, 32.21; H, 5.41; N, 7.51; S, 35.62; In, 20.53.

Synthesis of dodecanethiol-capped CIS quantum dots. 
In a typical synthesis, post vacuum, a mixture of In(dedtc)3 (0.2 mmol; 0.1169 g), 2.4 mL DDT and 5 mL ODE was heated to 140 °C under argon. To this, a hot mixture of Cu(hfacac)2·xH2O (0.2 mmol; 0.1038 g) and 5 mL ODE, and a hot 2 mL toluene mixture of Ag(dedtc) of 2–20 mol% were simultaneously quickly injected followed by rapid heating to 180 °C with particle growth up to 10 minutes. Time-dependent nanoparticle growth was monitored using optical spectroscopy from samples prepared with 0.5 mL aliquots of the reaction mixture and 1 mL toluene. The reaction was suspended by immersing the reaction flask in cold water and as-synthesized nanoparticles were centrifugated in acetone, isolated, and later stored as solid or dispersed in hexane.


Measurements. 
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out using either a FEI Talos F200X or Phillips 420 microscope. For powder X-ray diffraction, nanoparticles as a toluene ink were drop-casted onto cleaned glass substrates, air dried and mounted onto sample holders. Diffractograms were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer utilizing copper anode with filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) within a 2θ range of 20 to 80° with step size of 0.02° s−1 for 2½ hours operating at 40 mA and 20 kV. Diffractograms were auto-indexed using the X'Pert HighScore software.102 Likewise, Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw RM System 1000 Mk1 Raman spectrometer with Modu-Laser Aries 163 514/25 argon-ion 514 nm 25 mW laser at 0.277 mW with 50× objective lens within the range 26 to 1000 cm−1. CHNS data of precursors were collected using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 elemental analyzer and metal ion contents measured using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300 Duo inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) data on nanoparticles were recorded in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mode using a Phillips XL 30 field emission gun microscope with electron beam accelerating voltage of 20 kV and 10 mm working distance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an Axis Ultra Hybrid spectrometer at 10 mA emission, 15 kV bias on the Al Kα (1486 eV) anode. For peak synthesis, a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian function with a Shirley-type background subtraction was used. Samples were flooded with low-energy electrons for efficient charge neutralization. Binding energies were determined using C 1s at 284.8 eV as the charge reference. Optical spectroscopy of nanoparticles dispersed in toluene was possible using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer and a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrofluorometer with excitation at 480 nm within the region of 550 to 1200 nm. The emission peak was deconvoluted using a Gaussian fitting function from the OriginPro103 software. Photoluminescence decay curves were obtained from a multi-channel scanning mode (for lifetimes below 100 μs) employing an EPL laser diode at an excitation wavelength of ∼320 nm.

Conclusions
Relatively monodispersed AgxCuyInS2 (Ag:CIS) colloidal quantum dots (average diameter of 4.9 ± 0.6 nm) exhibit a degree of wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation with increasing Ag+ ion concentration (1.1–6.8%) under primarily kinetic synthetic conditions. Their compositions are close to the CuInS2 stoichiometry with tunable bandgaps between 1.60 and 1.81 eV, influenced by electronic states from Ag+ ions, instrinsic defects, minimal quantum confinement and structural permutations. The indium-rich and copper-deficient quantum dots exhibit broad PL emission attributed to dual pathways with long decay lifetimes, τ1 (0.68–2.11 ± 0.02 μs) and τ2 (3.37–7.38 ± 0.20 μs), implicating donor–acceptor pair transitions of indium interstitials,  and/or indium–copper antisites,  to copper vacancies,  for low Ag+ ion concentrations but primarily silver interstitials,  to  for higher Ag+ ion concentrations. This study is the first involving Ag+ ion-dependent wurtzite to chalcopyrite phase transformation as a unique route towards tunable structural and optical properties of colloidal CIS quantum dots. The long radiative emission lifetimes of these Ag:CIS quantum dots suggest their potential utility in quantum dot solar cells since the long-lived charge carriers may be more readily extracted for photocurrent before detrimental recombination.
