    , Accepted 1st July 2019First published on 9th July 2019AbstractTitanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures have been extensively investigated in the field of photocatalysis, and many previous review articles have summarized the progress made in the design and synthesis of crystalline TiO2 with tailored nanostructures. However, the physical and chemical properties of TiO2, including light absorption, surface adsorption, and charge carrier separation, are related to the disordered arrangement of intrinsic atoms. Therefore, amorphous TiO2 (am-TiO2) with long-range atomic disorder plays an important role in the photocatalytic performances. Unfortunately, at present we still know less about amorphous TiO2-based materials than crystalline ones from a scientific viewpoint, and a comprehensive review on am-TiO2 is lacking and highly desirable to further advance the development of novel function-oriented TiO2-based nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the structural characteristics, optical properties, synthesis principles and current morphologies of am-TiO2 nanostructures. In particular, photocatalytic applications with regard to am-TiO2-based nanostructures are highlighted. Additionally, we briefly propose several perspectives on the challenges and new direction for future investigation. This review will act as a useful guideline for researchers who are currently concentrating on TiO2 materials to fabricate novel amorphous-based nanomaterials for photochemical applications.Shaodong SunShaodong Sun received his bachelor's degree and master's degree from Xi'an University of Technology in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and his PhD degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2011.

1. Introduction
Since its discovery for photocatalytic water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructured materials have been attracting much more attention in a wide variety of applications in the fields of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants,2–14 photocatalytic water splitting,15–20 photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2),21–25 and photocatalytic organic synthesis.26,27 The investigations are mainly focused on the design and synthesis of crystalline TiO2 with tailored nanostructures, leading to the formation of diverse TiO2 nanocrystals with controllable size,28–31 shape,32–40 facets,41–52 defects,53–57 dopants58–61 and hybridization,62–65 which provides a meritorious platform for not only uncovering the structure–property relationship but also enhancing the performances in their practical applications. Although crystalline TiO2 with the merits of earth abundance, low toxicity, chemical and thermal stability, and good resistance to photocorrosion can be suitable for photocatalytic reactions, several well-known disadvantages including the ineffective utilization of visible light as well as near-infrared light and high recombination of photo-generated charge carriers greatly hinder the improvement of its photocatalytic activity. Consequently, various modification strategies have been utilized to optimize the photochemical properties of TiO2, aiming to decrease the band gap and increase the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, such as the fabrication of highly-active facets and/or surface heterojunctions, hybridization with new species (including narrow band gap semiconductors, carbon materials, noble metals and organic dyes), metal ion/nonmetal ion doping, and construction of defective TiO2 with oxygen vacancies and/or trivalent titanium.66–70 In particular, recent investigations have revealed that some physicochemical properties of TiO2, such as light absorption, surface adsorption, charge carrier separation, photocatalytic reactivity, selectivity, etc., can be determined by the disordered arrangement of intrinsic atoms.71–73 Therefore, defective TiO2 plays a significant role in enhancing the photocatalytic performance.
Amorphous materials (also called non-crystalline or vitreous materials) possess a typical long-range atomic disorder structure and isotropic physical as well as chemical properties, which enable them to exhibit high activity in amorphous TiO2 (denoted as am-TiO2) photocatalysis owing to the enhanced light harvesting and high specific surface area.74–76 For example, am-TiO2 with yellow color can display both surface adsorption and photoactive performance under visible light irridation.74 Moreover, Wang et al. have demonstrated that the visible light induced photosensitized degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) was faster on am-TiO2 than that on crystallized TiO2, which suggested that am-TiO2 was an excellent mediator for electron transfer from excited dyes to oxygen.75 In addition, Zeng et al. have reported that hydrogen evolution based on the electrons/protons stored on am-TiO2 could be achieved by the introduction of a catalyst mediator, which enabled the recyclable TiO2 to catalyze the hydrogen production step without requiring post-light energy input.76 Therefore, am-TiO2 plays an important role in the photocatalytic reaction. However, people still know less about am-TiO2-based materials than crystalline ones from a scientific viewpoint, and a comprehensive review on am-TiO2-based materials is lacking so far.
In this review, we comprehensively summarize the structural characteristics, optical properties, morphologies and design principles as well as available routes for the synthesis of am-TiO2 nanostructures, and discuss their photocatalytic applications (see Fig. 1). Firstly, we will present the structural characteristics and optical properties of am-TiO2. Next, the morphologies of am-TiO2 nanostructures are primarily categorized by the synthetic strategies. Afterwards, the potential applications and corresponding photocatalytic mechanisms in the fields of photocatalytic water splitting, photoreduction of CO2 and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants are highlighted based on the existing literature, respectively. Finally, we will briefly give several perspectives on the challenges and new direction for future study. We hope that this tutorial review would make a useful contribution to the development of amorphous-based nanomaterials for photocatalytic applications.

2. Fundamental properties
2.1 Structure
The majority of studies on TiO2 is based upon three crystalline phases (namely anatase, rutile and brookite).77 The three crystalline TiO2 polymorphs are made of TiO6 octahedral units (see Fig. 2a–c),78 but differ in the distortion of the octahedral units and in the manner of edge and corner sharing. For example, anatase TiO2 presents a distorted octahedral coordination (Oh), in which each titanium atom is enclosed by six oxygen atoms in an elongated octahedral geometry (D2d), belonging to the axial symmetry. As for the rutile phase, there are additional in-plane (equatorial) and out-of-plane (axial) bond lengths as well as bond angle distortions. Meanwhile the brookite phase has stronger distortions resulting in local symmetry loss and formation of C1-symmetric TiO6 units. Therefore, the composition of crystalline phases, including anatase, rutile and brookite, can be characterized by periodic arrangements of distorted TiO6 octahedral units. Notably, the microstructure and electronic structure of am-TiO2 cannot be ignored because of its special physicochemical properties in photocatalysis. In general, the amorphous phase is described by the partial loss of octahedral coordination and the disorder-induced formation of under- and over-coordinated Ti ions.79,80 The atomic arrangement in am-TiO2 might be described as an assembly of short staggered chains of edge and vertex linked Ti–O octahedral-like units (see Fig. 2d).79 It has been demonstrated that when the percentage of edge to vertex linked octahedral units in am-TiO2 was less than 50%, it would lead to phase-evolution into rutile after thermal treatment.81 Prasai et al. established different am-TiO2 models (two with 96 atoms and one with 192 atoms) through a “melt–quench” method on the basis of the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP).82 According to the calculation results, they found that most of the Ti and O atoms tended to be six-fold and three-fold coordinated, respectively, exhibiting a similar local structure to crystalline TiO2 (including anatase and rutile structures). Additionally, the electronic structure of am-TiO2 was similar to the crystalline ones in many aspects, especially being much closer to the anatase phase. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis demonstrated that the valence tail states originated from the positional disorder of O atoms, while the conduction tail states stemmed from over-coordinated Ti atoms; thus the tail states near the band edges were limited in am-TiO2 in contrast to the crystalline phase. Significantly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also confirmed the effects of size on the structure of an amorphous model at 350 K through the partial radial distribution functions, coordination number distributions, bond-angle distributions and interatomic distances.83 The authors found that the mean coordination number for all atomic pairs would enhance with increasing the size of nanoparticles. When the size of the model is larger than 3 nm, am-TiO2 nanoparticles have distorted octahedral TiO6 units linking via the edge or via a common vertex with the mean coordination number ZTi–O ≈ 6.0 and ZO–Ti ≈ 3.0 like those found in the bulk. Furthermore, it has been shown that the amorphous model had a core/shell structure, in which the surface shells of amorphous nanoparticles were TiO5 units, but the cores were TiO6 units.

Amorphous materials are thermodynamically metastable phases, so they can evolve into the crystalline phase under special conditions. A better understanding of the reaction parameters that contribute to the phase transformation is necessary for practical applications. A well-known strategy for achieving the transformation from amorphous to crystalline is the heat treatment route, especially for the formation of the anatase phase.84–86 Notably, the phase-controlled synthesis of crystalline TiO2 can be achieved by hydrothermal treatment at elevated temperatures with appropriate reactants. For example, narrow-sized anatase TiO2 with a regular crystalline surface was synthesized by autoclaving am-TiO2 in the presence of HF and HCl. Moreover, am-TiO2 was transformed into phase-pure rutile TiO2 nanocrystals by autoclaving in the presence of citric and nitric acids.87 In this synthesis, the authors believed that the evolution of am-TiO2 to phase-pure anatase or rutile was attributed to the face-sharing and edge-sharing processes by the dissolution–precipitation of dissolved TiO6 octahedral units of the amorphous phase. Additionally, Reyes-Coronado et al. have reported the synthesis of phase-pure TiO2 nanocrystals with anatase, rutile and brookite structures by a hydrothermal treatment strategy using am-TiO2 as a starting material.88 For instance, anatase TiO2 was prepared in the presence of acetic acid, while phase-pure rutile and brookite TiO2 were formed in the presence of hydrochloric acid at different concentrations. In this study, the authors proposed that the formation of anatase TiO2 was dominated by surface energy effects, while the formation of rutile and brookite followed a dissolution–precipitation mechanism, where chains of six-fold-coordinated titanium complexes arrange into different crystal structures depending on the reactant chemistry.88 Interestingly, a step-by-step crystallization of am-TiO2 can be achieved by a photoinduced strategy.89 Therefore, it is believed that novel am-TiO2-based hetero-phase junction photocatalysts, including anatase/amorphous, rutile/amorphous and their mixed forms, can be designed and fabricated by rationally integrating the above synthetic strategies.
2.2 Optical properties
In theory, the optical properties of am-TiO2 can be computed and characterized by dielectric functions.82 The calculated real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions for the anatase TiO2, rutile TiO2 and am-TiO2 phases are displayed in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the density of am-TiO2 is much closer to that of anatase TiO2, and the real and the imaginary parts of the dielectric functions for am-TiO2 and anatase TiO2 closely resemble each other except for a few minor differences, leading to similar optical properties between these phases owing to their similar electronic structures. However, rutile TiO2 has clearly different characteristics from the above-mentioned two phases in both the real and imaginary parts, because of its different electronic structure as compared to those phases. It should be noted that the optical properties of isotropic am-TiO2 are independent from the direction of the incident light, while the optical properties are strongly dependent on the direction of the incoming polarized light because the tetragonal cells of rutile and anatase are quite anisotropic. Therefore, the optical properties of am-TiO2 involve the following three aspects.

Amorphous TiO2 can serve as an active component for enhancing light harvesting in the visible and near-infrared region owing to the lattice disorder and its synergistic effect with the element doping strategy. As a well-known issue, light harvesting of TiO2 photocatalysts in the ultraviolet region hinders their photocatalytic performance because of their wide band gap (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile). Although doping is an efficient strategy to extend the spectral response of TiO2 in the visible light region, the absorption in the near-infrared region is still a challenge and the photo-stability of the doped TiO2 is not satisfactory. Recently, disorder engineering has been theoretically demonstrated as a promising route to optimize the absorption efficiency of TiO2 in the visible and near-infrared region by introducing middle gap states. Inspired by the black Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with wide optical absorption spectra, high absorption efficiency and stability, it is believed that amorphous Ti3+-doped TiO2 with more defects might possess intermediate band states to provide wide range absorption in the solar spectrum from the visible to infrared region. Pan et al. have found that a full transformation from crystalline TiO2 rutile to amorphous nanospheres can be accomplished through high-intensity and long-time ultraviolet laser irradiation in water, as illustrated in Fig. 4a.90 In particular, it can be clearly seen that the absorption spectrum of the amorphous Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanospheres displays a wide absorption band at 670–880 nm, as shown in curve 2 of Fig. 4b, which can be associated with the absorption of extra photons of the valence band maximum (VBM)/intermediate band (IB) and IB/conduction band minimum (CBM) transition. However, the pristine TiO2 rutile nanoparticles without UV laser illumination possess a typical semiconductor feature with an absorption threshold of about 410 nm and low absorption in the visible and near-infrared region as shown in curve 1 of Fig. 4b. Hence, it indicates that the visible and near-infrared response of the amorphous Ti3+-doped TiO2 can be improved substantially. Moreover, simultaneously integrating lattice disorder and nitridation in am-TiO2 not only enables the enhancement of the dopant solubility but also yields rich band tail states, thus leading to a notable extension of the spectral response and energy-transfer process. Xu et al. have reported that nitrided am-TiO2 doped with lanthanide ions can be used as a novel broadband down-conversion phosphor capable of transforming the X-ray and ultra-violet photons in the 200–400 nm wavelength region into visible light with high efficiency.91 Hybrid density functional theory (DFT) confirms that N-anchoring is mediated by coordinative Ti–N bonding between the N lone pairs and the Ti4+ center, which offers a relay station to bound the photogenerated electron–hole pair and restrain their rapid recombination, finally leading to highly-efficient energy-transfer and subsequent radiative transition. Fig. 4c and d schematically display the proposed structure and related carrier generation/relaxation processes. Therefore, these findings are significant not only to cognize the fundamental doping process in the amorphous structure but also to offer a new platform for the construction of broadband photon-harvesting materials.91

Amorphous TiO2 can act as a substrate to improve surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) because of its special energy band structure. For instance, it has been reported that the am-TiO2 film showed the highest reflectivity in the visible region as well as a higher specific surface area for strong adsorption of organic dye molecules compared to crystalline TiO2 films. When the film was loaded with Au nanoparticles, the SERS effect was significantly enhanced by more than one order of magnitude.92 Similarly, it was found that am-TiO2 nanotubes (A-TNT)/Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) provided highly improved SERS signals as compared to crystalline TiO2 nanotube (C-TNT)/AgNP nanostructures. Fig. 4e displays the UV–visible absorption spectra and SERS spectra of photonic amorphous and crystalline TiO2 nanotubes with and without Ag NPs. It can be seen that the A-TNT sample had a sharp optical absorption band gap edge at about 360 nm, which was red-shifted for the A-TNT/AgNP sample because of the coupling effect of plasmonic and photonic interference. But the C-TNT sample had an optical absorption band gap edge at about 380 nm, which was slightly red-shifted for C-TNT/AgNPs. As shown in Fig. 4f, sharp SERS main peaks owing to Rhodamine 6G (R6G) detection were found at 1310, 1362, and 1514 cm−1 on the (A-TNT)-AgNP sample by using a 785 nm laser at an integration time of 10 seconds. The authors have demonstrated the crystallinity effects of TNT with AgNPs on the SERS performance. The oscillating electrons at the plasmonic AgNPs could offer improved local electromagnetic fields for a much longer time compared to those on C-TNT due to the high barrier and band alignment at the interface between photonic crystal A-TNT and plasmonic AgNPs, thus leading to the high SERS performance.93 Based on the above discussions, it is suggested that am-TiO2 is a useful substrate for constructing plasmonic-integrated SERS devices.
Besides the above-mentioned role of an active photocatalyst or a substrate, am-TiO2 can also act as a protection layer for coating conventional photoelectrodes for corrosion protection in photo-induced water splitting due to the formation of photogenerated holes on the surface.94 During this reaction process, it can conduct photogenerated holes to transport to the surface owing to the defect disorder in am-TiO2. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of such hole conduction in am-TiO2 is not clearly uncovered. Fortunately, Pham et al. have systematically reported the electronic properties, polaronic states and hole conduction mechanism of am-TiO2 by means of DFT with Hubbard's energy correction and compared them to those of crystalline TiO2 rutile.79 They have found that the long-range disorder and imperfect coordination of Ti and O do not generate defect states in the band gap but have effects on the localization of band edge states. Therefore, am-TiO2 has a clean band gap but no tail density of state. Furthermore, the structural disorder of am-TiO2 leads to a substantial decrease of oxygen vacancy formation energy; thus the oxygen vacancies in am-TiO2 are much more abundant than those in its crystalline counterparts.95 The oxygen vacancy is a deep donor in am-TiO2 and can promote hole transport. In particular, the oxygen defect state could act as a hole transfer channel above the VBM and be responsible for the good conductivity, which is comparable to previous experimental observations.94 Based on the above literature, it is believed that the oxygen vacancies and defect states in am-TiO2 can provide hopping channels for promoting photochemical applications.
3. Morphology-controlled synthesis
It is known that morphological tuning of amorphous nanomaterials is difficult. The formation of amorphous nanomaterials is rule-less owing to their complex internal structures, generally leading to irregular particles using aqueous-phase methods or thin films using deposition techniques as their common shapes. There have been four kinds of am-TiO2 nanostructures investigated for potential applications,96–144 which are usually classified according to their geometry configurations into 1-dimensional (1-D) nanotube arrays, 2-dimensional (2-D) thin films, 3-dimensional (3-D) spheres and 0-dimensional (0-D) irregular nanoparticles. Highly ordered am-TiO2 nanotube arrays can play an important role as photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical applications owing to their special architectures for excellent superamphiphilicity.107 Amorphous TiO2 thin films usually prevent corrosion of substrates and generate electronic defects that promote hole conduction, thus providing an opportunity to stabilize a host of narrow band-gap semiconductors for use in oxidative photochemistry.94 Spherical am-TiO2 structures, especially the doped ones, have been synthesized due to their high light-absorption efficiency.90 Nanoparticulate am-TiO2 structures generally consisting of an interconnected network of nanometer-sized particles are widely applied as active components for photoelectrochemical applications, offering relatively large specific surface areas and good adsorption ability to photo-sensitizers.130–144 In this section, we will briefly introduce the morphologies and synthesis methods involving am-TiO2 nanostructures based on the reported literature, including nanotube arrays, thin films, spheres and irregular nanoparticles (see Table 1).

3.1 Nanotube arrays
Anodic oxidation is the most widely utilized synthesis route to prepare am-TiO2 nanotube arrays.96–106 The formation of nanotube arrays follows three simultaneous processes: (i) the electrochemical oxidation of Ti metal to generate TiO2, (ii) the electric field assisted dissolution of Ti metal ions in the electrolyte, and (iii) the chemical dissolution of TiO2 owing etching.2 The pH value of electrolytes is crucial for the control of the length of am-TiO2 nanotube arrays by tailoring the etching rate. For example, the maximum nanotube length was about 500 nm in an acidic HF aqueous bath because of the rapid dissolution rate of TiO2. Meanwhile the formation of longer nanotubes up to 5 μm can result from synthesis in a weak acid solution at pH between 3 and 5, such as KF or NaF, which was attributed to the reduction of the TiO2 chemical dissolution rate.145 Notably, high aspect ratio nanotubes can be facilely synthesized in a buffered neutral solution as the electrolyte. As an example, (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte with NH4F was employed as the buffered neutral solution to grow 2.3 μm nanotube arrays.96 To further decrease the dissolution rate of newly synthesized am-TiO2 and to increase the nanotube length, the traditional aqueous solution was generally replaced with organic electrolytes including formamide and ethylene glycol. For example, highly ordered and close packed TiO2 nanotube arrays several micrometers in length were formed in an electrolyte containing NH4F and ethylene glycol (see Fig. 5).106 Besides the nanotube length, the diameter, shape and wall thickness of the nanotubes have also been controlled by adjusting the anodization parameters such as potential, anodic temperature and time. It should be noted that the above fluoride-containing electrolytes are toxic and generally cause safety issues. Therefore, many efforts were made to optimize anodic oxidation by using fluoride-free, environmentally friendly electrolytes for the growth of am-TiO2 nanotubes. However, the fluoride-free synthesis of am-TiO2 nanotube arrays is still in its infancy.

Fortunately, a new approach for fabricating hierarchical am-TiO2 nanocolumn arrays was reported by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a polystyrene (PS) colloidal monolayer as a template.107 The detailed synthesis strategy is described as follows. First, the monolayer PS templates were synthesized on the substrate by spin coating. Then the desired material was deposited on PS templates by PLD at room temperature in an oxygen atmosphere, in which rutile TiO2 was used as the target. Subsequently, hierarchical am-TiO2 nanocolumn arrays with a hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) arrangement were formed (see Fig. 6a). It can be found that the nanocolumn stands vertically on the PS sphere tops, and nanobranches in each nanocolumn grow in a radiation-like manner, perpendicular to the PS sphere surface (see Fig. 6b and c). Significantly, such a nanocolumn array could be transferred to any desired substrate (e.g., TEM copper grid) and still keep its integrity. Finally, the hollow am-TiO2 nanocolumn arrays were fabricated when the PS colloidal monolayer was dissolved in an organic solution (see Fig. 6d). The growth mechanism of the hierarchical am-TiO2 nanocolumn arrays is demonstrated in Fig. 6e. As shown from top to bottom, it can be clearly seen that there is only a film composed of vertical nanocolumns of small diameter when a bare substrate is applied in the PLD process. However, when a single PS sphere anchored on the substrate, a composite of the PS sphere at the bottom and a shell composed of radiation-shaped nanobranches on top of the sphere would generate owing to the preferential vertical growth along the normal direction of the supporting surface and multidirectional deposition. When there is more than one sphere (such as two spheres) on the substrate, a shadow effect would appear in the deposition between any two neighboring spheres. When one sphere in the sphere-cluster was wholly surrounded by other six spheres as in the case of hcp alignment, one nanocolumn would be formed on the top of this sphere due to the stacking effect. Similarly, the as-synthesized nanocolumns in an ordered array were each composed of a PS sphere at the bottom and a nanocolumn on the top of the PS sphere, as shown in Fig. 6b and c. Interestingly, when the PS colloidal monolayer was dissolved with an organic solution (CH2Cl2), this ordered nanocolumn array could still retain its integrity because of the van der Waals force between the neighboring nanocolumns suspended in the solution. Thus, it could then be transferred to any desired substrate (e.g., TEM copper grid) by picking it up using another substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 6f. Hence, the above-presented strategy is a universal fabrication method of nanocolumn arrays using different materials.

3.2 Thin films
For solar fuel production, although semiconductors such as silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium phosphide (GaP) have band gaps that make them efficient photoanodes, they are unstable in aqueous media. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an efficient strategy to prevent photo-corrosion. Among coatings, am-TiO2 thin films have been confirmed to be an available candidate, which possess electronic defects that promote hole conduction to protect the substrate from corrosion.94 A general approach for the synthesis of am-TiO2 thin films for improved photoelectrochemical performance is atomic layer deposition (ALD).108–115 A typical ALD process occurs in a homemade thermal ALD system. No special treatment was needed to pre-clean the substrate surface before am-TiO2 deposition. Fig. 7a shows the use of a thin (25 nm) n-type (n) amorphous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer grown by ALD on a p-type/intrinsic (p/i) a-SiC photocathode (110 nm) to construct a hetero p–i–n junction.115 In this synthesis, the am-TiO2 ALD layer was fabricated at a substrate temperature of 150 °C by using tetrakis(dimethylamino) titanium, TDMAT, and water as the Ti and O precursors, respectively. The pulsing times were 5 s and 10 ms for Ti and O precursors, respectively. This experimental investigation also demonstrated that am-TiO2 could be used as an n-type layer for heterojunction thin-film-Si-based photoelectrodes.

The dip coating method is an alternative access to prepare tailored coatings on the surface of the substrate and a series of novel nanostructures can be successfully fabricated, such as hierarchical and multi-shelled TiO2 nanotube arrays (see Fig. 7b).118 In this synthesis, ethanol and water are needed for selective adsorption and to control the hydroxyls of Ti complexes, and then Ti complexes are hydrolyzed into am-TiO2. Subsequently, the substrate was successively dipped into an am-TiO2 sol, and the deposition rate and shell thickness of TiO2 were effectively controlled by varying the immersion time or coating cycles of the dipping procedure. Notably, the properties of the substrate also determined the formation of am-TiO2 coatings. Moreover, the am-TiO2 shells can be deposited on commercial Si nanoparticles via a kinetics-controlled sol–gel coating approach using titanium isopropylate as a precursor in an alkaline alcohol system (see Fig. 7c).120 Notably, titanium isopropylate exhibited a much slower hydrolysis rate in pure ethanol solution, leading to the uniform growth of am-TiO2. In addition, the thin films of am-TiO2 would be coated onto the noble metal nanoparticles according to electrostatic attraction. In this synthesis, Au nanostructures with surfactants on their surface were formed initially, and then they would capture the TiCl3 precursors, subsequently leading to the hydrolysis of TiCl3via tuning of pH or the reaction solution with NaHCO3; thus the Ti3+ ion was catalytically oxidized on the surface of Au nanostructures to generate am-TiO2. As shown in Fig. 7d,122 each Au nanostructure was covered by am-TiO2 with a thickness of about 30 nm.
3.3 Spheres
It is well-known that an amorphous solid is described by the model of a perfectly random structure which is closely similar to the structure of a liquid phase. Hence, the water molecule is more accessible to the amorphous material to form hydrate water and adsorbed water,146 leading to the good adsorption of water-soluble organic molecules, especially for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. Thus, it is necessary to synthesize monodisperse porous am-TiO2 nanostructures. However, structure tailoring, especially morphological control of porous am-TiO2 nanomaterials, is very difficult. Because of its complex internal structure, the growth of am-TiO2 is generally rule-less, leading to irregular nanoparticles using solution approaches or thin films using deposition techniques as their conventional shape. Sphere is one of the most reported amorphous metal oxide nanostructures.147 However, mesoporous am-TiO2 spheres are rarely reported. In 2012, Jiang et al. demonstrated that 3-D net-like am-TiO2 with well-defined spherical morphology and uniform pore size can be prepared in a mixture of titanium(IV) isopropoxide/hexadecylamine/ethanol/KCl/water.124 As shown in Fig. 8, monodispersed am-TiO2 nanospheres with 200–300 nm diameters were successfully formed, and they have a loose and porous cotton-like structure, which has interconnected pores with a size of 2–3 nm. So far, the investigation on mesoporous am-TiO2 is still in infancy, so more efforts should be made in this field.

3.4 Irregular nanoparticles
The exploration of TiO2 materials with large specific surface areas is thus highly desired because the energy conversion from solar fuel to chemical bonding energy usually happens at photoelectrode surfaces. Nanoparticulate TiO2 is a common building block in photocatalysts and dye-sensitized solar cells.132,148 As an example, Grätzel et al. have made a great contribution to dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells by systematically studying the effects of nanoparticle size, morphologies, film thickness, etc. on solar energy conversion efficiencies.148 They demonstrated that the excellent power conversion efficiency was due to the ultra-fast charge transfer from the dye to TiO2 particles, high specific surface areas, large amounts of loaded dyes, and efficient separation of opposite charge carriers to different materials. Inspired by their excellent performances in dye-sensitized solar cells, nanoparticulate TiO2 structures were subsequently introduced into photoelectrochemical applications, and the special mechanism of action of nanoparticulate am-TiO2 has also attracted more attention in the past decade. So far, the synthesis strategy of nanoparticulate am-TiO2 mainly involved chemical precipitation, hydrolysis, sol–gel methods, electrodeposition and impulse plasma methods.130–144 The detailed synthesis pathways are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, it should be noted that nanoparticulate am-TiO2 usually acts as an active component anchored onto the substrate to enhance the activity through engineered interfaces. Therefore, the modification of am-TiO2 such as by doping or morphology control might be valuable for further optimizing the photoelectrochemical performance.
As reviewed above, am-TiO2 nanostructures with morphologies of nanotube arrays, thin films, spheres and irregular nanoparticles have been prepared by anodic oxidation, atomic layer deposition, sol–gel methods, chemical precipitation, hydrolysis routes and so on. However, the previous studies merely involve a small part of morphologies; thus there is a giant space left for uncovering new synthesis strategies to obtain novel well-defined shapes, such as hollow nanostructures. Based on previous work, the introduction of hard templates into solution-based systems might be convenient for the fabrication of regular-shaped hollow nanostructures.149 Notably, the size-controlled synthesis of regular-shaped am-TiO2, especially ultrathin monodisperse nanoparticles (size < 100 nm), is extremely urgent. Therefore, more and more efforts should be made to explore the synthesis of novel am-TiO2 nanostructures with controllable surface characteristics for uncovering the relationship between structures and photochemical activities.
4. Photocatalytic applications of am-TiO2-based nanostructures
Fundamental mechanisms concerning the photocatalytic processes, including photoinduced charge generation, separation, and surface reactions, were widely investigated in previous studies.4,21 The recognition of these processes is of utmost importance for the understanding of the photocatalytic reaction, and thus achieving a better design of photocatalysts with excellent photocatalytic performance. In a typical photocatalysis process, when the energy of the incident light is larger than the band gap of the semiconductor, it can excite an electron to the conduction band, generating a positive hole in the valence band. Subsequently, charge carriers would be trapped by the defect sites in the catalyst, or they can recombine immediately. Alternatively, the charge carriers would migrate to the surface and initiate a series of redox reactions with adsorbates.8 For example, in a photodegradation reaction, positive holes can oxidize OH− ions or water at the surface of the catalyst to produce ˙OH radicals, which are extremely powerful oxidants. In addition, electrons tend to be rapidly trapped by molecular oxygen adsorbed on the catalyst, which are reduced to form another superoxide radical anion (˙O2−). Thus, the reactions of these active oxygen radicals can promote the decomposition of organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O.11 For photocatalytic water splitting, water molecules are oxidized by holes to form O2 and reduced by electrons to form H2.17 Moreover, the photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and photocatalytic organic synthesis also involve these processes.24 Therefore, it is imperative to prevent the recombination of electron–hole pairs before the desired redox reaction. Notably, it has been confirmed that charge separation is very sensitive to various physicochemical properties, such as particle size and shape, crystallinity, crystal phase, and so forth.30,36,49,60 When efficient charge separation of the electron–hole pairs leads to migration of the charges to the particle surface, it will enable oxidation and reduction reactions.
Compared with crystalline TiO2 phases, am-TiO2 by itself presents relatively poor photocatalytic activity such as in hydrogen production due to its high density of atomic defects.150 However, the photodegradation activity of am-TiO2 is usually much better than that of the crystalline one.75 In particular, its high specific surface area and large number of surface reaction sites make am-TiO2 an excellent substrate and/or active component in modified composites. Notably, the photocatalytic performance of bare am-TiO2 was limited because of the lack of an energy barrier for prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers.76,90,95 According to the current literatures, the photocatalytic applications of am-TiO2 nanostructures mainly involve doping and hybridization systems.117,131,137,142,143,151–168 Therefore, in this section, in order to comprehensively understand the photocatalytic applications of am-TiO2 nanostructures, we highlight the utilizations of am-TiO2-based nanostructures (including bare am-TiO2, heteroatom-doped am-TiO2, and TiO2-semiconductor hybrids) in the fields of photocatalytic water splitting,117,137,142,151–153 photo-reduction of CO2,131 and photodegradation of organic dyes.89,107,156–168
4.1 Photocatalytic water splitting

4.1.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
Construction of heterostructures has been recognized as an effective route for improving the photocatalytic performance of am-TiO2. The nanostructured noble metals, presenting a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in response to visible light, have been a topic of wide concern. Hence, the LSPR-induced rate enhancements in composite photocatalysts depend on the geometric arrangements of the noble metal and semiconductor. As an example, composites of Ag nanoparticles with ethylene glycol (EG) stabilized am-TiO2 synthesized in aqueous solution of different pH values were reported by Liang et al.137 It is excitingly found that mere am-TiO2 with a high defect density employed as a photocatalyst hardly displays hydrogen evolution activity, but the Ag/am-TiO2 composite has a much higher photocatalytic efficiency than the Ag/crystalline TiO2 composites. In particular, when irradiated by a 300 W xenon lamp, Ag/TiO2-3 (the sample synthesized at pH 3) has the greatest photocatalytic activity and about 102.1 mmol g−1 of hydrogen gas can be generated after 4 h of illumination, as shown in Fig. 9a. The enhanced photocatalytic performance mainly results from the strong LSPR effect of Ag nanoparticles and the efficient transfer of radiation energies through the short channels provided by the thin EG spacers (Fig. 9b). This report opens a new avenue to produce highly efficient photochemical catalysts through EG-regulated spacing between plasmonic metals and amorphous semiconductors. However, we still know little about am-TiO2/noble metal-based materials, such as am-TiO2/Au, am-TiO2/Cu and am-TiO2/Ag–AgX (X = Cl, Br and I), so more attention should be paid to the particle size, shape, composition, refractive index of the surrounding medium, and interparticle spacing for enhanced LSPS photocatalysts.

Coupling am-TiO2 and a semiconductor to fabricate a heterojunction is another approach to address the drawbacks of am-TiO2 for application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. For example, Lee et al. have coated a thin layer of am-TiO2 on CdSe nanocrystals (denoted as CdSe/am-TiO2).117 The hydrogen evolution rate of CdSe/am-TiO2 is comparable with that of composites made of quantum dots and various crystalline metal oxides. The authors attributed the high performance of CdSe/am-TiO2 to the efficient charge separation induced by the staggered type-II band offset, which was proposed by the analysis of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (see Fig. 9c). The type II band offset in CdSe/am-TiO2 allowed the electrons in the conduction band of CdSe to migrate to that of am-TiO2, while the holes remained in the valence band of CdSe. In water splitting, the electrons in the conduction band of CdSe participated in hydrogen production, whereas Na2S and Na2SO3 scavenged the holes in the valence band of CdSe, therefore preventing the surface oxidation of CdSe, as shown in Fig. 9d. Therefore, the introduction of am-TiO2 nanoshells can hinder charge recombination, facilitate charge separation and reduce charge transfer resistance, finally leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Similarly, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of CdS@TiO2 reaches up to 47.5 mmol g−1 h−1, which is better than those reported for one-dimensional CdS-based counterparts.143 Therefore, it is believed that the controllable coating of an am-TiO2 ultrathin layer onto the active species is an efficient way for the construction of highly enhanced photocatalysts. Moreover, it should be noted that anchoring active components with controllable surfaces on specific sites of am-TiO2 should attract extensive attention, and uncovering the relationship between interfaces and photocatalytic performances is still a primary aim. In particular, it is imperative to take into consideration the synthesis of multicomponent am-TiO2-based hetero-phase junctions for exploring novel photocatalysts, such as anatase/amorphous, rutile/amorphous and their mixed and/or doped forms. Significantly, the theoretical calculations involving the electronic structures of am-TiO2 and interfacial structures of am-TiO2 based hybrids should be further studied to really uncover the photocatalytic mechanisms.


4.1.2 Photocatalytic oxygen evolution. 
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is another potential strategy to use solar energy to produce “solar fuels”. Based on theoretical calculations, it has been found that O–O peroxy linkages were generated in pristine am-TiO2 upon injection of excess holes, and gave a defect distribution centered above the valence band, leading to hole diffusion in am-TiO2 through an exchange mechanism.151 Therefore, am-TiO2 can be used as a stabilizer to conduct composite photoanodes for water oxidation to oxygen gas in aqueous alkaline electrolytes.152 For example, as an effective passivator, am-TiO2 has been used to modify the surface states and PEC water oxidation activity of the WO3 nanoflake film photoanode.153 The photocurrent on the am-TiO2/WO3 film photoanode reaches 1.4 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at 0.8 V (vs. SCE), improved by a factor of 2 in comparison with that of the bare WO3 film (see Fig. 9e). To check the surface state changes on WO3 with am-TiO2 coupling, the surface energy and bond length of am-TiO2/WO3(002) were calculated, and a much lower surface energy (0.3 J m−2) and changed Ti–O bond lengths were obtained. According to the experimental and calculation results, the enhanced PEC water oxidation performance is attributed to the passivated surface states of WO3 through the O2−–W6+ bonding effect at the am-TiO2/WO3 interface. As a result, the formation of H2O2 from the photoexcited electron-dissolved oxygen route was depressed and the PEC oxidation of H2O2 was accelerated, as shown in Fig. 9f. Therefore, am-TiO2/WO3 composites have remarkably enhanced PEC water oxidation activity and stability.
In addition, Eisenberg et al. have reported that electrodeposition of am-TiO2 on the W:BiVO4/FTO electrode resulted in markedly improved PEC performance toward the oxidation of water (Fig. 9g).142 The optimal thickness of the am-TiO2 overlayer needs a balance of sufficient surface coverage and minimal resistance to transfer charge to the solution. The photo-anodes deposited with an optimal thickness of am-TiO2 (deposition times of 15–30 s, charge passed 1.8–3.6 mC cm−2) shifted the onset potential negatively by about 500 mV, increased the water oxidation photocurrent by up to a factor of 5.5, and enhanced the fill factor from 23 to 44%. The contribution of the am-TiO2 overlayer to PEC enhancement is attributed to electron–hole surface recombination (Fig. 9h, processes b and c) and solution-mediated recombination at surface defects (Fig. 9h, processes b and d) and at exposed regions of the conductive substrate (Fig. 9h, processes b and e). It should be highlighted that the merit of the am-TiO2 overlayer was not photo-active, which can be attributed to blocking of surface recombination and to solution-mediated recombination at surface defects and at exposed regions of the conductive substrate. This research may be of benefit to a wide range of photocatalytic systems and devices since many semiconductor thin-film electrodes are discontinuous.

4.2 Photo-reduction of CO2
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals has gained extensive interest due to great concerns on the shortage of fossil fuels and the global warming problem. Wang et al. reported a novel synthetic method for C-doped am-TiO2 (CAT) using a facile citric acid assisted sol–gel method for efficient photo-reduction of CO2.131Fig. 10a and b display the photocatalytic activity of T-300 (the sample calcined at 300 °C without the addition of citric acid) and CAT samples under solar light and visible light irradiation. It has been found that the as-synthesized amorphous material exhibits a mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area and an obvious narrowed band gap of 2.1 eV, which are significant for solar light harvesting and adsorption/chemical activation of CO2 for energy conversion. Furthermore, the amorphization, mesoporous structure, and band structure of the CAT samples can also be successfully controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature. In particular, the CAT-300 sample (the CAT sample calcined at 300 °C) shows the highest activity for CO2 reduction with a space–time yield (STY) of CH4 and CO of 2.9 and 2.1 mmol g−1 h−1 under solar light irradiation, because it has the highest specific surface area, favorable visible-light response and considerable performance for photo-reduction of CO2. Additionally, the introduction of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ species into the CAT-300 sample by an aluminum reduction method can efficiently accelerate the separation and transportation of photogenerated hole–electron pairs, and thus significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 10c and d, the STY of CH4 and CO reaches 4.1 and 2.5 mmol g−1 h−1 under solar light, and 0.53 and 0.63 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation, respectively. Notably, the investigation of am-TiO2 based nanostructures for photo-reduction of CO2 is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is necessary to employ more efforts into the synthesis of multicomponent am-TiO2-based hetero-junctions for developing new photocatalysts.

4.3 Photodegradation of organic dyes
As discussed above, since am-TiO2 nanostructures can exhibit high specific surface areas as well as defects with various morphologies, they have also been regarded as one of the most promising photocatalysts for pollutants in waste water.154,155 Li et al. reported that hexagonal-close-packed am-TiO2 nanocolumn arrays have performed much better in photodegradation of stearic acid under UV illumination than an anatase nanocolumn (see Fig. 11a).107 The enhanced performance was attributed to the large surface area and special hierarchical structures composed of radiation-shaped nanobranches. A photoinduced crystallization–activation mechanism was also investigated through the degradation of methylene blue.89 The am-TiO2 would gradually transform into a core–shell amorphous-rutile structure under photoirradiation. The core/shell structure narrowed the bandgap and was enriched with surface-active sites. Besides, the electrons could migrate from the shell to the core, while the holes would remain in the shell, leading to the enhancement of the photoactivity. Based on the above mechanism, a homogeneous structure composed of mixed amorphous–crystalline TiO2 will effectively enhance the performance of photocatalysis.156–159 The mixed TiO2 exhibited a much better photocatalytic activity in deaerated aqueous suspensions due to the combined adsorption/photocatalytic mechanism.157 It was found that the introduction of the anatase phase would help adjust the amount of Ti3+, an important surface species that could promote the generation of photo-reduced holes and hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Notably, the anatase or rutile phase can be easily transformed from am-TiO2 through calcination, allowing a controllable composition of the final product. A H2O2-sensitized method was proposed since H2O2 was regarded as a vital factor in the photodegradation. Zou et al. successfully synthesized an am-TiO2 sol sensitized by H2O2, exhibiting good photocatalytic performance under visible light.132 About 90% discoloration was acquired for amorphous-H2O2 sols, while only about 13% degradation for the amorphous sol in the same time. This could be attributed to the generated hydroxyl radicals that could degrade methyl blue solely. Besides, the added H2O2 would serve as an external electron acceptor that could reduce the recombination of charge carriers as well as adsorb on the TiO2 surface to form surface peroxide complexes, resulting in a higher visible photo-response.

Besides, doped am-TiO2 presents an enhanced photocatalytic activity owing to the modified electronic properties.160–162 Shao et al. investigated the photoactivity of carbon-doped am-TiO2 by degradation of RhB and 4-chlorophenol.160 The acceptor impurity energy level was formed above the valence band maximum caused by the interstitial doping of carbon, reducing the energy required for electronic transition and improving the visible light absorption (see Fig. 11b). Metal ions could be also doped into am-TiO2. Buddee et al. prepared Cr- and Fe-doped am-TiO2 through a modified impregnation method.161 The as-prepared co-doped TiO2 showed photocatalytic activities for methyl blue degradation under both UV and visible light, which were much better than those of commercial TiO2. To further investigate the effect of doping on photocatalytic behavior, Ghuman et al. conducted a theoretical investigation of the effects of n-type, p-type and charge compensated co-doping on the electronic properties of amorphous TiO2.162 It was found that mono-doping am-TiO2 with either N or Nb led to a slight reduction in the bandgap as well as deep states in the bandgap. The interstitial mid-gap states would serve as a stepping stone for the absorption of low energy photons, leading to photoresponse to visible light. When co-doped with N and Nb atoms, the energy gap was greatly decreased and the recombination of electron–hole pairs could be hampered by eliminating the bandgap states and reducing the localization of energy states of the host TiO2.
Hybridization is a common strategy to optimize TiO2 to obtain a better photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. Due to the poor absorption of visible light of pure amorphous TiO2, semiconductors with small band gaps were coupled to generate electron–hole pairs.163–167 Liu et al. observed that the UV and visible light activities of am-TiO2 were drastically increased by the grafting of copper oxide amorphous clusters, while the amorphous catalyst solely exhibited negligible catalytic activity under UV light.163 As a consequence, the photocatalytic decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol (IPA) for the cocatalyst with a maximum generation rate of 0.20 μmol h−1 and a quantum efficiency of 10.8% was achieved under visible light irradiation. The CuO clusters would not only suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs at the isolated Ti3+ in the amorphous TiO2, but also serve as a co-catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction to consume the photo-induced electrons. Furthermore, Wang et al. synthesized heterojunctions comprising am-TiO2 coupled with the dominating {001} facets of BiOBr using an in situ microwave-assisted method according to the fact that am-TiO2 can serve as an electron acceptor and hence would limit the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs.164 The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) and phenol over the am-TiO2/BiOBr composite photocatalysts was tested under visible light irradiation, which indicated that the activity of 15% am-TiO2/BiOBr is 3.4 times that of pristine BiOBr. In this work, when BiOBr was excited by visible-light, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs were mainly distinguished along the [001] direction. Then, the (001) facets of BiOBr coupled with TiO2 rendered the electron transfer from BiOBr to the defect level of am-TiO2 much easier, leaving more holes on the valance band of BiOBr. Finally, the holes of BiOBr degraded the MO dye molecules directly. Moreover, the electrons on the defect levels of am-TiO2 were captured by oxygen to form ˙O2− radicals. A schematic diagram of the separation process of the photo-generated charges is given in Fig. 11c. Noble metal salts, such as AgI and H2PtCl6, were also used to modify the electronic properties of TiO2 photocatalysts.167,168 Microporous am-TiO2 modified with a few percent of a platinum(IV) halide was synthesized by a sol–gel procedure, which could catalyze the decomposition of 4-chlorophenol.168 Surprisingly, Pt(IV)/TiO2 catalyzed the photodegradation even under visible-light irradiation, which showed comparable performance with that in the UV region. The photocatalytic activity was believed to originate from the local excitation of the platinum(IV) chloride chromophore, affording a halogen atom and Pt(III) as intermediate species. Based on the above discussion, anchoring active components with controllable surfaces on am-TiO2 should attract much more attention, and determination of the underlying relationship between interfaces and photocatalytic performances through theoretical calculations is still a primary aim.
5. Conclusions and outlook
This review presents the available approaches to understand the structure, optical properties, morphology, synthetic strategies and photocatalytic applications of am-TiO2 nanostructures (see Fig. 12). The am-TiO2 nanostructures with morphologies of nanotube arrays, thin films, spheres and irregular nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by various methods including anodic oxidation, atomic layer deposition, sol–gel methods, chemical precipitation, hydrolysis routes and so on. Phase-pure TiO2 nanocrystals with anatase, rutile and brookite structures can be formed by different strategies (such as the hydrothermal method, heat treatment and photoinduced approach) using am-TiO2 as a starting material, which was attributed to the face-sharing and edge-sharing processes by dissolution–precipitation of dissolved TiO6 octahedral units of the thermodynamically metastable amorphous phase. In particular, the oxygen vacancies and defect states in am-TiO2 could act as hole transfer channels above the VBM and be responsible for the good conductivity, which provided hopping channels for promoting photochemical applications. Therefore, the characteristic electronic structure and disordered atomic arrangements endow am-TiO2 with unique physical and chemical properties. This can be divided into the following three aspects: (i) Amorphous TiO2 can act as an active component to promote light harvesting in the visible and near-infrared region owing to the lattice disorder and its synergistic effect with the element doping strategy. (ii) Amorphous TiO2 can act as a substrate to enhance SERS because of its special energy band structure. (iii) Amorphous TiO2 can also serve as a protection layer for coating conventional photoelectrodes for corrosion protection in photo-induced water splitting due to the selective formation of photogenerated holes on the surface of the substrate. However, the application of am-TiO2 in photoreduction of CO2 is rarely reported. Although an in-depth understanding of the role of am-TiO2 in the photocatalytic process is still in the infancy stage and there are some contradictory statements on the role related to the photocatalytic activity of am-TiO2, it has been confirmed that am-TiO2 is advantageous for a wide range of applications, including visible light response, enhanced SERS and charge separation.

Well-defined and regular-shaped amorphous nanostructures demonstrated comparable and sometimes even better activity than other conventional amorphous and crystalline nanomaterials, presenting their values for potential applications.147 In spite of the significant development of morphology-controlled synthesis of am-TiO2, further efforts are still required to rationally engineer the defects and interfaces in am-TiO2-based nanostructures, aiming to tailor the desired properties for morphology-related applications. As an example, hollow am-TiO2 is rarely synthesized besides the anodic oxidation of nanotube arrays, so it is necessary to employ more effort to develop novel strategies in this area. The introduction of hard templates (such as Cu2O and ZnO) into solution-based systems might be an efficient route for the synthesis of regular-shaped hollow architectures. Moreover, the size-controlled synthesis of regular-shaped am-TiO2, ultrathin monodisperse nanoparticles in particular (size < 100 nm), is imperative. Therefore, considerable efforts should be further made to explore the synthesis of novel am-TiO2 nanostructures with controllable surface characteristics for uncovering the relationship between structures and activities.
Apart from the morphology control of am-TiO2, functional modifications, such as doping and hybridization, are alternative efficient strategies for optimizing the performances of am-TiO2-based photocatalysts. For the doped am-TiO2 photocatalysts, the current literature concentrates mainly on nitrogen doping or oxygen vacancy modification, studies have not focused on other species of the dopant element, and the morphology- or sized-controlled syntheses of the doped ones should also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, co-doping of heteroatoms for synergistically improving the electronic structure of am-TiO2 is a rigorous challenge. Consequently, the development of doped precursors for the ALD method might be a promising strategy to achieve the controllable synthesis of doped am-TiO2 nanostructures. For am-TiO2-based hybridized photocatalysts, anchoring active components with controllable surfaces on specific sites of am-TiO2 should attract extensive attention, and uncovering the relationship between interfaces and photocatalytic performances is still a primary aim. Notably, it is necessary to pay more attention to the synthesis of multicomponent am-TiO2-based hetero-phase junctions for exploring novel photocatalysts, such as anatase/amorphous, rutile/amorphous and their mixed and/or doped forms. Importantly, the theoretical calculations involving the electronic structures of doped am-TiO2 and interfacial structures of am-TiO2-based hybrids should be investigated to actually understand the photocatalytic mechanisms.
In summary, the amorphous phase is a useful and essential member of the TiO2 family, which possesses unique physicochemical properties for enhanced photochemical applications. However, there is still plenty of space to investigate am-TiO2. In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed the characteristics, synthesis principles and photocatalytic applications based on reported studies, which provide a promising way to design more and more doped and hybrid am-TiO2-based nanostructures with controllable morphologies. Hopefully, this review would stimulate more attention in the development of novel am-TiO2-based nanostructures for overcoming the current environment- and energy-related challenges.
