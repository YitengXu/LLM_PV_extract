Moreover, increasingly stringent regulations towards effluent quality result in a growing interest in upgrading conventional wastewater treatment to reduce pollutant concentrations to acceptable levels. Among the wide range of treatment options, biological and ozone-based oxidation processes are already well defined for the degradation of chlorophenolic compounds. The main objective of this review is to highlight relevant knowledge gaps and research needs on chlorophenol degradation by applying biological and/or ozone-based oxidation techniques. The main research trends towards chlorophenol biodegradation are the use of specific cultures adapted to the pollutant and co-metabolic biodegradation. More recently, novel biological processes such as biomass immobilization and granular activated sludge were reported. These techniques possess the ability to protect the microorganisms from higher toxic pollutant concentrations. Only a few authors reported the use of mixed cultures and the effects of acclimated biomass to enhance the biodegradation process. However, conventional biological processes do not always achieve satisfactory results, opening the possibility for ozone-based oxidation technologies to degrade the refractory compounds into more biodegradable intermediates. The research objectives in many studies on chlorophenol ozonation consider the degradation of single pollutants and/or the enhancement of the oxidative potential using catalysts or UV light. Only a few attempts were reported investigating chlorophenol degradation in multiple substrate solutions. Also, the need for an additional toxicity and/or biodegradability assessment using microorganisms representative for activated sludge is clear; all the more when assessment of effects on a totally different microbial community is desired.Pieter Van AkenPieter Van Aken is a research fellow at the Process and Environmental Technology Lab within the Chemical Engineering Department of KU Leuven.

Water impact
Chlorophenol contamination is a serious threat to receiving water bodies. Hence, the treatment of chlorophenolic wastewater is critical. Both biological and ozone-based oxidation processes are well defined for chlorophenol degradation. By highlighting the state-of-the-art, the applicability of these techniques is shown. Furthermore, novel trends including immobilized biomass or the need for ozone degradation studies in multiple substrate solutions were identified.

1. Introduction
Because of industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities, significant amounts of toxic and hazardous pollutants are emitted to the environment. Most of these pollutants possess xenobiotic and recalcitrant properties, tend to bioaccumulate and show high persistence in the environment. Increased knowledge on the consequences of water pollution, diminishing water resources and industrial development has created the need for regulations.1 The European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) demands EU member states to prevent and reduce pollution, to promote sustainable water usage and to protect ecosystems. A list of priority substances was proposed (2455/2001/EC) and this was updated in subsequent Directives (2008/105/EC; 2013/39/EC). Furthermore, the US Environmental Protection Agency also published a similar list of 129 priority pollutants including several chlorophenolic pollutants.2
As a consequence, both effluent quality and quantity are subjected to increasingly stringent regulations, resulting in a growing interest in wastewater treatment to reduce pollutant concentrations to acceptable levels. However, the selection of the best treatment technology is complex. According to Oller et al., the choice to combine one or more wastewater treatment processes depends on the composition of the wastewater, the effluent standards to be met and the most effective treatment with the lowest reasonable cost.3 Despite their widespread application, conventional wastewater treatment technologies, such as biological processes, do not always achieve satisfactory purification results. The presence of toxic and/or recalcitrant pollutants can affect the biodegradation process, resulting in the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes, soil and groundwater, thereby creating a serious threat to ecosystems.
A classification of the pollutants affecting the biodegradation is proposed by Alvares et al. and Tabrizi and Mehrvar, i.e., recalcitrant and inhibitory pollutants.1,4 Recalcitrant pollutants are considered to be resistant to (aerobic) microbial degradation under favourable environmental conditions, whereas inhibitory pollutants, potentially biodegradable, present some degree of toxicity or activity inhibition to the bioculture.4,5 However, a clear classification is not always possible, e.g., since recalcitrant pollutants may accumulate, resulting in toxic concentrations. The extent to which the biological process is affected depends on the concentration, solubility and molecular complexity (e.g., chemical structure and number of substituents) of the pollutant.4,5 Because of the shortcomings of biological treatments, the recalcitrant pollutants are discharged and may accumulate in receiving waters. For this reason, the optimal functioning of ecosystems may be hindered.
In particular, chlorophenols (CP) pose a serious threat because of their widespread occurrence in soils, sediments, and surface and ground water.6 These pollutants and their derivatives are mutagenic, carcinogenic and immunogenic for humans and other organisms.7,8 Pollutants such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as possibly carcinogenic to humans.9
To decrease the toxicity to receiving water bodies, the treatment of chlorophenolic wastewater is critical. Several treatment technologies have already been investigated for the removal of chlorophenols from wastewater, such as activated carbon adsorption, volatilization, solvent extraction, chemical oxidation and aerobic/anaerobic biodegradation.10–14
Absorption and adsorption methods are based on a phase transfer of the chlorophenolic chemicals, requiring further treatment of the solvent or adsorbent. To achieve degradation of the pollutants (instead of concentrating them in a different phase), oxidative techniques are of great interest. Specific microbial cultures utilize some chlorophenols as their sole carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions.15,16 Furthermore, co-metabolic biodegradation of chlorophenolic pollutants can be successfully enhanced in the presence of a growth substrate such as glucose or phenol.17,18 Co-metabolism is the biological transformation of a non-growth substrate by non-specific enzymes of bacteria, by which the synthesis of these enzymes is only induced by a growth-substrate.19 Nevertheless, the biodegradation of chlorophenols is often very difficult because of the specific conditions or the long reaction time required.
In this context, advanced oxidation processes, and ozone-based techniques in particular, are considered an appropriate tool for the conversion of refractory compounds into more biodegradable intermediates.20 Indeed, because of the very high reaction rate of phenolate ions with ozone, ozonation appears to be a promising oxidation technique for the degradation of chlorophenolic pollutants.21 The dissociation of phenolic pollutants into phenolate ions occurs at pH values higher than the dissociation constant. The dissociation constants (pKa) of some chlorophenols are listed in Table 1. At these high pH values, the production of hydroxyl radicals is favoured. However, direct ozonation can also be important when the concentration of highly reactive species with molecular ozone is sufficiently high. Moreover, according to Benitez et al. and Hong and Zeng, the secondary hydroxyl radicals are likely to be involved in the subsequent degradation of intermediates.22,23

This review article critically discusses the developments in biological and ozone-based oxidation of chlorophenolic pollutants being reported in the scientific literature in the last two decades. An overview of experimental studies is listed to summarize the degradation pathways, recent innovations in reactor design, configuration strategies and process development. Also, different methodologies regarding biodegradability and toxicity assessment are discussed. The objective is to emphasize relevant knowledge gaps and research needs on chlorophenol degradation by applying biological and/or ozone-based oxidation techniques.
2. Characteristics of chlorophenolic pollutants
Chlorophenols are derivatives of phenol, which contain one or more covalently bound chlorine atoms. The common fragment in phenolic compounds is the hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic sp2-hybridized carbon atom, forming a strongly activating substituent.24 The group of chlorophenols contains 19 different congeners including mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and pentachlorophenol. Among these, mainly seven chlorophenols are applied in industry, i.e., monochlorophenol (MCP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol (2,3,4,5-TeCP), 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (2,3,4,6-TeCP) and PCP.6 Their physical properties are listed in Table 1.
Because both the hydroxyl group and aromatic ring can react via both electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution, chlorophenols are readily oxidizable. Hence, these chemical structures are versatile intermediates in chemical synthesis. For example, 2-CP, 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP are used as intermediates in the production of higher chlorophenols, such as TeCP and PCP, and of chloride-based herbicides, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2-(2,4 dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid.25,26 Moreover, 2,4,6-TCP is used in the preparation of flame retardants.27 Because of their antimicrobial properties, chlorophenolic chemicals are primarily used in pulp and paper, textile, leather tanning and wood bleaching industries.6,28,29 Also, their presence in wastewater originating from oil refining, petrochemicals and coking plants has been reported.30,31 Tobajas et al. reported the use of phenols and chlorophenols in many industrial processes such as the production of resins, nylon, plastics, antioxidants, lubricant additives, textile, dyes or explosives.32 Their presence in industrial wastewater ranges from one to several hundred mg L−1.33 Applications as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and wood preservatives are reported.34 They are also observed in landfill leachates or as by-products of the disinfection by chlorination.6,35,36
Chlorophenols, known to be one of the most abundant families of toxic industrial pollutants, are not (directly) available for biodegradation and are persistent in the environment.40 The toxicity of a chlorophenol depends on the degree of chlorination and the substitution away from the ortho-position.41,42 Both parameters influence the chlorophenol lipophilicity, which in turn determines the potential for uptake by the organism (bioaccumulation) and is correlated with the octanol–water partition coefficient (KOW). Based on the KOW and toxicity values of different chlorophenols (Table 1), it is clear that the increasing toxicity of higher chlorinated phenolic pollutants can be ascribed to the higher lipophilicity.
Furthermore, the ortho-substituted molecules are generally of lower toxicity than the meta- and para-ones. According to Grimwood and Mascarenhas, the ortho-substituted chlorine shields off the hydroxyl group, which interacts with the active sites in aquatic organisms.43 So, the interaction of an ortho-substituted chlorophenol with microorganisms is partially blocked, and the microorganisms experience less toxicity effects. However, the dissociation of chlorophenolic molecules affects the bioaccumulation, and also the toxicity. Only a limited change in toxicity will be observed at a pH below the dissociation constant (pKa), but a sharp decrease of toxicity when the pH is higher than pKa.43 So, the toxicity increases by the presence of non-dissociated forms.39
3. Biodegradation of chlorophenolic pollutants
3.1. Degradation pathways
The most critical step in the biodegradation of chlorophenols is the cleavage of the carbon–halogen bond, which occurs via the direct removal of the halogen from the aromatic ring (as the initial degradation step) or after oxidative ring cleavage (from chlorinated aliphatic intermediates).44 The cleavage of the carbon–halogen bond is confirmed by earlier studies indicating that chlorinated phenols are degraded to chlorine free end-products.15,45–49
Depending on the degree of chlorination, two main mechanisms are reported as the initial reaction step to degrade chlorophenolic pollutants by aerobic bacteria:15,50
1. The chlorocatechol pathway. The initial attack by mono-oxygenase, yielding chlorocatechols as the first intermediates, occurs mainly with lower chlorinated phenolic pollutants (from 1 to 2 chlorine substituents). Farrell and Quilty reported the transformation of 2-CP and 3-CP into 3-chlorocatechol, whereas the production of 4-chlorocatechol was observed during biotreatment of 4-CP (Fig. 1).15 These intermediate chlorocatechols were further subject to ring cleavage.
 Fig. 1  Suggested biodegradation pathway of 2-CP under aerobic conditions.52 
2. The hydroquinone pathway. The conversion of higher chlorinated chlorophenols (from 3 to 5 chlorine substituents) results in the production of chlorohydroquinones as the first intermediates. Chlorines are progressively removed from the ring prior to ring cleavage. The degradation pathway of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) via hydroquinone is proposed by Solyanikova and Golovleva (Fig. 2).51
 Fig. 2  Pathway of 2,4,5-T conversion via hydroxyquinol (tftAB and tftCD encode 2,4,5-T oxygenase and monooxygenase, respectively; tftG encodes the enzyme responsible for dechlorination of 5-hlorohydroxyquinol).51 
The cleavage of the aromatic ring occurs according to the ortho- or meta-pathway. Farrel and Quilty mentioned a modified ortho-pathway specific for chlorinated aromatic pollutants, which is necessary to achieve a complete degradation.15
This cleavage pathway is catalysed by the enzyme catechol-1,2-dioxygenase and results in the release of the chloride atom. However, the meta-pathway is identified as an unproductive route for chlorophenol degradation caused by the production of dead-end products, such as 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde.53
Direct elimination of chlorine substituents from the aromatic ring occurs via the replacement with hydrogen atoms, which requires a reducing agent (reductive dechlorination) and is significant in anaerobic environments.44
Annachhatre and Gheewala reported reductive dehalogenation as the initial reaction step for the biodegradation of chlorinated phenols under anaerobic conditions.42 Puyol et al. concluded that 4-CP was the main chlorinated intermediate product for 2,4,6-TCP and 2,4-DCP biodegradation, suggesting that the ortho dechlorination is the predominant degradation pathway.48 Also, Lv et al. concluded that reductive dechlorination was the predominant biotransformation process of PCP under oxygen-limited conditions.54 To achieve a complete mineralization, reductive dechlorination can be followed by carboxylation, ring fission, acetogenesis and methanogenesis.55 Nevertheless, Puyol et al. reported the limitations for the aerobic biodegradation of monochlorinated phenolics.56
Moreover, Yang et al. tested the anaerobic biodegradability of 46 aromatic compounds, including 4-CP which was classified as poorly biodegradable.57
3.2. Single source versus co-metabolic degradation
Several reports, summarized in Table 2, are available in which chlorophenols were used by specific isolated bacteria as a single carbon and energy source. Pseudomonas stutzeri was able to grow and utilize PCP as an energy source, even at high concentrations, resulting in a complete degradation of the pollutant after 120 h.58 Karn et al. investigated Bacillus megaterium, B. pumilus and B. thuringiensis, isolated from pulp and paper mill secondary sludge.50 All three isolated strains achieved a complete removal of 100 mg L−1 PCP within 168 h. During growth, chloride was released to the medium because of the consumption of PCP. Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus achieved 4-CP biodegradation efficiencies between 70% and 99.8%, depending on the conditions.59 Carvalho et al. investigated the fungus Mucor plumbeus for the degradation of PCP.60 The biodegradation of 100 mg L−1 4-CP by Pseudomonas sp. was achieved after 40 h with a lag phase for the biomass activity of 10 h.61Penicillium sp. was used by Yan et al. for the biodegradation of DCMX in high saline wastewater.62 The degradation efficiency decreased significantly at high salt concentrations, i.e., 4%, mainly as NaCl. Shi et al. screened the feasibility for phytoremediation of 2,4-DCP using four Salix matsudana clones (plant enzymes).40 Removal efficiencies between 52.2% and 73.7% were reported. However, the removal efficiency decreased significantly by increasing the initial concentration of 2,4 DCP.

BISPHENOL A (10 mg L−1)
Inoculum: enzyme laccase (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, PDLLA)
Because of the immobilization of laccase in the original fibers, the degradation efficiencies of bisphenol A and 2,4-DCP decreased. However, Triclosan was adsorbed rapidly around the active sites of laccase, resulting in the increase of its degradation efficiency


2,4-DCP (10 mg L−1)
Immobilization: laccase-carrying electrospun fibrous membranes enhanced by short and acid-treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes
Because of the modified membranes, the adsorption efficiencies of 2,4-DCP and bisphenol A were increased by 52.1% and 53.5%, respectively


TRICLOSAN (10 mg L−1)
Experiments:
The removal efficiencies of the modified fibrous membranes for bisphenol A, 2,4-DCP and Triclosan reached above 90%, caused by the synergistic effect of enhanced membrane adsorption and laccase degradation

For select bacteria, the sole presence of chlorophenols is insufficient to support microbial growth because of their low energy content.63 In the presence of other carbon sources, the degradation of chlorophenols seems to proceed easier.32 An overview of studies regarding co-metabolic biodegradation of chlorophenols by pure isolated cultures is included in Table 3. The presence of easily degradable carbon sources stimulates the growth of the microbial population, which in turn enhances the biodegradation of target pollutants and reduces the toxicity and growth inhibition.26 Even the dosing mode of the growth substrate influences the co-metabolic degradation. Wang et al. applied three dosing modes of sodium acetate, i.e., one-step pulse, evenly distributed pulse, and stepwise declining pulse, of which the last two showed an enhancement of the PCP degradation rate.64

Several findings suggest the co-metabolic degradation of chlorophenols by addition of glucose, peptone, molasses, sucrose, maltose, acetate, formate or propionate.13,26,32,52,65–75 Nevertheless, the type of growth substrate is determinative of the chlorophenol degradation. Majumder & Gupta achieved higher chlorophenol removal efficiencies by using glucose or methanol instead of formate or propionate.66
Even phenol is claimed to be a good growth substrate because of its similar chemical structure and lower toxicity.19,32,61,76 Tobajas et al. mentioned the danger of diauxic growth, which implies the inhibition of the consumption of one growth substrate by the presence of another substrate.32 However, co-metabolic degradation of chlorophenols results in the enhancement of the degradation rate and the reaction time. Wang et al. described the degradation of 2,4-DCP in the presence of phenol by Bacillus insolitus cultivated in suspended and immobilized form and concluded that only at low 2,4-DCP concentrations did immobilized cells show a higher removal of 2,4-DCP than suspended ones.77 At higher concentrations, similar removal efficiencies were observed until the growth was fully inhibited by too high chlorophenol concentrations. The degradation of 4-CP in a mixture with phenol and sodium glutamate by Pseudomonas putida was investigated by Wang et al.17 The biphasic growth pattern in the ternary substrate mixture showed two exponential growth phases separated by an intermediate lag phase. The same bacteria were used to degrade a mixture of 600 mg L−1 phenol and 120 mg L−1 4-CP.18 The suspended cells were not able to degrade either of both substrates. However, a complete transformation at higher concentrations of both substrates (1000 mg L−1) was achieved within 45 h by using an immobilized cell hollow fiber membrane reactor. The simultaneous biodegradation of phenol and 4-CP was observed by Wang et al.78 However, the degradation of 4-CP increased only after the complete utilization of phenol. Tobajas et al. concluded that the simultaneous addition of phenol or glucose significantly reduces the minimum time required for complete 4-CP degradation by Comamonas testosteroni.32 The treatment of a complex mixture containing 500 mg L−1 PCP and 200 mg L−1 Cr6+ by Bacillus cereus was investigated by Tripathi and Garg.72 The bioreduction of Cr6+ to insoluble Cr3+ and simultaneous dechlorination of PCP was achieved after the addition of an extra carbon source (glucose, maltose and sucrose) and nitrogen source (ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate or urea). Tetra-, tri- and dichlorophenols and 6-chlorohydroxyguinol were detected as PCP dechlorination products. A decrease in reaction time by 18 h for the treatment of 4-CP by Pseudomonas sp. was achieved through the addition of phenol.61 Nevertheless, the degradation time of phenol was extended by 11 h when 4-CP was also present in the wastewater. The authors also observed a lag phase in biomass activity before any pollutant was degraded. Patel and Kumar used peptone as growth substrate for the degradation of 2,4-DCP by B. endophyticus and observed a complete 2,4-DCP degradation in the range of 25–50 mg L−1 2,4-DCP and between 75% and 80% degradation in the range of 100 mg L−1 2,4-DCP to 400 mg L−1 2,4-DCP.74 Nowak et al. used Stenotrophomonas maltophilia for the biodegradation of monochlorophenols and concluded that the co-metabolic degradation efficiency depended on the earlier exposure to phenol and the position of the chlorine substituent in the aromatic ring.79
In addition to more common co-metabolites, saponic extracts of the bark of the Quillaja saponaria Molina and of the fruits of the Sapindus mukorossi tree were successfully used to enhance the biodegradation of 4-CP, fluorophenol and 4-bromophenol by Raoultella planticola or Pseudomonas sp.83
Despite the results achieved by isolated bacteria, acclimated mixed cultures may provide additional benefits since different bacterial species in the mixed culture produce various enzymes required at each step of the transformation process.

Tables 4 and 5 present relevant studies using mixed biomass cultures. Hereby, pre-acclimation of the biomass is important to enhance the rate and extent of biodegradation.32,85 Farrel and Quilty investigated the degradation of monochlorophenols by a mixed culture of Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes, together with a species of white rot fungus Trichoderma harzianum, that was adapted for 238 h.15 A comparison between a non-acclimated and acclimated culture was performed by Sahinkaya and Dilek.65 They concluded that acclimation resulted in an improved tolerance of microorganisms towards 2,4-DCP based on the disappearance of the lag phase and an improved COD removal efficiency at higher pollutant concentrations. A decrease in COD and 2,4-DCP removal efficiencies, and consequently an increase in effluent concentrations, accomplished by acclimated activated sludge, was only observed by increasing the feed concentration above 150 mg L−1 2,4 DCP.13 A COD removal efficiency of 94% was achieved during treatment of 2-CP-containing wastewater by pulp and paper mill secondary sludge acclimated to the chlorophenolic pollutant for 15 days in the presence of glucose.52 In the context of acclimated biomass, an aerobic SBR offers a dynamic environment favorable for cell adaptation to toxic pollutants, resulting in superior performances for the treatment of PCP compared to continuous systems.86 During the start-up procedure of the SBR, sodium acetate was used as the growth substrate to trigger co-metabolic degradation of PCP. In a later phase, the concentration of the growth substrate was stepwise reduced, until the biomass was adapted in such a way it was able to grow on PCP as a single substrate. Zhao et al. successfully acclimated activated sludge with 10 mg L−1 4-CP and showed that by gradually elevating the 4-CP loads from 10 to 100 mg L−1, the sludge performance was basically unaffected.87 However, the sludge toxicity was increased. The ecological risk of the sludge toxicity towards land application using excess sludge was already highlighted by the same author.88 The removal of pollutants in aqueous and sludge phases is not sufficient. The increased sludge toxicity was caused by the accumulation of dominant microbial secondary metabolites. Nitrifying sludge cultivated with p-cresol containing wastewater in a lab-scale CSTR was used for the treatment of a mixture containing 2-CP, phenol, p-cresol and p-OHB.76 Compared to single 2-CP oxidation, the consumption rate of 2-CP was 2.4 times higher when 2-CP was present in a mixture of several phenolic pollutants, indicating the enhancement of the biodegradation process (both 2-CP oxidation and nitrifying process) by co-metabolism. Furthermore, the co-metabolic biodegradation of 2-CP by acclimated biomass in the presence of phenol and under resting cell conditions after depletion of phenol was observed by Aktas.19 Finally, Pérez-Alfaro et al. investigated the effect of 2-CP on the nitrifying process by comparing non-acclimated and acclimated (towards 4-MP) nitrifying biomass and concluded that acclimation was crucial for removing 2-CP without harming the nitrification process.16

The co-metabolic degradation of chlorophenols is usually performed by the addition of an extra carbon source. The effect of different carbon sources on the sludge performance and the microbial community for 4-CP wastewater treatment was discussed by Zhao et al.89 The removal performance was not influenced, while significant differences in bacterial communities were observed. Instead of a carbon source, Moussavi et al. reported the use of nitrate under anoxic conditions for improving the biological degradation of 2-CP by granular sludge acclimated to 100 mg L−1 2-CP for 56 days.90 They observed biodegradation efficiencies of 2-CP above 99% for inlet 2-CP concentrations up to 500 mg L−1 and demonstrated the coupling of the biodegradation of 2-CP to the use of nitrate. Chen et al. added NaHS to enhance the degradation of 2,4-DCP by P. chrysosporium.91 Co-metabolic biodegradation was not intended, however, H2S or HS−, rather than other compounds derived from NaHS, can alleviate the 2,4-DCP-induced oxidative stress, and consequently improve cell viability by increasing 2,4-DCP degradation.
Finally, Wang et al. emphasized the need for kinetic models of co-metabolism since the inhibition form of both growth and non-growth substrates needs to be considered.78 In this context, the 4-CP biodegradation kinetics by phenol-acclimated activated sludge was investigated by Lobo et al.92 Kinetic models contribute to obtain insights into the biodegradation interactions of the different substrates and the complex behaviors of different microorganisms in these circumstances. A SKIP-model (Sum Kinetics with Interaction Parameters) was applied in many studies.93–96 Also, alternative models are proposed to understand the mechanisms of the substrate interactions.97–99
3.3. Innovation in biological processes
To prevent substrate inhibition, a barrier is necessary to protect the microorganisms from the toxic pollutants, even when the substrate level in the bulk medium is inhibitory.18 In this context, the immobilization of microorganisms proved its feasibility to maintain cell growth and substrate degradation, mainly because of mass transfer limitations.100 For example, the alginate support utilized to immobilize Bacillus insolitus and Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus was investigated by Wang et al. and Sahoo and Panigrahy, respectively.77,82 Moreover, the successful degradation of 500 mg L−1 PCP was achieved by immobilized Bacillus cereus.72 Because of a synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation, Dai et al. obtained more than 90% removal of bisphenol A, 2,4-DCP and Triclosan by using laccase-carrying electrospun fibrous membranes.80 To enhance the economic competitiveness of the immobilized cultures, the recovery is an important aspect. Hence, Hou et al. used Fe3O4 nanoparticles to create magnetically immobilized Rhodococcus rhodochrous to facilitate the recovery.84 Lim et al. observed a consequently lower removal rate of 4-CP in an SBR compared to a moving bed SBR (MBSBR).70 To tackle shock loadings of chlorophenolic toxic pollutants, Majumder and Gupta used a sequential UASB-RBC concept.66 Obviously, the UASB encountered the most effects of the shock loading, resulting in a slight decrease of chlorophenol degradation and gas production. However, the sequential reactors were able to intercept the higher 2-CP and 2,4-DCP concentrations. Angelucci et al. and Tomei et al. used a continuous two-phase partitioning bioreactor to enhance biodegradation of 4-CP and xenobiotic removal.101,102 The direct contact between the toxic wastewater and the microorganisms is prevented by this configuration. Furthermore, the cells are exposed to sub-inhibitory concentration levels since the metabolic process regulates the gradual substrate delivery.
Furthermore, Puyol et al. used granular active carbon (GAC) on which the biofilm can grow and the GAC-biofilm can be applied in a fluidized bed bioreactor (FBBR) for the removal of 2,4,6-TCP.56 The performances of the FBBR were compared to the results achieved by an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. Anaerobic conditions were applied in both reactors. In the FBBR, both chlorophenol removal and overall dechlorination efficiencies were much higher than those observed in the EGSB reactor, probably because of sorption onto the GAC-biofilm. Mainly 4-CP was detected in the effluent of both the EGSB reactor and FBBR. Further aerobic treatment in an SBR was performed at different hydraulic retention times (HRT). The complete transformation of 4-CP was observed within the applied range of HRT (16–80 h), and the rate of disappearance increased with the HRT. Despite the inferior results of the anaerobic granular sludge observed by Puyol et al., aerobic granular sludge has recently attracted wide attention because of the higher biomass concentrations, a denser and stronger microbial aggregate structure, and excellent settling capacity compared to activated sludge.48,103 The dissolved oxygen gradient throughout the granule results in different zones in which a wide range of micro-environments are detected, i.e., heterotrophic aerobic bacteria grow on the outside, facultative anaerobic bacteria in the core and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria in the intermediate layer of the granules.105 The granule cultivation of aerobic activated sludge is reported by Khan et al.26,52 Both studies observed COD removal efficiencies above 94%. Fernández et al. cultivated granular sludge acclimated to para-nitrophenol (p-NP) for the removal of a mixture of o-cresol, o-CP and p-NP.104 The phenolic degrading species in the granules were identified as Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Arthrobacter sp. Furthermore, the degradation of 50 mg L−1 4-CP in three different reactors (SBR, granular SBR (GSBR) and MBR) was compared by Carucci et al.68 The GSBR and SBR were able to withstand a 4-CP volume organic loading rate twice as high as that of the MBR. Finally, Ma et al. demonstrated a faster acclimation and higher degradation ability of granules to 4-CP and 2,4-DCP compared to 2,4,6-TCP.81
4. Ozonation of chlorophenolic pollutants
Ozone as a single oxidant has showed satisfactory effectiveness for the degradation of a wide variety of organic pollutants, including chlorophenols.106 Moreover, many studies report efficiency improvements by combining ozone with catalysts, UV-light and/or other oxidants. Therefore, Tables 6 and 7 include the highlights of CP degradation and biodegradability improvement, respectively, in single substrate solutions. Studies regarding CP degradation and biodegradability improvement in multiple substrate solutions are summarized in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.

Degradation by ozonation




21

2-CP (52.7 mg L−1) 4-CP (52.7 mg L−1) 2,4-CP (66.8 mg L−1)
Ozonation
The chlorophenol ozonation reactions in alkaline solutions followed pseudo-first order kinetics


Ozone concentration in the gas phase = 0.5 mg L−1; pH = 9.5


In the final phase, the simulations predicted faster chlorophenol decomposition and lower ozone consumption than those observed experimentally because of the formation of intermediate products rapidly reacting with ozone


Hydroxyl radical reactions did not make any contribution to the chlorophenol oxidation rate under alkaline conditions, probably because of the high reaction rate of the phenolate ions with ozone at pH conditions favorable for hydroxyl radical oxidation



114

2-CP (50 mg L−1) 4-CP (50 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (65 mg L−1) 2,4,6-TCP (80 mg L−1) 2,3,4,6-TeCP (90 mg L−1) PCP (105 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Ozonation under alkaline conditions led to the most efficient removal of all of the CPs studied


Reactor: bubble column; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 0.5 mg L−1; pH = 2.5 or 9.5; reaction time = 2.5–45 min; volume = 100 mL


The removal of CPs under alkaline conditions was accompanied by a decrease of pH revealing the presence of acidic oxidation products; also, the color of the reaction mixture changes indicates the formation of new chromophores (most probably quinones and their derivatives); towards the end of the overall treatment time, the color of the mixture disappeared


Typical intermediate products formed during oxidation of chlorophenols were chlorobenzenediols


Oxidation of chlorophenols was effective, but incomplete dechlorination indicated the presence of chlorinated intermediates (chlorinated aliphatic structures)



117

PCP (1.25–2.5 mg L−1)
Ozonation
The overall reaction is second order with first order each for the concentrations of PCP and ozone


Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 0.72–13.44 mg L−1; pH = 2–7; reaction time = 5–20 min; temperature = 10–40 °C


Depending on the solution pH, PCP can be present in both molecular and ionic forms, and pentachlorophenolate reacts much faster with ozone than PCP



118

PCP (2.85–10 mg L−1)
Ozonation
The stoichiometric ratio for the oxidation of PCP by ozone was 1.5 mol of ozone consumed per mol of PCP reacted


pH = 2.5–9; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 500 mL


Rate constants between 0.67 × 105 L mol−1 s−1 (at pH 2.5) and 3.15 × 107 L mol−1 s−1 (at pH 9) were determined


The specific ozonation rate constant for the dissociated and undissociated form of PCP were determined, i.e., 9.10 × 106 L mol−1 s−1 and 1.00 × 104 L mol−1 s−1, respectively


Main intermediate products: tetrachlorocatechol, tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone



119

PCP (10–80 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Typical Taylor flow patterns were observed


Reactor: microchannel; superficial gas velocity = 0.1–0.5 m s−1; superficial liquid velocity = 0.5–10.5 m s−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 13–40 mg L−1; pH = 6–12


The microchannel reactor demonstrated an excellent performance in the ozone mass transfer efficiency and the ozonation of PCP


The ozonation of PCP was a pseudo-first order reaction, and the apparent reaction rate constant, observed at different PCP concentrations (10–80 mg L−1), varied between 2.10–2.13 1/s



120

4-CP (6 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (6 mg L−1) PHENOL (6 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Removal efficiencies for phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP were determined to be 98.9%, 99.8% and 98.9%, respectively


Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 7–40 mg L−1; ozone dosage = 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1, 2.0 mgO3 mgC−1 and 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1 for phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, respectively; reaction time = 96 h; volume = 5 L



121

PHENOL
Ozonation
The ejector had a higher volumetric mass transfer coefficient and gas retention rate


1. Pilot with ejector


Reactor: tank with circulation containing heat exchanger, ejector and mixture tube (0.5–1 m3 h−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.1–0.8 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5% in weight; pH = 2.7–11.3; temperature = 20–35 °C; volume = 30 L


2. Bubble column


Reactor: cylindrical body with spherical head, with circulation (0.16 m3 h−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.2 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5% in weight; pH = 2.7–11.3; volume = 2.5 L


By increasing the pH, the ejector achieved better results for phenol degradation


For the diffusion-controlled regime (ozonation at high pH), the ejector allowed treatment of an important flow rate in a short time, with efficient mass transfer



Degradation by ozone-based processes




22

4-CP (40 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (50 mg L−1) 2,4,6-TCP (60 mg L−1) 2,3,4,6-TeCP (70 mg L−1)
Ozonation and O3/UV
Ozonation


UV light: high pressure mercury vapor lamp (185–436 nm); pH = 2 or 9; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 350 mL
Ozone is more reactive with higher substituted CPs whereas hydroxyl radicals react faster with those chlorophenols having a lower number of chlorine atoms


For ozonation under acidic conditions, the increase in the number of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring provided an increase in the degradation rate (the presence of more chlorine atoms enhanced the dechlorination step)


The most important fact observed is the increase of the rate constant (pseudo-first order) with increasing pH (from 2 to 9) because of the faster production of hydroxyl radicals at alkaline pH and the dissociation of phenols to phenolate ions that are able to react faster with ozone than the non-dissociated species


O3/UV


This combination accelerates the decomposition rate, with an extremely high rate constant for 4-CP, and lower rates for the other CPs


All CPs, apart from 4-CP, presented slightly increasing rate constants when the substituent chlorine atoms increase



122

2,4-D (300 mg L−1)
O3/UV & photocatalytic ozonation
O3/UV


Photocatalyst: titanium dioxide coated glass fiber; UV-light: black light (6 × 20 W); ozone concentration in the gas phase = 1.4 mg L−1; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 310 mL min−1; pH = 3–11; temperature = room temperature (18–22 °C); volume = 500 mL
By increasing both the ozone concentration in the gas phase and the pH, the degradation rate of 2,4-D increased


At pH 9, a first-order rate constant of 0.00544 min−1 was observed


Photocatalytic ozonation


At pH 9, a first-order rate constant of 0.00166 min−1 was observed


The lower rate constant was ascribed to either the inhibiting effect of O3 on photocatalysis or the decay of ozone at the large catalyst surface without any reaction with 2,4-D


Compared to O3/UV, a higher mineralization rate of TOC was observed (from 139 mg L−1 to 27.4 mg L−1, instead of 118 mg L−1)



123

4-CP (200 mg L−1) 4-NPa (200 mg L−1) PHENOL (200 mg L−1)
Ozonation, O3/UV, catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation
The highest mineralization rate of the phenolic pollutants was achieved by photocatalytic ozonation (100%, 90% and 75% mineralization for phenol, 4-CP and 4-NP, respectively)


Reactor: tubular photoreactor; catalyst: TiO2 (1.5 g L−1); UV light: high pressure mercury lamp (700 W, 238–579 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 51 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; pH = 2.9–6.1; volume = 900 mL


Identified intermediates 4-CP: hydroquinone, resorcinol, benzoquinone, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, glyoxylic acid, formic acid


All processes followed pseudo-first order kinetics for phenol removal



124

2,4-Db (10 mg L−1)
Ozonation, O3/UV and photocatalytic ozonation
Decay of 2,4-D and TOC by all oxidation processes was accurately described by the first-order reaction kinetics


Catalyst: TiO2 silica gel powder (5 g L−1); UV light: UV tube lamp (10 W, 254 nm); air/O3 gas flow rate = 1.0 L min−1; ozone dosage in the gas phase = 0.5–3 mg (L−1.min−1); pH < 4.6; reaction time = 80 min; temperature = 10–30 °C; volume = 1.3 L


Removal of 2,4-D and TOC was significantly enhanced in the photocatalytic ozonation system, and further enhancement was observed with larger ozone supplies (2,4-D k-value of photocatalytic ozonation was 1.4–1.7 times higher than the sum of corresponding k-values of ozonation and UV/TiO2)



125

2-CP (100 mg L−1)
Catalytic ozonation
The increase of the catalyst ratio seemed to increase the catalytically activity sites, which could improve the 2-chlorophenol ozonation oxidation reaction rate as well


Catalyst: Ni-containing fly ash and sawdust; liquid/solid ratio = 2:1, 5:1, 10:1; pH = 7–11; Reaction time = 12 min; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 200 mL


The increase of pH resulted in the decrease of 2-chlorophenol removal efficiency with the catalyst


The 2-CP ozonation process followed the pseudo-first order kinetic model, and the reaction rate constant of catalytic ozonation increased by 267%, compared to single ozonation


Oxidation products: first phenol, then oxalic acid as the main end product



126

2,4-D (440 mg L−1)
Ozonation, O3/UV and photocatalytic ozonation
Both catalysts improved the reaction efficiency when compared with only ozone and UV light, and best results were obtained with Fe(II)/UV/O3 combination


Catalyst: TiO2 (Degussa P-25; 2 g L−1) and Fe(II) (10–85 mg L−1); UV light: 6 W Philips black-light fluorescent lamp (300–420 nm); ozone dosage = 1.4 g h−1; pH = 2–10; reaction time = 120 min; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 100 mL


Dechlorination seemed to be one of the first steps of the degradation reaction



127

2-CP (65 mg L−1) 2,4-D (22 mg L−1) BDDABc (38 mg L−1) BNSd (27 mg L−1) BPAe (23 mg L−1) DBSf (35 mg L−1)
Ozonation, O3/UV, photocatalytic ozonation
The mineralization process was enhanced by the combination of photocatalysis and ozonation methodologies


Reactor: ozone bubbling tube followed by solar photoreactor; catalyst: TiO2 (nanoparticulate; 0.5–2.0 g L−1); UV light: solar light harvest (area = 3.06 m2); ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 3 mg L−1; temperature = increased to ±45 °C; volume = 100–500 L (from the feed tank continuously circulated over the bubbling tube and photoreactor at a rate of 7 L min−1)


The dechlorination of 2-CP occurred more rapidly by increasing the amount of the TiO2 catalyst, with the optimal loading being 1.0 g L−1


Both the aromatic ring cleavage and dechlorination were presumed to occur simultaneously in the first initial step of the photocatalytic ozonation of 2-CP


The complete mineralization of 2,4-D, BPA, DBS and BNS present in the simulated wastewaters was achieved within 3 h of photocatalytic ozonation, whereas BDDAB was somewhat recalcitrant to photodegradation



128

PHENOL (93–105 mg L−1)
Ozonation, O3/UV, O3/H2O2 and O3/UV/H2O2
None of the ozone combinations (O3/UV, O3/H2O2 and O3/UV/H2O2) improved the degradation rate (pseudo-first order kinetic) of the ozone process (alkaline conditions), even resulting in a limited inhibitory effect


Reactor: bubble column with a co-current circulation of gas and liquid; UV light: mercury vapor lamp (253.7 nm); O2 gas flow rate = 100 L h−1; ozone dosage = 0.2–0.3 g h−1; pH = 3–9; temperature = 16–20 °C; volume = 2.5 L


Based on the obtained degradation rate and the lower costs, the most appealing choice for phenol degradation was ozonation (even above other oxidation techniques such as UV/H2O2 and Fenton)



129

2,4,6-TCP (50 mg L−1)
Adsorption–ozonation
TCP adsorption onto the adsorbent was significantly enhanced after the first regeneration with ozone (TCP removal increased from 52% up to 87%)


Adsorbent: high-silica FAUg zeolite; adsorption: 400 mL of 50 mg L−1 + 10 g zeolite; 2 h; room temperature; pH 6.2–6.5; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 45–50 mg L−1; ozone concentration in water = 7 mg L−1; after ozonation, the adsorption was repeated; temperature = room temperature


Elevated adsorption capacity remained until the 8th adsorption cycle, afterwards a dramatic dropdown of TCP removal was observed, possibly because of matrix carbon and pH decrease



130

4-CP (250 mg L−1)
Catalytic ozonation
In the presence of the catalyst, a degradation efficiency of 99% was determined after 40 min ozonation (only 67% when only ozone was used)


Catalyst: β-FeOOH nanorods (0.01 g); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 10 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 28.24 mg L−1; pH = 3.5-10; volume = 100 mL


A maximum of 97% COD was removed using 0.1 g/100 mL catalyst load



131

PHENOL (100 mg L−1)
Catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation
Primary oxidation products: resorcinol, catechol and hydroquinone


Catalyst: Mn (10%)/TiO2 (1.5 g); UV light: UV mercury lamp (General Electric, 220–380 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 50 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 2.15 mg L−1; pH = 3; reaction time = 3 h; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 100 mL


The product distribution was oriented to more oxidized products (pyruvic, maleic acids and CO2) when the catalyst was irradiated with UV light


The phenol reacted only with ozone and not with hydroxyl radicals. The intermediate ozonation products reacted with both oxidants



132

2,4-D (10 mg L−1)
Ozonation, catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation
Photocatalytic ozonation with the fiber catalyst was efficient in mineralizing low concentrations of 2,4-D in water (pseudo-first order)


Catalyst: TiO2 fiber; UV light: UV tube lamp (10 W, 254 nm); air/O3 gas flow rate = 1.0 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 2 mg L−1; pH = not controlled (initial pH = 4.32–4.36); reaction time = 2 h; volume = 7.5 L


The photocatalytic ozonation process was characterized by few aromatic intermediates with low abundance, fast degradations of the aliphatic intermediates despite their relatively large number and dechlorination as a major step


The enhanced mineralization was because of increased ozone dissolution and decomposition, and due to reduced electron–hole recombination in the presence of TiO2 resulting in large amounts of hydroxyl radical formation



133

2,4,6-TCP (0.5 mg L−1)
Catalytic ozonation
ZnO promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals and increased the rate of ozone consumption


Catalyst: ZnO (2–10 mg L−1; nanometer, submicrometer, micrometer); ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 2.5 mg L−1; pH = 7.5; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 2.5 L


Under the same conditions, the presence of the catalyst resulted in an increase of the 2,4,6-TCP removal rate


The loss of bound chlorine was observed as one of the first steps of 2,4,6-TCP degradation


The catalytic ozonation by ZnO followed a radical-type mechanism, by which the catalyst was able to initiate or promote hydroxyl radical production


The nano-ZnO particles displayed unique catalytic activity, different from micro-ZnO and submicro-ZnO particles



134

4-CP (100 mg L−1)
Catalytic ozonation
The catalytic ozonation on MgO substantially enhanced the removal of 4-CP and TOC, when compared to ozonation only


Catalyst: MgO (crystal facet of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0)); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.5 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 1000 mL


The mechanism involved hydroxyl radicals in all processes



135

2,4,6-TCP (100 mg L−1)
Catalytic ozonation
Increased conversion of 2,4,6-TCP was observed at higher pH-values


Catalyst: Ce–Zr loaded metal oxide; ozone dosage = 14.4 mg h−1; reaction time = 5 h; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 50 mL


All reaction products were dechlorinated


Oxidation products: dihydroxyfumaric acid, oxalic acid


At pH 11, metal oxide supported Ce–Zr catalysts are found to have good product selectivity for partial oxidation



136

PHENOL (100 mg L−1)4-CP (100 mg L−1)
Coupled electro-oxidation/ozonation
Identified intermediates phenol: hydroquinone, benzoquinone, catechol, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, formic acid


Reactor: upflow bubble column (gas plate diffusor) adapted with two boron doped diamond electrodes (20 cm × 2.5 cm) separated at a distance of 1 cm; superficial area of electrodes = 50 cm2; electrolyte = 0.1 M Na2SO4; current density = 60 mA cm−2 for phenol degradation, 30 mA cm−2 for 4-CP degradation; applied potential = 11.25 V; air/O3 gas flow rate = 0.05 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; pH = 7; reaction time = 120 min; temperature = room temperature; volume = 1 L


Identified intermediates 4-CP: hydroquinone, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid


Complete phenol and 4-CP degradation is achieved in only 60 min and 120 min, respectively


Complete TOC mineralization is only observed during phenol degradation after 100 min treatment


The energy consumption on the basis of TOC removal was calculated to compare with other oxidation processes and the process offering less energy consumption was the coupled process


The main reason for incomplete mineralization was because of the stability of oxalic acid formed as an intermediate product during the oxidation process



137

4-CP (50 mg L−1)
Photoelectro-peroxone/ZVI process
The 4-CP degradation by the photoelectro-peroxone/ZVI process had the lowest rate constant, i.e., 0.1809 min−1, compared to metanil yellow, benzotriazole, tetracycline and carmoisine. However, the rate constants are all of the same order of magnitude


Reactor: quartz cylinder (cathode: graphite felt; anode: platinum sheet); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.25 L min−1; DC power supply: 3.000 A, 30 V; UV light: low pressure UVC lamp (4 W, 254 nm, 1.51 mW cm−2)); temperature = 25–28 °C


For pollutants with large molecules (higher organic carbon, i.e., tetracycline, carmoisine, metanil yellow), the TOC removals were approximately 20–25% lower than others (i.e.,4-CP and benzotriazole)



138

2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1) 2,4-D (100 mg L−1)
Ozonation, photocatalytic ozonation
Despite the low mineralization, direct ozonation was an effective process for the decomposition of 2,4-DCP and 2,4-D. The mineralization was enhanced by combining ozonation with photocatalysis, resulting in a nearly complete TOC removal. A similar significant improvement in degradation and mineralization was observed when the plasma under an argon atmosphere was combined with Fenton oxidation


Reactor: planar falling film; UV light: UVA lamps (15 W, 360 nm); O2 gas flow rate = 10 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 130 mg L−1; pH = 3.35 and 6.85; volume = 0.5 L


Non-thermal plasma


Reactor: dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor; ceramic plates (3 mm thickness); high voltage electrode: self-adhesive aluminum foil; ground electrode: self-adhesive copper strips; pulse generator: 21 kV (RMS) at 5 and 20 kHz



139

4-Chloro-3-methylphenol (50 mg L−1)
Ozonation, catalytic ozonation
The TOC removal rate constant of Zn-CNTs/O3 was 4.9 times higher compared to single ozonation


Reactor: 1.2 L cylindrical glass reactor; catalyst: zinc–carbon nanotubes (ZN-CNTs) composite (1–4 g L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 200–600 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 34 mg L−1; (initial) pH = 3–12; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 0.5 L


The mineralization efficiency increased by increasing the catalyst dosage and oxygen feed rate


Identified intermediates 4-chloro-3-methylphenol: (2Z)-but-2-enedioic acid, malonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid


In the Zn-CNTs/O3 system, the concentration of small molecular organic acids first increases and afterwards decreases, indicating the oxidation of these intermediates and confirming the enhanced mineralization

Degradation by ozonation




23

PCP (50 ppm)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
The PCP degradation was initiated via direct nucleophilic attack by ozone as the predominant pathway, whereas both ozone and secondary hydroxyl radicals were likely involved in subsequent degradation of intermediates


Reactor: bubble column; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 1% w/w; pH = 5–12; reaction time = 45 min; volume = 4 L
BOD5 and COD measurement


Toxicity


Colorimetric method based on the reduction of the redox-active dye resazurin by bacterial respiration


The ozonation of PCP resulted in quantitative release of chlorine and multiple intermediates that are increasingly less toxic and biodegradable with time


To detoxify PCP and early toxic intermediates, a reaction time of 10–20 min is needed, afterward intermediates are amenable to biological degradation



106

4-CP (200 mg L−1) 2,4-CP (200 mg L−1) PHENOL (200 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
In the initial step of ozonation, dechlorination of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP occurred, and then the destruction mechanism of these pollutants was similar to the phenol decomposition (at pH 2 and pH 7, formation of phenol and 4-CP was observed during ozonation of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, respectively)


O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.5 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 23 mg L−1; pH = 2–12; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 0.5 L
BOD5 and COD measurements


The presence of unsaturated acids at different pH confirmed the cleavage of aromatic ring, but by different mechanisms


Final products at pH 2 & 7: oxalic and formic acid


Final products at alkaline pH: oxalic acid


The effect of pre-ozonation on the biodegradability of phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP was significant and increased at alkaline pH



110

CHLOROPHENE (10 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Toxicity
The rate constants between ozone and chlorophene in the pH ranges of 3–11 varied from 1.67 × 103 L mol s−1 at pH 3 to 1.82 × 105 L mol s−1 at pH 11


Ozone volume flow rate = 1.8 L h−1; temperature = 20 °C

Second order reaction rate constants for ozonation in acidic media (pH = 2.5) were determined (0.85–1.9 L mol−1 s−1)


Reactor: bubble column; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 1.0 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 0.5 mg L−1; pH = 2.5 and 9.5; volume = 100 mL
Acute toxicity to Daphnia magna


The effect of the pH was found to be strong at pH-values from 3.5 to 8.5


Chloride ion formation was detected during ozonation, which shows the mineralization of CPs


Quinones and hydrogen peroxide were detected as reaction products


Ozonation products were much less toxic or even nontoxic to Daphnia magna when compared to the toxic properties of the initial pollutants



141

2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1) NBc (100 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
Stoichiometric coefficients (mol ozone consumed per mol pollutant removed) of the reaction of ozone with NB and 2,4-DCP were approximately 4 and 2, respectively


Reactor: batch pilot-scale plant; ozone dosage = 7.4 g h−1 and 5.4 g h−1 for NB and 2,4-DCP, respectively; pH = not controlled; temperature = 20–25 °C; volume = 21 L
BOD5 and COD measurements; bioassays (1.5 L, CSTR, pH 7, 1.5 g L−1 MLSS)


Pseudo-first order kinetic constants of single ozonation were 3 times higher for 2,4-DCP than NB (the electron withdrawing character of the nitro group depletes the aromatic ring from the electron density)


Intermediates 2,4-DCP: chlorobenzoquinone and resorcinol


For combined ozonation pre-treatment and biological oxidation process, optimum ozone doses were 0.25 g L−1 and 0.12 g L−1 for NB and 2,4-DCP, respectively


Highest BOD values were obtained when the pollutants were nearly removed from solution


The coupled system (pre-ozonation and aerobic bioreactor) achieved up to 80% of TOC removal



142

Ozone dosage = 75.2 mg min−1; pH = 7; volume = 1000 mL
Microtox assay (Photobacterium phosphoreum); OUR inhibition test (control: glucose)
Main intermediates 2-CP: 3-chlorocatechol and 2-chloro-2,4-hexadienedioic acid


Main intermediates 3- & 4-CP: 4-chlorocatechol and 3-chloro-2,4-hexadienedioic acid


Ozonation of 2-CP, 3-CP and 4-CP significantly induced new aqueous toxicity when these toxic intermediates were not further ozonated



143

2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
After an absorbed ozone dose of 0.12 g L−1, the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of a 100 mg L−1 2,4-DCP solution increased from 0 to 0.25 (average oxidation state: 1.5; no complete dechlorination, indicating the presence of chlorinated intermediates)


Reactor: storage tank from which liquid recirculated over venturi-type ozone injector; O2 gas flow rate = 400 L h−1; ozone dosage = 5.4 g h−1; pH = not controlled; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 21–25 °C; volume = 21 L
BOD (5, 10 and 21 days), COD and TOC measurements; Aerobic bioassays (CSTR; HRT = 12–24 h; non-acclimated and acclimated-to-phenol sludge)


After the pre-ozonation step, 70% of TOC was removed by an aerobic biological treatment



144

2-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 3-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 4-CP (100–200 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Toxicity
In general, the ozonation of CPs induced new aqueous toxicity


Reactor: bubble column; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 976 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 77 mg L−1; pH = 7; reaction time = 10 min; volume = 1000 mL
Microtox assay


(Photobacterium phosphoreum)
Ozonation of 2-CP revealed a higher level of toxicity increase than 3-CP and 4-CP


The increasing toxicity was mainly caused by ozonated intermediates (chlorocatechols, chloromuconic acids and formation of hydroxylated/chlorinated dimeric pollutants)


Ozone requirement of detoxifying into a non-toxic solution follows the order: 4-CP > 3-CP > 2-CP



145

TRICLOSAN (10 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Toxicity
Complete triclosan removal was achieved by ozonation


Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 2 mg L−1; pH = 7; room temperature
Cytotoxicity: MTTd (tetrazolium dye) test (Chinese hamster ovary cells); genotoxicity: alkaline comet assay (Chinese hamster ovary cells)


Intermediate products: 2,4-DCP, chlorocatechol, mono-hydroxy-triclosan, di-hydroxy-triclosan


2,4-DCP showed lower genotoxic effects than triclosan



146

4-CP (465 mg L−1)

2,4-DAPg (292.5 mg L−1)


ACPh (420 mg L−1) ANPi (427.5 mg L−1)


Ozonation was found to significantly decrease the toxicity for all of the phenolic pollutants



147

2-CP (385 mg L−1) 4-NP (417 mg L−1) 4-CRESOL (325 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
The removal of COD to the effluent standard required long ozonation times and the ozone utilization rate decreased, indicating a costly and unfeasible application


O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.21 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 20 g m−3; ozone dosage = 9 g h−1; pH = 3–10; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 7 L
BOD5 and COD measurements
The biodegradability of pre-ozonated phenolic solutions was strongly dependent on the decomposition of phenolic pollutants and accumulation of intermediate products


Using non-acclimated microorganisms, biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of pretreated 4-cresol, 2-CP and 4-NP solutions increased to 0.18, 0.26 and 0.33, respectively (higher ratios were expected if acclimated biomass was used)

116

4-CP (130 mg L−1)
O3/UV and O3/H2O2/UV
Toxicity
Complete 4-CP degradation by O3/UV was achieved throughout the pH ranges (increasing the initial pH value up to 9 enhanced the mineralization)

Microbiotest assay


(Daphnia magna)
The addition of H2O2 to the O3/UV process accelerated the decomposition of ozone owing to an increased rate of hydroxyl radical generation


Maximum TOC removal, i.e., 50.1% by the O3/H2O2/UV process, was obtained at H2O2 concentration of 15 mM (further increase resulted in a decrease of the removal efficiency)


The O3/H2O2/UV process achieved an AOX removal efficiency of 96.1% and a toxicity decay of 41.0%


Primary oxidation intermediate products: hydroquinone, benzoquinone, chlorocatechol and phenol



148

The best results of pesticide degradation were obtained when the photo-Fenton/ozone combination was applied


DIURON (saturated solution)
The pesticide solutions became detoxified after photo-Fenton/ozone treatment, except for atrazine and alachlor for which no detoxification was achieved (in the case of alachlor, the toxicity increased with increasing irradiation time)


ISOPROTURON (50 mg L−1)



149

3,4,5-TMBAk (100 mg L−1)
Respirometry (control: acetic acid; activated sludge from an industrial winery); luminescence light inhibition (Vibrio fischeri)
Based on the COD removal results, the catalytic ozonation over the N-150 catalyst achieved the best results, but further treatment was necessary

An optimal concentration of t-butanol was observed at which production of the analyzed intermediates was slowest, indicating that radicals played an important role in 4-NP ozonation at low pH



113

4-CP (25.6 mg L−1)

The reaction between the oxidant and the organic followed overall second order kinetics, and was more specifically, of first order with respect to both reactants


2,4-DCP (32.6 mg L−1)
Matrix component: t-butanol (740 mg L−1); pH = 2–9; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 500 mL

2,3,4,6-TeCP (46.2 mg L−1)


TETRACHLOROCATECHOL (49.6 mg L−1)
The second-order rate constants increased with the pH as a consequence of the increase in the degree of deprotonation of the dissolved CPs (i.e., from 103 L mol−1 s−1) to 109 L mol−1 s−1 for different CPs)


4-CHLOROGUAIACOL (31.2 mg L−1)

Ozonation and O3/UV
Almost complete decomposition of 2-CP was accomplished in 20 min by both oxidation techniques


Matrix pollutant: t-butanol (37–740 mg L−1); UV light: low-pressure mercury-vapor UV lamp (254 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 34 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 21 mg L−1; pH = 3–11; reaction time = 2 h; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 2 L


The release of chloride ions was observed early during the decomposition reaction, followed by the mineralization of organic intermediates to form carbonate ions


The presence of t-butanol promoted the decomposition of 2-CP in both processes. In alkaline solutions excessive dosages decreased the reaction rates


The behavior of 2-CP in the presence of t-butanol during both ozonation and O3/UV was described by pseudo-first order kinetics

2,4,6-TCP (39.5-73.0 mg L−1)
Ozonation and O3/H2O2
The rate constant of 2,4,6-TCP degradation by ozone increased by one order of magnitude by increasing the pH from 2 to 7.5, owing to the higher reactivity of the dissociated TCP and the contribution of ozone radical oxidation


Matrix pollutant: humic acid (2.4–56.1 mg L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 1 L min−1; H2O2 concentration = 516 mg L−1; pH = 2–8.2; reaction time = 10 min; temperature = 23 °C; volume = 500 mL


At pH 7.5, 10 min of ozonation achieved 90% TCP degradation, which corresponded to the release of approximately 2 mol Cl− per mol TCP


The presence of H2O2 did not significantly increase the TCP degradation but increased the overall dechlorination to 2.7 mol Cl− per mol TCP


The presence of humic acid enhanced the degradation rate of TCP at low relative humic acid concentrations (<0.6 g humic acid per g TCP), but reduced the rate at higher humic acid concentrations

Biodegradability
All phenolic pollutants disappeared with ozone oxidation, and consequently transformed into various organic acids


Matrix pollutant: salt; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.4 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 15 g m−3; pH = 8; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 30 °C; volume = 2 L

2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability/toxicity
The inversely proportional relationship between the 2,4-DCP degradation and the chlorine release was clearly observed


Matrix pollutant: sodium acetate (320 mg L−1) + glucose (235 mg L−1) & sodium acetate (320 mg L−1) + baby milk powder (159 mg L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 400 L h−1; ozone dosage = 6 g h−1; pH = 9; reaction time = 2, 5 and 10 min; volume = 2 L


Respirometry, using non-acclimated and pre-exposed (not fully acclimated) activated sludge
Complete mineralization was not achieved, implying the production of dehalogenated intermediates


The presence of biodegradable organic matter results in a decreased pseudo-first order degradation rate. The extent of the decrease depends on the nature of the biodegradable organic matter


A long lag phase and low maximal specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) value were observed as the most important toxicity effects


Because of ozonation, the lag phase was significantly reduced and the maximal SOUR value increased after elongating the ozone reaction time. Also, the biodegradable COD fraction increased



154

2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)
Ozonation
Biodegradability
An increase of the effluent COD concentration was observed when pre-ozonated wastewater was used as the influent of the bioreactor. The intermediate ozonation products of 2,4-DCP were not completely biodegradable. Furthermore, a higher biomass concentration and enhanced sludge settleability were observed


Matrix pollutant: artificial wastewater containing glucose (C/N/P = 100/14.4/1.9; monovalent over polyvalent cation ratio = 2.02); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 200 L h−1; Ozone dosage = 8 g h−1; pH = 9; reaction time = 30 min; volume = 40 L


Bioreactor, with activated sludge (pH 7.8, 20 °C)
Without ozone pretreatment, 2,4-DCP was completely biodegraded. However, the effluent was not clear because of small particles and a hampered settling of the sludge was observed

Reactor: bubble column glass reactor (height = 58 cm; inner diameter = 8.5 cm; fine pore diffusor of 100 μm diameter); matrix pollutant: municipal wastewater (TOC = 115 mg L−1; COD = 250 mg L−1; BOD5 = 198 mg L−1; TSS = 130 mg L−1; TDS = 548 mg L−1; NO3−-N = 10 mg L−1; PO43− = 6 mg L−1; Cl− = 30 mg L−1); UV-light: Pen-Ray UV lamp (4 nW cm−2 at a distance of 2.54 cm); O3/O2 gas flow rate = 36 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 37 mg L−1; ozone dosage = 22 mg min−1; pH = 7–8 (neutral)
BOD5 and COD measurements


Toxicity Respirometry (ISO 8192:2007; control: synthetic sewage solution)
Complete degradation of 2,5-DCP by ozone and O3/UV occurred after 60 min and 40 min, respectively


2,5-DCP degradation and dechlorination proceeded simultaneously


The pseudo-first order rate constants obtained for O3/UV were more than 1.5 times faster than the ones for ozonation


The BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.19 to 0.46 (after 40 min) and 0.5 (after 30 min) by ozonation and O3/UV, respectively


Both treatments of 40 min and 60 min created intermediate products which were not sufficiently toxic to calculate the EC50-value (initial EC50 = 57 mg L−1). Therefore, these products were less toxic than the parent compound


The presence of other organic and inorganic matter had a positive effect on the oxidation of 2,5-DCP




4.1. Degradation pathways and intermediate products
Ozone oxidizes the target molecules either directly or through the formation of hydroxyl radicals. The predominant mechanism depends on the pH of the solution and the target molecules. The direct pathway (pH ≈ 2) is based on the reaction of ozone with pollutants with specific functional groups through selective reactions such as electrophilic, nucleophilic or dipolar addition reactions.107 Under acidic conditions, rather low kinetic constants in the range of 1–1000 L mol−1 s−1 were observed.39 At high pH (>9), the ozone process favors the production of hydroxyl radicals by which the system becomes more effective in oxidizing complex mixtures. The increase in ozone degradation rates by increasing pH is confirmed by several studies.108–112 Based on their standard oxidation potentials, hydroxyl radicals are stronger oxidants than molecular ozone.113 In the system O3/OH−, the hydroxide ion reacts with ozone to yield superoxide anion radicals, which in turn are involved in a series of reactions that yield hydroxyl radicals. In the range of pH 4–9, both reaction pathways are active.39
Pera-Titus et al. proposed a general reaction scheme for the ozonation of chlorophenolic substances in aqueous solutions (Fig. 3).39 Several authors achieved satisfactory results at high pH values.22,114–116 The ozone decomposition proceeds through a chain reaction in the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals.39 However, direct ozonation can also be important, even at elevated pH values. Indeed, when the concentration of fast reacting species with molecular ozone is sufficiently high, direct ozonation will be the dominating mechanism, even at higher pH values. Within this context, Hautaniemi et al. observed no contribution of hydroxyl radical reactions to the chlorophenol oxidation rate under alkaline conditions, probably because of the high reaction rate of phenolate ions with ozone.21 Moreover, Hong and Zeng concluded that the degradation of PCP was initiated via direct nucleophilic attack by ozone as the predominant pathway, whereas both ozone and secondary hydroxyl radicals were likely to be involved in subsequent degradation of intermediates.23
 Fig. 3  General scheme of reactions for ozonation of chlorophenols in an aqueous solution.39 
Also, Benitez et al. observed an increase in the degradation rate with increasing pH (from pH 2 to 9) and ascribed this to (i) the dissociation of phenols to phenolate ions, which are able to react with ozone faster than the non-dissociated species and (ii) the faster production of hydroxyl radicals at alkaline pH.22 Moreover, ozonation was more reactive with higher substituted chlorophenols whereas hydroxyl radicals reacted faster with chlorophenols having a lower number of chlorine atoms. The reaction between ozone and the chlorophenolic substances follows overall second order kinetics and is more specifically of first order with respect to both reactants.113,117,140 Benitez et al. reported the second order rate constants of PCP ozonation at pH 2.5 and pH 9 to be 0.67 × 105 L mol−1 s−1 and 3.15 × 107 L mol−1 s−1, respectively.118 In an earlier study investigating the ozone degradation of lower substituted chlorophenols (4-CP, 2,4-DCP, 2,4,6-TCP and 2,3,4,6-TeCP), Benitez et al. reported a larger increase in the second order rate constants (from 103 L mol−1 s−1 to 109 L mol−1 s−1) by increasing the pH (from pH 2 to pH 9, respectively).113 During the ozone degradation of chlorophene, the rate constants varied from 1.67 × 103 L mol−1 s−1 at pH 3 to 1.82 × 105 L mol−1 s−1 at pH 11.110 Again, these results confirmed the faster reaction of chlorophenolics with ozone in an alkaline environment because of the deprotonation of the dissolved chlorophenols. Despite the overall second order kinetics, many studies describe the ozone-based degradation of chlorophenols, COD and/or TOC by pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to the chlorophenol concentration.21,22,119,122–125,141,142,151 In the aforementioned studies, the oxidizing agent was present in excess, hence the concentration could be assumed constant. Moreover, Benitez et al. reported the stoichiometric ratio for the oxidation of PCP by ozone to be 1.5 mol ozone consumed per mol PCP reacted.118 For the ozone degradation of 2,4-DCP, the stoichiometric coefficient of approximately 2 mol ozone per mol 2,4-DCP removed was determined by Contreras et al.141 However, ozone dosages based on mass are also reported in the literature. For example, Manojlovic et al. applied different ozone dosages for different chlorophenols, i.e., 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1, 2.0 mgO3 mgC−1 and 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1 for phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, respectively.120
During the decomposition reaction, the early release of chloride ions was observed by Hong and Zeng, Poznyak and Vivero, Ku and Wang, Peira et al. and Graham et al., indicating that dechlorination is one of the first steps in the degradation pathways.23,106,126,151,152 Graham et al. determined a chloride release of approximately 2 mol Cl− per mol 2,4,6-TPC.152 According to Benitez et al., the dechlorination is enhanced by the presence of more chlorine atoms substituted in the aromatic ring.22 Poznyak and Vivero observed the dechlorination of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, resulting in the formation of phenol and 4-CP, respectively.106 However, complete dechlorination is not always achieved, indicating the presence of chlorinated intermediates such as chlorinated aliphatic structures.114,143 Shang et al. identified chlorocatechols, chloromuconic acids and chlorinated dimeric pollutants as intermediate products formed during the ozonation of monochlorophenols.144 Also, the ozonation of PCP resulted in the formation of tetrachlorocatechol, tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone.118 Furthermore, Shang et al. reported 3-chlorocatechol and 2-chloro-2,4-hexadienedioic acid as main intermediates in the ozonation of 2 CP, whereas the ozonation of 3-CP and 4-CP resulted in the formation of 4-chlorocatechol and 3-chloro-2,4-hexadienedioic acid.142 2,4-DCP and chlorocatechol were identified as intermediate species during the ozonation of triclosan.127 Finally, hydroquinone, benzoquinone, chlorocatechol and phenol were identified as intermediate products of primary oxidation from the treatment of 4-CP by O3/UV and O3/H2O2/UV processes.116
Further treatment of the chlorophenols and intermediate products was accompanied by a decrease in pH resulting in acidic oxidation products.114 Also, the colour of the reaction mixture changed, indicating the formation of new chromophores, most likely quinones and their derivatives. Towards the end of the overall treatment, the colour of the mixture again disappeared. As oxidation end-products, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, glyoxylic acid and formic acid were observed by Beltrán et al.123 Poznyak and Vivero observed the production of oxalic and formic acid during the ozonation of phenol, 4-CP or 2,4-DCP at pH 2 and pH 7, whereas only oxalic acid was identified after ozonation at alkaline pH.106 The presence of unsaturated acids at different pH confirmed the cleavage of the aromatic ring, but by different mechanisms.
Only a few studies focused on the effect of other substances on the ozone degradation of chlorophenolic pollutants. The influence of the presence of t-butanol in chlorophenol-containing solutions was investigated by Kuosa et al., Benitez et al. and Ku and Wang.112,113,151 Benitez et al. used t-butanol as a hydroxyl radical scavenger to determine the rate constants for the direct ozonation of chlorophenols.113 Ku and Wang observed an enhancement of the decomposition of 2-CP by both ozonation and O3/UV processes because of the presence of t-butanol.151 However, in an alkaline environment, excessive dosages of t-butanol decreased the reaction rates. Furthermore, during the ozonation of 4-NP at low pH, the effect of t-butanol on the production of intermediates was investigated by Kuosa et al.112 Also the presence of humic acid influenced the degradation rate of 2,4,6-TCP.152 At low relative humic acid concentrations (<0.6 g humic acid per g TCP) the reaction rates were enhanced. However, the opposite was observed at higher humic acid concentrations. The combined ozone oxidation and activated sludge treatment of 2,4-DCP, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T with or without artificial seawater containing NaCl, MgSO4, MgCl2, CaCl2 and KCl was examined by Nakamura et al.115 Ding et al. used pre-ozonation treatment to control halophenol formation in seawater during chlorination.150 These few publications indicated the importance of degradation studies of pollutants present in a mixture of different components. However, the focus of most of the studies on the ozonation of chlorophenolic pollutants is on the evaluation of degradation levels or the identification of reaction intermediate products. In this context, an opinion paper by Oller et al. reports the need for more studies on individual and global degradation efficiencies by AOPs in multiple substrate solutions.3
4.2. Toxicity and biodegradability assessment of intermediate products
The complete mineralization of recalcitrant organic matter by AOPs into CO2 and inorganic end-products has been reported to be only achieved after long reaction times, even when the half-life time of the original contaminant was very short.156,157 Therefore, the determination of the original pollutant concentrations is only a partial measure of the efficiency of the treatment.114 Moreover, the formation of both early toxic intermediates (such as chlorocatechols) and low molecular weight (organic acids) or hydroxylated pollutants was reported.23,144 The latter intermediate products were considered to be less toxic and more biodegradable than the parent pollutants.115,140,143 In the context of coupling pre-ozonation with subsequent biological treatment, an appropriate toxicity and/or biodegradability assessment of the intermediate products as an additional wastewater characteristic is necessary. Unfortunately, an evaluation of the toxicity and/or biodegradability of the intermediates is not always discussed. In this literature overview, only 37% of the studies included toxicity and/or biodegradability measurements. However, the importance of toxicity and biodegradability tests is crucial, as was pointed out by Oller et al.3
Currently no single standard parameter or method is suitable to assess the toxicity of pretreated phenolic solutions. The geno- and cytotoxicity of triclosan and intermediate ozonation products were determined by Chen et al. using an alkaline comet assay and MTT (C,N-diphenyl-N′-4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yltetrazolium bromide) test on Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively.145 In many cases, (acute) Microtox assays were applied using specific bacteria. Adams et al. used Microtox assays to conclude that ozonation significantly decreases the toxicity of solutions containing chloro-, nitro- or aminophenols.146 The IC50-value of 2-CP, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, i.e., 17.95 mg L−1, 8.07 mg L−1 and 2.68 mg L−1, respectively, was determined using Daphnia magna.140 The same organisms were used by Peternel et al. to determine a toxicity decay of approximately 41% after O3/H2O2/UV oxidation of 130 mg L−1 4-CP.116 An increased toxicity based on the growth of Photobacterium phosphoreum was observed after ozonation of monochlorophenols.144 With the exception of atrazine and alachlor, Farré et al. observed lower toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri after photocatalytic ozonation of pesticide solutions.148 Based on Microtox assays using the same bacteria, Benitez et al. concluded that the generated intermediate products were less toxic than the parent pollutant (chlorophene).110 A colorimetric method based on the reduction of the redox-active dye resazurin by bacterial respiration was used to evaluate the detoxification of PCP and early toxic intermediates by ozonation.23
Shang et al. used both Microtox assays on Photobacterium phosphoreum and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) inhibition tests on activated sludge to evaluate the acute toxicity of pure CPs and ozonated solutions.142 The OUR inhibition test, based on respirometry, was also applied by Martins and Quinta-Ferreira and Alexander and Ramirez-Cortina, and used a bacterial consortium representative for the aerobic biological treatment.149,155 Therefore, this method is particularly suitable for evaluating the detoxification caused by pre-ozonation.
Several authors assessed the enhancement of biodegradability of phenolic solutions based on the evolution of the BOD5/COD ratio during ozonation.23,106,141,143,147,149,155 This ratio provides an approximate index of the proportion of organic substances that are biodegradable under aerobic conditions for a predetermined period of time.3 Whenever the BOD5/COD ratio exceeded a value of 0.3–0.4, the pre-treated wastewater is considered to be degradable in an aerobic biological treatment.158–161 Hsu et al. reported that pre-ozonation of chlorophenolic pollutants was found to enhance the effectiveness of a subsequent biological treatment.147 Poznyak and Vivero stated that the effect of the preliminary ozonation to the biodegradability of phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP is significant and increases at alkaline pH.106
Otherwise, respirometric measurements (short analysis) and long-term biodegradability assays were used to evaluate the behaviour of activated sludge when pre-ozonated wastewater was added.115,141,143,146,149 Martins and Quinta-Ferreira determined the oxygen consumption rate during biodegradation of a pre-treated synthetic phenolic mixture and compared this value with the OUR-value obtained during degradation of acetic acid, which is considered as readily biodegradable.149 Based on respirometry, the ozonation and catalytic ozonation realized an increased biodegradability from 0% to 18% and to 61%, respectively. A significant enhancement of biodegradability was not observed by evaluating BOD5/COD ratios. Based on SOUR-profiles, Van Aken et al. identified a long lag phase and low maximal SOUR value as the most important toxicity effects of 2,4-DCP present in a multiple substrate solution.153 The lag phase was significantly reduced and the maximal SOUR value was increased by increasing the ozone reaction time. Furthermore, by pre-treating the wastewater containing 2,4-DCP, sodium acetate and glucose for 10 min ozone reaction time, the ratio of the biodegradable COD fraction increases from 78% to 90% for non-acclimated biomass and from 77% to 85% for pre-exposed biomass. Indeed, the respirometric measurements and the derived OUR-values provide useful information to evaluate process efficiency. Eslami et al. even calculated a biodegradability and toxicity value by comparing OUR values of a wastewater sample with a high biodegradable compound, such as acetic acid.162
To respond to acclimation effects of biomass in the long term, Adams et al. investigated the pre-ozonation of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP and observed an increase in COD removal by 50% during biodegradation of the pre-ozonated solutions.146 The change of TOC of ozonated endocrine-disrupting chemicals (2,4-DCP, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T) in water after activated sludge treatment was observed by Nakamura et al.115 They observed no TOC reduction during biotreatment of 2,4-DCP without pre-ozonation, whereas, after 30 min ozonation, the TOC reduction caused by the activated sludge treatment increased up to 67%. The effectiveness of ozonation as pre-treatment of DCP solutions was shown by feeding the pre-ozonated effluent to aerobic reactors, achieving up to 80% of TOC removal. Also other ozone-based systems (O3/H2O2, O3/UV, O3/UV/H2O2 and O3/UV/Fe) were investigated, but, compared to single ozonation, no significant improvement was achieved regarding biodegradability enhancement. Van Aken et al. investigated the effect of pre-ozonation prior to a biological treatment experimentally by using a pilot-scale reactor.154 Firstly, the activated sludge was adapted to a glucose based artificial wastewater. After stabilization, the wastewater was spiked with 2,4-DCP and ozonated before introduced to the bioreactor. The effluent COD increased, indicating that the ozonation intermediates were not completely biodegradable. However, the biomass concentration was increased and the sludge settleability improved. Recently, a few authors used live/dead staining in long-term biodegradability studies to evaluate the biomass viability.163,164 However, the advanced oxidation processes applied in these studies were not ozone-based.
To eliminate the toxicity attributed to ozonation by-products, Bourgin et al. suggested biological filtration, i.e., biological activated carbon (BAC), as a sufficient post-treatment of ozonation.165 Indeed, ozonation can cause the increment of some toxicity endpoints. Furthermore, the carbon-bed life of the BAC can be prolonged by converting recalcitrant organics to biodegradable organics by pre-ozonation.166 In this BAC process, bacteria are trapped within the activated carbon, causing the in situ biological regeneration of sorption sites. When recalcitrant organics are degraded into biodegradable organics, the attached microorganisms then mineralize them before they can occupy adsorption sites on the activated carbon.167 In general, BAC processes are applied to treat secondary effluents containing organic pollutants in the range of 1 ng L−1 to 200 μg L−1.168–170 Speitel et al. studied the biodegradation of substituted phenols in granular activated carbon columns and concluded that para-nitrophenol and 2,4-DCP are readily biodegradation at influent concentrations less than 10 μg L−1.170 PCP was also found to be biodegradable, however, at a lower rate. Moreover, a substantial fraction of 2,4-DCP was irreversibly adsorbed, indicating negligible bioregeneration of the activated carbon. Remarkably, the combination of ozonation and the BAC process is widely used for drinking water production, however, only rarely investigated for the treatment of secondary effluents.169 Only a few studies have been dedicated to demonstration of the feasibility of ozone-based techniques in combination with BAC. The conversion of biorecalcitrant pollutants, such as phenol, benzoic acid and aminobenzoic acid, by a laboratory scale pre-ozonation and lifted moving-bed BAC treatment was investigated by Lin et al.171 Compared to GAC adsorption, the ozone-BAC system can be used 4–5 times longer. Furthermore, the enhanced COD removal capability of the biofilm is caused by both the increase of the COD removal capability of the acclimated bacteria and the species succession of bacteria in the biofilm. The removal of micro-pollutants, such as 2,4-dichloro-benzanamine, 2,7-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) phenol and 4-bromo-3-chloroaninline, by ozonation, O3/UV and TiO2/UV/O3 in combination with BAC was demonstrated on secondary effluents of a municipal sewage treatment plan in Beijing City (China).169,172 Remarkably, the organic matter with a molecular weight (MW) < 10000 Da was mostly removed by TiO2/UV/O3. Also UV/O3 obtained a high removal rate in this MW range. However, ozonation showed the best decomposition for the organic matter with a MW > 10000 Da. The TiO2/UV/O3 treatment resulted in the disappearance of some aromatic compounds, including 4-bromo-3-chloroaniline, 2,4-dichloro-benzenamine and 3,5-dimethoxy-acetophenone and the formation of small molecules, e.g., 1,3-cyclohexanediamine, 9-octadecenamide, tert-butyldimethylsilanol and phenol. These organics were mostly reduced by the subsequent BAC treatment. Gerrity et al. examined an alternative treatment strategy, including ultrafiltration/sand filtration, ozone/H2O2 and BAC, for indirect potable reuse of the secondary effluent from the Reno-Stead Water Reclamation Facility.168 The ozone/H2O2 and BAC processes were extremely effective in reducing the concentrations of trace organic contaminants, including bisphenol A, octylphenol, triclosan and ibuprofen. The feasibility of the treatment train was demonstrated in pilot scale installations. Nevertheless, specific studies covering the removal of chlorophenols by ozone (or ozone-based techniques) and BAC as a last finishing step are limited. Additional work on this topic is recommended.
4.3. Novel trends
The efficiency of ozone-related processes is limited by the low dissolved ozone concentration in aqueous solutions.151 An intense contact between the gas and liquid phase is necessary to enhance the mass transfer of ozone. Traditionally, the contact between both phases is mostly achieved in a bubble column.23,114,127,128,140,144 The properties of the liquid and the type of diffusor at the bottom of the column determine the size of the bubbles, and consequently the contact area between the gas and liquid phase. Also, venturi-like injectors are used.143 As a first fluid (water) traverses the constricted throat of the venturi, a pressure drop is created, which implicates the draw-up of a second fluid (ozone gas). Chedeville et al. compared different gas/liquid contactors and concluded that both volumetric mass transfer coefficients and gas retention rates of the venturi were higher, compared to the bubble column.121 Recently, the use of a microchannel reactor for the ozonation of PCP in solution was investigated by Ren et al.119 Typical Taylor flow patterns were observed under the investigated experimental conditions, resulting in an excellent performance for the ozone mass transfer efficiency. Moreover, apparent pseudo-first order reaction rate constants between 2.10 s−1 and 1.13 s−1 were reported.
The application of ozone as a chemical oxidant for the degradation of chlorophenolic pollutants has already been discussed. However, this oxidation technique did not achieve a complete mineralization of the water pollutants. To overcome this drawback, different approaches are discussed in the literature. Aziz et al. investigated the efficiencies of ozonation, photocatalysis and non-thermal plasma and compared these techniques based on the energy yield and degree of mineralization.138 They concluded that the appropriate method for extensive mineralization should be photocatalytic ozonation or a plasma assisted destruction. Zhang et al. investigated the adsorption of 2,4,6-TCP on a high-silica zeolite adsorbent, which was regenerated by ozonation.129 After the first regeneration with ozone, the TCP adsorption was significantly enhanced (from 52% up to 87% TCP removal). The improved adsorption capacity remained until the 8th adsorption cycle. Afterwards a dramatic decrease of TCP removal was observed. The authors ascribed this to a decrease in pH and the presence of intermediate products, which interfered with the TCP adsorption. Another approach to enhance the mineralization of chlorophenolic pollutants is catalytic or photocatalytic ozonation using metal oxides. These ozone-based oxidation techniques are considered to be environmentally friendly and highly effective.125,130 The combination of ozone and UV-light accelerates the decomposition rate of different chlorophenols, with an extremely high rate constant for 4-CP.22 Both catalysts TiO2 and Fe(II) ions improved the reaction efficiency of the photocatalytic ozonation of 2,4-D.126 Villaseñor et al. investigated the manganese-supported TiO2 catalyst for the degradation of phenol.131 The catalytic behaviour in the absence of irradiation did not show significant changes for the manganese-supported catalyst. However, irradiated systems achieved increased phenol degradation, resulting in CO2 and small organic acids as final products. Several studies reported the improved mineralization using TiO2 as a photocatalyst during ozonation of chlorophenolic pollutants.123,124,127,132,148 Other catalysts such as β-FeOOH nanorods, MgO, Ni containing fly ash and sawdust, ZnO, and Zn–C nanotubes were also reported to improve the overall degradation efficiency.125,130,133,134,139
Nowadays, bimetallic catalysts are attracting increasing interest because of their synergistic behaviour which makes catalysts more effective and durable.135 Martins and Quinta-Ferreira used lanthanide cerium (Ce) combined with manganese (Mn) to catalyze the ozonation of different phenolic acids.149 The use of the catalyst Mn–Ce–O in the ozone-based system resulted in a substantial improvement of both organic removal and biodegradability level. An increased conversion and good product selectivity for partial oxidation was observed during the ozonation of 2,4,6-TCP catalysed by a Ce–Zr loaded metal oxide.135 The lanthanide metals are characterized by their special electronic structure (4f × 5dy), resulting in the formation of labile oxygen vacancies with a relatively high mobility of bulk oxygen species.173
Recently, electro-oxidation was coupled with ozonation for the degradation of phenol and 4-CP by Hurtado et al.136 Interestingly, less energy (on the basis of TOC removal) was consumed compared to other oxidation processes. The photoelectron-peroxone/zero valent iron process was studied for several emerging pollutants including 4-CP and showed effective results for the treatment of actual industrial wastewaters in terms of COD, TOC and color.137
5. Conclusion
Both biological and ozone-based oxidation processes are already well defined for the degradation of chlorophenolic pollutants. The major topics in the biodegradation of these pollutants are focused on the use of specific cultures, co-metabolic degradation and novel biological processes such as biomass immobilization or granular activated sludge. Conversely, only a few studies reported the use of mixed cultures and the acclimation of biomass to enhance the biodegradation process. Also, the treatment feasibility is most frequently evaluated based on global and specific degradation efficiencies only. Furthermore, ozone-based processes have been shown to degrade chlorophenols and to enhance the subsequent biological process. The focus of scientific research on this topic is addressed to the degradation of single pollutants or the enhancement of the oxidation potential of ozone by using catalysts or UV light. Only a few attempts report experimental results on the chlorophenol degradation in multiple substrate solutions. Also, the need was demonstrated for additional toxicity and/or biodegradability assessments to evaluate intermediate products. Currently, toxicity assessments are mainly focused on the inhibition of specific microorganisms whereas activated sludge contains a differentiated microbial community. Also, the behaviour (or activity) of the biomass, for example by respirometry, was only monitored in a few studies.

Water impact
Chlorophenol contamination is a serious threat to receiving water bodies. Hence, the treatment of chlorophenolic wastewater is critical. Both biological and ozone-based oxidation processes are well defined for chlorophenol degradation. By highlighting the state-of-the-art, the applicability of these techniques is shown. Furthermore, novel trends including immobilized biomass or the need for ozone degradation studies in multiple substrate solutions were identified.

89
	4-CP (1.5 mg L−1) in artificial wastewater	Inoculum: municipal activated sludge	During the first 6 days, the 4-CP concentration of the effluent exceeded 0.6 mg L−1, indicating the inhibition of the sludge activity caused by the toxicity of 4-CP. In the following period, the 4-CP concentration in the effluent decreased below 0.2 mg L−1 by the enrichment of 4-CP degrading bacteria

Flow rate = 1041 mL h−1; UASB
Volume = 12.5 L; HRT = 12 h; VSS = 19.0–22.0 kg VSS m−3 (UASB-I); 16.0–19.0 kg VSS m−3 (UASB-II); SS = 48.0–49.0 kg SS m−3 (UASB-I); 35.0–36.5 kg SS m−3 (UASB-II); RBC; volume = 24 L (RBC-I for 2-CP degradation) 30 L (RBC-II for 2,4-DCP degradation); VSS biofilm = 6.2 mg cm−2 (RBC-I); 7.5 mg cm−2 (RBC-II); VSS/SS ratio = 0.80
Experiment:	The effect of shock loadings was most visible in the UASB reactor. The chlorophenol and COD removal as well as the gas production decreased slightly
Carbon sources: sodium formate (5.0 g L−1); sodium propionate (1.4 g L−1); glucose (1.4 g L−1); methanol (1.25 mL L−1); supplementary feed for RBC:

90
	2-CP (50–700 mg L−1)	Inoculum: municipal activated sludge	The AnBR tolerated inlet 2-CP concentrations of up to 500 mg L−1 (2-CP biodegradation efficiency >99% at HRT = 4 h)
Cultivation: 100 mg L−1 2-CP (56 days)	The increase of inlet 2-CP concentration had a higher inhibitory effect on the 2-CP biodegradation than the increase of the inlet flowrate
Granular AnBR:l	The AnBR efficiently recovered following different shock loading conditions
Mass ratio of NO3− to 2-CP = 5; HRT = 2–24 h; salinity = 0.5–40 g L−1 NaCl; temperature = 24 °C; exposure time = 167 days
The biodegradation of 2-CP was coupled to the use of nitrate

103
	4-CP (1–15 mg L−1)	Inoculum: aerobic granular sludge	At 4-CP concentrations of 5 and 10 mg L−1, NH4-N removal efficiencies decreased to 87.2% and 41.2%, respectively (control: 99.8%)
Cultivation: high-strength nitrogen wastewater containing glucose (SBR with HRT = 12 h & 50% vol. exch.)	Heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria activity were significantly inhibited by the presence of 4-CP
Batch exposure experiments:	The presence of 4-CP also played an important role in the EPS production
Synthetic wastewater + 4-CP; exposure time = 6 h; DO > 2 mgO2 L−1; temperature = 25 °C

104
	Mixtures of o-CRESOL (40–100 mgC L−1), o-CP (20–30 mgC L−1) and p-NPm (45–200 mgC L−1)	Inoculum: activated sludge	The influent containing p-NP, o-cresol and o-CP caused the complete failure of the SBR
Cultivation: p-NP, granular	The phenolic-degrading species in the granules were identified as Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Arthrobacter sp.
Batch experiments:
pH = 7.5; temperature = 25 °C; DO = 4 mgO2 L−1
Long-term SBR experiments:

Degradation by ozonation


21
	2-CP (52.7 mg L−1) 4-CP (52.7 mg L−1) 2,4-CP (66.8 mg L−1)	Ozonation	The chlorophenol ozonation reactions in alkaline solutions followed pseudo-first order kinetics
Ozone concentration in the gas phase = 0.5 mg L−1; pH = 9.5
In the final phase, the simulations predicted faster chlorophenol decomposition and lower ozone consumption than those observed experimentally because of the formation of intermediate products rapidly reacting with ozone
Hydroxyl radical reactions did not make any contribution to the chlorophenol oxidation rate under alkaline conditions, probably because of the high reaction rate of the phenolate ions with ozone at pH conditions favorable for hydroxyl radical oxidation

114
	2-CP (50 mg L−1) 4-CP (50 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (65 mg L−1) 2,4,6-TCP (80 mg L−1) 2,3,4,6-TeCP (90 mg L−1) PCP (105 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Ozonation under alkaline conditions led to the most efficient removal of all of the CPs studied
Reactor: bubble column; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 0.5 mg L−1; pH = 2.5 or 9.5; reaction time = 2.5–45 min; volume = 100 mL
The removal of CPs under alkaline conditions was accompanied by a decrease of pH revealing the presence of acidic oxidation products; also, the color of the reaction mixture changes indicates the formation of new chromophores (most probably quinones and their derivatives); towards the end of the overall treatment time, the color of the mixture disappeared
Typical intermediate products formed during oxidation of chlorophenols were chlorobenzenediols
Oxidation of chlorophenols was effective, but incomplete dechlorination indicated the presence of chlorinated intermediates (chlorinated aliphatic structures)

117
	PCP (1.25–2.5 mg L−1)	Ozonation	The overall reaction is second order with first order each for the concentrations of PCP and ozone
Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 0.72–13.44 mg L−1; pH = 2–7; reaction time = 5–20 min; temperature = 10–40 °C
Depending on the solution pH, PCP can be present in both molecular and ionic forms, and pentachlorophenolate reacts much faster with ozone than PCP

118
	PCP (2.85–10 mg L−1)	Ozonation	The stoichiometric ratio for the oxidation of PCP by ozone was 1.5 mol of ozone consumed per mol of PCP reacted
pH = 2.5–9; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 500 mL
Rate constants between 0.67 × 105 L mol−1 s−1 (at pH 2.5) and 3.15 × 107 L mol−1 s−1 (at pH 9) were determined
The specific ozonation rate constant for the dissociated and undissociated form of PCP were determined, i.e., 9.10 × 106 L mol−1 s−1 and 1.00 × 104 L mol−1 s−1, respectively
Main intermediate products: tetrachlorocatechol, tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone

119
	PCP (10–80 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Typical Taylor flow patterns were observed
Reactor: microchannel; superficial gas velocity = 0.1–0.5 m s−1; superficial liquid velocity = 0.5–10.5 m s−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 13–40 mg L−1; pH = 6–12
The microchannel reactor demonstrated an excellent performance in the ozone mass transfer efficiency and the ozonation of PCP
The ozonation of PCP was a pseudo-first order reaction, and the apparent reaction rate constant, observed at different PCP concentrations (10–80 mg L−1), varied between 2.10–2.13 1/s

120
	4-CP (6 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (6 mg L−1) PHENOL (6 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Removal efficiencies for phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP were determined to be 98.9%, 99.8% and 98.9%, respectively
Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 7–40 mg L−1; ozone dosage = 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1, 2.0 mgO3 mgC−1 and 2.6 mgO3 mgC−1 for phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, respectively; reaction time = 96 h; volume = 5 L

121
	PHENOL	Ozonation	The ejector had a higher volumetric mass transfer coefficient and gas retention rate
1. Pilot with ejector
Reactor: tank with circulation containing heat exchanger, ejector and mixture tube (0.5–1 m3 h−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.1–0.8 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5% in weight; pH = 2.7–11.3; temperature = 20–35 °C; volume = 30 L
2. Bubble column
Reactor: cylindrical body with spherical head, with circulation (0.16 m3 h−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.2 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5% in weight; pH = 2.7–11.3; volume = 2.5 L
By increasing the pH, the ejector achieved better results for phenol degradation
For the diffusion-controlled regime (ozonation at high pH), the ejector allowed treatment of an important flow rate in a short time, with efficient mass transfer

Degradation by ozone-based processes


22
	4-CP (40 mg L−1) 2,4-DCP (50 mg L−1) 2,4,6-TCP (60 mg L−1) 2,3,4,6-TeCP (70 mg L−1)	Ozonation and O3/UV	Ozonation
UV light: high pressure mercury vapor lamp (185–436 nm); pH = 2 or 9; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 350 mL	Ozone is more reactive with higher substituted CPs whereas hydroxyl radicals react faster with those chlorophenols having a lower number of chlorine atoms
For ozonation under acidic conditions, the increase in the number of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring provided an increase in the degradation rate (the presence of more chlorine atoms enhanced the dechlorination step)
The most important fact observed is the increase of the rate constant (pseudo-first order) with increasing pH (from 2 to 9) because of the faster production of hydroxyl radicals at alkaline pH and the dissociation of phenols to phenolate ions that are able to react faster with ozone than the non-dissociated species
O3/UV
This combination accelerates the decomposition rate, with an extremely high rate constant for 4-CP, and lower rates for the other CPs
All CPs, apart from 4-CP, presented slightly increasing rate constants when the substituent chlorine atoms increase

122
	2,4-D (300 mg L−1)	O3/UV & photocatalytic ozonation	O3/UV
Photocatalyst: titanium dioxide coated glass fiber; UV-light: black light (6 × 20 W); ozone concentration in the gas phase = 1.4 mg L−1; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 310 mL min−1; pH = 3–11; temperature = room temperature (18–22 °C); volume = 500 mL	By increasing both the ozone concentration in the gas phase and the pH, the degradation rate of 2,4-D increased
At pH 9, a first-order rate constant of 0.00544 min−1 was observed
Photocatalytic ozonation
At pH 9, a first-order rate constant of 0.00166 min−1 was observed
The lower rate constant was ascribed to either the inhibiting effect of O3 on photocatalysis or the decay of ozone at the large catalyst surface without any reaction with 2,4-D
Compared to O3/UV, a higher mineralization rate of TOC was observed (from 139 mg L−1 to 27.4 mg L−1, instead of 118 mg L−1)

123
	4-CP (200 mg L−1) 4-NPa (200 mg L−1) PHENOL (200 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV, catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation	The highest mineralization rate of the phenolic pollutants was achieved by photocatalytic ozonation (100%, 90% and 75% mineralization for phenol, 4-CP and 4-NP, respectively)
Reactor: tubular photoreactor; catalyst: TiO2 (1.5 g L−1); UV light: high pressure mercury lamp (700 W, 238–579 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 51 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; pH = 2.9–6.1; volume = 900 mL
Identified intermediates 4-CP: hydroquinone, resorcinol, benzoquinone, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, glyoxylic acid, formic acid
All processes followed pseudo-first order kinetics for phenol removal

124
	2,4-Db (10 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV and photocatalytic ozonation	Decay of 2,4-D and TOC by all oxidation processes was accurately described by the first-order reaction kinetics
Catalyst: TiO2 silica gel powder (5 g L−1); UV light: UV tube lamp (10 W, 254 nm); air/O3 gas flow rate = 1.0 L min−1; ozone dosage in the gas phase = 0.5–3 mg (L−1.min−1); pH < 4.6; reaction time = 80 min; temperature = 10–30 °C; volume = 1.3 L
Removal of 2,4-D and TOC was significantly enhanced in the photocatalytic ozonation system, and further enhancement was observed with larger ozone supplies (2,4-D k-value of photocatalytic ozonation was 1.4–1.7 times higher than the sum of corresponding k-values of ozonation and UV/TiO2)

125
	2-CP (100 mg L−1)	Catalytic ozonation	The increase of the catalyst ratio seemed to increase the catalytically activity sites, which could improve the 2-chlorophenol ozonation oxidation reaction rate as well
Catalyst: Ni-containing fly ash and sawdust; liquid/solid ratio = 2:1, 5:1, 10:1; pH = 7–11; Reaction time = 12 min; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 200 mL
The increase of pH resulted in the decrease of 2-chlorophenol removal efficiency with the catalyst
The 2-CP ozonation process followed the pseudo-first order kinetic model, and the reaction rate constant of catalytic ozonation increased by 267%, compared to single ozonation
Oxidation products: first phenol, then oxalic acid as the main end product

126
	2,4-D (440 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV and photocatalytic ozonation	Both catalysts improved the reaction efficiency when compared with only ozone and UV light, and best results were obtained with Fe(II)/UV/O3 combination
Catalyst: TiO2 (Degussa P-25; 2 g L−1) and Fe(II) (10–85 mg L−1); UV light: 6 W Philips black-light fluorescent lamp (300–420 nm); ozone dosage = 1.4 g h−1; pH = 2–10; reaction time = 120 min; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 100 mL
Dechlorination seemed to be one of the first steps of the degradation reaction

127
	2-CP (65 mg L−1) 2,4-D (22 mg L−1) BDDABc (38 mg L−1) BNSd (27 mg L−1) BPAe (23 mg L−1) DBSf (35 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV, photocatalytic ozonation	The mineralization process was enhanced by the combination of photocatalysis and ozonation methodologies
Reactor: ozone bubbling tube followed by solar photoreactor; catalyst: TiO2 (nanoparticulate; 0.5–2.0 g L−1); UV light: solar light harvest (area = 3.06 m2); ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 3 mg L−1; temperature = increased to ±45 °C; volume = 100–500 L (from the feed tank continuously circulated over the bubbling tube and photoreactor at a rate of 7 L min−1)
The dechlorination of 2-CP occurred more rapidly by increasing the amount of the TiO2 catalyst, with the optimal loading being 1.0 g L−1
Both the aromatic ring cleavage and dechlorination were presumed to occur simultaneously in the first initial step of the photocatalytic ozonation of 2-CP
The complete mineralization of 2,4-D, BPA, DBS and BNS present in the simulated wastewaters was achieved within 3 h of photocatalytic ozonation, whereas BDDAB was somewhat recalcitrant to photodegradation

128
	PHENOL (93–105 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV, O3/H2O2 and O3/UV/H2O2	None of the ozone combinations (O3/UV, O3/H2O2 and O3/UV/H2O2) improved the degradation rate (pseudo-first order kinetic) of the ozone process (alkaline conditions), even resulting in a limited inhibitory effect
Reactor: bubble column with a co-current circulation of gas and liquid; UV light: mercury vapor lamp (253.7 nm); O2 gas flow rate = 100 L h−1; ozone dosage = 0.2–0.3 g h−1; pH = 3–9; temperature = 16–20 °C; volume = 2.5 L
Based on the obtained degradation rate and the lower costs, the most appealing choice for phenol degradation was ozonation (even above other oxidation techniques such as UV/H2O2 and Fenton)

129
	2,4,6-TCP (50 mg L−1)	Adsorption–ozonation	TCP adsorption onto the adsorbent was significantly enhanced after the first regeneration with ozone (TCP removal increased from 52% up to 87%)
Adsorbent: high-silica FAUg zeolite; adsorption: 400 mL of 50 mg L−1 + 10 g zeolite; 2 h; room temperature; pH 6.2–6.5; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 45–50 mg L−1; ozone concentration in water = 7 mg L−1; after ozonation, the adsorption was repeated; temperature = room temperature
Elevated adsorption capacity remained until the 8th adsorption cycle, afterwards a dramatic dropdown of TCP removal was observed, possibly because of matrix carbon and pH decrease

130
	4-CP (250 mg L−1)	Catalytic ozonation	In the presence of the catalyst, a degradation efficiency of 99% was determined after 40 min ozonation (only 67% when only ozone was used)
Catalyst: β-FeOOH nanorods (0.01 g); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 10 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 28.24 mg L−1; pH = 3.5-10; volume = 100 mL
A maximum of 97% COD was removed using 0.1 g/100 mL catalyst load

131
	PHENOL (100 mg L−1)	Catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation	Primary oxidation products: resorcinol, catechol and hydroquinone
Catalyst: Mn (10%)/TiO2 (1.5 g); UV light: UV mercury lamp (General Electric, 220–380 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 50 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 2.15 mg L−1; pH = 3; reaction time = 3 h; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 100 mL
The product distribution was oriented to more oxidized products (pyruvic, maleic acids and CO2) when the catalyst was irradiated with UV light
The phenol reacted only with ozone and not with hydroxyl radicals. The intermediate ozonation products reacted with both oxidants

132
	2,4-D (10 mg L−1)	Ozonation, catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation	Photocatalytic ozonation with the fiber catalyst was efficient in mineralizing low concentrations of 2,4-D in water (pseudo-first order)
Catalyst: TiO2 fiber; UV light: UV tube lamp (10 W, 254 nm); air/O3 gas flow rate = 1.0 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 2 mg L−1; pH = not controlled (initial pH = 4.32–4.36); reaction time = 2 h; volume = 7.5 L
The photocatalytic ozonation process was characterized by few aromatic intermediates with low abundance, fast degradations of the aliphatic intermediates despite their relatively large number and dechlorination as a major step
The enhanced mineralization was because of increased ozone dissolution and decomposition, and due to reduced electron–hole recombination in the presence of TiO2 resulting in large amounts of hydroxyl radical formation

133
	2,4,6-TCP (0.5 mg L−1)	Catalytic ozonation	ZnO promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals and increased the rate of ozone consumption
Catalyst: ZnO (2–10 mg L−1; nanometer, submicrometer, micrometer); ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 2.5 mg L−1; pH = 7.5; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 2.5 L
Under the same conditions, the presence of the catalyst resulted in an increase of the 2,4,6-TCP removal rate
The loss of bound chlorine was observed as one of the first steps of 2,4,6-TCP degradation
The catalytic ozonation by ZnO followed a radical-type mechanism, by which the catalyst was able to initiate or promote hydroxyl radical production
The nano-ZnO particles displayed unique catalytic activity, different from micro-ZnO and submicro-ZnO particles

134
	4-CP (100 mg L−1)	Catalytic ozonation	The catalytic ozonation on MgO substantially enhanced the removal of 4-CP and TOC, when compared to ozonation only
Catalyst: MgO (crystal facet of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0)); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.5 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 1000 mL
The mechanism involved hydroxyl radicals in all processes

135
	2,4,6-TCP (100 mg L−1)	Catalytic ozonation	Increased conversion of 2,4,6-TCP was observed at higher pH-values
Catalyst: Ce–Zr loaded metal oxide; ozone dosage = 14.4 mg h−1; reaction time = 5 h; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 50 mL
All reaction products were dechlorinated
Oxidation products: dihydroxyfumaric acid, oxalic acid
At pH 11, metal oxide supported Ce–Zr catalysts are found to have good product selectivity for partial oxidation

136
	PHENOL (100 mg L−1)4-CP (100 mg L−1)	Coupled electro-oxidation/ozonation	Identified intermediates phenol: hydroquinone, benzoquinone, catechol, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, formic acid
Reactor: upflow bubble column (gas plate diffusor) adapted with two boron doped diamond electrodes (20 cm × 2.5 cm) separated at a distance of 1 cm; superficial area of electrodes = 50 cm2; electrolyte = 0.1 M Na2SO4; current density = 60 mA cm−2 for phenol degradation, 30 mA cm−2 for 4-CP degradation; applied potential = 11.25 V; air/O3 gas flow rate = 0.05 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 5 mg L−1; pH = 7; reaction time = 120 min; temperature = room temperature; volume = 1 L
Identified intermediates 4-CP: hydroquinone, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid
Complete phenol and 4-CP degradation is achieved in only 60 min and 120 min, respectively
Complete TOC mineralization is only observed during phenol degradation after 100 min treatment
The energy consumption on the basis of TOC removal was calculated to compare with other oxidation processes and the process offering less energy consumption was the coupled process
The main reason for incomplete mineralization was because of the stability of oxalic acid formed as an intermediate product during the oxidation process

137
	4-CP (50 mg L−1)	Photoelectro-peroxone/ZVI process	The 4-CP degradation by the photoelectro-peroxone/ZVI process had the lowest rate constant, i.e., 0.1809 min−1, compared to metanil yellow, benzotriazole, tetracycline and carmoisine. However, the rate constants are all of the same order of magnitude
Reactor: quartz cylinder (cathode: graphite felt; anode: platinum sheet); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.25 L min−1; DC power supply: 3.000 A, 30 V; UV light: low pressure UVC lamp (4 W, 254 nm, 1.51 mW cm−2)); temperature = 25–28 °C
For pollutants with large molecules (higher organic carbon, i.e., tetracycline, carmoisine, metanil yellow), the TOC removals were approximately 20–25% lower than others (i.e.,4-CP and benzotriazole)

138
	2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1) 2,4-D (100 mg L−1)	Ozonation, photocatalytic ozonation	Despite the low mineralization, direct ozonation was an effective process for the decomposition of 2,4-DCP and 2,4-D. The mineralization was enhanced by combining ozonation with photocatalysis, resulting in a nearly complete TOC removal. A similar significant improvement in degradation and mineralization was observed when the plasma under an argon atmosphere was combined with Fenton oxidation
Reactor: planar falling film; UV light: UVA lamps (15 W, 360 nm); O2 gas flow rate = 10 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 130 mg L−1; pH = 3.35 and 6.85; volume = 0.5 L
Non-thermal plasma
Reactor: dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor; ceramic plates (3 mm thickness); high voltage electrode: self-adhesive aluminum foil; ground electrode: self-adhesive copper strips; pulse generator: 21 kV (RMS) at 5 and 20 kHz

139
	4-Chloro-3-methylphenol (50 mg L−1)	Ozonation, catalytic ozonation	The TOC removal rate constant of Zn-CNTs/O3 was 4.9 times higher compared to single ozonation
Reactor: 1.2 L cylindrical glass reactor; catalyst: zinc–carbon nanotubes (ZN-CNTs) composite (1–4 g L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 200–600 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 34 mg L−1; (initial) pH = 3–12; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 0.5 L
The mineralization efficiency increased by increasing the catalyst dosage and oxygen feed rate
Identified intermediates 4-chloro-3-methylphenol: (2Z)-but-2-enedioic acid, malonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid
In the Zn-CNTs/O3 system, the concentration of small molecular organic acids first increases and afterwards decreases, indicating the oxidation of these intermediates and confirming the enhanced mineralization

Colorimetric method based on the reduction of the redox-active dye resazurin by bacterial respiration
The ozonation of PCP resulted in quantitative release of chlorine and multiple intermediates that are increasingly less toxic and biodegradable with time
To detoxify PCP and early toxic intermediates, a reaction time of 10–20 min is needed, afterward intermediates are amenable to biological degradation

	4-CP (200 mg L−1) 2,4-CP (200 mg L−1) PHENOL (200 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability	In the initial step of ozonation, dechlorination of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP occurred, and then the destruction mechanism of these pollutants was similar to the phenol decomposition (at pH 2 and pH 7, formation of phenol and 4-CP was observed during ozonation of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, respectively)
O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.5 L min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 23 mg L−1; pH = 2–12; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 0.5 L	BOD5 and COD measurements
The presence of unsaturated acids at different pH confirmed the cleavage of aromatic ring, but by different mechanisms
Final products at pH 2 & 7: oxalic and formic acid
Final products at alkaline pH: oxalic acid
The effect of pre-ozonation on the biodegradability of phenol, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP was significant and increased at alkaline pH

110
	CHLOROPHENE (10 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Toxicity	The rate constants between ozone and chlorophene in the pH ranges of 3–11 varied from 1.67 × 103 L mol s−1 at pH 3 to 1.82 × 105 L mol s−1 at pH 11

The effect of the pH was found to be strong at pH-values from 3.5 to 8.5
Chloride ion formation was detected during ozonation, which shows the mineralization of CPs
Quinones and hydrogen peroxide were detected as reaction products
Ozonation products were much less toxic or even nontoxic to Daphnia magna when compared to the toxic properties of the initial pollutants

141
	2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1) NBc (100 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability	Stoichiometric coefficients (mol ozone consumed per mol pollutant removed) of the reaction of ozone with NB and 2,4-DCP were approximately 4 and 2, respectively

Pseudo-first order kinetic constants of single ozonation were 3 times higher for 2,4-DCP than NB (the electron withdrawing character of the nitro group depletes the aromatic ring from the electron density)
Intermediates 2,4-DCP: chlorobenzoquinone and resorcinol
For combined ozonation pre-treatment and biological oxidation process, optimum ozone doses were 0.25 g L−1 and 0.12 g L−1 for NB and 2,4-DCP, respectively
Highest BOD values were obtained when the pollutants were nearly removed from solution
The coupled system (pre-ozonation and aerobic bioreactor) achieved up to 80% of TOC removal

142
	2-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 3-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 4-CP (100–200 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Toxicity	The decomposition of 2-CP, 3-CP and 4-CP and the mineralization rates of TOC followed pseudo-first order kinetics during ozonation

Reactor: storage tank from which liquid recirculated over venturi-type ozone injector; O2 gas flow rate = 400 L h−1; ozone dosage = 5.4 g h−1; pH = not controlled; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 21–25 °C; volume = 21 L	BOD (5, 10 and 21 days), COD and TOC measurements; Aerobic bioassays (CSTR; HRT = 12–24 h; non-acclimated and acclimated-to-phenol sludge)
After the pre-ozonation step, 70% of TOC was removed by an aerobic biological treatment

144
	2-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 3-CP (100–200 mg L−1) 4-CP (100–200 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Toxicity	In general, the ozonation of CPs induced new aqueous toxicity
Reactor: bubble column; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 976 mL min−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 77 mg L−1; pH = 7; reaction time = 10 min; volume = 1000 mL	Microtox assay
(Photobacterium phosphoreum)	Ozonation of 2-CP revealed a higher level of toxicity increase than 3-CP and 4-CP
The increasing toxicity was mainly caused by ozonated intermediates (chlorocatechols, chloromuconic acids and formation of hydroxylated/chlorinated dimeric pollutants)
Ozone requirement of detoxifying into a non-toxic solution follows the order: 4-CP > 3-CP > 2-CP

145
	TRICLOSAN (10 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Toxicity	Complete triclosan removal was achieved by ozonation
Ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 2 mg L−1; pH = 7; room temperature	Cytotoxicity: MTTd (tetrazolium dye) test (Chinese hamster ovary cells); genotoxicity: alkaline comet assay (Chinese hamster ovary cells)

ACPh (420 mg L−1) ANPi (427.5 mg L−1)
Ozonation was found to significantly decrease the toxicity for all of the phenolic pollutants

147
	2-CP (385 mg L−1) 4-NP (417 mg L−1) 4-CRESOL (325 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability	The removal of COD to the effluent standard required long ozonation times and the ozone utilization rate decreased, indicating a costly and unfeasible application
O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.21 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 20 g m−3; ozone dosage = 9 g h−1; pH = 3–10; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 7 L	BOD5 and COD measurements	The biodegradability of pre-ozonated phenolic solutions was strongly dependent on the decomposition of phenolic pollutants and accumulation of intermediate products
Using non-acclimated microorganisms, biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of pretreated 4-cresol, 2-CP and 4-NP solutions increased to 0.18, 0.26 and 0.33, respectively (higher ratios were expected if acclimated biomass was used)

	4-CP (130 mg L−1)	O3/UV and O3/H2O2/UV	Toxicity	Complete 4-CP degradation by O3/UV was achieved throughout the pH ranges (increasing the initial pH value up to 9 enhanced the mineralization)
UV light: low-pressure mercury UV-C lamp (254 nm); ozone dosage = 591 mg h−1; pH = 3–11 (pH was not controlled during experiments); reaction time = 60 min; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 0.5 L	Microbiotest assay
(Daphnia magna)	The addition of H2O2 to the O3/UV process accelerated the decomposition of ozone owing to an increased rate of hydroxyl radical generation
Maximum TOC removal, i.e., 50.1% by the O3/H2O2/UV process, was obtained at H2O2 concentration of 15 mM (further increase resulted in a decrease of the removal efficiency)
The O3/H2O2/UV process achieved an AOX removal efficiency of 96.1% and a toxicity decay of 41.0%
Primary oxidation intermediate products: hydroquinone, benzoquinone, chlorocatechol and phenol

DIURON (saturated solution)	The pesticide solutions became detoxified after photo-Fenton/ozone treatment, except for atrazine and alachlor for which no detoxification was achieved (in the case of alachlor, the toxicity increased with increasing irradiation time)
ISOPROTURON (50 mg L−1)

149
	Phenolic acids	Ozonation and catalytic ozonation	Biodegradability	The use of solid catalysts in the ozone-based systems resulted in a high improvement of both organic charge removal and biodegradability level
SYRINGIC ACIDi (100 mg L−1)	Catalyst: Mn–Ce–O 70/30 and Fe2O3–MnOX N-150 (10 g L−1)	BOD5 and COD measurements; respirometry (control: acetic acid; activated sludge from an industrial winery)

3,4-DHBAm (100 mg L−1)
4-HBAn (100 mg L−1)	All considered oxidation techniques were able to completely detoxify the synthetic wastewater. Catalytic ozonation over Mn–Ce–O 70/30 improved the biodegradability level from 0% to 61%


Degradation by ozonation


112
	4-NP (139–195 mg L−1)	Ozonation	pH determined the relative production rates of hydroquinone and 4-nitrocathechol along the reaction path
Reactor: bubble column; matrix pollutant: t-butanol (0.017–1.667 g L−1); superficial gas velocity = 0.0164 m s−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 2.5–7.0 mg L−1; ozone concentration in the liquid phase = 0–0.5 mg L−1; pH = 2–10; temperature = 20 °C
An optimal concentration of t-butanol was observed at which production of the analyzed intermediates was slowest, indicating that radicals played an important role in 4-NP ozonation at low pH

113
	4-CP (25.6 mg L−1)	Ozonation	The reaction between the oxidant and the organic followed overall second order kinetics, and was more specifically, of first order with respect to both reactants
2,4-DCP (32.6 mg L−1)	Matrix component: t-butanol (740 mg L−1); pH = 2–9; temperature = 20 °C; volume = 500 mL
2,4,6-TCP (39.4 mg L−1)
2,3,4,6-TeCP (46.2 mg L−1)
TETRACHLOROCATECHOL (49.6 mg L−1)	The second-order rate constants increased with the pH as a consequence of the increase in the degree of deprotonation of the dissolved CPs (i.e., from 103 L mol−1 s−1) to 109 L mol−1 s−1 for different CPs)
4-CHLOROGUAIACOL (31.2 mg L−1)
The specific rate constants obtained are significantly higher for the ozonation of the dissociated species

4-BROMOPHENOL2,4,6-TCP	Matrix pollutant: salt (as seawater); chlorination of phenol in seawater; ozone stock solution: 30–50 mgO3 L−1; ozone dosage = 5–10 mg L−1; pH = 7.0; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 22 °C; volume = 500 mL

Degradation by ozone-based processes


151
	2-CP (40 mg L−1)	Ozonation and O3/UV	Almost complete decomposition of 2-CP was accomplished in 20 min by both oxidation techniques
Matrix pollutant: t-butanol (37–740 mg L−1); UV light: low-pressure mercury-vapor UV lamp (254 nm); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 34 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 21 mg L−1; pH = 3–11; reaction time = 2 h; temperature = 25 °C; volume = 2 L
The release of chloride ions was observed early during the decomposition reaction, followed by the mineralization of organic intermediates to form carbonate ions
The presence of t-butanol promoted the decomposition of 2-CP in both processes. In alkaline solutions excessive dosages decreased the reaction rates
The behavior of 2-CP in the presence of t-butanol during both ozonation and O3/UV was described by pseudo-first order kinetics

152
	2,4,6-TCP (39.5-73.0 mg L−1)	Ozonation and O3/H2O2	The rate constant of 2,4,6-TCP degradation by ozone increased by one order of magnitude by increasing the pH from 2 to 7.5, owing to the higher reactivity of the dissociated TCP and the contribution of ozone radical oxidation
Matrix pollutant: humic acid (2.4–56.1 mg L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 1 L min−1; H2O2 concentration = 516 mg L−1; pH = 2–8.2; reaction time = 10 min; temperature = 23 °C; volume = 500 mL
At pH 7.5, 10 min of ozonation achieved 90% TCP degradation, which corresponded to the release of approximately 2 mol Cl− per mol TCP
The presence of H2O2 did not significantly increase the TCP degradation but increased the overall dechlorination to 2.7 mol Cl− per mol TCP
The presence of humic acid enhanced the degradation rate of TCP at low relative humic acid concentrations (<0.6 g humic acid per g TCP), but reduced the rate at higher humic acid concentrations
ATRAZINE (30 mg L−1)


Degradation by ozonation


115
	2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability	All phenolic pollutants disappeared with ozone oxidation, and consequently transformed into various organic acids
Matrix pollutant: salt; O2/O3 gas flow rate = 0.4 m3 h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 15 g m−3; pH = 8; reaction time = 30 min; temperature = 30 °C; volume = 2 L
2,4-D (100 mg L−1)	Bioreactor, with activated sludge (pH 7, 30 °C)	The TOC value decreased by increasing the ozonation time up to half of the initial value
2,4,5-T (100 mg L−1)	The activated sludge treatment after ozonation was effective to degrade the intermediate products (based on TOC removal)

153
	2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability/toxicity	The inversely proportional relationship between the 2,4-DCP degradation and the chlorine release was clearly observed
Matrix pollutant: sodium acetate (320 mg L−1) + glucose (235 mg L−1) & sodium acetate (320 mg L−1) + baby milk powder (159 mg L−1); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 400 L h−1; ozone dosage = 6 g h−1; pH = 9; reaction time = 2, 5 and 10 min; volume = 2 L
Respirometry, using non-acclimated and pre-exposed (not fully acclimated) activated sludge	Complete mineralization was not achieved, implying the production of dehalogenated intermediates
The presence of biodegradable organic matter results in a decreased pseudo-first order degradation rate. The extent of the decrease depends on the nature of the biodegradable organic matter
A long lag phase and low maximal specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) value were observed as the most important toxicity effects
Because of ozonation, the lag phase was significantly reduced and the maximal SOUR value increased after elongating the ozone reaction time. Also, the biodegradable COD fraction increased

154
	2,4-DCP (100 mg L−1)	Ozonation	Biodegradability	An increase of the effluent COD concentration was observed when pre-ozonated wastewater was used as the influent of the bioreactor. The intermediate ozonation products of 2,4-DCP were not completely biodegradable. Furthermore, a higher biomass concentration and enhanced sludge settleability were observed
Matrix pollutant: artificial wastewater containing glucose (C/N/P = 100/14.4/1.9; monovalent over polyvalent cation ratio = 2.02); O2/O3 gas flow rate = 200 L h−1; Ozone dosage = 8 g h−1; pH = 9; reaction time = 30 min; volume = 40 L
Bioreactor, with activated sludge (pH 7.8, 20 °C)	Without ozone pretreatment, 2,4-DCP was completely biodegraded. However, the effluent was not clear because of small particles and a hampered settling of the sludge was observed

Degradation by ozone-based processes


155
	2,5-DCP (500 mg L−1)	Ozonation, O3/UV	Biodegradability	Main intermediates: 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzenediol, 3,6-dichloro-benzene-1,2-diol, catechol, 4-chloro-1,3-benzenediol, phenol, 4-chloro-1,2-benzenediol, 3-CP, pentanoic acid
Reactor: bubble column glass reactor (height = 58 cm; inner diameter = 8.5 cm; fine pore diffusor of 100 μm diameter); matrix pollutant: municipal wastewater (TOC = 115 mg L−1; COD = 250 mg L−1; BOD5 = 198 mg L−1; TSS = 130 mg L−1; TDS = 548 mg L−1; NO3−-N = 10 mg L−1; PO43− = 6 mg L−1; Cl− = 30 mg L−1); UV-light: Pen-Ray UV lamp (4 nW cm−2 at a distance of 2.54 cm); O3/O2 gas flow rate = 36 L h−1; ozone concentration in the gas phase = 37 mg L−1; ozone dosage = 22 mg min−1; pH = 7–8 (neutral)	BOD5 and COD measurements
Toxicity Respirometry (ISO 8192:2007; control: synthetic sewage solution)	Complete degradation of 2,5-DCP by ozone and O3/UV occurred after 60 min and 40 min, respectively
2,5-DCP degradation and dechlorination proceeded simultaneously
The pseudo-first order rate constants obtained for O3/UV were more than 1.5 times faster than the ones for ozonation
The BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.19 to 0.46 (after 40 min) and 0.5 (after 30 min) by ozonation and O3/UV, respectively
Both treatments of 40 min and 60 min created intermediate products which were not sufficiently toxic to calculate the EC50-value (initial EC50 = 57 mg L−1). Therefore, these products were less toxic than the parent compound
The presence of other organic and inorganic matter had a positive effect on the oxidation of 2,5-DCP
