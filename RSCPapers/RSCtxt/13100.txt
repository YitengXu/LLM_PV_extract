    , Accepted 9th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015Abstractp-Type delafossite CuFeO2 has recently been reported as a promising candidate for direct photoelectrochemical solar water reduction in alkaline conditions. However, despite its favorable optical band gap energy and light absorption, this material suffers from poor electron–hole separation that limits its optimum thickness to a few hundred nanometers. This limitation can be addressed by a host–guest strategy, where a mesoporous p-type scaffold is used to support a thin-film of the light absorber. Here we demonstrate this host–guest approach for the first time with CuFeO2 using p-type transparent CuAlO2 as a scaffold. Optimizing the scaffold layer thickness at 2 μm resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in photocurrent in the presence of O2—a sacrificial electron scavenger—reaching 2.4 mA cm−2 at +0.4 V vs. RHE. Moreover, comparing the performance to host–guest electrodes prepared with an insulating SiO2 scaffold as a control suggested that the observed improvement with CuAlO2 was due to a decreased recombination stemming from improved charge separation in addition to improved charge transport through the scaffold compared to the CuFeO2 film alone.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents an attractive way to realize inexpensive and direct conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. More specifically, the so-called D4 device configuration, where an n-type photoanode and a p-type photocathode are connected electrically in series and optically in tandem, has been shown to be a promising device architecture in terms of potential maximum conversion efficiency.1,2 To make such a device cost-efficient the electrodes should be processed using facile and scalable techniques—a requirement typically met by solution-based processes. While such techniques have been well developed for low-cost and efficient n-type photoanodes, such as WO3,3,4 Fe2O3,5–7 or BiVO4,8,9 it has proven more challenging for p-type photocathodes. Indeed, among the solution-processed photocathodes reported so far (and generally for photocathodes for water reduction), at least two issues complicate potential industrial development: the need for ultra-thin and conformal protecting layers to prevent chemical instability under illumination (e.g. p-Cu2O10) or the need for a toxic CdS overlayer (p-Cu2ZnSnS4,11,12 p-Cu(In,Ga)S2 (ref. 13 and 14)) to promote charge separation. Recently, copper-based delafossite oxides CuRhO2 (ref. 15) and CuFeO2 (ref. 16–18) have come forward as a new class of promising photocathode materials, with good stability in aqueous environments. Among these works, our group has reported a scalable, solution-based sol–gel method to produce CuFeO2 photocathodes that showed good light absorption properties (band gap energy, Eg, of 1.45 eV) and suitable band edge energy positions. Bare electrodes achieved photocurrents as high as 1.2 mA cm−2 in the presence of O2 as an electron scavenger, and 0.5 mA cm−2 for hydrogen production when water reduction catalysts overlayers were employed. Importantly, the bare electrode proved to be stable under operating conditions for more than 40 hours, making the presence of a protecting layer unnecessary.
However, optimization of the CuFeO2 layer thickness suggested that the charge harvesting depth (i.e. the space-charge layer at the interface plus the diffusion length of minority carriers) was relatively thin compared to the semiconductor thickness required for good light harvesting (based on the absorption coefficient). This disaccord between minority carrier transport and light absorption has been previously addressed with hematite photoanodes using the host–guest approach, where an extremely thin layer of the hematite light absorber was deposited on a high surface area scaffold with suitable electronic properties, resulting in the ability to decouple light absorption and charge transfer, reduce charge carrier recombination, and attain higher photocurrents.19–22 In order to apply this approach to CuFeO2, a p-type material must be identified to satisfy four basic criteria: (1) high transparency (large Eg), (2) high p-type (hole) conductivity, (3) valence and conduction band energy levels both higher, respectively, than CuFeO2, (to block back electron transfer and facilitate hole transfer from the absorber to the scaffold) and (4) suitable stability in the conditions for the preparation of CuFeO2 and for PEC testing. Unfortunately, only a few p-type scaffold candidates have been reported in the literature to date. NiO is by far the most commonly used, and has been sensitized with molecular dyes or quantum dots in photovoltaic23–25 or photoelectrosynthetic26–28 devices. However, despite its prevalence, NiO presents the drawbacks of significant visible light absorption and low hole mobility. Moreover, nickel oxide is not stable at 700 °C under inert atmosphere, as shown in the Ellingham diagram of the metal. This makes this material incompatible with the conditions necessary for the formation of p-CuFeO2. On the other hand, in recent reports, transparent delafossite materials, such as CuGaO2 (ref. 29–31) and CuAlO2 (ref. 32–34) have been suggested as attractive replacements for NiO. Indeed these materials have favorable light absorption properties and can display high charge carrier mobility, making them suitable candidates as transparent conductive oxides (TCOs).35–37 In addition, the stability of these Cu-based delafossites in aqueous environments make them attractive for applications in solar water splitting. Therefore, in this report we demonstrate that CuAlO2, with a band gap of 3.5 eV, can be used as a low-cost solution-processed mesoporous scaffold in a host–guest configuration with CuFeO2. More precisely, we show that this host material introduces a more favorable morphology, and also promotes charge separation in CuFeO2, resulting in an increase of photocurrent by a factor of 2.4 at +0.4 V vs. the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE).
Experimental
Materials
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Acros, 99+%), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99–104%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Fluka, 98+%), citric acid (Alfa Aesar, 99+%), ethylene glycol and ethanol (Fluka, 99.8%) were used for the sol–gel synthesis of the delafossites. Hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB, Acros, 99+%) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich, 99+%) were used for the SiO2 powder synthesis. Transparent conducting substrates made of FTO deposited on aluminoborosilicate glass were purchased from Solaronix SA, and successively washed with Hellmanex III (alkaline cleaning agent, HelmaAnalytics), acetone and ethanol. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (Alfa Aesar, M.W. 100000) and acetylacetone (Acros, 99+%) were used in the preparation of the CuAlO2 paste.
CuAlO2 scaffold preparation
Al(NO3)3·9H2O (1.500 g, 4.00 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.964 g, 4.00 mmol) and citric acid (1.537 g, 8.00 mmol) were mixed in 20 mL of ethanol. After stirring for 2 hours, ethylene glycol (0.5 mL, 8.96 mmol) was added to the mixture, which was further stirred for 1 hour. The resulting solution was dried at 150 °C overnight. The resulting powder was grinded, and then annealed in air at 450 °C in a Nabertherm LV5/11/B180 oven (ramp rate: 10 °C min−1) for 5 h to remove all traces of organic material. The resulting powder was then annealed under argon flow (300 mL min−1) at 1000 °C in an OTF-1200X oven (MTI corporation, ramp rate: 10 °C min−1) for 12 h. 200 mg of the resulting material was mixed with a 10% acetylacetone (acac) solution in isopropanol, and thoroughly grinded to break the aggregates. Then, 1 mL of a 1% acac solution in isopropanol was added to the mixture and the resulting suspension was sonicated for 5 minutes. Finally, 1 mL of a 4% hydroxypropyl cellulose solution in isopropanol was added to the suspension, and the resulting paste was tape-casted onto FTO. The resulting films were heated at 700 °C (ramp rate: 10 °C min−1) in argon for 1 hour.
SiO2 scaffold preparation
SiO2 powder was prepared according to the following procedure. CTAB (4.37 g, 12 mmol) was dissolved in 500 mL of deionized water. 15 mL of a 2 M NaOH solution was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 80 °C. TEOS (21.5 mL, 10 mmol) was added dropwise and the solution was stirred for three more hours. The resulting precipitate was filtered and dried in air. The powder was finally sintered at 500 °C for 8 h to remove the surfactant. The obtained SiO2 powder was casted on FTO using the same procedure than for the preparation of the CuAlO2 scaffold.
CuFeO2 deposition
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.808 g, 2.00 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.482 g, 2.00 mmol) and citric acid (0.768 g, 4.00 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of ethanol. After stirring for 2 hours, ethylene glycol (0.25 mL, 4.48 mmol) was added to the mixture, which was further stirred overnight. The resulting solution was spin-coated, with a WS-650MZ-23NPP (Laurell) spin-coater either onto clean FTO substrates, or onto CuAlO2 scaffolds, at 3000 rpm for 1 minute. When deposited on CuAlO2, the scaffold was conditioned for 30 min under plasma in a Plasma Cleaner PDC-32G (Harrick Plasma). The films were then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 minutes before annealing in air at 450 °C in a Nabertherm LV5/11/B180 oven (ramp rate: 10 °C min−1) for 1 h. Successive layers were then deposited on top of the first one following the same succession of steps. Finally, the material was annealed under argon flow (300 mL min−1) at 700 °C in an OTF-1200X oven (MTI corporation, ramp rate: 10 °C min−1) for 12 h.
Characterization methods
UV-visible spectrometry was performed with a UV-3600 (Shimadzu) spectrometer, equipped with an integrating sphere. To determine the absorption of the different materials the following formula were used: Abs (%) = 100 − T (%) − Rtot (%) − Abssubstrate (%)(1) Abssubstrate (%) = 100 − Tsubstrate (%) − Rtot,substrate (%)(2)
For each electrode, the total (diffuse + direct) transmission Ttot and the total reflectance (Rtot) were measured, using an integrating sphere. The absorption was then determined, using eqn (1) with the absorption of substrate being measured using eqn (2) on a blank substrate. Finally the amount of light absorbed was calculated by integrating the product of the absorption spectrum by the AM 1.5 photon density between 300 and 900 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured with a D8 Discovery (Bruker) diffractometer. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an ESCA KRATOS AXIS ULTRA spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures were taken with a Zeiss Merlin electron microscope. Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed using a three-electrode setup, with a platinum counter-electrode and a Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat.) reference electrode (E = +0.210 V vs. NHE). The surface area of the film in contact with the electrolyte was 0.25 cm2. The electrochemical behavior was monitored with a SP-200 potentiostat (BioLogic), while the light was provided by a Muller Electronik xenon-arc lamp (450 W), calibrated with the AM 1.5G spectra to provide 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) of illumination to the sample (See ESI† for calibration procedure). A mechanical shutter was used to chop the illumination and back (substrate side) or front (electrolyte side) illumination was employed. Monochomatic illumination for IPCE measurement was provided by a 75 W Xe Tunable PowerArc Illuminator (Optical Building Blocks) and the number of photons at each wavelength was measured with a photodiode power sensor (S120VC, Thorlabs). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed in the dark at a frequency range of 100 mHz–1 MHz.
Results and discussion
To demonstrate the host–guest approach with CuFeO2, the previously-reported sol–gel synthesis of CuFeO2 thin films on F:SnO2 (FTO) was employed.16 In this method, the precursor solution is used to sequentially deposit layers of copper iron oxide on FTO that are finally crystallized into the delafossite phase at high temperature under inert atmosphere. Fortuitously, the minimum crystallization temperature for CuFeO2 (700 °C) is sufficiently low to retain conductivity in the FTO. While CuAlO2 is a promising host material for CuFeO2, it requires temperatures higher than 1000 °C to form the delafossite phase. This prevents the direct formation of the material by a sol–gel method on the FTO substrate, thus our approach had to be adapted accordingly, i.e. using preformed CuAlO2 nanoparticles. A fine powder of CuAlO2 was prepared using an adapted sol–gel approach as described in the experimental section and X-ray diffraction confirmed that the final powder was the desired pure crystalline delafossite phase (see Fig. 1a). In order to create high-surface area, porous thin films of the scaffold material on FTO, a viscous dispersion was prepared by grinding the powder with acetylacetone and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). Acetylacetone was used as a surface ligand to increase dispersion stability and to enhance shear forces when grinding (wet grinding), which aids aggregate separation,38 while HPC was used as the organic porogen and a rheology additive. This final dispersion had the consistency of a paste and was tape-cast onto FTO substrates. The resulting film was annealed at 450 °C to remove the HPC and afford a mesoporous CuAlO2 film.

Films on FTO were measured under pseudo grazing incidence, whereas the CuAlO2 powder was measured under locked-coupled conditions, causing a difference in peak broadness. All measurements were performed with a scan rate of 0.1° min−1 and a step size of 0.01°. Corresponding peak signals from the IPCC database are shown at the bottom of the figure.

A scanning electron micrograph of a typical CuAlO2 scaffold deposited on FTO is shown in Fig. 1b. It shows a very rough morphology with a wide range of grain size: from 100 to 1000 nm. On the other hand, we observed a good coverage of the FTO substrate by the scaffold. The thickness of the film was estimated using a profilometer, and could be varied between 500 and 2500 nm by controlling the concentration of the paste. To afford the final host/guest electrode the CuFeO2 material could then be deposited onto the CuAlO2 scaffold. Optimization of the quantities for the two materials will be discussed later. For the case of a CuAlO2 scaffold of ca. 2 μm thick covered by 6 successive spin coating depositions of CuFeO2, the resulting morphology is shown in Fig. 1c. It appears that the CuFeO2 completely covers the scaffold while retaining a mesoporous morphology (see Fig. 1c inset). Additional micrographs, including a cross-sectional view of the final electrode, are presented in Fig. S3a,† and confirmed the existence of a high-surface area interface between the CuFeO2 and the CuAlO2. Finally, the composition of the host–guest electrode was investigated by XRD, and the resulting pattern, shown in Fig. 1a, confirmed the presence of the desired crystalline phases only. The spectrum of a control electrode made of a thin film of CuFeO2 on FTO is added for comparison. XPS was also performed on the electrodes, and confirmed the presence of the desired elements only inside the films (see Fig. S1†).
Having established the ability to fabricate the desired host/guest electrode it is next important to verify that the CuAlO2 satisfies the basic criteria for performance as an effective host. First, UV-vis spectroscopy (see Fig. S2†) shows that the CuAlO2 has a direct optical band gap of 3.51 eV and is thus transparent in the range from 1.45 to 3.1 eV where both the CuFeO2 absorbs and there is an appreciable amount of solar photons. To verify that the electronic energy levels are suitable to accept majority carriers from the CuFeO2 and block minority carriers, we next relied on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the position of the flat-band potential of CuAlO2 and CuFeO2. Nyquist plots of each material were acquired between 100 mHz and 100 kHz at different voltages—between +1.2 and +0.5 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)—and each the Nyquist plot was then fit with a Randles circuit shown in Fig. 2a. This circuit is commonly used when the charge transfer across the Helmholtz layer in the electrolyte is negligible in front of the charge transfer across the depletion layer in the electrode,39 and proved to be a good fit for our electrodes. From the fit, a value of the space charge capacitance, C, was calculated at each voltage, and used in the resulting Mott–Schottky plots displayed in Fig. 2a. We obtained flat-band potentials of +0.93 V vs. RHE and +1.01 V vs. RHE for CuAlO2 and CuFeO2, respectively. As expected, these potentials were relatively similar for the two materials, as their valence bands are both based on hybridized O(2p) and Cu(3d) orbitals, but not equal, as Al and Fe have different neighboring effects on the copper orbitals. In fact, CuAlO2 was found to have a flat-band potential higher in energy than CuFeO2. Since the valence band energy in both delafossites are likely offset a similar amount from the Fermi level (given the absence of extrinsic dopants) this implies that the spontaneous transfer of holes from CuFeO2 to CuAlO2 is possible.

(b) Simplified energy diagram of the host–guest CuAlO2/CuFeO2 electrode. Colorized areas represent energy bands, arrows indicate spontaneous charge transfer under illumination, and dashed lines mark the position of the water redox couples. 
A simplified sketch of the position of the energy levels is displayed in Fig. 2b, as well as the corresponding spontaneous charge transfer that is expected to occur upon light absorption by the CuFeO2 layer (recombination pathways are not represented). Valence bands of the two materials were positioned roughly 0.2 eV below their flat-band potential,17 and the position of the corresponding conduction bands were estimated using the optical band gap of each material, extracted from its UV-vis absorption spectrum: 1.45 eV for CuFeO2 and 3.51 eV for CuAlO2 (see Fig. S2†). The resulting sketch illustrates the role of CuAlO2 as a viable hole-acceptor in our host–guest electrode.
Given the favorable optoelectronic properties of the CuAlO2/CuFeO2 combination. The electrodes were subsequently submitted to photoelectrochemical evaluation. Electrodes were inserted in a PEC cell and illuminated by a Xe arc lamp producing simulated sunlight, calibrated to an intensity of 1 sun (details are provided in the ESI†). It was previously demonstrated that direct solar water reduction is possible on CuFeO2, when suitable overlayer and catalyst are used.16 However, in an effort to keep the system as simple as possible, and since the aim of this work was to examine the influence of the scaffold on the light harvesting and charge separation properties of the electrode, we evaluated the photoelectrochemical behavior in the presence of O2, a sacrificial electron scavenger that photogenerated electrons in CuFeO2 can efficiently reduce under illumination without further surface treatment. A comparison of the current density–voltage (J–V) curves obtained under intermittent illumination with our best performing host–guest composite electrode (2 μm scaffold/6 layers of CuFeO2) and an optimized control CuFeO2 electrode (ca. 300 nm layer without scaffold) is shown in Fig. 3a.
 Fig. 3  a) Comparison of J–V curves obtained for optimized CuAlO2/CuFeO2 (blue trace) and CuFeO2 (red trace) electrodes, under O2 bubbling. Electrolyte: 1 M NaOH, scan rate: 10 mV s−1, illumination: 1 sun. (b) IPCE spectra of CuAlO2 (green solid line), CuFeO2 (red solid line), and CuFeO2/CuAlO2 (blue solid line) electrodes. Corresponding integrated photocurrents are represented by the dotted lines. 
Clearly, introducing the scaffold afforded an increase in photocurrent over the entire potential range scanned, while maintaining a good photocurrent onset potential of +0.75 V vs. RHE of the bare material. Indeed, for the particular electrodes shown in Fig. 3, the photocurrent at +0.35 V vs. RHE was improved from 1 mA cm−2 for the control electrode to 2.4 mA cm−2 for the composite one. More generally, averaged over a series of 5 electrodes prepared at each condition, the photocurrent delivered at +0.4 V vs. RHE was 1.95 ± 0.25 mA cm−2 for the host–guest electrode while the optimized control electrode delivered 0.98 ± 0.07 mA cm−2 at the same potential. Notably the different uncertainty in the values of the composite electrode's average photocurrent compared to the control is evidence of increased variation in morphology between replicate electrodes. Nevertheless a clear enhancement in photocurrent was observed across the series. In addition we note that a bare CuAlO2 electrode (without CuFeO2) produced a very small photocurrent of only 0.13 mA cm−2 at +0.4 V vs. RHE (see Fig. S4†). This suggest that the photocurrent enhancement was due to an improved performance of the CuFeO2 when the scaffold is employed.
To understand the origin of the photocurrent enhancement and to better quantify the benefit of the scaffold we next measured the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for control electrodes consisting of only CuAlO2 or CuFeO2 and a host–guest CuAlO2/CuFeO2 electrode to determine how much of the incident light spectrum was productive in generating the observed photocurrents. The resulting spectra, shown in Fig. 3b, reveal that CuAlO2 itself only produces photocurrent at wavelengths lower than 400 nm with a small IPCE (green trace), consistent with small photocurrent observed. Importantly, an increase in IPCE was observed with the composite electrode (blue trace) over the entire wavelength range compared to the control CuFeO2 electrode (red trace). Integrating these spectra with the standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum yielded predicted photocurrent densities of 1.2 and 2.6 mA cm−2 for the control and the host–guest electrodes respectively. These values are consistent with the photocurrent densities observed in the J–V curves (Fig. 3a), given the small mismatch between our simulated sunlight and the AM 1.5G spectrum.16
Further insight into the limitations and maximum extent of the photocurrent enhancement using the scaffold approach can be gained by independently varying the thickness of the host and guest layers. Given the consistent shape of the J–V curve, the photocurrent densities, JPh (equal to the photocurrent produced under illumination minus the dark current) at +0.4 V vs. RHE can be used as a performance metric. Moreover, since the CuAlO2 scaffold had the advantage of being transparent in the visible range, we also were able to compare the behavior of the electrodes under front (electrolyte-side) and back (substrate-side) illumination. We prepared a series of electrodes where the thickness of the scaffold was varied between 0.5 and 2.5 μm, and the number of CuFeO2 deposition steps by spin coating were varied between 2 and 10 (each spin coating layer gives ca. 50 nm of CuFeO2 on a bare FTO substrate). The results of this series of experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. The photocurrent initially increased with the thickness of the scaffold for all CuFeO2 thicknesses until a maximum at a scaffold thickness of 2 μm. Further increase in CuAlO2 thickness caused the photocurrent to decrease. This trend was identical under front and back illumination, and was rationalized as follows: initially increasing the thickness of the CuAlO2 film is beneficial as it increases the roughness of the electrode, but eventually at a certain thickness, the conductivity of the scaffold limits the current density, causing the photocurrent to decrease with increasing scaffold thickness. We also observed that photocurrents were consistently higher when the electrode was under front illumination, suggesting that minority carrier transport was limiting in all cases.
 Fig. 4  Photocurrent densities obtained for composite electrodes with several CuAlO2 and CuFeO2 contents, under front (on the left) and back (on the right) illumination and under an applied bias of +0.4 V vs. RHE. Electrolyte: 1 M NaOH purged with O2, illumination: 1 sun. 
The optimal CuFeO2 loading was reached after 6 successive depositions regardless of the CuAlO2 thickness. This is surprising as the quantity of CuFeO2 deposited for each deposition step was expected to depend on the thickness of the CuAlO2 scaffold. Assuming a constant void fraction, a higher amount of precursor material should be retained in thicker scaffolds after spin coating, resulting in a higher amount of CuFeO2 for thicker CuAlO2 scaffolds. To estimate and compare the relative amounts of CuFeO2 between different samples we employed light absorbance measurements at 750 nm, since CuAlO2 does not absorb at this wavelength. In order to estimate only the amount of light absorbed by the layer of CuFeO2, we removed the light reflected by the scaffold from the incident beam in our calculations. The resulting measurements are shown in Fig. S5a,† along with the experimental details. The amount of CuFeO2 after 6 successive spin coating depositions was observed to increase linearly with the thickness of the CuAlO2 scaffold as expected (see Fig. S5b†). Based on these measurements the best performing host–guest electrode—prepared by 6 successive depositions on a 2 μm CuAlO2 scaffold—contained about 2.2 times more CuFeO2 than the best performing bare CuFeO2 electrode (prepared by 6 successive depositions directly on FTO). Clearly, the fact that the optimized composite electrode contains more than twice the amount of CuFeO2 compared to the optimized control CuFeO2 electrode suggests that the host–guest architecture is successful at increasing the amount of absorbing material without increasing the rate of recombination inside the film. This is consistent with the observed morphology, where the CuFeO2 layer remains thin enough for efficient charge separation, but enables a higher absorber loading due to the roughness of the mesoporous scaffold. Indeed, the host/guest morphology increases the number of photons that are absorbed within the charge-separating layer at the CuFeO2/electrolyte interface compared to the control case. It is therefore plausible that the enhancement of photocurrent in the composite electrode is merely due to this morphological effect. However, it remains a possibility that the photocurrent is enhanced due to a decreased recombination in the CuFeO2 due to hole injection into the CuAlO2.
To examine this second possibility we next investigated the electrode light absorption in detail to determine if the difference in total light absorption between the control CuFeO2 and the composite CuAlO2/CuFeO2 electrode was commensurate with the difference in the photocurrents they produced. In this case, instead of performing the absorption measurement only at 750 nm (as was previously done to estimate the amount of CuFeO2 in the electrode), here we examined the entire wavelength range and also considered the reflective scattering induced by the CuAlO2 substrate. For each electrode, the total transmission, as well as the total and diffuse reflectance were recorded with an integrating sphere. Using this data (Fig. S6†), the amount of light absorbed in each case was evaluated (see details in the experimental section) and graphed in Fig. 5 (solid lines). Integrating the absorption spectra with the photon flux density under AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2) indicated that the composite electrode absorbed 56% more photons than the control electrode over the entire wavelength range. While this increase in absorption brought by the host–guest configuration was significant, it does not account for the entire photocurrent enhancement observed in the J–V curve (a factor of 2.4 increase). Indeed, the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE), also shown in Fig. 5 (dotted lines), shows a uniform increase in internal quantum efficiency of CuFeO2 in the composite electrode over the entire wavelength range. We note that in the case that morphology alone was responsible for the increase, one would expect to see a comparatively higher quantum efficiency near the absorption edge of the absorbing layer for the composite electrode21 due to the increased absorption depth of photons near the band edge. However in the normalized quantum efficiency (presented in Fig. S7†) the traces have an identical shape. This suggests that a combination of an increased in light absorption – resulting in a higher number of photogenerated carriers, and a reduction in recombination due to hole injection from the CuFeO2 into the CuAlO2 were responsible for the improved photocurrents produced by the composite electrode.

However, it is important to point out that, due to the highly porous morphology of the host–guest electrode, a non-negligible portion of CuFeO2 is expected to be in direct contact with the FTO substrate. Additionally as pointed out previously, the higher photocurrents obtained under front illumination for all the electrodes shown in Fig. 4 suggest that minority carrier transport is limiting. Therefore we cannot directly exclude the possibility that majority carrier transport occurs completely inside the CuFeO2. This prompted us to investigate the path taken by the photogenerated holes to reach the substrate. An obvious way to confirm that charges pass through CuAlO2 would be to make a CuAlO2/CuFeO2 bilayer device where direct contact between the CuFeO2 and FTO is eliminated. However, due to the high temperature treatment needed for CuAlO2 processing, we did not have the possibility to deposit a compact thin layer of this material directly on the substrate. Instead we replaced the p-type mesoporous CuAlO2 scaffold by an insulating SiO2 scaffold prepared in a similar fashion and exhibiting a comparable morphology (see SEM images in Fig. S3b† and electrode sketches in Fig. 6). We then submitted this new electrode to PEC testing in 1 M NaOH in the presence of O2. The resulting J–V data are shown in Fig. 6a in comparison to the CuFeO2/CuAlO2 host–guest electrode. While a small photocurrent is observed in the SiO2/CuFeO2 electrode (see inset of Fig. 6a), corresponding to the direct hole transfer from CuFeO2 to the FTO, it is evident that replacing the p-CuAlO2 scaffold by an insulating SiO2 scaffold decreased the performance of the electrode dramatically. This result therefore confirms that photogenerated holes move through the p-CuAlO2 scaffold in the host–guest electrode (as shown in Fig. 6b40), and also that a good band alignment between the host and guest materials is necessary to promote hole transfer towards the substrate. Otherwise, given the relatively poor conductivity of the CuFeO2, photogenerated holes will recombine before travelling through the CuFeO2 to the substrate. Importantly these results suggest that the nanowire array approach, commonly pursued for PEC electrodes41 is not suitable for CuFeO2 unless routes to dope the material and increase its majority carrier conductivity, without reducing the photoactivity, can be developed.

Electrolyte: 1 M NaOH, scan rate: 10 mV s−1, illumination: 1 sun. The inset provides a detail on the J–V curve of the SiO2/CuFeO2 electrode for the potential range 0.35–0.45 V vs. RHE (b) scheme of the possible pathways that photogenerated charges can take inside a CuAlO2/CuFeO2 electrode. The brown layer represents CuFeO2. Holes can travel either inside the CuFeO2 layer or through the CuAlO2 scaffold. (c) Scheme of the possible pathways that photogenerated charges can take inside a SiO2/CuFeO2 electrode. Holes are blocked at the surface of the insulating SiO2 that acts as a recombination center. The only possible pathway for holes to reach the substrate is to travel exclusively inside the CuFeO2 layer. 
In general, the findings presented in this work demonstrate that it is possible to significantly improve the performance of p-type CuFeO2 photocathodes. Introducing a mesoporous p-type underlayer was successful, and should be combined with other approaches, such as optimization of overlayer and catalyst deposition on the surface of the material. By combining morphological and electronic approaches, a CuFeO2 photoelectrode with sufficient performance for use in an all-oxide tandem cell for solar hydrogen production should be feasible.
Conclusions
In this work we presented a host–guest composite electrode, where the CuFeO2 layer was supported by a p-type CuAlO2 scaffold. CuAlO2 displayed favorable optoelectronic properties in this configuration: it was transparent in the visible range (Eg = 3.5 eV) and its flat band potential was around 0.1 eV higher in energy than the one of CuFeO2 suggesting selective extraction photogenerated holes towards the substrate at the CuFeO2/CuAlO2 interface was possible. Our solution-based deposition allowed for optimization of the composition of the host–guest electrode under front (electrolyte-side) and back (substrate side) illumination, during photoelectrochemical testing. Optimized CuAlO2/CuFeO2 electrodes consistently produced higher photocurrents than their optimized CuFeO2 electrode counterparts, with photocurrents measured to be up to 2.4-fold higher for the composite electrode. This improvement in performance was found to be not only due to better charge separation but also to an improved morphology – a thin layer of CuFeO2 on top of a highly porous CuAlO2 scaffold – where a higher amount of CuFeO2 could be incorporated to the electrode before reaching minority carrier transport limitations. Furthermore, using a control electrode in which CuAlO2 was replaced by insulating SiO2, we concluded that most of the photogenerated holes effectively traveled through the scaffold, since only very little photocurrent was observed with the insulating scaffold. This study therefore demonstrated that CuAlO2 and CuFeO2 formed an efficient host–guest system, displaying higher photocurrents, stemming from better charge separation and charge transport properties than for the bare CuFeO2 material. Based on its optoelectronic properties and the chemical stability, we also expect that CuAlO2, as a p-type transparent conductive oxide, should be a suitable hole-extracting scaffold for a variety of p-type photocathode materials.
