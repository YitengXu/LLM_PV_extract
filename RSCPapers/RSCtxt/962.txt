    , Accepted 7th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractFor the application of metal-free organic sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a boron dibenzopyrromethene (dibenzo-BODIPY)-conjugated phenothiazine dye with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group 1 was synthesized and characterized. It showed an intense absorption band at 638 nm as the λmax value and a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.23 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In addition, a relatively small but significant peak was observed at 440 nm (ε = 1.80 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Such panchromatic features allowed the fabrication of a DSSC with an excellent short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.09 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated light. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) indicated that the cell converted the light to a photocurrent in a wide wavelength region up to 780 nm, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE; η) of 7.69% in an I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte without the addition of any coadsorbents. When compared to the control cell loaded with a cycanoacrylic acid-appended phenothiazine 2, the PCE value of the 1-loaded cell was 1.5 times larger than that of the control cell because of significant enhancements in both Jsc and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) suggested attenuation of the charge recombination when using 1 as a sensitizer. In this way, the 1-loaded cell showed relatively good DSSC properties comparable to those of the cell with N719 (η = 7.15%) under the same conditions.
Introduction
With steep demand for efficient use of renewable energy, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising photovoltaic technology because of their cost effectiveness, facile fabrication process, and high functionality as ubiquitous devices.1–6 In DSSC systems, photosensitizers adsorbed onto the TiO2 layer of the conducting electrodes play a significant role in the photovoltaic performance. Since the seminal report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,7 a number of effective dyes such as ruthenium polypyridyl complexes,8 porphyrins,9–11 quantum dots,12 and metal-free D–π–A organic compounds13–17 have been proposed as sensitizers applicable to DSSCs. Among them, metal-free organic sensitizers have attracted much attention because they avoid the use of rare or toxic metals and they are cost effective. Although a few examples of DSSCs loaded with metal-free organic sensitizers have recently exceeded 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) values,9,18–22 flexibility in synthesis in terms of structure design deserves further investigation to propose plausible dyes for DSSCs.
Phenothiazine, which is structurally analogous to triphenylamine,23 has been extensively studied as an electron donor unit for D–π–A sensitizers.24–33 Although it has a simple structure, its synthetic diversity and non-planar butterfly structure make it useful as a sensitizer in DSSCs; such structural features can suppress dye aggregation or excimer formation. To date, a number of phenothiazine-based D–π–A systems have been proposed by introducing accepting groups for this purpose.34,35 However, their photo-susceptibility in the far-red and near-infrared spectra is limited. Thus, considering the radiant energy distribution of sunlight, improving the light-harvesting capability of phenothiazine sensitizers is a promising approach to obtaining a better performance in DSSCs.36 With this in mind, we have focused on 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) dyes,37–40 which show outstanding photophysical properties such as a high molar extinction coefficient (ε) of absorbance, high fluorescence quantum yield, and excellent photostability. Because of their excellent performance as functional dyes they have been applied in chemosensors,41 bioprobes,42,43 photodynamic therapy,44–47 organic light-emitting diodes,48 and solar devices.49 Although a number of DSSCs with BODIPY sensitizers have been fabricated so far, the PCE values of those devices are relatively low.50–65 Furthermore, efforts have been made to introduce BODIPY66–68 or its congener36 into phenothiazine cores to improve their light-harvesting capability. Despite that, the resultant DSSCs continue to have only moderate PCE values of up to 6.58%. Alternatively, our approach based on the use of π-extended dibenzo-BODIPY provided good light-harvesting that improved the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc).54 It thus seemed that a sophisticated combination of dibenzo-BODIPY and phenothiazine would be a plausible candidate for a better performance as a sensitizer in DSSCs.
In this study, a binary electron donor system composed of dibenzo-BODIPY and phenothiazine 1 was designed and synthesized for the first time (Fig. 1). As described below in detail, 1 absorbs a wide range of wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) because of the appearance of absorption bands of phenothiazine and dibenzo-BODIPY cores. Interestingly, a corresponding photoanode made by adsorbing 1 onto the TiO2 layer served as a panchromatic sensitizer in DSSCs with near-infrared activity. Such photochemical properties were estimated using electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations. We measured its photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and compared the results with those of 2-cyano-3-(N-hexylphenothiazin-7-yl)acylic acid 224 (Fig. 1). Improved Jsc and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values were observed by connecting dibenzo-BODIPY to a phenothiazine core and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.69% was achieved without any coadsorbent in an I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte.

Experimental section
General
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer (1H: 500 MHz, 13C: 125 MHz). In 1H and 13C NMR measurements, chemical shifts (δ) are reported downfield from the internal standard Me4Si. Mass spectrometry data were obtained using a JEOL JMS-700 fast atom bombardment (FAB) spectrometer where m-nitrobenzylalcohol was used as a matrix or using a Bruker micrOTOF II-SDT1 spectrometer with the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) method. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using Shimadzu UV-3600 UV/vis/NIR and JASCO FP6500 spectrophotometers, respectively. Elemental analyses were performed on an Exeter Analytical, Inc. CE-440F Elemental Analyzer.

Reagents used for the synthesis were commercially available and used as supplied. Dry THF was prepared according to a standard procedure. Bis(tetrabutylammonium)-cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(4-carboxylato-4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium (N719) was purchased from Aldrich. 2-Cyano-3-(N-hexylphenothiazin-7-yl)-acylic acid 2,24 3-bromo-10-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine-7-carbaldehyde 325 and difluoro[5-bromo-1-[[3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2H-isoindol-1-yl]-methylene]-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1H-isoindolato-N1,N2]boron 669 were prepared according to the reported method. In the structure of 6, the anisole ring is located on the same (syn-form) and the opposite (anti-form) face of the dibenzo-BODIPY core.69 The purification of 2 was confirmed by elemental analyses; calcd for C22H22N2O2S: C, 69.81; H, 5.86; N, 7.40, found: C, 69.67; H, 5.93; N, 7.38.

The fluorescence quantum yield (ϕexp) was calculated from the equation below.70  where F(λ) and Fr(λ) describe the measured fluorescence intensities of the dye and the reference, respectively, and A and Ar describe the corresponding absorbances at the excitation wavelength. Crystal violet (ϕr = 0.54 in MeOH)71 was used as the reference.

Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were measured on a Princeton Applied Research CV-VersaSTAT 3–200 potentiostat operated at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and room temperature under a N2 atmosphere. A THF–CH3CN (3:2 v/v) solution was employed, which contains 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The potentials were measured against Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M of AgNO3) as a reference where ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard and measured to be 0.078 V under the same conditions. The onset potentials were determined from the intersection of two tangents drawn at the rising and background currents of the cyclic voltammogram.
Theoretical calculations
Geometry of 1 at the ground state was fully optimized by means of the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level method. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed in the Gaussian 09 package.72 These molecular orbitals were visualized using the Gauss view 5.0.8 program.
Fabrication of DSSC devices
DSSC working electrodes were prepared by cleaning FTO glasses in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 20 min, and then rinsed with distilled water and ethanol. A layer of 20 nm-sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles for obtaining a transparent nanocrystalline layer was first coated on the FTO glass plates using the doctor blade technique. After drying, 400 nm-sized TiO2 anatase nanoparticles were then deposited as the scattering layer. Working TiO2 electrodes were a 7 μm thick transparent TiO2 nanoparticle layer and a 5 μm TiO2 scattering layer. The TiO2 electrodes were sintered at 450 °C. After cooling, the TiO2 working electrodes were immersed into the dye solutions (0.5 mM in acetonitrile/tert-butanol mixture) (1:1 ratio) overnight. Counter electrodes were prepared by coating Pt on FTO using the doctor blade method. After heating at 15 min, transparent platinum layers were obtained as counter electrodes. The dye absorbed TiO2 electrodes and counter electrodes were assembled in a sandwich geometry using a thermoplastic sealant. A drop of the electrolyte (0.6 M of N-methyl-N-butylimidazolium iodide (BMII) + 0.1 M of LiI + 0.05 M of I2 + 0.5 M of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile) was injected into the cell through a pre-drilled hole. And then, the hole sealant was sealed using bynel and a small piece of glass. A mask was used for the active area before testing for DSSCs. The active area was 0.16 cm2. Dye sensitized solar cells were characterized by J–V measurements under AM 1.5 conditions. A 450 W xenon light source (Oriel) was used to give an irradiance of various intensities. J–V data collection was made by using Keithley 2400 Source-Meter and LabView data acquisition software. Devices with the commercial dye N719 were fabricated under the same conditions, which were used as a reference. EQE measurements were obtained using Enlitech equipment. A Zahner IM6 electrochemical impedance spectrophometer (EIS) was used.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic path to 1 is shown in Scheme 1. First, 8-bromo-10-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde 3 was allowed to react with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol to give 4 which was followed by pinacolborylation with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane to give acetal-protected borylphenothiazine 5 as a key intermediate. The coupling reaction of mono-brominated dibenzo-BODIPY 669 with 5 using Pd(PPh3)4 afforded 7 in 54% yield. Subsequently, deprotection with p-TsOH and Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine gave target 1 in 47% yield.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route towards 1. 
Full assignment of 1 was carried out using several spectroscopic methods. The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum in DMSO-d6 was somewhat complicated at 25 °C (see ESI†), where four sets of signals assignable to methoxy protons in the anisole ring were observed at 3.67 (A), 3.69 (B), 3.72 (C), and 3.74 (D) ppm. We recorded the variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of a DMSO-d6 solution of 1 (Fig. 2a). Subsequently, the coalescence point was found to be 104 °C, with an activation energy of 80 kJ mol−1 being estimated. As inferred from our previous results,69 one set of higher-field-shifted signals (A and B) and another set of signals (C and D) would be assignable to either the anti- or syn-forms because of their unsymmetrical structures. These results suggest that the rotation of the anisole ring is restricted by the isoindole ring.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of 1 and control sensitizer 2 are shown in Fig. 3a. The dye 1 shows an intense absorption band at 638 nm, with an ε value of more than 105 as a result of π-extended dibenzo-BODIPY. Also, a relatively small but significant peak was obtained at 440 nm (ε = 1.80 × 104 M−1 cm−1), possibly due to phenothiazine-based absorption. Also, 1 has a fluorescence band with a λem value of 668 nm (ϕexp = 30%) when excited at 570 nm, a small Stokes shift of 30 nm being observed. It is mainly ascribable to the nature of the dibenzo-BODIPY core. To gain a better understanding of the absorption properties, 1 was subjected to time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) analysis at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The structural optimization indicated that the dihedral angle between dibenzo-BODIPY and the phenothiazine cores was 37.3°. Table 1 summarizes the absorption and theoretical data of 1, where the transition energies (λcalcd) and oscillator strength (f) are listed. The electron-density distributions are illustrated for the following molecular orbitals: highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)−1, HOMO, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and LUMO+1 (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that the first absorption band is mainly characterized as a mixture of two configurations, HOMO → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1. Although both the HOMO and LUMO are mainly located on the dibenzo-BODIPY core, the HOMO slightly spreads over the phenothiazine moiety. Alternatively, the transition based on HOMO → LUMO+1 represents a typical intramolecular charge-transfer character from the dibenzo-BODIPY donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, which plays a significant role in sensitizer performance. Our attention was focused on a shorter wavelength absorption band with a λmax (calcd) value of 482 nm. Although the oscillator strength was one-third as large as that of the first absorption band, the band was composed of a transition from HOMO−1 to LUMO+1, being ascribable to the intramolecular charge-transfer character of the phenothiazine–cyanoacrylic acid π-conjugation.

The electrochemical properties of the sensitizers were measured at room temperature using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a THF/CH3CN (3:2 v/v) solution containing 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. The formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.078 V versus Ag/Ag+. As shown in Fig. 5, it is interesting to note that two kinds of half-wave potentials were detected at 0.558 V and 0.572 V as Eox1/2, attributable to dibenzo-BODIPY units and the phenothiazine, respectively, in the dye. This result allows us to consider that dye 1 could have D–D′–π–A character.73 The HOMO energy level was estimated by the onset oxidation potential (0.408 V) to be −5.13 eV, which was more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox potential (−4.6 eV) for dye generation. Alternatively, an onset reduction potential of −1.22 V led to a LUMO level of −3.50 eV, which was negative relative to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode. In this way, such an energetically favorable process enables application of the dye as a sensitizer in DSSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
For the preparation of DSSC devices, the dye-loaded TiO2 electrodes were prepared by immersing the TiO2 electrode into an acetonitrile/t-butanol (1:1 v/v) of dye (0.5 mM) overnight at room temperature, where the amount of dye adsorbed onto TiO2 was calculated to be 2.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The absorption spectrum of the dye on a 7 μm-thick TiO2 film was recorded (Fig. 3b; vide supra). The spectrum became broader as compared to that in solution as a result of aggregations involving J-aggregates. The absorption profile was found to extend to the near-infrared region. A DSSC with dye 1 was fabricated using 0.6 M of N-methyl-N-butylimidazolium iodide (BMII) + 0.1 M of LiI + 0.05 M of I2 + 0.5 M of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile as the redox electrolyte solution, which was introduced into a sandwich-type cell composed of TiO2 photoanodes and Pt counter electrodes. The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured both in the dark and under illumination from a solar simulator. As shown in Fig. 6a, the J–V curve of the test cell provided Jsc, Voc, and fill factor (FF) values of 19.09 mA cm−2, 0.72 V, and 0.56, respectively. As a result, the PEC (η) was calculated to be 7.69% using the following equation:75η (%) = (Jsc × Voc × FF)/Pm where Pm is the incident power density. As compared to the corresponding parameters of the 2-loaded cell, the values of Jsc and Voc increased for the 1-loaded cell (Table 2); in particular, Jsc was significantly improved by introducing the dibenzo-BODIPY unit into the sensitizer. Fig. 6b shows the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the two cells as a function of wavelength, which in principle is dependent on the photoinduced electron injection into TiO2 and charge recombination. The 1-loaded cell shows a considerably broader EQE spectrum ranging from 400 to 780 nm, making it a good panchromatic sensitizer in DSSCs. The peak at approximately 470 nm in the EQE spectra is ascribable to the phenothiazine moiety, as inferred from that of the 2-loaded cell. We found that the EQE value (up to 42%) due to the 1-loaded cell in the wavelength region from 387 to 525 nm was lower than that of the 2-loaded cell. This can be explained by comparing the loading amounts of 1 (2.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and 2 (3.80 × 10−7 mol cm−2) in Table 2. It is assumed that the molecular size of 1 was larger than that of 2 by introducing π-extended dibenzo-BODIPY. On another front, in longer wavelength regions, a broader curve was observed for the 1-loaded cell, with the onset extending up to 780 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum of 1 on the TiO2 film (Fig. 3b; vide supra). This means that dye aggregation on the TiO2 layer helped increase the light-harvesting efficiency.76 As a result, the EQE spectrum of the 1-loaded cell spreads to a longer wavelength region than that of the N719-loaded cell.

Note that the Voc value of the 1-loaded cell was improved in comparison to that of the 2-loaded cell by introducing the dibenzo-BODIPY unit into the sensitizer. To gain insight into the interfacial charge-transfer process in the cells, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at an applied bias of 0.70 V in the dark. Fig. 7a shows the Bode phase plots of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electron lifetime (τr) was calculated from the plot by τr = 1/(2πfpeak), where fpeak is the frequency where the characteristic peak locates in the mid-frequency (1–100 Hz) range.65 It was found that the electron lifetimes for the photoanodes with TiO2 are 15.7 ms and 11.5 ms for the cells with sensitizers 1 and 2, respectively. The longer electron lifetime of the 1-loaded cell supports the significant enhancement in Voc and FF for photovoltaic performance. Fig. 7b and c show Nyquist plots of the EIS measurements and the equivalent circuit diagram for DSSCs, where Rct and Rce are the charge-transfer resistance of the electrochemical reactions at the photoanode and the counter electrode, respectively. The larger semicircle at mid-frequency represents the charge recombination resistance due to electron transfer from TiO2 to the triiodide. The radius of the larger semicircle for the 1-loaded cell (73.4 ohm) was greater than that with 2 (63.9 ohm), indicating the greater electron recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface which is consistent with the enhanced Voc and FF. In this way, the 1-loaded cell has a larger Rct value and a longer lifetime that corresponds to a high Voc and FF for photovoltaic performances. The slower recombination may be caused by the introduction of the dibenzo-BODIPY unit, which would lead to an increase in hydrophobicity around the surface of the dye-loaded TiO2.

Conclusions
Our ongoing program to propose efficient sensitizers for application in DSSCs led to the synthesis of dibenzo-BODIPY/phenothiazine conjugate 1 with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group on the TiO2 electrode. The synergistic combination of those chromophoric units enabled the production of a panchromatic-active sensitizer with good absorption in the far-red and near-infrared regions (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations suggested that the dye-loaded cell could show improved photovoltaic performance. Indeed, the excellent light-harvesting capability led to a high Jsc of 19.09 mA cm−2. Also, improved Voc was obtained as compared to the phenothiazine-loaded control cell; EIS measurements indicated slower electron combination, possibly because the hydrophobic microenvironment was enhanced by introducing dibenzo-BODIPY at the surface of TiO2. As a result, the 1-loaded cell provided a good η of 7.69%, which is comparable to that of the cell with Ru(II)-based N719 under identical fabrication conditions. This study demonstrated that proper introduction of π-extended dibenzo-BODIPY into organic sensitizers is a promising approach to improving the PCE in DSSCs.
