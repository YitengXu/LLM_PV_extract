    , Accepted 8th December 2014First published on 9th December 2014AbstractWe present the use of halide (PbCl2) and non-halide lead precursors (Pb(OAc)2 (OAc = CH3CH2COO−), Pb(NO3)2, Pb(acac)2 (acac = (CH3COCHCOCH3)−) and PbCO3) for the preparation of perovskite solar cells. We have confirmed by X-ray diffraction the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 in all the analyzed cases, except for PbCO3, independently of the lead precursor used for the synthesis of the perovskite. In addition, different cell configurations, thin films and mesoporous scaffolds, TiO2 or Al2O3, have also been prepared. We have observed that the lead precursor has a strong influence on the structural properties of perovskite (grain size), as well as on the solar cell performance. Photovoltaic conversion efficiencies comparable to those achieved when using the commonly employed PbCl2 have been obtained with Pb(OAc)2 as a lead source. Stability studies of the perovskite films and devices have also been carried out, which demonstrate that the lead precursor also plays a role. The stability is not only strongly affected by atmosphere and illumination conditions, but also by the lead precursor employed for the perovskite synthesis. These results highlight that other lead sources, different to the commonly used PbCl2 and PbI2, are also suitable for the development of PSCs, opening a new way for device performance optimization.
Introduction
Nowadays, hybrid halide perovskites with the general formula ABX3, where X = Cl, Br or I, can be considered, without any doubts, as ideal candidates for the preparation of photovoltaic devices. The most successful and commonly used hybrid halide perovskite for photovoltaic applications has been CH3NH3PbI3 and its analogue prepared from lead chloride, commonly denoted as CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.1–3 The first example of the use of hybrid halide perovskites in solar cells was reported by Miyasaka in 2009,4 and from that moment the field of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) has experienced the best ever efficiency enhancement within an outstandingly short period of time.5 In 2012, the use of perovskite for photovoltaic devices took a step forward with the preparation of all-solid devices with spiro-OMeTAD, as a selective contact and Hole Transporting Material (HTM), producing 10–11% efficiency.6,7 Since then, numerous research groups have focused their efforts on the development of different approaches to optimize this field, mainly based on the use of different cell configurations (TiO2 or Al2O3 scaffolds or planar configurations with no scaffold), use of mixed halide (Br–I) derivatives of CH3NH3PbI3,8–10 exchange of the organic cation CH3NH3+,11–14 use of additives in the HTM15,16 or use of different selective contacts.17–20 In addition, high efficiency samples have been obtained from a broad variety of deposition techniques, including spin-coating6,7 two step procedures involving dip-coating21 or drop casting methods22 and solvent engineering strategies.1 Besides, evaporation procedures have also been demonstrated to be excellent processes for the preparation of perovskite films.23
Although perovskites CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx are normally prepared by the reaction in a solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in a 1:1 ratio or CH3NH3I and PbCl2 in a 3:1 ratio, other non-halide lead precursors such as lead acetate, Pb(OAc)2 or lead nitrate, Pb(NO3)2, are also known to be appropriate candidates for the synthesis of these materials.24–26 However, most of these perovskites, synthesized from non-halide precursors, have not been analyzed in complete photovoltaic devices yet. Therefore, in this article we study the performance and stability of PSCs prepared from non-halide lead precursors. These cells were prepared in mesoporous heterojunction configuration glass/FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous scaffold/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, with the TiO2 or Al2O3 scaffold, and planar configuration glass/FTO/compact TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The performance and stability have been compared to those obtained with the solar cells prepared with the lead chloride precursor, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, as reference. We have observed that the lead precursor employed affects dramatically the perovskite morphology and crystal size, even though the same experimental procedures were followed for the synthesis. Furthermore, preliminary studies of the stability of both perovskite films and PSCs have also been performed and compared with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.
Experimental section
Substrate preparation
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (25 × 25 mm, Pilkington TEC15, ∼15 Ω sq−1 resistance) were etched with zinc powder and HCl (2 M) to obtain 0.224 cm2 of active electrode area. The substrates were cleaned with soap (Hellmanex) and rinsed with Milli-Q water and ethanol. Then, the sheets were sonicated for 15 minutes in a solution of acetone:isopropanol (1:1 v/v), rinsed with ethanol and dried with compressed air. After that, a UV/ozone treatment was performed for 15 minutes. Then, a TiO2 blocking layer was deposited onto the substrates by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C, using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) solution diluted in ethanol (1:39, v/v), with oxygen as the carrier gas. After the spraying process, the films were kept at 450 °C for 5 minutes.
Mesoporous TiO2 layer
When needed, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s using a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT, 20 nm average particle size) diluted in terpineol (1:3, weight ratio). After drying at 80 °C, the TiO2 layers were heated at 470 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. The thickness determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy was ∼200 nm.
Mesoporous Al2O3 layer
When needed, a mesoporous Al2O3 layer was deposited by spin coating at 2500 rpm for 60 s using a colloidal dispersion of <50 nm Al2O3 nanoparticles in isopropanol, followed by drying at 150 °C for 30 minutes. The thickness determined by scanning electron microscopy was ∼200 nm.
Perovskite deposition
The perovskite precursor solution (100 μl), prepared by reacting 2.64 mmol of methylammonium iodide and 0.88 mmol of the corresponding lead precursor at a 3:1 molar ratio in 1 mL of DMF, was spin-coated inside the glove box at 2000 r.p.m. for 60 s. After the deposition, the substrate was kept at 100 °C for 10 min. Next, the substrates were heated at 100 °C for 1 hour in an oven under air stream. The lead precursors used in this work are PbCl2, Pb(OAc)2, Pb(NO3)2, Pb(acac)2 and PbCO3.
Hole transport layer (HTM) deposition
A ∼300–400 nm-thick HTM was deposited on top of the perovskite substrates by spin coating at 4000 r.p.m for 30 s under air conditions, using 100 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile, in 1 mL of chlorobenzene.
Gold electrode deposition
The deposition of 60 nm of gold was performed by thermal evaporation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, using a commercial MBraun vacuum chamber. Before beginning the evaporation, the chamber was evacuated until a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar was reached.
Perovskite film characterization
The morphology and structural properties of the films were analyzed using a JEOL 7001F scanning electron microscope with a film emission gun (SEMFEG) and a Bruker AXS-D4 Endeaver Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. The PL spectra of the films were registered by using a spectrophotometer based on a CCD (Andor i-DUS DV420A-OE) coupled with a spectrograph as a diffraction grating (Newport 77400). A commercial laser diode (532 nm, 52 mW cm−2) was used as an excitation source, whose power intensity was adjusted by means of neutral density filters.
Solar cell characterization
The Incident Photon to Current Efficiency (IPCE) was determined using a xenon lamp power source coupled with a monochromator controlled by a computer; the photocurrent was measured using an optical power meter 70310 from Oriel Instruments and a Si photodiode to calibrate the system. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon arc lamp simulator (Sun 2000, ABET Technologies) with an AM 1.5G spectral filter and a Keithley 2400, previously calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. All the measurements were performed with an opaque mask of 0.08 cm2 and without encapsulation. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out by means of a FRA equipped PGSTAT-30 from Autolab under 1 sun illumination conditions at different applied voltages and applying a 30 mV A/C voltage perturbation over the constant applied bias with a frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 10 mHz.
Results and discussion
With the aim to evaluate the possibility of using non-halide lead sources for the synthesis of perovskite films, we have chosen different lead non-halide reagents: Pb(OAc)2, Pb(NO3)2, Pb(acac)2 and PbCO3. For comparison purposes, we decided to contrast the results obtained with these lead precursors with those achieved in our laboratory with the PbCl2 precursor as a reference. Perovskite films were synthesized as explained in the experimental section. These thin films, obtained using the different lead precursors, were analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). For this purpose, all the perovskite films were prepared onto a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, by spin-coating of a DMF solution of the corresponding lead precursor and CH3NH3I in a 1:3 ratio due to stoichiometric reasons. After the deposition, films were annealed at 100 °C (exact details in the Experimental section). The fastest formation of perovskite was observed when using Pb(OAc)2, probably due to the lower melting point of the excess methylammonium acetate, which is formed as a result of the excess of CH3NH3I employed, see Scheme 1. The reaction between the lead source and CH3NH3I in a 1:3 ratio led to the formation of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and excess of the corresponding methylammonium salt, which was eliminated during the annealing procedure, in agreement with the observations realized by other authors.27,28

XRD measurements of the different perovskite films allowed us to confirm that precursors Pb(OAc)2, Pb(NO3)2 and Pb(acac)2 are suitable candidates for the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 (see Fig. 1). The failure of PbCO3 in the formation of perovskite was attributed to its low solubility in DMF, even at 80 °C (not shown in Fig. 1). In all the cases analyzed in Fig. 1, diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 are clearly recognized indicating the formation of this perovskite when using the four different lead precursors. PbCl2, Pb(OAc)2 and Pb(NO3)2 produce CH3NH3PbI3 films with preferential (110) orientation, especially the former two, as can be deduced from the relative intensities between diffraction peaks in comparison with powder samples. As previously observed, the presence of a minor peak at 2θ ∼ 12.75 °C indicates that traces of PbI2 remain in the film.17 This peak is sensibly reduced when Pb(NO3)2 is used as a lead precursor. The presence of the PbI2 phase does not imply necessarily a deleterious effect for device performance, as it has been reported a passivation effect of CH3NH3PbI3 by PbI2.29 The intensity of this peak increases for Pb(acac)2, suggesting that in this case the reaction is not complete. Note that different precursors are compared using the same experimental procedures, probably a film and subsequent photovoltaic device will require a different optimized preparation procedure for each precursor for an optimum behavior. Moreover, the presence of additional peaks in the XRD spectrum of the perovskite film, corresponding to the substrate (FTO and TiO2), for Pb(acac)2 and to a lesser extent in Pb(NO3)2 precursor, suggests that further optimization of the reaction process is needed.
 Fig. 1  XRD of the films prepared with different lead precursors, with the exception of PbCO3 that does not produce CH3NH3PbI3 using the common synthesis procedure employed. 
Absorbance data also proved that perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 can be synthesized from the non-halide lead reagents Pb(OAc)2, Pb(NO3)2 and Pb(acac)2, by comparison with the spectra obtained when using PbCl2. As can be seen in Fig. 2a (normalized absorption spectra), all non-halide precursors and reference formed perovskite films that present similar absorption spectra features. However, the absorption signal for Pb(NO3)2 is deformed in comparison with the reference sample. This effect arises from the light scattering of the sample mainly due to the non-homogeneous film deposition when using this lead source. Besides, the intensity of the absorption spectrum is significantly lower (Fig. S1, ESI†), thus suggesting that although perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is formed, further improvement is needed in order to obtain an optimal amount and quality of the perovskite deposited. Additionally, photoluminescence data (Fig. 2b) confirmed that all the samples showed the same emission pattern regardless of the lead precursor employed for the perovskite preparation. Curiously, a small shift in the maximum for each emission is observed depending on the lead source, which could be attributed to the different morphology of the perovskite crystal of each film sample. In fact, previous studies revealed a direct influence of the crystal size on the optical properties of the perovskite films.30,31 Particularly, a slight blue-shift of the absorption and photoluminescence signals is observed for small crystallites. In any case, further studies are required for elucidating the fundamentals of this phenomenon; nevertheless these issues are out of the scope of this work.

The morphology of the perovskite films, using Pb(OAc)2 and PbCl2 precursors, was analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images taken from samples with and without TiO2 mesoporous scaffold configuration. Samples prepared with a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold present an overlayer of perovskite that does not cover completely the mesoporous layer, see Fig. 3c and d. Interestingly, smaller crystal sizes of perovskite were obtained for the case of Pb(OAc)2 (in both configurations flat and with mesoporous scaffold), probably due to the fast crystallization, in comparison with the PbCl2 precursor, detected when using this reagent. These results reflect how the type of lead precursor utilized for the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 affects dramatically the morphological properties of perovskite layers.

XRD analysis clearly establishes the preparation of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films from non-halide lead precursors, but different morphological properties have been revealed by SEM micrograph analysis. In order to study the influence on the final photovoltaic performance, PSCs have been prepared using the different lead precursors under study. All devices were prepared using the same experimental procedure (details in the Experimental section). Fig. 4 and Table 1 present the performance of the best PSCs obtained from each lead precursor. As can be seen, only PSCs prepared from Pb(OAc)2 gave satisfactory results in terms of efficiency, comparable to those obtained with the reference PbCl2 precursor (entries 2 and 1, respectively). On the other hand, Pb(NO3)2 and Pb(acac)2 gave PSCs with low efficiencies (entries 3 and 4, respectively). These results demonstrate that perovskites for solar cell devices can be prepared from lead sources different to the conventional halide precursors PbCl2 or PbI2. In addition, the PSC performance depends dramatically on the lead precursor employed, and optimum performance should require a different optimization of growth conditions and preparation. An important correlation between solar cell efficiency and lead precursor was previously reported for quantum dot sensitized solar cells using PbS as a light absorbing material.32 In that case, a clear influence of the lead precursor on the trap states was established.

Cells using the two precursors presenting the highest efficiencies, PbCl2 and Pb(OAc)2, have been prepared with different configurations, i.e. TiO2 or Al2O3 scaffolds or without any scaffold (details in the Experimental section). From the data shown in Table 2, it can be concluded that the best results in terms of efficiency were obtained when using a configuration with a mesoporous TiO2 layer of 200 nm. In all the configurations studied, Pb(OAc)2 provided lower efficiency than samples prepared with PbCl2, however it is important to note that the deposition technique employed for both precursors was the same, these procedures being only optimized for PbCl2. All these results are promising regarding the preparation of high efficiency PSCs from non-halide lead precursors, though additional research is needed to find the optimum deposition conditions, presumably different to the ones employed for PbCl2. It is noteworthy that the use of Pb(OAc)2 allowed the preparation of flat perovskite solar cells (without scaffold), whereas this configuration is not straightforward when using PbI2 instead of PbCl2.33 This fact adds an additional degree of versatility in the use of Pb(OAc)2 as a lead source.

Moreover, it is also interesting to highlight that an important cell parameter, open circuit potential, Voc, depends more strongly on PSC configuration than on the lead precursor employed. A lower Voc is observed when the TiO2 scaffold is used in comparison with samples prepared using the Al2O3 scaffold or no-scaffold, see Table 2. From impedance spectroscopy characterization, see Fig. 5, it can be clearly observed that at high applied bias, samples with the TiO2 scaffold present a lower recombination resistance, Rrec, than flat samples, indicating a lower recombination rate for planar cells. Nevertheless, few differences are detected regarding the lead precursors when samples using the same configuration are compared. Rrec has been obtained by fitting the impedance spectra with the equivalent circuits previously described.10,34 These results are in good agreement with the lower recombination rate, and consequently higher Voc, observed for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in a flat device35 and in samples with the Al2O3 scaffold,10 in comparison with samples using the TiO2 scaffold, where just halide lead precursors were used for perovskite formation.

The use of different lead precursors leads to the preparation of perovskite layers with different morphological properties, producing photovoltaic devices with different performances. In order to unveil further influence of lead precursors on another important cell issue, i.e., stability, we have carried out preliminary stability studies of perovskite films and devices under three different conditions of atmosphere and illumination: (i) air with light (A), (ii) air without light (B) and (iii) N2 atmosphere without light (C). Samples tested under A conditions were left under lab ambient illumination. These studies were performed for perovskites obtained from PbCl2 and Pb(OAc)2 precursors. Fig. 6 shows the cell parameters of the devices prepared and stored under conditions A and B for several days. It can be clearly observed that independent of the precursor, cells stored under ambient lab illumination (conditions A) present a continuous decrease of their efficiency, showing an efficiency just ∼20% of the initial one after 15 days of exposure to conditions A. This efficiency decrease can be attributed mainly to a decrease of photocurrent, and additionally to a reduction of the FF. Noteworthily, the decrease in cell performance is slightly higher in the case of devices prepared from Pb(OAc)2 than for the analogues from PbCl2. Moreover, under dark storage conditions instead of lab illumination (conditions B), the performance of reference cells, using the PbCl2 precursor, presents a good stability after 32 days. However, during this period the efficiency of cells prepared from Pb(OAc)2 was reduced to ∼40% of the initial value. Under conditions C, the stability increases even further and efficiencies around 97% and 84% of the initial values are preserved after two months for samples prepared with PbCl2 and Pb(OAc)2, respectively (see ESI, Table S1 and Fig. S4†). This study reflects that lead precursors not only affect the film morphology or cell performance, but also the device stability. These aspects have to be considered for further optimization of the cell performance and stability using non-conventional precursors.
 Fig. 6  Normalized cell parameters short circuit current, Jsc, open circuit potential, Voc, fill factor, FF, and photoconversion efficiency, η, to the values obtained after device preparation (day 0). Parameters measured under 1 sun illumination at different times after preparation. Values represented are average values of 10 samples and error bars indicate the standard deviation. Samples were stored under conditions A (air with light) and condition B (air without light). The parameter values were obtained from the J–V curves scanned from positive voltage to zero, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Finally, the stability of the perovskite films, without HTM, was studied by recording the absorption spectra of the perovskite films for 40 days (Fig. S5†) and taking pictures of them to observe their degradation (Fig. S6†). An analogous trend to that observed for complete devices has been obtained for perovskite films. These results indicate that the main cause of the loss of efficiency in PSC using spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM is the degradation of the perovskite layer. The use of CuSCN as an alternative HTL can reduce perovskite degradation.36 It is also important to remark the important effect of photodegradation, in good agreement with previous reports.36 Future development of this technology will require the consideration of these stability issues, where employed precursors play an important role, in addition to the high efficiency.
The literature on the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs reflects the high versatility of this material, which can be produced from a large variety of preparation methods, the most relevant being the single step solution process,7 sequential deposition,21 vapor deposition23 and use of solvent engineering,1 among others. This versatility has had important consequences as the fast enhancement of the efficiencies reported for PSCs has been obtained by an empirical optimization of the perovskite deposition method. In addition to this, in this article we show the existence of another important factor that can affect the perovskite growth process, the precursor employed in the synthesis. In the case of non-halide lead precursors, their corresponding anions are not incorporated into the perovskite structure. However, it does not mean that these anions are mere spectators of the perovskite synthesis, as they affect the final characteristics, from the morphological, optical, electrical and stability points of view.
Another interesting feature affected by the results presented here is related to one of the first discussions that arose in this field, i.e. the role of Cl in the performance of PSCs. Since the seminal publication of Snaith and Miyasaka6 employing PbCl2 for the preparation of perovskites, there has been an interesting debate about the role of Cl. While some authors have pointed out that Cl is incorporated into the perovskite crystalline structure, which produces CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite instead of the pure iodine CH3NH3PbI3, thus slowing down the nucleation dynamics,37,38 others have recently claimed that perovskite prepared from the chloride precursor yields a perovskite film consisting of a combination of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbCl3.39 However, most of the studies focusing on the physical properties of these materials have established that the use of PbCl2 affects dramatically the properties of the perovskite film, such as a significant increase of the diffusion length of free carriers (exceeding 1 μm) and photoluminescence lifetime,40,41 properties that are crucial for the development of highly efficient devices. Nevertheless, the exact amount of Cl incorporated into the crystalline structure was very small (below 3–4%)42 or even below the detection limit of the techniques employed in the compositional analysis.43 Therefore, the combination of iodide and chloride lead precursors reflects a strong influence of morphology, thus affecting the final cell performance.43,44 The results in this work point in the same direction, extending the influence of the lead precursor on perovskite properties to non-halide precursors.
Conclusions
We have prepared CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films and PSCs using different lead precursors. We have obtained devices with significant efficiency with the non-halide sources Pb(NO3)2, Pb(acac)2 and Pb(OAc)2, reaching efficiencies close to the reference cells prepared with PbCl2 for the case of precursor Pb(OAc)2. We propose a similar reaction process when a lead precursor different to PbI2 is used. In that case, a 3:1 molar ratio between CH3NH3I and PbX2 is needed to ensure the final stoichiometry of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. By using these experimental conditions, an excess of methylammonium salt remains unreacted, in contrast when using PbI2 and CH3NH3I in a 1:1 molar ratio. However, the use of non-iodine lead precursors influences the final properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films, provoking important implications in the final solar cell performance. We have observed that the morphology of perovskite films, the photoconversion efficiencies and the stability of the devices are strongly influenced by the lead precursor used. The use of the Pb(OAc)2 precursor has produced cells with efficiencies very close to the reference samples prepared with PbCl2, being a promising precursor for further improvement of PSC performance, but presenting lower long term stability than reference. The preparation of PSCs from non-halide lead precursors, different to the normally used PbI2 and PbCl2, clarifies some former questions on perovskite synthesis and properties. The use of non-halide sources opens a new research line in concordance with the use of non-passive reactants for the optimization of this kind of solar cell. These non-passive reactants might affect the final film properties, not only in terms of efficiency but also in stability.

 	Scheme 1  General reactions proposed for the synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite from different lead precursors.	 

 	Fig. 1  XRD of the films prepared with different lead precursors, with the exception of PbCO3 that does not produce CH3NH3PbI3 using the common synthesis procedure employed.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Light absorption spectra normalized at 750 nm and (b) normalized photoluminescence of the films prepared with different lead precursors.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM picture of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer growth on a flat substrate with (a) PbCl2 and (b) Pb(OAc)2 lead precursors, and on a substrate with a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold with (c) PbCl2 and (d) Pb(OAc)2 lead precursors. Scale bar represents 100 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V curve for PSCs prepared with different lead precursors using a 200 nm TiO2 mesoporous scaffold layer. Champion cells obtained for each lead precursor are represented. J–V curves were scanned from positive voltage to zero, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.

 	Fig. 5  Recombination resistance, Rrec, PSCs prepared with Pb(OAc)2 and PbCl2 as lead precursors, for flat and TiO2 scaffold configurations.	 

 	Fig. 6  Normalized cell parameters short circuit current, Jsc, open circuit potential, Voc, fill factor, FF, and photoconversion efficiency, η, to the values obtained after device preparation (day 0). Parameters measured under 1 sun illumination at different times after preparation. Values represented are average values of 10 samples and error bars indicate the standard deviation. Samples were stored under conditions A (air with light) and condition B (air without light). The parameter values were obtained from the J–V curves scanned from positive voltage to zero, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
