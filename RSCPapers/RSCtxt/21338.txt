    , Accepted 20th June 2016First published on 20th June 2016AbstractIn virtue of the abundant sodium resources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered to be one of the promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, current research concentrates mostly on sodium ion half-cells, and the development of sodium ion full cells with high performance remains a critical challenge. Here we rationally designed a full sodium-ion battery based on nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 materials as the anodes and cathodes, owing to their advantageous electrochemical features. The full cell outputs one of the highest operating voltages close to 2.9 V and delivers a large reversible capacity of 114 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1C. It also shows outstanding rate capability (∼74 mA h g−1 at 2C rate) and excellent cycling stability (92.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles). A high energy density of 220 W h kg−1 is achieved, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art LIBs. Moreover, the temperature-dependent charge–discharge tests indicate excellent capacity retentions in a wide temperature range of −20 to 55 °C.

Broader context
The depletion of non-renewable resources has pushed the present fossil fuel dependent energy economy to be at a serious risk. A promising solution is to adopt renewable energy coupled with efficient energy storage systems. Lithium ion batteries with high energy density can potentially take this role. However, lithium is not considered to be an abundant element and the cost of lithium is predicted to keep increasing in the future. Sodium ion batteries, given the almost infinite supply of sodium resources, are the most promising alternative in this regard. Since the size of sodium ion is larger than lithium ion, the requirement of electrode materials to accommodate sodium ions and allow reversible and rapid ion insertion/extraction is more stringent. In this work, we designed an asymmetric sodium ion full battery based on nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 layered materials. The designed battery exhibits high operating voltage, large reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability and thermal stability in a wide temperature range. The demonstrated energy density approaches that of the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries.

The energy crisis is escalating with concerns of the global warming and environmental pollution caused by the rapid consumption of fossil fuels. There is increasing interest in energy transition from natural resources towards renewable energy resources such as wind and solar.1,2 The intermittence of these resources requires high efficiency electrical energy storage systems.3–5 Electrochemical energy storage devices, for example, rechargeable batteries, can effectively store and release electricity via chemical reactions, offering huge market potentials for the electric/hybrid electric vehicles and smart grids.6–9 Although LIBs have been rapidly developed and are widely used, it is also true that easily accessible global lithium reserves largely exist in politically sensitive or remote areas.10–14 Therefore, the strong motivation for rechargeable batteries based on low-cost electrode materials is driving the research towards battery systems beyond the Li-ion.
As an alternative to LIBs, SIBs that share a similar chemical storage mechanism have been pursued since sodium resources are practically inexhaustible and are evenly distributed around the world (its Clarke's number is 2.644).10,15–18 For the past several years, great efforts have been made in the search for suitable electrode materials.19 Carbonaceous materials such as graphene and hard carbon have been extensively investigated as anode materials for SIBs because of the abundant edge sites and large interlayer distance for sodiation/desodiation.20,21 Transition metal oxides are also emerging as promising electrodes due to their high capacity; however, the choice is rather limited owing to the competition of insertion (only being favored for early 3d metal oxides) vs. conversion reactions.22,23 Ti-based oxides have been proved as an attractive alternative to the aforementioned materials due to their high electrochemical performance, low working potentials, large density and environmental benignity.24 Regarding the cathode materials, sodium-containing layered oxides like O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, P2-Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O225 and O3 + P2-composite Na0.66Li0.18Mn0.71Ni0.21Co0.08O2+δ26 have been well studied. However, the phase transformation during the charge–discharge process causes a serious decay in capacity, resulting in a poor cycle life.27 Recently, vanadyl phosphate (VOPO4) materials have become a promising cathode material for SIBs due to its high operating voltage, structure stability and high specific capacity. Zhu et al. demonstrated that VOPO4 nanosheets exhibited high rate capability for SIBs due to its ultrathin 2D nature and large intercalation pseudocapacitance.28 He et al. also synthesized layered VOPO4via chemical delithiation of tetragonal α1-LiVOPO4, showing a high reversible capacity and cycling stability for SIBs.29
Despite its advantage of low price, the safety issue becomes more important in SIBs due to the higher activity of sodium metal when exposed to oxygen or moisture.30 Taking these factors into account, the construction of sodium ion full cell systems based on an appropriate set of anode and cathode is critically important to ensure its safety.31 Current sodium ion full cells are mainly fabricated using hard carbon as the anode material, which is capable of providing high voltage when matched with the cathode. However, it suffers from inferior rate capability, and the voltage plateau related to most capacities is too close to the sodium plating voltage, causing a safety concern.32 Recently, Guo et al. designed a sodium ion full cell based on a layered P2-Na0.66Ni0.17Co0.17Ti0.66O2 bipolar electrode, which showed very promising properties with long cycle life and high rate capability (65 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 2C).33 However, in order to achieve an even higher energy density sodium ion full cell, asymmetric devices need to be designed and studied. Previous reports about the sodium ion full cell based on a sodium storage cathode and a nonmetallic sodium anode are far from a satisfactory breakthrough.20,34–37 It remains a challenge to fabricate such a full cell with high safety, outstanding rate capability and cycling stability.
Herein, we develop a novel sodium ion full cell, utilizing the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes as the anode and ultrathin VOPO4 nanosheets as the cathode to build a sodium ion full cell with promising electrochemical characteristics. The Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes possess a layered structure, not only exhibiting a safe and low average voltage (ca. 0.55 V) of sodium ion insertion/extraction, but also showing outstanding rate capability and cycle stability. The ultrathin VOPO4 nanosheets show a high voltage of ca. 3.75 V and deliver attractive electrochemical performance. When assembled into a sodium ion full cell, the device shows a high rate capability (74 mA h g−1 capacity at a high rate of 2C), an operating voltage (ca. 2.9 V) and outstanding cycling stability (92.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles). Moreover, temperature-dependent charge–discharge tests indicate excellent capacity retention in a wide temperature range from −20 to 55 °C. This work demonstrates that the Na2Ti3O7 anode and VOPO4 cathode can be suitable candidates for use in high voltage and stable sodium ion full batteries for large-scale energy storage.
The Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes are prepared via a hydrothermal method under alkaline conditions, using a titanium powder (see the ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2) as the precursor. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a) reveals that all characteristic peaks of the as-prepared samples can be readily indexed to the standard card (JPCDS No. 59-0666).37Fig. 1b–d depicts the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the as-prepared Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes. As shown in Fig. 1b, a network structure of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes is formed. The typical size of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes is ca. 10 nm in diameter and several hundreds of nanometer in length, as clearly shown in the STEM image (Fig. 1c). The structural crystallinity of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes is revealed by the HRTEM image. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the TEM image of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes, further confirming the nanotube shape structure with a typical inner diameter size of ca. 5 nm. The HRTEM image identifies its layered structure with the inter-planar distance of 0.92 nm, corresponding to the (100) crystal planes of Na2Ti3O7 (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes are also shown in Fig. 1e, and the results match well with the XRD patterns and are in accordance with the previous report.39

SEM images for the prepared Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes (b) and exfoliated VOPO4 nanosheets (g). HRTEM images and associated SAED patterns of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes (c–e) and exfoliated VOPO4 nanosheets (h–j). 
The ultrathin VOPO4 nanosheets are fabricated via a liquid-phase exfoliation of VOPO4·2H2O bulk chunks in 2-propanol solvent according to our previously reported work.28 The morphology and structure characterization of the exfoliated VOPO4 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 1f–j. Fig. S4a (ESI†) shows the top-view SEM images of the bulk VOPO4·2H2O chunks with a square shape character. The side-view SEM image (Fig. S4b, ESI†) manifests that the VOPO4·2H2O chunks possess the lamellar structure of which many layers are tightly stacked. After ultrasonication these products (drop-cast on the SiO2/Si substrate) have been all transformed into a sheet-like morphology (Fig. 1g) with a much smaller thickness compared with the bulk samples. Fig. 1h shows the STEM image of a single VOPO4 nanosheet that is observed on a diluted solution drop-cast on a lacey carbon grid. The subtle structural changes before and after the exfoliation are compared via the characterization of XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 1f. All of the identified peaks of bulk VOPO4·2H2O chunks can be perfectly indexed to tetragonal VOPO4·2H2O with the standard JCPDS card No. 84-0111.40 However, only the (00l) basal plane lines (shifted to a large angle) of the exfoliated nanosheets can be observed; the (h0l) lines can no longer be seen. This can be explained by the exfoliation of bulk VOPO4·2H2O chunks into thin nanosheets: thickness in the c-axis decreases during exfoliation, and the interlayer spacing distance decreases as H2O molecules leave the VOPO4 matrix. In addition, the HRTEM image and SAED pattern demonstrate the single crystalline nature of the nanosheets.
The electrochemical characteristics of the Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 electrodes were assessed by a constant charge–discharge test in half-cells vs. Na+/Na. Fig. 2a shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the aforementioned samples/Na configuration. The CV curve of VOPO4 in the orange part of Fig. 2a shows an oxidation peak at 3.75 V and a reduction peak at 3.4 V, corresponding to the redox couples of V5+/V4+. Accordingly, the orange part of Fig. 2c shows the voltage profile for the typical discharge–charge cycle from 2.5 to 4.3 V vs. Na+/Na at a current density of 50 mA g−1. The normalized capacity was the ratio between the discharge capacity of VOPO4 and its theoretical capacity (166 mA h g−1). The charge–discharge curve displays a reversible, distinct plateau of 3.75 V, which agrees well with the CV curve as shown in Fig. 2a. The blue area in Fig. 2a shows the CV curve of the Na2Ti3O7 in the voltage range between 0.01 V and 2.5 V with a distinct redox peak at about 0.55 V, attributed to the redox reaction of Ti4+/Ti3+. Its corresponding discharge–charge profile is displayed in the blue area of Fig. 2c, and the apparent step is also validated by the CV curve. As the capacity of Na2Ti3O7 obtained at 50 mA g−1 is close to its theoretical capacity (266 mA h g−1),38 the value for the normalized capacity is ca. 1.0. The detailed electrochemical performances of Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 in half-cells including the rate capability and cycle stability are investigated subsequently. Fig. 2b shows the schematic of the working potential of the V5+/V4+ redox couple vs. Na+/Na in layered Na2Ti3O7 and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples vs. Na+/Na in layered VOPO4. The average charge potential of the asymmetric cell based on the VOPO4 cathode and Na2Ti3O7 anode is predicted on the basis of their voltage difference, shown in the inset of Fig. 2b.

The insets display the average potentials of the VOPO4 and Na2Ti3O7/Na half cells as the cathode and the anode, respectively, and further predicted the average charge voltage of 3.2 V in the Na2Ti3O7//VOPO4 full cells. (c) The typical charge–discharge profiles of the VOPO4 in the voltage range of 2.5–4.3 V for V5+/V4+ (orange) and Na2Ti3O7 in the voltage range of 0.01–2.5 V for the Ti4+/Ti3+ (blue) vs. Na+/Na. 

Fig. 3a shows the results of the Na2Ti3O7 anode tested at a current density of 50 mA g−1 from the 2nd to 4th cycle. The initial sodiation (discharge) capacity of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes is 624 mA h g−1 as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). The capacity decreases to ∼283 mA h g−1 in the second discharge process and decays slowly in the subsequent cycles. This is possibly due to some reactivity with sp carbon and/or pronounced electrolyte decomposition as indicated by the continuous voltage decay down to ca. 0 V. For low-potential intercalation oxides, Na3Ti2(PO4)322 and also Na2Ti3O7 exhibit inferior capacity retention when cycled at a lower C-rate; however, the reasons have not yet been well understood. Fig. 3b shows the multiple-current testing of Na2Ti3O7. It is clear that the nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 electrode displays a very high capacity and excellent cycling properties during high rate testing. A stable specific capacity of ca. 220 mA h g−1 can be obtained at a low current density of 0.1 A g−1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the Na2Ti3O7 can still deliver a high reversible capacity of ca. 155 mA h g−1. After rapid changes of the current densities, the Na2Ti3O7 nanotube electrode shows stable capacities at each state (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, the cells are further discharged–charged to 0.6 A g−1 for 100 cycles, where reversible discharge capacities of ca. 186 and ca. 176 mA h g−1 were obtained at the 1st and 100th cycles, respectively, with only 5.12% capacity loss.

(d) The typical discharge–charge profiles of VOPO4 between 2.0 and 4.3 V at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. The corresponding rate capability (e) and cycling performance (f) with coulombic efficiency over 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 A g−1. 
The first discharge–charge profile of the VOPO4 cathode at a current density of 50 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†), and it depicts that a low discharge capacity of ca. 26 mA h g−1 is obtained. Very recently, He et al. also found this phenomena and they supposed that it possibly originated from the protons in the structure introduced during the desodiation process.29 The reversible discharge capacity of the VOPO4 nanosheets is 128 mA h g−1, corresponding to 0.77 Na deintercalation/intercalation per formula unit (Fig. 3d). The rate capability of the product is also tested. It can be seen from Fig. 3e that the reversible capacities are 118, 99, 89, 85 and 75 mA h g−1 at constant current densities of 0.2 A g−1, 0.4 A g−1, 0.8 A g−1, 1 A g−1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The long-term cyclic stability of the VOPO4 nanosheet cathode is also excellent at the current density of 0.2 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 3f.
Prompted by the above results, it is expected that the as-prepared Na2Ti3O7 nanotube anode and VOPO4 nanosheet cathode can be promising candidates for sodium ion full cells. In order to reduce the polarization and irreversibility effect of the electrode materials in the first discharge process (both for the anode and cathode sides), pre-desodiated Na2Ti3O7 and pre-sodiated VOPO4 were prepared in advance. The full cell is investigated under galvanostatic cycling conditions at room temperature in the voltage window of 1.8–3.8 V. Fig. 4a illustrates the representative CV curve of a Na2Ti3O7//VOPO4 full cell at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Two well-defined peaks can be observed at 2.86 V (cathodic sweep) and 3.19 V (anodic sweep), which are consistent with the predicted values in Fig. 2b. The rate capability test shown in Fig. 4c demonstrates that the full cell can be effectively cycled at different rates of 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C and 5C. The capacity varies from 114 mA h g−1 at a 0.1C rate to 102 mA h g−1 at a 0.5C rate. Even at a rate of 2C, the discharge capacity remains at 74 mA h g−1, approximately 65% of the reversible capacity at a rate of 0.1C. Fig. 4d shows the cycling performance and corresponding coulombic efficiency tested at a rate of 1C. It is worth noting that more than 92.4% capacity still remains after 100 desodiation and sodiation cycles, indicating the outstanding cycling stability of the Na2Ti3O7//VOPO4 based full cell. We are not aware of other asymmetric sodium ion full cells that are capable of meeting these performances so far. Fig. 5 summarizes many recently reported sodium ion full cell configurations, where their main electrochemical parameters such as voltage, capacity, energy density and power density are concluded in the plots. In comparison, our Na2Ti3O7//VOPO4 full cells display superior electrochemical performances, and more detailed data are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, a flexible punch cell based on the Na2Ti3O7 anode and the VOPO4 cathode is fabricated to demonstrate its potential application. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4b, the punch cell is able to power an array of commercial red light-emitting diode (LED) for UT logo (longhorn) even when the cell is completely rolled.

The electrochemical performance, safety and life of the rechargeable batteries are all affected by the operation and/or storage temperatures.45,46 However, current reports on sodium ion batteries are mostly operated at room temperature. To this end, we further evaluate the temperature-dependent capacity retention of our Na2Ti3O7/VOPO4 full cell at 1C rate at various operation temperatures (Fig. 6). As the temperature increases, the capacity retention displays a positive correlation characteristic. It exhibits a high value of 128% at 55 °C, and only 11% capacity is lost at 0 °C. And a capacity retention of ca. 60% can still be obtained at low temperature, down to −20 °C. The electrochemical characteristics of the Na2Ti3O7/VOPO4 full cell at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Temperature-dependent capacity retention of a Na2Ti3O7/VOPO4 based full cell at 1C rate (the capacity retention obtained at 20 °C is defined as 100%). 
In summary, layered crystalline structured Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes and VOPO4 nanosheets are systematically investigated as the anode and cathode materials for building high performance sodium ion full cells. We have made a step forward in the field as the asymmetric sodium ion full cell reported here shows excellent reversible capacity, rate capability and cycle stability. A stable reversible capacity of 76 mA h g−1 at 0.1C can be calculated based on the mass of both the anode and cathode materials with a maximum energy density of 220 W h kg−1. Considering the accepted 40% penalty factor to account for the weight of the case, current collectors, electrolyte and so on, a practical energy density of 132 W h kg−1 can be anticipated. All the above findings demonstrate that the designed sodium ion full cell system appears to be one of the potentially promising SIBs for future large-scale energy storage.

Broader context
The depletion of non-renewable resources has pushed the present fossil fuel dependent energy economy to be at a serious risk. A promising solution is to adopt renewable energy coupled with efficient energy storage systems. Lithium ion batteries with high energy density can potentially take this role. However, lithium is not considered to be an abundant element and the cost of lithium is predicted to keep increasing in the future. Sodium ion batteries, given the almost infinite supply of sodium resources, are the most promising alternative in this regard. Since the size of sodium ion is larger than lithium ion, the requirement of electrode materials to accommodate sodium ions and allow reversible and rapid ion insertion/extraction is more stringent. In this work, we designed an asymmetric sodium ion full battery based on nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 layered materials. The designed battery exhibits high operating voltage, large reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability and thermal stability in a wide temperature range. The demonstrated energy density approaches that of the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries.
