    , Accepted 20th April 2018First published on 4th May 2018AbstractIn just a few years the efficiency of organic–inorganic perovskites has reached 22.1%. Long term stability and lead toxicity are their two main hurdles to overcome for commercialization as solar cells. Keeping these significant challenges in mind, we use ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and incorporate mixed Ca/(Ge, Sn) and Sr/(Ge, Sn) at the B-site of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) to get Pb-free perovskites with excellent properties. Tunability of the band gaps is observed while decreasing the ratios of Sn and Ge. The predicted band gaps (<2.01 eV) determined using the HSE06 functional reveal that all of the studied mixed perovskites are in a highly favorable range for solar cells. Out of the 12 studied, five materials are in the ideal range for the top cell in tandem solar cells (1.70–1.90 eV); meanwhile 2 perovskites fall in the optimum band gap range of single junction solar cells. The enthalpy of formation study confirms that all of the mixed Pb-free perovskites are more stable than MAPbI3. We also calculated the effective masses, uncovering the lower effective mass of these materials. We expect excellent carrier mobility as a consequence of this. This work is of high importance for the solar industry due to the low cost (Ca and Sr are highly earth abundant), non-toxic nature and higher absorption of the perovskites investigated as compared to the toxic MAPbI3.
I. Introduction
In the 1970s and 1990s hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (HOIPs) attracted a lot of attention because of their unique semiconducting properties.1–3 Up to now, they are among the hottest topics in materials science. The first work on these materials as light absorbers in solar cells was reported in 2009, with efficiencies of 3.8% and 3.1% for CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3), respectively.4 For perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the highest efficiency that has been achieved so far is 22.1%.5
MAPbI3 has impressive properties such as a sharp optical band edge, appropriate band gap (Eg = 1.55 eV),6 extremely high absorption coefficient,7 long charge carrier diffusion length,8 high defect tolerance,9 excellent ambipolar charge carrier transport10 and simple solution processing at low temperature,11 making PSCs promising for PV technology. Furthermore, interchanging or mixing the A-site12,13 or divalent B-site12,14,15 cations, as well as replacing or mixing the halides,16 can tune the band gap from 1.1 to 2.3 eV. These properties further lead to other optoelectronic applications, for instance, LEDs,17 lasers,18 photodetectors19 and photodiodes.20,21
However, there are two main problems: the stability and toxicity of lead (Pb) in HOIPs. MAPbI3 shows instability even under normal atmospheric conditions.22 This instability (degradation) is due to several factors, in which structural (phase), thermal, atmospheric (moisture and air) and light instability are very common.23–25 For structural stability we should take note of the Goldschmidt rules26 (refer to Section III for details). Though MAPbI3 exists in the perovskite phase with a tetragonal structure at room temperature, it easily transforms into a lower symmetry orthorhombic phase at lower temperatures (162 K) and to a higher symmetry (cubic) phase at higher temperatures (60 °C).27 Although the tetragonal and cubic phases are highly suitable for good PV performance, the structural transitions degrade their suitability throughout the materials’ lifetime.28 In addition to the structural instability, the volatile nature of the organic MA-cation can induce instability in MAPbI3.22 To reduce this instability, it is beneficial to mix the MA-cation with other organic or inorganic cations.12,13,29 Moreover, replacing or mixing the halide anions can also increase the stability.12 Recently a new strategy of mixing Mn, Sr, Co, Zn, Cu, Mg, Ni and Sn at the B-site in MAPbI3 resulted in increased stability while maintaining the PV performance.30
In addition to the instability issue, we are also concerned about the lead toxicity in HOIPs. The degradation of PbI2 causes severe health problems31, specifically, it is potentially carcinogenic.32,33 Furthermore, lead pollution impacts on land and water resources, greenhouse gas emissions and the abundance of input materials.34–36 These critical issues have limited the large scale commercialization of MAPbI3 and have motivated researchers to investigate an environmentally friendly replacement for Pb with comparable or better efficiency. Thus, the possibility of replacing Pb with various single elements has been explored, including Sn37 and Ge,38,39 or by mixing Pb with other elements, like SnxPb1−x,15,29,40,41 Pb/B′ (B′ = Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Sn, Sr or Zn).30
In addition, there have been numerous computational scanning searches for lead-free perovskites. Sun et al. investigated MAGexPb1−xI3 (x = 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00) by using DFT,42 showing that MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 is an excellent and stable PV candidate (η = 24.24%). Sun et al.43 showed that MABiSeI2 and MABiSI2 have ideal band gaps of 1.29 and 1.38 eV, respectively. Wang et al.44 investigated the cubic phase of MAMI3 (M = Pb, Sn, Ge or Sr) and suggested that simply replacing Pb with these elements will not lead to higher efficiency. MA(Tl or In)0.5Bi0.5I3 has been proposed as having almost similar properties to MAPbI3.45 The introduction of Sr2+ into MAPbI3 films was also studied.46
Motivated by these advances, we present for the first time a systematic DFT study on Pb-free perovskites by replacing Pb with divalent mixed species in perovskite MAPbI3, i.e. MA(Ca/(Ge, Sn))I3 and MA(Sr/(Ge, Sn))I3. We study the percentage ratios 12.5/87.5, 37.5/62.5 and 50/50 (molar ratios 1/7, 3/5 and 4/4) for Ca/(Ge, Sn) as well as for Sr/(Ge, Sn). Calcium (Ca) is the 5th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust as well as in the human body. Strontium (Sr) is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, and is fairly nontoxic as illustrated by the fact that strontium acetate is an active ingredient in toothpaste. Ca and Sr have highly inert oxidation states, are non-toxic and economical, and have ionic radii (Ca = 100 pm and Sr = 118 pm) comparable to that of Pb2+ (119 pm). The aims of this study are to propose Pb-free perovskites which exhibit increased stability and reduced toxicity while maintaining or raising the PV performance. The replacement of Pb with two elements is a new idea and may provide a fruitful and broad topic of study for lead-free perovskites. The results show that the proposed lead-free perovskites exhibit enhanced optoelectronic properties and have great potential for future green energy applications.
II. Methodology
Density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the VASP package47 was used. Structural optimization and electronic structure calculations were performed within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.48 We used a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the tetragonal structure with space group I4/mcm. There were a total of 96 atoms of which there are 8 lead (Pb) atoms (Fig. 1(a)). The electronic wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with a cut-off energy (Ecut) of 520 eV. For structural conversion 3 × 3 × 3 k-points and a force criterion of 0.025 eV Å−1 were used. k-points of 4 × 4 × 4 were used for optical and self-consistency calculations. In the band structure calculations four special k-points, (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,1/2), (0,1/2,1/2) and (1/2,0,1/2), were selected. In the case of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) our previous calculated band gaps49 of 1.63 (I), 2.10 (Br) and 2.60 eV (Cl) with a PBE functional were consistent with the experimental results and other results; meanwhile a HSE06 functional (2.20 eV, MAPbI3) overestimated the experimental values, ranging between 1.50–1.70 eV.6,37,50–55 Hence, the PBE functional can lead to accurate band gap calculations for Pb perovskite materials (MAPbX3) which is also confirmed by other studies. If we replace Pb by any other metal ion there is no guarantee that PBE calculations will determine more accurate band gaps. Therefore, in this study we applied a HSE06 functional56 to obtain more accurate band structures and the effective masses of proposed Pb-free perovskites. Spin orbit coupling may be important for Pb-containing perovskites,57,58 however, we ignored its effect since the relevant elements in the proposed materials, Ca, Ge, Sr and Sn, are relatively light.
 Fig. 1  (a) The super cell structure for MAPbI3 which has 8 Pb atoms at the centre (inside the green cage) of the iodide octahedra. The mixed Pb-free perovskite material’s crystal structure is given in the ESI (Fig. S1†). The A-site cation, MA (CH3NH3), is located at the centre of the corner sharing the octahedral Pb/I cage. (b) The simulated device structure is schematically shown including the bilayer junction. The material with a wider band gap is selected to be the top cell, and the one with a narrower band gap is exploited in the bottom cell. The same device structure is exploited for single layer device simulation. 
We calculated the optical properties (absorption coefficient and dielectric function) with the PBE functional and then applied the scissor operator43,59 to all of the listed materials to obtain the estimated optical absorption spectra from the HSE06 calculations. The use of the scissors correction was necessary because of the problem of band gap underestimation by the PBE functional.
The absorption coefficients of the studied Pb-free perovskites carry essential information that can be used to analyze the absorption of light for these materials. However, we also carried out device simulation in which Pb-free perovskites were used as the active layer in a structured device (Fig. 1(b)). The benefit of device simulation is that absorption efficiency can be obtained directly and may be of interest in future experiments. In addition, we considered a bilayer device which was built by different Pb-free perovskites with different band gaps. The bilayer device simulation was beyond the ability of our material calculations. The methods are described in ref. 60–62. In the modeled device, a 100 nm thick layer of glass was used; the second layer was indium doped tin oxide (ITO, 80 nm thick, as an anode). MACa0.5Ge0.5I3 and MASr0.5Sn0.5I3 (350 nm thickness) due to their larger band gaps served as a top cell; the others which had smaller band gaps (see Fig. 7) were used as a bottom cell (450 nm thick). Above the top cell we stacked a 10 nm thick PC60BM ((6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) layer which acted as an electron transport layer (ETL); while below the bottom cell 15 nm thick PCDTBT (poly(N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di(thien-2-yl)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole))) which acted as a hole transport layer (HTL) was stacked to obtain the excited carriers. The bottom layer was the Ag layer which had a thickness of 100 nm and worked as a cathode in this device.
III. Material properties
A. Stability of mixed Pb-free perovskites: Ca/Ge, Ca/Sn, Sr/Ge and Sr/Sn
The crystallographic stability of perovskites can be defined as the ability of a material existing in a perovskite phase to be suitable for PV performance within the limitations of temperature and pressure.28 Goldschmidt, in 1926 (ref. 26), introduced perovskite phase stability which was further modified by G. Kieslich et al. for organic–inorganic perovskites by introducing effective ionic radii instead of simple ionic radii.63,64 (1)where rA,eff and rX,eff are the effective ionic radii for cation A and anion X in the general formula ABX3. We have used the Shannon65 effective ionic radii for B-site cations (rB); while for halide I, an ionic radii of 220 pm was used. According to Goldschmidt, for a perovskite phase the tolerance factor must be in the range of 0.80 ≤ t ≤ 1.0. More specifically, Goldchmidt26 as well as Kieslich et al.63,64 explained that for a perfect cubic structure (which is highly stable) the tolerance factor must be in the range 0.89 ≤ t ≤ 1.0. If the A-site cation is large66 or too small67 then the lead halide octahedra will distort and tilt, which results in less symmetric tetragonal or orthorhombic perovskite phases. The tolerance factor (t) for these phases should be in the range 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 0.89.63,64 These phases almost have similar optoelectronic properties and are effectively used in perovskite solar cells, as somehow, small shifts occur in the band gap, carrier lifetime and mobility.68 If t ≤ 0.80, the material may not exist in a perovskite phase, while for t > 1.0, a hexagonal non-perovskite structure appears,63,64 neither of which are favorable for high absorption. It is noted that Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor (t) alone is not sufficient to accurately predict the perovskite structure, because it does not include the octahedral distortion and tilting of the structure. In fact, octahedral tilting occurs if the B-site cation does not fit well with the X6 octahedron and is the primary factor that causes structural distortions. Usually octahedral tilting has a much greater effect on lattice parameters. Moreover, the displacement of the A-site and the dynamic motions of the A-site and/or X-site need to be taken into account. Hence, an additional indicator is needed, called the octahedral factor (μ), defined by the ratio of . The range of the octahedral factor has been predicted to be within 0.377 ≤ μ ≤ 0.895.69
Enthalpy of formation is an important factor used to study the chemical stability (decomposition reaction) and thermodynamic stability of a material. Chemical stability can be reflected by the ability of a material to remain stable while reacting with external agents (heat, moisture and oxygen). MAPbI3 decomposes into MAI + PbI2;72 while for the present study we use the following decomposition relation (with Ca/Sn as an example), ΔH = E(MACa1−nSnnI3) − [E(MAI) + (1 − n)E(CaI2) + nE(I2) + nE(Sn)],(2)where n = 0.875, 0.625 and 0.5. According to eqn (2), a negative ΔH means heat loss (an exothermic reaction) during formation. A very negative ΔH means that the material is more energetically stable against decomposition.
From Table 1, it is clear that our calculated values for tolerance factor, formation enthalpy and octahedral tilting are in good agreement with the previous calculations for MAPbI3. Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the tolerance factor (t), the octahedral factor (μ), and the enthalpy of formation of all of our mixed perovskites in comparison to those of MAPbI3. MASr0.125Ge0.875I3, MACa0.125Ge0.875I3 and MACa0.375Ge0.625I3 have tolerance factors a little larger than 1, thus they show smaller octahedral factors. We suggest that there is little octahedral tilting in these perovskite materials, which makes them less symmetric. The basic reason for a higher t and smaller μ is the smaller ionic radii of Ca and Ge.

 Fig. 2  The tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (μ) (black square symbols) represent the perovskite phase stability for all of the predicted perovskite materials. The blue triangular symbols represent the calculated formation enthalpy per formula unit (ΔH/f.u.) for all of our materials studied in comparison to that of MAPbI3. The three mixed materials inside the brackets are not in the specified range of μ and t. 

Fig. 2 shows the calculated decomposition energies with respect to the possible decomposition of the predicted perovskites. In Fig. 2, it is observed that the calculated ΔH of all of our mixed perovskite materials is negative, confirming their thermodynamic stability. As compared to MAPbI3, which is marginally stable, we conclude that all of our predicted mixed perovskites are highly stable. Hence, we expect that they could be synthesized using their binary constituents. These large negative ΔH values are in good agreement with the previous B-site mixed cation study.74
Table S1† shows the lattice parameters for all of the mixed perovskites studied in comparison to those of MAPbI3 after successful relaxation of the supercell structure. The lattice constants for MAPbI3 are a = b = 12.70 Å and c = 12.95 Å with β = 89°, which indicates that there is a small distortion of the structure. In the case of Ca/Ge with a ratio of 0.125/0.875 the lattice constants decrease compared to those of MAPbI3. When the Ge (or Sn) ratio is decreased from 0.875 to 0.625 to 0.5 (or the Ca ratio increased from 0.125 to 0.375 to 0.5) the lattice constants start increasing with a decrease in the angle deviation from 90°. Essentially, this is due to the smaller ionic radii of Ge (73 pm). Similarly, a larger angle deviation is observed in MASr0.125Ge0.875I3. Other mixed alloys have less distortion in their structure due to their suitable ionic radii which are comparable to that of MAPbI3. In the case of MASr0.5Sn0.5I3 the increase in the lattice constants due to the larger ionic radii of Sr (118 pm) and Sn (115 pm) leads to a higher supercell volume. The deviation of the lattice parameters in our study was less than 2%. We may conclude that very little distortion (high symmetry) is observed in our newly predicted HOIPs.
B. Electronic properties of mixed Pb-free perovskites: Ca/Ge, Ca/Sn, Sr/Ge and Sr/Sn
In Fig. 3 we present the band gaps for all of our predicted Pb-free perovskites. The band gaps obtained from HSE06 calculations are in the range of 1.53–2.01 eV, which is feasible for top cells in tandem architecture. MACa0.125Ge0.875I3 (1.74 eV), MACa0.375(Ge/Sn)0.625I3 (1.87/1.80 eV), MACa0.5Sn0.5I3 (1.85 eV) and MASr0.125Ge0.875I3 (1.75 eV) are in the ideal range for top cells in tandem devices.
 Fig. 3  The band gap values calculated using the HSE06 functional for all of our predicted mixed Pb-free perovskite materials, MA(Ca/Ge)I3, MA(Ca/Sn)I3, MA(Sr/Ge)I3, and MA(Sr/Sn)I3 with ratios (12.5:87.5, 37.5:62.5 and 50:50), in comparison to that of MAPbI3. The light pink horizontal shaded region represents the ideal band gap range (1.7–1.9 eV) for top cells in tandem architecture. 

Fig. 4 shows the band structures of the Pb-free perovskites with ratios 0.125/0.875 and 0.5/0.5 determined using HSE06 calculations in comparison to that of MAPbI3; the band structures of the Pb-free perovskites with ratios 0.375/0.625 are presented in the ESI (Fig. S2†). As shown in Fig. 4, as the Ge or Sn ratio decreases from 0.875 to 0.5, the band gap increases by ∼0.2 eV (in the case of Ca/Ge), ∼0.32 eV (in the case of Ca/Sn), ∼0.37 eV (in the case of Sr/Ge) and ∼0.39 eV (in the case of Sr/Sn). Furthermore, we observed that the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) dispersion start to decrease when the Sn or Ge ratio is decreased from 0.875 to 0.5. Also, at the k-point in the momentum space there exists a direct transition from the VB to the CB which is absent for MAPbI3. In comparison to MAPbI3 all of our mixed Pb-free perovskite materials have strong VB dispersions, while the CB dispersions are almost the same. The same behaviour is also observed in the case of the ratio 0.375/0.625. For the PBE calculations the same observations for band structure are observed, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S2 and S3†).
 Fig. 4  The band structures for our explored Pb-free perovskites except 0.375:0.625 (presented in Fig. S2†) from HSE06 calculations in comparison to that of MAPbI3. 
Another important factor is the effective mass which is associated with the mobility of electrons and holes. We show the calculated effective masses of the proposed Pb-free perovskites in Table 2 in comparison to those of MAPbI3 and Si. It is noted that the calculated effective masses of MAPbI3 and Si are in good agreement with the previous results.44,75 Effective masses smaller than m0 lead to excellent mobility and are in high demand in the PV industry. Usually demonstrated in semiconducting materials, the CB dominated by a cationic p state gives a small electron effective mass.71 In MAPbI3 a p–p transition from the VB to the CB exists, and this is the reason for their highly dispersive VB and CB which can lead to low hole and electron effective masses.71 In all of our studied mixed Pb-free perovskites we also observed the p–p transition from the VB to the CB as shown in the PDOS plot in the ESI (Fig. S6†). All of our predicted perovskites have low effective masses. Hence, we expect that these new materials would have high mobility for carrier transport.

C. Absorption coefficients of mixed Pb-free perovskites: Ca/Ge, Ca/Sn, Sr/Ge and Sr/Sn
To determine the optical properties, we used a PBE functional accompanying the scissors correction to get as accurate an optical band gap as that of the HSE functional. Usually the optical band gap is underestimated in PBE calculations and overestimated for the dielectric properties.59 Based on the scissors correction, Fig. 5 shows the absorption coefficients for all of the studied Pb-free perovskites in comparison to that of MAPbI3.
 Fig. 5  The absorption coefficients calculated for MA(Ca/Ge)I3 (a), MA(Ca/Sn)I3 (b), MA(Sr/Ge)I3 (c) and MA(Sr/Sn)I3 (d). The absorption coefficient for MAPbI3 is shown in (a) for comparison. 
From Fig. 5, we observe two main features. Firstly, for up to 4 eV of photon energy, MAPbI3 displays a single peak in absorption coefficient. In contrast, all of the Pb-free perovskites exhibit multi-peak features in the absorption coefficient. One main peak is observed around 3.5 eV which is also the location of the main peak of MAPbI3. The satellite peaks appear in positions with lower energies. For MA(CaxGe1−x)I3 (x = 0.125 or 0.375), there is one satellite peak which appears at about 2.4 eV. With a larger ratio of Ca (0.5), this peak is split into two peaks. This multi-peak feature is probably due to the transitions which occur at X and K points in the first Brillouin zone. The conduction band at these points develops into a valley and moves to a lower energy. These valleys are absent in MAPbI3. Therefore this feature makes the proposed Pb-free perovskites good candidates for high PV performance. Secondly, the satellite peaks appear at lower energies due to the smaller band gaps in the Pb-free perovskites. In this case, these materials can absorb light with a longer wavelength. Thus the optical absorption ability of these materials is higher than that of their parental material, i.e. MAPbI3.
IV. Device properties
A. Single layer devices
In Fig. 6, we present the absorption efficiencies for all of the single layer devices. All of the devices made using Pb-free perovskites show a broader absorption window than that of MAPbI3. From 300 nm to 600 nm (denoted region I), all of the curves are very close to each other. Herein we analyze the situation for wavelengths from 600 nm to 900 nm (denoted region II). The absorption efficiency for MAPbI3 decreases dramatically, and tends to 20% at 900 nm. A weaker peak of the absorption efficiency (∼60%) appears at about 760 nm. For MA(Sr/Ge)I3 devices (Fig. 6(c)), the absorption efficiencies are slightly higher than that of MAPbI3. For MA(Ca/Ge)I3 devices, the absorption efficiencies are primarily larger and the MA(Ca0.5Ge0.5)I3 device exhibits the best performance. For Ca/Sn and Sr/Sn, MA(Ca0.125Sn0.875)I3 and MA(Sr0.125Sn0.875)I3 show the best performance. The absorption efficiencies remain above 80% up to 780 nm. Therefore, the predicted perovskites show potential applications in solar cells with high PV performance. The optical band gaps for all of our mixed perovskites show good consistency with the HSE06 calculated band gaps, as shown in Fig. 3. We also observed that in all of our mixed perovskites the absorption edge is as sharp as that of MAPbI3, confirming a direct transition from the VB to the CB. It is worth pointing out that 98% of the solar photons reaching the Earth’s surface are under 3.4 eV (according to the AM 1.5 solar spectrum) and the optical absorption for all of our predicted mixed perovskites is below 3.5 eV which is in the range of the near infra-red and visible region of the light spectrum, hence we expect a very strong power conversion efficiency for these materials.

B. Bilayer devices
We further calculated the absorption efficiencies for bilayer devices in which a few of the best Pb-free perovskites were selected from this study for the top and bottom layers (Fig. 7). For the top layer we selected two materials, MACa0.5Ge0.5I3 with a HSE06 band gap of 1.94 eV and MASr0.5Sn0.5I3 with a HSE06 band gap of 2.01 eV; while for the bottom layer three different materials with narrower band gaps were selected, MA(Ca/Ge)I3, MA(Ca/Sn)I3 and MA(Sr/Sn)I3 with the ratio 0.125/0.875 and band gaps (HSE06) of 1.74, 1.53 and 1.62 eV respectively. As the lattice parameters of the top and bottom layers are consistent with each other, the bilayer structure is suitable and the possible strain between different layers may be minimized. It is seen from Fig. 7 that the absorption window is almost extended up to 1100 nm which means more light can be absorbed in the device. For the MAPbI3 single layer solar cell, the absorption efficiency drops dramatically from 90% to 53% for wavelengths from 600 nm to 700 nm. For bilayer solar cells, it remains at a high level up to 700 nm, for example it remains almost 100% from 460 nm to 550 nm for the devices made of MA(Sr/Sn)I3. Between 700 nm to 1100 nm, it exhibits a multi-peak feature. However the absorption efficiencies are still above 50% and around 70%. All of the studied bilayer solar cells with different components show comparable performance. We may conclude that the bilayer solar cells based on the mixed Pb-free perovskites show great potential for realistic high performance applications.
 Fig. 7  The absorption efficiencies for bilayer devices. MACa0.5Ge0.5I3 (or MASr0.5Sn0.5I3) serves as a top layer. MACa0.125Ge0.875I3, MACa0.125Sn0.875I3, and MASr0.125Sn0.875I3 serve as the bottom layer. 
V. Conclusions
We investigated the incorporation of mixed Ca/(Ge, Sn) and Sr/(Ge, Sn) into the B-site cation site of MAPbI3 to replace Pb by using an ab initio method. This is the first attempt to study the mixing of group II and XIV to replace the toxic Pb component. Group II and XIV metals have stable divalent oxidation and are extensively studied in the B-site due to their unique properties. Band gap tuning has been observed while decreasing the ratio of Sn and Ge (or increasing the ratio of Ca or Sr), which tailors the material’s properties. For all of the studied mixed Pb-free perovskites (12 in total), the band gaps obtained using HSE06 calculations are in the range of 1.53–2.01 eV, which is an excellent range for perovskite solar absorbers. MACa0.125Ge0.875I3, MACa0.375Ge0.625I3, MASr0.125Ge0.875I3, MACa0.375Sn0.625I3 and MACa0.5Sn0.5I3 are found to be in the ideal band gap range (1.70–1.90 eV), and are ideal materials for the top cell in tandem architecture. The band gaps for MACa0.125Sn0.875I3 and MASr0.125Sn0.875I3 are suitable for single junction solar cells (1.3–1.7 eV). We find that all of our mixed perovskites show good structural and thermodynamic stability compared to that of MAPbI3. Due to the excellent results for the effective masses, we could expect higher mobility for all of our mixed perovskites. We studied the device absorption efficiencies for single-layer and bilayer solar cells made of the studied Pb-free perovskites. They show strong absorption and a broad absorption spectrum, which make them great potential candidates for future applications. We expect that this study will open a new avenue to further explore many other mixed Pb-free perovskites from the stable divalent species of the periodic table.
