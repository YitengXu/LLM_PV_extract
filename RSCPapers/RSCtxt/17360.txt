    , Accepted 16th March 2023First published on 20th March 2023AbstractOver the past decades, the utilization of Li-ion batteries has provided the benefits of high energy and power density and can be used in a variety of applications, including electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage, and the power grid. Yet, to meet the requirements for a more carbon-neutral society, the fast development of LIBs with lower cost, even higher energy density and power density, and greater safety on charging–discharging is expected. Recently, cation-disordered rock-salt (DRX) has attracted great attention since it can deliver a large capacity to surpass the capacity bottleneck of the current layered structure materials. However, promising cathode materials are now facing many challenges including fast capacity fading, intricate material synthesis, as well as the complex charge storage mechanism, which hinder their further applications. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent process of DRX materials is provided based on the compositional structure, lithium storage mechanism, electrochemical behaviour, and modification strategies. The remaining problems are also discussed from the perspective of paving the way for material design. We hope that this review can provide some insight into DRX cathode materials and inspire the fast development of Li-ion batteries.
1 Introduction
The utilization of renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and tide, provides effective ways for sustainable development in modern society.1–3 Among those techniques, electrochemical energy storage, represented by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), is one of the key factors for achieving the requirements towards a more carbon-neutral society.4 Over the past decades, the practical use of LIBs for portable applications as well as in hybrid and electric vehicles has increased rapidly based on their stability, excellent electrochemical performance, and being environmentally benign.5,6 Yet, the ever-growing demand for large-scale energy storage especially power grid, aviation, and marine transportation inspired the fast development of LIBs with lower cost, even higher energy density and power density, and greater safety upon charging–discharging. To overcome these hurdles, novel cathode materials that can host lithium in its crystal structure are needed.7
Nowadays, the commercially used LIBs cathode materials are mainly based on transition metal (TM) compounds, which could build up the crystal structure for reversible lithium intercalation. The original lithium storage prototype, TiS2, was proposed by Whittingham in 1976 and can be deeply charged and discharged 1000 times with an irreversible capacity of no more than 0.05% per cycle, and many researchers have continued to study lithium–sulfur batteries in depth until now (Fig. 1a).8,9 Based on this intercalation model, the replacement of sulfide by oxides exhibited higher energy density and quickly became the favourite in the battery community. In 1980, Goodenough and co-workers reported LiCoO2 as a new compound for cathode material, which was commercialized by Sony company in 1991 and achieved great success worldwide.10 This layered structure has an ordered arrangement of Li and TM that could provide a feasible pathway for Li-ions upon charging and discharging (Fig. 1b). The upgrade of commercial cathode materials has been based on the lithium diffusion/intercalation model since then. For example, the most prevalent cathodes used nowadays, lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (NCAs) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMCs), can be viewed as the doping of LiCoO2 where lithium could diffuse in the alkali layer with a two-dimensional pathway upon cycling.10 The spinal LiMn2O4, which is also displayed as the layered structure, could offer a three-dimensional pathway for the lithium-ion (Fig. 1b).11 Yet, the low energy density of LiMn2O4 made it insufficient for the current EV requirement. LiFePO4, despite its exhibiting the olivine structure and not the layered structure (Fig. 2b), has a clear one-dimensional lithium diffusion pathway.12 The commercialized cathode materials mentioned above transport lithium solely through the TM redox process. To alleviate the difference between supply and demand, a higher energy density is expected. During the past decades, anionic redox chemistry was proposed in the LIBs, which introduced Li in the TM layered to activate O redox by the Li–O–Li configuration.13,14 Nevertheless, the lithium retained diffusion behaviour upon cycling for the Li-excess compound (Fig. 1c). To surpass the capacity bottleneck of the current layered structured materials, novel DRX cathode materials have been reported recently, which have attracted great attention as they can deliver a large capacity, over 300 mA h g−1 (larger than 1000 W h kg−1) (Fig. 1d).15 For decades, the traditional rock-salt structure was viewed as electrochemically inactive, which could not transport lithium during the electrochemical process; theoretical studies and experimental results in recent years disclosed that with an excess of lithium, the DRX material is capable of lithium transport and delivered a large capacity far beyond the currently used commercial cathode materials. In 2014, Lee et al. successfully synthesized more than the stoichiometric Li-excess DRX material, which revealed that ion transport in the disordered Li-excess cathode materials is achieved by some specific form of permeation, making it possible to design disordered electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density.16

Despite the lithium-ion percolation pattern bringing novel insight into material design, especially for the DRX materials, the intricate charge storage mechanism and the irreversible capacity loss hinder their wide application. Significant further development is required before they can be largely applied in commercial LIBs. Herein, we have systematically summarized the progress of DRX materials in recent years, including materials synthesis, electrochemical performance, lithium storage mechanism and the modification strategy. The fundamental explanation of the DRX structure and the lithium percolation pattern are also included in the review to provide a better understanding of DRX materials design. This review is arranged according to the different TMs to give a clear view of the research progress. We hope this will clarify the lithium storage mechanism in DRX, and provide sufficient examples underlying the relationship between material synthesis and the electrochemical properties, which could inspire new perspectives on DRX materials for future development.
2 Structure of DRX and Li-ion transport mechanism
2.1 Structure of DRX
The phenomenon of Li and M metals occupying each other's respective sites in a layered or spinel (LMO) structure is called cation disorder. Many lithium transition metal oxide (LiMO2) compounds crystallize in different rock-salt-type crystal structures. Fig. 2a and b show two kinds of cation-ordered NaCl structures, namely, the γ-LiFeO2 structure and LiCoO2 with low-temperature spinel structure, respectively. Layered and DRX structures of LiMO2 crystallize in two different rock-salt-type structures, with anions and cations occupying two octahedral sites (Oh) in an interpenetrating face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice. The orderly arrangement of Li and M in alternating planes along the (111) direction of the layered oxides leads to the structure of α-NaFeO2 as shown in Fig. 2c. Theoretically, Li and M are randomly arranged in the DRX compound, forming the α-LiFeO2 structure shown in Fig. 2d. The optical, magnetic, and electronic properties of LiMO2 materials depend on the type of Li–M bond formed,17 which in turn depends on the electronic configuration and size of the M3+ cation in the material. When the M3+ radius is significantly smaller than the Li+ radius (r(Li+) = 0.76 Å), α-NaFeO2 structures are formed, such as LiCoO2 (r(Co3+) = 0.545 Å),18 LiVO2 (r(V3+) = 0.64 Å),19 LiNiO2 (r(Ni3+) = 0.56 Å),20 and LiCrO2 (r(Cr3+) = 0.615 Å).21 This structure type allows the bond lengths of LiO6 and MO6 octahedrons to be independently relaxation. The ordered γ-LiFeO2 structure is formed when all the cations are of similar radius size, e.g., LiScO2 (r(Sc3+) = 0.745 Å), the chirality effect of this type of structure is not obvious.22,23 The DRX structure is only the high-energy state of other structure types at high temperature, not the ground state, so the cationic disordered generation of the structure needs to be achieved by high temperature or lower disorder energy. Some special cases also exist for other types of structures.23,24
DRX oxides can be composed of cations with large ionic radii and charge differences, such as Li+/Mo6+, Li+/Nb5+, and Li+/Ti4+, suggesting that disorder is driven by factors other than the ionic size of rock salt-type materials.25,26 Hewston and Chamberland first constructed the LiMO2 structure based on the size of the ratio of the M3+ and Li+ ionic radii, which was later rationalized through modelling by Wu et al.17,27–29 Although many metal–metal combinations can form layered structures when large amounts of Li+ are removed from the compound during charging, many metal ions migrate into the vacancies created in the Li layer, and only a very small number of materials maintain the layered structure. In contrast, the use of cationic disorder for the preparation of functional cathode materials makes it possible to use a larger range of transition metal species and different combinations.
2.2 Li-ion transport mechanism
Ceder et al. summarized the structural model of Li+ diffusion in structural materials of rock-salt-type LMOs (M = Mn, Fe, Ni, Nb…).30 The diffusion of Li+ between two ortho-octahedral (o) sites occurs through an intermediate tetrahedral (t) site, referred to as o-t-o diffusion below.31 The size of the Td site and the electrostatic interaction between the four cations in face-sharing octahedral and Li+ at the activated Td site create tetrahedral clusters (Fig. 3). The tetrahedral cluster significantly impacts the Li+ diffusion barrier. Theoretically, Li4, Li3M, Li2M2, Li3M, and M4 forms of tetrahedral clusters can be formed when the sites of the cation lattice are filled with Li+ and M.32,33 Li+ can be ruled out as a channel for Li+ diffusion through LiM3 and M4 clusters because o-t-o diffusion of Li+ requires at least two Oh Li+ connected by activated Td sites. The other two coplanar Oh sites, also known as “gate sites”, control the channel for Li+ diffusion and determine whether it is open (low migration potential) or closed (high migration potential).34

2.2.1 Li+ mobility of DRX. 
Ceder's group reported the mode of Li+ migration in layered transition metal oxides and DRX structures.30 LiM3 clusters (3-TM channels) in the transition metal slabs are not involved in Li+ diffusion, and Li3M (1-TM channels) clusters in the Li slabs enable Li migration, forming as a result of cation ordering in stoichiometric layered LiMnO2 and Li-excess Li1+xM1−xO2 (Fig. 3a). The layer spacing of the Li slab determines the size of the activated Td site. The o-t-o Li+ diffusion in layered LixMO2 compounds proceeds through the Li divacancy mechanism and depends on 1-TM channels (Fig. 3b).
In the DRX structure, the Li+ mobilities are expected to be negligible if only the 1-TM diffusion mechanism (just as typical layered oxide) is disordered. The disorder would lead to poor diffusion of Li+ through the 1-TM channel but at the same time, an active 0-TM channel (Li4 cluster) would be formed (Fig. 3c). The diffusion of Li+ in compounds with DRX structure is mainly through the 0-TM channel, and the diffusion barrier is almost independent of tetrahedral height and transition metal components.34 The disordered structure of DRX causes diffusion of the 1-TM channel to deteriorate, and an active 0-TM channel is formed. By constructing a model to compare the migration barrier for diffusion through the 0-TM and 1-TM channels with Li2MoO3 and LiCrO2 in Fig. 3d, it was found that even for a small tetrahedral height (2.35 Å), the 0-TM migration barrier does not exceed 300 meV, while the migration barrier of 1-TM exceeds 500 meV (Fig. 3d).16,35 Upon charging, the energy of the 0-TM Td site gradually decreases when Li+ is extracted from the nearest octahedral position, and Li+ at the Td site will stabilize when Li+ is extracted from all the co-octahedral positions. Therefore, the formation of the Td site of Li has little effect on the overall Li+ diffusion rate. The presence of 0-TM channels is necessary, and in cases where anionic redox can be limited, 0-TM is formed through Li excess, and the higher the Li content, the greater the capacity. Due to cationic disorder and lithium content only through the 0-TM channel, Li seepage is affected. Therefore, the number of Li4 clusters will increase with the increase of Li content, and when the lithium content reaches a critical concentration, a percolation channel of 0-TM will be formed. The critical concentration of Li in different cathode materials is discussed later. Compared with traditional layered oxides, which often accumulate faults, dislocations, and structural collapse under high pressure, the three-dimensional diffusion percolation channel of DRX constructed from 0-TM channels can make the main structure more stable because the random cation distribution eliminates the change in interlayer spacing. The energy cost of all M3+O6 octahedral aberration modes in the LiMO2 compound was evaluated. It was concluded that elements without d electrons could accommodate octahedral changes at the lowest energy cost. Perhaps, not surprisingly, the band energies of d0 metals depend only on the lower oxygen-dominated orbitals, which are always occupied and largely insensitive to positional aberrations. Thus, transition metals without valence d electrons can best stabilize the disordered rock salt phase even with large ionic radius differences between cationic species. The d0 elements are usually the key elements to create electric dipole compositions due to their ability to cause low energy cost from the centre of the octahedron. The natural abundance and metal prices of selected transition metal species in DRX compounds reported to date are shown in Fig. 3e, where it is seen that rock salt cathodes based on Earth's abundant manganese, iron and titanium are promising in terms of sustainability and cost.30–34 In summary, we have found that the Li+ diffusion mechanism in DRX cathode materials can help us understand the migration path of cations and its effect on the chemical properties of layered LixMO2 compounds.


2.2.2 Percolation of Li+ in DRX (long-range diffusion of Li+). 
The possibility of a single Li+ jumping between adjacent Oh sites is determined by the o-t-o migration barrier. Within the layered LiMO2 structure, all Li+ sites are connected by 1-TM channels with low Li+ migration barriers, eventually forming two-dimensional channels. For DRX materials, the macroscopic Li+ diffusion channels are not obvious and it is not clear when the percolation channels are formed.16,34 If a percolation diffusion network can be formed, multiple high-energy jumps may be required for Li+ to be extracted from the structure. Long-range Li+ diffusion requires the microscopic interconnection of diffusion channels into an interoperable percolation network throughout the structure. Whether the Li+ percolation is possible within a given rock-salt-type structure depends not only on the distribution of Li4, Li3M, Li2M2, Li3M, and M4 tetrahedral clusters but also on the connectivity of the open (low-energy Li+ migration barrier) diffusion channels. The research by Ceder et al. proved that the formation of percolation conditions is related to Li content as well as the cation mixing degree.38 Theoretical calculation disclosed that for the layered structure and γ-LiFeO2 structure, excess lithium is required; yet, for the spinel structure, even the deficiency of lithium can support the formation of the percolation conditions. On the other hand, the cation mixing degree also influences the percolation formation. For the spinel structure, the high lithium accessibility was achieved with the decrease of the mixing degree, whereas for the γ-LiFeO2 the increase in the cation mixing will increase the lithium accessibility, leading to the improvement of the percolation formation. This is further discussed below.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, Urban et al. investigated the effects of cation disorder and Li+ content on Li+ percolation through 0-TM channels in the LixM2−xO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) structure.34 The results show that the number of Li4 clusters increases when Li+ content is increasing, and a percolation network of 0-TM channels is formed at different critical Li+ concentrations based on the different materials (Fig. 3c). It was found that spinel structures have the best 0-TM percolation performance with lower critical Li+ concentrations for percolation. For layered structures, the critical Li+ concentration for 0-TM percolation is maximum in the ordered structures. Even for completely disordered structures, rock-salt LMOs can sustain long-range 0-TM Li+ percolation as long as Li+/M > 1. However, it is important to maintain a relatively low Li excess because the value of the Li/M ratio will affect the redox ability of transition metal ions. Besides, in reality, these percolation thresholds are likely to be overestimated with which percolation is also possible in the 1-TM channel when the tetrahedral height is high enough.

3 Material synthesis and structure studies of DRX cathodes
3.1 Material design principle

3.1.1 The role of d0 elements in DRX synthesis. 
Urban et al. and Richards et al. investigated the effects of element pairing of various LMO compounds on DRX synthesis by first-principles calculations, respectively, and identified that Ti-containing oxides were potential DRX candidates due to their low disordering energies. Both cation-disordered LiTiO2 and a large amount of Ti4+-containing oxides have been successfully synthesized and electrochemically tested for Li-ion batteries.17,35–37 For example Li2−xVTiO2, has a reversible capacity of >300 mA h g−1.38 In the expansion to a broader study of methods and strategies for achieving disordered arrangements of stable cations, Urban et al. found that DRX oxides consist of cations with large ionic radii and charge differences, such as Li+/Mo6+, Li+/Nb5+, Li+/Ti4+, suggesting that disorder is driven by factors other than the ionic size of rock-salt-type materials.35
Urban et al. reported that the d-level orbital occupancy in transition metals regulates their capacity to accommodate disorder.39 The varied sizes and valences of the cations produce octahedral distortions when they are randomly arranged over the Oh sites of a rock-salt structure. Therefore, their distortions must be partially compensated by nearby octahedra, and the energy required to deform the octahedra around the different cations is reflected in a structure's capacity for cation disorder. Urban et al. evaluated the band energy of d0 metals using density functional theory (DFT), which is mainly resistant to site distortions and solely depends on lower-lying, oxygen-dominated orbitals that are always occupied.35 Therefore, even when the ionic radius differences between the cation species are quite substantial, transition metals with d0 metals are the ones that can maintain disordered rock-salt phases the best.


3.1.2 The effects of lithium content on percolation in DRX cathodes. 
Using Monte Carlo simulations, Urban et al. investigated the effects of cation disorder and Li+ content on Li+ percolation through 0-TM channels in the LixM2−xO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) structure.33 The results show that the number of Li4 clusters increases when Li+ content is increasing, and the percolation network of 0-TM channels is formed at different critical Li+ concentrations based on the different materials (Fig. 4a). For layered structures, the critical Li+ concentration for 0-TM percolation is maximum in the ordered structures (Fig. 4b). It was found that spinel structures have the best 0-TM percolation performance with lower critical Li+ concentrations for percolation (Fig. 4c). For completely disordered structures, rock-salt LMOs can sustain long-range 0-TM Li+ percolation as long as Li+/M > 1 (Fig. 4d). However, it is important to maintain a relatively low Li excess because the value of the Li/M ratio will affect the redox ability of transition metal ions. Besides, in reality, these percolation thresholds are likely to be overestimated, with which percolation is also possible in the 1-TM channel when the tetrahedral height is high enough.
 Fig. 4  (a) Critical lithium concentrations (xc) for 0-TM Li percolation, and (b–d) for one Li per formula unit (1 Li per f.u.) to be accessible via 0-TM channels as a function of the overall lithium content and the degree of cation mixing in LixM2−xO2 compounds with the layered (a-NaFeO2), spinel-like (LT-LiCoO2) and γ-LiFeO2 structures. Reproduced with permission. Ref. 27 Copyright 2014, Wiley-VCH. 
Urban et al. showed that rock-salt-type LMOs could sustain long-term 0-TM Li+ diffusion even in the limit of complete disorder, as long as Li excess is present (Li/M > 1).33 Li percolation requires only 10% Li excess and approximately 26% Li per f.u. to extract 1 Li excess. It is important to maintain relatively low levels of Li excess in these materials since too-high Li/M ratios lead to limited transition metal redox capacity, negatively affecting the energy density of the cathode and the overall reversibility of the charge compensation mechanism in the cycle.36 Although the reported results describe Li+ diffusion supporting 0-TM channels, in reality, Li+ migration may occasionally involve 1-TM channels with tetrahedral heights that are large enough (2-TM channels have high migration barriers and never participate in macroscopic Li+ diffusion), so the permeation thresholds in Fig. 4 may be overestimated.

3.2 Electrochemical survey of DRX cathodes

3.2.1 DRX of Mn redox-based oxides. 
As transition metal elements with abundant reserves and good redox activity, Mn-based oxides are sustainable and ideal DRX cathode redox active materials. Freire et al. synthesized nanostructured Li4Mn2O5 by a mechanochemical method using orthogonal structured o-LiMnO2 and Li2O as precursors mixed with 5% wt.40 of carbon black. The nanostructured DRX Li4Mn2O5 was investigated as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries, and the results indicated that the DRX Li4Mn2O5 has an excellent initial charging capacity of 355 mA h g−1 and discharge capacity of 287 mA h g−1.41 The composite coating with Li2O can increase the reversible capacity of the first cycle by about 30%.42 Hu et al. used solid-state NMR spectroscopy to resolve multiple local environments in Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 and investigated their electronic properties using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.43 EPR showed that the formation of (O2)n− species and electron holes in oxygen at high pressures with voltage hysteresis is due to the difficulty in reducing the stable O. Fig. 5a represents the cubic rock salt structure (Fmm) of the prepared sample without visible impurities and gives the lattice parameter of 4.143 Å. The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 5b. Each cation (Li+, Ti4+, or Mn3+) is directly bound to six O anions. Fig. 5c shows the voltages of LTMO cycled between 1.5 and 4.8 V with charge and discharge capacities of 358 and 251 mA h g−1, respectively, with a low coulombic efficiency of 70.1%. The theoretical Mn3+/4+ redox limit is 131.6 mA h g−1, which is marked as a vertical dashed line. The voltage charge before this limit is related to the oxidation of Mn3+ while oxygen oxidation above this limit shows an increase in voltage. There is no voltage plateau seen on the discharge curve.44

In 2018, Chen et al. reported an excellent DRX material, Li1.3Nb0.3Mn0.43+O2, where the Li1.3Nb0.3Mn0.43+O2 cathode material revealed a high initial charging capacity of about 300 mA h g−1 and excellent energy density of 950 W h kg−1 within the 1.5–4.8 V range (Fig. 5d–f).42 Half of the capacity is derived from the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox reaction and the other half comes from the charge compensation of O redox. Because of the presence of the irreversible O redox reaction, the capacity drops off fast. Based on the above, regarding how to improve the long-cycle stability of Mn-based materials, the common methods available are summarized, such as the reduction of Li content and fluorination within the corresponding materials.44,45 In addition, transition metal elements, such as Nb, Ti and Zr doping have also been tried to improve the related stability.30 It is worth noting that Ti doping is relatively more favourable than Zr doping in Li-rich Mn-based cathodes due to Ti doping having a more favourable effect on the SRO, which leads to better Li+ percolation.42,46


3.2.2 Fe redox-based compounds. 
Since Fe is similar to Mn, it has also been used as an active transition metal element to provide charge compensation during the electrochemical process in recent years. Li+ and Fe3+ are randomly arranged on the cation lattice, and the percolation of Li+ can be improved by refining the grains or increasing the excess lithium content. Glazier et al. observed that increasing the Li and Ti content in Li(1+x)Ti2xFe(1−3x)O2 resulted in a tendency for primary particles (about 1 μm in size) to aggregate into larger secondary particles.67 Glazier et al. also found that Li–Fe–Ti oxides revealed low toxicity and contained only 3d transition metal species, but so far it is still difficult to obtain high reversible capacities from Fe-containing materials.67 Starting from a nearly completely disordered cation arrangement at x = 0, Shen et al. reported that the degree of cation ordering increases with x by comparing the C/3a lattice parameter ratio with that expected for a completely disordered cationic rock-salt structure (Fig. 6a).48 Cation-disordered Li–TM oxides, Li+ and other cations are randomly distributed in cationic octahedral sites in a cubic compact structure, and Li+ diffusion proceeds to adjacent octahedral sites through the intermediate tetrahedra, as shown in Fig. 6b. This property suggests that TM ions can be maintained in cationic sublattice sites during lithium extraction and maintain a disordered rock-salt framework. Fig. 6c shows the cycling performance and coulombic efficiency of the Li–Fe–Ti oxide cathode. The Li-excess cathode has a low coulombic efficiency, indicating a partially irreversible reaction between charge and discharge.48

Liu et al. designed a novel lithium-excess layer structure Li1.2Mo0.6Fe0.2O2 that transformed the layered material into a rock-salt structure in the first few charge/discharge cycles.49 The diffraction peaks of the prepared LMFO between 5° and 120° can be obtained as ordered α-NaFeO2 structures in the Rm space group (Fig. 6d). The random arrangement of Li and TM ions at the 3b position in the Li–TM layer can be achieved as shown in Fig. 6e. Fig. 6f shows the electrochemical profile of the cell during the first three cycles, and Fig. 6g shows the capacity retention achieved over 100 cycles (from the 5th cycle to the 105th cycle). From an application point of view, the high potential retention facilitates the management of the cell, since the conversion can be easily accomplished during the modelling process before the cell is transported. Therefore, this strategy is interesting and may have commercial applications in material design.49


3.2.3 Nb-containing compounds. 
In the study of Nb-containing DRX materials, Yabuuchi et al. studied the differences in Li1.3Nb0.3(Fe/Mn/Ni)0.43+O2 based on the Nb5+ system and observed that the capacity of all three materials was relatively low at room temperature (50–150 mA h g−1).50 However, after mixing with carbon black for mechanical ball milling, the capacity of the materials increased significantly (250–300 mA h g−1).50 Subsequently, in a more detailed study, it was found that the redox of Mn occurred at low potentials, but the reversible O redox occurred at voltages up to 4.8 V. It was demonstrated that the reversibility based on O charge compensation is highly dependent on the nature of the redox-active 3d transition metal element and that the reversibility of O redox in Nb5+-containing DRX materials is greatly enhanced by the weak covalent Mn4+–O bond and the stabilization of isolated O in the material by Li+ and Nb5+. In the same way, Yabuuchi et al. also analysed the Fe-containing system and found that the oxidation of O was accompanied by irreversible O loss, which the authors attributed to the high covalency of the Fe4+–O bond, resulting in the charge transfer from O to Fe via a reductive coupling mechanism (RCM).50 Then, at the end of charging, Fe3+ and unstable superoxides were formed. The high stability of the Mn-containing system is due to the high stability of Mn4+ under normal conditions without excessive oxidation like Fe4+.50
Ceder et al. reported a DRX material containing excess lithium, Li1.25Nb0.25Mn0.5O2.52 The samples were obtained after initial combustion and subsequent ball milling and were characterized by XRD and SEM. Fig. 7a shows the XRD pattern of the material after ball milling with carbon black, showing the characteristic peaks of disordered rock salt without impurity phases. The SEM image in Fig. 7b shows a particle size slightly smaller than 100 nm. The charge/discharge curves of LNMO at 55 °C and room temperature are shown in Fig. 7c and d, respectively. Theoretically, LNMO provides 146 mA h g−1 based on the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox reaction and 366 mA h g−1 based on the lithium content. The initial charge capacity of both cells shown in Fig. 7b–d is higher than 300 mA h g−1, and almost all of the lithium is extracted at 55 °C. During discharge, the cells cycled at 55 °C delivered a capacity of 287 mA h g−1 and an energy density of 909 W h kg−1, compared with 197 mA h g−1 and 627 W h kg−1, respectively, at room temperature. This difference may be due to the increase in lithium diffusivity at 55 °C. The voltage distribution is somewhat different between the first cycle and subsequent cycles, which may be the result of some local structural changes (e.g., cation rearrangement). The cycling performance shown in Fig. 7c indicates that the capacity of the sample was about 200 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at 55 °C, corresponding to an energy density of 601 W h kg−1. Both Mn and O reversibly contribute to the charge compensation process, while oxygen provides almost half of the capacity. Combined with the study of Li-ion transport in Li-excess disordered materials, this is an important new direction for creating high-capacity cathode materials.

In 2018, Fu et al. prepared the DRX cathode material binary system x Li3NbO4-(1 − x) LiCrO2 (x = 0.43); the sample was mechanically milled and provided a highly reversible capacity of 362 mA h g−1, which was derived from the highly reversible Cr3+/Cr6+ with electrochemical redox reaction niobium ions.53 Similar to Li2MnO3, the crystal structure of Li3NbO4 was also classified as a cation-ordered rock-salt superstructure (Fig. 7a). Fu et al. found that the high-capacity cathode material Li1.3Nb0.3Cr0.4O2 could not be synthesized by conventional calcination.53 Phase separation of Li3NbO4 and LiCrO2 is expected to have a narrow solid solution range in this binary system. Li1.3Nb0.3Cr0.4O2 was not identified as a thermodynamically stable phase. Therefore, an alternative route was chosen to synthesize the sub-stable phase and mechanical milling was chosen. Fig. 7e shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples before and after mechanical milling. The crystal structure of Li3NbO4, which is similar to Li2MnO3, is classified as an ordered superstructure material (Fig. 7f). The XAS spectra of K-edge Cr and Nb under different oxidation/reduction conditions of Li1.3Nb0.3Cr0.4O2 were obtained to elucidate the redox species during the oxidation/reduction process (Fig. 7g).53 The results demonstrated that the significant leading-edge peaks that appear during charging are strong evidence for Cr6+ formation and migration of Cr6+ to tetrahedral positions. The Nb ion is stabilized in the pentavalent state and is not reduced in the discharge process, indicating that the Nb ion is not responsible for the large discharge capacity of Li1.3Nb0.3Cr0.4O2 as the redox centre. These findings will contribute to the development of Li-excess cathode materials that provide high-density positive cationic disordered lithium for rechargeable lithium batteries in the future. Although Nb often plays an inactive role in the design of DRX cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, Nb can be selected as an active element in the design of cathode materials and may be accompanied by multi-electron transfer (Nb3+/Nb5+), providing great capacity.54


3.2.4 Ni redox-based compounds. 
The majority of DRX system materials reported to date require nickel as the redox-active transition metal element, such as Ni2+–Ti–Mo,55 Ni2+–Ti,56 Ni2+–Nb,57 Ni2+–Ti–Nb,58,59 and other compounds.60,61 DRX cathodes containing low valent Ni2+ can be synthesized in the air, while an inert atmosphere is required to synthesize DRX cathodes containing Mn3+, V3+, Cr3+, and Co2+. The difference in synthesis conditions is likely due to the high Ni2+/Ni4+ redox potential, which results in Ni2+ being in a stable oxidation state in the air even at the high temperatures required for synthesis. The voltage distribution of DRX cathode materials based on Ni redox typically exhibits a higher average voltage and a higher tilt slope compared to DRX cathodes containing other redox metals. Many experimental studies have shown that in fluorinated Ni-based DRX compounds, Ni2+ can only be oxidized to Ni3+ if charged to 4.6 V.55,58,60 This is different from layered cathode materials where Ni2+ can be oxidized to Ni4+. This is because in DRX materials the overlap of Ni eg orbitals with Li–O–Li as-hybridized orbitals leads to Ni2+, which cannot be completely oxidized. Ni oxidation and O oxidation will compete, and so Ni cannot be completely oxidized when charging. Ni redox-based DRX materials will release more CO2 and O2 during the cycling process, resulting in the densification of the material surface and significant changes in the discharge curve.
It is common to have these problems for Ni-based DRX materials. The current solution is often to modify the surface of the fluorination to reduce the irreversible oxygen release and reduce the discharge polarization. Ceder et al. identified a specific electronic structure effect that contributes to the stabilization of cation disorder in lithium-transition metal oxides with a large cation size difference.39Fig. 8a depicts the number of atomic conformations for both oxides in the 100 m eV cation energy range above the ground state. As shown in Fig. 8a, the number of conformations in this energy interval is much larger for LiNi0.5Ti0.5O2 (136 conformations) than that for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (57 confirmations). This implies that more atomic sequences are thermally accessible under synthetic conditions for titanium-containing compositions. The origin of this very different energetic behaviour becomes apparent when TM position distortions are considered. Fig. 8b and c show the TM displacement distortions for the 50 most stable conformations of the two materials. As shown in Fig. 8b, the d0 Ti4+ cations accommodate large site distortions, keeping the Ni2+ sites close to their preferred geometry. Since d0 cations are less sensitive to positional distortions, the energies of these 50 configurations are within 40 meV relative to the calculated ground state. Strong transition metal site distortions occur when these compositional disorders generate significant second-order energy contributions. Thus, d6 transition metals are very unstable in the cationic disordered phase, while d0 transition metals can sustain this deformation at a very low energy cost.

In 2022, Lu et al. investigated the disorder of Li/Ni, which exhibited different microscopic features at different calcination temperatures. These microstructural features have a significant impact on their electrochemical performances and the corresponding information has been summarized in detail.62 As shown in Fig. 8d–g, the as-prepared LiNi0.85Mn0.15O2 samples were determined and their structures and differences were compared using the HEXRD method. The characteristic Bragg peak can well reflect the layered hexagonal structure of α-NaFeO2 with an Rm space group. Fig. 8h–k show the electrostatic flow charge/discharge curves of NM85 samples within the voltage window of 2.8–4.5 V. At 0.1C (1C = 200 mA g−1), the initial discharge capacity of the LiNi0.85Mn0.15O2 sample was 186 mA h g−1 at 800 °C, 210 mA h g−1 at 850 °C, and 194 mA h g−1 at 900 °C. These findings contribute to the understanding of the properties of Co-free layered materials and facilitate targeted improvements for new materials.


3.2.5 V redox-based compounds. 
Delmas et al. successfully synthesized many species of V-based DRX oxides and their properties were tested since the early studying of ω-Li3V2O5 in the addition of lithium hydroxide.78 The irreversible phase transition that occurs in V-based DRX oxides, was identified in the initial discharge curves, which may be caused by the easy positional interchange of Li+ and V5+ between the cation sites. The Li2VO3 cathode provides a reversible capacity of about 253 mA h g−1 and exhibits a smooth electrochemical profile when cycled between 1–3 V.63 In 2017, Yabuuchi et al.64 systematically investigated the binary system of Li3NbO4–LiVO2 as a high-capacity electrode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. XRD patterns of the binary system of x Li3NbO4-(1 − x) LiVO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are shown in Fig. 9a and b. Among the samples found in this binary system, Li1.25Nb0.25V0.5O2 provided a reversible capacity of more than 240 mA h g−1 with good capacity retention (in Fig. 9c). In situ XRD and XAS measurements revealed a small volume change during the electrochemical cycle based on a highly reversible two-electron redox of V3+/V5+, probably due to the reversible migration of V from octahedra to face-shared tetrahedra. The heat treatment of the sample significantly improved the rate capability of the electrode material (Fig. 9c and d). In 2019, Fichtner et al. demonstrated a successful method for improving the cycle stability of lithium-excess vanadium-based DRX cathode by stabilizing the structure with Ti3+ or Fe3+.56 Two new disordered rock-salt compounds, Li2V0.5Fe0.5O2F and Li2V0.5Ti0.5O2F, were successfully synthesized by the mechanochemical ball milling technique in Fig. 9e. The materials were characterized by simultaneous ray diffraction and their crystal structures were extensively analysed by resonance imaging and transmission electron microscopy. A special quasi-random structure approach in density generalized theory calculations was used to reveal the distribution of oxidation states of transition metals in this structure. The theoretical model further predicted the improved structural stability of the disordered rock salts Li2V0.5Fe0.5O2F and Li2V0.5Ti0.5O2F. The stabilizing effect on the structure was further demonstrated by a significant improvement in cycling stability over 50 cycles (Fig. 9f and g).

4 Charge compensation mechanism of DRX
4.1 Cation redox process
DRX cathodes are quite different from the traditional layered cathode materials in terms of composition, and the compositions of DRX electrode material families are different. The DRX materials reported so far are either oxides or oxyfluorides. Similar to the conventional cathode materials of LIB, TM redox provides a large charge storage capacity within DRX materials. The chemical formula is usually written as Li1+x(MM′)1−xO2−yFy (x > 0 and y ≥ 0), in which M represents the redox-active transition metal and M′ represents the transition metal of the non-redox-active d0. Both M and M′ can be a single TM or a multitude of TMs. Typical examples of redox-active M include TMs of Mn, Ni, V, Cr, and Fe, utilizing Mn3+/2+/Mn4+, Ni2+/Ni4+, V3+/4+/V5+, Cr3+/Cr6+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couples.43,48,49,55,56,64–66 So far, Mn-based redox system materials have become the most widely studied due to their abundant reserves and low prices.
In Li1+x(MM′)1−xO2−yFy (x > 0 and y ≥ 0), the choice of M′ is usually a d0 TM element, which is a useful handle for dealing with chemical diversity in DRX materials. As a valence compensator sharing the same position with Li and M, it can effectively modulate the Li/M ratio. Recent studies have shown that M′ can also act as a “redox modulator” and directly affect the cathode performance, even if it is generally electrochemically inactive.67Fig. 10a compares the electrochemical performances of Li1.3Nb0.3Mn0.4O2 and Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 cathodes, where the Mn content was kept constant and Nb5+ and Ti4+ were used as d0 TM cations, respectively. The O oxidation of the Nb compound contributed significantly to the capacity, while the Ti compound had better cycling stability. The intensity retention characteristics of oxygen oxidation were compared by RIXS analysis (Fig. 10b–d).66 The results indicated that oxygen redox is more reversible when cycled in Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2. The two d0 TMs play distinctly different roles: Nb5+ promotes the overall O redox involvement of DRX, while Ti4+ stabilizes the oxygen redox process and makes it more reversible.66

4.2 O redox in the DRX
DRX cathodes can provide higher capacities than stoichiometric ratios in Li-excess transition metal cathode materials, by exploiting the redox reaction of O.40,45 However, the role of the redox process of oxygen in electrochemical performance and cathode material stability is not clear. The redox of O2− during charging typically results in the loss of lattice oxygen. In one case, the less stable On− (0 < n < 2) may be disproportionate to the O2− and O2 gas leaving the lattice. This reaction leads to the collapse of the anionic sublattice and the loss of coulombic efficiency.68–71 In the other case, On− may be reduced to O2− or Om− (n < m < 2), allowing reversible O redox to occur upon cycling. One case provides a reversible capacity increase without the severe sacrifice of cathode stability.68–70 To be able to quantify the oxygen gas evolved, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) has been widely used to study the processes associated with the pathway.72–76Fig. 11a confirms that the charging platform is related to oxygen redox activity. In synchrotron-based RIXS (mRIXS), Zhao et al. studied the evolution of oxygen after the Li1.2Ni0.35Ti0.35Nb0.1O1.8F0.2 cathodic electrochemical cycle.77 In the charged state, the mRIXS characteristic increased in intensity at 523.7 eV emission and 531 eV excitation energy, showing the presence of oxidized oxygen (Fig. 11b). They noticed that due to the overlapping features of the oxide oxygen and Ti–O hybridization, it appeared as a shoulder on mRIXS rather than a separate feature. The intensity of the shoulder joint characteristic increased with increasing charging voltage and decreased with increasing discharge, indicating reversible oxygen redox activity (Fig. 11c). The neutron pair distribution function (PDF) analysis showed that the change in the average O–O distance maintained by the oxygen lattice framework during charge and discharge was negligible (Fig. 11d). In addition, titration mass spectrometry (TiMS) has been used to quantify the number of peroxide-like oxygen dimers formed in vivo,73,76 supplemented by RIXS analysis of oxidized oxygen species. Crafton et al. recently applied TiMS to detect the formation of peroxide-like oxygen species in Li1.2Mn0.6Nb0.2O2 and their contribution to charge storage capacity (Fig. 11e).73

If we want to improve the application of O redox in Li-ion batteries, it is important to pay attention to both reversible redox reactions of oxygen and irreversible oxygen loss.30 Ceder et al. found that oxygen can lead to higher energy density when it is involved in redox reactions in their study.30 The order of redox depends on the relative content of M and O, and excess lithium and cation disorder leads to changes in the local environment in the structure, both of which can regulate the different charge compensation of M and O in the charging phase. In layered LiMO2 compounds, all O is connected to three Li+ and three M, and each O 2p orbital is hybridized with one M orbital, which in turn can improve the oxidation resistance. However, in DRX materials, due to the existence of multiple O coordination environments over Li+, there will be three types of O 2p orbitals along Li–O–Li, Li–O–M, and M–O–M configurations.37,44,47,56–61,63 Bruce et al.51 found that a high Ni rock-salt structural shell would be formed on the particle surface upon Ni doping in their study of Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 and Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 with irreversible oxygen loss; Co and Ni co-doping could effectively protect against irreversible oxygen loss. Chen et al.79 reported that d0 TM, although electrochemically inactive, can play a role in regulating oxygen redox when studying the role of non-redox active transition metals in DRX cathode materials. Further studies showed that Nb5+ can significantly enhance oxygen redox using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering,42 while Ti4+ can better stabilize oxygen redox, resulting in better reversibility of the O redox process and less oxygen loss.80 The rational design of the inactive d0 TM cation provides an important way to improve the equilibrium capacity and stability of the new cathode material.81 There is currently another mechanism to explain oxygen redox, which emphasizes that the need to analyse experimental data obtained in Li-rich DRX cathode materials is paramount, which also considers several possible redox processes and M–O bonding changes (M–O orbital hybridization).82
5 Future perspectives and conclusions
A variety of lithium-excess DRX materials have been recently reported as attractive LIBs cathode materials. Compared with conventional cathodes such as LiCoO2, NMC, and Li-excess (LMR), DRX materials perform at a higher capacity (Fig. 12). Although their average discharge voltage is slightly lower, the overall energy density exceeds that of most cathodes. Furthermore, some DRXs can deliver reversible capacities and energy densities exceeding 300 mA h g−1 and 1000 W h kg−1, which has attracted extensive research.48,49,63–65 However, there are some areas for improvement in DRX materials, such as the harsh preparation method, fast capacity decay, and unclear reaction mechanism. At this stage, DRX research can be approached from the following aspects to achieve practical purposes.

5.1 Improvements in synthetic methods of DRX
Although the research on disordered cathode materials attracted much attention in the early period, only a few studies on disordered cathode materials were reported. In 1991, Delmas et al. prepared ω-LixV2O5 with a disordered structure (0 < x < 1) by electrochemical methods.78 Based on the present understanding of the material, it could be explained that the d0 metal ions occupy most of the Oh sites and thus play a role in stabilizing the disordered structure. For the commonly used mechanochemical method to obtain DRX structured cathode materials, it was reported by Obrovac et al. in 1998 that a large number of LixMO2 compounds (M = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) were synthesized using this method, which also became the pre-model for DRX materials synthesized by the mechanochemical method.37 However, this method resulted in the loss of Li and O during the ball milling process, making the Li content x ≤ 1. The electrochemical activity of such materials synthesized by this method was poor (<10 mA h g−1 of reversible capacity) except for LixMnO2, so it was thought at that time that DRX materials would hinder the diffusion of Li+.37 Recently, Urban et al. found that the reason for the poor diffusion ability of Li+ in the DRX-structured LixMnO2 system was not the system itself, but the Li+ content was lower than the Li+ diffusion threshold.33 When the Li+ content exceeds 5–15% then it does not hinder the diffusion of Li+ in the cation disordered structure. The chemical composition, spatial structure, synthesis method, capacity and retention of various DRX cathodes are listed in Table 1.

At present, the commonly used synthesis methods for cathode materials include the traditional solid-state synthesis (SSS), sol–gel synthesis (SGS), co-precipitation synthesis (CPS), mechanochemical synthesis (MCS), and molten-salt synthesis (MS). A comparison of their advantages and disadvantages in the DRX material preparation can be found in Fig. 13. SSS usually uses carbonate or oxide compounds, which mix to carry out the sintering reaction.49,52 The advantages of the SSS method include the simple material preparation process, the ease of obtaining raw materials, as well as the established means of material commercialization. However, the prepared cathode material has limited capacitance, poor mixing uniformity of raw materials, poor performance stability of prepared materials, and poor-quality consistency between batches. SGS is a method for preparing ultrafine particle cathode materials; a good molecular mixture, good material uniformity, performance stability, and higher capacitance of cathode materials can be obtained as compared with the SSS.38,63 However, SGS is still in the development stage and the cost is higher. The material produced by CPS is relatively uniform, and the segregation of the ingredients is small, whereas the particle size is not easy to control by the CPS method, and its process is slightly complicated. The MS method involves adding a certain proportion of flux during the ball milling process to obtain micron-sized or even nano-scale electrode materials.89 The electrode material prepared by this method has a larger diffusion coefficient and better cycle stability. MCS is usually carried out by loading materials into a ball mill. In the ball milling process, the material is in a strongly agitated grinding ball and is subjected to repeated action by impact, milling force, shear force, and pressure, so that it is constantly deformed, broken, and cold welded.49,53 This method can be directly used to synthesize DRX cathode materials. In the ball milling process, the surface and shape of the particles are also changed, the loose density and fluidity of the powder are improved, the particles are agglomerated and grown, and the full mixing of more than two powders is realized. Most of the DRX cathode materials are synthesized by traditional solid-state methods at 700–1100 °C and then ball-milled to the micron or even the nanometer level. However, at present, the F-doped DRX cathode material can only be prepared by high-energy mechanical ball milling (MCS). The applications for mechanical ball milling will be discussed in a later section.

5.2 The effects of F chemistry on the properties of DRX materials
In recent studies, fluorination has become a common strategy for improving the thermal and electrochemical stability of secondary batteries.90–100 For example, doping the highly electronegative F into the organic electrolyte can improve its stability at high voltage and increase the oxidation potential. Lithium salts (e.g., LiPF6) and solvents (e.g., FEC) obtained by fluorination are commonly used in the preparation of high-voltage electrolytes. The insulating F-coatings can effectively prevent the exothermic reaction between the positive electrode material and the electrolyte interface during charging.105 F substitution effectively maximizes the TM content for charge compensation for Li-rich DRX. A unique advantage of DRX over classical layered oxide cathodes is its ability to be modified in both cation and anion sublattices. In DRX structures, local chemical inhomogeneities driven by metal-poor and lithium-rich environments allow the incorporation of fluoride anions into the oxygen sublattice at much higher levels than the surface doping of ordered layered cathode materials.106 Fluorination is typically achieved by using lithium fluoride as a precursor of F in SSS or MCS. The former limits the F content to ∼10 at%, whereas the solubility of F in the latter is much higher. This unique feature expands the composition space and improves electrochemical performance due to the inherently more stable TM redox process.107 Recent studies have shown that F substitution has many positive effects on DRX performance.90 Firstly, the increased TM content allows more capacity contribution from cation redox while reducing that from O redox, leading to high capacity without sacrificing cycling stability.108 The chemical composition, spatial structure, synthesis method, capacity and retention of F-doping in DRX cathodes are listed in Table 2.

In the initial study on the effects of F doping, the effect of LiF use in the solid state method was explored. Due to the irreversible reactions of O under high potentials, it will lead to the degradation of electrochemical performance during cycling (such as O loss). However, it was found that F does not dissolve easily but forms a coating on the surface of the positive electrode particles, which does not fully dope into the transition metal oxide lattice layer.112 In 2015, Chen et al.115 reported for the first time that a fluorine oxide DRX cathode material Li2VO2F was successfully synthesized by mechanochemical methods.115 Since then, F doping has been successfully realized in more and more DRX materials, but it is still challenging to distinguish between O and F species for the current characterization tools. There are many other studies on the effects of F chemistry, including the reasons for the difficulty of F doping in layered LMOs materials through first-principles calculations and the explanation of how F enters the anion sites in the DRX structure. The solid solution limit of LiF in the DRX lattice was obtained under experimental conditions. However, more advanced characterization is needed to reveal the complex crystal structural changes of cathode materials due to the additional compositional inhomogeneity and short-range ordered structures. Currently, sub-stable materials with high F content can only be obtained by mechanochemical ball milling. Ceder et al. investigated that Li–F attraction could enhance the formation of Li-rich environments, which leads to an increase in 0-TM channel concentration.60 Thus, substantial fluorine substitution (>15%) typically improves 0-TM percolation, as predicted by pairwise interaction models and cluster extension models. At low F concentrations, the effect of fluorination reactions is strongly dependent on composition and chemistry. The reason for poor lithium transport in non-fluorinated oxides is cationic SROs, which are detrimental to 0-TM percolation. Fluorination can enhance lithium transport by disrupting these local configurations and promoting the formation of connected lithium-rich environments. The formation of these environments is so favourable that they occur even in compounds in the stoichiometric limit (x < 1.09/f.u.). Fig. 14a compares the related charge/discharge capacities of some F-doped materials. Although the initial capacity of F10 with higher F and Mn content is lower, it can be maintained even after 30 cycles.116 The introduced fluorination is sufficiently favourable for the formation of SROs to allow 0-TM permeation. The recent studies on DRX samples with different TM combinations of Ni2+–Ti4+, Mn2+–Ti4+, Ni2+–Nb5+, and Mn2+–Nb5+ (Li content fixed at 1.2) showed the formation of isolated rather than permeable lithium-rich structural domains at low content of F (Fig. 14b).116 DRX materials also provide a new reference for the development of other cathodes. In the study of the new lithium-rich DRX oxyfluorides Li2V0.5Ti0.5O2F and Li2V0.5Fe0.5O2F, Guo's group reported that the cyclic stability of both materials was significantly improved as compared to Li2VO2F.117 The coordination of d electrons (Ni2+, Mn2+, Mn3+, or Fe3+) between the F nucleus and nearby transition metals produces a very wide range of signals, indicating that most F is in a paramagnetic environment. 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy can be used to demonstrate that the coordination of d electrons (Ni2+, Mn2+, Mn3+, or Fe3+) between the F nucleus and nearby transition metals produces a very wide range of signals, indicating that most F is in a paramagnetic environment (Fig. 14c and d).118Fig. 14e and f show the representative voltage curves of two oxygen fluorides with initial charge/discharge capacities of 243/220 mA h g−1 and 258 mA h g−1/254 mA h g−1, for LNMF and LNFF, respectively. It is worth noting that in subsequent cycles, the discharge capacity of LNMF and LNFF increased to the highest values, which were 285 mA h g−1 (910 W h kg−1) and 265 mA h g−1 (624 W h kg−1), respectively.118 Based on DFT calculations, it was demonstrated that the substitution of V3+ with Ti3+ and Fe3+ facilitates the disordered generation of mixed sub-stable DRX oxyfluoride phases. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the substitution stabilized the electrode particle surface of the active material and improved the reversibility of V3+/V5+ redox coupling. This work provides a strategy for the stabilization of the DRX structure, thus further improving the electrochemical cycling performance of the material. All these findings enable the synthesis of novel cathode materials with high capacity and stability, possibly by F substituting for a part of O within DRX materials.

5.3 The design of high entropy (HE) cathode materials based on DRX material design
High-entropy oxides with rock salt structures are an attractive class of materials with interesting functional properties. For cathodes in LIBs, DRX-type materials are ideal candidates for designing HE materials due to their good chemical flexibility. Breitung et al.119 prepared polyanionic and cationic compounds, new lithium/sodium materials, by chemical reactions in a simple mechanism using a newly designed polycationic transition metal-type high-entropy oxide as a precursor and LiF or NaCl as a reactant. They synthesized the Li-containing entropy-stabilized fluorine oxide composite Lix(Co0.2Cu0.2Mg0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)OFx and found by testing that its working potential for Li+/Li is 3.4 V, which can be used as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Fig. 15a shows XRD patterns obtained for the prepared Li(HEO)F and a mixture of pristine HEO and lithium fluoride. The latter compound has a rock-salt structure. As shown in Fig. 15, the Li and F atoms are randomly distributed on the respective cation and anion sublattices of the rock-salt HEO. It is obvious from the decrease in the reflection intensity of (111) that Li replaces the transition metal cations. This is because the atomic number of Li is lower than that of the other transition metals. XRD indicated that lithium fluoride was successfully incorporated into the HEO structure. The initial charge cycles at C/20 and C/10 reached 168 and 161 mA h g−1, respectively. The specific discharge capacity at both rates was about 120 mA h g−1 (Fig. 15c). The initial capacity loss was partly due to the degradation of the electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The specific capacity at C/10 was almost completely recovered after applying high rates up to 5C in Fig. 15d. Unlike conventional (non-entropic) oxyfluorides, this new material showed enhanced lithium storage performance due to entropic stabilization, generally by tuning the cycling performance by changing the constituent elements in an unprecedented way. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the concept of entropy stabilization is also applicable to sodium-containing oxyfluorides with rock-salt structure, thus paving the way for the development of post-lithium battery technology.120

Ceder et al.120 successfully synthesized three different TM species (2-TM, 4-TM, and 6-TM) by using the conventional solid-state method. The XRD patterns of these three different TM species suggest that they belong to the Fmm space group and are derived from the average rock-salt lattice. By comparing a series of DRX cathodes containing 2, 4, or 6 TM, Ceder et al.120 found that the SRO significantly decreased, and the energy density and rate capability systematically increased as more TM cationic materials were mixed while the total metal content remained fixed. The related electrochemical performances of these three materials were also evaluated. 2-TM demonstrated the capacity of 220 mA h g−1 (704 W h kg−1) at a rate of 20 mA g−1 in the voltage range from 1.5 to 4.7 V. When more TM species were added in the DRX structure, 4-TM revealed 269 mA h g−1 (849 W h kg−1) and 6-TM further increased to 307 mA h g−1 (955 W h kg−1). DRX cathodes with 6-TM can maintain over 170 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 high current density. Additional results showed that the polarization decreased obviously with TM species increasing in the DRX structure from the study. The results verified their design strategy of reducing SRO to improve Li+ transport, further increasing capacity and reducing polarization. The benefits of increasing TM types for DRX materials were further confirmed by multiplicative performance tests performed on the three materials mentioned above. For 2-TM, 4-TM, and 6-TM, the capacity decay was reduced with more TM types as the current density increased from 20 mA g−1 to 2000 mA g−1. To further accelerate the development and commercialization mechanism of DRX cathodes is also very important, such as the effect of electrolyte decomposition at the high voltage typically used for DRX materials. New electrolyte strategies or surface protection are expected to improve the cycle life of HE DRX cathodes. Some studies in recent years have begun to focus on the development of new synthesis/sintering routes for high-entropy oxides (HEO) with rock-salt structures.120–124Table 3 shows part of the application of high-entropy materials in the cathode materials of Li-ion batteries in recent years.

5.4 The role of SRO in DRX
Short-range ordering (SRO) is a very localized structural feature, usually extending from a few atoms to several atomic layers.125
In DRX, although all cations are randomly distributed, SRO exists throughout the structure, which plays an important role in kinetics, performance, and even the stability of materials.126 DRX materials may form short-range orders due to elastic and electrostatic interactions and affect the transport of Li+.127 In fact, some studies have suggested that SRO is prevalent in DRX cathode materials and may significantly affect Li+ transport, thus providing another way to modify their properties.46,115,127 It is important to note that SRO is fundamentally different from long order and should not be confused with the formation of poorly formed domains with large and small long orders.114 SRO is an equilibrium phenomenon above the ordered–disordered transition temperature, whereas a truly random-disorder state can only occur at infinite temperatures.
Jones et al.128 investigated cationic SRO in Li1.25Nb0.25Mn0.5O2, using a series of experimental techniques and comparing samples prepared by solid-state reactions at different cooling rates. For those samples, the low-intensity superstructure reflections in XRD can be rationally ascribed to the short-range ordering of Li, Nb, and Mn species similar to the γ-LiFeO2 structure (Fig. 16a) with correlation lengths of ca. 125 Å for the slow cooling samples and 30 Å for the rapidly cooling samples. However, the appearance of superstructure reflections and the longer correlation lengths in the slowly cooled samples are more likely a reflection of the smaller ordered domains.

The Rietveld refinement for the rapidly-cooled sample (in (a)) yields a DRX Fmm unit cell with a = 4.19551(7) Å, and a statistical distribution of Li (blue), Nb (orange), and Mn (purple) on the metal site. The Rietveld refinement for the slow-cooled sample (in (b)) yields a body-centered tetragonal unit cell with a′ = b′ = ars, and c′ = 2ars, with space group I41/amd and ars = 4.18651(1) Å, the space group of γ-LiFeO2 (shown in the inset).

Ji et al.46 explained the very different properties of Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2 (LMTO) and Li1.2Mn0.4Zr0.4O2 (LMZO) by describing the different SRO in these cathodes. These two compounds have the same Li and Mn contents and similar concentrations of high-valent d0 cations (Ti4+ and Zr4+). They found that the cation short-range order (SRO) is important in determining the amount of kinetically extractable Li in the DRX material since Li transport depends on permeation through the three-dimensional network. The upper cut-off voltage of LMZO was set to 4.5 V, while LMTO was set to 4.7 V. This is because cycling LMZO 4.7 V at 50 °C provides additional reversible capacity compared to the 4.5 V cut-off, resulting in side effects beyond 4.5 V that appear to lead to increased polarization and the subsequent fading of the discharge voltage. The difference between room temperature and 50 °C indicates a clear kinetic limitation of LMZO over the entire voltage range, unlike LMTO, which improves only at 50 °C near the upper cut-off voltage. They found that the former was significantly better than the latter by observing the electrochemical properties of LMTO and LMZO. The electron diffraction patterns, as shown in Fig. 17b, as well as the neutron pair distribution function analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, indicate the presence of different levels and types of SRO in the two synthesized compounds, where SRO is particularly evident in Li1.2Mn0.4Zr0.4O2. Fig. 17c summarizes the occurrence of various tetrahedral clusters in LMTO and LMZO relative to the random case through Monte Carlo simulations. It was observed that the occurrence of Li4 tetrahedra (0-TM channels) is most important for good Li transport and is significantly lower in LMZO than in LMTO, although the Li4 populations in both materials are lower than the random cation distribution. To visualize the Li diffusion pathways in LMTO and LMZO, representative MC structures are shown in Fig. 17d. The 0-TM-connected Li network is highlighted in green. It is clear from these images that LMTO has extensive 0-TM Li networks that are well connected and should allow for convenient Li transport, while LMZO lacks 0-TM channels, thus hindering Li diffusion.116 SRO has a significant effect on Li+ diffusivity, which in turn affects the rate performance. The transport properties of the DRX material can be changed by controlling the SRO, and the connection between the SRO and Li sites in the DRX depends on its chemical properties. When M′2+ is in the system, more 0-TM channels can be formed, and the available Li content is more, which is conducive to the formation of Li4 clusters and the long-range diffusion of Li+.

5.5 The effects of the electrode and electrolyte interface on DRX material stability
With the development of DRX materials, the study of DRX materials with electrolytes has gradually become an important issue as it concerns the stability of the whole system. The study showed that the carbonate-based electrolytes could decompose at high potentials, which referred to the working region of DRX materials. For DRX materials, as their composition is required to be lithium-rich to activate the percolation process, the electrochemical reaction is accompanied by redox reactions of active oxygen species when charging to the high-voltage region. This process could lead to the potential release of O2 that greatly reduced the stability of the electrode and electrolyte interface. The decomposition of the electrolyte will cause deposition products resulting from electrolyte decomposition/sacrifice in the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). On the condition that the CEI layer is stable enough, it prevents further decomposition of the electrolyte and stabilizes lattice distortion to make the structure more stable. When the voltage goes higher than 4.4 V, irreversible CO2 production can be observed. Qiao et al. investigated LiBOB as a boron-containing electrolyte additive to achieve enhanced CEI through BOB-derived crosslinking and B–F/BxOy polymer components.129 LiBOB additive customizes CEI to protect the cathode with a uniform, dense, and stable passivation layer. This strategy will provide solutions for the design/modification of DRX cathode electrolytes. To accurately quantify the anionic redox in DRX materials, the titration mass spectrometry (TMS) detection method has been introduced into the study of batteries and has been fully applied.130 TMS serves as a reliable quantification technique for the accurate quantification of O-related anionic redox reactions. TMS technology can achieve the quantification of oxidized lattice oxygen and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)/cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and guide corresponding design strategies by enhancing the understanding of the mechanism.131–133 This could also influence the studies related to the O-redox process.
Moreover, the transition metal dissolved in the electrolyte has to be considered as it will also reduce the cycling performance of the whole battery and increase the impedance of the cathode material. This can be solved by using a high-concentration electrolyte or by surface coating the DRX cathode material. General methods to improve the stability of the cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI) include replacing sources that decompose or sacrifice carbonate solvents with highly concentrated or fluorinated electrolyte strategies.134–136 Research from Qiao's group showed that a stable CEI could be formed by introducing a micro electrolyte additive and refining the dehydrogenation process of the primary carbonate solvent, which leads to long-cycle performance. This improvement in electrolyte additive strategy can also be used to develop electrolytes suitable for DRX materials.137
5.6 Application of DRX in Na-ion batteries
In recent years, Yabuuchi et al.139 attempted to synthesize sodium-excess cathode materials by conventional solid-phase sintering in the binary system x Na3NbO4-(1 − x) NaMnO2 through extensive experiments, but the synthesized samples decomposed into two phases, Na3NbO4 and NaMnO2. Subsequently, the route for synthesizing a sub-stable structure was considered, and then the first sodium-excess DRX material by mechanical ball milling was synthesized. As the milling time of the two phases of Na3NbO4 and NaMnO2 became longer, the sample finally transformed into a DRX structure (Fig. 18a). The sample underwent a phase transition after heating, and finally, a mixture of precursor Na3NbO4 and NaMnO2 was obtained, indicating that the phase was in a metastable state. Fig. 18b shows the STEM images and EDX elemental maps of the samples. The successful synthesis of the sub-stable phase was further demonstrated by the results of STEM in Fig. 18b. Na and Nb ions are located in octahedral positions in the cubic closed-filled (ccp) lattice of oxide ions, and clusters consisting of four Nb ions are surrounded by sodium ions (Fig. 18c). All tests failed to synthesize samples by conventional calcination (Fig. 18c). The Na3NbO4 and NaMnO2 phases were separated and the solid solution range was narrow. Fig. 18d compares the electrochemical properties of the samples prepared by conventional calcination and mechanical ball milling. When all Na ions were extracted from Na1.3Nb0.3Mn0.4O2, the theoretical capacity reached 311 mA h g−1. However, the sample prepared by conventional calcination provided only 95 mA h g−1, which almost corresponds to the theoretical capacity based on the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox. This result suggests that O2− redox was not activated. Anion redox activation in this system was directly related to the presence of d0 Nb5+. Unfortunately, further practical applications of Nb were directly hindered by the fact that Nb is an expensive transition metal element.141 Meanwhile, the expensive Nb ion can be replaced by a less expensive Ti ion, similar to their lithium counterparts.140

Yabuuchi et al.141 took advantage of the successful experience achieved previously and systematically investigated the x Na2TiO3-(1 − x) NaMnO2 binary system with anionic redox based on the similar properties of Ti4+ and Nb5+, and successfully synthesized meta-stable sodium-excess cathode materials with the DRX structure based on anionic redox activity by the same mechanical ball milling method. Fig. 19a shows the XRD patterns of the binary system of x Na2TiO3-(1 − x) NaMnO2 with different chemical compositions after the mechanical ball milling method at 600 rpm. The XRD patterns of the samples can be indexed to a cationic disordered rock-salt-type structure. The wide diffraction lines indicate the formation of nano-sized and low crystallinity samples, a trend usually observed for samples prepared by the mechanical ball milling method. The synthesis of this binary system by calcination was unsuccessful (Fig. 19c), so a mechanical milling method was used to synthesize thermodynamically sub-stable phases using mechanical energy, including frictional and shear stresses. The electrochemical performance of the binary system of x Na2TiO3-(1 − x) NaMnO2 is shown in Fig. 19b. The capacity retention of the x Na2TiO3-(1 − x) NaMnO2 binary system is shown in Fig. 19d. For comparison, there is also the plot of the previously reported results for Na1.3Mn0.4Nb0.3O2 used as a model material. The rate capability of Na1.14Mn0.57Ti0.29O2 was also tested in Na batteries, and the results are shown in Fig. 19e. In the tested electrode material, this binary system of Na1.14Mn0.57Ti0.29O2 provides ≈200 mA h g−1 from the reversible redox reaction of the cation Mn3+/Mn4+ and the anion O2−/On−.141

Note that Na2TiO3 is electrochemically inactive even after mechanical milling because of an electronically non-conductive oxide. Reproduced with permission. Ref. 141 Copyright 2020, Wiley-VCH. 
In 2015, Okada et al.142 obtained LiFeOF with a cubic structure and space group of Fmm using a dry ball milling method under ambient pressure. The obtained LiFeOF has an energy density of 730 W h kg−1, which is higher than that of LiFePO4 and the ionic cell has good cyclability. The XRD measurements demonstrate that the LiFeOF cathode can accommodate Li extraction/insertion by reversible expansion and contraction of the lattice. In 2017, Yabuuchi et al.143 successfully prepared nano-sized and sub-stable Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3/7O2 by a mechanical ball milling process targeting a binary system of LiMoO2–Li3NbO4. This sample provided a large reversible capacity in Li batteries ≈280 mA h g−1, with good capacity retention capability. The three-electron redox reaction of Mo3+/Mo6+ was utilized to improve the energy density of the Li battery. In 2017, a new lithium tin-based material was reported by Kobayashi et al.144 Cubic Li2SnS3 and solid solutions of Li2SnS3 and Li3NbS4 were obtained by mechanical ball milling. The cubic Li2SnS3 is a metastable phase, while the monoclinic Li2SnS3 is a stable phase. The solid solution of cubic Li2SnS3 is an ionic conductor, while the solid solution of monoclinic Li2SnS3 is an ionic conductor and the solid solution of Li3NbS4–Li2SnS3 can be used as an electrode active material for secondary lithium batteries.
In 2018, Yabuuchi et al.145 successfully prepared rock-salt-type LiMnO2 and NaMnO2 sub-stable phases by mechanical ball-milling, and the electrochemical properties of these phases have been investigated. Although these thermodynamically stable phases of LiMnO2 and NaMnO2 have been extensively studied in battery applications, this could not be significantly improved by using sub-stable phases with unique nanostructures. With the recent breakthrough in the design of the Na-excess DRX cathode for Na-ion batteries by Yabuuchi, more and more outstanding scholars around the world have begun to pay attention to this field. The two binary systems of DRX cathode materials obtained by the mechanical ball milling method both use NaMnO2 as one of the precursors.138,141 NaMnO2 can be obtained by the conventional solid-phase method and the DRX structure of NaMnO2 can be obtained by the mechanical ball milling method.145 We can consider continuing the development of other binary systems based on NaMnO2 materials.146 We can also consider NaCrO2, which has similar properties to NaMnO2, and O3-NaCrO2, which can be obtained by mechanical ball milling to obtain DRX NaCrO2.147 When the material is transformed into the rock salt phase structure by mechanical ball milling, Cr and Mn cations exhibit relatively high mobility upon delocalization, making the rock salt or layered-spinel conversion of Cr-based and Mn-based compounds (LiMO2) more sensitive. Cr-based compounds are frequently converted into the rock-salt-type,16,148 whereas Mn-based compounds exhibit a strong tendency to form spinel structures,149 implying that the different electronic structures of Cr and Mn may play a key role in determining the pathway of structural conversion (i.e., layered to rock-salt and layered to spinel).
In summary, the synthesis method of mechanical ball milling has many applications in Li-ion batteries. It is also possible to synthesize solid electrolytes using the mechanical ball milling method.150 Therefore, we can apply the mechanical ball milling method to the material synthesis process in sodium-ion batteries. The works of Yabuuchi on DRX structured cathode materials for Na-ion batteries are based on the summary of the above series of studies.139,142 Synthesis methods are continuously optimized, characterization tools are being improved, and the understanding of Na-excess DRX cathode materials is becoming more thorough. However, due to the late development of sodium-excess DRX cathode materials and the radius of the sodium ion being larger than that of the lithium ion, the existing synthetic methods of Li-excess DRX cathode materials cannot be fully applied in the field of SIBs. In addition, the synthesis method of the SIBs system is more complicated, and still, relatively few people have mastered the corresponding synthesis method, thus there is still much to be explored by scholars.
The understanding of the design and structure of high-performance sodium-ion cathodes remains a challenge in the development of layered materials for SIBs. In 2019, Hu et al. reported a new concept for designing a high entropy strategy of layered oxide cathodes for SIBs.153 As an example, long-cycle stability (∼83% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and excellent rate capability (∼80% capacity retention at 5.0C rate) have been demonstrated within layered O3-NaNi0.12Cu0.12Mg0.12Fe0.15Co0.15Mn0.1Ti0.1Sn0.1Sb0.04O2. During the charge and discharge process, a highly reversible phase transition behaviour occurs between the O3 and P3 structures, and more importantly, this phase transition is delayed, with more than 60% of the total capacity stored within the O3-type region. The presence of multiple transition metal components in this high-entropy material can accommodate the changes in local interactions of this material during Na+ (de)intercalation.151,152,154 This strategy opens up new horizons for the development of advanced cathode materials. Table 4 shows some of the applications of high-entropy materials in the cathode materials of Na-ion batteries in recent years.

In conclusion, the DRX-structured transition metal oxide material is a newly emerging high-energy Li-ion battery cathode material. However, there are some drawbacks that hinder its application in the future.
(i) The formation of electrochemically active DRX materials has a lot of requirements, such as the inclusion of d0 elements as well as excess lithium, and so on. These will significantly reduce the species in DRX materials that influence the diversity of material components. It will also lead to a second drawback of DRX materials.
(ii) The synthesis of DRX materials, especially for the F-substituted compounds, is usually more difficult as compared with the layered structure. Mechanical ball milling with high milling speed is needed for particular materials. This will also have an impact on its commercial application.
(iii) The electrochemical performance of DRX materials should be improved, including the cycling performance as well as the rate ability. Few DRX materials can withstand long-time cycling for hundreds of cycles.
(iv) The O redox is involved in the DRX materials, especially for the lithium-excess compounds. This O loss will directly reduce the stability and electrochemical performance of DRX materials.
(v) Many DRX materials exhibit a high capacity when cycled in the high voltage region. This will cause additional trouble to the electrolyte. A suitable electrolyte is required for the development of the DRX materials. A lot of effort is needed before DRX can be widely used in practical applications. When designing DRX materials, the following situations need to be considered:
(i) Excess Li is required to form the percolation channels of 0-TM, and the higher the Li content, the higher the reversible capacity that can be reached since the amount of anion redox can be limited.
(ii) The electrochemically inert d0 elements are imperative in DRX materials and play a decisive role in the performance of DRX materials. They can stabilize the disordered structure by occupying the more distorted Oh sites.
(iii) To achieve a better cycling performance, the redox-active TM of choice needs to be able to reduce the O redox activity and related surface modifications, thus improving TM redox capacity and cycling stability.
(iv) F replacing part of O as the doping element could improve the new cathode materials with high capacity and high stability, therefore, expanding the DRX material design.
Moreover, the SRO could significantly affect Li+ transport, which plays an important role in kinetics, performance, and stability, the HE provides an ideal platform for DRX material design. These strategies are also valid for the material design.
The synthesis method for DRX materials should also be improved. Currently, a lot of DRX materials are synthesized by high-energy ball milling, especially for the F-doped DRX materials, to reach the submicron scale for better performance. The milling conditions, including pots and balls, are crucial for the milling energy and thus influence the products. The improved conventional solid-phase methods are expected for large-scale material products. The DRX cathode material system can accommodate more TM types so that the cost of materials can be saved from the raw material side. Compared with commonly used layered materials containing Ni, Co, and Mn, DRX materials containing Fe, Mn, and Ti have more advantages in terms of cost. Despite the DRX cathode materials having significantly large capacity properties, as the potential candidate for commercialization cathode material, the rate performance and cycle stability of DRX materials have to be improved. The development of DRX materials could also feed back to related materials research. The calculations related to the prediction of the thermal stability of DRX materials, as well as experimental parameters combined with the structural and other physicochemical parameters, could help the development of theoretical studies such as machine learning. The material characterization technique of DRX, such as the titration mass spectrometry (TMS) detection method, could help to improve the fundamental research concerning the O redox property and so on. The application of these advanced techniques could improve both the study of DRX as well as the material research.
Although there are many challenges to overcome before the DRX material can be used in practical application, the prominent advantage is worthy of further investigation in the pursuit of future LIB cathode materials. We hope that this review will provide good insight into DRX materials in general and promote the development of DRX material in the future.
