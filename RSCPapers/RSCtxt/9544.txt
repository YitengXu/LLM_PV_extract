    , Accepted 5th October 2016First published on 5th October 2016AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) perovskites are under extensive focus due to their natural multiple quantum well structures and intense excitonic luminescence. Here we provide comprehensive photoluminescence studies on solution-processed (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 crystals. The synthesized crystals exhibit three single excitonic emissions with different luminescent nature of 0D-like excitons, 2D localized excitons, and self-trapped excitons, respectively.
Introduction
Over the past few years, the study of three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites has blossomed into one of the most exciting areas of materials science.1–5 Benefiting from their high absorption coefficient, long carrier recombination lifetime, high charge carrier mobility and unique defect physics,6–8 these materials have emerged as some of the most promising absorber materials for efficient photovoltaic devices, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3D perovskite-based solar cells has recently exceeded 22%.9 However, the environmental stability, considered to be another critical factor for photovoltaics, turns out to be the major current limitation for the optoelectronic application of 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.10 In contrast, their layered two-dimensional (2D) counterparts exhibit promising stability, but, unfortunately, poor efficiency due to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic cations.11–13
Notably, in a very recent work, Tsai et al.14 addressed this issue by producing thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to facilitate efficient charge transport. They reported a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52% with greatly improved stability in comparison to the 3D counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress tests. As a result, the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered 2D hybrid perovskites is anticipated to be essential for high-performance optoelectronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability.
On the other hand, it is of interest to focus on the excitons in 2D perovskites since the excitonic behavior is important to both fundamental understanding and potential applications.15 Generally, layered organic–inorganic hybrid 2D perovskites are essentially quantum wells (QWs), with charge carriers confined in the inorganic part formed by the MX6 octahedra, due to both the wider bandgap and lower dielectric constant of the organic layer.15–17 These features reveal the existence of excitons with a high binding energy of a few hundred meV.18–20 To our knowledge, despite the various research studies in the past on 2D perovskite QWs,15,19–21 their luminescence origin remains controversial, and the excitonic performance is still demanding further investigation.
In this work, comprehensive photoluminescence (PL) studies are conducted on (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (PEPI) organic–inorganic hybrid 2D perovskite crystals prepared through a layered solution method. Three kinds of excitonic emissions are identified as those of QD-like excitons, 2D localized excitons, and self-trapped excitons, respectively. These results may highlight the great potential of these materials as novel excitonic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of PEPI crystals
PEPI crystals were grown at room temperature within a long, straight glass tube by first dissolving 1.0 mmol (0.461 g) of freshly sublimed PbI2 (Aldrich; 99.999%) in 7.5 ml of concentrated (45 wt%) aqueous HI (Aldrich; 99.999%). In order to maintain a nominally inert atmosphere during the crystal growth, PbI2 was weighed and added to the tube in an argon-filled glove box, with oxygen and water levels maintained below 1 ppm. Next, 15 ml of methanol (Aldrich; anhydrous, 99.8%) was then gently syringed on top of the HI/PbI2 solution to create a relatively sharp interface between the solvent layers. Finally, on top of the column, a stoichiometric amount (2 mmol or approximately 0.25 ml) of phenethylamine was carefully added with a syringe. Over a week, orange crystals were observed growing at the interface between the solutions (which slowly diffused together). The crystals were isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum at 55 °C.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted using an X'pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical) operated at 40 keV and 40 mA equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical environment of Pb, I, and N elements in the as-prepared PEPI crystals. The measurements were carried out on an ESCALAB_250Xi spectrometer using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source (1486.6 eV).
Ultraviolet-visible near-infrared absorption (UV) measurements of the perovskites dispersed in toluene (1 mg ml−1) were performed at room temperature using 1 cm × 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes in a UV3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The PL measurements were carried out on an FLS 920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) using a 405 nm laser with a pulse width of 58.6 ps. The maximal excitation fluence is ∼4 nJ cm−2. For excitation density-dependent measurements, the laser was operated at 20 MHz and the light fluence was tuned using a neutral attenuator. For lifetime measurements by time-correlated single-photon counting, the laser was operated at 200 kHz. The temperature-dependent measurements were performed with a closed-cycle helium cryostat.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of PEPI crystals was carried out by following a well-developed layered solution method reported by Mitzi,22 and is described in detail in the experimental section. The structural and compositional characterization details of the as-prepared PEPI crystals are presented in Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to examine the perovskite crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 1a. A series of sharp (0 0 2l) (l = 1–6) diffraction peaks suggest high crystallinity of the PEPI crystals as well as their wonderful periodicity of the stacking along the 〈1 0 0〉 direction, which finally results in the formation of a layered 2D structure. In addition, it is worth pointing out that the existence of PbI2 is excluded in the sample (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Structural and optical characterization of PEPI powders fabricated by a layered solution process: powder XRD pattern (a), XPS core level spectra of Pb (b), I (c), and N (d) elements, and room temperature steady state absorption and PL emission spectra (e). The inset in (e) shows the estimation of the material bandgap and exciton binding energy. 
The X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) spectra of the PEPI crystals (Fig. 1b–d) were analyzed using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference. It is clearly observed that the as-synthesized samples contain Pb, I, and N elements, implying a triumphant preparation of PEPI crystals. The Pb 4f spectrum exhibits two symmetric peaks attributed to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels at binding energies of 138.2 eV and 143.0 eV, respectively. The spin–orbit split is 4.8 eV, in good agreement with the literature.23,24 Besides, two metallic Pb peaks appear at 141.3 and 136.4 eV, respectively. In the case of the I element, two peaks were observed at 619.0 and 630.5 eV, which are assigned to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, respectively. Moreover, the successful synthesis of the PEPI crystals is more obviously verified by the appearance of the N 1s peak centered at 401.7 eV, relative to the –N– of the ammonium salts.25
The self-assembled layered structure of PEPI, consisting of alternating organic (C6H5C2H4NH3+) and inorganic layers (PbI64− octahedron), is well determined as natural quantum wells that strongly confine excitons in the inorganic part. While the perovskite fever focuses on the photovoltaic properties of 3D crystalline solids,6–8 excitons in 2D crystals have also attracted extensive attention.18–20 Here, systematic PL studies were carried out to get a deep insight into the exciton behaviors and luminescence origin as well.

Fig. 1e shows room temperature absorption and PL emission spectra of the synthesized PEPI crystals. A strong excitonic absorption peak at 520 nm (2.38 eV) as well as two emission peaks at 525 nm (2.36 eV) and 552 nm (2.24 eV) can be clearly observed. From the Tauc plot, the bandgap is estimated to be 2.56 eV (the inset of Fig. 1e). Taking the difference between these energy values, an exciton binding energy of ∼180 meV can be obtained. This is consistent with several literature studies18,20 and is typical for the excitonic 2D perovskite system.
Similar to the room temperature PL emission spectra, upon 405 nm (3.062 eV) excitation, the PEPI crystals present two clear emission peaks at a low temperature of 15 K (Fig. 2a), and the broadening around 3.0 eV in the PL spectrum suggests the existence of another peak. The spectra can be fitted by three Lorentzian peaks, respectively, centered at 2.36 (peak 1), 2.33 (peak 2), and 2.30 eV (peak 3). Note that the discrepancy between the experimental data and fitting results on the high energy tail is due to re-absorption, which is normal for PL spectra. For instance, Sieg et al.26 demonstrated that both the n-InP PL peak width and the peak position are significantly decreased by re-absorption, and that re-absorption completely explained the observed discrepancy between the measured PL peak width and the calculated band filling based on electrical measurements. Li et al.27 found in CdS nanobelts that the room-temperature PL spectrum of the 230 nm nanobelt shows an asymmetric line shape with a long tail at the longer wavelength side owing to the re-absorption effect. A similar re-absorption effect also appeared in 3D perovskites. Yamada et al.28 studied the near-band-edge optical properties of MAPbI3 single crystals, and the photon re-absorption effect was regarded as dominating the carrier recombination and light-emission processes in the interior region.

The inset presents a magnification of the spectra under the lowest three excitation fluences. The maximal excitation fluence is ∼4 nJ cm−2. (d) Logarithm plot of the integrated PL intensity versus excitation fluence. The data show the power-law dependence with k = 1.011, 0.994, and 0.990 for peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
Near-band-edge emission in semiconductors may have several origins, including exciton recombination, free carrier recombination (also known as band-to-band transition), free-to-bound recombination and donor–acceptor pair recombination. Excitation density-dependent PL is helpful to identify the luminescence origin. It has been well-established29,30 that in direct bandgap semiconductors and under non-resonant excitation conditions the integrated PL intensity (IPL) is a power-law function of the excitation density, IPL ∼ Ikex(1)with 1 < k < 2 for recombination of excitons (including free excitons and bound excitons) and k < 1 for free-to-bound and donor–acceptor pair recombination. In the case of our PEPI samples, as described in Fig. 2d, all peaks exhibit excellent power-law dependence when the excitation fluence is varied over a range of about 3 orders of magnitude, with k values very close to 1.0. We note that the maximal excitation fluence is 4 nJ cm−2 (corresponding to a photocarrier density of ∼1014 cm−3), which is quite low and the saturation of PL can be neglected. The results suggest that the unintentional doping in our samples is light and the three peaks could be due to exciton recombination. This is reasonable considering the very large exciton binding energy of layered 2D perovskites. Moreover, as seen in the excitation fluence-dependent PL spectra (Fig. 2c), the three peaks show little change in the peak position in spite of the dramatically varied excitation fluence, excluding the possibility of free carrier recombination.31
The identities of peaks 1, 2 and 3 are further clarified by temperature-dependent PL and PL decay analysis. Among the three emission peaks, peak 1 is generally attributed to free exciton recombination.18,32 As shown in Fig. 2b and 3, the position of peak 1 slightly redshifts with decreasing temperature. Such redshift is contrary to that observed in conventional semiconductors, while it is characteristic of organo-lead perovskites.18,33
 Fig. 3  The temperature dependence of the peak positions of peaks 1, 2, and 3 as determined by temperature-dependent PL emission spectra from 15 to 300 K. The solid line is a fit to the data of peak 3 using a two oscillator model. 
The origins of peaks 2 and 3 are still under debate. Compared with peak 1, peak 2 exhibits a much more significant intensity decline as the temperature increases, especially around 60 K (Fig. S3a–c, ESI†). On the other hand, the dramatic decrease of peak 2 contributes to an easier observation of peak 3 above 200 K (Fig. S3d–f, ESI†). As for peak 2, either a phonon replica of a free exciton or a localized exciton has been invoked as the origin. In Gauthron et al.'s work,20 in addition to peak 1, another emission peak was observed at 2.337 eV at low temperature. They attributed that peak to be a phonon replica of peak 1 due to a significant interaction between peak 1 and optical phonons from their phenomenological model. Coincidentally, Hong et al.16 observed some extrinsic and phonon-related features (multiple evenly spaced peaks red-shifted from peak 1) at 2 K in the PL spectra. However, in our study peak 2 shows different PL decay features from peak 1 (Fig. 4a), which excludes the phonon replica as the origin. In contrast, several literature studies proposed a localized exciton origin for peak 2.18,32,34 For instance, Kitazawa et al.32 found Stokes-shifted emission below 90 K, which was attributed to originating from bound excitons of a trapping–detrapping process. Chong et al.18 also held the opinion that peak 2 arose from bound excitons due to large surface trapping. In the case of our PEPI crystals, peak 2 presents a high activation energy of about 170.4 meV (Fig. S2b, ESI†), close to the reported18 exciton binding energy (∼180 meV). Based on these findings, we thus hypothesize that peak 2 results from localized exciton recombination.
 Fig. 4  (a) Lifetime of peak 1 and 2 emissions at 15 K. (b) Temperature dependence of radiative recombination lifetime of peaks 1, 2, and 3. 
To confirm this conjecture, the dependence of radiative recombination lifetime on temperature was deduced. Theoretically,35 the temperature dependence of the exciton radiative lifetime reveals its direct correlation with a spatial confinement, resulting in a temperature-independent exciton lifetime in the case of zero dimensional excitons, a square root dependence in the case of one dimensional excitons, and a linear dependence for 2D excitons. Owing to the self-assembled QW structure, the confined exciton radiative lifetime of our PEPI crystals is expected to follow a linear dependence on temperature. The linear T-dependence is typical for 2D excitons in QWs,36–38 because it results from the density of states of 2D quantum systems. In Béaur et al.'s study,39 PL spectra of nonpolar M-plane ZnO/Zn0.8Mg0.2O quantum wells exhibit strong excitonic peaks from low (10 K) to high (325 K) temperatures. They found that the total integrated intensity remained quasiconstant and the exciton lifetime increased linearly with temperature from a value of 750 ps at 100 K to about 2.4 ns at 325 K. Nagahara et al.40 compared the excitonic luminescence of CdTe/Cd0.74Mg0.26Te quantum wires (QWRs) with that of 2D excitons in CdTe/Cd0.74Mg0.26Te QWs. The radiative lifetimes of one-dimensional excitons in the QWRs and 2D excitons in the QWs increased with T but showed a clearly different behavior. The observed radiative lifetime in the QWRs obeys T1/2 in a wide temperature range, while the radiative lifetime in the QW was linear with T.
On this account, the PL lifetime curves are fitted by the bi-exponential decay after eliminating the effect of the instrument response function (IRF), I1(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(2)where I1 is the PL intensity, τ is the lifetime, and A is the weight factor. The average lifetime τPL is taken as the lifetime.41 τPL = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/A1τ1 + A2τ2(3) The PL lifetime is determined by the radiative lifetime (τr) and nonradiative lifetime (τnr) via τPL−1 = τr−1 + τnr−1(4) The radiative and nonradiative lifetimes also determine the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) via (5) Assuming that the nonradiative channel is not activated at a low temperature of 15 K (so τnr is infinite and η = 1), the IQE at certain temperature is usually taken as42 (6)where I is the integrated PL intensity. From Fig. 2b, one can find that the IQE gradually decreases with increasing temperature due to the thermal activation of nonradiative recombination channels, and is calculated to be 16.3% at room temperature. This value is comparable to that of solution-processed 3D perovskite films (∼20%, ref. 5), and is higher than those of GaN (∼6%, ref. 43) and ZnO (9.6%, ref. 44) films which are famous light-emitting semiconductors. However, there is still room for improvement by suppressing nonradiative defects. The temperature dependencies of IQE for peaks 1–3 are implied by the PL integrated intensity in Fig. S2 (ESI†). From eqn (4)–(6), τr and τnr can be obtained: (7) (8) We note that the above equations assume temperature-independent optical absorption, which is reasonable for most semiconductors that do not undergo phase transition within the analysed temperature region. Such an assumption is further supported by the slight difference between the low temperature and room temperature absorption coefficients reported in PEPI thin films.32 In this way, the dependence of the exciton radiative lifetime on temperature is assessed and plotted in Fig. 4b. It is worth mentioning that τr values for peaks 2 and 3 in the temperature range of 80–180 K are not included due to their serious overlapping. Obviously, τr of peak 2 follows the T1 trend very well, exhibiting a typical feature of a localized exciton consistent with the results revealed in Fig. S2b (ESI†).
Besides, the three emission peaks display various temperature dependence of τr (Fig. 4b), in spite of the similar decrease tendency of τnr as the temperature increases (Fig. S4, ESI†). In the case of peak 1, τr is almost not dependent on temperature at all, very similar to the 0D case.35 The slight decrease of τr at high temperatures (>180 K) can be attributed to the increase of the dielectric constant, because τr is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant. As a result, peak 1 is considered as recombination of 0D-like excitons, which are possibly localized near the Pb clusters as indicated by XPS characterization (Fig. 1b).
When referring to the emission that appears around 2.30 eV (close to peak 3) at low temperatures, Shimizu et al.45 attributed the emission to tri-excitons, whereas Chong et al.18 suggested a surface bound biexcitonic origin. However, those findings certainly need not correspond to peak 3 in our study due to its single excitonic behavior. Moreover, peak 3 shows abnormal temperature dependence of the emission energy. At low temperatures, it increases with increasing temperature as expected for the band gap of lead perovskites. At temperatures above 100 K, however, it decreases markedly for ∼80 meV. The abnormal decrease is indicative of unique electron–phonon interaction. It is well known that the temperature dependence of the band gap energy is relevant to two factors: the renormalization of the band gap energy by the electron–phonon interaction, and the variation of the band gap energy with changing lattice constant. In most semiconductors, the electron–phonon interaction is often regarded as the only important term.35,46 For peak 3, the temperature dependence of the band gap energy (Fig. 3) is utilized to determine this effect, using a model consisting of two Bose–Einstein oscillators represented by: (9)where E0 is the “bare” band gap energy, E1 + E2 is the net renormalization energy at T = 0 K, and f1 and f2 are the energies of the two oscillators. The parameters obtained from the best fit (solid line in Fig. 3) are E0 = 2.44 eV, f1 = 15.8 meV, f2 = 13.0 meV, E1 = −487.1 meV, and E2 = 353.7 meV. The results suggest that oscillator 1 is responsible for the abnormal decrease, Fig. 3. We note that the temperature-dependencies of peak 1 and peak 2 are also affected by the Bose–Einstein oscillator effect,46,47 but with different parameters from those of peak 3. The difference is believed to have originated from the different electron–phonon couplings. As one can clearly see, the Stokes shift of peak 3 is much larger than that of peak 1 and peak 2, suggesting that the coupling between electrons and local phonons (vibration mode around the defect centers) is highly probable. The actual mechanism awaits further studies.
On the other hand, recently, Wu et al.48 performed a direct experimental probe of charge and exciton traps in both 3D and 2D lead iodide perovskites. According to their research, the excitonic traps became more significant as the dimensionality decreased from 3D lead iodide perovskites to their corresponding 2D counterparts. They hypothesized that the excitonic traps were likely to come from the self-trapping of band-edge excitons since the 2D system was a marginal case and possessed lower activation energy for self-trapping. Therefore, the electron–phonon effect of peak 3 mentioned above is considered to originate from the self-trapped excitons. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to gain a better understanding of this process, especially the unusual drop that appeared in its τr with increasing temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, comprehensive PL investigations are performed on PEPI crystals prepared using a layered solution method to gain a better understanding of their excitonic performance and luminescence origin. Temperature and excitation power-dependencies of the PL spectra offer a new insight into the excitonic properties of this hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductor. The synthesized PEPI crystals exhibit three single excitonic emissions in low-temperature PL spectra, centered at 2.36 eV (peak 1), 2.33 eV (peak 2), and 2.30 eV (peak 3). Combined with their temperature dependence of radiative lifetime, the luminescence origin of the three emissions has been identified: peak 1 originates from QD-like excitons, peak 2 arises from 2D localized excitons, and peak 3 is likely from self-trapped excitons. Thanks to the self-assembled QW structure as well as strong excitonic nature, we believe our study may shed light upon the luminescence mechanism and potential optoelectronic applications of 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Structural and optical characterization of PEPI powders fabricated by a layered solution process: powder XRD pattern (a), XPS core level spectra of Pb (b), I (c), and N (d) elements, and room temperature steady state absorption and PL emission spectra (e). The inset in (e) shows the estimation of the material bandgap and exciton binding energy.	 

 	Fig. 2  PL spectroscopy on PEPI crystals under 405 nm excitation. (a) Low-temperature PL emission spectrum with fitting at 15 K; (b) temperature-dependent PL emission spectra ranging from 15 to 300 K; (c) excitation fluence dependent PL spectra at 15 K. The inset presents a magnification of the spectra under the lowest three excitation fluences. The maximal excitation fluence is ∼4 nJ cm−2. (d) Logarithm plot of the integrated PL intensity versus excitation fluence. The data show the power-law dependence with k = 1.011, 0.994, and 0.990 for peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
