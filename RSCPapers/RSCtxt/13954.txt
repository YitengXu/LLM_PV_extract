    , Accepted 25th January 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) are viable power sources for photovoltaic applications. In this work, a non-fullerene acceptor, PDI-EH, was designed to form a nearly orthogonal structure to suppress its aggregation, and integrated into ternary OSCs. In addition to enhanced photon absorption and matched charge cascade, a PDI-EH acceptor modulated the morphology, which is crucial to affect device efficiency. Detailed analysis revealed that PDI-EH can fine-tune the miscibility of the host donor and acceptor (D/A) materials to form an optimally intermixed phase with short-range molecular order. Photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) for selective PiFM imaging of D/A materials provided strong evidence that D/A materials formed well-mixed films after PDI-EH incorporation. Additionally, nanoscale spatial mapping of charge carrier dynamics was realized for the first time in a ternary film using a novel transient photo-response atomic force microscopy (TP-AFM) technique. The resulting TP-AFM data revealed a reduced charge transport time, increased charge recombination lifetime and extended charge diffusion length. These improvements brought about by PDI-EH benefit the photovoltaic performance of ternary OSCs under both 1-sun and indoor illuminations. Our work offers insights into morphology modulation and the resulting local charge carrier dynamic, thereby facilitating the development of OSCs in practical applications.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered one of the most promising technologies for utilizing solar energy in wearable electronics and indoor power generation devices, due to their light weight, flexibility, ease of processing, compatibility with large-scale fabrication (e.g. roll-to-roll processing) and short energy payback time.1,2 Since Heeger and Wudl's concept of ‘bulk heterojunction’ (BHJ) OSCs comprising of a phase-separated mixture of donor and acceptor molecules in 1995,3 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ-OSCs have grown tremendously through the design of new organic donor/acceptor (D/A) materials and device architectures, now exceeding 18%.4–6 Further improvements, however, will be extremely challenging and require the simultaneous enhancement of photon absorption, exciton generation and dissociation, and charge transport to improve the key performance parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF)). Significant efforts have been expended in design and synthesis of new D/A materials with complementary absorption and well-matched energy level alignment so as to maximize the photon harvesting and charge transfer.7,8 Besides, the optimization of the BHJ morphology in the blend film is also crucial and cannot be neglected, since the optimal morphology with suitable phase separation, proper domain size (10–20 nm), high domain purity and interpenetrating nanostructures is of vital importance for effective photo-generated charge carrier dynamics, which are directly correlated with device performance.9
Many factors including the molecular properties of materials, D/A ratios and post-treatment processing influence the crystallinity, miscibility and molecular stacking in the blend film, resulting in different BHJ morphologies.10 Unfortunately, the lack of common approaches for quantitative analysis of polymer crystallinity and the structural complexity of polymer composites, as well as inconsistent classifications for the molecular ordering of polymer donors in the literature lead to imprecise interpretation of morphologic results. Ade et al.11 classified the molecular ordering of polymers by combining grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and proposed a consistent terminology: amorphous, oriented amorphous, highly disordered, paracrystalline and crystalline. Among them, amorphous polymers and highly disordered polymers both have no observable endothermal melting temperature (Tm) in DSC scans. However, the amorphous polymers exhibit a glass transition temperature (Tg) and no obvious pattern other than halo scattering in GIWAXS, while highly disordered polymers have no Tg due to the rigidity of the conjugated backbones, but often have a (100) lamellar peak and a (010) π–π stacking peak without any higher order (h00) peaks. The clear interpretation and classification of polymer crystallization are essential for understanding the complex morphology of OSCs and its effects on the device performance.
In most BHJ OSCs, an amorphous/highly disordered polymer donor usually displays good miscibility with small molecular acceptors, and forms a two-phase morphology consisting of mixed phases with suppressed crystallization of the small molecular acceptor and pure acceptor aggregates. A crystalline polymer donor shows low miscibility with the acceptor and facilitates the formation of three-phase morphology including donor aggregates, acceptor aggregates and a mixed phase.10,12 Because of the short exciton diffusion length (∼5–15 nm) in organic semiconductors, manipulating the composition of the mixed phase can generate the proper domain size (10–20 nm), thus favoring exciton diffusion into the donor and acceptor interface, and dissociation. It should be noted that too low or too high miscibility of D/A materials can degrade photovoltaic performance by forming large-scale phase separations or fully mixed D/A structures, which are detrimental to exciton dissociation and charge transport, respectively. However, there is no quantitative information about what miscibility is required for optimal morphology. Considering the high relevance between the miscibility and morphology, empirically fine-tuning the miscibility remains critical for achieving the optimal morphology and device performance of OSCs based on given D/A materials. Incorporating an additional component to construct ternary OSCs is a convenient strategy for fine tuning miscibility and morphology of OSCs. Among various potential “third components”, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) seem most promising because of their wide tunability of chemical structures and properties. When well designed, they can help adjust the miscibility of host D/A materials for regulation of the phase separation at the nanoscale, and moreover, extend the spectral absorption for harvesting more photons and form the cascade-structural energy levels for efficient charge transfer.13–15
In this work, we chose a PBDB-T donor and ITIC-4F acceptor (Fig. 1a) to serve as host photoactive layer materials in ternary OSCs due to their extraordinary photo-stability approaching 10 years.16 It was suggested that the high energy offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels between the PBDB-T donor and ITIC-4F acceptor (ΔELUMO = DLUMO − ALUMO) is detrimental for exciton dissociation.17,18 The ternary blend strategy can help to solve this problem by forming a cascade energy alignment, and then increasing the photovoltage. In addition, a judicious selection of the guest material can fine-tune the miscibility of the components and the morphology of the film, improving the charge separation and transport.

Here, we synthesized an organic solvent-soluble diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) small molecule with appended ethylhexyl (EH) substituted N-annulated perylenediimide (PDI) end capping units. This molecule named PDI-EH exhibits a highly twisted confirmation with the PDI units out-of-plane from the DPP core. The compound was incorporated as the third component into the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F blend film to fabricate ternary OSCs. The PDI-EH acceptor improves the absorption of the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F film and forms a cascade of energy levels, resulting in harvesting of more photons and increasing of the photovoltage of OSCs. Equally importantly, the PDI-EH acceptor fine-tunes the miscibility of the D/A components, leading to an appropriately mixed phase, as suggested by Flory–Huggins interaction parameters and supported by DSC measurements. Combined with the results of GIWAXS measurements, it shows that PDI-EH incorporation promotes local short-range molecular ordering in an appropriately mixed phase, which can produce fewer morphological defects and crystal boundaries to inhibit charge recombination. In particular, a novel, lab-made transient photo-response atomic force microscopy (TP-AFM) was used for the first time in ternary OSCs for the nanoscale spatial mapping of charge carrier dynamics to reveal improved charge transport and reduced charge recombination due to the optimized morphology by introducing PDI-EH. As a result, the introduction of PDI-EH led to improved performance of OSCs under 1-sun, and indoor 2700 K and 6500 K LED illuminations with an efficiency enhancement of 12%, 14% and 16%, respectively.
Results and discussion
PDI derivatives are promising candidates for electron acceptors in OSCs due to their high electron-affinity and outstanding stability.19 However, the strong aggregation tendency of PDI derivatives results in the formation of large crystalline domains, inhibiting charge separation. Such a strong aggregation of polycyclic aromatic molecules could often be suppressed by distorting their backbone.20,21 Thus, we synthesized a highly twisted PDI-EH acceptor featuring PDI terminal units separated by a DPP core based on our previous approach,22,23 and its synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1† and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra can be found in Fig. S9–10 (ESI†). The molecular structure of PDI-EH is presented in Fig. 1a. As predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d)), the PDI and DPP units are nearly orthogonal (φ = 87°) to each other in the optimized geometry (Fig. 1b). Such a conformation is expected to hinder intermolecular π-stacking and suppress aggregation. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO wavefunction densities are distributed almost exclusively on the DPP and PDI units, respectively. Therefore, electron transport of PDI-EH is expected to take place through LUMO orbital couplings from π-stacked PDI terminal units. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements found the HOMO and LUMO levels of PDI-EH at −5.27 and −3.63 eV, respectively, by comparison with ferrocene/ferrocenium oxidation (Fc+/Fc assumed at −4.80 eV, Fig. S1, ESI†). These energy levels are positioned between the HOMO/LUMO levels of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F (−5.21/−3.41 eV and −5.66/−4.14 eV, respectively), allowing formation of an energy cascade (Fig. 1c).24,25 The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of pristine donor and acceptors films are displayed in Fig. 1d. It shows that the absorption of PDI-EH at 415–550 nm compensates for the weak absorption of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F films in this spectral range.
Considering the potential benefits of the molecular design of PDI-EH and the rational combination of these three components, we moved forward to fabricate devices with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag.19 The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the binary and ternary devices with different contents of PDI-EH (10%, 20%, and 50%) were measured under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 1e). The increased Voc in all the ternary OSCs with respect to that of binary OSCs is consistent with the formation of the cascade structure. In addition, the ternary device incorporated with 10% PDI-EH led to the best PCE of 10.6% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 21.17 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.1% (Table 1). In contrast, 20% and 50% PDI-EH introduction into active layers reduced Jsc and FF, but increased Voc, causing an overall decrease in the device performance. In particular, the device with 50% PDI-EH gave the worst performance with dramatically reduced Jsc and FF, which is very likely due to an inappropriate morphology formed due to the full mixing of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F, to be discussed later on. As shown in Fig. 1f, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the 10% PDI-EH-based ternary device was enhanced in a wavelength range of 450–590 nm, which is in line with the absorption feature of the PDI-EH acceptor.

Since the performance of OSCs is determined by many factors, including, but not limited to absorption and energy levels, the contribution of PDI-EH is worth further investigation. Among different factors, morphology is an important one, since it is directly related to exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination. Appropriate morphology of the active layer could favor exciton dissociation and charge transport, which can be driven by the miscibility of the donor and acceptor. Contact angle measurements were conducted to investigate the miscibility of the donor and acceptor. The surface energies (γ) of PBDB-T, ITIC-4F and PDI-EH films were calculated to be 21.1 mN m−1, 32.3 mN m−1 and 26.6 mN m−1, respectively, via the contact angle data of water and ethylene glycol (EG) on these pristine films.26,27 The contact angles and surface energies are displayed in Fig. 2 and Table 2. Based on the equation of , where γ1 and γ2 refer to the surface energies of the PBDB-T donor and acceptors, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) was estimated to be 1.21, 0.31 and 0.29 for the PBDB-T donor with ITIC-4F, PDI-EH, and ITIC-4F/PDI-EH acceptors, respectively.27,28 These values suggest that the PBDB-T donor has good miscibility with the PDI-EH acceptor. Moreover, compared to the χ value of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F, the χ value of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F/PDI-EH decreases to 1.02, suggesting that PDI-EH can increase the miscibility of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F.

DSC measurements were performed to explore the effect of PDI-EH incorporation on the crystallization and miscibility of the PBDB-T donor and ITIC-4F acceptor in blend films. The first DSC heating-scan profiles of pristine and blend films are shown in Fig. 3a. The PBDB-T polymer had no obvious thermal transition peaks due to its amorphous or highly disordered characteristics, and thus, in our system, the PBDB-T polymer is conducive to exist in the mixed phase.11 On the other hand, ITIC-4F and PDI-EH small molecule acceptors showed distinct endothermic peaks at 322 °C and 343 °C, respectively. Notably, after a sharp endothermic peak at 322 °C, ITIC-4F had a broad exothermic peak at 331 °C, indicative of the melting and recrystallization processes.29 Besides, the ITIC-4F in the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F binary blend underwent the same thermodynamic process as the neat ITIC-4F, judging from their similar thermal transition peaks. Also, the binary blend showed a distinct and sharp endothermic peak at 316 °C, which indicated that the ITIC-4F in the binary blend featured considerable crystallization. Compared to the binary blend, ternary blends containing 10% and 20% PDI-EH exhibited the exothermal cold crystallization temperatures (Tcc) of ITIC-4F at 205 °C and 214 °C, respectively. The exothermic cold crystallization behavior took place before the melting temperature, indicating the crystallization of the initially amorphous phase and defect-rich crystal rearrangement.30–32 The enthalpies of the cold crystallization peak (ΔHcc) and the endothermal peak (ΔHm) of ternary blends showed thatthe ΔHcc of 10% and 20% PDI-EH-containing blends (29.7 and 25.8 J g−1, respectively) was more than half of their ΔHm (59.2 and 49.3 J g−1 respectively). It may be interpreted that the crystallization of ITIC-4F was hindered by the PBDB-T polymer matrix due to enhanced miscibility between PBDB-T and ITIC-4F after PDI-EH incorporation.32 Furthermore, the Tcc and the Tm disappeared after 50% PDI-EH incorporation due to the overmixing of ITIC-4F and PBDB-T, which led to no detectable ITIC-4F crystallites in the DSC scan. This morphology may increase charge recombination, which leads to the large deterioration of the efficiency of the 50% PDI-EH-containing ternary device.

Two-dimensional (2D)-GIWAXS measurements were conducted to better understand the film microstructure. 2D-GIWAXS patterns of pristine and blend films and the related 1D out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) curves are displayed in Fig. 3b–e and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The pristine PBDB-T film showed a lamellar (100) peak in the IP direction at q = 0.29 Å−1, a lamellar (100) peak in the OOP direction at q = 0.26 Å−1 and a π–π stacking (010) peak in the OOP direction at q = 1.67 Å−1, indicating that the PBDB-T polymer formed both edge-on and face-on orientations with respect to the substrate.17,33 Although PBDB-T exhibited distinct scattering peaks in the 2D-GIWAXS pattern, the lack of Tm and Tg in its DSC profile still points to a global disorder (i.e. lack of long-range order), according to the classification of Ade et al.11 Pristine ITIC-4F and PDI-EH films presented broad and isotropic diffraction scattering in the 2D-GIWAXS patterns (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†), which suggests that ITIC-4F and PDI-EH acceptors had no preferential orientation. It is well-known that the π–π stacking (010) in the OOP of blend films can be beneficial for charge transport.34–36 Comparing the 2D-GIWAXS of the binary and ternary films (Fig. 3b–e), intensities of π–π stacking (010) peaks in the OOP of ternary films were found to obviously increase. In addition, the coherence length (Lc) can be measured from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM ) of the (010) diffraction peak by using Scherrer's equation to reveal the size of coherently diffracting regions.37–40Lc values associated with the OOP (010) peak were calculated to be 20.4 Å, 19.9 Å and 19.7 Å for ternary films containing 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH, respectively, which are larger than that of the binary film (16.2 Å), indicating that the PDI-EH incorporation could improve the local π–π stacking short molecular order. By understanding the effect of PDI-EH on the miscibility and molecular ordering through the results of DSC and 2D-GIWAXS measurements, we presented the schematic illustration of the morphology of blend films in Fig. 3f–h. The binary film showed a relatively large volume of crystalline ITIC-4F and relatively low miscibility (Fig. 3f), leading to the formation of more acceptor aggregates and less mixed phase, which is not conducive to exciton dissociation at the donor and acceptor interface. Conversely, the 50% PDI-EH-containing ternary film presented high miscibility with the overmixing of the donor and acceptors (Fig. 3h), thereby increasing charge recombination and decreasing the device FF. Accordingly, the moderate miscibility achieved by introducing 10% PDI-EH favored the charge separation and suppressed charge recombination, and PDI-EH incorporation simultaneously induced short-range molecular order of the PBDB-T polymer, facilitating charge transport, as schematically presented in Fig. 3g. We also include the 20% sample into this category of ‘moderate miscibility’, because ITIC-4F still showed observable crystallinity, similar to that of the 10% sample and distinctively different from that of the 50% sample based on DSC measurements. Nevertheless, the photovoltaic performance of the 20% blend under AM 1.5 illumination was slightly weaker than that of the binary device, highlighting the performance's sensitivity to the film morphology and importance of morphology fine tuning.
The surface morphology of the active layer was explored by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ternary films containing 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH showed uniform morphology and reduced root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values (2.47 nm, 2.56 nm and 2.95 nm, respectively), compared to the binary film (3.37 nm), attributed to the increased miscibility after PDI-EH incorporation (Fig. S3, ESI†). The slightly lower RMS values for the 10% PDI-EH blend is consistent with a more uniform morphology, as could be expected based on the observed higher Jsc and FF values than other cases. In addition, AFM topography images of the binary film and ternary films exhibited distinct fibril-like morphology, which was believed to mainly consist of the fibrous skeleton of the PBDB-T donor mixed with acceptors, based on the observation of the distinct fibril-like morphology of the pristine PBDB-T film and no obvious phase-separated morphology of two acceptors from the AFM topography and phase images (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the pristine PBDB-T film exhibited distinct fibril-like morphology, which could provide a channel to promote hole transport. Meanwhile, the decreased roughness of acceptor-only blend films suggests that PDI-EH and ITIC-4F acceptors could form an intermixed phase due to their excellent miscibility, which can speed up the electron transport from the LUMO level of PBDB-T to ITIC-4F through the PDI-EH acceptor as a bridge in the ternary film.
To further explore the distribution and compatibility of materials in the active layer, advanced photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) coupling AFM with infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used, allowing the characterization of the distribution of different components in the blend film with a high spatial resolution.15 The topography images of the binary and ternary films (10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH), and corresponding PiFM spectra are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The blend films displayed similar PiFM spectra taken from ten locations in the corresponding topography image, indicating relatively good mixing of the donor and acceptors. The non-overlapping peaks of PBDB-T at 1641 cm−1 (the benzoquinone group of PBDB-T)41–43 and ITIC-4F at 1540 cm−1 (stretching of the CC bond)44 were chosen for PiFM imaging of the distribution of these two components, which allowed study of the degree of component mixing. PiFM images from the same area in Fig. 4a–p, highlighting the distribution of PBDB-T imaged at 1641 cm−1 and ITIC-4F at 1540 cm−1, yielded a similar fibrous feature. The ITIC-4F-based binary image of the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F blend film (Fig. 4m) showed an uneven fiber size (as marked by the red rectangle) attributed to ITIC-4F aggregates, while the PDI-EH introduction facilitated the formation of a more uniform dispersion of ITIC-4F (Fig. 4j–l) due to better mixing of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F, which is supported by the above results of DSC and 2D-GIWAXS. This point is even more apparent from the superimposed images (Fig. 4q–t) based on the distribution of the PBDB-T donor (green area) and ITIC-4F acceptor (red area). In Fig. 4q, the superimposed PiFM image of the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F blend film showed relatively low mixing along with distinct ITIC-4F aggregates (red area), compared to that of ternary films. Thus, these observations showed the delicate tuning of the morphology with the introduction of PDI-EH.

Morphology variation can be directly reflected from charge transport and recombination behavior. Thus, we conducted space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements to study the charge carrier mobility of blend films and to correlate it with morphology and superior performance of the optimized ternary device. J–V curves of hole-only devices and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 5a and b. Hole/electron mobilities of binary and 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary devices were estimated to be 1.2 × 10−4/4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 10−4/5.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, based on the Mott–Gurney square law equation.45,46 According to the charge mobility parameters summarized in Table S1,† it is clear that 10% PDI-EH introduction would contribute to improving electron mobility and achieving the most balanced charge carrier mobility μh/μe = 2.8 (vs. 3.0 for the binary device, 3.8 for the 20% PDI-EH ternary device, and 18.4 for the 50% PDI-EH ternary device), which explained its higher Jsc value. Furthermore, 10% PDI-EH proved beneficial for increasing the exciton dissociation possibility of the ternary device from 94.4% to 95.6% as revealed by plotting the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph − Veff) plots (Fig. S6, ESI†). This balanced charge carrier mobility and increased exciton dissociation of 10% PDI-EH blends should result from their optimal morphology.
 Fig. 5  (a) Hole mobility and (b) electron mobility for the binary blend film and ternary blend films containing 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH; (c) the dependence of Jsc on Plight, and (d) the dependence of Voc on Plight for the binary blend film and ternary blend films containing 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH. 
We explored the charge recombination dynamics according to the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) as well as that between Voc and Plight (Fig. 5c and d).7,8 The relationship of Jsc and Plight could be expressed by using an equation of Jsc ∝ Plightα. The 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary device showed a higher α value of 0.99, compared to the α value of binary device (0.98), suggesting that 10% PDI-EH introduction can effectively reduce bimolecular recombination. Moreover, ternary devices with 20% and 50% PDI-EH with reduced α values of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively, indicated increased bimolecular recombination. Thus, significantly unbalanced charge mobility and much lower α values of the ternary device containing 50% PDI-EH proved that too much PDI-EH introduction could induce excessive mixing of donor and acceptors, and thus reduced charge transport and increased bimolecular recombination. Additionally, the dependence of Voc on the Plight for the binary and ternary devices containing 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH was measured with a slope of 1.33, 1.14, 1.24 and 1.38 KT/q, respectively. The smallest slope of the 10% PDI-based ternary device suggested that trap-assisted recombination can be suppressed due to ideal miscibility, complying well with the high Jsc and FF values.47 After introducing 20% and 50% PDI-EH, the slopes were gradually increased, which is consistent with their surface morphology in AFM measurements. The results confirmed that the 10% sample showed both decreased bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, suggesting its better morphology under the moderate D/A mixing condition.
Transient photo-response AFM (TP-AFM) with high spatial resolution (∼9.26 nm by the actual measurement) was further conducted to gain insights into the charge carrier dynamics by nanoscale visualization and mapping of the charge carrier recombination lifetime (τr), charge carrier transport time (τt) and charge carrier diffusion length (LD) with a correlation to the influence of PDI-EH incorporation on nanoscale morphology.48 A green laser (532 nm) pulse with temporal resolution that reaches nanosecond as an excitation source was directed through the bottom of an inverted structure ITO glass/ZnO/active layer to generate charge carriers. Current sensing AFM (C-AFM) was employed to record the topography and current images of the binary film and the optimal ternary film containing 10% PDI-EH to distinguish the donor-rich and acceptor-rich regions, where the donor-rich regions were associated with less conductive regions, whereas acceptor-rich regions were related to more conductive regions.49,50 The C-AFM images of the binary and 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary films and related topography images are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), where red rectangle regions (100 nm × 100 nm) were used to map charge carrier dynamics by collecting the local transient photovoltage (TPV) decays using 1.0 MΩ input impedance from an oscilloscope and transient photocurrent (TPC) decays using 50 Ω input impedance. Fig. 6 displays the nanoscale mapping of τr, τt, and LD, where the white dashed lines were presented to show the donor-rich regions and acceptor-rich regions. The τr value can be obtained by fitting TPV decays based on the mono-exponential model (eqn (1)), which is related to trap-assisted charge recombination,39 and τt can be acquired by fitting TPC decays based on eqn (2). (1) (2)where V0 and I0 are the steady-state photovoltage and photocurrent, respectively. Fig. 6a and b show TP-AFM nanoscale mapping of τr for the binary and 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary films. Also, the histogram distribution of τr for the binary film and ternary film from the mapping in red rectangles is shown in Fig. S8a and d (ESI†). The average τr value for the binary film was 9.11 ± 0.14 μs and ∼25% of τr values > 9.20 μs, while the average τr value for the 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary film was increased to 9.22 ± 0.15 μs and ∼50% of τr values > 9.20 μs. It suggested that trap-assisted charge recombination was suppressed due to smoother morphology driven by the fine-tuned moderate miscibility after PDI-EH incorporation. Based on Fig. 6c and d, the average τt value was decreased from 9.04 ± 0.23 μs for the binary film to 8.41 ± 0.10 μs for the 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary film. Moreover, the τt mapping of the ternary film (Fig. 6d) presented an obviously smaller τt distribution and all τt values in the histogram < 8.80 μs, while ∼90% of τt values > 8.80 μs for the binary film, which is attributed to the formation of local short-range molecular packing in appropriately mixed phases after 10% PDI-EH incorporation, significantly favoring charge transport. Therefore, the LD value can be calculated by using the formula (eqn (3)) (3)where L is the thickness of the active layer. The ternary film containing 10% PDI-EH showed a longer LD (the average value of 68.3 ± 0.7 nm) than that (65.5 ± 1.0 nm) of the binary film. It can be noted that the main distribution (∼72%) of LD values for the binary film was smaller than 66.0 nm, but for the 10% PDI-EH-containing ternary film, ∼83% of LD values were larger than 67.5 nm. The obviously increased charge diffusion length results from an ordered molecular packing. Thus, 10% PDI-EH incorporation provides beneficial charge carrier dynamics, leading to enhanced device efficiency in OSCs.

We also tested the performance of the developed OSCs under indoor illumination. Indoor power generation devices are considered to be important for rapidly advancing Internet-of-Things applications and replacing/reducing the use of batteries.45,51 In this work, a warm light 2700 K LED and cold light 6500 K LED were used and their emission spectra are shown in Fig. 7a, with which the combined UV-vis absorption of PBDB-T, ITIC-4F and PDI-EH was expected to form an excellent match. Notably, the major absorption band of PDI-EH compensated for the weak absorption of PBDB-T and ITIC-4F from 415 nm to 550 nm, which favors more photon harvesting from LED illumination. Besides, as mentioned above, the charge cascade structure is also advantageous for the increase of Voc in indoor OSCs (iOSCs). Therefore, the photovoltaic performance of PBDB-T/ITIC-4F based binary and ternary devices was characterized under a warm light 2700 K LED with 300 μW cm−2 power input and a cold light 6500 K LED with 310 μW cm−2 power input. J–V curves of the devices under these LED illuminations are shown in Fig. 7b and c and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2.† Ternary devices containing 10% and 20% PDI-EH under 2700 K LED illumination displayed better PCEs of 11.4% and 12.0% compared to the binary device (10.3%). It is worth mentioning that the 20% PDI-EH devices performed slightly better than the 10% PDI-EH devices mainly due to a higher Voc, because they basically represented similar Jsc values (99 μA cm−2vs. 100 μA cm−2) and FF values (63% vs. 65%). Under 1-sun illumination, a morphology with an appropriately mixed phase is crucial to suppress the bimolecular and trap-assisted charge recombination. However, under indoor (low-light) illuminations, the much lower photocurrent density makes bimolecular recombination less probable.2,52 Therefore, trap-assisted charge recombination associated with the leakage current can more significantly affect the efficiency in iOSCs. Furthermore, efficiencies of binary and ternary devices under 6500 K LED illumination had a consistent trend with that of devices under 2700 K LED illumination, where PCEs of the binary device and ternary devices with 10%, 20% and 50% PDI-EH were 9.9%, 10.6%, 11.5% and 7.6%, respectively. It can be inferred that these ternary OSCs will have greater applicability as indoor devices. It may also be noticed that the OSC performance under 6500 K LED illumination was slightly lower compared to that under 2700 K LED illumination, which may be explained by a better match between the spectral features of the latter and the major absorption bands of the host donor and acceptor (Fig. 7a), which results in higher photocurrent density. It can be concluded that the introduction of a PDI-EH acceptor also has a positive influence on the indoor application of these OSCs, with the moderately mixed sample (20%) leading to the best performance. The indoor studies reveal that the photovoltaic performance depends on the complicated interplay of multiple factors. Depending on the exact conditions of indoor and outdoor applications, the morphology of a given D/A system needs to be respectively optimized, and thus the fine-tuning of morphology can play an important role in performance optimization under different operation conditions.

Conclusion
A highly twisted PDI-EH molecule was synthesized and introduced into the PBDB-T/ITIC-4F film to prepare ternary OSCs, which were applied in versatile photovoltaic applications under AM 1.5 G conditions, and indoor 2700 K and 6500 K LED lamps. The donor and acceptors in the blend film exhibited low, moderate and high miscibility by adjusting the contents of the PDI-EH introduction. It proved that moderate miscibility of the donor and acceptors facilitates the formation of an appropriately mixed phase for effective exciton dissociation. Meanwhile, introducing PDI-EH into blend films would promote the favorable face-on orientation and local short-range ordered molecular packing, favoring charge mobility and inhibiting charge recombination, as evidenced by GIWAXS studies and the observation of the charge carrier dynamics via TP-AFM nanoscale mappings. Finally, the synergistic effects in ternary OSCs (enhanced photon absorption, well-matched energy level alignment and optimized morphology) contribute to achieving higher photovoltaic performance under both outdoor and indoor illuminations. Our fundamental studies present promising guidance for the molecular design and morphological regulation of OSCs, thereby facilitating the development of OSCs in practical applications.
