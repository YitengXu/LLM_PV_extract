    , Accepted 15th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractIn this study we report the application of three cobalt redox shuttles in 100% aqueous electrolyte dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs). By using chloride as a counter-ion for cobalt bipyridine, cobalt phenanthroline and cobalt bipyridine pyrazole, the redox shuttles were made water soluble; no surfactant or further treatment was necessary. A simple system of merely the redox shuttles and 1-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) in water as an electrolyte in combination with an organic dye and a mesoporous PEDOT counter electrode was optimised. The optimisation resulted in an average efficiency of 5.5% (record efficiency of 5.7%) at 1 sun. The results of this study present promising routes for further improvements of aqueous cobalt electrolyte DSCs.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) have been the subject of extensive research for about 25 years. These are appealing devices for converting solar energy into electricity because they show high potential for low cost energy conversion.1 Typically, the DSC is built up of a working electrode consisting of a conductive glass substrate with a sensitised mesoporous TiO2 film, a counter electrode with a catalyst and, in between, the electrolyte which performs the charge transport by means of a redox mediator. Presently, the record state-of-the-art DSC uses volatile acetonitrile as the electrolyte solvent.2 However, acetonitrile is highly flammable, toxic and harmful both to human health and the environment, and therefore impractical for commercialisation. Alternatively, water is a more ideal solvent because it is less volatile, non-toxic, environmentally friendly, cheap and abundant.
The development of the DSC began during the 1970s.3–5 In early studies of DSCs, water was commonly used as the electrolyte solvent.4,5 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these early DCSs were very low. In 1991 there was a breakthrough when a PCE of 7.9% was reported with an ethylene carbonate/acetonitrile electrolyte.6 After 1990, several studies reported that water had a negative effect on the performance of DSCs,7–9 implying that water was poisonous for DSC efficiencies. Since then, most DSC studies abandoned the use of water, in favour of using organic solvents for the electrolyte. In 2010, O'Regan et al. showed that water content in organic iodide electrolyte DSCs was not necessarily bad for DSC performance. The low JSC was attributed to reduced current carrying capability of the electrolyte in the pores, not to fundamental problems with electron transfer kinetics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.10 In a follow-up study, it was shown that improving the wetting of the electrolyte inside the pores by the addition of chenodeoxylic acid yielded high efficiences. This led to a PCE of 4%, which was, at the time ∼5 times greater than the previous record for aqueous electrolyte DSCs.11 So far, the discussion pertains to aqueous iodide-based electrolytes.
For a long time iodide/triiodide was the record holding redox couple, but in 2010–2011 it was shown that cobalt redox couples could outperform iodide/triiodide,12,13 which has led to the 14.3% record of today.2 Iodide is disadvantageous for use in commercialisation application since it can promote the breakdown of passive oxide layers and corrode most metals.14–16 Compared to the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, the cobalt redox couple electrolyte exhibits much weaker absorption of visible light,17 which increases the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, unlike monolithic iodide/triiodide, cobalt complexes have chemically customisable structures. This allows for optimal tuning of the redox potential, making it compatible with a wider range of dye architectures.
In 2013, Spiccia and co-workers published the first article about the cobalt(II/III)tris(2,2′-bipyridine) aqueous electrolyte applied in a DSC.18 This was followed up by further improving the PCE to 5.6% by decreasing the recombination.19 However, the redox couple [Co(bpy)3](NO3)2/[Co(bpy)3](NO3)3 employed in these studies was solubilised by surfactants and heated at 60 °C. In this study we present cobalt redox couples with chloride as a counter-ion. Chloride as a counter-ion increases the solubility of these redox mediators in water compared to nitrate. In combination with water soluble cobalt redox couples, a PEDOT counter electrode,20 and an organic dye which interacts well with the aqueous electrolyte,21 we assemble a 100% aqueous electrolyte DSC without the addition of a surfactant. A final average PCE of 5.5% (record efficiency of 5.7%) at 1 sun is attained. This final efficiency was obtained by optimising for mass transport by using photocurrent transient measurements, and finding an optimum oxidised redox species concentration and an optimum distance between the working electrode and the counter electrode. In the end the cobalt(II/III)(6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple is used for boosting the VOC, and thereby attaining the maximum efficiency.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO)-coated glass substrates (TEC15 and TEC8, Pilkington), detergent solution (RBS 25, Fluka analytical), ethanol (VWR DBH Prolabo, 99.9% purity), TiO2 absorption paste (DSL 30NR-D, Dyesol), TiO2 scattering paste (WER2-O reflector, Dyesol), potassium chloride (KCl) (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) (Aldrich, 99.95% trace metal basis), Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, laboratory grade), LiClO4, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Aldrich, 99.9% and 96% purity, respectively), acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5% purity) and 1-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) were used as received. For spray pyrolysis, a solution of titanium isopropoxide (Aldrich, 97% purity), acetylacetone (Fluka Analytical, 99.5% GC purity) and 2-propanol (Fluka, LC-MS Chromasolv) was used. Cobalt(II/III)tris(2,2′-bipyridyl), cobalt(II/III)tris(1′,10-phenanthroline) and cobalt(II/III)(6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) (denoted hereafter as [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ and [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+) with chloride counter-ions were purchased from Dyenamo. The D51 dye21 was provided by Dr Haining Tian (Uppsala University) and the LEG4 dye was bought from Dyenamo.
2.2 Electrochemistry
The formal reduction potentials of the dyes  were determined by cyclic voltammetry in the dark using a potentiostat (IviumStat.XR, Ivium Technologies) with a three electrode system, working electrode (WE): dye-sensitised TiO2 films on FTO glass, counter electrode (CE): graphite rod and reference electrode (Ref): Ag|AgCl. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.05 M Triton in deionised water. The formal reduction potentials of the cobalt redox couples  were determined in similar manners but with the following electrodes WE: glassy carbon, CE: graphite rod, and Ref: Ag|AgCl. The electrolyte consisted of 1 mM [Co(bpy)3]Cl2/[Co(phen)3]Cl2/[Co(bpy-pz)3]Cl2 and 1 M KCl in deionised water. For calculating the formal reduction potentials versus NHE, the formal reduction potential of K3[Fe(CN)6] versus the Ref was measured, and K3[Fe(CN)6] was taken as 0.470 V versus NHE according to the literature.22
Diffusion coefficients were determined by measuring cyclic voltammograms at different scanning speeds and using the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (1)): ip = 2.68 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cν1/2(1)where ip is the current maximum (A), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event, A is the electrode area in cm2, D is the diffusion coefficient in cm2 s−1, C is the concentration in mol cm−3 and ν is the scan rate in V s−1. A three electrode system was used WE: glassy carbon, CE: graphite rod, and Ref: Ag|AgCl. The electrolytes consisted of 5 mM [Co(bpy)3]Cl2/[Co(phen)3]Cl2/[Co(bpy-pz)3]Cl2 and 0.5 M KCl in deionised water.
2.3 Fabrication of DSCs
The preparation of DSCs by our group has been described elsewhere.23–25 The only differences in the procedure were the working electrodes, which were covered by a compact layer of TiO2 (deposited by spray pyrolysis), and the first TiCl4-treatment (after the spray pyrolysis), which was carried out for 60 minutes. The spray pyrolysis was performed according to a published procedure.26 The total thickness of the screen printed working electrodes was about 7 μm. Electropolymerised PEDOT counter electrodes on FTO glass were prepared according to a published procedure.20,25
2.4 Characterisation of DSCs
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE), to an intensity of 1000 Wm−2. When performing the J–V measurements a black mask of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 was used in order to avoid significant additional contribution from light impinging on the device outside the active area (0.5 × 0.5 cm2).
The apparatus for incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) consisted of a computer-controlled setup with a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM 110) and a LabJack U6.
Electron lifetime measurements were performed using a white LED (Luxeon Star 1W) as a light source. The voltage and current signals were recorded using a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board (National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570) and a custom-made system using electromagnetic switches. Electron lifetimes were determined by monitoring photovoltage transients at different light intensities upon applying a small square wave light modulation to the base light intensity. The photovoltaic responses were fitted using first-order kinetics to obtain time constants.27
Photo-induced absorption (PIA) measurements were measured on a home built system, described elsewhere.28,29
2.5 Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements
A system of a ns-laser (Quanta Ray, Spectra Physics, St Clara, USA, pulse width 10 ns, 10 Hz), an Edinburgh Instruments LP920-K spectrometer and a Xe lamp (Xe900, Edinburgh Instruments) was used for transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements. The excitation pump intensity (532 nm) was attenuated with neutral density filters to 0.23 mJ pulse−1 cm−2, and excitation pump intensities in this range have been shown in earlier studies to generate intensity independent kinetics.23 The probe wavelength (780 nm) was chosen according to the oxidised dyes, D51+ and LEG4+ absorption spectra (see Fig. 5). For every signal 500 averages were taken. The samples for the TAS measurements were prepared in a similar way to that for cell fabrication. However, instead of using PEDOT counter electrodes, the samples were assembled with clean FTO glass. For investigating the recombination in water, an electrolyte of 1 M KNO3 in deionised water was used. The salt was added to imitate the ion strength around the dye in the solar cell. For the recombination in acetonitrile an electrolyte of 0.2 M TBP and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile was used; this is referred to as stock solution in Table 4. For the regeneration measurements in water, an electrolyte of 0.13 M [Co(phen)3]Cl2 and 0.8 M MBI in deionised water was applied, while in acetonitrile 0.20 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 in stock solution was used. The data were plotted and fitted to a double exponential decay function in Origin 9. The time constants obtained from the double exponential decay fitting were used for calculating weighted logarithmic averages,23 presented as τ-values in Table 4.
2.6 Photocurrent transients
Turn-on photocurrent transient measurements were performed under white LED illumination, short-circuit conditions and at room temperature. 9 different bias illuminations were measured: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2 and 3 sun. LED illumination was applied as a square-wave pulse: 1 s off, 5 s on and 0.5 s off. Light pulsing was synchronized with data acquisition using fast solid state switches, programmable power supplies and an in-house built robot interface.
2.7 Stability measurements
Stability measurements were performed using an in-house built maximum power point (MPP) tracking robot.30 1 sun equivalent illumination by a white LED was calibrated using a Si photodiode; the illumination intensity was calibrated to produce the same photocurrent as under AM1.5 solar simulator illumination. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C via fans and water-cooling. MPP voltage was tracked and applied, hourly. J–V values were measured every 5 hours, and scanned cyclically (10 mV voltage step and 0.1 V s−1 scan rate) from MPP voltage to +1.2 V, −0.1 V and returned.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characteristics of redox shuttles and dyes
The [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox shuttles have earlier been applied in acetonitrile-based electrolyte DSCs.12,17 In order to make these cobalt redox shuttles soluble in water, two approaches can be followed; adapting the ligands or changing the counter-ion. Changing the ligand was undesirable since it could lead to a more complex synthesis route (increased synthesis cost). The new complex could also, if moieties were added, become bigger and thereby generate greater mass transport problems. To keep the system and the synthesis route as simple as possible, the counter-ion was changed to chloride (Fig. 1), which improved the solubility of the Co2+ species compared to nitrate, see Table 1.

In order to achieve an efficient aqueous electrolyte DSC, the contact between the dye-sensitized TiO2 surface and the electrolyte needs to be good. This means that there should be wetting and that the contact angle should be as small as possible. Earlier studies have shown that co-sensitising with chenodeoxycholic acid (cheno) can increase the photocurrent. This is due to the hydroxy groups of the cheno, which are increasing the hydrophilicity of the sensitised TiO2 surface.11 However, also the dye in itself can be adapted in order to increase the wetting and photocurrent, by providing the dye with hydrophilic chains21,25 close to the regeneration center.31,32 The organic triphenylamine dyes D51 and LEG4 investigated in this study are seen in Fig. 2. The difference of the dyes is the length of the dialkoxyphenyl moieties on the triphenylamine unit. D51 has shorter dimethoxyphenyl moieties, while LEG4 has longer dibutoxyphenyl moieties. This is expected to affect the interaction with the water-based electrolyte since the shorter dimethoxyphenyl moieties are more hydrophilic compared to the dibutoxyphenyl moieties. Contact angles were measured for water and electrolytes on D51- and LEG4-sensitised TiO2 surfaces; D51 showed complete wetting with water and the electrolyte, while LEG4 had a contact angle of about 105° for water, and 48° for the electrolyte (Fig. S9, ESI†).

In Table 2, the formal reduction potentials of the dyes  and the redox couples  are tabulated (for cyclic voltammograms see Fig. S2–S5, ESI†). The  for the two dyes and the  for the two redox couples measured in water differ from the ones measured in organic solvent (the literature values for the dyes are measured in dichloromethane and the literature values for the redox shuttles are measured in acetonitrile). The reduction potentials in water are more negative, which is in line with earlier observations.33–35 The negative shift in reduction potential can be attributed to the stabilisation of the charged species enhanced by the higher dielectric constant of water (compared to acetonitrile and dichloromethane).36,37 The reduction potentials of the redox couples were measured by the same method as the ones taken from the literature; solution of redox species was used as an electrolyte when performing cyclic voltammetry.12,38 For the dyes however, the values measured in this study were obtained by using a dye-sensitised TiO2 film as the working electrode, while the values taken from the literature are obtained by measurements of cyclic voltammetry with dye in solvent (dichloromethane).21,22 The difference between the D51 and LEG4 values in dichloromethane taken from the literature could be due to differences in measuring techniques of different groups. The difference in reduction potentials for other organic triphenyl dyes with similar structures (D35 and D45) has not been shown to be very different (1.08 and 1.09 V versus NHE) when measured on dye-sensitised TiO2 films in acetonitrile.23

The diffusion coefficients of the reduced species of the redox shuttles were determined in water, and [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(phen)3]2+ showed diffusion coefficients of 3.6 × 10−6 cm s−1 and 2.5 × 10−6 cm s−1, respectively (Fig. S6–S8, ESI†). The results are in line with the trend in acetonitrile, the phenanthroline redox species has a smaller diffusion coefficient compared to bipyridine.12,17,38,39 The phenanthroline redox species is larger than the bipyridine and should therefore have slower diffusion, giving lower diffusion coefficients. The diffusion coefficients obtained in water are also smaller than the ones measured in acetonitrile. Hagfeldt et al. have measured diffusion coefficients of 9.1 × 10−6 cm s−1 and 8.2 × 10−6 cm s−1 for [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(phen)3]2+ in acetonitrile.12,38 The diffusion coefficient is proportional to the reciprocal of the dynamic viscosity according to the Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland equation, see eqn (2): (2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the dynamic viscosity and r is the radius of the spherical particle. With eqn (2) and the dynamic viscosities of water (0.89 mPa s) and acetonitrile (0.34 mPa s) applied, the determined diffusion coefficients in water compared to the ones in acetonitrile are reasonable.
3.2 DSC characterisation
Solar cells were assembled with cobalt electrolytes and an iodide electrolyte, see Table 3. The cobalt electrolyte concentrations were 0.13 M [Co(phen/bpy)3]Cl2, 0.04 M [Co(phen/bpy)3]Cl3 and 0.8 M MBI in deionised water. The iodide electrolyte consisted of 4 M KI and 20 mM I2 in deionised water (the bipyridine-based electrolyte is from here on labeled Co(bpy)3, phenanthroline Co(phen)3 and iodide I−/I3−). D51 in combination with the Co(phen)3 electrolyte renders the best PCE. This is due to the decreased recombination compared to the Co(bpy)3 electrolyte, which is shown by the higher VOC and longer electron lifetimes, Table 3 and Fig. 4. D51 renders higher currents compared to LEG4, which could be due to the wetting and regeneration kinetics being better for D51 compared to LEG4 (Fig. S9, ESI† and Table 4).23 One particular observation is the VOC values being the same for D51 and LEG4, even though the recombination values are shorter for D51 (Table 4). A study with a D51-similar dye and a LEG4-similar dye in acetonitrile has shown that the D51-similar dye has lower VOC values compared to the LEG4-similar dye.23 The reason for the same VOC values and electron lifetimes in this study could be the TiO2 compact layer, which affects the recombination. Both cobalt redox couples outperform the iodide electrolyte. LEG4 in combination with the iodide electrolyte is giving much lower PCE than the D51 and iodide electrolyte. This could be due to a complexation of iodine and the dye.40 The complexation causes a red shift in the absorption spectra, which is reflected in the IPCE spectra, see Fig. 3. It should be noted that the JV-characteristics tabulated in Table 3 are averages and obtained at 1 sun, while the IPCE data in Fig. 3 are single solar cell results and measured with monochromatic light at a light intensity of about 0.005 sun. These differences could explain small variations when comparing Table 3 and Fig. 3.

In the photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectra (Fig. 5) it can be seen that regeneration is taking place with both cobalt-based electrolytes. However, LEG4 in combination with iodide is not regenerating. Additionally, the ground state bleach and the stark effect, which is present for LEG4 and the cobalt-based redox shuttles, is replaced by a positive delta A signal. This could possibly be due to an intermediate of LEG4 and iodine.40

An advantage of using water as a solvent for the electrolyte in DSCs is that the conduction band in colloidal anatase TiO2 particles can be controlled by pH.41,42 A calculation of the pH values in the electrolytes was done using the concentration of MBI. Since the concentration of MBI is much greater than the concentration of the redox species, and since the difference in pH depending on the redox couples could be assumed to be minor, the MBI concentration was assumed to determine the pH of the electrolytes. MBI has a pKa value of 5.6,43 which is converted into a pKb value of 8.4. By using the definition of the equilibrium constant, a pH value of 9.75 was calculated. The position of the conduction band in our aqueous systems was calculated to be −0.84 V versus NHE.42 The LUMO of D51 has been determined to be −1.2 V versus NHE,21 the injection is therefore estimated to be efficient. Earlier studies have shown that electrolytes that are too basic can desorb dyes, this was not observed in this study.
A potential disadvantage of aqueous electrolytes is the possibility of water reduction as an unwanted side reaction. Using the Nernst equation, the formal potential for proton reduction is calculated to be −0.58 V versus NHE at pH 9.75. Although this is more positive compared to the TiO2 (anatase) conduction band potential, hydrogen evolution will not occur at the working electrode. The reason is the Fermi-level in the TiO2 being more positive, calculated to be −0.42 V versus NHE in the Co(phen)3 system and −0.30 V in the Co(bpy)3 system (at one sun, taking VOC values from Table 3). Therefore, no significant hydrogen evolution can occur under normal solar cell operation. The potential of the counter electrode will be nearly equal to the formal reduction potential of the electrolyte, at about 0.33 V vs. NHE, which is far more positive than the hydrogen evolution potential.
3.3 Kinetics and mass transport
In order to investigate whether the efficiency of the aqueous electrolyte DSC is limited by the regeneration process, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were performed (Fig. S12–S14, ESI†). The results of the TAS measurements are summarised in Table 4, where the derived regeneration and recombination weighted logarithmic average time constants (τ) are presented.23 The process of electrons recombining from the TiO2 to the oxidised dye is represented by the dye + salt or dye + stock solution values. Since no oxidised redox species are present, the electrons can only recombine to the oxidised dye. In the water-based system 1 M KNO3 is added to the recombination measurement electrolyte, in order to imitate the ion strength the dye is experiencing in the solar cell. In the acetonitrile-based system, 0.2 M TBP and 0.1 M LiClO4 are added for the same purpose. The process of the oxidised dye being reduced by the redox species, the regeneration, is presented by the dye + reduced redox species in acetonitrile or water as the solvent. It can be seen in Table 4 that the kinetics for the water-based system do not differ much from the kinetics for the acetonitrile-based system. The recombination τ-value in the water-based systems is about 40 μs, while in acetonitrile it is about 50 μs. The regeneration τ-value in water is about 1.5 μs, while in acetonitrile it is 3.5 μs. The kinetics in the water-based systems show the same trend, for the D51 and LEG4 dyes, as earlier shown in acetonitrile for D51- and LEG4-similar dyes (D45 and D35), both recombination and regeneration are faster for the dye with dimethoxyphenyl moieties on the triphenylamine unit (D51), compared to the one with the dibutoxyphenyl moieties (LEG4).23 The data in Table 4 show that the kinetic process of the regeneration is not the limiting factor for the water-based system, compared to the acetonitrile-based system. This since the regeneration of the water-based systems is in fact about 2 times faster compared to the acetonitrile-based system.
For investigating the mass transport in the solar cells, photocurrent transient measurements12,44,45 were performed at different light intensities, see Fig. 6 and 7. Measurements were performed on solar cells with the D51 dye and Co(phen)3 electrolyte. The measurements were performed by switching on a specific light intensity for a determined period of time, while photocurrent was recorded. Initially, when the light is turned on there are no mass transport limitations in the system and a peak current Jpeak is measured. For cells which are stable and do not drift (over the course of measurement), Jpeak follows a linear trend with light intensity, as seen in Fig. S15 and S16, ESI.† If the system is mass transport limited, then the current generally decays rapidly until it reaches an equilibrium current, Jeq. Typically, the value for JSC as measured in a J–V scan will be equivalent to Jeq (assuming the J–V scan rate is not faster than the decay rate, or the cell was not already illuminated prior to scanning). Qualitatively, the difference between Jpeak and Jeq indicates the severity of the mass transport limitations.

In general, mass transport limitations could arise either due to: (a) Co3+ species diffusing out of the TiO2 pores and to the counter electrode, or (b) Co2+ species diffusing from the counter electrode and into the TiO2 pores. However, there can also be differences in the diffusion within the pores compared to diffusion in the bulk electrolyte. In previous studies of water-based DSCs, it has been suggested that insufficient wetting of the electrolyte inside the TiO2 could lead to diffusion limitations, within the pores.11 Therefore, in order to test whether our devices were limited by diffusion within the pores (and that our devices had sufficient wetting), we tested a series of cells with varying spacer thickness. The spacer separates the working electrode and counter electrodes, which only varies the distance for bulk electrolyte diffusion. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent transients, measured at various light intensities, for a series of cells with varying spacer thickness. In principle, if the cells were entirely diffusion limited by diffusion through the TiO2 pores, which would arise if there was insufficient wetting, then changing the distance for bulk electrolyte diffusion should have no effect on the mass transport limitations. However, Fig. 6 shows a trend in which decreasing spacer thickness greatly improves Jeq, at and above 1 sun intensity. This strongly indicates that diffusion limitations are arising due to bulk electrolyte diffusion, and thus not due to diffusion limitation through the pores. Thus we can rule out the possibility of insufficient wetting in these cells. However, up to 1 sun light intensity, there were still diffusion limitations even for the thinnest spacer. Therefore, in order to further reduce mass transport limitations at 1 sun, we tested a series of cells with varying Co3+ species concentration. Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent transients, measured at various light intensities, for a series of cells with varying Co3+ species concentration. By increasing the Co3+ species concentration to 0.06 M, diffusion limitations were completely removed at 1 sun (see the linearity of 0.06 M up to 1 sun in Fig. 7B), which is sufficient for our optimisation in this study. However, Fig. 7 shows that at greater intensities than 1 sun, the mass transport issues become increasingly severe. In other words, further improvements to Co3+ species diffusion will be necessary if higher photocurrents were to be produced (i.e. using a more efficient dye).
With the conclusions from Fig. 6 and 7 solar cells with optimised parameters for lowest mass transport limitations were assembled and the efficiency was improved, see Table 5. In Table 5 the optimum spacing of 15 μm between the working electrode and the counter electrode and an optimum [Co(phen)3]Cl3 concentration of 0.06 M are applied. This can be compared to Table 3 where a spacing of 20 μm and a [Co(phen)3]Cl3 concentration of 0.04 M were applied (PCE = 3.4%).

3.4 Stability measurements
The stability of solar cells with the D51 dye and the Co(bpy)3, Co(phen)3 and I−/I3− aqueous electrolytes (solar cells from Table 3) was tested under 1 sun continuous illumination, at 25 °C and at the maximum power point (MPP), see Fig. 8. In addition to the MPP measurements, J–V values were measured every 5 hours (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†). After 200 hours cell Co(bpy)3 still shows 75% of original maximum PCE, cell I−/I3− 82% and cell Co(phen)3 about 55%. It should be remembered that cell Co(phen)3 had a higher PCE from the start, compared to the cell Co(bpy)3 and cell I−/I3− (see Table 3) and the values in Fig. 8 are normalised. Cell Co(phen)3 was still the best after 200 hours. The solar cells in this study were not optimised for stability and therefore we suggest that the results could have been improved by mechanical stability optimisation. Furthermore, the decrease in PCE is directly correlated with losses in FF, which is visible by relating Fig. 8 and Fig. S19–S21, ESI.† These trends are consistent with a decrease in the ability of the Co3+ species to diffuse to the counter electrode. The trends are similar to previously published results, which tested similar DSCs using cobalt-based acetonitrile electrolytes.30 The evolution of PCE values calculated from MPP tracking is identical to those calculated from J–V values (compare Fig. 8 and Fig. S18, ESI†), which indicates that the cells do not show significant hysteresis. Due to J–V cycling (J–V values were measured every 5 hours), the MPP trend exhibits minor hysteresis after ∼120 hours, which does not appear to affect the overall stability trend (see Section SI-4 ESI,† for further discussion).

Time 0 was taken when the cells reached their maximum PCE. Comparison for 3 different cells with different electrolytes: Co(bpy)3, Co(phen)3 and I−/I3−. J–V values were scanned every 5 hours. 
3.5 Increasing the VOC
Finally, we used [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ in order to test whether a redox couple with a more positive reduction potential could lead to higher PCE. As seen in Table 2, the formal reduction potentials of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox couples are relatively negative versus NHE in water. This limits the VOC, and a redox couple with a more positive formal reduction potential is needed in order to boost the PCE further. The [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ redox couple in acetonitrile has shown more positive reduction potential compared to the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+.46 [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ was synthesised with the chloride counter-ion (Fig. 9). The formal reduction potential was determined to be 0.60 V versus NHE in water (Fig. S22, ESI†). This value can be compared to 0.86 V versus NHE measured in acetonitrile,46 as for the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ there is a negative shift in formal reduction potential measured in water, compared to that measured in acetonitrile. The diffusion coefficient of [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+ was determined to be 2.5 × 10−6 cm s−1, measured in the same way as that for [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(phen)3]2+ (see Fig. S23, ESI†). This value is in line with the diffusion coefficients for [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(phen)3]2+. Earlier optimised characteristics for solar cells (electrolyte composition and spacing between the working electrode and the counter electrode) were applied for maximising the PCE of the solar cells. In Table 6 the J–V characteristics obtained with the [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ redox couple compared to the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ couple are presented. The J–V curve of the record [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ solar cell can be seen in Fig. S24 ESI.† The [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ electrolyte is from here on labeled Co(bpy-pz)3.

As presented in Table 6 the VOC increases significantly to 0.90 V and the PCE to 5.5%, by using the [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ as a redox shuttle. However, considering the difference in formal reduction potential of the redox couples (0.33 V versus NHE for [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ and 0.60 V versus NHE for [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+), and comparing the differences in VOC values in Table 6 indicate recombination issues with the [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ system. By plotting the electron lifetime versus the Fermi-level in the TiO2 (EF), it can be seen that by the same Fermi-level, if one extrapolates the values, the [Co(phen)3] system obtains longer electron lifetimes compared to the [Co(bpy-pz)3] systems, see Fig. 10. The difference in formal reduction potential between the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ and the [Co(bpy-pz)3]2+/3+ (0.27 volt), and the difference in VOC (0.13 volt) for the two systems indicate possibilities for further optimization, and higher PCE values for aqueous cobalt electrolyte DSCs in the future.

By performing photocurrent linearity measurements it could be concluded that the Co(bpy-pz)3 electrolyte based solar cells showed minor mass transport issues, for intensities up to 1 sun, just as the Co(phen)3 solar cells (Fig. S25, ESI†).
4 Conclusions
We have developed three 100% aqueous cobalt redox couple electrolytes and applied them in DSCs. The cobalt bipyridine, cobalt phenanthroline and cobalt bipyridine pyrazole redox couples were made water soluble by changing the counter-ion to chloride, making addition of an additional surfactant to dissolve the redox couple unnecessary. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the use of co-absorbing surfactants or TiO2 surface treatments is unnecessary; instead, by only using organic dyes such as D51 with short alkoxy chains close to the regeneration center,31,32 sufficient wetting can be attained. This approach also has the benefit of achieving a greater dye coverage than when using co-absorbing surfactants, such as chenoxycholic acid. By using TAS, the regeneration kinetics for the water-based system even showed to be twice as fast as the acetonitrile-based system. This showed that the water DSC cells had good TiO2/dye/electrolyte contact and sufficient wetting for high performance. Also, by assessing the dependence of spacer thickness on mass transport, using photocurrent transients, it was indirectly shown that the cells were not diffusion limited in the pores, which further corroborates that wetting was sufficient. By optimising the spacer thickness (separation between the working electrode and the counter electrode) and the Co3+ species concentration, mass transport limitations were removed at 1 sun and attained a PCE of 4.8% for aqueous cobalt phenanthroline electrolyte DSCs. Finally, by applying the cobalt bipyridine pyrazole redox couple, which has a more positive reduction potential compared to the bipyridine and phenanthroline redox couples, a higher VOC and a record efficiency of 5.7% were achieved.
