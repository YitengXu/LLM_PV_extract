    , Accepted 8th January 2013First published on 9th January 2013AbstractWe developed a facile hydrothermal method for synthesizing ultrafine size-controllable earth-abundant Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals using simple Cu(II), Zn(II) and Sn(II) inorganic salts and thiourea in a mixed ethylenediamine and di-water solution as precursors. X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and transmission electron microscopy confirm that pure kesterite structure CZTS nanocrystals have been synthesized at temperatures as low as 180 °C. Broadening of Raman peaks and blue-shift of the absorption edge is attributed to quantum confinement within the nanocrystals. The hydrophilism and tunable band-gap of the CZTS nanocrystals show the potential applications of the nanocrystals for biological labelling and quantum dot based solar cells.
Introduction
Seeking potential alternatives to silicon based solar cells is the relentless pursuit of researchers and engineers all over the world. Currently, I2–II–IV–VI4 quaternary compounds, such as Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), have attracted considerable attention and have been considered as some of the most promising ‘next generation’ photovoltaic materials as potential substitutes for CIGSSe absorber material, as their constituents are nontoxic and earth-abundant (Cu: 50 ppm, Zn: 75 ppm, Sn: 2.2 ppm, S: 260 ppm).1 CZTS has a near-optimum direct band gap energy of 1.4–1.6 eV and a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1). The reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTS-based solar cells has increased from 0.66% to 11.1% very recently, and can be further improved through optimizing the fabrication process, since Shockley–Queisser photon balance calculations have shown that the theoretical single junction PCE limit for CZTS is 32.2%.2–5
Advances in the synthesis of high quality nanocrystals have opened up new possible routes to address the challenge of fabricating low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells. One approach is to prefabricate the photovoltaic material as a nanocrystal ‘ink’, and then this ink can be ‘printed’, ideally under mild conditions, on nearly any type of surface through some technical methods such as screen printing, drop-casting, roll-to-roll or knife coating.6 Moreover, semiconductor nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots (QDs), promise new opportunities for application in high-efficiency third-generation solar cell devices due to their tunable band gap, efficient optical absorption, stability and multiple exciton generation capability.7,8 More than one exciton can be generated upon the absorption of one photon by QDs at a certain energy level. This process is more efficient in semiconductor QDs because of the electronic structure associated with carrier confinement in three dimensions, and an ideal PCE of over 40% is expected in QDs based solar cells. Since 2009, some work on the synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals has been reported. Most of the reports focus on the fabrication of oil-soluble CZTS nanocrystals using a hot-inject technique.2,3,9–11 Some groups introduced the solvothermal method to synthesize CZTS nanoparticles12–14 or microparticles.15 Tian et al. described a novel method to fabricate hydrophilic CZTS based ink using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a chelating agent and a roll-to-roll method to print flexible solar cells.16 In this paper, we introduce a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize hydrotropic CZTS nanocrystals in aqueous conditions with sizes ranging from 3.0 nm to 10.5 nm at low temperature. The size effect, tunable band-gap and quantum confinement in the CZTS nanocrystals, which are critical for exploiting the advantages discussed above in solar cells, have been studied using Raman and optical absorption spectroscopy.
Experimental
Preparation of materials
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis process, copper(II) acetate monohydrate, zinc(II) nitrate, and tin(II) chloride dehydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of ethylenediamine (EN) and water (volume ratio 1:9). Then thiourea SC(NH2)2 di-water solution was added drop by drop. Here, EN was used as the chelating agent and stabilizer. The final concentrations of the Cu, Zn, Sn and S precursors were fixed at 0.04 M, 0.02 M, 0.02 M and 0.16 M, respectively. After 15 min nitrogen bubbling to purge oxygen, the precursor was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, sealed and heated at 180 °C for 6–48 h under autogenous pressure. In this process, Cu2+ and Sn2+ ions were changed into Cu+ and Sn4+ through oxidation–reduction reactions, since tin(II) chloride is a strong reducing agent. After cooling, the powders were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and baked at 60 °C overnight.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a diffractometer (Philips X'pert) with Cu Kα radiation operated at an acceleration voltage of 50 kV. Raman spectra (Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800) were recorded using the 488 nm laser line of an air cooled Ar-ion laser. A microscope was used to focus the incident laser beam to a spot of about 100 μm in diameter. Raman spectra were recorded with a 100× lens system in back scattering geometry with a charge-coupled device detector. The size and shape of the obtained CZTS nanocrystals were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2010), and from its selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high resolution results the crystal structure of the samples can be further identified. The absorption spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The valence states of Cu, Zn, Sn and S in the CZTS nanocrystals were confirmed by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo) analysis.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD θ–2θ patterns of the CZTS nanocrystals as a function of nanocrystal size. The observed diffraction peaks match well with those expected for kesterite CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575). The full width at half maximum of the (220) peak increases with decreasing nanocrystal size. The average sizes of the CZTS nanocrystals synthesized at 180 °C for 6–48 h, determined from the broadening of peak (220) in the XRD pattern using the Scherrer formula, range from 3–11 nm. The valence states of Cu(I), Zn(II), Sn(IV) and S in the CZTS nanocrystals were confirmed by high-resolution XPS analysis (Fig. 2). In the high-resolution spectrum of Cu 2p, two peaks at 932.2 and 952.2 eV appear, indicative of Cu(I) with a splitting of 20.0 eV, which is consistent with the standard separation of 19.9 eV. The Zn 2p peaks located at 1022.2 and 1045.3 eV show a peak separation of 23.1 eV, consistent with the standard splitting of 23.0 eV, suggesting the presence of Zn(II). The presence of Sn(IV) is confirmed by the peak splitting of 8.5 eV of the two peaks located at 486.9 and 495.4 eV. The S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks in the spectra are located at 161.3 and 162.45 eV with a peak splitting of 1.18 eV, which is consistent with the 160–164 eV range expected for S in sulfide phases. From the whole XPS results we find that no other valences, such as Cu(II) or Sn(II), could be detected. In the tetragonal structure of CZTS, the zinc atoms are surrounded by tin and copper atoms, instead of just linked with sulfur as in ZnS. Thus, the chemical environment of Zn in CZTS is different from that in ZnS, which affects the binding energy of Zn 2p. We should note that the Zn 2p peaks, Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, appear at 1022.2 and 1045.3 eV in CZTS, compared with the 1021.2 and 1044.2 eV of ZnS as previously reported.17,18 The chemical shift between ZnS and CZTS may suggest that ZnS does not exist as a part of mixture, and the as-synthesized CZTS is a pure phase. The composition of the as-synthesized CZTS nanocrystals obtained from XPS is approximately Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.90 and Zn/Sn = 0.93, which is close to that obtained from inductively coupled plasma spectrometery (Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.92 and Zn/Sn = 0.92).

Fig. 3a and b show low resolution TEM (LRTEM) images and SAED patterns of CZTS nanocrystals synthesized at 180 °C for 6 h. The particles are crystalline and uniformly distributed, with a nearly spherical shape. The clear presence of diffraction rings of the (112), (200), (220) and (312) planes in the SAED pattern indicates that the CZTS nanocrystals are well crystallized, which is consistent with the XRD pattern. The nanocrystal size could be roughly controlled by varying the synthesis duration time. Fig. 3c–f shows high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of CZTS nanocrystals with different average sizes. The insets are the enlarged images of the selected mono-nanocrystal. The average diameter of the nanocrystals with the synthesis duration times of 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h were 3.0 nm, 4.8 nm, 6.5 nm and 10.5 nm, respectively. These data match well with those calculated from XRD. The nanocrystal shape was nearly perfectly spherical, which contributed to the relatively narrow size distributions of the nanocrystals. HRTEM showed the crystallinity of the nanocrystals, with a lattice spacing of d = 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (112) lattice plane of tetragonal CZTS.

Fig. 4a shows the Raman scattering data taken at room temperature with 488 nm exciting light for five different nanocrystal sizes. Only one peak at around 338–339 cm−1 is detected, which matches well with that of bulk CZTS (337 cm−1). Raman peaks from CuxS, ZnS, and SnS2 (472 cm−1, 351 cm−1, and 315 cm−1) were not observed.19 The Raman spectra are typical of kesterite CZTS, but the peaks are slightly broader and shifted with respect to those of the bulk crystal. The frequency shifts observed are small (∼2 cm−1 blue shift). The variation in the width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main mode at 338 cm−1 with the change in the mean size of the nanocrystals (Fig. 4b) shows that the main Raman peak becomes sharper as the crystal size increases. The dependence of the Raman shift and FWHM of the Raman peaks on the crystal dimensions is normally due to the disorder induced by minor phases or size effects. In our case, Raman, XRD and XPS measurements suggest that only the kesterite phase is present. Thus, the size effect should play a dominant role in the line broadening and shift of the Raman bands. Xu et al. have tried to explain the variation in the Raman bands with a phonon confinement model based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.20 The relationship between particle size and phonon position can be expressed as follows:  where ΔA is the nanocrystal size, ΔP is the phonon momentum distribution, and ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. The phonon is further confined within the nanocrystal and the phonon momentum distribution increases as the nanocrystal size decreases. This broadening of the phonon momentum leads to a broadening of the scattered phonon momentum, according to the law of conservation of momentum, and finally causes asymmetric broadening and a shift of the Raman bands.

Fig. 5a shows the absorption spectra of the as-synthesized CZTS nanocrystals as a function of size. The optical absorption edge shifts slightly to higher energy as the size decreases from 10.5 to 4.8 nm. When the size is further reduced to 3.0 nm, this blue shift of the absorption edge becomes more pronounced. The band-gaps of the CZTS QDs were obtained by plotting (αhν)2 as a function of hν (α = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and ν = frequency), as shown in Fig. 5b. The values of band-gap for CZTS nanocrystals with a diameter of 10.5 nm, 6.5 nm, 4.8 nm and 3.0 nm were determined to be 1.48 eV, 1.52 eV, 1.61 eV and 1.89 eV, respectively. The band-gap of the 4.8 nm CZTS nanocrystals starts to show a slight blue shift, and a large band-gap blue shift (∼0.47 eV) is observed in the 3 nm CZTS nanocrystals. Nanocrystals with a short-wavelength infrared band-gap can be shifted to blue wavelengths due to optical quantum confinement by ensuring that they have dimensions on the order of (or smaller than) the Bohr exciton radius (aex) characteristic of their constituent semiconductor material. The exciton Bohr radius for CZTS nanocrystals can be estimated to be around 3.4–2.5 nm using the below equation and values of dielectric constants and effective masses from Persson's report:21  where aH = 0.53 Å is the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom, and m0, μ, m*e = 0.18m0 (transverse contribution), 0.20m0 (longitudinal contribution) and m*h = 0.71m0 (transverse contribution), 0.22m0 (longitudinal contribution) are the mass of a hydrogen atom, reduced mass, and the effective masses of the electron and hole, respectively. εr = 6.8 is the high frequency dielectric constant.21

Finally, we notice that compared to the oil-soluble CZTS nanocrystals synthesized in ‘oil’ conditions, our synthesized CZTS nanocrystals synthesized in aqueous conditions are hydrotropic. EN plays an important role in increasing the hydrophilism, since one side chain of –NH2 in EN connects with the CZTS nanocrystal and another side connects with the polar solution. This is meaningful not only in the biological labelling field, but also in quantum dot sensitized solar cells fabrication.6,22 We also note that ultrafine CZTS nanocrystals with sizes below 10 nm can be synthesized using our hydrothermal method. Here, EN serves as an effective capping ligand which binds to the nanocrystal surface, and thus further slows down the growth process once CZTS is nucleated in the precursor. If the amount of EN is decreased, the suppression of the nucleation and crystal growth will be less significant.
Conclusions
In conclusion, starting from metal inorganic salt complexes in an EN and di-water mixed solution, we synthesized pure kesterite hydrotropic CZTS nanocrystals with controllable size between 3 and 10.5 nm at low temperature by a hydrothermal method. The Raman bands broaden and shift to higher frequency with decreasing nanocrystal size. The optical absorption spectra of the CZTS nanocrystals with sizes less than 4.8 nm show a shift to higher energy. Both optical characterizations suggest that our synthesized ultrafine (same order of the Bohr radius of 3.6 nm) CZTS nanocrystal QDs display an obvious quantum confinement effect. The ability to fabricate ultrafine hydrotropic CZTS quantum dots over a large size range certainly facilitates the applications of nanocrystals for biological labelling and QD based solar cells.
