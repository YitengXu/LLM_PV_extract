    , Accepted 18th November 2015First published on 18th November 2015AbstractAniline was in situ polymerized in the presence of N,N-di((S)-1-carboxylethyl)-3,4:9,10 perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PTCDA, n-type semiconductor) in dilute acetic acid medium at different concentrations of PTCDA to produce PANI–PTCDA composites (P10, P15 and P20) with PTCDA concentrations 9.8, 13.1 and 21.3% (w/w), respectively. Both FESEM and TEM images indicated that the nanotubular morphology of PANI was retained, with formation of new hairy surfaces in the composites. The FTIR and UV-Vis spectra suggested the presence of π-stacking interaction between PTCDA and PANI produced in the doped state. Blue shifts in the π to π* and π to polaron band transitions indicated H-aggregate formation and secondary de-doping, respectively. Among the composites, the DC-conductivity of P15 sample exhibited the highest value (1.1 × 10−2 S cm−1) and fully reversible nature of the photocurrent. The HOMO and LUMO levels for PTCDA (−5.85 eV and −3.90 eV), determined from cyclic voltammetry, were lower than those of PANI, which transfers its photo-excitons to LUMO of PTCDA generating the photocurrent. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated with N719 dye exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.88% for the P15 sample. The IPCE results indicated a maximum 52% conversion of incident photon in the range 360–660 nm and the longevity of the cell was found to be satisfactory. Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra of the DSSCs indicated the presence of three semicircles in each sample, representing a complex equivalent circuit diagram consisting of three resistance and capacitance circuits. The middle semicircle yields the resistance (Rrc) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) between PANI–PTCDA and electrolyte interface and these are highest for the P15 sample yielding higher lifetime and hence lesser back-reaction of the injected photoelectrons at the PANI–PTCDA/electrolyte interface, contributing to the highest PCE value in the composites.
Introduction
Developments of low-cost, efficient photovoltaic devices have attracted great attention because of the increased demand for energy and consequent depletion of fossil fuels.1,2 Organic photovoltaic devices are considered to be an effective alternative to currently dominant high-cost silicon-based solar devices, owing to the ease of their fabrication and highly mouldable properties.3–5 Two major distinct strategies are under exploration in construction of organic solar cells: bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).4,6 In BHJ devices, p-type and n-type organic semiconductors are mixed intimately to afford a blend of donors and acceptors in close proximity.7,8 Absorption of photons results in formation of coulombically bound electron–hole pairs, known as excitons, that undergo diffusion at the interface facilitating the injection of hole and electron in the respective organic semiconductors, and transport of these oppositely charged species to the corresponding electrodes generates photocurrent.9,10 BHJ devices can be fabricated by co-deposition of a variety of donor–acceptor pairs such as polymer–polymer, polymer-small molecule and small molecule-small molecule blends. The most widely explored semiconductor couples for BHJs are combinations of different p-type semiconducting organic polymers such as polythiophene and its derivatives and π-conjugated small molecules such as C60, naphthalene bisimide, perylenebisimide, pyrene and their derivatives.11,12
In a pioneering work, Grätzel et al. demonstrated fabrication of highly efficient, small molecule-sensitized, solution processed photovoltaic devices, termed dye-sensitized solar cells.13–15 In DSSCs, optical excitation of small molecule dyes results in injection of the photoelectron to the conduction band of n-type semiconducting metal oxides, such as TiO2, and subsequent regeneration of the oxidized dyes by electron donation from the iodide/triiodide redox couple present in the system. Injection of electrons from metal nanoparticles to the anode and equilibration of the redox couple at the cathode completes the photovoltaic cycles.16,17 Photoelectrons generated at the dye molecules are transported to the anode through the TiO2 layers. The size and morphology of the TiO2 have pivotal roles in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs, and optimization of these features constitutes a major part of fabrication of such devices.18,19 Competitive processes such as a reverse charge transfer from TiO2 to the I3−/I− redox couple or to the dye may reduce the overall PCE of a photovoltaic device. The TiO2 layer in a DSSC is typically a 10 μm-thick nanoparticle film, with a three-dimensional network of interconnected 15–20 nm-sized nanoparticles. Alternative cell thicknesses with different sizes of nanoparticles have been used to fabricate highly efficient DSSCs.19 However, despite advances in nanoparticle synthesis, preparation of defect-free, monodisperse particles still poses a considerable challenge. These technologies have resulted in a marked improvement in fabrication of efficient, cost-effective photovoltaic devices, but optimization of underlying processes and improvement of electron diffusion efficiencies remain critical in achievement of maximum PCE.20,21
In an attempt to optimize operation of DSSC solar cells and to facilitate efficient electron transfer from the dye molecules to the electrode, our laboratory explored the effectiveness of different metallic oxide/sulfide-conductive polymer nanocomposites as an alternative to TiO2 nanostructures.22,23 The designed polypyrrole–ZnO and polyaniline (PANI)–zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanocomposites effectively facilitated the electron diffusion in which the excited electrons from the dye molecules were injected to conducting polymers en route to semiconducting nanoparticles, leading to reduction of the detrimental recombination reactions. However, these methodologies do not fully address the disadvantages related to metal nanostructure-based DSSCs. In an alternative design strategy, we envisioned that integration of polymer-based DSSCs with n-type organic semiconductor components of BHJs may provide a pathway towards fabrication of completely organic DSSC platforms. Based on these assumptions, assembly and performance of photovoltaic devices in which the metal nanostructures in polymer-metal nanocomposite-based solar cells are replaced with n-type organic semiconductors of perylenebisimide derivative are evaluated here.
An understanding of the conduction mechanism of photoelectrons in the device is essential to improve its performance, and, presently, AC impedance spectroscopy is used as a testing tool for this purpose.24–27 The non-destructive characterization of the device is taken from the impedance diagrams, which are usually interpreted from equivalent circuit models giving insight into the microstructural features of the material. Presently, the Cole–Cole plot of impedance data, measured at the open circuit voltage of the cell, yields the equivalent circuits of the device. The small AC voltage amplitude used in the impedance analysis exerts a very small perturbation thus delineating the salient ionic and electronic process inside the DSSC.
Here, we describe synthesis and optimization of polyaniline–perylenebisimide-based composites by in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of different stoichiometries of N,N′-di((S)-1-carboxylethyl)-3,4:9,10 perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PTCDA) (Fig. 1). Different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are employed to ascertain the morphology and nature of the interactions between PTCDA and PANI. The UV-Vis spectra clearly indicate H-aggregate formation between the components and a secondary dedoping of PANI in the PANI–PTCDA composites resulting from coiling of the PANI chain. It has been established here that an optimal ratio of PANI and PTCDA (13% PTCDA, w/w) shows excellent intercalation characteristics. DSSCs, fabricated with different PANI–PTCDA composites in the presence of N719 dye [cis-di(thiocyanate)bis-(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) (bistetrabutylammonium)] as a photosensitizer, exhibit the highest PCE up to 2.88% for optimal composition of the composite. Impedance spectroscopy is used to ascertain the photoconduction mechanism of the system.

Experimental
Materials
Acetic acid and ammonium persulfate (APS) were purchased from E. Merck, Mumbai and were used as received. Aniline was also purchased from E. Merck, but was distilled before polymerization. 3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride and l-alanine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Synthetic procedure for preparation of N,N′-di((S)-1-carboxylethyl)-3,4:9,10 perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (RCH3) (PTCDA)
3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride (3.92 g, 10 mmol), l-alanine (1.9 g, 21 mmol) and imidazole (28 g) were placed in a 100 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask. The mixture was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 minutes. After that, the set-up was placed in an oil bath at 120 °C for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled and 100 ml deionized water was added to the mixture in an N2 atmosphere. A dark red solution was obtained at the end of the reaction. Unreacted 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride was removed by filtering the dark red solution. The red solution was then acidified with an aqueous 2 (M) solution of HCl to maintain an acidic medium. The precipitate was washed thoroughly with deionized water until the filtrate had a neutral pH value by suction-filtration (Scheme S1, ESI†). The red solid was then collected and dried at 35 °C in a vacuum oven to constant weight. The 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) of the sample is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†): δ (ppm) 12.783 (bs, COOH), 8.512–8.532 (d, J = 8 Hz 4H, Ar), 8.332–8.351 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H, Ar), 5.571–5.623 (q, J = 13.6 Hz 2H, NCH(COOH)CH3), 1.656–1.623 (d, J = 13.2 Hz, 6H,NCH(COOH)(CH3)). Yield: 4.81 g (89.5%).
Synthesis of polyaniline–PTCDA composites
PANI–PTCDA composites were synthesized by polymerization of aniline (200 μl) in the presence of different concentrations of PTCDA (10, 15, 20 mg) dispersion, and the resulting composites were designated P10, P15 and P20, respectively (Table 1). In a typical procedure, PTCDA was added to 5 ml of 0.2 (M) acetic acid solution and ultrasonicated until the PTCDA was fully dispersed (1 h). Aniline was then added, followed by addition of ammonium persulfate as an oxidizing agent. Polyaniline was precipitated from the reaction mixture and kept for 2 days at 0 °C. The products were washed several times with distilled water followed by methanol to remove oligomers and other organic by-products, then dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven.

Characterization
The powder samples were spread on carbon tape and platinum coated for evaluation of surface morphology. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were recorded using a JEOL, JSM-6700F FE-SEM instrument. The morphology of the samples was also studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL, 2010 EX instrument operated at a voltage of 200 kV. A dilute aqueous dispersion of the sample was dropped on a carbon-coated copper grid and, after drying, it was directly observed through TEM. The tube diameters were measured at different places in the TEM micrographs and the average values are presented with standard deviations. The FTIR spectra of the samples were taken from KBr pellets of the samples using a Shimadzu FTIR instrument (model 8400S). UV-Vis spectra of the samples were taken in water solution (0.25 mg per ml) using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Cary 8454). The solutions were prepared by sonicating the samples in water, and the spectra were taken from a quartz cell with a 1 mm path length. For determination of dye adsorption in the PANI–PTCDA DSSC, first the cell was dipped in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of N719 dye for 12 hours. After adsorption of the dye, the concentration of the residual dye was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Additionally, five known concentrations of N719 dye in ethanol solutions were prepared in the range 0.1–0.5 mM, and from their absorbance measurements a calibration curve was generated. The absorbance spectra of all the samples can be found in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Using the absorbance at the 530 nm wavelength as λmax, a calibration plot was made. From the absorbance vs. concentration data, the unknown concentration of the dye was measured and hence the net dye adsorbed on the PANI–PTCDA surface in the DSSC was calculated to be 3.38 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the P15 sample. For measurement of UV-Vis spectra in the solid state, a thin film of PANI–PTCDA was coated on a glass slide and then dye was absorbed on it by adding 0.5 mM dye solution. Spectra were collected on drying in air, and finally in a vacuum. These spectra were compared with the solid state UV-Vis spectra of the N719 dye and P15 sample.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded from aqueous dispersions of the pure and composite materials in a 1 cm quartz cell using a FluoroMax-3 (Horiba-JobinYvon) instrument. Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of dried samples were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (model D8 Advance) fitted with a Lynx Eye detector. The instrument was operated at 40 kV voltages and 40 mA current. The samples were scanned from 2θ = 15–60° at a scan rate of 0.5 s per step with a step width of 0.021.
Electronic/optoelectronic measurements
The dc-conductivity was measured by a two-probe method by sandwiching the samples between two indium–tin oxide (ITO) conducting strips of 2 mm width placed perpendicularly. The areas of the samples were 0.04 cm2, and the thickness of the samples was measured using digital slide calipers. The dc-conductivity of the sandwiched samples was measured by an electrometer (Keithley, model 617) at 25 °C using the equation: σ = 1/R × l/a where ‘l’ is the thickness, ‘a’ is the area and ‘R’ is the resistance of the sample. The I–V characteristics curves of the samples were studied at 30 °C using the same samples by applying voltages from −5 to +5 V, and the current was measured at each applied voltage.
Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer. Here, PANI–PTCDA composites were sandwiched between two indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. The impedance spectra of the composites were recorded at 25 °C over a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV at 0 V dc level. In the Nyquist plot, the negative imaginary part of impedance (Z′′) was plotted on the +Y axis, and the real part (Z′) was plotted on the X axis, representing a typical Cole–Cole plot in the complex impedance plane. For the sample preparation for EIS spectra of the cell, we followed the procedure for fabrication of DSSC as described below. The films were cast across the electrode gaps. The impedance spectra of the DSSC devices were recorded in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV at an applied DC voltage of 0.65 V, i.e. at the open circuit voltage of the cell.
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out by an electrochemical station (CHI600E) in a three-electrode cell configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl quasi reference electrode with ferrocence/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard using a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. PTCDA dissolved in THF and PANI dispersed in chlorobenzene were cast onto the working electrode area, followed by coating with Nafion. The measurements were made using 0.1 mol l−1 tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a background electrolyte in dry acetonitrile. All working solutions were thoroughly degassed with oxygen-free nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained above the solution throughout the experiments.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The substrates (PANI–PTCDA samples) were sensitized by immersing them in 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye. The photoelectrodes were fabricated on low-resistance ITO glass (2 × 2 cm2, 8–12 Ω/□) by a drop-cast method. A thin layer of aluminum was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 3 × 10−6 mbar on a pre-cleaned glass slide to act as a counter electrode. The resulting dispersions in chlorobenzene were cast onto the ITO glass, with Scotch tape used as a frame and spacer to control film thickness, dried in air. The active area of the anode was about 0.36 cm2. The iodide-triiodide-based electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M KI, 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone, was placed on the active electrode area. To assemble the solar cells, the sensitized PANI–PTCDA sample was placed on the Al-coated conducting glass, separated by a thin parafilm strip to form a sandwich-type configuration. Small spaces of bare ITO glass and Al-coated glass were uncovered for wire connection on the anode. We also fabricated a cell with graphite as counter electrode for comparison purposes. The thickness of the active layer was measured from the SEM image as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), with the thickness of the active layer of the DSSC (P15) being measured to be 14 μm. Other layers in the DSSCs are not easy to differentiate because they may be either very thin with comparable contrast or they become absorbed on the rough surface of PANI–PTCDA composite. The configuration of the solar cell was achieved by sandwiching the samples between the ITO substrate and the counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion. The cell current between the two electrodes was measured using a Keithley source meter (model 2401) by illuminating under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination) from a 150 W Xenon lamp source (Newport Corp. USA; model no. 67005). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured with a Newport 66902 150 Watt Xe-lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measure unit controlled by Visual Basic software.
Results
Morphology
The nanotubular morphology of PANI is shown in the SEM images in Fig. 2. Formation of PANI nanotubes with an average diameter of 165 nm can be observed and this is consistent with PANI structures prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in acetic acid medium.28,29 Addition of PTCDA during polymerization also reveals nanotubular morphology with hairy surfaces, and increasing the concentration of PTCDA results in some change in diameters of the tubes.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of pure PANI (P0), P10, P15 and P20. 
Formation of nanochannel morphology is a characteristic feature of PANI nanotubes and to validate that the addition of PTCDA conserved this inherent property, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of different composites is presented in Fig. 3.30,31 The composites' morphology shows rough outer surfaces (throne-like) and might appear from the polymer chains grown from the outer surface of the PANI nanotube. Further, the P15 composite exhibits uniform nanochannel structures which are considerably less consistent in P10 and P20, as evident from Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  TEM images of pure PANI (P0), P10, P15 and P20 composites. 
The appearance of regular nanochannel morphology in P15 indicates that optimal ratios of PTCDA are crucial to maintain the native nanostucture of PANI, which may be necessary to preserve the conducting structure of this polymer. It is interesting to note that the outer diameter of the tubes first increases from 143 ± 5 nm in PANI to 152 ± 2 and 184 ± 2 nm for P10 and P15 samples, respectively, but for the P20 sample some of the tubes are broken showing an outer diameter of 171 ± 4 nm. One possible explanation for this interesting morphology is that formation of PANI nanotubes in acetic acid medium has been explained from the initial formation of aniline oligomers (phenazine) which act as templates for adsorption of N-phenylphenazines produced during the induction period in the medium.32 A vesicle template is produced by the oligomer N-phenylphenazines stacked around the phenazine nanocrystallites grown during the induction period of PANI formation (Scheme 1). The vesicle grows subsequently because of the growth of PANI chains producing the walls of nanotubes. The formation of nanochannel morphology in the PANI–PTCDA composite may be explained in a similar fashion. Anilinium ion is hydrophilic in nature, whereas the PTCDA carbon backbone acts as a hydrophobic group. Hence PTCDA anchored anilinium salt may produce micelles acting as a “template” for the nanochannel morphology (Scheme 1). The initiation probably occurs at the anchored anilinium group of PTCDA where growth of the PANI chain starts and with the excess anilinium ions it produces a vesicle.32,33 This may be transformed into a low curvature aggregate-like vesicle via growth of the PANI chains forming the walls of the nanochannel. The throne-like outer surface of the nanochannel may arise from the other part of PTCDA, at which aniline molecules may also start polymerization but because of the symmetry problem they may not be able to produce bilayer-type vesicles. Hence polymer chains grow in an isolated fashion from the outer surface of the nanochannel producing the throne-like rough surface. It was found that P-15 produced a well-defined nanochannel structure because at this optimal composition of PANI and PTCDA the vesicles for nanotubular growth occur in a symmetric fashion. At a higher concentration of PTCDA this vesicle formation loses its symmetric character, thereby hindering growth of vesicles and inhibiting formation of the nanochannel morphology.

FTIR spectra

Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectra of pure PANI and corresponding PTCDA composites. The characteristic vibrational bands of PANI and the variation in the presence of PTCDA can be beneficial in ascertaining the nature of the interactions in the composites. PANI consists of two different structural states of aromatic moieties: the quinonoid (Q) and benzenoid (B) structures.34 The quinonoid structure of PANI (P0) shows vibrational bands in the region 1578 cm−1 corresponding to CN and CC stretching, whereas the benzenoid structure of doped PANI exhibits bands at 1488 cm−1 representative of CC stretching.35 It is important to note that the later peak shows a progressive shift to lower wave number and P20 shows a shift to 1476 cm−1, whereas the quinonoid vibration band has shifted from 1578 to 1559 cm−1. These shifts to lower frequencies indicate π stacking interactions between PANI and PTCDA.36 The peak at 1294 cm−1 can be attributed to the C–N vibration of the secondary aromatic amine and it also exhibits a progressive shift showing a maximum (1279 cm−1) in P20 suggesting further doping by the –COOH group of PTCDA. The vibrational bands at 1110 cm−1 may be attributed to polaron band vibration (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B) caused by doping.37 With increasing PTCDA concentration, a shift (7 cm−1 for P20) to lower energy vibration indicates more polaronic structure formation in the composite. The C–H in-plane vibration occurring in the region 1010–1170 cm−1 has lower intensity and may not be detectable here because of the broad nature of the polaron band peak. The 795 cm−1 band may be ascribed to the C–H aromatic out-of-plane deformation vibration.29

UV-Visible spectra
The UV-Visible spectra of pure PANI, PTCDA and their composites are presented in Fig. 5. The P0 shows absorption maxima at 371 nm, 444 nm and 891 nm, which correspond to the π–π* transition, polaron band to π* transition and π to polaron band transition of PANI, respectively.38,39 The PTCDA displays a strong absorption peak at 464 nm with a shoulder at 502 nm which may be attributed to π–π* and n–π* transitions, respectively. As observed in FTIR spectra, the absorption feature of PTCDA is not prominent in the composites, and mostly the shifts of PANI maxima in the composite are prominent.
 Fig. 5  UV-Visible spectra of pure PANI, PTCDA and different composites. 
On closer inspection, the UV-Visible spectra exhibit strong blue shifts in the π band to polaron band and π band to π* band transitions, whereas polaron band to π* transitions show a red shift.40 The presence of polaron-associated absorption bands in P0 indicates that the PANI is in a protonated state via doping with acetic acid and in the composites the blue shift of π to polaron band transition suggests that the doping becomes weaker. Also it is important to note that the π band to π* band transitions exhibit a strong blue shift from 371 nm in P0 to 355 nm for the P15 sample in absorption maxima, implying π–π interaction between PANI and PTCDA of the composites with formation of H-aggregates.41,42
P15 exhibits a maximum blue shift of the π to π* transition band compared with other composites, indicating better supramolecular organization resulting from H-aggregate formation among all the composites. An explanation of the blue shift of π band to polaron band transition from 891 in P0 to 830 nm in P15 may also be related to the H-aggregate formation. This causes the PANI chain configuration to become more skewed forming a more coiled structure of PANI because of interaction of PANI chains with carboxylic acid groups of a rigid PTCDA molecule. This results ultimately in an effective decrease in the conjugation length, although polaron concentration may increase slightly (cf. FTIR spectra) because of additional doping of PANI by PTCDA. This may be termed as secondary dedoping where the conjugated length decreases because of combined π-stacking and acid–base interaction. The red shift in the polaron band to π* band transitions is a consequence of the increase of energy level of polaron band for the secondary dedoping.
Photoluminescence study
Photoluminescence spectra of PANI and its composites in the presence of different concentrations of PTCDA are shown in Fig. 6. The spectra show extensive quenching of the native PTCDA fluorescence. These characteristic properties could be ascribed to the π–π interactions forming H-aggregate between the aromatic ring of PTCDA and PANI.43 The extent of quenching associated with different composites varied with their compositions. In accordance with the different experimental evidence, P15 has shown maximum fluorescence intensity and an increase or decrease of the PTCDA concentration decreases the fluorescence intensity of composites. Incremental addition of PTCDA to PANI increases the fluorescence intensity of the composites as this elevates the effective concentrations of the fluorophores. However, after attainment of optimal composition, as observed for P15, further additions of fluorophores revealed extensive quenching of signals. This can be attributed to the aggregations of the added PTCDA to the PANI/PTCDA composites.44 It is also noteworthy that the peak positions of PL maxima exhibit blue shifts from those of pure PTCDA, e.g. PTCDA has peaks at 547 and 588 nm, whereas the P15 sample shows emission peaks at 544 and 574 nm. These shifts to higher energy emission of P15 may be ascribed to H-aggregate formation where the energy level of PTCDA electrons has become more stabilized.

WAXS study
The crystallinity of PANI–PTCDA composites was measured using a wide angle X-ray diffraction study. Fig. 7 represents the X-ray diffraction patterns of PANI–PTCDA composites. The XRD spectrum of pure PANI shows three diffraction peaks at Bragg angles (2θ) of 15.45°, 20.85° and 25.87°.38,45,46 The sharp peak at 2θ = 25.87° is for the periodicity in the perpendicular direction of the polymer chain and the broad peak at 2θ = 20.85° is because of the periodicity parallel to the polymer chain. An additional diffraction peak at 2θ = 15.45° is ascribed to the periodicity along the polymer chain. PTCDA displays a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.04° and a broad peak at 2θ = 15.26° attributed to π–π stacking of perylene core. However, in the XRD spectrum of the composites the intensity of the XRD peak of PANI decreases with increasing concentration of PTCDA.47 This quenching of PANI intensity of the composites may be attributable to the non-covalent π–π interaction between PANI and PTCDA decreasing the crystalline order of PANI chain to some extent.36

DC-conductivity measurement
The DC-conductivities of the samples were measured at 25 °C for five sets, and the mean values and standard deviations are presented in Table 2. With addition of PTCDA to PANI, conductivity of PANI increases by an order. From the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 5), it is evident that all the three composites (P10, P15 and P20) experienced a secondary de-doping, so one would expect a lowering of conductivity. Therefore, the one order increase of conductivity may be attributed to the contribution from the π-stacked electrons of PTCDA, providing a new path of conduction of the charge carriers. The highest conductivity of P15 may be attributed to the well-defined nanochannel structure with better π–π stacking at this optimum composition of the composite. The P20 exhibits lower conductivity than P15, however, probably because of loss of the conducting nanochannel network of PANI. In PANI the existence of polaron bands is important in conductivity because they serve as hopping sites for the charge carriers. The conductivity of PANI–PTCDA composites can be explained similarly in terms of hopping conduction. With the application of an electric field, the localized charge carriers can hop to neighboring sites, through a continuous network of the sample, and cause electrical conduction.48 Here the PTCDA also helps in the hopping process through the π-stacked electrons. Discontinuity in the network in the composite arises when a higher content of PTCDA (P20) is employed (Fig. 2 and 3) and these disconnections in P20 cause a decrease of conductivity from that of P15.

HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PANI and PTCDA
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PANI and PTCDA were measured electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocence/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard, using the onset potentials of the first oxidation peak and first reduction peak. Fig. S4 (ESI†) illustrates the CV scans of PANI and PTCDA with acetonitrile and TBAP as background electrolyte. The onset potentials of oxidation and reduction for PANI were measured to be 1.50 V and −0.85 V, respectively (vs. Ag/AgCl), corresponding to 0.56 V vs. EFc/Fc+1/2. The HOMO and LUMO levels for PANI hence are estimated to be −5.74 eV and −3.39 eV (vs. vacuum) on the basis of a stable oxidation potential of −4.80 eV (below vacuum level) for Fc/Fc+. Similarly, the HOMO and LUMO levels for PTCDA are estimated to be −5.85 eV and −3.90 eV (vs. vacuum), taking the average oxidation and reduction peak potential of Fc/Fc+ as 0.525 V.
Photoelectronic properties
The I–V characteristic of the PANI–PTCDA composites was measured in the absence of dye and electrolyte by sandwiching only the composites between two ITO electrodes followed by application of bias from −5 V to +5 V under dark and illuminated conditions with 1.5 AM irradiation. The I–V curves in both dark and illuminated conditions (Fig. 8a and Fig. S5, ESI†) clearly indicate the semiconducting nature of all the composites, and also indicate that the photocurrent is higher than that of the dark current in all cases. To get an idea on the reversibility of the photocurrent produced on irradiation of 1 sun at a bias of 5 V, the photocurrent growth (for 100 s) and decay (for 100 s) curves are recorded at a time gap of 1000 ms (Fig. 8b and Fig. S6, ESI†). The figure exhibits several such photocurrent cycles indicating that for the sample P15 the device can be reversibly turned “on” and “off” by switching the white light illumination on and off, respectively. The increase in photocurrent and the percent decay between the second and fifth cycles are summarized in Table 3. The results indicate that the relative percent decay in photocurrent of the two cycles for the P15 sample is rather negative, whereas P10 and P20 exhibit a significant amount of decay. It is therefore evident that P15 is an optimum composition of the composite where there is practically no photodegradation, but in the other two compositions significant degradation occurs under the study conditions of illumination. No definite reason for this is available, but a potential explanation is perfect supramolecular complex formation in the P15 sample giving well-organized nanochannel morphology. In other compositions, however, supramolecular complex formation is not so perfect as evident from TEM micrographs (Fig. 3).

The photocurrent generation can be better understood by examining the corresponding relative energy levels of p-type PANI and n-type PTCDA semiconductors (Scheme S2, ESI†). A proposed mechanism for photocurrent generation under white light illumination (1.5AM) is that p-type PANI absorbs visible light, inducing a HOMO–LUMO transition to excite electrons to the LUMO level; the LUMO of PTCDA and LUMO of PANI are well matched in energy level and the photo-injected electrons transport from the LUMO of PANI to the LUMO of PTCDA, accompanied by transfer of photoelectrons to the ITO electrode.49
Impedance spectroscopy
In this study, impedance plane plots are used to determine the electrical parameters of the PANI–PTCDA composites. Nyquist plots between the real part of the impedance, Z′, and imaginary part of the impedance, Z′′, are shown in Fig. 9 for pure PANI and PANI–PTCDA composites. The plots show strong PTCDA-dependent behavior; addition of PTCDA to the composites resulted in a corresponding reduction in the size of impedance planar plots, and these decreased gradually with increasing PTCDA concentration up to the incorporation of 15 mg PTCDA (P15) and then started increasing. Also, careful examination indicates that the semi-circles appear to be a bit depressed. No definite reason can be afforded for this, but a possible reason for the small distortion of the Nyquist plots may be the small structural anisotropy associated with the nanochannel morphology50 and also the roughness of the surface of the nanotubes present in the systems.51

The impedance data of solid-state conductors consist of a resistance R and a constant phase element (CPE) in parallel connection, with the total impedance (Z) given by (1)where the ZCPE is defined as (2)where “i” is the imaginary unit, “Q” is the pre-factor of the CPE, and “n” is its exponent. The real capacitance C can be calculated using the equation51 (3)where R is the parallel resistance.
After fitting the data with the Z-view software (Solatron), the equivalent circuits were obtained (Fig. 9, inset). The various circuit elements (R1 corresponds to the contact resistance, CPE and the resistance R2 arising from the PANI–PTCDA composite) are computed in Table 4. The resistance R2 decreases with gradual addition of PTCDA, showing a minimum for the P15 sample, and after that it increases; this is also evident from the DC-conductivity values (Table 2). The capacitance value of the P15 sample is found to be highest among the composites.

The highest capacitance value of P15 may be attributed to the well-organized nanochannel supramolecular morphology facilitating the higher charge storage per unit increment of voltage.
Dye-sensitized solar cell application
We fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the composites using N719 dye as a photosensitizer. The UV-Vis spectra of the composite film containing N719 dye are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†), where the spectra of dye and PANI–PTCDA are compared before and after the addition of dye. It is clear from the figure that in the DSSC there is a red shift of both the absorption peaks of the dye compared with that of pure dye, indicating that there is some π–π interaction between the N719 dye and PANI–PTCDA composite apart from the acid–base interaction of the carboxylic acid groups of the dye with the PANI chain. After absorbing the white light by the N719 dye, the photoexcited electron is injected into the conduction band of the composite and then flows to the respective counter electrode. This charge transfer process would be facilitated by a composite, with the highest electron mobility. The J–V characteristic curves of all the DSSCs are compared in Fig. 10 and the important parameters including power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 5.

The Jsc is highest for the P15 sample and this may be attributed to the better mobility of the photo-injected electrons in the well-organized supramolecular nanochannel structure. The Voc values are almost the same for all the three composites, indicating that the band gap does not vary with composition and morphology of the composites. The Voc in DSSC is a measure of the difference between the quasi-Fermi level on the electrode and the redox potential of the electrolyte, and it depends on the nature of semiconducting material.52 As the nature of the PANI–PTCDA composites is identical and as the PANI concentration is very high, there is high probability that the surface contacts will be dominated by the PANI polymer. This implies that the Voc of the different composite systems will be as shown in Table 5. This is also supported by work by Chikyow et al., who showed that Fermi levels of different polypyrrole composites' growth on TiO2 nanocrystal are homogenous and independent of the morphology of polypyrrole.53 Our own study of the fabrication of polypyrol–ZnO composites also proved that morphology and composition of the composites had no effects on Voc of the cell, which was identical in all the samples.23 In these systems the fill factor values are very low. No definite reason may be afforded here, but it may be that the highly conducting nature of the composite is a result of doping of PANI both by PTCDA and acetic acid. The PCE values of the DSSCs increase with the PTCDA concentration, showing a maximum for the P15 sample. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is measured to explain the photocurrent in the PANI–PTCDA DSSCs. Fig. 11 presents the IPCE curves of DSSCs of P15 showing an absorption in the range 360–660 nm. It exhibits a moderate IPCE of ∼52% at the absorption peak of 520 nm.
 Fig. 11  IPCE curve of the DSSC fabricated with P15 sample. 
We now compare the present PCE data with those reported earlier where PANI composites are used as active material without using TiO2 for the dye-sensitized solar cells. Generally PANI and its composites are used as the counter electrode in DSSCs,54–56 but in our laboratory we use PANI composites as an active material for DSSCs replacing TiO2. In the PANI-amino functionalized reduced graphene oxide (a-RGO) system, the PCE obtained is 2.01%;57 in the PANI–ZnS system, the PCE is 3.38%.22 Thus it is evident from a comparison of the data that the PCE value of the present donor–acceptor system is better than that of the other all-organic PANI–a-RGO composite, although it is somewhat lower than the polymer–inorganic (ZnS) hybrid system. It is well known that ZnS is a good n-type inorganic semiconductor, hence it can be summarized that PTCDA is a better n-type organic semiconductor than the a-RGO system.
The longevity of the DSSC (P15) was estimated by measuring the PCE at different time intervals by annealing the samples at 40 °C, and it was found that the cell is stable even for aging up to 48 hours where only ∼20% decrease of efficiency was noted (Fig. 12). Desorption of the dye or degradation of the PANI–PTCDA during long time exposure to light are probable causes.

Impedance analysis of the DSSCs
To understand the electron transfer mechanism in the DSSCs, impedance spectroscopy was used as a potential non-destructive technique.22,58,59 The impedance spectra of the DSSCs are presented in Fig. 13 and the Nyquist plots indicate the presence of three semicircles in each sample.
 Fig. 13  Nyquist plots from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for PANI–PTCDA-based DSSCs. 
The semicircle at the high frequency region (105–106 Hz) corresponds to the impedances (Z1) for the charge transport at the aluminum counter electrode and that at the low frequency region (1–102 Hz) may be attributed to the impedance value (Z3) associated with the Nernstion diffusion of iodide ions within the electrolyte. The intermediate semicircle (frequency range 102–105) is attributed to the impedance (Z2) arising at the PANI–PTCDA/electrolyte interface. The Cole–Cole plots may be explained from a complex equivalent circuit diagram consisting of three units (Fig. 13, inset). The following were evaluated: from the semicircle Z1, the resistance (RCE) and capacitance (CCE) between the Al/electrolyte interface; from the middle semicircle (Z2), the resistance (Rrc) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) between PANI–PTCDA samples and electrolyte; and finally from the Z3 semicircle, the iodine ion diffusion resistance (Rd) and its diffusion capacitance (Cd). All the capacitance and resistance values of the DSSCs are presented in Table 6. In the case of devices, the impedance data fit well with capacitance and resistance circuits (χ2 = 6.7 × 10−6). In the device the surface is very smooth, probably because of the presence of electrolyte, dye etc. For the devices we have presented, the capacitance and resistance data are listed in Table 6. As in the pure composites, here also the DSSC of P15 sample has better capacitive property because of better supramolecular nanochannel structure in which charges may be stored at the interface. The lifetime values (τ) of the injected photoelectrons to the PANI–PTCDA are computed from eqn (1) and the τ values are also included in the table. τ = Rrc × Cμ(4)Of special interest are the Rrc and Cμ values because they are very important for governing PCE value of the cell. It is apparent from the table that P15 has the highest Rrc value, indicating a lesser back-reaction of the photo-injected electrons with the electrolyte interface. Also Cμ has the highest value for the P15 sample, indicating that the capacitive property is better in the sample because of better supramolecular nanochannel structure where charges may be stored at the interface. The lifetime value is also highest for the P15 sample, explaining the highest PCE of 2.88% showing good power conversion efficiency. The increase in roughness of the nanotube surface is maximum for P15 device, providing large surface area for absorption of the large amount of dye molecules, and also facilitating good contact with the redox electrolyte.60 We compared the lifetime values presented here with those of other systems reported earlier. Generally the recombination lifetime values in DSSCs vary between 20 and 100 ms with TiO2-based solar cells with N719 dye.61 However, on special treatment of TiO2 with an organic silane-interposed layer, the lifetime was improved to 100–600 ms with an increase of efficiency from 4.2% to 6.2%.58 However, when the TiO2 photoelectrodes are biotemplated from Parpilioparis butterfly wings, the recombination lifetime decreased significantly (6–7 ms) causing a decrease in efficiency to 4.3%.62 So, lifetime values of DSSCs depend on the processing conditions of TiO2 photoelectrodes. As we have completely replaced the TiO2 with a different active material, e.g. by P15 sample, so we have obtained a lower lifetime (4.2 ms). This is the probable reason for the lower PCE value of the present system with PANI–PTCDA as the active layer, replacing TiO2.

A schematic diagram (Scheme 2) shows the operational principle of the PANI–PTCDA composite-based DSSC under 1.5AM illumination. The relative energy levels of p-type PANI and n-type PTCDA are shown. The LUMO of PANI (−3.39 eV) receives electrons from the photoexcited dye and the excited electrons can pass through the PANI to the LUMO of PTCDA (−3.90 eV) without any obstruction as their energy levels are conducive for the charge carrier to be transferred. Because the PTCDA is supramolecularly attached to the PANI, the photo-injected electrons can transport from PANI to PTCDA to ITO quickly (Scheme 2).

Discussion
Aluminum electrodes have several advantages over conventional electrodes in terms of high reflectivity and low cost, although aluminum has a nominal chance of reacting with iodine. It has been shown that under the condition of DSSC fabrication, an aluminum electrode did not exhibit any corrosion over a period of 24 hours.63 Because of these unique properties, we used aluminum as a counter electrode to prove our hypothesis that the composite of an organic N-type semiconductor has the potential to replace TiO2 in the DSSC. To address concern regarding the stability of the cell, we fabricated the cell with an inert counter electrode, e.g. graphite. The J–V characteristic diagrams of both the counter electrodes using the P15 DSSC are compared in Fig. 14. The resulting cell with graphite counter electrode showed Voc = 0.62 V, Jsc = 9.65 mA cm−2, FF = 0.44 and PCE = 2.63% for the P15 sample (Fig. 14). On comparing these results with those of the present DSSC with Al as counter electrode for the same P15 sample (Table 5), it is evident that the performance of an aluminum counter electrode is even better than that of a graphite electrode. A probable cause of the higher PCE value with Al counter electrode is the difference in their work function values (work function of Al is 4.08 eV and that of graphite is 4.5 eV64). These results prove, therefore, that the operation of the organic semiconductor-based DSSC fabrication technique established in this report has a minimal effect on the type of counter electrodes.

N719 dye is a ruthenium-based dye with two bipyridine ligands that have carboxylic acid substitution. The carboxylic acid groups can interact efficiently with the PANI used in the composites. In addition, the coarse outer surface of the composite nanotubes, observed only in the presence of PTCDA, provides a very large surface area to absorb the dyes efficiently on the surface of the composites. The hydrophobic nature of the PANI–PTCDA composites also aids in this process. Regeneration of the dye by iodide/tri-iodide occurs because of the enthalpic driving force originated from the difference in potentials between the dye and the redox couple. The iodide/tri-iodide has a standard potential of 0.35 V and N719 has an oxidation potential of 1.1 V, yielding a potential difference of 0.75 V. So this large potential difference is the driving force for regeneration of the dye molecule from the oxidized form. These make the process of dye regeneration very fast (nano or femto seconds) compared with recapture of electrons by oxidized dye.17,65 We fabricated a cell without the N719 dye but this did not exhibit any efficiency, indicating the essential requirement of photo-injected electrons for the functioning of the DSSC.
A major competitive electron transfer mechanism that can outweigh the efficiency of the described processes is the back-reaction of the electron from PANI–PTCDA composites to the I3− moiety. The PCE of the described cell indicated that such a recombination phenomenon is relatively small. The photo-injected electrons do not recombine with tri-iodide when they are in the polymer representing a central dilemma of obtaining high photoconversion efficiency usually obtained from DSSCs. In TiO2-based solar cells several experimental and theoretical efforts have been put forward in an attempt to understand why the recombination of tri-iodide and electron on semiconductor surface is so low. As the surface contact between electrolyte and the semiconductor spans almost the entire cell, it is expected that this back-reaction will ruin the efficiency of the cell. The retardation of this reaction happens because of intricate interactions between the semiconductor surface and the electrolyte.52
The PANI–PTCDA composites have a net positive charge and this is compensated for by the carboxylic group on the PTCDA and the carboxylic groups of absorbed dye molecules, as well as iodide present in the electrolyte. These afforded formation of a dipole across the Helmholtz layer between the negatively charged (PTCDA, dye and iodide) species and the positively charged PANI. The hole carrier (I3−) also has absolute negative charge, which reduces the recombination rate because of a decrease in capture cross-section (for like-charged particles).52 In addition, injection of photoelectrons in the composite reduces the Helmholtz potential to some extent because of the screening of electrons by the positive charge. This reduced potential thus further reduces the rate of recombination.66,67
Different experimental studies and corresponding theoretical models suggest that the back-reaction has minimal effect on the photovoltage generation and consequent fill factor of conventional DSSCs. The transfer of electrons from the nanocrystalline TiO2 to the electrode occurs via a difference in electrochemical potential generated by the injection of photoelectrons in TiO2 and electrode, rather than a fixed electrical potential difference between the two substrates.68 We may extend this to the present device involving polyaniline–PTCDA composite. The value of the dielectric constant in TiO2 is about 115,69,70 and that of PANI (ES) is 370.71 The dielectric constant of PANI depends on a variety of factors, e.g. doping level, crystallinity, temperature, and frequency.70–74 As the dielectric constant of PANI is larger, photo-injected electrons would face more difficulty to flow through to the external circuit and hence back-reactions with the electrolyte would be more prominent. As a result a lower lifetime and lower PCE are observed in these types of cells.75
Conclusion
The P10 and P15 composites retain the nanotubular morphology of PANI with the formation of new hairy surfaces; however, in P20 the nanotube morphology partially breaks because of the imperfect supramolecular organization for the increased PTCDA concentration. The blue shift of π–π* transition band of PANI in the UV-Vis spectra provides evidence for H-aggregate formation between PANI and PTCDA in the composites. Also, the blue shifts of π to polaron band transitions indicate secondary de-doping from pure PANI produced in the acetic acid medium, arising from the skewed chain configuration of PANI because of the H-aggregate formation inducing more coiled structure formation of PANI. Among the composites the DC-conductivity of P15 exhibits the highest value (1.1 × 10−2 S cm−1) because of formation of a better organized supramolecular nanochannel structure at this optimum concentration of PTCDA in the composites. The on–off cycle indicates the fully reversible nature of photocurrent for the P15 sample, resulting from better supramolecular organization of this composition. The HOMO and LUMO levels for PTCDA (−5.85 eV and −3.90 eV), determined from cyclic voltammetry, are lower than those for PANI, therefore the photo-excitons of PANI move to LUMO of PTCDA generating the photocurrent. DSSCs fabricated with PANI–PTCDA composite and N719 dye exhibit the highest PCE of 2.88% for the P15 sample, and this has been attributed to the well-organized nanochannel structure. The IPCE result indicates a maximum 52% conversion of incident photon in the range 360–460 nm, and the longevity of the cell is found to be satisfactory. The Cole–Cole plots of the impedance spectra of the devices indicate the presence of three semicircles in each sample. The resistance (Rrc) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) at PANI–PTCDA and electrolyte interface are highest for the P15 sample. These results yield a higher lifetime value of the injected photoelectrons at the PANI–PTCDA and I3−/I− electrolyte interface indicating a lesser back-reaction of the photo-injected electrons contributing to the highest PCE value.
