    , Accepted 8th May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractA unique ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 (ZNTCN) heterogeneous photocatalyst was fabricated using an electrospinning method combined with a sonication process. Initially, 1-dimensional (1D) nanofibers of ZnTiO3 (ca. 160 nm in diameter) were obtained by electrospinning and then combined with 2-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of g-C3N4via a facile sonication approach. The hybrid ZNTCN exhibited a considerable enhancement of the photocatalytic H2 evolution and degradation of methylene blue under visible-light irradiation. The rate of H2 evolution with the ZNTCN sample (295.88 μmol g−1) was six-fold and three-fold higher than those of pure ZnTiO3 (56.72 μmol g−1) and g-C3N4 (106.22 μmol g−1), respectively. In addition, the optimal ZNT:CN ratio (40:60 w/w) had shown excellent photodegradation performance towards removal of methylene blue, phenol, 4-chlorophenol, and 4-nitrophenol contaminants compared to those of bare ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets. Clearly, the g-C3N4 nanosheets interacted synergistically with the ZnTiO3 nanofibers. The improvement in photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to rapid charge transportation, increased optical absorbance and efficient separation of photoelectrons from the barrier potential produced at the interface. Moreover, dramatic suppression of recombination losses of the hybrid photocatalyst was confirmed through room-temperature photoluminescence, photocurrent response, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These novel heterogeneous photocatalysts were shown to be very promising in green technology as well as for degradation of phenolic/non-phenolic pollutants.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanostructure-mediated photocatalytic water splitting technology has been widely used as an efficient, sustainable, direct conversion of solar energy, and clean approach to pollution abatement and energy shortages.1,2 Fascinatingly, hydrogen (H2) evolution from water has gained widespread attention because of its potential use to triumph over the increasing energy demand and environmental crisis.3–7 Until now, a range of semiconductor heterostructures based on metal oxides, chalcogenides, and organic complexes have been used as effective photocatalysts for rapid H2 evolution and photodegradation of contaminants.8–11 Particularly, zinc oxide–titanium dioxide (ZnO–TiO2) heterostructures have been extensively investigated due to their excellent chemical and photostabilities, high electron mobilities, suitable band edge positions, natural abundance, and environmental friendliness.12–14 Recently, single-phase zinc titanate (ZnTiO3, ZNT) has emerged as a better choice than ZnO–TiO2 due to its outstanding properties and broad applications.15,16 It has been used as an active sorbent for dye molecules, desulfurization of hot coal gases, and microwave dielectrics.17,18 Nevertheless, ZNT heterostructure photocatalysts are still plagued by low photocatalytic performance because of their short wavelength absorbance, recombination losses, poor chemical stability, and relatively high fabrication costs. Therefore, it is necessary to combine with visible light-active photocatalysts to overcome these issues. One-dimensional (1D) nanofibers have demonstrated a rapid charge collection process, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Additionally, their fibrous shape reduces particle agglomeration, increases electron diffusion, and induces extra energetic barriers that lead to the formation of numerous space-charge regions.19,20 The electrospinning method used in this study to fabricate the 1D nanostructures of binary metal oxides, is the most simple, versatile, low cost, compatible and convenient technique.21 However, it has never been used for the synthesis of zinc titanate photocatalysts. Hence, we propose to design hybrid photocatalysts using an electrospinning method in order to efficiently produce H2 and to degrade toxic pollutants under visible light irradiation.
During the last few years, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free organic semiconductor, has been extensively studied for water splitting, removal of contaminants, photoreduction of CO2, and bioimaging applications.22,23 It has drawn much scientific interest, offering numerous advantages such as a visible-light bandgap (ca. 2.7 eV), a number of active sites arising from its two-dimensional (2D) structure, desirable energy band levels for H2 evolution, excellent chemical and thermal stability, low fabrication cost, and nontoxic composition consisting only of naturally abundant carbon and nitrogen.24–27 Thus, it has been combined with different inorganic semiconductors to overcome these deficiencies. Strategies that have been explored to achieve better photocatalytic performance include coupling of different bandgap semiconductors to improve photoresponse and widen the optical absorbance, and incorporation/doping of metals or carbonaceous materials to capture photoelectrons.28–31 Interestingly, its heterostructures have performed well with respect to H2 evolution and degradation of a wide range of contaminants. Particularly, nitrogen-containing pollutants (phenol, 4-chlorophenol and 4-nitropehnol) are of great concern because of their carcinogenic effects and high solubility/stability in water.32,33 Their increased production in various fields (dyes, drugs, insecticides and fungicides) has become a serious threat to the environment or ecosystem.34 Although many efforts have been made to design heterogeneous photocatalysts, none of the heterostructures satisfy all of the requirements for practical use in H2-evolution and environmental remediation applications. Therefore, it is essential to develop new heterostructures to achieve desirable photocatalytic performance.
In the present work, we combined 1D ZNT nanofibers and 2D g-C3N4 sheets via a cost-effective route, and evaluated their photocatalytic water splitting and degradation performances. The fabrication process involved the electrospinning of ZNT nanofibers and their heterostructures with g-C3N4 sheets using a solvothermal method. A series of ZNT/g-C3N4 heterostructures with different weight fractions were successfully fabricated and used for water splitting. Remarkably, the optimal combination of ZNT/g-C3N4 rapidly generated H2 and photodegraded various pollutants under visible-light irradiation. The enhanced performance was mainly attributed to the increased optical absorbance, effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charge-carriers, and number of active sites. Moreover, we proposed a possible photocatalysis mechanism for the charge transfer process under illumination. We expect that the present work will increase the interest in developing new and superior heterogeneous photocatalysts.
Experimental methods
Materials
The reagents used in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Titanium(IV) butoxide (C16H36O4Ti) from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) from Junsei Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan), polyvinylpyrrolidone (K90) from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and acetic acid (CH3COOH) from Kanto Chemical Co. Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were used as starting materials to synthesize ZnTiO3 nanofiber powder. Urea from Samchun Pure Chemical Co. (Pyeongtaek, Republic of Korea) was used as the raw material for the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride powder.
Preparation of nanoporous ZnTiO3 nanofibers
ZnTiO3 nanofibers were collected by electrospinning. The spinning solution was prepared as follows: zinc acetate powder (1.2 g) was dissolved in methanol (11 mL) with constant stirring at room temperature. Then, titanium butoxide (5 mL) was poured into the solution with continuous stirring. Subsequently, acetic acid (0.2 mL) was added to the solution to assist evaporation of the solvent. Finally, polyvinylpyrrolidone (1.5 g; PVP, MW = 1300000) powder was dissolved in the same solution to obtain a viscous gel. A uniform light-yellow-colored gel formed after 2 h of vigorous stirring. The polymer gel was loaded into a 10 mL plastic syringe connected to a 25-gauge stainless steel needle (inner diameter: 0.26 mm). After this, the syringe was vertically fixed on the pump and connected to a high-voltage power supply. The feed rate of the solution through the syringe was kept at 10 μL min−1. Spinning was performed with an electrospinning system (NanoNC, Seoul, Republic of Korea) at 20 kV. Simultaneously, the distance between the needle and the flat collector was maintained at 10 cm. The as-collected electrospun nanofiber mats were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h to evaporate residual solvent. Then, the dried fiber mats were sintered at 550 °C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1) for 4 h in air. The sintered fibers were used in subsequent experiments for analyses.
Preparation of g-C3N4 sheets
Powdered g-C3N4 sheets were collected using the sintering method, as reported in the literature.35 Specifically, urea powder (10 g) was kept in the oven at 60 °C for 2 h and then transferred to a covered ceramic crucible at ambient temperature. Then, it was heated at 580 °C for 2 h in a box furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling naturally to room temperature, a white-yellow powder was obtained and further combined with ZnTiO3 fibers.
Preparation of ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrids
The hybrid photocatalysts were fabricated using a two-step process. In the first step, ZnTiO3 nanofiber powder (10 mg) was dispersed in absolute ethanol (20 mL) under stirring at room temperature. A specific weight percent of g-C3N4 powder (20 and 60 wt%) was added to the ZnTiO3 solution with constant stirring for 1 h. Then, the mixture solution was ultrasonicated for 2 h. The hybrid powder was collected by evaporating the solvent in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. For the second step, the dry hybrid powder was annealed at 300 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere to ensure a strong interaction between the two nanostructures. The final products were collected after the furnace had cooled to room temperature. The obtained hybrid catalysts containing 20 and 60 wt% added g-C3N4 were labeled ZNTCN20 and ZNTCN60, respectively. The synthesis of the pure and hybrid products is given in Fig. 1.

Characterization
The phase analyses of the pristine and hybrid samples were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; model D/MAX–2500/PC, Rigaku) using a Cu-Kα radiation source. The surface morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S4800 at 15 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2100 at 200 kV). The optical properties of the pure and hybrid samples were analyzed using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Jasco V-600) and compared to a BaSO4 bar as a reference. The chemical interactions at the photocatalyst surface were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; Bruker IFS 66/S) over the range of 4000 to 400 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo-Scientific) was used to determine the oxidation states of the optimal hybrid sample. The separation of charge carriers was quantified by measuring the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum using a spectrofluorometer (DongWooOptron) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The time-resolved PL decay spectra were recorded on a F7000 fluorescence spectrometer installed with a femtosecond-pulsed laser.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were conducted in the dark and under visible-light irradiation using a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4, Princeton Applied Research), equipped with a three-electrode cell. The working electrode was prepared as follows: the powder samples were dispersed into Liquion solution (2 mL) under stirring and then spin-coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The coated FTO substrates were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 2 h and used as is in the electrochemical measurements. The reference electrode was the saturated calomel electrode (SCE); a graphite strip was used as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. Numerous photocurrent on/off cycles were recorded over several minutes of irradiation with visible light from a xenon lamp. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the same setup was used over a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at 1 V. EIS measurements were conducted in the dark and under irradiation.
Photocatalytic evolution of H2
The photocatalytic water-splitting performances of the pure and hybrid photocatalysts were evaluated as follows: catalyst powder (2 mg) was dispersed in a triethanolamine (TEOA; 50 mL) aqueous solution (10 vol%); Pt (1 wt%) was used as the cocatalyst. After uniform dispersion of the catalyst powder, the suspension was transferred into a quartz reactor and sealed with a rubber septum. The sealed reactor was then purged with argon gas for ca. 30 min to obtain anaerobic conditions. Subsequently, a Xenon lamp with a UV cut-off filter was used to illuminate the reactor containing the suspension with visible light (≥400 nm) for 4 h. The produced gas was collected with a syringe at 1 h intervals and measured by chromatography (model 6500GC, YL Instruments).
Photodegradation of MB and phenolic compounds
The photocatalytic performance of the pristine and hybrid catalysts was evaluated with a batch-type reactor by degrading an MB aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The detailed experimental procedure was explained in our earlier report.35 In brief, 50 mg powder of photocatalyst was dispersed in 250 mL of MB solution (3.2 mg L−1) and stirred at room temperature for 60 min to achieve an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Consequently, the suspension was irradiated with visible light under constant stirring. During irradiation, 3 mL aliquots of the solution were collected at 10 min intervals, and then analyzed using a spectrophotometer. Similar experiments were performed to degrade phenol (Ph), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) compounds under visible light irradiation. A concentration of 2 × 10−4 M was kept constant for all phenolic pollutants. The removal of the pollutants was examined by checking the change in optical absorbance at their corresponding wavelengths (MB = 663 nm, phenol = 270 nm, 4-chlorophenol = nm and 4-nitrophenol = nm).
Results and discussion
XRD
XRD analysis was performed to establish the phase structure of the hybrid and pristine samples. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of pure ZnTiO3, g-C3N4, and the ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrids having different compositions. For the pure ZnTiO3 sample, the diffraction peaks at 23.90, 32.77, 35.31, 41.22, 48.93, 53.44, 56.82, 61.79 and 63.39° corresponded to the {012}, {104}, {110}, {021}, {024}, {116}, {018}, {214} and {300} planes, respectively, of the rhombohedral phase of pure ZnTiO3 (JCPDS card no. 26-1500). Two additional diffraction peaks were observed at 25.29 and 27.39°, indexed to the {101} and {110} planes of the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 01-070-7348 and 01-078-4189), respectively. The relatively high sintering temperature (550 °C) in air led to the formation of TiO2 phases with ZnTiO3 nanofibers. Pristine g-C3N4 displayed two diffraction peaks at 27.8 and 14.1°, assigned to the {002} and {100} interlayer stacking planes of the conjugated aromatic groups and tri-s-triazine units in the g-C3N4 structure, respectively.36 The diffraction patterns of the various ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 compositions exhibited peaks corresponding to the ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 phases, which confirmed the formation of hybrid structures. Additionally, the intensities of the ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4peaks were similar to those of the pristine materials.37 Increased loading of g-C3N4 from 20 to 60 wt% in the hybrid caused the intensities of the ZnTiO3 diffraction peaks to decrease and the major diffraction peak {002} of g-C3N4 to gradually increase. A similar trend was observed for other g-C3N4-based hybrids.38–40

FE-SEM
Differences in the surface morphology between pristine ZnTiO3, g-C3N4, and their hybrids were revealed by FE-SEM (Fig. 3A to C). The rough-surfaced ZnTiO3 nanofibers were several micrometers long and had a relatively uniform diameter of ca. 160 nm (Fig. 3A). The magnified images revealed the fine porosity of the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and interconnecting nanoparticles. The shape and size of the various ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrids were similar to those of pristine ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 (Fig. 3B and C). The morphology of ZNTCN20 clearly showed that the hybrid structure of the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets was distributed throughout the entire sample (Fig. 3B). The density of the g-C3N4 sheets was lower than that of the nanofibers, and some sheets were agglomerated within the hybrid sample. In the ZNTCN60 sample (Fig. 3C), the nanofibers were wrapped around several sheets, and its density was higher than that of ZNTCN20 (Fig. 3B). The higher content g-C3N4 had a large number of dispersed sheets that were combined with the nanofibers over the entire area; this resulted in better interactions between the nanostructures (Fig. 3C) and a higher density (magnified image). This indicated the successful formation of heterojunctions between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets. This behavior would be expected to improve the optical absorbance and charge separation characteristics, and thereby enhance water splitting under visible-light irradiation.

TEM
Pure ZnTiO3 nanofibers and its hybrids with g-C3N4 sheets (ZNTCN20 and ZNTCN60) were further analyzed using TEM to better understand their porous nature and formation of the heterojunctions (Fig. 4A to F). The ZnTiO3 nanofibers had an average diameter of 160 nm with interconnected grains (Fig. 4A). The magnified TEM image clearly shows the presence of a number of nanopores on the surface of the fiber, with a pore diameter less than 20 nm (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the FE-SEM results (Fig. 4A). In the case of hybrid sample ZNTCN20, the presence of ZnTiO3 nanofibers with g-C3N4 sheets confirms the formation of the hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 4C). The fibers with a number of fine pores are tethered to the surface of the g-C3N4 sheets. The magnified TEM image confirms that the crystalline structure of ZnTiO3 nanofibers is distributed in the hybrid sample (Fig. 4D). Similar porous nanofibers were evident on the surface of the g-C3N4 sheets in the ZNTCN60 hybrid. Furthermore, a portion of the nanofibers were covered by g-C3N4 sheets, which would improve charge transfer via the resulting heterojunctions (Fig. 4E). The high-resolution TEM image confirmed that the crystalline ZnTiO3 nanofibers were well-connected with the g-C3N4 sheets (Fig. 4F). The estimated interplanar distance was found to be 0.27 nm for the ZnTiO3 phase along the (104) direction which is consistent with the XRD data. The TEM results thus revealed a close interaction between ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets, which could enhance charge separation and transfer for efficient hydrogen production and contaminant degradation.

Optical absorbance

Fig. 5 shows the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the various ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrids and the ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 starting materials. The absorption band edges of pure ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 were observed at ca. 400 and 460 nm, respectively; these positions are similar to those reported in the literature.14–18 The band edge shifted to 400–460 nm for the ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrids. Remarkably, the combination of g-C3N4 sheets with ZnTiO3 nanofibers resulted in the band edge shifting to longer wavelengths with increasing g-C3N4 content; this suggests a strong synergistic interaction between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and the g-C3N4 sheets in the hybrid. The inset shows the Kubelka–Munk plots of the pure and hybrid samples. The estimated band gap of pristine ZnTiO3 is found to be 3.11 eV, which is not useful to absorb light in the visible region of the solar spectrum. However, after introduction of g-C3N4 sheets, it shifted to the visible region. The obtained bandgap of the hybrid and pure g-C3N4 is found to be less than that of the pristine ZnTiO3 structure (ZNTCN20 = 2.98 eV, ZNTCN60 = 2.88 eV, and pure g-C3N4 = 2.8 eV), which can be used in visible light irradiation. These changes in band edge absorption show its absorbance capacity in visible light. Therefore, the increased absorbance of the hybrid structures in the visible-light region compared with that of pure ZnTiO3 nanofibers indicated an increased number of electron–hole pairs, which could improve photocatalytic activity.

FT-IR
The hybrid and pure samples were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy to study the chemical interactions of the heterojunctions between the ZnTiO3 fibers and g-C3N4 sheets. Fig. 6 shows that the pure ZnTiO3 fibers exhibited two major peaks at 526 and 448 cm−1; these were assigned to the characteristic vibrations of metal–oxygen bonds (metal = Zn, Ti).41,42 The peak at ca. 1637 cm−1 originated from the bending vibration of the –OH group.43 The presence of these specific bands revealed the pure phase structure of ZnTiO3 nanofibers produced via electrospinning.44 The broad peak at ca. 3448 cm−1 was attributed to physically adsorbed water molecules on the catalyst surface and the stretching mode of the hydroxyl group. The spectrum of pristine g-C3N4 contained several peaks in the region from 1637 to 1206 cm−1 which correspond to the breathing mode of C–N heterocycles.45 Additionally, the peak at 810 cm−1 was attributed to the characteristic stretching mode of triazine units in the g-C3N4 structure.46 The broad peak at ca. 3158 cm−1 was assigned to the –OH and –NH groups from water molecules and partial hydrogenation of nitrogen atoms in g-C3N4.47 The main peaks of the various ZNTCN spectra corresponded to the ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 nanostructures and provide evidence for their coexistence in the hybrids. Furthermore, the slight change in the peak locations between the hybrids and the pure components was consistent with a strong bond between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and the g-C3N4 sheets. The intensity of the peaks corresponding to the ZnTiO3 nanofibers decreased with increasing g-C3N4 content of the hybrid. This stemmed from the almost complete wrapping of the ZnTiO3 nanofibers around the g-C3N4 sheets. The formation of strong heterojunctions between ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets could improve the separation of charge carriers and, hence, photocatalytic activity.

XPS
The chemical states and bonding within the ZNT/g-C3N4 heterostructure were further studied by XPS (Fig. 7A to F). The survey spectra showed binding energy peaks related to Zn, Ti, O, C and N elements, consistent with the presence of ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 structures (Fig. 7A). The deconvoluted spectra of the Zn 2p feature (Fig. 7B) showed two major peaks at 1020.98 and 1044.07 eV that corresponded to the +2 state of zinc. This indicated that the zinc ions had a strong interaction with titanium and oxygen ions.17 For the Ti atoms, two major photoelectron peaks, corresponding to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2, were located at binding energies of 457.86 and 463.54 eV, and were consistent with the Ti4+ coordination sites in the ZnTiO3 phase (Fig. 7C).47 Additionally, the position of the Zn 2p and Ti 2p peaks are seen to have shifted towards lower binding energies compared with that reported for pristine ZnTiO3 illustrating its chemical interaction with the g-C3N4 structure.17,48 Furthermore, three relatively small peaks at the Ti 2p level at 459.23, 460.75, and 464.79 eV were attributed to the presence of the Ti3+ state.49 The O1s peak (Fig. 7D) was asymmetric with a major peak at 529.39 eV related to O2− in the ZnTiO3 structure.50 The second relatively major peak at 532.0 eV stemmed from the adsorption of ˙OH radicals on the surface of ZnTiO3. There were also two other minor peaks at 230.88 and 533.32 eV that were attributed to chemisorbed oxygen and lattice O2− groups. The C 1s core level peak was deconvoluted into four components having binding energies of 283.49, 284.6, 287.59, and 288.98 eV (Fig. 7E). The three major peaks at 284.6, 287.59, and 288.98 eV stemmed from the graphitic structure of carbon and bonding between carbon and nitrogen.51 The additional peak at 283.49 eV was assigned to carbon impurity. The deconvoluted N 1s signal consisted of two peaks at 398.21 and 400.73 eV that were attributed to the pyridinic nitrogen centers in the triazine rings and the slight oxidation of the g-C3N4 structure.52 Overall, XPS analysis confirmed a strong interaction between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 nanosheets. This could be beneficial for fast charge transfer and minimization of recombination losses.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The various photocatalysts have been evaluated in water splitting applications under visible-light irradiation for their H2 evolution performance. Fig. 8 shows the H2 evolution with the pure and hybrid photocatalysts over several time periods; these experiments were conducted in aqueous triethanolamine solution (10 vol%) as the sacrificial agent. The figure shows that the pure ZnTiO3 (56.72 μmol g−1) and g-C3N4 (106.22 μmol g−1) catalysts evolved less H2 due to their moderate optical absorbance and charge carrier recombination. The photocatalytic H2 evolution was substantially enhanced after combining the ZnTiO3 nanofibers with g-C3N4 sheets. The photocatalytic H2 evolution with ZNTCN20 (120.09 μmol g−1) improved remarkably in the presence of even small amounts of g-C3N4. With additional g-C3N4 loading, the H2 evolution increased (ZNTCN60 = 295.88 μmol g−1) which is found to be the maximum. However, a further increase of the g-C3N4 content decreases the H2 evolution (not included). These results confirmed that the ZNTCN60 hybrid was the optimal photocatalyst for water splitting under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, the obtained H2 evolution rate is substantially higher than that of the reported g-C3N4 based hybrid photocatalysts (Table TS1†). The improved photocatalytic H2 evolution observed with the hybrid structures was attributed to the heterojunctions between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and the g-C3N4 sheets. These heterojunctions hindered charge carrier recombination and, hence, enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Photodegradation of MB dye
The photodegradation capabilities of the pure and hybrid photocatalysts for wastewater purification were evaluated by the degradation of MB as a model pollutant under visible-light irradiation. Additionally, removal of dye molecules via an adsorption process was measured by keeping the suspension in the dark for 60 min. This 1 h period will help achieve equilibrium adsorption before irradiation.53,54 A control photodegradation experiment was conducted without catalysts to study the photolysis of MB. Fig. 9A compares the changes in the MB concentration (relative absorbance) of the pure and hybrid catalysts as a function of irradiation time. The change in MB concentration was negligible in the absence of a photocatalyst. This demonstrated that MB was stable under visible-light irradiation for up to 2.5 h. However, the catalyst addition significantly decreased the MB concentration. Notably, the degradation rate was much higher with the hybrid structures than that with pristine ZnTiO3 or g-C3N4. Clearly, coupling of the g-C3N4 sheets with ZnTiO3 nanofibers had a synergistic effect on their photodegradation abilities. Interestingly, the degradation rate of the hybrid structures (ZNTCN20 and ZNTCN60) improved with increasing g-C3N4 content. This trend suggests that 60 wt% of g-C3N4 is the optimal loading for the photocatalyst hybrid.24 For ZNTCN20, a low g-C3N4 sheet content resulted in a poor optical absorbance and relatively lower activity than those of the other hybrid structures. From these results, we observed that the formation of heterojunctions with the optimal ratio of components is a prerequisite for efficient photocatalytic activity.

For comparison, commercial P-25 (TiO2) powder was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Photolysis of MB, phenol, 4-CP and 4-NP pollutants are also provided for reference. 
The type of reaction kinetics involved in MB degradation was determined by plotting the first-order reaction equation ln(A0/A(t)) vs. t, where k is the slope of this curve, i.e., the apparent kinetic rate constant. The obtained k values from the kinetic plots are summarized in Fig. S1A.† The apparent kinetic rate constant for ZNTCN60 was k = 8.53 × 10−3 min−1, which was three-fold larger than that of pure ZnTiO3 nanofibers (k = 2.51 × 10−3 min−1) and was the highest among all of the ZnTiO3-based hybrids. The rate constant of ZNTCN20 (k = 3.62 × 10−3 min−1) was also found to be higher than those of pure g-C3N4 (k = 2.69 × 10−3 min−1) sheets and commercial P-25 (TiO2, k = 2.45 × 10−3 min−1), but were lower than that of the ZNTCN60 hybrid. The enhanced performance of the hybrid structures may have resulted from the maximum charge carrier separation at the interfacial region and a broader region of light absorbance.
Photodegradation of phenolic compounds
In order to increase the applicability for degradation of non-dye pollutants, we further explored the catalysts for the removal of Ph, 4-CP and 4-NP compounds in an aqueous solution under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 9B to D). It was seen that photolysis performance is infinitesimal without the catalyst conditions, which reveals that phenolic compounds are stable under irradiation. Moreover, dark adsorption of phenolic molecules was measured for 60 min to check self-degradation. As a result, the relative absorbance remained almost the same for pure and hybrid catalysts indicating that there is no adsorption in the dark. In contrast, the photodegradation rate of phenols is seen to be remarkably enhanced when the catalyst suspensions are exposed to visible light. It can be seen that ZNTCN60 degraded the phenol almost completely (∼99%) within 60 min, which is significantly higher than those of pure g-C3N4 (10% within 60 min), ZnTiO3 (20% within 60 min) and the other hybrid sample (ZNTCN20, 45% within 60 min, Fig. 9B). Similarly, as seen from the relative absorbance results, the 4-CP solution irradiated with visible light degraded within 90 min for the ZNTCN60 hybrid, which is a shorter time compared to those of the other hybrid and pure samples (Fig. 9C). Also for 4-NP, it was clear that the ZNTCN60 hybrid required only 60 min which is less than those for pure ZnTiO3 and the other hybrid catalyst (Fig. 9D). From these results, we found that the hybrid catalysts exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity towards degradation of all phenolic compounds. This has resulted from the effective transportation of charge carriers through the 1D nanostructure and broader optical absorbance (UV to visible light).
We have further analyzed the photodegradation results of the present catalysts by calculating the kinetic rate constant, as shown in Fig. S1(B to D).† Clearly, the linear curve illustrates that first order reaction kinetics apply, which follow the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. The kinetic rate constant calculated from the logarithmic plots was found to be k = 34.37 × 10−3 min−1 for the ZNTCN60 hybrid compared to the k = 0.95 × 10−3 min−1 for pure ZnTiO3, k = 2.29 × 10−3 min−1 for g-C3N4, k = 1.25 × 10−3 min−1 for commercial P-25 (TiO2), and k = 10.17 × 10−3 min−1 for the ZNTCN20 hybrid. The ZNTCN60 hybrid exhibited significantly faster photodegradation of the phenol compared to the other materials. This is consistent with the photocatalytic degradation results for MB. The degradation of 4-CP and 4-NP pollutants also showed improved photocatalytic performance in the case of hybrid catalysts compared to their pristine counterparts (Table TS2†). It is known that photocatalytic activity mainly depends on the separation of electron–hole pairs before recombination and rapid transport. The enhanced catalytic activity found for the 60 wt% ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrid is the result of their effective separation and transport, increased optical absorbance, and strong interaction among catalysts.
Reusability test
It is known that the reusability of photocatalysts is crucial for commercial use. To evaluate the recyclability of the ZNTCN60 hybrid sample, photodegradation experiments were carried out under the same conditions 4 times for MB, phenol, 4-CP and 4-NP pollutants. After each cycle, catalyst powder was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with distilled water for the next cycle. As shown in Fig. 10, no recognizable decay of photodegradation efficiency was found after four consecutive cycles. These results indicate that the ZNTCN60 hybrid exhibit high stability under irradiation. Hence, the present catalysts could be applicable for industrial purposes.

Photoluminescence spectroscopy
The above discussion focused on the interaction and formation of contacts between ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets, as determined using FT-IR and FE-SEM methods. The heterojunctions formed in the nanostructures resulted in efficient charge separation and, hence, rapid dye/non-dye degradation and efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution. We also measured the room-temperature PL emission spectra of the pure components and the optimum hybrid structure to evaluate the extent of charge separation and migration. Fig. 11A shows the PL spectra of pure ZnTiO3, g-C3N4, and the ZNTCN60 hybrid measured at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. Pure g-C3N4 had a strong emission peak at ca. 460 nm, which was attributed to the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.55 The intensity of the PL peak for the ZNTCN60 hybrid was greatly reduced relative to that of pure g-C3N4, which implied a much lower recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers under visible-light irradiation. The pure ZnTiO3 structure displayed only weak PL emission due to the smaller number of photogenerated charge carriers. PL analysis indicated that the hybrid structures exhibited less recombination losses compared with the bare photocatalysts. The PL emission spectra were in agreement with the photocatalytic activities, suggesting the presence of minimum recombination losses in the hybrid structures. Time-resolved PL spectra of the pure and hybrid catalysts were also measured (Table 1). The carrier lifetime was longer for the hybrid structures than those for the pure ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4. These results are in agreement with the aforementioned room-temperature PL data and photocatalytic performances.

Transient photoresponse analysis
A superior photocatalyst must absorb incident photons, convert them into electron–hole pairs, and successfully separate them. The transient photoresponse of a photocatalyst can be used to analyze the photogenerated charge carrier's separation mechanism.56 In the present study, we measured the photocurrent generated from pristine ZNTiO3, g-C3N4, and the ZNTCN60 hybrid over several on–off cycles of visible-light irradiation (Fig. 11B). The hybrid exhibited a much higher photocurrent than bare ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4. Such an improvement in the photocurrent of the hybrid structure indicated the presence of numerous available charge carriers for rapid photocatalytic activity. Additionally, it revealed a strong interaction between the ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets, and a low interfacial transfer and separation of photogenerated charges through heterojunction formation. These results also supported the minimal recombination losses revealed by PL emission data.
EIS analysis
The photocatalysis reaction rate basically depends on the interfacial charge transfer resistance. To further understand the photocatalysis mechanism and charge separation, we analyzed the EIS of the pure and hybrid structures in the dark and under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 11C). It is established that a smaller radius indicates a lower charge transfer resistance.27 In the present study, the ZNTCN60 hybrid had the smallest diameter, which confirmed fast transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, the substantial decrease in the impedance resistance under irradiation indicated the generation and separation of a large number of charge carriers. Combining g-C3N4 with ZnTiO3 nanofibers thus boosted the charge separation efficiency and led to enhanced photocatalytic performance and H2 evolution.
Photochemical stability
The photochemical stability of photocatalysts is crucial to design devices for commercial application. Fig. 11D shows the photochemical stability of pure ZnTiO3 and ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 (60:40) electrodes for up to 10 h under visible light irradiation. Clearly, we can see that the almost similar photocurrent produced over a prolonged irradiation time revealed the good stability of the present photocatalysts. Particularly, the ZnTiO3/g-C3N4 hybrid has shown steady and high photocurrent as compared with the pristine ZnTiO3 sample. From these results we can say that the fabricated heterostructure has shown not only excellent photodegradation and H2 evolution activities but also photochemical stability. Therefore, the present heterostructures could be applicable in water splitting devices.
Possible photocatalysis mechanism
The above results were used to develop a plausible mechanism for the photodegradation and H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation with the ZNT/g-C3N4 heterostructure. It is well-known that effective charge generation and separation under visible-light irradiation is of major importance for efficient photocatalytic performance. We found that the formation of heterostructures from ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets increased the optical absorbance and charge separation, which resulted in a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity. The remarkable charge transfer in the heterostructures was related to the 1D ZnTiO3 nanostructure. Additionally, the combination with g-C3N4 made it more photo-responsive, led to high optical absorbance, and broadened the useful wavelength region. Fig. 12 illustrates a plausible photocatalysis mechanism under visible-light irradiation. Illumination excites g-C3N4 and generates electron–hole pairs. The energy levels of ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 are suitable for charge transfer and separation at the interface. In the heterostructure photocatalytic system, g-C3N4 acts as a sensitizer under irradiation due to its narrow bandgap. The absorption of visible light by g-C3N4 leads to the promotion of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), leaving holes in the VB.28–33 The CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 (CB = −1.3 eV and VB = 1.4 eV versus NHE) are more negative than the CB and VB of ZnTiO3 (CB = −0.25 eV and VB = 3.0 eV versus NHE).57,58 Due to the favorable energy levels, photogenerated electrons were easily transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to ZnTiO3via interface interactions. Then, the electrons from CB further reacted with O2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface to generate reactive species (O2− and ˙OH) capable of degrading pollutant molecules or enabling the reduction at the surface for H2 evolution. Meanwhile, holes in the VB of g-C3N4 could react with H2O molecules to produce ˙OH that could directly oxidize pollutants. This charge transfer mechanism facilitated the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs at the interface of ZnTiO3 and g-C3N4 structures.

Conclusions
In summary, novel visible-light-active photocatalysts based on heterojunctions of ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 sheets with different compositions were synthesized via a two-step process. The porous ZnTiO3 nanofibers loaded onto g-C3N4 nanosheets led to a remarkable improvement in the water splitting and photodegradation performance towards dye/non-dye pollutants under visible-light irradiation. This was attributed to the synergistic co-sensitization of g-C3N4 with the ZnTiO3 nanofibers. The formation of heterojunctions between these two structures led to strong interfacial contacts and, hence, minimized recombination losses. The suppression of charge recombination was confirmed by room-temperature PL spectroscopy, the transient photocurrent response, and EIS analyses. Moreover, the present photocatalysts have shown good photochemical stability for up to 10 h under visible light irradiation. The authors have thus developed a promising approach for improved photocatalytic water splitting and environmental remediation using hybrid and efficient photocatalysts based on ZnTiO3 nanofibers and g-C3N4 nanosheets. This work opens up a cost-effective, robust strategy for developing visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for conventional wide band gap semiconductors.
