    , Accepted 2nd March 2017First published on 5th April 2017AbstractWe herein report the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of poly-3-((2,5-hydroquinone)vinyl)-1H-pyrrole, consisting of a polypyrrole backbone derivatized at the beta position by a vinyl-hydroquinone pendant group. The structure of the polymer was characterized by solid state NMR spectroscopy. The interactions between the polypyrrole backbone and the oxidized quinone or reduced hydroquinone pendant groups are probed by several in situ methods. In situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows a spectroscopic response from both the doping of the polymer backbone and the redox activity of the pendant groups. Using an in situ Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance we reveal that the polymer doping is unaffected by the pendant group redox chemistry, as opposed to previous reports. Despite the continuous doping the electrochemical conversion from the hydroquinone state to the quinone state results in a significant conductance drop, as observed by in situ conductivity measurements using an Interdigitated Array electrode set-up. Twisting of the conducting polymer backbone as a result of a decreased separation between pendant groups due to π–π stacking in the oxidized state is suggested as the cause of this conductance drop.
Introduction
During the last decades, increased attention has been drawn to the growth of electricity generating facilities and, in particular, to the development of renewable energy sources using wind or solar power. In this field, electric energy storage (EES) technologies are crucial for minimizing energy waste, related to mismatch between consumption requirements and production capacity, which for renewable energy sources is intermittent by nature. Rechargeable batteries are important EES components, not only for powering products in our daily life, but also as they might meet the future demands on EES for implementation within the electricity grid.1 With the increased need for electrode materials with greater energy and power densities the exploration of new alternative materials for EES is indispensable.2,3 Compared to the widely used inorganic electrode materials, organic matter based materials are favoured for specific applications owing to their unique properties, being flexible and inexpensive, and also complying with calls for renewability and sustainability.4 Several types of redox active organic compounds have been tested as electrode materials, such as carbonyl compounds,5–8 dithiols9,10 and nitroxides,11,12 all giving well-defined redox responses and exhibiting prospects as electrode materials. However, due to dissolution, these small molecules often suffer from poor cycling stability.13–15 Furthermore, their limited intrinsic conductivity requires excessive amounts of conductive additives, thus reducing the gravimetric energy density of the material. A strategy to overcome both dissolution problems and low conductivities is to introduce a conducting polymer (CP) with covalently attached redox moieties as pendant groups (PGs), thereby constructing a conducting redox polymer (CRP). The doped polymer backbone is expected to improve the overall conductivity and the polymeric nature of the material is expected to reduce solubility, thus improving cycling stabilities.
Polypyrrole (PPy), being a well-studied material for EES applications,16–18 was chosen as the CP backbone in this project, because of its relatively high stability and wide range of potentials at which it is conducting. Para-Benzoquinone was chosen as PG due to its attractive redox properties. A series of PPy and quinone based CRPs has previously been studied in our group, where we found that the length of the linker between the PG and CP determines the degree of interaction of these two subunits.19–21 The longer the linker, the weaker the interaction, and a –CH2CH2– linker was sufficient to eliminate any evidence of interaction, which allowed CP and PG to fully take advantage of their individual strengths. In this report we synthesized a new polymer, based on 2-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)benzofuran-5-ol monomers (Fig. 1) to further investigate the interaction between CP and PG. In our previous studies a similar monomer 3-(2,5-dimethoxystyryl)-1H-pyrrole in both trans and cis configuration failed to polymerize.21 However, in the present paper we show that via a benzofuran ring opening during the polymerization, a PPy based CRP with a vinyl linker may be obtained, which completes the study of linker effect in this series. Properties such as conductivity, spectroscopic characteristics as well as the mass change during cycling of the resulting polymer are examined by various in situ techniques.

Experimental
Electrochemistry
An Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat (Ecochemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used for all electrochemical measurements. A solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP, 0.1 M) in MeCN was used as electrolyte for polymerization. All measurements on polymers were performed in aqueous solution containing NaNO3 (1 × 103 mM), Na2HPO4 (100 mM) and NaOAc (100 mM), with the pH adjusted by addition of HNO3 (86%). All potentials measured in aqueous solutions are reported versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and all potentials measured in organic solutions are reported versus the ferrocene redox couple (Fc0/+). In three-electrode set-up, a polished glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode (3 mm diameter, BASi, USA) was used as working electrode and a Pt wire was used as counter electrode. In organic electrolyte the reference electrode was composed of an Ag wire in a solution consisting of AgNO3 (10 mM) and TBAHPF (100 mM) in MeCN (Ag/Ag+, −0.096 V vs. Fc0/+) that was kept in a separate compartment filled with organic electrolyte. In aqueous solution an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 × 103 mM NaCl, 0.192 V vs. SHE) was used. The electrolyte was thoroughly degassed with solvent saturated with N2(g) and kept under N2 atmosphere during the measurement. All measurements were performed at RT.
Polymerization
For the electrochemical measurements, the poly-3-((2,5-hydroquinonyl)vinyl)-1H-pyrrole (P1) was synthesized electrochemically from a 10 mM solution of 1 in organic electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry (CV) between −0.4 V to +0.9 V vs. Fc0/+ for 5 scans at 0.1 V s−1, ending at −0.2 V vs. Fc0/+ where the polymer is in a neutral state. The resulting polymer was washed with EtOH and acetone to remove monomer residues and salt before characterization in aqueous solution.
For solid state NMR, a polymer sample was prepared as follows. Compound 1 (25 mg, 0.125 mmol) was dissolved in MeCN (4 mL) in a 20 mL round-bottom flask with stirring. After addition of FeCl3 (anhydrous, 81.2 mg, 0.5 mmol) the flask was sealed and the mixture was stirred overnight at 40 °C. The mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and diluted with water (6 mL). After centrifugation for 5 minutes, the solid precipitate was washed successively with water (10 mL), acetone (10 mL), and ethanol (10 mL). The solid residue was dried under vacuum overnight.
Spectroelectrochemistry
Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), combined with electrochemical measurements was employed to monitor the spectroscopic response from the polymer during the electrochemical process. Measurement was performed with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a PIKE WeeMAX III single reflection electro-ATR accessory with a gold coated 45° ZnSe prism and a DLaTGS detector at room temperature. Details of the cell set-up are shown in Fig. 2. Electropolymerization was performed from a 50 mM solution of 1 in organic electrolyte by CV between −0.4 V to +0.9 V vs. Fc0/+ for 20 scans at 100 mV s−1 in the ATR accessory with a three-electrode set-up. After polymerization, the monomer solution was removed and the coated polymer was washed carefully with acetone as well as water. All electrochemical measurements were made in aqueous electrolyte at pH 2. CV measurements were performed to confirm the quality of formed polymer and potential step measurements were taken to keep the potential fixed while recording the IR spectra of the polymer. All IR spectra were recorded under static conditions, which was normally reached after applying a constant potential for 120 s. Background spectra were recorded right before each measurement at either neutral state (0.192 V vs. SHE) or fully oxidized state (0.692 V vs. SHE). Baseline correction was made by subtracting a linear baseline for the spectra presented in Fig. 8.

In situ conductivity measurement
IDA electrodes with 90 pairs of interdigitated Au strips with 10 μm and 150 nm heights, separated by 10 μm with a circular active area with diameter 3.5 mm, purchased from Micrux (Spain), were used as working electrode (WE). A Pt wire was used as counter electrode (CE). In order to obtain sufficient amount of polymer bridging the two WEs, 25 scans at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used for polymerization. The resulting polymer was carefully washed with acetone, EtOH and then with water. During the conductivity measurement, bipotentiostat CV was performed with a bias potential of 10 mV between the two WEs. The conductance (Gp) was calculated as (1)where Δi is the current difference between the two WEs, and Ebias is the bias potential.22 In principle the material conductivity (σ) can be calculated from the measured conductance together with the electrode geometry described above. This involves the assumption that the entire volume between the two working electrodes is occupied by the polymer and that current is restricted to flow through the volume between the two WEs. Gp is related to σ by: (2)where d (10 μm) is the distance between the two WEs and A is the cross section area (7.08 × 104 μm2). Due to the uncertainty of the actual geometry only Gp is, however, reported throughout the study.
Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat equipped with a QCM922 EQCM module (Princeton Applied Research). The WE consisted of a gold coated AT-cut quartz EQCM crystal with a reference frequency, (f0) of 8.95 MHz, an area of active surface (A) of 0.198 cm2, a AT-cut quartz constant (μq) of 2.947 × 1011 g cm−1 s−2 and a quartz crystal density (ρq) of 2.65 g cm−3. The CE was a Pt wire and, in organic electrolyte the reference electrode was constructed from an Ag wire immersed in a MeCN solution of AgNO3 (10 mM) and TBAHFP (100 mM) (Ag/Ag+, −0.096 V vs. Fc0/+) that was kept in a separate compartment filled with organic electrolyte while for aqueous solution an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 M NaCl, 0.192 V vs. SHE) was used. The frequency change (Δf) is measured during the experiment and the corresponding mass change (Δm) on the electrode is calculated using the Sauerbrey eqn (3): (3)where a change of 1 Hz equals 1.068 ng for the QCM922's 8.95 MHz crystals. All electrodes were kept directly in the electrolyte except for the reference electrode for the organic electrolyte. Electropolymerization was performed from 10 mM of 1 in organic electrolyte by CV between −0.3 V to +0.7 V vs. Fc0/+ for 8 scans at 0.1 V s−1. The characterization of the polymer was made in aqueous electrolyte.
Results and discussion
Monomer synthesis
The vinyl linker monomer 3-(2,5-dimethoxystyryl)-1H-pyrrole failed to polymerize.21 DFT calculations on the oxidized species suggested that the spin density was delocalized over the entire molecule, thus possibly reducing the polymerizability at the α-carbons of pyrrole (see Fig. S1 (ESI†), the spins are mostly populated on the vinyl linker carbons as well as the carbons in the benzene ring). A furan ring as a linkage would be desired because from DFT calculations we found that the spin density mainly is localized on the α-carbons of pyrrole when a furan is used as linker, allowing the polymerization to occur at the desired positions (Fig. S2, ESI†). The synthetic route yielding the monomer 1 was adapted from our previous synthesis of similar compounds.23 In this approach, a Sonogashira reaction was employed as the major step to couple the pyrrole and hydroquinone subunits with a triple bond linker. Compared to our previous studies, a different protecting group for the hydroquinone moiety was chosen, i.e. tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ethers rather than methoxy ethers, which allows the deprotection to proceed more readily and under milder conditions. The THP protecting group was removed under acidic condition with catalytic amount of TFA, followed by deprotection of TIPS on pyrrole with a TBAF solution. TBAF was not only used because its high efficiency in removing the TIPS group, but it is also directing the formation of a benzofuran ring resulting from the attack of the hydroxyl group on the alkynyl carbon.24 Product 1 was obtained with an overall yield of around 30% after 5 steps. The structure of product 1 was verified by 1H and 13C NMR, including HSQC and HMBC spectra (see ESI†).
Electrochemical polymerization
The polymerization of monomer 1 in MeCN solution on a GC disk electrode using CV is shown in Fig. 3a. The irreversible oxidation of pyrrole, starting at 0.4 V vs. Fc0/+ leads to the deposition of polymer onto the GC electrode surface. A build-up of polymer was indicated by the increasing current at a lower potential (0.1 V vs. Fc0/+) at both the reductive sweep and oxidative sweep after each scan. An upper turning potential of 0.7 V vs. Fc0/+ was found to be sufficient for polymerization while not too high to risk over-oxidation of the formed polymer.

Polymer structure: solid state NMR spectroscopy
To identify the structure of P1 in terms of linker and pendant group structure, a solid state 13C CP NMR spectrum was recorded for a chemically synthesized P1, Fig. 4a. Four major broad peaks, around 150 ppm, 130 ppm, 120 ppm and 110 ppm, are observed while the 13C CP NMR spectra of unsubstituted PPy typically only show two broad peaks at 105 and 125 ppm.28–30 The two extra peaks in the P1 spectra are attributed to the linker and the pendant group. To assign these peaks, we compare the P1 solid state 13C CP NMR spectrum with solution 13C NMR spectra of several monomers (Fig. 4b–d). Polymerization of compound 1 may result in three possible structures of P1. Polymerization via the pyrrole α-carbons without any changes on the linker and pendant group would give a polymer with a benzofuran ring in its pendant group. However, the CV of P1 (see below) indicates a 2H+ redox process which is typical for a hydroquinone, indicating that the benzofuran ring has opened during the polymerization procedure. This ring opening is supported by the 13C CP NMR spectrum of P1 in which the two signals from the linker carbons of 1 (i.e., the double bond carbons, 97 ppm and 156 ppm) overlap poorly with the polymer peaks, Fig. 4b. Therefore it is likely that the benzofuran ring of the monomeric 1 has opened during or after the polymerization. This ring opening might result in a double bond or a triple bond linker. Hence, comparison was made with the solution 13C NMR spectrum of 3-((2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl)-1H-pyrrole (2) which has a triple bond linker (Fig. 4c). The solid state spectrum of P1 shows a small peak at around 85 ppm, but this is a spinning side band and not generated by an sp carbon. In addition, the P1 peak at 130 ppm has no corresponding signal in the spectrum of this monomer. The possibility of a triple bond linker is thus ruled out. A significantly better match was found between the solid state 13C NMR spectra of the P1 polymer and the monomeric reference compound trans-3-(2,5-dimethoxystyryl)-1H-pyrrole (3) with a double bond linker, Fig. 4d. All peaks of P1 match the carbon signals of this monomeric compound quite well. Transposing the assignments for the monomeric reference compound to P1, the broad peak at around 150 ppm is assigned to the two hydroquinone HO–C carbons. The peak at around 130 ppm is assigned to hydroquinone C-1, which is attached to the linker, and the remaining peaks between 90 to 125 ppm belong to both the PPy backbone and the remaining hydroquinone pendant group carbons. Based on the solid state NMR results we thus conclude that the polymer structure is that of P1 as depicted in Fig. 1.

Electrochemical characterization of the polymer
After polymerization of 1 from monomer solution the resulting polymer P1 was characterized in aqueous electrolyte. The CV responses of the as-prepared polymer in aqueous electrolyte at three different pH values are shown in Fig. 3b. At pH 0, the typical capacitive charging of the PPy backbone is observed with an onset doping potential around 0.08 V vs. SHE followed by a plateau up to 0.5 V vs. SHE. Compared to the unsubstituted PPy in which the onset doping potential is around −0.2 V vs. SHE, the onset doping potential of P1 is significantly higher. It is thus more difficult to oxidize the PPy backbone in P1 compared to the unsubstituted analogue, which is probably due to a shorter conjugation length in P1. The shorter conjugation length could be either due to the formation of shorter polymer segments during polymerization, or to the P1 polymers being less linear than the unsubstituted analogue because of the bulky pendant groups. The pair of redox peaks observed at around 0.64 V vs. SHE is assigned to the redox reaction of the pendant group, i.e. the redox conversion between the reduced hydroquinone (HQ) state and the p-benzoquinone (BQ) state. Evidently, the redox activity of the quinone pendant group occurs in a potential region far above the PPy doping onset, thus ensuring that the polymer backbone is oxidized and hence in its conducting state, as will be shown below. The charge quantities required for oxidation of the pendant group were the same as those required for reduction, implying that the HQ/BQ conversion is chemically reversible. Moreover, the linear increase of the peak current with scan rate (see below) suggests a non-diffusion limited reaction and the full widths at half peak maximum (ΔEp,1/2 = 50 mV for the oxidation and 57 mV for the reduction) are close to those of a Nernstian reaction suggesting that the quinone pendant group provides a relatively well defined redox process.
Upon increasing the pH the potentials of the redox peaks are shifted towards lower values. This behavior is typical of the redox reaction of HQ/BQ in which protons participate in the reaction (Q + 2H+ + 2e− = H2Q) causing the formal potential of this reaction to depend on the pH of the electrolyte solution. At slightly higher pH (pH = 3.5), there is no clear plateau for the capacitive charging peak of the PPy backbone as it merges with the redox peak of the pendant group redox process. The reduction peaks are also significantly broadened at higher pH, and this effect becomes more and more apparent as the pH increases. This suggests a lower exchange rate constant at higher pH which is consistent with a proton coupled redox reaction via the protonated states.25,26
Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was employed to evaluate the formal potentials of the redox reaction in the pH interval between 0 and 13 and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. In the plot, the current was normalized by dividing by the peak current and baseline correction was applied to all subplots. A very small potential difference between oxidation peak and reduction peak was observed and a decrease of 59 mV pH−1 of the formal potential, as evaluated from the mean of the peak potentials during oxidation and reduction sweeps, was obtained (Fig. 5b). This pH dependence is very close to the theoretical value of 58 mV pH−1 for a 2H+, 2e− reaction at 22 °C, supporting the assignment of the peak to the quinone redox chemistry.

The current was normalized by dividing by the peak current, baseline correction was applied to all subplots. (b) The formal potential of P1 obtained from SWV measurements at varying pH of the electrolyte, linear fitting of the data gives a slope of 59 mV pH−1 with R2 = 0.99. 
Scan rate dependency study
The kinetics of P1 was studied using CV at various scan rates at pH 2. The same polymerization condition as described in the Experimental section was used (5 CV scans). A non-diffusion limited response of P1 was observed in which the logarithm of the quinone peak current (ip) increases linearly with the logarithm of the scan rate (ν) with a slope of 0.96 with R2 = 0.97 (Fig. 6a). At slow scan rate (ν = 1 mV s−1), the splitting between oxidation peak and reduction peak is around 40 mV, reaching 200 mV at ν = 300 mV s−1. With increasing scan rate, the peak split increased linearly with ln(ν) according to Laviron behavior. The linear fit of the peak potential at high scan rate yields apparent rate constants for both the oxidation and the reduction process (Fig. 6b). For the oxidation, 1 − α = 0.49 and k0ox = 1.9 s−1, taking E0′ = 0.54 V, and α = 0.79, k0red = 0.6 s−1 for the reduction. This result is comparable to a similar quinone based CRP that we have investigated previously, where k0ox = 4.4 s−1 and k0red = 0.6 s−1 was found.27

Spectroelectrochemistry
Spectroscopic methods have been used to provide insight into the doping process, degradation and the side reactions during the redox process of conducting polymers. To probe the redox response of the PPy backbone and the HQ/BQ conversion, ATR-FTIR performed in situ during electrochemical redox conversion provides a powerful tool as it enables observation of structural changes during the redox processes. The CV response of P1 on the Au surface of the ATR crystal showed identical features as the one polymerized on a GC disk electrode (Fig. 7). The in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a potential step method, starting from 0.2 V up to 0.7 V which covers the process of backbone doping and the redox reaction of the quinone moiety.
 Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammogram of P1 coated on the Au surface of the ATR crystal, in aqueous electrolyte buffered at pH = 2.00. The potentials chosen during the potential step measurements are marked by dashed lines. 
The evolution of the ATR FTIR difference spectra during the oxidative process is displayed in Fig. 8a in the region 4000–800 cm−1. A strong absorbance band extending from 1700 cm−1 to the visible region was observed in all spectra. This spectral feature is related to electronic transitions between the valence band and the doping-induced polaron or bipolaron in-gap states31 and coincides well with the doping process of the PPy backbone. The absorption band begins to appear from 0.3 V, indicating the doping process has started between 0.2–0.3 V, which is in accordance with the CV response of the polymer that shows a capacity increase at 0.2 V (Fig. 7). Choosing a lower starting potential would be more appropriate to follow the whole doping process, however, dis-attachment of the polymer from the Au surface was observed at lower potentials, thus limiting the ATR-FTIR studies to potentials above 0.2 V.
In order to investigate the reversibility of the electrochemically induced spectral changes, a series of reductive potential steps, starting from 0.7 V to 0.2 V with 0.1 V intervals and spectra at 0.7 V as background, were recorded. A comparison between the oxidative scans and the reductive scans reveals that the position and intensity of the bands at forward and backward scans are close to identical, revealing the reversibility of the whole process (Fig. 8b). Bands at 905, 976, 1059, 1121, 1246, 1437 and 1516 cm−1 grow with increased potential at the beginning of the oxidation. All these peaks have been observed for PPy, and they originate from so-called doping-induced infrared active vibrations (IRAV), which are due to structural changes during the doping process. Details of assignments are listed in Table 1.

The band around 1634 cm−1 is assigned to the CO stretching in BQ as this peak is also found in single molecule BQ. The intensity of this band starts to increase rapidly after 0.4 V, which is different from the IRAV bands induced by polymer doping. Moreover, the potential at which this band starts appearing coincides well with the starting potential of the conversion of HQ to BQ during the oxidative process. Over-oxidation of the PPy results in the formation of CO on the β-position of pyrrole which would also appear in this region. However, this possibility is excluded by two factors: first, this band is reversible whilst the over-oxidation reaction is expected to be irreversible and second, the over-oxidation peak is usually observed at higher wavenumbers, i.e. 1720 cm−132 or 1722 cm−1.33,34 The assignment of this band is further confirmed by comparing its intensity change with that of the doping-induced IRAV bands (Fig. 9), where the normalized intensity of the CO band at 1634 cm−1 showed a quite different evolution pattern compared to the doping induced IRAV bands.

Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
The mass change of the EQCM electrode during the CV polymerization is shown in Fig. 10a. The polymer deposits onto the electrode at potentials above the monomer oxidation onset potential which results in a mass increase. The mass loss on the reduction sweep can be rationalized by the expulsion of anions during the de-doping process. After the deposition of polymer onto the EQCM electrode, the resulting polymer was characterized by CV in aqueous electrolyte. During initial scans a small but notable mass-increase, probably due to the swelling of the polymer film, upon repetitive cycling was observed. This drift was observed during the first 9 scans after which the polymer retained the same mass after each cycle. The mass change of the polymer during CV measurements was therefore monitored after initial equilibration and Fig. 10b shows the mass change versus potential during the oxidative scan and reductive scan together with the corresponding CV response (Fig. 10b, black line). At potentials above the polymer doping onset potential around 0.2 V vs. SHE a monotonous mass increase is seen over the entire potential interval with no apparent difference in mass change during the polymer doping (0.20–0.40 V vs. SHE for oxidation) and during pendant group redox conversion (0.4–0.65 V vs. SHE for oxidation). The mass change during polymer doping is dominated by charge compensating mass transport by anion uptake or cation expulsion and, as the mass change is largely unaffected by the pendant group redox chemistry it seems likely that the polymer doping is unaffected by the pendant group redox chemistry.

To further understand the mass changes during the redox processes in the polymer, Δm/Δn was evaluated, where Δn is the charge change in moles as evaluated by integrating the current response in the voltammogram (Fig. 11). In the region from 0.20 V to 0.40 V vs. SHE where the capacitive charging of the PPy backbone occurs, an average value of Δm/Δn of 23 g mol−1 was found. This mass is significantly less than that of the predominantly available anion, NO3−, which has a molar mass of 62.00 g mol−1. It can therefore be concluded that the positive charges in the polymer backbone are charge balanced by both anion uptake and cation expulsion. In an attempt to determine the relative contribution from anion uptake and cation expulsion we need to make some assumption regarding the identity of the cycling cation. The dominant cation in the electrolyte is Na+ that has a molar mass of 22.99 g mol−1 and we therefore suggest that this ion dominated the cation cycling. Based on the average mass change per charge of 23 g mol−1 the fraction of charges compensated by anion uptake is 54%, and the remaining 46% are compensated by cation expulsion. If, on the other hand, the more mobile proton is assumed to be responsible for cation cycling, the corresponding data for anion uptake and cation expulsion are 38% and 72% respectively.
 Fig. 11  Oxidative (red line) and reductive (blue line) CV scan of P1 during an EQCM in aqueous electrolyte at pH 2, the corresponding mass change per mole charge is marked in circles with red and blue respectively. After removal of the charge from HQ/BQ, the resulting mass change per mole charge change is presented in black circles. 
At potentials above 0.45 V vs. SHE, where the pendant group oxidation starts, there is a notable decrease on Δm/Δn indicated by red circles in Fig. 11. The Δm/Δn-analysis for the reduction sweep shows the reverse response (blue circles). In this region the charge is dominated by the HQ/BQ conversion and the Δm/Δn value does not reflect the polymer doping process alone. To address this issue, the charge from HQ/BQ conversion was removed by assuming a constant capacitance plateau, given by the capacitance well below the onset of the HQ/BQ redox process, during the HQ/BQ redox reaction. The corresponding Δm/Δn is shown as black circles in Fig. 11. Evidently, after removal of the HQ/BQ charge, the Δm/Δn became constant over the whole potential region with no obvious decrease during the pendant group redox conversion. The unchanged Δm/Δn value over the entire potential region suggests that the doping process of the polymer continues unaltered throughout the entire potential interval studied and that the doping process is thus unaffected by the pendant group redox conversion.

In situ conductance study

Fig. 12 shows the in situ conductance of P1, as evaluated from the current passing through the polymer film in a bipotentiostat setup using IDA electrodes with a potential bias of 10 mV between the two working electrodes, during CV experiments at pH 0 and at pH 2 together with voltammograms at the corresponding pHs. At both pHs the conductance increases monotonously with potential during the polymer doping process indicating that the number of available charge carriers increases with doping level. At pH 2, the conductance started to increase at around 0.1 V vs. SHE, which is in accordance with the onset doping potential as seen in the CV. The conductance increase during polymer doping is most evident at pH 0 where the conductance increases in the interval between 0.4 and 0.55 V. At the start of HQ oxidation the conductance-increase with potential halts and reaches a maximum at 0.57 V vs. SHE at pH 0 above which the conductance instead decreases over the entire HQ/BQ redox peak. As evident from the conductance measurements at the two pHs that selectively shifts the potential of the HQ/BQ redox reaction and not the PPy doping process (Fig. 5) the conductance drop is related to the pendant group redox conversion. Furthermore, an overall decrease of the conductance of the polymer was observed during continuously reciprocating scans, but the CV response remained almost the same (see ESI,† Fig. S3), indicating that there is no degradation and no charge losses in the polymer during scans. We suggest that the apparent conductance decrease might be due to the mechanical dis-attachment of some polymer from the IDA electrode upon cycling.

Compared to previously studied polymers with quinone and pyrrole linked by a methylene group,22 the new polymer P1 is more conductive at the end of the redox process than the one with a shorter linker which has almost no conductance at the end of the oxidation. The polymer with an aliphatic link between the pendant and the polymer backbone thus shows a stronger pendant-polymer interaction as compared to the CRP in this study, where a vinyl linker separates the two active moieties. Based on this observation we rule out the possibility of the conductance drop being a consequence of a direct electronic interaction between the two units. Instead we suggest that the degree of conductance drop reveals the effect of the length of linker in CRPs regarding the interaction between the CP and PG. A longer linker, as expected, weakens the steric interactions between the two subunits. The doping process of the CP backbone is not affected by the oxidation reaction of the PG. This is supported by the EQCM analysis in which the polymer continuously uptake anions. Additionally, the ATR-FTIR spectra showed that the intensity of the peak at 2700 cm−1, which is corresponding to the formation of charge carriers, continuously increases, also implying an unaffected doping process. As the oxidation of pendant group induced a conductivity drop, the enhanced pendant interactions upon oxidation could lead to the loss of conductance. During the oxidation process, more hydrogen bonds would form between the newly formed BQ and not yet oxidized HQ, and stronger interactions between PGs are expected. The packing induced force on the PGs should easily pass through the linker, and eventually affects the CP backbone due to lack of flexibility of the conjugated PG and CP structures. Therefore, the CP backbone is probably twisted by the strong PGs' interactions induced by the redox process. Nevertheless, the extent of the CP twisting seems not to affect continued doping, which means that more charge carriers should be generated, and that lower mobility due to the twisted CP structure may be the cause of the decrease in conductance. To solve this problem, a longer linker would be an option. However, the longer distance between the PGs and CP might have a negative impact on the kinetics of the charge transfer between the PGs and CP as well as between the PGs. Instead, a more rigid CP backbone, such as PEDOT,37 would be more favorable since its chemical structure ensures a stability that could withstand the forces induced by PGs.
Conclusions
The interaction between the backbone and the pendant groups in a conducting redox polymer consisting of polypyrrole and benzoquinone units connected via a vinyl linker was investigated by various methods. Although in situ EQCM and in situ ATR-FTIR show that the polymer doping process continues unhalted during pendant group redox conversion, it was found that the conductance decreases upon oxidation of the pendant groups. Since the polymer doping continuous even during oxidation of the pendant, we attribute the conductance drop to a reduced mobility of charge carriers caused by twisting of the polymer backbone as a result of strong interactions between pendant groups. Despite the conductance drop, scan rate dependent studies show that the material can be converted on a time-scale of seconds and hence that the CP backbone provides sufficient conductivity through the material to support high conversion rates.
