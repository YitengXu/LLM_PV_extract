    , Accepted 19th September 2019First published on 26th September 2019AbstractA facile and low-cost g-C3N4 surface modification approach using a biomass-derived liquid product is proposed in this work. Through the incorporation of renewable and sustainable bio-oil that is generated from a solar powered waste biomass pyrolysis, the surface functionality of a pristine g-C3N4 material is modified with functional groups that are of electron-withdrawing character, leading to the improvement of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate for the modified C3N4 sample. At low reaction temperature (120 °C), the sample is modified through a cleavage of C–N bonds between three heptazine fragments and tertiary nitrogen, followed by the bonding of oxygenated functional groups. As the reaction temperature increases further to a higher temperature (180 °C), a partial de-aromatization of the triazine network in the C3N4 sample due to the intercalation of functional groups from this post-synthesis bio-oil modification is further observed. The remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of the modified C3N4 sample higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 is observed, attributed to the synergistic effects of the extended visible light response, better separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and the enlarged specific surface area.
Introduction
Owing to the global energy crisis and environmental pollution, water splitting reaction to generate hydrogen fuel through various approaches such as electrolysis,1,2 photoelectrochemical process,3,4 radiolysis,5 thermal decomposition,6 and photocatalysis has become an area of great research interest.7 Since the photocatalysis approach uses natural solar energy and requires no corrosive electrolyte solution, it became a hot research topic and a variety of photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution have been developed.8–14 In particular, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was first discovered for photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution in 2009,11 and it has received huge attention as one of the most appealing and impressive carbon-based materials. Due to the unique physicochemical properties including semi-conductivity, special optical features, energy-storage capacity, and gas adsorption capacity, it could be potentially applied in aqueous contaminant decomposition, carbon dioxide conversion, fuel cells, photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, and gas storage.15–21 g-C3N4 is frequently prepared by the thermal polymerization of urea or melamine powders without the supply of enough oxygen during calcination, leading to the formation of a bulk structure.22 Compared to the widely-used photocatalyst anatase titanium oxide, possessing a large bandgap of ∼3.2 eV that significantly restricts the utilization of a broad spectrum of solar light,23 g-C3N4 has a narrower bandgap of 2.7 eV, enabling a wider sunlight utilization range.24 Besides, as a novel metal-free polymeric derived semi-conductor, g-C3N4 is of lower cost compared to high priced metallic catalysts.
While readily prepared g-C3N4 has a superior feature as a photocatalyst, its low specific surface area, poor visible light utilization efficiency, and high recombination rate of charge carriers largely suppress the photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production.25 A variety of modification strategies such as hetero-atom doping, defect chemistry, loading with precious metals, and nano-casting have then been developed in order to overcome the drawbacks.23,26–29 Amongst these approaches, hetero-atom doping is considered as a simple and effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 material. With the incorporation of inorganic elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon to control the C:N:O mass ratio of the materials, the visible light absorption and charge carrier separation could be improved in photocatalytic H2 evolution, resulting from the additionally-formed localized states.30 Currently hetero-atom doping modification processes predominantly involve sugars,31 glucose,30 or pure chemicals (barbituric acid32 and aldehydes26); however, those reagents are at relatively high cost and competing with food. A renewable and low-cost source bio-oil is therefore proposed in this work.
The bio-oil used is a product from the pyrolysis of biomass,33–36 containing different types of oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, phenols, esters, polysaccharides and multifunctional groups.37 It could be employed either as an alternative energy source or as a feedstock for purified chemicals.38–40 However, the bio-oil possesses problematic and unfavorable features during transportation and storage including corrosiveness, high viscosity, low energy density and low thermal stability. Due to the high oxygen contents, the heating value (HV) of crude bio-oil from pyrolysis is as extremely low as ∼17 MJ kg−1.40–42 Thus, the bio-oil needs to be properly upgraded to remove oxygenated chemical groups through a hydrotreatment or supercritical method.43 The current technology of improving bio-oil properties for dedicated applications is still at the fundamental scale, and most processes require complex and sophisticated systems and are still challenging for large scale application. In addition, while it has been investigated that some of the platform chemicals can be separated from liquid bio-oil through fractionation techniques including column separation,44–47 solvent extraction,48,49 phase separation,50 and molecular distillation,51 it is economically unattractive because of high costs for the recovery of the chemical and low concentrations for a specific chemical in the bio-oil.52,53 Alternatively, researchers have studied that crude bio-oil without any upgradation or separation can be directly employed as a modifier for an asphalt binder,54 a bio-based adhesive for metal-to-metal bonding,53 or an alternative carbon precursor for the preparation of carbonaceous-based porous materials through modifying the surface of a range of meso-structure silicas with bio-oil,55 demonstrating the feasibility that the surface of solid nanomaterials can be modified by the bio-oil.
This work provides another high-value bio-oil application in its original form. By using crude liquid bio-oil instead of depleting chemicals as surface modifiers, the photocatalytic performance of the C3N4 material under visible light radiation is significantly enhanced. The possible reaction mechanism for the surface modification of the C3N4 material is revealed according to the characteristic results and theoretical modeling. This could be a versatile way to develop “defective” photocatalysts for sustainable solar energy utilization and H2 conversion.
Experimental
The overall experiment in this work (shown in Fig. 1) contains (I) the preparation of bio-oil through solar powered biomass pyrolysis, (II) the synthesis of the carbon nitride samples by sonication and solvothermal reaction, and (III) the photocatalysis activity performance.

Preparation of bulk g-C3N4 sample
Bulk g-C3N4 is prepared by a thermal polymerization process. Typically, 10 g urea powders are placed in a ceramic crucible covered with a lid to confine the oxygen amount and heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a furnace and held for 2 hours. The bulk g-C3N4 sample is obtained after cooling down to room temperature. The pristine g-C3N4 sample is denoted as GCN.
Preparation of liquid bio-oil
The bio-oil is generated through a novel solar-powered biomass pyrolysis process.37 The solar pyrolysis experimental set-up is designed by our group and is equipped with a modified 5 kW cinema projector as a solar simulator. The Xenon arc lamps demonstrate similarity to real solar radiation incident on the surface of the earth, and a deep-dish parabolic concentrator within the housing is applied to create high-intensity solar band radiation. Pine sawdust, used as feed, is collected from beetle killed pine trees from a portion of the Rocky Mountains known as the Snowy Range, in Wyoming, USA. The pinewood is chopped, crushed, milled, and sieved. For solar pyrolysis experiments, 0.5 mm particle size was used. The pyrolysis process is carried out under the flux intensity of 301 suns. The reaction is practically completed in around 30 min as evidenced from the micro-GC system connected at the outlet of the condenser.
Preparation of modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts
A certain amount of the as-prepared bulk g-C3N4 is well-dispersed in isopropanol with 1-hour intensive sonication (QSonica LLC, Q700) at a power of 50 W. Subsequently the cloudy solution is mixed with liquid bio-oil (g-C3N4:bio-oil = 1:1 in weight) and heated at 180 °C for 10 hours. The precipitates are collected by filtration after naturally cooling to room temperature and washed several times with ethanol and water. After drying in a circulated oven at 80 °C, the solid is collected and labelled as ST-180. The carbon nitride sample modified at 120 °C is labelled as ST-120 in the same manner.
Sample characterization technique
X-ray diffraction (XRD) is conducted by using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA at an angle of reflection 2θ between 10 and 90°. The BET specific surface area of the samples is measured by using a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ automated gas sorption analyzer. XPS analysis is conducted using a ThermoScientific ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Organic elemental composition (C, H, N, O) is characterized by using a Vario MACRO Cube elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany). Microscopy images are obtained using an FEI Tecnai microscope. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are recorded on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique, and the spectra are obtained by collecting 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the measuring range of 4000–400 cm−1 wavenumbers. Solid-state MAS-NMR experiments are performed with a 4.0 mm triple resonance E-free CPMAS solid-state probe in a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C, with a spinning frequency of 8000 Hz. 13C–1H CP-MAS NMR spectra are recorded with cross-polarization, 9.9480 ms acquisition time, 40960 scans, 550 ppm sweep width, 100 ppm offset for 13C and 5 ppm for 1H, and 2 s relaxation delay. Magic angle calibration was done with KBr on 79Br, and frequency and shimming calibration with adamantane.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is carried out in a reaction cell connected to a gas-closed system. 20 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst is dispersed in 100 ml of water containing 10 vol% of triethanolamine (TEOA). The detailed experimental set-up is shown in Fig. S1.† 3 wt% of Pt acting as a cocatalyst is in situ photodeposited on the surface of the photocatalyst. A 250 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter is employed as the light source. Prior to the reaction, the system is purged with N2 for 30 minutes in order to completely remove the oxygen. The H2 concentration is finally analyzed by gas chromatography (SRI 8610C) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD), using high-purity argon as the carrier gas. The reaction temperature is around 25 °C during the reaction.
Results and discussion
The post-synthesis modification of the GCN sample is realized via a solvothermal approach with the incorporation of bio-oil (shown in Fig. 1). The solvent for the process is isopropanol (IPA) that was previously used to exfoliate bulk g-C3N4 into nanosheets owing to its appropriate surface energy. This enabled the C3N4 fragments to be highly stable and well-dispersed in IPA, which was beneficial for the solvothermal modification process.13 On the other hand, the IPA containing hydroxyl group has the impressive ability of dissolving bio-oils, resulting in a homogeneous solution mixture instead of a cloudy precipitate when using water as a solvent (Fig. S2†). A simple and novel biomass pyrolysis approach is employed by using a 5 kW solar simulator that can generate irradiance with stable spectral characteristics, investigated by our previous study (see Fig. S3†).37 The bio-oil with low cost and renewable features is generated through the high temperature decomposition/degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are the major components of pinewood.56,57 According to the 12 principles of green chemistry proposed by Paul Anastas and John Warner in 1988 emphasizing that a raw material of feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting wherever technically and economically practicable,58 it is of great interest to generate clean hydrogen fuel through efficient photocatalysis of the g-C3N4 material that is surface modified by biomass-derived bio-oil. Moreover, the bio-oil is generated from biomass resource and does not require further purification, which is considered as a renewable and cost-effective resource. The large-scale production of liquid bio-oil is feasible due to ample biomass sources. Some critical global issues such as insufficient storage locations for biomass wastes and negative environmental and regulation impacts from direct incineration of waste paper and waste crops will be addressed through the conversion of biowastes into high value-added products.
Compositional monitoring of solvothermal reaction
The bio-oil and the residual liquid solution after the solvothermal reaction is identified by GC, FTIR and liquid NMR analysis to demonstrate the successful surface modification process on carbon nitride samples.
The chemical composition in bio-oil is analyzed by GC-MS spectroscopy and the results are provided in Fig. 2A, showing that the compositions are complex: the compounds predominantly consist of oxygenated functional groups like carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, ester groups and ether groups as well as a quantity of aromatic groups, which are the derivatives of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The main types of liquid compounds in the bio-oil are summarized in Table S1† based on the NIST online database.59 The functional groups in the bio-oil sample are studied by FTIR shown in Fig. 2B, demonstrating that the bio-oil contains a variety of organic groups such as hydroxyl groups (3200–3500 cm−1), aliphatics (2800–2900 cm−1), aromatics (1660 cm−1) and C–O groups (1030 cm−1),60 which is indicative of the GC results. This can be evidenced from the NMR spectra of bio-oil (Fig. S4† in blue). The signals between 3 ppm and 4 ppm are assigned to the protons adjacent to the C–O groups possibly from ethers, alcohols, or esters.61,62 Intensive peaks in this range indicate that there is a significant number of C–O groups in bio-oil. These existing functional groups especially oxygenated groups are active in a solvothermal environment which significantly promotes the modification of the surface of the GCN material.
 Fig. 2  GC chromatogram (A) and FTIR spectra (B) of bio-oil from solar pyrolysis of pinewood pellets. 
After the solvothermal reaction, the composition of the residual liquid solution is analyzed. Indicated from the GC result, except existing oxygenated compounds in the solvent residue of the solvothermal reaction, a significant amount of nitrogen-containing compounds is discovered by GC-MS analysis such as propyl nitrite (C3H7NO2), 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (C3H6N2O2), 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (C3H6N2O2), and t-butylacetamide (C6H13NO), suggesting that the nitrogen groups decompose from the GCN materials and thus dissolve into the solvent solution during the modification. The NMR spectrum of the residual liquid solution is shown in Fig. S4† (in red). The weakened peaks after the reaction at 6–7 ppm imply that the C–O groups have been implanted onto the surface of g-C3N4 materials. Meanwhile, aliphatic protons (C–H) or amines (N–H) are also present in the post-reaction solution corresponding to the characteristic peaks between 1 ppm and 3 ppm,63 which is likely due to the detached amine groups from g-C3N4 materials and the break-down of long-chain oxygenated groups like ethers, alcohols, and/or esters. It is worth noting that intermolecular reactions between the organic species in the bio-oil will also take place under solvothermal conditions, resulting in an intensity change of the peaks in the NMR spectra (see Fig. S5†). The proportion of an aliphatic group in blank solution increases compared to that in bio-oil due to the self-reaction of bio-oil; this value further increases when the C3N4 sample is involved in the solvothermal reaction.
The functional groups in bio-oil are bonded in the form of C–O and C–H groups and will play an important role in improving the photocatalytic activity of GCN materials, contributed from the extended visible light absorption range and efficient charge carrier separation. The subsequent discussion will demonstrate that the surface modification process can speed up the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes and enlarge the specific surface area of the materials, suggesting the feasibility of the improvement of hydrogen generation efficiency through the GCN surface modification by bio-oil. Moreover, the bandgap of C3N4 materials can be narrowed through the bio-oil modification so as to increase the solar light utilization efficiency. The carbon nitride samples are thoroughly characterized by FTIR analysis, XRD analysis, microscopy, nitrogen porosimetry, and XPS analysis.
Textural and chemical characterization of GCN and MCN samples
The micromorphology features of the as-synthesized GCN and MCN samples are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3A, the GCN sample exhibits a dense and blocky morphology feature, resulting from the stacking of carbon nitride sheets. After the post-synthesis modification with bio-oil, due to the effective sonication of the materials, the layered structures with loose surfaces and small pores on the surface of the materials are observed, and the wrinkles and rolling edges make the thin nanosheets to be curly. It could also be attributed to the thermal reaction under a sealed environment, leading to the exfoliation of a carbon nitride layered structure, which is explained by a previous study.64,65 The functional groups can easily intercalate into its layered structure and selectively attach to the strand carbon atoms. Thus, the CN matrix is obviously swelled and delaminated. The exfoliation of layers could enlarge the specific surface area which promotes the photocatalytic activity rate. Besides, by introducing the organic groups onto the surface of the GCN material, the color dramatically changes from light yellow to dark beige as shown in the insets of Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  TEM images of GCN (A), ST-120 (B) and ST-180 (C) samples (inset: optical image of GCN sample (A) and ST-180 sample (C)). 
The textural properties of the as-fabricated samples are characterized by the nitrogen porosimetry analysis. All the isotherm plots in Fig. 4A display Type IV behavior with a H3 hysteresis loop, showing the mesoporosity of the materials.12,65 The BET specific surface area of ST-120 and ST-180 samples is 172 m2 g−1 and 222 m2 g−1, respectively, much higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 sample (56 m2 g−1). Correspondingly, the MCN samples possess a greater pore volume and pore size compared to the GCN sample, as shown in Table 1, resulting from the excellent porosity properties. This is consistent with the TEM results (Fig. 3). The photocatalysis between the catalysts and reactants initiates on the surface or at the interface, so the efficiency partly depends on the specific surface area of the materials.66 For instance, a larger surface area will supply more active sites to react with absorbed water and hydroxyl to form important oxidative hydroxyl radicals, as well as the improved mass transfer efficiency and reaction kinetics. To enlarge the specific area in this work, catalytically relevant defects have been inserted into the carbon nitride planar structure through the cleavage of C–N bonds from the (C6N7)–N–(C6N7)2 structure and the double –CN– bonds in the heterocycles, resulting from the incorporation of liquid bio-oil. Incomplete cyclization of the heptazine and incorporation of hybridized atoms will act as reaction sites and will be responsible for modifying energy levels.67 As the solvothermal reaction temperature increases to 180 °C, the C/N molar ratio increases from 0.72 to 0.85, and meanwhile the O atom molar% increases from 0.8 to 4.0, as shown in Table 1. The increased C/N molar ratio and O atom molar% calculated from XPS results indicate that the C–N groups in the sample are substituted by the oxygenated groups via the surface modification process, thus proving the successful insertion of oxygenated groups on the surface of the sample. This is confirmed by the XPS result as shown in Fig. 6. The BJH pore size distribution curves calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm are illustrated in Fig. 4B, showing that the MCN samples are rich in pores of size between 1 nm and 20 nm, further proving the mesoporous feature of the materials. Besides, with the increase of reaction temperature from 120 to 180 °C, the surface area, pore volume and pore size of the sample increases due to the stronger delamination effect and increased amounts of pores on the surface of the C3N4 nanosheets. This mesoporosity originating from the post-synthesis bio-oil modification process will improve mass transfer and reaction rates, thus giving rise to an improved reaction efficiency when the sample is utilized as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.

The FT-IR spectra of the carbon nitride samples are illustrated in Fig. 5. The characteristic signals for g-C3N4 could be observed from the spectra of all samples, indicating that the intact triazine structure remains in the product after the modification by bio-oil. The peak at 800 cm−1 and in the 1200–1750 cm−1 region is assigned to the bending vibrations of the triazine unit in C3N4 and the stretching vibrations of aromatic –CN bonds in condensed carbon–nitrogen heterocycles, respectively.8 The broad peak between 3000 and 3600 cm−1 is attributed to the amino (–NH) and hydroxyl (–OH) stretching accordingly. The absorption band at ∼1100 cm−1 corresponds to the C–O bond of hydroxyl groups, which is shown in the spectra of ST-120 and ST-180 samples. This suggests that the oxygen containing groups are present in these samples. It is worth noting that there is a new vibration band at 2850 cm−1 and 2920 cm−1 that is indexed to the symmetric and asymmetric –CH stretching vibrations, resulting from the deposition of –CH groups onto the C3N4 structure by the modification of bio-oil. Due to the strong bond of the CN heterocycles between 1200 and 1750 cm−1, the peak for the –CO bond may be overlapped and cannot be observed from FT-IR spectra. As for ST-120 and ST-180 samples, there is not much difference observed from the two spectra. Therefore, the FTIR spectra of the samples indicate that extra C–O groups and aliphatic groups are observed from MCN samples compared to the GCN sample. It could also be verified from the solid state NMR analysis of GCN, ST-120 and ST-180 samples (Fig. S6†). In the 13C NMR spectra, the dominant peaks at 165 ppm and 157 ppm are ascribed to the resonances for the sp2 hybridized C in the form of N–CN bond from heterocycles and the C atoms between three heptazine structures, respectively.68,69 Besides these two major signals, other less intensive peaks centered at 73.7 ppm and 20–40 ppm could also be observed for MCN samples, attributed to the carbon atom adjacent to an oxygen atom and an aliphatic carbon atom, respectively.70 This further confirms that the alcoholic and ether functional groups are incorporated onto the surface of the catalyst, which agrees with the XPS results in Fig. 7 and solution NMR results in Fig. S4.† This could also be supported by the fact that a more significant peak of the aliphatic group at ∼3.3 ppm is observed on the 1H NMR spectra of ST-120 and ST-180 samples compared to that of the GCN sample. However, due to the detection limit of solid state NMR and low concentration of the modified surface species, the signal for the additional organic components is relatively weak even with more than 40000 scans.
 Fig. 7  XPS spectra of C 1s (A) and N 1s (B) of GCN and MCN samples. 
The chemical states of the samples are probed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 6 shows the wide scan spectra of the GCN sample and MCN samples. Three different peaks are observed at 286 eV, 396 eV and 530 eV, correlating to C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, respectively.12 It is obvious that the intensity of the peak assigned to oxygen increases dramatically from the GCN sample to its MCN samples, indicating that there is a significant increase in oxygen concentration. The high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s are shown in Fig. 7A, which are fitted into four peaks at 288.2 eV, 287.7 eV, 285.8 eV, and 284.2 eV. The most intensive peak at 287.7 eV is indicative of the sp2-hybridized C (NC–N bond) in the triazine unit.71 The intensities of the peaks observed at 288.2 eV and 284.2 eV tend to increase after the solvothermal reaction as a result of the incorporation of C–O groups and sp2 C–C groups onto the surface of the materials, which is in agreement with the FTIR results. It should be noted that a broad peak located at 285.8 eV is observed from the XPS spectra of ST-120 and ST-180 samples, which is assigned to the sp2 C atom bonded to the NH2 group,64 resulting from the break of the C–N bonds between three heptazine fragments and the tertiary nitrogen atom ((C6N7)–N–(C6N7)2).
The deconvolution of the N 1s XPS signals for the samples in Fig. 7B shows three peaks with binding energies of 400.1 eV, 398.7 eV, and 398.2 eV, which arise from the sp2-hybridized aromatic atoms bonded to carbon atoms (CN–C), tertiary nitrogen (N-(C)3) groups linking structural heptazine (C6N7), and amino functional groups (C–N–H) originating from the defect of the C–N bonds, respectively. The Gaussian–Lorentzian functions are used to calculate the contribution ratio of different peaks in N 1s (Table 2), showing that after the solvothermal reaction at 180 °C, the contribution ratio of the peak assigned to the triazine unit decreases from 52.19% to 31.97%, whereas the ratio of 398.7 eV increases. This is related to the de-aromatization of the triazine unit.

The crystal structures of the pristine and thermally treated samples are recorded by XRD. Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns of GCN, ST-120 and ST-180 samples. The GCN sample shows a typical XRD pattern as in the literature. A strong peak at 27.4° indexes to the (002) plane of graphitic materials that is characteristic of the interplanar stacking peak of the conjugated aromatic systems, and a peak at 12.9° indexes to the (100) plane of graphitic materials, ascribed to the in-plane structure packing.72,73 The pattern of ST-120 is consistent with that of the pristine one, proving that the crystal structure of g-C3N4 is largely retained after the thermal treatment at 120 °C, whereas there is a slight decrease in the intensity of the peak at 12.9° and 27.4° for the ST-180 sample, resulting from the dissociation of the C–N structure. Specifically, the weak peak at 12.9° in the sample indicates the de-aromatization of the triazine unit. An additional reflex at 21.4° for ST-180 is caused by a partial distortion of a planarity of its openwork polymeric network.73 This is due to the oxidation of g-C3N4, which may give rise to the de-aromatization of some heterocycles (–CN– to –C(OC)–NH–). The de-aromatized heterocycles can also deform the planarity of a heptazine plane and promote the formation of an additional and much greater interplanar distance. This diffraction pattern essentially depends on the temperature of de-aromatization and is only observed for the high temperature sample (180 °C), which contributes to higher photocatalytic activity for this sample.
 Fig. 8  Powder XRD patterns of GCN and MCN samples. 
From the characterization of the samples, the modification mechanism of the C3N4 sample by the solvothermal process using bio-oil is proposed (shown in Fig. 9). With the thermal temperature of 120 °C, although the (002) plane and the (100) plane of the material have no significant change, there is a cleavage of C–N bonds between three heptazine fragments and the tertiary nitrogen atom ((C6N7)–N–(C6N7)2) to form an –NH2 bond, which can be reflected from XPS results. Simultaneously the amino group (–NH2) will be replaced or substituted by oxygenated groups and aliphatic groups in the bio-oil. A partial de-aromatization of the triazine network in the C3N4 sample will take place as the temperature increases to 180 °C. The C–N bonds between three heptazine units and the tertiary nitrogen atom will break along with the interaction of organic functional groups. On the other hand, the double bonds (–CN–) in the heterocycles will be disclosed at this temperature and the planarity of a triazine plane will be deformed, thus resulting in the formation of an additional and much greater interplanar distance. A reaction scheme describing the possible interactions between active species in the bio-oil and GCN material is proposed as shown in Scheme S1.† Besides, due to the dominant percentages of alcoholic and ether groups in bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of pinewood pellets (see NMR results in Fig. S4†), the attached functional groups on the surface of GCN materials are mainly C–O and C–H groups. It is speculated that containing bio-oil will have a significant impact on the as-synthesized MCN samples. In future work, how significant the biomass type will influence the liquid bio-oil and corresponding modified carbon nitride catalysts for hydrogen evolution will be investigated.

Optical properties and photocatalytic activity performance of GCN and MCN samples
Surface modification would have a significant impact on the light response properties of the samples, characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and the corresponding band gap plots are shown in Fig. 10A and B, respectively. A red shift of the band edge absorption after the surface modification is clearly observed from the figure as a result of the changed electron and microscopic structure by the modification of functional groups containing carbon and oxygen atoms on the sample surface. The gradual destruction of the co-polymeric unit leads to defects on the surface accompanied by the substitution of N atoms by C/O atoms that will increase the density and distribution of localized states, and thus the operational visible light range will be extended, which is intuitively shown in Fig. 10A. It should be noted that the enhanced absorption of the MCN samples in the visible light region could partially be attributed to the deeper sample color (see Fig. 3) ranging from yellow to grey.74 The band gap energies of the GCN, ST-120 and ST-180 samples are calculated to be 2.57 eV, 2.54 eV and 2.50 eV, respectively, according to the plots of (αhv)1/2versus hv (shown in Fig. 10B). The reduced band gap enables the sample to have high visible light harvesting properties and thus producing more photogenerated charge carriers for hydrogen generation.

The XPS valence band spectra of the samples are plotted in Fig. 11A, determining the valence band (VB) potential. The VB energy levels of the GCN, ST-120, and ST-180 samples are located at 1.40 eV, 1.30 eV, and 1.26 eV, respectively, suggesting that the VB potential of the carbon nitride sample shifts to a negative position owing to the surface modification process. This could be explained by the reconstruction of the π-conjugated electrons due to the incorporation of an organic monomer onto the carbon nitride material.64,75 Based on the above data, the calculated electronic band structures of the resulting photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 11B. The conduction band (CB) potentials, the valence band potentials, and the band gap energies of the photocatalysts are altered after bio-oil incorporation, which is important for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. The modified samples show narrower band gaps for increasing the visible light harvesting capability. The CB potential of the modified samples tends to be more negative than that of the GCN sample, thus resulting in a stronger reducibility that is beneficial for photocatalytic H2 evolution.
 Fig. 11  XPS valence band spectra (A) and schematic illustration of the electronic band structures (B) of the carbon nitride samples. 
The photoluminescence spectra of the GCN and MCN samples excited at 350 nm are illustrated in Fig. 10C. The dominant peak of the samples at ∼480 nm is attributed to the band-to-band recombination of holes and electrons under visible light radiation. Reduced intensities of the peaks observed for ST-120 and ST-180 samples suggest that the surface modification for the sample leads to the successful suppression of radiative electron–hole recombination. The fluorescence decays much faster for the modified carbon nitride samples compared to the GCN sample as shown in Fig. 10D, presumably due to the charge transfer of the electrons and holes to new localized states. This further confirms that the recombination of charge carriers is successfully suppressed by the incorporation of functional groups that creates the defects of the structure. The lifetimes of charge carriers are calculated and listed in Fig. 10D-inset. The decay of the fluorescence follows the principle: It = Ioe−kt, where Io represents the initial fluorescence intensity and k is a decay constant. The lifetime τ here is calculated as the intensity It decays to 1/e of Io.74,76 As expected, both the lifetime components (τ1 and τ2), representing radiative and non-radiative processes, are shortened after the surface modification process, implying the suppression of the electron–hole pair recombination. This result is also consistent with the fact in Fig. 10A showing that the increased band-tail related adsorption band would increase the density of band tails/localized states induced by the surface modification of bio-oil. New localized states may act as shallow trap states of photogenerated charge carriers, promoting the weakening of the PL intensity and the shortening of the PL lifetime.12
To verify the enhanced photocatalytic ability of the MCN sample induced by the synergistic effects of the extended visible light absorption range, efficient separation of charge carriers and enlarged surface areas, the sample is evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, which is performed in an aqueous solution containing 10 vol% of triethanolamine as an electron donor. 3 wt% of H2PtCl6 is used as a cocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution rate is obtained by three repeated tests (Table S2†). The visible light is simulated by using a 250 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The generated H2 concentration is monitored by gas chromatography with high-purity argon as the carrier gas. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the modified sample is 1654 μmol g−1 h−1 as a function of wt% Pd under visible light irradiation, which is around 3.4 times as high as that of the GCN sample, although the porosimetry shows that the corresponding MCN sample has a 4-fold larger specific surface area. This is due to the fact that not all increased surface and interfaces on the modified samples will contribute to the photocatalytic performance. The rational defects generated by bio-oil modification or the edges of the molecular clusters have more active sites for the reactions, whereas the regions without surface modifications or the surfaces generated from the delamination of a planar structure by ultra-sonication are less effective. Our study and previous studies indicate that the increased photocatalytic rate is frequently not proportional to the increased specific surface area value.12,77 It is also observed that very little hydrogen is generated under dark conditions and without a catalyst in the presence of light (Table S3†). Explained from catalyst characterization, it can be seen that the oxygenated sample displays enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity due to the synergistic effects of the extended visible light response, improved separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and the enlarged specific surface area. Fig. 12B shows that the amount of evolved hydrogen increases in prolonging the photocatalytic reaction time. Moreover, a control experiment (ST-180-4 without oil) was carried out, and the sample was prepared in the same approach but without the bio-oil. Its photocatalytic performance (503 μmol g−1 h−1) is less improved compared to that of the sample prepared with bio-oil, implying that the C3N4 sample has been oxidized by bio-oil and the catalytic activity is therefore enhanced.

The optical and photocatalytic results indicate that the modification of the carbon nitride sample by liquid bio-oil results in superior visible response compared to the bare GCN sample. The photocatalytic experiments using MCN samples and GCN samples demonstrate that the modification process improves the photocatalytic performance. Theoretical modeling of the monolayer GCN sample and MCN sample is calculated based on the first principles theory and shown in Fig. S9.† The incorporation of organic oxygenated groups onto the surface of the sample could lead to the different distributions of HOMO and LUMO.78 Intuitively, the sample displays a wider distribution region over the molecular unit for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) after surface modification, located away from the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), indicative of the beneficial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, thus leading to an improved photocatalytic performance. However, it should be noted that this modeling carbon nitride structure may not represent the experimental structure quantitatively due to the complexity of the bio-oil, resulting in an uncertainty of the incorporated organic functional chains. Besides, the bond energy of the C–N bond between three heptazine units and the tertiary nitrogen atom and CN bond in the triazine unit is calculated to be 282 kJ mol−1 and 485 kJ mol−1, respectively, supporting that the C–N bond will break at relatively low temperature (120 °C) whereas the de-aromatization process will occur at high solvothermal reaction temperature (180 °C).
Conclusions
In summary, the surface of g-C3N4 is modified through the solvothermal reaction process with the low-cost and renewable bio-oil. From the catalyst characterization through XPS, FTIR and XRD analyses, the introduction of elemental O into g-C3N4 induces the formation of the oxygenated functional groups such as C–O and CO groups, which play a significant role in improving the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes as electron-withdrawing groups, and thus providing an enhanced photocatalytic performance. The low temperature (ST-120) sample is modified through a break of C–N bonds between three heptazine fragments and tertiary nitrogen, followed by the replacement of oxygenated groups and aliphatic groups, whereas a partial de-aromatization of the triazine network in the C3N4 sample has been observed as the reaction temperature further increases to a higher temperature (180 °C). Moreover, the nitrogen porosimetry results and TEM images demonstrate that the MCN samples possess a remarkable mesoporosity feature including a higher BET specific surface area, larger pore size and larger pore volume compared to the GCN sample, thus improving mass transfer and reaction rates and giving rise to an improved photocatalytic reaction efficiency. Owing to the extended visible light response and improved separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes, reflected from optical characterization, the modified catalyst demonstrates a higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution rate of ST-180 (1654 μmol g−1 h−1) is observed to be 3.4 times higher than that of the GCN sample (483 μmol g−1 h−1). This work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy for the surface modification of the g-C3N4 material that can convert solar energy especially for the visible light range to hydrogen energy.
