    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 17th September 2020AbstractWe perform a thermodynamic analysis of the energetic cost of CO2 separation from flue gas (0.1 bar CO2(g)) and air (400 ppm CO2) using a pH swing created by electrochemical redox reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer from molecular species in aqueous electrolyte. In this scheme, electrochemical reduction of these molecules results in the formation of alkaline solution, into which CO2 is absorbed; subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the reduced molecules results in the acidification of the solution, triggering the release of pure CO2 gas. We examined the effect of buffering from the CO2–carbonate system on the solution pH during the cycle, and thereby on the open-circuit potential of an electrochemical cell in an idealized four-process CO2 capture-release cycle. The minimum work input varies from 16 to 75 kJ molCO2−1 as throughput increases, for both flue gas and direct air capture, with the potential to go substantially lower if CO2 capture or release is performed simultaneously with electrochemical reduction or oxidation. We discuss the properties required of molecules that would be suitable for such a cycle. We also demonstrate multiple experimental cycles of an electrochemical CO2 capture and release system using 0.078 M sodium 3,3′-(phenazine-2,3-diylbis(oxy))bis(propane-1-sulfonate) as the proton carrier in an aqueous flow cell. CO2 capture and release are both performed at 0.465 bar at a variety of current densities. When extrapolated to infinitesimal current density we obtain an experimental cycle work of 47.0 kJ molCO2−1. This result suggests that, in the presence of a 0.465 bar/1.0 bar inlet/outlet pressure ratio, a 1.9 kJ molCO2−1 thermodynamic penalty should add to the measured value, yielding an energy cost of 48.9 kJ molCO2−1 in the low-current-density limit. This result is within a factor of two of the ideal cycle work of 34 kJ molCO2−1 for capturing at 0.465 bar and releasing at 1.0 bar. The ideal cycle work and experimental cycle work values are compared with those for other electrochemical and thermal CO2 separation methods.

Broader context
CO2 emission primarily from fossil fuel combustion is causing climate change at an alarming rate. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has attracted R&D investment due to its potential to remove CO2 from combustion exhaust. Although pilot-scale amine-based CCS at fossil-fired power plants has been demonstrated, the required heat input and the associated amine degradation and evaporative losses at elevated temperature may hinder its wide application. Here we present an electrochemically driven CO2 separation approach that relies on a solution pH swing driven by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) of small molecules, and requires electrical but no thermal input. Electrochemical reduction of these molecules de-acidifies an aqueous solution, which then absorbs CO2; subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the reduced molecules acidifies the solution, triggering the release of pure CO2 gas. Our analysis suggests the minimum electrical work input of this approach is 16–75 kJ molCO2−1, depending on the throughput, for both CO2 separation from air and a typical flue gas with 0.1 bar CO2. We demonstrate this approach experimentally using a flow cell with an aqueous-soluble phenazine-based electrolyte that undergoes PCET. The resulting energy cost of 47 kJ molCO2−1 in the low-current-density limit is compared to other methods.

Introduction
Accumulating CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels1 are resulting in an alarming rate of climate change. Consequently, there are increasing efforts worldwide to reduce societal reliance on fossil fuel-based energy and to switch to carbon-free sources such as nuclear, solar, wind and geothermal.2 According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, average atmospheric CO2 concentrations have to stay below roughly 500 ppm in order to avoid severe consequences of global warming (greater than 2 °C above pre-industrial era levels) and irreversibly deleterious changes to natural habitats and ecosystems that would threaten the viability of human civilization.3 Given, however, that the global rate of transition to low-carbon sources is presently not nearly fast enough to avoid this threshold, other approaches are urgently required to deal with the problem of rising CO2 concentrations.
Among the most promising of these is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), in which CO2 is separated from a point source4 (e.g., flue gas from a coal or natural gas power plant), compressed, and sequestered away from the atmosphere. A variant on this idea is direct air capture (DAC),5 in which CO2 is captured directly from ambient air, compressed and sequestered. These strategies recognize the continued use of fossil fuels while combating atmospheric CO2 accumulation. In principle, the pure CO2 obtained after separation can be converted back into chemical fuels with carbon-free energy, thus providing fuels without added CO2 emissions; this is an active research area.
CO2 separation from mixed gases is the most energetically demanding step of CCS, and much effort has gone into developing separation techniques that expend as little energy as possible per unit of CO2 captured. Most well-developed means for doing so are “temperature-swing” cycles that involve contacting CO2 with a strongly basic sorbent in an absorption process, and then heating the CO2-rich sorbent to release pure CO2 and regenerate the sorbent. The overall heat input required for sorbent regeneration in temperature-swing cycles, however, is high (>100 kJ molCO2−1) as compared to the minimum thermodynamic free energy requirement for carbon capture from air (20 kJ molCO2−1) or flue gas with 0.1 bar CO2 (6 kJ molCO2−1).6 It is worth noting that CCS from flue gas with a monoethanolamine (MEA)-based liquid sorbent would require roughly 30% of the heat energy produced by coal-powered plants from combustion to be consumed by carbon capture,4 thereby making it unavailable for electricity production. Although the energy consumption of amine-based technologies has been improved with functionalized solvents,7 amine blends,8 water-lean systems7,9,10etc., and several power plants with more than 1000 tonne CO2/day uptake capacity have been demonstrated for post-combustion capture,11,12 other limitations such as sorbent degradation, evaporative losses, toxicity, and corrosivity raise concerns for wide application.9 As a result, other CO2 capture sorbents and strategies are actively being explored both in fundamental research and industry.
The use of hydroxide (OH−) in alkaline aqueous solutions to capture CO2, in the reactions OH− + CO2 → HCO3− and, subsequently, HCO3− + OH− → CO32− + H2O, has received renewed interest in recent years as part of a viable separation approach. DAC using strongly alkaline (pH > 14) solution to absorb CO2 in a high-surface-area contactor, followed by a chemical regeneration cycle that uses thermal energy to subsequently release it from solid carbonate precipitates,13,14 has begun commercialization. This process has an energetic cost that is comparable to that of many temperature-swing-based processes, but its potentially low financial cost ($94–$232 per tonneCO2) for DAC makes practical application more feasible.14
Developing simple and low-cost CCS approaches that use alkaline solutions thus represents a substantial opportunity in emissions mitigation. In this paper, we study an electrochemically mediated CO2 separation approach that uses a large electrochemically-induced swing in solution pH to absorb and release CO2 and requires electrical but no thermal energy input.15 This approach relies on the use of small molecules that undergo proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in aqueous solution. Electrochemical reduction/oxidation (“redox”) of these molecules results in proton uptake/release, respectively,16,17 resulting in changes in solution pH18 which, if large enough, can cause CO2 to be strongly absorbed at high pH and released at low pH.19,20 The maximum achievable pH increases with the pKa of the reduced form of the PCET-active redox couple, and its solubility.
There has been extensive research into organic molecules capable of PCET, in part because it is pivotal in many biological energy-conversion processes such as respiration and photosynthesis.21 Quinone-based molecules that undergo 2H+, 2e− PCET with fast kinetics are particularly ubiquitous in the field of aqueous organic redox-flow batteries (RFBs).22–31 One major drawback in using quinones as reactants for CO2 separation, however, is that they typically have pKa values that are <13.0, and solubilities <1.0 M. 1,2-Benzoquinone-3,5-disulfonic acid (or its reduced form: tiron) is a rare exception in the latter category, with a reported solubility of >2.0 M in 1 M sulfuric acid, however its chemical instability in water32 renders it unattractive for electrochemical CO2 separation.
Aza-aromatic redox-active compounds24 are potentially more promising in terms of both high solubility and pKa. Although it does not participate in PCET for most of the 0–14 pH range, quinoxaline has been shown to have a solubility above 4.0 M in water and in weakly alkaline aqueous solution.33 Some phenazines also participate in 2H+, 2e− PCET up to at least pH 14. Wang et al., have presented Pourbaix diagrams of 2-hydroxyphenazine (HP), 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenazine (AHP), and benzo[a]hydroxyphenazine-7/8-carboxylic acid (BHPC) with slopes of −57.9, −65.8 and −61 mV pH−1, respectively, in 7–14 pH range.34 However, although these molecules have high solubility (1.7 M for HP, 0.43 M for AHP and 1.55 M for BHPC) at pH 14, their low solubility in neutral solution (0.44 mM for HP, 0.57 mM for AHP and 16 mM for BHPC) prevents them from swinging the pH down to values <5 needed for an effective capture-release cycle. Phenazine dihydroxysulfonic acid (DHPS) has high solubility (1.8 M), and it is reasonably chemically stable (i.e., decomposing at <1%/day).35 We discuss and criticize a CO2 capture/release system using DHPS in the Discussion section.
In this paper we carry out a thermodynamic analysis of the energetic cost of this electrochemical process and calculate the minimum required electrical energy input per mole of CO2 for an ideal four-process cycle based on the potential difference between applied reduction and oxidation potentials vs. pH. The results show the ideal cycle work input for this scheme is 16–75 kJ molCO2−1, depending on the separation throughput per cycle, for capture from both flue gas and atmosphere. PCET with organic molecules that undergo kinetically rapid redox reactions is a promising electrochemical basis for practicable CCS, as it may both reduce energetic losses and lower overall costs per ton of CO2 separated, due to the potential low cost of these chemicals.
Experimentally, we demonstrate an electrochemical CO2 capture and release system using 0.078 M sodium 3,3′-(phenazine-2,3-diylbis(oxy))bis(propane-1-sulfonate) (DSPZ) as the proton carrier in an aqueous flow cell. Multiple continuous cycles of CO2 absorption and desorption at a steady 0.465 bar CO2 partial pressure were performed at current densities of 40 to 150 mA cm−2, and the net electrical work input of the cycle at each current density was measured. The electrical work input extrapolated to infinitesimal current, where ohmic, electron transfer and mass transport overpotentials should be eliminated, was 47.0 kJ molCO2−1. From these results, we estimate that, in the low-current-density limit, the cycle work for capturing from a CO2 partial pressure of 0.465 bar and releasing into 1 bar CO2 to be our measured energy cost of 47.0 kJ molCO2−1 plus the thermodynamic minimum work of 1.9 kJ molCO2−1, i.e., 48.9 kJ molCO2−1, for concentrating the CO2. This value may be compared with the ideal cycle work of 34 kJ molCO2−1 for the latter conditions. The results offer promise for further development and provide guidance on the design of future low energy electrochemical CCS devices. We also demonstrate, for the first time, a stable and multi-cycle electrochemical flow cell CCS device.
Thermodynamic analysis
In order to effect large changes in solution pH using PCET in aqueous media containing CO2, buffering from inorganic carbon species must be overcome. Thus, we first examine the dependence of pH on the constituents of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species present in solution, namely aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)), bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbonate (CO32−):36 DIC = [CO2(aq)] + [HCO3−] + [CO32−](1)
The relative ratios of these species at equilibrium is dictated by the reactions between aqueous CO2 and water: (2)where K1 and K2 are the first and second dissociation constants of carbonic acid (H2CO3), respectively, and defined as the following equilibrium constants: (3) (4)
For a solution of zero salinity, K1 and K2 are 1.1 × 10−6 M and 4.1 × 10−10 M,37 resulting in the first and second pKa for carbonic acid being 6.0 and 9.4, respectively. Thus, in acidic solutions of pH < 6 total DIC is composed primarily of dissolved CO2(aq), in basic solutions of pH > 9 total DIC is composed primarily of carbonate anions, and for the intermediate pH range total DIC is composed primarily of bicarbonate anions.36 Because CO2(aq), being uncharged, is the only form that exchanges with the atmosphere, increasing the pH of a solution drives down the activity of CO2(aq), leading to net dissolution of CO2(g) as CO2(aq) and conversion to bicarbonate and/or carbonate. Correspondingly, decreasing the pH raises the activity of CO2(aq), leading to outgassing. This provides a mechanism for selectively absorbing CO2 from a mixture of gases, and then releasing a pure stream at a separate point for sequestration. Given that certain bicarbonate/carbonate compounds have exceptionally high solubilities (>3 M at room temperature) in water, this strategy affords a potential pathway for high-throughput separation of CO2 from air or flue gas. Additionally, the fact that the entire process takes place in the liquid phase offers a potentially simpler and lower-cost CCS route as compared to schemes in which, having absorbed CO2 using alkaline solution, precipitation and heating of solid carbonates is required to release gaseous CO2.13,14,38
We envision a thermodynamic cycle comprising a series of alternating electrochemical and gas–liquid exchange processes: (1) electrochemical acidification of an electrolyte at constant DIC concentration, resulting in supersaturation of aqueous CO2; (2) outgassing of pure CO2 gas at the collection stream until gas–liquid equilibrium is reached; (3) electrochemical de-acidification of the electrolyte, resulting in strongly alkaline electrolyte; and (4) invasion of CO2 from air/flue gas into the alkaline electrolyte. During each process, the constituents of DIC and pH can be described based on CO2–carbonate and water dissociation equilibria, as well as the principle of charge conservation. Based on the definition of DIC set forth in eqn (1), the concentration of each component of DIC as a function of total DIC and [H+] is given by36 (5) (6) (7)
An additional constraint arises from the water dissociation equilibrium  resulting in [H+][OH−] = 10−14 M2(8)
The total alkalinity (TA) of the solution under consideration is defined as36 TA ≡ [OH−] + [HCO3−] + 2[CO32−] − [H+](9)
Given the ionic species present, and assuming the electrolyte salt comprises cationic and anionic species S+ and S−, respectively, results in: [S+] − [S−] = TA(10)

Eqn (10) follows from imposing a charge neutrality constraint in solution. It is important to note that PCET, involving the transfer of protons between a small molecule Q and solution, may directly change the solution TA. To understand this, consider the case of an electrochemical redox reaction such as Q + e− + xH+ ↔ QHxx−1 where x is the number of protons transferred per electron. To the extent that the satisfaction of charge neutrality following the reduction of Q is not fully accounted for by a change in DIC, [H+] or [OH−] content of the solution, it would result in a net increase in TA – i.e., either via a transfer of S− out of the solution or a transfer of S+ into it. Likewise, oxidation of QHxx−1 might yield a net decrease in TA. Changes in TA cause changes in pH; we stress, however, that TA and pH are not linearly related to each other: electrochemically induced perturbations to TA affect pH only subject to equilibria represented by eqn (5)–(9) being satisfied. In other words, PCET provides a driving force for pH swing through changing TA, but actual changes in pH depend on buffering from the CO2–carbonate equilibrium.
We determine the minimum work required to separate CO2 from a mixed gas stream using an electrically-driven pH-swing cycle involving these chemical and electrochemical processes. The four processes described above are represented schematically in Fig. 1, in which process 1 → 2 and 3 → 4 are constant DIC, electrochemical processes – associated with electrical energy input/output – whereas processes 2 → 3 and 4 → 1 involve gas–liquid exchange of CO2 at open circuit potential and constant TA. All processes are assumed to be isothermal.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of electrochemical CO2 separation cycle, showing flow of liquid electrolyte (in blue lines) and gas (dashed red lines) between the electrochemical cell and gas–liquid exchange chambers, with various states numbered. Processes between numbered states are: electrochemical acidification (1 → 2), CO2 outgassing (2 → 3), electrochemical de-acidification (3 → 4) and CO2 invasion (4 → 1). 
We first perform a preliminary calculation to determine the equilibrium TA at State 1, i.e., after CO2 invasion and before electrochemical acidification, for given values of DIC and CO2 partial pressure. Fig. 2 shows the result of this analysis, in which solutions were found to the system of eqn (5)–(9) for two initial CO2 partial pressures: 0.1 bar and 400 ppm CO2(g), which correspond to the CO2 concentration of flue gas from a typical coal power plant and atmospheric CO2, respectively. [CO2(aq)] is assumed to be fixed based on a Henry's Law constant of 35 mM/bar at room temperature. The results show that for both conditions, TA has an almost linear relationship to DIC, with DIC = 0.86 × TA at 0.1 bar CO2(g), and 0.53 × TA at 400 ppm CO2(g). Solution pH also increases with DIC, settling close to 8.6 in the limit of high DIC at 0.1 bar CO2(g) (Fig. 2a) and 9.8 at 400 ppm CO2 (Fig. 2b). An important reference point for these results is seawater in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, which mainly comprises HCO3− and is known to have a natural pH of about 8.1 for a DIC of ∼2 mM.36 Results in Fig. 2b are consistent with this expectation, as at a DIC of 2 mM the solution pH is 8.1.
 Fig. 2  DIC (black) and pH (red) as functions of TA at CO2 partial pressures of (a) 0.1 bar and (b) 400 ppm. 
We next consider the minimum concentration of PCET-active molecules required for process 1 → 2 i.e., electrochemical acidification of the electrolyte at a fixed DIC. Fig. 3 shows the minimum concentration of a hypothetical small molecule capable of concerted 2H+, 2e− PCET that is required to convert all DIC to CO2(aq). CO2 concentrations at the CO2-rich gas inlet of 0.1 bar and 400 ppm were considered, and the TA at State 1 was calculated based on the relationship between DIC and TA shown in Fig. 2. Conversion of all carbonate/bicarbonate was deemed complete at the point where 99% of DIC is composed of CO2(aq), after electrochemical acidification via QH2 oxidation. For both inlet conditions, a linear relationship between DIC and minimum concentration of QH2, or [QH2]min, was obtained, with [QH2]min equal to 0.57 × DIC for the inlet with 0.1 bar CO2, and 0.93 × DIC for that with 400 ppm CO2, for DIC values in the range between 0 and 2.5 M.
 Fig. 3  Minimum concentration of QH2 required to convert 99% of all DIC to CO2(aq). 
We now calculate the minimum work input required to separate CO2 in the ideal cycle defined above. As an example of a desirable implementation, we assume an inlet CO2 partial pressure of 0.1 bar and a starting [QH2] of 1.4 M, which translates to a maximum convertible DIC of 2.46 M. The minimum work input is sensitive to two important parameters: the ratio of partial pressures of CO2 at the exit to inlet stream, which we term the ‘exit/inlet pressure ratio’, and the CO2 supersaturation at State 2, the start of outgassing. We define CO2 supersaturation here as the ratio of [CO2(aq)] at the start of outgassing compared to equilibrium value of [CO2(aq)] at the exit. As the exit/inlet pressure ratio increases, the work of separation increases. CO2 supersaturation at State 2, which we denote hereafter as ‘outgassing overpressure’, is proportional to CO2 separation throughput as, for a given exit/inlet pressure ratio, it is a measure of how much dissolved CO2 can be released in a single cycle. For the implementation under consideration, an exit/inlet pressure ratio of 10 was assumed (i.e., 1 bar of pure CO2(g) at the exit stream, for 0.1 bar inlet partial pressure), resulting in an outgassing overpressure of 69. Fig. 4a shows the pH of the solution as a function of Q concentration during electrochemical acidification, going from initial pH of 8.7 to 4.3 when complete conversion is achieved.
 Fig. 4  pH as a function of Q, QH2, and CO2(aq) concentrations for an ideal CO2 separation cycle with inlet and outlet CO2(g) of 0.1 and 1 bar, respectively, during (a) electrochemical acidification (process 1 → 2, in red) (b) CO2 outgassing at 1 bar CO2(g) (process 2→ 3, in green) (c) electrochemical de-acidification (process 3 → 4, in blue) and (d) CO2 invasion (process 4 → 1, in magenta), at the end of which aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)) is assumed to be in equilibrium with 0.1 bar CO2 gas. A starting value of [QH2] of 1.4 M and a DIC value at State 1 of 2.46 M are assumed. 
For the outgassing process 2 → 3 (Fig. 4a), eqn (5)–(9) are solved subject to the constraint that TA is fixed and, that at the end of the process, [CO2(aq)] relaxes to its equilibrium value at 1 bar of 35 mM. After this, process 3 → 4 (electrochemical de-acidification) is evaluated with DIC fixed at its value at State 3, using parameters from State 3 as inputs (Fig. 4c); the pH goes from 6 to ∼14.5 as the concentration of QH2 increases. CO2 invasion (Fig. 4d) then occurs, completing the cycle and restoring State 1. The relationship between DIC and pH throughout the cycle is shown in Fig. 5, whereas that between pH and [CO2(aq)] is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For comparison, an ideal cycle assuming a more moderate reactant solubility (i.e., the lower of Q and QH2 solubilities) of 0.1 M (resulting in DIC at State 1 of 0.175 M) is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). An important consequence of the lower solubility is that the pH after electrochemical de-acidification (process 3 → 4) is 13, rather than 14.5; this is a direct result of the lesser degree of de-acidification afforded by the removal of 0.2 M H+ from solution, as opposed to 2.8 M H+ (i.e., assuming 2H+, 2e− redox processes in both the 0.1 M and 1.4 M solubility cases). As will be discussed presently, the pH attained after the deacidification process 3 → 4 is an important metric that constrains the selection of viable molecules for electrochemical CCS. It is also important to note that based on the relationship between DIC value and minimum [QH2] required for full acidification shown in Fig. 3, the concentration of QH2 at State 1 constrains combinations of exit/inlet pressure ratio and outgassing overpressure that may be used in an ideal cycle. An illustration of this is given in Fig. S3 (ESI†), which shows lines of constant [QH2] for different exit/inlet pressure ratios and outgassing overpressures. As expected, higher outgassing overpressures and exit/inlet pressure ratios require higher concentrations of starting [QH2] to run a cycle.
 Fig. 5  DIC vs. pH during the 4-process cycle (solid lines) described in Fig. 4. At each numbered state, DIC, [CO2(aq)], and equilibrium CO2(g) corresponding to the value of [CO2(aq)] are reported. The orange and cyan dashed lines refer to DIC vs. pH during two-stage acidification and de-acidification, respectively, in which electrochemical acidification and de-acidification are each performed in two stages: acidification at constant DIC up to [CO2(aq)] = 35 mM, followed by outgassing and further acidification in tandem at constant [CO2(aq)] until [Q] reaches 1.4 M; and de-acidification at constant DIC up to [CO2(aq)] = 3.5 mM, followed by invasion and further de-acidification in tandem at constant [CO2(aq)] until [QH2] reaches 1.4 M. 
In calculating the energetic cost per mole of CO2 separated, we note that only processes 1→ 2 and 3 → 4 involve work inputs/outputs to or from the electrochemical cell, respectively. Using the Nernst equation and assuming dilute solutions, we relate the pH during each of those processes to the redox potential (ER) of the electrode at which conversion between the pairs of the Q/QH2 redox couple occurs: ER = E0 − (59 mV × pH) where E0 is the redox potential under standard conditions, in which pH = 0.

Fig. 6 shows the result of this calculation for electrochemical acidification and de-acidification, where the area between the potential profiles represents the net electrical energy input. Dividing this area by the DIC released, i.e., the absolute difference in DIC between states 1 and 3, yields the overall work input per mole of CO2 captured, , which may be represented as follows: (11)Here, F is Faraday's constant of 96485 C mol−1, ΔDIC represents the difference in DIC before and after CO2 outgassing, E is redox potential, and the factor of 2 results from the assumption that each Q/QH2 species undergoes a 2-electron redox process. In the implementation under consideration, the net electrical work input is 50 kJ molCO2−1.
 Fig. 6  Redox potential as a function of Q concentration during electrochemical acidification (red line, process 1 → 2) and de-acidification (blue line, process 3 → 4) for ideal CO2 separation cycle of Fig. 5. The orange and cyan dashed lines refer to redox potential vs. Q concentration during two-stage acidification and de-acidification described in Fig. 5, respectively. 
Following a program similar to that sketched out above, Fig. 7 shows the ideal cycle work input required for CO2 separation from inlet streams with 0.1 bar CO2 (Fig. 7a) and 400 ppm CO2 (Fig. 7b), for exit/inlet pressure ratios that result in CO2 release around 1 bar at a variety of outgassing overpressures. Ideal cycle work is compared to the thermodynamic minimum work of separation required to provide the increase in CO2 exergy, which, is directly related to the partial pressures of CO2 at the inlet and exit streams:4,6RTln(p3/p1), where R is the universal gas constant of 8.314 J mol−1 K−1 and temperature T is assumed to be 293.15 K (20 °C). For a given exit/inlet pressure ratio, the ideal cycle work input increases with outgassing overpressure, up to ∼ 50 and 75 kJ molCO2−1 for outgassing overpressures of 100 for inlets of 0.1 bar and 400 ppm CO2(g), respectively. This is expected as a consequence of the fact that higher CO2 super-/undersaturation during the outgassing and invasion processes, respectively, cause increasingly greater exergetic losses; these losses contribute to the difference in average pH, and thus redox potential, of the electrolyte during electrochemical acidification and de-acidification (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 7  Ideal cycle work as a function of the exit/inlet pressure ratio, p3/p1, for various values of the outgassing overpressure, p2/p3, for inlet streams of (a) 0.1 bar CO2 and (b) 400 ppm CO2. Exit/inlet pressure ratios around 2500 are plotted as this is relevant to DAC, where CO2 is separated from 400 ppm to 1 bar. Both measures are compared against the minimum work of separation at each exit/inlet pressure ratio. 
In order to reduce exergetic losses – and thereby reduce the ideal cycle work input – one may consider performing CO2 invasion and outgassing simultaneously with electrochemical acidification and de-acidification, respectively; this way, extremes in solution pH, and potential, are avoided. Exemplary applications of this strategy during electrochemical de-acidification and acidification are presented by the dashed lines in Fig. 5 and 6, where, for the cycle outlined in Fig. 4 (inlet 0.1 bar, exit 1.0 bar), processes 1 → 2 and 2 → 3 are combined into one two-stage acidification process: electrochemical acidification at constant DIC until [CO2(aq)] reaches its equilibrium value at 1 bar CO2(g) of 35 mM, followed by outgassing at constant [CO2(aq)] until [Q] reaches 1.4 M. This results in a decrease in the ideal cycle work input from 50 to 42 kJ molCO2−1. A similar approach can be applied to processes 3 → 4 and 4 → 1, combining them into two-stage electrochemical de-acidification at constant DIC until [CO2(aq)] is 3.5 mM, followed by CO2 invasion at constant [CO2(aq)] until [QH2] reaches 1.4 M. As large exergetic losses during CO2 invasion are avoided, this results in a reduction in the ideal cycle work from 50 kJ molCO2−1 to 14 kJ molCO2−1. Combining both strategies in one two-process cycle that features zero exergetic losses results in an ideal cycle work input of 5.7 kJ molCO2−1, which is equal to the thermodynamic minimum work input. In practice, however, this strategy would come at the cost of lower CO2 separation throughput, as CO2 outgassing/invasion kinetics increase with lower/higher pH values, respectively.39 The use of homogeneous catalysts such as carbonic anhydrase40–42 to speed up CO2 invasion/outgassing kinetics may be one way of making such a cycle practical.
It is worth noting that CO2 separation can, in principle, be run at arbitrarily high exit/inlet pressure ratios, and thus reach higher exit stream CO2 partial pressures than indicated in Fig. 7. However, as already illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†), one would need increasingly higher concentrations of the PCET-active molecule, the solubility of which is constrained in reality (discussed in more detail below). Fig. S4 (ESI†) illustrates such a high-pressure exit stream case, where ideal cycle work is plotted vs. a series of exit/inlet pressure ratios, the highest of which yield CO2 separation from either 0.1 bar or 400 ppm to 150 bar i.e., approaching typical CO2 pipeline pressures. Assuming an upper limit in QH2 solubility of 10 M, our model predicts maximum achievable outgassing overpressures of approximately 3 and 2 for flue gas (Fig. S4a, ESI†) and DAC (Fig. S4b, ESI†), at work inputs of 40 and 70 kJ molCO2−1, respectively.
Several factors dictate the practical feasibility and optimal operation of an electrochemical CO2 separation cycle based on the above scheme. With regard to a chosen redox pair Q/QH2, high chemical stability in aqueous solution and fast redox kinetics are desirable for stable long-term operation and low activation losses. And, especially for CCS schemes in which oxygen composes a large fraction of the inlet gas composition (as in DAC), a high redox potential would be necessary to reduce or even eliminate the thermodynamic susceptibility of QH2 to reversible chemical oxidation by O2, which would cause an efficiency loss and possibly a cell electrolyte imbalance as well.
The most important attribute of Q, however, has to do with the highest pH it can effect upon being reduced during electrochemical de-acidification, as this determines the maximum value of DIC that can be deployed in a full CCS cycle and thus, the maximum CO2 separation throughput per cycle. Higher values of DIC entail higher outgassing overpressures, which will require higher pH values to be achieved after electrochemical de-acidification. A DIC of 2.46 M enables an overpressure of ∼70 given an exit pressure of 1 bar – i.e., 70–2.46 M/0.035 M – but a final pH after de-acidification of 14.5 is required (Fig. 4c). However, a DIC of 0.175 M enables an overpressure of 5 (0.175 M/0.035 M), but requires a final pH upon de-acidification of only 13 (Fig. S2c, ESI†). In the ideal cycle under consideration, the hypothetical redox pair is considered capable of concerted 2H+, 2e− PCET at all pH values, however in real aqueous solutions, PCET would be strongly affected by the affinity of the reduced reactant for protons. A common measure of this proton affinity is the pKa of the protonated form of the reduced reactant, which is calculated based on the equilibrium between its protonated and deprotonated variants. A simplified reaction equation representing this equilibrium is: QH2 ↔ Q2− + 2H+(12)Here, the equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka = [Q2−][H+]2/[QH2]; and the pKa is defined as the logarithmic constant, −log10Ka. As this equilibrium is highly sensitive to solution acidity, increasingly basic solutions will favor the formation of the Q2− rather than QH2, in which case reduction of Q will not result in solution de-acidification as assumed. Based on the pKa values and the water dissociation equilibrium, as well as the conservation of the total concentration of the molecule in all redox states, the ideal relationship between pKa, Q concentration (i.e., concentration of the oxidized form of the molecule) and final pH was derived, and is depicted in Fig. S5 (see ESI† Section: estimation of final pH after electrochemical de-acidification). As expected, the final pH scales strongly with pKa, but is limited at low Q/QH2 solubilities. As an illustration, consider a solution of Q with pKa 15 – at a concentration of 50 mM, it will reach only pH 13 (equivalent to 100 mM OH−) upon bulk electrolytic reduction, but will achieve a pH of 14.7 for a Q concentration of 4.0 M. Finding redox-active species with a combination of high solubility and high pKa is therefore critical for reaching high DIC values in the electrochemical cycle, and thereby enabling high-throughput CO2 separation.
Although DIC values greater than 3 M can, in principle, be attained in aqueous solution (room-temperature solubilities of NaHCO3, Na2CO3, KHCO3 and K2CO3 in water are 1.14, 3.2, 3.3 and 8.1 M, respectively43,44), solubilities of molecules capable of undergoing PCET across a wide pH range are typically lower, and thus limit DIC values that can be utilized in an electrochemical CCS cycle. Molecules with high reduction potential, high value of pKa, high solubility and high chemical and electrochemical stability are necessary for practical electrochemical CCS devices.
Besides the choice of molecules, another critical question bearing on the practical implementation of this scheme relates to the nature of the electrochemical cell, and how it is integrated with CO2 capture and release. Maximizing the overall energy efficiency of the system would require minimizing charge transport losses by using thin membranes with high perm-selectivity, minimizing activation losses by using catalytically active high-surface-area electrodes and redox-active species with fast kinetics, and minimizing mass transport/fluid pumping losses by using carefully engineered electrode pore structures45,46 and flow fields.47–51 In Fig. 1 it is assumed that these processes occur in steady-state: the electrolyte flows between an air contactor38,52 at the inlet, where CO2 absorption occurs at high pH; an electrochemical cell where acidification/deacidification take place; and the exit, where CO2 is released at low pH. In order to maintain this pH differential across the cell membrane, it would be critical to have an ion-selective membrane that would strongly suppress the permeation of any ions that affect the solution TA (i.e., ions on the right hand side of eqn (9)). A combination of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM) may be necessary to maintain a steady-state pH differential over a long period of time (Fig. S7, ESI†), as demonstrated for electrochemical water desalination by Desai et al.53 In the next section, we demonstrate an electrochemical CCS flow cell using a DSPZ electrolyte. An inexpensive sulfonated hydrocarbon based CEM Fumatech E-620(K) was used as the membrane.
Experiment
We designed DSPZ to serve as the proton carrier because of its facile synthesis, high stability and quasi-reversible redox activity in a wide range of pH. DSPZ was synthesized through two simple steps using inexpensive materials and solvents with an overall yield of 67% as shown in Fig. 8a. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of DSPZ is in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The solubility values of DSPZ in 1 M KCl (pH = 5.9) and 1 M KOH (pH = 14) were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy, and the values were both 0.73 M. (Fig. S8, ESI†).
 Fig. 8  Synthesis and electrochemical properties of DSPZ. (a) Synthetic scheme of DSPZ. (b) CV of 5 mM DSPZ at pH 3, 9 and 14 buffered 1 M KCl solutions. We attribute the small peaks near −0.2 V and −0.05 V vs. SHE in the pH 3 and 14 voltammograms, respectively, to a small amount of impurities. (c) Five cycles of galvanostatic deacidification and acidification at 50 mA cm−2 of the flow cell that comprised 7 mL 0.1 M DSPZ in 1 M KCl as negolytes (negative electrolyte) and 25 mL 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 0.04 M K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl as posolyte (positive electrolyte). Potentiostatic holds at 1.65 V and 0.2 V were applied at the end of deacidification and acidification, respectively, to ensure high capacity utilization. (d) Reversible pH swings during the five cycles in (c). 

Fig. 8b shows that DSPZ undergoes quasi-reversible electrochemistry at pH 3, 9 and 14, and the reduction potentials at these pH values are 0.05, −0.18 and −0.61 V vs. SHE, respectively. These results suggest a fitted slope of −59.5 mV pH−1, indicating 2H+, 2e− process throughout most of the pH range from 3 to 14. Its high solubility and wide functional pH range for PCET means that DSPZ satisfies our need for electrochemical CO2 capture and release using a pH swing cycle.
To fully understand the pH evolution during deacidification and acidification, we constructed a flow cell capacity-limited by a negolyte of volume 7 mL with 0.1 M DSPZ. Both negolyte and posolyte were purged with and blanketed by nitrogen before and throughout the experiments, respectively, to avoid oxidation of reduced DSPZ by atmospheric oxygen. A schematic of the flow cell is shown in Fig. 9. We performed galvanostatic deacidification/acidification at 50 mA cm−2, with potential holds at 1.65 V and 0.2 V at the end of each deacidification or acidification half cycle until current dropped to 10 mA cm−2 in order to utilize the full capacity (Fig. 8c). The pH of the DSPZ negolyte was simultaneously recorded during deacidification/acidification cycles using a pH probe immersed in the negolyte solution (Fig. 8d).27,28 In order to understand the electrochemistry of DSPZ in slightly acidic conditions, the initial pH was adjusted to 4.0 by adding a small amount of HCl solution. In the first full cycle, the pH increased from 4.0 to 13.4 during deacidification and returned from pH 13.4 to 7.5 during acidification, and the pH continued to cycle reversibly over the remaining four cycles. These results show that the electrochemical reactions of 0.1 M of DSPZ can swing the pH to >13 as predicted by Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the molecules can be cycled over a wide pH range of 4.0 to 13.4. The slight increase in pH over time at the end of acidification was likely caused by residual oxygen in our system, as evident by the <100% coulombic efficiency of the first cycle.27 The close to 100% capacity utilization and the degree of pH change once again confirmed the 2H+/2e− redox process of DSPZ, which makes it a suitable proton carrier for electrochemical CO2 capture/release using a pH swing cycle.

To further explore the possibility of using DSPZ flow cell for CO2 capture/release and compare to the ideal cycle shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), we performed cycling of DSPZ in a steady mixed N2/CO2 environment with CO2 partial pressure of 0.465 bar. The scheme of the setup is shown in Fig. 9. The inlet CO2 and N2 flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers connected to each gas cylinder, and the two gases were mixed before entering the electrolyte chamber. At the gas outlet, the total gas flow rate and CO2 partial pressure were measured using a digital flowmeter and a CO2 sensor, respectively. The product of CO2 partial pressure and the total flow rate gives the CO2 flow rate.

Fig. 10 presents time series data over a full CO2 capture and release cycle. The cell voltage profile, current density and pH were collected by the potentiostat while the CO2 partial pressure and the total gas flow rate were simultaneously recorded by the CO2 sensor and the flowmeter at the gas outlet. The initial CO2 partial pressure was set to be 0.465 bar and the gas flow rate was set to be 10 mL min−1 (Fig. 10f). In this cycle, deacidification at 50 mA cm−2 started ∼20 minutes after the start of the experiment (Fig. 10b). Both the cell voltage (Fig. 10a), and negolyte pH (Fig. 10d) increased due to the PCET reaction. We also estimated the increase in negolyte TA during deacidification assuming only K+ ions crossed the CEM (Fig. 10c). When the cell voltage reached 1.65 V, the cell was turned to potentiostatic mode in order to continue deacidifying the electrolyte until the current dropped to 10 mA cm−2, to enhance capacity utilization. A capacity utilization of 97.9% was achieved with this method. CO2 absorption occurred simultaneously with deacidification, signified by a drop in outlet CO2 partial pressure (Fig. 10e) and a pH drop as CO2 reacts with OH− to form CO32−/HCO3−. The absorption period lasted ∼40 minutes beyond the end of charging process, presumably due to sluggish CO2 absorption kinetics at low pH; it ended 80 minutes after the start of the experiment, as indicated by the recovered CO2 partial pressure at 0.465 bar and a steady pH value. The volume of absorbed CO2 was obtained by integrating over time the product of CO2 partial pressure, which can be translated to CO2 percentage assuming 1 bar of total pressure, and the total gas flow rate, and subtracting the integration of the product of baseline CO2 partial pressure and the total gas flow rate, i.e. (13)where QCO2 is the amount of CO2 absorbed, ti is the start time, tf is the final time, pCObase2 is the baseline CO2 partial pressure, pCOn2 is the measured CO2 partial pressure (in bar) at the nth data recording time tn, n is the total gas flow rate at time tn and Δt is the time difference between successive measurements. The absorbed volume of CO2 was calculated to be 26.6 mL or, assuming T = 293.15 K, P = 1 bar and ideal gas behavior resulting in a DIC increase during CO2 invasion of 0.158 M (1.11 mmol CO2 in 7 mL solution). Adding this ΔDIC to the existing DIC (0.073 M) before the deacidification, which can be calculated using the pH and pCO2 before deacidification, the total DIC is 0.231 M at the end of the deacidification process. The measurement implies that the TA concentration at the end of CO2 invasion is 0.216 M. During the deacidification process, each DSPZ molecule gains two electrons and two protons, and, under ideal conditions, two potassium ions will cross over from the posolyte to balance the charge, resulting a net increase in [S+] that is twice the DSPZ concentration (eqn (10)). The total DSPZ concentration is 0.078 M, so the expected ΔTA value is 0.156 M, resulting in a final expected TA of 0.213 M (after adding existing TA of 0.057 M) at the end of the deacidification process. The measured TA of 0.216 M is within 2% of the expected value for a TA of 0.213 M, suggesting that crossover of non-conservative ions (H+, OH− and non-CO2 DIC) is negligible during deacidification/capture. The steady-state pH at the end of the absorption period was 7.0 (Fig. 10d), which is similar to the predicted value of 7.1 for 0.465 bar at TA of 0.213 M, considering the ±0.25 error bar of the pH probe. The similarity between theory and experimental results is reassuring. Acidification began after the completion of the absorption period around 83 minutes after the start of the experiment. The pH first dropped to 6.1 because of PCET releasing protons into solution and then increased to 6.5 because of DIC turning into gaseous CO2. pH, CO2 partial pressure and flow rate measurements all show that the previously absorbed ΔDIC turned completely to gaseous CO2 ∼40 minutes after the start of acidification (Fig. 10d–f). The desorbed CO2 amount, calculated using the negative of the right-hand side of eqn (13), was 26.3 mL, which is within 2% of the absorbed amount. The net electrical work of the full cycle is calculated by subtracting the work returned during acidification from the work input during deacidification, i.e. wcycle = wdeacidification − wacidification(14)where wdeacidification/acidification can be calculated by: (15)where Vn is the cell voltage at the nth data recording time tn, jn is the current density at time tn and A is the active geometric area of 5 cm2. We take the absolute value, recognizing the direction of the work interactions through the minus sign in eqn (14). Work returned during acidification can be calculated similarly. In this cycle, wdeacidification is 0.14 kJ and wacidification 0.063 kJ, so the cycle work is 0.08 kJ. Considering 1.11 mmol absorbed/desorbed CO2, the total work per mole is 72.1 kJ molCO2−1. This energy is high because the ohmic, electron transfer and mass transport overpotentials are high at this current density of 50 mA cm−2.54

Electrolytes comprised 7 mL 0.078 M DSPZ in 1 M KCl (negolyte, capacity limiting side, theoretical capacity = 105.4 C) and 40 mL of 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl (posolyte, non-capacity limiting side) (a) Voltage profile. (b) Current density. (c) Estimated total alkalinity. (d) pH. (e) CO2 partial pressure. The black dashed line indicates the 0.465 bar baseline. (f) Total gas flow rate. 
In order to understand how the CO2 capture capacity and net electrical work depend on current density, we performed the same experiment at different current densities. Fig. 11 shows five cycles each, at current densities of 40, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 mA cm−2, performed using the same cell and electrolyte compositions as for the one-cycle experiment reported in Fig. 10. Across different current densities, the amount of absorbed/desorbed CO2 remained the same, at an average value of 26.7 mL or, with the same assumptions as above, 0.159 M ΔDIC (1.11 mmol CO2, Fig. 12a). The same amount of absorbed CO2 is reasonable because the cell capacity and estimated TA after deacidification remained the same, regardless of current density, and a potentiostatic hold was applied at the end of each half cycle in order for the measured capacity to approach the theoretical value. The energy consumption, however, is a different story because ohmic, electron transfer and mass transport overpotentials increase monotonically with increasing current density. Fig. 12b reports the dependence upon current density of the electrical work consumed and returned by the system; their difference is the net electrical work wcycle. For the cycles under 0.465 bar CO2, a linear extrapolation to 0 mA cm−2, where ohmic and mass-transport overpotentials are expected to be negligible, suggests that the minimum electrical work input would be 47.0 kJ molCO2−1. Five cycles at each current density were also performed using the same cell with N2 but no CO2 in the headspace, and the resulting intercept shows that the minimum electrical work input is 32.0 kJ molCO2−1.

Fig. S9 (ESI†) demonstrates a CO2 capture/release cycle in which CO2 is concentrated from an inlet of 0.465 bar CO2(g) to an exit of 1 bar using a flow cell with 0.09 M DSPZ negolyte. Because of transient changes in pCO2 and gas flow rate, uncertainties accumulate in calculating the amount of CO2 absorbed/released based on eqn (13). Instead, we estimated DIC values based on pH values, TA and eqn (5)–(10). At 40 mA cm−2, the work input associated with this CO2 separation cycle is between 79.3 and 84.2 kJ molCO2−1 (see ESI† Section: CO2 capture from 0.465 bar and release to 1 bar).
Discussion
We interpret the value 47.0 kJ molCO2−1 (Fig. 12b) as being caused by electrode kinetic losses and exergetic losses that do not disappear when extrapolated to zero current density. The former may mainly comprise activation overpotentials for electrochemical processes that often cause nonlinear behavior at low current density, e.g., in fuel cells.55 In our case, the work input associated with activation overpotentials is equivalent to the minimum electrical work input for cycling under N2 demonstrated in Fig. 12b, i.e., 32.0 kJ molCO2−1 because the same cell build and electrolyte composition were used. This value is twice the amount of our estimate of 15.7 kJ molCO2−1, calculated from the reported kinetic constants and transfer coefficients for a similar phenazine and ferrocyanide. (see ESI† Section: estimate of activation overpotential). We interpret the 15 kJ molCO2−1 gap between the measured minimum electrical work input in 0.465 bar CO2 of 47.0 kJ molCO2−1 and that in N2 of 32.0 kJ molCO2−1 as comprising exergetic losses caused by finite CO2 absorption/desorption kinetics. Due to the behavior observed in Fig. 11a, b, d and 12a, we do not believe these exergetic losses varied significantly within the range of current densities accessed in our experiments. The next paragraph discusses the exergetic losses in detail. We expect an additional thermodynamic energy cost of 1.9 kJ molCO2−1 when a 0.465 bar/1.0 bar inlet/outlet pressure ratio exists. Therefore, when a 0.465 bar CO2 source is concentrated to 1 bar using this cycle, the estimated experimental cycle work would be 48.9 kJ molCO2−1. This value may be compared with the ideal cycle work predicted by our thermodynamic analysis of the four-process cycle, i.e., 34 kJ molCO2−1 for absorption from 0.465 bar and release to 1.0 bar (see ESI† Section: estimate of CO2 kinetics losses).
The above calculation yielding 34 kJ molCO2−1, however, assumes a four-process CO2 separation cycle, whereas the experimental situation is arguably closer to the two-process cycle, in which CO2 release/invasion and acidification/de-acidification occur simultaneously. The two-process ideal cycle work would be the same as the thermodynamic minimum work, i.e., 0 kJ molCO2−1 for the case of capturing from and releasing to the same environment, and 1.9 kJ molCO2−1 for capturing from 0.465 bar and releasing to 1 bar. It does not include exergetic losses that occur during an actual experimental cycle. We may estimate the minimum electrochemical work input for given, finite CO2 capture/release kinetics, as the sum of the thermodynamic minimum work and the exergetic losses during the two thermodynamically irreversible processes of CO2 release and invasion in the experimental cycle, which we call the CO2 kinetic losses. We estimated those exergetic losses based on the average partial pressures of CO2 in the cell headspace during CO2 release and invasion in Fig. 11d (see ESI† Section: estimate of CO2 kinetics losses), and obtained a value of 10.3 kJ molCO2−1. The gap between the estimated 10.3 kJ molCO2−1 and the measured 15 kJ molCO2−1 may be caused by uncertainties in the CO2 kinetic loss calculation described in the ESI† (see ESI† Section: estimate of CO2 kinetics losses) or other irreversible processes not captured by the calculation.
The predicted ideal cycle work for CO2 separation in the four-process cycle (16–75 kJ molCO2−1) and the experiment-based electrical work estimate (48.9 kJ molCO2−1) appear competitive with other proposed methods (Table 1), particularly those in which alkaline solution is created by splitting or dissociating water.56–61 As water splitting requires work input, theoretical minimum electrical energy inputs for CO2 separation using these methods range between 119 and 237 kJ molCO2−1 (depending on pH at absorption). Because water splitting is also kinetically demanding, requiring catalysts based on precious metals such as Pt and Ru, electrical work requirements for experimentally demonstrated absorptive CO2 capture using OH− obtained by reactions following from water splitting are as high as 587 kJ molCO2−1.60 Dissociating H2O into H+ and OH− and using the latter for absorptive CO2 capture has a lower minimum electrical energy cost, but experimentally demonstrated work inputs have been fairly high, with 405 and 300 kJ molCO2−1 reported in the literature.56,61 Much lower work inputs have been reported with capture schemes in which redox reactions involving an organic62–64 or inorganic65 redox couple trigger capture and release of CO2. The lowest such work inputs for complete electrochemical CO2 capture-release cycles are 56 kJ molCO2−1 and 100 kJ molCO2−1 for capturing CO2via direct binding to a reduced quinone64 or an electrochemically regenerated amine,65 respectively. In the former type of cycle, CO2 is absorbed by direct binding to a reduced quinone, followed by its release upon electrochemical oxidation; in the latter cycle, termed electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (EMAR), CO2 binds to an amine, and is displaced upon oxidation of copper, as Cu2+ binds more strongly to the amine than does CO2. In implementations of both cycles,64,65 however, CO2 release occurred to a partial pressure of ∼0 bar CO2, which precludes direct comparison of the measured work input to a positive ideal cycle/thermodynamic minimum work input. Nevertheless, the lowest work input we obtain is 60 kJ molCO2−1 at 40 mA cm−2 (Fig. 12), which is competitive with direct binding and EMAR.64,65

a This technique captures CO2 into an end state that is not pure gaseous CO2. As it is based on the operation of an H2–O2 fuel cell, the theoretical energy input is that required to split water, which is 119 kJ molH2O−1 and thus 119 kJ molCO2−1 where CO2 is captured as HCO3−, but 237 kJ molCO2−1 where CO2 is captured as CO32−. We do not consider HCO3− as a viable end state for capture; however it may be converted to solid carbonates in a process such as the Calera process.68

Xie et al., have demonstrated a CO2 capture/release system using DHPS as the driver for PCET in a symmetric flow cell.69 We refer to the oxidized form of DHPS as DHPS and the reduced form as r-DHPS. In their experiments, the catholyte and the anolyte comprised ≥50 mL 25 mM DHPS and r-DHPS, respectively, with saturated NaHCO3 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. The feed gas in the catholyte compartment, where CO2 absorption took place, was 15% CO2 and 85% N2, mimicking flue gas conditions while preventing oxidation of reduced DHPS by oxygen, and the anolyte compartment, where CO2 was released, was filled with pure nitrogen or argon. In this setup, during the electrolysis (reducing DHPS in catholyte, oxidizing r-DHPS in anolyte), while CO2 from the external gas source was captured by the catholyte, CO2 from the NaHCO3 was released from the anolyte. The authors reported 74 mL of CO2 emitted from the anolyte at an energy cost of 0.492 GJ per ton (21.7 kJ molCO2−1) at 10 mA cm−2. This value is quite close to our estimated minimum energy cost for CO2 separation from 0.1 to 1 bar but several factors make this comparison inappropriate. One key point is that the released CO2 was not from the captured CO2 − a quantity that was not reported − but from previously dissolved NaHCO3. Therefore, instead of showing the energy cost of a full CO2 capture/release cycle, the energy cost presented reflected only the cost of driving 74 mL of CO2 at 1 bar and 25 °C out of a 50 mL saturated (≥0.2 M) NaHCO3 solution (estimated to yield ≥245 mL CO2 at 1 bar when fully converted). In a similar study done by the same group, the authors demonstrated a full CO2 capture/release cycle using riboflavin derivatives at 333 K.70 The authors reported a low energy cost of 9.8 kJ molCO2−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 but we cannot compare this number to a positive minimum work because the captured CO2 was released at 0 bar CO2 and their system is limited to low concentrations because of riboflavin precipitation.70
Watkins et al.,66 demonstrated CO2 separation from flue gas using a pH gradient created by Pt-catalyzed PCET reactions using benzoquinone and 2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone; however, the kinetic sluggishness of the associated redox reactions and the absence of an ion-selective membrane in their design result in a practical work input of 600 kJ molCO2−1. In contrast, the experimental cycle in our work utilized an ion-selective membrane, which allows the use of any redox-active species within a wide array of reactants capable of PCET. In the organic RFB literature, several organic molecules have been shown to have kinetic rate constants on the order of 10−3 cm s−1 or above on inexpensive carbon electrodes,22,23,28,30,54,69,71–74 demonstrating the wide availability of reactants for CO2 separation that will impose minimal energetic losses in an electrochemical cell.
It is worth noting that PCET-active species compatible with this CO2 separation cycle do not have to be organic. Polyoxometalates, for instance, have attracted interest as highly soluble candidates for reactants in RFBs75,76 and redox mediators for water splitting/reduction.76,77 Although they tend to be insoluble and redox-inactive in basic solution,78 they are, in principle, capable of greater than 2H+, 2e− PCET. Chen et al.,76 have demonstrated that a tungsten-based polyoxoanion can stably undergo an 18H+, 18 e− redox process at a concentration of 0.5 M, with the potential to go up to 2.0 M, although its behavior in basic solution was not reported. The development of a similar reactant capable of PCET across the pH range 3–13 would effect a much larger pH swing per mole of reactant than assumed herein, thus lowering the required reactant solubility. Indeed, continued exploration of the large parameter space to which inorganic and organic redox-active species belong may yield candidates for electrochemical CO2 separation that boast higher redox potential, solubility and pKa than those assumed here, and applying insights from the fields of electrocatalysis and energy storage may prove beneficial toward that goal.
In addition to minimal energetic losses, another important criterion for wide scale adoption of CO2 separation technology is the use of low-cost cell components and working fluids. The process described here can, as shown in the experiments we performed, use water-soluble molecules and aqueous electrolytes. This is in contrast to most of the electrochemical CO2 separation methods that do not feature the use of a pH swing which have been described in the literature, involving direct binding of CO2 to reduced quinones62,63,79 and oxygen-assisted conversion of CO2 to oxalate species80 – all of which require more expensive organic solvents or ionic liquids to operate.

DSPZ meets many requirements for an ideal molecule, including high pKa, reasonable stability, moderate solubility and fast kinetics, but not all. DSPZ's oxygen intolerance limits its application to DAC. The development of a molecule with reduction potential close to that of oxygen, as well as high solubility (>1 M) and chemical stability would make our pH swing cycle practically compatible with DAC, and we hope to stimulate the research community with this challenge.
Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed and performed a thermodynamic analysis of the energetic costs of CO2 separation from flue gas (0.1 bar CO2(g)) and air (400 ppm CO2) using a pH swing created by redox reactions involving PCET. In this scheme, bulk electrolytic reduction results in the formation of alkaline solution, into which CO2 can be absorbed, whereas oxidation of the resulting solution results in the acidification of the solution, triggering the release of pure CO2 gas. We examined the effect of buffering from the CO2–carbonate system on the solution pH during this pH swing, and thereby on the open-circuit potential of a hypothetical electrochemical cell in a four-process CO2 capture-release cycle. The thermodynamic minimum work input varies from 16 to 75 kJ molCO2−1 as throughput increases, for both flue gas and DAC, with the potential to go substantially lower if CO2 capture or release is performed in tandem with electrolytic reduction or oxidation. The lower limit of these values is competitive at a theoretical level with the best electrochemical CO2 separation method we are aware of, and may result in a practical energetic cost (assuming a heat-to-work conversion efficiency of 1/3) on par with more established absorptive capture methods such as those using concentrated KOH. Additionally, its all-liquid configuration obviates the need for the precipitation and heating of solid carbonates, and compatibility with an aqueous electrolyte and potentially low-cost organic molecules implies that a CCS technology based on this concept has the potential for wide scale practical implementation. We corroborate the scheme by demonstrating CO2 separation experiments using a DSPZ-based flow cell. We demonstrated one CO2 concentrating cycle at 40 mA cm−2 and obtained a total cycle work of 79.4–84.2 kJ molCO2−1. In the low-current-density limit, we obtain an estimated total cycle work of 48.9 kJ molCO2−1 for absorbing CO2 from a 0.465 bar CO2 source and releasing to a 1.0 bar CO2 stream. The experimental cycle work in the low-current-density limit is comparable to the value of 34 kJ molCO2−1 for CO2 separation predicted by our thermodynamic analysis for these conditions. This relatively small difference, compared to other methods summarized in Table 1, is encouraging. To best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated stable, reversible, multi-cycle electrochemical CCS device utilizing a flow cell framework. These promising results shed light on future low energy electrochemical CCS devices using our proposed scheme.

Broader context
CO2 emission primarily from fossil fuel combustion is causing climate change at an alarming rate. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has attracted R&D investment due to its potential to remove CO2 from combustion exhaust. Although pilot-scale amine-based CCS at fossil-fired power plants has been demonstrated, the required heat input and the associated amine degradation and evaporative losses at elevated temperature may hinder its wide application. Here we present an electrochemically driven CO2 separation approach that relies on a solution pH swing driven by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) of small molecules, and requires electrical but no thermal input. Electrochemical reduction of these molecules de-acidifies an aqueous solution, which then absorbs CO2; subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the reduced molecules acidifies the solution, triggering the release of pure CO2 gas. Our analysis suggests the minimum electrical work input of this approach is 16–75 kJ molCO2−1, depending on the throughput, for both CO2 separation from air and a typical flue gas with 0.1 bar CO2. We demonstrate this approach experimentally using a flow cell with an aqueous-soluble phenazine-based electrolyte that undergoes PCET. The resulting energy cost of 47 kJ molCO2−1 in the low-current-density limit is compared to other methods.

Both measures are compared against the minimum work of separation at each exit/inlet pressure ratio.

 	Fig. 8  Synthesis and electrochemical properties of DSPZ. (a) Synthetic scheme of DSPZ. (b) CV of 5 mM DSPZ at pH 3, 9 and 14 buffered 1 M KCl solutions. We attribute the small peaks near −0.2 V and −0.05 V vs. SHE in the pH 3 and 14 voltammograms, respectively, to a small amount of impurities. (c) Five cycles of galvanostatic deacidification and acidification at 50 mA cm−2 of the flow cell that comprised 7 mL 0.1 M DSPZ in 1 M KCl as negolytes (negative electrolyte) and 25 mL 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 0.04 M K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl as posolyte (positive electrolyte). Potentiostatic holds at 1.65 V and 0.2 V were applied at the end of deacidification and acidification, respectively, to ensure high capacity utilization. (d) Reversible pH swings during the five cycles in (c).

 	Fig. 10  One full CO2 capture and release cycle with DSPZ based flow cell. Electrolytes comprised 7 mL 0.078 M DSPZ in 1 M KCl (negolyte, capacity limiting side, theoretical capacity = 105.4 C) and 40 mL of 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl (posolyte, non-capacity limiting side) (a) Voltage profile. (b) Current density. (c) Estimated total alkalinity. (d) pH. (e) CO2 partial pressure. The black dashed line indicates the 0.465 bar baseline. (f) Total gas flow rate.	 

 	Fig. 11  Thirty full CO2 capture and release cycles with a DSPZ-based flow cell at 40 to 150 mA cm−2. Electrolytes comprised 7 mL 0.078 M DSPZ in 1 M KCl (negolyte, capacity limiting side, theoretical capacity = 105.4 C) and 40 mL of 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl (posolyte, non-capacity limiting side) (a) Voltage profile. (b) Current density. (c) pH. (d) CO2 partial pressure. The black dashed line indicates the 0.465 bar baseline. (e) Total gas flow rate.	 

 	Fig. 12  (a) Average of CO2 captured and released at different current densities. (b) Gross electrical work consumed by device (wdeacidification) during de-acidification, work returned (wacidification) during acidification, and net work (wcycle) per mole of CO2vs. current density. The work components of cycling under CO2 and N2 are compared.
