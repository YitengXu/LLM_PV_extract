Organometal halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have recently attracted much attention as light-harvesting materials for solar cells,1–5 owing to their appropriate direct bandgap, large absorption coefficient,6,7 long carrier lifetime and high carrier mobility.8,9 The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has been rapidly boosted from 3.8% to 20.1%.1,10 In the last two years, organometal halide perovskites have also shown attractive application prospects in photodetectors,11,12 light emitting diodes,13–15 and lasers.16,17 Generally this class of compounds very easily absorbs polar gases and vapor, which is considered to be a critical factor detrimentally affecting the long-term stabilities of perovskite devices.18 Interestingly, however, one can take advantage of this feature of these materials to extend their applications as gas sensors. Zhu's group found that the color of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)/TiO2 film changed from brown to colorless immediately (<1 s) when exposed to an NH3 atmosphere, and turned back to the original color within seconds after being removed from the NH3 atmosphere, suggesting its application as an NH3 sensor. However, they also found that the perovskite MAPbI3/TiO2 film exposed to NH3 for a long period of time (tens of minutes) could not turn back to its brown color when the NH3 atmosphere was removed.19 The poor stability and repeatability will seriously hinder the application of perovskites as optical-based NH3 sensors.
In this work, we investigated the resistance change of perovskite MAPbI3 film induced by NH3. We found that the resistance of the perovskite MAPbI3 film was obviously reduced within seconds when the film was exposed to the NH3 atmosphere and the film could return to the high resistance state within seconds after the NH3 atmosphere was removed. Our study indicated that a new phase has been produced after the perovskite MAPbI3 reacts with NH3, and the resistance of the new phase showed a similar sensitive response to NH3 as perovskite MAPbI3. These phenomena inspire the new application of perovskites as electrical-based NH3 sensors with higher stability than optical-based NH3 sensors. Besides, the insight into the interaction of MAPbI3 with the surrounding environment in our study could also inspire work to improve the long-term stability of devices based on this class of perovskite materials.
MAPbI3 film was fabricated by a one-step spin-coating method according to the work reported elsewhere previously.20 Briefly, FTO glass was patterned by laser cutting and cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water, respectively. Then the pre-cleaned FTO electrode was spin-coated with the MAPbI3 precursor solution (40 wt%, in N,N-dimethylformamide) at a rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the as-prepared perovskite films was about 1 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). The resistance change of the MAPbI3 film induced by NH3 was measured in a Teflon chamber (50 mL) at room temperature (RT, around 25 °C). During the test, dry pure NH3 (1 L min−1) and N2 (2 L min−1) were injected into the chamber. The schematic diagram of the perovskite MAPbI3 electrode structure and the test system is shown in Fig. 1(a).

(c) I–t curve of the MAPbI3 film with the NH3 switching ON and OFF at RT. The applied bias voltage is 1.5 V. (d) An enlarged view of the dashed line rectangle area in the I–t curve, which shows the current rise and decay when the NH3 is switched ON and OFF. 

Fig. 1(b) gives the I–V curves of the MAPbI3 electrode exposed to the atmosphere of N2 (NH3 OFF) and the mixed atmosphere of NH3 and N2 (NH3 ON). We can see that, within the test bias voltage (−3 V to 3 V), the current through the MAPbI3 film under NH3 OFF was obviously smaller than that under NH3 ON. This indicates that the resistance of the MAPbI3 film can be greatly decreased when the film is exposed to the NH3 atmosphere. The sheet resistance of the films was also measured by the four probe method before and after being exposed to the NH3 atmosphere. The results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which confirmed the resistance change of the film reduced by NH3.

Fig. 1(c) shows the I–t curve of the MAPbI3 film with the NH3 flow switched ON and OFF. The current was tested under the bias voltage of 1.5 V. From the I–t curve we can see that the current through the film under NH3 ON was obviously greater than that under NH3 OFF. At the beginning stage (before ∼200 s) of the test, the measured currents under NH3 ON and NH3 OFF both decreased obviously. In order to explain this phenomenon, we speculate that there are two kinds of processes occurring when MAPbI3 reacts with NH3: one is reversible, such as adsorption or intercalation; and the other is an irreversible process. Reversible reaction is the reason why the resistance of the film can repeatedly respond to the switch of NH3: when the film is exposed to the NH3 atmosphere, the NH3 molecules will be adsorbed by the film or inserted in the space of the crystal lattice, and the film shows relatively low resistance; when the NH3 atmosphere is removed, the NH3 molecules adsorbed or inserted in the film will be quickly released, and the film returns to the relatively high resistance state. Meanwhile, NH3 can also irreversibly transform perovskite MAPbI3 into a new phase or compound (signed as MAPbI3 + NH3). In the same environment (NH3 ON or OFF), the resistance of the MAPbI3 + NH3 film is higher than the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film, so at the beginning stage of the test, the measured currents when NH3 is ON and OFF decrease obviously. At the last stage (after ∼200 s) of the test, when the perovskite MAPbI3 film is completely transformed into MAPbI3 + NH3, both of the currents when the NH3 is ON and OFF become relatively stable.
Both the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film and the newly generated MAPbI3 + NH3 film show a quick response to NH3. Fig. 1(d) shows that when NH3 is switched from OFF to ON, the current increases from below 10 nA to the saturation current (∼110 nA) in about 3.0 s. When the NH3 is OFF, the current can recover to below 10 nA in about 4.5 s. This is a very short response time for NH3 sensors, especially for sensors working at RT.21,22 These results inspire the potential application in fast response NH3 sensors of the MAPbI3 film. It is worth noting that this sensor is based on the change in electrical properties, which is of more practical significance than that based on the change in optical properties, because electrical properties are much easier to be detected than optical properties.
The above proposed processes occurring when the MAPbI3 film was exposed to NH3 were also reflected in the color change of the film induced by NH3. Previous work showed that the color of the MAPbI3/TiO2 film changed reversibly when exposed to NH3, and the reversibility was destroyed when the exposure time increased to tens of minutes.19 We found that, for the NH3 induced color change of the pure MAPbI3 films, the reversibility was completely destroyed in a shorter exposure time (<50 s). Fig. 2 shows the optical characterization of the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film and the recovered film after being exposed to NH3 for 5 s and 50 s. The right frame shows the digital photographs, and the left frame shows the transmittance spectra. The pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film displays a brown color. The transmittance spectrum shows that the perovskite MAPbI3 film maintains low transmittance below 755 nm and increases sharply at 755 nm, which agree with the band gap of perovskite MAPbI3. When exposed to the NH3 atmosphere for about 5 s, the color of the film could not be completely restored to the original brown but changed to light brown after the NH3 atmosphere was removed. It can be seen that, compared to that of the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film, the transmittance of the film after being exposed to NH3 for 5 s increased across the entire visible region. In addition to 755 nm, an absorption edge at around 500 nm appeared, indicating that a new phase appeared after the film was exposed to NH3 for 5 s. When exposed to NH3 for a longer period of time (about 50 s) the film retained the light yellow color after the NH3 atmosphere was removed. The film showed a single absorption edge at around 500 nm and homogeneous high transmittance at the longer wavelength region, suggesting that the perovskite MAPbI3 has been transformed into the new phase absolutely. Though the color change in one sample caused by the irreversible reaction of perovskite MAPbI3 and NH3 is unrepeatable, the resistance change is repeatable because the new product generated from the irreversible reaction also shows similar NH3 induced resistance change character to perovskite MAPbI3. Therefore, this electrical-based NH3 sensor shows better repeatability and stability compared to the optical-based one.

To further understand the phase transformation and the morphology change induced by NH3 on the perovskite MAPbI3 film, we carried out X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and morphology characterization on the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film and that after being exposed to the NH3 atmosphere for different periods of time. The results are exhibited in Fig. 3. The XRD pattern and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the pristine perovskite film are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The XRD pattern indicates that MAPbI3 has a tetragonal perovskite structure (peaks marked with squares). The diffraction peaks at about 14.02 19.94, 28.42, 31.78, 40.48 and 43.04 degrees correspond to the reflections from (110), (112), (220), (310), (224) and (314) crystal planes respectively. No PbI2 and impurity peaks other than the ones attributed to FTO (marked with circles) are observed. The SEM image in Fig. 3(b) shows that the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film is rough and continuous, which shows the same morphology as reported previously.20 After being exposed to the NH3 atmosphere, a new phase appears in the perovskite MAPbI3 film. The XRD pattern in Fig. 3(c) shows that, after being exposed to NH3 for 5 s, intensities of all the diffraction peaks belonging to the tetragonal perovskite structure are reduced and new diffraction peaks (marked with triangles) belonging to a new phase (MAPbI3 + NH3) appear. Meanwhile, the morphology of the film was reconstructed and the coverage and smoothness were increased (Fig. 3(d)), which was similar to the phenomenon when fumigated in DMF vapor as we reported previously.23 The reconstruction of the film may result from the difference in the crystal structure before and after the reaction with NH3. After being exposed to NH3 for a longer period of time (about 50 s), the film transformed into the new phase completely (Fig. 3(e)). And the morphology of the film changed obviously: the roughness increased and the coverage decreased greatly (Fig. 3(f)). The discontinuity of the film may be an important reason for the greater resistance of the MAPbI3 + NH3 film compared to the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 film.

In addition to NH3, we have also studied the resistance change of perovskite MAPbI3 film induced by moisture. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the I–V curves and I–t curve of the perovskite MAPbI3 film in dry N2 and air with a relative humidity (RH) of about 50% at RT. The results indicate that a similar resistance change effect can also be induced by moisture in perovskite MAPbI3.
In conclusion, we have investigated the resistance change of the perovskite MAPbI3 film induced by NH3. It was found that when the perovskite MAPbI3 film was exposed to NH3 the current through the film was greatly improved within seconds. When the NH3 environment was removed, the current was decreased to the original value within seconds. XRD patterns and SEM images showed that when exposed to NH3 perovskite MAPbI3 gradually transformed into a new phase and the morphology of the film changed significantly. The resistance of this new material was as sensitive to NH3 as that of perovskite MAPbI3. The results of this study imply that MAPbI3 could potentially be used as a room-temperature-working NH3 sensor with fast response time. Meanwhile, understanding how perovskite MAPbI3 interacts with the surrounding environment is of great significance to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells.
