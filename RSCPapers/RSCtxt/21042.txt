    , Accepted 4th February 2013First published on 5th February 2013AbstractA novel approach was developed to achieve three-dimensional macroporous NiO/Ni powders. The unique architecture, together with the highly distributed Ni additive ensures the remarkably enhanced discharge capacity, initial coulombic efficiency, cycling stability, and rate capability when utilized as anodes in lithium-ion batteries.
Sustainable and clean energies, such as solar energy and wind power, have stimulated tremendous research interests due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and emissions of pollutant gases as well as greenhouse gas CO2. For practical applications of the intermittent energies, an advanced energy storage and delivery system is of great importance. Among the various energy storage systems, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) has attracted attention worldwide for serving as an ideal power source for portable electronics1 and also a promising candidate for future hybrid electric vehicles or electric vehicles,2,3 because of their superior energy density compared with other energy storage devices. Graphite is usually employed as an anode material in LIBs due to its low cost and good reversibility in discharge–charge process; however, its low theoretical capacity (370 mA h g−1) cannot fulfill the needs of high energy density, high power density, and excellent cycle performance for the next generation of LIBs.
NiO is a competitive candidate owing to its high theoretical capacity (718 mA h g−1), environmental benignity, low cost, and abundance.4 Thanks to its much higher density of 6.8 g cm−3, the volumetric energy density of a NiO anode is 5.8 times that of the theoretical value of graphite.5 Unfortunately, just as other high capacity conversion-based6–8 and alloy-based9,10 anode materials, NiO suffers from poor cycling stability and rate performance because of the poor conductivity and large specific volume change during battery cycling, which leads to pulverization and deterioration of the active materials.11,12 To alleviate these problems, various NiO nanostructures have been studied extensively;13–16 but it is still an urgent task to further improve the rate capability and cycling stability.
Anode materials in the form of thin films usually achieve excellent cycling stability and rate capability because of the good conductivity;5,17–20 however, they are only suitable for microbatteries because of the low loading of active materials.21 NiO–carbon composites achieve good cycling stability;22–24 but the presence of low density carbon (the carbon amount is over half the weight of the composites in several cases22) decreases greatly the overall volumetric capacity and a multiple synthesis process is demanded for fabrications of the composites. Recently it is demonstrated that addition of some metals with high density, such as Au, Ag and Ni, contributes to the excellent electrochemical properties.25–28
Herein, we report synthesis of a NiO/Ni electrode with uniform three-dimension (3D) macroporous architecture and good conductivity to overcome the shortcomings encountered in conventional conversion-based electrodes, that is, low electrical conductivity, low ion transport rate, and large specific volume change. The 3D macroporous architecture allows efficient ingress and infiltration of the electrolyte and partially accommodates the large volume change. The chunks with a continuous network and the presence of homogeneously distributed metallic Ni are in favor of the electrical conductivity. The discharge capacity of the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni powder is 752 and 559 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2 C (144 mA g−1) and 4 C, respectively. Moreover, the initial coulombic efficiency is as high as 84%.
In the current investigation, 1.250 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.250 g Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 0.633 g hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 85 wt%), and 0.060 g glycine (C2H5NO2) were dissolved in deionized water to form a turbid precursor of the metal complex, which decomposed after a subsequent heating at 400 °C, leading to the formation of porous powders. When heating at 400 °C, dehydration of the precursor completes within 15 min, and the self-sustained decomposition reaction along with the combustion completes just within 1 min. It has been reported that Ni2+ can be complexed by N2H4, which further precipitates in the presence of anions such as CH3COO−.29,30 This kind of metal complex decomposes in an oxidative atmosphere (such as air) in an exothermal and self-sustained way at low temperatures.29,30 Here we add additional NO3− as an oxidant to achieve a more intensive decomposition procedure. The instant decomposition of CH3COO− results in vast gas evolution, favoring the formation of porous structures. Compared with the commonly used template-assisted approaches for macroporous materials, the present route for mass production of macroporous materials is simple, rapid, and low cost. Moreover, macropores form simultaneously with the lattice formation in one-step in the technique developed here.
The crystalline phase of the as-synthesized product was determined from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, the sharp Bragg diffraction peaks can be indexed to both NiO and Ni. Besides, there are also some very weak diffraction peaks corresponding to nickel carbide (Ni3C), which resulted from the decomposition of nickel acetate and can be oxidized thoroughly to NiO by a subsequent calcination in air.31Fig. 1b illustrates that, after calcination at 300 °C for 3 h, all Ni3C and partial Ni oxidized to NiO, achieving a weight percentage of ca. 63 wt% for NiO, as determined by means of a reference intensity ratio (RIR) method,32,33 which is further confirmed by monitoring the weight increment after the products totally transformed into phase-pure NiO through a subsequent calcination in air. Further increasing the temperature to 400 °C (for 3 h) results in phase-pure NiO (Fig. 1c).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the as-synthesized powders (a) and those after calcination in air for 3 h at 300 °C (b) and 400 °C (c). 

Fig. 2 shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the as-combusted product and those after calcination in air at 300 °C and 400 °C. All the products possess rough surfaces and contain fully developed and well connected 3D macropores. The pore size ranges from submicrometers to micrometers. Fig. 3a shows the low magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni, further illustrating the highly porous and well connected nature of the product. The wall thickness of the macropores is ca. 200 nm and the walls consisted of many fine nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c) demonstrates that the product is well crystallized NiO/Ni, which is consistent with the XRD result (Fig. 1b). The dark-field imaging in scanning TEM mode (STEM) of Ni with (111) orientation (the light spots in Fig. 3d) further suggests that the conductive Ni nanoparticles distributed randomly but homogeneously on the NiO skeletons, which effectively increase the electrical conductivity.

The electrochemical performance was evaluated by a standard NiO/Li coin type half-cell, where NiO and Li foil serve as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by a slurry coating procedure. The slurry consisted of 85 wt% samples, 10 wt% acetylene black and 5 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), and was coated on a copper foil, which acted as a current collector. The specific capacity presented here was calculated based on the quality of the active material (NiO). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves for the 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni powders are shown in Fig. 4a. A strong peak at ca. 0.36 V in the first cathodic scan is attributed to the initial reduction of NiO to Ni and the formation of amorphous Li2O, associating the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). There is a broad peak at ca. 2.23 V in the first anodic scan, which corresponds to oxidation of Ni to NiO and the decomposition of Li2O to Li. In the subsequent 2nd and 3rd cycles, the cathodic/anodic peak shifts to 1.19 V (with a shoulder around 1.15 V)/2.27 V, and 1.15 V/2.23 V, respectively, due to the drastic lithium driven, partial structural or textural modifications during the first lithiation process.34,35 The reaction mechanism of NiO with Li in LIBs is proposed as follows:34  
 Fig. 4  (a) The first 3 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves scanned at a rate of 0.1 mV s¬1 and (b) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at a current density of 360 mA g−1 (0.5 C) of the 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni powders. (c) Rate capability of the 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni, 400 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO and the commercial NiO nanoparticles (30 nm). (d) Cycling performance of the 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni powders at a current density of 360 mA g−1 (0.5 C). 

Fig. 4b shows the first three charge–discharge voltage profiles of the 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni at a constant current of 0.5 C (1 C is defined as a one hour complete charge or discharge, that is, 718 mA g−1 for NiO). The discharge plateau of ca. 0.62 V in the first cycle is attributed to the reduction of NiO to Ni, associating the formation of Li2O, and the formation of the SEI. The charge plateau at ca. 2.15 V represents oxidation of Ni to NiO, associating the reduction of Li2O to Li. The electrochemical reaction mechanism is consistent with the cyclic voltammetry results illustrated in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b also demonstrates that, the 3D macroporous sample exhibits a high discharge capacity of 865 mA h g−1 and 724 mA h g−1 in the 1st and 2nd cycles at a current density of 360 mA g−1 (0.5 C), respectively. A high initial coulombic efficiency of 84.3% is achieved, which is much larger than the efficiency of 66% for the 400 °C annealed phase-pure 3D macroporous NiO and 67% for the commercial NiO nanoparticles (ca. 30 nm in size). The irreversible capacity in the first cycle is assigned to the formation of the SEI layer and some undecomposed Li2O phase, which is common for most anode materials. A high initial coulombic efficiency is of great importance for practical applications. The improved initial coulombic efficiency may be attributed to the fact that Ni facilitates the decomposition of Li2O.36

Fig. 4c shows the rate capability of 300 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO/Ni, 400 °C annealed 3D macroporous NiO and commercial NiO nanoparticles. The 3D macroporous NiO/Ni delivers a discharge capacity of ca. 752, 742, 681, and 559 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, and 4 C, respectively; whereas the 3D macroporous NiO only displays 578, 356, 195, and 79 mA h g−1, respectively. This result further suggests that the highly conductive Ni plays an important role in the excellent electrochemical performance. The continuous network of 3D macroporous NiO also favors the electrical conductivity. However, the electrical conductivity of NiO is not high, which can be further improved by introducing the highly conductive metallic Ni. To verify this, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted to analyze the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni and NiO electrodes (see Fig. 5). The semicircle in the high frequency region corresponds to the electrolyte resistance and SEI resistance. The depressed semicircle in the medium frequency region is assigned to the charge transfer process. The straight line at a lower frequency region represents the typical Warburg behaviour, which is associated with the diffusion of lithium ions in the electrodes. It can be seen that the radius of the semicircle in the medium frequency region for the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni electrode is much smaller than that of the 3D macroporous NiO, indicating an enhanced electric conductivity. The fitting results based on the equivalent circuit given as inset in Fig. 5 further confirm such a conclusion. Here, Re, Rct, Zw, and CPEdl represents the electrolyte resistance, the charge-transfer resistance, the Warburg impedance, and the double-layer capacitance, respectively.37 The Rct for the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni electrode is 143 Ω, which is much smaller than that of the 3D macroporous NiO electrode (216 Ω).

The inset is the equivalent electrical circuit for fitting. The fitting results are represented by the solid lines. 
The capacity of commercial NiO nanoparticles degraded sharply to a negligible level at a current density of 0.5 C (as shown in Fig. 4c), due to the volume change, which results in pulverization and deterioration of the active material. The electrochemical performance of commercial NiO nanoparticles is similar to that of a NiO nanosheet reported in the literature.38 The rate capability and cycling stability of 3D macroporous NiO are much better than that of nanoparticles, exhibiting the benefits of the unique 3D macroporous architecture, which guarantees the efficient ingress and infiltration of the electrolyte and partially accommodates the large volume change. When the current is returned to 0.2 C, the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni resumes its capacity of 687 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles at different current densities (10 cycles each), suggesting an excellent cycling stability. Fig. 4d further shows the excellent cycling stability of the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni at a constant current density of 360 mA g−1 (0.5 C). The electrochemical properties of the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni are even better than those of an ordered mesoporous NiO recently reported (containing 40 wt% acetylene black).14 At a high current of 2872 mA g−1 (4 C), a high capacity of 559 mA h g−1 for the 3D macroporous NiO/Ni is achieved, which is highly attractive when compared with other NiO nanostructures,13,14 composites38,39 and even thin films17–20 with high performance.
The volumetric storage capacity is an important parameter for LIBs in practice; yet a porous structure would inevitably decrease the tapping density of electrode materials. Fortunately, the density of both NiO and Ni is relatively high (6.8 g cm−3 for NiO and 8.9 g cm−3 for Ni) and the network achieved in the current investigation is in micrometer size, which can partially counterbalance the tapping (or packing) density.40,41 The tapping density of the present 3D macroporous NiO/Ni is 1.33 g cm−3, which was measured by tapping the powders in a measuring cylinder until the volume did not change anymore, on a JZ-1 Tap Density Analyzer (Chengdu Jingxi Powder Analyse Instruments Co., Ltd., Sichuan, China). The tapping density is higher than that of the commercial graphite (∼1 g cm−3).42 The volumetric capacity of the present 3D macroporous NiO/Ni powders is thus determined to be 630 mA h cm−3 (at 0.2 C), which is calculated based on the total volume of NiO and Ni.
In summary, we fabricated a 3D macroporous NiO/Ni via a metal complex route. Because of the highly distributed conductive Ni additive and the uniform 3D macroporous architecture, this material demonstrates a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity, initial coulombic efficiency, cycling stability, and rate capability when utilized as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. These results also suggest an effective architecture for other high capacity electrode materials in energy storage.
