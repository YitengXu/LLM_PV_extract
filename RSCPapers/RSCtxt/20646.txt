    , Accepted 17th July 2018First published on 24th July 2018AbstractControlled double-deck packing is an appealing means to expand upon conventional 2D self-assembly which is critical in crystal engineering, yet it is rare and poorly understood. Herein, we report the first systematic study of double-deck assembly in a series of alkylated aminoquinone derivatives at the liquid–solid interface. The competition between the fraction of alkyl chains adsorbed on the surface and the optimal conformation of the alkyl chains near the head group leads to a stepwise structural transformation ranging from complete double-deck packing to complete monolayer packing. Alkyl chains on the bottom or top layer of the double-deck assemblies were selectively visualized by carefully tuning the scanning tunneling microscopy settings. A method to easily identify mirror image domains was discovered based on the coincidence of domain boundaries with a graphite main axis. The effect of molecular symmetry and metal complexation on the formation of the double-deck assembly was also explored. Based on 2D crystal engineering principles, this bottom-up double-deck assembly can potentially provide an essential toehold for constructing precise 3D hierarchical structures.
Introduction
Molecular self-assembly has long been recognized as a powerful means towards bottom-up fabrication of functional surface-based nanostructures.1 This approach enables the construction of well-ordered nanostructures on solid surfaces using small molecular building blocks.2 Such functionalized surfaces can be used as templates or as functional elements in applications including crystal growth, catalysis, sensing, and organic electronic devices.3–5 The assembly of molecules in a programmed manner is a highly attractive and sought after goal to enhance molecular engineering. However, even in two-dimensions, it remains difficult to predict the outcome of molecular self-assembly solely on the basis of the chemical structure of the building blocks, due to the crucial role played by the competitive non-covalent interactions (van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking, electrostatic and dipole–dipole intermolecular forces). A better understanding of such interactions continues to improve our ability to foresee and control the outcome of surface-supported supramolecular assemblies, which are, in turn, valuable for the construction of molecular nanostructures and nanodevices.
Alkyl chains have been demonstrated to play important roles in intermolecular interactions and hence affect supramolecular self-assembly.6,7 Generally, alkyl side chains are attached onto molecular building blocks to tailor the molecular packing and thin-film morphology.8–11 More importantly, these structural effects induce alterations of chemical, physical, and surface/interfacial properties such as chemical reactivity, tribology, and electronic/electrochemical properties.6–8,12,13 For example, Yiu et al. revealed that long linear alkyl side-chains promote nanostructural order in thin-film solar cells, enhancing power conversion efficiencies from 5% to 6.5%.14 Ghosh et al. demonstrated blue-shifted or red-shifted fluorescence properties of perylene bisimides with longer or bulkier side chains, respectively.15
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a very powerful tool to visualize molecular organization at the ‘buried’ and often inaccessible liquid/solid interfaces.16 It provides direct evidence of molecular structure with sub-molecular resolution. The gathered knowledge regarding alkyl chain behavior could not have been obtained otherwise.17–21 For example, STM can be used to visualize chiral recognition and chirality transfer based on alkyl chain van der Waals interactions.17,21
Previously, studying charge-assisted hydrogen bonding (CAHB) assembly of p-quinonemonoimine, C18m, we discovered an unexploited aspect of alkyl chain packing behavior (Fig. 1d & h).22 In particular, we found that only 3/4 of the alkyl chains in interdigitated C18m lamellae are visualized by STM. This type of ‘missing alkyl chain phenomenon’ in self-assembled molecular systems is quite prevalent.10,11,20,23–68 Some researchers simply assume all the alkyl chains have adsorbed on the surface; while others rationalize that the alkyl chains are pointing out of the plane of the monolayer into the liquid phase (a.k.a., ‘flying alkyl chains’) or air.10,11,20,29,30,39–68 Correctly assigned packing models are essential for future developments in surface molecular engineering, since their location could significantly alter the interfacial properties and impact the hierarchical 3D growth. A fundamental understanding of the assembly process provides a starting point to tune the supramolecular assembly on surfaces and to ultimately fabricate functional devices.

A pair of molecules (the smallest repeating unit) are highlighted, one has both alkyl chains adsorbed on the surface (represented in yellow); while the other one has both alkyl chains lying on top of the alkyl chains of the bottom molecule (represented in green). Such overlapping yields double layered alkyl chains with a single layer of polar head groups. (d) C18m forms partial double-deck packing, where every 4th alkyl chain is lying on top of another alkyl chain. The green and yellow highlighted molecules illustrated the overlapping pattern. (e–f) C22m forms two types of partial double-deck packing, where every 4th (e) or 7th (f) alkyl chain is lying on top of another alkyl chain. (f) The unit cell consists of 4 molecules, where alkyl chains of 3 molecules (yellow) are completely adsorbed on the surface, while one of the alkyl chains of the green molecules is adsorbed on top of another alkyl chain of a yellow molecule.

The unit cell dimensions are given in Table 1. The three symmetry axes of graphite (〈−1 2 −1 0〉, 〈−1 –1 2 0〉 and 〈2 –1 –1 0〉) are highlighted with black lines (refer to Fig. S1† for more details). Tunneling parameters: (a) It = 17.3 pA, Vb = −522.7 mV; (b) It = 17.3 pA, Vb = −322.9 mV; (c) It = 40.0 pA, Vb = −300 mV; (d) It = 16.0 pA, Vb = −300 mV; (e) It = 20.0 pA, Vb = −50.0 mV and (f) It = 13.0 pA, Vb = −92.0 mV. 
We proposed another packing model to explain this mysterious ‘missing alkyl chain’ phenomenon where the missing alkyl chain is adsorbed on top an underlying chain.22 We coined this packing as double-deck assembly (Fig. 1d & j). This double-deck assembly is related to self-assembly of double-deck cyclophane derivatives69–73 as both form layers two molecules thick where parts of a given molecule are located in the two planes. However, our system has an advantage of a dramatically simpler building blocks, readily synthesised by a one pot transamination reaction.
To gain full understanding of this missing alkyl chain phenomenon, we now explore the influence of alkyl chain length and molecular symmetry on double-deck packing by performing a systematic study of an expanded molecular repertoire of six zwitterionic p-quinonemonoimines. These are referred herein as meta quinones, C12m, C14m, C16m and, C22m, which differ in aliphatic chain length, a metal coordinated dimer of C18m, (C18m)2Ni and an isomer of C18m, 2,5-bis(octadecylamino)1,4-quinone, with para orientation of the octadecylamino groups, C18p (Scheme 1).

Results and discussion
Zwitterionic meta quinones spontaneously self-assemble into ordered networks immediately after deposition of saturated solutions (trichlorobenzene; TCB) onto the HOPG surface. The surface is covered with a lamellar pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes. The quinone head groups appear as the bright regions while the alkyl chains are darker (Fig. 1a–f). The unit cell information is provided in Table 1. Strong charge-assisted hydrogen bonding (CAHB) locks the head groups of meta derivatives with a fixed separation. This is corroborated by the fact that the unit cell ‘a’ distances are constant for all the meta quinones (1.48 ± 0.04 nm), which provides an ideal terrain to explore alkyl chain length effects on 2D self-assembly. As expected, the unit cell ‘b’ distances increase as alkyl chain length increases (Table 1). The measured unit cell dimensions indicate that the alkyl chains of meta quinones are fully extended and interdigitating within the lamellae. Interestingly, although all our meta derivatives pack in a lamellar fashion, they show a different ratio of the number of observed alkyl chains with respect to the number of head groups. In the high-resolution images (Fig. 1a–c), the number of head groups and corresponding alkyl chains can be clearly viewed. For C12m, C14m and C16m the head group to alkyl chain ratio is 1:1 as opposed to the expected 1:2 ratio of the actual molecular structure. The intersection angles between the head group rows and chain-orientation (referred to hereafter as the β angle) are all 45° ± 1°. The missing alkyl chains are adsorbed on top of the lower layer of alkyl chains forming complete double-deck assembly (Fig. 1g & j, vide infra).22

When the alkyl chain length increases to 18 carbons (C18m) the head group-to-alkyl chain ratio changes to 4:3 (Fig. 1d).22 In other words, 3 out of 4 alkyl chains are adsorbed on the HOPG and every 4th alkyl chain is proposed to be adsorbed on top of another alkyl chain (Fig. 1h). In this case, the β angle is 60° ± 1°.22Fig. 2 is a simplified packing model of this partial double-deck assembly (top view) highlighting the β angle. The β angle can be measured directly from high-resolution STM images or indirectly obtained from domain orientation with respect to the underlying HOPG. The β angle and unit cell dimensions are the two essential parameters for modeling molecular packing, where the former indicates the alkyl chain orientation and the latter provides the building block-to-building block distance (vide infra).
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of molecular packing. Head groups and alkyl chains are indicated by green disks and blue lines, respectively. A unit cell is highlighted by a dotted parallelogram. ‘a’ is the unit cell vector along the head-group row, ‘b’ is the unit cell vector connecting adjacent head-group rows. Note that the β angle is different from the unit cell γ angle. β is the angle intersecting the head group row (dark blue line) and alkyl chain direction (red line). d⊥total is the total perpendicular distance available to accommodate alkyl chain adsorption per unit cell. 
C22m, bearing longer alkyl chains, not only shows two polymorphs (Fig. 1e & f), but also displays two characteristic domain boundary transition structures (Fig. 3). Besides the type 1 morphology, C18m-like, with 60° β angle and 3 out of 4 alkyl chains adsorbed on the HOPG (Fig. 1e), C22m also forms another morphology (type 2) where the β angle is 86° ± 1° (Fig. 1f). This type 2 morphology is more prominent and covers ca. 70% of the imaged graphite surface. In contrast to the type 1 morphology, there are 7 out of 8 alkyl chains adsorbed on the HOPG in this type 2 morphology (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, two types of boundary transition structures of C22m (type 3) can be found between the two type 2 domains (Fig. 3). Depending on the given separation at the boundaries, both non-interdigitated (type 3A; highlighted region in Fig. 3a) and interdigitated (type 3B; highlighted region in Fig. 3b) arrangements can be found. For the non-interdigitated arrangement, all of the alkyl chains are adsorbed, while for the interdigitated arrangement only half of the alkyl chains are adsorbed on the surface. In the latter case, the other half of the alkyl chains are overlapping on top, forming a complete double-deck assembly similar to the shorter chain meta compounds (C12m, C14m and C16m). Both types of boundary transition structures share the same β angle of 34° ± 1°.

(a) Non-interdigitated packing (type 3A) and (b) complete double-deck assembly (type 3B). The three main axes of graphite are highlighted with black lines. Tunneling parameters: (a) It = 20.0 pA, Vb = −856.0 mV; (b) It = 25.0 pA, Vb = −313.0 mV; (c) It = 22.0 pA, Vb = −47.0 mV. 
A possible reason for the rich and varied surface structures observed for C22m is attributed to the longer alkyl chains, which increase the adsorption energy. For every additional CH2 group, the molecule-to-substrate affinity is expected to increase by 12.1 or 10.4 kJ mol−1 is expected to increase by 10.4 to 12.1 kJ mol−1.74 When the interaction between molecules and substrate is strong, molecules are more likely to get kinetically trapped in metastable structures. As a result, more metastable self-assemblies are observed for C22m.
(C18m)2Ni, synthesized via a solvent-free mechanosynthesis,75 is a metal coordination complex formed from two C18m units and a nickel(II) ion (Scheme 1). Since all the meta quinones have the same head to head distance (unit cell a distance), the intention of inserting a metal ion was to increase the molecule to molecule distance and observe its effect on double-deck packing. Another consequence of forming the Ni complex was to change from CAHB to normal HB (i.e. metal complexation removes one proton from each quinone and the resulting (C18m)2Ni is no longer zwitterionic). From high resolution images (Fig. 4a), (C18m)2Ni still forms double-deck packing, where 3 out of 4 alkyl chains are adsorbed on the HOPG, analogous to the self-assembly of C18m.22 In this case, the β angle is 66° ± 1°. The measured unit cell vector ‘a’ increased to 1.51 nm (Table 1), which is slightly longer than that of C18m (1.48 nm). This distance increase is probably due to a decrease in hydrogen bonding strength from the CAHB to the normal HB. Ni(II), with a filled dz2 orbital, cannot be visualized by STM,76 however the position of Ni(II) can still be deduced from the head group arrangement (Fig. 4b & c). Based on the square planar geometry of the Ni complex, the Ni ion is expected to be located between aligned quinone partners as outlined in Fig. 4b.77 Such high resolution STM images provide important evidence for determining the configuration of the metal complex, more specifically, the trans-geometry at the metal center.

Note that one of the alkyl chains is underneath an alkyl chain from a molecule on the other side. It = 26.0 pA, Vb = −800.0 mV. (b) A zoomed-in image of the head group region in (a). The shape of the head groups of the quinone is outlined in black and the position of the Ni atoms is highlighted. (c) Molecular model of head groups of (C18m)2Ni, where Ni is coloured in green. (d) High-resolution STM image (lower) and model (upper) of C18p. The parallelogram indicates the unit cell. Unit cell dimensions are given in Table 1. The three axes of graphite are highlighted with black lines. It = 16.0 pA, Vb = −200.0 mV. 
Furthermore, C18p, which is a constitutional isomer of C18m, is designed to investigate the effect of building block symmetry on the alkyl chain packing. Though it is no longer zwitterionic, due to the partial charges on the nitrogen and oxygen, it can still form CAHBs (Scheme 1).78 Different in the position of the alkyl chains attached to the quinone core, C18p has C2h symmetry while C18m has C2v symmetry. CAHB connects the head groups of C18p to form a string-of-pearl-like lamellar packing with non-interdigitated alkyl chains. Based on unit cell measurements, all alkyl chains are adsorbed on HOPG and are fully extended (Table 1 and Fig. 4d).
All the molecules studied herein are prochiral. Prochiral molecules can adopt a chiral conformation when adsorbed on a surface and, as such, chiral domains are often observed.79 A total of 6 domain orientations can be observed in cases where the unit cell vector a does not run parallel or perpendicular to one of the three main symmetry axes of graphite. That is, 3 domains rotate clockwise and 3 domains rotate counterclockwise with respect to graphite's symmetry axes (i.e. there are 3 pairs of mirror image domains).80 In the two exceptions, when the head group row (unit cell vector a) lies parallel or perpendicular to the main symmetry axes of HOPG, only 3 domain orientations are observed. For example, in the case of C18m and the type 1 morphology of C22m, only 3 domain orientations are observed since the head group rows (unit cell vector a) follow one of the main axes of graphite. The alkyl chains follow one of the two remaining graphite axes resulting in the formation of either a linear or herringbone structure.22
Some interesting behavior at the domain boundaries between two mirror-image chiral domains was observed for all the molecules studied here (Fig. 5), except for C18m (vide infra). From the large-scale STM images in Fig. 5, sometimes the domain boundary appeared ‘fuzzy’ (Fig. 5a upper); while other times we see a flawless transition (Fig. 5 lower, b, c, d upper, e & f). We attribute this phenomenon to alkyl chain alignment. From the upper model in Fig. 5a, when the alkyl chains in two different domains are not aligned, a high energy domain boundary is created where there are large areas where molecules cannot be fully adsorbed (black empty space). On the other hand, when alkyl chains from two different domains are aligned (following the same HOPG axis; lower inset in Fig. 5a) a much smoother transition can result. After careful examination, three characteristic features of the domain boundaries of mirror image domains were found: (i) a smooth straight line, (ii) parallel to one of the main axes of HOPG and (iii) the alkyl chains in both domains are parallel to the domain boundary. A straight domain boundary following the direction of the alkyl chains is the most stable, since it creates the least amount of high energy pockets. The only possibility for the two domains, in which alkyl chains are parallel to each other, while head group rows are not, can occur when the two domains are mirror image chiral domains (identified arbitrarily as R and L in Fig. 5). This is why such a phenomenon is not observed for C18m and C22m type 1 morphology, since the domains are achiral. One should observe such phenomenon in most small molecules carrying long alkyl chains that form lamellar chiral domains. One can thus take advantage of these generic rules to help identify mirror image chiral domains.

Mirror image chiral domains are highlighted in yellow (Left) and red (Right). (a) A ‘fuzzy’ domain boundary is circled by a dotted oval, while a straight smooth domain boundary which follows one of the axes of HOPG is circled by a solid oval in (a) molecular models illustrate the origin of noisy (top) and smooth (bottom) domain boundary transitions.

Tunneling parameters: (a) It = 20.0 pA, Vb = −856.0 mV; (b) It = 22 pA, Vb = −47 mV; (c) It = 17 pA, Vb = −300 mV; (d) It = 13 pA, Vb = −293 mV.

Below, we delve deeper into the adsorption behaviour of meta quinones (C12m, C14m, C16m, C18m and C22m) as well as the closely related metal complex (C18m)2Ni and isomeric aminoquinone derivative C18p, focusing on the role of alkyl chain length. As discussed above, a series of double-deck assembly structures with different numbers of alkyl chains adsorbed on the surface is proposed, except for C18p. Every second alkyl chain in C12m, C14m and C16m is in the upper layer, thus forming a complete double-deck assembly structure (Fig. 1a–c). The packing of C22m, bearing longer alkyl chains, ranges from complete monolayer packing to complete double-deck assembly. The type 1 morphology, C18m-like, has 1 of 4 alkyl chains adsorbed on top of the first layer (Fig. 1e), while the type 2 morphology has 1 of 8 alkyl chains adsorbed on top of the first layer (Fig. 1f). The type 3 morphology of C22m has a complete monolayer structure (type 3A; Fig. 3a) or a complete double-deck assembly (type 3B; Fig. 3b).
In response to changes in alkyl chain length, a systemic quantized change in the double-deck assembly of aminoquinone derivatives is observed. For meta quinones, the β angles and the fraction of unaccounted alkyl chains (i.e. missing alkyl chains) were plotted against the alkyl chain length (Fig. 6). The fraction here refers to the number of alkyl chains that are not adsorbed on the surface divided by the total number of alkyl chains in a unit cell. From the graph, one can notice that the β angles and the fraction of unaccounted alkyl chains are coupled with each other. The fraction remains the same for the shorter alkyl chain meta quinones (C12m, C14m & C16m fraction equals to 1/2), which form complete double-deck assembly (i.e. they all have the same 45 ± 1° β angle). A sudden decrease in the fraction from 1/2 to 1/4 occurs when the alkyl chain length increases to C18. The 1/4 partial double-deck assembly of C18m and the type 1 packing of C22m both have a 60° ± 1° β angle. The next sudden decrease in the fraction from 1/4 to 1/8 occurred for the C22m type 2 polymorph, which is the major polymorph. The β angle increases to 86° ± 1° for the 1/8 partial double-deck assembly. This trend of decreasing the fraction of unaccounted alkyl chains as a function of alkyl chain length is due to the competition between van der Waals interactions and alkyl chain bending propensity. The molecular mechanics (MM+) optimized structure of an isolated meta quinone derivative has both alkyl chains naturally open at 45° away from the central axis of the molecule (Fig. S2†). When the alkyl chains are short, the tendency for the chains to bend away from an optimal geometry is low. However, when the alkyl chains get longer, the adsorption energy increases, and as a result, more alkyl chains will adsorb on the surface at the expense of the β angle. Increasing the number of alkyl chains adsorbed to the HOPG is realized by an increase in the total perpendicular distance assigned to the alkyl chains in a unit cell d⊥tot, (highlighted in Fig. 2). Measuring d⊥tot can also allow us to estimate the number of alkyl chains adsorbed directly to the substrate. Given that the alkyl chain separation is typically about 4.5 nm,81 one can estimate that there are ca. 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7 and 2 alkyl chains adsorbed on the substrate (per unit cell) for C12m, C14m, C16m, C18m, (C18m)2Ni, C22m and C18p, respectively.
 Fig. 6  A plot of fraction of unaccounted missing alkyl chains for the meta quinones vs. alkyl chain length. 
The missing alkyl chain phenomenon has been observed in high-resolution STM images for all the meta quinone derivatives and (C18m)2Ni. Generally, it is important to determine the location of the missing alkyl chains (whether extended into the solution or adsorbed on the surface), since their location fundamentally affects 3D hierarchical growth of the film and the resulting properties (e.g., hydrophobicity). Several observations presented below validate that for our systems, the alkyl chains are overlapping. First, in many high-resolution images, every 4th or 7th alkyl chain appears higher than its neighbors for C18m and C22m, respectively (Fig. 7a & b). These periodic patterns match exactly with the observed ratio of unaccounted alkyl chains. The contrast variation cannot be attributed to Moiré effect because split images in Fig. 8 (obtained by suddenly changing the bias voltage from a molecular setting to an HOPG setting) clearly show that the alkyl chains are fully commensurate with the HOPG lattice.

For C18m every 4th alkyl chain is bright, while for C22m every 7th alkyl chain is bright, in agreement with the proposed model. (a) It = 19.8 pA, Vb = 259.40 mV; (b) It = 8.8 pA, Vb = 393.7 mV. Green arrows highlight alkyl chains and the longer green arrows highlight the brighter alkyl chains. (c) Visualization of the alkyl chains can be influence by the imaging parameters: upper: It = 6 pA, Vb = 328.3 mV; lower: It = 6 pA, Vb = 437.0 mV.

It can be easily noticed that the alkyl chain separation of both C18m and C22m matches exactly with the HOPG periodicity along 〈−1 1 0 0〉 direction that is 4.26 Å as indicated in (c). (a) It = 16 pA, Vb = −300.0 mV (SAMN) and 39.0 mV (HOPG), (b) It = 18 pA, Vb = −350.0 mV (SAMN) and 40.0 mV. 
Note that by changing the bias voltage, one can selectively observe the bottom layer or the double layer (Fig. 7c). Clearly at 328 mV or 437 mV, no molecules are removed from the surface. Such reversible appearance/disappearance of structures on the STM images at respectively high/low voltages is known as the “tunneling transparency”.82–84
In order for meta quinones to densely pack on the surface, the two meta related alkyl chains have to bend to be parallel to each other. To avoid repulsion energy the head groups will bend away from the plain of the alkyl chains, as has been shown in the corresponding crystal structures.22,75 Due to the CAHB, quinone head groups self-assemble into zigzag backbone axes (Fig. 1). The out-of-plane bending of the head groups causes the alkyl chains at either side to be at different levels (Fig. 1j). In other words, when one side of the alkyl chains is adsorbed on a surface, the head groups lift the alkyl chains on the other side upwards, which allows optimal stacking on top of the neighboring row, i.e. double-deck assembly. This hypothesis has been verified with both C18p and (C18m)2Ni. When the alkyl chains are in the para position, the molecule lies flat on the HOPG and cannot form double-deck assembly. On the other hand, Ni complexation increased building-block to building-block distance, however, since the intrinsic bending near the head group region is still present, double-deck assembly can and does occur.
In addition, this quasi-three-dimensional interdigitated structure of alkyl chain lamellae features multiple attractive van der Waals interactions. In fact, the parallel alignment of alkyl chains adsorbed on another layer of alkyl chains is the preferred orientation in 3D crystals.22
There is great interest in the controlled formation of multilayered supramolecular structures. For example, Beton et al. have reported the guest-induced growth85 and the sequential epitaxial deposition of supramolecular multilayers.86
The facile growth of ordered multilayers described herein further supports the proposed neatly packed double-deck lamellae. Multilayer growth in both a criss-crossed (Fig. 9) and parallel fashion (Fig. S3†) have been observed for quinone derivatives with alkyl chains equal or longer than 18 carbons. We ascribe this phenomenon to strong intermolecular interactions which ‘link’ them to pack into stripe-like fibers that can stack on top of each other, forming multilayers, while the orientations are governed by the underlying layer. The favorable inter-layer interactions are probably electrostatic and may also involve alkyl chain/alkyl chain van der Waals interactions.87,88 The second layer often extends over domain boundaries leading to misaligned bilayers easily visualized as a characteristic rhomboidal grid. Note that these motifs are not due to a double-tip effect sometimes observed in STM imaging since: (i) monolayers and multilayers can be identified in the same image and (ii) the phenomenon of multilayer formation is reproducible in several experimental sessions. In short, evidence of multilayer growth supports the hypothesis of double-deck assembly, where high-density multilayers can be formed. On the other hand, if these missing alkyl chains point out of the plane of the monolayer, they are expected to perturb the assembly of the second layer.
 Fig. 9  Evidence for multilayer formation; (a) It = 12 pA, Vb = 686 mV. (b) It = 26 pA, Vb = 528 mV. (c) It = 20 pA, Vb = 600 mV. (d) It = 30 pA, Vb = −1753 mV. Parallel double layer see Fig. S3.† 
Experimental
Materials and methods
STM measurements were carried out under ambient conditions (20–22 °C) with a Bruker Nanoscope MultiMode Scanning Probe Microscope equipped with a low-current STM head or an RHK STM (SPM1000) running under ambient conditions. In situ STM imaging was performed at the liquid/solid interface; the substrate was freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG; ZYB quality; NT-MDT Castletroy, Limerick, Ireland). Mechanically sharpened Pt/Ir (80/20; NanoScience Instruments, Phoenex, AZ) tips were tested by obtaining atomic resolution images of graphite and subsequently a drop (ca. 4 μL) of sample solutions in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (Aldrich, 99%) was added. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were observed immediate after the tip was engaged. Solutions of C18m, C22m and (C18m)2Ni were heated prior to deposition to improve the solubility. For other derivatives, saturated solutions were used. The specific tunneling conditions are given in the figure captions. All the images were corrected for drift by WSxM software,89 using the recorded graphite images for calibration purposes. A detailed and useful tutorial showing how images were calibrated can be found in the ESI.† For the synthesis of the alkylated aminoquinone derivatives that were employed in this study, see the ESI.†
Conclusions
We reported a systematic STM study of double-deck assembly at the liquid–solid interface. Exploring self-assembly of zwiterionic p-quinoneimine derivatives as a function of alkyl chain length, we demonstrated that the occupation of the upper deck decreases as the alkyl chain length increases. The associated structural transformation from full double-deck assembly (i.e. C12m–C16m) to complete monolayer packing (i.e. type 3A packing of C22m) is quantized (Fig. 6). This is rationalized in terms of competition between maximizing the alkyl chains adsorption on a surface and minimizing their conformational distortion near the head group (β angle). This study provides definitive evidence of double-deck assembly as a general behavior of polyalkylated molecules which can now be used to promote the selective formation of hierarchical supramolecular films. Such double-deck assembly should generally occur when molecules have two competing interactions with mismatching periodicities. The ability to control the density of the second layer with precise periodicity paves the way towards the bottom-up construction of hierarchical structures with long range periodicities. In the future, a dynamic transamination of these zwiterionic p-quinoneimines90 may open the possibility of in situ functionalization of the second layer electronically decoupled from the surface.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  STM images and molecular models of SAMs formed from meta quinone derivatives at the TCB/HOPG interface. (a–c) C12m, C14m, C16m form complete double-deck packing. A pair of molecules (the smallest repeating unit) are highlighted, one has both alkyl chains adsorbed on the surface (represented in yellow); while the other one has both alkyl chains lying on top of the alkyl chains of the bottom molecule (represented in green). Such overlapping yields double layered alkyl chains with a single layer of polar head groups.

 	Fig. 2  Schematic representation of molecular packing. Head groups and alkyl chains are indicated by green disks and blue lines, respectively. A unit cell is highlighted by a dotted parallelogram. ‘a’ is the unit cell vector along the head-group row, ‘b’ is the unit cell vector connecting adjacent head-group rows. Note that the β angle is different from the unit cell γ angle. β is the angle intersecting the head group row (dark blue line) and alkyl chain direction (red line). d⊥total is the total perpendicular distance available to accommodate alkyl chain adsorption per unit cell.

STM images of the self-assembled networks of C18p (a), (C18m)2Ni (b), C22m type 2 morphology (c), C16m (d), C14m (e) and C12m (f) at TCB/HOPG interface. Mirror image chiral domains are highlighted in yellow (Left) and red (Right). (a) A ‘fuzzy’ domain boundary is circled by a dotted oval, while a straight smooth domain boundary which follows one of the axes of HOPG is circled by a solid oval in (a) molecular models illustrate the origin of noisy (top) and smooth (bottom) domain boundary transitions. Black lines highlight the three main symmetry axes of HOPG. Tunneling parameters: (a) It = 20.0 pA, Vb = −856.0 mV; (b) It = 22 pA, Vb = −47 mV; (c) It = 17 pA, Vb = −300 mV; (d) It = 13 pA, Vb = −293 mV.

 	Fig. 7  STM topography image of C18m and C22m adsorbed at the TCB/HOPG interface, where periodic bright alkyl chains were observed. For C18m every 4th alkyl chain is bright, while for C22m every 7th alkyl chain is bright, in agreement with the proposed model. (a) It = 19.8 pA, Vb = 259.40 mV; (b) It = 8.8 pA, Vb = 393.7 mV. Green arrows highlight alkyl chains and the longer green arrows highlight the brighter alkyl chains. (c) Visualization of the alkyl chains can be influence by the imaging parameters: upper: It = 6 pA, Vb = 328.3 mV; lower: It = 6 pA, Vb = 437.0 mV.
