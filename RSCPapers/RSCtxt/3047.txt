    , Accepted 14th April 2022First published on 14th April 2022AbstractA layered covalent organic framework (COF) material based on an imine-linkage with high thermal and chemical stability was prepared using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the green medium. The as-synthesized COF materials were modified with catalytic copper. This crystalline and highly porous catalyst shows excellent photocatalytic performance in visible-light-driven coupling reactions of terminal alkynes with H-phosphonates at room temperature. In addition, the photocatalyst could be recovered and recycled eight times without significant loss of its reactivity.
Introduction
In organic synthesis, the carbon–phosphorus bond-forming reaction represents a valuable synthetic toolbox, which enables direct access to various organophosphorus compounds.1 Organophosphorus moieties form the building blocks of many drugs and biomolecules and play a key role in their activities.2 They have a wide range of applications in organic synthesis, agriculture, medicinal chemistry, materials, catalysis and coordination chemistry.3 Among them, alkynyl phosphonate compounds, bearing reactive triple bonds and phosphoryl groups, are an important class of valuable chemicals containing carbon–phosphorus bonds, which are widely used as bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry and as additives or flame retardants in polymer science.4 Furthermore, they can also serve as key precursors for the synthesis of highly functional phosphorus compounds through conjugate-addition reactions, metallacycle formation, and unique cycloadditions.5 Due to their importance, many methods have been developed for the synthesis of alkynylphosphonates from diverse organic molecules.6 Traditional strategies for the synthesis of alkynylphosphonates mainly rely on the reaction by using toxic and moisture sensitive dialkyl or diphenyl chlorophosphates as phosphorus electrophiles with Li or Mg acetylides under hazardous reaction conditions, which usually suffer from prefunctionalization of the starting materials and poor tolerance of functional groups.7 To address these issues, alternative methods have been developed based on the use of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, including 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes,8 bromoalkynes,9 4-aryl-2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ols,10 arylpropiolic acids11 and with H-phosphonates (Scheme 1). For technical and economic reasons, the direct synthesis of alkynyl phosphonates from readily available starting alkynes is the most attractive method. In 2009, the group of Zhao and Han first reported a copper-catalyzed oxidative coupling of alkynes with H-phosphonates, affording alkynylphosphonates in high yields.12 However, secondary phosphine oxide Ph2P(O)H did not afford the oxidative coupling product under their reaction conditions. Soon after, further modifications have been made to improve the yield and efficiency of this reaction by employing various transition metals such as Ag2CO3,13 Pd(OAc)2,14 Cu/Cu2O@Nb2O5,15 Cu2O,16 Cu-MnO17 and TiO2/Cu2O18 as a promoter or catalyst. Although the above oxidative cross-coupling reaction can be carried out using terminal alkynes without pre-functionalization, there are some disadvantages such as relatively stringent reaction conditions, use of excess non-recyclable catalyst and toxic solvents, carrying out the reaction at high temperature or very limited substrate scope. Therefore, from the viewpoint of green and sustainable chemistry, the development of an efficient, eco-friendly and economic approach to realize this transformation is still greatly desirable.
 Scheme 1  Different routes for the synthesis of alkynylphosphonates. 
Solar energy, an abundant, clean, economical, and inexhaustible energy is considered to be a highly economical and environmentally friendly energy source. In the last few decades, significant advances have been made in visible-light-driven organic transformations under very mild conditions.19 However, in most cases, photosensitive molecules such as noble metal complexes (such as iridium, ruthenium, rhodium, etc.) and organic dyes have been used as homogeneous photocatalysts for a variety of organic reactions.20,21 Unfortunately, because of their poor recyclability, high cost, carcinogenicity and non-degradability, the application is limited. Heterogeneous photocatalysis, with the advantages of easy separation and catalyst reusability, has become a powerful and sustainable technique in organic synthesis.22 In this regard, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composed of strong covalent bonds between pure organic molecules have attracted extensive attention due to their low density, large surface area, structural versatility, permanent porosity, excellent chemical and thermal stability.23 They have been widely used in the fields of gas adsorption, energy storage, water oxidation, sensing and catalysis.24 In particular, two-dimensional COFs (2D-COFs) have an extended π-conjugated skeleton and layered stacking structure, inherent light-harvesting and energy transition capabilities, excellent charge mobility and a long range of exciton delocalization, which provide an ideal channel for carrier migration and charge separation. They have been actively explored as heterogeneous catalysts in the field of photocatalytic organic conversions.25,26 Although COFs have the advantage of easy bandgap engineering, pure COF photocatalysts exhibit relatively weak photocatalytic activity due to fast charge recombination and low charge carrier separation efficiency in their photocatalytic systems. To further improve the photocatalytic activity of COFs, they are often hybridized with metallic nanoparticles (NPs) or other semiconductors.27 In 2021, Almansaf and co-workers reported a Pt-metallated COF for decarboxylative difluoroalkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions, in which the loaded Pt enhanced the photocatalytic activity of COF.28 Recently, Chen et al. reported a triazine-based COF decorated with a single Ni site to form a dual catalyst for visible-light-driven S–C cross-coupling reactions.29 Moreover, copper complexes have become powerful photocatalysts in different chemical transformations due to their abundance, low cost, ease of preparation, and ability to provide strong photoexcited reducing power.30
From the standpoint of green chemistry as well as in connection with our ongoing research program on the development of novel heterogeneous catalysts for organic reactions,31 herein, we report a new photosensitive triazine-based COF, decorated with Cu sites, to form a dual catalyst (defined as TPT-COF-Cu) and probe its catalytic capabilities for the synthesis of alkynylphosphonates via oxidative coupling reactions of terminal alkynes with H-phosphonates at room temperature.
Results and discussion
A photosensitive triazine-based COF scaffold (denoted as TPT-COF) was prepared via the condensation of 4,4′,4′′-((1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde (TPT-CHO) and [2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-diamine (Bpy-NH2) using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu4NBr/Im) as a green medium. The condensation reaction was carried out in an open container due to the low vapour pressure of a Bu4NBr/Im-based DES at 90 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, Cu(II) bound TPT-COF-Cu was simply prepared by impregnating TPT-COF-Cu in an ethanol solution of copper chloride under reflux conditions (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  The preparation process of TPT-COF-Cu. 
The prepared TPT-COF was first investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1). Compared with the original TPT-CHO monomer, the disappearance of the CO bond (1710 cm−1) indicates the complete consumption of the starting materials. Meanwhile, a strong peak at 1620 cm−1 corresponding to the CN stretching vibration band appears. These results revealed the successful synthesis of an imine-linked TPT-COF.
 Fig. 1  IR spectra of TPT-CHO, TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu. 
The molecular structure of the TPT-COF was investigated by solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The peak at 163 ppm in 13C NMR in the lowest field is assigned to the carbon atom of the –CN– groups in the formed imine linkage double bond in the TPT-COF framework, indicating the condensation connection between the amino group in Bpy-NH2 with an aldehyde group in TPT-CHO. The other 13C NMR peaks in the range 128–187 ppm are assigned to the carbon atoms in aromatic benzene rings, while the minor peak at ∼191 ppm is ascribed to the carbon atoms of terminal aldehyde groups in the TPT-COF network.

The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental spectrum showed that the four elements C, N, O, and Cu were homogeneously dispersed in the COF matrix (Fig. 3). Besides, the Cu loading in the TPT-COF-Cu reached 6.10 wt%, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis.

The synthesized TPT-COF exhibit good crystallinity as revealed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. The main diffraction peak caused by the (100) facet in the low-angle region, located at 2.30°, and other clearly visible peaks at 4.05, 6.12, and 8.10° were attributed to the (110), (210), and (220) facets, respectively. Calculated PXRD patterns of eclipsed AA and staggered AB stacking were established. As shown in Fig. 4, the AA stacking model matched well with the experimental pattern. The calculated unit-cell parameters are a = b = 43.04 Å, c = 3.84 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° with a negligible difference (Rwp = 1.35% and Rp = 1.06%).

The thermal stability of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA shows that the thermal decomposition temperatures of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were both around 300 °C, implying that they possess good thermostability (Fig. 5).

The morphologies of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 6). TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu materials displayed good crystallinity and a regular structure. The images reveal that TPT-COF possesses a spheroid-like morphology with an average size of 50 nm. After the incorporation of Cu, the petal-like morphology of the original TPT-COF in the TPT-COF-Cu was maintained to some extent. The TEM images are shown in Fig. 6c and d, which reflect the uniform distribution of Cu in the support of TPT-COF-Cu. Additionally, no noticeable copper particles or clusters are detected in the TEM image of TPT-COF-Cu.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu have been determined and the results were shown in Fig. 7. According to the classification of IUPAC, IV-type isotherm is fit for this sorption profile, implying that the regular mesoporous structure existed in the synthesized materials. The pore size distribution of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu, calculated by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, shows that the mesopores are mainly distributed at 2–3 nm. The resulting BET surface areas were 1597.29 m2 g−1 for TPT-COF and 105.54 m2 g−1 for TPT-COF-Cu, respectively. The decreased surface area of TPT-COF-Cu can be accounted for by Cu complexation.

To gain further insight into the interactions between Cu and COF material, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were conducted. As shown in Fig. 8, XPS survey scan of TPT-COF-Cu demonstrates the existence of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and copper species in TPT-COF-Cu material. The binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 is located at 934.61 eV, illustrating that Cu species existed in the +2 state in TPT-COF-Cu. Compared with free Cu(II) (934.33 eV), the binding energy for Cu(II) 2p3/2 in TPT-COF-Cu decreased by 0.28 eV. The satellite peak at 943.85 eV indicates the unfilled electron state of the Cu 3d9 orbital, while the shoulder peak at 932.20 eV and the satellite peak at 941.26 eV indicate the presence of Cu(I) in TPT-COF-Cu. The presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) may be due to valence tautomers.32 Additionally, the binding energy of the pyridine N 1s in the TPT-COF has been shifted from 399.14 eV to 399.45 eV after loading Cu. It means that the electron cloud density of nitrogen decreases and that of Cu increases. Compared with TPT-COF, a new N–Cu peak occurs at 398.42 eV in TPT-COF-Cu, which confirms the coordination of copper. These results indicated that the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst is formed by the coordination of Cu with N atoms.

Then, as key parameters of photoredox catalysis, UV/vis absorption, band gaps, the redox potentials, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent responses for TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were measured and estimated.
The UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectrum (DRS) of the synthesized TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu samples is shown in Fig. 9. Their UV–Vis DRS spectra showed broad absorption bands ranging from the ultraviolet to visible-light region, in line with their yellow colour under sunlight, suggesting their strong visible-light harvesting nature. Accordingly, the optical band gap energies are estimated to be 2.22 eV and 2.39 for TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu, respectively, based on the Tauc plots calculated from the UV/Vis DRS data.

To estimate the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu, cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were further performed (Fig. 10). From the onset of the reductive peak in CV, the Ered, onset value of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu was found to be −0.88 and −0.86 V in reference to the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium. Further, HOMO and LUMO levels of TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were estimated to be ELUMO = −3.92 and −3.94 eV and EHOMO = −6.96 and −6.82 eV, respectively, following the equations of LUMO = −[(Ered, onset vs. SCE − E1/2,FC + 4.8 V)] eV, HOMO = LUMO − Eg).33

The photoelectrochemical properties of the TPT-COF and TPT-COF-Cu were studied by using EIS. As shown in Fig. 11, the radius of the Nyquist semicircle of TPT-COF-Cu was much smaller than that of the pristine TPT-COF, suggesting the reduced resistance and enhanced charge migration ability, which is favourable for charge transfer during the photocatalytic process. As further support, the photocurrent responses were recorded (Fig. 12). In comparison, the photocurrent intensity of TPT-COF-Cu with the Cu co-catalyst showed an enhancement of photocurrent density response when the light was switched on in comparison with that of the pure TPT-COF sample, corresponding to the low charge recombination rates and high charge transfer efficiency during a photocatalytic reaction.

The photocatalytic activity of the prepared TPT-COF-Cu was evaluated for coupling of phenylacetylene and diethyl phosphite as the model reaction under blue LED irradiation at room temperature. Various reaction parameters such as solvent, base, reaction time and amount of catalyst were tried, and selected results are given in Table 1. Various solvents were screened it was found that the reaction performed in H2O failed to give only a trace amount of coupling product (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction was carried out in ethyl lactate (EL), 1,4-dioxane, EtOH, γ-valerolactone, CH3CN, toluene, cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), DMF, DMSO, THF and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-Me THF) led to the formation of the expected product in moderate to high yields (Table 1, entries 2–12). Incomplete conversion of the starting material was observed with a Bu4NBr/Im-based DES as the solvent (entry 13). Considering that 2-Me THF is a promising solvent for organic synthesis due to its low miscibility with water, remarkable stability and relatively low toxicity comparison with THF,34 it was chosen as the most suitable solvent for this coupling reaction. Several commonly used bases such as Et3N, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, and DBU were also assessed, and the experimental results proved that Et3N displayed higher efficiency compared with other bases (entries 14–16). It is worth noting that the reaction was performed without a base under similar conditions to give a small conversion of the starting phenylacetylene (entry 17). Further optimization of the reaction time demonstrated that 3.0 h gave the best result. In addition, screening different light sources demonstrates that blue light is the best choice under the standard conditions compared with green or white lights. When the reaction was carried out in a dark environment (entry 21), it was found that only a trace amount of the target product was detected. When using TPT-COF instead of TPT-COF-Cu under similar conditions, no product was detected, indicating the important role of Cu in the framework. When pure CuCl2 was used for this reaction, also significant amounts of the product were observed (entry 25), albeit much lower than that obtained with TPT-COF-Cu, which suggests that the photosensitive triazine based TPT-COF scaffold is essential. The amount of the catalyst used in the reaction was also investigated. The results indicated that decreasing the catalyst loading gave a slightly lower yield of 75%, while no improvement in the yield of 3a was observed by increasing the amount of catalyst (entries 27 and 28). It is noteworthy to mention that the reaction could not proceed under an Ar atmosphere (entry 29). The same efficiency can be achieved by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an oxygen balloon (entry 30).

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 12), the general applicability and limitation of the method were evaluated. As shown in Table 2, phenylacetylenes, bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl ring at different positions, underwent a coupling reaction with diethyl phosphite smoothly to deliver the desired products in excellent yields. The halogen substituents, such as –F, –Cl or –Br regardless of the substitution patterns, were well tolerated without the detection of dehalogenative byproducts. Notably, when heteroaryl terminal alkynes such as 3-ethynylthiophene and 3-ethynylpyridine reacted efficiently and furnished the alkynylphosphonates 3n and 3o in high yields.

a Reaction conditions: phenylacetylene (1.0 mmol), diethyl phosphite (1 mmol), Et3N (1 mmol), TPT-COF (30 mg) catalyst in 2-Me THF (2 ml), blue LED irradiation, room temperature, isolated yields.












Next, we studied the scope of H-phosphonates. Gratefully, we found that dibutyl phosphonate, although it has a higher theoretical bond dissociation energy of the P–H bond, could react with phenylacetylenes without difficulties to generate the alkynylphosphonates 3r–3y in high yield. Furthermore, this process also pertains to sterically hindered diphenylphosphite. Notably, previous synthesis of these kinds of products only gave a very lower yield or did not yield the coupled product.18,35 To our delight, diphenylphosphine oxide also served as highly effective coupling partners under the reaction conditions to provide the target products 3ae and 3af in 90% yield.
To explore the practicality of this protocol, gram-scale synthesis was performed with 10 mmol phenylacetylene and diethyl phosphite under optimized reaction conditions. Gratifyingly, the target product 3a was isolated in 92% yield in 3 h (Scheme 3). Overall, this green process can enable diethyl(phenylethynyl)phosphonate (3a) at the preparative scale with an E factor of 8.36, 99% atom economy, 91% reaction mass efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency, and 91% atom efficiency, which are far better than previously reported processes10 (E factor of 70.03, 80% atom economy, 53% reaction mass efficiency, 80% carbon efficiency, and 67% atom efficiency, see details in the ESI†). As evident from these factors, the current photochemical process does not require any ligands, oxidants and expensive metal catalysts, so it meets the green chemistry metrics.36
 Scheme 3  Evaluation of the green chemistry metrics and gram-scale synthesis of 3a. 
To elucidate the mechanism, several radical quenching experiments were carried out for the model reaction under the standard reaction conditions (Table 3). When 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidyloxy (TEMPO) or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was added to the reaction system, the yields of the corresponding product 3a slashed dramatically, which suggested that a radical process should be involved (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). Next, the reaction was carried out under a N2 environment instead of air, and only a trace amount of product was obtained. Moreover, after the addition of cobalt acetylacetonate as a singlet oxygen scavenger (1O2) under identical conditions, a conversion of 87% was observed, while adding a superoxide radical  scavenger such as benzoquinone to the reaction mixture, only 12% yield of the product was obtained, which indicates that superoxide radicals may play a more important role than singlet oxygen in this oxidative coupling reaction. In addition, trace conversions were observed in the absence of light irradiation, indicating the critical role of light in the reaction.

On the basis of the above results and the precedent reports,29,37 a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed (Scheme 4). In this dual catalytic process, the TPT-COF cycle and the Cu cycle are interconnected by electron and radical transfer. The TPT-COF produces excited state TPT-COF* upon visible-light irradiation. Subsequent single electron transfer (SET) oxidation of diethyl phosphite via photoexcited TPT-COF* yields a phosphine radical cation (II) and TPT-COF˙− (IV). Then, the base-promoted deprotonation of II delivers the key P-centered radical III. The resulting radical anionic TPT-COF˙− species reduce dioxygen to a superoxide radical . Concurrently, a SET reduction of LnCuIICl2 by TPT-COF˙− (IV) delivers LnCuICl (V) and regenerates the TPT-COF. The P-centered radical (III) then rapidly combines with the LnCuICl (V) to form a CuII–phosphine complex (VI). This CuII-phosphine complex is then again reduced to a CuI–phosphine complex (VII) by TPT-COF˙− (IV). Then, the oxidative addition of the CuI–phosphine complex (VII) to phenylacetylene in the presence of  gives a CuIII-complex (VIII) and H2O2. Indeed, H2O2 was detected in the reaction filtrate by adding an excess amount of saturated NaI, where a triiodide (I3−) species with a characteristic UV–vis absorption peak at 350 nm is formed by reaction of H2O2 with an excess amount of I−.38 Finally, reductive elimination of VIII gives the final C–P bond formation product 3a, while releasing the LnCuICl species V.
 Scheme 4  Proposed reaction mechanism. 
For any given heterogeneous catalyst, its stability, efficient recovery and recycling are important aspects that enable cost-effective applications. To prove these features, we performed recycling experiments for the model reaction under optimized reaction conditions. The catalyst was separated from the mixture, washed several times with ethanol, and collected by centrifugation. The catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C and reused. As shown in Fig. 13, the catalyst was recycled and reused up to eight times without any significant decrease in photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the stability and durability of the catalyst were investigated after eight cycles using TEM and SEM characterization (Fig. 6). The basic morphology of the recovered TPT-COF-Cu did not suffer from major changes after 8 cycles. At the same time, the nitrogen sorption measurements revealed that the surface area of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst slightly decreased (Fig. 7). The change in morphology and decrease in surface area may be due to the repeated exposure of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst to light irradiation conditions.
 Fig. 13  Stability and recycling of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst for the synthesis of 3a. Reaction conditions: 1 mmol ethynylbenzene, 1 mmol diethyl phosphonate, 1 mmol Et3N, 30 mg of catalyst, 2 mL of 2-Me THF, room temperature, blue LED irradiation, 3 h. 
In order to check the heterogeneity of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst, a hot filtration test was conducted. This catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration after 2 h of reaction, and the filtrate was kept under the same conditions. It was found that the reaction was interrupted immediately, and no further reaction was detected after the removal of the catalyst, which clearly indicated the heterogeneous characteristics of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis showed that only a practically negligible amount of copper (2.8 ppm) was detected in the filtrate. ICP-MS analysis revealed that the Cu content of the TPT-COF-Cu catalyst before and after 8 cycles slightly decreases from 6.10 to 5.96 wt%. Therefore, the abovementioned results demonstrated that TPT-COF-Cu can be considered as a reproducible and highly stable catalyst.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel imine-linked triazine-based COF with a highly crystalline structure and excellent textural properties has been synthesized using deep eutectic solvents as green media. The obtained copper immobilized on the COF material acts as the photocatalyst while the incorporated copper sites act as the active transition metal species for a visible-light driven C–P cross-coupling reaction for the synthesis of alkynylphosphonates. The resulting TPT-COF-Cu exhibits high catalytic activity, broad substrate adaptability, and outstanding recyclability and stability. This research not only provides a green and facile route for the phosphorylation of terminal alkynes, but also significantly expands the application scope of COF-based photocatalysts.
Experimental
General
Unless otherwise indicated, all solvents and reagents were purchased directly from commercial distributors and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were recorded using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer. Surface morphology and particle size were studied using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed using a Hitachi H-7650 microscope at 80 kV. Melting points were determined using an X-5 apparatus and were uncorrected. The IR spectra were recorded with KBr pellets in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 using a Thermo Fisher iS50 spectrometer. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Zhongke Niujin AS 400 spectrometer using deuterated solvents as the internal standard and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million. The mass spectra were recorded using a 3200 Qtrap instrument with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The ICP-MS analyses were carried out with an X Series 2 spectrometer. Photochemical reactions were performed in a photoreactor (manufactured by Xi'an WATTECS experimental equipment Co. Ltd, WP-VLH-1020). UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-vis 2550 system. lectrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Mott–Schottky plots and photocurrent–time (I–T) profiles were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China) on a three-electrode system. In detail, Pt and the saturated mercury electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and Na2SO4 (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution.
Synthesis of the Bu4NBr/Im-based DES
Following the previously reported procedure,39 a mixture of Bu4NBr (9.66 g, 30 mmol) and imidazole (4.76 g, 70 mmol) was ground with a pestle, then transferred to a round bottom flask and heated at 100 °C for 1 h. A homogeneous colorless liquid was formed, which was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h to give a Bu4NBr/Im-based DES with a melting point of 21 °C.
Synthesis of TPT-COF
4,4′,4′′-((1,3,5-Triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde (2.0 mmol, 0.88 g) and [2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-diamine (3.0 mmol, 0.59 g) were added to a glass tube with the Bu4NBr/Im-based DES (20 g). After being sonicated for 10 min, the mixture was allowed to stand at 90 °C for 12 h. The obtained yellow powder was collected by filtration and washed with water and ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. The as-synthesized powder was activated with supercritical CO2 (ScCO2), followed by drying under vacuum at room temperature for 8 h.
Synthesis of TPT-COF-Cu
Copper chloride (13.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous EtOH (20 mL), and then TPT-COF (200 mg) was added. The mixture was refluxed with stirring for 3 h. The Cu(II) bound COF was collected by filtration and washed with EtOH using Soxhlet extraction for 24 h to remove the excess CuCl2. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h to give brown powder TPT-COF-Cu.
General procedure for the phosphorylation of terminal alkynes
A mixture of the terminal alkyne (1.0 mmol), H-phosphonate (1.0 mmol), 2-Me THF (2.0 mL), triethylamine (1.0 mmol) and TPT-COF-Cu (30 mg) was stirred under the irradiation of 10 W blue LEDs (460–470 nm) at room temperature in air. The light source was placed approximately 2.0 cm away from the reaction vessel. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC analysis. After the reaction was complete, the catalyst was separated by filtering. The filtrate was diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and washed with HCl (1.0 mol l−1, 10 mL) and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was collected and dried with Na2SO4, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (eluent: petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) to afford the desired pure product 3. The recovered catalyst was washed with ethanol and ethyl acetate, dried in an oven and kept in a desiccator for further use.
